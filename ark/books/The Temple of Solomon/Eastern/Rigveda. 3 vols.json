Patrick’s persuasive powers are well known, and we were intrigued and easily persuaded. Although the “quick” element of the proposition was not exactly fulfilled, we wish to thank Patrick abun-dantly for starting us on this path, which has provided both of us with the most sustained and satisfying intellectual experience of our lives, and for his constant encouragement and sage advice along the way.That we could undertake this project at all is entirely due to our shared guru, Stanley Insler, with whom we first read R̥gveda in 1971. Stanley’s combination of meticulous philology with inventive interpretation and imaginative reading, never accepting conventional wisdom without scrutiny—however many millennia the conventional wisdom has held—has been a constant inspiration to us. And not only is our general approach to the text entirely informed by his teaching and example, but many of our interpretations of particular passages first saw the light of day in his classes.Over the years we have read R̥gveda with several generations of students, many of whom are now colleagues and friends, and other colleagues have read portions of our translation or discussed it with us, offering helpful and trenchant criticism and supportive encouragement. We cannot name them all, but among the many we wish to mention especially Jim Benson, Wendy Doniger, Harry Falk, Ben Fortson, Oliver Freiberger, Arlo Griffiths, Dieter Gunkel, Mark Hale, Hans Hock, Jan Houben, Joshua Katz, Jared Klein, Sasha Lubotsky, Jesse Lundquist, Craig Melchert, Chris Minkowski, Marianne Oort, Asko Parpola, Ted Proferes, Hanns-Peter Schmidt, Gregory Schopen, Martha Selby, Hartmut Scharfe, Oktor Skjaervø, Rupert Snell, George Thompson, Elizabeth Tucker, Brent Vine, and Jarrod Whitaker.We wish to acknowledge also the financial and institutional support that we have received. The National Endowment for the Humanities supported this project through a Collaborative Grant in 2005 that allowed us to work more frequently together during a critical period in our work. Also, we wish to thank both the University of Missouri, which provided Joel a leave to begin this project (during the academic year 1999–2000), and the University of Texas at Austin, which gave him time to continue it (in the fall 2004)."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"AcknowledgementsxWe would also like to thank Oxford University Press and especially Cynthia Read for her continuing support of the project and her patience in awaiting its completion, as well as Charlotte Steinhardt at the Press and Jashnie Jabson, our Production Editor at Newgen Knowledge Works, Chennai, for their help in prepar-ing the manuscript for publication. We want to extend special thanks to Katherine Eirene Ulrich, our skillful, vigilant, meticulous, and, above all, tactful copy-editor, without whose care many slips and infelicities would have remained in the finished version.Finally, we wish each to give heartfelt thanks to the most significant person in our individual lives.

Hymn distribution by translator 83India has a magnificent tradition of religious literature stretching over three and a half millennia, with a vast range of styles and subjects—from almost impersonal reflections on the mysteries of the cosmos, the divine, and humankind’s relation to them to deeply intimate expressions of worship. This literature is justly cele-brated, not only within the religious traditions that gave rise to the various works but around the world among people with no ties to those religious traditions. The R̥gveda is the first of these monuments, and it can stand with any of the subse-quent ones. Its range is very large—encompassing profound and uncompromising meditations on cosmic enigmas, joyful and exuberant tributes to the wonders of the world, ardent praise of the gods and their works, moving and sometimes painful expressions of personal devotion, and penetrating reflections on the ability of mor-tals to make contact with and affect the divine and cosmic realms through sacrifice and praise. Thus, much of what will distinguish later Indian religious literature is already present in the R̥gveda. Yet, though its name is known, the celebration of the R̥gveda is muted at best, even within its own tradition, and, save for a few famous hymns, its contents go unnoticed outside of that tradition.India also has a magnificent literary tradition, characterized in great part by sophisticated poetic techniques and devices and a poetic self-consciousness that glories in the transformative work that words can effect on their subjects. Again,"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Introduction3the R̥gveda is the first monument of this literary tradition and at least the equal of the later literature. The exuberance with which the poets press the boundaries of language in order to create their own reflection of the complex and ultimately impenetrable mysteries of the cosmos and the verbal devices they developed to mir-ror these cosmic intricacies resonate through the rest of the literary tradition. Yet, again, the R̥gveda figures very little in standard accounts of Indian literature and is little read or appreciated as literature.Thus the R̥gveda is not only the beginning but also one of the paramount expressions of both the religious tradition and the literary tradition, combining these two roles in a text that displays great variety, skill, and beauty. Surely it deserves a modern English translation that makes these riches available to a wider audience. Yet it does not have one; the only readily available complete English translation, the nineteenth-century product of R. T. H. Griffith, conceals rather than reveals the wonders of the R̥gveda and would (properly) discourage any sensitive reader from further pursuit of the text. Why this lacuna? The answer is quite simple: the R̥gveda is very long and very hard. Neither of these factors alone would necessarily hinder translation—both very long texts, like the Sanskrit epics, and very hard texts, like the Avestan Gāthās, are receiving their due—but the combination of the two has proved very daunting. We two transla-tors, after some fifteen years of concentrated effort on the translation and more than forty years of living with and working with the text, can attest to the rigors of the task—but even more to its joys. And we feel privileged to have spent so much time in intimate contact with the poets who shaped such an extraordinary religious and liter-ary achievement at the very dawn of the Indian tradition.In the introduction that follows we try to give readers some grounding in the world and worldview of the R̥gveda and to provide enough information to approach the translation without undue bafflement. It is not meant as a comprehensive treat-ment of the many subjects touched on, but only a stepping stone to the text itself and the readers’ direct experience of the hymns.I. Who, What, Where, When?A. VedA And R̥gVedAThe R̥gveda is the oldest Sanskrit text, composed in an archaic form of the lan-guage, known as Vedic or Vedic Sanskrit. It is a collection of over a thousand poems, composed by a number of different poets over the course of some consid-erable period of time. The poems are primarily hymns praising various gods and ritual elements and procedures, designed to be recited during ritual performance; that is, they are liturgical compositions. However, they are also finely crafted and self-conscious literary productions of the highest quality.As the first text in Sanskrit, the R̥gveda is somewhat isolated, and many of the difficulties of its interpretation stem from the fact that there are no parallel or closely contemporary texts. Yet, it is poised between two bodies of textual"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"The Rigveda4material that can contribute to its interpretation, and the characteristic features from these two types of texts, mingled uniquely in the R̥gveda, help account for its distinctive quality. On the one hand, it stands at the end of a long tradition of Indo-European and Indo-Iranian praise poetry, most nearly mirrored in the Old Avestan Gāthās attributed to Zarathustra. On the other, it stands as the earliest of the ritual texts collectively known as the Vedas and forms a part of the inter-locking ritual system set forth in the Vedas.There are four Vedas: the R̥gveda, Sāmaveda, Yajurveda, and Atharvaveda. The first three are the provinces of individual priests, who function together to per-form the solemn rituals of the Vedic liturgical system, later, in the middle Vedic period, known as śrauta rituals. Each of those three Vedas also represents a differ-ent type of ritual speech. Thus, the R̥gveda belongs to the Hotar priest, who recites or chants the poetry; the Sāmaveda to the Udgātar priest, who sings the poetry to set tunes called sāmans. The vast majority of the verbal material in the Sāmaveda is borrowed from the R̥gveda. The Yajurveda is the realm of the Adhvaryu priest; his verbal product is the yajus, a short verbal formula that generally accompanies the physical actions that are the main task of the Adhvaryu. Each of these three priests is accompanied by other priests who share their principal functions. So in the later soma ritual, for example, the number of priests can be sixteen or seven-teen. The Atharvaveda stands outside of this ritual system and consists primarily of hymns and spells of a more “popular” nature, often magical or healing. Despite its lack of connection to the solemn ritual, the Atharvaveda is especially important for R̥gvedic studies because it is linguistically the closest text to the R̥gveda and is thus the second oldest text in Sanskrit. The two texts also share a number of pas-sages and hymns, although the Atharvaveda often varies the wording or order of verses. The R̥gvedic hymns found also in the Atharvaveda are often drawn from the younger layers of the R̥gveda.We will treat the structure of the text in more detail below; here we will pro-vide only the most general outline. The text consists of 1028 hymns divided into ten books or maṇḍalas (lit. “circles”), of varying lengths. The arrangement of the hymns within each maṇḍala and the arrangement of the maṇḍalas themselves attest strongly to the deliberate quality of the collection and organization of the hymns, as we will demonstrate below. Maṇḍalas II–VII are known as the “Family Books,” each attributed to a different bardic family. Maṇḍala VIII contains smaller collec-tions attributed to particular poets or poetic families, and has a somewhat aber-rant character. Maṇḍala IX contains all and only the hymns dedicated to Soma Pava māna, “self-purifying soma,” the deified ritual drink at a particular moment in its ritual preparation. Maṇḍalas I and X were added to the collection later, though they both contain much that is contemporaneous with the linguistic and religious level of the core parts of the R̥gveda, as well as some more recent and “popular” material. Both I and X contain exactly 191 hymns, a synchronicity that was clearly not by chance."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Introduction5B. dAte And CultuRAl Context of the R̥gVedAAs was mentioned above, the R̥gveda is part of the long tradition of Indo-European praise poetry, composed and performed orally and deploying inherited set verbal formulae, on which the poets also ring changes. Thus, whatever date(s) we assign to the actual composition of the particular hymns found in the text, the temporal horizon of the R̥gveda stretches a good deal further back, in that the poetic tech-niques and even some of its precise verbal realizations go back many centuries, even millennia.The dating of the R̥gveda has been and is likely to remain a matter of contention and reconsideration because as yet little has been uncovered in the material record or in the hymns themselves that allows us to date the period of the R̥gvedic hymns. One attempt at dating begins with an absence. Since the R̥gveda does not mention iron but does mention other kinds of metal, it is likely a pre–Iron Age, Bronze Age text. The dates at which iron appears in the archaeological record in South Asia differ in different parts of the subcontinent. For the northwest, which comprises the geographic horizon of the R̥gveda, iron began to be manufactured around 1200–1000 bce. The R̥gvedic hymns, therefore, would have to have been composed no later than this period. However, iron is attested in the Atharvaveda. While the R̥gveda is older than the Atharvaveda, there is no basis for assuming a substantial gap in time between the end of the R̥gvedic period and the Atharvaveda. Therefore the date of the latest portions of the R̥gveda is not likely to be very much earlier that 1200–1000 bce. It is also likely that the period of the composition of R̥gvedic hymns did not extend more than several centuries before this terminus ad quem. Witzel (in Jamison and Witzel 1992: 2 n. 2) has noted that the poets and kings mentioned in the anukramaṇīs (indices) and in the hymns themselves comprise perhaps five or six generations. Generously rounding these numbers, we can then place the period of the composition of the R̥gvedic hymns sometime within the period 1400–1000 bce or, even more approximately, within the second half of the second millennium bce. At best these dates encompass only the hymns of the R̥gveda as we have them. The poetic conventions on which the R̥gveda was built are very much older, extending back to the Indo-Iranian period with roots into the Indo-European period. The R̥gveda is only the surface of a very deep tradition.While the date of the R̥gveda remains problematic, the hymns provide informa-tion that helps identify the geographic area in which the hymns were composed. Above all, the rivers mentioned in the text help establish the place of the R̥gveda. These rivers range from the Kabul and Kurram rivers in present-day Afghanistan to the Ganges in the east. Its center is the greater Punjab, the region of the Indus and its major tributaries. Following the likely internal chronology of the R̥gveda, geographic references in the text suggest a movement from the northwest toward the east. Thus while the earliest parts of the R̥gveda were likely composed in the northwest, in the latest parts of the text the area has extended further into the subcontinent, and its center has shifted toward Kurukṣetra, roughly the area of the modern state of Haryana."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"The Rigveda6One of the reasons that the R̥gveda is difficult to date is that there is no material evidence that we can clearly associate with the people who composed the R̥gveda, the people who called themselves Āryas. Nor would we expect very much material evidence, since the hymns make no mention of any permanent religious structures or enduring settlements. The Āryas formed instead a semi-nomadic pastoralist society, in which seasons of settlement alternated with seasons of migration. This migration likely contributed to the extension of the culture into new areas. The period of movement was also the season of conflict in the competition for land and the season of cattle-raiding, especially for younger males eager to acquire assets on which to establish their own livelihood. Cattle were the primary source of wealth, although the hymns also mention sheep, buffaloes, goats, and camels. Horses too were essential and prized, since they enabled the Āryas’ mobility and contributed to their success in battle. Although the economy was fundamentally pastoral, the Āryas practiced some agriculture during the times of settlement; one hymn (IV.57) specifically celebrates agricultural divinities, and the plow is occasionally men-tioned. The hymns refer to ya﻿́va “barley” or “field grain,” which was used both for food and in the rituals. The R̥gveda does not attest rice cultivation.In addition to the absence of material remains, another difficulty in describ-ing the cultural context of the R̥gveda is that its hymns depict only a part of the religion and society at the period. First, the R̥gveda represents the continuation of an elite tradition also attested in the Avesta and therefore quite ancient. As such, it reflects the religious practice only of the upper strata of Ārya society. Second, it is primarily a collection of liturgical hymns for use in the soma sacrifice, surely the most prestigious ritual of the period but still only one kind of ritual, representing a particular and limited set of religious concerns. Finally, the soma sacrifices were sponsored and performed by socially elite men, and they reflected the religious con-cerns of these men. The text did not directly address the religious lives of women or of other social classes nor indeed even other aspects of the religious lives of elite males. Thus, while the R̥gveda is a sizable text and from it we can derive a great deal of information about the soma rite and about those who participated in it, we are still dealing only with a segment of Ārya religion and society. However, we can gather information on non-elite concerns and on the daily life and pursuits of the elite incidentally, often through similes or imagery modeling ritual elements and procedures or through the crediting of gods with activities also appropriate to humans, such as warfare.Indirectly, we can also get some information about other aspects of religion. First, although the soma rite was primarily focused on the god Indra, already in the R̥gvedic period it had begun to incorporate the worship of gods around whom independent ritual traditions existed. So, for example, the Aśvins were worshiped already during the Indo-Iranian period and in the Pravargya rite, which is not a soma ritual. But already in the R̥gvedic period the Aśvins were recipients of soma, and by the time of the later Veda the Pravargya rite had been incorporated into the soma tradition. Moreover, especially in book X, there are hymns that address a"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Introduction7variety of religious interests separate from those of the soma rite. There are funeral (X.14–16) and wedding (X.85) hymns. There are hymns against cowives (X.145), against rivals (X.166), against witchcraft (X.155), against miscarriage (X.162), and against disease (X.161, 163). There are hymns for the safety of cattle (X.169), for conception (X.183), and for successful birth (X.184). In short the R̥gveda already attests rites that address domestic and individual issues principally associated with the Atharvaveda. These hymns point to substantial ritual activity outside of the soma rituals.C. WhAt do the hymns do?The overwhelming majority of R̥gvedic hymns have as their major aim to praise the god(s) to whom the hymn is dedicated and to induce said god(s) to repay the praise with requested favors. To a certain extent different gods receive different types of praise, but the praise generally focuses on the appearance, qualities, and power of the gods and on their remarkable deeds. Some divinities attract particular atten-tion to their appearance: for instance, the seductive beauty of Dawn, the glittering ostentation of the Maruts, the endlessly fascinating transformations of physical fire and its divine embodiment Agni. Others, like the Ādityas, have few if any physical characteristics, but are more celebrated for their mental and moral qualities. The supernatural powers of almost all the gods receive abundant praise, though again the types of power lauded differ from god to god.Their powers are actualized in their deeds, the recounting of which occupies a large portion of many R̥gvedic hymns. Some gods have a robust narrative mythol-ogy, and episodes from this mythology are constantly related or alluded to; the most prominent example is Indra with his catalogue of great victories over both divine and mortal enemies. Those without much narrative mythology tend to be credited with general cosmogonic deeds or with the regular maintaining and order-ing of the world and its inhabitants.This praise of divine powers and deeds is not a disinterested act, for the aim is to persuade or constrain the gods to mobilize these same powers on behalf of their worshipers and to replicate their great deeds in the present for the benefit of these same worshipers. In the all-pervasive system of reciprocity and exchange that might be termed the dominant social ideology underlying the R̥gveda, praise of the gods requires requital: they must provide recompense for what they receive from those praising them. Worshipers are not shy about specifying what they want in exchange: the good things of this world—wealth, especially in livestock and gold, sons, and a long lifespan—and divine aid in defeating opponents, be they enemies in battle or rival sacrificers. The sign that the praise has been successful is the epiph-any of the god(s) addressed, so that many hymns urgently invite the dedicand(s) to journey to the particular sacrifice in which the poet is participating and then jubilantly proclaim the arrival of the god(s) at that particular sacrificial ground as the ritual is taking place."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"The Rigveda8This epiphany at the sacrifice brings us back to the liturgical role of the hymns, for it should never be forgotten that almost all the hymns in the R̥gveda were com-posed to accompany the physical acts of the ritual, which are happening simultane-ously with the recitation. But the word “accompany” here is too weak. The hymns are not merely verbal background music, as it were. As will be discussed further below, another important aspect of Vedic ideology is the belief in the power of the word: words make things happen. The physical actions of ritual alone would be insufficient; it is the skillfully crafted, properly formulated hymn, the verbal portion of the ritual, that makes the liturgical acts effective.While the great majority of R̥gvedic hymns have a liturgical form that obviously reflects the soma rite, there are examples in which this model is not evident. Among them are the ākhyāna or “narrative” hymns, as Oldenberg (1883, 1885) called them, which take the form of a dialogue between two or more figures. These hymns occur in the later portions of the R̥gveda, especially book X. They include, for example, dialogues between the sage Agastya and his wife Lopāmudrā (I.179); between Yama and his twin sister Yamī (X.10); between the celestial Apsaras Urvaśī and her aban-doned mortal husband Purūravas (X.95); among the monkey Vr̥ṣākapi, the god Indra, and Indra’s wife Indrāṇī (X.86); and between Indra’s dog, Saramā, and the tribe of Paṇis (X.108). It is possible that some of these hymns comment on the soma rite, but others were composed for different ritual purposes, which have to be surmised, if they can be surmised at all, from the contents of the hymns. Our intro-ductions to individual hymns discuss possible applications. A few may represent individual or domestic concerns, such as the recovery of lost cattle (X.108); oth-ers may embody the differing viewpoints of ongoing ritual controversies (I.179) or provide a dramatic modeling of a particularly important ritual (the Horse Sacrifice in X.86) or the mythological underpinning for a series of hymns (X.10 for the fol-lowing funeral hymns). An evergreen controversy concerns the form of the ākhyāna hymns. Oldenberg (1885) argued that the oldest type of epic composition mixed poetry and prose. The poetry principally consisted of the words spoken by char-acters in the narrative, and the prose provided the narrative context for the verses. This form is found in the Pāli Jātakas, the stories of the Buddha’s former births, for example, in which the verses are considered canonical but the connecting prose is not. Oldenberg suggested that the ākhyāna hymns conformed to this type and that what we have preserved is a skeleton of canonical dialogue that originally had prose narrative attached to it. Oldenberg’s theory has the advantage of explaining why these hymns are difficult to interpret and why even the speakers of particular verses are not readily identifiable. While we find the theory attractive, many scholars have found it unnecessary and understand these hymns to have been recited as they are transmitted to us.There are also hymns that, though they may be ritually employed in the later Veda, were perhaps not composed for ritual use. Gonda (1978: 25–38) compares some of these hymns to medieval stotras: expressions of emotion, praise, and devotion to the gods. However, such functions do not preclude their application in rites, even if their"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Introduction9original ritual context is not clear to us. A better possibility for non-liturgical hymns is the type that comments on the ritual and its meaning. Generally occurring in the latest strata of the R̥gveda, these include X.129, the Nāsadīyasūkta (“that not exist-ing did not exist”); X.121, the Hiraṇyagarbhasūkta (“Golden Embryo”); X.90, the Puruṣasūkta (“Hymn of the Man”); and I.164, the “Riddle Hymn” of Dīrghatamas. These are sometimes called the “philosophical” or “speculative” hymns of the R̥gveda, but this is a misleading description, since they are not primarily abstract philosophic reflections on the nature of things. Rather, they are better viewed as forerunners of the Brāhmaṇa and Āraṇyaka texts that interpret the ritual in general, particular rituals, or aspects of the ritual. So, for example, X.90 comments on the sacrifice through the symbol of the “Man,” which represents both the world and the sacrifice. X.121 concerns the royal consecration rite, and X.129 sets forth the creative power of knowledge and therefore the power of the poets and priests who possess it. In many of these hymns the meaning of the ritual is expressed in terms of a cos-mogony or cosmology. While such hymns share many themes and draw upon com-mon stores of symbols, there is not a single R̥gvedic cosmogony or a single R̥gvedic cosmology to which they refer. Rather, they represent imaginable worlds that explain why things are as they are. To force the hymns into the straitjacket of a unitary view of the world underestimates the power and originality of the poets who produced these cosmogonic and cosmological models.d. the PoetWho is the poet, and why is he composing poetry? The poets participate in an elaborate patronage system. They are hirelings, but of a very superior sort. As craftsmen of the word, their contribution to the success of the sacrifice that estab-lishes and maintains the mutually beneficial relationship between men and gods is critical, and they serve the patrons, often royal patrons (whatever “royal” meant at this period), who arrange for and underwrite the sacrifice. The poet provides the praise poetry that the patron needs to put the gods in his debt, and he speaks on behalf of his patron, in making specific requests of the gods for goods and services. The poet’s reward comes as a second-hand or indirect benefit of the success of his verbal labors: the patron should receive from the gods what he asked for, and he provides some portion of that bounty to the poet in recompense. This payment from his patron is sometimes celebrated by the poet at the end of his hymn, in a genre known as the dānastuti, literally “praise of the gift,” in which the largesse of the patron—cows, horses, gold, women—is catalogued and glorified. Or, if it is less than expected or desired, scorned. The tone of the dānastuti is often teasing and jokey, and the language colloquial.But the making of poetry is not simply a business proposition. Poets take great pride in their work and often reflect on their part in the poetic tradition and also on their ability to use the tools of the tradition in innovative and creative ways. They are self-conscious, naming themselves and addressing themselves, calling attention"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"The Rigveda10to their verbal tricks and achievements and their ability to bring fame and material success to their patrons and glory to their gods. Some poets have very distinctive poetic personalities, as we will have occasion to remark throughout the translation.The R̥gvedic poet’s social position and his role in the patronage economy was clearly inherited from Indo-Iranian and Indo-European times, and one of the closest parallels is found in ancient Greek, in the poetry of Pindar (5th century bce), who was hired to celebrate the victors in the various Greek games and did so in verse as elaborate, finely crafted, and deliberately obscure as that found in the R̥gveda. For further on the Indo-European poet, see Watkins (1995).e. stRuCtuRe of the R̥gVedAThe R̥gveda comprises 1028 sūktas or hymns, which contain a total of slightly more than 10,500 verses and which are divided into ten maṇḍalas, or books, of uneven size. Within each maṇḍala there is a further division of the hymns into anuvākas or “recitations” consisting of several hymns. The number of hymns in an anuvāka varies within a maṇḍala, and the number of anuvākas in each maṇḍala varies from maṇḍala to maṇḍala. As its name suggests, the anuvāka division was created prin-cipally to provide convenient units for memorization and recitation. Although this division is occasionally indicated in editions of the R̥gveda, we have not included it in the translation. There is a second division of the R̥gvedic corpus into eight aṣṭakas, but this is a purely mechanical arrangement also created to facilitate mem-orization. In this latter division each of the eight aṣṭakas has eight adhyāyas, each adhyāya has thirty-three vargas, and each varga has five verses. Since unlike the divi-sion of the text into maṇḍalas, neither of these divisions reflects the contents of the R̥gveda, therefore we will use the division into maṇḍalas exclusively.Invaluable work on the organization and history of the R̥gveda was done by Bergaigne (1886, 1887) and Oldenberg (1888: 191–270), ably summarized and amplified by Witzel (1995a, 1997). Following their work, the structure of the R̥gveda and the broad outlines of its compositional history are as follows. The core of the R̥gveda and its oldest part are the “Family Books,” so called because the hymns in each maṇḍala are attributed to poets belonging to the same family lineage. These comprise Maṇḍalas II–VII. The family lineages are the following:II Gr̥tsamadaIII ViśvāmitraIV VāmadevaV AtriVI BharadvājaVII VasiṣṭhaWithin the R̥gvedic corpus, the six Family Books are generally ordered according to the increasing number of hymns in each successive maṇḍala. So Maṇḍala II con-tains the fewest number of hymns and VII the greatest. Within each Family Book"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Introduction11the hymns are ordered first by deity. Thus the hymns to Agni come first, followed by those to Indra. After these collections are the hymns to other deities, generally arranged by the decreasing number of hymns to each deity within the maṇḍala. Within each deity collection the hymns are arranged by their length, beginning with the longest hymns. If two hymns are of equal length, they are ordered according to meter, with the hymns in longer meters placed before those in shorter meters.The arrangement of the Family Books and their hymns, therefore, functions like an index. If you know the poet (and therefore the family of the poet), the deity to whom the hymn is addressed, the number of verses in the hymn, and the meter, then, in principle at least, you can locate the hymn within the collection. Perhaps for that reason, the oral recitation of a R̥gvedic hymn is traditionally preceded by the identification of the poet, deity, and meter. It is this kind of information that is provided by the anukramaṇīs or indices to the R̥gveda. Because the anukramaṇīs come from a later period, there has been some question about the value of their information for the R̥gvedic period. Some of the identifications of poets, in book X in particular, are derived from the content of the hymns and can be rather wonder-fully fantastic. In that book, for example, there are hymns attributed to serpents (X.76 and 94), to the “Golden Embryo,” Hiraṇyagarbha (X.121), to the god Indra (X.48–50), and to Yama (X.14) and Yamī (X.154), the first humans. Such identifi-cations are not exclusive to book X. Among the possible composers of VIII.67 are listed Matsya Sāmmada, king of the sea creatures, and fish that have been caught in a net. Also, in the ākhyāna hymns and any other hymn in which the verses are supposed to be spoken by a god or a legendary being, the anukramaṇīs ascribe authorship to that god or being. Thus, the composition of the dialogue among the monkey Vr̥ṣākapi, the god Indra, and his wife Indrāṇī (X.86) is attributed to the three of them.However, these creative identifications are much more the exception than the rule. Even though the anukramaṇīs were composed and redacted long after the R̥gvedic period, they are an invaluable resource, for, by and large, their identifica-tions of the poets of hymns are plausible. The collections they mark by assigning groups of hymns to certain poets or poetic circles correspond to the organization of the R̥gveda and to verbal, metrical, and thematic connections among these hymns. The great majority of the roughly five hundred poets named in the anukramaṇīs also appear in Pravara lists of brahmin ancestors (Mahadevan forthcoming), which supports the plausibility of the anukramaṇī identifications. Therefore, the tradi-tions transmitted in the anukramaṇīs can be a helpful guide in understanding rela-tionships among hymns, in identifying collections of hymns, and in determining the relative ages of hymns.Generally younger than the Family Books, Maṇḍala VIII largely comprises the hymns of two poetic traditions: that of the Kāṇvas (in 1–48 and 60–66) and that of the Ā ṅgirases (in 67–103). The hymns of the Āṅgirasa group are probably some-what younger than those of the Kāṇva group. However, not all the hymns in either of these two groups are from Kāṇva or Āṅgirasa poets. Rather, both collections"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"The Rigveda12include hymns by poets who belong to other families and are known in other maṇḍalas. These hymns were probably added to book VIII because they were com-posed in forms and meters characteristic of the hymns of VIII. Both the Kāṇva and the Āṅgirasa collections in VIII consist of a large number of hymns whose verses are arranged in pragāthas or tr̥cas, that is, in sequences of units (strophes) consisting of two or three verses. There are pragāthas and tr̥cas outside of VIII and non-strophic hymns in VIII, but because of the predominance of these structures in that book, pragātha and tr̥ca poetry of various poets was relocated into VIII. The significance of this collection is not entirely clear, although the marked forms of the hymns suggest that they or the priests who produced them may have had a distinct ritual function, and it is noteworthy that a large proportion of the R̥gvedic material borrowed into the Sāmaveda comes from VIII. It may be that the priests who created Maṇḍala VIII were, like the Sāmavedic priests, those who chanted R̥gvedic verses. The arrangement of hymns in VIII generally follows that of the Family Books: they are first organized by poet or poetic circle and then by deity. But the organization of the book is less transparent than that of the Family Books.Maṇḍala I also consists of two collections. One, I.51–191, probably dates from around the time of the Kāṇva hymns of VIII, and the other, I.1–50, is slightly later than the Āṅgirasa hymns of VIII. The collection of I.51–191 consists of the hymns of nine groups of poets, organized according to the same principles as the Family Books. The collection of I.1–50 consists of hymns in six groups, each attributed to a single poet. Within each of these six groups, the hymns are collected by deity, but the six differ in their arrangement of the hymns within the deity collections. The groups of I.1–50 are also distinguished by the prevalence of hymns in gāyatrī meter and in pragāthas, like the hymns of VIII, while the hymns of I.51–191 are primarily in triṣṭubh and jagatī meter.Maṇḍala IX is unusual, because it is a liturgical collection of hymns to Soma Pava māna, the soma “purifying itself ” as it runs across or through the sheep’s wool filter. It includes hymns by poets already known from the Family Books as well as by later poets. The collection is dominated especially by poets from books I, V, and VIII. It was therefore created after the Family Books and contains hymns from various periods. Like the Family Books, it is arranged in groups according to meter and then within each metrical grouping, according to decreasing number of verses.Maṇḍala X is a collection of hymns that belong to the youngest strata of the R̥gveda and forms a kind of appendix to the text. However, it shows organizational principles comparable to those we have seen in the other books. It consists of collec-tions of hymns by individual poets, which are ordered according to the decreasing number of hymns in each collection or, when collections contain an equal number of hymns, according to the number of verses in the first hymn of the collection. By roughly the second half of X, the collections are reduced to single hymns by indi-vidual poets. Finally, there is a short and late supplement to the R̥gvedic collection, the Vālakhilya hymns, which are collected in VIII.49–59."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Introduction13While this is the general organization of the text, there are many exceptions to these ordering principles. So, for example, we remarked above that the Family Books, II–VII, are ordered from the shortest to the longest. While this is generally true, it is not completely the case. Consider the list of the Family Books and the total number of hymns in each:II 43 hymnsIII 62 hymnsIV 58 hymnsV 87 hymnsVI 75 hymnsVII 104 hymnsAlthough we would have expected the sequence of maṇḍalas to show a steadily increasing number of hymns, instead book IV has fewer hymns than III and book VI fewer than V. In a similar fashion, hymns can appear out of order within the various groupings that make up both the Family Books and the other books of the R̥gveda. Such discrepancies have arisen through insertions of hymns and redactional com-binations and divisions of hymns. These alterations occurred after the initial col-lection of the R̥gveda, when the order of books and hymns was established, and by the time or at the time of Śākalya’s final redaction of the text around the middle of first millennium bce. Attention to these discrepancies can be an effective tool in reconstructing the compositional history of individual hymns and of groupings of hymns, since they allow us to see where an alteration has occurred. Oldenberg (1888: 193–94) provides the following example. In a series of single hymns with decreasing numbers of verses, V.83 is a hymn to Parjanya of ten verses and V.85 is a hymn to Varuṇa of eight verses. Between the two is V.84, a hymn to Earth of three verses. Clearly the hymn to Earth is out of sequence and was likely inserted between the hymns to Parjanya and to Varuṇa. While the fact of its insertion is obvious, there are several possible explanations for how and why this occurred. For example, V.84 could be a later composition that was later added to the R̥gveda, or it could have been composed earlier but have been moved to its current place within the collection. In either case, this little hymn is actually a riddle depicting Earth during a violent storm and must have been felt as an appropriate pendant to the Parjanya hymn (see Jamison 2013).II. History of the R̥gvedic TextA. lAnguAge And ComPositionAl teChniqueThe R̥gveda was composed in an archaic form of Sanskrit that is richer in forms and less grammatically fixed than Classical Sanskrit, but essentially identical in structure. For further discussion of the language, see section VII below. The text"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"The Rigveda14was composed entirely orally and transmitted entirely orally for a very long time, probably several millennia. But it was a type of oral composition very different from what that designation now generally brings to mind in scholarly, especially Homeric, circles. It was not an anonymous floating body of infinitely variable ver-bal material (re-)composed anew at every performance, generated in great part from fixed formulae that formed the poet’s repertoire. In contrast to the vast sprawl of epic, on which the usual model of oral-formulaic composition was formed and tested, R̥gvedic oral composition was small-scale and verbally complex. Though orally composed and making use of traditional verbal material, each hymn was composed by a particular poet, who fixed the hymn at the time of composition and who “owned” it, and it was transmitted in this fixed form thereafter.R̥gvedic verbal formulae work very differently from those in epic compo-sition. Rather than deploying fairly sizable, metrically defined, and invariant pieces—ready-made surface structures, in the felicitous phrase of Paul Kiparsky (1976: 83)—our poets seem to operate with deep-structure formulae. Invariant rep-etition is fairly rare, and when it occurs, the repeated formulae tend to be short, gen-erally shorter than the pāda (= verse line) and not necessarily metrically fixed. But the poets often assume knowledge of an underlying formula, which seldom or never surfaces as such, but which they ring changes on—by lexical or grammatical substi-tution, scrambling, semantic reversal, and the like, confounding the expectations of their audience while drawing upon their shared knowledge of the underlying verbal expression. These deep-structure formulae tend to be shared across bardic families, and we can in fact sometimes identify cognate formulae in other Indo-European poetic traditions, especially in the Old Avestan Gāthās.B. PReseRVAtion And tRAnsmissionThe structure of the R̥gveda points to several stages in the creation of the R̥gvedic text as we now have it. Collections of hymns were first made by the families of poets who produced them, and these early collections defined the various poetic tradi-tions and helped train new poets within those traditions. At some point a unified consolidation was made of six family traditions, which formed the original collec-tion of the Family Books, II–VII. As discussed above, the books were arranged from shortest to longest and the hymns of each book were organized according to the same principles. Then, probably at several intervals, the hymns of books I and VIII (except for the Vālakhilya hymns) were added, and book IX was assembled from hymns composed by poets of the other books of the R̥gveda and from hymns of younger poets. The last major additions to the collection were the hymns of book X.We do not know the precise mechanism for the formation of the R̥gvedic collec-tion or the circumstances that brought it about. There must have been some cen-tralized authority or agency that could consolidate the different family traditions and impose a single set of organizational principles on their collections. Michael"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Introduction15Witzel (cf. 1995a, 1995b, 1997, 2003) has suggested that this authority was first the Bharata tribe, as it attained hegemony over the other Vedic tribes during the R̥gvedic period, and then later the Kuru state, which arose around 1000 bce. In his view, the initial collection and organization of the Family Books, the Kāṇva hymns of VIII, and the nine collections of I.51–191 occurred under the Bharatas, and the complete collection of the R̥gveda under the Kurus. These consolidations of the religious traditions supported the political consolidations of the Bharatas and of the Kurus and reinforced their rule by means of a unified religious practice approximating a state religion. The Kuru period saw the creation not only of the complete R̥gveda but also of the other saṃhitās, and the fixation and canonization of Vedic sacrifices. The Vedic rites created at this time were composites, fashioned from different family traditions. They included extended recitations constituted of verses extracted from various parts of the R̥gveda and thus from various family traditions. The purpose of such composite rites was to create a ritual system that represented the unity of the Vedic tradition. This process is already apparent in late hymns of the R̥gveda itself (cf. Proferes 2003a). For example, R̥V IX.67 is a hymn to “self-purifying” soma. Rather than being the product of a particular poet or even a particular family of poets, it includes verses from poets representing the princi-pal brahmin lineages. It reflects an attempt to create an “ecumenical” liturgy, as Proferes (2003a: 8) calls it, one in which all the major poetic traditions had a place.The creation of the R̥gvedic Saṃhitā reflected a significant ritual change, since it marked an emphasis on liturgical appropriation and repetition of earlier material rather than, as in the R̥gvedic period itself, on the creation of new hymns. However, the tradition of R̥gvedic composition did not simply come to a halt at the close of the R̥gvedic period. The R̥gveda Khila (Scheftelowitz 1906) is a collection of hymns that do not form part of the Śākalya recension. Some of these hymns may go back to the R̥gvedic period, but most were likely composed in the following period, dur-ing which the hymns, chants, and recitations of the Atharvaveda, the Sāmaveda, and the Yajurveda were composed or assembled. The Atharvaveda itself also rep-resents the extension of hymnic composition into a wider variety of ritual contexts, a process already visible in R̥gveda book X. Beyond the Veda, elements and tech-niques typical of R̥gvedic composition appear in later praśastis, epic poetry, and even in kāvya (see Jamison 2007: chap. 4).The R̥gveda did not remain unchanged after its collection. As described above, the collection of hymns was arranged according to definable principles, but the text of the R̥gveda we have does not always follow these principles. Most of the changes were made at an early period since they are reflected in all the versions of the R̥gveda that we have or that are described in later literature. These versions were the product of Vedic schools or śākhās, which became the institutions through which the R̥gveda collection was preserved and transmitted.The R̥gveda translated here is the R̥gveda of the Śākala school, established by Śākalya, a teacher of the late Vedic period. There were other schools that produced other recensions of the R̥gveda, although most of these other recensions are now"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"The Rigveda16lost. The Caraṇav yūha, a Yajurvedic Pariśiṣṭa, lists five R̥gvedic schools: Śākala, Bāṣkala, Āśvalāyana, Śāṅkhāyana, and Māṇḍūkāyana. Other sources give larger numbers of R̥gvedic schools. There are seven according to the Atharvaveda Pariśiṣṭa, and twenty-one according to Patañjali (ca. 150 bce), although the last number reflects not the number of versions of the R̥gveda, but rather of schools that studied the R̥gveda. Of the five recensions mentioned in the Caraṇav yūha, the oldest may be the Māṇḍūkāyana, although little is known about it. The Bāṣkala school may have survived into the sixteenth century (Chaubey 2009: vii), and per-haps the Bāṣkala R̥gveda still exists somewhere in manuscript. But even without a manuscript, much is known about it from other texts. It probably dates to around the time of the Śākala recension and was close to the Śākala recension in sub-stance. According to the Anuvākānukramaṇī, the Bāṣkala R̥gveda included the first seven hymns of the Vālakhilya, but rejected the other four, and after R̥V X.191, the last hymn in the Śākala recension, it had a second saṃjñāna hymn, or hymn of “agreement,” consisting of fifteen verses. It also rearranged Maṇḍala I, so that the Kutsa collection (I.94–115) followed the Parucchepa collection (I.127–139). This rearrangement conforms better to the expected order of the collections that consti-tute Maṇḍala I and therefore may represent either an older tradition than that of the Śākala recension or a later correction made according to perceived principles. The Āśvalāyana R̥gveda has recently been published (Chaubey 2009). It was based on the Śākala recension, but includes an additional 212 verses, all of which are later than the rest of the R̥gveda. The Śāṅkhāyana R̥gveda was very similar to the Āśvalāyana R̥gveda. A sixth R̥gvedic school was the Śaiśirīya school, mentioned in the R̥gveda Prātiśākhya. Its recension again closely resembled the Śākala recension and indeed the Śaiśirīya school might have derived from the Śākala school or have been merged with it (cf. Bronkhorst 1982/83). It again contained a few more verses than does the Śākala recension. In short, the differences among the reported and attested recensions of the R̥gveda are very minor, consisting of variant ordering of some existing materials and the inclusion or not of a relatively few late verses. There seems no need to mourn the loss of these recensions.These schools produced a saṃhitā text, that is, a continuous text of the R̥gveda that includes the phonological alterations that occur between words—a phenom-enon characteristic of the Sanskrit language in general known as sandhi or “putting together.” It is this basic form of the hymns that would have been recited in their ritual contexts. But in order to secure the text, these schools also produced other forms of the R̥gveda that supported its memorization. According to Patañjali, Śākalya not only created a recension of the saṃhitā text, but also a padapāṭha text. This latter text provides a grammatical analysis of the words of the R̥gveda by restoring the forms of the words before the application of the sandhi rules when the words are strung together. It shows the schools’ interest not only in preserving and transmitting the R̥gveda, but also in understanding the text they transmitted.This history gives us reason to be confident that the Śākala R̥gveda is close to the R̥gveda that was created at the beginning of the first millennium, even though"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Introduction17the Śākala recension probably dates to some five hundred years later. We also have evidence for minor changes in the Śākala text itself. In the Śākala Padapāṭha, there is no analysis for six verses in the Saṃhitā: VII.59.12, X.20.1, 121.10, 190.1–3. They are probably missing from Padapāṭha analysis because they were not part of the text of the R̥gveda at the time of the creation of the Padapāṭha, but were added to the Śākala text at a later period. Note again that these adjust-ments primarily occur in book X, the latest part of the R̥gveda and apparently its most fluid.When we say that the Śākala R̥gveda is substantially the text created at the beginning of the first millennium bce, we need to acknowledge one significant area in which the R̥gveda recensions show demonstrable change since the col-lection of the R̥gveda. This is in the phonetics of the text. The recitation of the R̥gveda in different regions and times apparently reflected the different contem-porary dialects and conventions of recitation in those regions and times. Such change is apparent in the Śākala recension in its handling of the phonological alterations that take place between words. The Śākala school imposed a further set of euphonic or sandhi rules on the text that developed during the centuries between the composition of the text and the Śākala recension. The result is that the saṃhitā text does not always reflect the metrical structure of the verses. In most cases, the changes are sufficiently regular that it is not difficult to restore the text to its metrical shape. For example, in the saṃhitā text the last verse of the first hymn of the R̥gveda reads: I.1.9 sá naḥ pitéva sūnávé, ’gne sūpāyano﻿́ bhava / sácasvā naḥ svastáye. This hymn is composed in gāyatrī meter, so it ought to have eight syllables in each pāda. But the elision at the beginning of pāda b gives a line of seven syllables, and pāda c also apparently has seven syllables. Originally, the verse must have been recited without the elision in b: sá naḥ pitéva sūnáve, a﻿́gne sūpāyano﻿́ bhava. And in pāda c svasta﻿́ye must have been recited quadrasyllabi-cally su(v)asta﻿́ye. While it is usually not difficult to restore the meter, that work has been done for us in the edition of the R̥gveda by Barend A. van Nooten and Gary B. Holland (1994), which gives the metrically restored text of the Śākala recension.These kinds of phonetic and euphonic changes were natural in the oral trans-mission of the text, more natural than the rigid oral preservation of the text after the Vedic period. Because such changes are natural, they were likely not deliber-ate alterations. More importantly, the reciters of the R̥gveda did not deliberately change and, for the most part, did not change at all the order of the books of the R̥gveda, the order of verses within hymns, the words of the hymns, or their grammar. There were a few—but relatively few—changes to the order of hymns, such as that reflected in the difference between the Bāṣkala and Śākala recensions in the order of Maṇḍala I. This early “freezing” of the text is very important and one of the characteristics that makes the R̥gveda so valuable for understanding the linguistic, religious, and literary history of South Asia. The R̥gvedic tradition has preserved a very ancient literature with extraordinary fidelity, with no grammatical or lexical"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"The Rigveda18modernization or adjustment of contents to later conceptual conditions. It could have been otherwise. In R̥gvedic hymns that also appear in the Atharvaveda, the latter text not uncommonly shows a different verse order, and in both Atharvavedic and Sāmavedic versions of R̥gvedic hymns there can be differences in wording and in grammatical forms. In these cases, with few if any exceptions, the R̥gvedic ver-sion of the hymn is the older, and the versions of the other Vedas are modifications.Up to the creation of the recensions of the R̥gveda and long afterward, the transmission of the R̥gveda was oral. At some point, however, the R̥gvedic schools did produce manuscripts of the text. It is difficult to say when this occurred, but the transmission of the text likely remained exclusively oral at least until around 1000 ce. The oldest manuscript in the collection of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute collection dates only to 1464; the Sampurnanand Sanskrit University in Varanasi has an older R̥gveda manuscript from the fourteenth century—thus a gap of considerably over two millennia between the fixation of the text and our earliest written evidence for it. Even when these activities did begin to occur, copying and preserving manuscripts never displaced memorization of the text as the primary means of transmission of the R̥gveda until quite modern times.C. indigenous CommentARiAl tRAditionWith regard to indigenous commentary, the situation of the R̥gveda differs mark-edly from that of standard Classical Sanskrit texts, in that there is no unbroken commentarial tradition that might preserve the understanding of the text by the authors and audience at the time of composition. Although we find implicit com-mentary on some parts of the R̥gveda already in later Vedic texts, it is clear that in many case this “commentary” is based more on adaptation, speculation, or fancy than on a direct transmission of the purport of the text, as when the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (XI.5.1) sketches a narrative background for the Purūravas and Urvaśī dialogue (R̥V X.95) that distorts or misunderstands crucial portions of the hymn.The first complete de facto commentary on the R̥gveda, dating probably from the late Vedic period, is Śākalya’s Padapāṭha mentioned above, which simply con-sists of an effectively linguistic analysis of the continuous text (the Saṃhitāpāṭha) of the R̥gveda into individual words (padas). Because of sandhi, an important and pervasive feature of the Sanskrit language whereby all words undergo significant phonological adjustment to adjacent words in context, the phonological restora-tion of the underlying pausal forms of words from the continuous reading is no mere mechanical operation, but presupposes a grammatical and semantic analysis of the text.The Nighaṇṭu is a collection of difficult Vedic words probably made likewise in the late Vedic period. The Nighaṇṭu and the commentary upon this collection by Yāska in his Nirukta provide early lexical and etymological approaches to the R̥gveda, though understanding “etymology” in a synchronic, rather than our cur-rent diachronic sense."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Introduction19Various indexes or anukramaṇīs to the R̥gveda, also mentioned above, were com-piled probably around the middle of the first millennium bce, attributed to Śaunaka; these were not fully preserved. A comprehensive index, the Sarvānukramaṇī, attrib-uted to Kātyāyana and dating perhaps to the mid-fourth century bce but drawing on the earlier indexes, provides, for each hymn, the poet, the god(s) to which it is addressed, and the meter(s) in which it is composed. The Br̥haddevatā, also attrib-uted to Śaunaka, is in essence also an anukramaṇī, specifically an index to the dei-ties of each hymn, but in expanded form, with a number of interesting narratives and legends interspersed in the dry sequential listing of hymns and their divinities.None of these ancient tools and treatments remotely approaches the standard type of commentary familiar for later Sanskrit texts. For this the R̥gveda had to wait until the medieval period. The most influential and lasting commentary on the text was made by Sāyaṇa in the fourteenth century ce in South India, although there were a number of pre-Sāyaṇa commentators, some of whose work survives in part. Sāyaṇa’s work essentially superseded these earlier works, and remains enormously important in both indigenous and Western interpretations of the text: Max Müller’s edition of the R̥gveda includes Sāyaṇa’s commentary, and Geldner’s translation, for example, owes much to Sāyaṇa. It should be remembered, however, that Sāyaṇa is temporally closer to our own age than to that of the R̥gveda, and he was writing in a very different geographical, political, and religious landscape from that of the R̥gveda. It is therefore more useful to read Sāyaṇa not as a direct conduit of the “true meaning” of the R̥gveda but as a scholar grappling with the same problems as modern interpreters, and bringing to bear all the intelligence and knowledge he can muster, just as we do.d. WesteRn sCholARshiP on the R̥gVedA And mAjoR ResouRCesBecause the transmission of the R̥gveda has preserved the text remarkably well, we have a trustworthy and uniform text of the R̥gveda. The published editions of the R̥gveda differ in their presentation of the text, not in the text itself. The landmark edition of the R̥gveda was that of Max Müller (1849–74), who published both the Saṃhitā and Padapāṭha text in devanāgarī script, together with Sāyaṇa’s commen-tary. Before the completion of Müller’s R̥gveda, in 1861–63 Theodor Aufrecht pub-lished the text in Roman transliteration, together with selected Padapāṭha analyses. A second edition, the standard edition of Aufrecht’s R̥gveda, appeared in 1877. The R̥gveda and Sāyaṇa’s commentary were published again under the editorship of N. S. Sontakke (1933–51), together with the Padapāṭha. Also noteworthy is the aforementioned publication of the metrically restored version of the R̥gveda text by Barend A. van Nooten and Gary B. Holland (1994).The uniformity and reliability of the text of the R̥gveda cannot be said of its translations, which vary considerably. The standard scholarly translation remains that of Karl Friedrich Geldner into German. This translation was published in full"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"The Rigveda20in 1951, but was complete in the 1920s and partially published in limited fashion then. Although it remains a remarkable philological accomplishment, whose worth we two translators have appreciated more and more over the years, it of course could not take account of the advances in Vedic scholarship over the last eighty years or so. Louis Renou (1955–69) was able to finish most of a French translation of the R̥gveda, in a series of thematic publications, under the general title Études ve﻿́diques et pāṇine﻿́ennes, organized by the divinity addressed rather than the order of the R̥gvedic text. But he left undone substantial parts, notably the Indra and Aśvin hymns, and the later publications are rather sketchy. T. Ya. Elizarenkova (1989–99) completed a Russian translation of the text. Currently in preparation is a new German translation of the R̥gveda under the direction of Michael Witzel and Toshifumi Gotō. The first volume of the Witzel-Gotō translation (2007), which cov-ers Maṇḍalas I and II, has appeared, with the second volume scheduled for 2013.Unfortunately, English has not been as well served as these other languages. Aside from anthologies, the English version that is in general use is R. T. H. Griffith’s translation, which was first published in four volumes between 1889 and 1892, then in a revised edition in 1896, and then yet again in another revised edition, this time by J. L. Shastri, in 1973. Griffith’s translation has been reprinted several times since 1973 and is available online (http://www.sacred- texts.com/hin/rigveda/index.htm). Sadly, this translation really does not deserve as many rebirths as it has had. Its phi-lology was already dated when it was published, and the English style of the transla-tion is cloying and almost unreadable. Now, well over a century later, it should have long since been superseded. There was at least one serious effort to do so. From the late 1940s until the early 1960s, H. D. Velankar steadily published English transla-tions of the R̥gveda, which were a decided improvement over Griffith’s work (for a list of his translations, see the Bibliography). These were published as independent volumes dedicated to books II, V, VII, and VIII of the R̥gveda and as collections of hymns to different deities published in the Journal of the University of Bombay. Partly because these translations are scattered, incomplete, and difficult of access, they have received less attention than they might otherwise have done. In addition to these complete or extensive translations of the R̥gveda, several anthologies of R̥gvedic hymns have appeared. In English, the most notable are those of Wendy Doniger O’Flaherty (1981) and Walter H. Maurer (1986). The principal problem with any such anthology is that translators understandably choose hymns that they think will be especially interesting for their readers and accessible to them. As a result, they tend to create a distorted view of the R̥gveda that does not reflect the liturgical functions and scope of the text.Both the partial and the complete translations just mentioned were fundamental for the present translation. In our introductions to individual hymns, we will often make reference to them, especially when they suggest interpretations of the text we deem particularly worthy of note. Rather than giving a fuller bibliographic refer-ence, we will refer to them only by the last names of the translators. The exceptions are Renou’s translations, for which we will give the relevant volume and page of his"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Introduction21Études ve﻿́diques et pāṇine﻿́enes, and Velankar’s translations, where again we will cite the specific source.In addition to these translations, there are a number of other essential resources for translating and interpreting the R̥gveda. Among the older works of particular significance are the Wörterbuch of Hermann Grassmann (1872–75), whose pre-sentation of the lexicon of the R̥gveda is somewhat antique but still very useful. Grassmann’s work has now been complemented and in some respects superseded by Alexander Lubotsky’s concordance to the R̥gveda (1997), which provides the verse-line context for R̥gvedic words. Among older works of significance, of par-ticular note is Hermann Oldenberg’s Noten (1909, 1912) on the complete text of the R̥gveda, whose insights remain remarkable even a century after they were pub-lished. Maurice Bloomfield’s Rig-veda Repetitions (1916) is an invaluable resource for the study of R̥gvedic formulaic language and its variations, though it predates the discovery of oral-formulaic composition.In the last fifty years or so, R̥gvedic scholarship has blossomed with studies that have significantly advanced our understanding of the language of the R̥gveda—its lexicon, morphology, and syntax—of its compositional techniques, and of its con-ceptual universe and ritual procedures and context. We cannot offer even a partial list of such books, let alone articles, since we would omit too many. We will mention only a few, those which were especially close at hand as we worked through the text and whose insights we have often adopted. Particularly important was Manfred Mayrhofer’s etymological dictionary of Old Indo-Aryan (E WA 1986–2001) and his previous version (KEWA 1951–76), not completely superseded by the newer one. Other works include Salvatore Scarlata’s study of nominal compounds ending in roots (1999) and Jared S. Klein’s studies of Vedic particles and discourse structure (1985). One of the subjects in which there has been substantial progress just in the last decades has been the Vedic verbal system. The flood of monographs on the ver-bal system probably began with Johanna Narten’s work on the s-aorist (1964), fol-lowed closely by Karl Hoffmann’s influential study of the injunctive (1967). Other verbal subsystems treated more recently include the -a﻿́ya-stems (Jamison 1983), the first-class presents (Gotō 1987), the intensive (Schaefer 1994), the perfect (Kümmel 2000), the desiderative (Heenen 2006), and the ya-presents (Kulikov 2012). All of these works, as well as many other and many shorter studies, have been of critical importance as we have worked our way through the text.Finally, we wish to note one last development not just in R̥gvedic but in Sanskrit scholarship more generally. Among older scholars there was a tendency to deal with difficulties in a text by emending it. By the beginning of the twentieth century, however, scholars increasingly recognized that they could gain a much better under-standing of the text by accepting the text as transmitted. This process is visible in Oldenberg’s scholarship. Before the Noten, Oldenberg published translations of the Agni hymns of the first five books of the R̥gveda (1897). There he was willing to suggest text emendations to smooth rough spots in the hymns. By the time of the Noten, however, he had become much more apt to accept the text as it stands and"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"The Rigveda22to explore ways of accounting for that transmitted text. We too are committed to accepting the traditional text and more importantly to allowing the poetry of the R̥gveda to remain complex, elusive, jagged, unsettled, and even unsettling.III. Power of the WordA. WoRds, tRuth, And KnoWledgeOne reason for the intricacy of R̥gvedic poetry and the careful thought that the R̥gvedic poets put into it is the importance that Vedic culture attached to the spo-ken word and to the truth that it embodied. The elegantly formulated truth, spoken in a ritual context, was powerful. The word for “truth” is r̥ta﻿́, a crucially resonant word that, with some reason, some other translators have rendered “order” or “cos-mic order.” The term r̥ta﻿́ essentially defines what a being or object is and what it does, and it structures the relationships of beings and objects with other beings and objects. By speaking these truths of essence and relationship, the poets could make the truths real and actual in the present. So, for example, the great Indra hymn, I.32, begins, “Now I shall proclaim the heroic deeds of Indra, those foremost deeds, which the mace-wielder performed. . . . ” Why does the poet proclaim these deeds? It is not simply to honor the god, although his proclamation surely does do that. It is also to state the truth of these heroic deeds, so that these deeds will become real once again. As Indra once before smashed Vr̥tra, who was the symbol and epitome of all obstacles, so once again he will smash obstacles. Formulating the “truth” of Indra is part of what makes Indra real and present. Similarly, the story of Indra and the Vala cave is essentially a story of the power of the truth. According to this myth, Indra and the Aṅgirases opened the Vala cave and released the cattle and the dawns by the songs they recited. These songs were powerful because they contained the truth that the cattle were the dawns, and therefore, by singing this truth Indra and the Aṅgirases obtained both cattle and dawns. In X.108 the poet narrates part of the story of Indra and Vala and then states his expectation that the truth of his song, which is the truth of the Vala story, will bring cattle back to him: “Exchanging with the truth, let the cows come up, which Br̥haspati [=Indra] found hidden. . . . ” Or again, in IX.113.2 the poet declares the soma is pressed “with real words of truth, with trust, and with fervor.” That is to say, it is not just the physical pressing of the soma plant that produces soma juice. Soma is also cre-ated by the intensity of the priests, by their confidence in the effectiveness of their actions, and by the truth they speak about the soma and about the power of the soma to strengthen the gods and to give life to mortals. Words, commitment, and ritual all combine to make the soma real.The product of the formulating of a truth, the verbal formulation itself, is the bra﻿́hman, and the poet who formulates truth is the brahma﻿́n. While the later ritual tradition will rely on ancient formulations of the truth passed down from the early"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Introduction23Vedic period, the contemporary religious system of the R̥gveda required ever-new formulations of the truth. These new formulations would attract the gods and make them present at the ritual, and these new formulations would make the truth they expressed newly real. For this reason the work of the poet was essential, for only poets could continue to produce these new formulations. The poet needed to be a master of many skills, but of all the skills he needed, the one that was most essen-tial was knowledge. The truths that the poets formulated were often hidden truths, founded on enigma and paradox. One such kind of truth was homological truth that connected objects across spheres, which will be discussed in the next section.The importance of knowledge for the Vedic poets is underscored by the variety of words for the poets’ thinking and its articulation in the hymns. The poets speak of their dhī́ or dhītí “insight” or “vision,” matí or ma﻿́nman “thought,” and manīṣā́ “inspired thinking.” The hymn and the understanding that gives rise to it are so closely related that the boundary between them becomes permeable, and the poets use words for thinking and knowing for the hymns themselves. In I.2.7, for example, the poet calls on Mitra and Varuṇa “who bring success to our ghee-covered insight (dhíyaṃ ghr̥tā́cīm),” that is, to the hymn that is accompanied by offerings of ghee, or again, in VI.8.1 the poet offers Agni Vaiśvānara a “newer thought” (matír na﻿́vyasī), which purifies itself (pavate) in the poet’s mind and emerges in his speech.B. homologyThe Vedic mental universe is structured, in great part, by a web of identifications or equivalences among elements in the ritual realm, in the cosmic realm, and in the realm of the everyday. These homologies play an enormous role in the thought of the Brāhmaṇas and Upaniṣads, where knowing the hidden connections between apparently disparate elements, particularly the equivalences between cosmic and ritual elements, gives the knower some power to control the cosmic by manipulation of the ritual. In these later Vedic texts, such types of equivalences have a technical name—bandhu “bond, connection” (a word of course cognate with English “bind,” etc.)—and the difference between the cosmic and the mundane system of equations is pervasive enough to be distinguished by technical terms: the cosmic level is called adhidaivam or adhidevatam, roughly “concerned with the divine,” while the mun-dane is called adhyātmam, roughly “concerned with the person(al).” These two sys-tems meet in and focus on the sacrifice, a controlled and orderly sphere of human activity, as a way of modeling the complex web of relationships that obtain in the two other realms, which are not under human control. The level of the sacrifice is called adhiyajñam “relating to the sacrifice.”Although the correspondences are not as systematically worked out and pre-sented in the R̥gveda as in those later texts, this way of thinking is just as pervasive in that text, though backgrounded: the poets assume that they share with their audience a web of associations, and this shared knowledge allows the poet to sub-stitute one element for another without overt signaling. Thus, for example, the first"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"The Rigveda24rays of light at dawn are homologized to cows, as in the Vala myth discussed above, and therefore the goddess Dawn is called “the mother of cows” and images of ruddy cows overrun the hymns to Dawn. Cows also have a ritual association: milk is mixed with the soma juice after it is pressed, and so the soma hymns are filled with depictions of the soma (as bull) running toward or mixing with “the cows,” that is, the milk. And cows are also homologized to waters, particularly the waters confined by Vr̥tra and released by Indra’s killing of that demon.Modern readers of the R̥gveda must try to internalize the many associations and identifications that formed the unconscious mental universe of the contemporary audience; otherwise almost every hymn in many of its parts will seem unintelligible or nonsensical. Other important homologies include that between the sun and the fire, especially the ritual fire, and, in general, the many associations between the various parts and procedures of the ritual and both cosmic and everyday elements. For example, the ritual itself, or the praise hymn specifically, is often identified with a chariot, and the crafting of poetry is homologized to chariot-making. Soma is often identified with a bull, but often otherwise with a horse, and the ritual prepara-tion of the soma is equated with the grooming of this horse. Or he is a bird settling into his nest or a king embarking on conquest. The ritual ground itself is often iden-tified with the cosmos, with the ritual fire a pillar connecting heaven and earth and any movement on the ritual ground implicitly compared to a vast journey across or around the cosmos. It is not possible here to list anything approaching all the important connections that underlie R̥gvedic poetry, though we will try to sketch many such associations in particular circumstances. But the reader must be alert to, and open to, this overall substitution principle, and also recognize that these homologies are not mere poetic embellishments, imagery for its own sake, but an implicit statement about the way things really are, the pervasive underlying connec-tions unifying apparently disparate elements.It is one of the poet’s main jobs to find and articulate these hidden connections, and the theme of “secret names” and their discovery is an important one in the R̥gveda. Indeed, one of the great deeds attributed to Indra (as Br̥haspati) and to the poet-singers, the Aṅgirases, divine counterparts of the human poet—the splitting of the Vala cave and the release of the cows imprisoned therein—turns in some versions on discovering the cows’ hidden names (e.g., IV.1.16, X.68.7). The training of a poet clearly involved both producing and solving quite recherche﻿́ associations, and the genre of riddle displays these skills to great advantage.C. the WoRdsmithsA number of different words are used to identify the workers in words, for which we use the cover term “poet.” These different terms often in fact have the same referent, sometimes in the very same passage, but emphasize different aspects of verbal craftsmanship. The most important terms are brahma﻿́n, kaví, ŕ̥ṣi, and vípra. Although it is not always possible to draw fine distinctions among these words, and"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Introduction25there remains considerable disagreement about their application (we two transla-tors, for example, are not entirely agreed on the function of the kaví ), the words do point to different types of relationships between the poet and his product and its source. As noted above, the brahma﻿́n is the “formulator,” who discerns and puts into words the hidden truths that undergird reality. His product is a bra﻿́hman, a “sacred formulation.” The term ŕ̥ṣi, generally rendered here as “seer,” is especially applied to the famous seers of the past, single or as a group, and to current poets who con-sciously aspire to the status of their predecessors, and like other words for verbal craftsmen, it is also regularly used of gods, especially Agni and Soma. The vípra, a derivative of the root √vip “tremble,” appears to be an “inspired poet” and contrasts with the kaví, the poet par excellence, but also the “sage poet,” endowed with the knowledge embodied in poetic skill (kā́vya). The original sense of the word kaví and the function of the person so named is disputed; it has well-attested Iranian cognates, starting with Avestan kauui, whose sense diverges from its Vedic corre-spondent. We two translators have discussed these issues in separate treatments (Brereton 2004; Jamison 2007: chap. 4).There are a few less well-attested terms, such as kārú here rendered “bard” or “praise-poet,” the transparent agent noun stota﻿́r “praiser,” as well as designations that seem more related to performance, such as jarita﻿́r “singer,” vāgha﻿́t “cantor” or “chanter,” rebha﻿́ “husky-/raspy-voiced (singer).”IV. RitualThere have been a variety of approaches to the R̥gveda, by both ancient and mod-ern scholars. Following the lead of the Br̥haddevatā, some interpreters have been concerned primarily with the myths and legends of the R̥gveda. Others have sought to understand the deities of the R̥gveda by exploring the meaning and derivation of their names. And as early as the later Vedic period, still others understood the R̥gvedic deities as the powers of the natural world or as symbols of microcosmic processes. But the R̥gveda is first of all a liturgical text. The great majority of its hymns were composed for rituals and, more specifically, for the soma rituals of their period. After the collection of the R̥gveda, its verses were adapted to the reci-tations and chants of the classical soma ritual and employed in a variety of other ritual contexts. Understanding the R̥gveda, therefore, first requires understanding the Vedic rituals and, above all, the soma ritual.A. model of the RituAlThe ritual as depicted both in the R̥gveda and in the later Vedic texts treating the classical śrauta system (and indeed the much later pūjā of classical Hinduism) is modeled as a hospitality ceremony and festive meal, offered to the visiting gods. The poets eagerly invite the gods to journey to attend the sacrifice. When they arrive,"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"The Rigveda26they are greeted and provided with seats near the center of the action, on a special grass strewn on the ritual ground to make the ground more comfortable. This grass strew is called barhís and it has an exact cognate in Avestan barziš “cushion, pillow.” In some hymns the horses pulling the gods’ chariots, particularly Indra’s two fallow bays, are unhitched and offered refreshment of their own. The gods are then offered a meal, that is, the oblations, generally consisting of ghee, little grain cakes, and, in the most important sacrifices, soma, and they are entertained while they eat, by the hymns of praise that constitute the R̥gvedic corpus. The end of this entertain-ment is often announced in the final verse of the hymn, and sometimes the gods are explicitly sent on their way back to heaven. Particularly nice examples of this envoi are found in I.61–63 and I.82, hymns designed to accompany the Hāriyojana or “Fallow-bay-yoking” oblation, the ritualized hitching up of Indra’s horses for the return journey; in I.82.5–6 Indra is charmingly urged to go home to his “dear wife.”The “ritual ground” alluded to above is the sacralized space within which the rit-ual proceeds. It is not a permanent space dedicated to ritual performance, much less a building or temple; rather, judging from the evidence of the later śrauta texts, it is demarcated and sacralized for each performance. The space is defined especially by the presence of three ritual fires, the focal point of the sacrifice and the recipient(s) of the oblations. In the later texts these are the Āhavanīya (the fire “to be offered into”) set to the east, the Gārhapatya (“householders’ fire”) to the west, from which the Āhavanīya is taken out and carried to the east, and the Dakṣiṇāgni (“southern fire”), and their locations and functions are precisely fixed. The R̥gveda does not attest these names for the fires, but it does often refer, though often obliquely, to the three fires of the ritual. Moreover, the god Agni and his physical representative, the offering fire, regularly receive the epithet puro﻿́hita “placed to the east/in front,” appropriate to the removal of the Āhavanīya fire from the western Gārhapatya and its movement to the east. (The third word in the R̥gveda is in fact puro﻿́hitam I.1.1.) The poets sometimes seem to treat this movement as a sacred mystery (e.g., III.31.1–3), a fact that may point to the three-fire model as a ritual innovation of the pre-R̥gvedic period. There is no parallel to it in Avestan ritual, which uses only a single fire.One aspect of the “entertainment of guests” model of Vedic sacrifice is the fear, constantly expressed, that the gods will choose to go to another party. The R̥gvedic sacrificers know that everyone in the larger sacrificial community follows much the same ritual calendar and therefore many competing sacrifices are taking place at the same time. The invitation to the gods often explicitly urges them to pass over other sacrifices and come to ours, and in order to make ours more attractive, we must provide the best hospitality, in particular the best entertainment in the form of exquisitely crafted and novel hymns.An important feature of the “guest” model is the fact that it envisions and requires direct interaction between gods and mortals, on the mortals’ turf—or rather on a space that has been rendered temporarily neutral through its sacral-ization—though it is on earth, the human realm, rather than in the gods’ world,"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Introduction27heaven. The interaction in turn requires epiphany in the technical sense: the gods must appear in person, as it were. The poets crave this epiphany and fear its failure to materialize. It is especially Indra whose epiphany they anticipate, and the fear that it may not happen also leads to the more general fear that Indra does not exist, a possibility that is often put in the mouth of doubtful “others.”There is another, more recessive model of sacrifice perceptible in the R̥gveda, especially in Agni hymns, whereby the offerings go to the gods in heaven, rather than requiring the gods to come to earth to receive them. The libations ascend on the smoke of the offering fire, an image conceptually close to the Homeric sacrifice. There seems to be no conflict in the minds of the R̥gvedic ritualists between these two models, and they are not exclusive to different groups of poets but can in fact occur in the same hymn; see, for example, the Agni hymn I.1, where the “guest” model dominates, with the gods’ travel to the sacrifice explicit in verses 2 and 5, but the oblation’s movement to the gods is alluded to in verse 4.B. BAsiC elements of the RituAlLater Vedic texts give detailed descriptions of the soma rituals, which varied in length and complexity. The problem for the interpretation of the R̥gveda is that these classical rites were clearly not the same as the rites of the R̥gvedic period itself. While the classical rites drew on R̥gvedic traditions, they did not simply con-tinue them. In the R̥gvedic period these rituals were probably much more variable, for even though their rituals were based on a shared inherited tradition, different priestly families performed the rites differently. For example, in the classical one-day soma rite, soma juice is pressed out of the soma plant and offered to various deities in the morning, at midday, and in the evening. But the third or evening pressing stands apart from the other two. While soma plants are freshly pressed in the morn-ing and at midday, in the evening the soma is extracted from the already-mangled soma stems left over from the earlier pressings. Not only the soma preparation but also the overall character of the Third Pressing is different. It has a greater focus on the sacrificer and his wife, the gods of the Third Pressing form a less coherent group than those of the other pressings, and in general, the rites of the Third Pressing have the appearance of an appendix. It is possible that some family traditions did not have a Third Pressing and that, among those that did, the form of the Third Pressing was more fluid. Or again, in the Midday Pressing of the classical soma ritual, there are offerings to Indra alone and to Indra along with the Maruts. This form may represent a compromise between family traditions that offered soma only to Indra at this second pressing and those that also included the Maruts.Variation in the rite also occurred over time. The R̥gvedic period itself extended through several generations of poets and priests, and the rites evolved during this period. In the classical soma ritual the sacrificer must be accompanied by his wife, who has her own ritual responsibilities (see Jamison 1996a). But in the R̥gveda, the wife of the sacrificer is very rarely alluded to and then almost exclusively in"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"The Rigveda28the younger parts of the text. Therefore the wife of the sacrificer may have been a late addition to the soma ritual, and indeed the R̥gveda even offers evidence that her introduction may have been controversial, with some ritualists defending and others rejecting her presence in the rite (see Jamison 2011, forthcoming a, and forth-coming b). Ultimately, those who wished to include the sacrificer’s wife won the day, for in the classical soma ritual her presence is required even if her ritual functions are limited.The consolidation of the ritual tradition and the creation of the classical forms of the soma rite probably occurred after 1000 bce, during the period in which the other saṃhitās were compiled. The innovations effected by this consolidation not only changed the form of the ritual, but also altered its very nature. Fundamental to the R̥gvedic rite was the need for poets to create new formulations of the truth in order to attract the attention of the gods, to make them present at the rite, and to define their action. But in the later Vedic period, not only did the ritual offer-ings become increasingly standardized, so also did the ritual recitations and chants. Novelty and innovation were no longer primary values, but instead were supplanted by the ability to remember the old compositions. The compilation of the R̥gveda reflects the need to preserve the poetry of the past in order to employ it within the ritual, for in the later Veda power resided not in the new formulation but in the ancient one. Or rather and more generally, power was understood as residing in the ritual performance as a whole and with the priests who carried out the rite. In later Vedic interpretation the ritual even came to exercise power over the gods themselves. The ritual became less an invitation to the gods and more a manipula-tion of them. One marker of this shift was the rise in the later Veda of Prajāpati, the Lord of Creatures. Prajāpati was the sacrifice itself, and his superiority to the other gods therefore symbolized the dominance of the sacrifice over the gods. Knowledge remained important: priests should understand the secrets of the rite that they per-formed. But the knowledge and skills of a poet did not have a place in the evolving ritual order.Given the fluidity of the rites during the R̥gvedic era, we cannot really speak of the R̥gvedic soma rite, even though there were certainly common characteristics of the soma rituals performed throughout the period. Moreover, given the changes that occurred after the R̥gvedic era, we cannot simply project the classical soma rites back into the R̥gveda. While many technical ritual terms and elements were passed down from the R̥gvedic period to the classical rites, these terms may not have had the same significance for the R̥gveda that they do for the classical tradi-tion. This is perhaps most obviously the case for the brahma﻿́n. In the later ritual the brahma﻿́n became the formal overseer of the ritual. In the R̥gveda he was rather the poet who formulates the truth (further see Brereton 2004).We have already noted that fire is at the center of the Vedic rites and that the three fires of the classical śrauta ritual model were likely present in the R̥gvedic ritual. It is clear that already in the R̥gveda the principal offerings were made into the fire, and the gods received them through this mediating force. It is no wonder,"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Introduction29then, that the first hymn of the R̥gveda is a hymn to Agni, the god of fire, since his appearance ritually marked the beginning of the sacrifice, nor that Agni is the recipient of more hymns than any god but Indra.Sacrifices were carried out by men performing a variety of priestly functions. In II.1.2 and II.5.1–8 Gr̥tsamada poets provide a list of seven priests, to which the Gr̥hapati “houselord,” who is the primary beneficiary of the rite, is added as an eighth. Although the correspondence is not precise, Oldenberg (1917: 385) com-pares this list to a list of eight priests in the Avesta and argues that it reflects an old tradition that was still alive in the R̥gveda. In II.1.2 these seven priests are the Hotar, Potar, Neṣṭar, Agnīdh, Adhvaryu, Praśāstar, and Brahman. As Minkowski (1991: 113) points out, these seven essentially correspond to the classical list of priests in the R̥tuyājas, the “sacrifices in turn” (which adds the Acchāvāka priest) and in the R̥tvigvaraṇa, the “choosing of priests,” and to the priests who recite at the Prasthitahomas, the “presented oblations.” It is likely, therefore, that the list of seven does rest on a well-established tradition.The Hotar was the principal priest, and the R̥gveda repeatedly mentions the “seven Hotars” (VIII.60.16; IX.10.7, 114.3; X.35.10, 61.1, 63.7) or the seven ho﻿́trāḥ “priestly functions” (X.17.11), by which it probably refers to the group of seven priests led by the Hotar. Although in the R̥gveda and in the later tradition, the Hotar is the priest who recites the hymns and is secondarily associated with the root √hū “call,” his name originally meant the “pourer” (derived from the root √hu “pour”), which indicates that his ancient function was both to pour the offerings and to recite. In the R̥gveda he was likely often the composer of the hymns he recited as well. He is the one priest who has an exact correspondent in the Avestan tradition, the Zaotar, who already in the Gāthās of Zarathustra also composed and recited hymns.On the basis of the likely analysis of his name, the Potar was the “purifier,” likely a purifier of the soma (cf. TB I.4.8), but his R̥gvedic function is unclear. In the clas-sical soma rite, the Neṣṭar, the “leader,” is associated with the wives of the gods and the wife of the sacrificer. Judging from passages like IV.9.4, in the R̥gveda he had a connection with the former, which may have expanded to the latter with the intro-duction of the sacrificer’s wife into the ritual. In the later tradition the Agnīdh or “fire-kindler” laid and tended the sacrificial fire, in addition to kindling it. He also acted as the primary assistant to the Adhvaryu, the “ceremoniant,” the priest prin-cipally in charge of the ritual acts of the sacrifice. According to II.5.4 the Praśāstar, “director,” is the priest who knows the “enduring commandments” (dhruvā́ vratā́ni) that govern the rite. He was likely the forerunner of the Maitrāvaruṇa priest of the later tradition, who gives the praiṣa or “command” for a particular ritual act to take place (Minkowski 1991: 118). And finally, there is the Brahman. According to Oldenberg (1917: 396), the Brahman in this list corresponded to the later Brāhmaṇācchaṃsin, an assistant to the Hotar who recited hymns in honor of Indra. Oldenberg may be right, but the Brahman in II.1.2 may have been the brahma﻿́n elsewhere in the R̥gveda, a composer and reciter of hymns. His liturgical functions"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"The Rigveda30were probably not so restricted as those of the Brāhmaṇācchaṃsin. Other passages contain partial lists of priests and mention priests who are not included among the seven of II.1.2, although for the most part their functions overlap those already described. One remarkable omission from the above lists of priests is a priestly title corresponding to the singers of the Sāmaveda. Nonetheless, there were singers at the R̥gvedic period, since especially those hymns composed in pragātha meters were likely chanted rather than recited. The Udgātar, later the principal priest of the Sāmavedic tradition, is mentioned as a singer of sāmans in II.34.2, and among those priests already mentioned the Potar may have chanted the Soma Pavamāna hymns of book IX. Also, it is possible that unlike the later tradition, in which singers were distinguished from reciters, R̥gvedic priests both chanted and recited according the requirements of the ritual.A number of other terms describe the ritual participants and priests and their functions in the rites. While the exact role of the R̥gvedic kaví continues to be debated, he was linked to the production of poetry and to the mastery of esoteric knowledge expressed in his words. Our usual translation of kaví as “sage poet” attempts to capture these two sides of him. Since it has an Avestan cognate kauui, the term is an old one, and both the roles of the kaví and the kauui undoubtedly went through many changes in their long histories. Originally, however, the kaví/kauui may have had specific ritual functions within the forerunners of the Avestan and Vedic rites. Those functions may have complemented those of another figure, the uśíj, a term that also has an Avestan cognate, usig. Although anciently the uśíj/usig may have been a specific priestly office, the R̥gveda uses the term uśíj to describe various priests who tend the ritual fire. To give the sense of uśíj as a technical term for such a category of priests, we have translated it as “fire-priest.” So then, likely reflecting a very ancient distribution of roles, the uśíj priests were masters of ritual action, while the kaví was the master of words and knowledge.Thus, like other aspects of the R̥gvedic rites, the R̥gvedic priesthood was not fixed. For the R̥gveda we can better understand the names of priests as describing priestly functions rather than naming professional ritual specialists. Thinking of them in this way helps us understand why hymns use different names or vary the names. In a period before the rise of the priestly śākhās, there was less need for priests to have a determined or single identity. The same people who acted as priests in the ritual could be warriors or perform other social roles in other contexts.C. somA RituAlAs we have frequently had occasion to remark, most of the hymns of the R̥gveda were composed for the soma ritual. The central rite of this sacrifice was the prepa-ration of the soma juice, which was then offered to the gods and shared among male participants in the rite. In the R̥gvedic period the stalks of the soma plant were probably placed on a stone and crushed using another stone or stones. The extracted juice was either transferred to a vessel that contained water and then"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Introduction31poured through or onto a woolen filter to purify it. In either case the soma then ran into another vessel, in which it was mixed with milk. In the Agniṣṭoma of the classi-cal tradition, there are three soma-pressings in a single day, although, as remarked above, this may not have been true for the whole R̥gvedic period or for all ritual traditions during the R̥gvedic period. The R̥gveda also knows the Atirātra or “over-night” form of the soma ritual, in which there are still three pressings on one day, but in which the rite continues across the night. The final offerings of the Atirātra are then made on the morning of the second day.One of the perennial problems in R̥gvedic and Avestan studies has been the iden-tity of the soma plant or its Iranian equivalent, the haoma plant. In the R̥gveda the effect of soma juice on both humans and gods is described by the verbal root √mad, roughly “exhilarate” or “elate.” By these translations we mean that the soma juice invigorated those who drank it and heightened their senses in some fashion. We could be more precise about the effect of soma if we knew from what plant it was extracted. Early speculation that the soma juice was an alcoholic drink of some sort clearly missed the mark, since the preparation of soma does not allow for fermentation and √mad does not mean “intoxicate,” if that implies drunken-ness and not transport. Of the substantial number of possibilities proposed in more recent times, two have dominated the discussion. (For a review of the various theories, at least of the time of its writing, see Houben 2003.) The first is that the soma plant was a stimulant, and the most frequent candidate for that stimulant is one or another kind of ephedra. Although not original to him and defended by other scholars, the interpretation of soma as ephedra was argued with particu-lar plausibility by Harry Falk (1989), largely on the basis of internal evidence in the R̥gveda. Also in favor of this hypothesis are the use of ephedra in Zoroastrian ritual even in modern times and the discovery of traces of ephedra at various sites of the ancient Bactrian-Margiana Archaeological Complex, a culture with appar-ent connections with Indo-Iranian culture. Neither of these discoveries confirms the ephedra hypothesis, and there have been and continue to be many critics of it. Another set of proposals envisions the soma as a hallucinogen. This argument was most famously put forth by Wasson (1968), who identified the soma plant as the Amanita muscaria, the fly agaric mushroom. Similarly Flattery and Schwartz (1989) argued that previous attempts to identify the soma/haoma plant had overvalued the Vedic evidence and undervalued the Iranian. On the basis of the latter evidence, their candidate for the soma plant was Peganum harmala, mountain rue, which also has psychoactive properties. Despite Flattery and Schwartz’s admonitions, recent defenders of the view that soma was a hallucinogen have continued to focus on the internal evidence of the R̥gveda. For them √mad implies not so much stimulation as ecstasy or visionary experience. Stuhrman (2006), for example, cites the hymns’ light imagery and the unexpected associations made by the poets to argue that these are best explained as reflexes of hallucinogenic experience.This is not an issue that we can resolve, and we would leave it aside if we could. But the identification of soma affects the interpretation of some hymns and"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"The Rigveda32particularly the translation of the various forms of the root √mad. In general, we find more textual evidence to support the interpretation of the soma juice as a stimulant than as a hallucinogen. Neither the imagery of the poems nor the vision of the poets requires a hallucinogen to explain them. Our view of the hymns is that they are careful, often intricate compositions that attest to the skill and imagination of the poets. There is no need to assume the poets experienced the effects of a hal-lucinogen, and some reason not to do so. To explain what is bizarre and obscure in these hymns by pharmacology can inhibit the effort to see the underlying logic and intention of the hymns. While there is much that remains obscure in the R̥gveda, interpreters of the text have been able to make progress by the simple assump-tion that the hymns do make sense and that the poets did know exactly what they were doing.d. otheR RituAlsIn describing Vedic ritual we have thus far been discussing the soma sacrifice. But while the soma sacrifice dominates the R̥gveda, the collection includes hymns com-posed for other rites as well. One of the sub-rites of the classical soma ritual is the Pravargya, which according to most ritual sūtras is performed twice daily on the three days leading up to the soma-pressing day. At an earlier stage, likely repre-sented by the R̥gveda, the Pravargya was an independent rite, which was only later incorporated into the soma tradition. Although the Pravargya is not mentioned by name in R̥gveda, the text refers to the rite at the center of the Pravargya, an offering to the Aśvins of gharma﻿́, a mixture of hot milk and ghee, and the underlying verbal lexeme pra﻿́ √vr̥j is used in ritual context.A number of other hymns, especially in book X, also refer to a Rājasūya, a royal consecration rite, and other rites defining and affirming royal sovereignty. The cen-tral rite in the classical Rājasūya was the royal unction, in which water was poured on the king. This water conferred on the king royal power and authority. Again, the unction rite itself is not mentioned, but the symbolism of water as a substance that confers power on the king and over which a successful king must exercise power is very much part of the R̥gvedic tradition. While R̥gvedic kingship may have differed significantly from later kingship, other classical symbols of kingship also appear in the R̥gveda, such as the association of the king and the sun (cf. X.121) and the identification of king with Varuṇa and Indra, who represent two kinds of sover-eignty (cf. IV.42).The animal sacrifice, either as an independent rite or as a part of the soma sacri-fice, is not very prominent in the R̥gveda and is generally alluded to by its parapher-nalia, actions, and verbal accompaniment rather than treated directly. The most salient piece of equipment is the yūpa, the post to which the sacrificial animal is tied. The yūpa is celebrated in a single hymn, III.8, which is actually a composite of two parallel hymns, one appropriate to a single post for a single sacrificial animal,"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Introduction33one to multiple posts for several victims. The hymn concerns only the preparation of the posts; there is no mention of the sacrificial victim(s).One of the most dramatic actions in the later animal sacrifice is the threefold circumambulation of the victim by a priest, the Āgnīdhra, carrying a firebrand. When in some R̥gvedic hymns the ritual Agni is said to “go around,” the refer-ence seems to be to this circumambulation—though again the victim is mentioned barely or not at all (see esp. IX.92.6, 97.1, where soma’s circling of the filter is com-pared to the Hotar’s circling of “the fixed seats provided with [sacrificial] beasts”; see also I.173.3, VII.18.22, X.22.14). Elsewhere (VI.1.3, V.43.7) the first and most highly prized part of the sacrificial beast to be ritually offered in later śrauta ritual, the omentum, is alluded to, again without direct mention of the sacrificing of the animal.The most significant representation of the animal sacrifice in the R̥gveda, albeit again indirect, is found in the litanies known as the Āprī hymns. In the later ritual the Āprī litany accompanied the fore-offerings of the animal sacrifice. The R̥gveda contains ten such hymns; in them a set series of subjects or key words—ritual per-sonnel (e.g., Tvaṣṭar), qualities (e.g., “well kindled”), or equipment (e.g., ritual grass)—are treated in a fixed order, though with variable wording, generally in eleven or twelve verses. One of the pieces of equipment is the yūpa, the wooden post mentioned above, though under the epithet “Lord of the Forest” (=tree). But the actual sacrifice of an animal is never mentioned in these hymns; at best the victim is delicately referred to as an oblation.There is also indirect reference to the animal sacrifice in mythological allusion to the Śunaḥśepa story, in which the young brahmin boy so named is almost offered up as a sacrifice to the gods, though he is rescued at the last minute. Although the story is best known from the very full narrative in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa (VII.13–18), his dramatic release is alluded to in the R̥gveda quite explicitly (see esp. V.2.7, also I.24.12–13).Perhaps the most extravagant and dramatic ritual in the classical śrauta system is the great royal sacrifice, the Aśvamedha or Horse Sacrifice, to be performed by a king to consolidate or display his power. It involves letting a stallion roam at will for a year, accompanied by armed troops who fight the sovereigns of any territory into which the horse strays. When the horse returns at the end of the year, it is sacrificed, along with numerous other victims, with due pomp but also with almost unimaginably outlandish accompanying actions. At the climax of the ritual the chief wife of the king has sex (or simulated sex) with the just-slaughtered horse on the ritual ground, while the other queens and their female attendants circle around, singing and dancing and trading obscene jokes with the officiating priests. Two late R̥gvedic hymns (I.162–163) directly treat the Horse Sacrifice, although the later sexual extravaganza is either unknown to them or, more likely, delicately omitted from discussion. The first (I.162) describes the (literally) gory details of the sacrifice itself, while commending the sacrificed horse and all its gear to the gods, while the second (I.163) lavishly lauds the horse and identifies it with the sun on its journey"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"The Rigveda34to the gods. Moreover, if we are correct in our interpretation of X.86, the famous salacious three-way conversation among Indra, his wife Indrāṇī, and Indra’s pal, the monkey Vr̥ṣākapi, this hymn is a burlesque or parody (though a serious one) of the Horse Sacrifice, with the monkey standing in for the horse-victim, Indrāṇī for the wife who must mate with the animal victim, and Indra for the king and sacri-ficer who stands by and watches this mating. This interpretation presupposes that the dramatic sexual aspect of the Aśvamedha was already present in the R̥gvedic version of the rite and is simply not mentioned in I.162–163.In addition to the rituals that will be codified in the later classical śrauta system, the R̥gveda marginally treats rituals that will form part of the gr̥hya, or “domestic,” ritual system, primarily life-cycle rites. The R̥gvedic treatments are almost exclu-sively found in late portions of the text, in Maṇḍala X, and often have parallels in the Atharvaveda. The funeral is treated in a series of hymns (X.14–18) in the Yama cycle. Of particular interest are X.16, which concerns the cremation fire and the actual burning of the dead man’s body, and X.18, which describes the funeral service, the burial, and the return of those still living to their lives. Verses 7–9 of X.18 have attracted special attention because they appear to depict the widow of the dead man, first lying beside the dead man and then being recalled to life and to remarriage—thus suggesting that while the later institution of satī or widow burn-ing is not attested in the R̥gveda, the ritual representation of the widow’s ceremo-nial death (though followed by ceremonial rebirth) could have provided a model for a more literal enactment. Many of the verses in this group of hymns are found also in the Atharvaveda funeral hymns, XVIII.1–4. Another hymn, X.56, describes the ascent of the body of the deceased by means of the cremation fire and its transfor-mation into an immortal body in heaven (see Brereton forthcoming a).A long and episodic hymn, X.85, is devoted to the wedding. Many of its verses are found also in the Atharvaveda wedding hymns and are utilized in the gr̥hya sūtra protocols for the wedding ceremony. After a long mythological prologue, the hymn proceeds (sometimes in jumbled fashion) from the wooing of the bride-to-be to the journey of the newly married couple to the new home, with a very interesting (and barely comprehensible) treatment of the deflowering of the bride.The R̥gveda also provides a certain amount of evidence for the institution of the Svayaṃvara or bridal “self-choice” marriage, familiar to anyone who has ever stud-ied first-year Sanskrit and read the Mahābhārata story of Nala and Damayantī, whose engagement took that form. Most of the R̥gvedic evidence is mythological, as the archetypal divine bride in the text is Sūryā, daughter of the sun, who exer-cises her choice (see especially Jamison 2001), but there is also lexical evidence (see Jamison 2003) as well as incidental imagery, especially in Dawn hymns, of young girls in such a situation.Pregnancy and birth, a major preoccupation in the later gr̥hya material, is barely represented in the R̥gveda. There is a charm for safe childbirth (X.184), which fol-lows immediately on a brief dialogue between husband and wife attempting to con-ceive (X.183), and in a short series of hymns against disease we find one against the"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Introduction35dangers of miscarriage (X.162). Maṇḍala V also contains a charm for safe child-birth embedded in an Aśvin hymn (V.78.7–10) and motivated by the mythological case of (the male seers) Atri and Saptavadhri, trapped in tight quarters like a child in the womb.V. The GodsA. nAtuRe of the godsThe great majority of R̥gvedic hymns are dedicated to individual gods or to groups of gods. Following a classification articulated already in I.139.11, Yāska (Nir. VII.5) divided the gods into three categories: gods of the earth, gods of the mid-space, and gods of heaven. This simple scheme has the advantage of being clear and the disadvantage of being misleading. For while the R̥gvedic pantheon includes deities who represent the visible realities and powers of the natural world, it is not fully composed of such gods. A better starting place for most of the gods is their names. As we shall see, the R̥gveda attaches great importance to the names of gods. By invoking, varying, and meaningfully placing gods’ names in their verses and by echoing the sounds of those names, the poets bring about the presence of the gods, their epiphany. More than in any other single feature, the essential nature of a deity is expressed in the god’s name. The god is who the god is because the god obeys the truth embedded in that name. Thus the goddess Dawn is the Dawn because she adheres to the truth that she appears in the morning before the sun. The god Parjanya, Thunderstorm, is the Thunderstorm because he adheres to the truth that he sends the rain. To be sure, the meanings of the names of some gods, such as Viṣṇu, the Nāsatyas, or the Maruts, are unclear or controversial, and the names of other gods, such as the Aśvins (“Horsemen”), imperfectly represent their charac-ters. By and large, however, the names of gods define their natures and actions. This is one reason that the gods of the R̥gveda can appear to be flat, since they generally lack the complex personalities that the gods of classical India possess. But there is considerable complexity in the relations among R̥gvedic deities, in the fusion and fission of deities, and in the dimensions of gods indicated by different names and epithets.Starting with their names, we can classify gods according to their different spheres of action. This categorization will be porous, since some gods cross bound-aries of domains and functions, and will be more orderly than R̥gvedic reality, but it gives an approximate shape to the R̥gvedic pantheon. There are at least five cat-egories of divinities. First there are gods of nature, the powers that represent and govern natural phenomena and entities, such as Sūrya, the “Sun,” Vāyu “Wind,” Parjanya “Thunderstorm,” Uṣas “Dawn,” and Dyaus and Pr̥thivī “Heaven and Earth.” With some exceptions, the names of these deities are also words for the phenomena they represent. So, for example, the word sū́rya can signify either the"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"The Rigveda36sun god or the sun itself, or, rather, it signifies both the sun god and the sun, since the two are not fully distinguished. However, these gods of nature do not act only within the natural sphere defined by their names, but enlarge their sphere of action on the basis of their natural characteristics. In I.115.1, for example, the Sun is called “the eye of Mitra, Varuṇa, and Agni,” because the Sun, as he transits the sky, looks down upon the actions of human beings and observes whether they conform to the ritual and social principles governed by these other deities. In V.80.5 the light brought by the goddess Dawn disperses not only the physical darkness of night but also the “powers of darkness,” the dangerous forces at work within the world. And according to V.83.9 the god Parjanya, Thunderstorm, not only shakes the world, but also smashes evildoers. Thus the principle of hidden connections and corre-spondences allows the gods of nature operate in other spheres in manners analo-gous to their natural functions.A second category of divinity includes those defined by the social sphere in which they operate. The most prominent deities in this category are the three principal Ādityas: Mitra, Varuṇa, and Aryaman. As detailed below, these gods represent the different principles that define social relations, and they ensure that human beings act according to these principles. As the gods of nature have functions within the social world, so these gods of the social world also have functions within the natu-ral world. They are associated with the sun, as illustrated by I.115.1, and Varuṇa especially governs the waters, granting them to those who uphold the principles he represents, withholding them from those who do not. In this way, the processes of the visible world become the assurance of the reality of the principles of the social world.Still other gods are defined by an action or function that their names embody. Perhaps the most obvious example is Savitar, the “Impeller,” who compels humans and other living beings to action or sends them to rest. Similarly, there is Tvaṣṭar, the “Fashioner,” Viśvakarman, the “All-Maker,” and various other minor “agent gods” as Macdonell (1897: 115) called them. Perhaps fitting into this category, albeit awkwardly, are the Aśvins, the “Horsemen.” As the name of these two gods suggests, they characteristically drive their chariot, and their mobility is a signifi-cant part of what defines them. They ride to accomplish many purposes: to heal, to rescue, or even to facilitate marriage. As charioteers and riders, therefore, they move within a variety of places and spheres.Fourth are gods who embody aspects of the ritual, a category dominated by the two gods who, except for Indra, are the most frequently invoked deities of the R̥gveda, Agni and Soma. Agni is the sacrificial fire and Soma the central offering at the principal sacrifice in the R̥gvedic tradition. The particular significance of the ritual gods is their accessibility to humans. Various gods can be present at the sacrifice, but Indra and other gods like Mitra and Varuṇa remain invisible. Gods like the Wind, the Dawn, or the Sun are perceptible, but they are distant or amorphous. Agni and Soma, however, are visibly, tangibly present, right in front of the priests and sacrificers, and their presence can be reliably brought"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Introduction37about by human action. They are the representives of the divine within reach of humans, and therefore they can create the link between gods and humans upon which the life of both gods and humans depends. So, Agni is the messenger who conveys the gods to mortals (e.g., I.14.12, III.6.9, IV.8.2, VII.11.5), and he is the Hotar priest who brings humans’ offerings to the gods (e.g., I.1.1, VIII.60.1, X.7.5). And likewise, Soma descends from heaven to the human world (IX.61.10, 63.27, 66.30) and, when offered by humans, goes from these humans to the gods (IX.25.4, 39.1).The last category belongs to Indra, who stands apart from all the other gods. Although it might once have had other resonance, the word índra means only Indra, which makes it not quite unique but a still rarity among the names of gods. The greatest number of hymns, nearly a quarter of all the hymns of the R̥gveda, are dedicated to him. This preeminence in the R̥gveda is not surprising since the soma sacrifice is primarily a sacrifice to Indra. Indra and Vāyu are the first of the paired divinities who receive soma in the morning; Indra alone or with the Maruts receives soma at midday; and, at least according to some R̥gvedic traditions, Indra and the R̥bhus receive soma in the evening (cf. IV.35.7). Thus, even though the soma sacri-fice gradually incorporated other rites and other gods, Indra and the offerings to Indra remained central to it.B. deVAs And AsuRAsBeginning with the Vedic prose texts, one of the most enduring mythological struc-tures is the perpetual conflict between Devas (deva﻿́ being the Sanskrit word for “god”) and Asuras, with the two (almost) balanced groups contending with each other in numerous myths and myth fragments in all sorts of situations. The Asuras are, as it were, the anti-Devas, with negative traits exactly corresponding to the posi-tive ones possessed by the Devas. In the various combats depicted, the Devas always prevail, but only barely. This conflict continues to be prominent in the post-Vedic religious landscape, as in the well-known story of the churning of the ocean of milk in which the two moieties fight over the treasures churned up.An apparent mirror image of this paired opposition is found in Old Iranian in the Avestan texts, where ahura, the direct cognate of Sanskrit a﻿́sura, is the title of the head of the pantheon, Ahura Mazdā “Lord Wisdom,” and the daēuuas (exact cognate of Sanskrit deva﻿́) are the enemies of all that is good. Although it has always been tempting to superimpose the Avestan and middle Vedic situations upon each other, the R̥gveda makes serious difficulties. There the term a﻿́sura is generally in the singular, used as a title (“lord”) in a positive sense, and is often applied to divini-ties who are otherwise identified as Devas. A particularly striking example is found in VIII.25.4 where Mitra and Varuṇa are called Devas and Asuras simultaneously (devā́v a﻿́surā “[the two] Devas, [the two] Asuras”). The Asuras as a defined group only begin to appear in the late R̥gveda. For further discussion see Hale (1986). The"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"The Rigveda38history and significance of the Avestan/post-R̥gvedic mirror-image pairing of the two terms remain unclear.C. ViśVe deVĀḤThe term víśve devā́ḥ “all the gods” or “the All Gods” is common in the R̥gveda, and the Anukramaṇī identifies the divinity of a large number of hymns as víśve devā́ḥ. The term, both in its usage in the text and in its application to a hymn type, is employed in a number of different senses. On the one hand, it is a handy way to refer to the whole divine community, to ensure that no god has been left out of a generic eulogy or request for aid. In this usage the gods are not treated as individu-als but as an undifferentiated group, opposed to mortals or, later, the Asuras (see just above). This group ultimately becomes conceived of as a sort of corporate entity, the All Gods. On the other hand, many Viśve Devāḥ hymns do not encom-pass the whole group, but name a series of individual gods, each one often allotted a single verse in a list hymn (e.g., VI.49). Here the phrase “all the gods” is a way of indicating that the hymn is not targeting a single god, as in the majority or R̥gvedic hymns, but selecting from the group. And finally a number of hymns with the Anukramaṇī designation “all gods” actually have very little to do with the gods at all, but contain meditations on the mysteries of the cosmos, of the sacrifice, or of the powers of poetry and ritual speech (see, e.g., I.105).d. indRAAs the preeminent god of the R̥gveda, Indra has a variety of roles. But first of all Indra is a warrior, upon whom depend the protection and prosperity of his worshipers. His weapon is the va﻿́jra, the mace. In later tradition, when Indra was reduced to a storm god, the vajra became a thunderbolt. But in the R̥gveda it was a weapon, which could be thrown at an enemy or smashed down upon him, and the principal means by which Indra asserted his power.The foremost story of Indra in the R̥gveda is the narrative of the battle between Indra and Vr̥tra. Vr̥tra was a gigantic cobra, who was twisted around a mountain that enclosed the waters. In order for life to exist Vr̥tra had to be destroyed. Indra battled the serpent, alone, according to some hymns, or with the help of the Maruts or other gods, according to others. After a furious battle Indra killed Vr̥tra with his mace and smashed open the mountain, releasing the waters. This myth is occasion-ally merged with others, so that not only the waters but also the cattle and the sun emerge from the mountain. The name Vr̥tra means “obstacle,” and one of the char-acteristic epithets of Indra is vr̥traha﻿́n, which can mean either “smasher of Vr̥tra” or “smasher of obstacles.” There is little difference between these two interpreta-tions, however, since Vr̥tra is the paradigm of all obstacles. To evoke Indra as the smasher of Vr̥tra, therefore, is to evoke him as the god who smashes all obstacles."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Introduction39The narrative of the destruction of Vr̥tra is associated particularly with the midday soma-pressing, which is dedicated to Indra alone or to Indra and the Maruts.The Vala myth is the second great narrative of Indra and a complement to the Vr̥tra story. According to this myth a group called the Paṇis captured the cattle and kept them trapped in the Vala cave. Indra opened the Vala cave and released the cattle and the dawns. Remarkable in this story is that Indra does not release the cattle using his mace as his weapon, but rather using the power of the truth in the songs he chants. Accompanying him and joining him in his chant are groups of priests, the Aṅgirases, sometimes along with the Navagvas or the Daśagvas. In this narrative, therefore, Indra is a priest-king rather than a warrior-king as he is in the Vr̥tra myth. In his role as priest-king Indra is also called bŕ̥haspa﻿́ti, the “lord of the sacred formulation.” Br̥haspati appears not only as Indra, but also as a separate divinity alongside Indra. Gradually, as Indra and the Vedic king, who personifies Indra, progressively lose their priestly functions in the late R̥gveda and in the later Vedic tradition, Br̥haspati increasingly stands apart from Indra. As the Vr̥tra story is connected with the Midday Pressing, so the Vala story was associated with the Morning Pressing, which takes place with the appearance of dawn. In the R̥gvedic period the dakṣiṇā, the reward of cattle to the priests, was also given at the Morning Pressing. The cattle that come to the priests thus reflect the advent of the cattle and dawns in the world.Although the two major mythological narratives with Indra as protagonist are the Vr̥tra and the Vala victories, he figures in many other episodes—too many to mention here—which are often fragmentarily attested and poorly understood.We may start with his parentage. Although the identity of Indra’s mother is not clear, in the occasional mentions of her she is a vivid character—as in the snatches of dialogue between him and his mother in the famous birth hymn IV.18, where she tries to persuade him not to pursue an unnatural exit from her womb. Elsewhere she offers him soma to drink directly after his birth, soma that he stole from his father, named as Tvaṣṭar (III.48; also IV.18.3). And in an even more enigmatic snatch of dialogue (VIII.45.4–6 ≅ VIII.77.1–2) she seems to reassure the just-born Indra that he will ultimately prevail. As just noted, Indra seems to participate in a rivalry with his father, who may be Tvaṣṭar. The unnatural birth and the rivalry with the divine father are of course well-nigh universal attributes of “the hero”; the many prodigious feats attributed to Indra just after his birth are also typical of heroic biography.Two minor but intriguing myths pit Indra against the two most important forms of celestial light, the Sun and Dawn. We find the merest allusions (primarily IV.30.8–11) to a puzzling episode in which Indra crushes the cart of Dawn and she runs away. Alluded to just a bit more (primarily V.29.5, 9–10; V.31.11; I.121.13) is the chariot race in which Indra bests the chariot of the Sun, apparently by tearing the wheel off his chariot. This latter myth is somehow connected with one that is better attested, though hardly better understood, in which Indra and a sidekick Kutsa drive on the same chariot, drawn by the horses of the Wind, to the house"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"The Rigveda40of Uśanā Kāvya (a name with a shadowy attestation also in Avestan mythology), to receive some aid or advice, preliminary to slaying Śuṣṇa, the often-mentioned opponent of Kutsa.Indra has a number of other named adversaries. In one striking whiff of a narra-tive, Indra, aided by Viṣṇu in some versions, shoots a boar named Emuṣa, enabling him to acquire a special mess of rice porridge hidden in or behind a mountain (see esp. VIII.77; also VIII.69.14–15, I.61.7). This myth is further developed in Vedic prose. Another myth with more presence in later texts involves Indra’s slaying of Namuci by beheading him (e.g., V.30.7–8). In the later versions Indra accomplishes this by trickery, and part of the trick (using the foam of the waters as weapon) is already mentioned once in the R̥gveda (VIII.14.13). The names of other victims of Indra include Śambara, Pipru, Dhuni and Cumuri, and Varcin, inter alia. The details of these battles are too sketchy to provide much in the way of narrative mythology.Like a number of other gods, Indra has his characteristic draft-animals, and his are especially prominently featured in the text. His pair of fallow bays (ha﻿́rī) conveys him everywhere, especially to and from the sacrifice. They have their own food offered to them at the sacrifice (roasted grain, see, e.g., III.35), and hymns were even devoted to a libation made when the pair was hitched up for the return journey after the sacrifice (see I.61–63). The mention of the fallow bays is sufficient to signal that Indra is present in the context, and ha﻿́rivant “possessing the fallow bays” is a standing epithet of Indra.e. Agni “fiRe”The word agní is both the common noun meaning “fire” and the name of the god who is deified fire. As with so﻿́ma (see below), it is often difficult to draw the line between these uses. The sacrificial system of the R̥gveda (and later Vedic texts), like that of the cognate Old Iranian Avestan texts, is focused around the ritual fire. The sacrificial ground is defined by the presence of sanctified fire(s), oblations are made into them, and the gods and priests gather round them. Thus, first and foremost, Agni is the god always present at our ritual performances and the immediate recipi-ent of our offerings. He is the most prominent of the R̥gvedic gods after Indra, and all the Family Books and most of the smaller bardic collections open with their Agni hymns.Agni as ritual fire is both recipient of oblations in his own right and the conduit of oblations destined for other gods, which are offered into the ritual fire. He is therefore regularly called the mouth of the gods, and his role as the middleman between the human offerers and divine recipients is often emphasized. The flames and especially the smoke of the fire carry the oblations to heaven, but also, perhaps more often, serve as a means for the gods to come to earth to our sacrifice: Agni is said to be the conveyor of the gods many, many times in the text. He is a middleman in another sense, as a god who nonetheless dwells intimately among mortals. For us"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Introduction41he is both ally and messenger to the more distant gods, and since he is not one of us but a divinity, he is viewed as and often called our guest.But the ritual fire is not the only form of Agni. The poets emphasize both the divine aspects of Agni and his purely physical form, often intermingling references to different forms of fire in the same hymn. As a god he is often identified with the sun, the celestial form of fire: blazing hot, shining bright, and appearing at the same time of day, namely dawn when the sun rises and the ritual fire is kindled. But the fire on our sacrificial ground is also clearly kin to the fire on our domestic hearth; indeed in later śrauta ritual the fire from which the other ritual fires are taken out is called the Gārhapatya or “householders’ (fire).” Agni is therefore also praised for his contribution to daily life and the pleasures of home and family.The potentially destructive aspects of fire are not forgotten, however. Many of the most inventive descriptions in Agni hymns are of the wild, uncontrollable ram-pages of forest fire, spreading across the land and “eating” everything in its path. We seek to harness this destructive power of fire, to turn it against our enemies and other threats to our safety, and Agni, sometimes with the epithet rakṣoha﻿́n “demon-smasher,” is urged to turn his relentless flames against opponents we name. A subtype of destructive fire is the funeral fire, the “flesh-eating” fire of cremation, which is both welcomed and feared (see esp. X.16).The paradoxical nature of physical fire also provides some part of the god Agni’s personal qualities. That fire is fueled by plants, especially wood, contributes to the belief that Agni lives concealed within the plants, even very juicy ones, until his birth. Agni also comes to be identified with a minor divinity going back to Indo-Iranian times, Apām Napāt “child of the waters,” who was probably origi-nally separate—a glowing fiery being concealed and nurtured in the waters, prob-ably configured in part as lightning.The creation or birth of the ritual fire from the kindling sticks, his parents, is a major subject in Agni hymns, with intricate descriptions of the first stirrings of flame and smoke as the friction of the kindling sticks produces sparks that finally catch. The just-born Agni is depicted as a tender babe, who quickly grows to become stronger than his parents and to devour the plants from which he was born.Many aspects of Agni are expressed through the variety of names and epithets applied to him. Agni is Jātavedas as the fire established at the beginning of the rite that continues to its end. As an unbroken presence in the ritual, Agni Jātavedas also oversees the succession of generations, ensuring that a family’s lineage will continue. Agni Vaiśvānara is the fire become the sun. As the sun, this fire sees every-thing and governs everyone. This form of Agni is especially associated with the king, who like the sun stands above and reaches all beings. The word vaiśvānara﻿́ means the one “relating to all men.” Agni is also Tanūnapāt and Narāśaṃsa. One or another of these names—or sometimes both (I.13.2–3)—appear in the Āprī hymns, which are recited in an animal sacrifice, and they both occur outside of the Āprī hymns as well. The word ta﻿́nūna﻿́pāt describes Agni as the “son of himself,” and na﻿́rāśa﻿́ṃsa as the one “who embodies men’s praise” of the gods. As Agni Kravyād,"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"The Rigveda42the “flesh-eating fire,” Agni is the fire of the funeral pyre that consumes the body of the deceased and transports it to heaven. Mātariśvan is sometimes identified as Agni himself, but he is more properly the one who brought the fire from heaven.Agni participates in almost no narrative mythology, in strong contrast to Indra. Besides the very sketchy account of Mātariśvan’s theft of fire from heaven, there is one, ritually connected, tale—of Agni’s flight from the sacrificial ground and his self-concealment in the waters, to avoid his ritual role as bearer of oblations to the gods. The gods find him in his hiding place and coax him back by promising him a share of the oblations. This myth is treated most fully in the late sequence X.51–53, but there are glancing mentions of it elsewhere. The story may have in part been generated by the conflation of Agni with the originally distinct divine figure Apām Napāt “Child of the Waters,” on which see II.35.f. so mALike Agni, Soma is both a god and a crucial ritual substance, and the boundary between them is not always clear. As has already been discussed, the juice of the soma plant (whatever that may have been), pressed from the plant and elabo-rately prepared, is the chief offering of the most important complex of rituals, the soma sacrifice. This sacrificial substance and its ritual preparation go back to the Indo-Iranian period, since Avestan attests to the substance haoma, an exact cognate to Sanskrit so﻿́ma, and to its pressing and offering (see especially the so-called Hōm Yašt, Y 9–10). In both traditions the substance is also deified.The “Soma Maṇḍala” of the R̥gveda, Maṇḍala IX, contains 114 hymns dedi-cated to Soma Pavamāna “Self-Purifying Soma.” These hymns focus entirely on a single ritual moment, the pressing of the plant, the straining of the juice by pour-ing it over a sheep’s fleece to trap the impurities (twigs and the like), the mixing of the juice first with water and then with milk, and the pouring into containers prior to offering it to the gods, especially Indra. These actions are often presented metaphorically, with Soma conceptualized as a king making a royal progress across the filter and into the cups, a progress that can be compared to the conquering of territory. Or as the Sun in his journey through the cosmos. Or, quite often, as a bull racing to mate with a herd of cows, who represent the milk with which the juice will be mixed. Soma is thus regularly presented as having agency in the many descrip-tions of the purification of the liquid.Besides this dynamic deification especially characteristic of the IXth Maṇḍala, there is little narrative mythology involving the god Soma. The most important tale is the theft of Soma from heaven, where he was confined in a citadel guarded by an archer called Kr̥śānu. A falcon stole him and brought him to earth, success-fully evading serious injury from Kr̥śānu’s arrow, to deliver him to Manu, the first sacrificer. This exploit is mentioned a number of times in the text, but is most fully described in IV.26–27.Though one characteristic of Soma in later texts, a commonplace already in middle Vedic, is his identification with the moon, this equation is only attested in"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Introduction43the very late R̥gveda. It is clearly found only in the Wedding Hymn (X.85), whose first verses depict the wedding of Soma and Sūryā, daughter of the Sun. The bride-groom Soma in this hymn has clear lunar qualities, which are distinguished from his identity as an earthy ritual substance.g. Aditi And the Ādit yAsAs a group, the Ādityas generally represent the powers that order human society. This function is most evident in the three principal Ādityas, Varuṇa, Mitra, and Aryaman. In addition to these three, however, there are minor deities who are also called Ādityas—Dakṣa, Bhaga, and Aṃśa—and a number of other gods, such as Savitar and Sūrya, who may be called Ādityas when they exercise functions like those of the major Ādityas.The Ādityas are sons of the goddess Aditi, whose name means “offenselessness” or “innocence.” She embodies obedience to the principles of right social behavior that her sons represent. Later, the motherhood of Aditi becomes central to her identity and she becomes a mother to other deities.The most prominent of the Ādityas is Varuṇa, whose name is related to vrata﻿́ “commandment” and who therefore is the god of commandments. While all the major Ādityas are kings, Varuṇa in particular represents the authority of the king. In IV.42, as in the later Rājasūya, the king becomes both Varuṇa and Indra; that is, as Varuṇa, the king is a judicial authority governing the actions of his subjects, and as Indra, he is a leader in war. Accordingly, the divine acts of Varuṇa were often reflected in the functions of the R̥gvedic king. Like the king, Varuṇa watches over his subjects by means of his spa﻿́śaḥ “spies” (e.g., I.25.13). One of the responsibili-ties of the king was to ensure the prosperity of his subjects by providing sufficient water for animals and crops. Therefore, the divine king Varuṇa brings rain (V.85.3–4) and controls the waters, causing them to flow according to his commandment (II.28.4). As the king orders the human world, so Varuṇa orders both the human world and the world at large: the moon and stars appear and disappear according to his commandment (I.24.10), and he makes a place and a path for the sun in the sky (I.24.8, V.85.2, VII.87.1, 5). The king maintained the social order by punishing wrong-doers, and, likewise, poets fear Varuṇa’s anger and his fetters (pā́śāḥ), with which he binds those who violate his commandments (e.g., I.24.15, 25.21). Varuṇa is the master of the truth that governs the actions of things, as the king must be as well (II.28.6). Given that his kingship complements Indra’s, we might have expected Varuṇa to have had a greater presence in the R̥gveda than he does. However, the R̥gveda emerged primarily from the soma rite, and the soma rite belongs to Indra. In the R̥gvedic period there probably were other rites dedicated to Varuṇa or to Varuṇa and other Ādityas—there is such a rite in the classical tradition—but these left little trace in the R̥gveda.In most hymns Varuṇa is closely connected to Mitra, with whom he shares most of his royal functions. Unlike va﻿́ruṇa, the meaning of mitra﻿́ is reasonably certain. A mitra﻿́ was an ally or an alliance, and Mitra is the god of alliances. While Varuṇa"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"The Rigveda44governs relations in which one person has authority over another, Mitra governs relations defined by mutual obligations. These two kinds of relationships overlap with one another, so it is not surprising that the functions of Mitra and Varuṇa likewise often coincide and that the two gods are so often paired. Only one hymn, III.59, is dedicated to Mitra alone. As the god of alliances, Mitra governs peace agreements between different people, ensuring that they will take their proper places (III.59.1, 5; cf. VII.36.2) and remain in them (III.59.6). When other gods have functions similar to Mitra’s, they may be identified with him. In particular, Agni is sometimes called Mitra (e.g., III.5.4) or creates a mitra﻿́, an alliance, when he appears at dawn. The alliance to which such passages refer is the sacrificial alliance between gods and mortals. Humans offer the truth in their hymns and offer soma, milk, ghee, and the like as their oblations. In this way, they empower the gods, and the gods in turn provide what is necessary for human life.The last of the major Ādityas is Aryaman, the god of the customs of the Āryas. He therefore represents a third social principle, the customary rules that govern relations among Vedic tribes and peoples. This principle was especially essential in a society where the authority of the ruler would not have penetrated deeply into the daily lives or the households of his people. Among the spheres in which custom determined behavior was marriage, which created a new social bond between unre-lated families. Since marriage depended on the recognition of custom, marriage fell within Aryaman’s governance. While we have presented Aryaman as the god of customs, Thieme (1938, 1957) and other scholars following him have preferred to see Aryaman more narrowly as the god governing the rules of hospitality. In the absence of a state, the Vedic peoples needed to expect Ārya strangers to recognize and to act according to the customary norms of hospitality. Such norms were criti-cal in creating the possibility of relations among Āryas and therefore in unifying them. Aryaman does not often appear apart from Varuṇa and Mitra and shares their broader roles in maintaining the natural as well as the social world.Although relatively minor presences, three other gods, Bhaga, the god of for-tune, Aṃśa, the god of the share, and Dakṣa, the god of (priestly) skill, are also called Ādityas. Bhaga ensures that people will receive an appropriate portion of the goods of life. He is often linked with Aryaman and with the expectation for the prosperity of a marriage. Aṃśa ensures that people will receive the share of goods owed them, and therefore he is concerned with inheritance. In both cases, the two gods bring goods to people according to their behavior and family identity, and that function brings them within the sphere of social principles represented by the major Ādityas. Like the major Ādityas, Dakṣa is also concerned with right behavior, but in his case, it is the skilled actions of sacrificers. For further on the Ādityas, see Brereton (1981).h. sAVitARSometimes linked to the Ādityas and especially to Bhaga is the god Savitar. He is the god who “impels” or “compels” beings—and these can include mortals, gods,"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Introduction45animals, and objects. He especially acts at the beginning of night, when he sends beings to rest (cf. I.35.2, IV.53.3, VII.45.1). But he also commands the end of the night and the beginning of the day, when he brings forth the sun (I.35.9) and impels beings to action. Because he is associated with the night, he is also connected with the generation of offspring, who would be conceived during the night. Savitar is bright, with golden eyes, golden arms, and golden hands. He stretches out his arms in a gesture of command (II.38.2). Falk (1988: 17–22) reasonably suggests that his brilliance during the night and his outstretched arms point to the Milky Way as a manifestation of Savitar.i. sūRyAIf the Milky Way is the celestial embodiment of Savitar, Sūrya, the Sun, comes close to being that of Mitra and Varuṇa. The Sun is their eye, for his gaze is wide (VII.35.8) and falls on everyone (I.50.2). The Sun watches over the good and evil deeds of humans (VI.51.2, VII.60.2–3) and, so the poet hopes, declares the inno-cence of the sacrificers to Mitra and Varuṇa (VII.60.1, 62.2). The Sun is the felly that rolls toward Mitra and Varuṇa (V.62.2) or the chariot that the two gods set in heaven (V.63.7). Since he is so closely linked to the Ādityas, he himself is called an Āditya (I.50.13, 191.9; VIII.101.11). His link to the Ādityas is also a link to the king, who oversees his subjects the way that the Sun oversees all beings (X.121 and Proferes 2007: 137–41).However, Sūrya is not associated exclusively with the Ādityas. He is a form of Agni, Agni Vaiśvānara, and the face of Agni. Not only the Ādityas (IV.13.2) or Mitra and Varuṇa (V.63.4), but also Varuṇa and Indra (VII.82.3), Agni (X.3.2), Soma (VI.44.23, IX.86.22), and Indra and Viṣṇu (VII.99.4) are said to have given birth to the Sun, to have caused him rise to heaven, or to have established his brilliance.A number of images depict the movement of the sun through the heavens. The Sun flies through the air on a chariot pulled by seven horses or seven mares (I.50.8, 9, IV.13.3, V.45.9), or the Sun is a wheel pulled by only one horse, Etaśa (VII.63.2). The Sun is also the “reddish eagle” (V.77.3) or a falcon (V.45.9), or he flies like a fal-con (VII.63.5). However, there are relatively few narratives concerning the Sun. One repeated but mysterious story is that Indra stole or tore off the wheel of the Sun. He did so in order to help his ally Kutsa in Kutsa’s battle against Śuṣṇa (I.130.9, 175.4, IV.30.4, V.29.10). What exactly Indra accomplished by doing this and how this helped Kutsa remain unclear.j. uṣAs “dAWn”Dawn is one of the few female divinities in the R̥gveda and the most prominent among them. Twenty-one hymns are dedicated to her alone (every maṇḍala but II, VIII, and of course IX containing at least one), many of them displaying high poetic artistry and beauty of imagery, and she is mentioned hundreds of times in"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"The Rigveda46the text. She also has an Indo-European pedigree, being cognate with the Greek goddess Eos and the Latin goddess Aurora.The femininity of Dawn is one of her defining characteristics. She is generally depicted as a beautiful young woman, flirtatious and scantily dressed. Since she embodies the first light of day, she is gleaming and covered with bright ornaments, and her appearance thus strongly contrasts with that of her dark sister Night, a much less prominent goddess, though the ceaseless alternation of Dawn and Night is often remarked on. Her dispelling of the darkness and of fears of night is much appreciated, as she awakens and rouses everyone to their daily activities. Dawn is also, not surprisingly, associated with the god Sun, Sūrya, who is often depicted as following her as her suitor or husband. She is also said to be the mother or possessor of cows—the cows being the milky sky and rays of light at early dawn (see Watkins 1987 and 2009 for the Indo-European trope of “the milk of the dawn cows”).Her associations are not all positive, however. Because she heralds every new day, she reminds men of the unstoppable passage of time and of the aging process, as well as of the generations of men who used to view the dawn but have passed away. Dawn’s daily rebirth as an ever-young beauty presents a cruel contrast to the human condition of change and decay. The poets also often reflect on the paradox that each Dawn is new but each is the same as the one before and the one that will come after.The characteristics of Dawn mentioned above are reflections of the universal nature of dawn, but she also displays culturally specific qualities relating to Vedic ritual. Dawn ushers in the sacrificial day, especially the kindling of the ritual fire pre-paratory to the early-morning rites, and the interplay between the natural sources of light—dawn and the sun—and the man-made one—fire—is often described as complex and co-determined. Moreover, Dawn is regularly associated with wealth and its distribution to the sacrificial participants and is urged to give generously to them. This association between wealth and dawn has no naturalistic source, but arises from the fact that in R̥gvedic ritual the dakṣiṇās or “priestly gifts” were dis-tributed to the priests and poets at the early-morning rites (rather than at midday, as in classical śrauta ritual).Despite the vividness of her depiction, Dawn participates very little in narrative mythology, though there is a briefly alluded to (primarily IV.30.8–11) and extremely enigmatic tale in which Indra smashes the cart of “evilly angry” Dawn, and she runs away. Why Indra should turn against this emblem of benevolent femininity is unclear, but the story is also associated with Indra’s stealing the wheel off the Sun’s chariot, and both may have to do with the perturbation of regular temporal sequences.K . VĀy u / VĀtA “ Wind”As his name indicates, Vāyu is an ancient god of the Wind, although verses to Vāyu that refer to the phenomenon of wind are somewhat rare and oblique. For example,"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"Introduction47the roar of Vāyu echoes the sound of the wind, his hundredfold (I.135.3) or thou-sandfold (I.135.1) team reflects the wind’s speed, and the Maruts, who personify thunderstorms especially the monsoon storms, are born from his belly (I.134.4). Such characteristics show Vāyu’s close connection to the wind, even though he does not represent the wind directly.On the soma-pressing day, Vāyu is the first of the gods to receive the soma (I.134.1, 6; VII.92.1; cf. II.11.14), which he drinks unmixed (I.134.5, VII.90.1–2). But Vāyu also arrives with Indra on the same chariot, and the two of them share the first drink of soma. Just how both Vāyu and Vāyu and Indra have the first drink of soma is unclear, but, following a suggestion of Oberlies (1999: 155), perhaps Vāyu’s first drink reflects soma’s symbolic descent through the midspace as it is filtered, and the first drink of Vāyu and Indra is the first soma libation.The ordinary word for the wind is vā́ta, and unlike Vāyu, the god Vāta closely reflects the character and activity of the wind. He goes shattering and thunder-ing, raising the dust; he moves through the midspace and is the companion of the waters. The symbolic features of Vāta likewise reflect the wind. Vāta is the breath (ātma﻿́n) of the gods (X.168.4), and as the lifebreath, he is the father, brother, and companion of the man whom he makes live (X.186.1–3). Like the Sun and the Dawn, therefore, Vāta, the Wind, is completely transparent to the natural phenom-enon to which his name refers.l. AśVinsThe Aśvins, the two “Horsemen,” are old Indo-Iranian or even Indo-European dei-ties who have been brought into the soma rite. They are also called Nāsatyas, a name of obscure meaning and etymology, found already in an ancient Near Eastern Hatti-Mitanni treaty dating from the fourteenth century bce (in the form Na-ša-at-ti-i̯a) and in the Avestan cognate, Nā̊ŋhaiθya. It is probably the older name of this pair, with the lexically transparent aśvín originally an epithet. The Aśvins are connected with honey, ma﻿́dhu, and while soma comes to be called “honeyed” and “honey,” ma﻿́dhu was likely in origin a different offering to the Aśvins. They are also connected with the Pravargya rite and the offering of gharma, hot milk. Because they are two, the Aśvins find a place particularly in the morning soma offerings, which are primarily dedicated to the dual divinities Indra and Vāyu and Mitra and Varuṇa. Reflecting their association with the Morning Pressing, the Aśvins appear in the early dawn: they come at the break of dawn (I.157.1, VII.72.4), follow the chariot of Dawn (VIII.5.2), or accompany the dawn (X.61.4). However, they also receive the last soma offerings in an Atirātra, or Overnight Soma Ritual. Therefore, even if they were secondarily grafted onto the soma rite, that graft was a strong one. They are the fourth most frequently invoked deities in the R̥gveda after Indra, Agni, and Soma.As “horsemen,” the Aśvins are chariot riders and drivers, rather than horse riders. Their chariot is an object of special attention for the poets. It is often"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"The Rigveda48threefold, with three chariot-boxes, three wheels, three turnings (I.118.1–2), and three wheel-rims (I.34.2). The sacrifice with its three soma-pressings is compared to a chariot, so the Aśvins’ threefold chariot may represent the sacrifice. Their chariot is also swift—“swifter than a mortal’s thought” (I.118.1) or than the wink of an eye (VIII.73.2). Their chariot is drawn by various animals including bulls, buffa-loes, and horses, but also by birds (I.119.4), geese (IV.45.4), or falcons (I.118.4). Their chariot flies to many places and makes the Aśvins present in many spheres: in heaven, earth, and the sea, in the flood of heaven (VIII.26.17), among plants, and at the peak of a mountain (VII.70.3). The Aśvins’ speed and mobility are essential for them, for they are gods who rescue people from various dangers and difficulties in various places and circumstances.The story of the Aśvins that the poets mention most often is their rescue of Bhujyu, the son of Tugra, whom his father had abandoned in the sea (e.g., I.116.3). They also rescued Rebha from the waters, when he was bound, confined, and left for dead (I.112.5, 116.24, 119.6). They raised up Vandana (I.118.6), although exactly from what is not clear. They rescued Atri from an earth cleft (V.78.4) and from threatening heat (I.112.7). They found Viṣṇāpū, who was lost, and restored him to his father, Viśvaka (I.116.23, 117.7). They restored the youth and vigor of Cyavāna, who had grown old (I.117.13, 118.6; VII.71.5), and of the aging Kali (X.39.8). They brought Kamadyū, the daughter of Purumitra, to be a wife for Vimada (I.116.1, 117.20; X.39.7, 65.12) and gave a son to Vadhrimatī, a woman “whose husband is a steer” (I.116.13, 117.24; X.39.7, 65.12). They restored the sight of R̥jrāśva, who had been blinded by his father (I.116.16, 117.17, 18). They replaced the lost foot of the mare Viśpalā with a metal shank (I.116.15) and made the cow of Śayu give milk (I.116.22, 117.20, 118.8). They gave a swift, white horse to Pedu (I.116.6, X.39.10), and they set a horse’s head on Dadhyañc, the son of Atharvan, in order for him to reveal the honey to them (I.116.12). Not only do they arrange marriage or bring a child to a marriage, they themselves wed or woo Sūryā, the daughter of the Sun. While sometimes the husband of Sūryā is Soma (X.85) or Pūṣan (VI.58.4), else-where she chooses the Aśvins as her husbands (I.119.5, IV.43.2, 6, VII.69.3–4) and rides with them on their chariot (I.116.17, VIII.8.10).What the Aśvins do has been relatively uncontroversial. Why they do it and what is their character have been more difficult questions. Early scholars tried to place them in the natural world: Yāska cites interpreters who understood them to be heaven and earth, day and night, and the sun and the moon. Such interpreta-tions have been largely and rightly abandoned. Early on, Western scholars observed their similarity and therefore possible genetic relationship to the Greek Dioskouroi. Both pairs ride or drive horses; both are young men (kou͂roi in Greek, yúvānā in Sanskrit); both are sons or, in the case of the Aśvins, perhaps grandsons of Heaven (divo﻿́ na﻿́pātā); both rescue people in trouble; and both are called twins. Focusing on the last characteristic, Zeller (1990) sought to show that the Aśvins’ acts reflect above all the fact they are twins. So, for example, she explains their concern with sexuality and rescue as partly due to their birth. Because they have one mother but"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Introduction49two fathers, they themselves are endowed with a greater sexual potency, and because one of their fathers is mortal, they are closer to humans and inclined to help them. The circumstances of their birth are not very clear in the R̥gveda, however, and it is not certain that they were often considered twins or that their twinship was their central feature. Along somewhat similar lines, Oberlies (1993) suggests that the Aśvins as dual divinities can extend between opposites. They are essentially gods of the intermediate sphere, who facilitate movement between spheres: between childlessness and birth, death and life, old age and youth, non-marriage and mar-riage, and so forth. This is a reasonable explanation of the Aśvins, which might be extrapolated from the R̥gvedic evidence, but it is not expressed in it.m. mARutsThe Maruts are a troop of male gods. Though they lack individual identities, they are quite prominent as a group: over thirty hymns are dedicated to them alone and several more to them in conjunction with Indra, and they are frequently mentioned elsewhere. Their character has both naturalistic and social aspects. On the one hand, they are the embodiments of the thunderstorm, especially of the monsoon, and many of their aspects reflect this natural phenomenon: like lightning, they are brilliant and flashing, bedecked with ornaments and glittering weapons; like thun-der, they are excessively noisy on their wild chariot journeys, causing the earth to shake with fear, bending the trees and even the mountain; like thunderclouds, they are shape-shifting and sometimes clothed in gray; and they are accompanied by floods of rain. The terror they inspire is more than balanced by the fructifying rains they bring. All these physical aspects of the Maruts often inspire the poets to vivid and imaginative language.As a social phenomenon, the Maruts represent the Männerbund, an association of young men, usually at a stage of life without significant other social ties (such as wife and children), who band together for rampageous and warlike pursuits. The violence of the thunderstorm is akin to the violence of these unruly age-mates, raid-ing and roistering. It is not unlikely that Vedic society contained and licensed such groups among its young men, given the frequent warfare depicted in the R̥gveda, and the divine Maruts provide the charter for this association and behavior.The Maruts are not, however, entirely without social ties. Their parentage is clear, though the manner of their birth problematic and disputed—and often alluded to as a mystery. Their mother is a dappled cow, Pr̥śni, who can display androgynous characteristics and behavior; their father is Rudra, and they are often themselves referred to as Rudras. Moreover, they have a female companion, Rodasī. When the word ro﻿́dasī appears in the dual number, it refers to the two world-halves, but as a singular (also accented rodasī́) it is the name of the Maruts’ consort, a beautiful young woman who accompanies them on their chariot. Their normal location in the midspace between the two world-halves is presumably responsible for her name."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"The Rigveda50Perhaps the Maruts’ most important companion is Indra, for whom they serve as a sort of posse: marútvant “accompanied by the Maruts” is one of Indra’s stand-ing epithets. Their major role in dynamic mythology was to provide support and encouragement to Indra before the Vr̥tra battle, an episode also treated in Vedic prose narratives. But, according to one of the most striking hymns in the R̥gveda, I.165, a dialogue among Indra, the Maruts, and the seer Agastya, Indra disputed the extent of their aid at that time. In this hymn Indra and the Maruts argue over their respective rights to a sacrifice offered by Agastya; Indra asserts his rights in part because he claims the Maruts abandoned him to fight Vr̥tra alone, though elsewhere in the R̥gveda (and later) there is no doubt about their supportive role in that combat.This mythological contretemps has its reflection also in ritual, in fact to a rit-ual change occurring during the R̥gvedic period. Although in some of the Family Books Indra alone is the recipient of the offering at the Midday Pressing, in Maṇḍalas III and VI, in scattered mentions elsewhere, and in the classical śrauta ritual, the Maruts share the Midday Pressing with Indra. The tense negotiations among Indra, the Maruts, and the sacrificer Agastya in I.165 and I.170–171 sug-gest that the change in recipients of the midday oblation was a contested topic for R̥gvedic ritualists and the inclusion of the Maruts needed and was given mythologi-cal underpinning.n. heAVen And eARthOne of the most remarkable and satisfying phrasal equations across the older Indo-European languages is that of Vedic dyaúṣ pitā́ “father Heaven” with Greek Zeus Pater and Latin Jupiter, thus attesting to a deified paternal Heaven for Proto-Indo-European as well as the older daughter languages. Ironically perhaps, the Vedic god, the meaning of whose name is still transparent and lexically addi-tive, is far less important in the Vedic pantheon than his correspondents in the Classical languages, where the original semantics have become attenuated or have disappeared entirely.In the R̥gveda, Heaven as a divinity is generally paired with the female Earth, who is frequently referred to as “mother,” with the two a complementary paren-tal pair. They are normally grammatically joined in a dual dvandva compound (dyā́vā-pr̥thivī́), and several hymns are dedicated to this couple. If Heaven and Earth are the archetypal parents, who are their progeny? This is mentioned less than one might expect, but in a few hymns it is clearly stated that the gods are their children and especially the Sun. A less beneficent aspect of Heaven’s fatherhood is found in a myth, obliquely but vividly referred to a few times in the R̥gveda (I.71.5, 8; X.61.5–7) and told more clearly in Vedic prose (though with Prajāpati substitut-ing for Heaven)—namely his rape of his own daughter.Heaven and Earth also give shape to and encompass the cosmos, providing a safe enclosure within which life can flourish. The separation of the two to create"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"Introduction51this space is the primal cosmogonic moment, and Indra’s accomplishment of this separation by propping them apart is endlessly celebrated.o. t VA ṣṬARThe meaning of Tvaṣṭar’s name is fully transparent: he is the “Fashioner,” who “adorned all the creatures with their forms” (X.110.9) and who knows all living things (IV.42.3). But his role is more complex than his name might imply. He is the father of Indra (III.48.2–4, IV.18), whom Indra displaced and from whom Indra stole the soma (III.48.4). On the other hand, Tvaṣṭar fashioned Indra’s distinc-tive weapon, the mace, for him (I.32.2, V.31.4, VI.17.10, X.48.3). Tvaṣṭar is also sometimes called the father of Agni (III.7.4), and he is the god who has begotten offspring (III.55.19; cf. III.4.9). His role as a father perhaps explains his close rela-tionship with the Wives of the Gods (I.22.9, 161.4; II.1.5, 31.4, 36.3; VII.35.6), with whom he is ritually joined.P. R̥BhusIn some forms of the soma sacrifice, the three R̥bhus have a significant role as prin-cipal soma recipients in the Third Pressing. But despite that role, they have a limited presence in the R̥gveda itself. Only ten hymns are dedicated to the R̥bhus, together with one other that invokes the R̥bhus along with Indra. Nonetheless, despite their decidedly low profile in the R̥gveda, their principal actions emerge clearly. The R̥bhu hymns repeatedly return to five great deeds for which the R̥bhus are famed. They took a soma cup made by the god Tvaṣṭar and fashioned it into four cups (III.60.2; IV.33.5, 35.2, 3, 36.4). They made a chariot, sometimes identified as the chariot of the Aśvins (I.20.3, 111.1, 161.3; IV.33.8). They created the two fallow bay horses of Indra (I.20.2, 111.1; III.60.2; IV.33.10, 34.9, 35.5). They fashioned a cow, or made a cow give milk, or carved up a cow (I.20.3, 110.8, 161.7, 10; IV.33.4). And lastly, they rejuvenated their aging parents (I.20.4, 110.8, 111.1; IV.33.3, 35.5, 36.3). Significantly, as a result of these creative acts, the R̥bhus are said to have attained immortality or to have become gods.Their skillful acts are essentially priestly, and their great deeds reflect ritual acts or, more specifically, ritual acts at the Third Pressing. The four soma cups they cre-ated are the cups of the four principal soma-drinkers: Indra and the three R̥bhus. As mentioned above, the Aśvins’ chariot can represent the sacrifice, and therefore the chariot they made could be the sacrifice in general. The creation of the fallow bays of Indra is reflected by a special soma offering in the Third Pressing that marks the departure of the two horses of Indra. The cow over which they work may rep-resent the soma stalks from the previous soma-pressings, which are pressed again at the Third Pressing. The R̥bhus cause these depleted “cows” to release even more milk, which is the soma juice. Their last deed, the rejuvenation of their parents, is more mysterious, but it might represent the return or “rejuvenation” of the Aśvins"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"The Rigveda52at the end of the sacrifice in an Overnight rite or it could reflect the rejuvenation of the sacrificer and his wife, since the fertility of the sacrificing couple is a theme of the Third Pressing. For a more detailed discussion of the acts of the R̥bhus and their meaning, see Brereton (2012).q. PūṢAnAlthough Pūṣan is a minor god in the R̥gveda, with only eight hymns dedicated to him alone and several more shared with more prominent divinities (Indra and Soma), his idiosyncratic characteristics and the special diction used in his hymns attract more than his share of attention to him. Of the bardic families, only the Bharadvājas of Maṇḍala VI favor this god; they dedicate five hymns to him (VI.53–56, 58) with a further one to Pūṣan and Indra (VI.57) and a significant portion of the composite hymn VI.48; the three other hymns exclusive to him are found in I and X.The characteristics ascribed to him are humble and somewhat countrified: his draft-animals are goats, his tools generally an awl and a goad, his food of choice is porridge, and the skills he deploys for us are especially the protection of the roads and the finding of lost articles, particularly cattle. The level of discourse is often colloquial and lively, though he is occasionally celebrated in a register more appro-priate to loftier divinities.One striking feature does not fit this profile: Pūṣan in several passages is said to be the husband or consort of Sūryā, the daughter of the Sun, who is the archetypal bride in the R̥gveda, and he is also said to be the lover of his sister and the wooer of his mother (VI.55.4–5), though this apparent incest provokes no blame. The tangled family relations thus alluded to are not treated in any detail, so we are left with only tantalizing clues.R. ViṢṆuIn the middle Vedic period, Viṣṇu became a central figure as the embodiment of the sacrifice itself and therefore of a power that can exceed even the might of the gods. In classical India, of course, he finds an even greater destiny. There is little sign of those futures of Viṣṇu in the R̥gveda, since it has only a half dozen hymns dedicated to Viṣṇu or to Indra and Viṣṇu (I.154, 155, 156; VI.69; VII.99, 100). Viṣṇu appears alongside Indra fairly often, especially in his battle with Vr̥tra (IV.18.11, VI.20.2, VIII.100.12), and he is also Indra’s partner and ally generally. The only acts that are especially his are his three strides or three steps. With these strides Viṣṇu encom-passes the earth, and with his third step he disappears into a realm where none can follow (I.155.4–5). Or he enters into heaven where there is the “wellspring of honey,” the source of soma (I.154.5), or the highest cattle-pen (III.55.10). He is therefore the god who is wide-ranging (urugāya﻿́) and wide-striding (urukrama﻿́). The purpose of his strides is to create space and a place for people to live and move (I.155.4, VI.49.13, VII.100.4). This purpose could explain Viṣṇu’s close connection"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"Introduction53with Indra in the fight with Vr̥tra, since Vr̥tra represents what confines and hinders, and Viṣṇu’s strides what opens and frees. The strides of Viṣṇu in the R̥gveda antici-pate the strides that Viṣṇu takes as Vāmana, the dwarf avatar of classical Hinduism, and also in the middle Vedic literature Viṣṇu as the sacrifice is a dwarf (ŚB I.2.5.5). However, there is no direct evidence that Viṣṇu already has the form of a dwarf in the R̥gveda.s. RudRAAlthough Rudra, under his euphemistic epithet Śiva, “the kindly one,” has, of course, an extraordinarily great future in classical Hinduism, in the R̥gveda he has a very circumscribed role, with only three complete hymns dedicated to him. He has two major and complementary characteristics: on the one hand, he is fierce and malevolent, with an often inexplicable anger that needs to be appeased; on the other, he is a healer, who controls the remedies for disease. He is also, as noted above, the father of the Maruts, who are much more prominent in our text.t. sARAsVAtī And the RiVeRsAnother divinity with a great future ahead but little prominence in our text is the goddess Sarasvatī. Again the R̥gveda provides little or no evidence for her later role as patron of learning and the arts, though a number of scholars have attempted to find it. Instead she is celebrated, in the three hymns dedicated to her and in other mentions in the text, simply as a physical river with a powerful flow, which is sometimes destructive but which also provides fecundity with its fructifying waters. Other rivers are also praised in the R̥gveda, especially the Sindhu in a hymn dedi-cated to the rivers in general.u. VĀC “sPeeCh”One last goddess should be mentioned, Vāc or deified Speech (a noun with feminine gender). Although this goddess figures in a number of mythological narratives in the middle Vedic period, and although she ultimately seems to have become con-flated with Sarasvatī, thus amplifying the status of both goddesses, in the R̥gveda she appears as a clear personage very rarely, most prominently in a late hymn (X.125), which is a 1st-person self-praise (ātmastuti) spoken by Vāc herself.VI. R̥gvedic People and SocietyA. R̥gVedA As histoRyA number of scholars have treated the question of the historical background of the R̥gveda and to what extent we can extract historical information from the names of kings and peoples, the events they are depicted as participating in, and the place"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"The Rigveda54names where these events are depicted as occurring or where the kings and their retinues are depicted as living. We do not intend to enter into these issues and will simply make global reference to the many works of Michael Witzel (e.g., Witzel 1995a, 1995b), who has been especially active in discussing these questions in recent decades.We will only note here that the R̥gveda contains a large number of certain or likely personal names (see Mayrhofer 2003). Besides the poets and their ancestors, many of the names belong to royal patrons and are therefore especially common in dānastutis. Some kings have a presence outside of dānastutis, however; particu-larly noteworthy are the Tr̥tsu or Bharata King Sudās (“Good Giver”), the victor in the famous Battle of the Ten Kings treated in VII.18, whose forces also crossed a formidable barrier of rivers, as depicted in the dialogue hymn III.33, and King Trasadasyu, whose Royal Consecration may form the subject of the dialogue hymn IV.42. Others belong to human enemies of the poet and his group, whose defeat the gods (generally Indra) aid our side in effecting, or to clients of various gods, espe-cially the Aśvins, who receive help from these divine patrons. Needless to say, the “reality” of those named, especially in the last two groups, cannot be ascertained.B. ĀRyAs, dĀsAs, And dAsyusThe people of the R̥gveda refer to themselves as Āryas, which probably meant the “civilized” ones or something similar. Under this term they define their own group as the people who sacrifice to the gods, who adhere to Vedic customs, who speak Indo-Aryan languages, and who in other ways identify themselves with Vedic cul-ture. They also refer to themselves as mā́nuṣa and mānava﻿́, the “sons of Manu” or the “peoples of Manu,” for the legendary Manu (ma﻿́nu simply means “man”) was the one who first instituted the sacrifice and was therefore the founder of Vedic religious culture. They also called themselves the “five peoples” (pa﻿́ñca ja﻿́nāḥ, carṣaṇa﻿́yaḥ, or kr̥ṣṭa﻿́yaḥ), who lived in the “five directions” (pa﻿́ñca pradíśaḥ)—the cardinal directions and the center—or in the five lands (pa﻿́ñca bhū́mā; cf. Proferes 2007: 62). Corresponding to this world of five peoples in five lands, the R̥gveda also mentions five major Ārya tribes or tribal federations—the Pūru, Yadu, Turvaśa, Anu, and Druhyu—who can, at one time or another, be allies or enemies of each other. Even these major tribes may not have been stable social units, and they are not the only social groupings mentioned in the R̥gveda. Including the major tribes, Witzel (1995a: 313) lists around thirty social groups named in the R̥gveda, but notes that it is not clear which of these were extended families or clans or tribes or confederations.The primary social units that made up larger tribal units were the víś. There has been much discussion about how to characterize the víś (cf. Proferes 2007: 15–16). Generally speaking, scholars either see the víś as a “clan,” which was composed of related lineages, or a “settlement” of a kinship group. The former emphasizes the perceived relation of the people belonging to the víś; the latter, their shared"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Introduction55locality. We have translated víś as “clan,” although our primary intention has not been to adjudicate between these two views but to find a consistent translation. The head of the clan was the viśpa﻿́ti, the “clanlord,” who led his clan and represented it within larger social units, such as a tribe. The clan was itself composed of dif-ferent extended families, themselves led by a gr̥ha﻿́pati or da﻿́mpati, a “houselord.” Sacrificers generally came from the ranks of these clanlords and houselords. Larger social units composed of several clans were led by a rā́jan, a “king” or, as others prefer, a “chieftain,” who was chosen from among the viśpatis by the viśpatis of the clans that formed these units. These groups of clans then formed parts of larger tribes or confederations, also led by a king. The R̥gvedic saṃrā́j or “sovereign king” was likely a king whose rule included other social units that also had their kings. The saṃrā́j was differentiated from the svarā́j “independent king,” who ruled with-out interference from other lesser or greater rulers. While there is good reason and good evidence to believe that kings were selected by clanlords or lesser kings, there is also evidence for the lineal descent of kings, at least of the kings of major tribal confederations (cf. Witzel 1995a: 330, 336).The nature of a king’s rule was also affected by cycles of settlement patterns. Periods of fixed settlement (kṣe﻿́ma) alternated with periods of movement (yo﻿́ga, lit. “yoking up”). During the former the clans tended their cattle and raised crops, more or less in peace, in more or less fixed habitations. During the latter they trav-eled into new areas to gain new lands or to take cattle from other clans or tribes, or they confronted others moving into their territories. These two periods of settle-ment and movement may have been fixed according to the seasons of the year. In periods of mobilization the clans were governed by a king who could lead them in battle. This king was an embodiment of Indra, a war-king, a svarā́j, who required obedience from his subjects. During times of settlement the king was an embodi-ment of Varuṇa or of Mitra and Varuṇa, who maintained the peace among his people. He could be a saṃrā́j, who ruled, perhaps more loosely, over other rulers. The “war-king” and the “peace-king” might have been two different people, but more likely these represent two roles that a king might or must play. According to our understanding, in IV.42 King Trasadasyu is both Indra and Varuṇa, the king both in war and in peace.The Āryas fought among themselves, but their enemies were often groups of non-Āryas, called Dāsas or Dasyus, who may, or may not, have been non-Indo-Aryans. The opposition between Āryas and Dāsas or Dasyus was not an unbridgeable divide. There are many people, clans, and tribes in the Veda who have names without likely Indo-European derivation. Witzel (1999: 359–60) gives a “fairly comprehensive list” of Vedic “tribal and (some) clan names” that includes names from the R̥gveda. Of these he counts twenty-two that are non-Indo-Aryan names. The evidence is rough, but it suggests that at some point in their histories these people had adopted Vedic culture and had become part of the Ārya com-munity. The distinction between Āryas and Dāsas or Dasyus, therefore, was essen-tially a cultural and political one. The Dāsas and Dasyus were people who had"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"The Rigveda56not adopted or not yet adopted the customs and behaviors of the R̥gvedic Āryas and therefore were not part of the Ārya community. Exactly who the Dāsas and Dasyus were—as opposed to who they were not—is a more difficult problem. They must have been people and cultures either indigenous to South Asia or already in South Asia—from wherever or whenever they may have come—when the carri-ers of R̥gvedic culture and religion moved into and through the northwest of the subcontinent.According to the evidence of the R̥gveda the Dasyus are regularly the enemies of the Āryas, and the poets repeatedly ask the gods’ help against them. R̥gveda X.22.8 lays out the character of the Dasyu according to the R̥gvedic poets. He is akarma﻿́n “of non-deeds,” that is, he does not perform the sacrificial rites. He is amantú “of non-thought” because he does not know the truths formulated in the Vedic hymns and therefore is unable to articulate these truths. He is anya﻿́vrata, one “whose com-mandments are other” than the commandments of the gods. And he is a﻿́mānuṣa “no son of Manu” and therefore one who does not belong to the Vedic peoples. The Dasyus are not only other than the Āryas, they are hostile to the Āryas. The poets accuse them of having cunning tricks or wiles (māyā́, IV.16.9, VIII.14.14, X.73.5) that they use against the Āryas, and they call on the gods, especially Indra but also Agni and Soma, to strike the Dasyus down (VI.29.6), drive them off (V.31.7), or blow them away (I.33.9, X.55.8). Such Dasyus are human, although some of them may have been demonized humans or beings on the way to becoming demons.There is a great degree of overlap between Dasyus and Dāsas, since both names can be used of the same beings (I.103.3, IV.28.4, V.30.9). Like the Dasyus, the Dāsas are also humans and usually they are enemies of the Āryas. Indra destroys them (IV.30.15, 21;VI.20.10, 47.21, X.120.2) and their fortresses (II.20.7, IV.32.10). However, the use of Dāsa in the R̥gveda is more complex than that of Dasyu. Since the greatest enemy of Indra, Vr̥tra, is a Dāsa (I.32.11, II.11.2, IV.18.9) but not a Dasyu, the Dāsas apparently penetrated further into the nonhuman realm as demonic beings. Such a nonhuman Dāsa occurs also in X.99.6, where Indra “subdued the mightily roaring Dāsa with his six eyes and three heads.” However, dāsa﻿́ can mean “servant, slave” already in some R̥gvedic passages. According to VIII.56.3, a man named Dasyave Vr̥ka, “Wolf to the Dasyu,” has given to the poet “a hundred donkeys,” “a hundred wooly ewes, a hundred slaves (dāsa﻿́), and garlands beyond that” (cf. also VII.86.7, X.62.10). These dāsa﻿́s were obviously not enemies of the Āryas, at least not as long as they were subordinate to them. The R̥gveda also shows less insistence on the Dāsas’ cultural difference from the Āryas than on the Dasyus’—Dāsas are not described as akarma﻿́n, amantú, anya﻿́vrata, a﻿́mānuṣa, and the like. However, the poets sharply distinguish between Āryas and Dāsas (V.34.6, VI.25.2, X.86.19) and worry that the Dāsas have wealth that should belong to Āryas (II.12.4). Yet they also can have ties to the Āryas. In VIII.46.32, a dānastuti verse, the poet mentions a wealthy Dāsa named Balbūtha Tarukṣa, from whom he says he received a hundred camels. Although Balbūtha’s name is not Indo-Aryan and although he is called a Dāsa, he had apparently employed the poet, presumably to"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Introduction57compose hymns and to sacrifice for him. Therefore, he must have had one foot in Ārya culture, if not quite in the Ārya community.In summary, the Dasyus and Dāsas are overlapping categories of peoples opposed to the Āryas, and the poets call on the gods to defeat them for the sake of the Āryas. However, sometimes Dāsas may have been rivals to the Āryas or may even have been at the fringes the Ārya community rather than inevitable enemies of Āryas. For a thorough discussion of the attestions of da﻿́syu, dāsa﻿́, and dā́sa in the R̥gveda and later Vedas, see Hale (1986: 146–69). The above summary is very much indebted to Hale’s work, but Hale is inclined to see a racial distinction between the Āryas and the Dasyus or Dāsa that is not justified by the evidence.C. soCiAl And PolitiCAl oRgAnizAtionThe R̥gveda is the product of an elite segment of society, and it no doubt reflects only a small part of even elite religious life. For example, the life-cycle rituals that are so important in the late Vedic period, chronicled in the gr̥hya sūtras, are only tangentially treated in the R̥gveda, and we get only glimpses of the dharmic pre-scriptions that later ordered daily life, as preserved in the dharma sūtras of the late Vedic period and the dharma śāstras that followed them. The religious beliefs and practices of the non-elite are completely absent from the text, except perhaps in obscure and slighting references to practices that do not conform to R̥gvedic standards.Outside of the religious sphere we have almost no direct evidence of social or political organization and very little information about how people, ordinary or elite, spent their days. We learn a little about the various trades plied by members of society, mostly by way of incidental similes or poetic images. Most of what we learn in this sphere is about stock-raising, since the cow and the bull are both such powerful symbols in the poetry. We also learn a bit about the leisure pursuits of the elite, especially dicing and horse racing.All of this is to say that it is unwise to use the evidence of the hymns uncriti-cally to speculate on Vedic society. Not only does the text concern a very small percentage of the population, but even in that population its focus is very narrow. Moreover, everything we learn is shaped by the pragmatic purpose of the hymns as well as by the poetic sensibilities of their composers. Nonetheless, we can venture some very general remarks about social organization.There is no evidence in the R̥gveda for an elaborate, much-subdivided, and over-arching caste system such as pertains in classical Hinduism. There is some evidence in the late R̥gveda for the fourfold division of society into varṇas, the large social classes so prominent in the later legal texts. But even this system seems to be embry-onic in the R̥gveda and, both then and later, a social ideal rather than a social real-ity. The clearest evidence for it is found in the so-called Puruṣasūkta or “Hymn of the Man” (X.90), in which the body parts of the Ur-man correspond to the four varṇas, hierarchically arranged (vs. 12): the brahmin is his mouth, the kṣatriya (there"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"The Rigveda58called rājanya) his arms, the vaiśya his thighs, and the śūdra is produced from his feet. But this hymn is generally considered to have been a quite late addition to the text, perhaps to provide a charter myth for the varṇa system after it had taken more definite shape. Otherwise, the late R̥gveda provides some evidence for the begin-nings of a formal contrast between brahmaṇic and kṣatriyan powers; for example, in the final verses of VIII.36 and VIII.37, which are identical save for bra﻿́hmāṇi “priestly formulations” in VIII.36.7 and kṣatrā́ṇi “lordly powers” in VIII.37.7; the hymn preceding this pair contains a tr̥ca (VIII.35.16–18), in which each of the three verses calls for blessings appropriate to one of the three upper varṇas (though they are not named as such).The rest of the R̥gveda does attest to a division of labor and complementary and reciprocal relationship between rā́jan “kings” (whatever form this kingship took at this period) and the poets and priests who performed their sacrifices and composed the accompanying poetry (as well as the secular royal encomia whose existence we can posit though we have no direct evidence for them [see Jamison 2007: chap. 4, esp. 146–48]). This poet–patron relationship is especially on view in the dānastutis that were already discussed above. The status and pursuits of the “producers” or vaiśyas are barely and glancingly alluded to in the text, primarily in similes and the like.We might here spare a few words for the creatures who are otherwise invisible in the social and political structures, namely women. As is quite common for ancient societies, we don’t know much, but the few female figures that appear in the text tend to be quite vivid. Given their general absence from the R̥gveda, females appear disproportionately as speakers in dialogue hymns—both divine and semi-divine fig-ures such as Indrāṇī, wife of Indra (X.86) and the Apsaras Urvaśī, once married to the mortal Purūravas (X.95), or human or semi-human women such as Lopāmudrā, wife of the legendary seer Agastya (I.179), or Yamī, the first (almost) mortal with her twin Yama (X.10). The females in these hymns are quite outspoken, usually about sex, and their male conversation partners tend to look weak and helpless in comparison. For possible linguistic features of women’s speech as represented in the R̥gveda, see Jamison (2008a, 2009b, 2009c).But none of these female speakers is depicted as a real, contemporary woman, and what we know of that class is extremely limited. Beautiful sexy women are sometimes recorded by the poet as a particularly appealing feature of the gift cel-ebrated in his dānastuti, and Dawn is often compared to everyday women—either good, eager wives or not-so-good, eager courtesans. One must make allowance for male fantasy at this period, as in so many others. Mothers are tenderly described, but in generic fashion, and we also learn something about the contracting and sol-emnizing of marriage, both in the wedding hymn (X.85) and in the numerous men-tions of the wedding of Sūryā, daughter of the Sun, which appears to have been of a Svayaṃvara (“self-choice”) type, familiar from later Sanskrit literature, par-ticularly the weddings of Damayantī and Nala and of Draupadī and the Paṇḍava brothers in the Mahābhārata."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"Introduction59The Anukramaṇī attributes a few hymns to females, for example XIII.91 to Apālā Ātreyī and X.39–40 to Ghoṣā Kākṣīvatī, but these ascriptions are derived from the personnel depicted in the hymn itself. There is no reason to assume that the poet was female in these cases. A particularly egregious example is the attribution of the very interesting X.109 to Juhū Brahmajāyā, or “Sacrificial Ladle, Wife of Brahma [/the brahmin],” based on the appearance of both those terms in the text.Although there is no real evidence for female poets, there is evidence in the late R̥gveda for women in a ritual role, that is, as Sacrificer’s Wife (patnī). This is a standard and required role in the classical śrauta ritual of the middle Vedic period (discussed extensively in Jamison 1996a), and it appears to be a ritual innovation, much dis-puted, in the late R̥gveda (see discussion in Jamison 2011 and forthcoming a and b).VII. Language and PoeticsA. gRAmmAtiCAl stRuCtuRe And lAnguAge useSanskrit is an inflectional language with an especially rich morphology, and most of the grammatical information that is carried in English by word order and by separate elements such as prepositions and auxiliary verbs is coded in Sanskrit on the word itself. R̥gvedic poets glory in their grammar and are skillful in exploiting not only the many distinctions it provides but also grammatical ambiguities and neutralizations of grammatical distinctions. Moreover, since basic information, such as the identity of the grammatical subject and object, is coded on the word, the poet is free to use word order for rhetorical purposes, placing particularly significant words in emphatic positions such as initial in the verse line. When possible, we have tried to reproduce these effects, but all too often, given the very different structure of English, the result of a well-intentioned effort to follow the Sanskrit word order is at best awkward and artificial, and at worst unintelligible. This is discussed further in section VIII below.Even the briefest sketch of Vedic grammar would be out of place here. We refer the interested reader to Jamison (2004b) for a very skeletal account and to any standard Sanskrit reference grammar for more details. Macdonell’s Vedic Grammar for Students (Macdonell 1916) is admirably clear and informative, and the clas-sic Sanskrit reference grammar is Whitney (1889). However, in some of the hymn introductions we do make reference to certain grammatical facts, and some of these we will mention here. The Sanskrit noun has eight grammatical cases, expressing most of the syntactic relations pertaining in a sentence, including subject (nomi-native case), direct object (accusative case), possessor (genitive case), and so on. The noun also has three numbers, singular, dual, and plural, and three genders, masculine, feminine, and neuter. The verb is even more complex. Its basic unit is a nine-member grid of three persons (1st [I/we], 2nd [you], 3rd [he, she, it, they]) and three numbers (matching those of the noun) of the subject of the verb form (Table I.1)."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"The Rigveda60This basic unit is deployed in a plethora of tenses and moods, including at least three ways to express the past tense (the imperfect, aorist, and perfect tenses). Of these three, the aorist is often used to express the immediate past (in English, “has [just] done” vs. “did”) and is therefore frequently encountered in ritual situations, in which the poet announces a sacrificial act as just completed (like the kindling of the fire) or a poem just composed. The verbal system also has a special cat-egory called the injunctive, which has no formal marking for tense or mood and therefore can be employed in a variety of functions—an ambiguity that the poets often exploit.Such is the structure of the language in general. We should now consider how the poets utilized their language and what stylistic choices they made among the many possibilities afforded them by the grammar. We should first remark that the language we encounter in the R̥gveda was almost surely not the standard everyday idiom of the poets themselves. Instead, they composed in a deliberately archaic and deliberately elevated register appropriate to the poetic tradition they belonged to and the solemn nature and high sacred purpose of their hymns. Such reaching for the archaic and the elevated is common across religious tradi-tions; one need only glance at modern prayer books and liturgies, even those supposedly updated to reflect contemporary language, to encounter the same phenomenon. The problem with regard to the R̥gveda is, of course, that we pos-sess no control sample of the “standard everyday” language of the poets, though occasional forays into a lower register as well as phonological and morphologi-cal forms embedded in the text that show developments characteristic of later forms of Sanskrit and Middle Indo-Aryan give us some hints of what everyday language might have been, and the language of the only slightly later text, the Atharvaveda, may be closer (though certainly not identical) to what the poets spoke “at home.”Although most of the R̥gveda is couched in very-high-register language, the poets sometimes, sometimes quite abruptly, slip into what appears to be a collo-quial, even slangy, register—a switch that almost always has a dramatic purpose. These passages are especially found in dānastutis, which are often filled with puns, often obscene, and obscure terms, and characterized by “popular” phonological and morphological forms. When women’s speech is represented in the text, it also appears to belong to a lower register, and the technical terms of Vedic pastimes like dicing and horse-racing and occupations like stockbreeding and agriculture introduce us to lexical levels different from the high style of praise poetry and again tABle i.1. Sanskrit Verb Forms.Iwe twowe (all)you (sg.) [“thou”]you twoyou (all)he, she, itthey twothey (all)"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Introduction61presumably closer to ordinary language. Not surprisingly, it is harder to determine the meaning and reference of the words in these low-register passages than those in the elevated discourse that generally prevails in the R̥gveda, and many of our translations of such passages are provisional. Insofar as possible we have tried to signal the change in register by using more idiomatic and slangy English. (Needless to say, our translations of these parts will soon be dated. Such is the fate of slang, both now and in antiquity.) For further discussion of low register in the text, see Jamison (2008a, 2009b, 2009c).The poets’ manipulation of language was not limited to change of register. The most significant and salient feature of the poets’ relationship to language is their deliberate pursuit of obscurity and complexity. The strong privileging of obscurity is found in all aspects of R̥gvedic poetry, and we will mention only a few aspects here. To begin with mythology, the poets seldom (we would venture to say never) relate a myth fully and in chronological order; instead they shatter the narrative line by ignoring chronology, omitting key plot elements, and obsessively focusing on a few moments, alluding briefly and obliquely to the myth and deliberately failing to identify the actors in the myth. The same is true for ritual: well-known steps in ritual procedure (like the kindling of the fire or the mixing of soma with milk) are shrouded in metaphor and figurative language and do not always appear in their ritual order. The fondness for riddles and enigmas, to be discussed below, places the puzzle-to-be-solved at the heart of the intellectual and poetic enterprise.And so it is also with their use of language. The poets push their syntax to the limits of intelligibility (and, at least for us, sometimes beyond) by permuta-tions of word order, radically breaking up constituents and scattering their words through a verse, omitting key constituents (like the direct object or even the verb), and violating expected case frames and other grammatical conventions. They delight in confecting variant morphological forms, and the vocabulary they use is simply enormous relative to the size of the text: Grassmann’s lexicon of the R̥gveda is a very fat volume, with 1685 pages of lemmata—a giant word-hoard, full of rarities and hapax legomena, slang and colloquialisms. Determining the mean-ing and reference of R̥gvedic words has always been one of the greatest challenges in Vedic studies, going all the way back to the indigenous lexicographer Yāska in the mid-first millennium bce. Even words that are continued into later Sanskrit often have radically different values in the R̥gveda from their later representatives. (Especially cogent examples are the resonant terms dharma(n) and brahma(n), which cannot be read with their later values.) But many words simply do not appear in later Sanskrit or in Middle-Indo-Aryan. Much help is given by cognates in other Indo-European languages, especially closely related Avestan, and from Indo-Iranian and Indo-European root etymologies. But of course cognates and root etymologies are not always a reliable guide to synchronic semantics, as mean-ing changes over time and space, and some words are simply isolated, attested only once (the technical term for this is hapax, or more fully hapax legomenon) or only a few times in non-diagnostic contexts. We have often signaled such words in the"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"The Rigveda62introductions to individual hymns, although we generally give at least a provisional translation. Again, the poets clearly revel in their lexical riches, employing what seem like dozens of synonyms and near-synonyms for key concepts (like “shine” or “sing”) and seeking out rarities and archaisms.Why is obscurity so highly prized in the R̥gvedic aesthetic? On the conceptual level it has to do with the audience—or the most important members of the audi-ence—as well as the target of the composition, namely the gods. The aim of the poets is to praise the gods at the sacrifice. But it can’t be just any praise, tired repeti-tions of already hackneyed formulae—for the gods are connoisseurs. They of course already know their own fine qualities and formidable deeds, and they have attended countless sacrifices where these have been recounted. In order to ensure that the gods will come, and keep coming, to our sacrifice, not that of some competing sac-rificer, we have to trick out the same underlying material—“you are great, and your deeds and gifts are great”—in ever novel fashion, with imagery and turns of phrase to embellish and transform the same underlying message. For, as prose texts not too much later than the R̥gveda regularly say, “the gods love the obscure” (or literally, what is “out of sight”). Thus it is the gods’ taste for the recondite that shapes the humans’ poetic products. The poets regularly boast that they are producing “a new hymn”—for example, in the felicitous phrasing of III.31.19, “I make new (the hymn) born of old” (na﻿́vyaṃ kr̥ṇomi. . . purājā́m). This statement indirectly draws attention to another reason for the prizing of obscurity: the poets are working in an old tradi-tion, and each poet takes pride in making something new using inherited techniques.It is the “born of old” feature that gives the answer to a question we have only implicitly posed: if the poets are pushing their language to the very limits, how can it be intelligible? It is because of the very stereotyped and limited nature of the sub-ject matter and the shared universe of discourse among the poets, the human audi-ence, and the putative divine audience. Everyone knows the great deeds of Indra or the step-by-step procedure for purifying the soma juice, and they can recognize their plain outlines under the fancy-dress embellishments and recherche﻿́ conceits in which the poet has clothed them. The audience can complete a truncated phrase with the proper missing word because the full phrase is always in their heads. They can unscramble the syntax and rechronologize the narrative and identify the mythic actors indicated only by masking pronouns. A wider range of poetic subjects would in fact have constrained the poets’ verbal exuberance, because they could not so fully have relied on the unconsciously shared background knowledge of their hear-ers. For us this background knowledge is hard and consciously won and will be forever incomplete, but we must try to read the poems with an awareness of the performance context in which they would have been received.B. hymn tyPes And stRuCtuRing deViCesThere is no single, universally applicable template to which all, or even most, R̥gvedic hymns conform. At best we can state the uselessly vague obvious: most"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"Introduction63hymns praise a god or gods, often with reference to their attributes and deeds, and explicitly or implicitly request goods and services from the divinities in return for this praise. This exchange is often effected during the sacrifice at which we hope they are present, either because they are part of the sacrificial paraphernalia (like Agni and Soma) or have come as invited guests. Within these extremely loose param-eters, the poets take many different approaches, often emphasizing one element of the overall program while backgrounding or ignoring others. Indeed sometimes even the “praise” portion of the overall genre “praise hymn” seems to have been entirely elided. Because of the multifarious nature of the hymns, we have provided an introduction to each individual hymn, describing its particular preoccupations and structures and its particular deployment of shared tropes and themes. In what follows here, we will first just pick out a few especially common tropes that can dominate single hymns—this is a representative, not exhaustive selection. We will then discuss formal devices that provide structure to whole hymns. Our underlying assumption throughout is that hymns should be approached as hymns, not as mere unordered collections of loosely linked verses, and that it behooves the investiga-tor to seek structure and coherence even when the hymn seems on the surface to lack them.In hymns that do roughly conform to the sacrificial model just outlined, we can single out two salient aspects, which sometimes carry all or most of an entire hymn: the invitation and the journey. Many hymns begin with an invitation to the god to come to our sacrifice, and some hymns make this invitation the focus of the whole. Many other hymns focus on the god’s journey to the sacrifice (e.g., VII.24)—the hitching up of horses and chariot, the progress from heaven through the mid-space and across the earth, often passing over other sacrificers on the way (see, e.g., III.35). The epiphany of the god, his arrival at our ritual ground, can be the climax of the hymn (for a superb example of this genre, see the Marut hymn I.88). Not surprisingly, the invitation and the journey are often combined in a single hymn.The progress through the sacrifice, itself a kind of journey, is also a frequent organizational device. Sometimes this organization is quite precise, as in the hymns that follow an ordered series of oblations, like the Praügaśastra (I.2–3), the R̥tugrahas (I.15, II.36–37), or, especially, the Āprī litany of the Animal Sacrifice, ten versions of which are found scattered through the R̥gveda. More often the ritual progress is less formalized—for instance, the dawn sacrifice, first signaled by the approach of the goddess Dawn, the rising of the sun, and the kindling of the ritual fire, followed by the arrival of the gods who receive the offerings at the Morning Pressing, especially Vāyu, Indra, and the Aśvins, and the distribution of the priestly gifts or dakṣiṇās (see, e.g., VII.78).A favored verbal conundrum, the riddle, not infrequently furnishes the subject matter for whole hymns, in which each verse provides a puzzle, to which the answer may or may not be given within the verse itself. The most famous example of this is I.164, an All God hymn frequently referred to as “the riddle hymn,” but many other hymns have the same basic structure—for example, “the weapon hymn” (VI.75)"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"The Rigveda64and the delightful All God hymn VIII.29. Numerology is often an important part of these riddle hymns. Riddle hymns are generally formally structured as lists (see below).A number of hymns, especially, although not exclusively, late hymns, reflect on the nature or performance of the ritual and the functions of poets and priests. The Puruṣasūkta just mentioned anticipates the interpretations of the sacrifice in the Brāhmaṇas, for the “man” whose parts become the world represents the sacri-ficial offering (X.90.6) or the sacrifice itself (cf. X.90.7). A few hymns (e.g., IV.5, VI.9) take as their subject the poet’s meditation on the craft of poetry and on his acquisition of it, and R̥gveda X.129 links the creativity of poets to the creation of the world. Again anticipating comparable discussion in the Brāhmaṇas, still other hymns enter into debates about the performance of the sacrifice. In telling the story of Agastya, the Maruts, and Indra, for example, R̥igveda X.165, 170, and 171 appear to defend traditions that favor offering soma to both Indra and the Maruts at the Midday Pressing instead of to Indra alone as some traditions held. Likewise, R̥igveda X.109 provides justification for including the Sacrificer’s Wife in the sacri-ficial performance and thereby defends against critics of her inclusion, such as the poet of VIII.33. Although later employed in the ritual, such hymns apparently had a meta-ritual function and were probably composed for an extra-ritual context.Another famous category of R̥gvedic hymns is the dialogue or ākhyāna type, already mentioned above, in which two or more speakers, generally divine or semi-divine, trade verses with each other, often in a fraught or agonistic fashion. Generally one of the speakers is a female, and sexual tension is on display—as in the dialogue between the legendary seer Agastya and his wife Lopāmudrā (I.179), the twins and first humans Yama and Yamī (X.10), or the three-way discussion among Indra, his wife Indrāṇī, and a monkey (the Vr̥ṣākapi hymn, X.86).Such are a few of the thematic organizing principles of R̥gvedic hymns. At least equally important are various formal means of organizing hymns or parts of hymns. As one of us has treated this at some length in several publications (see especially Jamison 2007: chap. 2; also 2004a, 2006), we will provide relatively brief discussion here.One of the simplest and most effective ways to impose structure is by repeti-tion, a procedure that the poets constantly employ. It can be as straightforward as repeating the same word (often a personal pronoun such as “you” or the name or epithet of a god) at the beginning of every verse (e.g., forms of the 2nd sg. tva﻿́m in II.1); Sanskrit grammar facilitates such patterned repetition because its elaborate case system allows flexible word order, and therefore whatever their grammatical function, key words can be positioned in initial position. The poets often introduce complications into their repetitive schemata. Sometimes a repetitive pattern takes awhile to become established in a hymn, with the first few verses providing several variants that settle down into a frozen pattern somewhat later (see, e.g., I.112); con-versely, strict repetition earlier in the hymn may loosen up in the last verses (e.g., II.1, in its final verses 15–16). Moreover, many cases of repetition consist not of a"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Introduction65single repeated word, but of several (such is actually the case with II.1, where the pronoun tva﻿́m is followed by vocative agne), and the pattern may be established on the basis of grammatical categories, not simply words (e.g., preverb pronoun... ).Mention should also be made here of refrains. In some hymns every verse ends with a repeated phrase, which is often the length of a full pāda (e.g., III.55), a hemis-tich, or even longer (see VIII.36, in which only the first pāda of a six-pāda verse contains new material; similarly VIII.37 and to a lesser extent VIII.35), but can be shorter (e.g., the famous refrain of II.12 “he, o peoples, is Indra,” which occupies the last [post-caesura] six syllables of a triṣṭubh line). Sometimes the refrain is syn-tactically integrated into the verse in some parts of the hymn and not in others (e.g., I.96). Sometimes some or all subdivisions of the hymn have refrains; for example, in the tr̥ca hymn VIII.12 the last four syllables of the final pāda of each verse form a refrain, syntactically integrated in the verse, and each tr̥ca has a different refrain. (In the translations we will generally mark refrains with a preceding dash.) A special type of refrain is the family or clan signature: in some of the Family Books many of the hymns (in the right meter) end with a pāda that marks the hymn as a product of that bardic family—for instance, the Gr̥tsamada refrain of Maṇḍala II, “May we speak loftily at the ritual distribution, in possession of good heroes,” found at the end of most, though not all, of the trimeter hymns of that book.In addition to repetition of a single word or phrase in every verse, or almost every verse, repetitions can knit one verse to another in a chain, a procedure we might call concatenative repetition. There a word or phrase from one verse will be repeated in the next verse; then a different word from that verse will be repeated in the following one, and so on through the hymn (see, e.g., I.85, VI.55, X.84).As was noted above at the mention of riddles, hymns are frequently structured as lists, with each verse representing a separate item in the list. This structural prin-ciple is well suited to All God hymns, many of which treat a series of gods, one per verse (see, e.g., VI.49). Another common application of the list model is in the recounting of a series of divine deeds. A number of Aśvin hymns have this shape, with each verse treating a different (and often quite obscure) rescue or kindly act for a series of named persons (e.g., the Aśvin hymns of Kakṣīvant, I.116–119). Many list hymns are reinforced, their list shape called attention to, by syntactic parallelism and by repetition. For example, the famous Indra hymn II.12 consists of a series of definitional relative clauses (“[he] who. . . ”) recounting deeds and attri-butes of Indra, with each verse ending with a main clause refrain: sa﻿́ janāsa índraḥ “he, o peoples, is Indra.” A list by itself is undramatic and has no built-in trajectory toward climax, but the R̥gvedic poets are adept at finding ways to inject forward momentum into the static list pattern. For example, VIII.29, already mentioned, is a riddle hymn in which each verse refers to a different god or gods; the list builds on increasing numbers, from “one” (six verses) to “two” (two verses) to “some” (one verse), by way of “three” (once explicitly, once implicitly). The rising number leads toward climax, while the strict placement of each number in second position in the verse provides a rigid list skeleton."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"The Rigveda66A different kind of repetition is found in the well-known and often discussed phenomenon of ring composition (see, e.g., Watkins 1995: 33–37 and passim, with further literature). In ring composition the beginning and end of a poem or of a unified section therein is marked by repeating at the end, either verbatim or, more usually in the R̥gveda, a variation on, material found at the beginning. In the R̥gveda this generally involves the reappearance of lexical items or derivational variants of them, or phrases with partial agreement. For example, in the Agni hymn I.59, verse 1 contains the phrase víśve amŕ̥tāḥ “all the immortals” while the last verse (7) describes Agni with the bahuvrīhi compound viśva﻿́kr̥ṣṭiḥ “belonging to all (human) communities.” The repetition of víśva- “all” provides the ring, and the contrastive nouns it modifies (immortals, [human] communities) express Agni’s role as mediator between gods and men. The word víśva- is not otherwise found in the hymn, except in the derivative vaiśvānara﻿́, an epithet of Agni meaning “belonging to all men,” a form of which occurs in every verse. The ring thus reinforces the mes-sage implicit in the epithet. Ring composition frequently demarcates smaller seg-ments in a larger hymn, and paying attention to these clues often allows us to make structural sense of apparently sprawling hymns.The term “ring composition” focuses attention on the beginning and end of the section demarcated, but a particularly elaborate form of ring composition instead defines and focuses on the center of the section. We call this the “ompha-los” (navel) structure (see Jamison 2004a as well as 2007: 80–89). Here a series of concentric outer and inner rings isolate the middle verse or verses, which contain the mystery or the message of the hymn and are often phrased in mystical and complex fashion. Good examples of omphalos hymns include the famous cos-mogonic hymn X.129 (see Brereton 1999), enigmatic compositions like I.105 and X.28, dramatic presentations like the Vasiṣṭha-Varuṇa hymn VII.86, and hymns like VII.76 whose content is relatively conventional but which nonetheless show formal omphalos structure. Omphalos structure is also prominent in the Old Avestan Gāthās and has been more discussed there (though not by that term) than the corresponding phenomenon in the R̥gveda (see Jamison 2007: 86–89 with references).We might make brief mention here of initial and final verses as especially privi-leged sites in the architecture of a hymn, though they are not “structuring devices” per se. The first verse often poses a problem or sets the theme that the rest of the hymn will seek to work out. Probably the most famous Indra hymn, I.32, begins índrasya nú vīryā̀ni pra﻿́ vocam “Now I shall proclaim the heroic deeds of Indra,” after which the poet does just that—though it must be admitted that he only relates one of them, the Vr̥tra battle. Final verses can be of two types, integral to the hymn or extra-hymnic. The latter includes the clan refrains discussed above. A different type of extra-hymnic verse is what we might call the meta-summary. The poet often ends his hymn with an announcement of what he has just done, often expressed in the aorist of the immediate past and breaking the mood of immersion in the divine world. For example, the final verse of the exquisitely crafted Indra hymn I.61, which"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"Introduction67is full of praise for Indra’s deeds and attributes, begins with the brisk hemistich, “Thus have the Gotamas [the poet’s poetic clan] made you sacred formulations for the ‘Fallow-bay-yoking’ (oblation),. . . o Indra.” The sacrifice is complete, their job is done, and they point out their achievement to the god to spur his benevolence as they return to the mundane world. Final verses that are integral to the body of the hymn often subtly break patterns established earlier in the hymn to bring the composition to a climax. Such for example is the final verse (10) of VIII.29, a hymn mentioned several times above. Other examples are discussed in Jamison (2007: 79–80 and passim).One last technique to be mentioned, “poetic repair” (Jamison 2006), is not a structuring device but a method for producing forward momentum. The poet sets a problem—lexical, syntactic, or thematic—earlier in the hymn and then “repairs” this problem later in the hymn by substituting the expected word, syntactic con-struction, or thematic element for the problematic one. The audience is thus first put off-balance by a disturbance in the poetry and then rebalanced when the super-ficial solecism is fixed. An audience used to this type of repair will build expecta-tions that propel them through the poem.C. imAgeRy, metAPhoRs, And similesThe R̥gveda is rich in imagery: the procedures of sacrifice, the exploits of the gods, the activities of men, and the elements and functioning of the cosmos are con-stantly presented in images of something else, images based on similarity and paral-lelism. On the formal level by far the most common way of expressing these images is in a simile—the most common poetic device in the R̥gveda, as it is in Classical Sanskrit poetry. Although to Indologists the dominance of the simile may seem too predictable to be worth noting, in fact this is one of the features of R̥gvedic style that looks forward to the classical era, and seems to represent something of a break from the stylistic parameters of the poetic tradition from which R̥gvedic practice emerged. The Avesta contains very few similes—none in the Old Avestan Gāthās to which the R̥gveda is otherwise so akin—and the so-called “Homeric simile” of ancient Greek epic, with its elaborately imagined world expressed in verb phrases, is structurally very different from the Sanskrit simile.Both in Vedic and in Classical Sanskrit poetry the simile is essentially nomi-nal: that is, in a syntactic structure nominal elements are compared with each other, while the verb is held constant. An English example would be “Indra attacked the enemy, like a lion a sheep,” where the verb “attack” serves for both frame and simile, while Indra=lion and enemy=sheep provide the comparisons. In a case lan-guage like Sanskrit both “Indra” and “lion” will be coded as nominative case, and “enemy” and “sheep” as accusative. Neither Vedic nor Classical Sanskrit regularly has similes of the type “Indra attacked the enemy, as a lion devours a sheep,” with two different clauses constituting the comparison and a difference in verb. The “like” of the English example has overt expression in Sanskrit as well: by iva or na﻿́"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"The Rigveda68in the R̥gveda, and just iva in Classical Sanskrit. For further on the structure of the simile and the ways that R̥gvedic poets exploit it, see Jamison (1982).Although the simile is ubiquitous in the R̥gveda, it is not the only vehicle of imagery in the text. Implicit identifications of disparate elements are another ines-capable stylistic feature, and, as was discussed above, regularly recurring identifica-tions (bandhus)—the fire as sun, the chariot as sacrifice, and so forth—provide the conceptual structure of the Vedic cosmos. Thus, poetic style coincides here with the shared notions of the world that shape “the Vedic mind.” However, in mak-ing identifications the poets do not confine themselves to these shared and stable associations, but often make bold and superficially puzzling equations. Decoding the shared features that allow such equations to be made is one of the intellectual challenges that the poets posed to their own audience and that engages us, and often eludes us, to this day.Although the poetic foundation on which the R̥gveda rests was an ancient one, the imagery of its poems comes from the immediate world of its poets. As already remarked, the R̥gveda is fundamentally a collection for the soma rite in which Indra is the principal deity. Indra is a warrior, and therefore images of battle, war, con-test, and conflict provide the background for a great many R̥gvedic hymns. In the IXth book, for example, the ritual process of creating soma can represent a war campaign by King Soma. The dripping of soma as it is pressed is the beginning of Soma’s attack or raid. The flow of soma over the woolen filter and into the soma vessels is the destruction of Soma’s enemies. With the mixing of soma with milk, Soma wins cows and other goods and distributes them to his subjects, who are the sacrificers (cf. Oberlies 1999: 167–206).Other items associated with war and periods of mobilization also loom large in the poems, perhaps none more than the chariot. The chariot was one of the most visible cultural symbols of the Āryas, for it was likely unique to them among the peoples of ancient South Asia, and it was critical to their success in battle and their mobility. In R̥gvedic poetry the chariot becomes the hymn that travels to the gods or the sacrifice that brings the gods (II.18.1). When they perform the ritual or com-pose the hymns, priests become the fashioners of the chariot (I.61.4, V.2.11), and just as a chariot brings booty from war or a winning chariot the prize of a race, the sacrifice carries goods from the gods to humans (X.53.7). In I.129.1 Indra is asked to lead a chariot that is both an actual, racing chariot and a metaphorical chariot, the sacrifice. The chariot is also the vehicle of the gods, by which they come to the sacrifice. Distinctive animals pull the chariots of different gods: the two fallow bay horses of Indra, the dappled mares of the Maruts, the mares of the Sun, the ruddy cattle of Dawn, the goats of Pūṣan.More abstractly, the imagery of war is also implicit in the frequent symbols of expansion and confinement. This imagery is most evident in the principal Indra stories. Vr̥tra represents what hinders and blocks, and when Indra kills Vr̥tra, he shows himself to be the power that can destroy any other obstacles to life and pros-perity. The Vala cave enclosed and entrapped the cattle, and Indra must break open"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"Introduction69Vala to free the cows, the dawns, and the light. Finding open and well-watered pas-ture lands was essential for the Āryas, since their cattle, horses, and other livestock depended on them. The second half of IX.113 is a poetic vision of heaven, where there is “inexhaustible light” (7) and “youthfully exuberant waters” (8), where one moves “following one’s desire” (9), and where there is “independence and satisfac-tion” (10). It is the heavenly vision of a pastoral people, longing for a place of freedom and abundance.Pastoral imagery dominates R̥gvedic poetry at many turns. Cows are every-where, especially as the symbols and substance of wealth. The attention of the gods, which will bring rewards to humans, is a cow (II.32.3), and rain is milk from heaven (V.63.5). In II.34.8 the Maruts are compared to a cow, since they “swell” with rain, the way cows swell with milk. In VI.45.7 Indra, as the god who inspires poetic formulations, is a cow whose milk is the hymns. Or again, in VIII.1.10 Indra is both the milker of the cow and the cow whose milk is “refreshment” for sacrificers. Speech is a cow that gives the forms of speech as her milk in VIII.110.10, and in X.64.12 the insight that the gods have given the poet should swell like a cow with milk. VI.48.11–13 combines several images of the cow, beginning with an actual cow, whose milk is the milk that is mixed with soma but including also the cow that represents poetic inspiration and prosperity. In X.133.7 prosperity brought by the gods is a cow giving her milk “in a thousand streams.” The dawns, which are linked with the dakṣiṇā, the sacrificial reward, and with riches more generally, are cows (IV.1.16, 52.2–4).While the poets have particular fondness for cows, male animals too figure signif-icantly in the hymns. Bulls and buffaloes embody strength and virility, and therefore they represent mighty gods, potent sacrifice, and strong men. Agni is a bull with a strong neck (V.2.12), horns (V.1.8), and a powerful bellow (X.8.1). In V.40.1–4 the bull-like pressing stone and bull-like soma are prepared so that the bull Indra will join together with his bulls, the Maruts. Indra is “the bull overcoming the power-ful, the tempestuous king, smasher of Vr̥tra, soma-drinker” (vs. 4). Parjanya, the Thunderstorm, roars like a bull (V.83.1), has the powers of bull (vs. 2), and pours his fertilizing streams as a “bullish stallion” (vs. 6). Indeed, anything associated with their ideal of masculinity is likely to be bull-like for the R̥gvedic poets.The cultural role of horses—racehorses and warhorses—was obviously central to the Āryas and, as a result, so was their poetic role. Agni is praised like a steed (III.22.1), for he is a horse that brings rewards (I.27.1). When he is kindled, he is a hungry horse, which breaks free of his enclosure (VII.3.2). Soma is a racehorse groomed by the fingers of the priests and running over the woolen filter (IX.6.3, 5; cf. 13.6). The waters too are like racehorses that should run forever (IV.3.12). A sacrificer harnesses himself to the sacrifice like a horse (V.46.1), and the sacrifice is brought to success like a horse (IV.10.1). The significance of the horse is perhaps most obvious in the Dadhikrāvan hymns, IV.38–40. Dadhikrāvan was likely the actual horse of King Trasadasyu, but Dadhikrāvan also represents the rule of the Pūrus, the tribe to whom Trasadasyu belonged, and the sun, which can represent"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"The Rigveda70the king. Similarly, in X.178, Tārkṣya is a protective deity of chariot drivers and perhaps a deified racehorse himself.Although the poets are focused on pastoral life and the herd animals they know best, wild animals also occasionally appear in R̥gvedic hymns (see Jamison 2008b). Birds are frequently mentioned (I.164.21; X.80.5, 123.6), especially since the gods fly like birds (I.166.10). Unlike other birds, the falcon is not only fast but also can be trained. Mythologically the falcon is particularly significant, since it brought the soma from heaven to Manu (IX.48.4, IV.26–27). The wolf is a recur-ring symbol of lurking danger (I.42.2, 105.11, 18, 120.7; II.28.10), as is the snake (VII.38.7). The most dangerous creature of all is Vr̥tra, who is a gigantic cobra (I.32). More benignly, the inseparable Aśvins are compared to a pair of cakravāka ducks (II.39.3), and in I.64 the Maruts are not only bulls and buffaloes, but they also roar like lions and devour trees like elephants. Perhaps the broadest array of animals appears in X.28, which is built around various animal fables (also Jamison 2008b).Various human pursuits play significant roles in poetic imagery. The poets fre-quently mention weaving (e.g., I.115.4), which is similar to the intricate patterns of hymn composition and sacrifice (VI.9.2–3, X.101.2, 130). This is an inherited Indo-European trope. Given the pastoral symbolism elsewhere, it is not surprising that cattle-tending is a major source of poetic imagery. Indra is like a herdsman who separates his flocks from those of others (V.31.1; cf. VI.19.3). The poet too can be a herdsman driving his praise to Indra (VI.49.12). Or we have the reverse image: in VII.18.10 enemies run helter-skelter like cows without a herdsman. In addition to animal husbandry, the Āryas also raised crops, such as barley, but agri-cultural imagery does not figure much in the R̥gvedic poetry. Again, the reason may be the connection of the soma rite to Indra and to the period of mobiliza-tion (yo﻿́ga). In the period of settlement (kṣe﻿́ma), agriculture would have had a larger role.d. RiddlesMuch of the R̥gveda is enigmatic, not only because of our distance from the time of its creation, but also because the poets meant it to be enigmatic. They valued knowledge, especially the knowledge of the hidden connections (the bandhus dis-cussed above) between the visible world, the divine world, and the realm of ritual. They embedded that knowledge in hymns that were stylistically tight and elliptical, expressively oblique, and lexically resonant. As a result, many hymns of the R̥gveda can appear to us as riddles. However, there are also hymns purposefully composed to cloak their subjects or to withhold them until late in the hymn. In the later Veda the ability to solve the riddles they pose became a formalized demonstration of the knowledge of the priests taking part in the sacrifice. In the R̥gveda the riddle hymns challenged the interpretive ability of their hearers and demonstrated the cleverness of their poets."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"Introduction71One kind of riddle hymn is represented by V.47. Through its first six verses, it describes various deities but does not name them. The descriptions point toward various gods, but never so plainly that hearers could be sure of their interpretations. At the very end of the hymn, in its last verse, the poet twists his strategy and in the very first pāda names the gods he addresses, gods who may or may not be among those he described earlier. The clarity of that last verse throws into greater relief the difficulty of the preceding verses. The poet of VIII.29 uses exactly the reverse strategy. This is a list hymn, in which each of its verses identifies a god or gods by attributes or behavior, but not by name. In this hymn, however, the identity of the gods it describes is not mysterious at all—or is not until the last verse. At that point, when the confidence of hearers to interpret the hymn would be greatest, the poet presents a real riddle, in which the identity of the subject is not at all clear. In III.55 the riddle of the identity of the gods described in its verses points toward an even deeper mystery. This mystery is laid out in its refrain: it is that the many gods share a single lordship (asuratva﻿́m e﻿́kam).Other poets treat the sacrifice as a mystery. In X.114 the poet describes the con-stituents of the sacrifice in symbols that make the identification of those constitu-ents difficult or impossible. It leaves the sense that the sacrifice can be penetrated only so far, that it is beyond full understanding, except, perhaps, for poets who cre-ate such hymns. Another characteristic of X.114 is that each of its verses contains a number—small numbers at the beginning (2, 3, 4, 1), larger numbers toward the end, and an ironic plural of the word for “one,” e﻿́ke “such ones,” in the last verse. Other hymns employ numerical riddles, in which a number is key to their solution, if there is a solution. One of the most obscure hymns in the R̥gveda is X.27. Verse 15 describes the convergence of numbered groups of heroes, none of whom are identified. There are seven who come from the south, eight from the north, nine from the west, and ten from the east, but we are left to puzzle about the significance of these numbers and directions.Perhaps the most famous riddle hymn in the R̥gveda is I.164, a very long poem (52 verses, one of the longest hymns in the R̥gveda) that moves in different direc-tions as it unfolds. The hymn makes both implicit and explicit reference to Vedic ritual, including rites other than the soma ritual. In referring to these rites, the hymn suggests hidden links between ritual objects and acts, realities and processes of the natural world, and constituents and functions of the human body. These hidden connections continue to be hidden, for while we can see the general pattern of the hymn, the interpretation of its specific elements often remains difficult, and many competing solutions have been offered. This is, of course, often the case with these riddle hymns.e. metRiCsThe most conspicuous and ubiquitous formal feature of the R̥gveda is meter. The hymns are composed in a variety of meters, but all of the meters are syllable-counting"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"The Rigveda72and quantitative. That is, they consist of lines containing a fixed number of syllables, arranged in patterns of “heavy” and “light” syllables (the “quantity” referred to by the term “quantitative”). Heavy syllables contain a long vowel (a class that includes e and o) or diphthong or a short vowel followed by two consonants (which need not belong to the same word) and are symbolized in Western analysis by a macron ( ̄). Light syllables contain a short vowel followed by, at most, a single consonant and are symbolized by a breve ( ̆). (Aspirated consonants [those written with two roman letters, the second of which is h, e.g., th] count as single consonants.) The final syl-lable of a line is metrically indifferent and symbolized by x. The distinction between heavy and light metrical syllables simply formally enshrines patterns inherent in the language itself, where various linguistic processes are sensitive to distinction in syllable weight and the difference between short and long vowels is lexically and morphologically crucial.This type of metrical structure was inherited from the Indo-European poetic tradition, most clearly evident in ancient Greek meter, especially the Aeolic meters utilized by Sappho and Alcaeus, which are also syllable-counting and quantitative; these Aeolic meters have long been considered cognate to Vedic meter. The meter of the Old Avestan Gāthās is also closely akin: though the quantitative aspect has been lost, Gāthic lines have a fixed number of syllables.R̥gvedic meter is also identical in its structural principles to most of the meters encountered in Epic and Classical Sanskrit (with the exception of the ārya and related types). The major difference between Vedic meter and Classical Sanskrit meter has to do with the regulation of quantities. In the earlier parts of the line R̥gvedic meter has relatively unfixed quantities; it is only toward the end of a line (the cadence) that the quantity of each syllable is fixed (especially in trimeter meter, on which see below). By contrast, most Classical Sanskrit literary meters regulate the quantity of each syllable in the line; in other words, the relative flexibility of R̥gvedic meter has become frozen. The exception is the eight-syllable epic anuṣṭubh, or so-called “śloka” meter—the overwhelmingly predominant meter in the two great epics and the workhorse meter of non-literary Classical Sanskrit verse texts such as Manu’s lawcode—whose quantities are precisely fixed only in the second half of each line.R̥gvedic meters are generally divided into “dimeter” and “trimeter” types. The former consists of eight-syllable lines, which can be conveniently considered to con-sist of two equal segments, with the second half tending more toward fixed quanti-ties, generally in an iambic pattern. However, it is important to keep in mind that there is no fixed caesura (word-break) in dimeter meter, and even the four cadential syllables are not rigidly fixed in quantity. Trimeter meter is more complex. It gener-ally consists of lines of either eleven or twelve syllables (triṣṭubh or jagatī respec-tively), characterized not only by a fixed cadential sequence of four (triṣṭubh) or five (jagatī) syllables but also by a strong caesura after the first four or five syllables in the line. The caesura and the cadence thus effectively divide the line into three parts—the opening (the first 4–5 syllables before the caesura), the “break” (the 2–3 syllables following the caesura), and the cadence."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"Introduction73Examples of the three most common types of lines, dimeter, trimeter (triṣṭubh), and trimeter (jagatī) follow, with heavy and light syllable scansion given below the text.

The two-syllable ( ̆ ̆) break is identical to that of the triṣṭubh with opening of five, as shorter breaks have fewer possible patterns. The cadence is the standard jagatī cadence. Note that though there happens to be a word break between the break and the cadence in this line, it is not an obligatory one, and in fact none of the other three trimeter lines quoted shows a word break at this position.The lines just described are called pādas, a term we will employ throughout this work. A R̥gvedic verse ( r̥c) consists of a group of pādas, generally three or four, though meters with fewer than three pādas or more than four are also found. Lower-case roman letters are used to refer to the pādas in a verse (so, e.g., “5b” will refer to the second pāda in the fifth verse of a hymn). Again, we will regularly use this shorthand in identifying lines. There is another significant division within the verse: the hemistich or half-verse. In four-pāda verses this consists of two two-pāda units; in three-pāda verse, the first two pādas are considered the hemistich, with a single pāda following.The most common dimeter meter is gāyatrī, a collection of three eight-syllable pādas. Approximately one quarter of the R̥gveda is composed in this meter. The other common dimeter meter is anuṣṭubh, which contains four such eight-syllable lines and is the ancestor of the Epic and Classical śloka mentioned above. The most common trimeter meter, in fact the most common meter in the R̥gveda, is triṣṭubh, which accounts for approximately 40% of the text. It consists of four eleven-syllable pādas, while jagatī likewise consists of four pādas, though of twelve syllables each. Jagatī is the third most common meter, after triṣṭubh and gāyatrī. Besides these mono-type meters, some hymns are composed in what are referred to in general as “mixed-lyric meters,” whose verses consist of combinations of eight- and twelve-syllable pādas. There are a number of different combinations, each with a different name. (For details, see especially the table of meters in van Nooten and Holland 1994, referred to below.)The details just given are not relevant only to professional metricians, for the rhetoric and semantic structure of the R̥gveda are strongly driven and shaped by meter. Syntactic constituents often occupy single pādas, for example, and metrical boundaries (the beginning and end of the line, as well as the position immediately after the caesura) are favored sites for positioning emphatic elements. The hemistich is a particularly salient unit, dividing the verse into syntactic and semantic halves. In fact, we have discovered that it is almost always possible, and generally desirable, to render the hemistich division in English—that is, to translate the first half and the second half of the verse as separate units. This is reflected in the physical layout of our translation, with the second hemistich starting a new line. It is remarkable how faithful it is possible to be to the Sanskrit hemistichs without significantly com-promising the English. (The hemistich division is less important and more often syntactically breached in gāyatrī, since the division results in uneven parts: two pādas followed by one, but even in gāyatrī the third pāda is often independent of the first two.)"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Introduction75The verse is the most significant unit in a R̥gvedic hymn—hence the name R̥g-veda, or Veda of verses (r̥c). It is almost always a self-contained syntactic con-struction, and even when that construction is not entirely independent syntactically (e.g., when it is a relative clause, dependent on a main clause in a verse following or preceding), it will be internally unified. There are almost no examples of syntactic enjambment between verses. This focus on the internal unity and syntactic indepen-dence of the verse is continued in later Sanskrit poetry, where it reaches its defining limit in so-called muktaka verses or single-verse poems.Nonetheless, some hymns are structured into larger groupings of two to three verses, which are sometimes referred to as “strophes.” The tr̥ca or “triplet” is the most common such grouping, consisting of three verses, generally in gāyatrī, though other meters are also found. Sometimes the tr̥ca unit is strongly defined by shared lexicon or a shared refrain, or by parallel syntactic structures, or by a com-mon theme; other tr̥cas have only the faintest signs of unity in rhetoric or content. Quite long hymns can be built from these three-verse units, which are especially common in Maṇḍala VIII and, as Oldenberg argued (1888: 119–40), were the spe-cial province of the Udgātar (singer) priest. Many of these strophes were borrowed into the Sāmaveda, whose principal priest in classical śrauta ritual was the Udgātar and one of whose major textual sources is R̥igveda VIII. The other major strophic type is the pragātha, consisting of two verses in two different types of “mixed lyric” meters. The usual combination is br̥hatī (8 8, 12 8) and satobr̥hatī (12 8, 12 8). Again, pragāthas are especially common in the VIIIth Maṇḍala and frequently taken over into the Sāmaveda. Thus the standard types of multi-verse groupings tended to provide the lyric or sung portion of the ritual, as against the recited por-tions associated with the Hotar priest.A brief and clear account of R̥gvedic meter is given in Macdonell (1916: appen-dix II). For full details see Arnold (1905). Oldenberg’s Prolegomena (1888) is invalu-able both for his detailed treatment of the meters of particular hymns and sets of hymns and for his discussion of the historical implications of metrical details. Van Nooten and Holland (1994) provide a hymn-by-hymn metrical commentary in somewhat lapidary style, as well as a table of R̥gveda meters as identified in the Anukramaṇī (pp. xiv–xvi), which should be consulted for the names and character-istics of meters not explicitly discussed here.VIII. Translation PrinciplesA. sAnsKRit into english: PRoBlems And solutionsAs has been repeatedly emphasized above, the R̥gveda is a poetic text, structured by intricate meters, driven by rhetorical principles based on this metrical struc-ture, and crafted by skillful poets for a poetically aware audience. Nonetheless, we have chosen to translate the text into prose, not verse—for several reasons. First"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"The Rigveda76and perhaps most important, we are not poets, and we would dishonor the highly trained and highly inventive poets of the R̥gveda by translating their artful cre-ations into bad English verse. Moreover, the structures of the English language and of English verse are entirely different from those of Vedic Sanskrit. Since English lacks the elaborate morphology of Sanskrit, it is not as possible in English, with-out awkwardness or, indeed, loss of sense, to use word order for rhetorical rather than syntactic purposes. The stress-counting principle that regulates English blank verse and the end rhyme characteristic of much English poetry are alien to R̥gvedic poetry. Thus the English poetry that resulted from a verse translation would not replicate in any of its most salient features the structures of R̥gvedic poetry.We have, however, tried to retain the verse structure as much as possible. All the translations reproduce the verse divisions found in the hymn, and within verses the hemistich boundary is also always marked, with the second hemistich beginning a new line. In fact, as noted above, it has almost always been possible to translate hemistichs as units without breaching the boundary—an indication of how strong a compositional element the hemistich was for the poets.Translators who are also poets might succeed in rendering the R̥gveda (or parts thereof) into poetry that captures the spirit and flair of the original, but such ren-dering would perforce (or so we think) distort or reinvent the literal meaning of the text. This is of course a perfectly acceptable translational strategy—some think it is the only acceptable strategy: that a literal translation is a fundamental betrayal of the original. But we have chosen to hew as close to what we consider the literal meaning of the text and its constituent words as we can. The text is multivalent, and over the millennia it has received multiple, often incompatible, interpretations. By translating the text literally, we hope to leave the interpretive opportunities open for the readers, inviting them to participate in the act of interpretation though provid-ing as much guidance as we can.As was also noted above, the everyday language of the R̥gvedic poets was almost surely not identical to the language they used in their hymn compositions. They may well have spoken a form of early Middle Indo-Aryan—judging from some Middle Indic phonological features found in the hymns—or at the very least a more stripped-down form of Sanskrit, with the limitations on morphological categories and variant forms found in middle Vedic prose and in Epic and Classical Sanskrit. Since they were therefore composing in a deliberately archaic style, we have aimed for a fairly formal and old-fashioned English style on both the lexical and the syn-tactic levels, with occasional whiffs of the archaic. (For example, one of us often translates the morphologically opaque archaic frozen form śa﻿́m with the equally opaque English “weal,” to capture its linguistic isolation; the other of us prefers “luck,” which does have the advantage of conveying more sense to the modern English reader.)The poets were, however, quite aware of linguistic registers, and are capable of making wrenching shifts from, for example, the high-register solemnity of most of their production to slangy and sometimes obscene humorous banter. (See, for"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"Introduction77example, Indrāṇī’s discourse in X.86, which lurches from shockingly explicit vul-garity [especially from a goddess] to the highest of high styles.) Such passages are especially common in dānastutis. When we have been able to identify low-register vernacular passages, we have attempted to render them into a similar English register.One feature where we have deliberately avoided English archaism is in the trans-lation of the 2nd-person pronouns, singular versus plural (and dual)—rendering all of them with “you,” although it would occasionally have been useful to disambigu-ate between singular and plural. In part this is an English stylistic choice: a consis-tent distinction between “thou/thee” and “ye/you” quickly becomes wearisome for the reader. But it would also produce a misleadingly archaic impression; the distinc-tion between the singular and plural [/dual] 2nd-person pronouns remains a feature in Sanskrit throughout its history, and, though the dual was lost, the singular-plural distinction was also a feature of Middle Indo-Aryan. Therefore this same distinc-tion in Vedic Sanskrit carried no stylistic weight at all; it’s simply an unremarkable feature of the grammar, and the obsolete English “thou” would distort the effect of the text.An area where the balancing act between R̥gvedic style and English intelligibil-ity most tests the translator is in the placement of words. The R̥gvedic poet may set a word at the beginning of a verse or hemistich to draw special attention to it, or hold back words until the end of the verse to surprise his audience or cause them to change their expectations about the meaning of the line. He may position identi-cal or similar elements in the same place in a sequence of verses in order to build larger rhetorical units or to emphasize the similarity of ideas in the verses, or may scramble elements that underlyingly belong together in order to produce a mosaic effect, whose contours only become clear over time. In short, the poet can use the placement of words in order to unfold his ideas in a particular and deliberate way. The freer word order that an inflected language and a shared poetic diction allow gave the poets flexibility in arranging their verse. Our translation does not aspire to be poetic, and our medium is the highly uninflected English language. Nonetheless, we have been reluctant to surrender all attempts to follow the poets’ positioning of elements, and have tried to follow the order of words and ideas as well as we can, especially in cases where the verbal positioning seems to make a particular rhetori-cal or conceptual point. The result is an English that is not quite natural. Apart from preserving the structure of the verse and the unfolding of ideas, there are other advantages we see in adopting this style. It reminds readers that the R̥gveda is elevated and solemn poetry, and it signals that even for the composers and their audience the language of the R̥gveda was not everyday speech and the expression of ideas in the text was not designed to be direct and pellucid. A translation into a too fluent and colloquial English would produce a very misleading impression of the original. We hope that this style of translation will slow readers enough to allow them to sense the style of the original, while not rendering the English too impenetrable."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"The Rigveda78One of the features of almost all previous translations of the text, as well as the scholarly paraphernalia, like dictionaries, that have supported these translations, is that the lexical range in the translation language is very narrow and tends toward the abstract, the general, and the overlapping. It’s a standing joke among Vedicists that all verbs mean “shine,” “sing,” “speed,” or “give”; all adjectives, “bright” or “swift”; all nouns, “praise.” This monotony contrasts sharply with the variety and color of the R̥gveda’s Sanskrit. As we have already noted, Grassmann’s lexicon of the R̥gveda is enormous compared to the size of the text (there must be somewhere in the digital world a metric for evaluating lexical diversity per text size). The “sing/ speed/shine” translational style severely flattens this lexical richness. It is as if all the verbal exuberance of Shakespeare were squeezed into the neo-classical spareness of a French dramatist like Racine.This habit not only robs the translation of its verbal diversity but, perhaps more important, of its metaphorical content. Translators are usually not semantically wrong when they translate a verb as, say, “shine,” but they are often translating the underlying sense of a metaphor rather than the more vivid, and often more jarring, image evoked by a more precise word. To give a single example, there is a verbal root √ribh that seems literally to mean “croak,” “creak,” “rasp,” “squawk”—used, for example, of the sound of a creaky wagon, or of a crackling fire. It is also fre-quently used of poets and praise-singers, and a nominal derivative of it, rebha﻿́, is regularly applied to poets. But—no surprise—the standard rendering in current translations and dictionaries is “singer”—German “Sänger”—and this certainly correctly identifies the referent of the word. But the particular voice quality, per-haps “hoarse” or “husky,” is sacrificed to making a fluent and easily interpreted translation—not scaring the horses, as it were, by suggesting that the singers were anything but mellifluous.The twentieth century saw much progress in limiting and pinpointing the mean-ing of many R̥gvedic words, and in appreciating their position in linguistic register (e.g., solemn and hieratic vs. colloquial vs. technical vs. unmarked and general). Incorporating these results makes for a much more vivid text, but also a “spik-ier” one, with unsettling or discordant images or juxapositions of concepts. To return to the √ribh example just given, a translation like “hear the poet as he rasps” (VIII.37.7) is more likely to take the reader aback than “hear the praise-singing poet” (Geldner’s “den lobsingenden. . . ”), but a simile in a passage also containing this verb, IX.97.57 “the poets squawk like birds of prey,” supports the less easy interpretation. In that passage Geldner’s attempt to rescue it so radically attenuates the phrase that it becomes close to incomprehensible: “the seers become audible like vultures” (“werden die Seher lautbar wie die Geier”).In our translation we have aimed, again, for the literal, and sometimes discor-dant, sense of the word—even if the literal sense was a dead metaphor for contem-porary speakers. We have, in fact, no way to determine whether a metaphor was dead or alive at the time of composition, and in any case, even if at the time of com-position it was dead, it had been previously a metaphor with real poetic heft. On the"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"Introduction79other hand, we have not been able entirely to follow the austere and chaste principle of Bergaigne and Thieme—to translate a particular word always in the same way, no matter what the context. Attempts to do so often produce unintelligible English, whereas some adjustment to context aids the reader to grasp the sense. Thus our translation has been a balancing act between the flattening effect of rendering the underlying sense as opposed to the literal surface and a too principled adherence to a single literal meaning for every word regardless of context.In representing the spikier and more difficult style that we see in the R̥gveda, in contrast to the translation tradition that has attempted to smooth out the dif-ficulties, fill in the gaps, and aim for clarity above all, at the expense of the literal meaning and obscure style of the original, we have been aided by the sheer chance of the age we live in. As the discussion above has repeatedly suggested, newer ways of looking at the text have the unintended result of making the text “harder.” The images are more striking but also more obscure; the lexicon is more specific but the combinations of words therefore less harmonious; the ritual underpinnings cannot be glossed over, however bizarre and “unpoetic” the actions depicted may seem. We think the result is truer to the spirit of the text than the easy flow of older transla-tions and also truer to our age. It must have been difficult to appreciate the polished obscurities of R̥gvedic verse before the twentieth century enshrined deliberate dif-ficulty in poetry as a preeminent sign of serious verbal art. So Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot begat our poets Vasiṣṭha and Viśvāmitra, in a paradoxical reversal of the paternal relationship that a R̥gvedic bard would relish.Stylistically the R̥gveda is a dense and compact text. This results from at least two factors. On the one hand, the elaborate morphology of Sanskrit allows a parsimony of words, as opposed to the diffuse nature of a language like English. To choose one example, this from the Atharvaveda (III.20.8): the two-word clause a﻿́ditsantaṃ dāpayatu necessarily translates into at least eleven English words: “Let him cause the man not wishing to give to give.” There is no way to reproduce the verbal spareness of Sanskrit in a language like English, which needs a plethora of function words to render the less assertive moving parts of Sanskrit morphology.But in addition to the purely linguistic aspect, we must reckon with the narrow shared universe of discourse in the text. We have previously discussed the formu-laic nature of R̥gvedic rhetoric. The shared deep-structure verbal formulae and the shared knowledge of the nature of R̥gvedic gods, rituals, and religious principles and beliefs allow the poets to refer to such knowledge with a kind of verbal short-hand—truncated or twisted formulae, brief and recherche﻿́ allusions, and so forth. Deliberate ellipsis is an important stylistic feature of the text, with the audience invited and expected to fill the ellipsis.These issues present the translators with at least two problems (in addition to figuring out what is actually going on). First, to try to reflect the density of the text in a language that is not well adapted to this style—a balancing act through-out the translation. Second, to determine when to supply material not found in the"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"The Rigveda80particular context, and what to supply. Although we began the translation with the determination to supply nothing not found in the passage itself, this principle came to seem not only unworkable but also contrary to the practice of the poets, since they often rely on shared knowledge to allow their contemporary audience to “fill in the blanks” of allusive expressions. But we have tried to avoid the regret-table tendency of some translators to supply material without any methodologi-cal controls. Instead, supplied material in our translation is either generated from material recoverable from the passage itself (e.g., verbs or nouns in the same or adjacent verses) or from parallel phrases elsewhere in the text. Here the study of the parallel passages adduced by Geldner in his notes has been absolutely crucial for our interpretation, as well as other types of parallel phraseology, the discovery of which has been much aided by Lubotsky’s R̥gvedic Word Concordance (1997). We have thus attempted to allow the poets and the verbal connections they have forged to determine what a passage needs for completion, rather than simply to follow our own whims and a common-sense notion of what has been omitted, since “common sense” is a culture-specific quality.Most of the material we have supplied has been placed in parentheses, in order to indicate that it is the result of our extrapolation and is not found explicitly in the text itself. Although parenthetical additions can sometimes be distracting, the pos-sibility of misleading readers about what is actually there and what is not, in a text where almost nothing can be taken for granted, seemed to us a sufficient danger to require major additions to be overtly signaled. However, some supplied material has been silently slipped into the text proper, especially necessary English function words that lack obligatory Sanskrit counterparts. For example, Sanskrit does not obligatorily supply definite or indefinite articles (“the” vs. “a[n] ”) and in fact does not have either category as a separate grammatical marker. But English requires them and we have supplied them; this often forces a choice on the translators as to whether a noun is indefinite (“a horse”) or definite (“the horse”), but in most such cases of ambiguity we have considered it a kindness to the reader not to indi-cate the uncertainty with parentheses. Likewise for possessive pronouns: Sanskrit regularly does not overtly mark pronominal possession (“his horse”) where English does, and in cases where the possessor seems fairly clear we have often supplied the possessive without parenthetical marking. We also regularly supply pronouns for repeated objects and the like, of the type “praise you and beseech you” rather than “praise you and beseech (you),” unless the construction and meaning are unclear or disputed. And, since Sanskrit does not have mandatory surface subjects because the verb encodes the person and number of its subject, while English requires subjects to be expressed, we have had to supply pronominal subjects, which has required us on occasion to choose the gender of the subject (“he” vs. “she” vs. “it”). Occasionally too, while the elliptical style of the R̥gveda might not repeat a verb or other crucial word in proximate clauses, good English often must do so. In these cases we have repeated the crucial word without indicating the absence of this rep-etition in the Sanskrit text."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"Introduction81A rarely used sign in our translations is the asterisk (*), which indicates that the translation rests on an emendation. Since we seldom resort to emendation, the asterisk will be encountered only occasionally.B. foRmAt of the tRAnslAtionsPerhaps the most unusual feature of our translation is our decision to avoid the use of footnotes entirely. We did not begin with that idea, but several considerations led us to it. First, the notes in Geldner’s translation, especially the parallels he cites, are full and informative, and interested readers should consult them: knowledge of German is not required for tracking down the parallels. Further, this translation will appear approximately coincident with the new Witzel-Gotō translation into German, which contains annotations to verses that build on Geldner’s work. Yet another set of similar annotations seemed to us unnecessary and redundant.Second and more important, however, this decision reflects our view of the text. One of the aims of this translation is to demonstrate that the hymns are unified, structured compositions and not merely collections of single verses randomly col-lected into hymns. Our emphasis on the integrity and structure of R̥gvedic hymns, on the idea that the sūkta is the essential compositional unit, is to us the most per-suasive reason to avoid footnotes, endnotes, or running commentary. If we were to invite readers to turn away from the progress of the hymn toward notes of one kind or another, we would risk causing them to lose precisely the thing we most want our readers to have, the sense of the hymn as a compositional whole.The starkness of our presentation is softened by several different strategies, corresponding to different types of problems the text presents. First and most important, we provide introductions to each hymn. These introductions treat the overall structure of the hymn, its theme or themes, the development of the hymn, and any special features it may have—special features being defined as whatever strikes the translators as particularly noteworthy. These include intertextual con-nections with other R̥gvedic hymns, especially in the oeuvre of the same poet, spectacular rhetorical flights or poetic devices, marked metrical features, out-of-the-ordinary ritual procedures or models of rituals, little-known myths, interesting twists on well-known myths, and so forth. We also discuss the conformity or non-conformity of the hymn to the expected patterns of organization in the maṇḍala or hymn collection when relevant—where verses or even whole hymns have been added and hymns have been combined, divided, or relocated. Such changes reflect the compositional history of the text and may be important for the interpretation of the hymn.On the other hand, the discussions in the introductions generally do not treat technical linguistic details, except insofar as they impact the reader’s experience of the hymn. However, we do not apologize for regularly mentioning grammatical fea-tures of the hymn in such cases: the poets were, among other things, expert gram-marians and often deployed particular linguistic forms to subtle semantic ends. To"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"The Rigveda82remain in ignorance of this linguistic dimension of the hymns is to miss many of their most striking effects.In the introductions we usually do not engage with the considerable secondary literature on the hymn or the variant interpretations of other translators and com-mentators, including Sāyaṇa. Although study of this material has deeply affected our reading of the text, a detailed discussion of how and why we differ from other interpretations would swell our already long work to unmanageable proportions.We know of no other R̥gveda translation that systematically provides such intro-ductions for every hymn, rather than just for the famous or the famously diffi-cult hymns. We hope that these introductions will give readers sufficient guidance to proceed through the hymn without getting unduly mired in the difficult parts. We also hope that the introductions will make clear how very different R̥gvedic hymns are from one another, even when they are “about” the same subject, and will counter the general assumption that the liturgical material in the R̥gveda, which of course makes up the greater part of the text, is monotonously the same throughout. Quite the contrary: the poets obviously sought novelty not only in individual details of imagery and wording but also in their overall approach to well-worn topics, and they thought out innovative ways to frame such topics. Even the sixty-seven gāyatrī hymns to Soma Pavamāna that occupy the first half of the IXth Maṇḍala and are extremely narrowly focused on a very few steps of ritual procedure manage an astounding amount of variety within these metrical and topical limits. In fact, they might serve as a textbook of how a R̥gvedic poet deploys his skills to produce multiple, very different versions of a simple and single message.A second type of aid we provide to readers relates to a major stumbling block they will encounter in approaching the translation directly: while the original audi-ence of the R̥gveda would have been able to identify the referent in a particular verse on the basis of characteristic epithets, defining actions, or habitual associa-tions, our readers will not have the cultural knowledge that the poet and his audi-ence shared. Therefore, in many cases in which such references may not be clear to our readers, we have inserted brief bracketed identifications to situate the reader with as little fuss as possible. We have kept such bracketed additions to a minimum, since we assume that the general introduction will familiarize our readers with com-mon epithets, characteristics, and tropes, and therefore identifications of the type “Vr̥tra-smasher [=Indra]” will be unnecessary. These bracketed additions are to be differentiated from material in parentheses, supplied from context and neces-sary to complete the syntactic construction of the verse, as was discussed imme-diately above. We should note that identifying every stray referent and decoding every cryptic image, either in the introduction or the bracketed insertions, would prove to be unduly distracting—not to mention sometimes impossible—and read-ers are encouraged to let the momentum of the poetry carry them across these little perplexities. Some bracketed additions signal possible double meanings (puns or double references) of single words, expressions, or constructions in the text; the alternatives will be separated by a slash."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"Introduction83Occasionally, for hymns in which density of reference or deliberate obscurity makes each verse a challenge to decode and appreciation of the hymn as a whole depends on following the unfolding of its cryptic train of thought, we will provide a verse-by-verse exegesis in the introduction to the hymn. Again, we have kept such discursive treatment to a minimum—not only for considerations of space, but also on principled grounds: the R̥gveda is, first and foremost, poetry, and detailed para-phrase is a terrible crime to commit against poetry. It is especially a crime against this poetry, where verbal execution, rhetorical ingenuity, and deliberate complexity are central to its poetic style.The heading of each hymn will provide the maṇḍala and hymn number, fol-lowed, in parentheses, by its “Grassmann number.” Grassmann’s R̥gvedic lexi-con did not make use of the usual numbering system of maṇḍala plus hymn, but through-numbered the entire text without regard to maṇḍala (or aṣṭaka) divisions. Although this number will be irrelevant for most readers of the translation, for those who use the translation in conjunction with the Sanskrit text and the various relevant reference works, including Grassmann’s lexicon, the Grassmann number will facilitate cross-reference. (The Grassmann numbers for the first maṇḍala are not supplied, as they are identical with the hymn number in that maṇḍala.) The deity (or other element) who is the dedicand of the hymn follows the Grassmann number in the first line, almost always according to the Anukramaṇī, except when the Anukramaṇī’s identification is plainly fanciful or wrong. On the next line is the poet, again as given by the Anukramaṇī; the third line gives the number of verses in the hymn, the meter(s), and strophic arrangement, if there is one.C. hymn distRiBution By tRAnslAtoRAt the beginning of this project, we two translators each took primary responsibil-ity for approximately half the hymns of the R̥gveda and produced first and usually second drafts of them. As the project continued, we consulted with each other at every turn, passed hymns back and forth, and read each other’s translations criti-cally. In the end, however, the final version of each hymn became the responsibility of a single translator. The division of those final versions is as follows:Maṇḍala IJPB: 1, 24–25, 32, 46–47, 116–120, 157–158, 161, 164–165, 170–171SWJ: 2–23, 26–31, 33–45, 48–115, 121–156, 159–160, 162–163, 166–169, 172–191Maṇḍala IIJPB: 11–24, 27–28, 39SWJ: 1–10, 25–26, 29–38, 40–43Maṇḍala IIIJPB: 1–7, 9–29, 58–60SWJ: 8, 30–57, 61–62"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"The Rigveda84Maṇḍala IVJPB: 33–37, 42SWJ: 1–32, 38–41, 43–58Maṇḍala VJPB: 1–28, 62–78, 85SWJ: 29–61, 79–84, 86–87Maṇḍala VI: SWJMaṇḍala VIIJPB: 1–17, 48, 50–52, 60–74, 82–89SWJ: 18–47, 49, 53–59, 75–81, 90–104Maṇḍala VIII: SWJMaṇḍala IX: SWJMaṇḍala XJPB: 71–72, 81–82, 90, 108, 121, 129–130SWJ: 1–70, 73–80, 83–89, 91–107, 109–120, 122–128, 131–191"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"Volume I"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"I Maṇḍala IThe first maṇḍala of the R̥gveda is also, in part, one of its later additions, as was discussed in detail in the general introduction. Like Maṇḍala X, it consists of 191 hymns, which belong to two different strata of the text. The first fifty hymns, attrib-uted to six different groups of poets, constitute the later stratum. They are primarily in dimeter meter, sometimes arranged in tr̥cas, and the Kaṇva affiliation of a num-ber of the poets connects this section with Maṇḍala VIII.1–11 Madhuchandas Vaiśvāmitra (etc.)12–23 Medhātithi Kāṇva24–30 Śunaḥśepa Ājīgarti31–35 Hiraṇyastūpa Āṅgirasa36–43 Kaṇva Ghaura44–50 Praskaṇva KāṇvaFor the most part the poetry is not particularly inspired and has a narrow liturgical focus, especially in the first few collections. The major exception is the brief series attributed to Hiraṇyastūpa Āṅgirasa, all in trimeter meter. This sequence contains one of the most famous hymns in the R̥gveda, I.32, the clearest treatment of the Indra-Vr̥tra myth and a poetic masterwork, as well as I.33, less celebrated but dis-playing equal poetic skill.The second and far longer part of Maṇḍala I (51–191) consists of hymns attrib-uted to nine groups of poets:51–57 Savya Āṅgirasa58–64 Nodhas Gautama65–73 Parāśara Śāktya74–93 Gotama Rāhūgaṇa94–115 Kutsa Āṅgirasa (etc.)116–126 Kakṣīvant Dairghatamasa127–139 Paruchepa Daivodāsi140–164 Dīrghatamas Aucathya165–191 Agastya MaitrāvaruṇiA number of these poets have quite distinctive stylistic personalities and thematic preoccupations, and their collections contain some of the most glorious poetry in the R̥gveda. Some of the hymns are quite famous (e.g., I.164, the “riddle hymn”; "},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"I.188I.179, the dialogue between the seer Agastya and his impatiently amorous wife Lopāmudrā), but there are many treasures to be unearthed among the lesser known hymns. We refer the reader to the introductions to the various hymn collections and their individual hymns.The first ten hymns of the R̥gveda are attributed to Madhuchandas Vaiśvāmitra, with I.11 ascribed to his son or descendant Jetar Mādhuchandasa. After the opening hymn to Agni and two hymns (2–3) to the deities of the Praügaśastra litany, the remainder of the hymns are addressed to Indra, most of them relatively simple and without notable features.It is of course appropriate that the whole R̥gveda collection should begin with a hymn to the deified ritual fire as the focal point of the sacrificial system. This hymn in its relative simplicity and its clear exposition of Agni’s ritual role seems almost to have been chosen for this prominent position for pedagogical purposes. It certainly continues to serve such purposes in the modern West, where it is generally the first hymn a student of the R̥gveda encounters and from which the mysteries of Vedic Sanskrit grammar—accents, subjunctives, unexpected long vowels, variant nominal forms, and so on—and of Vedic ritual are absorbed. It is therefore not surprising that it is often assumed to be typical of R̥gvedic Agni hymns, but this is emphati-cally not the case: elsewhere in the R̥gveda Agni hymns often display especially con-torted syntax and complex imagery and glory in enigma and paradox. The choice of this particular Agni hymn to open the R̥gveda thus seems even more purposeful against the background of more standard treatments of Agni.I.1 AgniMadhuchandas Vaiśvāmitra9 verses: gāyatrīAs Oldenberg (1897) has noted, the first verse of this hymn was apparently the first verse of the R̥gveda already at the time of the composition of X.20–26, a collection that also begins agním īḷe. The two hymns that follow, I.2 and I.3, together invoke the principal deities of the three soma-pressings in a day-long soma rite. This hymn forms an appropriate opening for them, since the sacrifice is instituted first by the placement of fire, although the sacrificial fire here is not just the fire of the soma rite, since in verse 7 the poet speaks of revering the fire every day.Here, as in other hymns to Agni, the poets praise him as the deified Fire of the sacrifice, who moves between the divine and human realms. Agni is a god, and yet he is also the visible fire, accessible to humans. As both god and element, Agni is “placed to the fore” (vs. 1) because the principal fire of the sacrifice is placed in the east of the sacrificial area and because the god Agni leads the appearances of the other gods of the rite. He is a divine priest, who carries the offerings and praises of the human priests to the gods and who brings the gifts"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"I.289of the gods to mortals. Saussure describes this hymn as a “versified paradigm of Agni,” since it begins by mentioning the god’s name in various cases as the first word in the first pāda of the first five verses: accusative, nominative, instrumen-tal, dative, and again nominative (Elizarenkova 1995: 153). Displaying one of the verbal tricks R̥gvedic poets delight in, this pattern is broken by modification at the beginning of verse 6, which opens ya﻿́d aṅga﻿́, the latter word being a particle that is also a scrambling of the god’s name. The same verse ends with an epithet of Agni in the vocative, aṅgiraḥ, likewise a phonological scrambling of his name. The vocative agne is also found in three of the last four verses (vs. 8 is the excep-tion). This structure not only displays the artfulness of the poet, but perhaps also suggests the various forms of the sacrificial Fire that are analogous to the many grammatical forms of the word “fire.”1. Agni do I invoke—the one placed to the fore, god and priest of the sacrifice,the Hotar, most richly conferring treasure.2. Agni, to be invoked by ancient sages and by the present ones—he will carry the gods here to this place.3. By Agni one will obtain wealth and prosperity every day,glorious and richest in heroes.4. O Agni, the sacrifice and rite that you surround on every side—it alone goes among the gods.5. Agni, the Hotar with a poet’s purpose, the real one possessing the brightest fame,will come as a god with the gods.6. When truly you will do good for the pious man, o Agni,just that of yours is real, o Aṅgiras.7. We approach you, o Agni, illuminator in the evening, every day with our insight,bringing homage—8.

Like a father for a son, be of easy approach for us, o Agni.Accompany us for our well-being.I.2 V āyu (1–3), Indra and V āyu (4–6), Mitra and Varuṇa (7–9)Madhuchandas Vaiśvāmitra9 verses: gāyatrī, arranged in tr̥casThis and the following hymn constitute what is later called the Praügaśastra, the “yoke-pole-tip recitation,” which is the second recited litany in the morning soma-pressing. In classical śrauta ritual the śastra consists of seven sets of three verses or"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"I.290tr̥cas. In the recitation each triplet of verses is preceded by an introductory nivid, a brief declaration of the deities invoked in the recitation. Recitations typically combine verses from different hymns, or they may require that the form of the R̥gvedic verses be recast, but in this case the nivids need only be added to produce the recitation. These two hymns, therefore, are already fit for the classical performance of the soma ritual.As Insler (2002) has shown, the sequence of gods in I.2–3 represents the sequence of gods who receive cups of soma during the soma-pressing day. The rite reflected in the hymns was neither a version of the soma ritual represented in the Family Books of the R̥gveda nor that of the classical ritual, although it comes fairly close to the latter. Rather, these two hymns represent a transitional period in the develop-ment of the soma rite as it moved toward its classical form.In the R̥gvedic rite, Vāyu was the first of the gods to receive the soma and there-fore the first tr̥ca of I.2 is dedicated to him. In the classical rite, the recipients of soma at the Morning Pressing are, for the most part, dual divinities. The first pair is Indra and Vāyu, to whom our second tr̥ca (vss. 4–6) is dedicated, and the second pair is Mitra and Varuṇa, addressed in our third tr̥ca (vss. 7–9).In I.3 the first tr̥ca is dedicated to the two Aśvins, who are the third set of dual divinities at the classical Morning Pressing. In the classical rite there are also morn-ing offerings to Indra and to the All Gods. Those gods are mentioned in the next two tr̥cas (Indra, vss. 4–6; the All Gods, vss. 7–9), but at the time of the composition of these hymns, these verses probably refer to the midday and evening rites rather than to the morning offering.In most of the Family Books of the R̥gveda, Indra alone is the principal at the Midday Pressing, though especially in Maṇḍala III there is evidence that the Maruts have joined Indra as dedicands, as in the classical rite. The Maruts are not mentioned in our hymn, however, and were probably not a part of the soma rite for which these hymns were composed. Although the R̥bhus and Indra were the principal recipients of soma at the Third Pressing for most of the R̥gvedic period, the R̥bhus are absent from this hymn, indicating that, as also in the classical rite, they had already all but disappeared from the soma rite. Rather, in this hymn and in the classical rite, there is a soma offering to the All Gods in the evening. This association of the All Gods with the Third Pressing must be fairly old, since the Brāhmaṇa texts refer to the Third Pressing as vaiśvadevyam “belonging to the All Gods.” The last tr̥ca (vss. 10–12) of I.3 is to Sarasvatī, who does not receive an offering in the Third Pressing at the classical rite and has only a limited presence in the R̥gveda. However, she likely did receive soma at the Third Pressing in the period of this transitional rite.For further on this śastra and the order of divinities addressed, see the other hymns with this structure, I.23 and II.41, as well as I.139 in part. It is not clear why the śastra has been split into two hymns just in this case.The actual content of the two hymns is quite simple. In I.2 the first two tr̥cas to Vāyu and Indra and Vāyu respectively announce that the soma has been pressed and urge the gods to come to our sacrifice. The tr̥ca to Mitra and Varuṇa is slightly more interesting, in that it mentions the frequently conjoined notions of “insight”"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"I.391(dhī́), “skill” (da﻿́kṣa), and “resolve” or “purpose” (kra﻿́tu), the three elements neces-sary to conceive and carry out an action.1.

In the first (vss. 1–3) the poet calls on Indra to come to our sacrifice and consume our soma. In the last (vss. 7–9) the poet again offers Indra soma and recounts Indra’s past deeds inspired by his soma-drinking, with hopes for similar future exploits.The middle tr̥ca (vss. 4–6) is a different matter and displays some anxiety about the poet’s exclusive focus on Indra—“putting all his eggs in one basket,” in the English idiom. In verse 4, immediately after the peremptory command to Indra, “come here!” the poet orders himself (or another person?) to “go away!”—to seek out Indra and inquire who he [=Indra, in our view] favors as a comrade, in an indirect question with a curious mixture of direct and indirect syntax. The ques-tion is also rhetorical: the poet expects Indra to favor him, and in verses 5 and 6 he defends the exclusive partnership against unnamed cavilers, by asserting that having Indra alone on his side is a good bargain. The defensive tone of this tr̥ca may seem an odd feature of the first full hymn to Indra in the R̥gveda, but it does strike a note that we will meet again and again in the collection—the worried hope that Indra will indeed choose to attend our sacrifice and that he will extend his help to us alone.1. The one who assumes a good form for help—like a good milk-cow for a cow-milker—do we call upon every day.2. Come here to our pressings. Drink of the soma, soma-drinker.It’s a rich man’s exhilaration that gives cows.3. Then might we know your favors up close.Do not look past us—come here!4. Go away! Ask Indra, spirited and indestructible, attentive to poetic inspiration,who is your choice from among your comrades.5. And let scorners say to us, “You have missed out on the restin placing your friendship in Indra alone.”6. But (even) a stranger—(indeed all) the separate peoples—would say we have a good portion, o wondrous one.(For) we would be in the protection of Indra alone.7. Bring the swift to the swift—(bring soma), the glory of the sacrifice, causing exhilaration to men,exhilarating our comrade [=Indra] in its flight.8.

The favors especially desired are help and support in battles and raids and the victory prizes won in them (see vss. 3–4, 9–10), and the hymn ends (vs. 10) on a slightly worried note, with a reference to our enemies among men.Structurally, the hymn divides into two halves. In the first (vss. 1–5), the poet addresses his fellow priests, commanding them to sing the songs, pointing to the prepared soma, and declaring what Indra can do. In the second half (vss. 6–10) he turns to Indra himself, reminding the god what the offerings will do for him. The birth of Indra (vs. 6) refers not only to his ancient birth but also to his appearance at this sacrifice. The single day in which he achieves his full strength is the sacrificial day, so that by the end of the day, he has the power to help the sacrificers.1. Here—come here—sit down: sing forth to Indra,o comrades, whose vehicles are praise songs—2. To the first among many, having control of desirable things,to Indra when the soma is pressed.3.

The Anukramaṇī ascription of the verses to a combination of Indra and the Maruts is reproduced in the above heading, but it is almost certainly wrong—though the confusion generated by the hymn makes the error pardonable. The Maruts do not appear to figure in the hymn at all, and, though Indra does, there are other divine figures in some of the verses assigned to him. As often, the hymn jumps back and forth from 2nd- to 3rd-person reference and from past to present time, but in this case the jumps are particularly disorient-ing and the overall structure hard to discern.Modern attempts at interpretation generally begin with the Vala myth and the main divine personages therein, Indra and the Aṅgirases, his singer-assistants in this myth. The myth is most clearly alluded to in verse 5, the central verse (espe-cially if vs. 10 is considered to be a mere variant of parallel vs. 9), and we may see here an interesting structural contrast to the omphalos hymn: instead of embedding the mystery in the middle verse and leading up to and away from it with clearer material, the poet here may have designed the middle verse as the key to the many questions posed by the diffuse fragments surrounding it and a motif in which to integrate them.In any case verse 5 presents us with Indra finding the hidden cows within a stronghold with the help of an unnamed group, who must be the Aṅgirases. In our view this myth does provide the thematic backdrop for the whole hymn and is alluded to directly (or as directly as it gets) also in verses 6 and 8. But most of the rest of the hymn treats the ritual re-creation of Indra’s releasing the dawns from the Vala cave—namely the rising of the sun, the kindling of the ritual fire, and Indra’s journey to the early-morning sacrifice, and the most enigmatic verses refer, in our view, to Agni—not, as in other interpretations, to the sun or to Indra.A brief and tentative synopsis: the first two verses, parallel in structure, depict the simultaneous hitching up of the sun (vs. 1) and Indra’s chariot (vs. 2) for their"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"I.696respectively daily journeys. These verses are set in the present moment. Verse 3 is structurally paired with verse 7 in the architecture of the hymn; both are addressed to an unidentified 2nd sg. referent—in our view Agni, who is kindled at dawn (vs. 3) at the same time as Indra arrives at the sacrifice (vs. 7). Verse 3 is set in the mythic past, perhaps at Agni’s first kindling by the Aṅgirases, an event also presented in verse 4, while verse 7 returns us to the present. (Verse 3 also contains an absolutely baffling 2nd plural vocative, “o young men,” embedded within a verse with entirely 2nd singular reference. Short of emendation, there is little to be done with it, though it may refer to the plural subjects of verse 4, the fire-priests, who kindled the embry-onic Agni.) Verse 5 provides the Vala-myth clue, and the remainder of the verses meld a mythic account of the rituals of dawn with reference to the ritual of the present moment.1. They hitch up the coppery, ruddy (sun) that circles around the ones [=stars?] standing still.The lights are alight in heaven.2. They hitch his beloved fallow bays to his chariot on opposite sides,the bold pair of sorrels, conveyors of the superior man [=Indra].3. You young men—making a beacon for that without beacon and an ornament for that without ornament,you [=Agni] were born together with the dawns.4. Certainly, just after that they once again roused his embryonic state [=kindled the fire] according to his nature,acquiring for themselves a name worthy of the sacrifice.5. Along with the (ritual-)conveyors [=Aṅgirases] who break even the stronghold, o Indra,you discovered the ruddy (cattle) even though in hiding.6. As those seeking the gods (bellow) their thought, the songs have bellowed to the finder of goods,great and famous.7. Since you [=Agni] will come to sight along with Indra, having joined together with the fearless one,(you two are) the delighting pair who share the same luster.8. Together with the irreproachable, heaven-bound (Aṅgirases), the battler chants mightily,together with Indra’s beloved troops.9. From there or from the luminous realm of heaven come here, o earth-circling one.The songs converge on him.10. We beseech Indra for gain from here, the earthly realm, or from heaven,or from the great airy space."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"I.797I.7 IndraMadhuchandas Vaiśvāmitra10 verses: gāyatrīA relatively simple praise of Indra, focused especially on his possession of the mace (vss. 2c, 3c, 7b) and his help in battles and contests (vss. 4–6). Indra’s mythologi-cal exploits receive cursory treatment in verse 3. A more insistent theme emerges toward the end, with an accumulation of loaded terms for potentially rival groups of people: kr̥ṣṭī́ḥ “communities” (8b), carṣanīnā́m “domains” (9a), pa﻿́ñca kṣitīnā́m “the five peoples” (9c), ja﻿́nebhyaḥ “men” (10b), culminating in the hope that Indra will leave those rivals behind and become exclusively ours.But one can say that the real focus of the hymn is Indra’s name. The poem, especially its first half, is characterized by the insistent repetition of the name, with “Indra” as the first word in verses 1–5 and also in verse-internal lines 1b, 1c, 2c, and 5b. After verse 5, the poet noticeably pauses in verses 6–8, using the name only once. Even so, that one occurrence, which is in 7b, is in a marked position as the middle word of the middle line of the middle verse of this three-verse section. This pause or break accents the reappearance of the name twice in rapid succession at the begin-ning of 9c and 10a. Thematically, the emphasis on the name of Indra underscores the poet’s desire that the person of Indra, independent of all else, be present at his sacrifice.Verse 6 contains a somewhat obscure request that Indra “uncover yonder pot.” “Yonder pot” probably refers to anything distant that contains what the poet and his people want or need. A reasonable parallel is VIII 23.29bc, tva﻿́ṃ no go﻿́matīr íśaḥ, maho﻿́ rāya﻿́ḥ sātím agne a﻿́pā vr̥dhi “Uncover for us refreshments consisting of cows and the winning of great weath, o Agni,” with the same 2nd-sg. imperative a﻿́pā vr̥dhi “uncover” and a desirable object.1. Just to Indra have the singers bellowed aloft, to Indra the chanters with their chants,to Indra their voices.2. Indra, close-linked with his two fallow bays, (is mounted) on the two yoked by speech;Indra is the golden wielder of the mace.3. Indra made the sun mount in heaven for the long view.He propelled apart the rock with the cows (inside).4. O Indra, help us when prizes and stakes of thousands (are set),as the mighty one with mighty forms of help.5.

Indra do we summon for you from the men all around.Let him be exclusively ours.I.8 IndraMadhuchandas Vaiśvāmitra10 verses: gāyatrīThe first part of the hymn (vss. 1–4) asks Indra for help in battle and for the wealth (both material and in manpower) to make success in combat possible. With Indra’s help, the sacrificer and his men become almost aspects of Indra himself. As he is the “smasher of obstacles,” so they will “keep obstacles hemmed in.” They take up Indra’s mace (vs. 3) and become his “hammers,” which smash their enemies. They acquire Indra as their yokemate (vs. 4).The second part (vss. 5–10) celebrates the extent of Indra’s power and the ben-efits it brings to the men who attain him and it. This theme is first expressed rela-tively straightforwardly (though with suppressed syntactic connection) in verses 5–6. But in verse 7 Indra’s vastness is conveyed by a striking image, syntactically untethered, where his cheek and his gullet are compared to the wide, swollen sea. This image introduces the final three verses (8–10), each of which begins evā́ hí “in just this way, in the same way.” In our view the underlying “same” is Indra’s vast extent—both physically, in the images of verse 7, and metaphorically, in the immense liberality (vs. 8) and help (vs. 9) he bestows on us. The final verse (10), though introduced with the same expression, turns to our obligations to Indra, and, again by implication, it is suggested that our praises of Indra are as vast as his gifts to us.The hymn is characterized throughout by chaining between verses, often not overtly marked.1. O Indra, bring wealth here—winning, conquering, ever overpowering,highest—for our help—2. (Wealth) by which we will keep obstacles hemmed in, hemmed in by bare-knuckled fighting,hemmed in (by fighting) on horseback, when we are helped by you."},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"I.9993.

In the same way those things beloved of him, praise song and recitation, are to be proclaimed,for Indra to drink the soma.I.9 IndraMadhuchandas Vaiśvāmitra10 verses: gāyatrīThe “message” of this hymn is the standard one: Indra is urged to drink of our soma and enjoy our praise songs and in return to provide us with the usual good things. This relation of reciprocity is nicely conveyed stylistically by complementary paired repetitions. For example, in verse 2 Indra is to be “sent surging” to the soma (2a), while the same verb is to be supplied for the soma’s movement to Indra (2b). Though this verb √sr̥j is an unusual choice to describe Indra’s locomotion, it is a standard idiom applied to soma’s progress, especially in the Soma Maṇḍala (IX). (See here also the songs sent surging in verse 4.) Similarly “spur on” in verses 5–6 with “us” once as goal (vs. 5) and once as direct object (vs. 6), and verse 10 where both Indra and the chant directed to him are characterized as “lofty,” after two occurrences of “lofty” applied to fame (vss. 7–8).For readers interested in comparative Indo-European poetics, the most nota-ble feature of the hymn is an instance of the famous, but relatively rare, formula “imperishable fame” (śra﻿́vaḥ. . . a﻿́kṣitam) in verse 7, where the two words are found in separate pādas (b and c). The resonance of this formula and the concept behind it may account for the near-exact repetition of the “place fame in us” expression in verses 7–8."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"I.101001.

Contrary to the usual arrangement, the gāyatrī hymns of this collection (1–9) are placed as a group together before these final two hymns in anuṣṭubh.Though the hymn displays the usual reciprocal balance between what we offer to Indra and what we ask him for, the poet focuses more on the verbal offerings we make than on the soma. Songs, praise hymns, and recitations are mentioned in"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"I.10101verses 1, 3–5, 9, 12—with a bit of thematic ring composition linking the first verse and the first half of the last one (12ab).As in the last hymn (I.9) reciprocal actions are posited of Indra and his wor-shipers. For example in verse 4ab Indra is ordered to respond to our verbal praises by verbal actions of his own. In 4cd/5ab we first command Indra to strengthen us and our ritual, and then we produce a recitation meant to strengthen Indra in turn. We both urge him to enjoy our companionship (5d) and beg him to give us his (6a). The most ingenious example of reciprocal action is found in verse 7, in the ambiguous form tvā́dātam. The topic is the Vala myth and the glory that accrues from opening the Vala cave and driving out the cows. Indra of course is the major actor in this myth, and tvā́dātam íd ya﻿́śaḥ can be interpreted as “(that) glory is acquired only by you” (based on the idiom ā́ √dā “take, acquire”). But Indra also shared the action with the Aṅgirases, and the myth is also often rein-terpreted as engaging human priests in its ritual re-enactment, so that the same phrase can also mean “(that) glory is given only by you” (with the simplex √dā “give”). Either interpretation is morphologically, grammatically, and contextually possible.There is otherwise little remarkable about the hymn, though in several verses the poet echoes passages found elsewhere, which he twists to a different, sometimes opposite meaning (cf. 7b with III.40.6, 8b with I.176.1, and 9ab with VII.32.5).1.

Cry out to them, applaud them, and bellow to them.Together with us, good Indra, make our formulation and our sacrifice strong.5. A strengthening recitation is to be proclaimed to Indra who provides many fulfillments,so that the able one will take pleasure in our soma-pressings and in our companionship.6. Just him do we beg for companionship, him for wealth, him for an abundance of good heroes.He is the able one, and he will be able for us—Indra who distributes the goods.7.

Several famous deeds of Indra are men-tioned (Vala verse 5, Śuṣṇa verse 7), and our praises and Indra’s countergifts are celebrated. These general themes are similar to those found in the Indra hymns of the ancestral Madhuchandas.The poet is fond of etymological figures: “best charioteer of charioteers” (1c), “the conqueror who is not to be conquered” (2d), “with your tricks. . . the tricky. . . ” (7a), and the probably etymologically unrelated but phonologically similar ma﻿́ṃhate magha﻿́m “grants the bounty” (3d).1.

The Medhātithi First Maṇḍala hymns here are all in gāyatrī meter, save for some stray verses in I.17 and 23. They are dedicated to a variety of deities; in fact, each hymn has a different divinity or set of divinities. The poet has a particular penchant for dedicands in pairs (Indra and Varuṇa I.17, Agni and the Maruts I.19, Indra and Agni I.21) or groups (Viśve Devāḥ I.14, R̥bhus I.20, variety of divinities I.13, 15, 22–23), and in the group hymns a high proportion follow particular ritual litanies: Āprī (I.13), R̥tugrahas (I.15), Praügaśastra (I.23).The style and contents of these hymns are for the most part elementary, even banal, and there is generally a strong focus on purely ritual matters, to the virtual exclusion of description, mythological references, praise, and even requests for aid and gifts. In short, a poetically uninspiring collection, but the information it gives about the early shape of later ritual litanies is valuable.I.12 AgniMedhātithi Kāṇva12 verses: gāyatrīThis simple hymn has a high proportion of pādas repeated from other hymns, and in some ways seems to have been assembled rather than composed.

The All God theme is cleverly introduced in the first verse by parceling out the phrase “with all these gods,” a word at the beginning of each pāda (an effect clumsily reproduced in transla-tion), and an enumeration of some of the most important of the gods is given in verse 3, But otherwise (save for mention of Indra and Vāyu, the recipients of the first soma offering, in vs. 10) the gods are an undifferentiated group and backgrounded to Agni.The poet does not forget his own, however. He mentions his kin-group, the Kaṇvas, twice (vss. 2, 5) as the ritualists preparing the sacrifice."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"I.151061.

(See further remarks in the introductions to those hymns.) The divine order and the priestly counterparts are the following.

It has been convincingly argued by Renou (1950 [1978]) that as the word r̥tú was reinter-preted from merely “sequence, turn” to “season,” the number of divinities in this litany was increased to twelve to match the months of the year by the insertion of a simple placeholder.

The two gods are addressed together, and there is no mention of the dis-tinctive qualities of either god. Only in verse 5, the middle verse, are the gods sepa-rated, and even there the structures in which they appear are parallel and colorless. In contrast to the predictable and banal contents, the syntax of the hymn is surprisingly problematic. There are a number of ellipses that cannot be reliably filled (see, e.g., the parenthetic additions in verses 3–6) and syntactic clashes that are difficult to rational-ize (e.g., in verse 4, whose translation skates over some of the problems). The poet may have been trying to inject some surprise into a tired poetic assignment.1. I choose the aid of Indra and Varuṇa, the sovereign kings.They will be gracious to such as us.2.

Though Brahmaṇaspati is a well-estab-lished divinity and an allo-form of the even better established Br̥haspati, Sadasaspati “Lord of the Seat” occurs only here (and once elsewhere, in Medhātithi’s oeuvre, in the variant epithet sádaspáti used of the dual divinities Indra and Agni, I.21.5). Thus “lord of the seat” is not a separate divinity, but the functional descriptor of another god. In our view the god in question is Agni, and the hymn balances the two major constituents of the sacrifice: the verbal portion overseen by the Lord of the Sacred Formulation and the physical portion embodied by Agni, the Lord of the (Ritual) Seat and the conduit for oblations to the gods.The first part actually says little about the mastery of verbal powers—except by repeating the name Brahmaṇaspati and, strikingly, by calling on that god to make the unnamed poet “a Kakṣīvant,” one of the most skilled of R̥gvedic poets, to whom I.116–126 are ascribed. (Unfortunately, Brahmaṇaspati did not succeed in effecting this transformation, at least judging from the banality of Medhātithi’s preserved poems.) Otherwise these first five verses call on the god to help and protect us, espe-cially from hostile speech (vs. 3). Perhaps because the epithet “Lord of the Seat” is a sort of riddle, the second part of the hymn is more explicit about the activities of the divinity who has this title, and the descriptions in verses 7 and, especially, 8 make Agni the clear referent. The final verse (9) begins with another epithet, Narāśaṃsa, also used of Agni elsewhere, as is the adjective “most extensive” (because of the spreading of his smoke), and the final phrase “like one besieging the seat of heaven” can refer to the rising of this smoke toward the sky, taking the oblations with it.Though, as is generally the case with Medhātithi’s work, the phraseology of the hymn is not particularly impressive, and it contains a number of phrases borrowed from other hymns, the complementarity of the two parts and the handling of the riddling second half make this a more pleasing composition than some of the oth-ers in this group.1. O Lord of the Sacred Formulation, make him a possessor of soma, a sounding [/sun-like] one,(make him) a Kakṣīvant, who is (also) descended from fire-priests.2. He who is rich, who smashes afflictions, while finding goods and increasing prosperity,let him accompany us, he who is powerful.3.

In fact the pairing exists in this hymn only in its refrain; the first two pādas of each verse are directed at one or the other: Agni in verses 1, 2, and 9, the Maruts in vss. 4–8. All of the Marut verses are structured as definitional relative clauses beginning with yé “which ones, those who,” following the model of hymns like II.12, and the contents are typical Marut themes. Verse 3 is a curious exception, for pāda b names the All Gods (or “all the gods”) though in a context and with a predicate (pāda a) appropriate to the Maruts—and beginning with the same yé. Medhātithi also identifies the Maruts with the All Gods elsewhere (I.23.10).1. Toward this pleasing ceremony you are called, for its protection.– With the Maruts, o Agni, come hither.2. For no god nor mortal is beyond the will of you who are great.– With the Maruts, o Agni, come hither.3.

This last achievement is stated clearly in the final verse (8; see also 2c, 5), while verses 2–6 enumerate the separate actions that led to it. Several features give shape to the basic list structure of the hymn. The name of the divine dedicands appears only once, in the exact middle of the hymn (vs. 4c), and the adjective “best conferring treasures” of 1c is opened out into its phrasal syntactic equivalent “confer treasures” in verse 7, providing a loose ring.1. This praise here has been made for the godly breed by the inspired poets by mouth—a praise that best confers treasures.2.

The two interior verses (2–3) use the lexeme prá √śaṃs “pro-claim, eulogize,” which is later specialized for royal panegyric (the praśastis of classical inscriptions, etc.), and it may have some of that tone here as well. (For royal associations of the lexeme in the R̥gveda, see Jamison 2007: 146–48.) In verse 3 the object of the praśasti is the word mitrá; unlike most commentators, we do not believe that this refers to the god Mitra, but rather to the abstract “alliance” that Mitra embodies, a sense that would be appropriate to an official and royal context. The alliance we wish to proclaim may be (as we have translated it here) the alliance between the two gods, joining two distinct aspects of Vedic religion, though it could also be their alliance with us.Verses 5–6 then suggest what these allies can do for us; the final verse is intro-duced by the pregnant phrase “by this truth,” characteristic of the later satya-kriyā or “truth-formulation.” Here it presumably refers to the whole preceding hymn as an expression of truth.1. I call Indra and Agni here. For those two alone we desire a praise hymn.They are the best soma-drinkers of soma.2. Proclaim them at the sacrifices; embellish Indra and Agni, o men.Sing to them in songs.3.

As Oldenberg points out (1888: 224–25; Noten ad loc.), both hymns can easily be broken down into smaller hymns, which then conform to the principles of arrangement in the Saṃhitā. The clear changes of divinity support the division of this hymn into smaller units, although Oldenberg’s divisions do not altogether match those of the Anukramaṇī; Oldenberg’s are clearly superior: 1–4, 5–8, 9–12, 13–15, 16–18, 19–21.Like the immediately preceding hymn, the first sections of this one are pri-marily devoted to invocation of the various gods: the Aśvins in verses 1–4, Savitar in 5–8. In a slight variation on this theme, in verses 9–12 Agni is called upon to bring Tvaṣṭar and the Wives of the Gods to the sacrifice; this divine group figures in a number of minor rites in the Soma Sacrifice (especially the Third Pressing) and elsewhere. The next three verses (13–15) concern Heaven and Earth; the middle verse (14) is the only truly enigmatic one in the hymn. The final six verses (16–21) consist of two tr̥cas to Viṣṇu, which, both by the principles of arrangement and by their phraseology, should be considered two separate hymns. There is no obvious reason, either ritual or mythological, for collecting these particular short compositions in a single super-hymn. As Oldenberg argues, the grouping and order seem to be entirely mechanical.1. Awaken the two who hitch up early in the morning. Let the Aśvins come here,to drink of this soma.2. Those two possessing a good chariot who are the best charioteers, both gods who touch heaven,the Aśvins we invoke.3.

Here the separate tr̥cas follow the order of a structured recitation in the Morning Pressing, later called the Praügaśastra. Other instances of this litany are found in R̥gveda I.2–3 and II.41, and to some extent I.139; for a detailed discussion of the Praügaśastra see the introduction to I.2.This hymn varies somewhat from the standard Praügaśastra, which has the fol-lowing divinities in the following order: Vāyu (1), Indra-Vāyu (2), Mitra-Varuṇa (3), Aśvins (4), Indra (5), the All Gods (6), Sarasvatī (7). This hymn lacks the Aśvins in position 4, but in position 5 Indra, instead of being alone, is accompanied by the Maruts, and though the following tr̥ca (vss. 10–12) is ascribed by the Anukramaṇī to the All Gods, it is dominated by the Maruts. Since offering to Indra with the Maruts is made only in the Midday Pressing, and to the Aśvins in the Morning Pressing, perhaps this version of the litany is shifting its focus to the Midday Pressing and to the ritual innovation that extended offering to the Maruts, rather than just Indra, at that pressing. (See further discussion in the introduction to I.165.) Pūṣan is also added after the All Gods (position 6), and instead of the divine river Sarasvatī in position 7 we find the functionally similar Waters.The first three verses to the waters (16–18) bring the Praügaśastra proper to an end. The last six verses (19–24) are a supplement, in a somewhat Atharvan style, treating the waters as healers and removers of transgressions. These functions of the waters bring to mind the “Final Bath” or avabhr̥tha in classical śrauta ritual, in which the sacrificer and his wife wash each other at the conclusion of the sacri-fice, and these verses may have been included in this hymn in order to encompass the entire soma-pressing day, from the first offering to Vāyu to the final cleansing. The middle four verses of this sequence (20–23) are also found in a hymn to the waters, X.9.6–9, and the introductory and final verses here (19 and 24) may have been added to create two triplets for this tr̥ca hymn.As in other of Medhātithi’s hymns, the actual contents are fairly simplistic, consisting primarily of invocations to the various gods and invitations to the soma-drinking. Perhaps the most interesting sequence is the tr̥ca to Pūṣan (vss. 13–15), who finds the hidden king and is urged to drive him here “like lost live-stock.” Most commentators identify this king as Soma, but the thematics and phraseology—particularly the notion of finding and returning a hidden deity—are"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"I.23117much more characteristic of Agni, and we have interpreted these verses in that way. Whether the king is Agni or Soma, however, it is not clear what this snatch of myth is doing here in this hymn, though Pūṣan’s ability to locate lost cows is proverbial.1. Sharp are the soma drinks—come here. Here are the pressings mixed with milk.Vāyu, drink those set forth.2. Both gods who touch the heaven, Indra and Vāyu, do we call,to drink of this soma.3.

He argues that irregularities in the placement of I.25, 27, and 30 can be explained if these hymns are composites of several hymns.The story of Śunaḥśepa, the putative poet of these hymns, appears in Aitareya Brāhmaṇa VII 13–18 and Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra XV 17–27. According to the story, King Hariścandra had begged Varuṇa for a son and promised that if Varuṇa gave him one, he would sacrifice his son to the god. A boy, Rohita, was born to Hariścandra, but the king managed to delay the sacrifice of his son until Rohita reached adulthood. When the king could no longer avoid the inevitable sacrifice, he told Rohita that he was to be sacrificed to Varuṇa. But Rohita refused to be the sacrificial victim and departed the kingdom. As a result Hariścandra was struck by dropsy in punishment for not performing the sacrifice.In his travels Rohita eventually came upon a poor brahmin named Ajīgarta, who sold his son Śunaḥ śepa to Rohita to be a substitute sacrificial victim. Rohita returned with Śunaḥ śepa and Varuṇa accepted the substitution of Śunaḥ śepa for Rohita. But when Śunaḥ śepa was bound to the stake and was about to be killed, he appealed to the gods by reciting I.24.1 to Prajāpati, the god Ka (cf. 1a ka﻿́sya “of which (god)?” and 1c ka﻿́ḥ “who?”), 24.2 to Agni, 24.3–5 to Savitar, 24.6–15 and I.25 to Varuṇa, I.26 and 27.1–12 to Agni, 27.13 to the All Gods, I.29 and 30.1–16 to Indra, 30.17–19 to the Aśvins, and 30.20–22 to Dawn. Each time Śunaḥ śepa recited a verse, one of his bonds was loosened and Hariścandra’s belly became smaller. With the last verse Śunaḥ śepa was free of his bonds and Hariścandra was free of disease."},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"I.24119Although I.24 refers directly to Śunaḥśepa and to his rescue by Varuṇa, the story of Śunaḥśepa in the form in which it told in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa does not fully correspond to that at the basis of any of the hymns in this collection. Probably closer to the R̥gvedic version is that alluded to in the Yajurveda. Taittirīya Saṃhitā V 2.1.3 and Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā XIX 11 say simply that Śunaḥśepa had been seized by Varuṇa but then rescued himself from Varuṇa’s bonds.I.24 Agni, Savitar, and VaruṇaŚunaḥ śepa Ājīgarti15 verses: triṣṭubh 1–2, 6–15; gāyatrī 3–5This hymn consists of three sections in alternating meters, with each section devoted to a different god. The first two verses in triṣṭubh invoke Agni, then verses 3–5 in gāyatrī address Savitar, and finally the remainder of the hymn, once more in triṣṭubh, is dedicated to Varuṇa. Despite this variation the hymn is a coherent composition and not a composite of three hymns wielded together (cf. Oldenberg 1888: 226 n.). Formal evidence for its unity is that Aditi, the goddess who represents Innocence or Guiltlessness, appears in verses 1 and 2 and then again in the last verse, verse 15, creating a ring.Apparently the poet and his people have been afflicted in some way. In the later Veda dropsy is associated with Varuṇa, and so it could be this or another disease that troubles the sacrificers. The poet believes that the cause of their affliction is that Varuṇa is angry with them for some offense they have committed (cf. vs. 11) and therefore has “bound” them in the bonds of misery.The first god invoked is Agni, whose presence introduces the ritual that addresses the plight of the sacrificers. The poet already signals the purpose of his hymn and rite by asking which god will return his people to Aditi, to the “Guiltlessness” that the goddess embodies. Aditi is the mother of the Ādityas, and therefore reference to her leads to mention of the poet’s own mother and father. The poet implies that because of some offense he might die before his father and mother. That would be tragic and unnatural, since children should not predecease their parents.There follow the three verses to Savitar, which also mention the god Bhaga “Fortune.” Both Savitar and Bhaga are Ādityas, so the poet is still moving toward Varuṇa, the greatest of the Ādityas. In verse 3 the poet asks Savitar for a “por-tion” (bhāga﻿́) of the wealth that Savitar can bring, and this leads in verse 4 to mention of the god Bhaga. In verse 4 the priest performing the rite appears to embody Bhaga because he attains adveṣa﻿́ḥ “freedom from hostility.” This “hostil-ity” represents everything that stands in the way of the life and prosperity of the poet, but it also prefigures the anger of Varuṇa, from which the poet hopes for release. The presence of Savitar, who is associated with night, might also suggest"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"I.24120that the rite for which the hymn was composed took place in the evening. In verse 10 also the poet refers to the constellation of Ursa Major and to the moon. But Varuṇa’s rule is not restricted to the night, since the poet also says that Varuṇa creates the path for the sun (vs. 8). In verse 7 too the crest of the nyāgrodha or banyan tree, which sends down aerial roots, may refer to the sun. This would explain the description of these aerial roots as “beacons” that take root within humans as the light of inspiration (7c). In verse 12a the rule of Varuṇa over both night and day is reflected in the truth spoken to the poet at night and by day. It is a truth toward which the poet’s own intuition—perhaps that light received from Varuṇa—has struggled (12b).However, the poet’s concern is not as much with the cosmic roles of Varuṇa as it is with the bondage Varuṇa has inflicted on the poet and his people. The poet looks back to Śunaḥ śepa as an example of someone who was bound and then released by Varuṇa. He even merges his own bonds and the bonds of Śunaḥ śepa: in 13d the poet’s plea to Varuṇa to “release the fetters” refers to Śunaḥ śepa’s bonds and to the present bonds that afflict him. Once free of those bonds, the poet will be restored to guiltlessness, under the protection of the commandment of Varuṇa (vs. 15).1. The dear name of which god, of which of the immortals, shall we recall?Who will return us to great Aditi [/Guiltlessness]? I would see my father and mother.2. We will recall the dear name of the god Agni, of the first of the immortals.He will return us to great Aditi. I would see my father and mother.3. O god Savitar, master of desirable things,we implore you for a portion, o you who ever give.4. For also the one who is Fortune [/Bhaga], laboring correctly for you ahead of reproach,has received freedom from hatred in his hands.5. We would reach upward to (a portion) of that apportioned by Bhaga through your help,in order to take hold of the head of wealth.6. Yet not even birds flying yonder have attained your rule, power, or fervor,nor have these waters moving without blinking, nor those [=the gods] who confound the wind’s formless mass.7. In (the airy realm) without a base, King Varuṇa of purified skill firmly holds the crest of the (nyāgrodha) tree on high.They [=its trunks] reach downward, their base above. They should be set down as beacons within us.8. Since King Varuṇa made a broad path for the sun to follow,he has created two feet for the footless (sun) to give it support, and he exorcises even what pierces the heart."},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"I.251219.

One indication of this division is that verse 12 reads like a concluding verse. Thematically, however, the two parts of the hymn both emphasize the sovereignty of Varuṇa, and the hymn as a whole begins (3a) and ends (19b) with an appeal for his mercy. So if this is a composite hymn, it is nonetheless a coherent one.One repeated pattern in this hymn is the movement from Varuṇa’s distance, which can mark his displeasure, to his closeness. The first tr̥ca, for example, fears"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"I.25122the offense that the poet might have given Varuṇa and the anger of the god. In the second the poet speaks of his songs, which will dispel the god’s fury, and his hopes that he will bring Varuṇa near (5). He concludes that Mitra and Varuṇa are never far from one who serves them (6c). The closeness of Varuṇa is again the theme of the fifth tr̥ca (vss. 13–15), which opens the second part of the hymn. Varuṇa first appears in majesty, wearing the mantle of a king (13a), but at the same time, like a king, he is also very near. His spies are everywhere (13c) and no deceit or evildoing escapes his attention (14). The last verse of the tr̥ca combines his majesty and his presence. In verse 15 the poet repeats ā́ “here” three times at the end of each of its three pādas, culminating in the unexpected and dramatic assertion that Varuṇa ’s glory is “right here within our bellies.” We understand the presence of Varuṇa ’s glory in the belly as signifying the radical closeness of Varuṇa, but there are other ways of interpreting it. The reference to “bellies” has led Geldner, for example, to understand this as a healing hymn for dropsy, a disease associated with Varuṇa. The final plea for release from fetters, which occurs also as the last verse of I.24, offers support for this interpretation. Nevertheless, we regard it as unlikely. It does not suit the context of verse 15, and the fact that verse 21 is the final verse of the preceding hymn implies that it is a formal conclusion, not a critical thematic statement.The same movement from distance to proximity also occurs in the sixth tr̥ca. In its first verse (16) the poet says his insights go far away, looking for Varuṇa; in its last (18) the poet sees Varuṇa and his chariot here on earth. The middle verse is obscure, although in one way or another it describes the movement of the god and the poet toward one another, since the poet asks the god to come to an agreement with him. The “honey” the poet serves is probably not soma, even though soma is often called “honey” or “honeyed.” Since the poet begins the tr̥ca with a reference to his “insights,” the honey in verse 17 is more likely his song, for speech also can be “honeyed” (cf. I.78.5). More difficult is the honey that is brought to the poet by the god. Perhaps it is the rain, which can also be “honey” (III.62.16, V.69.2ab), and perhaps too the waters and the rain are the visible signs of Varuṇa’s presence that the poet sees according to verse 18. Varuṇa’s control over the rain is an aspect of his kingship: compare VII.49.3, “In the middle of which king Varuṇa travels, looking down upon the truth and falsehood of the peoples, / those, clear and pure, that drip honey—let those waters, goddesses, help me here.”1. Even if every day we confound your commandment, o god Varuṇa,as clans (do their king’s commandment),2. Do not subject us to your deadly weapon when you are enraged,nor to your fury when you are angry.3. For your mercy we would unbind your thought (from such anger), like a charioteer a horse that has been tied,by our songs, Varuṇa."},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"I.251234.

The argument begins in verse 3 by drawing attention to the mutuality of relationships (friend–friend, comrade–comrade), even of those between hierarchically arranged pairs (father/son). The poet then points out the comradeship between us and Agni (vs. 5), which leads to the balanced construction of verse 7, again emphasizing the mutual relationship between us and Agni: he is dear to us and we to him. That this relationship is also hierarchical is gently implied by identifying him as our clanlord. By picking up the final term in verse 7, the multivalent word svagní, which can mean both “having good fires” and “having good Agni,” and deploy-ing it, again in a balanced construction, in verse 8, the poet subtly shifts to making the gods our partners, not merely Agni, who has become merely the token of this relationship between us and the gods. The hierarchical distance has been increased, but only step-by-step. The climax (however underplayed) comes in verse 9, which calls for mutual encomia (práśasti) between mortals and immortals—in other words, it demands that immortals produce praise for us, as we do for them. The word práśasti is a charged one, referring to the formal praise of kings as well as gods (see Jamison 2007: 146–48; see also I.21 above). Though the conceptual development of the hymn is quite uninsistent, and the simple rhythms of the gāyatrī meter can lull the audience into inattention, the end result, when examined, is quite radical.1. Put on your garments, you partaker of the sacrificial meal and lord of nourishments,and so perform this rite for us.2. Take your seat as our Hotar, worthy to be chosen by our thoughtsand heaven-bound speech, o youngest Agni.3.

This conjecture is supported by the metri-cal evidence, in that verses 1–6 and 10–12 are in trochaic gāyatrī, while the interven-ing verses 7–9 have no trochaic pādas. These three verses (7–9) are also thematically unified by a focus on a mortal, aided by Agni, who seeks a prize.The rest of the hymn is more diffuse in content and surprisingly awkward in phraseology. The final verse (13), in triṣṭubh, makes no mention of Agni and may have been tacked onto this already loosely structured assemblage because its signa-ture word námas “reverence” matches the last word of the first hemistich of verse 1, námobhiḥ “with reverences.”1.

Most scholarly treatments are more or less in agreement with Geldner’s interpretation, signaled already in his title “Die vereinfachte Somapressung” (The Simplified Soma-Pressing). In this interpretation the hymn depicts an abbreviated soma-pressing done at home, on the spur of the moment and without formality, by a sacrificer and his wife, using normal household implements, the mortar (ulū́khala) and pestle, to pound the soma stalks. The participation of the wife occasioned the slightly salacious comparisons between the pounding and sexual intercourse. A woman, presumably the wife, is mentioned explicitly once, in a word play that implicitly compares her regular movements in wielding the mortar with rhythmic sexual movement (vs. 3)."},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"I.28127Despite the weight of scholarly opinion, we consider this literal interpretation quite unlikely, because the precious and prized substance soma, the focus of the most elaborate non-royal rites, can hardly have been used for a slapdash, playful domestic entertainment. Instead, this hymn should be considered together with a number of others in the late R̥gveda in which women figure in controversial or con-tested roles (e.g., I.179, X.10, X.102, X.109). In our view (see Jamison 2011, forth-coming a, forthcoming b, in addition to background in 1996a), the late R̥gveda saw the introduction of a new ritual model, in which the Wife of the Sacrificer partici-pated in the ritual along with her husband and the other male functionaries. This innovation was, we believe, being bitterly debated by theologians in this period, and the debate can be discerned beneath the surface of such hymns.This particular hymn alludes to the new ritual model incorporating the Sacrificer’s Wife by presenting the solemn soma-pressing as if it were a domestic procedure, utiliz-ing tools to be found in every kitchen, the proper domain of the Wife. An implicit iden-tification between domestic paraphernalia and that of solemn ritual is found already in the first verse, where the standard high-ritual word for the pressing stone (grā́van) is juxtaposed with that for the domestic mortar (ulū́khala). (See also Atharvaveda IX.6.15 with the same identification: yā́ny ulūkhalamusalā́ni grā́vāṇa evá té “the mortar and pestle—they are the pressing stones,” in a hymn that systematically presents a series of such statements.) The final verse (9) returns to technical terms for soma equipment in solemn ritual (camū́ “cup”; pavítra “filter”; go﻿́r ádhi tvací “upon the hide of the cow”), thus affirming that a real soma sacrifice has indeed been performed. Perhaps the most important technical term in that verse is śiṣṭá (in the sandhi sequence úc chiṣṭám < úd + śiṣṭám; cf. later úcchiṣṭa “leftover”): in later śrauta ritual the Wife is particularly active in the Third Pressing and the soma offered there is “left-over” soma. We thus see the ritual notion of the “leftover” already associated with the Wife here.Since one of the aims of introducing the Sacrificer’s Wife into ritual was to inject sexuality and fertility into the previously sterile realm of sacrifice, the double-entendres throughout the hymn have a (semi-)serious purpose. As often with sexual phraseology, the exact intent is sometimes difficult to figure out (e.g., vs. 6).And what does our poet think about the new model? Although treating the soma-pressing as if it were a cooking demonstration might seem to debase and desolemnize it, the cheerful tone and the reassuring presence of Indra, the consum-mate soma-drinker (who also seems to favor the introduction of the Wife in other hymns), appears to indicate approval of the ritual innovation.1. When the pressing stone with its broad bottom becomes erect in order to press,you, Indra, will keep gulping down the mortar-pressed (soma drops).2. When the pair of pressing boards are formed like two buttocks,you, Indra, will keep gulping down the mortar-pressed (soma drops).3. When the woman puts her best into thrusting back and forth,you, Indra, will keep gulping down the mortar-pressed (soma drops)."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"I.291284.

The refrain fits well in the first two verses, but then the hymn takes an odd turn, expressing increasing hostility toward a variety of unidentified or unidentifiable (see the near hapaxes in vss. 6–7) beings, while continuing to hope blandly for cows and horses in the refrain. The hymn is reminiscent of the “sleep charm” (VII.55), though the latter is more benign in intent, and I.29 also has an Atharvan cast.1.

The remaining three verses (16–18) maintain the second-posi-tion vocative agne, but place other items in first position—a typical loosening of structure toward the end of a hymn.Superimposed on this strict repetition is a less insistent structure of thematic ring composition. The opening of the hymn (vss. 1–4) treats the primal installa-tion of Agni in the sacrifice, a theme reinforced by the word prathamáḥ “first” sta-tioned after the first two words in verses 1–3. Demigods and legendary ancestral mortals are named in these verses, and some of them return in verse 17, the last verse before the summary verse (18), in which Agni is explicitly urged to perform the same actions for us as he did for them in earlier times. In between is the ritual here-and-now. Verses 5–8 detail the aid that Agni gives to a devoted priest in the ritual. In verses 9–11 Agni’s relationship to his worshiper is depicted more expan-sively: he is a father to us with all of a father’s care, but, in a paradox much loved by Vedic bards, Agni is also a son, both of the kindling sticks (vs. 9) and of the priests who wield those sticks (vs. 11). Verse 11 connects the primal creation of Agni treated at the beginning of the hymn with the current ritual, in which Agni is the son of “a father as trifling as me.”The remainder of the hymn (esp. vss. 12–15) begs for Agni’s protection for the sacrificer and his group, and continues the themes both of Agni’s paternal care (vss."},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"I.3113214, 16) and the weakness and unworthiness of those he cares for (vss. 13–14). The poet cleverly uses this acknowledged weakness to his advantage by asking Agni to forgive and forget what we have done wrong in the ritual (vs. 16). There follows the ring-compositional reminiscence of Agni’s primal installation (vs. 17). As often, the final verse (18) is somewhat extra-hymnic, in that it sums up the hymn that precedes with an introductory formula, eténa. . . bráhmaṇā “through this sacred formula-tion,” designed to simulate Agni’s favor.1. You, Agni, the first Aṅgiras, the seer, the god, became a kindly comrade of the gods.Under your commandment were born the sage poets working with their know-how—the Maruts with glinting spears.2.

Vr̥tra was a gigantic cobra who lay coiled around a mountain within which all the waters were entrapped. In his battle with Indra, Vr̥tra spread his “shoulders,” his cobra’s hood, and struck at Indra with his fangs, but Indra finally killed Vr̥tra with his mace, broke open the mountain, and let the waters pour out. They then flowed to Manu (vs. 8), who was the first sacrificer, and by implication to his descendants. Vr̥tra’s name means “obstacle,” and this victory over “Obstacle” is therefore paradigmatic for Indra’s victory over all obstacles.Despite the relative clarity of the treatment of the Vr̥tra battle, the hymn has a curious structure, obsessively circling around and alternately focusing in on and drawing back from the moment of dramatic confrontation between the adversar-ies. After the initial verses of summary and the preliminaries to the battle (vss. 1–4), the next three verses (5–7) depict the battle, and it is portrayed as extremely one-sided, with the overconfident Vr̥tra overmatched from the beginning and deci-sively smashed by Indra. (The signature verb of the first section of the hymn is √han “smash, smite.”) Defeated and dismembered, Vr̥tra lies there (the signature verb of this section is √śī “lie”) with his mother, and the released waters flow over them (8–11). After this interlude the hymn returns to a new description of the battle (12–13), which in this reprise is depicted as far more of an even match. Vr̥tra strikes at Indra with his fangs and deploys various natural forces against his adver-sary. This more equal battle is encapsulated in the perfectly balanced construction índraś ca ya﻿́d yuyudhā́te a﻿́hiś ca “when Indra and the serpent fought each other. . . ” (13c). It is unclear why the first triumphalist account has been revised to the more ambiguous, less glorious version—though both, of course, end with Vr̥tra’s defeat.The most mysterious part of this hymn is the conclusion. Vr̥tra is dead, and even his mother Dānu has been killed, so there is no possibility of a new Vr̥tra. And yet Indra apparently becomes terrified and flies across the rivers “like a frightened falcon.” Perhaps this puzzling ending is related to the second version of the battle, in which Indra does not have quite the unchallenged heroic role that he plays in the first version. The poet does not explain but in the last verse simply returns to a praise of Indra as victor and king.1. Now I shall proclaim the heroic deeds of Indra, those foremost deeds that the mace-wielder performed:He smashed the serpent. He bored out the waters. He split the bellies of the mountains.2. He smashed the serpent resting on the mountain—for him Tvaṣṭar had fashioned the resounding [/sunlike] mace."},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"I.32135Like bellowing milk-cows, streaming out, the waters went straight down to the sea.3. Acting the bull, he chose for his own the soma. He drank of the pressed soma among the Trikadrukas [=the Maruts?].The generous one took up his missile, the mace. He smashed him, the first-born of serpents.4. When you, Indra, smashed the first-born of serpents and then beguiled the wiles of the wily ones,then, giving birth to the sun, the heaven, and the dawn, since that time you have surely never found a rival.5. Indra smashed Vr̥tra [/Obstacle] the very great obstacle, whose shoulders were spread apart, with his mace, his great weapon.Like logs hewn apart by an axe, the serpent would lie, embracing the earth [/soaking the earth (with his blood)].6.

His mouth destroyed by the shattering blow, he whose rival was Indra was completely crushed.7. Handless and footless, he gave battle to Indra.

The second of the pair, I.33, has attracted far less attention than its famous sibling, which is a pity, for its poetry is often stirring, and it also provides a complementary companion piece to I.32. While I.32 pits Indra against a demonic adversary in single combat, in a world in which humans and their concerns are entirely absent (save for the poet’s introduction “I proclaim” in vs. 1 and the celebra-tion of Indra’s kingship in the final vs. 15), the human world and human strife are the core of I.33. This focus on the human is clear from the beginning of the hymn. The poet exhorts himself and his fellows to go right up to Indra and demand goods from him (vss. 1–3). The interaction between god and mortals lacking in I.32 is thus immediately established in I.33.The center of the hymn (vss. 4–10ab, in our view) describes a pitched and desperate conflict between human moieties, in which Indra intervenes on the side of the good. Thus, unlike the battle in I.32, where the contestants are unequally matched from the start (though a more equal match-up is depicted in the second version of the conflict), in I.33 the clashing sides begin in balance, having separated from each other (vs. 4cd) in order to fight each other. At issue is fundamental social organization: sacrificers versus non-sacrificers (4d, 5b), who lack the vratás (“commandments,” 5d) that bind the sacrificers. The non-sacrificers are several times identified as dásyu (4a, 7c, 9d, curi-ously always in the singular), and so this hymn may depict the conflict between indig-enous peoples and the infiltrating Ārya. However, the non-sacrificers may instead be Ārya following different customs, with Dasyu simply a nasty insult hurled at a larger kin-group that deviates from the social behavior of the R̥gvedins. Their mutual depar-ture in opposite directions from a single place (4c) may argue for the latter view: these"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"I.33137are not foes who encountered each other as one group expanded into the territory of the other, but apparently a once unified group that split. (Verse 18 of the difficult hymn X.27 is phraseologically close to this verse, and suggests even more strongly that the groups have split over doctrinal matters.) Also in favor of this view is the fact that the poet tends to treat the hostile sides in balanced constructions, sometimes allotting alternating pādas to each (e.g., vs. 6, where in our view 6a describes the enemies, 6b the Navagvas who are ordinarily clients of Indra, with 6cd returning to the enemies) or in bipartite phrases (e.g., 7a “those wailing and those laughing”). Indra quickly takes the side of the sacrificers, “the presser and the praiser” (7d), and his aid proves deci-sive—though not before the poet produces some striking images, for instance, of the enemies girdling themselves in earth, perhaps a reference to their wounding or death, while Indra’s own side is clothed with the sun (vs. 9).After this substantial and sustained treatment of this dramatic human conflict and Indra’s part in it, the rest of the hymn turns into a sort of catalogue of allusions to other triumphs of Indra, not all of which are clear. Verse 10d must surely depict the Vala myth, but the vájra (“mace”) of 10c does not fit that myth well and may be a glancing reference to the Vr̥tra battle, which seems to be treated, though without nam-ing Vr̥tra, in verse 11, and by name in verse 13. Other enemies are defeated in verse 12, including one, with the curious name Ilībiśa, known only from here, and other clients are aided in verses 14–15. The final half-verse of 15 may return to the massed enemies of the central part of the hymn, though that view cannot be strongly supported.1. Come on! Let us go up close to Indra, seeking cattle. Will he increase his solicitude for us?With no one to hinder him, will he perhaps then turn his distant intention toward us for this wealth, for cattle?2. I fly close to the unopposable giver of wealth, like a falcon to its delightful dwelling,doing homage to Indra with my best chants, the one who is to be invoked by praisers on his journey.3.

The Aśvins, of whom there are, of course, two, are urged to perform various actions three times a day, using equipment, especially their chariot, that has numerous tri-ple features. The particular ritual reason for the glorification of three must be the three soma-pressings, but this ritual application is not made clear until verse 8. If, as we have argued, the Third Pressing is a ritual innovation in the R̥gveda, a hymn devoted to extolling it is not surprising.The hymn falls into two unequal parts, each ending with a triṣṭubh verse (vss. 1–9, 10–12). In the first part the number three is especially celebrated, though the number is not absent in the second part (see vss. 11 and 12). The last three verses invite the Aśvins to drink the soma and to offer us rewards in return. Despite the metrical punctuation and the change in emphasis in the brief second part, there is no reason not to consider this hymn a unity.From the grammatical point of view, the hymn contains what many scholars (including us) take as a precious archaism, the single occurrence of the phrase sū́re duhitā́ “daughter of the Sun” (vs. 5d), preserving in sū́re the sandhi of final -as of the genitive *sū́ras as -e before a dental in close phrasal sandhi. (For general discus-sion of this phenomenon, see Jamison 2010.) It perhaps escaped modernization because the focus of the hymn was not on the mythological marriage of Sūryā, daughter of the Sun, and she is only mentioned because of the incidental fact that the chariot she mounted had three standing places.1.

It is noteworthy that this collec-tion does not contain a hymn to Indra. However, there are three hymns (I.37–39) to the Maruts, Indra’s regular companions, and the following hymn, I.40, is dedicated to Brahmaṇaspati. Indra figures prominently in that hymn and is in fact identified with Brahmaṇaspati in it.For the most part the style of these hymns is uncomplex but nicely balanced.I.36 AgniKaṇva Ghaura20 verses: br̥hatī alternating with satobr̥hatī, arranged in pragāthasLong but relatively straightforward, this hymn first celebrates the communal fire belonging to a number of clans, as Proferes argues (2007: 31), uniting them in com-mon action (vss. 1–3). The poet then cites a divine precedent for joint kindling of the fire (vs. 4) and assigns Agni various social roles: priest, householder, and mes-senger (vs. 5), an almost trifunctional structure. Verses 7–8 conflate mortals and gods in their expansion of territory and defeat of opposing forces, and the next series of verses also mingle legendary and current mortals in their relation to Agni.The mood of the hymn changes with verse 13. There follow a number of peremp-tory commands to Agni, for help and, especially, protection from and destruction of enemies, interspersed with mentions of help that Agni offered to previous mor-tal clients. The more militant verses are reminiscent of X.87, dedicated to Agni Rakṣohan (“Demon-Smiter”), although the latter hymn is more inventive than this one.1.

The mystery of their birth, also a common feature of Marut hymns, is mentioned glancingly in verse 9.

The poet continues in this intimate tone in the next tr̥ca—first (vs. 4) slyly suggesting that if their positions were reversed, the Maruts, as poets, would praise him, the current poet, like a god, and then begging them to keep him safe (vss. 5–6) and to end the current dry spell (vs. 6c). The compressed and abrupt quality of gāyatrī meter is ideally suited for this conversational style.The next six verses (7–12) present a more conventional description of the Maruts as the thunderstorm, with familiar images. In the last three verses (13–15), the poet exhorts himself to sing not only to the Maruts but like the Maruts, especially in verse 14. The first verse of this tr̥ca (13) introduces two other divinities, the Lord of the Sacred Formulation (to whom the same poet will dedicate nearby I.40) and Agni; it is not clear why they share this last tr̥ca with the Maruts.1. What is this now, you fair-weather friends?! What have you taken in your hands,as a father does his son, o you for whom the ritual grass has been twisted?2. Where now—what your goal?—have you gone on earth, as if in heaven?Where are they taking pleasure in you, like cows (in a pasture)?3.

This hope is expressed especially nakedly in the last part of the hymn, verses 7–10. In the earlier parts of the hymn the poet praises the power of the Maruts in a formal style, but by stating that this might cannot be challenged (vss. 2cd, 4), he hints that it could in fact encounter a challenge.The usual buoyant descriptions of the Maruts’ appearance and behavior as the thunderstorm are muted in this hymn. They serve only to illustrate what power might be available to the poet and his people (vss. 3, 5–6).1. When from the far distance you cast your measure [/your bellowing], like a flame, just so,by whose will, o Maruts, in whose form, and to whom do you drive? To whom, o you shakers?2.

As the patron deity of ritual speech, Brahmaṇaspati will make the poet’s speech effective enough to bring the other gods, especially Indra, to our sacrifice (vss. 1–2). In the second pragātha (vss. 3–4) the poet seeks Brahmaṇaspati’s indirect"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"I.40149help. If the poet’s efforts on behalf of the sacrifice are successful, his patron stands to gain (see esp. vs. 4cd), and the patron then should give liberal rewards to the singer (vs. 4a). It is striking that the patron is here called a “hero” and promised, in the famous inherited phrase, “imperishable fame”—not for his exploits on the battlefield, but for his generosity to his poet.The test comes in the following pragātha (vss. 5–6): the new mantra under the patronage of Brahmaṇaspati is pronounced both by Brahmaṇaspati and by the human actors at the ritual. If it is a properly formulated mantra, it will bring the desired success. Judging from the final pragātha (vss. 7–8), ritual success was achieved, and this success is expressed in strikingly sexual terms: both the patron’s dwelling place and his power to rule are infused with productive sexuality (vss. 7d, 8a). He also gains the gods as his allies (8a), and, most surprising of all, becomes identified as the god Indra himself (8cd), via the very last word in the hymn, vajrín “wielder of the mace,” a qualifier otherwise only of Indra.1. Rise up, o Lord of the Sacred Formulation. Seeking the gods, we beseech you:let the Maruts of good drops come forth; o Indra, swelling with strength, keep (them) company.2.

Who gives to the cantor liberal goods, he acquires imperishable fame;for him we win through sacrifice faultless refreshment bringing good heroes and advancing well.5. Now the Lord of the Sacred Formulation proclaims the mantra worthy to be spoken,in which Indra, Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman, and the gods have made their home.6. Just that would we speak at the rites—the faultless mantra that brings good fortune, o gods.And if you gladly receive this speech, o noble men [=gods], it will attain all things of yours worth winning.7.

The only notable aspect of these verses is the pervasive imagery of journeys and their potential risks.It is only the last two verses (8–9) that introduce interesting complications. This last tr̥ca begins (vs. 7) with a deliberative question—how shall we make our praise of the gods succeed? The advice in the next two verses seems to be (translated into modern American political parlance) “Don’t go negative!” In verse 8 the poet for-swears responding directly to a rival behaving with hostility and affirms his inten-tion to use only positive means to win the gods. The first two pādas of verse 9 depict the rivalry in terms of the ever-popular ancient Indian dice game (see esp. X.34), counseling the poet that you can never tell what your opponent has up his sleeve until all the cards are on the table. (We have recast this vignette into the language of modern card-playing, which works remarkably well—even to the holding of the four winning tokens, aces in our recasting, which in the Indian dice game would be a handful of vibhītaka nuts divisible by four.) The lesson seems to be that, given the possibility that your opponent might have some successful tricks of his own, you should engage him as little as possible and concentrate on your positive praises of the gods.1. Whom they guard—the attentive Varuṇa, Mitra, and Aryaman—that person is never deceived.2. The mortal whom they carry across as if in their arms and protect from harm,he thrives, unharmed and whole.3.

In the first part of the hymn the god is asked to rid our paths of potential enemies (esp. vss. 2–4), while in the latter part he is to lead us along these roads, now rendered safe, to prosperity (esp. vss. 7–8). The nine verses of tr̥cas are consistently addressed to Pūṣan in the 2nd person, and all those verses but 5 contain imperatives; note especially the final explosion of five abrupt, object-less imperatives in 9ab, the final verse of the hymn proper. In the final summary verse (10) Pūṣan is in the 3rd person, the object of our attentions and our requests.1. Traverse the roads with (us), Pūṣan, and (release) constraint from (us), o child of release.Go forth before us to victory, o god.2.

In VI.74 the two are invoked together, in a dual dvandva, but aside from generic divine descriptions only Rudra’s characteristics are mentioned. Here the two gods are confined to separate tr̥cas; in fact, as Oldenberg suggests, it may have originally been two hymns: verses 1–6 Rudra, 7–9 Soma.In contrast to other Rudra contexts the depiction of Rudra here is resolutely posi-tive; there is no trace of the dangerous or vengeful Rudra. One might in fact consider the pile-up of flattering adjectives in the opening question in verse 1 a poetic insur-ance policy, making it clear to the god that there will be no caviling from us. The rest of the two Rudra tr̥cas focuses on the god’s power to provide for the welfare of both humans and livestock, along with Aditi (vs. 2) and the principal Ādityas (vs. 3).The first two verses (7–8) of the tr̥ca to Soma are straightforward and generic, with no particularly somian features. The final verse (9), in a different meter, is syn-tactically complex and lexically formal, and has given rise to a number of compet-ing interpretations. In our view it depicts Soma, as often, as extending from earth to heaven, and he finds the gods in both places, in heaven, which is their abode, and on the ritual ground, because they have come to drink soma at the sacrifice. Both the relevance of this verse to the rest of the tr̥ca and the connection of the Rudra and Soma portions of the hymn escape us.1. What might we say to Rudra, the provident, the most generous, the very powerful;what might we say that is most wealful to his heart?2. So that for our livestock and men Aditi will create Rudrian power, likewise for our kine,likewise for our offspring.3.

The gods to whom these Praskaṇva hymns are dedi-cated are those mentioned in the litany: Agni, particularly in his capacity as illumi-nator of the early morning and conveyor of the dawn divinities, the Aśvins, Dawn, and the rising Sun.I.44 Agni, Aśvins, Dawn (1–2), Agni (3–14)Praskaṇva Kāṇva14 verses: br̥hatī alternating with satobr̥hatī, arranged in pragāthasAs indicated in the introduction to the Praskaṇva collection, this hymn to Agni praises him in his connection to the rituals of the early morning, especially in his role as conveyor of the other gods who attend this sacrifice. In its fourteen verses this hymn seldom departs from this simple message. The language is measured and dignified, but not difficult or poetically contorted.1. Agni, immortal one—the bright benefit radiating from Dawn:convey it here to the pious man, o Jātavedas; convey here today the gods who wake at dawn.2.

Unlike the last hymn, however, these gods are not individually enumerated; instead generic names for groups of gods are given in the first half of the first verse, and in the last two verses (9–10) they are summed up in the phrase “the divine folk.” The emphasis is rather on the world of men. In verse 3 the poet mentions a number of prior singers as models for his own interaction with Agni, and he groups himself with his kinsmen the Priyamedhas (vs. 4) and Kaṇvas (vs. 5), as well as unnamed poets and invokers in verses 6–8. Thus, while the two pairs of outer verses (1–2, 9–10) concern Agni’s delivery of the gods to the sacrifice, the middle verses (3–8) are occupied with the sacrificers’ desire for Agni to listen to their hymns and pleas.1. You, Agni, (bring) the Vasus, the Rudras, and the Ādityas here.I will sacrifice to the being who assures good rites, born of Manu, sprinkling ghee [=Agni].2.

O you of brightest fame, the kinsmen within their clans call upon you,o much beloved Agni, the flame-haired, to convey the oblation.7. The inspired poets have installed you as their Hotar, seasonably sacrificing, best finder of goods,with listening ears, of greatest extent, o Agni, at the rituals of daybreak.8.

O might-made comrade, those who travel early for soma-drinking,the divine folk—here today make them sit on the ritual grass, o good one.10. The divine folk, o Agni, attract toward us through sacrifice, with invocations common (to all):“Here is the soma, you of good drops. Drink it, aged overnight.”I.46 AśvinsPraskaṇva Kāṇva15 verses: gāyatrīThis hymn is an invitation to the Aśvins to come in the early morning to a soma offering, either the early morning of the pressing day or the early morning of the following day in an Atirātra or “overnight” soma ritual. It is a difficult hymn because of its obscure references (cf. vss. 4 and 5) and its penchant for hapaxes (e.g., kúṭa in vs. 4, ā́dāra in 5, avidriya﻿́ in 15).A unifying image running through much of the hymn is the journey of the Aśvins over the waters to the sacrificial area (vss. 3, 7, 8, 11), introduced by the poet’s statement that the Sindhu River is the mother of the Aśvins (vs. 2). In accord with this image, the soma itself is a river, flowing upward to the Aśvins to bring them to the sacrificial area (vs. 9ab). In this verse “what is good” or “the good thing” that is “in the track of the rivers” may refer to the soma, as Geldner suggests. Echoing this image is the poet’s repeated use of derivatives of √pr̥ “carry across” (vss. 4, 6, 12).In verse 1 Dawn is the first to arrive, before other deities, although with the arrival of dawn the Aśvins should also appear, and indeed in verse 14 the poet returns to the arrival of Dawn and says that she has followed the Aśvins. In verse 2 the insight through which the Aśvins find goods may be both their insight and also the poet’s, for the hymns inspire the Aśvins to bring goods. Verse 4 is very obscure for several reasons. First, the identity of the “lover of the waters, the carrier” is uncertain. Among the suggestions are Indra (Pirart 1995: 81) or Soma (Geldner, Renou, Thieme [1967: 236]), but it might also be Agni, who is also connected with the waters—he is famously “the Child of the Waters”—and who carries oblations to the gods and carries sacrificers across difficulties. Unfortunately 4c is not much help in identifying “the carrier” since kúṭa is a hapax of uncertain meaning. We have translated it as “house” following Thieme, but it may have another meaning and could even be a proper name, as Pirart suggests. This “lover of the waters” is probably also the ā́dāra, again a hapax and again of unsure meaning. We have translated it as “the one paying heed,” but according to another etymological analysis it could mean “breaker, splitter.” All we can say with certainty is that the verse ends with a clear invitation to the Aśvins to drink the soma (5c). As the"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"I.46157soma flows to the Aśvins, so the poet hopes that the morning light, correspond-ing to the soma, will flow toward the sacrificers (6). In verse 9 the poet turns to address his fellow Kaṇvas in the first half-verse and the Aśvins in pāda c. In that last line, the poet asks where the Aśvins are hidden, where they are “cloaked,” for it is presumably still dark and neither the dawn nor the Aśvins have yet appeared. The cloaking of the Aśvins in 9 contrasts with verse 13, in which the poet asks the Aśvins to “clothe” themselves in the soma in the company of Vivasvant, who is here likely associated with the sun. Then they and the morning will be present to the sacrificers.1. With none before her, this Dawn breaks, the beloved of heaven.I shall sing aloft praise to you, Aśvins,2.

Your oar is broader than heaven; your chariot is at the ford of the rivers;through our insight the soma drops have been hitched up.9.

Both of you—offer protection to usthrough your unbreakable help!I.47 AśvinsPraskaṇva Kāṇva10 verses: br̥hatī alternating with satobr̥hatī, arranged in pragāthasThe hymn is dominated by imperatives, which appear in every verse except the last. These imperatives command the Aśvins to attend to the poet (e.g., 2d), to come to the sacrifice (e.g., 2b, 3d, 7c, 8b, 8d, 9a), to drink the soma (e.g., 1c, 3b), and especially to bestow prosperity on the sacrificer (e.g., 1d, 5c, 6b, 6d). The last verse summarizes the desire of the poet to bring the Aśvins, together with many goods, by means of the “recitations and chants” of those performing the sacrifice.Like I.34 the hymn also associates a number of triplets with the Aśvins: their “triply turning chariot with its three standing places” (vs. 2) and the ritual grass “on which are three seats” (vs. 4). These triplets likely have ritual reference, although it is not clear what the reference might be. The “three turns” of the Aśvins’ chariot may describe the three pressings of a soma sacrifice. Compare X.52.4d = 124.1b, which speaks of the sacrifice with its pa﻿́ñcayāmaṃ trivŕ̥taṃ sapta﻿́tantum “five courses, three turns, seven threads.” The term trivandhura﻿́ “with three standing places” is only used to describe the chariot of the Aśvins, but never with much indication about its referent. Geldner suggests that “the three seats” of triṣadhastha﻿́ might be for the two Aśvins and Sūryā or that they are simply three because the Aśvins are regularly associated with triplets. But there are other pos-sibilities. Although triṣadhastha﻿́ characterizes various gods, in X.61.14 and V.11.2 it describes the three seats of Agni, the three fires, and perhaps it refers to these in this context as well. In that case, the three seats are not actually on the ritual grass but rather at or near it.In the first verse the reference to the “day-old” soma places this hymn in the morning of the day following the pressing day in an Atirātra or “overnight” soma ritual. The soma offerings in the morning are a continuation of the offerings of the Third Pressing. If recited at the end of the rite, it is no wonder that the poet emphasizes the goods that he hopes that the Aśvins will bring on their chariot (3c, 6a, 9bc)—the chariot that is both the vehicle on which the Aśvins ride and the sacrifice itself. These are the goods that should come to the sacrificers as a result of their completed sacrifice.In verse 7 the poet calls on the Aśvins to come whether they are far away or with Turvaśa. The Kaṇva poets of the VIIIth maṇḍala suggest their alliance with the"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"I.47159Turvaśa and Yadu tribes (e.g., VIII.4.1 and 4.7; 7.18; 9.14; 10.5; 45.27). Since our poet is a Kaṇva as well, Turvaśa represents an ally, perhaps the people of the sacrifi-cer for whom the hymn was composed. The point is therefore that the Aśvins should come to this sacrifice whether are far away or close by, among this very people.1. O you growing strong through truth, this most honey-filled soma has been pressed for you two.Drink that (soma) aged overnight, Aśvins. Grant riches to the pious man.2.

The radiant beauty of Dawn and her mandate to rouse and animate all living beings are not neglected in the hymn, how-ever, especially in the middle verses (5–10). In verses 11–12 she is also, unusually, charged with a task more appropriate for Agni (see, e.g., I.44), namely conveying the gods to the sacrifice.1.

The last three verses (11–13) have a clear Atharvan cast, as a spell against disease, specifically jaundice. By sympathetic magic, the golden sun removes the jaundice from the afflicted man and displaces it onto other, presumably yellowish creatures—parrots and other birds.The first nine verses, in a different meter, are a charmingly simple descrip-tion of the rising of the Sun and the beginning of his journey across the sky. The affinity of the intermediate verse (10) is not clear. Though it matches the meter of the final three verses, in tone it seems more like a final verse summariz-ing the happy result of the sunrise in verses 1–9. (It is not unusual for the final verse of a hymn to be in a different meter from the rest.) If this is the case, then the spell in verses 11–13 could have been tacked onto this hymn because of the phrase “higher heaven” (11b), which echoes “higher light” and “highest light” in verse 10.1.

For the most part the hymns are a glorification of Indra’s deeds—both the standard and well-known triumphs like the smashing of Vr̥tra (see esp. I.52) and numerous lesser-known feats, which are presented in catalogue fashion (see esp. I.51, 53). The style is often syntactically and rhetorically contorted, with rare words and obscure expressions.I.51 IndraSavya Āṅgirasa15 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 14–15This hymn consists primarily of an elaborated list of Indra’s great deeds, some well known (like the Vala myth in 3a, the Vr̥tra myth in 4, Indra’s involvement"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"I.51164with Uśanā Kāvya and Kutsa in the slaying of Śuṣṇa in verses 6a, 10–11) and others quite obscure. For example, Vimada, mentioned in 3ab, is usually a client of the Aśvins, who supply him with a wife (often using the same verb [√vah “con-vey”] as here: I.112.9, 116.1, 117.20; X.39.7, 65.12). Is the same deed attributed to Indra here and is the “good thing” that Indra brings him a reference to the wife? Similarly puzzling are the enemies who make oblation “on the shoulder” in verse 5 (perhaps indicating people following different ritual practices and not part of the Ārya community; see vss. 8–9), Indra’s role as an ant destroying walls in verse 9, and his transformation into the female consort of an otherwise unknown figure in verse 13c.The catalogue of deeds is interrupted by demands that Indra use his same mar-tial powers for our benefit (vss. 7–9ab), and it is framed by an exhortation to the poets to give praise to the god (vs. 1) and the announcement of the end of the praise hymn and the boons we seek from it (vss. 14–15).1.

You helped Kutsa in the smashing of Śuṣṇa, and you made Śambara subject to Atithigva.With your foot you trampled down Arbuda, though he was great.

The account of the Vr̥tra battle begins in verse 2 and continues through verse 10, with a reiteration in the final verse 15, and thus constitutes one of the longer sustained R̥gvedic passages devoted to this myth. This account of the myth has not achieved the fame of a hymn like I.32, however—in part because of the obscurity of its diction and syntax.This version also allots a large role to the helpers that encouraged and aided Indra at the battle, not only Tvaṣṭar (vs. 7) as often, but also the Maruts, iden-tified as such in verses 9 and 15 (see also vs. 3), but also referred to as per-sonified abstractions—“forms of help” (see vss. 2, 4–5, 9), “powers,” et cetera. Almost paradoxically the hymn also depicts the fear of the divine beings and of heaven itself during the Vr̥tra battle (vss. 9–10). Moreover, the final verses (11–14, excluding the summarizing verse 15) concern the extent of Indra’s unri-valed power, comparing its reach to the furthest expanses of heaven, earth, and the midspace.1.

After an initial verse exhorting the singers to present their work to Indra at the sacrifice, lest a lazy performance or bad composition deprive them of his gifts, Indra is praised in verses 2–5 for his quick response in fulfilling the desires of his singers. The mood changes in the next five verses (6–10), which constitute a brisk catalogue of Indra’s martial deeds in aid of his named human clients. This survey is somewhat reminiscent of the list of Indra’s deeds in the first Savya hymn, I.51. The hymn ends with a summary verse (11), which returns to the hortatory style of verse 1.1. Let us bring forward our speech for the great one, our songs for Indra, at the seat of Vivasvant,for never has anyone found a treasure among those who are, as it were, asleep.

In verse 7 the earthly king is invested with some of Indra’s prestige—as long as he emulates Indra’s habit of command and also shows the Indraic quality of generos-ity to the poets.

Despite the emphasis in the hymn on Indra’s martial powers and contrary to Savya’s usual practice, no particular heroic deeds are recounted or even mentioned directly; there is simply one indirect allusion to the Vr̥tra myth in the final pāda of verse 6, which serves as the transition between the omphalos verses and the final requests.1.

Only in the final verse (6) is there mention of any of Indra’s exploits, with an oblique reference to the Vr̥tra myth that is featured heavily in other Savya hymns.One of the puzzles of the hymn is the identity of the female addressee in verse 3, “(you,) lovely like Dawn.” Oldenberg (tentatively), Geldner, and Renou all suggest that she is the Sacrificer’s Wife, but this is quite unlikely. As I have argued elsewhere (Jamison 2011, forthcoming a, forthcoming b), this ritual participant is only being introduced in the late R̥gveda and she is a controversial and polarizing figure there, so it is improbable that she would be addressed without fanfare here. Moreover, the addressee is called upon to bring or assemble material for the sacrifice, a role that the Sacrificer’s Wife never has in classical śrauta ritual (see Jamison 1996a passim).1. For the most bounteous one, the lofty one bringing lofty wealth, for the mighty one of real unbridled force I bring forth my thought—for him whose generosity is difficult to restrain as if in a torrent of waters, lifelong generosity opened up to his power.2.

In the jagatī portion of the hymn, verses con-cerning ritual fire (1, 3) alternate with evocations of the unchecked passage of fire in the woods (2, 4–5), while the final four verses (6–9), in triṣṭubh, are only about the ritual fire. The ritual verses focus on the choosing and installation of Agni as Hotar (vss. 1, 3, 6–7), especially in its first enactment by the gods and the human ancestors (see esp. vss. 3, 6).The counterpoint between wild uncontrollable fire and ritual fire may subtly emphasize what a feat of civilizing was accomplished by taming fire for sacrificial (and domestic) purposes in the legendary past, and how this feat is repeated in the present day. The last two verses (8–9) beg Agni for shelter and protection for us, the singers. Again, the image of a guardian fire may acquire special intensity by contrast with the potentially destructive fire in the wild.1. Never is the immortal one, born of strength, forced down.

The universality of Agni is emphasized throughout. The first and last verses have contrastive víśva (“all”) expressions: “all the immortals” in 1b contrasting with “belonging to all (human) communities” in 7a. The first two verses situate him as cosmically central, between gods and men and heaven and earth, while in verse 3 he is the center that attracts everything else within him. A different kind of universality is asserted in verses 5–6, where the signature deeds of Indra are attributed to Agni and he is called by Indra’s standard epithet, “Vr̥tra-smasher.” This rhetorical ploy makes him the equivalent of the most powerful of the gods, hence in some sense the embodi-ment of divinity itself.The hymn also shows an omphalos structure. The outer ring (vss. 1 and 7) noted above, as well as an inner ring defined by the identification of Agni as king (vss. 3 and 5), point to the middle verse 4 as omphalos. And in a hymn of reasonably straightforward syntax and imagery, verse 4 does stand out for its rel-ative obscurity.

Thus the centrality of Agni for both the cosmos and the mundane world is affirmed in this, the central verse of the hymn, as is the interpenetration of Agni’s twofold nature as an element of the cosmos (the son of Heaven and Earth, possessed of the sun) and as a participating member of human society (the Hotar, recipient of hymns).It is worthy of note that, in contrast to the last hymn (I.58) with its graphic depiction of actual fire, this hymn contains almost no mention of Agni’s physical qualities.1. The other fires are just twigs of you, Agni. In you do all the immortals bring themselves to euphoria.Vaiśvānara, you are the navel of the settlements.

On the one hand, Agni’s primal installation in the sacrifice by the ancestors of humankind is contrasted with his regular re-instal-lation by the current sacrificers (see esp. vs. 2ab, but also throughout). In fact, the orig-inal theft of fire from heaven by Mātariśvan, who bestowed it on the legendary Bhr̥gu, ends the first verse. In several places (2c, 3d, 4b, 4d) it is not possible to determine from the verb form whether the poet is referring to the distant and legendary past or the recent past of the current ritual, though unfortunately English imposes the choice. The aorist forms in question often refer to the immediate past, and so we have trans-lated them (“has been set down,” etc.), but an unmarked past (“was set down,” etc.) is far from excluded. It is quite likely that the poet wished to leave the question open.The other double aspect treated is Agni’s dual role in the sacrifice: he both acts as priest and is the object of ritual activity by human priests. See especially verse 2b, where the Uśij (“fire-priests”) present oblations to him, and 4a, where Agni is identified as an Uśij (as well as a Hotar, in 4b).1. Glorious conveyor and beacon of the rite, pursuing (his ritual duties) well, the messenger who immediately (reaches) his goal,of double birth, celebrated like wealth—Mātariśvan brought him as a gift to Bhr̥gu.2. His command do both sides follow in presenting their oblations: his (ancient) fire-priests and mortals (now).He has been set down as Hotar even in front of heaven, as clan-lord worthy of the asking, the ritual adept among the clans.3. Ever newer acclaim from us, from our heart, should reach him as he is being born, the honey-tongued one,whom the sons of Manu who sacrifice regularly in ritual community, who dispense ritual delight, the Āyus, have begotten.4. Himself a fire-priest, pure and good, he has been installed among the clans of the sons of Manu as the Hotar worthy to be chosen.As domestic ally, house-lord in the home, Agni has became wealth-lord of wealth.5. It is you, Agni, that we Gotamas celebrate with our thoughts as lord of wealth,grooming you like a swift, prize-bearing (horse). – Early in the morning—soon—he should come, bringing goods through (his) insight."},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"I.61178I.61 IndraNodhas Gautama16 verses: triṣṭubhThe three Indra hymns by Nodhas share a ritual context: judging from their last verses (I.61.16, 62.13, 63.9) they were all composed to accompany the Hāriyojana (“Fallow-bay-yoking”) oblation, when Indra’s pair of horses is yoked up for the god’s return journey to heaven after the sacrifice is complete. The parts of these hymns before the final verse do not seem to reflect this ritual moment, and the three hymns are quite different, though they all display Nodhas’s remarkable poetic skill.This first hymn, I.61, is a masterpiece of intricate structure and verbal trickery. We will summarize the main points here, but for more detailed treatment see the lengthy discussion in Jamison (2007: 60–68). The most obvious structural device is the fronted repetition of a deictic pronoun: each of the sixteen verses except the last (which is an extra-hymnic summary verse) begins with either the dative asmaí “for him” or the genitive asyá “of him,” followed by two emphasizing particles, always referring to Indra (except in vs. 12—see below). The dative sequence is the more common and frames the hymn (vss. 1–6, 8, 12, 15); the genitive sequence is found primarily in the center of the hymn (vss. 7, 9–11, 13–14).This rigid structural device both parallels and counterpoints the semantic structure of the hymn. In general in this hymn the dative verses express the ritual here-and-now, with the production and presentation of hymns and ritual offer-ings “to/for just this one,” while the genitive verses concern Indra’s great deeds. Especially in the dative verses numerous co-referential adjectival datives reinforce the fronted pronoun, as well as strategically placed dative tokens of the god’s name. Curiously, in the genitive verses the genitive several times (vss. 7, 10, 11) seems to have quite a loose syntactic connection to the rest of the sentence, and Indra may appear in another case in the same verse, as inI.61.10ab asyéd evá śávasā śuṣántaṃ, ví vr̥ścad vájreṇa vr̥trám índraḥOf just this one [gen.]—in (his) expansion Indra [nom.] hewed apart snorting Vr̥tra with his mace.But what may appear superficially to be clumsy composition serves a larger structural purpose: it seems that the logical structure of the hymn requires a two-way opposition, between dative asmaí and something else: the something else is genitive asyá even when a different case form might have been more appropriate, for a variety of other cases would have obscured the bipartite contrastive structure of the hymn. Here we see an example of clausal morphosyntax subordinated to and indeed distorted by the imposition of a larger literary and rhetorical pattern.The poet Nodhas also lays a few traps for us by playing on the expectations he has created. Most notable of them is verse 12, which begins with the dative asmaí and therefore appears to return us from the mythological past to the realm of the current-day poet of verses 1–5, an expectation reinforced by the verb prá bharā,"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"I.61179a standard lexeme for presenting a hymn to a divinity. But the phrase in verse 12 quickly goes awry. At the opening of the next pāda, where Indra’s name has been prominently placed in previous verses (índrāya 1d, 4d, 5b, 8b), we find, most shock-ingly, the name of his arch-enemy, vr̥trā́ya, immediately followed by the accusative object vájram, Indra’s weapon, not the word for hymn we were expecting. The poet has simply tricked us, having laid a trap with conventional phraseology and syntax and with the stylistic patterns established earlier in the hymn. He also skillfully exploits the morphological ambiguity of the verb form bharā: given the pattern set in verses 1–5 we are primed to interpret bharā as a 1st sg. subjunctive (“I shall pres-ent”), but as the half verse unfolds, it becomes clear that bharā must rather be taken as a metrically lengthened 2nd singular imperative (“bear down!”).The meter of this hymn is often irregular, with a number of ten-syllable lines, but again this irregularity should not be taken as a sign of poor poetic technique. Rather the hymn seems to be phrase-driven rather than meter-driven, and the metri-cal rests that result from “missing syllables” serve to isolate and emphasize crucial nominal phrases—an effect also heightened by the copious examples of alliteration.With all the poetic fireworks on display the actual contents of the hymn may seem almost beside the point, but we will provide a brief sketch. The first five verses (“dative verses”) are variations on a theme: the poet’s verbal offerings to Indra. The sixth verse, also a dative verse, modulates to the distant past and the god Tvaṣṭar’s gift of the newly fashioned mace to Indra. Verse 7 combines two rare Indra myths: his appropriation of his father’s soma right after his birth and the Emuṣa myth, in which the god Viṣṇu steals a mess of rice porridge while Indra shoots the boar Emuṣa. (For further on this myth, see Introduction, p. 40.) Verses 8–12 treat the Vr̥tra myth for the most part, though with some detours. Verses 13–15 generalize the praise of Indra’s deeds and bring it back to the present time and to the present poet, Nodhas, who names himself in verse 14, while the final verse, 16, summarizes the hymn that precedes and names the ritual application, the “Fallow-bay-yoking” oblation.It is difficult to do justice to this tour de force of poetic craft, and many of its finest effects have not been discussed here. It is, unfortunately, even more difficult to do justice to it in English translation.1.

The hymn is full of phonetic play and alliteration, with numerous somewhat aberrant morphological forms generated for this play. Repetition and variation on this repetition are also conspicuous—for example, the word sanā́t (“from of old”) opening 8a, 10a, 12a, with teasingly close forms (sánemi 9a, sánīḍā 10a) alternating with it.The hymn falls into two main sections. The first five verses are the more conven-tional—if poetically rich—part, treating the Vala myth and especially the role of the Aṅgirases in it. (Interestingly, the Vala myth is absent from I.61.) The first half of verse 6 seems to summarize this deed of Indra’s extravagantly: “This is his most conspicuous deed, the dearest wonder of the wondrous one.” But Nodhas tricks us here, for the second half of the verse concerns an entirely different and much more obscure deed of Indra’s, the swelling of the four, probably celestial, rivers. From 6cd through verse 10 we meet fleetingly recounted fragments of other myths, but these myths seem connected at a structural level, since they involve female figures in pairs or groups working reciprocally or jointly: the rivers of 6cd, the two world-halves of 7 (compared to twin consorts), Night and Dawn (compared to young girls) in 8, black and red cows in 9, and streams again in 10, apparently returning to the rivers of 6cd. In the second half of 10 we encounter a surfeit of females: two words for wives (jáni and pátnī) as well as sisters, all offering friendship to Indra. These females may refer to the streams of the first half of the verse, or to the thoughts converging on Indra in the next verse (11), which are also compared to wives.

The hymn lacks the verbal intricacy of the last two (I.61–62), though it is full of philological problems.The tone of the hymn also differs from the two previous ones: it is far more martial and concerned with Indra’s fearsome power. His aggressive power, even just after birth, is highlighted in verse 1, and the following verses quickly allude to the destruction of various foes, usually for the benefit of one of his clients (e.g., Kutsa, vs. 3) or for mortals in general. Like the last two hymns, this one ends with a sum-mary verse applicable to the “Fallow-bay-yoking” oblation.1. You are great, Indra, you who, on just being born, with your tempests put heaven and earth in (the path of your) onslaught,so that all the vast masses, even the mountains, though firmly fixed, stirred like dust-motes in fear of you.2.

The poet begins by exhorting himself to produce a worthy and well-crafted hymn for these gods (vs. 1), and proceeds to do just that. Verses 2–4 describe the Maruts’ birth and beauty, while verses 5–8 turn to their role in the thunderstorm, with comparisons to various wild animals found in verses 7–8.

Further description of their boisterous behavior occupies verses 10–11.In verse 12 the poet returns to the beginning, by referring to the hymn “we” are offering to the Maruts. Reestablishing the relationship between the mortal worship-ers and the Maruts allows him to make the transition to the boons we ask of them. After providing a model of the fortunate man who receives the Maruts’ aid in verse 13, the poet calls on the gods to grant good things to the patrons and the worshipers in general (vss. 14–15).1.

The first six (65–70) are in the relatively rare dvipadā virāj meter, while the last three are in triṣṭubh. Despite the difference in meter, there is a strong sense of unity in this group of hymns, in phraseology, in style, and in theme. Moreover, somewhat in Vālakhilya fashion there are several paired hymns, especially I.65–66 and I.68–69 (with I.70 acting as a climatic third to that pairing).The most important theme running through the series is Agni’s function as the locus and target of joint action undertaken by men and by gods, and as the representative of the unity thus produced. In this capacity for mortals he is named the Vaiśvānara fire (“fire belonging to all men”—for another, nearby Agni Vaiśvānara hymn see I.59), and the series I.68–70 contains an extended pun on"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"I.65187the constituents of this epithet. In the divine realm the joint action of the gods is represented by the Tānūnaptra rite and its foundation myth, treated in I.72 (see Proferes 2007: 51–61). These complementary aspects of Agni are not restricted to the hymns just named, but surface throughout this series, which thus shows a rare thematic unity.I.65 AgniParāśara Ś āktya10 verses: dvipadā virājAs is generally the case with dvipadā virāj meter, the hymn falls into two-verse units, essentially equivalent to a single trimeter verse (forty syllables, versus forty-four [triṣṭubh] or forty-eight [jagatī]). The five-syllable units in which the verses are orga-nized lend themselves to brief, discrete semantic and syntactic units, producing a mosaic-like effect. In this hymn, as in the following one, the mosaic fragments are often similes—especially pronounced here in the middle verses 5–6, though found throughout. Each simile highlights a particular aspect of Agni.The hymn also follows a ritual and mythological trajectory. It begins with the hidden Agni (vs. 1), alluding in mythological terms to the well-known story of Agni’s flight and rediscovery by the gods, which is treated in verses 2–3, but also, in ritual terms, to the fire hidden in the wood before kindling. This kindling is accom-plished by the end of the hymn, where Agni spreads through the firewood and awakens at dawn, conspicuous and visible from afar (vss. 7–10). The relationship of Agni to waters, in his identity as Apām Napāt, is another theme in the hymn (vss. 4–7, 9), though the epithet Apām Napāt is not mentioned.1. Hiding in secret like a thief with livestock,yoking homage, conveying homage:2. (You) did the clever, of one accord, follow along your tracks;all those worthy of the sacrifice reverently approached you.3. The gods followed the commandments of truth.Like heaven (enclosing) the earth was his enclosing.4. With wonder the waters strengthen the lovely child,well-begotten in the lap of truth, in its womb.5. Like thriving that brings delight, like a broad (place of) peaceful dwelling,like a mountain a source of benefit, like a gush (of water) that brings blessings;6. Like a steed on its course, launched in a surge,like a river (sending) its gush: who can obstruct him?7. Akin to the rivers, like a brother to his sisters,(yet,) like a king his vassals, he devours the wood."},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"I.661888. When, sped by the wind, he has spread out through the wood,Agni cuts the hair of the earth.9.

Like soma, a ritual expert, begotten of truth;ranging widely like livestock with their young, far-radiant.I.66 AgniParāśara Ś āktya10 verses: dvipadā virājLike the previous hymn, this one is constructed of short phrases often consisting of similes. The similes here alternate between images of peace and prosperity and those of turbulent combat, sometimes strikingly juxtaposed, as in the second half of verse 3 or the contrasting halves of verse 4.Toward the end of the hymn we find several puzzles, which have elicited widely differing interpretations—especially verse 8 with its double mention of twins (yamá). In our view the end of the hymn builds toward a ritual climax, found in the final two verses of the hymn (9–10), and verse 8 sets the stage for this, the early-morning sacrifice, by mentioning the risen sun as the twin already born and the soma, not yet pressed, as the twin awaiting birth—both also identified with Agni. Although these identifications would break the pattern of constant refer-ence to Agni set in the earlier parts of the hymn (and our interpretation therefore gives us pause), the final pair of verses also move beyond the stasis of repeated Agni-similes and depict a ritual moment, prefigured, in our view, by the mention of other ritual entities in verse 8.Note the ring-compositional element, the “sight of the sun,” in the first half of verse 1 and the last words of verse 10. This double mention may support our inter-pretation of verse 8 as mentioning the risen sun.1. Glittering like wealth, like the sight of the sun,like life-breath, like one’s own son;2.

The physical counterpart to this mythic concealment is the immanence of fire in wood, in plants, and in water, mentioned at the beginning (vs. 1) and end (vss. 9–10) of the hymn. For similar themes, see I.65.1. A conqueror amid the wood, an ally among mortals;like a king he demands obedience without fail.2. Like peace that brings prosperity, like good resolve;he has become the very attentive Hotar who carries the oblations.3. Taking in his hand all manly powers,sitting down in secret, he sets the gods in (the path of) his onslaught.4.

Its focus is instead on ritual, and especially on the joint activity performed by “all” in their separate ways and the rewards they share because of it (see esp. vss. 3, 4, 5, 8, 9). Although the identity of the “all” is never made explicit, we believe that the poet is depicting the communal fire shared and jointly tended by the united clans, and that the “all” (víśve) are the members of the separate clans serving their shared fire (the Vaiśvānara fire [see Proferes 2007: 46–49 and passim]). In fact, in reading this hymn with its twin, I.69, the motif of the Vaiśvānara fire emerges strongly. In this hymn the focus is on víśva “all,” in the next hymn on náraḥ “(superior) men,” while at the end of I.70 the two words are found sequentially (vss. 9–10). These are exactly the two elements found in the vr̥ddhi bahuvrīhi compound vaiśvānará “belonging to all men,” the very name of the shared clan fire, a word that never appears in this hymn sequence. Thus, I.68–70 contain a buried but persistent pun, with one half of the compound allotted to each of the first two hymns until they are reunited in the third. The phonological resemblance between víśva “all” and víś “clan” is also in play, though the two words are etymologically unrelated.1. Bringing (the sacrifice) to readiness, bustling about, he approaches heaven.He discloses the still and the moving through the nights,2. When, alone of all these gods,the god encompasses (them) by his greatness.3. All take pleasure in your resolve because of this:that you are born alive from the desiccated (wood), o god.4.

They take pleasure in his resolve like sons in their father’s—the powerful ones who obey his command.10. Bringing much livestock, he has opened wide the doors of wealth.He, the master of the house, has emblazoned heaven’s vault with stars.I.69 AgniParāśara Ś āktya10 verses: dvipadā virājTwinned with the preceding hymn (I.68), this hymn also treats the common clan-fire, which serves as a symbol of unity during joint action undertaken by ordinarily sepa-rate groups, although this theme is subtly conveyed. In the first few verses there are only indirect hints: Agni “encompasses” an unspecified set of objects (vs. 2); in verse 4 he takes his place “in the middle” and is compared to a “friendly __ among the people”—parallel passages suggest that “ally” should be supplied in this last phrase.The clans are mentioned explicitly in verse 5, which describes Agni’s extension through the clans, who are brought together, along with their superior men, in the next verse (6). As already noted in the introduction to I.68, these men, the náraḥ, supply the second part of the name of the clan-fire, Vaiśvānara. Agni’s reciprocal relationship and joint action with these men are described in verses 7–8, and, in our view, verse 9 describes the brilliance of the newly kindled clan-fire, which is the focus of the shared sacrificial activity of the united clans. This interpretation is supported by an adjective qualifying Agni in that verse: sáṃjñāta-rūpa. Although most translators take this word as meaning “having a well-known form” on the basis of the verbal root √jñā “recognize,” the idiom sáṃ-jñā has a different and very specific meaning “come to an agreement, act in unison.” This very idiom is found in the previous, twinned hymn, in verse 8, where it describes the mutual action of all the clans, each contributing its own set of skills. Therefore in verse 9 of this hymn Agni is described as the very form or representation of the agreement reached by the clans, as well as the focus of the ritual activity that results from that agreement. (It is worth noting that the final hymn of the R̥gveda, self-consciously advocating unity, contains two occurrences of this lexeme [X.191.2b, d].)"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"I.70192The final verse (10) describes the successful dawn sacrifice and the rising of the sun that accompanies it.

The blazing one, blazing bright like the lover of Dawn,has filled the two conjoined (world-halves), like the light of heaven.2.

In particular he points to the movement toward the unity of a single focal fire (vs. 9) contrasted with the separation of this fire into many, separately served fires (vs. 10), though he fails to mention the verbal encoding of the underlying compound members in these climactic verses 9–10, where all (víśve) bear tribute to the fire (vs. 9) and men (náraḥ) serve him in many places (vs. 10).This hymn also widens the view somewhat, for not only does the fire belong to all men, but simultaneously to the gods (see the paired divine and human in vss. 2, 4, and 6), and it is also related to all natural objects (see vss. 3–4, 7), expressed in series of oppositional merisms, such as “the moving and the still” (vss. 3, 7)."},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"I.71193This final hymn of the dvipadā virāj series has eleven verses, rather than the ten found in the other hymns. This eleventh, unpaired verse describes the power, skill, and eagerness of the martial Agni, and thus expresses one of the roles for which the Vaiśvānara fire is especially designed: to unite the clans into a force able to oppose its enemies. (See Proferes 2007 passim.) It may be taken as a summary verse for the entire sequence of Vaiśvānara hymns.1. Might we vanquish the many inspired thoughts of the stranger by our inspired thought;might bright-blazing Agni attain all things (for us),2.

It begins with a sexually suggestive verse describing the kindling of"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"I.71194the ritual fire by the fingers of the officiant manipulating the kindling sticks. Verse 2 switches to the mythic past and a fairly standard and straightforward summary of the role of the Aṅgirases in the opening of the Vala cave, but nothing in the hymn is straightforward after this. Verses treating the here-and-now of the ritual alternate with snippets of mythology.The most dramatic mythological material is found discontinuously in verses 5 and 8, which treat the well-known if ill-understood story of the incest between Heaven and his daughter (see also X.61.5–7, as well as Jamison 1991: 288–301) and especially the punishment meted out to the offender by his avenger, who is clearly Agni. Since the birth of the Aṅgirases resulted from this incest, this myth fits both the dedicand of the hymn and the Aṅgiras verse (2) that follows the opening, and even the sexual innuendo of verse 1 may have evoked, or been evoked by, the incest theme.The other mythological allusion is to Mātariśvan’s stealing of fire (vs. 4); it is not clear whether this reference is meant to have any points of contact with the other mythological portions of the hymn. It does, however, connect with the theme of the interaction between gods and men, especially with Agni as go-between, found in verses 3, 4, and 7. Another puzzle is why Mitra and Varuṇa intrude into this Agni hymn in verse 9, though the appearance of the Sun in that same verse takes us back to verse 2. Ritual concerns are the focus of vss. 3, 6, and 7.In short, in terms of structure this hymn neither follows a point-to-point tra-jectory nor displays an omphalos/ring-compositional shape. Instead it seems to show, at least in its central sections, sets of interlocking, overlapping paired verses—3 + 6, 4 + 7, 5 + 8—loosely nestled within a ring consisting of 2 + 9, and perhaps, more loosely still, 1 + 10.1. The desirous females belonging to the same nest [=fingers] stimulate the desirous male [=Agni] close by—as wives of the same nest [=household] stimulate their own husband.The sisters [=fingers] have delighted in the dusky one and in the ruddy one [=two fire-kindling sticks], like cows in the brilliantly dawning dawn.2. Even the firm fastnesses did our fathers, the Aṅgirases, break with their hymns, and the rock with their shout.They made the way of lofty heaven for us; they found the day and the sun, the beacon of the ruddy dawn.3.

Be attentive (to us) in the face of this curse.I.72 AgniParāśara Ś āktya10 verses: triṣṭubhAnother hymn in which the overall structure and the relationships among the parts are unclear. The dominant myth here is the gods’ search for and recov-ery of Agni, who had gone missing, and his (re)establishment as the ritual fire. This myth is treated in verses 2, 4, and 6 at least, and verses 3 and 5 are prob-ably related as well. However, sorting out the narrative(s) is made difficult by the lack of overt subjects (as Geldner already pointed out) and by the number of injunctive verb forms, as well as some perfects that can have either presential or preterital value. These grammatical ambiguities allow much of the hymn to be"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"I.72196applicable simultaneously to the mythic past of the gods and the ritual present of men. Other mythic references include the dog Saramā’s discovery and release of the penned-in cattle (vs. 8), thematically parallel to the discovery and recovery of Agni, and a puzzling reference to Aditi and her sons the Ādityas and the suckling of a bird (vs. 9).What provides some unity to the hymn is less these unfinished scraps of mythical narrative than a focus on the vocabulary of knowledge and discovery: forms of the root vid “find, acquire, possess” and the homonymous root vid “know, discern,” as well as the semantically related roots jñā “know, recognize” and cit “discern,” are found, often multiply, in almost every verse. The hymn can thus be read as a sort of meta-reflection on the process of learning.Another important feature of the hymn is the preoccupation with names and bodies, rather like the later category of “name-and-form” (nāma-rūpa). Proferes argues that verse 5 contains an early reflection of the Tānūnaptra rite, in which the sacrificer and the officiating priests at a soma sacrifice enter into a pact to be loyal to each other. The charter myth for this vow involves the gods all depositing their bodies in a common place (the sun, or Indra standing for the sun) to produce a common defense against external enemies. (See Proferes 2007: 59 for I.72.5 and 51–61 for the rite in general and its mythological background.) We agree with his analysis, but in fact think that the theme is more prominent in the hymn than in just that one verse. The central verses seem to suggest that the gods’ quest for Agni and their discovery of him and his name (not overtly present, but formulai-cally suggested) in verse 2 and their ritual service to him in verse 3 allow them to acquire their own ritually worthy names and to make their own bodies also worthy of ritual service in verse 4. This leads to the mutual exchange and mutual possession of bodies in the Tānūnaptra verse proper (5). Thus rendered ritually worthy, they find within Agni the intricate and secret “tracks” of the ritual itself (vs. 6ab), a discovery that allows them to protect their own (6c), and that also leads to the beneficial actions of Agni in the world of men (6d, 7). More benefits follow in verses 8–9, though the connection of these to what precedes is admit-tedly hazy. The “deposit” in a central entity, here Agni, that is the heart of the Tānūnaptra pact seems to reappear in verse 10, in a context both cosmogonic (10b) and apparently ritual (10cd).The depiction of Agni in this hymn as the locus for the joint deposit of the bod-ies of the gods in the Tānūnaptra myth is the mirror and complementary image of Agni Vaiśvānara, the fire “belonging to all men,” around which all the allied human clans rally, in the earlier hymns of Parāśara Śāktya’s Agni cycle (esp. I.68–70).1.

It begins with three verses dense with similes, recalling the first two hymns, I.65–66, which were similarly simile rich. The three verses are entirely descriptive of Agni, particularly of the sacrificial fire in its position on the ritual ground, but the god’s name is not mentioned until verse 4, where he is kindled by men.The rest of the hymn concerns Agni as the central focus of humans, of gods, and of ritual substances (for this last, see vs. 6), Agni as a distributor and redistributor of goods and services among gods, patrons, and poets, a role summed up in the word “portion” found in verses 5, 6, 7, and 10. This theme was announced in the first pāda of the hymn, and the “wealth acquired from one’s father” of 1a recurs in verse 9.Although this hymn lacks overt reference to the motifs of the Vaiśvānara fire and the Tānūnaptra rite, in which men and gods respectively become united by joint action involving the fire, the interrelations among men, among gods, and among men and gods depicted in this hymn recall the more explicit treat-ment of those motifs in earlier parts of the cycle. That both gods and men and, among men, both poets and patrons serve the fire in similar ways and seek similar rewards depicts these groups of beings as having a certain equality before Agni.1.

If so, the dazzling skill of the son is not on view in the work of his father in the opening Agni hymns (74–79) or in the All God hymns (89–90), which seem more dutiful than engaged, but when he treats other gods, especially the Maruts (85–88) and Dawn (92), his poetry can be inspired.I.74 AgniGotama Rāhūgaṇa9 verses: gāyatrīThe favor shown to the pious man by Agni is the theme of this short hymn. The beneficiary of Agni’s patronage is identified as dāśvā́ṃs “pious” in verses 2, 8, and 9, and Agni’s activities on his behalf are the subject of the middle verses 4–5. These"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"I.75200activities are mostly the familiar ones, of serving as messenger between the mortal and divine realms and going after the gods in order to bring them to the sacrifice (see esp. vss. 4, 6–7), but Agni is also credited with aiding the pious man under attack (vs. 2), leading to the god’s covert identification with Indra, via the epithet “Vr̥tra-smasher” (vs. 3). Another unusual feature of this hymn is the appeal to what “the people say” about Agni and his devotee (vss. 3, 5).1. Reverently approaching the ceremony, might we speak a solemn formula to Agni,to him who listens, (when he is) in the distance and with us (here),2. Who, at the forefront in the “blizzards” (of attacks) when the separate peoples were clashing together,guarded for the pious man his patrimony.3.

And a brilliant, lofty abundance of heroes, Agni, do you strive to winfrom the gods, o god, for the pious man.I.75 AgniGotama Rāhūgaṇa5 verses: gāyatrīThis short hymn begins (vs. 1) by urging Agni to enjoy our praise of him, which the poet hopes will be “a winning sacred formulation” (vs. 2). But, contravening our expectations, in place of this promised bra﻿́hman the poet instead asks a series of abrupt questions in verse 3. Then once again our expectations are disappointed, for although verse 4 at first appears to contain the answers to the questions posed in verse 3, only the first question is actually answered, while the rest of verse 4, though"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"I.76201maintaining the clausal structure of verse 3, is only vaguely related in meaning to the corresponding clauses in verse 3. The hymn ends (vs. 5) with a conventional directive to Agni to perform sacrifice, with its imperative matching the imperative beginning the hymn (“take delight,” 1a).Although the hymn is too brief to develop the theme of thwarted expectations sketched above, it does uninsistently suggest that verbal form may trump content in the construction of praise poetry and that the audience should be wary of being led astray by a poet’s expressed intentions.1. Take delight in the most extensive speech, which affords most delight to the gods,while pouring the oblations into your own mouth.2. Then, o Agni, best of Aṅgirases, best of ritual adepts, something dear to youmight we speak—a winning sacred formulation.3. Who is the kinsman of your peoples?

Sacrifice for us to Mitra and Varuṇa; sacrifice to the gods, to lofty truth.Agni, you will sacrifice to your own home.I.76 AgniGotama Rāhūgaṇa5 verses: triṣṭubhThe hymn begins (vs. 1) with anxious questions about how best to worship Agni in order to harness his powers. The structure of this question verse is reminiscent of verse 3 of the previous hymn (I.75), with each pāda containing a separate query; however, the questions here are more focused on how best to please Agni, and the longer line of triṣṭubh meter makes the questions seem less abrupt than in the gāyatrī of I.75.3. As in I.75 the questions here do not receive explicit answers. Instead the poet devotes most of the rest of the hymn to detailing Agni’s duties and seeking Agni’s aid as ritual performer and priest (see esp. vss. 2, 4), to bring the gods, especially Indra (see vs. 3c), to the ritual ground and to sacrifice to them.1.

Lexical similarities continue through the hymn: śáṃtama “most beneficial” (77.2a, 76.1b), various forms of the verb √vī “pursue” (77.2c, 4b; 76.4c), et cetera. Like I.76, this hymn also focuses on Agni’s role as priest and sacrificer, although the rhetoric in this hymn is somewhat more expansive than in I.76.1. How should we do pious service to Agni? Which hymn enjoyable to the gods is spoken to him, the radiant—the one who, the immortal among mortals, the truthful Hotar, as the best sacrificer just does so [=sacrifices] to the gods?2.

Its most noteworthy feature is that the first two pādas of the last verse (5) break the pattern of the preceding ones, and it is here that the name Agni appears for the first and only time in the hymn, with the reference switched from the 2nd person of the rest of the hymn to 3rd person in its final verse. It is also striking that in verses 1 and 4 the refrain is syntactically integral to the verse, with the initial “to you” the object of the verb in the third-pāda refrain, whereas in the middle verses 2–3 the refrain is syntactically separate, and the initial “to you” is construed with the verb in the first hemistich. Thus, its formal properties are the whole point of the hymn, with meaning essentially backgrounded. For discussion of other ways in which Gotama privileges form over content, see the introduction to I.75.1. To you, o boundless Jātavedas, with a hymn do we Gotamaskeep bellowing, with éclat.2. And to you with a hymn does Gotama, desirous of wealth, show friendship.– We keep bellowing to (you), with éclat.3.

The last three are relatively simple in their construction and their contents, but the first is rich and vividly descriptive and poses some problems of interpretation.This first hymn segment begins (vs. 1) with quick sketches of different forms of fire: fire as sun (pāda a); fire as lightning (pāda b); ritual fire, especially as it is kindled at dawn (pādas cd). This verse manages to convey dynamism without the use of a single finite verb or participle. The next two verses (2–3) take up the second image, fire as lightning, and develop it in unexpected ways. In our reading, the ritual fire (that is, the god Agni) is compared with and ultimately identified with the thunderstorm, and therefore its product, the fructifying rain, can be pre-sented, paradoxically, as the product of fire itself, a substance that in nature cannot produce water. In verse 2 the zigzagging lightning flashes are the fire’s flames; the bellowing bull is the roaring fire itself, and the flying mists and thundering clouds are the billowing smoke. Verse 3 takes this naturalistic comparison to its logical but unnatural conclusion: if fire is the embodiment of the thunderstorm, then it is full of rain, a most desirable product, here called “the milk of truth.” In the last half of this verse the principal Ādityas as well as Wind become involved by engorging the clouds with water.After this complex and allusive vignette, the other three hymn segments are a serious anticlimax. In verses 4–6 Agni is asked to give wealth and fame and to protect against demons. Wealth is also the preoccupation of verses 7–9. In the final three verses the poet, Gotama, exhorts himself to give hymns to Agni, and then implores Agni to keep demons away. There is nothing in these nine verses to arrest the attention, but Gotama’s first three verses are indeed a worthy gift for the god.1. A golden-haired one in his spread through the dusky realm—a snake, tumultuous, swooping like the wind—blazing bright (when he becomes) cognizant of Dawn, like the glorious busy (Dawns themselves) actually present.2. Your fine-feathered (lightning flashes) zigzagged along their ways. The black bull keeps bellowing. If he is really here,he has come here with his (lightning flashes) like kindly, smiling (girls). The mists fly; the clouds thunder.3. When he, swollen with the milk of truth, (has come) leading them [=the lightning flashes] along the straightest paths of truth—Aryaman, Mitra, Varuṇa, and the Earth-circling (Wind) engorge the skin in the womb of the nearer (realm)."},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"I.802054.

It portrays Indra’s defeat of Vr̥tra and his release of the pent-up waters with admirable clarity, though it lacks the richness of detail of I.32 and the intimacy of the portrait of the overmatched and then defeated Vr̥tra found in that other hymn. Instead this hymn simply keeps repeating the climactic moment when Indra smote Vr̥tra with his mace (vájra). In fact, the mace seems almost as much the hero of the hymn as Indra is: in the first thirteen verses, those con-cerned most directly with the Vr̥tra battle, only three (4, 9, 10) lack a mention of the mace. Verse 8 is especially noteworthy in containing the only occurrence of plural vájra in the R̥gveda, in a puzzling context: “Your maces have been dis-persed across the ninety navigable (rivers).” This passage superficially reminds us of I.32.14, in which Indra, having slain Vr̥tra, flees in fear across “the ninety-nine"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"I.80206flowing rivers,” but the implications of our passage seem more positive. Perhaps the point is that, once the rivers were released to flow in all directions, Indra’s power, embodied in the mace, was subdivided and spread across the whole fertile, water-fed landscape.The fifth-pāda refrain in every verse is an especially salient feature of the hymn and concerns the verbal encouragement given to Indra. The subject of the plural verb árcann ánu is never specified, and since the verb is in the injunc-tive, it is ambiguous between present and indefinite mythic past. These uncer-tainties are no doubt deliberate: the subject can be the current poet-sacrificers, their legendary counterparts (Atharvan, Manu, and Dadhyañc mentioned in vs. 16), or the Maruts, the gods who in mythic time provided encouragement to Indra before and during the Vr̥tra combat. A direct-speech example of such encouragement is given in verse 3, and verse 9 encourages the encouragers in this action. The relationship between the current poets and their predecessors is built into the structure of the hymn, in a telling ring between the first and last verses. Verse 1 mentions the formulation created “in the current style” (itthā́), while in verse 16 formulations made “in the older style” (pūrváthā), imitating illustrious named past poets and sacrificers, are offered to Indra. Thus the hymn implicitly suggests that not only was Indra’s great victory impossible without his cheering comrades, but that poets today, like those in the past, fulfill the same role.1. Because right at the time of the soma exhilaration the formulator created a strengthening (formulation) in the current style,o strongest mace-bearer, with your might you ordered the serpent forth from the earth.– They cheer on your sovereign power.2.

(Otherwise the fifth pāda is syntactically independent but linked thematically.)The strength and power of Indra are the main theme, but it is clear that for the poet the purpose of Indra’s might is simply to enable him to provide his worshipers with goods (vss. 2–3, 6–9)—particularly those goods belonging to “the stranger” (vss. 6, 9), in this case probably a non-sacrificing member of the Ārya community, which Indra should redistribute to more deserving men. The demands for largesse become increasingly peremptory, and the quantity of praise given to Indra is rather limited. One wonders how much success this bid for riches would have met with.1. Indra has been strengthened for exhilaration, the Vr̥tra-smasher for strength, by superior men.Just him do we invoke in great contests, and him in a petty one;when prizes (are set) he will help us.2.

These (people who are) kin to you [=us] foster everything of value.Because you detect the possessions of the stranger, of the impious peoples,bring their possessions here to us.I.82 IndraGotama Rāhūgaṇa6 verses: paṅkti, except jagatī 6Like the three Indra hymns (I.61–63) of our poet’s descendant, Nodhas Gautama, this hymn was composed to accompany the “Fallow-bay-yoking” oblation at the end of the soma sacrifice, at which the two horses of Indra are hitched up for the return journey to heaven. The first five verses are in paṅkti meter, with the fifth pāda a refrain announcing the sacrificer’s intention to per-form this yoking. In the body of those verses the poet announces that the goal of the sacrifice has been achieved (vss. 1–2): both Indra and his companions the Maruts have received praise and oblations, and they have provided presents in return. He offers Indra a last bit of praise and a last oblation to send him on his way (vss. 3–4), and then turns to the actual yoking of the pair of horses (vs. 5).The final verse is in a different meter and expresses the act of yoking in a different tense and mood. The subtle distinction in wording between the refrain of verses 1–5 and its variant in the first pāda of the final verse (6a) is signifi-cant: the refrain contains the 1st sg. root aorist subjunctive yo﻿́jā in the prospec-tive/volitional sense “I will yoke,” while the version in the final verse transposes the formula into the present indicative with yunájmi, and adds the instrumen-tal bráhmaṇā “with a sacred formulation.” These changes make the statement into a “performative” in the technical linguistic sense; that is, the utterance by itself performs the action it expresses: “I (hereby) yoke your two shaggy fallow bays with a solemn formulation.” The bráhman refers to the entire hymn that"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"I.83210precedes, and it is the very recitation of the hymn, identified as a bráhman, that performs the ritual act of yoking.A particularly appealing part of the hymn is the mention of Indra’s wife in verses 5–6: the poet is concerned to send the god directly back home to his “dear wife” and further exhilaration. See also III.53.4–6.1. Listen well to our hymns, bounteous one, not like a nay-sayer.When you will make us the beneficiaries of your liberality, it’s just then that you will achieve your goal.– Now, Indra, I will hitch up your two fallow bays.2. They have eaten; for they have brought themselves to exhilaration; they have shaken down dear things.They have been praised—the self-radiant (Maruts)—with the newest inspired thought.– Now, Indra, I will hitch up your two fallow bays.3. We would extol you of wholly lovely appearance, o bounteous one.Praised, drive forth now following your will, once your chariot box is full.– Now, Indra, I will hitch up your two fallow bays.4. The only one who will mount on the bullish, cow-finding chariotis the one who will take care that the cup is full for your “Fallow-bay-yoking” oblation, Indra.– Now, Indra, I will hitch up your two fallow bays.5. Let your right (horse) be yoked, and your left one, you of a hundred resolves.With this (chariot) drive up to your dear wife, while (you are still) exhilarated from the stalk.– Now, Indra, I will hitch up your two fallow bays.6. With (this) sacred formulation I (hereby) hitch up your two shaggy fallow bays. Drive forth; you have taken (the reins? the mace?) in your fists.The wild pressed soma-drinks have stirred you up. Accompanied by Pūṣan, o mace-bearer, you will become exhilarated along with your wife.I.83 IndraGotama Rāhūgaṇa6 verses: jagatīIn this hymn the poet uses two different senses of the word “first” to imbue the good sacrificer with the qualities and prestige of the legendary institutors of the"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"I.83211sacrifice. At the beginning of verse 1 the good sacrificer is “the first” to attain to wealth provided by Indra. The next two verses continue the characterization of the good sacrificer and the good life bestowed on him by the gods. The next two verses (4–5) pick up the word “first” (prathamá) that opened the hymn, but here not in the sense of “foremost, first in line” as in verse 1, but rather “primal, original”: these verses concern the first establishment of the sacrifice and the actions of the famous primordial sacrificers. In the final verse (6) we return to the current sacrifice, but by putting the model of the original sacrificers before us, the poet implies that the present-day sacrificer is replicating their actions and is identified with them. This is one of the common themes of R̥gvedic sacrifice: that each new sacrifice is an enact-ment of the first one.1. The first to come to (wealth) consisting of horses, to cows with your help, o Indra, is the mortal who pursues (his ritual duties) well.Just him do you engorge with more abundant goods, as waters, conspicuous from everywhere, engorge a river.2. Like the goddesses, the Waters, they [=gods] approach (the place) associated with oblation; they look downward onto the extended (soma-filter? sacrifice?) as if onto an extensive airy realm.The gods lead forward the one who seeks the gods. Like suitors, they delight in the man who pleases (them) with the sacred formulation.3. You have placed a speech worthy to be spoken in the two (priests), the pair who ritually serve with their offering spoons extended.Not mustered (to battle), he dwells in peace under your commandment, he thrives. Propitious is your potency for the sacrificer who presses soma.4. The Aṅgirases, who had (previously) kindled the fires with ritual labor and good ritual performance, after that first acquired their life-force.They collected together all the sustenance of the niggard, livestock consisting of horses and cows—the superior men.5. With sacrifices the Atharvan first stretched the paths. Thereupon was the Sun, the protector of commandments, the tracker, born.Uśanā Kāvya drove the cows together. We sacrifice to the immortal birth of Yama.6.

The first eighteen verses are arranged in tr̥cas, and it ends with a single pragātha. The contents range from the most banal invitation to the sacrifice to elusive and allusive treatments of little-known myths. There are a number of reminiscences of the Indra hymns pre-ceding it in the Gotama collection.The first six verses, in anuṣṭubh meter, appear to form a unity, urging Indra to come to the soma sacrifice in clichéd and predictable phraseology. The next tr̥ca (vss. 7–9) is in uṣṇih meter (8 8 12); the last four syllables of the third pāda are a semidetached refrain (“Indra indeed!”), so that the verses present themselves like gāyatrī (i.e., 8 8 8). The contrast between the good sacrificer and his unsatisfactory counterpart is the theme.The next tr̥ca (vss. 10–12), in paṅkti meter, is highly reminiscent of I.80, also in paṅkti. As in that hymn the fifth pāda of each verse is a refrain syntactically unconnected to the rest of the verse. In fact, the last six syllables of the refrain match those of I.80, and in order to make sense of the refrain here, we must supply the verb (“they cheer on”) from the refrain of I.80. This tr̥ca concerns the mix-ing of milk with the pressed soma, in metaphorical terms—with the milk streams depicted as buffalo-cows. Beneath this first metaphor there may be a second: it is possible that the Maruts lurk behind the buffalo-cow facade. (Remember that the Maruts were one of the possible subjects of the refrain in I.80.) An association of the Maruts with “the ritual midpoint” here might allude to their recent incorpora-tion as recipients of the oblation at the Midday Pressing.Another reminiscence of I.80 is found in the next tr̥ca (vss. 13–15), in gāyatrī, which treats in most condensed and puzzling fashion the myth of Dadhyañc and the horse’s head. (For this myth in general, see Macdonell 1897: 141–42.) Dadhyañc and his father Atharvan were mentioned in passing in the last verse of I.80 (vs. 16). In other versions of the myth Dadhyañc substitutes a horse’s head for his own in order to declare the secret location of Tvaṣṭar’s soma. In these three short verses we find Dadhyañc, the horse’s head, and Tvaṣṭar, but the narrative in which they are involved is entirely unclear and we confess ourselves mystified.The last tr̥ca (vss. 16–18) consists entirely of anxious questions, mostly in con-nection with the sacrifice, reminiscent of the cascade of questions in other Gotama hymns (I.75.3, 76.1, 77.1). The first verse (16) wonders who will be able to yoke particularly ill-behaved cattle and bring them here. “Here” seems to refer to the sacrifice, and the best guess as to the identity of the cattle is the Maruts, who are the dedicands of Gotama’s next four hymns (I.85–88). The next verse (17) is more confused, but the location of Indra and indeed his very existence are in question, and a formal spokesman on behalf of mortals is sought. The questions are more"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"I.84213clearly ritual in verse 18, ending with the sacrificer’s self-doubt about his status with the gods he sacrifices to. The final two verses (19–20), an independent pragātha, seem designed to quell this doubt, asserting that Indra himself, in a turn-about, will praise the sacrificer and show him mercy, as well as offering him help and goods.Although no strong unity among the various pieces of this hymn is perceptible, it does mimic in certain ways the progress of a soma sacrifice. It opens with the invita-tion (vss. 1–6), made more pointed by the contrast between our well-made and deserv-ing sacrifice and the behavior of ungenerous mortals (vss. 7–9). Verses 10–12 concern the actual preparation of the soma (and also refer, in vs. 7, to the ritual midpoint). Verses 13–15 can be seen as a mythic interlude, praising the great deeds of Indra while he is present on the ritual ground. Verses 16–18 raise doubts about the efficacy of the sacrifice that has been, or is being, performed—doubts somewhat allayed by the final two verses (19–20), which end with the usual requests for benefits from the god.1. The soma has been pressed for you, Indra. O strongest bold one, come here.Let Indrian strength permeate you, as the sun permeates the airy realm with its rays.2. The two fallow bays convey Indra of irresistible strengthup to the praises of the seers and to the sacrifice of the sons of Manu.3.

Chant now to Indra and speak solemn words.The pressed drops have exhilarated him. Do homage to (his) preeminent might.6. No one is a better charioteer than you, Indra, when you control your two fallow bays.No one has reached you in greatness, not (even) one with good horses.7. He who alone apportions the goods to the pious mortal,the unrepulsable master – (that’s) Indra indeed!8. When will he kick the ungenerous mortal with his foot like a mushroom?When will he listen to our hymns? – Indra indeed!9. For someone who has pressed soma seeks to entice you here, away from the many.He has control of powerful strength – Indra indeed!10.

One stylistic peculiarity is the ten-dency to repeat with minimal variation parts of one verse in the next, an example of concatenative repetition; see 2c/3ab; 4cd/5a; 6c/7b, d; 10a/11a.Although the focus throughout is firmly on the Maruts, there is one seemingly intrusive verse (9), where the Maruts are unmentioned and mythologically irrel-evant, in which Tvaṣṭar fashions the mace for Indra to slay Vr̥tra. Indra’s release of the waters after the slaying must be the point of contact, since the next two verses (10–11) concern the Maruts’ tipping the heavenly well to pour out its water.1. Those who go forth in beauty like wives, spanned together on their journey, the sons of Rudra, possessing wondrous power—for the Maruts made the two world-halves grow strong—the heroes reach exhilaration, eager at the rites.2.

Verse 1 makes the outlines of this structure clear: a genitive rela-tive pronoun (yásya “whose, of whom”) introducing a clause in which the Maruts perform some service for the man so identified, with a main clause expressing the rewards this man receives. (Roughly paraphrased, in vs. 1 “whose dwelling you protect, he has the best protector.”) With this structure set, the poet feels free to attenuate and manipulate it. In our view, verses 2 and 3 are examples of this same structure, but the yásya has been gapped in verse 2 and must be supplied from verse 1, along with a verb for 2a. Moreover, the main clause expressing the reward is postponed until verse 3c, and there are three different relative clauses that it com-pletes (2a, 2bc, 3ab). The repeated vā’s (“or”) allow this submerged structure to be discerned, despite the gapping. The three clauses define three different beneficiaries of the Maruts’ favor: the sacrificer (2a), the poet himself (2bc), or the poet’s patron (“prize-seeker” 3ab).Verses 4–5 continue the fronted genitive pattern, but now with a demonstra-tive pronoun, not a relative. The referent is still the Maruts’ client, and his success becomes magnified in these verses; not only is his sacrifice a success (vs. 4), but he subjugates the surrounding peoples, and his sacrificial offerings go all the way to heaven (vs. 5).Verse 6 abruptly switches to the 1st plural from the 3rd singular: it’s we who have been performing all this sacrificial labor, and the poet implicitly identifies"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"I.87217us with the anonymous hard-working and well-rewarded man of the first five verses. The 3rd sg. sacrificer returns in verses 7–8, with the syntactic structure switched: the main clause and happy reward precede the relative yásya clause (see esp. vs. 7). The last two verses call on the Maruts for their help, especially against aggressors.Gotama’s penchant for elaborate and varied syntactic patterning has been noted previously in the introductions to several of his hymns.1. O Maruts of extensive might, certainly the man over whose dwelling place you keep protective watch from heaven,he has the best protector.2. Or he by whose sacrifices (you were attracted), o you whose vehicle is the sacrifice, or of the thoughts of which inspired poetyou heard the call, o Maruts—3. Or for which prize-seeker you fashioned an inspired poet to follow,he will go to a pen full of cattle.4. Of that hero here the soma has been pressed at the rituals of day(break) on his ritual grass;his solemn speech and exhilarating drink are being announced.5. To him let the beings listen attentively, to him who dominates all the separate peoples.His are the refreshing drinks that have run even to the sun.6. For through many autumns we have done pious work, o Maruts,with the help of the separate peoples.7. O Maruts who receive the first of the sacrifice, let that mortal be well-portionedwhose pleasurable offerings you will guide.8. You superior men whose strength is real, you know the sweat of the one laboring to exhaustion,or the desire of the one who seeks the (ritual) track.9. You whose strength is real—make it [=strength] manifest by your greatness.Smite the demon with your lightning.10. Conceal the concealable darkness. Run over every rapacious one.Make the light that we desire.I.87 MarutsGotama Rāhūgaṇa6 verses: jagatīThe gleeful density of descriptive adjectives in verse 1 opens this hymn with a bang. It is only in the final pāda of this first verse that we encounter a verb—and its"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"I.87218subject is explicitly left unspecified (“whoever they are”). On the one hand, they need not be named, as the descriptions are enough to identify them as Maruts; on the other hand, it is frequently stated that individual Maruts can’t be told apart. The next two verses (2–3) are more dynamic, depicting the Maruts’ usual wild jour-ney, with its thunder, lightning, and rain.The first half of verse 4 returns to the style of verse 1, with a torrent of adjectives, this time applied not to the plural Maruts, but to the singular “flock” (gaṇá). The second half of this verse opens with the 2nd sg. verb “you are.” Although most inter-preters take this as an address to the Marut flock, with a shift of person—and this would be the default reading—we believe something more tricky is going on. The patronymic of our poet Gotama is Rāhūgaṇa, whose second element is this word “flock.” On the basis of this shared verbal designation, Gotama seems to be address-ing himself and identifying himself with the Maruts, particularly as the “furtherer of this insight,” that is, as a producer of sacral poetry arising from inner insight. (He may call himself a requiter of debts because he pays with his verbal labor for the benefits given by both gods and patrons.) He clarifies this identification in the fol-lowing verse (5). We are poets because of our kinship with our ancestral father, that is, the Marut flock (pāda a). As with them, our speech (“tongue”) is inspired by the vision (“eye”) produced by soma (pāda b), and we aspire to emulate the Maruts, who chanted to Indra to encourage him in the Vr̥tra battle and acquired a share in the sacrifice (pādas cd). (The relationship between Gotama Rāhūgaṇa, the Maruts, and verbal inspiration is explored even more elaborately in the following hymn, I.88.)The hymn ends (vs. 6) with a more conventional depiction of the Maruts.1. Projecting power and strength, copious, unbowable, unfaltering, possessing the silvery drink,most delightful, most manly, with their unguents they have anointed themselves—whoever they are—like the ruddy (dawns) with stars.2. When you have set your mind on journeying on the byways like birds, o Maruts, along who knows what path,the casks on your chariots drip. Sprinkle ghee the color of honey for the one who chants.3. At their drives, at their journeys the earth trembles like one with faltering step, when they hitch up, for beauty.Playful, boisterous, with glinting spears, the shakers admire their own greatness.4. For such is the flock: youthful, self-propelling, possessing dappled horses, irrepressible, showing mastery, swathed in powers.And you are a real, irreproachable requiter of debts, a furtherer of this insight here. Therefore you [=Gotama Rāhūgaṇa] are (also) a bullish flock.5.

For splendor they join themselves with radiant beams, with rays, with those equipped with chant—the well-spangled ones,possessing axes and arrows, fearless. They know their own dear Marut nature.I.88 MarutsGotama Rāhūgaṇa6 verses: prastārapaṅkti 1, 6; triṣṭubh 2–4; virāḍrūpā 5Metrically, thematically, and poetically complex, this hymn brings Gotama’s Marut collection to a worthy end. It is structured as a “journey” hymn—the Maruts’ jour-ney to and arrival at the sacrifice—but unlike the general run of such hymns, with stereotyped and simple expressions, this is a superbly crafted example of the genre, which develops in unpredictable directions.The hymn is organized by pairs of verses. The first two describe the glittering flight of the Maruts, in fairly typical terms, with special emphasis on their chariots. The focus shifts to the waiting poets in the next verse pair (3–4). At the beginning of verse 3 the Maruts are said to “have axes on their bodies.” This detail seems at first just to continue the inventory of the Maruts’ equipment found in the previous verses, but the poet turns it into a telling image: the poets will raise up their poems “like trees,” thus inviting the Maruts to chop them down with their axes—that is, to take possession of the poems. The next verse (4) picks up another superficially straightforward characterization of the Maruts and complicates it with reference to the poets. In verse 1 the Maruts were urged to “fly like birds” to the sacrifice; in verse 4 unspecified plural subjects “wheel like vultures” (pāda 1). In our view these vul-tures are the poets (the Gotamas named later in the verse), mentally circling around the dhī́ “insight, poetic vision” (pāda b) that they are seeking in order to produce a bráhman, a “sacred formulation,” fit for the Maruts. In the second half of the verse they succeed in making this bra﻿́hman (pāda c) and, in a different image, push the fountainhead of poetic inspiration upward in order to drink from it (pāda d). They had also been wheeling around the goddess vārkāryā́ (pāda 4b). This hapax has been much discussed, and is generally considered to be the name of the Gotamas’ muse, their “Sangeskunst.” We will propose our own interpretation below.The last two verses (5–6) depict the simultaneous arrival of the Maruts and of the inspired thought for the poem in their honor, again in complex and obscure imagery. The literary epiphany of a god is often marked linguistically by deictic pronouns and/or the aorist of immediacy (“just now”). The last two verses of I.88 begin with paired double deictics: (vs. 5) etát tyád and (vs. 6) eṣā́ syā́ both mean-ing “this very,” and verse 5 contains also the aorist aceti “has just appeared/been"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"I.88220perceived,” marking the arrival of both the poem and the gods. Verse 6 is the most enigmatic of the hymn, though the general situation is clear: the Maruts have just arrived, and they are greeted—by something that both “sounds” and is “caused to sound.” This something is identified as anubhartrī́, another feminine-gender hapax; it seems a good interpretive strategy to attempt to connect the two mysteri-ous feminines, vārkāryā́ in verse 4 and anubhartrī́ here. Both of them are fairly easy to understand on a literal level: the former means literally “water-maker,” while the latter is made up of the preverb ánu and an agent noun of the root bhr̥. The lexeme ánu-bhr̥ has a quite specific value in the R̥gveda and Atharvaveda: it means “pen-etrate sexually, stick (one’s penis) in.” It is, of course, a piquant paradox that the “penis wielder” should be feminine. With this meaning in mind, vārkāryā́ in verse 4 becomes somewhat clearer: the “water-maker” can also refer to the penis. But what would be the figurative or metaphorical sense of these two words, and how, in par-ticular, can the literal sense be made to conform with the statements in verse 6 that the object is question both sounds and is made to sound? The riddle is solved if we assume that it is a musical instrument, and in fact that it is the first reference to the “Indian lute,” the vīṇā (the first occurrence of that word is in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā, an early Vedic prose text), a noun of feminine gender. At least some of the forms of this musical instrument bear a remarkable resemblance to male genitalia. The poet brings his hymn to a climax with this clever sexual pun, which surely would have been appreciated by the lusty Maruts. (This verse and its role in the hymn are discussed in more detail in Jamison 1981.)1. With your chariots fitted with lightning bolts and with spears, whose wings are horses, accompanied by lovely chants, drive here, o Maruts.Fly here like birds, with highest refreshment for us, you masters of artifice.2. With the ruddy, tawny horses they drive at will for beauty, with their horses that outstrip chariots—provided with hatchets (the Marut flock) is sparkling like a brilliant.

Still, there is a pleasing symmetry, especially at the beginning and end. This feature is clear in the first two verses of the hymn, where the word bhadrá “auspicious” is applied both to the ideas that mortals will acquire and turn into the praise hymns for the gods and to the favors that the gods will bestow on the properly worshiping humans in return. These unspecified benevolent gods return toward the end of the hymn (vss. 8–9), and the particular favor we desire from them is to secure our proper length of life (see esp. vss. 8cd, 9), the very request with which the first verse pair ended (vs. 2d)In between are a series of verses invoking various gods and asking for their help. The longest list is found in verse 3, but gods or cosmic forces are named in every verse—from the very prominent, such as the various Ādityas (vs. 3) and Indra (vs. 6), to the obscure and marginal, notably Tārkṣya (vs. 6c), a deified racehorse, to judge from its other appearance in the R̥gveda (X.178). The final verse (10) returns to the Ādityan emphasis of verse 3 by identifying their mother Aditi with the most important cosmic features, kinship relations, and beings.1. Let auspicious ideas come here to us from all sides—undeceivable, uncircumscribable, bursting out—so that the gods will be (ready) to increase us always, will be our unfaltering protectors every day.2. The auspicious benevolence of the gods is for those who aim straight; let the generosity of the gods roll down toward us.We have reverently approached the fellowship of the gods: let the gods lengthen our lifetime for us to live.3. Them do we call upon with our age-old formal invocation [=nivid]: Bhaga, Mitra, Aditi, Skill unfailing,Aryaman, Varuṇa, Soma, the Aśvins. May well-portioned Sarasvatī create joy for us.4.

With its elementary phraseology and patterned repetitions this hymn is blessedly easy to read but offers little of interest. It falls into three clear parts, which may well have been originally separate (though the hymn does not dis-turb the pattern of hymn arrangement in the Saṃhitā): verses 1–5, 6–8 (these two segments in the same meter), and 9.The first segment begins with the principal Ādityas as our guides (vs. 1) and touches briefly on their general benefits to mortals in the next three verses. The final verse (5) is more specifically focused on the ritual interchange: the hymns we"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"I.91223offer to the gods should produce cows in return. The next segment (vss. 6–8) sim-ply attributes metaphorical “honey” to all natural phenomena, while the last verse (9) expresses the hope that a variety of gods will be luck or welfare for us. This final verse is highly reminiscent of a much longer such litany in VII.35.1. With straight guidance let Varuṇa, let Mitra the knowing guide us;let Aryaman jointly with the gods.2. For they are goods-possessors of goods; unerring, they with their mighty powersguard the commandments everywhere.3. They will extend shelter to us, the immortals to the mortals,thrusting away hatreds.4. Let them clear out paths for us for easy passage—Indra, the Maruts,Pūṣan, Bhaga, (all those) to be extolled.5. And (make) our poetic insights tipped with cows, o Pūṣan and Viṣṇu traveling your ways;make us possessed of well-being.6. Honey do the winds (blow) to the one who follows truth; honey do the rivers stream.Honeyed be the plants for us.7. Honey by night and at dawn; honeyed is the earthly realm.Honey be Father Heaven for us.8. Honeyed be the tree for us, honeyed the sun.Honeyed be the cows for us.9.

Some verse groupings are found together in later liturgical texts (e.g., vss. 16–18, which, though in three dif-ferent meters, agree in contents), but in other cases there is no external evidence. It is possible that the triṣṭubh verses at the beginning (vss. 1–4) and those at the end (vss. 19–23) belong together, with the dimeter verses 5–16 (plus 17–18) having been inserted between them. This is suggested by the fact that verse 19 starts with the same sequence as the beginning of verse 4 (yā́ te dhā́māni), and also by the apparent ring between 1a prá cikitaḥ and 23d prá cikitsā.In any case this hymn shares both the rather simplified rhetoric and the totalizing thematics of Gotama’s hymns to the All Gods. Soma is identified with numerous"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"I.91224gods (see, e.g., vss. 3, 5) and is credited with multiple cosmogonic deeds (e.g., vs. 22) and martial powers (e.g., vs. 21). Especially in the gāyatrī verses he is begged for all sorts of aid and comradeship.Since this is not a Soma Pavamāna hymn and is not found in the IXth Maṇḍala, the ritual details that dominate that maṇḍala are essentially absent here. The exception is the aforementioned triad of verses 16–18, each of which contains a form of ā́ √pyā “swell,” an idiom used of the soaking of the soma stalks in water to make them swell up before their pressing. As this action occurs before the puri-fication process proper, it is hardly mentioned in the IXth Maṇḍala (twice in fact, once [IX.31.4] in an exact repetition of the present vs. 16 in a hymn attributed to our poet Gotama Rāhūgaṇa), while it is the most prominent ritual detail in this hymn.1.

Indeed, the first two segments (vss. 1–4 in jagatī, 5–8 in triṣṭubh) appear to be partial variants of each other, the first describing multiple Dawns (except vs. 4), the second a single Dawn. There are precise agreements in lexicon, phraseology, and imagery, particularly between verses 1–2 and 5–6, that go beyond standard shared Dawn vocabulary. The seductive dancing girl of verse 4 also reminds of the smiling siren of verse 6. The third segment (vss. 9–12) has fewer connections with the first two, but is themati-cally unified, especially by the emphasis on “diminishing/belittling” (all expressed by the root mī in different combinations) in verses 10–12.All three of the segments in trimeter meter (that is, through vs. 12) contain arrest-ing images, and the poet enjoys exploiting ambiguities to poetic effect. In verses 1 and 12, for example, he uses different syntactic constructions in the simile and the frame because the verb held in common by both can be either reflexive or transitive; in verse 3 the pun inherent in the root arc (both “shine” and “chant”) allows the introduction of a simile involving female work-songs, though the dawns themselves are presumably not chanting.The last two segments, in uṣṇih meter, to Dawn and the Aśvins respectively (vss. 13–15, 16–18), are, not surprisingly, less complex. Both hope for the arrival of the divinities at the sacrifice, accompanied by plenty of presents.1. These very Dawns have made themselves a beacon. In the eastern half of the dusky realm they anoint their beam [=sacrificial post].Presenting themselves, as bold ones present arms, the reddish cows, the mothers come toward (us).2.

Despite the variety of meters, the piece is unified by the emphasis on the two gods to whom it is dedicated, and especially by the presence of the dvandva compound agnī́-ṣo﻿́mā “Agni and Soma” in every verse. This compound is found only twice elsewhere in the R̥gveda (both times in Maṇḍala X). Although Agni and Soma are the quintessential ritual divinities, each representing a crucial sacrificial substance, this is the only hymn in the R̥gveda explicitly dedicated to them together, and it is a fairly banal product. However, it is worth noting that, at least in our view, V.44, sometimes called the hardest hymn in the R̥gveda, seems to concern Agni and Soma simultaneously, though it is identified in the Anukramaṇī as an All God hymn.The essential unity of the hymn is also discernible in its fairly simple thematic-cum-syntactic structure, which regularly constructs the verse as a rela-tive clause referring to the actions of a pious mortal (“whoever serves [etc.]. . . ”), and a main clause expressing his reward (see vss. 2–3, 8, 10), as well as in repeated vocabulary in the earlier and later parts (see, e.g., matches between vss. 2 and 8, 3 and 10). The hymn also has an outer ring: the last word (12d śruṣṭimántam “having an attentive hearing”) recalls the first verb of the hymn (1b śr̥ṇutam), the imperative “hear, listen!”One part of the hymn stands out, verses 4–6, which ascribe various mythological deeds to the pair. Curiously, the deeds in verses 4 and 5 are really more appropri-ate to other gods: the mysterious Br̥saya and the theft in verse 4 are found also in a hymn to the river goddess Sarasvatī (VI.61.1, 3), while verse 5 sounds like a generic praise of Indra. In verse 6, however, we do find mythological material appropriate to the two gods addressed, namely the story of the stealing of those gods. This is, tellingly, the only place in the hymn where the two gods are treated separately: Mātariśvan is the figure who stole fire, while the falcon’s theft of soma from heaven is also often alluded to."},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"I.932291.

Though a few (99–100, alternatively 105) have other poets named, the presence of the Kutsa refrain in both 100 and 105 (99 is a one-verse hymn) supports the unity of the collection. The Kutsa refrain, in triṣṭubh, “This let Mitra and Varuṇa grant to us, and Aditi, River, and Earth and Heaven,” occupies the last hemistich of the last verse of every hymn except I.97 (a gāyatrī hymn), 99 (a one-verse hymn), and 104 (though this last hymn is in triṣṭubh).The Agni hymns (94–99) are each dedicated to a different form of Agni. There follow, in the normal order, five hymns to Indra, three to the All Gods, with miscel-laneous other divinities making up the collection. The collection is at a generally high level of poetic craftsmanship, but we will only single out for special mention 104, a challenging Indra hymn, 105, a famous and enigmatic All God hymn, and the lovely Dawn hymn 113.I.94 AgniKutsa Āṅgirasa6 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 15–16The first fourteen verses in this hymn, in jagatī, end with the refrain “while in com-pany with you may we not come to harm.” The first half of the hymn (vss. 1–7) gives little motivation for this repeated, preventative hope: the subject is primarily the sacrifice and the mutually beneficial relationship between Agni and the sacrificers. But in verses 8 and 9 evil rivals of the sacrificer appear, and Agni’s aid against them is requested. The next two verses (10–11) sketch the dangers posed by Agni himself as the uncontrolled forest fire, and verse 12 calls for Agni’s help against the most potent menace of all, the anger of the gods. The remaining verses (13–16) return to the reassuring realm of properly performed sacrifice, with Agni providing benefits and protection to the ritualist.1. For Jātavedas, who deserves this praise, we would bring it into being like a chariot, with our inspired thought,for his solicitude for us in the assembly is beneficial. – O Agni, while in company with you may we not come to harm.2.

The dedicand of the hymn, Agni, does not appear by name until verse 9, and there are only two occurrences of the name, both vocatives, in the whole hymn (the second being in the final, summary verse 11). The address to Agni in verse 9 also breaks the uninterrupted 3rd-person description that holds sway in the hymn up to that point. In what precedes, Agni’s characteristics, the ritual service given to him, and the entities that render that service are referred to in oblique fashion.The Anukramaṇī suggests that it is Agni “at dawn” who is the subject of the hymn, and indeed the hymn is specifically concerned with the birth, that is, the kindling, of the ritual fire at daybreak. The birth imagery dominates the first verses, with Night and Dawn suckling Agni as their calf (vs. 1) and the fingers of the offici-ants begetting him (vs. 2). Three births of Agni are mentioned in verse 3; though there is some disagreement about whether the three entities mentioned in pāda b are the sites of the three births, in our opinion only two sites are found there (the sea and the heavenly waters), and the third birth is the ritual birth that occupied the first two verses. Again in our opinion, the second half of verse 3 concerns the removal of the oblation fire (the fire later called the Āhavanīya) to the east.The remaining verses of the hymn describe the growing strength of the newly born fire, first barely visible in the kindling sticks (vs. 4), but with flames rising higher and higher (see esp. vss. 7–8) as he also spreads across the ground (vss. 8–9). The expected requests for aid and gifts are rather muted and perfunctory (vss. 9cd and 11b); the focus is on the riddling descriptions."},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"I.95233The hymn displays some omphalos characteristics: the middle verses (5–6) show responsion, and there is a wisp of a ring in the lexical repetitions between verses 2 and 9.

In just this way, o Agni, as you grow strong though the kindling wood, shine out richly for fame, o pure one.– This let Mitra and Varuṇa grant to us, and Aditi, River, and Earth and Heaven.I.96 Agni (or Agni Draviṇodā “Agni Wealth-Giver”)Kutsa Āṅgirasa9 verses: triṣṭubhSimpler and more straightforward than the previous hymn, this one shares a final verse (9) as well as some themes with I.95: see especially verse 5, where Night and Dawn suckle Agni, the calf, which matches I.95.1, where the two mothers were unidentified.A pāda-length refrain is found in the first seven verses; in the last two of these (vss. 6–7) the refrain is integrated syntactically into the verse: pāda c with pāda d in 6, the whole verse in 7, while in the first five verses the refrain is independent. Agni has the epithet “wealth-giver” in this refrain, and in the eighth verse (post-refrain) that epithet, repeated four times, is the focus. This verse expresses the poet’s desire for the various types of Agni’s “wealth,” a typical finale. In the earlier parts of the hymn (vss. 1–5), however, it is not Agni’s material gifts that are dominant, but his ritual and cosmogonic properties, though his relation to wealth surfaces in verses 6–7 (see also 4a). This gradual integration of the refrain into the fabric of the hymn, both syn-tactically and thematically, shows how a skillful poet can deploy even something as apparently inert as an invariant refrain in building a forward-moving composition.1. Being born with strength as of old, at once he has acquired all poetic powers—yes indeed!Both the waters and the holy place [=earth] make the ally [=Agni] succeed. – The gods uphold Agni, the wealth-giver.2. With the age-old formal invocation [=nivid] and the poetic power of Āyu he begot these offspring of Manu’s people;with Vivasvant [=Sun] as his eye (he begot) heaven and the waters. – The gods uphold Agni, the wealth-giver.3. The Ārya clans solemnly invoke him as the foremost one, bringing the sacrifice to success when bepoured, aiming straight,the son of nourishment, the Bharata, possessing buttery drops. – The gods uphold Agni, the wealth-giver.4.

But here the independence is more jarring because the refrain is just a participial phrase, not a self-contained clause. The rest of this brief hymn consists of snatches of expressed hopes for the well-being of the sacrificers and the patrons and for Agni’s aid in overcoming hostilities. The Sanskrit contains a pleasing counterpoint of preverbs, which cannot be easily rendered in English.1. Blazing away the bad for us, blaze wealth here, o Agni,—blazing away the bad for us.2. With a desire for good lands, for easy passage, and for goods we offer sacrifice,—(you) blazing away the bad for us—3.

Verse 2 seems to refer to the myth of the Agni’s disappearance.1. Might we be in the favor of Vaiśvānara, for he is the king and full glory of the creatures.Born from here, he surveys this whole (world). Vaiśvānara aligns himself with the sun.2. Sought in heaven and sought on earth, being sought, Agni entered all the plants.Sought forcefully, let Agni Vaiśvānara protect us from harm by day and by night.3. Vaiśvānara, let this come true of you: let riches and generous patrons accompany us.– This let Mitra and Varuṇa grant to us, and Aditi, River, and Earth and Heaven.I.99 Agni JātavedasKaśyapa Mārīca1 verse: triṣṭubhThis one-verse hymn is the shortest of the R̥gveda. Embedded in the Kutsa hymns and placed at the end of his Agni cycle (I.94–98), it is the only hymn attributed to Kaśyapa Mārīca in Maṇḍala I, though a number of hymns and verses in hymns"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"I.100237are ascribed to him elsewhere, especially in Maṇḍala IX. Its message is simple and straightforward. The imagery of the boat and the river matches that in I.97.7–8. Both because of this agreement and because the first of Kutsa’s Agni hymns begins with a praise of Jātavedas, also in the dative case (I.94.1a), this hymn seems well integrated in the Kutsa cycle.1. For Jātavedas we will press soma. He will burn down the property of the hostile.He will carry us across all difficult passages, across difficult transits, as if with a boat across a river—Agni.I.100 IndraFive Vārṣāgira poets: R̥jrā śva, Ambarīṣa, Sahadeva, Bhayamāna, and Surādhas19 verses: triṣṭubhThis first Indra hymn in the Kutsa collection is assigned by the Anukramaṇī to five named poets with the patronymic Vārṣāgira, only one of whom (Ambarīṣa, of IX.98) is known from elsewhere. However, the hymn ends with the Kutsa refrain (vs. 19cd), and the Vārṣāgira attribution must come from the dānastuti, where the names of these five poets are mentioned (vs. 17, see also 16).The first fifteen verses (up to the dānastuti, vss. 16–19) end with a refrain linking Indra to the Maruts, and one of the main themes of the hymn is com-radeship: Indra joined not only with the Maruts but with other like-minded beings (see, e.g., vss. 4–5, 10–11). The context is almost exclusively martial, as Indra joins with his forces and his powers to conquer various foes, though his standard opponents, like Vr̥tra, are curiously absent. The insistent pres-ence of the Maruts may mark this as a hymn for the Midday Pressing, where Indra and Maruts share the oblation. The next hymn also has a strong Marut presence.The dānastuti finale begins (vs. 16) with the praise of the gift, a fine mare, but, after naming the Vārṣāgiras (vs. 17), ends with straightforward praise of Indra.Verbally the hymn is structured by the frequent hemistich-initial occurrences of the pronoun sá “he,” reinforced by plays on this syllable: for instance, verse 1c satīnásatvā, 18cd sánat. There are also a number of hapaxes, whose translations are provisional (see vss. 8, 12, 16).1.

Though the hymn falls into two unequal metrical segments, there is no reason not to consider it a unity: the two segments complement each other, structurally and thematically. (One might fancifully com-pare it to the 8 / 6 structure of a Petrarchan sonnet.)The jagatī section (vss. 1–7) is characterized most obviously by its refrain, occu-pying all of the fourth pāda of each verse. Interestingly this refrain lacks the name"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"I.101240Indra, though this name appears in first or (modified) second position in each of the third pādas, save for verse 1. Instead it is his connection with the Maruts that is foregrounded in the refrain, using the same stem, though in a different case, that appeared in the refrain of I.100. Verses 1 and 7 also deviate from the signa-ture stylistic feature of the middle verses (2–6), that the first three-fourths of these verses are all relative clauses: a form of the relative pronoun begins each verse, and each of the two subsequent pādas in each verse contains (and often begins) with at least one. (Note the explosion of relative pronouns in the final verse 6: five in three pādas.) This arrangement, with most of the verse devoted to relative clauses but ending with a main clause refrain, reminds us of the famous Indra hymn II.12, with its identificatory refrain “He, o peoples, is Indra!” But this one is more com-plex, in that Indra is not identified directly in the refrain. The jagatī section is also demarcated by a faint ring, the verb “address” (prá. . . arcatā 1a, abhy àrcati 7c), and by the fact that Indra is referred to only in the 3rd person in a series of definitional descriptions in the indicative.By contrast, the triṣṭubh verses (8–11) switch to direct address to Indra (save for the final, summary verse with the Kutsa refrain) and to urgent invitations to him to come to our sacrifice. The Marut theme is continued, however—already in the first pāda of the first triṣṭubh verse (8a) with a vocative of the same stem (marútvant “accompanied by the Maruts”) that dominated the jagatī refrain. (See also 9c, 11a.) A faint ring also defines the triṣṭubh verses, with vr̥jána “(ritual) circle” in both 8b and 11a.As for content, it is largely familiar, praising Indra for his victories over various enemies, for his aid to mortals hard pressed in battle, and for his steadfast lordship. Needless to say, the Marut element is quite strong, as in the preceding hymn (I.110). The most striking formulation may be found in the first verse, with its image of Indra causing the fortresses of the enemy to abort their fetuses.1. Address a nourishing speech to the exultant one, who, along with R̥jiśvan, aborted the (strongholds) with their black embryos.Seeking help from the bull with the mace in his right hand, the one accompanied by the Maruts do we call for partnership.2. Who with his bristling battle-fury smote the one with its shoulders apart [=Vr̥tra =cobra], who smote Śambara, who smote Pipru who followed no commandment,Indra, who wrenched down insatiable Śuṣṇa—the one accompanied by the Maruts do we call upon for partnership.3.

But the tight syntactic and formulaic control of I.101 is not present here. Nonetheless, the"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"I.102242hymn is stitched together by lexical repetitions, and the two metrically diverse seg-ments show especially strong lexical responsions.The hymn begins with a difficult verse, which has received a number of incom-patible interpretations. Ours is, perhaps, especially bold, in that we assume that the poet (in the 1st person) is speaking to a “you” who is not the god (as most people assume), but the human praise singer, who may, in fact, be the poet him-self. (Such incompatibilities in address are not infrequent in such ritual situ-ations; the poet often addresses himself in the 2nd person; see discussion in Jamison 2009a.) The poet thus announces that the composition of his poem is complete and it is ready to be recited to its object, the god, who is present in the verse in the 3rd person.After naming the cosmic forces whose activities provide support to Indra (vs. 2), the poet turns to two intertwined themes: the aid we beg from Indra in conflicts and contests, where, we know, our rivals and foes will be seeking the same aid (esp. vss. 3–6, 9–10), and the immeasurable power Indra commands, power that accounts for the desire of all contenders to get him on their side (esp. vss. 6–8). These latter verses play with forms of the root mā “measure, match.” The transi-tion between the jagatī and triṣṭubh sections is especially nicely handled: having claimed in verses 6–7 that Indra has no match in strength, verse 8 takes up the exact phrase from verse 6, but asserts that indeed there does exist such a match—but it consists of the whole cosmos in all its divisions. The next verse (9) of the triṣṭubh section densely repeats and rings changes on the lexicon and thematics from the early parts of the hymn and thus signals a kind of ring composition. Verse 10 seems to announce the success of our petitions, though in a different lexicon. The final verse (11) is a refrain verse, repeated from I.100.19, the last half of which is the general Kutsa refrain.1. I present this great visionary thought to you, the praiser of this great one, when the Holy Place [=the earth] has been anointed for you.The one victorious in his upsurging and his outsurging, Indra with his vast power did the gods cheer on.2. His fame do the seven rivers bear; Heaven and Earth, the Broad One, (bear) his wondrous form, lovely to see.For us to look upon (it), to put our trust in (him), the Sun and Moon roam, traversing in regular alternation, o Indra.3. Help this chariot forward to win, o bounteous one, which we will cheer on as victorious for you in the clash,and help us in the contest with your mind, much-praised Indra. Extend shelter to us who seek you, bounteous one.4. Might we conquer their defense with you as yokemate. For us uphold our stake in every raid;for us, Indra, create wide space and easy passage.

We can assume that the earthbound power has to do with the aid he provides to mortals in battle, while his heavenly power is displayed by his cosmogonic deeds. The poet claims the two types of power are mixed together equally and the result serves as a sort of beacon, an odd image—but the underlying notion must be that of the light (of Dawn, of Agni) that connects heaven and earth, frequently referred to as a beacon. Similarly Indra’s twin powers link the heavenly and earthly realms and are conspicuous in both."},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"I.103244Both types of power are treated in the hymn, which has an omphalos struc-ture. The cosmogonic deeds are found in the outer frame, verses 2 and 7 (and 8ab), particularly the slaying of Vr̥tra. The inner verses (3–6) concern Indra’s involvement with us, the Āryas, as we confront our traditional foes, the Dāsas and the Dasyus, who do not share in the values of the Ārya community. The omphalos itself consists of verse 4, where Indra acquires several names mark-ing his successful progress. The following verse (5) presents itself as a sort of epiphany: the people are exhorted to behold the results of Indra’s actions and therefore believe in his existence. The omphalos structure is marked not only thematically but verbally. Note the two occurrences of śrád-dhā “trust” in the inner ring of verses 3 and 5.The responsion in the outer ring (specifically vss. 2 and 7) is more complex and more interesting. Verse 2c begins with the signature formula of the Vr̥tra saga: áhann áhim “he slew the serpent,” and 7b ends with the word áhim “serpent.” The phrase in verse 2 lacks the frequent accompaniment, the weapon (vájra) in the instrumental “with his mace,” while 7b has vájreṇa. But on the surface the action in that verse is entirely different: “he woke the sleeping serpent with his mace.” As argued elsewhere (Jamison 1982/83 and 2007: 110–12), this is a formal “pun,” which means exactly the opposite of its surface sense. Indra did not nudge the snake with his weapon to wake him up to fight. Instead the poet combines the formal causative shape of the verb “awaken” (lit., “cause to awaken”) with the semantics of its object “sleeping (serpent),” to produce an underlying form “cause (the serpent) to sleep.” In Vedic, as in English, “cause to sleep / put to sleep” is a euphemism for “kill,” and “waken the sleeping serpent with the mace” is simply a particularly clever way to say “slew the serpent.” Since this phrase is anticipated by the standard áhann áhim expression, which is in the structurally responsive position in the ring, an alert audience would have no trouble catching this deep-structure pun.1. This highest Indrian power of yours did the sage poets hold fast earlier, (the one) far away and this one here—this one here on the earth and the other one of his in heaven.

He held the earth fast and spread it out; having smashed with his mace, he sent forth the waters:He smashed the serpent; he split apart Rauhiṇa; he smashed the cobra—the bounteous one with his powers.3.

On this basis Oldenberg identified it as an Anhangslied (a supplementary hymn appended to the end of a divinity cycle), an opinion sup-ported by the fact that, alone of the Kutsa hymns (I.94–98, 100–115), it lacks the Kutsa refrain always found in the last hemistich of the last verse of each hymn. (This applies only to trimeter hymns; the gāyatrī hymn I.97, not surprisingly, also lacks it.) But if “supplementary” suggests something attenuated or in decline, that suggestion is emphatically false. This hymn is extraordinary complex and challeng-ing, especially in its mythological portion (vss. 3–5), and we are far from solving the many puzzles it presents. It may have been inserted just here in the Saṃhitā because the mythological portion in part concerns a foe named Kuyava, or the demon “of bad grain,” that is, bad harvest, mentioned as having been slain by Indra in the last verse of the preceding hymn (I.103.8ab). There are also several other lexical connec-tions between I.103 and this hymn, particularly the two forms of śrád-dhā “trust” in each hymn, which may have encouraged the insertion, or even the composition, of this supplementary poem.As in many hymns, an invitation to Indra to come to the sacrifice is found in the first verse. But some of the features of this verse give us a taste of what is to"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"I.104246come. For example, the apparently straightforward simile in pāda b, rendered here as “like a steed sounding off,” is actually a triple pun (impossible to convey in translation): the participle suvāna﻿́ḥ can belong to three different verbs: “sound,” “impel,” and “press (of soma).” When Indra takes his seat on the ritual ground, he is compared to a horse neighing, to a horse that has been driven to the place where it takes its rest, and finally to soma (which itself is often compared to a horse) being pressed in its womb. In fact the same phraseology is applied to soma elsewhere (cf. IX.70.7).The second verse introduces the theme that will dominate the mythological por-tion, the importance of having Indra and the other gods on our side in the battle against the traditional, perhaps indigenous, enemies of the Ārya, identified as Dāsa (vs. 2) and Dasyu (vs. 5). The word “color” in the final pāda of the verse is a fre-quent way of referring to a cohort, a unified group of people. Our urgent need for Indra and his aid returns after the mythological portion, in fact starting with the second half of verse 5. The poet twice asserts his trust in Indra’s power (6d, 7a); this may not be a mere repetition but refer rather to the two aspects of Indra’s power, as described in the first verse of the preceding hymn (I.103.1), partly in heaven and partly on earth. And he also issues a series of peremptory commands, especially negative commands, to Indra from verse 5ab through verse 8, which ends with a plea not to split our “eggs” or our “cups,” in our opinion male and female genitalia respectively. The final verse (9) is again a simple invitation to soma.The problematic verses 3–5ab need to be interpreted within this outer frame-work, the context of Indra’s martial aid to the embattled Ārya. Our interpretation of these verses is quite speculative and differs from those of others, but we have attempted to construct a coherent account, while supplying as little extraneous material as possible. What is immediately striking about the first of these verses (3) is the presence of two female figures, the “two maidens of Kuyava,” who are obviously rivers. More rivers appear in the second half of the next verse (4cd). Now the advance of the Ārya is often obstructed by rivers, which must be forded (see esp. III.33), and important battles are fought beside these barrier rivers (see esp. VII.18). The two maidens of Kuyava thus could be rivers initially controlled by forces impeding the progress of the Ārya. The charming image of the foamy riv-ers “bathing in milk” turns swiftly cruel: “may they both be smashed,” perhaps a reference to their violent confluence with a mightier river still, the Śiphā (otherwise unknown). This verse reminds us of V.30.9, in another Indra hymn, in which Indra confronts an enemy who “made women his weapons” and who has two streams, perhaps the same rivers as here. Once Indra recognizes the situation, he initiates battle.V.30.9 Because the Dāsa made women his weapons, what can they do to me? His armies lack strength.Since he [=Indra] distinguished both his [=Dāsa’s?] streams, therefore Indra advanced on the Dasyu to fight."},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"I.104247The point may be that though rivers are formidable natural obstructions, they are also, by grammatical gender, feminine, and females are, by nature, weak. Conceiving of rivers as women robs them of their power and allows them to be overcome. The analogue of Indra’s distinguishing the streams in V.30.9 may be found in our verse 5ab, where the “guide” of the Dasyu, which we interpret both physically as the streambed and metaphorically as his strategy, is revealed. It is another female who reveals and recognizes it, and, on the basis of shared lexicon, we think that Dawn is the figure lurking behind this unidentified feminine. Dawn regularly makes things visible and knows the way forward, and here she leads the Aryan forces to the very seat of the enemy.These Ārya forces are personified in Āyu in verse 4ab. His “navel” has been effaced for two reasons. On the one hand, the mythic hero Āyu is the son of the Apsaras Urvaśī and the mortal king Purūravas, but his lot was cast with mortals when his mother abandoned him (see X.95), and in this sense his true origins have been, at the least, muddied. But there is a more positive aspect to this phrase; since he and the other Ārya continue to move forward into ever new territory, where they came from recedes into the background: their future is forward.What remains to be explained is the emphasis on the rivers’ “carrying away” (áva-√bhr̥ 3a, 3b; √bhr̥ 4b). Here we feel there may be a latent ritual reference. The “final bath” (avabhr̥thá, a derivative of áva-√bhr̥) of the sacrificer and his wife at the end of the classical śrauta ritual is purificatory, removing all ritual pollution. And it is a commonplace in Vedic that rivers and moving waters in general carry away stain. The mention of bathing in 3c, combined with the emphasis on “carry-ing away,” suggests that a notion of expiation and ritual cleansing has been super-imposed on this battle scene. What is not clear is what is being carried away. Is it pollution produced by some offense of the enemy? An even more speculative idea is inspired by the mention of “foam” (phénam 3b): in a well-known myth Indra cuts off the head of the demon Namuci with the foam of waters (see VIII.14.13), having tricked him by forswearing all conventional weapons. It is possible that the rivers here are carrying away the defilement that Indra acquired from this underhanded killing. It is worthy of note that the Namuci myth is treated in V.30.7–8, right before the verse cited above about enemy streams.The last word has not been said about this dense and fascinating hymn, but we hope to have advanced the discussion.1. A womb has been prepared for you to sit down in, Indra. Sit down in it here, like a steed sounding off,once you have released your vitality [/the birds] and unhitched the horses, who convey you so well to the mealtime, evening and morning.2.

The range and incompatibility of these hypotheses testify to the interpretive challenges of"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"I.105249the poem. Nonetheless, guided by the structure, we feel that we have arrived at an internally consistent and satisfying interpretation. (See also discussion in Jamison 2007: 82–85).It is an omphalos hymn. It has nineteen verses, but the last verse is in a different meter from the rest and does not end with the refrain found in the other eighteen verses (but rather with the standard Kutsa refrain), so we can legitimately consider it extra-hymnic for structural purposes. The exact center of the hymn is then verses 9 and 10. As in a number of other omphalos hymns, they are responsive, beginning identically, with amī́ yé numeral (“those which. . . ”). Their content is, it seems, mystical—at any rate, it has provoked much scholarly discussion. Also as in other omphalos hymns a set of concentric verses surround this central pair. But its struc-ture is even more intricate than most other omphalos hymns, in that there is also a certain forward progress in the hymn, held in tension with the architectonic sym-metry of the omphalos structure.The subject of the hymn is the poet’s doubts and anxieties about the efficacy of the sacrifice and, in particular, of his own ritual speech and thus about the relation-ship between the earthly and heavenly realms, if that relationship exists at all. It is this central doubt that prompts the refrain “Take heed of this (speech) of mine, you two world-halves.” The poet wishes both Heaven and Earth to listen to and bear witness to what he says and thereby prove that there is a relationship between them, a relationship established and maintained by the sacrifice.The poet begins with a happy picture of cosmic (vs. 1) and earthly (vs. 2) order, but he quickly turns to his fear about the maintenance of this order (vs. 3). He fol-lows with a series of baffled questions to the gods, introduced by pr̥chāmi “I ask.” He first questions Agni, the divinity nearest to him, about the fate of his previous poems (his “truth”), and then turns to the gods in heaven to ask what happens in heaven to the sacrifice and the poetic formulations of mortals (vss. 5–6). These questions express almost a loss of faith in the efficacy of these mortal techniques to make contact with the gods. His anguish grows stronger in verses 7–8, where his painful thoughts are memorably compared to wolves, to cowives, and to mice gnaw-ing their own tails.There follows the pair of verses (9–10) we have just identified as the omphalos, which seem to constitute the oblique response to the poet’s cry for reassurance—a cosmic vision in which the poet’s connection and kinship with the distant heaven is manifest, and is attested to by what may be his forefather, the seer Trita Āptya. The precise nature of this vision is not clear to us, but it seems to involve celestial bod-ies and celestial movement. After this central mystery, the rest of the hymn seems designed to calm the worries expressed by the poet, in the reverse order of his first expression, by asserting divine participation in the mortal’s ritual acts. In verse 11 a cosmic wolf is kept at bay, similar to the earthly, metaphorical one that pursued the poet in verse 7. In the following verses effective words are established anew (12); Agni takes charge of the sacrifice (13–14); Varuṇa produces poetic formulations (15); and the path to heaven and the relations between god and men are made safe (16–17)."},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"I.105250Thus I.105 has two structures held in tension—one is the symmetrical architec-tural one of concentric rings of verses around a central pair, and the other is the forward movement of question and answer, worry expressed and reassurance given. The two structures can be diagrammed as follows:Structure of I.105 (a): architectural:1–2 cosmic and earthly order3 fears about maintaining order5–6 questions about fate of ritual offerings7–8 more anguish; thoughts compared to wolves, cowives, mice9–10 Omphalos: cosmic vision11 wolf kept at bay12 effective words reestablished13–15 gods take charge of sacrifice16–17 order restored[18: structure destabilized? (see below)]Structure of I.105 (b): forward movement:1–8 poet’s questions and worries11–17 (gods’) answers and reassurancesThe intricacy of the responsive patterns and the tension between the two struc-tures compel our attention and provide us with aesthetic satisfaction, even though we find ourselves puzzled by much of the actual content of the hymn. But there is a final sly trick that complicates the hymn even more. In the last verse (before the extra-hymnic one), the wolf returns—the wolf that tracked the poet in verse 7, but whose threat was curbed by divine power in verse 11. But it seems that that check was only temporary; the wolf comes back, enigmatically but with a lurking men-ace, in verse 18. Have the poet’s fears been calmed after all? Has he really regained his faith in the efficacy of his own poetry and of the sacrifice they serve? Or will the wolf prey upon him again? The hymn leaves these questions open and in this way subtly and uninsistently undermines the reassuring structure of the poem and destabilizes its architecture. It is a masterful stroke.1.

It is a hymn of the most straightforward All God type. The most notable feature of the hymn is verse 6, which closely parallels verse 17 of I.105. Here the poet Kutsa is “squeezed down into a pit” and appeals to the gods for help. There Trita is found in a similar situ-ation and makes the same appeal. The verse conforms better to its context in this hymn than in I.105: in I.106 the refrain filling half of each verse calls on the gods to “rescue us from narrow straits,” as exemplified by Kutsa’s confinement, whereas in I.105 the poet is tormented by spiritual doubts that only in that one particular"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"I.107253verse are conceived of as physical confinement.

This hymn is structured by patterned repetition that becomes decidedly more restrictive in the second half of the hymn. The vocative of the dual dvandva “o Indra and Agni” occurs in every verse but the middle one (vs. 6). In the first five verses this vocative moves around the verse (though it always occurs in second position in its pāda), but in the second half (vss. 7–13) it always occurs in second position of the first pāda, after the subordinator yád “when” (except in the final verse [13], where it appears after evā́ in the same position). The second half of these same verses (7–12) is a refrain, which has slowly been assembled in the earlier part of the hymn: its sec-ond half is also found in 1d and 6d, and in part in 5d; the end of its first half first appears in 6c. These elements all come together first in 7cd. And the first halves of these same verses are thematically superimposable: in each verse several different potential locations of the gods are listed, which they are urged to leave in order to come to us.The contents of the first six verses are more various. The united front and the joint activities of Indra and Agni are emphasized, though some verses have a dis-tinctly Indraic character (esp. vs. 3, where both gods are called “Vṛtra-smashers”) and some are more in Agni’s camp (esp. vs. 4). The middle verse (6) is, as noted above, the only verse without an address to the gods (or any mention of them by name), and it also contains 1st-person direct speech. In it the speaker recalls his words when he “chose” the gods, presumably as his priests, and these words announce the necessity for competing with others (in this case the other human “lords” [not, in our opinion, the nonhuman Asuras, the later Vedic opponents of the gods]) for the gods’ visitation, the theme that will dominate the rest of the hymn. Though we hesitate to call verse 6 an omphalos, it does serve as pivot point for the"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"I.108255hymn, and its deliberately different structure from both what precedes and what follows marks it and its position as exceptional.1.

This voice announces in the first two verses that he seeks a better state and must turn to Indra and Agni for help because his kin-group is unreliable. This is expressed in general terms in the first verse, but in bitter particulars in the second. Interestingly the deficient rela-tives in that verse are both connections through the female line: his daughter’s hus-band and his wife’s brother (the word syālá is specialized for this relationship). In a patrilocal system like that of ancient India, neither of them would have particularly close ties to him.The theme of kinship is continued in verse 3, where the forefathers, a more satisfactory set of relatives, provide the model for the performance of a soma sacrifice for Indra and Agni, the success of which seems to have been in doubt (see 3a). This soma sacrifice continues in verse 4, where the Aśvins, somewhat surprisingly, participate in its performance. Perhaps the idea is that even other gods, the Aśvins and the goddess Holy Place, do ritual service to the great Indra and Agni.The subject gradually shifts to praise of the two gods’ powers (vss. 5–6) and requests for their aid (vss. 7–8). In verse 7 the forefathers return, and the poet, rather indirectly, compares the sacrificial compact the gods had with these ances-tors with the one he hopes he has established now.1. Because, seeking a better state, I have surveyed with my mind my kith and kin, o Indra and Agni,there exists for me no other (fatherly) solicitude than you two. So I have fashioned for you a thought that seeks the prize.2.

This hymn begins in the ritual here-and-now, where the R̥bhus, already immortal, are offered their share of the sacrifice by the poet-sacri-ficer, who speaks in the 1st person. The story of their achievement is then begun in verse 2, with the R̥bhus depicted as itinerant skilled workers, rather like the poet and his comrades (thus perhaps holding out the hope that immortality will come to them as well). The particular feats they accomplished are then recounted, with special emphasis on their turning Tvaṣṭar’s single cup into four (vss. 3, 5), the oth-ers hurriedly covered in verse 8, interspersed with pleas for their favor.1.

They fashioned the smooth-rolling chariot, working with their know-how; they fashioned the two fallow bays that convey Indra and bring bullish goods.They fashioned—the R̥bhus—for their parents youthful vigor; they fashioned for the calf a mother to stay by it.2.

A pāda-length refrain ends every verse but the last two (24–25), urging the Aśvins to come with the same forms of help they have used in past rescues and marvelous deeds. The first three quarters of each verse provides examples of said deeds; as often in Aśvin hymns, many of these involve little-known or unknown episodes and proper names of otherwise unidentified clients of the Aśvins, inter-mixed with allusions to myths and legends found at least glancingly elsewhere. This fast-moving catalogue occupies most of the hymn (starting especially with vs. 5, through vs. 23), and its effect is to convince the audience that, with so many helpful interventions behind them, the Aśvins will surely answer our calls for help, as finally articulated in vss. 24–25."},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"I.112260The beginning of the hymn (vss. 1–4), while the rhetorical pattern is still being estab-lished, is more difficult and more syntactically and conceptually dense. The climax of this portion of the hymn is verse 4, where the rhetorical pattern gets its full shape but the content has not yet settled into the litany that follows. The pervasive double mean-ing of verse 4 cannot be conveyed directly in translation, for each part of the verse, on the one hand, identifies an unnamed divinity associated with the early-morning sacri-fice (Wind [Vāyu], Agni, and Soma) by characteristic epithets, while, on the other, all three descriptions are also appropriate to the Aśvins’ chariot (already mentioned in vs. 2), on which they will make the journey constantly alluded to in the refrain.1.

It consists of separate groups of thematically unified verses without seeming dis-jointed, because there is an overall theme: unity amid diversity.In the first three verses Dawn is contrasted with her opposite number, her sister Night, but they are eternally conjoined and regularly alternating according to the divine plan. Verses 4–6, marked off by a pāda-length refrain, present the diversity of the animate world. Dawn wakes all creatures, and they all have different goals to pursue in their waking lives, while all being subject to Dawn. Verse 7 provides both summary and transition; it almost sounds like a hymn-final verse."},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"I.113263The substantial middle section of the hymn (vss. 8–15) sees a different kind of unity in diversity, in what is perhaps the most challenging conceptual question about dawn. Every day has a dawn and every day’s dawn is, in some sense, the same, while being quite distinct. Today’s dawn has been preceded by countless many and will be followed by countless many; she is both last and first. But she is also the capitalized and personified single Dawn. This conceptual puzzle is presented in verse 8 (especially the first half), and the gist and lexicon of 8ab are repeated in the final verse of this section, 15cd, forming a ring around the section. The most dif-ficult verse in the hymn, verse 10, also treats this same problem, and the next verse (11) draws the melancholy conclusion: just as there were earlier dawns, now gone, so were there earlier mortals who saw those dawns—and others will follow and replace us, to see the dawns to come. Verse 13 provides indirect solace, by reframing the many dawns as one Dawn, who dawned before, dawns now, and will continue to dawn. (The other verses in this section, 9, 12, and 14, simply concern the current Dawn, in fairly standard terms.)The final section (vss. 16–20) begins (vs. 16) with a triumphal exhortation, which indirectly counters the consciousness of inevitable death attending on time stated in verse 11 with the announcement that life is lengthened by the advent of dawn. The following verses treat the early-morning ritual: the response of the sacrificial fire (vs. 17), the offering to Vāyu (vs. 18), the recitation and singing of praise (vss. 17–18), and, of course, the gifts that are distributed at the dawn sacrifice by Dawn herself (vss. 17–20).1. This fairest light of lights has come here. The bright sign, wide-reaching, has been born.Just as she [=Dawn] is impelled forth for the impulsion of Savitar, so Night has left behind the womb for Dawn.2. Having a gleaming calf, herself gleaming white, she has come here. The black one [=Night] has left behind her seats for her.Having the same (kin-)bonds, immortal, following one upon the other, the two, Day (and Night), keep exchanging their color.3. The road is the same for the two sisters—unending. They proceed on it, one after the other, commanded by the gods.They do not oppose each other, nor do they stand still, though well grounded—Night and Dawn, of like mind but different form.4. Light-filled leader of liberalities, the bright one has appeared. She has opened out the doors for us.Having stirred forth the moving world, she has looked out for riches for us. – Dawn has awakened all the creatures.5. The bounteous one (has awakened them), for (even) one who lies crossways to move, for (another) one to seek wealth to his use,for (even) those who see (only) a little to gaze out widely. – Dawn has awakened all the creatures."},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"I.1132646.

The helpful and healing aspects of Rudra are emphasized—the related words sumatí “benevolence” and sumná “favor” occur six times in this eleven-verse hymn. His fearsome and angry side is for the most part downplayed, mentioned in passing in verses 4c and 10a, both beginning “in the distance.” But Rudra’s possible punitive actions are addressed directly in verses 7–8, which contain twelve occurrences of the prohibitive negative mā́ “don’t!”1. These poetic thoughts do we proffer to Rudra, the powerful one with braided hair who rules over heroes,so that he will be luck for our two-footed and four-footed, so that everything in this settlement will be flourishing, free of affliction.2. Be merciful to us, Rudra, and create joy for us. To you who rule over heroes we would do honor with reverence.Whatever luck and lifetime Father Manu won through sacrifice, that may we attain under your guidance, Rudra.3. May we attain your benevolence though sacrifice to the gods, the benevolence of you who rule over heroes, o reward-granting Rudra.Bestowing only favor, come roaming toward our clans: possessing heroes who cannot be harmed, we will pour you an oblation."},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"I.1152664.

His function as eye of the gods, especially Mitra and Varuṇa, is mentioned in verse 1 (and in our opinion also in verse 5), and the activity that his rising inspires, both ritual and mundane, in verse 3. Verses 4 and 5 are more"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"I.115267enigmatic and have occasioned much discussion: many scholars believe that both verses contrast the sun of the day with the “night sun,” the dark side of the sun that, in the form of a wheel, travels invisibly from west to east to position itself for the next daily rising. Thus, in such interpretations, in the first half of verse 4 Night gathers up the dark garment she was weaving (see II.38.4) at the advent of the rising sun, but swathes the night sun in her garment in the second half of the verse. Two sides of the sun, bright and dark, are also referred to, more clearly, in the second half of verse 5. Although these interpretations have much in their favor, we still remain uncertain about what verses 4 and 5 are actually depicting. On the one hand, the interpretations offered seem too cut-and-dried for the fluid cosmology of the R̥gveda; on the other, given the usual concentration on the happy event of sunrise, too much mention of the less auspicious night sun seems somewhat out of place.1. The brilliant face of the gods has arisen, the eye of Mitra, Varuṇa, and Agni;he has filled heaven, earth, and the space between: the Sun is the life-breath of both the moving and the still.2. The Sun approaches the gleaming goddess Dawn from behind, like a dashing youth a maiden,when the men seeking the gods stretch their yokes across, in response to the auspicious (god) for the sake of an auspicious (thing).3. The auspicious tawny horses of the Sun—the brilliant ones, worth cheering on, that win dappled cows—bringing reverence, they have mounted the back of heaven. They circle around heaven and earth in a single day.4. This is the Sun’s divinity, this his greatness: in the middle of (her) work (Night?) has gathered together what was stretched out.When he has yoked his tawny horses from their seat, just after that Night stretches her garment for him.5. The Sun takes on his own form in the lap of heaven, for Mitra and Varuṇa to see.His one surface, gleaming, is unbounded; the tawny (horses) together bring the other, the black one.6. Today, o gods, at the rising of the Sun, deliver us from distress and from disgrace.– This let Mitra and Varuıa grant to us, and Aditi, River, and Earth and Heaven.Kakṣīvant Dairghatamasa, the son of Dīrghatamas (poet of I.140–164), is the poet of the next eleven hymns (116–126). As Geldner points out, however, Kakṣīvant refers to himself as pajriyá (I.116.7, 117.6, 120.5) and to his family as the pajrā́ḥ (I.122.8, 126. 4, 5). According to I.121.13 the Pajras are Aṅgirases. Kakṣīvant also"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"I.116268calls himself the son of Uśij in I.119.9 and 122.4; Sāyaṇa identifies Uśij as a dāsī, a servant woman.Whatever his family affiliations Kakṣīvant has one of the most distinctive poetic personalities in the R̥gveda. He is a very skillful, self-conscious, and tricky artist, setting traps for his unwary hearers and twisting words and phrases into often impenetrable knots, with an exuberance that we have to admire despite our fre-quent frustrations. He also has clear thematic preoccupations. Approximately half of his oeuvre is devoted to the Aśvins (116–120), with important catalogues of their deeds and services. (Much of what we know or surmise about the mythology of the Aśvins comes from these hymns.) He is also particularly interested in women in all their aspects: there are important and high-style treatments of the marriage of Sūryā and the Aśvins’ wooing of her, as well as two lovely Dawn hymns (123–124) sketching a range of female roles, but there is also a nearly obscene celebration of a girl he received as a gift from his patron (126.6–7) that presses the boundaries of R̥gvedic decorum.Because so much of Kakṣīvant’s artistry is bound up with his manipulation of the Sanskrit language even at the phonological level, the special flavor of his poetry is particularly hard to convey in translation, unfortunately.I.116 AśvinsKakṣīvant Dairghatamasa25 verses: triṣṭubhThis hymn is a catalogue that mentions many stories in which the Aśvins came to the rescue of those in need but that provides little detail. There is some thematic linkage among the narratives, which in three instances occur in sets of four. So, for example, the hymn begins with references to the Aśvins’ chariot or chariots and to the chariot-animals in verses 1–4 and then returns to them once again not quite at the end but toward the end, in verses 17–20. Verses 13–16 contain a set of stories involving body parts: the hands of the Aśvins in verse 13, the mouth of the wolf in 14, the foot of a mare in 15, and the eyes of R̥jrā śva in 16. Elsewhere the poet repeatedly returns to references to waters or liquids (vss. 3, 5, 7, 9). Such linked verses do not structure the hymn tightly, but they keep it from becoming merely a list of great deeds.The Aśvins are closely associated with the Pravargya, originally an independent rite that was incorporated into the classical soma ritual either during the upasad-days that precede the soma-pressing day or on the pressing day itself. In this rite milk is poured into a heated pot and offered to the Aśvins. This hymn explicitly refers to the Pravargya rite in the first verse, which employs the marked verb prá vr̥ñje, which gave the Pravargya its name. The verb describes either placing the Pravargya pot on the fire or turning the pot to offer the milk. In the penultimate verse, the poet frames"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"I.116269the hymn by an indirect reference to the Pravargya by describing Rebha as “having twisted” (právr̥kta) in the water.Many of the deeds alluded to in this hymn are likewise mentioned in the fol-lowing four Aśvin hymns (I.117–20), especially the first two, often in the same or similar phraseology.1. I twist (the milk-pot) as (one twists) the ritual grass and I stir up the praise songs, like winds the rain clouds, for the Nāsatyas,who have carried a wife down to our little Vimada with their chariot that is swift as a weapon,2.

Through three nights and through three days, o Nāsatyas, you carried Bhujyu with your winged ones that wander far beyond:(you carried him) on the wasteland of the sea, at the far shore of the watery (sea), with your three chariots with their hundred feet and six horses.5. Then you two acted as heroes upon the unsupporting sea, which has no place to stand and nothing to grasp,when, Aśvins, you carried Bhujyu home after he mounted your ship of a hundred oars.6. O Aśvins, the white horse that you gave to (Pedu), whose horse was bad, to be everlasting well-being (for him)—that great gift of yours is to be famed. The racehorse of Pedu is ever to be called upon by the stranger.7. O men, you two dug out plentifulness for Pajra’s son, Kakṣīvant, who was praising you.You poured from the filter, the hoof of the bull-like horse, a hundred pots of liquor.8. With snow you two kept away fire and scorching heat. You placed the nourishment of solid food for him.You brought Atri up to well-being, who had been brought down into the earth cleft together with his whole band.9.

The problem for the poet is that such a hymn listing so many of the gods’ deeds could easily become just an inventory without any real coherence. One of the poet’s solutions to this problem is to create verbal and thematic linkages among verses and sets of verses in order to organize and unify his composition.At the highest level the great deeds of the Aśvins are arranged according to theme. First are deeds in which the Aśvins rescue those who have been hidden away in some fashion: Atri in the earth cleft (3), Rebha in the waters (4), and Vandana in the ground (5). Then, the poet shifts from the Aśvins’ rescues to their generosity. The theme is announced in verse 6 and then exemplified in verses 7–9. The Aśvins give the gift of a wife (7ab) and husband (7cd), a bright body (8ab), fame (8cd), and a horse (9). Verse 10 then summarizes this theme and announces a new one"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"I.117272that extends the image of the horse in verse 9. The deeds in the next section turn on the Aśvins as charioteers and horsemen. They bring prizes to the poet (11ab) and restore the racing mare Viśpalā (11d). Verses 12–16 connect the Aśvins’ deeds to the journeys of their chariot and horses. On those journeys they come to the aid of C yavāna, Bhujyu, and others. The last extended set of verses, verses 16–22, describe a variety of different acts, but all these verses mention animals: a quail (16), sheep and a she-wolf (17–18), a barren cow (20), a “wolf ” (possibly a plow; 21), and the head of a horse (22). This leaves aside verse 19, but the “lame one” here is probably the mare Viśpalā, one suggestion of Sāyaṇa. Note that the last two sets of verses overlap at verse 16, a join that again helps hold the poem together.Another way the poet creates a sense of unity is by the repetition of lexical items, sometimes used in different contexts. So, the poet uses the unusual verb sa﻿́m √rī “draw back together” in verses 4, 11, and 19 to describe a rescue from the sea, the repair of a horse, and the healing of the “lame one.” Or again, the Aśvins carried down (ní. . .ūhathuḥ) a horse or a bride (9b, 20d) and carried Bhujyu out (níḥ. . .ūhathuḥ) of the sea (14d, 15c). In 5c níkhāta “buried” describes Vandana; níkhāta occurs again in 12c, although it is not clear to whom the latter verse refers. Sāyaṇa suggests that it is Rebha, who was “buried” in the waters, an interpretation supported by the reference to the tenth day (cf. I.116.24). However, since the verb níkhāta was just used with Vandana in verse 5cd, it may be he to whom the verse refers.Likewise, the poet links consecutive verses by repeating the same or similar words. The Aśvins rescue the seer (ŕ̥ṣi) Atri in 3a and the seer Rebha in 4b. Each of verses 20–22 addresses the aśvinā and the “wondrous ones” (dasrā/dasrau). The four hemistichs of verses 13 and 14 all begin with yuvo﻿́ḥ or yuva﻿́m. Verses 15 and 16 both begin a﻿́johavīt “he called again and again.” Such verbal concatenation again helps unify the diverse contents of the hymn.The poet explores other kinds of verbal play, some of which create intercon-nections within the poem, but others reflect other purposes or simply his artistry as a poet. For example, víṣakta “drooping” of 20a is phonologically rearranged in 24c as the rare word víkasta “split apart.” There appears to be another phonologi-cal connection in verse 16cd between viṣvā́c, the personal name Viṣvāc, which may mean the “Double-Talker,” and viṣa﻿́ “poison.” However, the interpretation of this hemistich is problematic, in part because Viṣvāc and his son are only attested here. Geldner and others understand the poison to be the means by which the Aśvins destroy the son of Viṣvāc, but if so, such use of poison by the Aśvins is isolated. Rather, the poison may have given rise to the son of Viṣvāc, an interpretation sup-ported by the phonological similarity of viṣvā́c and viṣa﻿́. Perhaps the idea is that Viṣvāc’s son is born from the “poison” of his “double-talking” speech.1.

It begins with an invitation to the Aśvins to come to the sacrifice on their chariot. Indeed, it is their chariot that is the focus of the poet’s attention through most of the first half of the poem. The triplets associated with the chariot—its three chariot boxes (vss. 1–2), three wheels (2), and three turnings (2)—suggest the sacrifice itself with its three soma offer-ings. Within the poem, therefore, the ritual performance thus becomes an image of the Aśvins’ chariot, and its realization a sign of the arrival of the Aśvins. The chariot not only brings the Aśvins to the sacrifice but it also brings help to the sacrificer (vs. 1). Ancient poets have told of the help of the Aśvins (3cd), and the second part of the poem (vss. 5–9) begins with a recital of the many men and even animals in their many desperate situations whom the Aśvins have helped. The hymn then returns to the poet’s own need for help (vs. 10), and in verse 11 there is once again a summons of the Aśvins. The last verse creates a formal ring, for just as in verse 1 the Aśvins should come quickly in their “falcon-winged chariot” (ra﻿́thaḥ. . . śyena﻿́patvā), so in verse 11 the Aśvins should come with the “fresh speed of a falcon” (śyena﻿́sya ja﻿́vasā nū́tanena).1.

However, the offering mentioned is not soma, but rather the hot milk (gharma﻿́) of the Pravargya rite (vs. 2cd). In 2cd and probably verse 3 Kakṣīvant describes the arrival of the Aśvins, who bring Sūryā, the Daughter of the Sun, to her wedding. The bridegroom of Sūryā is Soma in the late R̥gveda (X.85), but in"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"I.1192775cd she chooses the Aśvins themselves as her husbands. Pirart (1995: 252) suggests that yuvā́m pa﻿́tī is a corruption for yuvā́m pa﻿́tim* and therefore the line means that Sūryā chose “the young (Soma) as her husband.” But if the gharma﻿́ in this hymn in some sense displaces the soma, perhaps the poet has replaced the god Soma by the deities of the Pravargya rite, the Aśvins. For further on the self-choice marriage of Sūryā and Kakṣīvant’s treatments of it, see Jamison (2001). In this connection verse 3 contains one of Kakṣīvant’s characteristic verbal tricks: the phrase sūrím ā́ va﻿́ram, which literally means “the patron according to his will,” is a scrambling of *sūriyā́m va﻿́ram, with a reference to Sūryā (whose name is normally read trisyl-labically as Sūr(i)yā) and her svayaṃ-vara (self-choice) marriage. This scrambled phrase is “repaired” in verse 5 with the straightforward declaration of her choice. See Jamison (2006).1.

For example, in Geldner’s view the hymn concludes with the poet’s complaint that his patron has been ungenerous. Much of the hymn reflects that disappointment: Kakṣīvant pretends to be a simple man but creates metrically irregular, obscure verses, charac-terized by irony and hidden malice. While there is much to recommend in Geldner’s approach to the hymn, we have taken a different tack.The most notable feature of this hymn is its strange metrical pattern. The hymn begins in gāyatrī (vs. 1), a simple and common meter, but then sinks gradually into metrical chaos and finally emerges gradually into gāyatrī once again (vss. 10–12). The metrical transitions are marked by verse 2 in kakubh and verse 9 in virāj. Both are rarer Vedic meters, but they are meters found elsewhere. However, the middle section (vss. 3–8) changes meter in every verse and with one exception (vs. 6 in uṣṇih), the meters are jagged and very unusual. The impression they make is one of dislocation and even poetic incompetence, although it is obviously an artful and deliberate incompetence.This metrical structure underscores the theme of the hymn. The poet begins, in gāyatrī, with a question about who will earn the support of the Aśvins. The first two pādas are typical and formulaic. Indeed, they reflect a very old, traditional formula,"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"I.120279since the phrasing of ab resembles lines from the Gāthās of Zarathustra: Yasna 33.2 tōi vārāi rādəntī, ahurahyā zaošē mazdā “These will bring success to his desire and will be to the liking of the Wise Lord.” If this formulaic identification is cor-rect, then pāda c may stand in intentionally shocking contrast: it is a question not about a successful worshiper but about an incompetent one, and immediately after this question the poet’s meter begins to disintegrate. The poet does not have the knowledge he needs (2) and fears that he might become someone aceta﻿́s “without insight,” a word that recalls a﻿́pracetas “inattentive” in 1c and the anxiety that pro-pels the hymn. The Aśvins know a certain entranceway, “doors,” that the poet does not. Pirart (1995: 263) suggests that these doors are the “doors of riches,” after I.68.10, 72.8, and similarly IX.45.3 = 64.3, and Geldner, the “doors of awareness” after IX.10.6 and similarly VII.95.6. It would be fully in accord with Kakṣīvant’s enigmatic style to mean either and both, especially since the poet’s knowledge and his prosperity are bound together.Because of his anxiety, the poet calls on the Aśvins to help him (3–4). Verses 5 and 6 are particularly problematic, but they appear to describe the poet’s shortcomings. His speech is not grand like that recited before the Bhr̥g avāna fire, the fire originally lit by Bhr̥gu that symbolizes the unity of all the clans, and it is not beautiful (5). His voice is rough, but he asks the Aśvins to hear his song as if it were the song that Takavāna sings (6). Takavāna appears only here, but judging from the context he is someone whose beautiful voice the poet hopes the Aśvins will hear instead of his own raspy one. The poet thus asks the Aśvins to overlook his faults, and not to consign him and his people to the evildoings of their enemies (7–8). In the last verses the crisis seems to have passed. The poet’s verse stabilizes (into virāj), and the poet can hope that his measured pādas will win him measures of goods (9). At the beginning of this verse he also demonstrates his ability to puzzle. The subject is a cow, suggested by the previous verse, but what does the cow represent? Although it looks back several verses, one possibility is his Speech (vs. 5). Before he couldn’t speak the way he wished, but now he hopes that his Speech will yield the milk that will bind the Aśvins to him.In verse 10 the “horseless chariot” of the Aśvins is the hymn, which, safely back in gāyatrī, is now running smoothly. It will carry the poet to successful sacrifices (11). This then leaves a problem in interpreting the last verse. Perhaps the anxiety he expressed in the middle of the hymn was not real but imagined, a kind of a dream. This last verse then might be the dismissal of that anxiety and of the concern that he will not receive the patronage he deserves.1. What oblation to you will bring success, Aśvins? Who will be to the liking of you both?How will he make offering?—he, an inattentive man!2. He should ask just the two [=the Aśvins] who know about the doors—he, the man who does not know properly, who later (would be) without insight.Never are the two inactive around the mortal."},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"I.1212803.

It"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"I.121281seems that antiquity had a similar reaction, as the Anukramaṇī is not even sure whether the hymn is dedicated to Indra or to the All Gods. We will here sketch a structure and suggest some themes, but we make no claims for the correctness of all the choices made in our translation or commentary.The predominant deity of the hymn must be Indra, though his name does not appear until verse 11, and the governing myth of the hymn is that of the opening of the Vala cave. But other mythic material is interspersed through the hymn, and the present-day sacrificial situation is also treated—while, conversely, the Vala myth is sometimes presented as if it were happening at this moment. In fact, the first verse sets up this scenario, with questions about Indra’s attendance at a sacrifice where the Aṅgirases, his helpers in the Vala myth, are performing their hymns. The same prospective appearance of Indra among the Aṅgirases is also described in verse 3, with the recital of the Vala myth continued, in the past, in verse 4. The intervening verse (2) is also couched in the mythic past and begins (2ab) with Indra’s primal cosmogonic deed, the separation of heaven and earth. The second half of verse 2 contains one of the most discussed portions of the hymn, a set of three memorably described female figures whose relationships to each other and to the “buffalo” who is gazing upon at least one of them are unclear. In our view, all three figures are different forms of Dawn, the subject of two of Kakṣ īvant’s other hymns (I.123–124), as she transforms herself from a young girl choosing her husband (the Sun) to a wife (of the Sun in the form of a horse) to a mother (of a cow: the light of Dawn is frequently compared to cows). The buffalo is probably Indra, and the focus on Dawn is appropri-ate to a hymn celebrating the opening of the Vala cave and the release of the dawn-cows.Verse 4 alluded to the impetus that drinking soma gave to Indra at the opening of the Vala cave, and the following two verses (5–6) sketch the history of Indra’s possession of soma and then turn to the soma currently being produced at today’s dawn sacrifice. The following, quite puzzling verse (7) seems to identify Indra with the sun and, by implication, with the shining soma of the previous verse, also com-pared to the sun. The poet seems further to suggest that, even in the absence of all the sacrificial necessities, the presence of radiant Indra is tantamount to a properly performed sacrifice, for the benefit of the poet and his family. (We suggest that Kakṣīvant is alluding to himself here, on the basis of similar vocabulary used in I.126.5.)Verse 8 begins a series of mythological verses, with an intertwining of the Vala myth (9ab, 10ab) and that of Indra’s slaying of Śuṣṇa with the aid of Uśanā Kāvya (9cd, 10cd, 11d, 12) and the related myth of the halting of the Sun’s horses and chariot (13), with incidental mentions of other deeds of Indra (the Vr̥tra battle, 11c) thrown in. The interpenetration of these mythic allusions keeps the audi-ence off balance, a queasy feeling much increased by the disjunctive and elliptical syntax."},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"I.121282The final two verses (14–15), asking for protection and valuables, are by contrast quite straightforward. Presumably on this subject Kakṣīvant did not want the god to misunderstand.1. Will he, hastening to the cup of the men seeking the gods, listen properly to the hymns of the Aṅgirases?When he has reached the clans of the secure habitation, will the one worthy of the sacrifice stride widely at their ceremony?2.

As is true of all of Kakṣīvant’s oeuvre there are many twists and turns along the way. The part devoted to the gods seems to define an early-morning sacrifice in its first verses, especially those calling on Dawn and Night (vs. 2), the Wind as well as Indra (vs. 3), and the Aśvins and Agni (vs. 4), though Rudra and the Maruts (vs. 1), Pūṣan (vs. 5), and, especially, Mitra and Varuṇa (vss. 6–7, 9) also appear.

In fact it appears that we may be dealing with competing potential patrons, each praised for a fleeting moment for his generosity until a larger prize from a different patron is in the offing. In verse 12 the poet seems to be inviting this competition, promising to act as a kind of kingmaker for whom-ever he gets as patron, and in the difficult verse 13 the poet may be suggesting that patrons with goods to offer are attempting to surpass competing patrons with their largesse. This interpretation remains uncertain, however.1. O you of quick fervor [=priests], bring forward your drink, your stalk, your sacrifice for Rudra who grants rewards.I have praised (him) along with the heroes of the lord of heaven; (I have praised) the Maruts as if aiming at the two world-halves.2.

It begins with references to the dakṣiṇā or “priestly gifts” distributed at the early-morning sacrifice (vss. 1–6), almost as if to get the business of the hymn out of the way. But even here the gifts are clearly under the control of the lovely young Dawn, whose beauties are hinted at.

In the last of these verses (9), Dawn’s daily journey is likened to a girl’s going to a lovers’ tryst, and this simile provides the transition to the next two verses (10–11), where she is compared to a beautiful young woman showing herself off. The final two verses (12–13) combine the gift theme of the beginning of the hymn with the periodicity of the dawns treated in the middle section.1. A broad chariot has been yoked for the priestly gift. The gods, the immortals have mounted it.Up from the dark has arisen the lady of extensive power, being attentive to the human dwelling place.2. Earlier than all creation she has awoken, the lofty one, conquering, winning the prize.On high she has gazed forth—the young woman come into being again. Dawn has come here, the first one at the Early Invocation.3. When today you will share out a share to the superior men among mortals, o nobly born goddess Dawn,god Savitar, master of the house, will here declare to the Sun that we are without offense.4. To house after house she drives *in her greatness, day after day assuming (new) names.Seeking to win, flashing, over and over she has come hither. She has her share of the very tip-top of goods.5. Sister of Bhaga, kin to Varuṇa, o liberal Dawn, be first awake.The institutor of evil should lag behind. Might we conquer him with a priestly gift as our chariot.6. Let liberalities rise up, up plentiful gifts; up have the blazing fires stood.The eagerly sought goods hidden by darkness do the radiant dawns reveal.7. The one goes away; the other approaches: having distinct forms, the two day-halves proceed in tandem.Of the two that circle around, the one has hidden the darkness: Dawn has flashed with her ever-blazing chariot.8. Of the same appearance today, just the same appearance also tomorrow, they follow the long(-standing) ordinance of Varuṇa.The faultless ones make a circuit through thirty “wagon-treks” [=days of the month], each one encompassing her purpose in a single day.9.

Let there be riches among us and among our bounteous (patrons).I.124 DawnKakṣīvant Dairghatamasa13 verses: triṣṭubhAnother virtuosic Dawn hymn. Here the poet takes the usual generic themes, espe-cially Dawn as a beautiful woman, and creates highly specific images, especially in verses 7–8, which provide a series of almost sociological portraits of ancient Indian female figures. In verse 7 we first (pāda a) meet a brotherless girl boldly approaching men; since the brother was important in finding and arranging suitable matches, a brotherless girl was at a disadvantage in the marriage market and needed to take initiative on her own. (See Schmidt 1987: 30–75.) The next image is a pun (pāda b), with one harmless generic image and one shockingly specific one. In the harmless reading a figure, presumably male, mounts a chariot to seek prizes; in the other a woman, presumably a prostitute, shows herself off on a platform for money. The third image (pādas cd) is of the legitimate wife adorned for her husband, but even there the image shades into that of a loose woman showing her breast. The next verse (8) treats the common theme of the sisters Dawn and Night, but again Dawn is presented in a particular female role. In the second pāda, the “girl to be gazed upon” may well refer to the display motif of the ancient Indian self-choice marriage (Svayaṃvara; see Jamison 2001), while the “maidens with a choice” may refer to the same phenomena, girls making their choice of bridegroom at a specially called assembly (see Jamison 2003).Even more striking perhaps is verse 4, where Dawn is compared to three differ-ent animals or their parts: she is glossy like the breast of a waterbird who preens it;"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"I.124288she reveals herself like an elephant kneeling to drink; and she wakens the sleeping like a fly, buzzing around again and again. (We owe these interpretations to Thieme 1965 [=1971: 214–27].)Nothing in the rest of the hymn is quite so quirky, but the standard tropes are well handled. The common counterpoint between individual Dawn and the multi-tude of identical dawns that have preceded and will follow today’s dawn is found in verses 2–3, 6, and 9. Another common theme, the diversity of beings that Dawn awakens, appears in verses 1, 6, and 12. The final verses of the hymn raise the hope of gifts and rewards that will come with the dawn.1. Dawn as she dawns when the fire is being kindled; the sun as it rises—each has propped up its own light widely.God Savitar here and now has impelled forth our two-footed, forth our four-footed, each to go to its task.2. Not belittling the divine commandments, but diminishing human (life-)spans,the last of those who, one by one, have gone, the first of those who come hither—Dawn has flashed forth.3. This Daughter of Heaven has appeared opposite, dressed in light, in the same way (as the others), from the east.She follows along the path of truth, straight to the goal. Like one who knows the way, she does not confound the directions.4. She has appeared like the breast of a preening waterbird. Like a female elephant she has revealed her intimate parts.Wakening the sleeping like a fly, she has come as the latest of those who, one by one, have come here again (and again).5. In the eastern half of the dusky realm that cannot be flown to, the begetter of cows has put forth her beacon.She spreads out further, more widely, filling both laps of her two parents [=Heaven and Earth].6. Just thus is she, the latest of many, to be seen. Neither the non-kin does she avoid, nor the kin.Exulting in her spotless body, neither from the small does she retreat, nor from the great, as she shines forth.7. Like a brotherless (girl) she goes right up to men—like one mounting a chariot seat to win prizes [/(display-)platform to gain property].Like an eager wife, richly dressed, for her husband, Dawn, like a wanton, lets her breast spill over.8. The (one) sister has left the natal place to her older sister. She goes away from her, like (a girl) to be gazed upon.Dawning forth with the rays of the sun, she smears unguent on herself, like (maidens) with a choice going to assemblies."},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"I.1252899.

The second part (vss. 4–7) develops an extravagant picture of the rewards that accrue to the gener-ous giver and sacrificer. The whole cosmos seems to exist only to gratify him, and a place among the gods as an immortal awaits him. The syntax and sentiments are straightforward and indeed somewhat simplistic.The other section (vss. 1–3) is quite different. It consists of an apparent dia-logue between an “early-coming” figure (vs. 3) and, probably, a householder or host (vs. 2), with a scene-setting introduction (vs. 1). The word “early-coming” (prātarítvan) is found only in this hymn and in a narrative in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā (besides the later etymological work, the Nirukta), where the same dialogic rela-tionship between the Prātaritvan and a householder, in that case Manu, obtains. In both passages the Prātaritvan seems to be an itinerant priest or poet, offer-ing his ritual services to a sacrificer, his potential host. But he also stands in for or represents a god who is coming to attend the early-morning ritual. (Compare the compound of similar form and similar meaning prātaryā́van “early-driving, early-traveling,” used especially of the Aśvins and their chariot.) Thus, the host is"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"I.125290more inclined to receive the itinerant Prātaritvan because he may be entertaining a god in disguise, and the Prātaritvan is not only seeking payment for his ritual work, the dakṣiṇā whose giver is lyrically celebrated in verses 4–7, but also himself brings (or claims to bring) goods and good fortune for his host, as is emphasized in all three verses of this portion of the hymn. The relationship between them is also presented as somewhat coercive or threatening in the second half of verse 2 (which unfortunately contains several hapaxes and is therefore not very clear). The Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā narrative, a version of “Manu’s Cups,” depicts that threat much more strongly, as an aspect of the “anxieties of hospitality.” For further discussion see Jamison (1996a: 184–89).1. In the early morning, the early-coming (priest/god) establishes a treasure. An observant man, receiving him (as guest), lays it in himself.Increasing his own progeny and lifetime with it, possessing good heroes, he is accompanied by thriving of wealth.2. [The host:] “He will have good cows, good gold, good horses—for him Indra establishes lofty vigor—he who, o early-comer, binds you up like a pard [?] with a thong [?], when you come hither with goods.”3. [The early-comer:] “I have come here today early in the morning with a goods-filled chariot, seeking one who performs (sacrifice) well, the son of my seeking.Make (Indra?) drink the pressed (soma) of the exhilarating plant; strengthen the hero-ruling (Indra?) with liberal gifts.”4. The rivers, embodiments of joy, milk-cows, flow near to the one who has sacrificed and the one who will sacrifice;seeking fame, the streams of ghee on every side go near to him who grants and has granted.5. On the back of the firmament he stands firmly fixed. Whoever grants, he goes among the gods;to him the waters, the rivers stream ghee; for him this gift-cow (dakṣiṇā) swells always.6. For the givers of dakṣiṇās only there are these brilliant (bounties) here; for the givers of dakṣiṇās there are suns in heaven.Givers of dakṣiṇās have a share in immortality; givers of dakṣiṇās lengthen their own lifetime.7. Let those who grant not encounter difficulty or outrage; let the patrons, of good commandment, not grow old;let there be some other enclosure for them, but to the non-granting one let there come the flames of pain."},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"I.126291I.126 Kakṣı̄vant’s DānastutiKakṣīvant Dairghatamasa7 verses: triṣṭubh, except anuṣṭubh 6–7Kakṣīvant’s last hymn is, to be idiomatic, a humdinger. It details in extravagant terms the gifts that King Svanaya Bhāvya presented to him, in return for the fame the poet could bestow on him (see esp. vss. 1d and 2d). The first five verses list the gifts, especially the (not quite believable) numbers of livestock, given to Kakṣ īvant and his family, the Pajras. The last of these verses (5) ends with an elaborate simile, not all the details of which are clear, comparing the Pajras seeking fame with noblemen seeking brides by attending maidens’ Svayaṃvaras (bridal self-choice ceremonies) with their carts. (The word “cart” [ánas] is spe-cialized in the R̥gveda for the vehicle that conveys the bride home.) The phrase “(the Pajras) sought fame” (5d) provides a ring with the first verse (1d), where the king, Kakṣīvant’s patron, is “seeking fame,” and brings the dānastuti proper to a close.The final two verses (6–7) provide an erotic, indeed rather obscene, appendix, with a vignette of the poet and one of the girls he received as part of his gift. Already in verse 3 “ten chariots carrying brides” were mentioned as part of his loot, and the simile about Svayaṃvaras in verse 5 also helps set up the erotic atmosphere. Besides the striking simile of a mongoose (kaśīkā, a playful variant of the poet’s name Kakṣīvant) as sexual partner, verse 6 contains a number of hapaxes and entirely unclear lexical items, which may well involve phonological deformation to play on taboo words. (The second half of the verse appears to allow the word yabh “fuck” to be assembled from parts of several words.) It is a pity that we understand it as little as we do. The last verse (7) contains the osten-sible and crudely seductive speech of the woman herself. Kakṣīvant has indeed gone out with a bang.1. Not feeble are the praises I present through my inspiration to Bhāvya who lives on the Sindhu,who meted out to me a thousand (soma-)pressings, the invincible king seeking fame.2. A hundred neck-ornaments of the king in want (of fame), a hundred horses I took as soon as they were offered;a hundred cows of the lord (I), Kakṣīvant, (have taken). (Now) his unaging fame stretches to heaven.3. The dusky (horses) given by Svanaya have come to me, and ten chariots carrying brides.A thousand and sixty cattle have followed.

This poet is especially fond of the long and elaborate atyaṣṭi meter, consisting of seven pādas, generally arranged in three groups: 12 12 8 / 8 8 / 12 8. The eight-syllable pādas that end the first and third “lines” (that is, pādas c and g) generally ring changes on the pāda that precedes, by repetition of the last word(s), by lexical substitution of synonyms, or by syntactic complementarity. A simple example of the first is I.127.1c, which repeats the epithet jātávedasam, which also ended 1b. Lexical substitution is found in 1g, where sarpíṣaḥ “of the melted butter” replaces ghr̥tásya “of the ghee” in 1f. Sometimes the “rhyme” pāda contributes material necessary to complete the syntax established in the preceding pāda. See I.127.2fg, where the rhyme pāda g provides the verb that must be supplied in the relative clause in pāda f. There are more com-plex relationships as well, including what will later be called śleṣas, with a word or construction having two possible and incompatible readings. A nice example is I.127.3bc, where the form druhaṃtaráḥ can be analyzed either as druhaṃ-tará “over-coming deceit” or dru-hantara “better at striking wood,” the former prevailing in pāda b and the latter, because of the simile “like an axe,” in pāda c. This patterned variation creates a pleasing effect. (In our translation the three groups of pādas are separated into three lines, and the rhyme pādas c and g are set off by dashes.)Paruchepa is also fond of rare words, sometimes phonetic deformations of parallel words in the same verse, puns, and contorted syntactic constructions, and many of the puzzles in his hymns have not been completely solved. But Geldner’s judgment of his poetry—“wortreich, aber gedankenarm” (rich in words, but poor in thoughts)—seems harsh and unjustified. These poems are difficult to work through, but their verbal artistry and intricacy seem to us to provide a more than sufficient reward."},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"I.127293I.127 AgniParuchepa Daivodāsi11 verses: atyaṣṭi, except atidhr̥ti 6Full of puns, phonological tricks, and syntactic give-and-take, this hymn celebrates Agni in both his ritual role (e.g., vss. 1–2, 8, 10) and in his physical power (e.g., vss. 3–4, 6). The pleasures of the hymn come more from the interplay of the verbal ele-ments than from any sustained thematic development, and in that sense Geldner’s “gedankenarm” (quoted above) may be accurate, but who needs thoughts when we have such words?1. Agni I consider as the Hotar, rich in gifts, the good one, son of strength, Jātavedas—like a poet, Jātavedas—who is the god of good ceremony, with his body erect and pointed toward the gods.With his flame he yearns after the blazing forth of the ghee—of the melted butter being poured.2.

Though its theme is clear and inescapable, the hymn presents us with manifold interpretive difficulties in its details, especially in the central verses 4–5, which, with their responsive fronted krátvā (“though his resolve,” 4cd, 5a), may constitute an omphalos. There is also some sign of ring composition: the first and last (8) verses each twice refer to Agni as the Hotar, a word used nowhere else in the hymn, and the mentions of Manu in verses 1–2 are answered by two occurrences of Manu in the penultimate verse (7). In general there is much reuse of vocabulary through the hymn, and the poet plays with the words “good” and “goods” in the second part of the hymn (vss. 5–6, 8). Though the poet does not himself beg for goods, it seems clear that the desire for goods he attributes to the gods (8fg) is shared by their human counterparts.1. This one was born here on the foundation of Manu as the best sacrificing Hotar, following the commandment of the fire-priests—Agni, following his own commandment—all attentive to the one who seeks a comrade, like wealth for the one who seeks fame.The undeceivable Hotar has sat down in the footprint of refreshment—enveloped in the footprint of refreshment.2. The one who sends the sacrifice to its goal along the path of truth: we make him our familiar with reverence accompanied by oblations—in the conclave of gods (with reverence) accompanied by oblations.Because of our presentation of nourishments he does not waste away with this body,he whom Mātariśvan (brought) to Manu from afar—the god he brought from afar.3. On his way he circles round the earthly (realm) in a single day, swallowing it up in an instant, the bull (depositing) his seed ever roaring—depositing his seed ever roaring—observing with a hundred eyes, the god victorious in the woods,taking his seat on the nearer ridges—Agni, on the further ridges.4. Strongly resolved (to sacrifice), installed in front in every house, Agni is attentive to the sacrifice, to the ceremony—through his resolve he is attentive to the sacrifice.Through his resolve he is a ritual expert for the straight-arrow; he has watched over all beingsfrom the time when as guest he was born splendid with ghee—as the conveyor (of the offering), the ritual expert, he was born."},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"I.1292965. When through his resolve and along with the roaring of fire, which is like the roaring of the Maruts [=thunder], the (offering-)foods are infused into his forces [=flames]—like foods for the vigorous one [=Indra?]—because then he stimulates the giving (of good) and of goods by his might,he will rescue us from going astray, from the crooked way—from evil utterance, from the crooked way.6. Every (new fire), possessing extensive power, the spoked wheel (of the sacrifice), the good one, takes (goods) in his right hand; advancing he does not let (them) loose—because of his longing for fame he does not let (them) loose.For everyone who aims straight you have conveyed his oblation among the gods.To everyone who performs well he propels his wish—Agni propels apart the two door-halves.7. He has been established as most beneficial in the ritual enclosure belonging to Manu; Agni (has been established) like a noble clanlord at the sacrifices—a dear clanlord at the sacrifices.He is master of the oblations of the sons of Manu, the oblations prepared with the refreshing drink.He will rescue us from the injury of Varuṇa—from the injury of the great god.8. Agni, the Hotar, the depository of goods do they reverently invoke; the dear, most conspicuous one they have installed as the spoked wheel (of the sacrifice)—they have installed as the conveyor of oblations—the one who provides all lifetimes and all possessions, the Hotar deserving the sacrifice, the sage poet.The gods, seeking goods, (have installed) the lusty one, for help—seeking goods (they have installed) the lusty one with hymns.I.129 IndraParuchepa Daivodāsi11 verses: atyaṣṭi, except atiśakvarī 8–9, aṣṭi 11The hymn begins with familiar, and positive, themes: calls to Indra to aid our actual chariot in prize-contests and also our metaphorical chariot, the sacrifice (vss. 1–2), and these themes recur throughout the hymn. But the poet seems preoccupied with more negative topics—not only rivals and enemies in battle (vss. 3–5, 10) and demons (vss. 6, 9, 11), but also evil thoughts and words (vss. 6–8, 11). Bad Thought appears to be personified as a menacing female in verse 8, and more surprisingly Indra seems himself to have potential bad thoughts toward us, his worshipers, which we must combat by supplying him with good things to think about (vs. 7)."},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"I.129297Given the forces thus arrayed against us, the calls for Indra’s protection grow ever stronger toward the end of the hymn (vss. 9–11).1.

But this journey motif gives way to a rapid sampling of Indra’s great deeds: Vala (vs. 3), Vr̥tra (vss. 4–5), battles against various human and legendary enemies (vss. 7–8), ending with a truly impenetrable verse (9) about the theft of the wheel of the Sun’s chariot and the involvement of Uśanā, a myth that also elsewhere evokes all the obscurantism the Vedic bard has in his control (see, e.g., V.29 and 31).

But it quickly becomes apparent (vss. 2–3) that Indra is also an object of contention and competition among different groups of men, who all want him on their side. This con-tention is vividly depicted in verse 3. In verses 4–5 Indra’s own inclinations become apparent: he aids priests and sacrificers and chastises those without sacrifice. In verse 6 we announce our own sacrifice to Indra, and thereby make a claim for his attention, and in verse 7 we ask for further aid against our rivals and ill-wishers.1. Because to Indra the lordly Heaven has ever bowed, and to Indra the great Earth has bowed with her expanses—at the winning of heavenly brilliance with her expanses—Indra have all the gods in concert placed in front.To Indra let all the pressings belong that stem from the sons of Manu—all the gifts that stem from the sons of Manu.2. Because at all pressings those of bullish fervor thrust you forward, (each of them) separately (thrusts you who are) one and the same—those seeking to win the sun, (each) separately—you, like a boat of deliverance, we would place at the chariot-pole of our forceful (song),making Indra take notice (of us) with our sacrifices as the Āyus did—as the Āyus did Indra with their praises."},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"I.1323013.

It also falls naturally into two parts on the grounds of meter, subject matter, and diction: verses 1–5, which are mostly in dimeter meter and have an Atharvan cast, and verses 6–7 in atyaṣṭi (or modified atyaṣṭi) meter, which more nearly resembles the atyaṣṭi hymns ear-lier in the cycle. As Oldenberg already saw, we can thus analyze it as two hymns, of five and two verses respectively, which then conform to the usual patterns of arrangement.The first hymn contains a number of odd formations, whose meaning and ety-mology are unclear; our renderings are provisional. Despite these uncertainties, we can happily grasp the gusto with which the poet urges Indra to destroy troops of witches and other demonic beings.The second short hymn also enthusiastically rouses Indra against enemies, but in a style more recognizably R̥gvedic, and it situates the action in the interplay between the soma-pressing sacrificer and Indra, the recipient of the soma and the sacrifice.1.

For most of its length it is preoccupied with the usual themes of Vāyu hymns: Vāyu’s journey to the sacrifice with his many teams and his right to the first drink of soma at the Morning Pressing. The first tr̥ca (vss. 1–3) is an invitation to Vāyu alone; the second (vss. 4–6), thematically and verbally parallel to the first, is addressed to Vāyu and Indra, who share the second soma oblation at the Morning Pressing.The last tr̥ca (vss. 7–9) is less straightforward. The first of its verses (7) seems to describes an ongoing sacrifice to which Vāyu and Indra are traveling, a journey con-tinued in the first part of verse 8. And the fortunate results of the successful sacri-fice are described at the end of verse 8, the thriving of stock and agriculture. But in between is the mention of a mysterious fig tree. The final verse (9) is even more mys-terious, with its unidentified oxen of paradoxical movement and habits. Since the vocabulary is reminiscent of the Marut lexicon, the oxen may be the Maruts, and the association of Vāyu (Wind) with the thunderstorm may be depicted.

And as the hymn nears its conclusion there are non-Ādityan gods as well: Indra and Agni in verses 6–7, the Maruts in verse 7. The hymn is defined by a ring formed by verses 1 and 6 (vs. 7 is in a different meter and extra-hymnic), with matches of key words in both verses: “lofty,” “reverence,” “compassionate,” and “approach with praise.”Unlike many Mitra and Varuṇa hymns, the focus here is not on their ethical role, but on their status as receivers of sacrificial offerings. The rising sun in verse 2 (see also vs. 3) suggests the Morning Pressing, where Mitra and Varuṇa are among the dual divinities who receive a joint cup of soma. The position of the hymn, imme-diately following two hymns to Vāyu, the first recipient of soma at the Morning Pressing, supports this view.1. Present preeminent, lofty reverence to the two attentive ones; present an oblation, a thought to the two compassionate ones—the sweetest (oblation) to the two compassionate ones.They are the two sovereign kings, whose potion is ghee, approached with praise at every sacrifice.And so the dominion of these two is not to be challenged from anywhere—their divinity is never to be challenged.2. The way has appeared—a wider one for the wide (light); its path has been firmly guided by the reins of truth—its eye by the reins of Bhaga.Heaven-dominating is the seat of Mitra and of Aryaman and Varuṇa.And so they two assume lofty vigor, worthy of hymns—lofty vigor to be approached with praise."},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"I.1373083.

For some reason, the hymn has attracted more than its share of scorn: Renou (EVP VII: 33) calls it “assez banale et facile,” and Gonda (1975: 212) classifies it among hymns that are “banal, mediocre or devoid of a deeper meaning.” Perhaps the lack of the high moral tone found in most Mitra and Varuṇa hymns aggrieved these commentators, but taken on its own terms, with its rollicking rhythm and restricted phraseology, it makes a pleasant impression."},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"I.1383091.

Instead, as befits the elaborate meter, this is high-register praise, with a somewhat bombastic and overblown edge and contorted syntax.The poet is especially concerned to establish “fellowship” (sakhyá, vss. 2–4) with the god—fellowship that will bring wealth and aid along with it.1. Ever further is (the greatness) of powerfully born Pūṣan proclaimed: the greatness of him, the powerful, does not flag—the praise of him does not flag.Seeking his favor, I chant to him, whose help is nearby, who is refreshment itself,who, the bounteous, has bound to himself the mind of everyone—the bounteous god has bound it to himself.2. So, Pūṣan, with praises I put you forward, like a nimble (horse) on its course, so that you will get the negligent ones on the move—like a camel you will carry (us) beyond the negligent ones.When I, a mortal, call upon you, a god, who are refreshment itself, for fellowship—make our songs brilliant—make them brilliant when prizes (are at stake)."},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"I.1393103.

The order of divinities in the Praügaśastra is Vāyu, Indra and Vāyu, Mitra and Varuṇa, the Aśvins, Indra, the All Gods, and Sarasvatī; this hymn follows this order through verse 6: Indra and Vāyu (vs. 1), Mitra and Varuṇa (vs. 2), the Aśvins (vss. 3–5), Indra (vs. 6), but ends with Agni (vs. 7), the Maruts (vs. 8), Indra and Agni (vs. 9), and Br̥haspati (vs. 10), with verse 11 in a different meter and addressed to all the gods collectively.The ritual situation is established at the very beginning, with the quotation of a familiar sacrificial formula ástu śrauṣaṭ, found all over middle Vedic ritual texts. This ritual-internal quotation is matched, in ring-compositional style, by the quotation of a praiṣa, or ritual command to the Hotar, in verse 10, the last real verse of the hymn. It is also clear that the time is early morning (see esp. vs. 4, though there are also more oblique indications in the first two verses), and that the sound of the pressing stones is calling the gods to the sacrifice (see vs. 3, and its ring-compositional echo in vs. 10).As so often, the difficulties in the hymn may stem in part from the fact that the poet is reflecting on his poetic lineage and calling. The obscure reference to the “umbilical tie” or “navel” in verse 1 is made somewhat clearer by verse 9, in which the poet asserts that his “umbilical ties” are with a series of earlier seers and sacri-ficers, including Manu—whose own ties are to the gods. He thus provides himself with a poetic pedigree and in following their track, or model, produces his own hymns that have some chance of reaching the gods, since his predecessors’ did. In verse 1 he mentions only one such predecessor: Vivasvant (lit., “possessing the"},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"I.139311shining forth”), who in later Vedic and even in late R̥gveda (Vālakh., VIII.52.1) is considered the father of Manu and who is often associated, as a proto-priest, with the pressing of soma. (His Avestan correspondent Vīvaŋuuaṇt is the first man who pressed haoma [Y 9.4].) So in verse 1 our poet proclaims that he is beginning a new hymn, by newly attaching himself to a legendary seer-sacrificer. But there is another likely meaning there as well: Vivasvant is identified as the sun in later Vedic, and quite possibly in some passages in the R̥gveda as well, and therefore the poet may also be making reference to the time of “shining forth,” namely early morning.The double reference to ritual poetry and to dawn continues in verse 2. Mitra and Varuṇa take “untruth away from truth,” thus enabling the poet and his peers to see the gods’ golden throne. On the one hand, the untruth can be darkness, and the removal of this darkness reveals the sun. On the other hand, the priests see this vision with their insights and their mind, and though they also see with their eyes, these are the “eyes of soma,” presumably the vision arising from drinking the soma. So on another level of interpretation what they see is a poetic vision.The three Aśvins verses (3–5) are fairly clear descriptions of the journey of those gods to the dawn sacrifice, and the invitation to Indra (vs. 6) is also straightforward, as is the praise of the Maruts (vs. 8). This clarity is unfortunately obscured in verse 7, whose translation is only provisional, though the direct speech of Agni is quite intriguing. He seems to be chiding the gods for having given the Aṅgirases a cow they (or in most interpretations, Aryaman and unspecified others) have milked out. From the mythological point of view, the cow should represent the cows imprisoned in the Vala cave that the Aṅgirases helped to liberate. In a ritual context this could be the cow that provides the milk to mix with soma; in a poetic context the poetic insight or vision that provided the Aṅgirases with songs. The role of Aryaman here is entirely unclear.As noted above, in verse 9 the poet situates himself in the poetic and sacrificial tradition, and in verse 10, another obscure verse (Geldner calls it “unintelligible” [unverständlich]), the ritual and poetic ring is closed.1. (Cry) “Let it be; he will hear.” I place Agni in front through my insight. Now we choose that heavenly troop—we choose Indra and Vāyu.Since our (umbilical tie) has been effectively bound anew to the umbilical tie in Vivasvant’s (sphere),then let our thoughts go forth—our thoughts (going) as if to the gods.2. Since, Mitra and Varuṇa, you took untruth away from truth by your own fervor—by your own fervor of skill—just in this way among the seats we saw the golden (throne) of you two,just with our insights and with our mind, with our own eyes—with our own eyes of soma.3.

The name Dīrghatamas means the one “of long darkness.” The Br̥haddevatā IV.14–15 (Macdonell) explains that he received this name because he was born blind, and the poet himself refers to his blindness in I.147.3. According to the Br̥haddevatā his sight was later restored by the gods. His name is also an appropriate reflection of the difficulty of many of his hymns. His affection for word play, symbolic language, syntactic anomaly, and ambiguous reference makes his hymns distinctive, original, and often highly elusive. He is one of the most challenging, but at the same time one of the most interesting poets of the R̥gveda.His hymns also present an unusual sequence of divinities. The list begins con-ventionally enough with I.140–150, which are dedicated to Agni, but the ordinar-ily expected series to Indra is missing. Instead 151–153 are to Mitra and Varuṇa, 154–156 to Viṣṇu or to Viṣṇu and Indra, 157–158 to the Aśvins, 159–160 to Heaven and Earth, and 161 to the R̥bhus. Then 162 and 163 are praises of the sacrificial horse, and 164, the climax of the collection, is a very long and very puzzling riddle hymn, which explores the mysteries of several Vedic rites. The second Aśvin hymn, I.158, is of particular interest because it is ostensibly an autobiographical hymn, composed when the poet was an old man and on the verge of being pushed aside. Partly on the basis of this hymn Br̥haddevatā IV.21–25 gives a second legend that his servants tried to drown Dīrghatamas. But he floated downstream and was res-cued in Aṅga where he married and then gave birth to the poet Kakṣīvant.I.140 AgniDīrghatamas Aucathya13 verses: jagatī, except jagatī or triṣṭubh 10, triṣṭubh 12–13This first hymn in the Dīrghatamas cycle is bristling with difficulties in detail, although it remains focused on its central topic, the kindling and spread of the fire. The first two verses establish the ritual scene, with the ritual fire sitting on (or at) the vedi, the “altar” that is really a dug-out depression in the ground on the axis between the eastern and western ritual fires, and with the poet’s presentation of his “thought” (a praise hymn) as clothing for the ritual fire. But natural fire, which spreads through the woods and devours them, is also referred to, especially in verse 2."},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"I.140314The chronological description of the kindling and growth of fire begins in verse 3 with a vivid depiction of the kindling sticks and the first faint stirrings of smoke and fire. The growing power of the fire and the swiftness of the spread of its flames, imagined as horses in verse 4, occupy the next verses (4–10). Fire’s burning of the plants that stoke it is given an erotic cast in verses 6–8, aided by the fact that several words for “plant” are feminine in gender. Their very destruction by fire is also envi-sioned as a transformation into a better and more vigorous form (see esp. vss. 7cd–8).The prayers for aid and material goods begin in verse 10, on behalf not only of a generic “us” but especially mentioning our patrons (vss. 10, 12) and others of our circle (vs. 12). One striking request is for a metaphorical boat to deliver us to the far shore of difficulty (vs. 12); the boat is described in some detail, including its possession of a foot or feet. We wonder if this refers to some sort of primitive keel or centerboard, which would probably be helpful to ensure that the boat make it across the current of a swift-flowing river. Unfortunately our knowledge of ancient Indian naval architecture is not sufficient to decide.1.

Plunging into the black, jerking back and forth, both his mothers [=kindling sticks], sharing the same abode, move athwart each other toward their child—to him, producing smoke, his tongues stretching forward, stirring thirstily, quivering, worthy to be attended upon, the increaser of his father [=priest].4. For Manu and the offspring of Manu to come they are harnessed—the speedy (horses) seeking to break free, running fast, drawing black furrows,quick, racing fast, breaking ranks, sped by the wind, swift.5.

The hymn begins and ends with the installation of the ritual fire (root dhā: 1ab, 13ab), providing a faint ring struc-ture; the second mention of its installation, with the adverb pratara﻿́m “further"},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"I.141316forward,” suggests that it refers to the installation of the new Āhavanīya fire to the east, a fire removed from the old Āhavanīya at the beginning of classical śrauta rituals.The first few verses cryptically describe the various forms of fire (vs. 2) and their production (vss. 3–4). The means of production are at first mythical or metaphori-cal, but in the second half of verse 4 the more familiar ritual churning of the fire is described, followed by his growth and rapid and unpredictable movement (vss. 5–8; see also vs. 1c). This type of erratic movement is iconically mirrored with extraor-dinary skill by our poet Dīrghatamas, who models it with abrupt changes of tense and a deliberate disregard for the usual matching of syntax and verse structure. In our reading there are enjambments across verses in 3–4, 4–5, and 6–7, with sentence breaks in verse-interior in 4, 5, 6—a very rare conjunction of syntactic anomalies. The vertiginous effect of piling clause upon clause and image upon image is espe-cially marked in the sequence beginning with 6b and lasting through 7—giving us a faint whiff of the Gerard Manley Hopkins of “The Windhover,” which models a bird’s flight with verbal means.The rest of the hymn is somewhat more conventional, beginning with verse 9, where Agni is addressed for the first time in the 2nd person. Until then not only is the hymn couched entirely in the 3rd person, but the word agní is entirely absent, either as the name of the god or as a designation of the natural substance fire. Verses 9–10 describe Agni’s contributions to the welfare of both men and gods, while verses 12–13 express hopes for further help and summarize the hymn itself. But even here, in verse 11 the poet plots a meandering syntactic and conceptual course starting from the “good fortune” (bhága) desired to be acquired in 10d and amplified in the first half of verse 11 to a pun on the god’s name Bhaga, with a rich set of images, a clashing set of objects to the verb “hold fast,” and a covert syntactic transformation of that very verb at the end of the verse.All in all, a tour de force of virtuosity.1. Yes, indeed! It is just so: the luster of the god, lovely to see, has been installed for wonder, after he was born of strength.When he zigzags up to it, our thought goes straight to success. Flowing together, the streams of truth have led (him).2. Abounding in food, he lies in his own (place) as the wondrous form of nourishment; his second (wondrous form lies) here among the mothers, sevenfold kindly.His third (wondrous form, that) of the bull to be milked, have the young women begotten—him of tenfold forethought.3.

Its only deviation from the norm is having thirteen verses rather than the usual eleven or twelve, by including both Tanūnapāt (vs. 2) and Narāśaṃsa (vs. 3) and by having two svāhā verses at the end (12–13).

The poet begins (vs. 1) by presenting to Agni what he has produced, char-acterized as an evolving product: an “insight. . . the thinking of my speech.” The poet’s concern with his insight returns toward the end (vss. 6–7), where it is hoped that Agni will pursue our speech and promote our insights. In between the hymn touches on many of the standard Agni tropes: for example, the beauty and radiance of the newly kindled fire (vss. 2–3) and its destructive power (vs. 5). It ends (vs. 8) by begging for Agni’s protection.1. I present a stronger, newer insight to Agni, the thinking of my speech to the son of strength,the Child of the Waters, who, together with the good ones [/Vasus], has sat down upon the earth as our dear Hotar at his season.2.

In particular, the middle verses 3–5 concern the pro-duction of fire by the two churning sticks and the growing strength of that fire. The hymn begins, however, with the already fully matured fire, identified as the Hotar, going about his ritual duties (vss. 1–2). The verse immediately after the kindling verses (vs. 6) opens the ritual frame: Agni there is the ruler of the realms of heaven and earth, and he even attracts those divine figures (probably Heaven and Earth, though some have suggested Night and Dawn) from their cosmic positions to take their place on the ritual ground.

A sample of his secret knowledge seems to be given in verse 4, a riddling and, at least for these translators, unsolved depiction of ritual activity. The final verse forms a ring with verse 1.

In verse 1 Agni is seated in the lap of his two parents, in our opinion the fire-churning sticks, though they are not explicitly identified and other interpreters see the two as cosmic entities. (See I.140.3, 141.4, 144.3–4 for other allusions to these sticks in Dīrghatamas’s Agni hymns.) The fire grows in verse 2 and is tended in verse 3.

I will hymn three-headed, seven-reined Agni, who is without deficiency, seated in the lap of his parents [=fire-churning sticks],one (stick) that moves and one that stays firm—(Agni,) who has filled all the luminous realms of heaven.2.

Though it begins in a ritual situation (vs. 1) and the poet commends his ritual speech to Agni in the first half of verse 2, the poet then becomes preoccupied with potential hostilities directed against him by malevolent and dishonest men and how to foil them. He counts upon the protec-tors deployed by Agni (vs. 3), who may well be the flames referred to in verse 1, and more generally assumes that well-performed worship of Agni will enlist that god in his protection.

However, the situation is more fluid and the identity of both friends and enemies is unclear, since the subjects of some crucial actions are not specified and a liberal use of injunctive verb forms blurs the temporal reference.The hymn begins (vs. 1) with an apparent reminiscence of the original mythic theft of fire and its first installation on the ritual ground. The performers of this installation (1c) are not identified, but seem likely to be the gods. Verse 2 presents two inimical but unnamed groups: those who cannot damage Agni but presumably want to (2a) and those who delight in all his actions (2cd). The latter must be the"},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"I.149325performers of the ritual, probably both the current mortal ones and the gods who initiated the sacrifice in verse 1, but the enemies in 2a are defined only by their con-trast with the others. Verse 3 appears to reprise the action of verse 1, but in present time as the regular (re-)installation of the ritual fire for the regular, repeated rites performed by men—given the “leading forward” of 3c, perhaps the removal of the Āhavanīya fire from the Gārhapatya fire and its deposit in the east of the ritual ground.Verse 4 is a thematic intrusion, with a standard description of a wildfire in nature. Verse 5 returns to the topic of 2a: Agni’s invulnerability even when only nascent. A notable feature of verse 5 is the mention of the inability of the blind enemies of Agni to afflict him with the evil eye, given that Dīrghatamas identified himself as blind in the immediately preceding hymn (I.147.3).1. Since with effort Mātariśvan stole him, the Hotar bringing all goods, belonging to all the gods,whom they installed for wonder among the clans of the sons of Manu, dazzling like the sun, far-radiant,2.

This gradual disclosure of the subject of the hymn replicates the way that the fire is slowly and carefully kindled and then emerges from its hiding place, flaming up, when it catches. The kindling is cryptically depicted in verse 2, while the burst of light and energy takes over verse 3. In the final two verses (4–5) he is identified as Hotar, a standard role for Agni, and he is revealed as fully grown, powerful, and a partner in the sacrifice with the mortal worshiper. Thus the hymn reflects Dīrghatamas’s usual preoccupation with the birth of Agni, though it is treated somewhat differently here.1. The lord of the house hastens toward great riches—the forceful one here in the footprint of the forceful good thing.The stones just honor him as he soars near.2.

The poet seems to begin by declaring his allegiance and service to Agni and making his claim for guest-friendship (hence the “stranger” in vs. 1) and pro-tection on that basis. In verse 2 he rejects the patronage of a non-sacrificer, despite his riches, while in verse 3 he returns to the benefits that accrue to the devotee of Agni.1. Performing much ritual service for you, I call myself a stranger (under the protection) of you, o Agni,as if under the protection of the great goad [=sun].2.

The first part is a different story—enigmatic in reference and convoluted in expres-sion. However, it appears to concern the same topic: Mitra and Varuṇa’s presence at and participation in the sacrifice. We can therefore think of the hymn as an example of large-scale “poetic repair,” with the second part rephrasing the first in less con-torted expressions. (On poetic repair see Jamison 2006.)The hymn begins with the birth of Agni, presented both as ritual fire and as formidable god. The first half of verse 1 places the birth at the sacrifice itself, “amid the cows and the waters,” in our opinion referring to the two auxiliary substances necessary for soma preparation, the milk for mixing and the water for rinsing and diluting. But in the second half of the verse the birth causes cosmic consternation, with the two worlds set atremble by his size and his “song,” presumably a reference to the crackling of a blazing fire.Mitra and Varuṇa make their appearance in verse 2, as sacrificial partners of a named soma-offerer; they are brought to the ritual ground and urged to aid the ritual participants. But the theme of birth returns in verse 3. Contrary to most interpretations, we consider the birth in question to be Agni’s birth, treated already in verse 1, not the birth of Mitra and Varuṇa. (The dual pronoun vām in 3a is in Wackernagel’s Position, and we construe it later in the verse, as often.) As in verse 1, humans assist at the birth of the ritual fire, a birth that has cosmic resonances. Mitra and Varuṇa also assist, bringing their skill to bear for the sacrifice (here referred to as “truth” [r̥tá]) and the fire. Their contributions to the sacrifice are also treated in verse 4; the skill mentioned in verse 3 they bring from heaven (4c), while they also make ready the soma-preparing waters mentioned in verse 1 (4d). Soma preparation is also the subject of the next verse (5). The cows (that is, their milk) are depicted turbulently milling around the ritual ground, bellowing at the three times of day associated with soma-pressing—dawn, midday, and sunset. (It should be noted that vs. 5 is the most puzzling verse in the hymn, and our interpretation does not entirely match those of others scholars.) In the first half of verse 6 we return to the ritual fire, kindled in verse 1—or rather to its flames, conceived of as “long-haired females.” (The poet, Dīrghatamas, uses the same image and the same word in I.140.8, where the reference to flames is clearer.)"},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"I.151328As mentioned above, the highly wrought and cryptic treatment of the sacrifice and Mitra and Varuṇa’s place in it is succeeded, starting with the second half of verse 6, by a fairly uncomplex restatement of the major themes.1.

The hymn provides a number of examples on which to test this advice.The power of formulated truth and the frequent opacity of its verbal form are both treated early in the hymn. In the first verses the poet affirms the close associa-tion of Mitra and Varuṇa with truth and their power to defeat untruth (see 1cd, also indirectly 3d), while in both 2a and 3b he questions the ability of ordinary people to comprehend. The object of the comprehension is left undefined (“this,” 2a; “that,” 3b), but in our opinion it is the formulation, or the “truth,” or the speech of the gods and/or poets. He then implies that whether or not we comprehend is immate-rial, for mantras proclaimed by poets come true (2b) regardless of whether or not they were understood by their hearers.Verse 3 seems to contain a few test formulations (3a, 3c) and comments on them (3b, 3d). The formulations are constructed as paradoxes: the footless one who is first of the footed (3a); the embryo who carries its own burden, contravening the usual expectation that the embryo is the burden that the mother bears (see, e.g., III.46.5, VI.67.4, X.27.16). The next three verses (4–6) concern the familiar myster-ies of the ritual day: the rising of the sun following the dawns (vss. 4–5) and the flaring up of the fire fueled by streams of melted butter (vs. 6). These predictable daily occurrences are implicitly identified as conforming to “the ordinance of Mitra and Varuṇa” (vss. 4d, 5d).The final verse is a simple invitation to the sacrifice with prayers for the gods’ aid.1. You two wear garments of fat; your counsels are unbroken torrents.You have brought low all untruths; you keep company with truth.2. Many a one will not comprehend this (formulation?) of theirs, (but) the virile mantra, proclaimed by poets, comes true.The mighty four-edged (weapon) smites one with three edges; the scorners of the gods were the first to waste away.3. “Footless she [=Dawn] goes as the first of the footed.” Who comprehends that (formulation?) of yours, o Mitra and Varuṇa?"},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"I.153330“The unborn child bears his burden even here.” He guides the truth across; he has brought down untruth.4.

The focus of the hymn is narrow: the three strides made by Viṣṇu, which measured out the cos-mic spaces, earth, midspace, and heaven, and provided room for the creatures to live. These strides are also conceived of as footsteps, which contain the good things sought by the poet, and which he aspires to reach (vss. 5–6). This goal provides a forward thrust to the poem, despite the uniformity of the vocabulary throughout. Viṣṇu ’s footsteps are also credited with somewhat surprising actions: in verse 4 they “find ela-tion by their own power” and in verse 6 the highest step “shines down amply.”1. Now shall I proclaim the heroic deeds of Viṣṇu, who measured out the earthly realms,who propped up the higher seat, having stridden out three times, the wide-ranging one.2. In this way Viṣṇu will be praised for his heroic deed—(he who is) like a fearsome wild beast, living in the mountains and roaming wherever it wants,in whose three wide strides dwell all living beings.3. Let my fortifying thought go forth to Viṣṇu, the mountain-dwelling, wide-ranging bull,who alone with just three steps measured out this dwelling place here, long and extended,4. Whose three steps, filled with honey, never becoming depleted, find elation through their own power,who alone supports heaven and earth in their three parts and all living beings.5. Might I reach that dear cattle-pen of his, where men seeking the gods find elation,for exactly that is the bond to the wide-striding one: the wellspring of honey in the highest step of Viṣṇu.6.

The beginning seems to offer alternative sce-narios for the creation of the wide space that is ordinarily attributed to Viṣṇu’s three strides. In verse 1 the two gods standing on the back of the mountains seem to enlarge the space, and in verse 2 their clash (presumably with unnamed enemies) creates breathing room, while they also deflect the arrow of the archer Kr̥śānu, whose presence here is not explained. (Kr̥śānu is best known as the archer who shoots at the falcon that steals the soma from heaven; cf. IV.27.3, IX.77.2.)The first half of verse 3 showcases two contrastive pairs: unspecified females (possibly hymns?) who strengthen his masculine nature, and (by implication) a son who induces his two mothers (Heaven and Earth?) to enjoy the semen. The para-doxical quality of these actions is clear, but the exact contents are not. The second half of the verse introduces the “three” so characteristic of Viṣṇu, though used of names, not strides; nonetheless, the same expansion of space, into highest heaven, seems to be at issue. Verse 4 seems almost like a “repair” of verse 3: it is clear in 4a who is tending to “his great masculine nature” (unlike 3a), and in the second half we have the familiar three strides, not three names. Verse 5 continues the theme of the three strides, while a different numerological topic, the year, closes the hymn (vs. 6).The paired verses 3 and 4, with their mysteries and paradoxes, appear to consti-tute an omphalos.1. Announce in chant the drink from the stalk to the great champion who exercises insight [=Indra] and to Viṣṇu,the two undeceivable ones who stand on the back of the mountains mightily like (riders) on a steed heading straight to the goal.2.

Instead, he is presented as a protean divinity, likened to or identified with a number of other gods, especially Agni. This superimposition begins with the first pāda of verse 1, where he is compared to Mitra, and in verse 2b the association with the Wives of the Gods immediately brings Tvaṣṭar to mind. In verse 4d he is identified either with Indra/Br̥haspati or with an Aṅgiras in the allusion to the Vala myth, and earlier in that verse (pāda b) “the ritual expert associated with the Maruts” may be a reference to Indra, who may be called “ritual expert of the Maruts” (vedho marútām) in I.169.1. But the primary association appears to be with Agni. The title “ritual expert,” though used of other gods (like Indra, see above), is especially characteristic of Agni, and the references to Viṣṇu as embryo and to his birth (vss. 2–3) are typical Agni themes (compare 3b especially with VI.48.5, of the birth of Agni). The “three seats” in verse 5 also recalls Agni with his three hearths, and this word may in fact signal the point of contact between Viṣṇu and Agni, since “three” is the number that defines Viṣṇu’s great deed, and the “three seats” could be the three footprints left by his strides. (See the footprints as places in I.154.4–6.)The theme of Viṣṇu’s multiple identities is announced, in typically oblique fashion, in the middle verse of this hymn: “recognizing him, announce his very names” (3c).1. Become kindly like an ally [/Mitra]—you with ghee as your drink, traveling your ways, extensive and having far-reaching brilliance.Then for you, o Viṣṇu, praise can be brought to success only by one who knows, and sacrifice can be made to succeed by one who offers an oblation.2.

Less typical but elsewhere attested (e.g., VIII.5) is its implicit representation of the Aśvins as bringers of rain. This theme is most obvi-ous in verse 2, for in 2b ukṣatam, translated “increase,” is a śleṣa, to be read also as “sprinkle.” The “ghee and honey” by which the Aśvins bring increase to the dominion are the rain they sprinkle on it. If “honey” refers to rain in verse 2, then so also do their “honey-bearing chariot” (vs. 3) and their “honeyed whip” (vs. 4). At least here the latter probably refers to lightning (Pirart 1995: 296, with reference to Blair 1961: 152–54). The rain they bring is fertilizing for all beings, both animals and plants (vs. 5). Likewise, the description of the Aśvins’ sending fire and water into the trees (vs. 6) refers to the water, which not only allows the trees to grow but also carries fire that emerges when wood is kindled.The theme of the Aśvins as bringers of rain is interwoven with that of their chariot as a reflection of the sacrifice. The sets of three often associated with them and their chariot refer to the three soma-pressings (cf. also I.34). Here, significantly, in verse 3 their chariot has three wheels and three chariot boxes. And finally, the Aśvins are not only bringers of rain, but they are also bringers of healing (4cd, 6). These two functions are connected because they both give and extend life.One last note: in verse 6 rā́thyebhiḥ “through the parts of your chariot” is a hapax and there are several other plausible interpretations of it: among them the chariot-horses (Sāyaṇa), chariot-skills (Geldner), and reins (Pirart). Since the hymn mentions the chariot itself and its boxes, wheels, whip, and horses, we sug-gest that the word encompasses all those things that constitute the chariot—and therefore the rain and the sacrifice—and that complement the healing remedies they bring."},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"I.1583351.

The best starting point may be the final verse, in which the poet describes himself as old, but nevertheless as the “chariot-driver” of the waters and a “formulator (of the truth).” He is still a poet and a powerful one at that. The problem the hymn addresses, therefore, could be an attempt by the poet’s patrons or fellow poets to retire him, and therefore he calls upon the Aśvins to help him show his mettle as a poet. One of the wondrous acts of the Aśvins is to rejuvenate, and therefore it is not surprising that he would turn to them.Even if this is the right approach to the hymn, a fair number of difficulties remain. In verse 2 the poet asks who will serve the Aśvins, if not he, so that the two gods will take their place “in the track of the cow.” As often elsewhere, the cow is the inspired hymn, and therefore the “track of the cow” should be the place of the sacrifice, where the inspired hymn is recited. In praising the Aśvins"},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"I.158336the poet alludes to the two gods’ great deeds of rescue, which turn on the theme of water. In verse 3 the poet mentions the story of Bhujyu, who was rescued from the water by the Aśvins. In verse 5 is the story of a man whom Dāsas bound and tossed into the rivers. The story is unknown, but presumably that person was also rescued from the waters. These rescues anticipate the poet’s final claim in verse 6 to be the master of the waters. The significance of this is not clear, but it may mean that he can bring the rain through the power of his recitations and rituals. These stories of drowning, of too much water, also contrast to the poet’s plea in verse 4 not to be dried out by time and not to be burnt up, as if he were like kindling. Despite his age the poet is and wishes to remain vital, not to become a dried-out old stick of a man.The Br̥haddevatā (IV.21–25) presents the story or stories mentioned in verse 5 as the story of Dīrghatamas himself. According to it, his slaves (dāsas) tied up the old, blind Dīrghatamas and immersed him in the waters of the river. One of them, called Traitana, tried to strike him with sword, but ended up cutting to pieces his own head, shoulders, and chest. Eventually Dīrghatamas washed up near the country of the Aṅgas, where he was rescued. Later he had a son, Kakṣīvant, by a servant of the king. It is unlikely that this is the story known to the R̥gveda or even that verse 5 tells the story of Dīrghatamas, unless metaphorically. Still, the reference to the Dāsas seems to be of particular significance. The earlier part of the hymn develops a repetitive phonological pattern with daśasya﻿́tam (1b), da﻿́srā (1c), dāśat (2a), and da﻿́śatayaḥ (4c). These words, most of which have a marked position in the pāda, seem to lead toward the story of the Dāsas. These Dāsas did try to destroy someone but ended up destroying themselves, and perhaps this is the message that the poet wishes to impress upon those who are trying to push him aside.1. You two Vasus, Rudras, who give many counsels, strengthening (our praise) in preeminence—favor us, o bulls,since the son of Ucathya [=Dīrghatamas] is the legacy (left) for you, wondrous ones, since you two have run forth (to him) with unstinting help.2. Who will serve you two for this very favor, when, Vasus, by his homage you two will take your place in the track of the cow?Awaken for us plentiful gifts filled with riches, acting as if with a thought to fulfill our wishes.3. Because your harnessed (chariot)—swelling, rugged—was set apart in the middle of the flood for the son of Tugra [=Bhujyu],I would come to your sheltering help by flying ways, as a hero (flies) his course.4. The praise song should give wide space to (me), the son of Ucathya.

The two are named in the first and last (5) verses of the hymn, while in between they are only referred to by kinship terms. In the first half of verse 2 their parental roles are kept separate: father and mother, but in the second half they are subsumed in a pregnant dual, “two fathers.” The tables are turned in verse 3, where they appear as “two mothers.” Although both of these duals are frequently used in the R̥gveda for the paired parents of both genders (and such is their reference here), the alternation in this hymn seems meaningful and contextually appropriate. Minds are not associated with either gender exclusively, so that “the mind of the. . . father and of the mother” in verse 2ab belongs to each individually, whereas in 2c it is, properly, two fathers who “possess good semen.” The reason for the feminine “two mothers” in verse 3 is less clear, though as objects acted upon they may evoke the feminine. After these various parental designations, the poet branches out in verse 4b, identifying the two as both siblings and a married couple, with a subtle but unmistakable sug-gestion of incest.In the meantime, the beloved paradox of children giving birth to their parents is given full play in verses 3 and 4.As discussed in the introduction to I.160, this hymn is a virtual twin to the one that follows.1. I shall start up the praise, along with sacrifices, to Heaven and to Earth, the two great ones growing strong through truth, the discerning ones, at the rites of distribution,those of wondrous power, whose sons are gods, who together with the gods tender things of value (to the mortal) who has an insight right to the point."},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"I.1603382.

Like 159, 160 names Heaven and Earth only in its first and last verses, with the references in between conveyed by kinship terms and adjectival duals, patterning in much the same way as in 159—first separate designations for father and mother (159.2ab, 160.2b), then duals identifying the pair with one gender or another (“two fathers” 159.2c, “two mothers” 159.3b versus “two world-halves/rodasī” [fem., depicted as girls] 160.2c, “two fathers” 160.3a).One of the notable features of 159 is the relationship between Heaven and Earth and their sons, the gods. The same parental relationship is depicted in 160, but with a single son, the Sun. As in 159, this son is first introduced in verse 1, but also as in 159 the theme is developed primarily in verses 3–4, where the same paradox of the child begetting his parents is employed (esp. in 160.4, but note the child milking out his own milk from his parents in vs. 3). Similar or identical words are used: the son in 160.4a is “the best artisan of the artisans (apás) of the gods,” while the sons in 159.3a are “good artisans” (svápas); the two fathers of 159.2c “possess good semen” (surétas), just as the bull representing Heaven does in 160.3c. Two verbs are used to express the sons’/son’s begetting of the parents: the literal √jan “beget” (jajñuḥ"},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"I.161339159.3b, jajā́na 160.4b) and the metaphorical √mā “measure out” (mamire 159.4a, ví. . . mamé 160.4c); both the sons of 159 and the son of 160 possess magical power (māyínaḥ 159.4a, māyáyā 160.3b).Once seen, the pervasive underlying identity of these two hymns cannot be denied, but it is an index of the art of Dīrghatamas that the poems strike the audience as com-pletely distinct and that, as far as we are aware, their patterned similarity has not previ-ously been recognized—unlike other such pairs, like the Vālakhilya hymns VIII.49–50, 51–52, or IV.13–14, IX.104–105, as discussed by Bloomfield (1916: 13–14).1.

While being sung, o great ones, you will establish great fame for us and lofty dominion, o Heaven and Earth,by which we will extend (our control) over the communities all the days. Jointly impel to us power worthy of wonder.I.161 R̥bhusDīrghatamas Aucathya14 verses: jagatī 1–13, triṣṭubh 14This is a difficult hymn, but one essential for understanding the R̥bhus and their relation to the Third Pressing. Its narrative tells how the R̥bhus attained immortal-ity and entered among the gods—or seems to. This theme is stated in verse 2 and elaborated in verses 11–14. The R̥bhus were priests who attained status as gods by their sacrificial performance. As gods they are worshiped in the Third Pressing, and therefore it is not surprising that the ritual acts by which they became gods are those"},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"I.161340of the Third Pressing. For a detailed discussion of these acts, see the discussion by Brereton (2012).The hymn begins by reference to one of the great acts of the R̥bhus, their trans-formation of a single soma cup into four soma cups. This act signifies their divin-ization because the four cups represent four soma offerings to Indra and the three R̥bhus. A single cup would have restricted the soma offering only to Indra. The hymn opens with the R̥bhus’ address to Agni, who has been sent by the gods. This dialogue takes place in the middle of the action, for apparently Agni has pointed to the camasa﻿́, the ritual soma cup, and the R̥bhus are concerned that Agni thinks that they have insulted this soma cup in some way (vs. 1). But Agni reaffirms the command of the gods that the R̥bhus create four cups out of this one, and he offers to make them gods (vs. 2). However, the R̥bhus reply that they have much more to do as priests before they themselves become the objects of worship. First, they need to make a horse. Elsewhere they fashion the two horses of Indra, and it is to this act that verse 3 likely refers. The making of these horses points toward the Hāriyojanagraha, an offering to Indra as he harnesses his horses to leave the ritual ground at the end of the Third Pressing (see also I.61–63, 82). Second, they need to make a chariot, which can represent the hymn or the whole ritual. Third, they need to make a milk-cow, which represents the already-pressed soma stalks, which are made to yield additional soma in the Third Pressing. And finally they need to make young two who are old. The two might be the sacrificer and his wife or another pair. Once the R̥bhus have accomplished all their great sac-rificial deeds, then they will be worthy to follow Agni to heaven (vs. 3). Tvaṣṭar is introduced in verse 4 probably in connection with another rite in the Third Pressing in which the Wife of the Sacrificer receives indirect access to the soma. Verse 5 returns to the four cups and we now learn that Tvaṣṭar, who had origi-nally made the one cup, is angry that the R̥bhus are modifying his creation. The R̥bhus protect themselves by taking on “other names.” These “other names” may be their priestly offices, and by these names or priestly offices the “maiden” will rescue them. The hymn gives little clue to identity of the “maiden,” but she may be Sarasvatī (cf. VI.49.7) or even Speech (Vāc) herself. In either case, the words that the R̥bhus master or the knowledge that they possess somehow protects them from the anger of Tvaṣṭar. Vs. 6 affirms that the R̥bhus did succeed in becoming gods and divine recipients of soma.In verse 7 the hymn returns to the sacrificial acts that made them immortal: the soma-pressing (see vs. 10), the rejuvenation of the aging pair, the creation of a horse, and the harnessing of the chariot that is the sacrifice or the hymn. Verse 8 marks a return to a dialogue, now between the R̥bhus and the gods. According to Sāyaṇa, the “water” and the “rinse-water of muñja-reeds” that the gods offer the R̥bhus are the soma of the first two pressings. This interpretation is contextually justifiable, but such a denigration of these first two pressings is unlikely. Oldenberg suggests that the gods first offer the R̥bhus two inferior drinks and only then and finally the soma. If we take this approach, the first offering would be water, and"},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"I.161341the second might be a kind of faux-soma. The word múñja approximates mū́javant, the mountain from which the real soma comes, and therefore the “rinse-water of muñja-reeds” may represent an inferior approximation of soma. It is only the third time and in the third soma-pressing that the gods offer the R̥bhus the real soma. Structurally verse 9 continues verse 8, since again three things are mentioned, of which the third is the best. However, it is difficult to say what the feminine noun described as vadharya﻿́ntī “weapon-wielding” in pāda c might be, since the adjec-tive is otherwise unattested. According to Sāyaṇa, it is either the earth or a line of clouds and its weapon is lightning. Along similar lines, Geldner suggests that it is the rainy season and again that its weapon is lightning. Interpreting vadharya﻿́ntī slightly differently, Witzel and Gotō understand it as the axe (sva﻿́dhiti) “serving as a weapon.” We resolve the ellipsis by drawing its sense from the verb pra √brū “proclaim” in pāda c and the reference to spoken truths in pāda d. The first two R̥bhus praise water and fire, which are essential to the sacrifice, but the third R̥bhu recognizes true speech as the most essential element.Verse 10 returns once again to the great sacrificial deeds of the R̥bhus and this time especially to the soma that is prepared in the Third Pressing. In the Third Pressing soma stalks from the first two pressings are pressed again to yield addi-tional soma. In verse 10 these stalks are the “lame cow”—lame because they have already been pressed—which are then soaked in water. The “carving” of the cow is the re-pressing of the stalks, and the dung is the now thoroughly mangled stems of the soma plant. The place of 10d is not clear. Whoever the “parents” may be, the “sons” are likely the R̥bhus or the priests that they represent.The last sequence of verses, 11–14, probably describes the ascent of the R̥bhus to immortality, but even if this is correct, the details are obscure. At best we can point out a few possible identifications and a few possible interpretations. Agohya in verse 11 is probably the Sun as the “Unconcealable One,” although he might also be Savitar. In I.110.2–3 the R̥bhus’ attainment of immortality is connected with Agohya, and if Agohya is the Sun, then perhaps one stage in the R̥bhus’ ascent is to the sun. The Sun governs the year, and therefore the “grass on the heights” may rep-resent the summer pasturage, and “the waters in the valleys” the winter pasturage. In verse 13 the identification of the goat and the dog as the sun and moon is doubt-ful. It assumes that the basta﻿́ “goat” is aja﻿́ ekapa﻿́d, “the one-footed goat,” which elsewhere is the Sun. The identification of the moon as “the dog” follows Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa XI.1.5.1, in which the moon is called the heavenly dog. In the last verse, the gods move throughout the visible world seeking the R̥bhus, but perhaps they do not find them because they have gone from the visible world.1. [The R̥bhus:] “Why has the best, why has the youngest one come here to us? For what messenger’s duty does he speed? What is it that we have said?We have not insulted the cup with its great hollow.

The hymn begins with the parading of the horse on the day of sacrifice: the year-long preliminaries in the classical Aśvamedha are not mentioned here, and it is not easy to tell how much elaboration accreted to this ritual in the post-R̥gvedic period—though it seems likely that the R̥gvedic version was a much simpler affair.After an initial verse calling on an array of gods to bear witness to the celebra-tion of the horse, there follow three verses (2–4) devoted to the goat that is led in front of the horse and that is itself sacrificed before the killing of the horse. The goat is the only sacrificial animal mentioned in the hymn besides the horse, in contrast to the classical version of the rite in which a multitude of wild and domestic animals are, at least theoretically, bound for sacrifice (and in general then released). In verses 5–6 a variety of priests (5) and minor ritual functionaries (6; see also the cooks in vs. 12) are mentioned—the priests being urged, somewhat shockingly, to “fill your bellies” on the sacrifice. This group of officiants seems to correspond on the human level to the gods assembled in verse 1, and all are thus implicated in the performance of the sacrifice, as are the poet himself and his fel-low seers in verse 7.The gaze then turns to the sacrifice proper (vss. 8–17) and to the equipment asso-ciated with the horse (vss. 8, 14, 16), the equipment for cooking the oblation (vs. 13), and, most dramatically, the physical evidence of the slaughter: the fly-blown flesh and the sticky blood and guts (vs. 9), the bloated belly and the smell of the butchered animal (vs. 10), the cooking juices running off the skewered beast on"},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"I.162344the fire (vs. 11). All of the mentioned paraphernalia and the gore are meant to accompany the horse itself to the gods. This section of the hymn gains much of its power from a dual focus: the gritty reality of an actual sacrifice competes with the reverential attitude to the victim, regularly addressed in the 2nd person—such that the horse is endowed almost with personhood while at the same time being dismem-bered, cooked, and consumed. For this reason, in 3rd-person contexts we use the pronouns “he, him, his” for the horse, rather than “it,” et cetera: the poet will not allow us to objectify or neuter-ize the animal and requires us to come to terms with what “we” are doing to “him.”The description of the dismembering becomes more detailed beginning in verse 18, where the axe approaches the horse’s ribs. Although this carving up logically precedes some of the sacrificial actions treated before—especially the cooking of the already butchered horse—there is a reason for its positioning here. We are entering the third and last part of the hymn, in which the horse is sent on his journey to the gods. The emphasis in these carving verses (18–20) is on the proper order of the cut-ting and the patterned positioning of the pieces of the horse, so that he can make its own way on his “undamaged” legs (vss. 18, 20). The pieces of the horse are arranged to re-form the actual body of the horse, and this reconstituted body is complemented by the lifebreath (ātman) that is also making the journey to the gods (vs. 20). The climax is reached in verse 21, where the horse is assured that he is not dead or injured and that his journey to the gods will be made easily, in company with the mounts of the gods. The hymn ends (vs. 22) with the hope that the sacrificed horse will bring us good things, and with an unemphatic prayer for our “guiltlessness,” presumably because of the potential guilt associated with the killing of the horse.To those who know the classical śrauta version of the Aśvamedha the most strik-ing omission in this hymn is any mention of the sexual intercourse (or simulated inter-course) of the chief wife of the king and sacrificer with the just slaughtered horse. If our interpretation of X.86, the Vr̥ṣākapi hymn, is correct—that it is a burlesqued ver-sion of an Aśvamedha with a randy monkey as victim—the missing sexual element in our hymn here was omitted out of delicacy rather than being unknown to the R̥gveda.1.

In fact, this hymn can be taken as the concrete fulfillment of the announcement in the first"},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"I.163347verse of the prior hymn (I.162.1): “. . . when we shall proclaim the heroic deeds of the. . . horse.” That hymn did not itself actually accomplish this claim, for there was no real praise of the horse or what he did. But this hymn has all the trappings of a proper praise hymn. It begins with a number of verses (vss. 1–4) about the miraculous birth and mythic history of the horse and its cosmic connections and divine identifications.In our opinion, the rest of the hymn concerns the horse’s journey to heaven, the very journey presented also at the end of 162 (esp. vs. 21). But this is now no ordinary horse: he is now identified with the sun and described in exalted and enigmatic language. After a brief mention of the horse tackle in verse 5, the journey begins in verse 6. That the traveler is the sacrificed horse is strongly suggested by the language, which connects it to the horse’s journey in 162: the poet mentally sees the lifebreath (ātman) as it flies, reminding us of the horse’s lifebreath in 162.20, and this lifebreath as bird is moving on “paths easy to travel,” the same phrase spoken reassuringly to the horse in 162.21. With the identification of the sacrificed horse with the sun-bird thus firmly established, the poet is free to elaborate and complicate his mental vision of the journey in the following verses (7–11), not all of which are entirely clear. The poet’s vision also seems to identify the horse/sun-bird with poetic inspiration, in phraseology that is reminiscent of the “Pataṃga” hymn (X.177), where poetic inspiration takes the form of a bird.As this lyrical passage comes toward its end, the figure of the horse reasserts itself, and the connections to 162 become stronger again. In the much-discussed verse 10, in our opinion the arrangement of the divine horses, compared to the V-shaped formation of geese in flight, refers to the divine mounts that accompany the sacrificed horse in 162.21. Verse 11 addresses the horse as it flies in the guise of the sun-bird, but we return to the real world of the sacrifice in verse 12, which in ring-compositional fashion picks up the procession of goat and horse to slaughter that began 162, reprising some of the language of that hymn as well (úpa prā́gāt “has gone forth” in 163.12–13 and 162.7; puro﻿́ nīyate “is led in front” in 163.12 and 162.3). The summary verse (13) sends the horse on his way and again expresses hopes for a return on our sacrificial investment.1. When you whinnied on first being born, rising from the sea or from the fertile soil,(having) the two wings of a falcon, the two forelegs of an antelope—your great birth was worthy of praise, o steed.2.

Such diversity creates the impression that this hymn is a fairly loose assemblage, although its thematic and structural programs indicate that the hymn, or the bulk of it, constitutes a coherent composition. Among the more recent and significant studies of the hymn are those of Brown (1968) and Houben (2000), which also discuss older interpretations and upon which we have drawn extensively and gratefully.The hymn has continued to attract scholarly attention in part because it has continued to escape satisfying interpretation. One reason is that the hymn was com-posed to be enigmatic, to be never fully decipherable. But even if we will never be able to solve all its puzzles, we can appreciate how it functions as an enigma and perhaps why. Since the hymn makes both implicit and explicit reference to Vedic rit-ual, including rites other than the soma ritual, one way into the hymn is through its connections to ritual. Even though the later ritual application of R̥gvedic hymns is not always a reliable guide to their original ritual contexts, it offers a place to start. According to Aitareya Āraṇyaka V.3.2, verses 1–41 are part of the Vaiśvadevaśastra, a recitation at the midday offerings of the Mahāvrata ceremony, and Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka II.18 places the whole of the hymn in the Mahāvrata rite. This Mahāvrata rite is a variation of the Agniṣṭoma soma ritual that was performed on the next to last day of the year-long Gavāmayana rite. It may well be that the application of the hymn in the Mahāvrata rite is secondary (Houben 2000: 502), since there is no explicit reference to the Mahāvrata in the hymn and, for such a long hymn, little even to the soma sacrifice more generally. But there is a thematic connection between this hymn and the Mahāvrata. According to Kauṣītakī Brāhmaṇa XIX.3, the Mahāvrata fell on the winter solstice. Whatever else I.164 may be about, much of it concerns the sun in one way or another (e.g., vss. 2, 7, 8, 10, 11, 14, 25, 33, 44, 46, 48). The winter solstice, when the sun has halted its southward movement and is about to turn northward, would be a natural time to consider the sun and its appearance and therefore may provide the seasonal context for the hymn.A second ritual context for the hymn is the Pravargya rite, which is an offering of heated milk and ghee to the Aśvins. In the classical Agniṣṭoma soma ritual, the Pravargya was performed twice daily on the three days leading up the soma-pressing day; originally, however, it may have been a rite independent of the soma ritual. The śrautasūtras (cf. van Buitenen 1968: 93, 96–98) prescribe the recitation of verses 26–28, 31 (=X.177.3), and 49 in the Pravargya, and at least verses 26–29 refer"},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":"I.164350directly to the Pravargya rite. Thus, as Houben (2000) has demonstrated, significant parts of this hymn are concerned with the Pravargya.These two rituals, the Mahāvrata and the Pravargya, have one thing in com-mon: they are the principal subjects of Āraṇyaka texts. The Āraṇyakas or “for-est” books are later Vedic works that explored rituals and the interpretations of rituals thought to be too dangerous to be taught within the village. The R̥gvedic Āraṇyakas concern especially the Mahāvrata rite, and the Yajurvedic Āraṇyakas, the Pravargya. In our view this hymn was not primarily composed for recitation in a particular rite, although to be sure some of its mantras were ritually employed. Rather, this poem is an early example of Āraṇyaka-like interpretation. Its function is to disclose the meaning of the rites, particularly the Mahāvrata and Pravargya rites. It might seem odd that a R̥gvedic hymn could anticipate the later Āraṇyaka literature. However, according to the Śāṅkhāyana Gṛhya Sūtra II.11.13, once a stu-dent has learned the saṃhitā, his teacher may guide him though the rahasya, the secret teaching, which the sūtra defines as the Āraṇyaka (cf. Oldenberg 1888: 291). Even if, as Oldenberg (293) argues, study of the rahasya meant the recitation of the mantras of the Mahāvrata, not study of the interpretation of the rite, the sūtra still points toward a direct pathway between the R̥gveda and the study that eventually came to constitute the R̥gvedic Āraṇyakas.Key to grasping the meaning of the ritual is understanding the links between ritual acts and both the cosmos and the person. The complexity of the hymn derives especially from the multiplicity of reference of its verses, which connect ritual, cosmos, and person. Thus, the verses frequently refer simultaneously to the ritual (adhiyajñam) and to the world (adhidevatam), especially to the sun, and sometimes also to the human body or the human being (adhyātmam). There is no unproblematic verse in this hymn, but as an example, consider the possibilities of the first verse. Lines abc of that verse describe three brothers: the gray Hotar, the ravenous middle brother, and the brother with ghee-smeared back. Scholars have offered a variety of identifications for the brothers: the sun, wind, and fire (Sāyaṇa); the Āhavanīya or offering fire, the Dakṣiṇa or southern fire, and the Gārhapatya or household fire (Geldner); the original form of Agni, lightning, and the terres-trial Agni (Brown); and the sun, lightning, and the fire heating the Pravargya pot (Houben). It is likely that ancient hearers of the hymn made not one but several of these sets of identifications. In our view the verse has both a ritual (adhiyajñam) and a cosmic (adhidevatam) meaning. On the one hand, the three brothers can be a triad of ritual fires—either the three that Geldner sees or perhaps three phases of the sacrificial fire (gray embers, flaming fire, and fire flaring as it receives ghee). But they can also be a triad of cosmic fires (perhaps the sun, moon, and earthly fire, which correspond to the three ritual fires, or another of the identifications proposed above). In 1d the clanlord and his seven sons refer primarily to the sacrificer and the seven priests (cf. II.1.2). But the sacrificer might also be embodied in the Sun and the seven priests in Agni, or the clanlord might be the Sun and his seven sons, the stars of the constellation of the Seven Seers, Ursa Major. We will never know which of"},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":"I.164351these or what other interpretations the poet intended, but it is likely that the verse operates on several levels that connect ritual and cosmos.The brief exegetical possibilities we have provided in the translation at best sug-gest primary referents, even though other secondary identifications may also be implied. So, for example, verses 2 and 3 move back and forth between adhiyajñam and adhidevatam meanings. The “seven” in 2a appear to be the “seven” of 1d, who are primarily priests (an adhiyajñam interpretation). However, the “single wheel” in 2a suggests the sun (adhidevatam) more than the ritual fire. This interpretation is supported by verse 48, since there the single wheel is the disk of the sun, which is drawn by the “single horse,” Etaśa, the horse that pulls the Sun’s chariot. In verse 3 the poet foregrounds ritual referents: the seven may again be priests, and, as is often the case, the chariot has now become a symbol of the sacrifice itself.Another characteristic of this hymn, and another reason for its obscurity, is its fre-quent use of word play. The poet favors words that are not etymologically or semanti-cally related but that sound as if they ought to be. For example, in verse 13d sanā́d “from of old” is echoed by sa﻿́nābhiḥ “along with its nave” and in 14a sa﻿́nemi “along with its felly.” Or again, in 14a ví vāvr̥ta “has turned away” anticipates 14c ā́vr̥tam “covered over.” In verse 5 aja﻿́ “unborn” can also mean “goat,” and therefore can sug-gest Aja Ekapad, the “One-Footed Goat,” a symbol of the Sun. According to Thieme (1987: 338), the poet even uses an implied homophone in verse 16. The stars of the constellation called “the Kr̥ttikās” are envisioned as women. The word for “women” in pāda a is stríyaḥ from the stem strī́. There is also a closely homophonous mascu-line stem stŕ̥ “star,” which does not occur in the verse but which would have been known to its hearers. The poet is saying that although the Kr̥ttikās are strī́ “women,” people call its constituents stŕ̥ “stars,” and therefore they speak of those Kr̥ttikās, even though they are women, as masculine “stars.” As the verse concludes, only a poet who a master of words would understand this, and a poet who does understand it becomes even greater than his father, who would likely have been his teacher.Thematic continuities and repeated use of similar poetic devices help unify the hymn. The hymn is also unified by its recursive structure created by parallelisms in its beginning and conclusion. For example, the poet speaks of the One (e﻿́ka) in verse 6 and again toward the end of the hymn, in verse 46. In verse 6 that which is the “One” assumes the form of the Sun. At the other end of the poem, in verse 46, the One reappears and, through speech, takes the form not only of the Sun, but also of Agni, of Mātariśvan (the fire-bringer), and of other deities as well. Verses 7cd and 47 (as well as verse 51) describe the course of the waters upward by means of the rays of the sun and then downward as rain. Verses 2–3 and verse 48 describe the Sun’s chariot and especially its single wheel. The final verses, 49–52, form an independent recursive unit. Verses 49 and 52 concern respectively the femi-nine Sarasvatī, the river goddess, and the masculine Sarasvant, who is Agni and the Sun according to 52ab. The linkage of fire and water or sun and rain is a constant throughout the hymn. It is reasserted in the verses fitted between those to Sarasvatī and Sarasvant. Verse 51 describes the cycle of the water to heaven and then back"},{"pageNumber":369,"pageContent":"I.164352down to earth and the correspondence between the sacrificial fire that invigorates the gods in heaven and the rain that invigorates the earth. Verse 50, which is quoted from X.90.16, refers to the cycle of the sacrifice, which like the water cycle oper-ates between heaven and earth. The sacrifice has its origins in heaven, but it is now performed on earth and directed back toward heaven. Such formal devices help maintain a sense of coherence in a hymn that covers substantial ritual and thematic territory.We do not propose to discuss the verses of the hymn in detail, but we do want to provide some additional information and to illustrate especially the movement in this hymn between different levels of meaning. Verse 8 refers to the story of Dawn’s incest with her father, who is sometimes the Sun and sometimes Heaven. Depending on which of the two is her father—and either is possible in this verse—Dawn’s child might be the Sun or Agni, the ritual fire. Verse 14 describes the movement of the Sun, but here it is its movement at night, when its bright side is turned away from earth and it moves from the west to the east. Verse 15 continues the description of the night (cf. Thieme 1987). The seven who are born at the same time might be the seven stars of the constellation of the Seven Seers. Of these stars six are paired (15b) and one is single (η Ursae Majoris).In verses 20–22 is the famous riddle of the tree that has continued to remain a puzzle. The two birds have been interpreted as the waxing and waning moon (Thieme 1949: 55–73) the moon and the sun (Kuiper 1970: 127–28), the sun and the gharma pot (Houben 2000: 520–22), and two seekers of knowledge (Geldner). Whatever the birds may be, the verse ultimately concerns the acquisition of knowl-edge or inspiration, the “sweet fig” (vs. 22) at the top of the tree. Given the enig-matic character of this hymn, it is not surprising that this knowledge remains out of reach. Following the riddle of the two birds are three verses (23–25) that present the development of ritual speech that perhaps embodies the knowledge represented in the “sweet fig.” According to verse 23 gāyatrī, triṣṭubh, and jagatī lines are extracted from hymns composed in the gāyatrī, triṣṭubh, and jagatī meters. That is to say, the shorter constituent, the poetic line, is drawn from the larger, the whole poem. But then verse 24 begins with the gāyatrī line, which is the basis for the “chant” (arka﻿́), the hymn that is sung, and the chant is the basis of the “melody” (sā́man) on which many verses may be sung. If so, then this verse begins with the shortest constituent, the line, from which develop the longer songs and chants. Similarly, the triṣṭubh line is the basis for longer recitations, śastras in the later tradition. The reason that the verse divides the chant and the recitation between the gāyatrī and triṣṭubh lines is that the eight-syllable gāyatrī line could be used as the basis for chants in the R̥gvedic tradition, while the eleven-syllable triṣṭubh line was used in recitations. Thus in lines ab, reversing verse 23, the shorter (the chanted or recited line) is the basis for the longer (the chant or recitation). This order is continued in c, which moves from individual lines to the complete recitation. In d the shortest con-stituent of all, the syllable, is the basis for the largest constituent, everything that is chanted or recited by the seven priests. This movement from long (the composed"},{"pageNumber":370,"pageContent":"I.164353hymn) to short (the poetic line) to long (chants and recitations), and finally from shortest (the syllable) to longest (everything chanted or recited) knits together the entirety of ritual speech and ultimately concentrates it in the syllable. As such, these two verses anticipate verse 46, in which the “One” is the basis for many names. Verse 25 also presents the smallest constituent as the basis for the larger. According to it the gāyatrī stanza is the foundation for the longer jagatī stanza and the rathantara chant. The gāyatrī verse is the basis of the jagatī, because the jagatī verse has twice the number of syllables as a gāyatrī (48 and 24 respectively). It is the basis of the rathantara chant because the rathantara melody is set to VII.32.22–23, verses in br̥hatī and satobr̥hatī meters. Verses in these two meters are combinations of jagatī and gāyatrī lines. The gāyatrī is thus the foundation of both the jagatī and rathan-tara and as such surpasses both of them.The theme of inspired Speech (Vāc) is taken up again in verses 36–42. It is intro-duced in verses 36 and 37, in which the poet shifts attention to ancient ŕ̥ṣis “seers,” whose “insights” and “thought” are brought into the present by poet. However, the poet does not understand his own inspiration (vs. 37), which is finally a gift of the gods or, more specifically, a gift of Agni. According to verses 39–42, this inspired Speech descends to the human realm like water in order to sustain life on earth. While the emphasis in these verses is on Speech as a cosmic principle and human possession, a specific ritual reference is also not far away. As Geldner observes, verse 40 accompanies I.164.26–27 in Atharvaveda Śaunaka 7.73, a hymn to the gharma drink of the Pravargya rite.In verses 26–29 the hymn focuses on the Pravargya rite. Verse 26 begins with the cow, whose milk will be the offering, and then describes the heating of the gharma pot, into which milk will be poured. In 27a the gharma pot makes a sound hiṅ as it is heated, and because it contains milk, the pot now becomes the cow. Her calf is probably Agni, an identification supported by 28ab, which can describe a pot placed on the fire. In verse 29 the meaning of the cow has shifted again, and she is now the milk “enclosed” within the gharma pot. When milk is poured into the heated pot, a pillar of flame erupts in what is the most dramatic visual moment in the entire soma rite as now performed. In 29cd the milk or the cow thus becomes lightning, exploding upward from the pot. Although the reference to the Pravargya rite is less obvious in verse 30, the verse may refer to the boiling ghee in the gharma pot to which the milk is added (Houben 2000: 510) and therefore to an earlier stage of the ritual than does verse 29. Houben’s interpretation of verse 30 is partly based on the observation that verse 31 is the mantra prescribed by the śrautasūtras for the rite of heating and gazing at the gharma pot, which also belongs to an earlier stage of the ritual. Houben may be correct in seeing a reference to the Pravargya rite, but both verses 30 and 31 are also open to additional interpretations. For example, the “herdsman” in 31a could be the breath (cf. Geldner; also Houben 2000: 508–9) or the Sun (Sāyaṇa) or both.Similarly, Houben (2000: 523) also explains verse 43 as reflecting the Pravargya rite. He understands the “dung-smoke” to be smoke from the fire fueled by horse"},{"pageNumber":371,"pageContent":"I.164354dung that is used to fumigate the gharma pot. The “dappled bullock” could then be the mixture of milk and ghee that is heated in the gharma pot. But again, this verse can be more than a description of the Pravargya. The “first foundations” (pāda d) should refer not just to the beginning of a particular ritual performance, but to the institution of the sacrifice (cf. X.90), and therefore point to an addi-tional interpretation that locates the form and origin of the sacrifice in the cosmos. The “midpoint” (viṣūva﻿́nt) can refer to the Viṣūvant day (as in I.84.10), the sum-mer solstice, which is the ritual midpoint of a year-long sattra ceremony. This sug-gests that the fire beyond the earthly fire is the sun, perhaps wrapped in cloud, the “dung-smoke,” since the solstice should occur around the beginning of the rainy season. The sun can also be the “bullock,” which is “dappled” because of clouds or sunspots. The “heroes” can be priests, but they may also be gods, who are gathered around the sun. All these ritual and macrocosmic interpretations are not exclusive since, according to the Āraṇyakas and Brāhmaṇas, the heated gharma pot can rep-resent the sun (e.g., KauB VIII.3, TĀ V.8–9).In verse 33 the Sun is the likely speaker, although Geldner’s idea that the speaker is the Wind and Breath would maintain the dual reference to cosmos and person. The imagery of these verses appears again in verse 38, in which the subject of lines ab may be the breath (Geldner) or the Sun. The image of the birth of an embryo in verse 33 leads to verses 34–35, which speak of “the navel of the living world” and the “seed” or semen of the horse. These two verses form a brahmodya, a ritual exchange of question and answer, in the Horse Sacrifice (ĀśvŚS X.1–3, ŚāṅkhŚS XVI.6.5–6). The verses are appropriate to the Horse Sacrifice and may have been adopted into this hymn from that sacrifice. Here the verses continue the reference to heaven and earth and to the sacrifice, which becomes the image of the world.1.

Several times in his hymns, however, Agastya refers to himself as Mānya, the son of Māna (e.g., I.165.14–15, 177.5, 184.4). The collection opens with hymns to the Maruts or to Indra and the Maruts (165–173) and hymns to Indra (174–178). Somewhat oddly placed after these is a hymn that takes the form of a dialogue between Agastya and his wife Lopāmudrā (179). Next are hymns to"},{"pageNumber":377,"pageContent":"I.165360the Aśvins (180–184), followed by a series of single hymns, first hymns to Heaven and Earth (185) and to the All Gods (186), then a praise of food (187), an Āprī hymn (188) and an Agni hymn (189), a hymn to Br̥haspati (190), and the concluding hymn of the first maṇḍala, a charm against poisonous animals (191). Like the col-lection of Dīrghatamas, the Agastya hymns thus form an unusual sequence.Also like the Dīrghatamas hymns, the Agastya hymns are stylistically creative, especially in his hymns to Indra and the Maruts. He uses puns and verbal play (e.g., 167), suppression of key words and ambiguous reference (171, 174), intricate simi-les and unexpected turns of phrase (168, 169), syntactic innovation (168, 173, 174), and striking imagery (173, 176). This lively and difficult poetry marks Agastya as one of the great masters of the R̥gvedic tradition. He is best known for three hymns, 165, 170, and 171, which together describe how Indra and the Maruts argued over a sacrifice offered by Agastya and were finally reconciled with one another, and for his dialogue with Lopāmudrā (179), which turns on the tension between the ascetic ideal and the responsibility to continue the family lineage. But both the set of Indra and Marut hymns and the dialogue with Lopāmudrā also concern questions of ritual innovation that define Agastya not only as a great poet but also as a signifi-cant figure in the development of Vedic ritual practice.In all but six of his hymns Agastya concludes with his signature pāda vidyā́meṣáṃ vr̥jánaṃ jīrádānum “May we know refreshment and a community having lively waters.” Also 165–168 share the same final verse, as do 175 and 176, and 183 and 184.I.165 Indra and the MarutsIndra (1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10–12), the Maruts (3, 5, 7, 9), and Agastya (13–15)15 verses: triṣṭubhR̥gveda I.165, 170, and 171 together tell a story in which Indra and the Maruts argue over their rights to a sacrifice offered by the sage Agastya. In the absence of a full, contemporary narrative, it is difficult to reconstruct the events of this story. Apparently Agastya’s sacrifice was originally intended for the Maruts. Indra arrived at the place of the sacrifice first, however, and complained that nothing was being given to him (170). Agastya, frightened by the god (cf. 171.4), then gave the sacri-fice to Indra. At this point the Maruts arrived expecting that the sacrifice would be offered to them. Agastya tried to appease the Maruts (171), who were understandably angry that the sacrifice had gone to Indra. Indra and the Maruts then confront one another (165), and each side asserts its power and worthiness to receive the sacrifice. Ultimately, however, the Maruts concede Indra’s superiority (165.9), and Indra and the Maruts become reconciled with one another (vs. 11) and share the sacrifice. At the very end of the hymn the poet states one of the reasons that he recalls this story: he hopes to be reconciled to the gods, just as the Maruts were reconciled to Indra."},{"pageNumber":378,"pageContent":"I.165361Stanley Insler has proposed the attractive theory that this group of hymns forms a small Aindramāruta epic, whose purpose was to justify a ritual change that occurred during the time of the poet. In the classical Vedic ritual the Midday Pressing is dedicated to Indra along with the Maruts, but for much of the core R̥gveda the Midday Pressing belongs to Indra alone. This narrative tells how the Maruts also came to share the soma along with Indra.In verse 9d we read kariṣyā́ḥ with Oldenberg and others, and in verse 15c we read ’vayā́m, also with Oldenberg.1.

Verse 13 is similarly structured, begin-ning “this is your kinship. . . ,” and the final verse (14) before the refrain sets forth what the poet wishes from the Maruts.Punctuating the hymn is an awareness of the balance between their past glories and benevolence and the ones of the present day (see esp. vss. 1, 8, 13), and the model of their previous generosity to sacrificers is given embodiment in verse 13, where Manu’s offering of poetry induces the Maruts to appear to him with their favors.1.

The first few verses invite first Indra (vs. 1) and then the Maruts (vs. 2) to come to us; the last few verses (8–10) before the refrain (vs. 11) celebrate the massive strength of the Maruts (vss. 8cd–9), and again express the hope that Indra and the Maruts will stand by us (vs. 10), with a curious detour through the topic of the Ādityas’ protective powers (vs. 8ab).But the heart of the hymn (vss. 3–7) is devoted to the Maruts’ relationship with their consort Rodasī, whose name is identical, save for accent, with the dual referring to the “two world-halves” (rodasī́ versus ro﻿́dasī, though the latter can also some-times be used for Rodasī). The verses are marked by what in Classical Sanskrit poetry would be called śleṣa (“punning”), and the tone is curiously mixed: Rodasī is both"},{"pageNumber":382,"pageContent":"I.167365extravagantly praised and at the same time scornfully compared to a loose woman, with those two incompatible attitudes conveyed in the same words. (Unfortunately, the understated deftness of these verbal plays is overwhelmed by our necessarily labored and clumsy explanations.) For example, in verse 3 Rodasī is compared to a young woman running after men by going to the public gaming hall, but also com-pared to fine ceremonial speech appropriate to a public occasion. The same word (sabhā́vatī) is used both for her shameful appearance in the public hall and her role as speech honored in public. In verse 4 the word sādhāraṇyā́ “common” is used both of the Maruts’ joint cherishing of Rodasī and in a simile comparing her to a whore. (This kind of verbal condemnation of a polyandrous woman is familiar in later Sanskrit in the taunts sometimes directed to the noble Draupadī, wife of the five Pāṇḍavas in the Mahābhārata.) A complex pun in the second half of verse 4 plays with the partial identity of Rodasī and the two world-halves; the grammatical aspects of this pun cannot be treated here. Despite the somewhat slighting treatment in the similes of verses 3–4, Rodasī takes on the role of bride in verses 5–6 by mounting the nuptial chariot like the mythological model of the bride, Sūryā. This depiction of ceremonial marriage provides a transition to the ritual here-and-now (vss. 6cd–7), where not only the Maruts, but also Rodasī along with the Wives of the Gods, appear at our ritual.1.

It is rich with elaborate and trickily constructed simi-les and with striking images and jarring turns of phrase. For the latter, consider the first simile in verse 2: “self-produced like fissures.” Neither the contents of the simile itself nor its application to the Maruts is immediately clear, but on further reflection the “self-produced fissures” call to mind earthquakes and their sudden and unpredictable power to open fissures in the ground, and this image seems an apt comparandum with the Maruts and their impetuous exercise of their power. Agastya plays with syntax, too, as in 5b where the verb “quiver” is used transitively in the frame of the simile and intransitively in the simile itself. In fact, in this hymn Agastya seems to want to deploy as many different types of structurally and con-ceptually twisted images as he can (the technical details of all of which we cannot treat here).The theme throughout is that, although the Maruts display great violence in their stormy onslaught, the result is the welcome and fructifying rain (see most"},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":"I.168367clearly vs. 7). This theme is nicely expressed in 3cd, which juxtaposes and combines the warlike and the peaceful: a spear compared to a woman (see also the previ-ous hymn, 167.3), and dagger and bangle placed together in their hands, a pairing emphasized by their phonological similarity: khādíś ca kr̥tíś ca.1. With sacrifice after sacrifice to you (performed always) in the same way (am I) victorious. Thought after thought have you received, as they travel to you, the gods.With well-twisted (hymns) might I turn you our direction, for the welfare of the two world-halves, for great help.2. They who, self-produced like fissures, self-strong, were born to refreshment, to sun(light)—the shakers—numbering in thousands like the waves of the waters, to be extolled [/*bound?] by the mouth like cows, like oxen.3. They who, like soma drinks, pressed when their stalks are satiated, once they have been drunk, sit in the hearts like friends—on their shoulders (a spear) clings tight like a clinging woman; in their hands both bangle and dagger are placed together.4. Self-yoked, (their horses) have driven down from heaven at will. Spur (them) on with your own breath, (as if) with a whip, you immortals.Dustless, powerfully born, the Maruts with their glinting spears make even the fixed places stir.5. O you Maruts with lightning as your spears, who is the one among you who sets (the fixed places) to quivering by your own breath, like someone with his tongue quivering between his jaws?(You) who stir up the wastelands on your journey as if stirring refreshments [=rain], who propel many, like Etaśa [=Sun’s horse] on his daily round.6. Where is the farther (part) of this great dusky realm, where the closer (part), o Maruts, in which you have driven?When you stir up the firmly compacted entity like loose pieces, you fly through the turbulent flood with a stone.7.

Here is a praise for you, Maruts, here a hymn from Māndārya, the respectful bard.With refreshment he would beg propitiation for himself. – May we know refreshment and a community having lively waters.I.169 IndraAgastya Maitrāvaruṇi8 verses: triṣṭubh, except virāj 2The subject of this hymn is the tense ritual standoff and negotiated settlement between Indra and the Maruts—who both came to Agastya’s sacrifice expecting it as exclusive offering—a situation also depicted in I.170–171 and the great dialogue hymn I.165. Although the Anukramaṇī names Indra as sole dedicand, the Maruts appear in every verse but 4 (though not by name in 6); however, Indra is the only god addressed—in fact, a vocative indra and a form of the 2nd singular pronoun appear in each of the first six verses and in the last one (8)—while the Maruts are always in the 3rd person. There is thus a definite imbalance in their roles.The poet begins by flattering Indra and suggesting that he is superior to the Maruts, but soon implies that the Maruts are getting ahead (vs. 2), and coopera-tion is suggested (vss. 1ab, 3). In the middle verses (4–5) the poet begs Indra for wealth in the sacrificial context (as shown by the priestly gift cow in verse 4), and this sets the stage for the reconciliation between Indra and the Maruts on the sac-rificial ground (vss. 6–7). In the final verse Indra is urged to join with the Maruts in giving us wealth, and is promised in return that he will be praised by the gods, that is, by the Maruts, who, however, will also receive praise—from the poet-sacrificers.Not surprisingly, since Agastya is the poet, the hymn is full of intriguing difficul-ties and studied similes, such as the superficially puzzling maxim in the second half of verse 3, which turns on the paradox of waters producing dry land (by silting up the channel?).1. Indra, you are the one who goes (before) even the great one [=Marut flock] as it *drives; you are the defender even from great dereliction.O ritual adept, as observant one win the favors of the Maruts for us, for they [=favors] are dearest to you.2. They have hitched themselves up, Indra—your (Maruts), who know as their own the tributes stemming from all communities among mortals.The battle-thrust of the Maruts is racing ahead in the winning of the prize-contest whose reward is the sun.3.

This hymn is the opening of the story, in which Indra confronts Agastya, who has prepared an offering for the Maruts rather than for him. Indra asks Agastya if there is really is to be noth-ing for him and how can one understand how such a thing could happen (1ab)! Indra warns Agastya that he may be able to fool someone else with promises of future offerings, but he cannot deceive or deny Indra (1cd). In fear, Agastya tries to convince Indra that he should not take the offerings intended for the Maruts, since they are his warriors, but rather come to some sort of accommodation with them (2). But Indra insists and accuses Agastya of ignoring him altogether (3). Agastya quickly capitulates and orders the sacrifice to be readied for Indra (4), but he still hopes that Indra will come to an agreement with Maruts to share the offering (5).Curious is the use of the 1st dual verb tanavāvahai “we two shall extend (the sac-rifice)” in verse 4, for it is unclear who the second subject, besides Agastya, would be. It might perhaps be Indra, taking an active role in his own sacrifice, but we sug-gest rather that it is Agastya’s wife Lopāmudrā, who is his ritual partner in I.179."},{"pageNumber":387,"pageContent":"I.1713701.

In this episode Agastya pleads with the Maruts to reconcile themselves with Indra and with him. He first addresses the Maruts (1–4) and then turns to Indra himself (5–6). In verse 4 Agastya explains to the Maruts that Indra terrified him and although the offerings were prepared for them, Agastya was forced to give them away to Indra. Then he addresses Indra and asks that Indra together with the Maruts prosper the “sons of Māna.” Māna is Agastya’s father, and therefore Agastya is seeking prosperity for his extended family. In verse 6 he pleads with the god not to attack the Maruts, who are his own men (6a), for ultimately Indra will be even greater because of his alliance with the Maruts (6cd).In 5a usrā́ḥ “ruddy” primarily describes the dawns, but it could also modify the “sons of Māna.” This ambiguity associates the luster of the dawns with the luster that Agastya wishes for his family. The ruddy color of the dawns is also the charac-teristic color of cattle and further suggests that the luster of the sons of Māna will be based in their wealth of cattle.1.

The Maruts as bring-ers of rain are celebrated as sudā́nu “having good drops” (vss. 1–3), an epithet that can also mean “having good gifts.” The poet asks that the negative aspects of the thunderstorm stay far away from him and his people.1. Bright be your course, bright with your help, o Maruts rich in drops,who gleam like snakes.2. In the distance be your straight-aiming arrow, you Maruts rich in drops,in the distance the stone that you hurl.3.

The expectation of Indra’s arrival and enjoyment of the sacrifice ends verse 4. The next three verses (5–7) constitute a formal praise of Indra, with a lovely image (vs. 6) of the god dressed in all the parts of the cosmos. These three verses, especially verse 7, also depict Indra as a feisty combatant whom competing forces wish to have on their side; the striking image in 7ab is of a tug-of-war. In the next verses (8–9) we redouble our efforts to secure him for our sacrifice. Verse 10 reprises the theme of Indra as the focus of competing factions, in a very dense and complex set of images, while verse 11 expresses the ritualists’ belief that a properly performed sacrifice will bring Indra here, however long it takes. The meandering route of the sacrifice in that verse is replicated in form by the meandering syntax. Verse 12 is a thematic departure, as well as a return to the rivalry of Indra and the Maruts over Agastya’s sacrifice; here the poet once again offers sacrifice to both parties. The hymn ends (vs. 13) with a familiar type of summary verse, with internal reference to the poem that is ending.As a product of Agastya, this hymn poses many verbal puzzles and provides many verbal rewards.1. He sings the sāman bursting out like (the song of) a bird; we chant this (chant) that is growing strong, bringing the sun.The cows, the milkers, the undeceivable ones are on the ritual grass, so that they will entice here the one whose seat is in heaven.2. The bull chants along with the bulls whose sweat is an oblation, like a ravenous wild beast, when he would out-sing (them).The exuberant Hotar sings forth his zeal. The young blood, deserving the sacrifice, supports the pair (of priests).3. The Hotar approaches, circling around the fixed seats (of the sacrificial beasts). He bears the embryo of the earth through the years.The horse neighs while being led; the cow bellows. Speech wanders between the two worlds like a messenger.4. We have done these more attainable *deeds [=ritual activities] for him. Those seeking the gods carry the actions further.He will enjoy them—Indra of wondrous luster, coming easily like the Nāsatyas, standing upon his chariot.5. Praise this Indra, who is the “real thing,” who is a champion, who is a benefactor, standing upon his chariot.More combative even than his opponent, provided with bulls, he’s the one who smashes apart even the enveloping darkness.6.

The first verse urges Indra to “guard the gods,” and he appears in that role as protector of Agni and his ritual activities (vs. 3) and enforcer of the norms of Ārya society, as embodied in the three principal Ādityas (vs. 6). Others who break the Ārya social contrast—the impious, the godless, the speakers of scorn, and the breakers of alliances (vss. 2, 6, 7, 8)—also fall victim to Indra as enforcer. Thus, though the tone is martial, the message is moral.Two separate devices structure the hymn. On the one hand, the vocative indra (always to be read trisyllabically) appears in the first pāda of every verse immedi-ately after the caesura. On the other hand, there is ring composition: the first and last (10) verses name Indra as “giver of victorious power” and “protector of men,” while verse 2 has numerous echoes in verses 7–9.1. You are king, Indra: guard those who are gods and the superior men; protect us, lordly one.You, as lord of settlements, are our surpassing benefactor, you the real possessor of goods and giver of victorious power.2. You subdued the clans whose speech was scornful, Indra, when you split the seven autumnal strongholds, their shelter.You set the flooding waters in motion, faultless one.

The most obvious device in this hymn is the relentless repetition of forms derived from a very few roots: mad “become exhilarated” (vss. 1, 2, 5), sah “be victorious” (vss. 2–3), san/sā “win” (vss. 1, 2, 3, 5). These three roots create an inescapable poetic logic of cause (exhilaration) and effect (conquer [enemies] and win [prizes]), but the effect is still rather clumsy.Verse 4 stands out as the exception, as it contains no forms of any of the signa-ture roots, and it compresses within it a whole mythological complex: the stealing of the wheel of the Sun, and the involvement of Kutsa, the horses of the Wind, and, by implication, Uśanā Kāvya in that obscure story—a myth also alluded to in the preceding hymn (I.174.5, 7, as well as often elsewhere, e.g., I.130.9).One other feature is worthy of note: the image in verse 3cd, of Indra “firing” the Dasyu like a piece of pottery.1.

The jingly use of stems vŕ̥ṣan and vr̥ṣabhá furnishes its main claim to attention. All its repeated pādas are suspect.” Although we moderns might tend to be less outspo-ken, this is certainly one of Agastya’s lesser efforts. The standard tropes of invita-tion to the sacrifice (vs. 1ab), journey (vss. 1cd–3), and arrival (vs. 4) are presented without complexity, and with a certain recycling of vocabulary—not only the “bull” words scornfully noted by Bloomfield, but also “right up here” (arvā́ṅ vss. 1, 2, 5), “one such as me” (madrík vss. 1, 3), and the usual lexicon of the journey.

Nonetheless, the overall intent of the hymn is clear.In the first two verses the poet asserts the usual relationship between mortal praise and divine aid. Indra gives his attention to the current poet as he did to previous ones, it is hoped, and therefore should fulfill our desire. The content of this desire is expressed in an obscure phrase, “all things around the waters of Āyu,” which has been explained by Paul Thieme (1949: 41 n. 2) as the territories that can be inhabited by men because water is available. Verse 2 more or less repeats the sentiments: Indra will surely not deprive us, and he will surely come to our sacrifice. The question is what Indra will not deprive us of: the grammatical difficulties of pāda b alluded to above add to the interpretational puzzle. If the two sisters here are Night and Dawn, as most scholars believe, it is presumably whatever these two temporal entities (treated as plural, not dual, because they consist of many days and nights?) produce in the progress of time. The sisters could also be the two hands (treated as plural because each consists of five fingers). The waters make another appearance in this verse, with no more clarity than in verse 1.The next verse (3), which is the center of the hymn, predicates of Indra (in agent nouns difficult to render literally) an array of roles in which he gives aid to mortals, and the final two verses (4–5), beginning with a summary evā́ “even so, in the same way,” urge Indra to fulfill some of these roles.1. Since, Indra, the same attentive hearing of yours still exists by reason of which you stood by the (previous) singers with your help,don’t let our wish that magnifies (you) come up short. Might I attain all things of yours (that are) around the waters of Āyu.2. King Indra will not cheat us (of those things) that the two sisters [=Dawn and Night? hands?] will make in their own womb.The easily goaded waters also toiled for him. Indra will come to our fellowship and vitality.3. Indra, champion in battles, is the one who conquers with his superior men, the one who hears the call of the bard crying in distress,the one who brings the chariot of the pious man to the fore (when he is) nearby, and the one who raises up the songs, if he is there in person.4. Even so, (let) Indra with his superior men, with a desire for good fame, the devourer of strengthening nourishment, overcome the allies.He will be praised in the competition for refreshment and at the debate—as the one active in every way, as the (very) laud of the sacrificer.5.

The first four verses consist of a dialogue between the seer Agastya, the poet of this hymn cycle (I.165–191), and his wife Lopāmudrā. It concerns, and contains in embryo, a persistent theme in Indian religious literature and thought, the com-peting and incompatible goals of male religious figures: ascetic practice and the production of sons, and it also presents the figure who mediates these goals: the sexually eager woman who seduces the ascetic, who can thus attain the second goal without actively abandoning the first (see, e.g., Jamison 1996a: 15–17).Lopāmudrā speaks the first two verses, urging her husband to allow them both to cease their ritual labors and have sex. She mentions the deleterious effects of old age (vs. 1c) and cites as a precedent for her proposed course of action the pious ancients who nevertheless also stopped working from time to time (vs. 2). In our view (and that of the Anukramaṇī and Sāyaṇa, inter alia, contra a number of mod-ern scholars, who assign vs. 4 to Lopāmudrā), Agastya speaks the next two verses (3–4). In verse 3 he counters her proposal with a vigorous call to renewed reli-gious endeavor, which he casts as a battle against a tricky and numerous enemy that they, as a married couple (mithunaú), can defeat together. The word mithunaú is a charged one, because it of course can refer specifically to a sexual pairing. And this is what appears to be rather graphically illustrated in verse 4, where Agastya suc-cumbs to his lust, as Lopāmudrā engages him in intercourse. The “steadfast” (dhī́ra) man is undone by the “flighty” (ádhīra) woman.The next two verses (5–6) are assigned by the Anukramaṇī to a student, and at least verse 5 may contain the expiatory statement of someone, quite possibly a brahmacārin or Vedic student, who has broken a vow, quite possibly the vow of chastity, and has undertaken ritual purification. The myth embodied in the previous dialogue acts as a Legendenzauber, a magic spell that provides a myth-ological precedent for the misdeed and its expiation. (See Thieme 1964: 76.) The final verse (6) summarizes the happy results for Agastya, despite—indeed because of—his lapse: he attained offspring as well as power and a place among the gods.Although verse 5 provides support for the expiatory theory, we are inclined to think there is something more going on, and that the conflict between Agastya and Lopāmudrā reflects a theological struggle dimly perceptible beneath the sur-face of the late R̥gveda—the struggle between the innovative theologians who favor introducing the new ritual model involving the Sacrificer’s Wife as partner on the ritual stage, and the conservatives who consider it a dangerous model with poten-tially disastrous side-effects. Agastya in verse 3 appears to be a spokesman for the innovators, urging an energetic ritual partnership between husband and wife—a"},{"pageNumber":397,"pageContent":"I.180380partnership that deteriorates in the next verse into a mere sexual encounter. In this reading Agastya must undertake the penance in verse 5, and although everything comes out right for him, the hymn cannot be seen as a ringing endorsement of the introduction of the Sacrificer’s Wife.1. [Lopāmudrā:] “For many autumns have I been laboring, evening and morning, through the aging dawns.Old age diminishes the beauty of bodies. Bullish (men) should now come to their wives.”2. [Lopāmudrā:] “For even those ancients, who served truth and at one with the gods spoke truths,even they got out of harness, for they did not reach the end. Wives should now unite with their bullish (husbands).”3. [Agastya:] “Not in vain is the labor that the gods help. Let us two take on all contenders;let us two win here the contest of a hundred stratagems, when as a united couple we will drive on.”4. [Agastya:] “The lust of a mounting bull [/waxing reed = penis] has come to me, lust arisen from here, from there, from everywhere.Lopāmudrā makes the bullish one flow out; the steadfast man does the flighty woman suck while he is snorting.”5. [Student or Agastya:] “This soma within my heart, just drunk, do I adjure:Whatever offense we have committed, let him forgive that, for of many desires is mortal man.”6. Agastya, digging with spades, seeking offspring, descendants, power—with regard to both “colors” [=offspring and ascetic power] the mighty seer throve. He arrived at his hopes, which came true among the gods.I.180 AśvinsAgastya Maitrāvaruṇi10 verses: triṣṭubhAgastya’s trickery and virtuosic obscurity are fully on display in this hymn. As a consequence we are uncertain about the correctness of many details of our interpretation, but puzzling out the hymn provides an exhilarating ride—per-haps appropriately, since the hymn begins and ends with the Aśvins’ chariot-drive around the cosmic spaces. This ring composition is signaled by the responsions between verses 1 and 10: the chariot “flies around” the airy realms and the (cosmic) floods in 1ab and “speeds around” heaven in 10c (a parallel with a clever twist in the Sanskrit, where the verb “flies” [dī́yat] is a close phonological match with the"},{"pageNumber":398,"pageContent":"I.180381word for “heaven” [dyā́m]), and a physical feature of the chariot, its wheel-rims or fellies, is mentioned in both verses, but with different words (paví 1c, -nemi 10c). This ring composition provides a structure in which both the Aśvins’ journey to and participation in the sacrifice and the poet’s exploration of the boundaries of language can be anchored.In our view the flying journey begun in verse 1 brings the Aśvins to the sacrifi-cial ground and its ritual fire in verse 2, a fire that is itself characterized as having “wide flight,” that is, as physically spreading out and up when kindled. The next two verses depict several of the Aśvins’ earlier deeds as creating a reciprocal benefit for them at the current sacrifice. Verse 3 notes that they (primordially) put the milk in cows, a fact of nature that is often marveled at in the R̥gveda—that a “cooked” (that is, ready to consume) substance, milk, is derived from its container, the “raw” flesh of the living cow. Now this same milk is going into cups to provide the Aśvins’ oblation. Similarly, in verse 4 the sweet gharma drink that they produced for the mythological figure Atri comes back to them at this sacrifice. Both of these verses, particularly 3, bristle with difficulties.With verse 5 the poet turns to his own situation and, in subsequent verses, that of his fellow singers and their patrons. In 5 he presents himself, in the 1st person sin-gular, as a poor man beset with difficulties, expressing the hope that with his praise he can bring the Aśvins to his sacrifice and induce them to make gifts. Verse 6 has as its subject the poet’s patron, depicted in two punning verbs (6c) as actively involved in the sacrifice; the poet here (6d) hopes that this patron will act in good faith and according to his proper duty by receiving the Aśvins’ gifts and then redistributing them to the poet and his fellows. Verses 7 and 8 present a series of interlocking causal clauses with shifting subjects. In 7ab because “we singers” do our job of praising the gods, our patron is not stingy. “We singers” (of 7ab) in the 1st person plural transform into Agastya in the 3rd person singular (8cd) via a set of clauses in which the human half of the divine/human interface is left unspecified, and indeed other crucial grammatical information, like the verb in 8ab, is missing. In our inter-pretation, Agastya, who is of course the poet (who appeared in the 1st person sin-gular in vs. 5), is the subject of the whole of verse 8, and he is calling the Aśvins to the Morning Pressing, the sacrifice appropriate to them, whose ritual substance, the soma, is characterized by the difficult hapax vírudra “apart from/without Rudra/the Rudras [=Maruts].” We believe (after a suggestion of Geldner’s) that this word encodes a reference to Agastya’s mythological engagement with the Maruts (see especially the dialogue hymns I.165, 170, 171) and his attempts to ensure that the Maruts get a share in the sacrifice. Here, since the Maruts are associated with the Midday Pressing, the offering of soma to the Aśvins in the early morning would be made without the Maruts, despite Agastya’s loyalty to the Maruts and his general eagerness to provide them offerings. In any case, clearly Agastya has had ritual suc-cess, crowned both by widespread praise (8c) and by the possession of thousands (presumably of cows or other livestock)."},{"pageNumber":399,"pageContent":"I.180382Verses 9–10 return to the gods’ chariot journey and are relatively straightfor-ward, with a particularly uncomplicated demand for horses for us and our patrons in 9cd.1.

The hymn begins at the sacrifice, with the Aśvins acting as priests (vs. 1), but then draws back temporally to the usual invitation to travel to the sacrifice (vss. 2–3). Verse 4 gives us a tantalizing glimpse of a potential differentiation between the two Aśvins, who are otherwise almost always treated as identical and identically functioning twins.Verses 5–6 are entirely parallel to each other in structure and return to the jour-ney theme, but introduce another, though unnamed, figure by way of a slippery use of the word anyá “other.” In verse 4 paired anyá’s referred to the two individual Aśvins, but in the following two verses, each containing an anyá in pāda c, the Aśvins are jointly established in the first half of the verse and implicitly contrast with the unidentified “other” of pāda c. In our opinion this “other” must be Indra, identifiable because of the pair of fallow bay horses in 5c, a pair of horses that are uniquely Indra’s in the R̥gveda. It is not surprising that the Aśvins and Indra should be journeying at the same time, since both are recipients of parts of the Morning Pressing.The final verses (7–9) take place on the sacrificial ground. Verse 8 is especially rich in striking images of the ritual: the sacrificial fire is depicted as a “gleaming wasp” whose sound is likened to a praise hymn, and the imminent mixing of soma and milk gives rise to a complex erotic image, with the soma a swollen “bullish cloud” at the “pouring out” (se﻿́ka) of the milk—its swelling attributed to its sexual excitement at the “insemination” (se﻿́ka) of the cow. In general, swelling as a sign of abundance is a consistent theme in the latter part of the hymn (vss. 5c, 6c, 8b, 8c).1. What (portion) of nourishments and riches (do) you two dearest ones (draw up), when, acting as Adhvaryus, you draw up (a portion) of the waters?This sacrifice here has made its own encomium for you, o you depositories of goods, helpers of the peoples."},{"pageNumber":401,"pageContent":"I.1823842.

They should destroy such people and reward us, the faithful sacrificers and poets (vss. 3–4). The “baying hounds” of verse 4 may well be a reference to rival poets.Most of the remainder of the hymn (vss. 5–7) is devoted to the tale of Bhujyu, son of Tugra, whom the Aśvins rescued with a marvelous boat (or boats) when he was set adrift in the sea. This exploit was alluded to briefly by Agastya in I.180.5 and is treated several times in Kakṣīvant’s Aśvin hymns (esp. I.116.3–5, I.117.14–15) as well as elsewhere in the R̥gveda.The final verse (8) is a typical summary verse, referring to the poem just recited and ending with the Agastya refrain.1. This (ritual) pattern has now been set: (all of you,) attend upon it! The chariot has its bulls: become exhilarated, (all) you of inspired thought!(Here are) the two holy ones who quicken thought, who provided the goods to (the mare) Viśpalā, the sons of heaven whose commandments are bright for the good performer (of ritual).2.

The first two verses call the gods to the sacrifice and urge them to enjoy the sacrifice and be attentive to the poet. Verses 4–5 return to the scene of the sacrifice, requesting that the gifts and attention of the Aśvins be directed to us, not to others (vs. 4), while verse 5 contains a common type of summary of the hymn in which it’s found, announcing its completion (5ab), and ends with the Aśvins in the company of Agastya (5d). The poet’s positioning of his own name directly adjacent to that of the Aśvins (voc. Nāsatya) in the final pāda of this series was surely deliberate.The middle verse (3) makes a brief detour into mythology: the participation of the Aśvins in the bridal journey of Sūryā, Daughter of the Sun (5ab). The verse is addressed, in the first instance, to Pūṣan, who also participates in this episode elsewhere. Several obscure images are found in this verse—the simile comparing the Aśvins to arrow-makers (3a) and the journey of their lead horses (3cd) with the well-nigh-impenetrable simile involving “vast Varuṇa,” which may refer to the sea and reflect the generally later association of Varuṇa with waters. These difficulties are, of course, appropriate to a structurally isolated middle verse.1. We would summon you today and you later on. When dawn is breaking, the conductor (of words) with solemn words (summons)the Nāsatyas, the sons of Heaven, wherever they are, for the man who gives even more than the stranger.2.

Verses 2–8 all end with a pāda-long refrain; since this refrain seems to be an implicit response to verse 1, we believe that 1–8 form a coherent whole, ending with an expiatory verse (8) and then followed by a three-verse summary referring to the hymn-within-a-hymn that precedes.The refrain addressed to Heaven and Earth, “protect us from the formless void,” expresses the Vedic fear of the darkness and lack of definition character-istic of pre-creation chaos. Heaven and Earth help dispel that fear and provide protection from the void in several ways. They are the defining structures of the cosmos, and within the shaped space they produce between them, all separate forms, animate and inanimate, exist. This seems to be the point of verse 1c, “they carry everything that is a name”; we take this as a version of the later Sanskrit nāma-rūpa “name and form,” the multiplicity of individual entities, defined by the conjunction of a physical form and a word for it. Heaven and Earth are also the parents of the Sun, the light that allows the individual forms to be seen. Their parentage of the Sun is, in our opinion, the subject of verses 2–4, though the Sun is not mentioned directly. The embryo of verse 2 is the “gift of Aditi” in verse 3 (the Sun is already called ādityá, son of Aditi in the late R̥gveda; see, e.g., I.191.9), while verse 4 describes the wonder that Heaven and Earth are never burned by the Sun, their son. (On this kinship relation, see also the Heaven and Earth hymn I.160.)Heaven and Earth define space, but they also, in part via their son, define time: the regular alternation of day and night is first mentioned in verse 1d. The two complementary pairs, Heaven and Earth and Night and Dawn, are treated together in verse 4c, and in our opinion the siblings of verse 5 are more likely Night and Dawn than Heaven and Earth, since they are located “in the lap of their parents,” that is, Heaven and Earth. However, the latter pair are definitely the subject of verses 6–7, and their role in conception is highlighted again. The final verse of the refrain-bounded section (8) seeks expiation for an unnamed offense, and offers the current hymn (“this hymnic vision”) to that end.The last three verses (9–11) develop this theme. The poet expresses the hope that the verbal products he has just produced will help him: his “lauds belonging"},{"pageNumber":406,"pageContent":"I.185389to men” (a variation on the technical term nárāśáṃsa, vs. 9), and the “truth” he addressed to Heaven and Earth (vss. 10–11).1.

There is much emphasis on shared activity, with expressions like “in concert” (sajo﻿́ṣas vss. 2–3, 6), “along with” (smát vss. 6–8), “like-minded” (sámanas vs. 8). The invitations end with verse 10; as so often, the final verse (11) is an internal reference to the hymn itself and its power to satisfy the gods.The beginnings of the verses and half-verses display an intricate pattern of rep-etition that cannot be rendered in translation: with matching preverbs in verses 1–2 and 9–10 (the latter showing an especially complex phonological pattern), and the verses of the middle section (5–8) all opening with utá “and” (as well as additional matching material). The “and” especially contributes to our sense of the additive quality of the invitations to the gods.1.

In the straightforward verses (esp. 1–3, 6), the poet praises food as the necessary support and help for both gods and men, a theme summarized in the final verse (11).But the nature of food and of its “juices” (rásāḥ) is also explored in several obscure verses (esp. 4–5), where they have a cosmic dimension. In our view, the juices of verse 4, “dispersed throughout the (cosmic) realms and adjoined to heaven like the winds,” are the rains, localized in the midspace like the winds—and more generally the endlessly circulating cosmic waters that fall as rain, produce food in"},{"pageNumber":409,"pageContent":"I.187392the form of plants and animals, and return to heaven by evaporation and by ritual offering. In verse 5 these juices both yield food (as the nurturing rains) and are part of, or belong to, food (as the juicy parts of plants and animals).The hymn takes a ritual turn in the last four verses (7–10) before the summary verse (11). Verse 7 seems to introduce the early-morning ritual; in the next three verses (8–10), marked by a refrain, food is sacralized—made equivalent to soma (vs. 9) and to a plant, perhaps the soma plant (vs. 10), each addressed as “friend of the winds” (see vs. 4 for food’s association with the winds)—and transformed into ritual offerings. The generic “waters and plants” of verse 8 become the milk and grain mixed with soma in verse 9. (The exact application of vs. 10 is unfortunately unclear.) In each case, the addressee is urged to “become just the fat,” in other words (in a more robust society than ours) the choicest part of the food substance.1. Now I shall praise food, the support and power of the great,by whose might Trita shook Vr̥tra apart till his joints were parted.2. O sweet food, honeyed food, we have chosen you:for us be a helper.3. Draw near to us, food—kindly with your kindly help,joy itself, not to be despised, a very kind companion without duplicity.4. These juices of yours, food, are dispersed throughout the realms,adjoined to heaven like the winds.5.

On you, food, is the mind of the great gods set.A dear (deed) was done at your signal: he smashed the serpent with your help.7. When yonder dawning light of the mountains has come, o food,then you should also come here to us, honeyed food, fit for our portion.8. When we bite off a full share of the waters and plants,o you friend of the winds—become just the fat.9. When we take a share of you when mixed with milk or mixed with grain, o Soma,o you friend of the winds—become just the fat.10. Become the gruel, o plant, the fat, the steaming [?] suet [?],o you friend of the winds—become just the fat.11.

The imaginative catalogue of possible hazards and enemies continues through verse 6. Verse 7 breaks this pattern, but implicitly suggests why Agni will remain on the poet’s side: the god distinguishes between sacrificers and non-sacrificers, and he makes himself available to the former.The hymn ends with a typical summary verse characterizing the hymn that pre-cedes. The poet’s claim that he has spoken “enigmas” seems overblown; in the uni-verse of R̥gvedic discourse this hymn is remarkably straightforward, and Agni is unlikely to find interpreting it particularly challenging. The final verse does, how-ever, draw attention to a structural feature of the hymn: the first seven verses all contain the vocative of the god’s name, in insistent initial position in the first three, then somewhat postponed in the next four. In the summary verse the direct address to Agni is absent, and he appears instead in the locative, a grammatical shift that underlines the change of topic.1. O Agni, lead us to wealth by an easy path, since you know all the (ritual) patterns, o god.Keep from us transgression, going its crooked way.

This theme is established in the first verse, where my chants strengthen Br̥haspati, who himself is the “leader of song.” The physi-cal movement of words and sound—between mortals and gods, between earth and heaven—is a repeated theme in the hymn (see esp. vss. 2, 4, 7). The difficult verses 3 and 4 concern a particular kind of sacred sound, the signal-call (ślo﻿́ka) that Br̥haspati launches daily, most likely a call announcing the sacrifice or some part of it.The Br̥haspati depicted in this hymn is no mere gentle wordsmith, but militant and aggressive, compared to a bellowing bull (vs. 1), a fearsome wild beast (vss. 3, 4), a bird of prey (vs. 7). His words are missiles (vs. 4), and those who underestimate him and seek to exploit him receive his punishment (vs. 5).1. With chants I will strengthen anew the unassailable bull of gladdening tongue, Br̥haspati,the brightly shining leader of song to whom the gods and the mortals harken as he bellows.2. Words follow close upon him in proper sequence, like a gush that has been sent gushing from those serving the gods,for Br̥haspati, far-ranging straightway through the wide spaces, has become equal to Mātariśvan in regard to truth.3.

Like that text, it frequently uses expressions of the immediate past (especially in the aor-ist) as a triumphant predictor of successful measures taken in the present. That is, a statement like “they have been wiped out” (vs. 1d), though apparently referring to the past, probably instead announces, hopefully, that the current verbal spell along with whatever physical magic practices have been undertaken will ensure that the desired effect will have happened this instant. Unfortunately we have no real idea what the physical rites involved, though judging from parallels like Atharvaveda VII.56, entitled by Whitney “Against poison of snakes and insects,” it may well have involved healing plants and insect-eating birds.The first nine verses of the hymn are directed particularly against adŕ̥ṣta—“the unseen, invisible”—apparently small biting insects. English has a remarkably close counterpart in the colloquially named “no-see-ums,” which also share behaviors with their Sanskrit counterparts: clinging to grasses (vs. 3) and becoming especially virulent in the early evening (vss. 4–5). And anyone who has ever attempted to swat"},{"pageNumber":414,"pageContent":"I.191397a flying bug ruefully recognizes the commands given in verse 6: “stand still! come to rest!”In the rest of the hymn (vss. 10–16) the speaker works to render ineffective and harmless the poison of poisonous insects more generally. One of the most salient features of this part of the hymn is the density of diminutivization, that is, of the use of the colloquial, low-register -ka-suffix, which appears not only on nouns referring to bugs and birds, but also on pronouns and demonstrative adjectives (vss. 11, 15) and even on a participle (vs. 16). (For further on the sociolinguistics of the -ka-suffix, see Jamison 2009b). Though for the most part the tools deployed against the poison are homely ones—little birds and plants, insofar as we can tell—this section of the hymn begins with higher rhetorical ambitions and a mythic model. In verse 10, whose interpretation is much disputed, the speaker fastens the poison on the sun and the skin containing the poison (in our view) “on the house of the possessor of liquor (surā).” Although most commentators, beginning at least with Sāyaṇa, interpret the latter action as an unmarked simile likening this action to the fastening of the poison on the sun, in our view it is a parallel mytho-ritual action and provides the mythic model for the ritual actions that follow. Again in our view, the possessor of liquor is Indra—a reference to a myth well known in the Brāhmaṇas and already clearly present in the late R̥gveda (X.131.4–5), in which Indra, sickened from drinking an excess of soma, is made to drink the usually for-bidden alcohol surā by the Aśvins and Sarasvatī. The surā was not pure but mixed, and both the Aśvins and Indra perform the singular feat of separating the two mixed liquids in the course of drinking them—a detail found in the R̥gvedic treat-ment just cited. The ability to separate liquids, to get rid of (or nullify the effects of) the noxious one and preserve the beneficial one, is what the ritual performer desires here, as the last two pādas of the refrain (vss. 10–13ef) make clear.1. The stinger that isn’t a stinger, and the one that’s a real stinger—these are the two—they’re called fleas. The no-see-ums have been wiped out.2. As she comes, she smashes the no-see-ums, and as she goes away, she smashes them.Smashing them down, she smashes them, and crushing, she crushes them.3. The reeds and the damn reeds, the darbha-grasses and (the bugs) on the sira-plants [?] ,the no-see-ums on the muñja-grass and on the vīraṇa-grass—all have been wiped out at once.4. The cows have sat down in the cowshed; the wild animals have settled down—down (also) the lights of the peoples. The no-see-ums have been wiped out.5.

The hymns refer to the people of the poet as Gr̥tsamadas four times, but also as Śunahotras three times. Of the forty-three hymns in this maṇḍala, the Anukramaṇī ascribes all but seven to Gr̥tsamada him-self. It attributes II.4–7 to Somāhuti Bhārgava, who would have thus belonged to the lineage of Gr̥tsamada’s father by adoption, and II.27–29 either to Kūrma Gārtsamada or to Gr̥tsamada. One of the characteristic features of the hymns of this maṇḍala is that twenty-one of its hymns, almost half, end with the signature refrain of the Gr̥tsamadas, “May we speak loftily at the ritual distribution, in pos-session of good heroes.”The maṇḍala has ten hymns in the Agni series, including one Āprī hymn (II.3), and twelve in the Indra series (II.11–22). Among the latter is one of the best-known Indra hymns, II.12, with its famous refrain, “he, o peoples, is Indra.” Characteristically, Gr̥tsamada connects the heroic deeds of Indra to the acts of the ritual, so that the ritual practice becomes the guarantee that Indra will again per-form his great deeds. Following the Indra series are four hymns to Brahmaṇaspati or Br̥haspati, the “lord of the sacred formulation” (II.23–26). In the first of these, Brahmaṇaspati or Br̥haspati appears as both a priestly companion of Indra and as Indra himself in his role as a priest-king, and in the second, Br̥haspati is Indra. Both refer to the Vala myth, in which Indra and his accompanying priests release the cat-tle by the power of the formulated truth. After two hymns, one to the Ādityas (II.27) and one to Varuṇa, the foremost of the Ādityas (II.28), there are a series of hymns to the All Gods (II.29, 31) or to various gods (II.30, 32). The last of these is a com-posite hymn in two different meters, honoring minor deities, including four female deities concerned with childbirth. Most of the remaining hymns of the maṇḍala are single hymns to other deities. Noteworthy among them are II.33, one of only three hymns in the R̥gveda to Rudra, II.35, the only hymn in the R̥gveda dedicated to Apām Napāt, the “Child of the Waters,” and II.38, a hymn to Savitar that shows his role as the god of the evening who brings the world to rest. The final two hymns, II.42 and 43, are hymns to omen-birds, asking them to cry only auspicious cries and comparing their auspicious cries to the words and chants of the poets."},{"pageNumber":417,"pageContent":"II.1400II.1 (192) AgniGr̥tsamada Bhārgava Śaunaka, originally Āṅgirasa Śaunahotra16 verses: jagatīThis hymn is structured as a series of identifications—of the god Agni with priests, other gods, kin/social relations, qualities, body parts, and so on, with the identifica-tion mediated by the quality held in common.Although the equations may at first seem randomly ordered, in fact they fol-low a logical progression. The first ones (vs. 2) identify Agni with human priests. (Priestly identifications are also found extensively in II.5. And for the relationship between particular priests and particular gods, see also the R̥tugraha hymns I.15, II.36–37.) In the next five verses (3–7) the variety of functions Agni discharges invite identification with a series of gods. Verses 8–9 then set Agni in the web of human relationships, of varying degrees of close kinship. We return to the divine (or semi-divine) world in verses 10–11, but the identifications here link him especially to ritual activity (the R̥bhus in vs. 10, who are associated with the Third Pressing and who achieved divinity by their ritual feats; the female divinities in vs. 11, who are regularly mentioned in the Āprī hymns) and prepare for the last section of the hymn (vss. 12–14). The R̥bhu verse (10) also contains an elaborate pun, while the identification of Agni with three female divinities in verse 11 would surely provoke attention in the audience. Agni’s own ritual service, especially to the gods, provides the subject of verses 12–14. The last pāda of this last section (14d) provides a ring with the first verse (1d): “you were born blazing” (jajñiṣe śúciḥ 14d), reprising “you are born blazing” (jāyase śúciḥ 1d), in both cases with a mention of the plants as his source. This neat ring, which closes the series of individual identifications, sets the stage for the climactic verse 15 (before the refrain of 16), which proclaims Agni’s complete superiority throughout heaven and earth.The identifications are themselves structured by an extraordinary density of rhe-torical repetition. Of the sixteen verses, the first fourteen begin with a form of the 2nd-person singular pronoun tvám “you,” followed by the vocative agne “o Agni.” In fact fifty-four pādas out of fifty-six open with a 2nd-person singular pronoun, in addition to other pronominal forms scattered in non-initial position. For exam-ple, there are seven forms of tva﻿́m in the first verse alone. The fifteenth verse (and the last before the refrain) begins, as usual, with tva﻿́m, but the vocative a﻿́gne is postponed till the opening of the second pāda—distracting the formula. As often, rhetorical patterns established earlier in a hymn are varied as the hymn comes to a close, and the change of pattern here draws attention to the climactic contents of verse 15 discussed just above. Though the rhetorical tool, repetition, is a blunt instrument, its effects are powerful.This rhetorical pattern is especially striking because so many of the pronominal forms are nominatives and therefore unnecessary, since pronominal subjects need not be expressed in Sanskrit. Though some of these nominatives occur in equational"},{"pageNumber":418,"pageContent":"II.1401sentences (cf. tva﻿́m agníd r̥tāyata﻿́ḥ “you [are] the Agnidh of the one who follows truth”) where a pronominal forms is often used in place of a copula, a surprising number of these equational sentences also employ a 2nd-person singular copula (asi [e.g., 3a, 5d] or equivalent), rendering a pronominal subject unnecessary. For further discussion see Jamison (2007: 59–60). Poetics, not grammar, is the driving factor.The effect of this incantatory repetition of “you, Agni,” taking place in front of the sacrificial fire on the ritual ground, combined with the sweep of equations identifying Agni with what comes to seem like everything on earth and in heaven, is to concentrate all of the cosmos into this small space, the sacrifical ground, and this single entity, the sacrificial fire—indeed making the sacrificial microcosm the equivalent of the macrocosm. The ordering of the identifications—starting and ending at the sacrifice, but in between ranging through both the divine and human realms—models the centrality of the sacrifice and of its focus, the sacred fire. It is a powerful beginning to the maṇḍala and to the Family Books in general.1.

The twin themes of the whole hymn are encapsulated in the first verse: Agni installed in the ritual ground, performing the role of Hotar, and receiving oblations and hymns; Agni as the earthly counterpart of the blazing sun.The hymn falls into two nearly equal parts. The first five verses are primarily descriptive, with Agni generally referred to in the 3rd person; verses 6–12 (13 is repeated from II.1.16) consist primarily of requests, addressed to Agni in the 2nd person. The first half establishes Agni’s cosmic role, mediating between and watch-ing over the heavenly and earthly realms and maintaining his position through the regular temporal alternations (for the latter, see esp. vs. 2). With Agni’s cosmic dom-inance thus affirmed, the second half seeks to utilize these wider powers of his to enhance our own position in the cosmos. See, for example, verse 9, where the poet describes his poetic vision (dhī́) taking its place among the immortals in heaven, and verse 10, where he compares the brilliance of his own people with the sun, the same sun with which Agni is identified earlier.There is also an emphasis on Agni perceiving and being perceived, enhanced by a pun in the Sanskrit on the verb citaya, which can mean both “appear, be per-ceived” and “perceive,” sometimes simultaneously (vss. 4, 5, 10).Stylistically the hymn seems designed deliberately to contrast with the preceding one (II.1). In that hymn Agni is identified with various beings and elements, whereas in this one, especially in the first half, Agni is compared to such third parties: the simile is the dominant figure. It is striking that II.1, by contrast, contains not a single simile.1. With sacrifice increase Jātavedas; sacrifice to Agni with oblation, with song at lengthwhen he is kindled—(Agni) receiving pleasurable offerings, possessing solar glory, the heaven-ruling Hotar, sitting at the chariot-pole in the (ritual) enclosures.2.

The hymn ends with two verses requesting benefits for the Gr̥tsamada clan (8–9). Oblique references to the myth of the recovery of the vanished fire in verses 2 and 9 provide the hymn with a larger ring-like structure.1.

Only in the last verse (8) does Agni appear as himself, without a separate priestly identity, to ensure the entire success of the sacrifice.In verses 5–6 the references are somewhat obscure, but the ritual situation depicted seems to be the offering of melted butter into the fire; the butter offerings are identified as females, under the leadership of Agni as Neṣṭar, the priest who leads the Sacrificer’s Wife in the later śrauta ritual. The referent of the “three” of verse 5 is quite obscure, though it must be feminine in gender. It is perhaps the “three watery maidens” associated with the sacrifice in III.56.5 and the three “women god-desses,” also associated with water, who desire to provide food to Apām Napāt in II.35.5: their watery nature may explain Agni’s preference for the buttery sisters."},{"pageNumber":425,"pageContent":"II.6408Their number of three may allude to the trio of goddesses in the Āprī hymns (see, e.g., II.3.8), Sarasvatī, Iḍā, and Bhāratī.The hymn provides valuable evidence for the technical details and the personnel and their duties of R̥gvedic ritual, which, though sharing much terminology and many procedures, nonetheless differs from the later, very well-documented, classical śrauta ritual of middle Vedic times.1.

The family is less prominent in the R̥gveda, but is mentioned in telling passages in Maṇḍalas III, VI, and VII; the Bhārata fire is mentioned in several other passages like the ones in this hymn. As Proferes argues (2007: 36–37), Agni is often identified with the tribal king, and “the most com-monly mentioned tribal fire is that of the Bharata,” which is “specifically linked to the military power of the tribe.” Although that theme is not insistent here, the hostilities and hatreds mentioned in verses 2–3 against which Agni’s aid is besought evoke this idea."},{"pageNumber":427,"pageContent":"II.8410The hymn also illustrates, more clearly than usual, the poetic use of the meta-phorical extension of ritual practices. In verse 4 the fire is “bepoured” (ā́hutaḥ) with streams of melted butter, a standard ritual action, which therefore would arouse no special interest in the audience; in verse 5 it is also “bepoured”—the same adjective in the same position in the verse—but with entities considerably less liquid: vari-ous bovines, expressed in technical stock-breeding language, which serve as animal sacrifices in the later śrauta ritual. The audience would certainly take note of this clash of concepts and metaphorically extend either the adjective (from “bepoured” to “offered to”) or the offerings (not the cows, but their product, the ghee). What is unusual in this hymn is that verse 4 explicitly provides the normal template against which verse 5 must be interpreted. Ordinarily we encounter only the off-balance expression, and must ourselves summon the normal one from the formulaic and conceptual stock held in common by the audience.1. Youngest Agni, belonging to the Bharatas, bear hither the best brilliant wealth,craved by many, o good one.2. Let hostility of god and mortal not gain mastery over us.Rescue us from it and from hatred.3. And with you may we, as if across watery streams,plunge across all hatreds.4.

The mention of the seer and poet Atri in verse 5 is surprising: Atri is the poet of the Vth Maṇḍala and is oth-erwise not found in II. However, in the immediately preceding verse the appar-ently innocent simile “like the sun with its radiance” (svàr ṇá bhānúnā) encodes a reference to a famous myth in which Atri rescues the sun from a supposed demon Svarbhānu. As I have argued (Jamison 1991: 264–67), Svarbhānu is actually Agni, and therefore this little hymn makes sly reference to the myth of the Sun, wounded by Agni (because of the Sun’s incest with his own daughter) and healed by Atri."},{"pageNumber":428,"pageContent":"II.94111.

The hymn’s structure defines as an omphalos verse 3, especially the second half, which contains the opaque hapax śíriṇāyām, here tentatively rendered as “(birth-)canal.” Verse 3, the mysterious center of the poem, describes the creation of fire in terms of human conception and birth and expresses the paradox that such a powerful force can be invisibly confined in the inert wood. The last verse (6) contains a pun, “with a tongue seeking speech,” applicable to both Agni and the poet: for Agni it is the flame as tongue, seeking the poet’s praise hymn; for the poet, it is his own tongue, seeking efficacious wording for the same hymn.1. Agni is invoked first on every side like a father, when he is kindled by Manu in the footprint of refreshment,dressing himself in beauty, immortal and discriminating, frequently to be groomed and worthy of fame: he is the prize-winning (steed).2.

It is also a good example of the complexity of R̥gvedic poetry. The poet uses ellipses and ambiguous reference to suggest the union of the acts of the accompanying ritual and the action of the myth. In verse 3, for example, the “resplendent” (śubhrá) ones who run to the wind are the Maruts, the gods who so often accompany Indra. But the adjective “resplendent” is also used of soma, and therefore the verse carries a second, suggested meaning that the offering of soma goes to the Wind, who receives the soma along with Indra. Or again, in verses 7–8, it appears at first as though the mountain described there is one of the mountains settled by Indra when he made the world habitable. But this mountain is described in odd ways: it does not falter; it bellows with its mothers; and it roars—descriptions that force a reconsideration of its identity. Elsewhere these epithets characterize the fire, which is “settled” by priests on the sacrificial area. Thus, the creative actions of the god and the ritual actions of the priests are placed in parallel and made reflexes of one another. For a detailed analysis of this hymn, which seeks to demonstrate its double reference to myth and ritual, see Brereton (1985).1. Hear our summons, Indra! Intend us no harm! We would be those to be given good things by you.For these nourishments, like flowing rivers, strengthen you in their quest for good things.2.

It begins with his origin (vs. 1) and then refers to his great deeds through which the world was created and made inhabitable (vss. 2–3). The poet then announces Indra’s victory over Dāsas, Dasyus, and other enemies and his aid for his worshippers and allies (vss. 4–10). Toward the end of the hymn, the poet mentions Indra’s famous victories over his demonized, if not quite demonic, enemies (vss. 11–12). Then he returns to Indra’s rule over the cosmos (vs. 13) and his help for those now making ritual offerings to him (vss. 14–15).One verse that has attracted particular attention is verse 5, which says that there are some who wonder where Indra is and who declare that Indra “does not exist.” These appear to be Vedic people who question Indra’s power and who, in deny-ing Indra and refusing to perform the rituals, approximate the Dāsas, whom Indra defeats (vs. 4). The poet insists that they should be aware of Indra as the “terrify-ing” (ghorá) one and trust in him. At the end, in 15b, after recounting his great exploits, the poet himself confidently asserts that Indra is indeed real. The reality of Indra may signify not only his existence as a powerful god, but more especially his actual presence at the poet’s sacrifice.1.

Thus, while details remain uncertain,"},{"pageNumber":435,"pageContent":"II.13418the first verses describe the soma sacrifice, seen as a creation of Indra. This ritual context is established in verse 1, in which the subject is likely the soma or the soma plant. The birth of the soma plant occurs in its proper time of year, and therefore its mother is the r̥tú, its “season.” However, the soma is also born at the proper ritual moment, and therefore its mother is also r̥tú, which can also refer to the “ritual sequence.” Then in verse 2, again without naming him, the poet introduces Indra—or apparently does so—through associating Indra’s release of the waters with the flowing, soma-bearing waters of the rite.Verses 3–4 describe the acts of the ritual, although in 4b, the identity of several of the actors is not certain. The one “who comes” could be soma or Indra or even the fire (as Geldner suggests with a different interpretation of the ellipsis). The poet turns to Indra’s heroic deeds in verse 5—although the waters which he released connect these deeds to the ritual—and then in verse 6, to an explicit description of Indra’s ritual acts. Verse 7 poses a number of interpretive difficulties, but in pāda a, the “flowering and fruitful” might be plants generally or the soma plants; in pāda b, the streams might be waters or specifically ritual waters; and in pāda d, the ūrvá, the “containers,” might refer to the oceans as containers of water in a cosmic register or the containers of soma in a ritual one.Verses 8–12 mention other of Indra’s deeds. In verse 9 Geldner suggests that Indra bound his enemies by a magically induced sleep and thus by that “which has no ropes.” See also II.15.9, where Indra conquers his enemies by putting them to sleep. Verse 12, returning to the conjunction of heroic and ritual deed and to the theme of rivers and waters, may speak not (or not only) of Indra’s rescue of a per-son who was blind and lame, but of Indra’s role in producing the soma hidden in the plant before it is pressed out (cf. II.15.7).1. His mother is the season. From her, as soon as he was born, he [=soma] entered among the waters, in whom he grows strong.Then he became a voluptuous woman, swelling with milk. The plant’s first beestings—that one is worthy of hymns.2. Toward a single goal they [=the waters] come, bringing milk throughout. They bring forth sustenance for him [=Indra?] who is all mother’s milk (for us).The downward sloping (watercourses) share the same road to flow along. You, who did these things first, are worthy of hymns.3. One [=the Hotar] accompanies what he gives with his speech. Another [=the Adhvaryu] hastens at his work, changing the forms (of the soma).He [=soma] withstands all the blows of another [=the pressing stone].

Verse 7 is particularly interesting since Kutsa (or Purukutsa), Āyu, and Atithigva Divodāsa are normally allies rather than enemies of Indra as they are here. Elsewhere (I.53.10 and VI.18.13), however, Indra appears as an ally of the little-known ruler named Tūrvayāṇa and helps him defeat these three.1. Adhvaryus! Bring the soma to Indra. With the tankards, pour here the exhilarating stalk,because the hero is ever desirous of his drink. Offer to the bull: he wishes just that.2. Adhvaryus!

In verse 5, as Geldner remarks, the reference is to the story of Turvaśa and Yadu and that of Turvīti and Vayya, whom Indra rescued from the waters. They were “non-bathers” because they could not swim through the roaring waters, but Indra held back the strong currents so that they could cross. The story in verse 6a that Indra made the síndhu, the Indus (or perhaps simply “the river”), flow backward is otherwise unknown. The story that Indra fought and defeated Dawn in 6c is mentioned elsewhere (cf. esp. IV.30.8–11), but it is unclear who the “unswift” males and “swift” females in 6c might be and why they are described as “hewn apart.” In verse 7, as in II.13.12, the verse may conceal Indra’s ritual act of bringing forth the soma. In support of this interpretation are the echoes of ritual acts also in"},{"pageNumber":439,"pageContent":"II.15422preceding verses, such as the references to the ritual seats and possibly the laying out of the ritual ground (in vs. 3) and bathing (in vs. 5). Or verse 7 may allude to Indra’s cosmogonic acts. Verse 8 refers to the Vala story, in which Indra splits the cave and freed the cattle for the Aṅgirases. In 9c, the description of an elderly man (cf. VIII.45.20) or infirm man who finds riches despite his ailments may simply underline Dabhīti’s unexpected success.1. Now I shall proclaim the great deeds of him the great one, the real acts of the real one.He drank of the pressed soma among the Trikadrukas [=the Maruts?].

The middle verses of this hymn (vss. 4–6) present Indra as the bull of the sacrifice and indeed describe all the other principal constitu-ents of the sacrifice also as bulls. The portrayal of Indra as a bull in these verses contrasts with that in verse 8, in which Indra is compared to a cow. However, this image of Indra as a cow sets up the final verse (9). In this verse, which is also the final verse of II.15–20, the poet compares the dakṣiṇā, or priestly gift he hopes to receive, to a generous cow.1. I carry forward your good praise, like an oblation into a fire being kindled, for him who is the most preeminent of beings:we call upon Indra for help—himself unaging but causing to age, a full-grown youth from of old.2.

There are several references to Indra’s youth: the time when he received his mace from his father, Tvaṣṭar (vs. 6), and when he obtained his first nurture (vs. 2). The first nurture may refer to the first soma offering in the rite and also to the first soma Indra ever drank. His origins are also the origins of the world, and the hymn catalogues his great, creative deeds: he established heaven and earth and settled the mountains (vs. 5), he opened the cave to release the cattle (vs. 1), he defeated Vr̥tra (vs. 6), and he sent the waters flow-ing (vss. 3, 5). The poet calls upon Indra to give sustenance to him just as he has received sustenance (vss. 7, 8) and to give to him a measure of wealth just as Indra showed the measure of his power in creating the world (vs. 7).Striking is pāda 6b, which says that Tvaṣṭar made Indra’s mace “from every race,” meaning from both gods and mortals, and “out of his knowledge,” per-haps his knowledge of all creatures (cf. IV.42.3, cited by Geldner although to make a different point) or alternatively, “out of their possessions.” That is to say, the weapon by which Indra performs his great deeds draws on the totality of humans and gods for its power. Oldenberg observed that the juxtaposition of the words janúṣo ve﻿́das (“race. . . knowledge [/possession]”) recalls the epithet"},{"pageNumber":442,"pageContent":"II.17425Jātavedas, which describes Agni as the continuous presence throughout the sacri-ficial day and the guarantor of the continuity of the human lineage.

As did the Aṅgirases, chant this new (chant) to him, so that his explosive powers rise up as in ancient timeswhen, through his strength and in the exhilaration of soma, he razed all the firmly fixed cow pens, enclosed on every side.2. Let him (once again) become the one who, showing the measure of his power, crossed beyond greatness to obtain the first nurture.The champion, who girded his body in battles, fastened heaven in its greatness on his head.3. Then you did the first, great heroic deed, when, at its beginning, you roused your explosive power through the poetic formulation.Spurred by the chariot-rider with his fallow bay horses, the lively (waters) flow forth separately toward the same goal.4. Then he who grew strong over all the worlds by his greatness, acting as their master, projecting his youthful vitality,after that, (becoming a) draft-horse, he spanned the two world-halves with light; upon sewing up the bilious shades of darkness, he wrapped them all together.5. Through his power, he fixed firmly the mountains sliding forward, and he made the labor of the waters to be sliding downward.He made fast the all-nurturing earth, and by his wiles he propped up the heaven (to keep it) from falling.6. That was fit for him, for his two arms—what his father made from every race and out of his knowledge—that mace by which he, with mighty roar, smashed the worm and twisted it down to lie upon the earth.7.

Indra’s chariot is also the sacrifice itself. According to Sāyaṇa, its four yokes are the four soma-pressing stones; the three whips are the three pitches used in recitation; the seven reins are the seven meters; and—the least likely of Sāyaṇa’s identifications—the ten oars are the ten planets “that rescue from evil beings” (etymologizing arítra “oar” as ari “enemy” + trā “rescue”) or the ten Camasādhvaryus. In a lengthy note Witzel and Gotō suggest other possibilities for such numbers. With regard to the world, three may be the three worlds or the three positions of the sun, four the four directions, seven the seven rivers, and so on. In relation to the sacrifice, three might be the three sacrificial fires or the three soma cups, four (or four times four) the number of priests, seven the three (fires, cups) plus the four (priests) or the seven priests mentioned in II.5.2, ten the seven (priests) plus the three (fires, cups) or ten fingers, ten fires, ten soma vessels, et cetera. All that said, however, the specific identifica-tions are less important than the possibility of finding many identifications and the generally increasing numbers (4, 3, 7, 10). These project a picture of the chariot as encompassing all aspects of the sacrifice and of the world.Verse 2 begins with another enumeration. Here the first, second, and third might be the three soma offerings of the sacrificial day or the three fires of the sacrificial ground. The second half of verse 2 turns to a key moment in the sacrifice, the birth of Agni out of the fire-kindling stick. The newly born Agni keeps company with “the others,” but once again who or what these others are is unclear: they might be the sacrificial fires, the sacrificial offerings, the gods, or even other priests. From verse 3 the poet’s attention turns especially to Indra’s chariot-horses, whose number progressively increases from two (vss. 3, 4) to a hundred (vs. 6). This increasing number suggests that these horses might correspond to an aspect of the sacrifice that carries Indra to the sacrificial area. For the poet there are few greater attrac-tions for Indra than the ritual recitations, and therefore these horses may be the words of these recitations, which like these horses multiply as the hymn is recited. Note that śate﻿́na “with a hundred” is the hundredth word of the hymn. Once again, however, the multiplication of horses is also an indication of the fluidity of this hymn’s numerology and another signal that Indra’s chariot comprehends the whole of the sacrifice and the world.1.

It begins with Indra’s great-est deed, the destruction of Vr̥tra (vss. 2–4). Although the Vr̥tra story concerns"},{"pageNumber":445,"pageContent":"II.19428principally the release of the waters, verses 4–5 connect it also with the release of the sun, which takes place “in a single day.” This may be a reference to the ritual day, since the Morning Pressing may be connected with the release of the dawns and the Midday Pressing with the release of the waters, or it may reflect the ten-dency elsewhere to fold the release of light into the effects of the Indra’s victory over Vr̥tra (cf. I.32.4). The poet then evokes Indra’s help for Kutsa and Divodāsa (vs. 6) before announcing that the Gr̥tsamadas, in exchange for their offerings, also deserve Indra’s support in overcoming their enemies.The hymn is dominated by racing imagery that describes both divine and human action. This imagery is reflected in Indra’s deeds: the waters “charge forth” after Indra destroyed Vr̥tra (vs. 2), and Indra’s horse Etaśa won wealth like the prize in a race (vs. 5). But it is reflected also in mortals’ efforts: men contend to win the sun (vs. 4d), and the sacrificers strive to win as if in a race (vs. 7).1. The drinking of this plant for exhilaration has begun, o men of inspired thought, (the drinking) of the delightful soma-pressing,at which Indra, having grown strong (thereby) from of old, has found a home, as have the men creating the poetic formulations.2. Becoming exhilarated from this honey, Indra with the mace in his hand hewed apart the serpent blocking the flood,so that the rivers’ pleasing offerings (of water) charged forth like birds toward rich fields.3. That great Indra, smasher of the serpent, roused the flood of waters forth toward the sea.He gave birth to the sun and found the cattle. He perfected the patterns of the days through the night.4. And he—(though) many and impregnable are (the obstacles) for Manu—serves his servant: he smashes Vr̥tra [/Obstacle]—he who in a single day became the unshakeable one for the men contending to win the sun.5. Receiving praise, the god Indra ceded the sun to the soma-pressing mortal,when, doing service (to him), Etaśa bore him fault-concealing wealth like a share (of a stake).6. In a single day, he subdued the voracious, barley-destroying Śuṣṇa for the charioteer Kutsa,and Indra razed the ninety and nine fortifications of Śambara for Divodāsa.7. So we have sent to you our recitation, Indra. Like those seeking fame, racing by themselves for victory’s prize,we would obtain the sevenfold (prize), panting after it.

On the other hand, the name “Indra”—and the poet draws attention to the name in verse 6—is clearly disyllabic only in the first and in the final verse. Everywhere else, a trisyllabic pronunciation will restore the meter. Again, the poet emphasizes this since in verses 2a, 3a, and 4a the vocative indra, nominative índraḥ, and accusative índram, all in the same metrical position, can be recited trisyllabically. There is also a double sandhi contraction in verse 2b, where abhiṣṭipā́ḥ asi* > abhiṣṭipā́si. Verse 2b contains a śleṣa, in which the same word can function in two different roles, since tvā́vataḥ “such as you” can be both a genitive singular with “good favor” and an accusative plural modifying “men.” Verse 2a has ūtī́ for ūtíbhiḥ. None of these forms is unprecedented in the R̥gveda, but the persistent and deliberate use of such semi-irregularities suggests that the poet has a particular purpose in employing them. Perhaps he wished to call special attention to the inspired thinking and insight (vss. 1, 2), the praises and lauds (vss. 3, 4, 5, 7), and the poetic formulations (vss. 4, 5) of the poet by using words that would in some way call attention to themselves. It is these words that Indra “makes power-ful” (vss. 5, 7).The hymn ends by contrasting the poets and their people, whom Indra helps, to the Dāsas and Dasyus, whom he defeats. Again, there may be a suggestion that what differentiates the fates of the poets and their enemies is precisely the mastery that the former have over words.The mythical references in 5cd are obscure, but they may have something to do with the conquest of darkness by light. If so, then they anticipate Indra’s victory over the Dāsa fortresses “with their dark wombs” (vs. 7).1. We bring forward vitality for you, Indra—know of us!—as one seeking victory’s prize (brings forward) a chariot,as marveling we reflect through our inspired thinking and seek to obtain (both) the good favor of one such as you and men (such as you)."},{"pageNumber":447,"pageContent":"II.214302.

In verses 4–5, the poet recalls the Vala story, in which Indra and his priestly allies obtained the cattle and the dawns through the hymns that both the priests and Indra recite. He ends with an appeal that his people will find the intel-lectual ability that will allow them both to continue to implore the gods successfully and to gain the wealth and safety that will flow from that ability.1.

Among the Trikadrukas [=the Maruts?], the buffalo, snorting mightily,drank to his satisfaction the barley-mixed soma pressed by Viṣṇu, (as much) as he wished.It exhilarated the great and broad one to do his great deed.– The god attends upon the god—the real Indu upon the real Indra.2.

As Schmidt (1968) has demonstrated, bŕ̥haspáti and bráhmanas páti “lord of the sacred formulation” are usually names of Indra in the context of the Vala myth. At times, however, Br̥haspati emerges as an independent deity, though closely linked to Indra. Here the poet once describes Br̥haspati as the “yokemate” of Indra (vs. 18), but beyond this statement, there is otherwise little to distinguish Indra and Br̥haspati.Framing the hymn’s description of Br̥haspati are overt references to the Vala myth, in which Indra as Br̥haspati leads the Aṅgirases and, by the power of their song, opens the cave that releases the cattle and dawns (vss. 2, 3, 18). The interme-diate verses expand the theme of the power of the verbal formulation, of which Br̥haspati is the master. It is by means of knowledge of the truth that Br̥haspati"},{"pageNumber":450,"pageContent":"II.23433and the poet, who possesses mastery of the truth through Br̥haspati, are able to overcome their enemies. They defeat scorners (vs. 8), slighters (vs. 13), chatterers (vs. 14), and speakers of ill (vs. 10). They overcome those who hate the real for-mulations of the truth (vs. 4), who lay snares (vs. 6), and who are deceitful (vss. 5, 16, 17). Perhaps because of his powerful speech, Br̥haspati’s mouth even “snaps at” the poet’s enemies (vs. 9). At least in some instances, the rivals of the poet are rival sacrificers. At best, however, these know the words to recite, but not the truth that produces the songs or that lies behind them (vs. 16). Through the truth and the truth formulations, the poet and his people are freed from distress (vs. 4), hostility (vss. 5, 9), and injury (vss. 7, 8, 12) and instead prosper (vss. 10, 15).1.

Lord of the sacred formulation, become the guide of this hymn and give life to our lineage.All that is fortunate which the gods aid. – May we speak loftily at the ritual distribution, in possession of good heroes.II.24 (215) Br̥haspatiGr̥tsamada16 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 12, 16As Schmidt (1968: 230–37) points out in his translation and extensive analysis of this hymn, the poet frames his hymn with references to the Vala myth in verses 2–7 and 14. The poet does expand the scope of the myth, however, since the cave contains not only cattle (vss. 3, 14), but also the sun (vss. 3, 9) and honey and water (vs. 4). In verses 3 and 14 the cows likely refer also to the dawns. Inside of this frame, the poet describes the present, in which Br̥haspati inspires the sacrificial hymns and receives the sacrificial offerings. These present events are partly blended with mythical ones. In verse 8, for example, the present hymns created by Br̥haspati are his arrows, but this description of words as arrows recalls the ancient heroic deeds of Br̥haspati and Indra. More explicitly, in verse 9cd Br̥haspati’s victory causes the sun to blaze, which echoes the release of the dawns in the Vala myth. And in verse 10 both gods and humans receive nourishment through the ritual offerings and the goods won by him.This blending of the mythic and the present may also occur in the opening verses of the hymn. Where later verses refer to the present but echo the past, in verses 2–7 the overtly mythic events occasionally suggest present ritual acts. In verse 4 the cis-tern “containing streams of honey,” which Br̥haspati opens and from which all living beings drink, recalls the ritual cups with their soma-honey. Priests are the heroes of the battle in verses 6 and 7, and again this recalls the present ritual action of priests. Such double reference may contribute to the obscurity of the most difficult verse in the hymn, verse 5. A number of interpreters, such as Witzel and Gotō, understand pādas ab to mean that from ancient times “these beings,” either the waters or the cattle, were destined to come forth, but for a long time the door was shut on them. That is to say, the basic reference is to the Vala myth, as in its surrounding verses. On one level, this interpretation is surely right: there likely is a reference to the Vala myth. At the same time, the poet’s extraordinary obscurity suggests that he may have more in mind, and indeed pāda a explicitly connects past and present. The verse may suggest the idea that what has happened in the past happens again, and therefore the action of Br̥haspati is again necessary to free the cattle or the waters.1. Help this offering, since you are its master—with this new, great song we would make the ritual distribution—and, Br̥haspati, bring our thought to success, so that your companion [=Indra], who grants rewards to us, will be praised."},{"pageNumber":453,"pageContent":"II.244362.

The first three-quarters of each verse then specifies the ways in which this mortal thrives, especially in winning battles and besting his enemies. The first hemistich of the first verse makes it clear that the fortunate man in question has won the favor of Brahmaṇaspati by ritual activity, and especially by mak-ing his own sacred formulations (bra﻿́hman), though the ritual context is not mentioned again.1. Kindling the fire, he will win against those who seek to win.

However, II.26 lacks the refrain found in II.25, and it also varies the 3rd-person description of the favored mortal with a 2nd-person address to the same mortal in verse 2. The series of abrupt imperatives in that verse enlivens the hymn.Unlike II.25, where the importance of ritual activity is established in the first half-verse but not mentioned again, this hymn constantly emphasizes the power that the performance of the sacrifice gives to the sacrificer, in contrast to the impi-ous man, who is weaker by nature, even if he is a good warrior.1.

They have the power to protect because they are gods who govern the world and the heavens according to the truth, which defines the order and nature of things as they are and ought to be (vss. 8–10). The poet then returns once more to the theme of a journey protected by the Ādityas and looks forward to his finding a place to settle, a place of good pasturage (vs. 13) and a place that is open and secure (vs. 14). The poet insists that he is worthy of the Ādityas’ protection: like the gods themselves (vss. 2, 9), he is śúci “gleaming, pure” (vs. 13), free of any taint. And if he has committed any offense, he begs the Ādityas’ mercy (vs. 14) and hopes that he would never fall to the punishments of the Ādityas (vs. 16). The meaning of verse 15cd is not quite clear. The two dwelling places mentioned there could be heaven and earth, to which pādas ab refer, or possibly, as Geldner suggests, to opposing sides from whose conflict the poet hopes to benefit.1. These ghee-backed songs I pour out to the Ādityas, kings from of old, with my tongue (as offering ladle).Let each one hear us: Mitra, Aryaman, and Bhaga, mighty-born Varuṇa, Dakṣa, and Aṃśa.2.

The ellipses in the first verse point to Varuṇa’s double role in this hymn. “This belonging to the Āditya sage poet” is in the first instance the hymn itself that is being recited for the god. The poet hopes that his hymn will dominate all things, or, perhaps better, be dominant over all other hymns. At the same time, “this” is also the god’s own commandment, which the poet describes in the hymn and which dominates everything in the world. Varuṇa’s function as a speaker is underscored by the description of him as a kaví “sage poet” since a kaví is one who knows and who speaks, and as mandrá “pleasing,” which frequently characterizes the Hotar priest, who recites the hymns. Verse 2 carries for-ward the argument, mentioning both the commandment of the god and the insights of the poet. The poet calls upon Varuṇa to keep him safe from various threats (vss. 3, 6, 10), interspersing his petition with pleas not to fall victim to the punishment from the god for his misdeeds (vss. 5, 7, 9). Toward the end of the hymn, the poet once again calls attention both to his own speech and also to the commandment spoken by the god (vs. 8), thus returning to the initial theme of the hymn.1. Let this belonging to the Āditya sage poet, the independent king, dominate all existing things in its greatness—"},{"pageNumber":459,"pageContent":"II.28442(this belonging to) the god who excels as the pleasing one for the sacrifice.

It appears between two All God hymns, although in its number of verses (eleven), it is out of order, since both II.29 and II.31 have seven verses. There is no easy way to adjust this discrepancy.The first part of the hymn (vss. 1–3) presents, however obliquely, the story of the Indra–Vr̥tra battle, but it leads up to the battle with a timeless or contemporary image. It describes the current daily rushing of waters (waters implicitly identified, as commonly, with the dawns), and then asks when the waters first began to surge. The unexpressed answer is—only when they were released after Indra’s defeat of Vr̥tra. Verse 2 has been interpreted in multiple ways, and many difficulties remain. Interestingly, it contains the first and almost the only example of a conditional verb in Vedic, and the isolation of this grammatical form makes the interpretation of the verse more difficult. In the tentative interpretation given here, the verse concerns an unidentified figure (possibly Sūrya, who is sometimes an opponent of Indra), who was planning to give aid to Vr̥tra in the battle (pāda a), but (pāda b) his plan was detected and announced by an unidentified female figure (possibly Earth, possibly Indra’s mother) to yet another unidentified figure (possibly Indra), thus foiling the plan. The verse pivots in pāda c, which can have reference both to the mythological past—the free flowing of the waters after their release on the killing of Vr̥tra and their creation of paths for Indra—and to the timeless daily round—the continual (re-)creation of paths for the sun by the dawns, since the formula in 2c is also some-times used exactly of this situation. Thus the second half of verse 2 returns us to the timeless daily realm of verse 1 and the double interpretation of waters and dawns. The third and last verse about the Vr̥tra battle (vs. 3) is much more straightforward, and may have been designed to resolve for the audience what the topic of the first two, obscurely phrased, verses was.The rest of the hymn begs the gods, particularly Indra but, as the hymn pro-gresses, other gods, to use the same powers that led to victory in the Vr̥tra battle to combat the poet’s enemies. The importance of sacrifice in winning the gods’ favor is emphasized in verses 6–7.The hymn contains some striking expressions, for instance the “night” of the waters in verse 1: the image evoked may be a naturalistic one, that waters in full flow can appear dark, but with the identification waters = dawns the image can also describe the progress from night/darkness to dawn. Note also that the phrase “every day” defines the hymn as a ring composition, though it has different lexi-cal realizations in verse 1 (áhar-ahar) and as the last word of the last verse 11 (divé-dive)."},{"pageNumber":462,"pageContent":"II.304451.

The controlling chariot image in turn gives rise to other comparisons, as when in verse 1 charioteers sitting on the wooden chariot are compared with birds sitting in trees.The word “those seeking fame” (śravasyávaḥ) defines the hymn as a ring compo-sition, as it occurs in both the initial and final verses, and the middle verses, 3–5, all open with utá syá [/tyá] “and this,” a cluster that marks a simple omphalos. Though most of the hymn is relatively straightforward, the end of the final omphalos verse, 5d, is difficult and has elicited several different interpretations.The designation “all gods” as the dedicand of the hymn is quite accurate: a wide variety of gods and divinized powers are addressed in the hymn and begged for help.1.

The first three verses seem to belong together, addressing first Heaven and Earth (vs. 1) and then an unidentified male divinity (2–3), while the remaining five verses are addressed to various female divinities who are especially concerned with childbirth.

Only three complete R̥gvedic hymns are dedi-cated to him (I.114 and VII.46, in addition to this one, as well as two hymns conjointly dedicated to Rudra and Soma, I.43 and VI.74). He is known espe-cially as the father of the Maruts, and he has a dual nature: on the one hand, he is prone to anger and quick to dispatch his weapons, especially his arrows, at those who enrage him; on the other, he is a provider of healing remedies and of good luck.The major part of this hymn is devoted to begging the god Rudra for his indul-gence and his healing powers, but it also nervously expresses the hope that his venge-ful assaults will be directed elsewhere. The dual nature of Rudra as both healer and avenger is thus on display, and his parentage of the Maruts begins the hymn (vs. 1) and is mentioned several times in the course of it.1. Let your favor come here, o father of the Maruts. Do not keep us away from the sight of the sun.The hero on horseback should be indulgent.

About midway through the hymn (starting in vss. 6–7), the focus shifts to the benefits the Maruts can provide the singer, in inspiring his hymn, protecting him against enemies, and offering gifts. The naturalistic description remains, however; note, for example, the sequential imagery in verse 13, which proceeds from thunder, through lightning and rain, to the post-storm clearing and rainbow.The hymn also contains a reference (vs. 2) to the enigmatic and sometimes para-doxical parentage and birth of the Maruts from Pr̥śni and Rudra. The motif of the cow, especially the milk-cow with her swollen udder, runs through the hymn (e.g., vss. 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12), with reference sequentially or simultaneously to dawns, clouds, the sacrificer’s soma-pressings, and the Maruts’ gift to him. This multivalent image helps to unify the hymn as it moves from naturalistic description to ritual entreaty.1.

This divine name is also found identically in Avestan, but in the R̥gveda it is in the course of becoming an epithet of Agni. In this hymn we see aspects both of the identification with and assimilation to Agni and of the original independent divinity.After an opening (vss. 1–2) in which the poet in the 1st person offers his praise to the divinity, the heart of the hymn (3–11) describes his birth, care, and feeding by women, who at least in the early verses are the Waters, in sometimes enigmatic phrasing.The fiery aspect of Apām Napāt is introduced gradually in the hymn, first by the use of vocabulary regularly but not exclusively used elsewhere of Agni, for exam-ple the “shining” words (vss. 3–4); as the hymn continues, vocabulary and imagery point more and more strongly to fire, for example the twigs and plants in verse 8, the emphasis on golden color in verses 9–10. But it is not until the second half of verse 11 that unambiguous reference to physical fire is found (the verb “kindle” as well as the identification of ghee as his food—though ghee first made its appear-ance in verse 4). It is doubtless no accident that the first half of verse 11 announces Apām Napāt as his “secret name”: this explicit reference confirms that the poem heretofore has been framed as a riddle or enigma, for which “Apām Napāt” is the solution. (Verse 13 also codes the same distinction between the originally separate identities of Apām Napāt and Agni, by connecting the name Apām Napāt with “the body of another,” namely Agni.)After the climactic verse 11, the hymn then takes a more ritual turn, and the 1st-person ritualist of verse 1 returns in verse 12. In this ritualistic section, the para-dox of Apām Napāt being nurtured by the waters and his double, Agni, being nur-tured by the fire-tenders is resolved (or the images are superimposed) by having the waters bring ghee to him.1. I, seeking prizes, have set loose my eloquence. The offspring of the rivers should take delight in my hymns.The Child of the Waters who impels swift (horses)—surely he will make them well-ornamented?

As was clearly seen already by Oldenberg (1888: 193), II.36–37 in fact themselves form a single hymn, not only because of their shared ritual content but also because at six verses apiece, they violate the rule of maṇḍala organization, whereby hymns within a single group contain descending number of verses. II.36–37 fall between a hymn of fifteen verses and one of eleven; when combined, their twelve verses fit perfectly in the sequence.Each verse identifies a different god (or groups of gods) and the priest whose duty it is to make the offering. Several of the verses are structured as riddles, with the name of the god either suppressed or postponed until near the end; the audi-ence would have had no trouble solving these riddles, since the vocabulary and the actions are stereotyped for each god. (Our solutions to such riddles are given at the end of the verses in question.) Nonetheless, II.36–37 show rhetorical ambitions almost entirely absent from the bare-bones and poetically inert I.15.In this hymn Indra is honored twice (vss. 1 and 5) but by two different priests, and in the second instance it is probably Indra in the guise of Br̥haspati. In both these verses the exhilarating drink soma, Indra’s special potion, is also referred to in a riddling fashion. For further discussion of the ritual and its litany, see I.15.1.

In that latter hymn, as in this one, four verses are devoted to the offerings to the shadowy figure of the Wealth-Giver (Draviṇodā); these verses may be there merely to bring the number of offerings to twelve, to correspond with the secondary interpretation of r̥tú as season, and hence to match the number of offerings to the months of the year, as discussed in the introduction to I.15.1.

The hymn is closely analyzed by Falk (1988), who argues that the occasion of the hymn is the evening of the summer sol-stice, which marked the beginning of the rainy season. According to Falk, in the sec-ond millennium BCE on this night the Milky Way rose from the horizon at dusk. The arc of the Milky Way, he says, was pictured as the outstretched arms of Savitar. Be that as it may, most of the images in the hymn are applicable to evening in general.The first six verses present a lovely series of images of the quiet and rest that evening brings to the natural and the human world—almost ironically because the daily round of busy movement ceases at the “impulsion” of the “Impeller” (the literal meaning of Savitar). In the following two verses (7–8), Savitar’s ability to bring each creature to its home place at night is extended: he also has assigned to all categories of creatures their proper position in the natural world. The remainder of the hymn celebrates the power of Savitar even over the gods (vs. 9) and asks for his gifts (10–11). The latter verse makes reference to Savitar’s distribution of beings to their separate realms by asking for gifts from heaven, the waters, and the earth. Savitar’s apportioning of benefits in these last verses return us to the theme of the first verse (1cd), which announced his gifts to gods and to the mortal sacrificer.1. God Savitar has stood up to impel again as always—the draft-horse whose work this is—"},{"pageNumber":474,"pageContent":"II.38457for now he distributes treasure to the gods, and he has also given a share in well-being to him whose oblations are worth pursuing.2.

He avoids the monotony that might otherwise result both by the cleverness of his similes and by the occasional pun, in which a descriptive word fits the object in the simile in one meaning but the target, the Aśvins, in another. In verse 2, for example, jáneṣu “in the presence of the people” or “peoples” refers to witnesses at a wedding in the simile, but in the target phrase they are the tribes who perceive the united resolve of the Aśvins. Or again, in verse 7a, within the simile the word śaktí probably refers to a “spear,” but in the target it is the “power” of the Aśvins. In 7b, the rájāṃsi are all the spaces gathered between heaven and earth in the simile, but regions given by the Aśvins, through which the poet and his people can wander, in the target phrase. In verse 1, jarethe, here translated “you awaken,” could equally well mean “you sing,” especially since the pressing stones elsewhere are said to “sing.”Another feature of the hymn is that the poet often describes the Aśvins as vari-ously beneficial for one’s tanū́, one’s “body” or simply “oneself.” Normally we might take the word as a reflexive, but the poet compares the Aśvins to various limbs and makes direct reference to bodies, so we have kept the stronger reference to the body in the translation.In verse 7—the last verse of the poem proper since verse 8 is a signature verse standing outside it—there is a final simile. This is the only one in which the object is not in the dual and not compared to the Aśvins. Rather the object, an axe, is in the singular and compared to “these songs” chanted for the Aśvins. This twist at the end thus breaks the pattern of the hymn and marks its conclusion.1. Like pressing stones, you two awaken to just this purpose: like vultures toward a tree, (you awaken to go) toward what provides hidden treasures (of honey);like formulators, you recite hymns at the ritual distribution; like messengers, you, serving your people, are to be called upon in many places.2.

The hymn has been assembled from the three-verse units known as tr̥cas. It is also of mixed meter, though gāyatrī prevails for most of the hymn (vss. 1–15 and 19–21).Nonetheless, with the exception of the final three verses (19–21), the hymn forms a ritual unity, treating in order the gods addressed in a structured recitation form-ing part of the Morning Pressing, which is found also in later Vedic śrauta ritual, known as the Praügaśastra. Other instantiations of this recitation in the Ṛgveda are found in I.2–3 (see remarks there) and I.23. The order of divinities is Vāyu (1–2), Indra-Vāyu (3), Mitra-Varuṇa (4–6), Aśvins (7–9), Indra (10–12), the All Gods (13–15), Sarasvatī (16–18). The last three verses (19–21) are, according to Oldenberg (1888: 197 and n. 4), an independent tr̥ca, relating to the carts holding the oblation (havirdhāna carts), that was mistakenly incorporated into the hymn. Even if this last tr̥ca was a late addition, it is worth noting that the first and last verses of the hymn end with the word so﻿́mapītaye “for soma-drinking,” forming at least a nominal ring.1. O Vāyu, the chariots in thousands that are yours—with them come here,you with your teams, for soma-drinking.2. You with your teams, Vāyu, come here.

Of the sixty-two hymns in the maṇḍala, the Anukramaṇī states that Viśvāmitra himself composed all or parts of forty-six, along with two others that might be his or that might belong to another poet (III.31, 38). The Anukramaṇī attributes four hymns in the Agni series (III.19–22) to Viśvāmitra’s father, Gāthin Kauśika, and one Indra hymn (III.31) either to Viśvāmitra or to his grandfather, Kuśika Aiṣīrathi. Vaiśvāmitras, Viśvāmitra’s sons or descendants, are also represented in the maṇḍala: Kata (III.17–18), R̥ṣabha (III.13–14), and possi-bly Prajāpati (III.38, 54–56), as is one grandson, Utkīla Kātya (III.15–16), the son of Kata Vaiśvāmitra. Outside of III, a few verses (IX.67.13–15; X.137.5) and one jointly composed hymn (X.167) are also attributed to Viśvāmitra. Likewise, other Vaiśvāmitras appear among the composers of hymns in IX and X: Madhuchandas (IX.1), Reṇu (IX.70, X.89), Aṣṭaka (X.104), and Pūraṇa (X.160). Among the remaining poets of III mentioned by the Anukramaṇī are Devaśravas Bhārata and D evavāta Bhārata, who, it says, together composed the Agni hymn, III.23. The Anukramaṇī’s attribution may be drawn from the hymn itself, which mentions the two. However, the Bhārata king Sudās was the patron of Viśvāmitra, and the inclu-sion of a hymn ostensibly by two Bhāratas may reflect the close connection between the clans of the poet and the king.The Viśvāmitra collection is dominated by hymns to Agni (1–29) and to Indra (30–53). It concludes with four hymns to the All Gods (54–57) and single hymns to the Aśvins (58), Mitra (59), the R̥bhus (60), and Dawn (61). The hymn to Mitra is the only hymn dedicated solely to this god in the R̥gveda and perhaps shows a special affinity between Mitra and his partial namesake, Viśvāmitra. The last hymn (62) is a collection of tr̥cas to six different deities or pairs of deities, including some not otherwise represented in the maṇḍala. The hymn would not be especially noteworthy, except that verse 10, dedicated to Savitar, is the Gāyatrī mantra, the best-known verse in the R̥gveda.Within the Agni series is a hymn (III.8) to the sacrificial post or posts, to which sacrificial animals would have been tied. Also in this series is a hymn (III.12) to the dual divinities, Indra and Agni. They are brought together here because Agni, representing the sacrifice, and Indra, representing the warriors, jointly lead the "},{"pageNumber":482,"pageContent":"III.1465clans’ victorious march across the rivers. Another unusual Agni hymn is III.26, which follows the process of kindling the sacrificial fire and anticipates the later Āgnimāruta śastra. In the Indra series, a historically and literarily significant hymn is III.33, which addresses the Rivers, Viśvāmitra himself, and Indra, and which the Anukramaṇī attributes to the Rivers and Viśvāmitra. The reason for the Anukramaṇī’s attribution is that this hymn is a dialogue between Viśvāmitra and the Vipāś and Śutudrī Rivers. The poet approaches the Rivers and asks them to stop in order to allow the Bhāratas to cross. These two rivers are the modern Beas and Sutlej, which are part of the Indus river complex, and crossing these rivers may mark a raid, seasonal migration, or resettlement from the west toward the east. In III.33, which likely marks a later period in the Bhāratas’ migration, they are in the area of the Sarasvatī, Dr̥ṣadvatī, and Āpayā rivers, and although the identification of these rivers is controversial, they probably place the Bhāratas in Kurukṣetra, east of the Vipāś and Śutudrī. Also in the Indra series is a cosmogonic hymn, III.38, which describes the origin of the material of creation and the division of that mate-rial into names and forms. Like the even more famous X.129, the hymn compares the creativity that founded the world to the creativity of the poet. The last hymn of the Indra series and a supplement to it is III.53, which is a praise of Viśvāmitra and his family and of King Sudās and the Bhāratas, whom they serve.One of the distinctive characteristics of this maṇḍala is that its poets mark seven of its Agni hymns (1, 5, 6, 7, 15, 22, and 23) and twelve of its Indra hymns (30, 31, 32, 34, 35, 36, 38, 39, 43, 48, 49, and 50) with a final verse that identifies the hymn as a Vaiśvāmitra creation. Other poetic families also have such signature verses, but the Viśvāmitras have one for their Agni hymns and a different one for the Indra hymns.III.1 (235) AgniViśvāmitra Gāthina23 verses: triṣṭubhIn our interpretation, Agni opens the hymn with a declaration that the priests have kindled him to carry the oblations. The poet and the priests then confirm that they have indeed laid the fire to begin the rite. Implied in the first two verses is thus the birth of the sacrificial fire, and the birth of Agni then becomes the central theme of the hymn. The first part of the hymn (vss. 3–14) reflects not only on the birth of the ritual fire, but also on Agni’s ultimate birth from the waters. Indeed, throughout much of the first half of the hymn, the verses can be taken as describing either the birth of the ritual fire or the ultimate birth of Agni or both. The poem thus merges Agni’s original or ultimate birth among the waters and his birth here in the sacrifice to the accompaniment of the priestly recitations. This poetic strategy complicates the translation and interpretation of the hymn. For example, verse 4 refers to the “seven young women,” who are also the mares who tend to Agni (4cd) and who"},{"pageNumber":483,"pageContent":"III.1466reappear again in verses 6 and 9. In verse 4 these seven women are likely the riv-ers, as Geldner rightly notes, but in verse 6 they are identified, unexpectedly, as the voices of the seven priests of the soma rite. Retrospectively, therefore, we can view these women as both the rivers and the voices. Similarly in verse 11 the “kindred sisters” might be the rivers, or they might again be the voices of the priests.The identity of Agni’s father also complicates the story of Agni’s birth. In verse 10 Agni gives rise to Agni, and therefore Agni is also his own father. But then who is the father in verse 9? Geldner and Renou think that his father there is Heaven, Heaven’s udder the raincloud, and therefore the fire here is lightning. More likely, however, the reference is to the ritual fire. If so, then the father in verse 9 might be the priest churning the fire, the udder his voice, and the udder’s “spurts and streams” the words of the priest. Or, again in light of verse 10, the father might be Agni, who nurtures himself through the “spurts and streams” of his spreading flames. Or, just as in the case of the “seven young women,” the poet may intend several of these possibilities.As Geldner notes, from verse 15 the poet more unambiguously addresses the ritual fire, though he does return to the theme of Agni’s births in verse 20. This time, though, the reference may be not only to the ultimate origins of Agni but also and primarily to the ritual fires of long ago and the ritual fire of the present.1. [Agni:] “You have made me your draft-horse, who am mighty from soma—(saying,) ‘Convey (the oblations), o Agni’—in order (for me) to offer the sacrifice at the ritual distribution.”[The poet:] “As you shine toward the gods—I harness the stone and I labor, o Agni—take delight in your own body.”2. [The priests:] “We have made the sacrifice turned to the east (in order to begin). Let our song become strong.” (So saying) they befriend Agni with kindling wood and with reverence.From heaven they [=the gods?] have directed the ritual distributions of the sages. They have sought the way for (Agni), even for the clever and mighty one.3.

The poet begins by announcing that the priests are creating the dhiṣáṇā, the “Holy Place” for the fire. The meaning and etymology of dhiṣáṇā are not transparent, but it is synchronically associated with the root √dhā “place, establish”—allowing the reference to the Holy"},{"pageNumber":486,"pageContent":"III.2469Place of fire to be carried through this hymn by the frequent use of derivatives of √dhā (vss. 2, 5, 7, 8, 9, 13, and 15, echoed in vs. 6 when √dhā is used not to describe the placement of fire but the establishment of wealth for the sacrificers). The placement of fire is also connected to the words of the priests. The chanters “bring together” Agni as their Hotar (vs. 1); gods originally gave rise to Agni through their “insights” (vs. 3); and Agni flourishes “through our good thoughts” (vs. 12). The close con-nection between the words of the sacrificial performers and the kindling of fire is reflected in the poet’s description of Agni as a kaví, a sage poet (vss. 4, 7, 10).This hymn also explicitly describes or refers to the rites surrounding fire, some-times connecting them with the character of the god Agni and often his role as Vaiśvānara, the sun. In 4d, for example, the poet puns on rā́jantam, which can describe Agni as both “ruling” (as it is translated there) and “shining” with his heavenly flame as fire is kindled. In verse 9 the three kindling sticks may refer to the three fires set to the west, south, and east that surround the sacrificial area, which represents the earth. Thus Agni as the ritual fires around the sacrificial ground is also Agni as the sun, which encircles the earth. And in verse 12, as Geldner rightly remarks, the course of Agni is both the course of the sun and the paryagnikaraṇa, the rite of carrying the fire around the sacrificial animal.At the end of the hymn, having set the fire in place, the poet turns to the Fire to beg for easy travel, for the prizes of victory in the sacrificial contest, and for wealth.1. We give birth to the Holy Place for Vaiśvānara, who grows strong through the truth, like purified ghee for Agni.Once again, as an axe brings together a chariot, the chanters (bring together) with their insight the Hotar [=Agni], (who was) also (the Hotar) of Manu.2. He made both world-halves shine through his birth. He became the son to be invoked by his two parents [=Heaven and Earth?].Agni is the conveyor of oblations, unaging and placed for delight, difficult to deceive, the guest of the clans, rich in radiance.3. In accordance with their will and upon the broad foundation of their skill and power to surpass, the gods gave birth to Agni through their insights.I speak to the great one, shining with his radiance and his light, as one who wants to win the prize (speaks) to his steed.4. Wanting to win it, we choose the desirable, audacious, verse-worthy prize of the delighting (Agni),the gift of the Bhr̥gus, the fire-priest with a poet’s resolve—Agni (himself), who rules with his heavenly flame.5. With twisted ritual grass, the peoples have placed Agni in front, him who brings fame as a prize, for the sake of his favor,and with offering ladle extended, they (have placed) him, brightly shining, belonging to all the gods, the Rudra of the sacrifices, bringing success to the offerings of the (ritual) workers."},{"pageNumber":487,"pageContent":"III.24706.

The movement between Agni as the sacrificial fire and as the sun is announced in the first verse: Agni befriends the gods, and he also maintains the integrity of the sacrifice for humans. Because he belongs to both gods and mortals, Agni moves between the two world-halves, the sphere of the gods in heaven and the place of mortals on earth—a theme repeated in verses 2, 4, 6, and 10. Some of the more enigmatic aspects of this hymn may reflect the location of Agni in both heaven and earth and the unity of Agni as sacrificial fire and as the sun. In verse 8 Agni’s simultaneous connection to gods and mortals reaches a climax, in which it is not clear which of the two is being talked about. Who or what is being strengthened? Is it the gods, the kin of Manu, the sacrifice, or even Agni himself ? In verse 2 Agni’s “lofty dwelling place” could refer both to the place of the sun in heaven or the place of the sacrificial fire.A special mystery concerns the last verse of the hymn, verse 11. In 11b, following the suggestion of Geldner, we have taken Agni as the subject, and Agni’s semen as the suppressed object. The reference, he suggests, is the mystery and paradox of Agni as his own father, which is also found in III.2. The image is an unusual one, but sev-eral elements of verse 11 suggest that it is Agni’s semen (rétas) that “flows on high.” First, rétas is both present in pāda d and suggested by √rī “flow” in pāda b. Second, that which is “flowing on high” in pādas ab results in Agni’s birth in cd. Finally, the ellipsis of the object, which occurs between br̥hád / áriṇād, is solved in pāda d by bhū́ri-retasā “having abundant semen,” which echoes br̥hád / áriṇād phonologically and thereby suggests “semen” as the missing object. The mystery also brings back the theme of the Agni as sun and as sacrificial fire, since the fire who is single and who makes semen flow on high is likely the sun. In any case, that theme is restated in the last lines, which identify the parents of Agni as both Heaven and Earth.1. To honor Vaiśvānara of broad visage, our inspired words offer him treasures so that he goes upon strong supports.Since immortal Agni befriends the gods, therefore, from of old, he has never corrupted the foundations (of the sacrifice).2.

His advent inspires the recitations of the priests and Agni himself grows stronger through those recitations and through the rites, if Geldner has rightly identified “the many manifestations of truth” in verse 2 as the acts of the sacrifice. The poet’s major theme, though, is the identification of Agni with various deities whose functions intersect with those of Agni. In verse 4 and briefly reprised toward the end of the hymn in verse 9, Agni is Mitra, the god of alliances, because his kindling marks the re-creation of the alliance between gods and mortals through the performance of the sacrifice. Agni’s identification with the Adhvaryu, the priest in charge of the action of the rite, follows from his role as Mitra. In 4d, however, the appella-tive sense of mitrá “ally” comes to the fore, and Agni is not only part of the rite and household, but the ally of the rivers and mountains, all the territories of the earth. More unusually, in verse 4 he is also identified in his form as Jātavedas as Varuṇa, the god of commandments. Neither Agni’s identification as Jātavedas nor his authority to command are central to this hymn, so the introduction of Varuṇa here is the result of Varuṇa’s close connection with Mitra, and Jātavedas, although normally a name of Agni, is here semiautonomous from him, like Tanūnapāt in the previous hymn.Verses 5 and 6, occupying the mysterious middle of the hymn, are the most difficult. Verse 5ab might continue from 4d, proclaiming that the highest limits of the earth and even the sky are governed by Agni. Alternatively, the “summit’s tip” could be the reach of the sacrificial fire and the track of the bird could be the track of the sun. In the latter case the verses connect two forms of Agni as the sacrificial"},{"pageNumber":492,"pageContent":"III.5475fire and as the sun. In verse 6 Agni is identified with another deity, R̥bhu or the R̥bhu, the craftsman, who, like Agni, is also a priest. The “hide of the grain” is puzzling, but as also in IV.7.7, it might refer to the ritual grass and the “track of the bird” again to Agni as the sun, appearing during the kindling of the morning sacrificial fire.Verse 7 once more takes up the theme of the birth of Agni. His parents might be Heaven and Earth, as Sāyaṇa and other interpreters suggest, or, more likely, the two fire-churning sticks, which are Agni’s new parents with his every birth. Once Agni is born, the plants—the kindling chips—nurture him and he becomes strong in the lap of his parents. Then in verse 9 Agni, now flaring up, appears both in heaven as the sun and in the sacrificial area, the navel of the earth, as the fire of the sacrifice. The poem ends with one last identification: Agni is Mātariśvan, the fire-bringer, for fire gives rise to fire.1. In response to the dawns, the ever more visible Agni has awakened, the inspired (priest), trail-blazer for the poets.He of broad visage, kindled by those seeking the gods, as the draft-horse (of the oblations), has opened the doors of darkness.2. To be revered through recitations, Agni has grown still stronger through the praises and songs of the praise singers.Delighting in the many manifestations of truth, the messenger has flared forth at the shining out of dawn.3. Agni has been installed among the clans of the sons of Manu—the embryo of the waters and Mitra bringing success through the truth.Beloved and worthy of the sacrifice, he has mounted the back (of the altar), and has become the inspired (priest) to be invoked by our thoughts.4. Agni becomes Mitra when he is kindled. As the Hotar, he is Mitra; as Jātavedas, Varuṇa.As the vigorous Adhvaryu and the lord of the household, he is Mitra, the Mitra of the rivers and mountains.5. He protects the summit’s [?] tip dear to him and the track of the bird. The young one protects the course of the sun.Agni protects the seven-headed (chant?) in the navel (of the sacrifice). Towering, he protects the exhilarating (soma?) of the gods.6. The R̥bhu [=Agni] created for himself the beloved name (of R̥bhu) to be invoked, since he is the god who knows all the ritual patterns.The hide of the grain and the track of the bird, (each) covered in ghee—just that does Agni guard, never lapsing.7.

Agni, let this your favor be for us.III.6 (240) AgniViśvāmitra Gāthina11 verses: triṣṭubhFrom its beginning, this hymn signals Agni’s dual roles as priest and ritual fire and as fire on earth and fire among the gods. The first verse contains a sustained śleṣa, a word, or in this case a gapped word, with a double sense. The gapped feminine noun is probably the juhū́, the sacrificial ladle with which the butter offerings are poured in the fire. But she can also be the tongue of the poet—not so incidentally, another meaning of the word juhū́—or even the speech of the poets. If one of the two latter, then dakṣiṇāvā́ṭ can mean not or not only “conveying to the right” but also, as Geldner suggests, “conveying the priestly gift” (dakṣiṇā) to the Hotar Agni. Similarly, in verse 2, the draft-horses are primarily the flames of Agni, but they can also be the priests of the sacrifices.From verse 3 the poet launches into his principal theme: the position of Agni himself as the intermediary between gods and humans, himself a kind of divine śleṣa, who is simultaneously a Hotar for humans and a Hotar for the gods. The references to Heaven and Earth (vss. 3, 4) or to the “two world-halves” (vss. 5, 10) point toward his role as intermediary between earth and heaven. Similarly, in verse 7 Agni appears as both the heavenly fire, the sun, and as the earthly fire of the sacrifice. Reflecting his double manifestation, the first line of this verse could mean that Agni shines either as the earthly fire “to heaven” or as the sun “from heaven.”"},{"pageNumber":494,"pageContent":"III.64771.

The poet creates this obscurity by rarely directly identifying the objects concerned, but rather refer-ring to them through metaphors, especially of mares and bulls. One reason the poet chooses this approach may be because he is simultaneously describing and thus interconnecting three realities relevant to the morning ritual: the priests and their activity, the appearance of the sacrificial fire and thus of the god Agni, and the ris-ing of the sun, which is another form of Agni.Neither space nor certainty allows us to unpack all of the poet’s metaphors, but the following brief discussion of a few can illustrate the complexity and pos-sibilities of the poet’s imagery. Geldner suggests that the seven voices in verse 1 may be the seven rivers (as in III.1.6), but they might also be the voices of the seven priests of the soma rite. Agni’s “mother and father” might be Earth and Heaven—especially since his parents are probably Heaven and Earth in pāda c. But they could also be the two fire-churning sticks, the aráṇis, in which case mātárā might better be “the two mothers.” If the mātárā are both Earth and Heaven and the churning sticks, then the poet may be deliberately exploiting the paradox that Agni, the ritual fire, is the child of the churning sticks, and Agni, perhaps as the sun, is the child of Heaven and Earth. In verse 2 Sāyaṇa among others reasonably understands the mares to be the waters, but we suggest that they might be, or again also be, Agni’s flames or rays of the sun. If we follow these latter interpretations, then the “single cow” might be the sun, although this identification is doubtful since the sun is not otherwise a cow or even female. The choice of such an image for the sun, if it is such, might have been motivated by the image of the flames as mares and milk-cows. Alternatively, Geldner thinks the single cow is probably the sacrificial ladle, which is certainly possible. The “seers,” who are the likely subject in verse 5 and who appear again in verse 7, may be the saptarṣayaḥ “seven seers,” the seven stars of the Big Dipper, and in both verses they may also be the seven priests of the soma rite. As Kiehnle (1979: 83) has observed, it is because they may be stars in verse 7 that vípra “inspired” can also have the more literal sense of “quivering,” that is, “twin-kling.” Also in verse 7 the young bulls may be the flames of Agni (so Oldenberg) or possibly the flames of the rising sun (Kiehnle).1.

It is not entirely clear why it has been inserted here, though as an eleven-verse hymn con-sisting mostly of triṣṭubhs it comes at the end of the triṣṭubh hymns to Agni and is preceded by two likewise eleven-verse hymns.The structure of the hymn has been illuminatingly discussed by Theodore Proferes (2003b), who shows that not only does it fall into two separate parts devoted to the single post (1–5) and multiple posts (6–10) respectively, as is already indicated by the Anukramaṇī, but that the two halves are entirely parallel in phraseology and struc-ture. Originally there were probably two hymns, each appropriate to a different ritual situation (one sacrificial animal versus several). They were put together and a final benedictory verse was added (11), and then it was inserted into the Agni cycle.The ritual action depicted in both parts is the erecting, anointing, and wrapping of the posts; there is no mention of the sacrificial animal.1. Those seeking the gods anoint you at the ceremony, o Lord of the Forest, with heavenly honey.When you will stand erect, after that establish material goods here—or when you will dwell peacefully in the lap of this mother [=Earth].2. Being propped in front of the kindled (fire), gaining the unaging formulation that provides good heroes,thrusting heedlessness to a distance from us, rise up for great good fortune.3. Rise up, Lord of the Forest, upon the height of the earth.Being founded with a good founding, establish luster for the one whose vehicle is the sacrifice.4. As a youth, richly dressed, engirded, he has come here. He becomes more splendid as he is being born.Him do the insightful, very attentive poets lead upward, seeking the gods with their mind.5. Once born, he is born (again) on the brightest day of days, growing strong at the encounter, at the rite.The insightful, industrious ones purify (him) with inspired thought. Beseeching the gods, the poet raises his voice.6. Those of you whom the god-seeking men have fixed down, or, Lord of the Forest, whom the axe has fashioned,let those god(like) sacrificial posts, standing there, be disposed to place a treasure consisting of offspring in us."},{"pageNumber":498,"pageContent":"III.94817.

Like geese, taking their places in a row, wearing gleaming (garments) the posts have come here to us.Being led upward by the poets in front, the gods go into the fold of the gods.10.

Thematically, the poet parallels the gods’ search for Agni and the human priests’ kindling of fire. The fire has disappeared into the waters or into the wood, which has absorbed the waters. Therefore, it is in the waters that the “watchful and unde-ceiving ones,” either priests or gods, have found him. The double reference is par-ticularly well expressed in verse 5. The first part of the verse alludes to the myth of Agni’s flight from the gods and to the myth of Mātariśvan, who brings the fire from heaven. But the final phrase devébhyo mathitám pári, here translated “stolen from among the gods,” could also mean “churned from among the gods.” That is, it likely refers to the priestly act of creating fire by friction as well as to the story of Mātariśvan’s bringing fire.1. As your companions, we mortals have chosen you, a god, to help—you, the Child of the Waters, sharing good fortune, shining brightly, strongly advancing, faultless."},{"pageNumber":499,"pageContent":"III.104822. Since desiring the trees, you went to your mothers, the waters,therefore your return is not to be ignored, o Agni, since, though being far away, you have come to be here.3. You have grown beyond the acrid (smoke), and so now you are benevolent.The ones [=priests or flames] go farther and farther forth; the others [=other priests or flames] remain around—those in whose companionship you rest.4. Him who had gone beyond failures, beyond the ever-parched places—him did the watchful and undeceiving ones find resting in the waters like a lion.5. Agni, hidden thus, as if he had run away on his own—him did Mātariśvan lead here from the far distance, stolen from among the gods.6. You are he whom mortals seized, o you who convey oblations to the gods,since you, son of Manu, guard all sacrifices according to your resolve, youngest one.7. This is auspicious—your wondrous skill appears good even to a simple man—that the herd sits together around you, o Agni, when you are kindled at night’s boundary.8. Pour an offering to him who makes the rite good, sharp (Agni) of pure flame.Obediently serve the swift messenger, the quick, the ancient one to be summoned, the god.9. Three hundred and three thousand, thirty and nine gods served Agni.They sprinkled him with ghee and they strewed ritual grass for him. Then they seated him as their Hotar.III.10 (244) AgniViśvāmitra Gāthina9 verses: uṣṇihThe hymn is in praise of Agni as he is kindled and installed as the Hotar in the rite. Because the Hotar recites the hymns in the ritual and because this hymn emphasizes Agni’s role as Hotar, the poet also connects ritual speech and Agni, in particular, the speech that addresses him and that he can appreciate and inspire as the Hotar. Again in accordance with Agni’s role as Hotar, the poet emphasizes Agni’s skill as a priest and his ability to rectify any failures in the rite. In verse 7, which mentions such failures, ví rājasi means both “shine in every direction” and “rule in every direction.” Both, of course, would fit the context."},{"pageNumber":500,"pageContent":"III.11483Oldenberg suggests that this hymn (as well as the next two) may be organized into tr̥cas. The extractions of triplets from these hymns in ritual performance and in the Sāmaveda also speak in favor of tr̥cas, although not all tr̥cas in the later tradi-tion correspond to tr̥cas in the original hymns. So, for example, as Oldenberg points out, III.11.5, 7, 6 form a tr̥ca in the Sāmaveda, but they have a different order and cross a tr̥ca boundary in the R̥gveda.1. You, o Agni, the sovereign king over the peoples,you a god do mortals of inspired thought kindle in the rite.2. You do they summon as priest at the sacrifices and as Hotar, o Agni.Shine as the herdsman of truth in your own house.3. He who will ritually serve you, o Jātavedas, with the kindling wood,he, o Agni, receives an abundance of heroes, and he prospers.4. The beacon of the rites, Agni will come with the gods,being anointed by the seven Hotars for the sake of him who brings the offering.5. Bring forward the first lofty speech for the Hotar, for Agni,as if for a ritual master who brings the lights of inspirations.6. Let our songs strengthen Agni—those from which he is born, worthy to be hymned,as the one lovely to see, for the great prize and for great wealth.7. O Agni, as the best sacrificer in the rite, sacrifice to the gods for him seeking the gods.As the delighting Hotar, you rule in every direction beyond failures.8.

Admiring, inspired poets, being awake, kindle you,the conveyor of oblations, immortal and strength-increasing.III.11 (245) AgniViśvāmitra Gāthina9 verses: gāyatrīThe theme of the hymn is Agni as the intermediary between gods and mortals. So in verse 2, for example, he is a fire-priest like a human, but as a god he is immortal; he is the messenger placed on earth with mortals for the delight of the gods. The image of Agni as a chariot in verse 5 is unusual and striking, and because it is so and because it is located in the hymn’s central verse, it dominates the hymn. It finds echoes in the descriptions of Agni as the “conveyor” (vss. 2, 4), as “overpowering all attacks” (vs. 6), and as piled high with “well-placed” ritual offerings and hymns for the gods (vs. 8)—these are the likely “things” of Agni mentioned in the verse—and with “desirable things” for mortals (vs. 9). The image of the chariot is also"},{"pageNumber":501,"pageContent":"III.12484reflected in the description of the sacrificer journeying to both “pleasing offerings” and Agni’s “dwelling place” (vs. 7). Indeed, the vā́has, the sacrificer’s “vehicle” in verse 7, is probably none other than Agni himself, who is described by the cognates havya-váh and váhni.1. Agni is the Hotar of the rite, who is placed to the fore, who is without boundaries:he knows the sacrifice in its proper order.2. The conveyor of oblations, the immortal fire-priest, and the messenger placed for delight,Agni through insight assembles (the sacrifice).3. Agni—through insight he becomes visible as the ancient beacon of the sacrifice,for his is a surpassing goal.4.

The two gods are not only invoked together, but the poet also ascribes the acts distinctive of each god to both. After invoking them in the 2nd person in the first two verses, in the third verse he refers to them in the 3rd person and then, espe-cially in verses 4 and 6, tells of the great deeds that belong to both of them. In verse 4 they are both “smashers of obstacles,” for while Indra is the “smasher of obstacles” or “smasher of Vr̥tra,” Agni also burns his way through obstacles (e.g., VI.16.34). Indra is the god who famously breaks the fortifications of the Dāsas, but in verse 6 Agni also destroys enemies’ fortifications, as in III.15.4. In verse 8 “cross-ing the waters” belongs to the two of them as well. As Geldner remarks, this last is"},{"pageNumber":502,"pageContent":"III.13485probably a reference to a victorious march across rivers that is led by the sacrifice, represented by Agni, and by warriors, represented by Indra.1.

Its theme is Agni as the god who inspires the recitations of the priests. As such, Agni possesses the truth that the hymns express (vs. 2), and he himself is both an inspired poet (vs. 3) and the Hotar priest (vs. 5). As he is kindled, he becomes increasingly bright and the hymn connects his visible brilliance with the brilliance of mind he inspires (vss. 5–6) and finally even the brilliance of the gift he wins for the sacrificers (vs. 7).1. Chant forth for you all the loftiest (chant) to him, the god Agni.He will come to us with the gods, and as the best sacrificer he will sit here upon the ritual grass."},{"pageNumber":503,"pageContent":"III.144862.

The first verse announces this theme, describing Agni as the Hotar and the “real sacrificer and best of sages.” In the first verse the poet also mentions Agni’s “chariot of lightning” by which he speeds to the sacrifice, and he then returns to the image of the chariot in the last verse. In that final verse, however, the “chariot” is, as often, the sacrifice itself. The last verse, therefore, takes the role of Agni as priest and the description of Agni as having a “chariot of lightning” in verse 1 and combines them in the image of chariot as sacrifice.1. The delighting Hotar has taken his stand upon the ritual divisions: as the real sacrificer and best of sages, he is the master of the rite.Agni, the son of strength, with chariot of lightning and hair of flame, has rested his countenance upon the earth.2.

The hymn describes the morning fire, who is the protector and guide of the sacri-ficers. Some of the language in the hymn is evocative of Indra, although Indra is never mentioned. A possible oblique reference to Indra, however, might help us understand verse 4, the central and most puzzling verse in the hymn. There Agni is invoked as an “invincible bull” who conquers fortresses, a description that strongly evokes Indra, since it is Indra (or twice Soma acting as Indra) who is áṣāḷha “invin-cible,” and it is Indra who characteristically breaks open fortresses. This overlay of the image of Indra onto Agni may explain some of the complications in the second half of the verse. In cd Agni is surely the “leader of the sacrifice,” but then who is the pāyú, the “protector” whom he also leads? If he is the leader of the sacrifice, Agni himself should be its protector as well. For this reason Oldenberg suggested emending the text so that “protector” is a subject parallel to “leader.” But if we accept the text as transmitted and translate “leader of its protector” rather than “leader and protector,” could Agni lead Agni? Possibly he could, if the first Agni were the priest Agni and the second were Agni as the embodiment of Indra, as sug-gested in the first half of the verse. Or the poet may also be punning on pāyú, which"},{"pageNumber":505,"pageContent":"III.16488means “protector” here as elsewhere (cf. VII.37.8), but which formally and sec-ondarily—though only secondarily—could be derived from √pā “drink” and mean “drinker,” a natural description of soma-drinking Indra. In short, the appearance of Agni could be or could mark the appearance of Indra.1. Ever-blazing everywhere with your broad countenance, press against hostilities, demons, and afflictions.I would be under the shelter of the lofty one who gives good shelter, under the guidance of easily invoked Agni.2. You at the breaking of this dawn, you at the rising of the sun—become our herdsman!Take pleasure in my praise song as (you would) in your own birth, as in your own lineage, o Agni, well born in your own body.3.

The metrics thus organize the verses into three pairs. Structurally, however, the poet also emphasizes the unity of the hymn through ring composition: verse 1 refers to Agni as the master of saúbhaga “good fortune” and of rayí “wealth,” and verse 6 to him as subhága “bearer of good fortune” and the agent of “wealth.”"},{"pageNumber":506,"pageContent":"III.17489Once again, as in the preceding hymn, the description of Agni evokes Indra, espe-cially in verse 1, which refers to Agni as the “master of the smashing of obsta-cles,” and in verse 2, in which the poet calls on the troops of Indra, the Maruts, to follow Agni.1. This Agni is master of heroes in abundance and of great good fortune.He is master of wealth consisting in good descendants and cattle. He is master of the smashing of obstacles.2. Follow this one, you superior men, you Maruts, to strengthen him, in whom are riches that grow strong with kindness,that overcome those of evil intent in battles, and that every day swindle his rival.3.

The hymn emphasizes the centrality of Agni in the sacrifice by insistently using different derivatives of √yaj “sacrifice” in four of its five verses: verse 1 has suyajñáḥ, yajáthāya; verse 2, ā́yajaḥ, yakṣi, yajñám; verse 3, yakṣi, yájamānāya; and verse 5, yájīyān, yajā. Strikingly, verse 4 has no derivative of √yaj, but rather is the direct proclamation of Agni’s becoming the intermediary between gods and mortals and the source of life for both."},{"pageNumber":507,"pageContent":"III.18490Verse 1 contains a pun, since aktúbhiḥ can mean both “with unguents” and “through the nights.” Verse 3 is also complicated because the key word, ājā́nī, is a R̥gvedic hapax. It could mean “birth” and uṣásaḥ could be genitive singular, which could yield either “your three births belong to Dawn” or, less likely, “three are the births of Dawn.” Or ājā́nī could mean “birth-giver” or “birth” and uṣásaḥ could be nominative plural, giv-ing “the three dawns are your births or birth-givers.” As Geldner points out, in favor of “three dawns” is the fact that three dawns also appear in VIII.41.3. In none of the possibilities is the interpretation of the half-verse transparent. In the last verse, how-ever, there is a direct reference to the Agni of the past and the Agni of the present, so perhaps verse 3 refers to Agnis of the past, present, and future.1. Being kindled according to his first foundations, he who fulfills all wishes is anointed with unguents—he, the flame-haired, ghee-cloaked, purifying Agni, who makes the sacrifice good—in order to sacrifice to the gods.2. Just as you performed the sacrificial role of the Hotar of the Earth, o Agni, and just as you observantly (performed that) of the Heaven, Jātavedas,so sacrifice to the gods with this offering. Like Manu, carry out this sacrifice today.3. Three lifetimes are yours, Jātavedas, and three dawns are your births, o Agni.By these (births) win the help of the gods by sacrifice as the knowing one, and then become luck and life for the sacrificer.4. Singing to Agni, the one beautifully shining, beautifully appearing, we revere you who are to be invoked, Jātavedas.You have the gods made the messenger, the spoked wheel (of flames), the conveyor of oblations, and the navel of immortality.5. The Hotar, the better sacrificer before you, o Agni, who once again will take his seat and (be) the one who is good luck by his own will,according to his foundations, carry forth the sacrifice, o you who are observant, and set the rite in place for us in pursuit of the gods.III.18 (252) AgniKata Vaiśvāmitra5 verses: triṣṭubhThis is a hymn in praise of the fire as it gains strength. The first two verses look forward to the fire’s blaze, which should be directed against the enemies of the sacrificers. The third and middle verse turns to the ritual acts that cause the fire to increase—adding fuel to it, offering melted butter into it, and even pouring praise"},{"pageNumber":508,"pageContent":"III.19491upon it. The last two verses then again describe the blazing fire, but this time the increasing blaze is not turned against enemies but rather represents and effects the increasing strength and wealth of the sacrificers.1.

According to the Sarvānukramaṇī, Gāthin was the father of Viśvāmitra, although in III.33.5 Viśvāmitra calls himself a son of Kuśika.In general, the hymn is similar to IV.6. See especially verse 2, which has many of the same themes and much of the same vocabulary as IV.6.3. Its most obvi-ous structural feature is the ring defined by 1a and 5a. One difference between the two lines, however, is that the poet chooses Agni in verse 1, but the gods anoint Agni in verse 5. This change echoes the shifts throughout the hymn between the priests and Agni. In verse 2ab first “I” perform a ritual offering to Agni, and then in cd Agni performs a ritual act. Verse 3 begins as if it is still describing Agni, especially if the gapped verb is sám √śri “provide” from 2d, but"},{"pageNumber":509,"pageContent":"III.20492by the end of the first line the subject needs to be read as the priest. In 3b the action of both Agni and the priest is characterized as “striving.” In verse 4 the people performing the ritual are “eager to sacrifice,” but it is Agni who “will sacrifice.” This shifting between humans and the god Agni signifies the closing gap between humans and the gods.The hymn also contains two problematic ellipses. As mentioned above, 3a gaps the verb, and although we have supplied “provide,” this is not the only possibility. In verse 2 because of another ellipsis there is some ambiguity about the ritual act that the “I” performs. By the end of the hemistich the reference to the sacrificial ladle, the juhū́, is fairly clear, but initially what is sent to Agni could be vā́c “speech” or suṣṭutí “good praise” (vs. 3) or the like, accompanied by offerings (e.g., X.188.2 prá. . . iyarmi suṣṭutím).1. I choose Agni as the Hotar at the ritual meal—him, the clever poet, knowing all, never fooled.As the better sacrificer, he will sacrifice for us at the divine assembly. For wealth and victory’s prize, he will win reward.2. I send forth to you here, o Agni, (the ladle) filled with offerings, beautifully bright, full of gifts, and covered with ghee.Making respectful circumambulation before the divine assembly, being chosen (as Hotar), he has provided the sacrifice with gifts and with good (gods).3. He (provides it) with very sharp thought when helped by you, and so strive for good descendants for him who strives.Agni, may we and our good praises be in an excess of wealth filled with the best of men, (an excess) of the good.4. Since the peoples eager to sacrifice have established in you [=the fire] the many faces of (you) the god, Agni,convey here the assembly of the gods, o youngest one, when you will sacrifice to the multitude of gods today.5. When the gods will anoint you as the Hotar at the ritual meal, seating you for the sacrifice,become our helper here, Agni. Set fame upon our persons.III.20 (254) Agni and the All GodsGāthin Kauśika5 verses: triṣṭubhThe hymn begins by naming deities of the morning, although in the last verse the poet brings all the gods into his invocation. As in the previous hymn, the poet employs ring composition, a point that the Anukramaṇī underscores by assigning the address in both the first verse and the last verse not to Agni but to the All Gods."},{"pageNumber":510,"pageContent":"III.21493Also once again, the poet varies the first and last verses. Every verse except the last one begins with “Agni.” But in that last verse Dadhikrā is transposed in front of Agni. It is difficult to see if the poet has a purpose in mind other than marking the last verse through this shift.However, fronting Dadhikrā, who is a deified horse, does underscore a return to the equine imagery that opens the hymn. In verse 1 the poet not only mentions the horse Dadhikrā and the two horsemen, the Aśvins, but he also calls the recit-ing priest a váhni, a chariot-driver, whose horses may be his recitations, as Geldner suggests. Then verse 2 refers to Agni’s vā́jinā, here translated “victorious charges.” The meaning of the word is not certain, but it is in any case derived from vājín “racehorse” or “prizewinning horse.” Overt references to horses and racing then subside until the last verse.1. Agni, Dawn, the two Aśvins, Dadhikrā—with his recitations the chariot-driver calls upon them at daybreak.Let the gods of good light, bellowing all together toward the rite, hear us.2. Agni, three are your victorious charges, three your abodes. Three are your tongues [=flames], o you who are born of truth, (and these three are) many,and three are your bodies [=the three sacrificial fires], won by the gods. Never lapsing, protect our songs with these.3. Agni, numerous are the names of you, the immortal one, o Jātavedas, o god of independent will,and, o you who propel everything, (yours are) the many wiles of the wily (gods), which they have assembled in you, o you about whose kinship people ask.4. Agni is the leader of the heavenly settlements like Bhaga—he, the god who drinks according to [/protects] the ritual sequence, who possesses the truth.The smasher of Vr̥tra from of old, having every possession, will take the singer across all difficulties.5. Dadhikrā, Agni, and the goddess Dawn; Br̥haspati and the god Savitar;the Aśvins, Mitra and Varuṇa, and Bhaga; the Vasus, Rudras, and Ādityas—I call upon them here.III.21 (255) AgniGāthin Kauśika5 verses: triṣṭubh 1, 4; anuṣṭubh 2–3; satobr̥hatī 5Oldenberg judges this to be not so much a hymn as a collection of verses composed in various meters. In his earlier translation of the Agni hymns, however, he does"},{"pageNumber":511,"pageContent":"III.22494note that at least the last two verses “seem to form a distich of an irregular pragātha type.” On the other hand, Geldner observes that TB III 6.7 includes the whole of the hymn in the animal sacrifice among the stokīyā verses that accompany the drip-ping fat from the vapā, the omentum, while it is being roasted, and Elizarenkova (1995: 116) further proposes that the different meters of the verses reflect the irregu-lar rhythm of the drops as they fall. Whether it originated as a verse collection or it constitutes a unified composition, the hymn does center on the dripping fat of an animal sacrifice. The hymn mentions médas “fat” in every verse but one, and even puns on médas in verse 4 by referring to Agni as médhira “wise.”1. Place this our sacrifice among the immortals. Take pleasure in these oblations, Jātavedas.Eat of the drops of fat and of ghee, o Agni, our Hotar, taking your seat as the first.2. Filled with ghee, drops of fat drip for you, o pure one.O you on your own foundation, set in place for us the best thing, the thing to be chosen, in order for us to pursue the gods.3. For you, the inspired poet, o Agni, are the drops dripping with ghee, o companion.As the best seer you are kindled. Become the helper of our sacrifice.4. For you drip the drops of fat and of ghee, o independent and capable Agni.Proclaimed by poets, you have come with your lofty radiance. Take pleasure in the oblations, wise one.5.

Capture them (for) each god in turn.III.22 (256) Purı̄ṣya AgnisGāthin Kauśika5 verses: triṣṭubh, except anuṣṭubh 4Like the surrounding hymns, the Anukramaṇī attributes this hymn to Gāthin, although, as Geldner notes, TS V.2.3.3 names Viśvāmitra as the poet. Verse 5 is the frequent final verse in the Viśvāmitra hymns (cf. III.1.23, 5.11, 6.11, 7.11, 15.7, 23.5).Both the Black and White Yajurvedic traditions employ the hymn in the Agnicayana rite (TS IV.2.4.2, VS XII.47–50) at the consecration and laying of the bricks of the fire altar. Geldner suggests that this application of the hymn may have resulted from a misunderstanding of the phrase puriṣyā̀so agnáyaḥ in verse 4, here"},{"pageNumber":512,"pageContent":"III.23495translated “the fires from their overflowing source,” but traditionally interpreted in the context of the Agnicayana to mean “the fires of the mud” (cf.

In verses 2–4, however, the image of an ocean of waters is overlaid with that of an ocean of light. In verse 2 Agni’s luster is “glittering, undulating radiance watching men,” a likely reference to the sun or the brightness of the sky more generally. The “undulating sea” to which Agni goes in verse 3, therefore, might not be a sea of waters, or rather, not only a sea of water, but also a sea of light. In verse 4 both the fires and the waters cascade downward. The fires could be in the waters, but they might also be light, which, like rain, pours down from heaven.1. Here is Agni, in whom the bellowing Indra has received the pressed soma in his belly.As (we praise) a steed, a team-horse, (that has won) the prize of a thousand, you are praised, Jātavedas, since you are victorious.2. O Agni, worthy to receive the sacrifice, your luster, which is in heaven and on earth, which is here among the plants and the waters,and by which you have stretched throughout the wide midspace—that is glittering, undulating radiance watching men.3. O Agni, you go there to the undulating sea of heaven—there you have spoken to the gods, who are the holy ones—to the waters, which, in the realm of light, are beyond the sun, and which draw nearby beneath.4. Let the fires from their overflowing source, along with the falling torrents—(all of them) great refreshments free of deception and free of disease—take pleasure in the sacrifice.5. – Make the milk-libation, the very wondrous winning of the cow, succeed, o Agni, for him who invokes you most constantly.There should be for us a son and a lineage that proliferates.

This Agni governs the peoples (vs."},{"pageNumber":513,"pageContent":"III.244963)—likely the peoples of the tribe, as Proferes suggests—from a location, “earth’s most desirable place” (vs. 4), among the three rivers. Various theories have been offered for the identity of Devaśravas, who is addressed in verse 3, and Devavāta, to whom the Agni of the Bhāratas belong. Surely Devavāta is or was the king of the Bhāratas, since his is the Bhārata fire. Devaśravas could be a priest or poet, or he could have been a Bhārata leader, perhaps an ally or successor of Devavāta. In any case, along with the Agni of the Bhāratas himself, they are the focus of the hymn since they are named in the central verse and this central verse is marked by a change in meter.1. Churned out and well placed in his dwelling, the young poet, the leader of the rite,the unaging Agni amid the aging wood—Jātavedas has received immortality here.2. The two Bhāratas, Devaśravas and Devavāta, have richly churned the very skillful Agni.Agni, look upon (every one) separately with lofty wealth.

Every verse begins with an invocation to Agni, and most verses follow with an imperative, urging Agni to take his place on the ritual ground and to grant the wishes of the poet and his people. The first three verses refer either directly or indirectly to the brightening fire, which may find its counterpart in the swiftness and brevity of the hymn.1.

Actually verse 4 opens with a vā́yav índraś ca construction, which mixes a voca-tive and a nominative, and so is a hybrid that may mark a transition between the nominative of verse 3 and the vocative of verse 5. The hymn is also defined by ring composition: sūnúḥ (1a) / sūno (5b) // viśvávedāḥ (1b) / jātavedaḥ (5b).The phrase in the last verse “home of the waters” is somewhat puzzling, so much so that Geldner assumes an ellipsis of nápāt, which would yield a translation “O Agni, (child) of the waters, you are kindled in the home. . . . ” or the like. But there is little in the hymn itself to suggest such an ellipsis, nor does Sāyaṇa read one here. Although it is not clear exactly what the “home of the waters” refers to—it might simply be the firewood—the end of the verse suggests that Agni makes all homes or abodes great, wherever he is kindled.1. O Agni, you are the watchful son of heaven and of earth by the continuity (of fires), providing all possessions.Sacrifice to the gods here one by one, o attentive one.2. Agni, the knowing one, wins heroic deeds. He wins victory’s prize, exerting himself for immortality.Convey the gods here to us, o you of many cattle.3.

The hymn comprises three tr̥cas: the first set of three verses is to Agni Vaiśvānara, the second to the Maruts, and the third begins with Agni’s self-praise in verse 7 and then continues with the poet’s description of Agni in verses 8–9. This is one way to regard the hymn. Geldner offers another, quite plausible analysis. According to him, the first tr̥ca contains verses to accompany the kindling of Agni. In the second the newly cre-ated Agni is fanned with the help of the Maruts. The third tr̥ca is entirely the speech of Agni. It begins with the god’s praise of himself and then continues with the god’s praise of the poet. Bergaigne argues that the Āgnimāruta śastra in the later ritual consists of three major parts addressed to Vaiśvānara, the Maruts, and Jātavedas and suggests that this hymn represents an old Āgnimāruta śastra. Oldenberg disagrees with both Geldner and Bergaigne, holding that the hymn does not possess the kind of unity that either asserts. In his translation of Agni hymns (1897), he describes the three tr̥cas as “three independent hymns” because of the placement of the hymn in the collection; that is, it has more verses than the preceding hymns, while in the normal arrangement it should have the same number of verses or fewer.Despite its placement in the collection and the change of meter, we believe that Geldner and Bergaigne are correct in seeing a coherence to the hymn and find Bergaigne’s suggestion that this is an early Āgnimāruta śastra an attractive one.1. Having discerned with our mind Vaiśvānara, who conforms to what is real and finds the sun, we Kuśikas, bringing offeringsand desiring goods, invoke with our songs the god of good gifts, the delighting charioteer.2. We invoke the beautiful Agni for help, who is Vaiśvānara and praiseworthy Mātariśvan,who is Br̥haspati for the divine assembly of Manu, who is the inspired poet and the listener, the guest and the quick-streaming one.3. Whinnying like a horse, he is kindled by the females [=the fingers of the priest]; Vaiśvānara (is kindled) by the Kuśikas, generation after generation.Let Agni, awake among the immortals, grant us treasure and an abundance of good men and good horses."},{"pageNumber":516,"pageContent":"III.274994.

We beg (the Maruts)—cohort upon cohort, band upon band—with our good chants for the radiance of Agni and the power of the Maruts,with their dappled horses, with their unreceding generosity, the travelers to the sacrifice, wise at the ritual distributions.7.

This is particularly obvious in the case of the third (vss. 7–9) and fourth (vss. 10–12) tr̥cas, which are connected to the fourth and fifth (vss. 13–15) respectively. The last verse of the third tr̥ca (9a, c) describes Agni as va﻿́reṇyaḥ. . . da﻿́kṣasya pita﻿́ram “(the one) to be chosen, the father of skill,” a characterization echoed by váreṇyaṃ da﻿́kṣasya in 10ab, the first verse of the fourth tr̥ca. Likewise, the poet “summons” (īḷe) Agni at the end of verse 12 and then describes him as īḷénya “to be summoned” in verse 13. A ring formed by havíṣmant “bearing offerings” in the first and penultimate verses pro-vides a unity to the whole hymn."},{"pageNumber":517,"pageContent":"III.27500Even though this hymn is closely connected to the ritual, the precise application of the verses is not clear. Bergaigne thinks that they are sāmidhenī (fire-kindling) verses to be recited as the fire is kindled, and surely this is true of at least the last tr̥ca, which repeats the verb sam √idh in each of its verses. Oldenberg agrees that parts of this hymn are sāmidhenī verses, but suggests that verses 7–9, for example, describe the agnipraṇayana, the procession of the fire to the uttaravedi in the classi-cal Vedic rite, and that 10–12 refer to the installation of the fire. The agnipraṇayana and the deposition of the fire are closely conjoined rites.1.

The hymn is metrically mixed in an arrangement corresponding to the later tradition that assigns the gāyatrī meter to the first pressing, the triṣṭubh to the second, and the jagatī to the third. In part because the hymn is so closely tied to a specific parts of the liturgy, it likely represents a more advanced stage in the development of the Vedic ritual than is found in most R̥gvedic hymns. In the classical rite there is an offering of rice cakes—in the earlier period they were barley cakes—to Indra at each of the three soma-pressings. After each cake offering, there is an additional offering to Agni Sviṣṭakr̥t, and, as Oldenberg (1897: 301) points out, Āśvalāyana Śrauta Sūtra V.4.6 prescribes III.28.1, 4, and 5 for these offerings, according to the order of the soma-pressings. See also III.52, which also concerns the sacrificial cakes offered to Indra offered in the three pressings.The remaining two verses (3 and 6) cannot be so readily connected with the three daily pressings. Verse 3 is not in any of the meters associated with the pressings, but rather in the rare uṣṇih meter. Verse 6 is in gāyatrī, but it is at the end of the hymn, not at the beginning where we would have expected the “morning” verses to appear. These are also the only two verses in which the description tiro﻿́ahnya appears. The term means “aged overnight,” or more literally, “having passed through the day.” This word describes soma that is offered to the Aśvins in the early morning of the day following the soma-pressing day. In the classical Atirātra or “overnight” soma ritual, an offering of a puroḷāś accompanies this soma offering to the Aśvins, and these offerings of soma and puroḷāś may also be followed by a sviṣṭakr̥t offering of puroḷāś to Agni. These two verses thus likely refer to one or another of these final offerings of an Atirātra rite. Indeed, according to ĀśvŚS V.6.25, verse 6 is the yājyā or “offering” verse of the sviṣṭakr̥t rite for exactly this final offering.If the term tiro﻿́ahnya helps locate the ritual context of verses 3 and 6, it also poses an interpretive problem. Geldner and Renou both understand tiro﻿́ahnya as an adjective describing the puroḷāś-cake. However, it is unlikely to be literally true that the cake is “aged overnight.” Rather, as is the case in the classical rite, it would have been prepared on the morning it was offered. Recognizing this problem,"},{"pageNumber":519,"pageContent":"III.28502Elizarenkova understood tiro﻿́ahnya to mean the soma “aged overnight,” in accord with the consistent usage of the term elsewhere. But soma is not mentioned in the hymn, and neither verse gives any indication that tiro﻿́ahnya describes something other than the puroḷāś. Therefore, we think that tiro﻿́ahnya describes the puroḷāś but is not intended to describe it literally. Rather, it associates the puroḷāś with the accompanying offering of the soma “aged overnight.”In the classical Atirātra, the Āśvinaśastra, the recitation that accompanies the final soma offering to the Aśvins, follows the form of Prātaranuvāka, the early-morning litany, which opens the soma-pressing day (cf. Staal 1983 I: 683). The two recitations thus create a ritual ring, in which the end recapitulates the begin-ning. In this hymn verse 3, although connected with the end of the rite, is located immediately after the verses that mark the rite’s beginning, and thus it becomes an icon of the conjunction of the beginning and end of the rite. This is reflected in its meter as well. Like gāyatrī, the meter associated with the morning rite, the uṣṇih meter of verse 3 consists of three pādas, but its final pāda has twelve syllables like jagatī, the meter associated with the end of the rite. The metrical form thus com-bines the morning and evening liturgies. Verse 6 is in gāyatrī, which again brings the hymn metrically back to the beginning of the rite, although the verse is placed at the end. For a more detailed discussion of this hymn, see Brereton (forthcoming b).Another incongruous description appears in verse 5, which characterizes the rite (adhvara﻿́) as “bearing treasure” (ra﻿́tnavant) and “wakeful” (jā́gr̥vi). Especially the latter is an adjective that often describes Agni (e.g., I.31.9, III.2.12) and Soma (e.g., IX.36.2, 44.3, 71.1). Here it is an epithet transferred from the sacrificial fire or from the priests who have drunk the soma to the rite, which both Agni and the priests wakefully maintain through the night. See also III.39.1, 2, in which the “thought” of the poet is “wakeful.”1. O Agni, enjoy our offering, our sacrificial cake, o Jātavedas,at the Early Morning Pressing, o you who are rich through insight.2. The sacrificial cake has been cooked, o Agni, or rather, perfected for you.Enjoy it, o youngest one.3.

At the Midday Pressing, o poet Jātavedas, enjoy the sacrificial cake here.O Agni, the wise do not diminish the portion that belongs to you, the youthful one, at the ritual distributions.5. O Agni, since at the Third Pressing you will take pleasure in the sacrificial cake offered you, o son of strength,then (establish) the rite among the gods, amid their admiration; establish it, bearing treasure and wakeful, among the immortals.6. O Agni Jātavedas, becoming strong, enjoy the offering, the sacrificial cake,“aged overnight.”"},{"pageNumber":520,"pageContent":"III.29503III.29 (263) AgniViśvāmitra Gāthina16 verses: triṣṭubh, except anuṣṭubh 1, 4, 10, 12; jagatī 6, 11, 14–15This hymn was composed to accompany the creation of a new fire for the sacrifice. This fire was created through friction using a fire drill that consisted of two pieces of wood. The upper fire-churning stick was held vertically, with one end in a recessed area in the lower piece of wood, which was horizontal. Wood chips were placed around the recessed area on the lower plank. The upper stick was then rotated back and forth, like a churn. In the later ritual this is done by wrapping a rope around the upper stick and pulling on one side and then the other to make the stick rotate back and forth. Eventually, enough heat was generated so that the wood chips caught fire.This process of churning out the fire was regularly identified in the R̥gvedic hymns with sexual intercourse, and this repeated image presents the upper fire-churning stick as the father, with phallic overtones especially in verse 1, and the lower fire-churning stick as the mother of fire. Another theme that runs throughout the hymn, and again a common one in Agni hymns, is the idea that Agni is born as a priest of the sacrifice, who carries the oblations (vss. 4, 7) and offers the sacrifice (vs. 8) and who is a sage poet (vss. 5, 12) and a Hotar (vss. 8, 16) in the company of the seven Hotars (vs. 14), the seven priests of the rite. The priests kindling Agni are named in verse 15: they are the Kuśikas, whose knowledge and ability to formulate the truth about Agni the hymn accentuates.1.

The riddling verse 14, with the well-known paradox of the “cooked” milk contained within a “raw” cow, ends this section of the hymn by seeming to identify the dawn as cow with other images of plenty for which Indra is responsible; it picks up the cow imagery already found in verse 10 concerning the release of the cows from the Vala cave. Moreover, since sacrificial gifts are distributed at the dawn ritual, the mention of dawn sets the stage for the requests for gifts at the end of the hymn.The next part of the hymn (15–17) begins abruptly with an address to Indra and a command to him: he is exhorted to come to the aid of the poet and his allies against enemies in violent battle. The final section (18–21) continues the direct requests to Indra, but here for material goods to be distributed peaceably at the sac-rifice. The final verse (before the refrain) applies the model of the Vala victory to the present, beseeching Indra to continue to break open cowpens and distribute cows.As often, the concerns of the whole hymn are subtly foreshadowed in the first verse, which both establishes the sacrificers as beset by hostile forces and their sac-rifice as a site for beneficial exchange with the god.The hymn is characterized by a number of hapaxes and by affective morphology, especially in the sections devoted to Indra’s opponents; the translations of some of these words are provisional.1.

The heart of the hymn (vss. 4–11 and passim throughout the rest of the hymn) provides one"},{"pageNumber":525,"pageContent":"III.31508of the fullest accounts in the R̥gveda of the Vala myth and especially of Indra and the Aṅgirases as they besiege the Vala cave and seek to free the cows within by means of song and ritual activity. Since the cows of the Vala myth are often used as symbols of the dawns, the hymn also celebrates the coming of dawn and its ritual manifestations, including the distribution of priestly gifts (dakṣiṇā), which occurs at the early-morning ritual.Perhaps the most striking part of the hymn, however, is found in the first three verses, which are often taken as depicting the production of the ritual fire as an alle-gory of cosmic incest. Although there are certainly hints of an incestuous liaison, the relationships among the various kinship terms here are not at all clear, and in our opinion the ritual references to the production of fire so dominate the picture and distort the underlying sexual configurations that it is a mistake to seek too literal a mythological reading. The translation of the first two verses, especially, is provisional. Our identifications of the personae with various ritual elements differ from those of other scholars (who also differ among themselves), but in our opinion the ritual reference here is not to the initial production of ritual fire, but rather the transformation, through removal to the east, of the undifferentiated ritual fire into the new offering fire, an action well known from the later ritual literature, where the new fire with its eastern hearth is called the Āhavanīya and the older one in the west the Gārhapatya. If this particular ritual procedure was an innovation in the R̥gveda or pre-R̥gveda, as we suspect, a mystical and riddling presentation of it like this would not be surprising.The connection between this opening description of the birth of Agni and the following treatment of the Vala myth may not be superficially obvious, but it is the theme of dawn that unites them: fire is kindled at dawn, and the release of the Vala cows is regularly likened to the breaking of dawn.It is notable that neither Indra nor the Aṅgirases are named for most of the recital of the Vala myth, though they are referred to constantly. Indeed the plural Aṅgirases is not found in the mythic section, only the singular (vs. 7) referring to Indra. Indra is named, but not until verse 11, the exact center of the hymn (minus the refrain, vs. 22) and the standard locus for mysteries and their solutions. However, various epithets, associates, and exploits of Indra that uniquely identify him and that are irrelevant to the Vala myth have foreshadowed this naming: Saramā, Indra’s dog, in verse 6; his opponent Śuṣṇa in verse 8; and the Vr̥tra-smashing earlier in verse 11. After the first naming of Indra in verse 11 the hymn broadens its view to include a range of Indra’s cosmogonic deeds, especially the separation of Heaven and Earth and the smashing of Vr̥tra.The hymn returns to the ritual here-and-now starting around verse 17, and the theme of dawn, appropriate both to the fire-kindling verses 1–3 and the extensive treatment of the Vala myth, prompts the requests for Indra’ liberality to be mani-fested in the early-morning dakṣiṇā, with the dispensing of gifts compared to the outpouring of cows from the opened Vala cave."},{"pageNumber":526,"pageContent":"III.315091.

Throughout the hymn invitations to drink soma at this rite are interspersed with praises of Indra’s cosmogonic deeds, espe-cially the slaying of Vr̥tra. In verses 9–10 Indra’s powers are ascribed to his origi-nal drinking of soma immediately after birth, with the implicit suggestion that the sacrificers’ current offering of soma will revitalize those powers for the sacrificers’ benefit.For the most part the language of this hymn is straightforward and even a bit monotonous, and there are a number of technical terms pertaining to the soma sacrifice (see, e.g., the types of soma in vs. 2). There are, however, several studied contrastive pairs (e.g., “vulnerable. . . invulnerable,” vs. 4; “goddesses. . . godless,” vs. 6; see also vss. 7, 11), as well as a few striking images, such as Indra “wearing the earth on his other hip” (vs. 11) as an indication of his greatness.1.

After two opening verses describing the confluence of the Vipāś and Śutudrī rivers, this justly famous poem consists of a dialogue between those rivers and Viśvāmitra, who begs the rivers to stop in their course to allow the Bharata forces, under his patron, King Sudās (not named here, but see III.53.9), to cross. They accede to his request in return for his ensuring their future fame in his poetry, and the Bharatas cross successfully, as is announced in verse 12—after which the rivers are urged to refill themselves with water and flow again. That it is the poet who succeeds in temporarily stopping the rivers is yet another example of the power of properly formulated speech to control the physical world. The final verse (13), in a different meter, may be a magic spell, exemplifying the continuing belief in the power of the word by applying this legendary river crossing to a team in trouble at a ford."},{"pageNumber":531,"pageContent":"III.335141.

In several verses (esp. 3 and 6) Indra’s sheer power, reinforced by his backup troops, is contrasted with his control of clever tricks and artifice; both types of approach contribute to his success.The underlying theme of victory, expressed in a variety of ways earlier in the hymn, becomes insistent in the numerous repetitions of the verb “win” (√san) in the last three verses before the refrain (vss. 8–10), which contain eight forms of the verb (including four forms of the perfect sasā́na in a single verse [9] ); the root appears previously in the hymn only in the root noun compound svar-sán “winning the sun” in verse 4.The poets’ role in spurring Indra to victory is mentioned several times at the beginning of the hymn (vss. 1–2), but is otherwise backgrounded; the poets’ task in the hymn is more to celebrate and praise (vss. 6, 7, 8) the god than to inspire him. In fact, it is Indra who grants inspiration to the poets (vs. 5), an action that precedes and makes possible their praises in verses 6–8.One curious feature of the hymn is the presence of phraseology and imagery characteristic of the god Agni in 3cd and of fire-priests in 4ab. The point of contact is probably to be found in verse 4, where Indra is said to win the sun and make it shine, and to find the light, since the kindling of the ritual fire at dawn is associated with and often presented as the cause of the sunrise.1. Indra, stronghold-splitter, overcame the Dāsa with his chants, finding goods, fragmenting his rivals.Spurred on by the sacred formulation, grown strong in his body, he of abundant gifts filled both world-halves."},{"pageNumber":533,"pageContent":"III.345162.

The progress of the hymn is com-pletely chronological, from the yoking of his pair of horses, through the journey, during which Indra is exhorted to pass by other sacrificers (vs. 5), and finally the arrival at the ritual ground, properly prepared, and the drinking of the soma. The mention of the Maruts in verses 7 and 9 suggests that the Midday Pressing, devoted to Indra and the Maruts jointly at least in Viśvāmitra circles, is the sacrifice in ques-tion (see also, for example, III.32). There is also a rather charming concern for the welfare of Indra’s horses (vss. 3, 7).In the context of R̥gvedic poetry what is striking are the absent elements. There is neither praise of the god honored nor any mention of his attributes or heroic deeds. (The sole exception is 9b, with its unelaborated allusion to the Maruts’ role in strengthening Indra and the alliance resulting therefrom.) Nor do we hear about the purpose of Indra’s soma-drinking—rousing him to perform heroic deeds either in the past or for our benefit now. Nor, despite the many imperatives, does the poet ask for any gifts or for aid of any sort. It is an extraordinarily focused hymn, and its apparent simplicity may result not from artlessness, but from careful pruning.1. Mount the pair of fallow bays being yoked to the chariot.

The emphasis is on Indra’s sheer size and capa-ciousness when he drinks soma, and liquid images predominate: he is conceived of both as a vast container for liquid (vs. 4) and as the liquid itself (vss. 6, 8). These images of Indra’s vastness are deftly used as measures of his capacity to give to his human worshipers (e.g., vss. 5, 9, 10).1.

The organizing principle of the hymn is the careful stationing of an accented form of the name índra at the beginning of the third pāda (after the hemistich break) in eight of the first nine verses. The middle verse of this sequence (vs. 5) instead has índra at the beginning of the verse, and this slight deviation from pattern marks an unemphatic omphalos. As often in R̥gvedic hymnic composition, a pattern set through most of the hymn is both broken and advanced at the end. Verse 10 seems at first to announce the epiph-any of the god, which has been desired throughout the hymn; the name of the god has been demoted to unaccented second position, after the annunciatory augmented aorist, the only past tense form in a hymn full of imperatives and presents: “you have come, Indra.” The poet has tricked us, however: Indra has come not to us but to fame. The final verse (11) is in a different meter, often a sign of an extra-hymnic verse, but it also emphatically renews the call for Indra’s epiphany and therefore pro-vides a fitting end to the rest. The name índra opens the final pāda (11d).The “content” of the hymn is relatively conventional and clearly subordinate to the rhetorical structure, but the light texture and balance of the phrases surround-ing the all-important repeated name are quite pleasing.1.

Although the hymn is found in the midst of the Maṇḍala III Indra hymns and is assigned to Indra by the Anukramaṇī, the name Indra is not found in the hymn (save in the appended Viśvāmitra refrain), and indeed it is not at all clear that there are any references to Indra in the hymn. Not surprisingly the hymn has given rise to much discussion.Any interpretation of its contents and intent will necessarily be speculative, and the richness and multivalence of the images should not be reduced to a single and simple paraphrase. Nonetheless, we will attempt a sketch here. It is regularly remarked that the hymn is cosmogonic. In fact, it seems to concern two creations: the Ur-creation of undifferentiated material and the subsequent establishment of indi-vidual name and form. As usual in ancient India, creation is conceived of as an act of division and individuation, rather than of assemblage. This second, and more interesting, creation was carried out by the equivalent of poets, and the current poet of this hymn identifies himself and his activities with the authors of this second creation and seeks their model for his own poetic work. The large number of neu-ter pronouns of unclear reference throughout the hymn seem to be a grammatical reflection of the undifferentiated material of the first creation, and the poet seems almost to be inviting us to participate in the second creation by ourselves assigning them name and form.The poem begins with three verses in the poet’s own voice, concerning the older generations of poets and the poetic tradition. In verse 1 he sounds both tremulous and self-assured, mindful of the tradition he belongs to but also proud of his own insight. In the second verse, addressing himself (as so often) in the 2nd person, he exhorts himself to seek models from the earlier poets, and introduces the notion that they “crafted heaven for themselves,” a reference to the second creation. The third verse fleshes out this statement, in describing just how the older poets set about this creation. Most important is the final pāda, in which they “put apart” the two worlds—the primal act of separation that makes life possible.Verse 4 moves abruptly to a new subject, or rather to an older one. A previously unmentioned figure is introduced obliquely, and though he is explicitly credited"},{"pageNumber":539,"pageContent":"III.38522with a “name” in pāda c, it is not at all clear what that name is—possibly Viśvarūpa “possessing all forms” of pāda d. In verse 5 it appears that this bull is responsible for the Ur-creation preceding the separation just described. The lack of differentia-tion in the Ur-creation may be signaled by the androgyny of its source—“the bull gave birth.” The same verse also introduces two unnamed kings, “sons/descendants of heaven.” This epithet in the dual usually refers to the Aśvins, but this identifica-tion seems unlikely here. Other suggested pairs are Mitra and Varuṇa (Grassmann, Geldner) or Indra and Varuṇa (Sāyaṇa, Renou, Oberlies); either pairing is perhaps possible, but the fact that the poet forebears to name them suggests that a precise identification may run counter to the poet’s intentions. It might also be noted that the only identifiable dual entities in the hymn are the two world-halves (vss. 3, 8, probably 9), and in verse 8 they “set all in motion.” It therefore seems possible that in this hymn the “two descendants of heaven” could in fact be the two worlds, which have dominion over (vs. 5) and tend to (vs. 6) the “(cosmic) division,” both as products of the primal separation in the second creation and producers of the further individuation occurring in that second creation: note the increasing num-bers in verse 6ab.In verse 7a we return to the androgynous Ur-creator, now explicitly identified as both bull and cow; the rest of the verse introduces the second creation characterized by “names” and “form.” The creators here are “masters of artifice,” poets perhaps. Verse 8 essentially repeats verse 7, as is signaled by the identical opening phrase, but this time it is the current poet himself (who made a brief reappearance in vs. 6cd), who by his praise hymn is responsible for movement in the world (i.e., the second creation) contrasted to the static golden emblem (8b) arising from the first creation. The poet thus implicitly identifies himself with the masters of artifice, the poets, in verse 7. In the final verse (aside from the refrain) both the unnamed dual pairing, quite possibly the two worlds, and the masters of artifice return to bear witness to the creative actions of the poet himself, who through his powerful tongue seems to control the individuated forms. We have thus returned to the issues raised in verse 1, but with the poet having successfully assumed his vocation and commanded the respect of his predecessors in the creative act.1. Like a craftsman I ponder my inspiration. Bending like a prizewinning steed amenable to the chariot-pole,touching now on my own dear things, now on distant ones, I seek sage poets to see (these) whole—(though) I (too) have wisdom.2. Ask also the powerful generations of the poets: they as good workers, holding their minds firm, crafted heaven for themselves.These are the precedents for you, which keep growing stronger.

The implicit connection between the verses concerning poetic speech and those treating the Vala myth is not expressed, but would be well known to the audience: Indra and his help-ers the Aṅgirases (here under the names Navagvas and Daśagvas “nine-cowed” and “ten-cowed”) used the power of properly formulated speech to open the cave. This is the mythic model for the poet’s use of ritual speech to secure light and safety for the sacrificer and the sacrifice (vss. 7–8).1. Thought goes toward Indra as her husband, curling herself out of my heart, crafted as praise,she who is wakeful when recited at the rite. Indra—what is born for you, know that.2. Being born of old from heaven itself, wakeful when being recited at the rite,clothing herself in auspicious, silvery garments, this one right here in us is the ancient-born, ancestral hymnic vision.3.

(It is also in the longer triṣṭubh meter, rather than the gāyatrī of the previous two.) The first four verses insistently establish the journey motif with the opening “Here—drive” (ā́. . . yāhi, vss. 1–3) / “Here . . . ” (ā́, vs. 4), along with an abundance of adverbs meaning “here, nearby, up close.” Verse 5 consists of four rhetorical questions, each introduced by the interrogative particle kuvíd, implicitly begging Indra’s intervention on the singer’s behalf. The initial “Here . . . ” and the journey motif return in verse 6; verse 7, the last before the refrain, invites Indra, presumably finally arrived, to drink the soma, inserting brief mentions of two well-known myths, the falcon’s stealing of soma and Indra’s opening of Vala. As is common in these journey hymns, Indra’s horses have a prominent part in the hymn (see esp. vs. 6, but also vss. 1–4).1. Here—drive right up nearby, stationed on the chariot seat. Just yours is the soma-drinking from olden days.Your two dear comrades—unharness them at the ritual grass. These oblation-bearers are calling you.2.

(For a far more elaborate example, see X.96.) For the purposes of this hymn, we have rendered the former as “golden,” even in reference to the horses, and the latter as “gladden(ing),” in an attempt to sketch the pun in English. In the last verse the poet slyly turns the golden mace of verse 4 into silver, a move that would surely have caught the attention of the audience.1. Let this be gladdening to you—the soma pressed here by the golden (stones).Rejoicing, Indra, come here to us along with your golden (horses).

In this primal scene she offers Indra soma just after his birth, and he, having drunk it, defeats his father and steals the soma.

Strong, overcoming the powerful, of overwhelming strength—he made his body as he wished.Having overwhelmed Tvaṣṭar at his birth, Indra, having stolen the soma, drank it in the cups.5. – For blessing we would invoke bounteous Indra, most manly, at this raid, at the winning of the prize of victory,the strong one who listens, (we would invoke) for help in battles, him who smashes obstacles, the winner of prizes.III.49 (283) IndraViśvāmitra Gāthina5 verses: triṣṭubhThe first word of this hymn, śáṃsā “I will proclaim” (or possibly 2nd sg. imperative “proclaim!”), sets the tone for the rest, which consists entirely of descriptive glori-fication (save for the refrain). There are no direct requests, though the praise of his victorious power and of his control of goods implicitly invites the god to exert the same for the singer and his community.1. I will proclaim great Indra, toward whom all the soma-drinking communities have directed their desire,the very resolute one, fashioned for distinction, whom the two Holy Places [=Heaven and Earth] and the gods begot as the bane of obstacles.2. The most manly sovereign king, mounted on fallow bays, whom now as before no one overcomes in battles,who along with his warriors is strongest through our fortifying (hymns). He in his broad expansion curtailed the lifetime of the Dasyu.3. Victorious in battles like an overtaking steed, traversing the two world-halves, streaming abundance.Like Bhaga at the decisive moment, he is to be invoked with thoughts; like a father, he is dear, easy to invoke, conferring vigor.4.

In addition to the refrain (vs. 5), verse 4 is also a repetition, of the near final verse of the first Indra hymn in this maṇḍala (III.30.20). Since III.50 is the final hymn in the regular sequence of Indra hymns in III (III.51 is a collection of tr̥cas in various meters; III.52–53 are similarly various), the double repetition seems to act as a ring-compositional device to mark the end of the Indra cycle.1. At “Svāhā!” let Indra drink, to whom the soma belongs. On coming here, bulging, bullish, accompanied by the Maruts,let him, though (already) of broad extent, become filled with these foods. Might the oblation bring to fulfillment the desire of his body.2. I yoke for you these two obliging (horses) for speed, whose obedience you favored from olden days.Here should the fallow bays deposit you, you of good lips. Drink of this pleasing well-pressed (soma).3. While being hymned, (the horses? priests?) have established (the soma) desirous of mixture with cows [=milk], to nourish Indra, the deliverer, for preeminence.Becoming invigorated once having drunk the soma, you of the silvery drink, drive together cows in quantity for us.4. Invigorate this desire with cows, with horses, with recompense in gold, and you will (further) spread it out.Seeking the sun, the inspired poets, the Kuśikas, have made with their thoughts a (ritual) conveyance for you, for Indra.5. – For blessing we would invoke bounteous Indra, most manly, at this raid, at the winning of the prize of victory,the strong one who listens, (we would invoke) for help in battles, him who smashes obstacles, the winner of prizes."},{"pageNumber":551,"pageContent":"III.51534III.51 (285) IndraViśvāmitra Gāthina12 verses: jagatī 1–3, triṣṭubh 4–9, gāyatrī 10–12, arranged in tr̥casThe hymn falls into four sets of tr̥cas, in three different meters. Since the hymn follows one of five verses, each tr̥ca should originally have been a single hymn, to conform to the normal patterns of arrangement within maṇḍalas. However, even if it did consist originally of four separate hymns, the evidence of larger ring composition discussed with regard to III.50 makes it likely that III.51 was an addition to the original Indra collection, which would once have ended with III.50.The first two tr̥cas consist of standard tropes of praise for Indra, with an empha-sis on the songs and singers that express this praise. There are no strong indications of unity within the tr̥cas. The third tr̥ca is devoted to Indra’s drinking of soma in company with the Maruts and is thus appropriate to the Midday Pressing, like several other Indra hymns in this maṇḍala (III.32, 35, 47, 50). The final tr̥ca is even more insistently focused on Indra’s soma-drinking.1. The bounteous supporter of the settled domains, worthy of hymns—to Indra have the lofty songs roared—the much-invoked one, having grown strong through well-turned (hymns), immortal, awakening every day.2. The superior man with a hundred resolves, a flood of powers—my songs approach Indra from all sides—winning spoils, splitting strongholds, swift at crossing the waters, attending to the ordinances, attending closely, finding the sun.3.

Praise him, victorious in every way, the smasher of hostility.4.

Entirely parallel to III.28 (a hymn to Agni), it concerns the offering of a sacrificial cake at each pressing of the soma sacrifice, with each pressing characterized by a different meter. The Morning Pressing is the subject of verses 1–4; the Midday Pressing (amply represented in other hymns of this cycle: see the introduction to III.51) merits only one verse (5), and the Third Pressing is likewise mentioned only once (vs. 6). The remaining two verses appear to have a more general application.1. (The soma) accompanied by roasted grain, by gruel, by cakes, by hymns—Indra, enjoy (this soma) of ours early in the morning.2. The cooked offering cake—enjoy it, Indra, and welcome it.To you do the oblations flow.3.

There is little or no connection among the parts, which were probably originally independent. However, the whole seems intended to glorify the poet Viśvāmitra and his family, the Kuśikas, as well as his patron, King Sudās, and the Bharatas. Moreover, several of the different parts have clear reminiscences of other hymns in the Indra cycle of this maṇḍala, and so the hymn serves as a sort of summary of the themes of this Indra collection.The beginning of the hymn (vss. 1–6) is the most conventional part, with its invitation to Indra to come to our ritual with gifts and to drink the soma. The most interesting feature is the mention of the pleasures of wife and home (vss. 4–6) and the envoi to Indra in verse 6, urging him to go home after consuming the soma at our sacrifice. (See also I.82.5–6.) This dismissal seems appropriate to the final hymn of the Indra collection and may in part account for this little hymn being appended here."},{"pageNumber":554,"pageContent":"III.53537The next section (vss. 7–14) is subtly soldered to the first: the final word of verse 6 is dákṣiṇāvat “accompanied by priestly gifts,” while the first phrase of verse 7 is imé bhojā́ḥ “these benefactors”—the word bhojá is used through-out the hymn devoted to the dakṣiṇā (X.106) to refer to the bestowers of the priestly gifts. The whole of this second section concerns the relationship of the poet Viśvāmitra and his family with his patron, King Sudās and his people, the Bharatas, via the mediation of Indra, whose powers the poet can command for the sake of Sudās and his subjects because of his poetic gifts. There are several reminiscences of previous Indra hymns in III. Verse 7, with the patrons com-pared to the Aṅgirases, recalls the extensive treatment of the Aṅgirases in III.31. Verse 9 gives a synopsis of III.33, in which Viśvāmitra stops the rivers flowing so Sudās and his troops can cross; the name Sudās is mentioned in this story only here. Viśvāmitra’s family, the Kuśikas, are found here in verses 9–11; in III.33.5 he calls himself “the son of Kuśika,” and a repeated verse containing the plural of the name serves as a ring-compositional marker for the whole of the Indra cycle of Maṇḍala III (III.30.20 = III.50.4), as discussed in the introduction to the latter hymn. This section ends with a slighting mention of a rival and appar-ently non-sacrificing group, whom Indra is urged to subjugate to Sudās and the Bharatas.The next two verses (15–16) are the most mysterious in the hymn; they both concern a female figure identified as sasarparī́, the formation and etymology of which is unclear and which may either be a proper name or an attributive charac-terizing adjective. (Our translation, “the squirming, sappy (cow called) Sasarparī,” is a portmanteau containing both adjectives evoked by the phonology and mor-phology of the word and the proper name; we consider it a multiple semi-pun.) The Anukramaṇī assigns these two verses to Vāc [=“speech”] Sasarparī, and some scholars consider that the figure the embodiment of the Kuśikas’ verbal art. In any case she seems to be responsible for the fame of the people she aids.The next four verses (17–20) appear to have no connection with the rest of the hymn. They are prayers to deflect various possible catastrophes that might befall a team of oxen and the vehicle they pull on a journey, and wish for safe return. This section reads as if it were a continuation of or expansion on the Zauberspruch at the end of III.33 against potential difficulties afflicting a team and its wagon at a ford.The final four verses (21–24) are very difficult to interpret. They have tradition-ally been taken as the expression of the implacable hostility between Viśvāmitra and Vasiṣṭha, which is a staple of later texts (e.g., the Mahābhārata). But there is no whiff of this personal hostility in the R̥gveda, in our opinion, and there is certainly no mention of Vasiṣṭha, direct or indirect, in the verses here. There is, however, hostility: verse 21 calls on Indra to help us defeat our enemy, and the next few verses express in colorful images the impotence of the enemy’s actions and weapons. The most puzzling verse is the final one, where the Bharatas, the people"},{"pageNumber":555,"pageContent":"III.53538of Sudās, celebrated in verse 12, appear to be presented in an unflattering light.

On the one hand, the second half of the hymn (starting with vs. 11) treats these deities as a list, granting a verse each to a number of gods and mentioning their familiar characteristics. This part is relatively straightforward.The first half, especially verses 2–9, is ostensibly devoted to Heaven and Earth, but, though it begins as a conventional praise of those paired deities, as often in All God hymns the divinity provides a point of departure for spec-ulation on the nature of things and unanswered questions about cosmic mat-ters; see especially the questions in verse 5, at the middle of this self-contained hymn-within-a-hymn. The emphasis on truth and reality and on the discovery of Heaven and Earth (for both themes see vss. 3–4), in combination with the uncer-tain questions, suggests that the point is that we only gradually and imperfectly discover the real dimensions and nature of the cosmos. The style in this portion is enigmatic, intense, and rhetorically intricate, especially in the climactic verse 9, where Heaven as the divine begetter, and perhaps the single principle, and heaven as a place, the home of the gods to which we also aspire, seem to be referred to simultaneously. This double reference is aided by the ambiguity of the first verb in the verse, ádhy emi, which can mean either “I go upon” or “I study.” Verse 10 clearly closes off that part of the hymn and makes the transition to the second part and its list of favored gods.The hymn begins with a verse to Agni and ends with a verse and a half to him, thus providing a larger ring around the two very different halves."},{"pageNumber":558,"pageContent":"III.545411.

This familiar Vedic mystery of simultaneous unity and diversity is further exempli-fied by the references to numerous gods (generally unnamed, but usually recog-nizable), especially in the second part of the hymn, in the manner of many All God hymns.However, the hymn has a more structured trajectory than most All God list hymns. The first part of the hymn treats the mystery of the birth of Agni; once Agni has been definitively born, Indra comes to the sacrifice as is usual. After three verses situating the action at a re-creation of the primordial early-morning sacrifice and introducing the poet (vss. 1–3), the hymn turns to a mystical description of fire dispersed in many places and hidden in the plants (4–5), and of its parents, the two kindling sticks (4–7), then of fire as it catches after the kindling (8–9) and sends its smoke and flames toward heaven (9–10). The kin-dling of Agni then takes on both a cosmic and a ritual dimension, as Night and Dawn and then the Dawns alone are identified as the mother(s) of the infant Agni, reflecting, of course, the kindling of the ritual fire at daybreak (11–16). Soon after (17–18) Indra puts in an appearance, coming to the early-morning sacrifice.Not all the referents are clear in these riddling verses, and in some verses several referents probably lurk beneath the enigmatic phraseology. For example, verse 17 serves as a transition verse between the fire-kindling verses and the appearance of Indra. The bull here could be Agni himself, or Soma (much of the vocabulary is"},{"pageNumber":561,"pageContent":"III.55544somian), or a prefiguring of Indra. Commentators differ in their identifications, and those given in brackets here are sometimes provisional.1.

In the earlier parts of the hymn these numbers seem to refer to cosmic entities—perhaps, for example, the three heavens and three earths making up the six in verse 2—and to cosmic creation, though the details are far from clear. But the number three takes a strongly ritual turn beginning with verse 5, referring to three daily rites, that is, to the three pressings of the soma sacrifice. Thus the poet implicitly identifies ritual structure with cosmic structure.1. Neither the tricky ones nor the clever transgress these: steadfast are the foremost commandments of the god.Neither the two world-halves without deceit nor the mountains standing fast are to be bowed down by knowing wiles.2. Six burdens does the One, unmoving, bear. The cows have approached the highest truth.Three great females stand below, as steeds: two were deposited in hiding; one has become visible.3. The bull of all forms [=Tvaṣṭar?] has three groins and three udders, with offspring in great quantity;having three faces, he is master [/husband], possessing great force.

The poet puts himself at the center of this activity, opening the hymn with a vivid image depicting his own inspiration as an untethered cow producing abundantly.1. He who has sifted through has found my inspired thought—a milk-cow, roaming for some distance without a cowherd,who just in a single day has given milk in abundance from her wellspring. So Indra and Agni (and other gods) are admirers of her—2. As are Indra and Pūṣan, the two bulls with dexterous hands. The (cows [=poems]), well treated, give unfailing milk like that of Heaven.When all the gods take pleasure in her, might I reach your benevolence there, o good ones.3. The sisters who seek the potency of the bull [=Agni], they recognize their embryo in him and do homage.The milk-cows, bellowing, proceed powerfully toward their child who bears wondrous forms.4.

The latter half of verse 1 describes the early morning, and therefore our view is that the first half does as well. We take the cow as the Dawn, whose milk is light, or pos-sibly the hymn sung at dawn, and this milk arises from the semen (see III.31.10 for the ellipsis) that is the fire of Agni or the sun or, less likely, soma. Agni, the son of the dakṣiṇā, the priestly gift that may be actually or metaphorically a cow, is a “go-between,” either as a messenger who encourages the morning or as one who goes between heaven and earth. Intricacy then replaces mystery in the second verse. In 2c, asmát, “because of us” or “from us,” may be construed with “awaken” or perhaps secondarily with “away”—“We have put the poetic inspiration of the miser away (from us).” In 2d cakr̥ma “we have put” should be construed twice with two preverbs and, as Geldner has pointed out, ā́ “here” can be construed with the two verbs it stands between.The remainder of the hymn is neither as mysterious nor as intricate as these opening verses. It becomes a plea for the Aśvins to appear at the early-morning soma-pressing, riding in their chariot, which is the sound of the hymns that carry the Aśvins to the sacrificial site.In verse 6 Jahnāvī probably refers to the “wife of Jahnu,” who is the father or ancestor of Viśvāmitra according to the Brāhmaṇas, although others have taken it as the name of the clan of Jahnu (Geldner) or as a name of the Ganges (Pirart 2001: 91). If the former, perhaps the poet reminds the Aśvins of the wealth that was with his family in the past in his wish to renew this friendship with them and their support for him.1. The milk-cow [=Dawn?] is yielding the desirable milk of the age-old (semen); the son [=Agni] of the priestly gift acts as go-between.She whose course is beautiful carries brightness here; the praise song of Dawn has awakened the Aśvins."},{"pageNumber":566,"pageContent":"III.595492.

With your well-harnessed horses and smooth-rolling chariot, wondrous ones, hear this signal call of the pressing stone.Is it not true that the inspired poets born long ago have said that you are the first to respond to trouble, Aśvins?4.

Here he is addressed as the god of alliances who “organizes” the peoples (vss. 1, 5), that is, who oversees the agreements, treaties, marriages, and other forms of alliance by which people assume relationships with one another. Just as the human king must abide by and protect such relationships, so Mitra as a"},{"pageNumber":567,"pageContent":"III.59550divine king provides divine sanction for them. The first verse underscores the nature of Mitra and plays on the appellative sense of mitrá “alliance.” It means both that the god of alliances arranges people when he is addressed and that an alliance arranges people when it is pronounced. This hymn marks the birth of an alliance, figured in verse 4 as the birth of Mitra himself at this time and in this place. The hymn does not say what kind of alliance has been born, but one possi-bility, suggested especially in the final two verses, is that it is the reciprocal alliance between gods and humans established through the sacrifice. In this alliance humans empower the gods through their praises and offerings, and the gods are expected to reciprocate by prospering humans.This hymn has been the subject of a close study by Thieme (1957: 38–59).1. Mitra arranges the peoples when (Alliance) is declared. Mitra upholds earth and heaven.Mitra watches over the nations with unblinking eye. To Mitra offer an offering of ghee.2. He who strives according to your commandment, o Mitra—let that mortal, bringing pleasing offerings, be at the fore, o Āditya.Helped by you, he is not crushed, nor is he conquered. No distress reaches him from near nor from afar.3. Free from disease, being invigorated through libation, with knees firm on the earth’s expanse,abiding under the commandment of the Āditya, we would be in Mitra’s good favor.4. Here Mitra, to be revered and very kind, has been born as a king of excellent dominion and a ritual adept.We would be in the good favor of him, who is worthy of the sacrifice, and in his propitious benevolence.5. The great Āditya is to be approached with reverence—he who arranges the peoples, who is very kind to the one singing praise.For him the most wonderful, for Mitra, offer this pleasing offering into the fire.6. The help of the god Mitra, who maintains the separate territories, brings gain;his brilliance holds bright renown.7. Wide-ranging Mitra, who surmounts heaven through his greatnessand earth through his renown—8. To Mitra with his power to dominate do the five peoples submit;he bears all the gods.9.

The “form” that the R̥bhus adopt in verse 1 may be the divine form they have earned. In verses 4–6 the poet turns to Indra and asks him to come to the soma-pressing along with the R̥bhus, now fully divine, and to drink the soma in the company of the R̥bhus. Because Indra and the R̥bhus are traveling by chariot, the poet deploys the imagery of prizewinning racehorses throughout these last verses. He even calls the R̥bhus themselves “prizewinners” in verse 7, though this metaphor is anticipated by vā́javant in verses 5 and 6. “Vāja” is the name of one of the R̥bhus, so on one level this means that Vāja is in the company of the other R̥bhus, but it also means that the R̥bhus, since they ride in Indra’s chariot, are or will be accompanied by the prize of victory.1. In one place and another, by their thought and family relationship, by their knowledge, o men, the fire-priests have arrived at these things:the craft by which, o sons of Sudhanvan, you have attained a sacrificial share, rapidly adopting a (different) form;2.

Note that halfway through the hymn (beginning with vs. 4), the direct 2nd-person address to Dawn changes to 3rd-person description. This change may mirror the development of the ritual: first the poet coaxes Dawn to appear, and when his pleas have been successful (the vocatives of the first verses are in part replaced by aorists and perfects of the immediate past), he turns his attention to the ritual her appearance has set in motion.1. O Dawn, prize-giver with a rich prize, bounteous—as a discerning one enjoy the praise of the singer.O goddess, as a young woman from of old, as Plenitude you proceed according to your commandment, you who bring all valuables.2.

However, it falls naturally into tr̥cas, and probably originally consisted of six three-verse hymns dedicated severally to Indra and Varuṇa (1–3), Br̥haspati (4–6), Pūṣan (7–9), Savitar (10–12), Soma (13–15), and Mitra and Varuṇa (16–18).In general the tr̥cas are relatively straightforward, even banal, but the first verse of the first tr̥ca is rhetorically dense and striking in imagery. It seems to suggest that our hymns, though they appear to be frenetically active, have lost their effectiveness, and therefore Indra and Varuṇa have ceased to act on behalf of their humans praisers and worshipers. It may not be entirely fanciful to conjecture that the simple, even simplis-tic, style of the remaining tr̥cas is an attempt to replace the “whirlwinds” of verbal art (of which there is much in Maṇḍala III) with a meeker and less ostentatious style.The most notable feature of this hymn is the fact that the first verse of the fourth tr̥ca, dedicated to Savitar (vs. 10), is the famous “Gāyatrī mantra,” with which orthodox Hindus begin their morning worship even today. In the context of R̥gvedic poetry, it must be said that the contents and form of this verse are not particularly striking. As was just suggested, this may in fact be its point.1.

The numbers of Agni and Indra hymns are roughly equivalent (Agni 1–15; Indra 16–32), but the Indra hymns are the more striking, and Indra is really the dominant god of the maṇḍala. The Indra sequence contains both the famous treatment of Indra’s birth (IV.18), with dialogue between him and his mother while he is still in the womb, and the almost equally famous hymn pair (IV.26–27) treating the theft of soma from heaven—along with hymns lacking fame but repaying atten-tion like IV.16 and 24. The important dialogue between Indra and Varuṇa (IV.42) is also found in this maṇḍala, and Indra is addressed jointly with Varuṇa also in IV.41, with Vāyu in 46–47, and with Br̥haspati in 49–50.Moreover, a particular preoccupation in the Agni hymns is the Vala myth, which is more properly an Indra (/Br̥haspati) narrative. Especially noteworthy in the Agni cycle is IV.5, an enigmatic hymn meditating on the craft of poetry.Maṇḍala IV also contains a sequence of five hymns dedicated to the R̥bhus (33–37), the most sustained treatment of these gods in the R̥gveda and fundamental to our understanding of their ritual and mythological nature. Other minor gods are recessive in the maṇḍala, however.The transcendent racehorse Dadhikrā is the recipient of three hymns (38–40). The final two hymns, 57 and 58, are unique in the R̥gveda. The first is dedicated to agricultural gods, a striking departure for a text that focuses on stock-breeding and barely mentions agriculture, and the second celebrates the ritual substance ghee (melted butter), a material offering fundamental to the ritual but meriting only one hymn in the R̥gveda, as opposed to the many allotted to its parallel substance soma.IV.1 (297) AgniVāmadeva Gautama20 verses: triṣṭubh, except aṣṭi 1, atijagatī 2, dhr̥ti 3This long and complex hymn contains an important account of the Vala myth: the opening of the cave containing the imprisoned cows and their release. Although the "},{"pageNumber":573,"pageContent":"IV.1556hero of this myth is, of course, ordinarily Indra, he does not appear in the hymn, even in disguised fashion. Instead, the troop that usually aids him in this exploit, the Aṅgirases, receive all the credit, though they are not mentioned by name. The absence of Indra can presumably be ascribed to the fact that this is a hymn to Agni; the larger question is why the Vala myth is appropriate to an Agni hymn. Here the answer must be the connection of both gods with the dawn: the ruddy Vala cows are regularly identified as the dawns, and the ritual fire is kindled at dawn. Indeed the Vala myth in this hymn is introduced by a reference to Agni’s primordial birth (vs. 11), and the (unnamed) Aṅgirases are identified as his begetters (vs. 12): perhaps they free the embryonic Agni enclosed “in the nest of the bull” (vss. 11–12) as they do the Vala cows. We have seen the connection between the birth of the ritual fire and the Vala myth elsewhere, for example, in III.31, an Indra hymn, where it was also mediated by dawn.The Vala myth is embedded within verses more conventionally devoted to Agni. The first five verses address Agni directly. He is first reminded of his original instal-lation by the gods and their purpose in so doing (vs. 1), and in the next four verses Agni is urged to use his closeness to Varuṇa in order to intercede for us mortals with that god. The next four verses praise Agni in the 3rd person, concentrating on his present state. Verses 10–12 form the transition to the Vala myth; in fact verse 10 might seem to go naturally with 6–9, but, with its reference to the treasure of the gods, it forms a ring with verse 18, which closes the Vala section. The heart of the Vala narrative consists of verses 13–17. The final two verses (19–20) provide a summarizing praise of Agni.1. You, o Agni, the god, did the gods of equal fervor install for always as the spoked wheel (of the sacrifice)—with such a purpose did they install you:[Gods addressing mortals:] “Sacrifice to the immortal [=Agni] among the mortals; beget the god god-directed and discerning;beget each one [=every new fire] as god-directed and discerning.”2. Agni, turn here to your brother Varuṇa, to the gods with your favor—to him who yearns for sacrifice,your oldest (brother) who yearns for sacrifice,the truthful son of Aditi who supports the settled domains, the king who supports the settled domains.3. O comrade, turn to your comrade, like a wheel to a swift (horse), like chariotry at speed,for us, o wondrous one, at speed.Agni, you (will) find grace in company with Varuṇa, with the all-radiant Maruts.To press out progeny, o blazing one, make luck; for us, wondrous one, make luck.4.

However, the first few verses of the hymn (vss. 2–4) enlarge on Agni’s role as messenger announced in verse 1. The hymn also contains an elaborate treatment (vss. 6–10, 13–14) of the various ritual services rendered to Agni by the sacrificers, and Agni is urged to dis-tinguish between those who do such service and other mortals (esp. vss. 11–12).

It begins fairly straightforwardly, however, with a treatment (vss. 1–3) of the kindling of the ritual fire, as so often at the beginning of Agni hymns. But starting with verse 4 a certain worried tone becomes apparent, about the relationship between the poet and the god Agni. The next four verses (5–8) contain anxious questions: what is Agni planning to say to various gods about us? These questions reflect the uncertainty produced by the ritual model: Agni is the ritual mediator between men and gods, and so in some sense everything the gods learn about us mortals is filtered through Agni, who may be—we worry—an unreli-able witness. The anxiety returns in verses 13–14, especially the former, in which the poet worries that Agni will punish him for the deeds of his relatives and acquain-tances. In between (vss. 9–12) are four verses, each beginning with the charged word r̥téna “by truth,” introducing a mixture of ritual and mythic activities, including one verse (11) on the Vala myth, a preoccupation of the Agni hymns in IV.What ties the various parts of the hymn together is not entirely clear, and it may be that the poet’s final verse, listing several types of verbal material, is meant to indicate that the hymn consists of a disparate collection of his works, although attempting to assign those labels to the different parts of the hymn would probably be taking the conceit too far.1. Make [=ignite] him here, the king, the Rudra of your ceremony, the Hotar whose sacrifice comes true in the two world-halves,Agni of golden form—(make him) for help for you in the face of unexpected thundering.2.

This ascription is certainly apt for the first five verses with their vividly hos-tile imagery, but starting with verse 6 the benefits that accrue to those who properly worship Agni are described (vss. 6–10). We identify ourselves as those worshipers in verses 8–9, and in verse 11 (see also vs. 8) the poet boasts of his hereditary poetic gifts, which enable him to get the attention and good favor of Agni. He explicitly identifies the source of his poetic skill as his father Gotama, but implicitly, through his phraseology, he also identifies himself with the Aṅgirases, the legendary poets who broke open the treasure cave of Vala, a myth that is much on the mind of the poet of these Agni hymns in IV (see, e.g., IV.1.13–17; 2.15–17; 3.11). The remaining verses (12–15) call on Agni to protect us with his protectors (presumably his flames) and to grant other blessings. The demons return in the last half verse (15cd).1. Make your leading edge like a broad onslaught. Drive like an aggressive king with his entourage,mowing down (enemies) along your thirsting onslaught. You are an archer: pierce the demons with your hottest (flames).2.

The signature word is padám, which occurs six times in the hymn (vss. 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 12); it is a significant pun, meaning both “track/footstep” and “word,” and in the full phrase “hidden track of the cow” (pada﻿́m . . . go﻿́r a﻿́pagūḷham, vs. 3) it refers to the arduous pursuit of cryptic meaning by way of verbal art. As often when R̥gvedic poets reflect on their craft, this poet wonders about the source of his own poetic inspiration and worries about the skills of other poets. Although some scholars consider this hymn to reflect a poetic con-test, we do not see a formal contest here, but simply the usual anxiety about poetic rivals. This poet identifies the source of his poetic gift as the god Agni (vss. 2–3, also 12), who bestowed this vision on him, though he was just a simple man (vss. 2, 6). He puzzles over the fact that thoroughly evil men can nonetheless also have the gift of poetry (vss. 4–5), but decides that because he (the poet) is morally uncompro-mised, Agni will shoulder the extra burden of bringing his (the poet’s) poetic vision to success (vs. 6). When he returns to the rival poets in verse 14, he is full of scorn for their talent: the patronage of Agni has clearly spelled the difference for our poet.The exact middle of the hymn (vss. 7–8, esp. 7cd) is an omphalos, which dis-plays in daunting fashion the control the poet has gained, thanks to Agni, over the encrypted mysteries of the sacrifice and its verbal expression. Verse 7 ends with the impossible hapax jábāru. There have been various attempts to interpret and etymologize this word, beginning with Yāska, but in our opinion this is beside the point: the word is a sort of abracadabra, a mystical expression, and the half verse"},{"pageNumber":583,"pageContent":"IV.5566in which it appears encapsulates the profound and transformative secret of the sac-rifice. This secret is under the protection of Agni in verse 8, but the poet has learned at least some of it.The following two verses (9–10) reflect on the dawn ritual and the kindling of the sacrificial fire then, though the mysteries are rather easier to penetrate than those in the omphalos verses. The poet then expresses hope for gifts from Agni in exchange for his own formulation of the truth (vs. 11) and asks somewhat nervous questions about how and whether he will gain these gifts (vss. 12–13). As already noted, verse 14 heaps scorn on rival poets with fewer verbal skills. The final verse is conventional praise of Agni, expressed in the aorist of the immediate past, indicating that the morning ritual and the hymn have come to an end.Another Vaiśvānara hymn, VI.9, follows much the same trajectory as this one, with similar reflections on the craft of poetry and the inspiration received from Agni.1. How might we, in concert, do service to Vaiśvānara, to Agni who gives rewards; how might we serve his lofty light?With his unfailing lofty growth he propped (heaven) like a post a bulwark.2. Do not spurn (him), the self-empowered god who gave this bounty to me, a mortal,a simple man—he shrewd, discriminating, the immortal Vaiśvānara, most manly, youthfully exuberant Agni.3. A great melody (he gave)—the doubly lofty, sharp-pointed, thousand-spurting, powerful bull—having found the word hidden like the track of the cow. Agni has proclaimed the inspired thought to me.4. Agni, the sharp-fanged, will snap at them with his hottest flame—he who (also) grants good rewards—at them who violate the ordinances of Varuṇa, the enduring ordinances dear to Mitra who attends to them.5. (You) pursuing (it [=the hidden word/track]) like brotherless maidens pursuing (men), (you) of evil ways like wives cheating (on?) their husbands,though being wicked, untruthful, untrue, you [=other singers] begot this deep track [/profound word].6. (But) this (track/word) is mine, o pure Agni! Since I, however small, do not violate (the ordinances), for me you have boldly placed the thought, like a heavy burden,lofty and deep, on your own youthfully exuberant, sevenfold “back” along with the pleasurable offering.7. May my hymnic vision, purifying through its conception, reach just to him [=Agni?] now, to the same one in the same way (as always [at the ritual]).On the hide of the grain [=ritual grass?] is the lovely (udder/name) of Pr̥śni [=sacrifice]; on the tip of the mount has (the mystical expression? the milk?) “jabāru” (also? been) mounted."},{"pageNumber":584,"pageContent":"IV.65678.

I have proclaimed the truth with reverence, on being asked, with hope of you [=your bounty], Jātavedas, if it [=the truth] is here.You hold sway over this, all of it—whatever wealth is in heaven and what on the earth.12. Is some of this wealth for us? What is the treasure?

The hymn in quite ritually focused, particularly in its first half (vss. 1–5). The mention of the post (vs. 3) and Agni’s circumambulation (vss. 3–5) identi-fies the ritual in question in these verses, an animal sacrifice: as we know from later detailed accounts of the ritual, the animals were tethered to the post before sacri-fice, and fire was carried around them. See III.8, dedicated to the sacrificial post.The subject of the second half is less clear, the ritual references both less precise and more poetically enigmatic. It is perhaps simply the kindling of fire at dawn, as so often, with striking and shifting descriptions of its birth and of its resulting flames. The most difficult part of the hymn is the first half of verse 7, and its trans-lation here is speculative.Although the hymn seems to fall into two halves, there is no reason to suppose that it is not a unitary composition. The exact ritual references of the first part simply open out to a general treatment of the ritual fire, by way of a transition (vss. 5–6) mentioning the fearsome aspects of Agni, perhaps suggested by the associa-tion with animal sacrifice.1.

The hymn begins, as often, with the ritual installation of the current sacrificial fire, which is set against the backdrop of the primal installation of Agni, treated in verses 1–5, in a non-insistent ring structure. Verses 6 and 7, though in different meters, express the cen-tral mysteries of Agni and therefore define a sort of omphalos. Verse 6 is structured as a series of paradoxes concerning the nature of fire. Verse 7, quite reminiscent of the omphalos verse IV.5.7, refers to the elements of the sacrifice in riddling fashion. The hymn then turns to Agni’s role as messenger between Earth and Heaven (vss. 8–9, 11, first mentioned in vs. 3), with some vivid metaphorical description of fire’s appearance and its consuming of flammable “food” (vss. 9–11).1.

He then praises Agni’s participation in the sacrifice, his brilliant appearance, and his protection of his mortal worshiper, ending with a prayer for good partnership with the gods and a strong statement of the umbilical tie between gods and men, as mediated through the sacrificial Agni. The image of the sacrifice as the shared udder of gods and men is also found in nearby Agni hymns: IV.7.7 and by implication IV.5.7.Although the content of the hymn is straightforward, the meter is quite unusual, indeed confined to this one hymn (see Oldenberg 1888: 98; Arnold 1905: 239–40). It is thus not surprising that the Anukramaṇī’s characterization of it, reproduced in the heading above, is not illuminating and is in fact somewhat misleading. Each verse consists of a series of five-syllable pādas (three per verse, except for vs. 5 containing four) followed by a single triṣṭubh pāda. The short pentads tend to pres-ent abbreviated syntactic constituents, such as similes or tightly organized noun"},{"pageNumber":590,"pageContent":"IV.11573phrases, while the culminating triṣṭubh provides the frame into which the earlier mosaic pieces can be fitted. However, as the hymn progresses, the group of pen-tad pādas begins to operate independently of the triṣṭubh finale. In this hymn the medium is in many ways the message.1. Agni, this (sacrifice) today may we bring to success with lauds of you—like a horse with praises,like a good resolve—(so that it) touches your heart.2. For, Agni, it is therefore that you have become the charioteer of good resolve,of skill that brings success, of lofty truth.3.

The middle two verses (3–4) contain seven repetitions of tvád “from you,” all but one stationed at the beginning of the pāda. Verse 5 begins with tvā́m, “you” in a differ-ent case, to bring that sequence to a close. Verse 5 also deploys playful oppositions of gods and mortals, and the final verse is marked by alliterative sequences.The hymn identifies Agni as the source of both material goods (vss. 3–4) and of poetic inspiration (vss. 2–3), and the highly wrought surface of this superficially simple hymn shows that the poet has put the latter gift to good use."},{"pageNumber":591,"pageContent":"IV.125741.

The second half (vss. 4–6) is entirely different: it begs for release from unspecified offenses done by us, and although Agni is addressed in the vocative in all three verses, the tone is distinctly Ādityan, reminiscent of Vasiṣṭha’s pleas for forgiveness from the most formidable of the Ādityas, Varuṇa, in Maṇḍala VII. In fact, the last verse (6) has a plural addressee (“good ones worthy of the sacrifice”) in addition to Agni, and the verse is repeated exactly in X.126.8, an insistently Ādityan hymn.1.

It forms a pair with the following hymn, IV.14, also devoted to Dawn though not so identified. For further on the similarities of these two hymns, see the introduction to IV.14.The last three verses are especially striking, with several vivid images of the tri-umph of light over darkness in verses 3–4, and in the final verse (5) a speculative question about the sun—why does it not fall out of the sky?1. Agni has looked toward the vanguard of the Dawns—benevolent (Agni) toward the treasure-conferring of the radiant (Dawns).Drive, Aśvins, to the dwelling of the one of good action. The Sun, the god, goes up with his light.2. God Savitar has braced his radiant beam upright, brandishing his banner like a warrior seeking cattle."},{"pageNumber":593,"pageContent":"IV.14576Varuṇa, Mitra, (and the other Ādityas?) proceed according to their commandment, when they cause the Sun to mount into heaven.3.

As prop of heaven, utterly fixed, he protects the vault.IV.14 (310) AgniVāmadeva Gautama5 verses: triṣṭubhLike IV.13 this is a dawn hymn, and, as was noted there, it is closely paired with that hymn. The chief divinities are the same, mentioned in more or less the same order: Agni, Dawn, the Aśvins, Savitar, and the Sun; the final verses are identical; and the first two verses are stylistic variants of each other. In verse 1 of both hymns Agni looks toward the Dawns, and the Aśvins [/Nāsatyas] are urged to come to the sacrifice; in verse 2 Savitar braces his beacon, and the Sun rises.The other two verses (3–4) deviate somewhat. In IV.13 these were devoted to the Sun, conveyed by seven mares, confronting darkness. Here verse 3 concerns Dawn as the horse conveying the Sun: the equine theme of IV.13.3 is thus matched, but with a different focus. In both hymns verse 4 also concerns driving, with horses that are “the best conveyors” (váhiṣṭha), but in IV.13 it is the Sun who is being conveyed, whereas in IV.14 it is the two Aśvins (unnamed).These paired hymns give us valuable insight into the R̥gvedic poets’ composi-tional techniques, showing how the poets could produce variety even from a tem-plate of fairly specific themes (here vss. 1–2), and where the template allowed more freedom in developing those themes (here vss. 3–4).1.

Its length marks it as out of order in the cycle, since it follows a sequence of shorter hymns, but its internal structure is not entirely clear. It is generally agreed that the first three verses form a tr̥ca dedicated to Agni, and could therefore, as an independent hymn, be properly placed in the Agni cycle. The next three verses (4–6) could also form a tr̥ca to Agni and could likewise be properly placed, but the mention of Sr̥ñjaya Daivavāta suggests that the final four verses (7–10), a dānastuti to Somaka Sāhadeva, belong with verses 4–6, since Somaka’s father, Sahadeva, is elsewhere (Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 7.34) identified as a Sr̥ñjaya.We are of the opinion that the hymn consists of an originally independent sin-gle tr̥ca (vss. 1–3), and a second tr̥ca (vss. 4–6) with a loosely attached four-verse dānastuti (7–10), but that it is unlikely that either of the tr̥cas formed a part of the original cycle. Note especially that the two preceding hymns, IV.13–14, are really not standard Agni hymns, but more generally applicable to the divinities of dawn, and this change in subject matter suggests that these dawn-centered hymns were added at some point at the end of the Agni cycle proper. Only later were the frag-ments found in IV.15 appended to that enlarged cycle.In any case, all three verses of the first tr̥ca concern Agni’s circling of the sacri-fice, a ritual act characteristic of the animal sacrifice, as we have seen previously in this maṇḍala (IV.6.3–5). The second tr̥ca, especially its second verse (5), seems to concern militant Agni and suggests that only a mortal who is a hero himself can"},{"pageNumber":595,"pageContent":"IV.16578control such a fire: the implication is that Sr̥ñjaya Daivavāta, mentioned in verse 4, is such a man. This provides a transition to the “praise of the gift” in verses 7–10, where a prince of the Sr̥ñjaya family is the patron. The poet praises Prince Sāhadevya for giving him two horses (playfully in vs. 7) and prays to the Aśvins to reward the prince with a long life. There is another, more subtle connection between 4–6 and 7–10: the last verse of the tr̥ca (vs. 6) alludes to the ritual drink soma (as “the red child of heaven”), though it is not named; the name (or hypo-coristic: note the -ka-suffix characteristic of nicknames) of the patron in 7–10 is Somaka (vs. 9).1. Agni, the Hotar at our ceremony, while being a prizewinning (horse), is led around,the god devoted to the sacrifice among the gods.2.

It begins with two verses devoted to the journey motif—Indra coming to our soma sacrifice—but already in the second half of verse 2 and the first half of verse 3 the"},{"pageNumber":596,"pageContent":"IV.16579legendary poet and sage Uśanā Kāvya, who will figure later in the hymn, is intro-duced by indirection. The Vala and Vr̥tra myths are interwoven in the next section of the hymn, verses 3cd through 8, their interpenetration encouraged by the fact that almost no participants are explicitly named in the earlier part of the section. The last two verses clearly separate the two myths: verse 7 by naming Vr̥tra, verse 8 by the very words of the dog Saramā and her naming of Indra’s companions in the Vala myth, the Aṅgirases.Verses 9–14 concern the saga of the hero Kutsa, the poet Uśanā Kāvya, and Indra, a story that is, as usual, narratively elusive. As noted above, Uśanā Kāvya was introduced earlier in the hymn by name; he is not named in this section, but deeds involving him in other references to the myth are also found here: Indra and Kutsa’s joint journey to his house for help (vs. 10ab; cf., e.g., I.130.9) and the help he provides to their venture (vs. 11), help which elsewhere takes the material form of the mace he presents to Indra (I.121.12, V.34.2).Our version also has the curious motif of the woman who seeks to tell the dif-ference between Indra and Kutsa, who have identical appearance (vs. 10cd). This reminds us of the Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa story (JB III.199–200), in which Kutsa was born from Indra’s thigh and therefore looks identical to Indra. Kutsa takes advan-tage of this by having sex with Indra’s wife, who claims, when Indra discovers them together, not to be able to tell Indra and Kutsa apart. The Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa story appears, at least to us, to have been secondarily generated to explain the enig-matic motif in our R̥gvedic verse, which does not suggest any misbehavior on the part of the truth-distinguishing woman. Certainly Indra and Kutsa in partnership go on to destroy named and nameless enemies and to tear off the wheel of the Sun’s chariot (vss. 12–13), an action also prominent, if enigmatic, in other mentions of this story (I.130.9, I.174.5, V.29.10). A successful act of distinguishing Indra (from Kutsa?) seems to be alluded to in verse 14b, bringing closure to this motif. This recognition was aided by the strong light of the sun. It is unclear whether the con-tribution of the sun’s light here has anything to do with the damage inflicted on his chariot by Indra and Kutsa.The remainder of the hymn consists of appeals to Indra for help in contests and battles and for largesse (vss. 15–19), with two closing verses (20–21) summing up the making of the poem and the hopes we have of it.The hymn is full of deep and surface puns, phonological play, and subtle echoes across verses, and the poet takes some delight in setting up and then frustrating our grammatical and mythological expectations.1. Let him drive here (to be) really present—the bounteous one possessing the silvery drink. Let his fallow bays run to us.It is just for him that we have pressed the well-skilled stalk.

The first section of the hymn (vss. 1–8) treats Indra’s deeds in the past (though with some interludes in the pres-ent, esp. vs. 5), particularly the Vr̥tra slaying and its cosmic repercussions. Verse 8 sums up this section by detailing the qualities that make Indra worthy of our atten-tion. In verses 9–13 Indra’s abilities to conquer foes and win prizes are celebrated for their present relevance. The following two verses (14 and 15, its stunted single-pāda adjunct) make a brief and quite obscure foray into the Etaśa myth. The final five verses (16–20), before the last (21) repeated from IV.16.21, express our hopes for Indra’s bounty and aid, and, especially, our longing for him to be in affectionate relationship with us.Several themes surface from time to time in the hymn. Indra is often called maghávan “bounteous (patron)” throughout (vss. 7, 8, 9, 11, 13 [twice], 20), even though our prayers for goods and services do not become insistent until the end. More striking is the motif of Indra’s birth and, especially, the uncertainty about the identity of his father. His birth in mentioned in verses 2, 4, 7, and 12. In verse 4 it is said that Heaven is considered to be his begetter, but “is considered” throws that statement into question, and it is not even clear whether “the best craftsman,” to whom the act is (also?) ascribed, is Heaven or not. It may well be Tvaṣṭar, called “good craftsman” elsewhere (I.85.9) and in apparent parental relationship with Indra in some passages (e.g., III.48.2–4; see also the next hymn, IV.18.3). Verse 12ab casts even more doubt on his parentage, which Indra himself seems not to be clear about. This birth motif foreshadows the next hymn, the famous IV.18 featuring the direct speech of Indra’s mother at the time of his birth.1. You, Indra, are great. To you did Earth, to you did Heaven magnanimously yield dominion.After you smashed Vr̥tra with your strength, you let loose the rivers, which had been swallowed by the serpent.2. At your birth Heaven trembled and Earth flinched in fear of your turbulence and of the battle fury that is yours.The well-founded mountains throbbed, the wastelands shuddered, and the waters ran.3. He split the mountain, hurling his mace with his strength, revealing his power, displaying his might.He smashed Vr̥tra with his mace in his exhilaration.

Through our insightful thought may we be charioteers who always win.IV.18 (314) IndraVāmadeva Gautama13 verses: triṣṭubhA famous and enigmatic hymn recounting the prodigious and unnatural birth of Indra, partly in dialogue form. The hymn begins with a two-verse exchange between Indra’s mother and the as-yet-unborn Indra: she tries to persuade him to be born in normal fashion, but, like many heroes world-wide, he insists on an unusual exit, from her side. Indra is already conscious of his great destiny (see vs. 2cd). The preg-nancy has lasted abnormally long (see vs. 4ab), and after the birth Indra’s mother appears to abandon him to make his own way (vss. 3ab, 4ab, 8ab, 10cd), but also hides him (vs. 5ab) and worries about his fate (vs. 11ab). Again like heroes the world over, Indra is born full-grown and ready to perform great feats (see vs. 5cd), so that his mother’s protection is not necessary. In verse 3 he follow his mother as she abandons him and ends up at Tvaṣṭar’s house, where he drinks Tvaṣṭar’s soma. Elsewhere Tvaṣṭar is presented as Indra’s father (e.g., III.48.2–4, possibly in the"},{"pageNumber":602,"pageContent":"IV.18585previous hymn IV.17.4), and by stealing and drinking his soma, Indra defeats him (see III.48, where Indra’s mother abets him). Our verse contains no mention of this rivalry and conflict, but it may be alluded to indirectly toward the end of the hymn (see below).In the middle part of the hymn (vss. 6–9) another set of voices (at least in our opinion) joins the dialogue, that of various waters. These waters seem to represent benevolent foster mothers (see esp. vss. 7–8), like the rivers attending the birth of Urvaśī’s son in X.95.7, and their protective aid for Indra contrasts with his mother’s ambivalence and alienation. But they are also assimilated to the waters released by Indra in the Vr̥tra myth, as Indra’s mother makes explicit in verse 7. It may be that both identities were suggested by a natural phenomenon, the breaking of a preg-nant woman’s waters right before birth; the sudden release of those waters is remi-niscent of the release in the Vr̥tra myth, while the association of the waters with the infant being born suggests their beneficent relationship with the fetus in the womb. Indra’s mother ends this section by disavowing any blame for Indra’s temporary disadvantage in the Indra–Vr̥tra battle (vs. 9). If we are correct, the second pāda of this verse alludes glancingly to snakes’ ability to reconfigure their jaws to swallow large prey, a striking naturalistic image—one of the incidental fragments of realia to be gleaned from the R̥gveda.The final verses of the hymn are even more puzzling than what precedes them. After the episode of the waters and the Vr̥tra battle, we return to the original scene of Indra’s birth and his mother’s abandonment of him (vs. 10), though in her worry about his isolation she follows him (vs. 11ab), a mirror image of him following her in verse 3ab. He does find a companion to aid in the Vr̥tra battle, namely Viṣṇu, in verse 11cd. The next verse (12) asks a series of rhetorical questions—or they would be rhetorical if we were certain of the answers. The questions center around a family tragedy of a type very familiar from world mythology: a father with mur-derous intent toward his son (possibly still in the womb; vs. 12b) and the killing of the father by the son (vs. 12d), an act that leaves his mother a widow (vs. 12a). Is the father Tvaṣṭar, mentioned briefly and without hostility in the earlier part of the hymn (vs. 3), or Vr̥tra, whose destruction was depicted several times (vss. 7cd, 9)—or both, or neither? In any case the questions are reminiscent of the question near the end of the famous Indra-Vr̥tra hymn I.32, when Indra flees after winning the battle: verse 14 “Whom did you see, Indra, as the avenger of the serpent when fear came into your heart after you smashed him, / and when you crossed over the ninety-nine flowing rivers, like a frightened falcon through the airy realms?” And the final verse of IV.18 (13) seems to depict Indra after such a flight, alone and in exile, eating taboo food out of necessity and witness to the dishonoring of his mother because of her widowed state. His own condition only improves when the falcon steals soma and brings it to him (vs. 13d), a tale that will be treated later in this cycle in IV.26–27.Although the abrupt shifts of scene and chronology and the lack of context in each new scene produce some frustration in the reader (not to speak of the"},{"pageNumber":603,"pageContent":"IV.18586translator), the vivid focus of each episode and the dramatic tension in each snippet of speech cause the hymn to resonate in the imagination long after a more rational account would have done.1. [Indra’s Mother:] Here is the ancient proven path from which all the gods were born.Just from it should he be born full-grown.—Do not cause your mother to fall [=miscarry] in that way.2. [Indra:] I will not go out from there—it’s a hard plunge. I will go out crossways, from your side.Many are the things as yet undone that are to be done by me: I will do battle with one and make peace with another.3. [Narrator:] He gazed after his mother going away. “I cannot not follow—now shall I follow!”In the house of Tvaṣṭar, Indra drank soma, a hundred’s worth of the pressed (drink) in the two cups.4.

He filled the two world-halves as he was being born.6. [Indra:] These (waters) flow, babbling, like truthful women together shouting their witness.Ask them! What is this they are saying? What rock, what barrier are the waters battering?7. [Indra’s Mother:] What did they say as invitations to him? Do the waters intend to take on Indra’s disgrace?It was my son who set loose these rivers, after having smashed Vr̥tra with his great murderous weapon.8. [Various voices of the waters:] It was not because of me that the young woman cast you aside. It was not because of me that Kuṣavā (Evil Birth) swallowed you.But it was certainly because of me that the waters would show mercy to the child. It was certainly because of me that Indra stood up with his might.9. [Indra’s Mother:] It was not because of me that the cobra, having pierced you down, smashed apart his jaws (to swallow) you, o bounteous one.Then, (though) pierced down, having gotten the upper hand, you utterly crushed the head of the Dāsa with your murderous weapon."},{"pageNumber":604,"pageContent":"IV.1958710.

In the first two verses Indra is chosen, by the gods and the world-halves, for the task, and he assumes the kingship. The actual slaying and the splitting of the mountains to set the waters free occupy the next verses (through vs. 5), and other feats of Indra regarding the waters—stopping them for his clients Turvīti and Vayya in verse 6, impreg-nating them in verse 7—are mentioned. Indeed, verse 7 lushly depicts the fertile and fructifying power of liquid in many forms. This main section of the hymn is brought to a close in verse 8, which efficiently summarizes the main points of the Vr̥tra myth.Verse 9 serves as a somewhat bizarre coda. It celebrates three of Indra’s great deeds that are regularly mentioned together: he rescues the shunned son of an unmarried girl, makes a blind man see, and causes a lame man to walk (cf., e.g., II.13.12, 15.7; I.112.8). But here each of these deeds has an odd twist: the boy is being eaten by female ants; the blind man “takes a serpent” (an unrecoverable pun or piece of slang, in our view); and the lame man is “broken in the ‘pot’ ” or “breaks the pot” (slang for “hip”?). And it is also unclear why this verse has been tacked onto the end of a hymn that is otherwise remarkably consistent thematically. It may be that the “unwed girls” (agrū́) in verse 7, a metaphor for the rivers, suggested to"},{"pageNumber":605,"pageContent":"IV.19588the poet the episode of the unwed girl (agrū́) who abandons her son out of shame, and it may also be that this proverbial episode of a mother’s abandonment of her son resonated with Indra’s own experience with his mother at his birth, treated so dramatically in the preceding hymn (IV.18).The hymn ends with two summary verses (10, 11). In the former the poet announces to Indra the hymn he has just completed, while the latter is the refrain verse of the Vāmadeva Indra cycle (see IV.16–17, 20–24).1. So it is you, mace-wielding Indra, that all the gods, our easily invoked helpers,and both world-halves choose now—singling you out, the great one alone, strong and lofty, at the smashing of Vr̥tra.2. Like old men the gods let go, and you became the universal king, Indra, acquiring your own true womb [=place].You smashed the serpent lying around the flood; you dug out the courses for all the nourishing streams.3. The insatiable serpent, stretched out, lying against the seven slopes,did you dismember with your mace in his jointless part, o Indra—(making him) not to be awakened, unawakening, gone to sleep.4. Indra made the earth shake to its bottom with his strength, as the wind does the water with its forces.He knotted up the strongholds, eager in his own strength; he cut down the peaks of the mountains.5. They burst, as women burst out their embryo. Like chariots the stones went forth all at once.You satisfied (the waters) flowing widely, and you subdued their waves. You made the blocked rivers flow, Indra.6. For Turvīti and Vayya you brought to rest the great flowing watercourse with its all-nourishing streamsand the moving flood, because of their reverence. You made the rivers easy to cross, Indra.7. He made the unwed girls swell like surging spurts (of water)—the parched young women knowing the truth.He saturated the wastelands and thirsty fields. Indra got milk from the barren cows, who thus had a husband of wondrous power.8. Having smashed Vr̥tra, he set loose the rivers, welcomed [/gurgling] through many dawns and autumns.Indra drilled out the streams, which had been surrounded and hard pressed, to flow along the earth.9.

Through our insightful thought may we be charioteers who always win.IV.20 (316) IndraVāmadeva Gautama11 verses: triṣṭubhThe general pattern of an invitation/journey hymn is followed here. Indra’s journey to our sacrifice is treated in the first two verses, with his attendance at the sacrifice and acceptance of the offerings found in the following two (3–4). The invitation is summarized in verse 5. His reciprocal obligation to give generously to his worship-ers dominates the rest of the hymn, and without overt mention of the Vala myth, the poet repeatedly likens Indra’s acts of giving to his opening of the cowpen and releasing its contents (vss. 6, 8, 9). A subtle reference to the Vr̥tra myth may be found in verse 7: no “obstructor” (varta﻿́r) keeps Indra from giving, using the root vr̥ “obstruct,” found in Vr̥tra, whose name is literally “obstacle.”The hymn several times uses gambling vocabulary (vss. 3, 8), and there are some other striking images, such as the two similes in the first half of verse 5.1. Here to us from afar and here to us from nearby will powerful Indra drive for help, creating his own superiority—the lord of men with the mace in his arm, with his most powerful (men) overcoming battlers in combat and conflicts.2. Here to us let Indra drive with his fallow bays, right here, turned our way for help and benefit.He will stand—that mace-bearing, bounteous one, conferring abundance—beside this sacrifice of ours at the gaining of prizes.3.

But the hymn veers off into a different, and deeply puzzling, direction. The pivot is verse 5, which begins with a relative clause as does"},{"pageNumber":608,"pageContent":"IV.21591verse 4, leading us to expect that the referent in verse 5 will be the same as in verse 4, namely Indra, the subject of our hymn. But it is not, as the last word reveals, but rather the Hotar, here almost certainly the god Agni.The next three verses (6–8) share a number of features: repeated phrases (espe-cially the go﻿́he phrase of 6b, 7c, 8c), metrical irregularity in their odd pādas (6c, 7a, 7c), morphological and syntactic parallelism, and patterns of phonological and morphosyntactic repetition. But what they especially share is almost impenetrable obscurity. In our admittedly speculative interpretation, these verses take off from the Agni verse (5) and treat simultaneously the kindling of the ritual fire, which initiates the sacrifice here and now, and the Vala myth. As we noted in the introduc-tion to IV.20, the twin of this hymn in some ways, the Vala myth, is a backgrounded model for Indra’s generous giving in that hymn. It should also be remembered that the Agni hymns of this maṇḍala frequently take the Vala myth as their subject (see esp. IV.1 and 2), despite the fact that Agni is not usually a participant in that myth. Thus a condensed version of the Vala myth embedded in an Indra hymn but focus-ing on Agni is compatible with the larger concerns of the Vāmadeva poets.In verse 6 the gods coming to the sacrifice seem to be compared to the Aṅgirases going to the Vala cave—though neither group is mentioned by name—and the seat of both groups is identified as the “secret place” (go﻿́ha) of the Auśija, a vr̥ddhi derivative that we interpret as referring to the whole company of Uśij-priests, or fire-priests. In the second half of the verse the ritual fire is kindled, though with difficulty. The kindled fire roars to life in verse 7a, enabling the sacrifice to proceed (pāda b) and the cows in the Vala cave to go forth (pādas cd)—expressed in increas-ingly compressed phraseology. The final verse of this section (8) is the one that most clearly alludes to the opening of the Vala cave, using several of the signature words of that myth, including the verb vidát “found, finds,” which several times in the Vala myth takes “cows” as object (I.62.3, V.45.8, X.68.11). But in our verse the object is omitted, presumably to allow the simultaneous reading “cows” (for the Vala myth) and “goods” (for the ritual here-and-now).Having thus provided Indra with a mythic model for generous giving (however cryptically phrased), the poet then reproaches Indra in verse 9 for not participating in the sacrificial give-and-take. The poet ends the hymn with a more conventional summary verse and plea for goods and help (vs. 10), followed by the Vāmadeva Indra-cycle refrain (vs. 11).1. Let Indra drive here, near to us, for help. Praised, let the champion be here as our feasting companion,he whose powers are many when he has grown strong, (whose) overwhelming dominion, like heaven, will thrive.2. Here will you praise the bullish forces of him alone, the powerfully brilliant and powerfully generous man,whose resolve, conquering and victorious like a sovereign king making ceremonial distributions, overwhelms the separate peoples."},{"pageNumber":609,"pageContent":"IV.215923. Let Indra along with the Maruts drive here from heaven or from the earth, swiftly from the sea or from fertile ground,from the realm of solar glory, or from afar, from the seat of truth, to help us.4. Who is master of substantial, lofty wealth, him will we praise at the ceremonial distributions—Indra,who is the winner along with Vāyu when (refreshments) consisting of cows are at stake and who boldly leads (us) forth to a better state.5.

The hymn begins (vs. 1) with a brief catalogue of the elements Indra wants at the ritual, which leads immediately to the praise of Indra’s uncon-trolled power, the terror he inspires in the cosmos, and the fortunate result of his greatest deed, the release of the waters following his defeat of Vr̥tra (vss. 2–7). Verse 8 marks a return to the ritual here-and-now, with a hope that our preparations will bring Indra to our sacrifice. Verses 9–10 then list the various things we want Indra to do for us, marked by the heavy repetition of “for us/to us” at the beginning of every half-verse (a pattern actually begun in vs. 8c with “toward us,” and ending with an extra repetition in the final pāda 10d). The hymn ends with the Vāmadeva Indra-cycle refrain (vs. 11).1.

These questions all concern the sacrificers’ relationship to Indra—which sacrificers have managed to attract and please Indra, how does Indra know who is sacrificing and where, who receives Indra’s bounty and comradeship and by what means. A preliminary and oblique answer is given in the second half of verse 4: “the god will take cognizance of my truths,” that is, my praise and sacred formulations, which will ensure that Indra will come to our sacrifice and share his bounty. This answer is elaborated upon in the last verses of the hymn. After this partial answer in verse 4 the questions take on a more intimate tone, inquiring into the nature of Indra’s friendship with his worshipers, who are now his comrades, whereas the first four verses were more concerned with the mechanics of attracting Indra to our particular sacrifice. A striking feature of these question verses is that, despite the poet’s eagerness for the presence and intimate comradeship of Indra, the god is always referred to in the 3rd person, and indeed the poet and sacrificers are almost always in the 3rd person as well. This 3rd-person distancing of Indra reminds us somewhat of the doubts expressed about Indra’s existence or at least"},{"pageNumber":612,"pageContent":"IV.23595his whereabouts in other R̥gvedic hymns; the 3rd-person reference suggests that the poet has not established the direct personal contact with the god that he desires.Verse 7 serves as a transition to the amplified answers of verses 8–10. In verse 7 Indra prepares to destroy “the lie,” the deceit that is inimical to the proper func-tioning of the cosmos. After Indra’s destruction of the lie, the ubiquitous and all-powerful force of “truth” can be celebrated in the remaining verses (8–10, before the refrain verse 11). These three verses contain twelve instances of the word r̥tá “truth,” most of them initial in their pāda. As Paul Thieme illuminatingly pointed out (1964: 30), r̥tá is the implicit answer to the questions posed earlier—the “how?” questions answered with “by means of truth,” the “which sacrificer?” questions by “the one who produces truth.” And we already saw that r̥tá as the answer was fore-shadowed in the middle of the hymn (vs. 4cd). Thus we can satisfactorily resolve the apparent lack of connection between the first two-thirds of the hymn, with its bar-rage of questions about Indra and the sacrifice, and the last third, with its insistently repeated “truth” and absolutely no mention of Indra, that led the Anukramaṇī to suggest the possibility of two different divinities for the hymn (Indra 1–7, 11; R̥ta 8–10). Indra by destroying the lie (vs. 7) gave free rein to the workings of truth described in verses 8–10.1. How did he [=priest?] strengthen the great one [=Indra]? Enjoying the sacrifice of what Hotar—(coming) to the soma as to an udder,eager for, enjoying, and drinking the stalk—has he waxed high for the blazing stakes?2. What hero has reached shared exhilaration with him? Who has attained it with his good favor?Has his bright (course) appeared? Will he be here with help for the strengthening of the one who has labored, eager to sacrifice?3. How does Indra hear (the call) being called? How, hearing it, does he know (the place for) his unhitching?What are his many distributions (of goods)? How do they call him a provider for the singer?4. How will the man who has zealously labored and produced insights attain the material goods that belong to him [=Indra]?The god will take cognizance of my truths, when he has accepted the homage that he will enjoy.5. How and what comradeship with a mortal does the god enjoy at the breaking of this dawn?How and what is his comradeship for his comrades, who have tugged their well-harnessed desire to him?6. Is his comradeship then a drinking vessel for his comrades? When will we proclaim his brotherhood to you?The surges (of soma?) for him are a marvel, lovely to see for their beauty.

Verses 3–5 are especially focused on the desperate efforts of the human antagonists to enlist Indra’s might on their own side. It is also clear that the offerings made by the successful supplicants must be made just so: in addition to soma, a whole sacrificial menu is specified, with a special emphasis on cooked foods (see esp. vss. 5, 7).The last three verses (8–10, before the Vāmadeva refrain in 11) lay bare the mecha-nism of the divine–human bargain that lies behind the first part of the hymn, and indeed behind the whole R̥gvedic enterprise more generally. Rather than casting the exchange relations between men and gods in the rosy light of mutual benefit and voluntary cooperation, the verses present the acquisition of Indra’s aid by mortals as a matter of cold-blooded haggling and crass calculations of price versus value received. In our interpretation, Indra even has an agent, in the person of his own wife. These verses are difficult, enigmatic, and apparently use the lexicon and phraseology"},{"pageNumber":614,"pageContent":"IV.24597of commercial transactions, a linguistic level barely attested elsewhere in Vedic. Consequently the meaning of the verses is much disputed, and we will provide here only our own interpretation (which follows Geldner’s in many, but not all, ways).In verse 8 Indra (or perhaps his wife, a possibility raised by Oldenberg and Geldner) takes a long hard look at the hostilities he’s being asked to participate in, and his wife calls him back home, presumably to sit out the conflict or at least to hold out for a better offer. In fact, in verse 9 Indra reports on a failed bit of hag-gling. An unidentified party seems to have made a bad deal, offering a higher price for an inferior product, in this case probably the help of a god less powerful than Indra (9a). With Indra’s own offer not accepted, he goes happily home “unsold” (9b), remarking that the other party did not seize his chance to replace the inferior product with a greater one, namely Indra himself (9c). He ends with what appears to be a maxim, mocking the negotiation prowess of the other party (9d). Verse 10, in our view (and ours alone?), is spoken by Indra’s wife, hawking her husband and his obstacle-smashing talent and naming her price for his sale. The price, ten cows, seems very low for such a god (especially considering how many hundreds of cows are elsewhere given to mortal poets and priests, at least according to dānastutis), and so it is possible or even likely that this is a bitter and rhetorical question, com-plaining about the stinginess of mortal purchasers. In any case, it’s a limited-term offer, as she expects Indra to be returned at the end of his mercenary service.The allusion to dānastutis above was purposeful, for this little set of verses not only occupies the position of a dānastuti in this hymn, but also has the slangy and derisory tone of many dānastutis and the same recognition of the commer-cial underpinnings of the relationship between patron and client. It may even be that, using Indra’s withdrawal as model, the poet is indirectly complaining about an ungenerous patron and threatening to withhold his poetic production unless he receives a better deal.1. What good praise will turn Indra here—the son of strength, facing our way—for our benefit?For the hero is the giver of good things to the singer, and he is the herdsman of our tribute, o peoples.2. He is to be summoned at the smashing of obstacles, he is to be invoked, and he is well praised—Indra, whose benefit is real.Here on his journey the bounteous one establishes wide space for the mortal soma-presser devoted to the sacred formulation.3. Just to him do men separately call at the encounter. Having given up their bodies, they make him their preserver,when the men of both camps, on opposite sides, have come to abandon (their bodies) in the winning of offspring and descendants.4. The settled peoples show their resolve at the hitching up (for battle), o powerful one, while they are gasping on opposite sides in the winning of the flood."},{"pageNumber":615,"pageContent":"IV.25598When the battling clans have rolled together, just then do those on the one side seek Indra at the moment of confrontation.5.

The hymn ends (vs. 8) with a comprehensive list of all who call upon Indra.A salient feature of this hymn is the focus on the various kinds of relationships a mortal may have with Indra: especially comradeship (vss. 1, 2, 6, 7), but also fel-lowship (literally yoke-fellowship, vs. 2), brotherhood (vs. 2), friendship (vs. 6), and kinship (vs. 6).1. Who, a manly one with a desire for the god, eagerly enjoys the comradeship of Indra today?Or who, having his soma pressed when his fire has been kindled, reverently invokes him for his great and decisive help?2.

Indra does not agree to comradeship with a rich miser, nor does he, the drinker of pressed soma, (agree to it) with one who does not press.He rips away his possessions and smites him naked.

Soma was being held captive in a well-fortified citadel there, guarded by an archer named Kr̥śānu. A falcon carried him off by stealth, and though shot at by Kr̥śānu, the bird only lost a single feather (a tale told more fully in several Brāhmaṇa accounts). Delivered to Manu, the first sacrificer, the soma was then available to be ritually prepared for Indra, who cannot perform his great deeds without it.The first of the two hymns is entirely couched as the speech of Indra (in our view, though the Anukramaṇī assigns at least vss. 4–7 to the poet Vāmadeva and takes the first three verses either as Vāmadeva’s speech [impersonating Indra] or as Indra’s himself). It begins (vss. 1–3) as a standard Indra ātmastuti (self-praise), with 1st-person boasting about his deeds and identities; see, for example, X.48–49. (On the ātmastuti in general, see Thompson 1997.) In verse 4 he addresses his usual warrior band, the Maruts, with a laud of the falcon as the best of birds because of his soma-stealing exploit, which he then narrates in overlapping sequence (focusing on the central deed, “he brought [the soma]”) in the remaining three verses (5–7). The last half of verse 7 alludes glancingly to the associated departure of the shad-owy figure Plenitude, the personification (or rather deification) of plenty, a frequent companion of Soma’s, presumably because of the association of the distribution of gifts with the performance of the Soma Sacrifice, especially the Morning Pressing. Judging from verse 7 in this hymn and verses 2–3 in the next one, Plenitude prob-ably was carried away from heaven at the same time as Soma—though the poet expresses some doubts in IV.27.3.1. I became Manu and the sun. I am Kakṣīvant, the inspired seer.I steered myself down to Kutsa, the son of Arjuna. I am Kavi Uśanā. Look at me!2. I gave land to the Ārya; I (gave) rain to the pious mortal.I led the bellowing waters. It is my will that the gods followed.3. I, in my exhilaration, broke apart all at once the nine and ninety fortresses of Śambara,and the hundredth, his dwelling place, to complete it, when I helped Divodāsa Atithigva.4. Let that bird stand out from (all other) birds, o Maruts, the swift-flying falcon from (all other) falcons,because the fine-feathered one, with his independent power that needed no (chariot-)wheel, brought to Manu the oblation that is pleasing to the gods.5. When he brought it from there, quivering (in fear), the bird, swift as thought, was sent surging along the wide path."},{"pageNumber":618,"pageContent":"IV.27601He traveled swiftly with the somian honey, and the falcon found fame here.6. Flying straight, the falcon, the bird, hanging onto the plant, brought from afar the gladdening, exhilarating drink,the soma, holding it firmly, having the gods on his side, having taken it from yonder high heaven.7. Having taken it, the falcon brought the soma, a thousand pressings and ten thousand all at once.Plenitude left behind the hostilities then, (as) in the exhilaration of soma the non-fool (leaves behind) fools.IV.27 (323) Falcon (1–4), Falcon or Indra (5) [Soma-Theft]Vāmadeva Gautama5 verses: triṣṭubh, except śakvarī 5The second of the pair of hymns devoted to the soma-theft, this one is told from Soma’s point of view, with Soma speaking the first two verses (again, in our opin-ion), in which Soma engages in some ātmastuti of his own. He boasts of his own knowledge (vs. 1ab) and power (vs. 2ab), but also in almost breathlessly abrupt fashion relates the sudden appearance of the falcon, his rescuer (vs. 1d) from con-finement (vs. 1b). Asserting that he was complicit in his escape (vs. 2ab), he then describes their departure, including that of Plenitude (see the introduction to the last hymn).The next two verses (3–4) freeze the dramatic moment when the archer Kr̥śānu, guardian of Soma, shoots at the fleeing falcon with his precious cargo, and man-ages only to shoot off one feather. The final verse (5) depicts Indra about to drink the soma, now ritually prepared and offered by the priests. In keeping with the archery theme, the verb used of Indra’s approach to the soma is an idiom (práti √dhā) ordinarily used of fixing an arrow to a bowstring and aiming it at the target.1. [Soma:] Even though still in the womb, I knew all their births through and through—those of the gods—but a hundred metal fortifications guarded me. Then the falcon!—and swiftly I flew away.2. [Soma:] He certainly did not carry me away against my will; I was superior to him in energy and valor.Plenitude left behind the hostilities (which were just standing) still, and (the falcon), swelling with strength, overtook the winds.3.

Indeed, Soma is presented as the equal partner of Indra in the performance of these deeds. The deeds themselves are the familiar ones: the slaying of Vr̥tra in order to free the waters (vs. 1), the tearing off of the Sun’s wheel with the Śuṣṇa saga obliquely alluded to (vs. 2), the destruction of earthly foes (vss. 3–4), and the opening of the Vala cave (vs. 5). The hymn is marked by a clever bit of ring composition: the waters freed from Vr̥tra’s imprisonment are as if “covered over” (a﻿́pihitā) in verse 1, while the same adjective “covered over” is found also in verse 5 (a﻿́pihitāni), where it refers both to those waters and to the cows freed from the Vala cave—thus suggesting the deep-structure similarity of those two myths.1. With you as yokemate, o Soma, and in partnership with you, Indra made the waters flow for Manu.He smashed the serpent; he let the seven rivers stream. He opened them up, like holes that had been covered over.2. With you as yokemate, o drop, Indra with his strength in a single day tore down the wheel of the Sun,which was rolling along the lofty back (of heaven). A whole lifetime of great deceit was set aside.3. Indra smashed and Agni burned the Dasyus before midday at the moment of confrontation, o drop.With his missile he laid low many thousands of them, who were travelling to the house of no exit [=grave] as if by their own intention.4.

Indra is urged to drive to our sacrifice, ignoring rival pressers, to drink soma jointly with us, and, as usual, to provide us with help and with wealth.1. Praised, o Indra, with your fallow bays drive here right up to us, with prizes and with help, to find exhilaration for yourself;(drive) even across the many pressings of the stranger, being hymned by songs, as one whose benefit is real.2.

In between lies a catalogue of many of Indra’s famous, and not so famous, deeds—though avoiding the most famous of these, the Vala and Vr̥tra myths (save in the repeated epithet “Vr̥tra-smasher,” vss. 1, 19, 22). The most detailed treatments are of Indra’s theft of the Sun’s wheel (vss. 4–6) and the smash-ing of Dawn’s cart (vss. 8–11), myths whose contents are not entirely clear to us, despite regular allusions to them. Both myths are also treated in X.138, and as in that hymn (see introductory remarks there), we see in both myths a reflection of Indra’s assertion of control over cosmic time by deregulating it, at least temporar-ily. This theme seems to be announced in verse 3c, immediately preceding the story of the Sun’s wheel.The other deeds are related in cursory fashion, one per verse, and the abundance of forms of utá “and” emphasizes the additive nature of the hymn, especially in its second part. In this it resembles the catalogue hymns devoted to the Aśvins’ rescues and favors to men.1. There is no one higher than you, Indra, and no one superior, o Vr̥tra-smasher—no one who is exactly as you are.2.

When you fought the swaggering gods, all of them, even though you were alone,and you smashed the rapacious ones, o Indra;6. And when for the mortal you let the Sun slip,and you helped Etaśa through your powers.7. And after that are you (still) the one best possessed of battle fury, o bounteous smasher of obstacles?At that time you passed over Dānu (lying there),8.

Because Indra’s presence is required in order for us to receive his help,"},{"pageNumber":623,"pageContent":"IV.31606the hymn is also framed as a journey/invitation hymn. The second verse asks which soma drink will most appeal to Indra, a semi-disguised expression of the usual worry that Indra will be attracted by rival pressers. This worry seems also to underlie the difficult second tr̥ca (vss. 4–6), with its condensed phraseology. Here the poet first calls on Indra to come here (vs. 4), then seems (in our interpreta-tion at least) to chide him slightly for tarrying (vs. 5), but finally announces (vs. 6) that Indra has arrived with both high spirits and equipment. (The references to the sun in vss. 5 and 6 are opaque, but we tentatively suggest that they refer to the early-morning soma sacrifice.) In the next tr̥ca (vss. 7–9) the poet seems reas-sured: despite Indra’s wide-ranging travels his generosity never flags and nothing gets in its way.In contrast to the middle verses 4–9, the last two tr̥cas (vss. 10–15) are quite straightforward and characterized by the insistent fronting of the pronoun “us/our,” which opens every verse, as well as several intermediate pādas (10bc, 12c). The message is simple: help us and give to us in every way possible, ending with a wish for fame among the gods, fame higher than heaven itself (vs. 15).1.

The poet urges Indra to come to us, with help and gifts, and promises praises of his great deeds (though the celebration of his specific deeds within the hymn is cursory—consisting of part of vs. 10) and oblations.Toward the end of the hymn, the requests for gifts become specific (esp. the tr̥ca of vss. 17–19) and somewhat peremptory (see esp. vs. 20). These verses (17–21) have the “feel” of a dānastuti, though they are without doubt addressed to Indra. The real dānastuti occupies the last tr̥ca (vss. 22–24), though the praise of Indra’s gifts in the preceding verses obviously serves as model for the human patron. These last three verses, and especially the middle verse 23, are quite opaque and, like many dānastutis, contain slangy expressions and words belonging to a different, and lower, linguistic register. All three verses praise “the two brown ones,” and the first of the verses announces itself as a formal praśasti (panegyric), with the verbal lexeme prá . . . śáṃsāmi. The referent of the two brown ones is unclear. The default assumption is horses, but the very peculiar verse 23 casts considerable doubt on this interpretation. We will not rehearse here the many strained interpretations of verse 23 (among which are some that concern puppets, some eyeballs) and simply provide our own. We suggest that the “two brown ones” are the two breasts of a woman given to the poet as a gift (along with cows and the like). (For what we take as similar praise of a gift-woman’s breasts in a dānastuti, see VIII.2.42.) In verse 23 the poet compares the now-bared breasts to dolls on a post (the slender trunk of the woman, presumably), and the travels he refers to in verses 23–24 are, in our inter-pretation, their movements during sex. Although this interpretation is not entirely"},{"pageNumber":625,"pageContent":"IV.32608secure, the competing interpretations are even less so, and the prurient nature of our suggested contents would fit the marked linguistic register of the dānastuti.1.

The R̥bhus are gods, but they are also priests, and much of the hymn refers to their work as sacrificial performers in the third soma pressing, the pressing with which they are associated (cf. vs. 11). This sacrificial work is sometimes directly expressed (e.g., vss. 2ab, 3cd, 9), but most often it is described in mythic narrative. For example, while verse 4 has been contro-versial, it likely refers to a distinctive rite of the Third Pressing in which the soma stalks already used in the first two pressings are beaten again to extract the soma juice for the Third Pressing. The “cow” that one R̥bhu tends is the soma stalks, which are thoroughly mangled or “carved” in the pressing and then “carried” away. Because the R̥bhus prepared the soma or perhaps even created the Third Pressing, they “attained immortality” and became gods. This leaves unexplained the verse’s"},{"pageNumber":627,"pageContent":"IV.33610repeated reference to the “year,” but perhaps the year represents the sacrificial day or even the period of the Third Pressing.The next verses (5–6) describe the institution of the Third Pressing. The princi-pal soma recipients in the Third Pressing are Indra and the three R̥bhus. The four soma cups that the R̥bhus construct from the one made by Tvaṣṭar thus represent the four soma recipients and the extension of the soma rite into the Third Pressing. Unfortunately, the narrative returns to deeper obscurity in verse 7. The story of the R̥bhus and Agohya occurs in other R̥bhu hymns (I.110.2–3 and 161.11–12), but none of the hymns provides enough information to know who Agohya is or the significance of the R̥bhus’ slumber in the house of Agohya. If there is a ritual reference here, it may be to an Atirātra or overnight soma rite, in which the Third Pressing is extended through the night into the next day. If that is the case, then the poet could be conflating different units of time as in verse 4, and the “twelve days” they remained with Agohya could be the hours of the night. One possibility is that Agohya is Savitar (cf. I.110.2–3), and that identification too would point to the night since Savitar is associated with the night. In verse 8 the “smooth running” chariot that stands still may be the sacrifice, elsewhere compared to a chariot, but the “all-rousing milk-cow of all shapes” remains elusive.Although there is significant competition for this honor, perhaps the most obscure of the stories is that of the R̥bhus’ rejuvenation of their parents (vss. 2–3ab). Their parents could be the sacrificer and his wife, who has an important ritual role in the Third Pressing and whose sexual power is a theme of that pressing. Or they could even be the two Aśvins, who in the classical soma rite are invoked in the morning fol-lowing an overnight soma rite. The word pita﻿́rā, though understood here and usually as an elliptical dual referring to father and mother, can mean “two fathers,” perhaps an oblique reference to the Aśvins. The Aśvins are part of the Morning Pressing and their reappearance at the end of the rite could constitute a kind of rejuvenation.The difficulties in the interpretation of the narratives in this hymn are reflected in some of the language of the hymns, especially at its beginning and end. The first verse imitates the clever artisanship of the R̥bhus by its own verbal intricacy. In pāda c the phrase taráṇibhir évaiḥ could be translated “along their transiting ways” and mean that the R̥bhus move actually or figuratively along the courses that cross heaven. But tara﻿́ṇi can also mean “surpassing,” and therefore the phrase might also refer to the “surpassing” ritual skill of the R̥bhus by which they encompass heaven. With equal justification, therefore, we could translate “(The R̥bhus,) sped by the wind, by their surpassing ways have encompassed heaven. . . . ” Pāda b interrupts and separates pāda a from cd, which continue it. In pāda b it is not clear what the “śvaitarī cow” is—it could be a kind of cow as Geldner suggests—but śvaítarī car-ries or suggests the sense of “gleaming white” and points to the identification of the cow as milk. If the priest has just drunk it, milk might form an underlayer of his speech, which he then offers to the gods. The infinitive upastíre “to spread an underlayer” evokes the upasta﻿́raṇa, the underlayer of butter that accompanies a puroḍāśa﻿́ or barley cake offering."},{"pageNumber":628,"pageContent":"IV.33611The last verse has a different kind of complexity. Pāda b begins na﻿́ r̥te﻿́ śrānta﻿́sya, and the problem particularly involves the word r̥te﻿́. The simplest and most common reading is to translate r̥te﻿́ as “except,” but it would then normally govern an ablative noun and there is none to be had. Our suggestion is that there is an ellipsis of an abla-tive sakhyā́t “companionship.” But further, we also suggest that r̥te﻿́ is a śleṣa, a pun, and means not only “except,” but also “in the truth,” that is, “according to the proper order of the sacrifice.” In this sense the word is construed with śrānta﻿́ “labored.” To try to capture the double meaning, we have translated the word twice in these two senses.1. To the R̥bhus I send forth my speech like a messenger—I call upon the śvaitarī milk-cow to spread an underlayer (for it)—to the artisans who, sped by the wind along their transiting ways, have encompassed heaven in a day.2. When the R̥bhus made fit preparations for their parents by their attentiveness, industry, and wondrous skills,right then they came into companionship with the gods. Clever, they brought prosperity to their zeal.3. They who made their parents, lying aged like two old posts, youths again—let them—Vāja, Vibhvan, and R̥bhu together with Indra—delighting in the honeyed (soma), help our sacrifice.4. When the R̥bhus guarded the cow through the year, when the R̥bhus carved the meat through the year,when they carried her leavings through the year, they attained immortality by these labors.5. The eldest said, “I will make two cups (from one).” The younger said, “We will make three.”The youngest said, “I will make four.” O R̥bhus, Tvaṣṭar wondered at that speech of yours.6. The noble men spoke the truth, for they did exactly that. According to their will, the R̥bhus followed that (will of theirs).Having seen the four cups, Tvaṣṭar gazed at them, bright shining like days.7. When the R̥bhus enjoyed the hospitality of Agohya for twelve days, sleeping (there),(then) they made the fields good and led the rivers; plants arose upon the dry land and waters upon the low ground.8. Who made the chariot smooth running and standing still for men, who (made) the all-rousing milk-cow of all shapes—let these R̥bhus fashion wealth for us, they of good help, good work, and good hands.9.

The gods are not in companionship (with men) except (for their companionship) with him who has labored in the truth.Now, o R̥bhus, establish good things for us at this Third Pressing.IV.34 (330) R̥bhusVāmadeva Gautama11 verses: triṣṭubhThis hymn is built upon an urgent appeal that the R̥bhus and Indra reward and prosper the sacrificers. That desire is expressed especially in the repetitions of the noun ratnadhe﻿́ya “the conferring of treasure” and adjective ratnadha﻿́/-dhā́ “con-ferring treasure.” Ratnadhe﻿́ya (1b, 4a, 11d) occurs in the first and last verses and thereby frames the hymn; ratnadha﻿́/-dhā́ (6d, 7d, 8d) is in the opening verses of the second half of the hymn. This repetition is amplified by the closely related phrases rayíṃ √dhā “confer riches” (10b) and rātíṃ √dhā “confer a gift” (10d), in the final verse before the extra-hymnic concluding verse 11.Such word and sound repetition is a broader strategy of this poet. So pādas 5a, 5c, and 6a all begin with ā́ “here” and their following pādas open with an m-sound and repeat nasals, while using relatively few stops: 5b maho﻿́ naro dráviṇaso gr̥ṇānā́ḥ, 5d imā́ ástaṃ navasvà iva gman, 6b imáṃ yajñáṃ námasā hūyámānāḥ. The result is a humming sound reminiscent of stotra chants in the classical Vedic rite. Then 6c, 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b, 8c, and 8d begin with forms of sajo﻿́ṣas “together” to emphasize the collectivity of gods who receive the soma. And finally, in a mirroring of verses 5–6, pādas 9a, 9c, and 10a begin with ye﻿́ “who.”Implicit in the hymn is an insistence that the R̥bhus, even if they were once mor-tals, are now gods, able to bestow gifts on the sacrificers. Verse 3 defines their dual status as divine recipients of soma and as priests who offered soma. The sacrifice belongs to them, for as priests “like Manu” they long ago offered the sacrifice, but they also received it as gods. They are called sūrí “patrons” (6c), a term that can apply to sacrificers or to gods who reward the priests of the sacrifice. In 11cd the R̥bhus are invoked to receive the soma together with unnamed kings, who again could be divine or human. But the poet places particular emphasis on their divinity. The linking of the R̥bhus with Indra, especially at the beginning and end of the hymn (1a, 5a, 6c, 11c), more than just names the principal divine recipients at the Third Pressing; it also"},{"pageNumber":630,"pageContent":"IV.34613reaffirms the divinity of the R̥bhus through their close relationship to Indra. In verses 7–8 the poet directly addresses Indra and invites him to drink the soma together with many of the other deities who receive offerings at the soma pressings, and then adds the R̥bhus (8b) to his address and to these divinities. The poet even creates an icon of their achievement of divinity. The one time in this hymn that they are directly called gods is the very last word of the last verse, which forms a climax to the hymn.One final note: at the beginning of the hymn, the poet names the three R̥bhus: R̥bhu, Vibhvan, and Vāja. Normally, the three together are called R̥bhus, of course, but elsewhere and here they can also be invoked by elliptical plurals of either of the other two names. In this hymn they are called Vājas in successive verses (3d, 4c, and 5a), an address likely inspired by the epithet vā́jaratna “whose treasure is victory’s prize” in verse 2. In 9d they are called Vibhūs, obviously patterning with Vibhvan. In the first half of verse 9 the poet associates the name “R̥bhu” with the gods’ typical deeds: they created a chariot for the Aśvins, rejuvenated their par-ents, and fashioned a cow and two horses. As noted before, most of these deeds refer to priestly action, since the chariot can be the sacrifice, the parents either the Aśvins themselves or the sacrificer and his wife, the cow the soma stalks, and the two horses the horses that bring Indra to the sacrificial area. In 9cd the poet uses the name “Vibhū” (or the form may be “Vibhu”) and the deeds he describes are more unusual. The R̥bhus do not elsewhere make armor, so the significance of this story is obscure. The other two deeds echo the plea for prosperity. As Geldner has noted, Yāska understands ŕ̥dhak both in the sense of “separate” (pr̥thak) and “prospering” (r̥dhnuvan). The first is the proper meaning of ŕ̥dhak, but if the second is suggested by the word’s similarity to √r̥dh “prosper,” then the verse implies that the Vibhūs both create and prosper the sacrificer’s world.1. Let R̥bhu, Vibhvan, Vāja, and Indra travel here toward this our sacrifice and toward their conferring of treasure (here),for at this time of the day [=evening] the goddess Holy Place has placed the drink (of soma) for you.

But through their ritual work, they “went along the path of immortality” and so entered the community of gods (3cd). The poet"},{"pageNumber":632,"pageContent":"IV.35615returns to this theme also at the end of the hymn in verse 8. He states that the R̥bhus became gods through their work (8a) and recalls that they were human—once again through addressing them with their patronymic—before they became immortal (8d). The concluding verse then invites the divine R̥bhus together with Indra to receive the soma at the Third Pressing.In the middle section of the hymn the poet mentions several of the R̥bhus’ great deeds (vs. 5), but his focus is on their act of dividing one soma cup into four (vss. 2–4). According to this hymn, Indra alone is the recipient of soma in the Midday Pressing, but Indra and the three R̥bhus are the principal soma recipients in the evening (vs. 7). The creation of four cups from one thus marks the transition from the single soma offering to Indra at midday to the four offerings in the evening and the institution of the Third Pressing.1. Travel here, children of strength! Do not keep away, o R̥bhus, sons of Sudhanvan,for in this pressing the conferring of treasure is yours. Let your exhilarating draughts follow after Indra.2. The R̥bhus’ conferring of treasure has come here; the drinking of well-pressed soma has become (yours),since by your good work and your good labor you divided the single cup fourfold.3.

The Third Pressing, the conferring of treasure, which you made by your good labor, o you of skillful hands,that is poured all around here for you, o R̥bhus. Drink it along with the exhilarating draughts belonging to Indra!IV.36 (332) R̥bhusVāmadeva Gautama9 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 9The first half of this hymn turns on the “proclamation” of the divinity of the R̥bhus and of their deeds (vss. 1, 3, 5) and the second on the prosperity they bring. The first verse already establishes the central themes of the hymn. The chariot with three wheels that rolls through space is likely the ritual with its three fires or possibly with its three soma-pressings. And just as the ritual flies from earth to heaven, so the R̥bhus prosper both earth and heaven.The ritual is key to the R̥bhus, since it is through their ritual acts that they became divine, and they continue to perform ritual acts, even as divinities. Verse 2 again refers to their perfect chariot—the perfect ritual that the R̥bhus carried out through their insight. Because they rode to heaven on that ritual, they are now offered soma at the Third Pressing (2cd). Verses 3–4 rehearse three of the well-known deeds of the R̥bhus, which are united by a sonic repetition: they rejuvenate their parents in order for them “to keep going” (cara﻿́thāya); in order to make the four principal soma offerings at the Third Pressing they “divided” one “cup into four” (ví cakra camasa﻿́ṃ ca﻿́turvayam); and “out of a cowhide” (ca﻿́rmaṇaḥ) they made a milk-giving cow. The cowhide in 4b may be a hide on which the stalks of the soma plant are beaten (the adhiṣavaṇacarman) to produce the soma juice. Since at the Third Pressing the stalks used in the first two pressings are beaten again to extract the soma juice, therefore the great deed of the R̥bhus might have been that they were able to extract more soma juice on the cowhide from old stalks and in that way make the cowhide into a cow once again, who gives soma as its milk. Or the cowhide may refer to the soma stalks themselves, the shredded remains of the previous pressings that are made to yield soma once again.In the second half of the hymn (vss. 5–9) the poet turns principally to the rewards that the R̥bhus bring. The poet announces the theme in verse 5 by proclaiming that those whom the R̥bhus help have “wide boundaries”—broad horizons, we might say. Great men, whether poets or warriors, are great because of the R̥bhus (vs. 6), and through the R̥bhus people gain wealth (5a, 6c, 8d), vigor (8d), fame (5a, 9bc), and descendants (9a).1.

The very perceptive ones who made from mind by insight the smooth-running chariot, which never overturns—(to you,) o Vājas, o R̥bhus, we now dedicate (the soma) of this pressing for you to drink.3. Your greatness became well proclaimed among the gods, o Vājas, R̥bhus, and Vibhūs:that you fashion your parents as youths for them to keep going, even though they were enfeebled, worn out by age.4.

That might indicate that the two parts were originally two different hymns, but the two parts show a thematic unity. Running through the hymn is the explicit and implicit image of the horse, although the meaning of the horse is constantly"},{"pageNumber":635,"pageContent":"IV.37618changing. The first verse does not mention a horse, but it invites the R̥bhus to come in their chariots to the sacrifice, so the horse implicitly carries the R̥bhus. In 4a the bahuvrīhi pī́voaśva might mean “(having) fat horses,” but we have taken it to refer to the butter offerings belonging to the R̥bhus, and therefore we have translated “(hav-ing) horses of fat,” just as the R̥bhus’ “blazing chariots” in the bahuvrīhi śuca﻿́dratha likely refers to the sacrificial fires. In 4b the R̥bhus themselves are addressed as prize-winning horses. The theme then becomes more pronounced in the second half of the hymn. In verse 5b they are summoned as a team of horses, and in 5d at least one of them is called a horseman. In verse 6 the sacrificer’s horse, here probably the hymn, is a steed that makes him a winner. And finally in verse 8 the wealth that the R̥bhus bring may be a horse, but this verse is problematic and discussed in more detail below.One of the lexical features of the hymn is the wording of the invocation to the Vājas and R̥bhukṣans. These are elliptical plurals. The “Vājas” refers to all three R̥bhus, who are most commonly named R̥bhu, Vāja, and Vibhvan. “R̥bhukṣan,” which means “Master of the R̥bhus,” can refer to Indra, but it can also be a name for one of the R̥bhus, that is, the R̥bhu who is named “R̥bhu.” The plural R̥bhukṣans here, therefore, are probably again just the three R̥bhus. In verse 5 the poet encodes two R̥bhus in the appellative use of their names: R̥bhu in r̥bhú “craftsman” (5a) and Vāja in vā́ja “prize” (5b). The name of the third R̥bhu, Vibhvan or Vibhū, does not appear in this verse, or anywhere else in the hymn. However, he may be the horseman (aśvín) in 5cd, for horses are “wide-ranging” (vibhú), as in III.6.9b vibha﻿́vo hí a﻿́śvāḥ “for your horses are wide-ranging.” The word aśvínam also anticipates the invocation of the Nāsatyas, that is, the Aśvins, in verse 8. The addition of the Aśvins may point to the use of this hymn in an Atirātra or Overnight Soma Rite, since in that rite the Aśvins are summoned in the early morning after the soma-pressing day.Verse 3 poses some difficulty because tryudā́ya, here translated “thrice ascend-ing,” is a hapax of unsure meaning. Perhaps wisely, Geldner does not try translating it at all. Sāyaṇa links tri- “three” to the three soma pressings, but the R̥bhus do not receive soma at the Morning or Midday Pressings. Therefore, while -udā́ya likely does describe soma pressing (sa﻿́vana), tri- may refer to three soma offerings to the three R̥bhus.But the most problematic verse is the last, and our interpretation is tentative. The verse appears to refer to a Horse Sacrifice. In the classical rite the horse is released to wander through various territories before it is finally sacrificed. Here the horse is the wealth that the R̥bhus, Indra, and the Aśvins bring from surround-ing lands. As the sacrificial horse is slaughtered and cut up, so wealth is generously apportioned to the sacrificers.1.

Although no doubt in part referring to a real horse belonging to Trasadasyu, king of the Pūrus, it also repre-sents the sacrificial horse of the great royal sacrifice, the Aśvamedha, and a symbol of Pūru, and then general Ārya, hegemony. In this capacity it is compared to the sun, in the last, triumphal verse.What the reader will notice most, however, is the exuberance and precision of the equine imagery, emphasizing especially the headlong speed of the horse and his constant goal: groups of female animals, presumably mares. The sense of speed is enhanced by the regular use of “and” to string verses together; indeed, the hymn begins with one. Unfortunately some of the imagery is not entirely clear; see espe-cially verse 4, where some of the translation is provisional."},{"pageNumber":637,"pageContent":"IV.38620Although the Anukramaṇī assigns the first verse to Heaven and Earth, it is more likely that Mitra and Varuṇa are the referents of the unspecified duals.1.

He is invoked along with a number of gods and thus appears to have achieved a measure of divinity, but the artistry of IV.38 has been replaced by the deployment of stiff and conventional formulae. It is, however, interesting to see how an encomium of this sort, presumably a particular type of occasional verse, would be constructed.1. The swift Dadhikrā—him will we now praise, and we will pay tribute to Heaven and to Earth.Let the Dawns, dawning, sweeten me. They will lead me across all difficult passages.2. Fulfilling my conception, I pay tribute to the great steed, to Dadhikrāvan, the bullish one of many favors,whom, triumphant, shining like fire, you gave to the Pūrus, o Mitra and Varuṇa, as one triumphant for the Pūrus.3. Whoever has paid tribute to the horse Dadhikrāvan when the fire has been kindled at the break of dawn,him let Aditi make without offense, in concert with Mitra and Varuṇa.4. Once we (have paid tribute to) the refreshment and the great nourishment of Dadhikrāvan, and have brought to mind the auspicious name of the Maruts,we call upon Varuṇa, Mitra, Agni, and mace-armed Indra for well-being.5. Both (sides) vie in invoking (him) just like Indra, as they rouse themselves and reverently approach the sacrifice.Dadhikrā, who makes sweetness for the mortal, have you, o Mitra and Varuṇa, given to us as our horse.6.

But when the hymn turns to jagatī, its style changes dramatically—to the exuberant, inventive, playful descriptions of the first Dadhikrā hymn, IV.38.

The language is equally dizzying and agile: the poet is fond of phonetic and mor-phological figures, several of them involving morphologically impossible hapaxes concocted by phonologically manipulating underlying morphology. (See esp. vs. 2.)The final verse (5) is an explosion of morphological figures: eight compounds ending in -sa﻿́d- “sitting” (pādas abc), growing closer and closer together, followed by four ending in -jā́- “born” crammed into the final pāda—which culminates in the last word r̥ta﻿́m “truth.” The referent of all these compounds is no longer the horse Dadhikrā, at least not directly. Rather, as with the last verse of IV.38, the horse is now identified with cosmic forces—the sun, but probably also the ritual fire—and these in turn identified with the king. (See Proferes 2007: 127–28.) This verse is much repeated and employed in later Vedic texts.1.

The poet speaks repeatedly of his desire for the friendship and compan-ionship of the two gods, repeatedly asks them for their help, and seeks material gain from them as well. Although the gods are not treated separately, the contents reflect Indra’s qualities more than Varuṇa’s, for the two are especially beseeched for aid in defeating rivals in contest and battles (vss. 2, 4, 6, 7, 11, with imagery derived from contests in vss. 8–9).1.

Beginning from a similar premise, Lommel (1951) argues that verses 1–6 were spoken by King Trasadasyu on the occasion of his royal consecration. Lommel points out that in the later royal consecration rite, the king is compared to both Varuṇa as dharmapati “lord of dharma” and to Indra as vr̥trahan “smasher of Vr̥tra.” Thus Trasadasyu identifies himself as both Indra and Varuṇa, and because of these identifications the poet of the hymn affirms that the king is “half a god” (vs. 8). Schmidt (1992) elaborated on this thesis, locating the hymn in a different ritual context. He argues that according to later Vedic tradition Varuṇa and Indra are dominant in different seasons, and this alternation between the two gods is visible in this hymn. So according to Schmidt (1992: 340), “King Trasadasyu impersonates both Varuṇa and Indra by performing their functions according to the demands of the seasons.” This hymn marks the transition from the settled period, in which the king enacts the role of Varuṇa, to the period of raiding and battle, when he becomes Indra. Thus it begins with the king’s identification with Varuṇa, but “in the third stanza the king affirms that he is not only Varuṇa but also Indra and thus announces the transition to his Indra-like activities which he details in the fifth and sixth stanza.” However the ritual context is interpreted, the hymn provides insight into the nature of kingship in the R̥gvedic period.It is not clear whose voice it is in verse 7. For Lommel it is the poet; for Geldner and Renou, Varuṇa. Schmidt (1992: 341) offers the interesting suggestion that these two possibilities need not exclude one another if at this point in the rite or at this time of the year, a priest impersonates Varuṇa. He surmises that when the king left for war, he installed a caretaker in the settlement, represented here by the poet."},{"pageNumber":642,"pageContent":"IV.42625Verse 8 refers to a legend about the birth of Trasadasyu, but its details are uncertain. According to Sieg (1902: 97–98), following a tradition mentioned in Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa XIII.5.4.5, Purukutsa performed a Horse Sacrifice with a horse named Daurgaha, and his son Trasadasyu was born as a result. As Lommel (1951: 37) points out, this reference to Trasadasyu’s birth would have enhanced his dignity and further justified his identification with Indra and Varuṇa because of the favor those gods showed to his mother. Sāyaṇa gives another, less likely ver-sion of the legend. According to this version, King Purukutsa Daurgaha had been captured. Seeing that the kingdom was left without a king, the principal wife of Purukutsa appealed to the Seven Seers, who offered a sacrifice to Indra and Varuṇa on her behalf, and the gods then gave her Trasadasyu as her son.In the final verses (9 and 10) the poet addresses Indra and Varuṇa in a dual dvandva compound indrāvaruṇā, which signals the gods’ close connection to one another. Thus, while the rest of the hymn describes the two sides of kingship, these last verses emphasize the unity of the kingship represented by the two gods and their union in King Trasadasyu. The poet’s final request for a cow “that does not kick” (a﻿́napasphurantī) may be explained by its possible double meaning. On the one hand, a cow that doesn’t kick is one that is easy to milk and therefore represents the prosperity that the poet hopes for (10a). On the other hand, as Renou notes, the description “never kicking” (a﻿́napasphur) is applied to the soma when it is compared to a cow in VIII.69.10. So then the cow in this verse may also be good soma, which will “elate” the gods (10b). Therefore, the cow “that does not kick” is both the successful sacrificial performance and the successful result of the sacrifice.1. [As Varuṇa:] Now as before, mine is the kingship of a lifelong ruler, so that all the immortals (are) ours:the gods follow the will of Varuṇa; I am king of the boundary of the highest covering [=the boundary of heaven].2. I am King Varuṇa. For me (the gods) uphold these foremost lordly powers;the gods follow the will of Varuṇa. I am king of the boundary of the highest covering.3. I, Varuṇa, am Indra. By my greatness, these two realms, wide and deep, have strong support.Like Tvaṣṭar, knowing all living beings, I pressed together the two world-halves and upheld them.4. I swelled the splashing (and mounting) waters; I upheld heaven on the seat of truth.Through the truth the son of Aditi possesses the truth, and he spread wide the threefold earth.5.

Of overwhelming power, I raise the dust.6. I have done all these things.

[The poet:] All living beings know this of you, and you proclaim these things to Varuṇa, o you ritual adept:you are famed as he who smashed obstacles; you, Indra, made the blocked rivers to flow.8. Our forefathers, the Seven Seers, were here, when Daurgaha was being bound.For her [=Purukutsa’s wife] they won by their sacrifice Trasadasyu, who overcomes obstacles like Indra (and) who is half a god.9. Because the wife of Purukutsa served you two with oblations and acts of homage, o Indra and Varuṇa,so then to her you two gave King Trasadasyu, who smashes obstacles (and) who is half a god.10. Having won, we should become elated by wealth, the gods by the oblation, and the cows by pasture land.All our days, o Indra and Varuṇa, grant to us the milk-cow that does not kick.IV.43 (339) AśvinsPurumī ḷha Sauhotra and Ajamīḷha Sauhotra7 verses: triṣṭubhThe first four verses of this hymn are filled with questions, with the poet seeking to identify the god or gods who will be most attentive to him. He begins by casting his net widely, with any and all gods potentially the answer to his petitions. (These plural possibilities are signaled grammatically and lexically: katama﻿́ “which one?” [1a, 2a, 2b] explicitly requires a choice from three or more possible answers, and “of those worthy of the sacrifice” [1a], “among the immortals” [1c], and “of the gods” [2b] allow these choices to be made from the full set of divinities.) But the questions soon pick the Aśvins out as the correct answer to the earlier questions. A query about their chariot (2cd), which the maiden Sūryā chose as her bridal conveyance, obliquely but uniquely identifies the Aśvins, and the remaining questions (vss. 3–4) focus on their ability and willingness to aid us.With our benefactors now identified as the Aśvins, the next two verses (5–6) concern their chariot journey (somewhat obscurely), with the announcement of the first sight of their chariot made in the second half of verse 6. In the final verse,"},{"pageNumber":644,"pageContent":"IV.43627identical to the last verse of IV.44, the poet reminds the gods that he has provided them with nourishment and asks for their return favor.The hymn displays a neat, but uninsistent, ring composition. In verse 1d the poet asks where to “fix” his praise and offerings to the god, using a form of the root śri; the same root is found in the final pāda of the hymn (7d), where our desire of the gods is, reciprocally, “fixed.” This complementarity is emphasized by the two mor-phologically parallel words that express what we offer to the gods (suṣṭutí “good praise,” 1d) and what we hope for in return (sumatí “good favor,” 7b).The hymn twice mentions the involvement of the Aśvins (and their chariot) in the marriage of Sūryā, the daughter of the Sun (vss. 2, 6), the second time in the present tense coinciding with our own first sight of their chariot. While most refer-ences to Sūryā and her marriage in Aśvin hymns are set in the mythic past, in this short Aśvin cycle (IV.43–45) Sūryā is present with the Aśvins when they come to the sacrifice, travelling with them on the same chariot (see IV.44.1, 45.1).1. Who will listen? Which one of those worthy of the sacrifice? Which god will take pleasure in our extolling?In whose heart among the immortals shall we fix this dearest divine good praise accompanied by good oblations?2. Who will have mercy? Which one (will be) the first to come? Which one of the gods (will be) the most wealful?What swift chariot with speeding horses do they say is the one that the Daughter of the Sun chose?3. For during days such as these you two come right away, like Indra to his ability at the decisive turn.You two, born from heaven as fine-feathered heavenly birds—by which one of your abilities do you become the most able?4.

Thereafter the hymn concen-trates solely on the Aśvins’ chariot journey to our sacrifice and the reciprocal ritual exchange (aid and goods for soma and other oblations) that will occur there. The threat of other sacrificers attracting the gods elsewhere is also on the poet’s mind (vss. 3–5).1. Today, o Aśvins, we would call your chariot of broad expanse here to its meeting with the cow,(the chariot) that conveys Sūryā, providing her a standing place, the best of many, whose team is hymns, the one seeking goods.2.

In IV.43 the poet began by asking who among the gods will listen to his prayers and come to him with aid. Having identified the Aśvins as his target, he briefly describes their chariot and its journey and announces its arrival. In IV.44 the poet once again calls the chariot and the Aśvins to his sacrifice and urges them to avoid the sacrifices of others.Here in this hymn (IV.45), the Aśvins’ chariot journey is depicted as happening simultaneously with the performance of the sacrifice, and in fact the two realms are to some extent conflated. Their chariot(s) and horses behave in the same way and are described with the same verb (vs. 2ab) as the beam of the kindled ritual fire (vs. 1a), and the Aśvins both come bringing honey and come for the honey offered them. (Honey is a leitmotif throughout the hymn, occurring at least once in each of the first five verses.) The ritual is also depicted in more detail than in the last two hymns: see the actions of the priest in verses 5ab and 7d. Moreover, the exact time at which the journey and the sacrifice are happening, namely dawn, is repeatedly mentioned (vss. 2, 4, 5), and the other light sources associated with the break of day have their place in the hymn: the ritual fires (1a, 5ab) and the sun (vss. 2, 6).As in the other two Aśvin hymns in this series, Sūryā, the daughter of the Sun, is present not merely in mythological memory but in the present, ritual time—but in this hymn she is not mentioned by name. Instead, an ingenious turn of phrase “three . . . are on (the chariot) as a pair” in verse 1 must refer to the pairing of the two Aśvins with Sūryā, especially since the word for “pair” mithuna﻿́ is regularly used for a sexual pairing. Her anonymous appearance in the first verse of the hymn suggests the fertile fruitfulness that the overflowing honey in the rest of the hymn also represents.The final verse of the hymn formulaically celebrates the Aśvins’ chariot, and this verse sums up not merely this hymn but the triad of Aśvin hymns that it closes.1. Now this radiant beam arises; the earth-encircling chariot is hitched up upon the back of this heaven.Three bringing nourishment [=Aśvins and Sūryā] are upon it [=the chariot] as a pair; a fourth, a skin-bag, teems with honey.2.

In particular both the sense and the syntactic con-struction of the simile in the second pāda of verse 1 are much disputed. On the basis of VI.14.3 we believe “the riches of the stranger” (rā́yo aryáḥ) to refer to Ārya people in general and their poets in particular.Note that the soma-drinking, the purpose of Vāyu’s journey, is mentioned only in the refrain, and that the time of day for the ritual, early morning, is only obliquely referred to, in verse 3."},{"pageNumber":649,"pageContent":"IV.496321.

It seems likely that IV.49 was indeed based, somewhat artificially, on those former hymns, as there is no standard ritual offering of soma to Indra and Br̥haspati as there is to Indra and Vāyu. Indeed, Br̥haspati does not otherwise drink soma in the R̥gveda (save for IV.50.10). Evidence for the dependence of this hymn on Indra and Vāyu hymns is found in the second pāda of verse 3, which is also found in I.135.7 with the grammatical subjects Indra and Vāyu. The elemen-tary and derivative nature of this hymn contrasts strongly with the richness of the following hymn (IV.50) to the same divinities.1. This dear oblation here is in your mouth, o Indra and Br̥haspati;the solemn speech and the exhilarating drink are being announced.2. This soma here is being poured in circles for you, o Indra and Br̥haspati,pleasing, to be drunk to exhilaration.3. Come here to our house, o Br̥haspati and Indra,as soma-drinkers to drink the soma.4.

(Of course, this unity may results from the combining of once sepa-rate elements.) Indeed, the hymn seems to encapsulate the historical development of the Vala myth, which concerns the freeing of the cows from the Vala cave where they were imprisoned, and its principal participants, Indra, Br̥haspati, and the Aṅgirases. As Schmidt has clearly shown (1968), Indra was the original hero of the Vala myth, in his role as priest-king and with his priestly weapons—songs and correctly formulated true speech—with the Aṅgiras singers as his helpers. In this role he received the epithet “br̥haspati.” But in time the epithet was split off into a separately conceived divine figure Br̥haspati, first as an alloform of Indra and then detached from Indra as an independent divinity who served as Indra’s priest—taking with him Indra’s priestly role, while Indra retained the roles of king and warrior. In this hymn we first see a unitary (Indra-)Br̥haspati figure, then the human equivalent of the split figure, in the form of king and “Formulator” priest. And finally the split divine figures, Indra and Br̥haspati, are invited to share the ritual.The first six verses are dedicated to the mythic deeds of Br̥haspati (or “Br̥haspati”) with the Vala myth occupying verses 2–5. The Aṅgirases are promi-nent, though not named. The final verse of this portion (6) clearly brings the sec-tion to a close, returning it to the present with explicit treatment of our ritual honoring of Br̥haspati, and wishes for our continued prosperity typically found in hymn-final verses. Verses 7–9 promise success of all sorts to the king who does honor to Br̥haspati and to his earthly representative, the “Formulator” (Brahmán), a role that will evolve into the later Purohita (house-priest of the king) (note the verb phrase puro﻿́ √dhā in vs. 1). This section seems to apply the lessons of the mythic past found in verses 1–6 to the contemporary situation and to establish a symbiotic relationship between Formulator and king, matching the relationship between the mythic Br̥haspati and the (unnamed) Indra, from whom Br̥haspati has been split. It follows logically that the last two verses (10–11) invite Br̥haspati and Indra to the sacrifice to drink the soma and bestow blessings on us.

Indeed, when the poet wishes to refer to a single dawn, he uses instead the word “light” (vs. 1) or an unspecified pronoun (vs. 6). The grammatical plurality of the sub-ject Dawns serves a thematic purpose: as in other dawn hymns the poet notes that each day’s dawn is different, yet paradoxically all dawns are the same, coming in an unbroken chain from the east day after day (see, e.g., vs. 8).As V. Yareham suggested (in an unpublished paper presented at the University of Texas Vedic Workshop, May 2007), the hymn is structured around an ompha-los verse (6), with concentric matching verses surrounding it: 1–2 / 10–11 and 3–5 / 7–9. The omphalos poses a central and essentially unanswerable question, the one that always arises about the dawn(s): how can they be both the same and different, and the poet expresses his anxiety that he cannot identify the particular dawn in the swarm of identical ones. Behind this anxiety is another one, seen especially in verses 4, 6, and 7, namely whether we, the current sacrifi-cers, will have the same material success with our dawn sacrifice as the ritualists of old.Otherwise, the imagery is of the usual type for dawn hymns: the brilliant beauty of the dawns in contrast to the darkness, which they banish; their abrupt arising in the east and their subsequent journey; and the prayers for largesse, reminding us that the dakṣiṇā, the priestly gifts, were distributed at the dawn sacrifice.1. Here has this light, the latest of many, stood (up) out of the east from the darkness, with its patterns.Now the daughters of Heaven radiating widely, the Dawns, will make a way for the people.2.

It is noteworthy that throughout the hymn, even in the requests for Savitar’s protection and benefits (vss. 1, 6–7), the god stays in the 3rd person, gram-matically distanced from us despite his direct involvement in our affairs.1.

This intimacy is achieved by the aorist of the immediate past that opens the hymn announcing his epiphany—“he has arrived!”—and by the vocatives and 2nd-person address that follow. The closeness of our rela-tionship with the god allows us to ask him for something more personal than the shelter and support requested in IV.53, namely (in the middle verse, vs. 3) for Savitar to intercede on our behalf with anyone, divine or mortal, whom we have offended.The hymn also makes heavy use of the verb sū “impel” from which Savitar’s name is derived: it is found in all verses but the first.1.

The last three tacked-on verses are extremely simple; not so the first and more substantial part of the hymn, which is full of difficulties and uncertainties, especially in verses 2 and 6.This first section opens with questions about identity (vs. 1): who among the gods will protect and defend us, and who (among mortals?) will provide a safe space at the sacrifice for the gods. The hymn provides a number of possible answers to the first question, starting in fact in the first verse: Heaven and Earth, Aditi, Mitra and Varuṇa. All of these recur in subsequent verses, along with others: Night and Dawn (vs. 3); Aryaman, Agni, and Indra and Viṣṇu (vs. 4); the Maruts (vs. 5); in addition to lesser divinities and powers like the Sindhu (vs. 3); Ahi Budhnya (vs. 6); and so on. It is likely that the hymn does not envisage a single answer to the question, though Aditi and the Ādityas continually surface in these verses, and Aditi, Mitra,"},{"pageNumber":657,"pageContent":"IV.55640and Varuṇa, named in verse 1, are again named in verse 7, which forms a ring with verse 1. Although a clear answer to the first question is not given, the verses describ-ing or invoking these named gods’ help are relatively clear (3–5, in addition to 1, 7).This leaves the second and second-to-last verses (2 and 6), symmetrically paired in this structure. In examining the hymn thus structurally, one can form the hypoth-esis that, since the other verses suggest answers to the first question in verse 1, these two verses provide the answer to the second question (1d): “Who will establish wide space for you at the ceremony, o gods?” Although this hypothesis does not solve all the difficulties, especially of the cryptic verse 2, it does offer a means to approach the problems. Certainly verse 2 can be interpreted as the depiction of a dawn sacri-fice: the Dawns appear to be the subject of pāda b (discriminators because they mark the boundary between night and day), and the chanters of pāda a can then be the priests. Pāda c can then refer to the distribution of the dakṣiṇā, priestly gifts, at the dawn ritual, and the subjects of pāda d can be the Dawns, the gods present at the sacrifice, or the poets—or all three. The sacrificial context returns, somewhat more clearly, in verse 6, where it seems that the priests reveal the actual sacrificial sub-stance in the same manner as the gods revealed the contents of the Vala cave (using the same verb). In both of the “sacrificial” verses, then, it seems that divine charac-teristics and mythical exploits are attributed to the presumably mortal participants.If these speculations about the structure of this hymn are at all correct, it is striking that the gods are identified by name and by role quite clearly, but the rit-ual participants are left deliberately unclear. This may be another example of the poets’ reflection on the mystical nature of the sacrifice and of the transformations it effects not only in the sacrificed substance but in the sacrificers themselves, tempo-rarily endowing the latter with a touch of divinity.1. Who is the protector among you (all), o good ones, who the defender? O Heaven and Earth, o Aditi—you should protect usfrom the stronger mortal, o Varuṇa and Mitra. Who will establish wide space for you at the ceremony, o gods?2. Those [=priests?] who will chant forth the ancient ordinances while the discriminators who are never fooled [=Dawns?] will dawn widely—they are the untiring distributors who make distribution. The wondrous ones whose insights are truth have shone.3. I reverently invoke the Housegoddess, Aditi, the Sindhu with chants, (invoke) divine Well-Being for comradeship.Night and Dawn, the undeceivable, will arrange it so that both day halves will keep guard over us.4. Aryaman clears out a path, and Varuṇa; the lord of refreshment, Agni, (clears out) a way easy to traverse.Indra and Viṣṇu—when you are being praised in our manly way, hold out shelter to us and defense along with attack.5.

The first four verses mix invoca-tions of Heaven and Earth at the current sacrifice with cosmogonic accounts of their creation (see esp. vs. 3 and its present-time counterpart in 1cd), but the ritual context is dominant. There are a number of puns. The short second hymn continues the ritual focus.1. Let great Heaven and Earth, the preeminent ones, come to be here with their light, with their gleaming rays [/at our gleaming chants],when, fixing the two lofty ones apart as the widest, the bull bellows to them along the ways that spread broadly.2.

With its num-ber of verses it is out of place in the collection, and its subject matter and tone are more “popular” than those of the core R̥gveda. It is not possible to determine whether the hymn we have now was assembled out of several separate hymns, but at least verses 1–3, dedicated to the Lord of the Field, hang together, though they are not metrically uniform. A curious feature in the later part of the hymn is the dual address (via a dual dvandva compound) to “Prosperity and Plow” (vss. 5, 7).Hymns like this give us precious glimpses into everyday life and the technical ter-minology of particular professions. The hymn is notable also for its address to the Furrow (vs. 6, see also 7), the first appearance of the feminine noun sī́tā, renowned in later Sanskrit of course as the name of Rāma’s noble wife in the Rāmāyaṇa.1. By means of the Lord of the Field as if by a concluded (alliance), may we winwhat prospers the cow, the horse. He will be gracious to one such as us.2.

The last is clearly correct.Ghee is here given the same type of exalted, high-style rhetorical treatment as the other crucial ritual substance, soma, with which it is also identified in this poem. Phraseology appropriate to soma is applied to the streams of ghee throughout, and, like soma, ghee becomes the focus of mystical speculations and also the subject of vivid images. It is not surprising that this significant sacrificial substance should receive such poetic glorification, especially given the importance of cows and cow imagery in the R̥gveda.What should really surprise us is that only this poet in this late and final hymn in just one maṇḍala should have seen fit to make ghee his subject. Soma, after all, has a whole maṇḍala of 114 hymns to itself. Grammatical accident may help account for the difference: so﻿́ma is grammatically masculine and thus easily personified, while ghr̥ta is grammatically neuter. However, the prominence of the cognate substance in Old Iranian (Aves. haoma, Old Persian hauma) and the existence of a lengthy praise hymn to deified Haoma in Younger Avestan (the Hōm Yašt, Yasna 9–10) testify to a long tradition of celebration of soma, which is not shared by ghee."},{"pageNumber":661,"pageContent":"IV.586441.

The majority of the hymns were composed by Ātreyas, descendants of Atri, thirty-six of whom are mentioned by the Anukramaṇī in Maṇḍala V. In the Anukramaṇī’s reckoning, only three of the Ātreyas—Vasuśruta (3–6), Sutambhara (11–14), and Śyāvāśva (52–59, 81–82)—composed more than one or two hymns, and only Atri himself, Śyāvāśva, and Avasyu Ātreya (31, 75) provided hymns to more than one deity or set of deities in this book. Unlike, for example, Maṇḍala III, the Viśvāmitra Family Book, the eponymous poet is thus not the major poet of Maṇḍala V. Rather, Atri is principally an ancestor, perhaps a fairly distant one, of a large family of poets. Atri appears as a figure in hymns by Ātreyas (2, 7, 15, 73, 74, 78) and in one hymn of his own (40), sometimes in reference to narratives associated with him, such as his rescue by the Aśvins (73.6, 78.4) or Atri’s restoration of the sun (40.6–8). In final verses poets occasionally refer to themselves and their people as “Atris” (22.4, 39.5, 40.9, 67.5)—a plural that only occurs in the Vth Maṇḍala. In addition to Atri and Ātreyas, there are other poets from families connected to the Atris in some way. Among them are Āṅgirasa poets, to whom two hymns (15, 35) are attrib-uted. The Āṅgirasa poets are one of the two dominant families in VIII, which also contains seven hymns ascribed to Ātreya poets (or in the case of VIII.91, a female [Ātreyī] poet). The presence of Āṅgirasa poets in V and of Ātreya poets in VIII points to the close connection between Atri poets and the Kāṇvas and Āṅgirasas. Geographically, the Atris ranged broadly from the rivers in the northwest, includ-ing the Kabul (Kubhā) and Kurram (Krumu) rivers, extending to the Yamunā in the east. Strikingly, it is the same poet, Śyāvāśva, who mentions rivers in the northwest (53.9) and the Yamunā (52.17).The Atris and their associates address a broader range of deities in their hymns than do many of the other poetic families. The distribution is as follows: Agni (1–28), Indra (29–40), the All Gods (41–51), the Maruts (52–61), Mitra and Varuṇa (62–72), the Aśvins (73–78), Dawn (79–80), Savitar (81–82), Parjanya (83), Earth (84), Varuṇa (85), Indra and Agni (86), and the Maruts (87). The last hymn, which returns to the Maruts, is an addition to the original collection and unusual in a number of respects. Metrically it is in a long lyric meter, and thematically it features an unusual pairing of the Maruts with Viṣṇu."},{"pageNumber":677,"pageContent":"V. 1660The Atri Maṇḍala contains a noteworthy collection of hymns to the All Gods (41–51). A number of these feature riddles and verbal play, but none is as challeng-ing as V.44, which Geldner called the most difficult hymn in the R̥gveda. The hymn does not name the god or gods it praises, but the very last verse mentions Agni and Soma, leaving the hearer to divine what the rest of the hymn is about. Complicating that task are lexical, syntactic, and morphological puzzles, ellipses without obvious resolution, and, above all, a likely dual reference that points to the mystery at the heart of the hymn.The Marut cycle attributed to Śyāvāśva Ātreya (52–61) contains the longest sequence of hymns dedicated to these gods in the R̥gveda and is a remark-ably exciting and satisfying achievement. Other hymns of note include two hymns to gods of the natural world, V.80 to Dawn and V.83 to Parjanya, the Thunderstorm. The first is the most famous and certainly one of the most beau-tiful of the hymns to Dawn in the R̥gveda, famed for its sensual portrayal of Dawn as a beautiful woman revealing herself to men. The latter is an energetic picture of the storm god, roaring loudly and flooding the earth. The rains are a constant theme in a number of the strongest hymns in this collection, including V.54, which vividly describes the Maruts and the storms they bring, and V.63, which rumbles repeated sounds in its praise of Mitra and Varuṇa as masters of the monsoons. The single hymn to Varuṇa in this collection, V.85, presents both a grand vision of the god as the creator of the world and a more intimate one of Varuṇa as a god who can forgive offenses and free people from them. In general, the Atri poets were at their best in describing natural phenomena, especially thunderstorms, which they both fervently desire and fear because of their power.V.1 (355) AgniBudha Ātreya and Gaviṣṭhira Ātreya12 verses: triṣṭubhThe hymn describes the kindling and birth of Agni in the morning rite. In the middle section of the hymn, the poet links verses by repeating an image from the second hemistich in the opening hemistich of the next verse. So in 4d and 5a Agni as a horse is born “at the beginning of days,” although in verse 4 this may be Agni as the sun, while in verse 5 Agni is clearly the sacrificial fire. Note the difference in color: the horse is “gleaming” or “white” in verse 4, but “ruddy” in verse 5. The poet almost repeats 5d in 6a, except that he has shifted the tense in 6d to a more dis-tant past indicating the passage of time between the verses. More loosely, in 6c Agni is a sage poet (kaví) and in 7a an “inspired” poet (vípra). In 7d the priests “groom” (mr̥janti) Agni, imagined as a horse, and in 8a “fit to be groomed, he is groomed” (mārjālyo﻿̀ mr̥jyate). In 8d Agni is ahead (prá √as) of other fires and in 9a he goes ahead (prá √i) of other sacrificers."},{"pageNumber":678,"pageContent":"V. 1661Though a common metaphor, the image of Agni as a horse or a chariot-driver is treated with originality. Most strikingly, in verse 3, instead of the priests awaken-ing Agni, Agni awakens the hymn, “the bridle” (raśanā́) of the horse that pulls the chariot, the sacrifice itself, while the dakṣiṇā, the sacrificial reward to the priests, is the horse. The end of the verse shifts to the metaphor of Agni as a growing child. The word for “tongues” of flame, juhū́, can also mean a sacrificial ladle, and this ambiguity is the basis for the ellipsis of the noun.1. Agni has awakened by the kindling wood of the peoples in response to Dawn, approaching like a milk-cow.Like young (birds) rising toward a branch, his radiant beams leap forth to heaven’s vault.2. The Hotar has awakened to sacrifice to the gods. Benevolent Agni has stood tall in the early morning.As he is kindled, his brightening face has become visible. The great god has become free from darkness.3. When he has awakened the bridle [=the hymn] of the (priestly) troop, blazing Agni is anointed with blazing cows [=milk].Then Reward is harnessed, racing toward the prize. Tall, with his tongues he suckled upon her [=the Ladle], who is stretched out.4. Toward Agni the thoughts of those seeking the gods converge, like eyes upon the sun.When Dawn and Night, differing in color, give birth to him, the gleaming prizewinning steed is born at the beginning of days.5. Since the thoroughbred has been born at the beginning of days—the ruddy one has been laid upon the laid wood—laying seven treasures in every house, Agni has taken his seat as the Hotar, the superior sacrificer.6. Agni took his seat as the Hotar, the superior sacrificer, in the lap of his mother, in the wide, sweet-smelling place [=the altar]—he, the young poet, outstanding among many, truth-possessing, the maintainer of the peoples, and kindled in their midst.7. Now they summon forth this inspired one bringing success in the rites, Agni the Hotar, with their acts of reverence.They groom with ghee their own prizewinning steed, who stretches through the two world-halves by truth.8. Fit to be groomed, he is groomed in his own (house) as master of the house, praised by poets, our kind guest.A bull of a thousand horns and having its power, o Agni, you are ahead of all the other (fires) by your strength.9. At once, Agni, you go ahead beyond the other (sacrificers), for him to whom you have become manifest as the most beloved,as one to be summoned, to be marveled at, far radiant, the dear guest of the clans of the sons of Manu."},{"pageNumber":679,"pageContent":"V. 266210.

We have spoken an extolling speech to the wise poet, the bull-strong bull.With reverence Gaviṣṭhira has rested his praise song in Agni, as if resting the wide-spreading golden disk in heaven.V.2 (356) AgniKumāra Ātreya or Vr̥śa Jāna or both12 verses: triṣṭubh, except śakvarī 12Geldner provides a long introduction to this hymn and concludes that it deals with the disappearance of the fire-god Agni as if he were a household or ritual fire that has suddenly gone out or a newly churned or kindled fire that does not emerge. More specifically, we suggest, it may have been composed as a prāyaścitti or expia-tion for a sacrificial fire that has gone out as offerings were poured into it and to accompany a rite of restoring the fire.In verses 1–2 the hidden child is Agni. The young mother (vs. 1) and wet nurse (vs. 2) could be the firewood (samídh fem.) that keeps the fire hidden, and the chief wife, the máhiṣī, who gave birth to Agni, may be a fire-churning stick (aráṇī fem.). Yet in verse 1 the poet assures himself that Agni will emerge and take his ritual place to the east as he usually does. The poet sees Agni far away from his place in the rite (vss. 3–4), but who is this Agni? Is he other fires, or, as we think more likely, the sun, moving from the east toward the west? Verse 5 offers syntactic chal-lenges—the masculine yéṣām and the sense of ná . . . cid—but the cattle or bulls of Agni that it mentions may be the flames (arká or arcí masc.?) that the poets hopes the god will drive to the sacrificial place. Agni should find release from the powers who would deny the fire to the poet and his peoples (vs. 6), and thus should release the sacrificers from whatever limits them (vs. 7). However, Agni has departed the sacrificial place in anger—a fact that one of the gods, perhaps Indra or Varuṇa or conceivably even Agni himself, has made plain. But Indra knows where Agni is and has guided the sacrificers so that they may recover him (vs. 8). Ultimately, nothing can keep Agni from the sacrificers, as the presence of Agni as the sun in heaven shows (vss. 9–10), and he will honor the command of the gods to help the sacrificer (vs. 12).Geldner also summarizes a narrative later connected to this hymn, mentioned in Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa XIII 3.12, Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa III 94, Br̥haddevatā V"},{"pageNumber":680,"pageContent":"V. 266312–23 and given also by Sāyaṇa. According to the version of the Br̥haddevatā, King Tryaruṇa was riding in a chariot driven by his purohita Vr̥śa Jāna. A brahmin boy was killed by the chariot, and the king blamed the purohita. Vr̥śa brought the boy back to life, but then stormed away in anger because of the king’s accusation. When the purohita departed, however, so did the fury of the king’s sacrificial fire and with it the ability of the fire to cook the oblations. Therefore the king went to Vr̥śa and persuaded him to return as his purohita and to restore the fire’s fury. When he came back, Vr̥śa found that a Piśācī woman in the king’s house had taken the fury of the king’s fire. But by reciting V.2.9 Vr̥śa caused the fury to return and to burn the Piśācī woman. As Geldner rightly concludes, this story draws on elements of the hymn, but the hymn is surely not based on it.1. In secret the young mother carries the child who is swaddled; she does not give him to his father.His face is not one that changes (its face): the peoples see it in front, set down in the circle of spokes.2. Young woman, who is this child whom you carry as his wet nurse? The chief wife has given birth to him,for the embryo grew strong through many autumns, and I saw him (newly) born, when his mother bore him.3. I saw him with golden teeth and flaming color far away from his homeland, showing the measure of his weapons,as I gave to him my immortal (soma) without impurity. What can those without Indra, without recitations, do to me?4. I saw him moving from his homeland into the distance, going in beauty in many ways like a herd (moving) together.They did not keep hold of him. Because he has been born, the young women become gray.5. Who will keep my little young blood separate from the cattle, which have never had a stranger as their herdsman?They who have kept hold of him, let them release him. The watchful one will drive the animals to us.6. Hostilities have set down the king of dwellings, the dwelling place of the peoples, among mortals.Let the formulations of Atri release him. Let them who scorn become those to be scorned.7. You loosed even Śunaḥśepa, who was bound, from his thousand (bonds), from the sacrificial post, since he exhausted himself (in sacrifice).So unloose the fetters from us, o Agni, watchful Hotar, after having taken your seat here.8. Because, becoming angry, you had gone from me, the protector of the commandments of the gods announced (that) to me.Because the knowing Indra has kept you in his sights, instructed by him have I come here, o Agni."},{"pageNumber":681,"pageContent":"V. 36649. Agni radiates in all directions with a lofty light. He makes visible all things by his greatness.He overpowers ungodly guiles and those of evil ways.

This praise song for you, o you who are powerfully born, have I, the inspired poet, fashioned as a clever artisan (fashions) a chariot.If, Agni, you will gladly receive that very (song), o god, thereby we would win the waters together with the sun.12. “The bull of powerful neck, having become full-grown, will drive together unchallenged the possessions of the stranger,”thus the immortals have spoken to this Agni here. He will offer protection to Manu bearing ritual grass; he will offer protection to Manu bearing offerings.V.3 (357) AgniVasuśruta Ātreya12 verses: triṣṭubhThe hymn opens with identifications of Agni with the Ādityas—Varuṇa and Mitra in verse 1 and Aryaman and Mitra in verse 2. The reason for these identi-fications is not immediately clear, and indeed in various ways the poet also mar-shals the presence of other gods: Indra in verse 1, the Maruts, Viṣṇu, and Rudra in verse 3, and all the gods again in verse 1. After invoking the presence of the gods, the poet then describes the installation of the sacrificial fire (vss. 4–5). In verses 6–7 he asks that the presence of the sacrificial fire also mark the presence of Agni’s help against those who are offending against his people and himself. He mentions evil speech (vs. 7) and curses brought against its speaker (vss. 7, 12) and also against thieves and cheats (vs. 11) threatening him. He therefore asks the god for rescue (vs. 9). This concern explains the prominence of the Ādityas at the beginning of the hymn, since they are the gods who oversee social relations among humans and therefore can protect against people who seek to harm others.1. You, o Agni, are Varuṇa when you are born. You become Mitra when you are kindled.In you are the all the gods, o son of strength. You are Indra for the pious mortal.2.

The poet draws attention to “we” and “you” by front-ing the personal pronouns and using their non-enclitic forms. He announces this strategy in the first verse, which begins with tvā́m “you,” and then the following verses largely describe Agni as the sacrificial fire, who conveys the oblations to the gods (vs. 2) and the gods to the oblations (vs. 4). Verses 5 and especially 6, the omphalos verse, mark a thematic movement from the sacrificial fire that serves the gods to the fire that mortals serve and that serves mortals. In verse 7 the first word of each pāda and in verse 8 the first word of each hemistich is “we” or “us.” Enclitic and non-enclitic forms of the 1st-person plural pronoun also occur in verses 9 and 10, and in verse 10 the poet personalizes the verse even more deeply by using 1st-person singular verbs: jo﻿́havīmi “I repeatedly invoke” and aśyām “may I attain.” The last verse abandons the 1st person altogether, instead refer-ring to the recipient of Agni’s favor as “he,” and with tvám “you” in the first pāda, it returns to the initial focus on Agni.1. In you, o Agni, goods-lord of goods, I find elation at the rites, o king.Through you we would win victory’s prize, racing to the prize. We would prevail against the battle-charges of mortals.2. Conveying our oblations, unaging Agni is our father, the one far-reaching, far-radiant, and lovely to see among us.Illuminate fully the refreshments of a well-run household. Mete out full measures of fame in our direction.3. The poet of the clans, the clanlord of the (clans) of the sons of Manu, blazing, purifying, ghee-backed Agni—him have you all installed as the Hotar knowing all things. He will win desirable rewards among the gods.4. Take pleasure, o Agni, along with the libation, aligning with the rays of the sun.Take pleasure in our kindling wood, o Jātavedas, and convey the gods here to eat the oblations.5. As the pleasing lord of the house and the guest in the home, journey to this our sacrifice since you are the knowing one.Having smashed to pieces all attacks, o Agni, bring here the sustenance of those challenging us.6.

Until the very end of the hymn, the poet uses the imperative except in verse 2, which has the subjunctive, and in verse 6, in which he announces that he is beseeching Evening and Dawn but does not directly state what he wishes to occur. However, he implies a request for strength by calling the two deities vayovŕ̥dh “increasing vigor.” The last verse, however, shows a decided shift that is signaled by the complete absence of a verb. Through the repeti-tion of the ritual call svā́hā, the verse marks the moment at which the priest makes the offering that should culminate or accomplish all the things urged before.1.

In verse 3 Agni gives the prizewinner, which may be Agni himself. In pāda d of the verse, therefore, the one who “journeys to what is valued” is Agni both as a god retrieving the reward for the sacrificers and as a metaphoric horse racing to the prize. Again in verse 7 Agni’s flames are horses and the prize toward which they strive is cattle, first men-tioned in verse 1, along with horses. Allusion to horses is indirect in verse 10, but in 10ab the priests “guide” Agni—assuming with Geldner and Renou that ajuryamur is haplology for ajuryáṃ yamur—as they might guide a horse. Then in d they hope for an “abundance of heroes and this abundance of swift horses.” There are various possible explanations for why the poet speaks of tyád “this” abundance. One is that there is a comparison between the horses they hope to gain and Agni’s flames imag-ined as horses. If so, then “this abundance” would mean an abundance of horses equivalent to the present abundance of flames.1. I think of Agni, who is the good one, to whom milk-cows go home,swift chargers (go) home, and our own prizewinners (go) home.– Bring refreshment for the praise singers.2.

The first pāda draws particular attention to the word with its repetition"},{"pageNumber":687,"pageContent":"V. 7670of sa(m): sákhāyaḥ sáṃ vaḥ samyáñcam. In the middle verses (4, 5, 7, 8) sám is echoed by the particle smā/sma “again,” or more exactly “as always.” The last verse (10) is in a different meter, and, marked by its opening íti “with these words,” it stands outside of the main body of the poem. The real concluding verse, therefore, is verse 9, in which sám is echoed again, this time by śám “luck.” The one verse in which neither sám nor one of its echo words occurs (6) is actually a dependent clause that is completed by verses 7–8. The sound repetitions thematically link the union (sám) of both the priests and the offerings, the return of Agni (sma/smā), and finally the good luck (śám) that the sacrifice will bring to Agni and the benefit that Agni will bring to both gods and humans.As mentioned above, the poet extends a statement across three verses (6–8). This highly unusual construction marks the climax of the hymn, which describes the moment when Agni “streams forth.” Indeed, the extended statement even iconically suggests the extension of the sacrificial fire as it creeps throughout the wood. However, this strategy creates challenging syntax: verse 6 is a relative clause describing Agni, verse 7 a causal clause that explains how it is that Agni is a homeland for Āyu and his descendants, and verse 8 concludes with the appear-ance of Agni.Finally, one philological explanation: in verse 7 we read ákṣitam rather than ā́kṣitam with the Padapāṭha.1.

Thematically the hymn emphasizes the roles of Agni as the fire of the household, of the clan, and of the clans col-lectively. The poet remembers that the ancestors kindled Agni (vss. 1–2), that their descendants, the present clans, continue to do so now (vs. 3), and that through Agni they gain sustenance (vs. 5).1. You, o Agni, did the truth-seekers kindle—the ancients (kindled) the ancient one—for your help, o you made with strength,(you) the much-glittering, all-nurturing one worthy of the sacrifice, the desirable master of the household, lord of the house.2.

Verses 2–3 form a single statement with two relative clauses joined by the marked conjunction utá. Verses 3–4 both begin with the same words utá sma “And . . . again,” and verse 5 also begins with a similar and conjunctive ádha sma “Then . . . again.” The final pāda also begins with utá, but sounds almost like an afterthought. Its seeming superflu-ity calls attention to it as an addition and thereby also to the serial concatenation across the hymn’s verses.Less clear is the purpose that such concatenation serves. One possibility is that this structure is a verbal icon of various kinds of ritual strings. Thus it might reflect the poet’s request in the first verse that Agni “convey our oblations in proper order.” That is, the connection of verses one to another might anticipate the connected sequence of offerings made into the fire. Or it might reflect the convergences of sacri-fices, sacrificial rewards, and sacrificial participants at the rite, all mentioned in verse 2, or the union of Agni’s flames, amplified by the image of metals smelted together in verse 5. Or it might even indicate the alliance between gods and humans signified by the appearance of Agni as Mitra, the god of alliances, in verse 6. Or all of the above.1. You, Agni, a god, do mortals summon, bearing offerings.I think you to be Jātavedas: convey our oblations in proper order.2.

Then he whose smoky flames all together join together—when Trita in heaven blows upon him like a blower [=smelter] (of metals), he becomes sharp as if at the blowing (of bellows).6. By your help, o Agni, and through my proclamations of (Agni as) Mitra, would I—would we cross over difficulties of mortals, as those repelling hatred do.7. Let our men (be) dominant over wealth, o Agni. Bring that here, o strong one!He makes us dwell in peace; he makes us thrive; he comes in order (for us) to gain the prize of victory. And let him be present to strengthen us in battles.V.10 (364) AgniGaya Ātreya7 verses: anuṣṭubh, except paṅkti 4, 7Oldenberg (1897: 390) remarks that this hymn “seems to stand parallel with” the preceding hymn, which is attributed to the same poet. The hymn comprises a direct and energetic plea for wealth both for those chanting praise songs and for their patrons, their sūrís, explicitly mentioned in verses 3 and 6. In verse 3 it is not clear whether “patrons” and “men” refer to patrons and priests or whether “men” is in apposition to patrons, and then in verse 4, whether those beautifying the songs are patrons or priests or both. If both, which we think most likely, then the “gifts of horses” could refer to actual horses that patrons bring and metaphoric horses, the songs that priests offer.The hymn is marked by repeated pointing at Agni as the one who can and should bring this wealth. So verses 2, 3, and 7 all begin with a 2nd-person pronoun followed immediately by an address to Agni: “You, o Agni!” In verse 2 there is a progression from Agni’s will to sacrifice, to his skill to do so, and finally to his “effective action” in performing the rite, at which point he becomes “worthy of the sacrifice,” that is, both worthy to perform his priest’s role and worthy to receive offerings as a god.1.

There is also an emphasis on Agni’s expanse: his radiance (vs. 1) and his smoke (vs. 3) touch heaven; he is a visible beacon (vss. 2, 3); he is present in every household (vs. 4); he is filled with vast power (śávas, vs. 5); and he even extends backward in time all the way to the first man, Vivasvant (vs. 3). The description of Agni as shining for the Bharatas (vs. 1) may explain why there is this emphasis on his expanse. The Agni of this hymn may be the tribal fire of the Bharatas, and therefore the poet wishes to emphasize Agni’s presence among all the people of the Bharatas and the extent of the Bharatas’ territory or power.1. The herdsman of the people has been born, the awakened, well-skilled Agni, for a new safe passage.His face covered with ghee, blazing (Agni) radiates brilliantly for the Bharatas with lofty (radiance) that touches heaven.2.

In verse 5 the poet contrasts himself and his truth-speaking with those who were apparently once his allies, whose words and whose attacks against him are now twisted and false. The questions in 4bcd are ironic, for in fact Agni offers no protection to a lying cheat. Pāda 4a might also be taken ironically or not: the bonds (bándhana) could be the bonds of friendship with Agni—in its other two R̥gvedic attestations the word means “connection” in a neutral or positive sense—or they could be the fetters that the poet clearly hopes are the cheat’s reward.1. Forth to lofty Agni, worthy of the sacrifice, to the bull of truth, the lord, do (I bring) my thought,well purified in my mouth at the sacrifice like ghee (in Agni’s mouth); I bring (forth) my song to be face-to-face with the bull.2.

The course of the hymn follows that growth of Agni. In verse 1 the sacrificers are just beginning to kindle Agni. He then spreads wide (vs. 4) and is made strong (vs. 5), until finally, in the last verse, he encompasses the gods.1. Chanting, we invoke you; chanting, we would kindle you,chanting, o Agni, for your help.2. For Agni we will conceive a praise song, an effective one today for him who touches heaven,for the god, as we seek goods.3. Agni is pleased at our songs—he the Hotar, who is here among the sons of Manu.He will perform sacrifice to the divine race.4. You, o Agni, are spread wide as the pleasing Hotar to be chosen.Through you they stretch out the sacrifice.5.

Here he fronts the name of Agni (vss. 1, 4–6) or a pronoun referring to Agni (vss. 2, 3) in every verse. Verses 2–3 are not so much exceptions as a variation of the structure of the other verses. These two verses form a single statement that withholds the name “Agni” until it is fronted in their last pāda, 3c. Then verse 4 and the following verses pick up “Agni” and continue with it as the first word in the verse.1. Agni—awaken him with a praise song, kindling the immortal one.He will place our oblations among the gods.2. Him they invoke in the rites—mortals (invoke) the immortal one, the god—to be the best sacrificer among the people of Manu,3.

By attributing the hymn to Dharuṇa, the Anukramaṇī implies that the poet is playing on his name, although it is likely that the Anukramaṇī derives the name of the poet from the repetition of this word. The purpose of this repetition of dharúṇa is to underscore the role of Agni as the “supporter of wealth, the support of goods” (vs. 1). The name of Agni is postponed to the very end of the line of this first verse and then is never mentioned again, although echoing Agni the next to last word of the hymn is the name of Atri."},{"pageNumber":695,"pageContent":"V.15678The rest of the hymn presents a number of linguistic and exegetical problems, and this translation accepts the minor emendation in verse 4c of jarase to járase proposed by Oldenberg. The second verse is particularly mysterious and the trans-lation does not fully unravel it. Geldner suggests that the unnamed subjects are the Aṅgirases, ancient singers, who established the truth as the foundation of the sacrifice in heaven and who, together with their “born” sons, attained the “unborn” Ādityas or the gods generally. We offer another view in the translation. In this inter-pretation, the subjects are priests, who by the truth of their words support the truth that is the rightly performed sacrifice, which itself is a support, the support of the gods. The priests support the sacrifice by placing it on its support, the heavenly ideal of the sacrifice. In doing so they also support the gods, who gather at the earthly sacrifice, the foundation of heaven. In this way the priests attained the unborn gods by means of their sacrificial fires that have been “born.” To be sure, like much else in this verse, the identification of those “born” is uncertain, but note that the bodies of Agni, the different sacrificial fires, are mentioned in verse 3 and that also in this verse the ancient Agni, this time in the singular, is “newly born.”In verse 5, as Geldner rightly notes, the image is from racing. The beckoning prize of victory maintains the diminishing strength of the racer. In the sacrificial context the prize may be Agni’s reward, the offerings of melted butter that revive the flagging fire. Thus according to the latter half of the verse, the fire hides within the wood, but after it is revived, it appears again majestically.1. I bring forth my song to the ritual master and poet worth finding, to the glorious ancient one.Seated in ghee is the very kind lord, the supporter of wealth, the support of goods, Agni.2. By truth they [=the priests] support truth, the support, on the powerful (support) of the sacrifice in the highest heaven,and (support) the superior men [=the gods], who have sat down on the support at the foundation of heaven—they who have attained the ones unborn by those born.3. They stretch out the bodies (of Agni), which keep away confinement, and great vitality, hard to surpass, for the ancient one.Though newly born, he would cross the boundaries (of the fireplace), but all around they hem him in, who is like a raging lion.4. When, spreading, like a mother you carry more and more peoples to be suckled and to see,and when *you awaken, acquiring more and more vitality, you go all around with varying forms in your single person.5. Now let the prize of victory protect the limit of your strength as you give as your milk broad support for wealth.Hiding your track like a thief, then appearing greatly for wealth, you have rescued Atri."},{"pageNumber":696,"pageContent":"V.16–17679V.16 (370) AgniPūru Ātreya5 verses: anuṣṭubh, except paṅkti 5This and the following hymn are attributed to the same poet, and indeed the two hymns show many parallels: they have the same meter and the same number of verses, and their concluding pāda is identical. Geldner notes that this hymn, like many of the Agni hymns of this maṇḍala, uses rare and affected expressions. Certainly the syntax in this hymn is challenging, especially in verses 3–4, whose complex construction marks the climax of the hymn. The two verses describe the point at which Agni is burning most brightly. At that moment he has become the powerful ally and benefactor of the sacrificers, and at that moment Agni shines beyond both heaven and earth.Both in these verses and elsewhere in the hymn the poet emphasizes the alliance among Agni, the priests, and their patrons. In verse 1, for example, the expression mitráṃ ná compares Agni to Mitra, the god of alliances, and simultaneously com-pares him to a mitrá, an ally. The first is the primary sense, as it is elsewhere, here especially because the hymn refers to Bhaga, another of the Ādityas, in verse 2.1. Because there is lofty vitality for radiance, chant to the god Agni,whom mortals have installed to the fore, like Mitra, with their proclamations.2. Because he is the Hotar of the peoples in the arms of skill throughout the days,Agni allots the oblation in the proper sequence, like Bhaga a wish.3. At our praise of this generous one and in our companionship with him full-flamed,our mightily roaring compatriot, in whom all (beings) have placed unbridled strength—4. For then, o Agni, (you are) ready to give abundant heroes to these (your companions)—the two world-halves do not encompass him, though youthful, nor his fame.5. Now come to us! Being sung, o Agni, bring here a desirable rewardto us and our patrons, who together will receive well-being.– And be present to strengthen us in battles.V.17 (371) AgniPūru Ātreya5 verses: anuṣṭubh, except paṅkti 5A striking image in this hymn is that of the mouth—the mouth of Agni, who receives the offerings, and the mouth of the priest, who recites the hymns. The poet"},{"pageNumber":697,"pageContent":"V.18680associates or even identifies these mouths in verse 2 by using ásya “of this one,” to refer to either Agni or the priest, and in verse 5, where the mouth is equally that of Agni and that of the priest. The poet insists on these two mouths because they are the means by which the patron of the sacrifice can think himself glorious (vs. 2). In verse 3, however, the poet refers only to the mouth of Agni and shifts to a sexual image. The “thrust” could be the thrust of the poet’s song or it could be the thrust of the fire-churning. Because it carries a sexual connotation, line c then describes the semen of Agni that gives birth to lofty flames.1. Here, o god, by his sacrifices the mortal (should summon) the mightier one for help;Pūru should summon Agni to give help, when a good rite has been performed.2. Since, by reason of the mouth of this one [=both Agni and the poet], o distributor [=sacrificer], you think yourself to have greater glory for yourself,(you should summon) him, the vault of heaven with his shimmering blaze, the delighting one beyond inspired thinking.3. Surely it is by the mouth and flame of this one, who is hitched up by thrust and song,by whose semen, like that of heaven, flames blaze aloft, 4. And it is by the will of this one—discerning, wondrous—that there are good things here on the chariot [=the sacrifice].So then Agni is proclaimed as the one to be invoked among all the clans.5. Since the desirable reward is now just ours, our patrons follow after the mouth (of Agni and the poet).O child of nourishment, protect us that we prevail. Be capable that we have well-being.– And be present to strengthen us in battles.V.18 (372) AgniMr̥ktavāhas Dvita Ātreya5 verses: anuṣṭubh, except paṅkti 5This hymn is a dānastuti, a praise of generous patrons. Renou calls it a dānastuti for the whole preceding sequence of hymns. Dvita, who calls himself, perhaps jokingly, mr̥ktávāhas “him of the broken vehicle,” summons Agni to reward Dvita’s patrons. Agni should give them fame, although this fame is also partly and directly created by the hymn itself. They deserve this reward because they have generously given Dvita a gift of many horses (vss. 3, 5). The hymn praises Dvita as well, if indirectly, when it mentions the “brilliant insight” of the singer (vs. 4), which because of him exists among the patrons."},{"pageNumber":698,"pageContent":"V.196811.

Renou even describes it as a collection of disjointed verses, and it is true that in its five verses the hymn has three different meters.The first two verses describe the birth of Agni in terms that suggest human birth. The fire is born from a womb of wood, its first covering, and appears with a caul of smoke, its second covering. Having emerged, it peeps out from the hollow of the lower churning stick that gave it birth. Then priests nurture Agni’s growth into manhood, and perhaps Agni himself, as Geldner suggests, becomes a fortress for them, or perhaps the sacrificial ground governed by Agni is their fortress.In verse 3 it is not clear who Śvaitreya might be. He could be Agni himself, whose kin would be his flames. Or he might be a clan leader or even, as Geldner argues, a racing bull. Because the relationship between Br̥haduktha and Śvaitreya is unclear, it is equally uncertain how to understand the relationship between 3ab and cd. Br̥haduktha is elsewhere a poet, and although the Anukramaṇī abstracts Vavri Ātreya as the name of the poet of this hymn from the vavrí “covering” in the first verse, it is more likely that Br̥haduktha is actually the poet. He is apparently seeking the prize the way a horse does. Oldenberg points out that in the Vājapeya sacrifice there is a mantra that invites the horse to drink honey, perhaps to give him strength, and perhaps this custom lies behind the simile in d.

The act would seem to be unholy, but that is merely Agni’s deception.The last verse apparently describes the fully mature Agni, flinging his flames in the wind. On this verse, see Hoffmann (1954/61: 46–47 [=1975: 375–76]); he is surely correct to read sandhr̥ṣájas, which could mean “daring warriors” or the like, instead of san dhr̥ṣájas with the Padapāṭha.1.

The dominant theme is the songs, which are explicitly mentioned in every verse except verse 2, and even there they are probably the understood object in ab. Verse 2 is the most interesting in the hymn because it is not clear to whom the poet refers. It sounds as though the people he criticizes are rival poets, who have prospered through Agni, but who are in some way not acting or not performing the ritual properly now.1.

The poet, whatever his name might be, pairs and links similar-sounding words and expressions. The last line of the first verse devā́n devayaté yaja (1d) is echoed in the first line of the last verse deváṃ vo devayajyáyā (4a). He fronts accented forms of the 2nd-person pronoun at the beginning of 2a (tvám) and 3a (tvā́m), both to be read disyllabically, as is normal for tvám but not for tvā́m. These repetitions are thematically the more significant since the poet emphasizes the 2nd-person address to Agni and his role as a god (vss. 3, 4) sacrificing to the gods. But there are other repetitions as well. For example verse 3 links su- and uṣ-sounds: mā́nuṣe . . . súprīta . . . srúcas . . . ānuṣák sújāta sárpirāsute.1. Like Manu, we would install you. Like Manu, we would kindle you.O Agni, Aṅgiras—like Manu, sacrifice to the gods for the one seeking the gods,2. For, o Agni, it is you who, well-pleased, are kindled among the people descended from Manu.The sacrificial ladles go to you in their proper order, o you, the well-born one whose drink is melted butter.3. It is you whom all the gods, as one, have made their messenger.Waiting upon you, o poet, they invoke you, a god, in the sacrifices.4.

In doing so, he may be play-ing on the significance of his name, which means “he to whom belongs every tune,” for he calls on himself to chant to Agni. The fire is installed as the Hotar of the rite, and like a Hotar he should be attentive. Therefore Viśvasāman asks that Agni be attentive to his praise and to his words. The references to Agni as the “Hotar within the clan” (vs. 1) and to the Atris (vs. 4) suggest that this short hymn was an address to the clan fire of the Atris, and of course the fire of a clan of poets ought to be especially attentive to the speech of poets and especially adorned by songs.1. O Viśvasāman, like Atri chant forth to him of purifying flame,who is to be invoked at the rites as the most delighting Hotar within the clan.2.

At the same time the ability of Agni to grant wealth and power also depends on the sacrificers who bring the ritual grass (3a), who establish Agni as their Hotar (3c), and whose words confer power on him (1d). The references to the tribes who pursue Agni (vs. 3) and to Agni himself as the one “who belongs to all lands” (vs. 4) suggest that the fire of this hymn either was or was at least compared to the common fire that united the various Ārya peoples.1. O Agni, bring here wealth that is overpowering through the power of your brillianceand that, with prizes at stake, will be powerful over the lands by means of my mouth [=my speech]."},{"pageNumber":702,"pageContent":"V.24–256852.

These four poets are brothers in the Gaupāyana family according to an itihāsa (legend) that is supposed to underlie X.57–60, although it is unlikely that these R̥gvedic hymns actually refer to this story. According to the story the second brother, Subandhu, was killed and brought back to life by the other three. In this hymn, the first and third verses are for protection, while the second verse, the one attributed to Subandhu, is a more generic call for wealth. The last verse simply asks for Agni’s favor without being clear what end his favor should serve. In a general way the hymn thus fits the story of the rescue of Subandhu, since the verses surrounding his verse concern the idea of rescue. But such echoes may explain the attribution of the hymn rather than the hymn itself.1. O Agni, be our nearest and our kind rescuer, providing (us) a shield.2. Agni is good and famed for goods. Arrive here and give the most brilliant wealth.3. Be attentive to us, and hear our summons. Give us freedom from anyone who wishes evil.4.

This organization would explain its position in the Ātreya Agni collection. A hymn of three tr̥cas can follow a hymn of four verses in the proper sequence in which hymns with a fewer number of either verses or strophes follow hymns with a greater number of verses or stro-phes. However, Oldenberg (1888: 188) also suggests that V.25–28 may be an added supplement to the Agni collection.In the first tr̥ca Agni is apparently first becoming present (vs. 2) and has begun to shine (vs. 3). Then in the second (vss. 4–6) the presence of Agni explodes, and the poet marks the force of Agni by constantly repeating his name at the beginning of every hemistich except one (5cd). In the final tr̥ca (vss. 7–9) the poet turns not so much to the sight of Agni as the sound of Agni. His louder and louder crackling is reflected in the words of the sacrifice and the other sounds of the sacrifice, nota-bly the sounds of the pressing stones that pound the soma, which are themselves regularly connected to the chants and recitations of the rite. The danger of tr̥cas, especially when the strophes are as thematically distinct as they are in this hymn, is that the hymn itself may seem to break into blocks. This poet uses ring composi-tion to unify the poem and to underscore its ultimate purpose. In 1d he says that Agni parṣati dviṣáḥ “will bring to safety from hatred,” and again in 9cd, at the end of the hymn, that sá no víśvā áti dvíṣaḥ / párṣat “he will bring us to safety across all hatreds.” While the two phrases obviously echo one another, note that the poet has not quite repeated himself. Most especially his first assertion seems to be a general one: Agni is the one who brings to safety. But in the last, Agni is the one who brings us to safety, applying Agni’s more general power to himself and his people.1. Here for you all I sing to the god Agni for his help. He is the one good for us.The son of (dawn’s) rays will give; the possessor of truth will bring to safety from hatred.2. For he is really present—the one whom even the ancients kindled, whom even the gods—he the very Hotar of gladdening tongue, who brings radiant goods through his bright light.3. By your best insight and most excellent favor toward us,o Agni, shine on us riches by reason of our well-plaited words, o you who are worthy to be chosen.4. Agni is king among the gods and Agni among mortals when he enters (among them).Agni is the conveyor of oblations for us. Serve Agni with your insights.5. Agni gives to the pious man an excellent son of very mighty fame and of very mighty formulations,one who cannot be overcome and who brings fame to his lord.6. Agni gives the lord of settlements who prevails in battle with his men;Agni (gives) the fast-running charger, the unvanquished victor."},{"pageNumber":704,"pageContent":"V.266877.

It draws on repeated pādas, especially although not exclusively in the final pādas of verses: 1c = VI.16.2c and VIII.102.16c; 2c = VII.16.4b; 4c = V.20.3a, VIII.60.1b, and X.21.1b; 5c = I.12.4c and VIII.44.14c; 7c = V.22.2b; and 9c = I.39.5d. Geldner provides a complete list of the repetitions. As such, it is reminiscent of the assemblages that constitute the kin-dling verses in several priestly families (see V.28 below). The first two tr̥cas (vss. 1–3, 4–6) are a direct address to Agni to assume his role as the one who conveys obla-tions to the gods and perfects the ritual. In the third tr̥ca (vss. 7–9) the poet turns to his fellow priests, telling them to install the fire, prepare the seat for the gods, and perform the rites in order, and then in the final verse, with the fire now blazing and the priests performing their roles, he invites various gods, perhaps representing the All Gods, to take their seats.1. O purifying Agni, with your radiance and with your gladdening tongue, o god,convey the gods hither and sacrifice.2. O you with ghee-covered back, o you of shimmering radiance, we beg you of sunlike appearance:convey the gods hither to pursue (our oblations).3. O poet, we would kindle you, the brilliant one whose oblations are worth pursuing,the lofty one in the rite, o Agni.4.

Nonetheless, Oldenberg (Noten and 1897) regards it as an addition to the original collection.The hymn is a dānastuti addressed to allied patrons or kings. The Anukramaṇī names three patrons, but, as Oldenberg (1897) and Geldner suggest, Tryaruṇa might be a descendant of Trasadasyu and bear his name as an epithet (vs. 3). If so, then the hymn addresses two men, Tryaruṇa (vss. 1–3 in triṣṭubh) and Aśvamedha (vss. 4–6 in anuṣṭubh). In verse 4 Tryaruṇa commands Aśvamedha to reward the poet, but it remains unclear just how the two are related.The translation and interpretation of the hymn become difficult especially at verse 3, which is open to a number of different constructions. We understand 3ab to mean that the sacrificer desires Agni’s favor for the poet’s hymn. Why he should desire this favor navama﻿́m “for the ninth time” is not stated, but there is a parallel in VIII.24.23, which calls on the poet to praise daśama﻿́m “a tenth time.” In both verses the numbers may simply indicate “many times.” Here in this hymn, however, it is likely that navama﻿́m, especially because it follows náviṣṭhāya “for the newest,” either means “anew” rather than “ninth” or puns on the two meanings. The “harnessed chariot,” with which Tryaruṇa welcomes the poet’s song in 3cd, may be a gift to the poet, or it may be the sacrifice itself, which elsewhere is represented as a chariot.Verse 4 begins the second tr̥ca, a transition that is marked also by a change in meter. But in contrast to the clear segmentation of the hymn shown by the tr̥ca form and the meter, the syntax binds verse 4 with verse 3, since the opening relative clause is coordinate with the relative clause in 3cd. This may reproduce the relationship between Tryaruṇa and Aśvamedha, who are two individuals but who are in some manner bound to one another."},{"pageNumber":706,"pageContent":"V.286891.

As that metrical variation suggests, the hymn is not a unified com-position but rather a collection of verses from the Atri tradition, brought together as sāmidhenī verses to accompany the kindling of fire. There are similar com-posite sāmidhenī hymns in the collections of the Viśvāmitras (III.27) and of the Bharadvājas (VI.16). As Proferes (2003: 10) notes, these hymns are three of the four hymns used by both the Śāṅkhāyana and Āśvalāyana traditions for the compilation of the sāmidhenī verses used in the classical Vedic rites.Even though the hymn is a compilation, the tr̥ca form does reflect its structure. The first three verses urge Agni to show himself as he comes into flame.

Kindled, Agni has lifted his flame to heaven. Facing the dawn, he radiates widely.Forward she goes with our homage, bringing all desirable things, summoning the gods with the oblation—she, the ghee-filled (ladle).2. When you are being kindled, you rule over what is immortal.

Interspersed are verses devoted to two much less understood myths, Indra’s conflict with the Sun in an apparent chariot race (vss. 5, 9–10) and his journey with Kutsa to Uśanā’s house and the defeat of Śuṣṇa (vs. 9), myths that often appear together and show narrative connections. There are as well brief mentions of other exploits of Indra, including the Vala myth (vs. 12). The story of the Sun’s chariot and the Kutsa/Uśanā complex are particular preoccupations of the Indra hymns of Maṇḍala V, although the refer-ences to them (Sun’s chariot V.31.11, Kutsa/Uśanā V.31.7–10) do not help to clarify the details as much as we would like.The poet several times (vss. 1, 3, 7) mentions Manu, the first Ārya man and sac-rificer, in connection with the mythic past. This emphasis on Manu, the theoretical ancestor of the current sacrificers, is presumably meant to associate those current"},{"pageNumber":708,"pageContent":"V.29691sacrificers with the participants and supporters of Indra in his previous deeds, in order to gain a portion of reflected glory. As often, the hymn sometimes narrates the myths as if in present time (see esp. vss. 1, 6, 12, all three using the same verb “they chant” [árcanti]). This again is a strategy serving the same purpose, here by specifically identifying the present singers with both the Maruts and the Aṅgirases.The hymn is also structured by recurrent soma-drinking phrases, each slightly different, almost always in the second half of an even pāda (see 2b, 3b, 3d, 5b, 7d, 8b, 11d), a pattern that provides a sort of rhythmic theme-and-variations.It ends with three verses (13–15) in which the poet refers globally to the amaz-ing range of Indra’s deeds past and future, and in the final verse offers him his own well-crafted poems. Only one word in this verse, vasūyúḥ “seeking goods,” out of the whole hymn, hints that the poet would like something in return.1. They uphold the three customs [=rituals of the soma-pressing day] at Manu’s attendance on the gods and the three heavenly realms of light.The Maruts of refined skill chant to you. You are their wise seer, Indra.2. When the Maruts chanted to him after he became exhilarated, to Indra who had drunk of the pressed soma,he took up the mace. When he (had) smashed the serpent, he released the exuberant waters to flow.3. And—you formulators, you Maruts—Indra should drink of this well-pressed soma of mine,for this is his oblation: he found the cows for Manu; Indra smashed the serpent, having drunk of it.4. After that he propped the two world-halves wide apart; even while enwrapped, he set the wild beast to fearing.Repeatedly taunting the gulper, Indra smashed the snorting Dānava back and down.5. Then according to your will, o bounteous one, all the gods conceded the soma-drinking to you,when you put the flying golden mares of the Sun behind, though they were in front, in (the presence of) Etaśa.6. When the bounteous one hews apart his [=Vr̥tra’s] nine and ninety coils at one blow with his mace,the Maruts chant to Indra at the seat (of conflict). With speech in triṣṭubh meter he thrusts heaven (away from earth).7. As a comrade for a comrade, Agni straightaway cooked three hundred buffalo in accord with his [=Indra’s] will.Indra drank the pressed soma of Manu, three lakes worth at one blow, for the Vr̥tra-smashing.8.

The poet begins by wondering where Indra is (vs. 1), locates him on the way to the sacrifice (vs. 2), and promises the god to recite his deeds at the ceremony (vs. 3). This recital occupies the middle of the hymn (vss. 4–10), ending (vs. 11) with a return to the ritual setting, where Indra, pleased by the soma, bestows cows. This mythic model provides a smooth transition to the last four verses (12–15), the poet’s dānastuti, praising his patrons the Ruśamas and their king, R̥ṇaṃcaya (lit., “he who requites his debts”), for their gift to him of four thousand cows, plus a piece of ritual equip-ment, a pot. The poet names himself in verse 14."},{"pageNumber":710,"pageContent":"V.30693The recital of Indra’s deeds touches on the Vala myth (vs. 4), the Vr̥tra myth (vss. 5–6), and the defeat of Namuci (vss. 7–8). The intriguing mention of the Dāsa “who made women his weapons” (vs. 9) is unfortunately more opaque; however, it may be connected with an equally opaque verse, I.104.3. In our view both passages refer to rivers controlled by the Ārya’s consistent, and perhaps indigenous, opponents, thus serving as a barrier to Ārya progress. The words “river” and “stream” (dhénā) are feminine in gender, and so these are the female “weapons” of 9a. Once Indra has recognized that the “weapons” are mere (female) streams, he leads the charge against the Dāsa foe. The cows captured in this raid may be referred to in verse 10, the same cows that Indra distributes in verse 11.1. Where is this hero? Who has seen Indra of the well-naved chariot speeding with his two fallow bays,the mace-bearer, who, seeking one who has pressed the soma, will come to that home, when he is much invoked, with wealth, with help?2. I spotted his track in secret; I followed the powerful track of the one who laid it down, seeking him.I asked the others, and they said to me, “We men might attain Indra, since we have wakened (early).”3.

When you were born far away in the farthest (realm), bearing a name famous afar,from then on even the gods feared Indra. He conquered all the waters, those whose husband [=Vr̥tra] was a Dāsa.6.

The recital itself is fragmentary and mosaic-like, with glittering vignettes from various myths juxtaposed unordered. This fragmented nature is enhanced by abrupt switches between the past and the present/future (see, e.g., vss. 6, 11). The stories of the chariot of the Sun (vs. 11) and of Kutsa and Uśanā (vss. 7–10) encountered in V.29 recur here, vivid but enigmatic.

But this poet avoids using the stan-dard formulae associated with that narrative, instead ringing changes on the nor-mal phraseology (especially the áhann áhim formula: “you/he smashed the serpent,” which does not appear as such in this hymn). Considerable attention is paid to Indra’s opponent, but interestingly the word vr̥trá is never used. Instead he is identi-fied several times as Dānava (descendant of Dānu, who is called Vr̥tra’s mother in I.32.9, or a member of the demonic Dānu tribe) and once called śúṣṇa, usually the name of a different foe of Indra (see, e.g., nearby V.29.9), but here probably used in its etymological sense, “hisser.” But mostly he is nameless, a state emphasized by the emphatic, repeated, verse-initial forms of t(i)yá- cid “that very one” (vss. 3, 4, 5, 6, 8), a sort of empty and open-ended deictic that attracts a series of shifting descrip-tors of horror. The emphasis on darkness (vss. 4, 5, 6), fog (vs. 4), and emptiness (vs. 7) also suggests an indistinct enemy that lacks proper definition.After this depiction of Indra’s great victory over the multifarious monster, it comes as no surprise that in the next verses (9–11) Indra’s power is universally acknowledged by cosmic forces and mortals alike. Verse 9 opens with the ques-tion “who can obstruct him?”—using the verb varāte, belonging to the same root and having the same semantics as the suppressed name Vr̥tra “obstruction.” The question thus carries with it an implied conditional—“who can obstruct him if Obstruction itself cannot?”—with the implicit answer obviously “no one.” The last verse turns, as often, to the benefits Indra can bestow on the poet, ending with a"},{"pageNumber":714,"pageContent":"V.32697perhaps teasing rhetorical question, paraphrasable as: “Do (other) poets complain about your gifts?”1.

The hymn ends with a three-verse dānastuti (8–10), praising the gift of horses from a number of dif-ferent patrons.1. I conjure up a great (praise) for the great, powerful one among superior men, for Indra so very powerful—I who am not so powerful—he who, praised among the people as battle-ready, takes note of the good thought (directed) toward him at the prize-winning.2. You, Indra, being conjured up by our chants, have fixed the yoking thong for the fallow bays, you bull.You will drive here just so, following your pleasure, bounteous one. You will bring (good things); you will be victorious over the peoples of the stranger.3. These (horses) of yours (will) not (remain) unyoked because of us [i.e., because of our failure], lofty Indra, if it’s for lack of a (yoking) formulation.Mount on the chariot with mace in hand.

There is a hostile and dangerous edge to"},{"pageNumber":717,"pageContent":"V.34700much of the rhetoric: the punishments Indra metes out to non-givers are described with gusto.But the most curious feature of the hymn is verse 4, where Indra, depicted as the killer of the father, mother, and brother of an apparently blameless man, not only feels no remorse (“he does not shrink from his offense”), but expects to receive offerings from his victim. The word “offense” used here is a rare and charged one (kílbiṣa): the uncompounded form is found only here in the R̥gveda, and the four other (compounded) occurrences of it are in late hymns in Maṇḍala X. Our passage here seems a foreshadowing of a theme in Indra mythology that becomes highly developed in the middle Vedic period, that of Indra’s offenses or misdeeds, cata-logued as a set of kilbiṣāṇi (see Jamison 1991: 64–68), with Indra as the figure of a warrior run amuck. But the theme seems out of place in the context here, save perhaps for Indra’s excessively aggressive behavior toward the stingy in other verses. (The stingy deserve this treatment, however, in the ritual calculus of the R̥gveda; the man violently deprived of his kin does not.)The hymn ends with what appears to be a truncated dānastuti (vs. 9): the poet praises his apparent patron Āgniveśi Śatri, but no gifts are mentioned.1. Autonomous power, unaging, solar, immeasurable, speeds after him, the wondrous, whose rival has not been born.Press, cook for the one whose vehicle is the sacred formulation; set more (offerings) out for the one praised by many.2.

Whoever presses soma for him in the heat or whoever in the cold, he certainly becomes heaven-bright.The able one, the bounteous one who is partner to the poet (/Kavi [Uśanā]), snatches off the extended (garment), resplendent on his body.4. The man whose father the able one has smashed, whose mother, whose brother—he [=Indra] does not shrink (even) from him.Rather, he actually pursues his offerings; the arranger, the distributor of goods does not shrink from his offense.5. He does not wish to grasp (the offerings) (only) by fives or tens. He does not keep company with a man who doesn’t press (soma), even a prosperous one.He either despoils (him as he goes) along the way, or the tumultuous one smashes (him).

The interior verses (4–6) simply provide conven-tional praise of Indra’s powers.1.

The first four verses deploy a series of similes characterizing Indra, the soma, and the singer(s). Verse 5 plays heav-ily with the word “bull” (vŕ̥ṣan) for Indra and his accoutrements, a device that returns more insistently in the first four verses of V.40. The final verse (6) is a short dānastuti to the patron Śrutaratha (“[Having a] Famous Chariot”), whose name may have inspired the wheel and chariot imagery of verse 3: the phrase “from the chariot” in that verse is somewhat puzzling on the surface, but if it slyly expresses the hope that the singer will become one “possessing many goods from (Famous) Chariot,” it may be a prefiguring of the dānastuti.1. He will come here—Indra, who will be attentive to the giving of the gift of goods and riches.Like a buffalo roaming the wasteplaces, thirsting, let him desirously drink the milked plant.2.

The middle verse (3) is a sort of riddle and serves, therefore, as a mild omphalos: the bride in question may be Speech, as the beloved of Indra (as some have suggested), or perhaps Dawn. The husband may be Indra, or the Sun. (We favor the Dawn/Sun interpretation, which is in keeping with the dawn-ritual context.)There are two pieces of onomastic verbal play that look outside the hymn proper. In verse 3c the phrase “his chariot will seek fame” (śravasyād ráthaḥ) recalls the name of the patron Śruta-ratha, whose praise ended the previous hymn (V.36.6). And the phrase “with the radiance of the sun” (bhānúnā . . . sū́ryasya) in the first pāda of the hymn (1a), describing Agni, is actually the solution to the story of Svar-bhānu (“[Having] the Sun’s Radiance”) told in V.40.5–9. It is especially appro-priate to find this answer given at the beginning of this hymn here, as it is the first in a series of hymns attributed to Atri, among which is V.40.1. He [=Agni] aligns himself with the radiance of the sun, being bepoured, with ghee on his back, of lovely outlook.The non-neglectful dawns will shine forth to him [=sacrificer] who says “Let us press (soma) for Indra.”2. With his fire kindled and his ritual grass spread, he will win; with his pressing stones yoked and his soma pressed, he will sing;whose pressing stones speak vigorously, he will go, as Adhvaryu, down to the river with an oblation.3.

This judgment does not seem entirely fair, but the hymn is characterized by a certain lack of syntactic coherence, as well as an overabundance of elaborate vocatives addressed to Indra. It is not clear who the second god is in verse 3, though he is possibly Varuṇa; otherwise the hymn only makes reference to Indra.The hymn is in some ways a twin to the following one, sharing vocabulary and thematics, but the second hymn provides only limited help in interpreting this one.1. Extensive is the giving of your broad largesse, o Indra of a hundred resolves.So make ready to give to us brilliant things, you of good lordship who govern all domains.2.

The first three verses urge Indra to give in abundance, while in the last two (4–5) the poet urges his fellow Atris to praise the god.1.

It opens with four verses praising Indra in his bull-ish aspect, with hypnotic repetition of the word vŕ̥ṣan “bull.” The remainder (vss. 5–9) contains an allusive account of the myth of Svarbhānu, who “pierces the Sun with darkness,” and the Sun’s rescue by the seer Atri, a myth much treated in middle Vedic literature. For extensive discussion of the myth and this R̥gvedic version of it, see Jamison (1991: Part II, pp. 131–303)."},{"pageNumber":723,"pageContent":"V.40706The myth makes sense once the identity of the mysterious enemy of the Sun is solved: Svarbhānu, literally “he who possesses the radiance of the sun,” is actu-ally the Sun’s earthly counterpart, the god Agni. He punished the Sun for the lat-ter’s incestuous intercourse with his daughter (not mentioned in this hymn, but frequently found elsewhere), but because of the importance of sunlight for the maintenance of the world, the Sun had to be restored by the seer Atri (also the supposed poet of this hymn) through ritual means. The physical manifestations of the Sun’s punishment betray his attacker’s identity: “pierced with darkness” refers to sunspots, dark spots on the sun as if burnt by fire, and the enveloping darkness of smoke is depicted in verse 6.Note that the Svarbhānu portion (5–9) is a perfect omphalos hymn. The two outer verses (5, 9) are multiforms of each other and in a different meter from the verses in between; the middle verse (7) is the only direct speech; the intermediate vss. (6, 8) both mention Atri in the singular, both deal with the māyā́ (“magic spells”) of Svarbhānu, and both have complementary vocabulary: diváḥ/diví, sū́ryam/sū́ryasya, gūḷha﻿́m/aghukṣat, bráhmaṇā/brahmā́.1.

Although the placement of this series within the Saṃhitā was dictated by the strict and mechani-cal rules of numerical arrangement discussed before (see Intro. pp. 10–11), it is sometimes difficult for us not to view this set of hymns as a type of omphalos in the larger structure of the R̥gveda. They are found in more or less the middle of Maṇḍala V (which has 87 hymns), which is more or less the middle maṇḍala of the Family Books (II–VII—keeping in mind that, though V is preceded by three maṇḍalas and followed by two, the preceding maṇḍalas are shorter: II–IV contain 163 hymns, VI–VII 179, remarkably close to equivalence). Just as the omphalos verse in a hymn contains the enigma, the mysterious message of the hymn, so we could view these All God hymns as the mystical center of the older R̥gveda.V.41 (395) All GodsAtri Bhauma20 verses: triṣṭubh, except atijagatī 16–17, ekapadā virāj 20This hymn is quite intricate on the verbal level, though in paraphrase and in translation it may seem to lack interest. Every verse (but 17) names at least one divinity—many verses have several—chosen from among both the most promi-nent gods of the Vedic pantheon (e.g., Mitra and Varuṇa in vs. 1) and distinctly marginal figures like Āptya (vs. 9). There does not seem to be any one dominant god or set of gods: though the Maruts are mentioned more than any other gods (vss. 2, 5, 11, 13, 16), there is little particularly Marutian vocabulary or imagery. (It might be remembered, however, that the longest series of Marut hymns in the R̥gveda, the Śyāvāśva hymns of remarkable poetic quality, immediately follow the All God hymns in this maṇḍala [V.52–61]). The content of the hymn as a whole seldom deviates from invitations to the sacrifice with promises of offerings, and prayers for divine gifts in return. Verses 16–17 are in a different meter and seem to be bringing the hymn to a close, especially 17, in which, as often, the poet makes a meta-reference to the hymn just concluded. If this is so, verses 18–20 are an afterthought.The seemingly unordered series of gods who receive the honor of a verse (or part thereof) may exemplify a covert theme of choice or alternatives, underlined by the"},{"pageNumber":725,"pageContent":"V.41708use of the simple conjunction “or” (vā) as the verbal “hero” of the beginning of the hymn (vss. 1–3, returning at the end, vss. 15, 19).Unfortunately other pieces of verbal play are essentially untranslatable, like the unusual sequence of two monosyllables at the end of the first half-verse of verse 1: . . . vā dé (“or . . . to be given”), which, scrambled, produces the target of the hymn: devā(ḥ) “gods.”1.

Or such is the structure of the opening (vss. 1–6) and concluding (vss. 11–18) sec-tions of the hymn. In the middle (vss. 7–10) Br̥haspati (in vs. 10 with the Maruts) is called upon to be generous to generous patrons but to unleash destructive power against stingy patrons and non-sacrificers. As Hanns-Peter Schmidt has noted, these hostile actions are uncharacteristic of Br̥haspati but typical of Indra, just as the association of Indra with the sacred formulation in verse 4 would be more expected of Br̥haspati than Indra. He therefore argues (1968: 84–86) that verses 4–10 form a unity in this hymn, with Br̥haspati serving as an epithet of Indra.Although the gods in the enumerative verses are often named, some verses are riddles, describing the god without naming him (1cd, 6, 13, 14) or naming him only in the second half of the verse (3, 11). Such puzzles are common in All God hymns.At the end of the hymn (vss. 14–17) the poet expresses the hope that his praise should reach in all directions, to all three worlds, creating wide space for him and his companions (in the final single-pāda verse 17). (Verse 18 is adopted from Aśvin hymns later in the maṇḍala [V.76.5, 77.5], perhaps to introduce the Aśvins, who are otherwise unmentioned, into this All God hymn.)1.

There is perhaps more detail about ritual performance than in many such hymns (see, e.g., vss. 1, 3–7), and this focus on the ritual is observable in two other features of the hymn. On the one hand, the god Agni dominates the last part of the hymn (vss. 12–15), under the name/epithet Br̥haspati in verse 12, unnamed but clearly identified by his characteristics in verse 13, called Āyu in verse 14, and finally named in verse 15ab. Such concentration on deified ritual fire in an All God hymn is somewhat surprising. Further, the middle verse of this hymn (excluding the repeated verses at the end), verse 7, is directed not toward a god but a ritual implement, the gharma pot, used in the Pravargya ritual and often the focus of priestly speculation.1. Let the milk-cows, swift to their tasks, not neglectful, come close to us here with their milk, their honey.For great wealth, the inspired poet, the singer keeps invoking the seven lofty (cows [=rivers?]), who are joy itself.2.

Although in our opinion there are numerous contenders for “hardest hymn” in the R̥gveda (X.106, for example, some of which appears to be written in unbreakable code), this one is certainly near the top of any such list.The difficulties are found in every aspect of the hymn, beginning with the fact that the divine subject(s) of the various verses of the heart of the hymn are never identified. Then there are lexical problems: a number of rare words or hapaxes; morphological problems, including unusual inflectional and derivational morphol-ogy; syntactic problems such as frequent lack of verbs, unclear referents, unclear syntactic roles, and so on—not to mention a general lack of superficial coherence, both between verses and within verses. For all these reasons, the translation given is provisional in general and in many details.Nonetheless, it is possible to form a hypothesis about what the hymn is “about,” and this hypothesis allows one to interpret many of the ambiguities within this framework. Our translation reflects this hypothesis, and in a number of places bracketed identifications have been inserted to guide readers—though we have tried to keep these to a minimum, to avoid too much clutter in the poetry itself, which"},{"pageNumber":732,"pageContent":"V.44715despite its frequent lack of clarity possesses, in our opinion, both power and beauty, and to allow readers to produce their own interpretations of the hymn.To be brief, the hypothesis with which we operate is that each verse is applicable to both Agni and Soma, the two crucial deified ritual substances, and therefore many of the verbal contortions are the result of attempting to produce phraseology that is meaningful for each god simultaneously. (This hypothesis is adumbrated by Geldner in his introduction to the hymn, where he suggests that some verses can be read with intentional double reference to Agni and Soma, though he clearly does not consider the whole hymn in this light.) The final two verses (14–15), in a differ-ent meter and almost mechanically responsive to each other, mention both Soma and Agni, and may be intended as an implicit answer to the riddle posed by the rest of the hymn. In any case, if our hypothesis is correct, the poem is the forerun-ner of the much later kāvya tours de force in which, for example, the plots of the Mahābhārata and the Rāmāyaṇa are narrated at the same time.The Soma/Agni simultaneity is especially prominent in the first part of the hymn. Toward the middle of the hymn (starting around vs. 8) another theme emerges, that of the poet learning his craft, seeking true speech. What unites the two themes is the sense that poetic inspiration comes from the ritual itself and from the mysteries of the identification of the two most important ritual substances, so that the poet gains his verbal mastery as the sacrifice progresses. But it is also the case that the sacrifice needs his poetry in order to be properly carried through, and so the poetic skill the poet gains from his contemplation of the mysteries of the sacrifice is put to use immediately in the next verses (9–11), and the result always desired by R̥gvedic sacrificers, the epiphany of Indra on the sacrificial ground, is achieved in verse 12. Because of his contribution to the success of the sacrifice, the poet is lauded in the last verse (13) before the responsive solution to the riddle as the foundation of the whole sacrifice. Thus, the hymn is both a static meditation on a central sacrificial mystery and a roughly chronological progression through the sacrifice.One of the enigmatic features of the hymn found throughout the hymn is the regular presence of unidentified feminine plurals (vss. 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11), espe-cially intriguing in verse 7. Identifying the likely referent(s) for these feminines as the hymn unfolds shows the developing complexity of the hymnic universe of dis-course. In the earlier part of the hymn the feminines most probably refer, in the realm of Agni, to the streams of ghee offered into Agni (and also perhaps to the plants he burns)—while, in the realm of Soma, to the waters that swell the soma stalks and to the cows’ milk mixed with the pressed soma. As the figure of the poet joins the hymn, the feminines can have a third set of referents, the insights that provide him with poetic inspiration and the words/songs that result from them. (All of the underlying nouns in all three referential systems are feminine in gender and con-ceptually female.) This complex web of reference is beautifully (or dauntingly) on display in verse 11. In our reading of this verse all three sets of feminines are not bound, that is, not in use, when the soma is being brought to the ritual and the sacri-fice has not yet started. But when soma the plant is made into soma the exhilarating"},{"pageNumber":733,"pageContent":"V.44716drink, all three sets of feminines are hitched up: the poet’s words are recited, the streams of milk approach the pressed soma, and the streams of ghee are poured into the fire. The priests direct the various females to their appropriate goals, and at the end of the ritual they are “unhitched.”As an aside, we might mention what appears to be a sly joke, located in almost the middle of the hymn (minus the final riddle-solving verses): in 6a, after five verses of exhausting enigmas with many more to come, the poet says, “Just as he appears, so is he said (to be)”—an assertion about the transparent clarity of the subject that the frustrated audience may view with bitter irony. However, it is of course not merely a joke, for the poet’s task is to find the hidden mystical truths of the universe and express them in true words, in bráhman. No matter how superficially baffling, the bráhman captures how “it really is,” and so the poet asserts here.Although numerous puzzles remain in the hymn, we hope to have shown that it is far from “hopeless.” It can be read as a consistent unity (though the unity we see may not be the only possible one), and, as so often with complex hymns in the R̥gveda, it is a meditation not only on the ritual but also on poetic craft.1.

The hymn begins (vss. 1–3) with a description of sunrise, with no overt mention of the myth, though it clearly lurks in the background. The poet is concerned to apply the mythic model to the current sacrificial situation. He initiates the ritual in verse 4, and then in the two, paired, middle verses in the hymn (5–6), an omphalos, he exhorts his priestly comrades to achieve the poetic vision (dhī́ ) that has served others well in the past. The particular past he has in mind becomes clear in the following two verses (7–8), which depict the opening of the Vala cave and the Aṅgirases’ role in it. The next two verses first pray that the Sun will come up (9) and then announce that he has arisen (10). The exhortations in verses 5–6 have worked! In the last verse (11) the poet (addressing himself, as well as his priestly colleagues) exults over this success: “the poetic vision that wins the sun,” the same one that the Aṅgirases possessed, has now been acquired, and it will bring welfare to the community. It is noteworthy that Indra, the usual hero of the Vala myth, is not mentioned in connection with it (though he does make an appearance in vs. 4); presumably the poet wishes to identify himself and his priestly comrades with the chorus of Indra’s associates, the Aṅgirases, rather than with the god.A brief grammatical digression is necessary here in order to show the particular artfulness of this hymn. As noted, the first three verses already describe, in some detail, the dawn and the sunrise, and so it might be thought that the sunrise in verse 10 is an anticlimax. But a remarkable fact about the first three verses is that the description of the sunrise there is couched almost entirely in the verb form known as the injunctive, which has no overt marker of tense. Although its default interpretation is past tense, it can be used also to depict “timeless” events. (Since English lacks such a verbal category, we have used the present tense here.) The sun-rise in verses 1–3 is both the mythic model of the Vala-Aṅgiras narrative and, more important, the ideal sunrise to which the poet aspires. In contrast to the insistent"},{"pageNumber":736,"pageContent":"V.45719injunctives in these verses, when today’s sunrise, the successful result of the sacri-ficers’ and poet’s efforts, is depicted in verse 10, all four verb forms have the overt marker of past tense, the so-called augment, making it clear that the sunrise there has indeed (just) occurred. Another example of R̥gvedic poets’ sensitivity to gram-matical categories and their ingenious deployment of them.1.

However, there are two features of note in the hymn, and these features have, in our view, a covert connection. The hymn ends with two verses praising the Wives of the Gods in general and particular gods’ wives by title: Indrāṇī, Agnāyī (wife of Agni), Aśvinī, Varuṇānī (vs. 8); the Wives (of the Gods) are also mentioned in verse 2, and other goddesses are also featured in the hymn: Sarasvatī (vs. 2), Aditi (vss. 3, 6), the Waters (vs. 3), the Rivers (vs. 6). The second feature is that the first verse is very different from the rest—the invocation of divinities only begins in verse 2. In verse 1 the 1st-person poet-sacrificer describes himself as hitched to a chariot-pole and, despite the effort involved, does not wish to be released from this yoking.Now it is certainly possible that the yoking image only refers to the poet-sacrificer’s usual tasks at the sacrifice. However, in conjunction with the emphasis on the gods’ wives (pátnīḥ) later in the hymn, we suggest that what this hymn is ever so delicately concerning itself with is an important and controversial innovation: the introduc-tion of the Sacrificer’s Wife (pátnī) as a necessary participant in the ritual. As has been argued elsewhere (Jamison 2011, forthcoming a and b), though the Sacrificer’s Wife is a fixture already in early middle Vedic ritual (see Jamison 1996a), there is no evidence for her participation in early R̥gvedic ritual. The introduction of the Sacrificer’s Wife in the middle to late R̥gveda (presumably beginning with only one or a few priestly circles) seems to have been, understandably, controversial, and though it is not referred to directly in the text, there are covert arguments, pro and con, in a number of hymns. One of the important images of the new ritual pairing of Sacrificer and Wife is that of a pair of draft-animals jointly yoked to a chariot-pole (e.g., VIII.33.18, X.102.10), pulling the sacrifice together, though with the husband maintaining a slight edge in strength and effort. It seems quite possible that this image is found in verse 1: the male yoked to the pole, pulling a feminine"},{"pageNumber":738,"pageContent":"V.46721referent (the chariot-pole, which is grammatically feminine, but also secondarily the wife), and with no desire to return to the old state of affairs. The last word in this verse, neṣati “he will lead,” reminds of the priestly title, Neṣṭar “Leader,” the priest whose duty it is to lead the Sacrificer’s Wife around the sacrificial ground in later śrauta ritual; he is already marginally represented in the R̥gveda as a leader of the Wives of the Gods (see especially I.15.3).If this scenario is correct—that verse 1 represents an argument in favor of the new model of sacrifice including the Sacrificer’s Wife—then the lists of gods that follow might be a form of insurance. Every possible divinity is called upon to wit-ness and give tacit approval to the innovation. And the Wives of the Gods, who provide the divine model for the Sacrificer’s Wife, are called on especially insistently to come to the sacrifice and provide their help and support.1.

This is not an uncommon tactic in All God hymns—a particularly deft example is VIII.29. This hymn presents several twists on this device. First, the characterizations seem regu-larly intended to mislead. For example, verse 1 has a feminine subject, and given the actions ascribed to her, the audience would expect the subject to be Dawn. But instead it is (Poetic) Inspiration (manīṣā́), here identified as the mother of Dawn (presumably because early-morning ritual poetry awakens Dawn and impels her to appear). Again, the attributes of the subject in verse 2 suggest Agni’s flames, but the actual referent, the last word of the verse, is “Paths.” Second, the riddles get harder as the hymn pro-gresses. As was already noted, in verses 1 and 2 the solution is given, but thereafter it is not. In verse 3 the solution is fairly obvious by the end of the verse, but in verse 4 it is less so. Verse 5 announces itself as an enigma, and it seems to have double application to both the Sun and Agni. There is no agreed upon solution for verse 6.Although this observation is unconnected to the riddle structure just discussed, each verse (but 5) has a form of div/dyu “heaven” (mostly diváḥ) (vs. 5 has d (u) v é “two,” which is phonologically close). The final pāda of the hymn is an “homage to Heaven.” Although this homage was not prepared thematically in the hymn, it was prepared verbally, by the repetition of the stem in various syntactic and semantic contexts.1. Hitching up, she comes from heaven, she who is called the great mother of the Daughter (of Heaven [=Dawn]), waking (men),seeking to win, the youthful one, (coming) from the fathers, constantly calling in the seat (of the sacrifice)—(she is) Inspiration.2.

There is cer-tainly no consensus among scholars about these referents or about the purpose and structure of the hymn; indeed, a number of scholars consider this a “fragment.” We find this unlikely, however. The fact that the most difficult verse by far is the middle one (3) suggests that this is an omphalos hymn, and moreover the final pāda (of vs. 5) is typical of a hymn ending.In our opinion the hymn is appropriate to an early-morning ritual, and the two main referents are Dawn (/Dawns) and Agni. It begins with a typical rhetorical ques-tion: what poem to compose for the establishment of the ritual fire at dawn? The second half of verse 1 and first half of verse 2 present striking images of dawn (/dawns) breaking, ending verse 2 with a standard meditation on the aging that every new day brings to mortals. This thought is continued in verse 3, though the focus passes to Agni, who day after day at the ritual prepares the mace for Indra when Indra is present at the sacrifice, while the recurrent dawns mark the passage of time. Agni as the ritual fire remains the subject of the remainder of the hymn (vss. 4–5), with his identity becoming clearer and clearer.1.

These two gods are the topic of verses 1 and 2 here, and the first four (of five) verses concern the dis-tribution of treasures to men, with a widening circle of gods responsible for these gifts. The context (as vs. 3 makes especially clear) is the distribution of dakṣiṇās (priestly gifts) at the early-morning ritual. Verse 5 asks for more general blessings than just wealth, but in its references to the “formless void” and to “wide space,” it also seems to depict dawn, which creates visible and articulated space from formlessness.1. I hasten toward god Savitar for you today, and toward Bhaga who apportions the treasure of Āyu.I would also turn hither you two superior men, who bring many enjoyments—seeking companionship with you, o Aśvins, day after day.2.

With the aid of Heaven and Earth may we rejoice.V.50 (404) All GodsSvastyātreya Ātreya5 verses: anuṣṭubh, except paṅkti 5This little hymn is surprisingly beset by difficulties, especially of syntax, reference, and meter. A particularly intricate set of syntactic constructions modulates from the singular “everyman” of verse 1, through an indefinite plural 3rd person, also representing men in general (“they” 2ab), to an identification of those indefinite men with “us” (2cd)—all of whom desire wealth and the companionship of the god “Leader,” identified by the later tradition with Savitar (whom we met in V.49), though this identification is not necessary.The scene shifts to the sacrifice in the next two verses (3–4), and the “we” of verse 2 becomes the “you” in verse 3, exhorted to do honor to the gods and their wives as guests at the sacrifice. The identities remain off-balance, however: the verb used for “honor” is one whose subject is usually a god and whose object a mortal, so role reversal is implied. And the gods are not identified as “gods,” but rather called “men”—using the word nŕ̥, which refers to especially elite, noble, or worthy men, and is often elsewhere applied to gods. Verse 4 depicts the mythic model of the soma sacri-fice, with Indra invigorated by soma to be a winner. This leads us back to god Leader and prayers for wealth and well-being in response to our ritual offerings (vs. 5).1. Every mortal would choose the companionship of the god Leader.Every one aims at wealth and would choose brilliance, in order to thrive.2. They are yours, god Leader, as are the ones who (set out) to mimic them.As those—for they are to be infused (with good things)—may we be accompanied by wealth, by (other) desirable accompaniments.3.

It is also not unified metrically. It likely originally consisted of separate hymns, verses 1–4, 5–7, 8–10, with 11–15 as a later addition.Both in content and form, all the segments are simple, predictable, and closely tied to the soma-drinking of various gods, especially those appropriate to the morn-ing soma-pressing.

The ten sequential hymns, 52–61, attributed to Śyāvāśva Ātreya, are poetry of the highest order—inventive, exuberant, and beautifully crafted—and they capture both aspects of the Maruts: their social existence as a sort of Männerbund, a group of young, handsome, high-spirited war-riors, and their naturalistic existence as personifications of the monsoon/thun-derstorm—without losing sight of their divinity and the benefits they provide to men.V.52 (406) MarutsŚyāvāśva Ātreya17 verses: anuṣṭubh, except paṅkti 6, 16–17As befits the first hymn in this Marut cycle, the poet Śyāvāśva addresses himself with an exhortation to praise the Maruts in the first pāda of the first verse. He then"},{"pageNumber":745,"pageContent":"V.52728describes them in a general fashion and asserts their right to the sacrifice, in a short ring-compositional introduction (vss. 1–5). (For the responsions of verses 1 and 5 as an example of “poetic repair,” see Jamison 2006.)The next section of the hymn (vss. 6–13) depicts the Maruts as the gods of the thunderstorm in a series of vivid images and also fancifully assigns individual names to them (vss. 10–11)—the Maruts are otherwise undifferentiated—ending with another exhortation to the poet to praise them (vs. 13cd). In the last few verses (14–17) ritual honor is given to the Maruts, and they respond with gifts. The last verse (17) resembles a dānastuti, but with the Maruts, rather than humans, as the donors to the poet; they were already identified as “patrons” (sūrí) in the two pre-ceding verses (15–16).The density of imagery throughout is remarkable; we will give just one example, from verse 9. There the Maruts are said to “clothe themselves in wool in the Paruṣṇī River.” The “wool” must stand for foam, off-white and fluffy like newly shorn wool. But the river foam is yet another metaphorical substitute for something else, namely clouds, which the Maruts as storm gods would be clothed in—all of this conveyed in an economical half-verse.1. Śyāvāśva, chant forth boldly—along with the Maruts possessing chants,who rejoice in [/cheer on] undisguised fame according to their own nature, those worthy of the sacrifice.2. For they are comrades of steadfast strength—boldly.Bold on their drive, by themselves they protect each and every one.3.

The internal groupings, mostly two-verse units, follow those suggested by Oldenberg (1888: 106–8).

The Maruts themselves answer, indirectly, in verse 3, and demand praise, which is forthcoming in verse 4. The description of a storm follows (vss. 5–7), and the Maruts are urged to come here with their rains (vss. 8–11). The poet returns in verses 12–13 to the question raised at the begin-ning: to what sacrificer have the Maruts gone? The hope is of course that they have come or will come to us, and the blessings we wish to receive are detailed in the final verses (14–16.)1. Who knows their birth? Or, who was previously in the graces of the Maruts,when they yoked their own spotted (female antelopes)?2. Those mounted on their chariots—who heard (them)?

Rather than focusing on the thunderstorm and its accompanying rain (mentioned only inciden-tally in vs. 5), as in the last few Marut hymns, this one primarily concerns their journey through the midspace. The hymn ends with a few verses (9–10) of invitation to the sacrifice and prayers for benefits.1.

The first word in the hymn is a vocative addressed to the god Agni, and he (or perhaps the poet) is addressed elsewhere in the hymn (vss. 2, 5). The Earth appears in verse 3 as a literally battered woman, a remarkable image, and this female figure anticipates that of Rodasī, frequent com-panion and consort of the Maruts, in verses 8–9.The poet repeatedly calls the Maruts to come here: the forms “I call,” “we call,” and “calls” frame and punctuate the hymn (vss. 1, 2, 5, 8, 9), while the invocation of Agni at the beginning and the description of Agni in verse 7 establish the sacrifice as the goal of their journey. But it is the verses describing the journey itself (especially 3–4) that are the most memorable part of this hymn."},{"pageNumber":752,"pageContent":"V.577351.

The hymn begins by"},{"pageNumber":753,"pageContent":"V.57736addressing the Maruts by their father’s name, “o Rudras,” a vocative that returns in verse 7. Their mother Pr̥śni also figures in the hymn, in verses 2 and 3. The first verse also describes them as “accompanied by Indra” (índravantaḥ). It is notable how rarely Indra is mentioned in hymns dedicated to the Maruts, even though they are his sidekicks and supporters from an Indraic point of view. In the whole Marut cycle in Maṇḍala V this is the only appearance of Indra, and it is tellingly phrased: Indra is himself treated as a sidekick, demoted into a possessive adjec-tive: “possessing/accompanied by Indra.” It is ordinarily the Maruts who have this grammatically subordinated role: the adjective marútvant (“possessing/accompa-nied by the Maruts”) is very common and regularly modifies Indra.In this hymn, then, the Maruts are defined first by their parentage and their companion. The other elements that define them are their attributes, both physi-cal and mental, lists of which are given in verses 2, 4, 5, and 6, constituting a virtual iconography of the Maruts in verbal form. This listing modulates imper-ceptibly into the beginning of verse 7, a list of goods possessed by the Maruts that they have give to the singers, a subtle way of moving to the requests of the final verses (7–8).The vivid description characteristic of Marut hymns is not absent here. See espe-cially verses 2–3, with the Maruts as the storm.1. O Rudras—accompanied by Indra, of one accord, with your golden chariots, come here for good faring.Here is a poetic thought from us for you to yearn toward, like the wellspring of heaven for a thirsty man seeking water.2. You with your axes, your spears, your inspired thoughts, with your good bows, your arrows, your quivers,you possess good horses, good chariots, you whose mother is Pr̥śni. Possessing good weapons, you drive in beauty, Maruts.3. You shake heaven and the mountains for goods for the pious. The trees duck down with fear at your journey.You make the earth quake, you whose mother is Pr̥śni, when, o powerful ones, you have yoked the dappled (mares) for beauty.4. The Maruts—having the wind’s turbulence and a cloak of rain, quite alike in appearance like twins, well-ornamented,having tawny horses and ruddy horses, unblemished, projecting power, wide like heaven in their greatness.5. Possessed of many droplets [/banners], of unguents, of good drops, whose appearance is turbulent, whose gifts are not withdrawn,noble by birth, with brilliants on their breasts, chant(er)s of heaven, they share an immortal name.6.

In this latter capacity, the Maruts are seen as the source of various earthly counterparts (vs. 4). Another common theme, the lack of distinction among the various members of the band, is also mentioned (vs. 5). As in V.56.3 a sexual relationship between the Maruts and the Earth is depicted (vs. 7), though without the shock value of the earlier passage.1. Now will I praise this (flock) full of power, their Marutian flock of newer (hymns [=thunderclaps]),those possessing swift horses who drive themselves impetuously and who as self-rulers are masters of the immortal—2.

The hymn’s subject, as usual, is the power of the Maruts on their travels, power manifested both as the storm and as a warriors’ onslaught. The puzzles in this hymn begin with its opening: no entirely satisfactory referent for the “scout” or “spy” of 1a has been found, though many have been suggested.1. Your scout has stridden forth, to give good faring. I will chant to heaven. I proffer my truth [=hymn] to the earth.They sprinkle the horses, passing through the dusky realm. They let their own radiance slacken with floods (of rain).2. In fear of their onslaught the Earth trembles. Like a loaded boat she streams, going a wayward course.They who, visible from afar, are conspicuous on their travels, the men have taken their places amid the great rite of distribution.3. (Your) horn, like (those) of cows, stands tallest for splendor; (your) eye is like the sun in his surging through the dusky realm.Like steeds of good quality, you are pleasing. Like young bloods, you are conspicuous for splendor, o men.4. Who can reach up to the great things of you great ones? Who to your poetic skills, Maruts, who to your manly deeds?You set the earth to quivering like a dustmote, when you press forward, to give good faring.5.

The prominence of Agni identifies the Maruts’ journey to and participation in the sacrifice as the goal of the hymn. Their journey itself provokes the usual cosmic reactions—fear and trembling (vss. 2–3)—and the dazzling beauty of the Maruts also receives its usual expression (vs. 4). Verse 5 provides an almost domes-tic picture of their parentage. Notable also is the dicing imagery in verse 1.1. I solemnly invoke helpful Agni with reverences. Seated in front, he will pull out a perfect (“hand” of dice) for us.I press forward as if with chariots seeking prizes. With respectful circumambulation (of Agni) might I bring to fulfillment the praise of the Maruts.2.

It also falls into several sections on thematic grounds (vss. 1–4, 5–10, 11–16, 17–19). However, at least the first half (1–10) displays the cleverness and sly humor of Śyāvāśva, who names himself directly in verse 5 and punningly in verse 9, and perhaps represents a jeu d’esprit of the poet, appended to the more solemn Marut hymns that precede it. Note that Śyāvāśva names himself only in the first of those hymns (V.52.1) and in this last one.The Maruts are the clear subject of verses 1–4 and 11–16, and each of these sec-tions is followed by a dānastuti, or verses culminating in a dānastuti: 10 and 17–19. We therefore suggest that we are dealing here with two originally separate hymns, 1–10 and 11–19, and that the first at least bears clear marks of Śyāvāśva’s authorship.Since the second of these is less interesting than the first, we will discuss it first here. The six verses (11–16) treating the Maruts are fairly conventional. Verse 17 serves as a transition to the dānastuti, addressed, oddly, to the goddess Night, who is urged to carry the poet’s hymns to his patron, called Dārbhya here, and Rathavīti in the following two verses. Both parts of the latter name are punned upon: ratha “chariot” in verse 17 (“like a charioteer”), -vīti “pursuit” in verse 18 in the verb form (ápa) veti “go off track,” and he is praised for his generosity in general terms (19).The first hymn is a much less staid affair. The four opening verses to the Maruts begin with questions about the Maruts and then in increasing detail about their"},{"pageNumber":758,"pageContent":"V.61741horses and horse-tackle. And in verses 2c and 3b the Maruts are depicted as riding horseback (one of the very few pieces of evidence for this activity in the R̥gveda); in verse 2 the reference is unremarkable, but in verse 3 the men’s posture on the horse reminds the poet of women spreading their thighs in sex (or possibly childbirth, though this seems less likely). From this point on the hymn takes a sexually sug-gestive turn. In verse 4 the Maruts are sent off with “lucky women,” and we move abruptly into the second section of the hymn.That section ends with a real dānastuti verse (10) in praise of a patron named Vaidadaśvi. We might expect the four preceding verses (5–9) to form part of the dānastuti as well, and there are prominent dānastuti-like elements in them, but they also subvert the dānastuti model or provide a counter model—not least because they concern a woman and profess the unorthodox opinion that women can be superior to men. Verse 5 introduces an unidentified woman who “gains” the sorts of things poets usually receive in dānastutis, using the root for “gain” (san) that is standard in such contexts. (The notion that a woman would be in such a position is so unusual that most translators simply translate the word as if it means “give”—though a woman who gives livestock is no more standard a figure than one who gains it.) From the second half of the verse it is clear that she must be the favored consort (perhaps even the “Favorite Wife” of later Vedic ritual) of Śyāvāśva’s patron. The poet then seems to reflect (vss. 6–8) on the qualities of women in general, in contrast to men, allowing that some women may actually be better than men, especially men of bad character—and among those especially a stingy man (vss. 6, 8), who doesn’t deserve to be called a man except in the technical matter of blood money (vs. 8). The tone in these verses is colloquial and conversational. After this seeming digression, with the subtle hint to his patron about the perils of stinginess, we return in verse 9 to a flesh-and-blood woman, who is working her wiles on the poet, who calls himself “Dusky” (śyāva). The verse is an elaborate pun: on the one hand she is narrating the course of a race, and the “two chestnuts” in the second half of the verse can be two horses given to the poet, “straining forward” to win. But the tone is very intimate; the “course” may be the progress of sexual intercourse between the girl and the poet, and the second half of the verse, using the same verb (ví √yam “spread apart”) as in the first sexually suggestive passage in verse 4, can describe the “spreading apart” of two female body parts. The girl in verse 9 thus appears to be part of the “gift” that Śyāvāśva received for his poem, and the complex set of double meanings in this verse are certainly a worthy “praise of this gift.” Is the girl in this verse the same as the one in verse 5? Śyāvāśva seems to imply this, but we will never know for sure.1. Who are you, men, the fairest ones, who one by one have driven herefrom the farthest distance?2.

Their ability to send the rain is connected with their kingship, and the poet suggests that con-nection in several images. The gods’ throne sits “within the libations” (vss. 5, 6), which not only are the oblations made to them but also signify the rainwater. The banner that increases through their commandment (vs. 5) is the banner “of the ruler” (cf. V.69.1), and here the rain is the emblem of their kingship. Their rule is strong, supported by a thousand pillars (vs. 6), but the pillar of their throne is also the lightning (vs. 7ab) that accompanies the rain, and its foundation is in land that yields plants (vs. 7c).Framing the rain, which is the subject of verses 2–7, is the sun (vss. 1, 8). The first verse remains mysterious. The first hemistich places Mitra and Varuṇa’s “enduring truth” in the night sky or in any case, in that place where “they,” most likely the gods generally, unhitch Sūrya’s horses to let them pasture during the night. Yet even before dawn the poet’s vision allows him to see “that One,” the sun, and together with the sun, the hidden truth of the two gods. The sun may also be the “single felly” mentioned in 2d, and if so, the verse looks forward the appearance of the sun after the rain. After the invocations to the gods for rain, the sun returns to the poem once again, this time visible to all at dawn and closely associated with the golden throne of Mitra and Varuṇa.1. Your enduring truth is hidden by truth, there where they unhitch the horses of the sun.Ten times a hundred [=rays of the sun?] stand together: I saw that One, the most splendid of the lovely forms of the gods.2. That is surely your greatness, Mitra and Varuṇa: while standing at rest, they have given milk throughout the days.You two swell all the pasture’s streams of milk. The single felly has turned here after you two.3. You upheld the earth and heaven, o you two kings, Mitra and Varuṇa, by your great powers.Make the plants grow! Swell the cows!

It gives a vivid picture of the monsoons with their thunder and lightning (vss. 5, 6) and the coming of the rain (esp. vss. 1, 4). The poet uses sound repetition, perhaps in imitation of echoing thunder or recurring lightning or perhaps simply as a demonstration of his poetic ability: 2d . . . -vī ví caranti . . . , 3b . . . vícarṣanī, 3c citrébhir . . . , 4b carati citra﻿́m . . . , 5c . . . citrā́ ví caranti . . . , 6b . . . citrā́m vadati tvíṣī- . . . , and 7d . . . -vi cítryam. . . .

They are likewise twice called “sovereign"},{"pageNumber":762,"pageContent":"V.64745kings” (samrā́j) (vss. 2, 3). The prefix sa﻿́m- “together,” signifying their unifying rule, contrasts with the repeated prefix ví- “apart,” which indicates the diverse things over which they hold sovereignty. This theme is announced in 2ab, where they are called samrā́jau over the world vida﻿́the “in its division.”Also translated and discussed in Brereton (1981: 104–6).1. O herdsmen of the truth, o you whose nature holds true, you two stand upon your chariot in the most distant heaven.For him whom you two help here, Mitra and Varuṇa, the rain swells rich in honey from heaven.2.

Sovereign kings, powerful bulls, and lords of heaven and of earth, Mitra and Varuṇa, who know no boundaries—you two approach the roar with shimmering clouds. You make heaven rain by the cunning of a lord.4. Mitra and Varuṇa, your cunning rests upon heaven. The sun, your light, moves as a shimmering weapon.You hide it in heaven by cloud and by rain. O Parjanya, the honeyed drops are arising.5. The Maruts harness their easy-running chariot for beauty, like a champion on cattle raids, o Mitra and Varuṇa.Thunder ranges through the shimmering air.

You place the sun here in heaven as your shimmering chariot.V.64 (418) Mitra and VaruṇaArcanānas Ātreya7 verses: anuṣṭubh, except paṅkti 7As often, the central verse of the hymn is its most enigmatic. The poet condenses this verse so that a number of interpretations are possible, all of them applicable to"},{"pageNumber":763,"pageContent":"V.64746the situation. The word upamá, here translated “closest,” might also mean “best.” Indeed, most translators choose the latter interpretation, but in the verses lead-ing up to this one, the poet constantly emphasizes the intimacy of Mitra and Varuṇa: In their arms they gather “the realm of solar glory” (vs. 1), which is likely both the celestial realm and the realm of the sacrifice. They stretch forth their arms to the sacrificers, who call on their affection (vs. 2). The sacrificers are accompanied by the protection of Mitra, “who never does injury” (vs. 3). In verse 4 the poet brings something close to the gods, although he does not state clearly what it is. In the more obvious reading it might be the sacrificial offerings and the sacrificial recitations. But it might also be gifts to the priests, or the inhabitants in the patrons’ dwellings, or the talent and learning that the priests bring to the ritual performance. In short, it might be everything that is part of the sacrifice or even part of the lives of the patrons and priests.In the final verses this theme of the closeness of Mitra and Varuṇa to the sac-rificers is expressed through a number of different strategies. The simile in 7cd is particularly striking. It turns on two homophonous present stems dhāva, one of which means “run” and the other “rinse, cleanse,” with the shift from one to the other signaled by the change from “feet” to “hands.” This word play maintains the sense of closeness of the sacrificers and the gods, since “cleanse” refers to a typical priestly action, while “run” is the desired action of the gods. That theme continues in verses 4 and 5, in which the poet invites Varuṇa and Mitra to the dwelling of generous patrons, which is also the gods’ “seat” or “abode” (vs. 5). And verse 6a begins yuváṃ naḥ “you two for us,” setting the 2nd- and 1st-person pronouns next to one another.1. With our verse we summon for you all Mitra and Varuṇa, who cares for the stranger,who, like corrals, have encompassed the realm of solar glory in their two arms.2. Let these two arms stretch forth with kind attention to him who chants,for again and again, in all places of the earth, I call on your benevolent affection.3. That I might now reach the way, I would travel by the path of Mitra.They go together with the protection of him [=Mitra] who is dear, who never does injury.4.

O Mitra, (you) and Varuṇa—(come) here for us with your bright lights, here into your seat,into their own dwelling, (that) of the generous patrons, for your partners to grow strong.6.

The basic theme of the hymn is the request that Mitra and Varuṇa help create a peaceful dwelling place that is broad and secure for people and animals during the period that the tribe is settled. While the poet addresses both Mitra and Varuṇa, his principal address is to Mitra: Mitra alone is mentioned in verse 4, in verse 5 Varuṇa appears only as the complement of Mitra, and in verse 6 Varuṇa’s presence is merely implied in the dual personal pronoun. Mitra is the god of alliances, and the reason for the focus on Mitra here is that the poet particularly wants people to occupy their proper places (vs. 6) by honoring their agreements with one another. The verb √yat “arrange” in this verse is elsewhere associated with the action of Mitra, who governs peoples through the pacts and alliances made among them.The word mitrá can refer not only to the god Mitra but also to a mitrá, an ally, and the poet makes use of this ambiguity in verse 4. The god Mitra wins a dwelling free from threat or constraint through the power of divinely sanctioned alliances, and therefore one who is a true ally, who embodies the principles of the god of alli-ances, also wins such a dwelling. The connection between the god Mitra and the human ally is further suggested by verse 3, in which Mitra and Varuṇa are invoked to give out the prizes of victory, and verse 4, in which the person in a parallel fash-ion distributes offerings.1. He who is perceptive has strong resolve. Let him speak among the gods for us—he whose songs beautiful Varuṇa or Mitra longs for.2. Since these two are kings of most glorious luster and farthest fame,they are lords of the settlement, who grow through the truth and possess the truth, among every people.3. Imploring you for help, I address you two ancient ones together:“Through your good perception, with your good horses, (race) toward the prizes of victory to give them out.”"},{"pageNumber":765,"pageContent":"V.667484.

The two of you, o Mitra, arrange this people and lead them together.Do not overlook the generous one nor us seers. Give us wide space under your protection.V.66 (420) Mitra and VaruṇaRātahavya Ātreya6 verses: anuṣṭubhThis hymn shows similarities to the preceding hymn, attributed to the same poet. Note especially the first line, whose beginning, ā́ cikitāna sukra﻿́tū “Here are the two of strong resolve, o perceptive mortal,” uses similar lexical elements as 65.1a ya﻿́ś cike﻿́ta sa﻿́ sukra﻿́tuḥ “He who is perceptive has strong resolve.” In V.65 the poet singles out Mitra, especially in the last three verses of the hymn. Here the poet addresses Varuṇa alone in the first verse and Mitra alone in the last. This strategy has the effect of defining a beginning and ending to the hymn, but there are also thematic reasons for this distribution of divine names as well. Verse 1 mentions the “truth” (r̥ta﻿́), which is particularly associated with Varuṇa, who presides over the truth, and in verse 6 the poet hopes that his people will take their places (yátemahi) under the gods’ protection. The root √yat “arrange,” here in the middle voice in the sense of “take one’s place,” is characteristically associated with Mitra’s task of “arranging” peoples according to the alliances among them, as was noted in the introduction to V.65.Renou characterizes this hymn as a eulogy of poetic power and an r̥ta﻿́, and he is right that these are central concerns of the poet. The power of the hymn is indi-rectly suggested in verses 1–2. In verse 1 the hymn is “set in place” (dadhītá) in the ritual, and this act finds a social and cosmological echo in the next verse, where the rule of Mitra and Varuṇa “is set in place” (dhāyi) in the way that the sun is set in place. That is to say, in terms of the verse sequence of the poem, the hymn appears in the ritual and then the rule of the gods appears. In verses 3–4 there is an extended description of the poet’s work that implicitly compares it to a raid. As they often are in the R̥gveda, the “chariots” sought by the poet (vs. 4) may be hymns or even sacrifices that journey to the gods. In verse 5 the gods perceive the hymn of the poet, brought to them by the “beacon of the peoples.” While interpreters have variously"},{"pageNumber":766,"pageContent":"V.66749identified this beacon, we believe that it is most likely Agni (cf. V.11.2), who trans-ports hymns and offerings to the gods.One of the poet’s strategies that makes this hymn interesting but difficult to interpret is his use of indeterminate ellipsis (cf. vss. 1, 2, 3) and obscure reference (esp. vs. 5). Verses 5–6 are the most intriguing example, because they form the cli-max of the hymn. In 5ab the poet dramatically declares that he will enunciate the “lofty truth,” but as is often the case, this lofty truth that he expresses in 5cd is an abstruse one. By the double reference of yā́mabhiḥ to a poet’s entreaties and to river courses, the words of the poet are compared to flowing streams. These streams flow over Heaven and Earth, which expand for the poet in response. In this reading of the hemistich, the masculine dual jrayasānaú “who extend” would be completed by dyā́vā or the like, “Heaven and Earth.” This is suggested by the vocative pr̥thivi in 5a, echoed by pr̥thú in c, for dyā́vā regularly appears alongside the nominative pr̥thivī́, as in I.159.1, II.12.13, II.41.20, VI.11.1, VII.69.1, and VIII.72.9. But the poet’s words carrying their entreaties also flow beyond to Mitra and Varuṇa, who likewise become even greater through them. Verse 6 then is a phalaśruti, a “declara-tion of benefit,” expressing the expectation of the poet and his people that they will live safely under the rule of Mitra and Varuṇa.1. O perceptive mortal, here are the two gods of strong resolve who care for the stranger.It [=the hymn] should be set in place for Varuṇa, whose garment is the truth, for his great pleasure.2. Because these two together have achieved lordly dominion that is not overturned,so then, like the lovely sun, (their dominion) over the sons of Manu has been set in place like their commandments.3. (We search for) you two in our quest for chariots (and for) a broad pasture-land for them.With our praise songs we will boldly conceive the good praise of him by whom the oblation is given,4. Because then, you undeceivable ones, by the fortresses of your skillyou perceive our verbal craft through the beacon of the peoples [=Agni], o you of purified skill.5. O Earth, this is their lofty truth in the seers’ quest for fame:by (the seers’) entreaties they [=poetic streams] flow beyond the two [=Heaven and Earth], who rightly extend widely,6.

It invokes the Ādityas in the first verse and then Varuṇa, Mitra, and Aryaman; in verse 2 just Varuṇa and Mitra, and then in verse 3 Varuṇa, Mitra, and Aryaman once again. The climax comes in the last verse, which suggests that all the forms of the Ādityas culminate in Mitra or Varuṇa—or, rather, in the two of them together. We offer this interpretation tentatively since the key lines are 5ab. As the parenthetical insertions in our translation indicate, it is not clear precisely how these lines should be construed.1. Yes indeed! It is just so, o god: the appointed place is worthy of the sacrifice and lofty, o Ādityas,o Varuṇa and Mitra, o Aryaman. You two have achieved the highest lordship.2.

He invokes her for wealth, a con-tinuing lineage, good fortune, and health (vs. 3). It is not clear, however, whether it is she whom the poet invokes in 3d or whether it is the two gods. The object is suppressed perhaps to create intentional ambiguity, since the gift that comes from guiltlessness is also the gift from Mitra and Varuṇa. The connection between Aditi, Mitra, and Varuṇa is confirmed in the last verse, which call them Ādityas, “sons of Aditi.”1.

Rudra is a healer but also a terrifying archer, and the purpose of the poet may be to make sure that the vengeance of Mitra and Varuṇa, which is like the fury of Rudra, be turned against his enemies. Mitra and Varuṇa should protect and rescue him and direct their anger toward the Dasyus, not toward him (vs. 3).This observation may help us understand the last verse, although its mean-ing remains uncertain. As also in IV.3.13, we read the beginning of pāda a as mā́ akásya, rather than mā́ kásya with the Padapāṭha and most other interpreters. The fear expressed in ab, then, is that the poet will be destroyed and thereby become a nonentity. This fear is not only for the present, but also for the future. In pāda c the poet asks that after death he not become a nobody, a nonentity, but that in heaven his remains form a new body and that on earth his life continue in his lineage.1. Since now there is help from you two, even in (its full) quantity and breadth,I have won the favor of you two, o Varuṇa and Mitra.2.

Both hymns are straightforward"},{"pageNumber":770,"pageContent":"V.72–73753invitations to Mitra and Varuṇa to come to the rite and to drink the soma. In V.71 the poet emphasizes his invocation to the two gods by repeating their names at the beginning of pāda b of each verse. The repetition is underlined by the fact that the names are followed in each case by just a single word completing the line, a word that has a different grammatical form and syntactic function in each verse.1. Come here to us with might, o you caring for the stranger, o Varuṇa and Mitra,to this cherished rite.2.

In verse 2 of this hymn he does not mention the names of the gods, as he does in the first and third verses, but rather begins pāda a with vrate﻿́na “by your command-ment” and ends pāda b with yātaya﻿́jjanā “who arrange the peoples.” The word vrata﻿́ is particularly associated with Varuṇa, both conceptually and etymologically, and √yat “arrange” describes the function of Mitra. Instead of pairing the two names, the poet has created a chiasmic pairing of the most characteristic functions of the gods.1. Like Atri, we pour an offering to Mitra and Varuṇa with our songs.– Sit down upon the ritual grass to drink the soma.2. By your commandment, you are those two who give peaceful dwellings that endure, who arrange the peoples according to your foundation.– Sit down upon the ritual grass to drink the soma.3.

Geldner"},{"pageNumber":771,"pageContent":"V.73754describes this hymn as strophic, consisting of five paired verses; this structure expresses the thematic division of the hymn.Verses 1–2 describe the Aśvins as moving somewhere, possibly near or possibly far, but in any case the poet invites them to travel here to his sacrifice. Since the poet has begun with a reference to journeys of the Aśvins, it is not surprising that he then turns to a description of their wonderful chariot. According to the interpretation we offer here, one wheel of that chariot is the sacrificial fire (vs. 3). Behind this sym-bolism is likely the recurrent representation of the sacrifice as a chariot, particularly as the Aśvins’ chariot. The other wheel of their chariot is the sun (vs. 4). Running on these two wheels the Aśvins both range over the whole world and are present at the sacrifice.Verses 5–6 are connected by the theme of heat, and as in the case of the two wheels, one form of heat is cosmic, the other form ritual. In verse 5 Sūryā, the daughter of the Sun, mounts the chariot of the Aśvins, which drives onward ahead of the rising, burning sun. In verse 6 what is called gharma﻿́ “hot” is either the Pravargya pot, in which the milk for the Aśvins is heated, or the hot milk itself. While verse 5 refers primarily to the sun and verse 6 to the Pravargya rite, there is also a secondary, implied reference to the ritual in verse 5 and to the sun in verse 6. The motif of Sūryā’s mounting the Aśvins’ chariot is always a courtship or wed-ding image. Here in verse 5 she may be brought as bride to Soma (cf. X.85), who is, of course, at the center of the rite.Because the interpretation of 8ab is uncertain, the connection between verses 7–8 is less clear than in the other pairs of verses. In verse 7 the horse thunders as he brings the Aśvins to the rite at the invitation of Atri, who may be not the Atri of legend but his present or future descendant. In verse 8ab the subject is sup-pressed, and various interpreters have suggested various possibilities: the Aśvins’ honeyed whip (Geldner), the hymn (Sāyaṇa, Geldner, cf. VIII.6.43), a cow (Pirart 2001: 243–44, cf. II.16.8). It could even be the “thundering” of the lead horse from the previous verse. We have left the identification unclear, although a reference to the hymn (dhī́) in one way or another appears to us likely. The balance between the Aśvins’ presence in the cosmos and in the rite is repeated in 8cd, which describes the Aśvins’ journey across the seas and the ritual offerings made to them.The concluding verses then restate the theme of the Aśvins’ journey throughout the world and explicitly connect that journey to the ritual, since they compare the hymns that bring the Aśvins to chariots.1. Whether today you two are far distant, whether close by, o Aśvins,or whether—o you who bring many enjoyments many times— (you are) in the midspace, come here.2. Here are these two who appear most often, bringing their many wondrous powers.With longing for space, I beseech the pair who are not poor.

Or to whom are they traveling (vs. 3)? The poet wishes them to come to Atri—as in the last hymn, the poet himself (vs. 1)—and to seek out his poetic formulations (vs. 3), not those of others. Several verses later, the poet returns once more to beg the Aśvins’ attention (vs. 6), to ask again whose inspired poetry and sacrifices have attracted the Aśvins (vs. 7), and to urge them to come to him (vss. 8–10). The last verse of the hymn echoes the first: verse 1 asks where"},{"pageNumber":773,"pageContent":"V.74756the Aśvins are (kū́ ṣṭhaḥ) and whether they will hear the poet (śravathaḥ); verse 10 addresses them wherever they are (kárhi cid) and anticipates that they will hear him (śuśrūyā́tam). Also, in the first verse the poet addresses the Aśvins as manāvasū “whose goods are zeal”—that is, as those who bring vigor and passion to sacrifi-cers—and vr̥ṣaṇvasū “whose goods are bull-like,” but in the last he speaks not of goods that the Aśvins bring but rather of the “good benefits” (va﻿́svī ḥ . . . bhújaḥ) the Aśvins will receive, thus reversing the beneficiaries of the goods.How the internal verses set within this frame are connected to the rest of the hymn is not clear. They tell how the Aśvins rescued Paura from real or metaphorical waters (vs. 4) and Cyavāna from old age and impotence (vs. 5). The story of Paura, whom the Anukramaṇī identifies as the poet of the hymn, is told elliptically. There is a cryptic etymological play on Paura’s name in 4ab that suggests that Paura had lost the prosperity that was his by right, or at least by name, but that he was restored to “muchness” by the Aśvins. Unfortunately, the meaning of paurá is not secure and therefore neither is this interpretation. This word play on paurá is set within a causal hí-clause, which normally would be dependent but here apparently is not, and it is then followed by an incomplete dependent clause, which lacks both subject and verb. The abstract dative gr̥bhīta﻿́tātaye “for captivity” suggests supplying a verb derived from √gr̥bh “capture”—“they capture him” or the like—but this interpreta-tion is not at all secure. Is the fragmented syntax an icon of the desperate situation that the Aśvins were able to redress?1. Where in heaven are you today, o divine Aśvins whose goods are zeal?Will you hear this, o you whose goods are bull-like? Atri is trying to win you.2. Where are these two? Where are they famed—the Nāsatyas, the two gods in heaven?Among what people do you take your place? Which of you two is in company with rivers?3. To whom do you journey? To whom do you come? Toward whom do you harness your chariot?In whose formulations do you delight? We wish you to seek (ours).4.

Aśvins, when you should hear this call anywhere,good benefits are yours and nourishments nourish you.V.75 (429) AśvinsAvasyu Ātreya9 verses: paṅktiTwo themes dominate this hymn. One, announced at the beginning of the first verse, is the chariot of the Aśvins, which conveys the gods to the sacrificial place. The other is the call of the poet, the theme of the hymn’s refrain. The two are intimately connected, since the purpose of the poet’s praise is to bring the Aśvins on their chariot to the sac-rificial ground. In verse 2 the poet imagines the chariot passing by the hymns of other sacrificers that claim to win the Aśvins and continuing on toward his sacrifice. Because the hymn is leading the Aśvins toward the poet, the voice of the poet rides on the chariot (vs. 4), and the Aśvins’ horses are harnessed by the thought of the poet (vs. 6). In 7cd the Aśvins are invoked to travel tira﻿́ś cid “even across,” but it is not clear across what. Geldner (and others, see Pirart 2001: 290–92) suggests a haplology of *arya﻿́ḥ because of the following aryayā́. In this interpretation, the line could mean “even across what belongs to the stranger” or “even across the strangers” or the like. By contrast, we inter-pret pāda c as a recollection of 2b and therefore supply the phrase “all those ‘I shall win’-s.” But in either case the Aśvins are again asked not to be seduced by the hymns and sacrifices of others, but to drive by them, heeding the poet’s summons to his sacrifice.1.

Verse 1 refers directly to the hot milk oblation offered to the Aśvins in the Pravargya ritual, but, as Houben (2000: 10) observes, the hymn itself indicates the dawn as the time of its recitation. Time is a central theme of the hymn: it is now that the Aśvins are praised (vs. 2), and at present the oblation is extended to the Aśvins (vs. 3). The Aśvins should respond to the praise and the offering because they come at all times, both day and night (vss. 2, 3). Because of the present offering and the ever-presence of the Aśvins, the poet hopes for the Aśvins’ “present help” (vs. 5).Although perhaps not as strongly, the poet puts a similar emphasis on place. The Aśvins should “journey here” (vs. 1, 3), where they are praised (vs. 2), for this is their place, home, house, and dwelling (vs. 4). The result is that wealth and good fortune will be here (vs. 5)."},{"pageNumber":776,"pageContent":"V.777591. Agni shines toward the face of Dawn.

The hymn refers to the Aśvins in the third person in every verse except the central one (3), when the poet turns to the Aśvins and addresses them directly, describing to them the chariot that brings them to his sacrifice. The description of the chariot compares or even identifies this chariot with the sacrifice, since “golden-skinned, honey-colored, ghee-backed, and carrying nourishments” can easily describe the sacrificial fire.The time of the Aśvins’ arrival is the particular concern of the poet. They are the gods prātaryā́vaṇā “who journey in the early morning,” and the poet insists that his hymn and offerings are given at the right time. They are not given too early when it is still dark, for the evening is the wrong time to make the offerings (vs. 2ab)—although whether it is the wrong time in general or the wrong time for the Aśvins in particular is unsure. Likewise, unlike others he does not make his offerings too late, after dawn has already broken (2cd).

Formally and thematically it appears to be a composite. It uses three different meters, unevenly divided among its verses. The first three verses, which invite the Aśvins to the soma-pressing, are all in the same meter, begin with an invocation to the Aśvins, and have a common refrain. They thus form a coherent piece. The last three verses, likewise in the same meter, are an incantation to facilitate childbirth at the proper time. Verse 7 apparently addresses the father of the child, verse 8 the child himself, and verse 9 the Aśvins or whatever other powers might help the childbirth. As Pirart (2001: 330–31) notes, this incantation has parallels at Atharvaveda Śaunaka I.11.6 and Vājasaneyisaṃhitā Mādhyaṃdina VIII.28.The middle three verses provide a transition from the invocation in verses 1–3 to the incantation in verses 7–9. Verse 4, which alone is in triṣṭubh meter, continues to ask the Aśvins to come, but they are to come not to attend the soma rite but to bring help, as they did when they rescued Atri.

He too is stuck and needs to be set free by the Aśvins, and his release is similarly compared to the opening of the womb so that a child may be born. The details of Saptavadhri’s difficulty and even Saptavadhri’s identity are unclear—he appears to be Atri in X.39.9 but else-where he is a different seer. According to Sāyaṇa he was trapped in small wooden casket from which the Aśvins set him free, but this narrative is likely a commentarial invention.The entrapment of these seers, already compared in the telling to the situation of a woman in labor, not only introduce the incantation in the last verses, but also provide paradigmatic narratives for the birth of the child. As the Aśvins released these seers, so they will release the child from the body of his mother.1. O Aśvins, come here! O Nāsatyas, do not lose the track!– Like wild geese, fly here to the soma-pressings.2. O Aśvins, like antelopes, like buffaloes searching after pasturage,like wild geese, fly here to the soma-pressings.3. O Aśvins, whose goods are prizewinners, take pleasure in our sacrifice to your liking.– Like wild geese, fly here to the soma-pressings.4.

O tree, spread apart, like the womb of a woman about to give birth.Hear my call, Aśvins, and free Saptavadhri.6. For the seer Saptavadhri, who is fearful and in need,o Aśvins, you bend the tree together and apart by your cunning.7. As the wind sways a lotus-pond in every direction,so let your unborn child stir. Let him in his tenth month come out.8. As the wind, as the forest, as the ocean stirs,so you in your tenth month—descend together with the afterbirth.9. Having lain for ten months within his mother, let the boycome out, alive and unharmed—alive from his living mother.V.79 (433) DawnSatyaśravas Ātreya10 verses: paṅktiA hymn with a remarkably unwavering focus on material gain.

The tone is set by the increasingly monotonous refrain: “o well-born lady, liberal with horses.” Several patrons are named in the first verses (1–3), and the poet hopes that patrons in general will be the recipients of Dawn’s bounty, in order for them to redistribute it to the poets (4–8).The usual attention to Dawn’s beauty, her first appearance, her journey, her cows, and so forth is entirely missing in this hymn, which does, however, con-tain one striking image, in verse 9. Why a laggard Dawn would be compared to a thief isn’t entirely clear, but it is quite possibly because thieves worked at night.1. Awaken us today for great wealth, o Dawn, as heaven-bright one,just as you also awakened us at Satyaśravas Vāyya’s– o well-born lady, liberal with horses.2.

Dawn’s association with wealth is mentioned in verse 3, but the focus is first on her journey (vss. 1–3) and then, in the second half of this brief hymn (vss. 4–6), on the beauty of her body as it is slowly revealed in the grow-ing light, in images of delicate sensuality.Each verse but the first begins with the emphatic pronoun eṣā́ “she,” and there is no doubt that “she” is all that matters in the hymn.1. The lofty one whose course is brilliant, who is truthful through her truth, whose breath is ruddy, who is widely radiant,goddess Dawn who brings the sun here—in response to her do the inspired poets awaken with their poetic thoughts.2. She, worthy to be seen, awakening the people, making the paths easy to travel, drives in the vanguardwith a lofty chariot, herself lofty, setting all in motion. Dawn extends her light in the vanguard of the days.3. She, after hitching up with her ruddy cows, without fail has produced her wealth unremittingly.Blazing paths for good passage, the goddess, praised by many, bringing all valuables, radiates widely.4.

However, the subject of Savitar does not seem to have inspired him to the same poetic heights as the Maruts did. The hymn depicts Savitar as a power in the cosmos (especially vss. 2–5), but also as a poet and distributor of benefits to mortals (1–2ab).1. They hitch up their mind and they hitch up their insights—the inspired poets attentive to the poetic inspiration of the lofty inspired poet.He distributes the ritual offerings as the only one who knows the patterns. Great is the encircling praise of Savitar.2. The sage poet fastens all forms upon himself.

This lovely hymn, much translated, is reminiscent of the Marut hymns in this maṇḍala, though not ascribed to the same poet. (The Maruts are addressed here in vs. 6.) Vivid images of the power of the thunderstorm are mingled with expressions of thanks for the fructifying effects of the accompanying rains, depicted as sexual in nature. In the last verse the poet describes all the good Parjanya has done, but gently urges him to desist.1. Address the powerful one with these hymns. Praise Parjanya. With reverence seek to entice him here.The constantly roaring bull of lively drops deposits his semen as embryo in the plants.2. He smashes apart the trees and also smashes the demons.

The poem is a sort of riddle: the first verse establishes that Earth is the addressee, and in the next verse the address to a feminine being (the word “earth” is feminine in gender and conceived of as female) continues. But none of the characteristics mentioned in that verse seem particularly Earth-like. She"},{"pageNumber":784,"pageContent":"V.85767is addressed as oscillating and silvery; she is associated with the nights; she “flings” moisture. The riddle is—under what circumstances could Earth be so described? The answer: under the darkness of the monsoon clouds, when thunder causes her to shake (thus “oscillating”; see V.83.5) and she is “silvery” with rain, which she “flings” in the forms of streams and rivulets down her slopes, mentioned in verse 1. This solution was adumbrated by Thieme (1964: 58) and is discussed further in Jamison (2013).If the audience doesn’t solve the riddle in verse 2, verse 3 provides the answer.1. Yes indeed! (It is) just so: you bear the pressure of the mountains, o Earth,as you bring the ground to life with your greatness, o gently sloping great one.2.

But what is the connection between these two sides of Varuṇa? The poet joins the two functions of Varuṇa formally by the repetition of the accented preverb ví-, meaning “out,” “apart,” or the like. In fashioning the world and sustaining life, Varuṇa “split apart” (ví . . . jaghā́na, 1c), “stretched out” (ví . . . tatāna, 2a), “soaks” (vy u﻿̀natti, 3d), and “measured out” (ví mame﻿́, 5d). All this leads up to the plea that Varuṇa “unbind” (ví ṣya, 8c) the wrongs that people commit. With their sense of opening up and freeing, the verbal compounds with ví- create not only a verbal con-nection between Varuṇa’s cosmogonic and redemptive acts, but a logical one as well. On the cosmological plane Varuṇa spread out the world beneath the sun (vs. 1cd), stretched out the midspace (vs. 2ab), and lets loose the rain (vss. 3–4) and the rivers (vs. 6). Analogously, on the moral plane he loosens the fetters that people’s evildoing would otherwise create (vs. 8). Thus the hymn is dominated by the name of Varuṇa, which occurs in every verse except one (vs. 6) and the preverb ví-. Even where these do not appear, the poet echoes va﻿́ruṇa and ví- throughout the hymn by repeating words"},{"pageNumber":785,"pageContent":"V.85768containing -v- and, especially, beginning with v-, for example, va﻿́neṣu and vā́jam opening 2a and 2b, te﻿́na víśvasya and ya﻿́vaṃ na﻿́ vr̥ṣṭír ví at the beginning of 3c and 3d, va﻿́ruṇo va﻿́ṣṭi in 4b, vasata and vīrā́ḥ in 4c and 4d, and so forth.In all of this, verse 6 is anomalous, since it does not mention Varuṇa by name and does not contain ví- or even a word beginning with v-. It is generally more difficult to explain why something does not occur than why something does, but the position and content of the verse suggest possible reasons for these omissions. First, the verse may be marked, albeit by absence, because it is the transitional verse from the cosmologi-cal themes of the first part of the hymn to the redemptive one of the last two verses. Second, the theme of the verse is the mystery of the god. Its center is the paradox in 6cd that the “sea”—whatever body of water is meant by that—never fills despite the waters flooding into it. The opening line of the verse mentions Varuṇa’s māyā́, his “cunning,” and calls him the kavítama, “the foremost sage poet,” the one who best knows and best articulates what he knows. The poet may have suppressed overt men-tion of Varuṇa’s name to indicate the impenetrability of his power and mind.1. Chant forth to the sovereign king a lofty and deep formulation, dear to famed Varuṇa,who, like a butcher an animal hide, split apart the earth to form an underlayer for the sun.2. He stretched out the midspace upon the trees, the prize of victory in the steeds, the milk in the ruddy (cows);Varuṇa placed resolve in hearts, fire in waters, the sun in heaven, and soma on the stone.3. Varuṇa has poured out the cask with its opening below upon the two world-halves and the midspace.By this he is king of the whole living world. Like rain the barley, he soaks the land.4. He soaks the land, the earth, and heaven. When Varuṇa wishes milk to flow, then surely it does:the mountains cloak themselves with the rain cloud; showing their might, the heroes [=the Maruts?] let themselves loose.5. I proclaim this great cunning of the lordly, famed Varuṇa,who, standing in the midspace as if with a measuring rod, measured out earth with the sun.6. And now no one defies this great cunning of the foremost sage poet, the god:that the mottled streams, pouring out, do not fill the single sea with water.7. O Varuṇa, the offense that we have committed against any partner, be he one by alliance or one by custom, or against a brother,or against a neighbor—whether native or foreign—o Varuṇa, loosen that."},{"pageNumber":786,"pageContent":"V.867698.

There are elements of both types in this hymn. On the one hand, Indra and Agni are invoked as a pair through much of the hymn with fairly all-purpose phraseology. On the other, the two exploits described (in 1cd and the very difficult 3cd, the middle of the hymn) are Indraic: the first a clear reference to the Vala myth, though with Trita, not Indra, as hero; the second a reference to the Vr̥tra myth, with some curious features, especially the unidentified wooden object.1. Indra and Agni, the mortal whom you both help in the prize-contests,that one splits open even the fastnesses to (reach) their brilliant (contents), as Trita (did) the voices (of the cows? of the rivers?).2. You two who are difficult to surpass in battles, who are worthy of fame at the prize-contests,who sur(mount) the five domains—these two, Indra and Agni, we invoke.3. Vehement is the force of those two bounteous ones, sharp their missile.With the wooden (weapon?) in the hands of the Vr̥tra-smasher he [=Vr̥tra-smashing Indra] goes questing (in his quest) for cattle.4. In our quest for chariots we call upon you two, Indra and Agni,the two lords of powerful generosity, the knowing ones who most long for hymns.5. The two, growing strong through the days, the two gods undeceptive to the mortal,just these two do I set in front, the two gods like portions for a steed, though themselves deserving (portions).6.

(It is convenient here to place the final two pādas on a separate verse line.) The end of the first hemistich of each verse is marked by the unusual formation evayā́marut, which serves as an internal refrain, syntacti-cally unconnected to the rest of the verse. This word is aberrantly formed, and our translation reflects what we consider its intent, rather than a literal value. (The Anukramaṇī names Evayāmarut as the poet of this hymn, but the name is obvi-ously secondarily derived from the refrain. We would not be surprised if Śyāvāśva was responsible for this playful Marut hymn.) Indeed, the syntax is lax in a number of verses, which appear to be constructed of metrical phrases with internal syntac-tic unity but loosely strung together.In terms of content the most striking feature is the close association between the god Viṣṇu and the Maruts. The Maruts are mentioned with Viṣṇu in other places in the R̥gveda, but not in such a sustained fashion as here. The thematic connection between them is not entirely clear, but Viṣṇu’s famous three strides from earth to heaven, via the midspace, do remind us of the ever-journeying Maruts, who gener-ally inhabit the midspace but are found also both in heaven and on earth.1.

The Anukramaṇī identifies the majority of the hymns as products of the epony-mous clan poet himself, Bharadvāja, whose patronymic is Bārhaspatya. These include all of the Agni series (1–16), much of the Indra series (17–30 and 37–43), the Pūṣan series (53–60), and the miscellaneous hymns to various divinities toward the end of the maṇḍala (61–74). The composite hymns coming at the end of the Indra series (44–46, also 48) are ascribed to a different Bārhaspatya poet, Śaṃyu Bārhaspatya, but since Śaṃyu is a speaking name (“seeking luck,” reinterpreted from the archaic compound śaṃyo﻿́ḥ “luck and lifetime”), this name may well be a nickname of Bharadvāja. The remaining hymns are attributed to several different descendants of Bharadvāja, all bearing the patronymic Bhāradvāja; these include a number of Indra hymns (31–36, 47), the All God series (49–52), and the final hymn of the maṇḍala, the famous weapon hymn (75).Although the Indra hymns outnumber the Agni hymns, the Indra hymns are, for the most part, not terribly notable, though deftly executed. By contrast, the Agni hymns specialize in imaginative descriptions of physical fire, and VI.9, a hymn ostensibly dedicated to Agni Vaiśvānara, contains one of the most striking medita-tions on the acquisition and employment of poetic craft in the R̥gveda. The hymn VI.28, interrupting the Indra cycle, contains a charming blessing of the cows, and the “clan” hymn, VI.48, repays the attention its difficulties demand. This hymn contains, inter alia, a remarkable, if cryptic, address to the god Pūṣan, and Pūṣan is an especial preoccupation of the Bharadvāja poets, with VI.53–60 containing the only sustained cycle of hymns in the R̥gveda addressed to this minor deity. Other gods, well represented in other maṇḍalas, receive relatively short shrift: there is only a single hymn to the Maruts (66), two to Uṣas (64–65), and so on.

As the first hymn in the maṇḍala, it thus establishes an image of a settled and well-ordered society unified in its devotion to the gods to which the rest of the maṇḍala will be dedicated.The arrival and installation occupy verses 1–3; verses 4–8 show Agni’s reach through the community, from the individual house, to the clan and settlements, and indeed to all who claim Manu (the first sacrificer) as ancestor.

The hymn ends the same way (vss. 10–11), with special mention of Agni’s position in the individual house as well as his role as clanlord. The similarity between beginning and ending is marked by a signal of ring composition: the god Mitra compared to Agni in both the first and last verses. Agni is often compared with or identified with Mitra (“Ally, Alliance”) because of his position on earth as guest and helper of men, though himself a god, and because, as god, he mediates the sacrificial alliance between gods and men.By contrast, the verses in between (6–9) offer a sequence of increasingly dense and complex images of fire, starting with a simple one of whirling smoke and sun-like brightness (vs. 6), but the comparisons in verses 7cd–8 rely on multiple puns and terse and elliptical phraseology.

With these decorous sentiments out of the way, the poet can indulge himself for the rest of the hymn (vss. 3–8) in a series of compressed and vivid images of fire as a natural substance, involving both sight (esp. vss. 3–5, 8) and sound (esp. vss. 6–7). The almost feverish succession of image upon image and the contorted phraseology are reminiscent of the depictions of natural fire in VI.2.6–9, but allowed even freer rein and more space. The hymn ends abruptly, without the usual prayers for benefits or even a summary verse calling attention to the praise just offered to Agni. It is a wild, exhilarating, and often baf-fling ride, especially in the original Sanskrit.1. O Agni, he who protects the truth and is born in truth will dwell in peace; he who seeks you as god will reach broad light,that mortal whom you, o god, as Varuṇa in concert with Mitra, protect from narrow straits along with abandonment.2.

It begins (vs. 1) by asking Agni to sacrifice for us today as always, in his accustomed role (vs. 2). It ends (vss. 7–8) with a statement of our service to Agni and prayers for benefits. The verses in between (3–6) describe fire in its naturalistic aspect, as in the two previous hymns but generally in more straightforward terms (vs. 5 is an exception and has been variously interpreted).1.

It begins “I call for you (all)”—the poet announcing that he is performing his ritual task for his priestly colleagues. He continues with praise of Agni and description of his roles, including that of giver of goods (vss. 1–3). The next two verses contrast the enemy of the mortals present and the punishment he should receive from Agni (vs. 4) with the pious server and the rewards he deserves (vs. 5). Two more verses (6–7) urge Agni to perform these tasks.1. I call for you upon the son of strength, the youth of undeceptive speech, the youngest one, with our thoughts—the provident one of many choices who sends all choice treasures, the one without deceit.2.

It is only verse 3 that depicts Agni’s relationship with mortals.1. The head of heaven, the spoked wheel of the earth, Agni Vaiśvānara, born in truth,sage poet, sovereign king, guest of the peoples—as a drinking cup to their mouth did the gods beget (him).2.

He, the very resolute one, who measured out the dusky spaces, (measured) out the luminous realms of heaven—the sage poet Vaiśvānara—who extends himself around all creatures, he is the undeceivable herdsman, the protector of the immortal.VI.8 (449) Agni VaiśvānaraBharadvāja Bārhaspatya7 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 7Another Vaiśvānara hymn, and the cosmic aspects of Agni (and his double, the Sun), extensively treated in VI.7, are touched upon (vss. 2–3). Verse 1 strongly establishes a sacrificial context, however, which returns in verse 4, relating the primal establishment of the ritual fire. The remaining verses (5–7) beg him for benefits.The hymn is also structured by a phonetic figure, the constant repetition of ini-tial v- (see, e.g., 2c, 3a, 3c, all beginning with the preverb ví), indexing the epithet vaiśvānara, a form of which occurs in every verse but 5.1.

In this progression the hymn is very reminiscent of IV.5, also a hymn to Agni in his Vaiśvānara aspect and one in which a poet receives his poetic inspiration from Agni.The first and last (7) verses establish a ritual context: the fire is being kindled in the darkness just before daybreak; its light, which dispels the physical darkness, will be configured as the metaphorical light of inspiration in the rest of the hymn. Verses 2–3 are responsive verses, with verse 2 couched in the 1st-person singular voice of the poet. He confesses his lack of knowledge of poetic craft, metaphori-cally expressed as weaving. The burden is all the greater in that he feels pressure to surpass his father, whose poetic heir he is. On the basis of the second pāda of this verse, many scholars have interpreted the whole hymn as a depiction of a brah-modya, a poetic contest among rival poets, but we see no evidence of a formal contest here, simply a poet struggling to find his place as a poet within the bardic tradition.The response to this verse in verse 3 provides the answer to the poet’s perplex-ity: he will learn his craft if he rightly perceives the ritual fire (who is not mentioned by name). This verse not only provides the answer, but serves as an example of the poet’s growing skill, for the last pāda of the verse can be read with double applica-tion, both to the poet and to Agni. On the one hand, the repetition of “higher” and “below” from 2cd suggests that the same father-son pair is referred to as there, and that the poet is asserting that he will indeed obtain the upper hand over his father from the revelation of Agni. On the other, the pāda can be read as a riddling defini-tion of the god Agni himself, who “moves about below” on the human plane, but “sees above the other” (perhaps the sun, as another form of fire), because he goes all the way to heaven bearing men’s oblations to the gods. Thus, what we translate as “ ‘(He [=the poet] is) the herdsmen of the immortal’—(the son who, though) he moves about below, sees above the other [=his father]” can also be read as “(He [=Agni] is) the herdsmen of the immortal, who, though he moves about below, sees above the other [=sun?].”"},{"pageNumber":800,"pageContent":"VI.9783That Agni is the object to be rightly perceived, referred to but not named in verse 3, which will confer poetic prowess, is made very clear in verse 4, though again the name Agni does not appear—only unmistakable descriptions of fire. The imme-diacy of the revelation is underlined by the repeated near-deictic pronoun “here (is)” (a: ayám, b: idám, c: ayám). This anonymous but unambiguous description of Agni is continued in verse 5, where he is the entire focus also of the gods. Also important in verse 5 is the characterization of Agni as “swiftest mind,” for it is the mental energy of Agni that the poet is absorbing.In verse 6 the 1st-person poet returns, and with clear excitement testifies to the new flights of his poetic perception and imagination, matching the swift-flying mind of Agni in verse 5. The “light deposited in my heart” is clearly the light of Agni’s inspiration. He ends the verse with questions about what he will now say and think—no longer out of a feeling of powerlessness (as in vs. 2), but a sense of future possibilities. (This difference is also conveyed by a change in verbal tense/mood: in verse 2 he wonders about his speech in the subjunctive mood; here he uses the future tense, conveying certainty.)The hymn has a neatly structured omphalos shape. Verses 1 and 7 are the ritual frame; verses 2 and 6 contain the contrasting 1st-person self-descriptions of the poet; verses 3 and 5 provide the inner frame, identifying Agni as the object of per-ception of both gods and men; while verse 4 is the omphalos, with its insistent, deictic revelation of Agni immediately before the poet’s (and our) eyes.1. The black day and the silvery day roll out through the two dusky realms according to their knowing ways.Agni Vaiśvānara, (even) while being born, like a king suppressed the dark shades with his light.2.

Just he (knows) the thread; he knows how to weave; he will be able to speak what is to be said in proper order—(the one) who will rightly perceive him [=Agni]: “(He [=the poet] is) the herdsmen of the immortal”—(the son who, though) he moves about below, sees above the other [=his father].4. Here is the foremost Hotar: look at him. Here is the light, immortal among mortals.Here was he born, set steadfast down here, immortal, becoming strong through his own body.5.

It is characterized, however, by a subtle strain of deliber-ately misleading expectations (in part necessarily obscured by translation). On several occasions the audience would automatically assign a referent on the basis of formulaics and context only to discover later in the verse that the assumed reference is wrong. In translation this is most easily seen in verse 3, where the first phrase appears to describe Agni, but it turns out to be instead the poet serving Agni. The beginning of verse 2 belongs to a formula found in a number of places in the R̥gveda that imposes an identification of Agni on the opening demonstra-tive “that.” It is only in the second half of the verse that it becomes clear that the demonstrative instead modifies “praise.” The extreme ellipsis of verse 2 con-tributes to this game of disappointed expectations: two objects in that verse lack overt verbs to govern them.1. Set in front your gladdening, heavenly Agni, (who receives) well-twisted (hymns), while the sacrifice, the ceremony is proceeding.(Set him) in front with solemn words, for he is far-radiant for us.

The hymn is noteworthy in using the metaphor of riches/wealth for an abundance of good fighting men: the phrase “riches of the stranger” in verse 3 refers, in our opinion, to the manpower of the Ārya, and this metaphor is repeated in verse 5.1. The mortal who (has placed his) friendship in Agni and has savored insight through his insightful thoughts,chewing (it [=insight]) now, he should be the first to choose (it as) refreshment, for help.2. For just Agni is provident; Agni is the seer, the best ritual adept.Agni as Hotar do the clans of Manu reverently invoke at the sacrifices.3.

The first verse announces these two themes in order, allotting each a half-verse. The two mythic segments are separated by a verse about Indra’s general cosmogonic deeds (7); the last three verses (13–15) urge Indra to use the same powers to help the poet and his patrons."},{"pageNumber":812,"pageContent":"VI.17795The account of both narratives emphasizes the role of soma in rousing Indra to his great deeds, and the hymn begins with three verses (1–3) with the insistent imperative “drink!” The Vala myth is in fact configured as a model for Indra’s behavior in the present with the mythic deeds presented as still to happen: he is enjoined to drill through to the cattle pen (vss. 2, 3) and to disclose the sun (vs. 3). The hymn thus appears to be associated with the activities at dawn. The Vr̥tra myth is more consistently presented as a deed in the past (though see vss. 8, 11).1. Drink the soma! The cattle enclosure that you will drill through to, mighty Indra, when you are greatly sung—you bold mace-bearer, who will hew apart Vr̥tra and all hostile things with your powers—2. Drink it!

The sheer power of Indra, thus expressed, overshadows his particular deeds, which are mentioned in a somewhat cursory way: Vala (vs. 5), Vr̥tra (vs. 6, also 9 and 14), the destruction of various named monsters (vs. 8). The poet is also fond of figures involving a positive and a twist on its negation: “vanquishing but unvan-quished” (vs. 1), and so forth.This focus on Indra’s power betrays some nervous worry about the existence of that power, expressed especially in the rhetorical question and answer in verses 3–4. A number of hymns in the R̥gveda raise the question of whether Indra himself"},{"pageNumber":814,"pageContent":"VI.18797exists; here the existential anxiety has been displaced to an abstract entity, his might, but the poet asserts its existence so often and so unequivocally that his audience can scarcely doubt it. Needless to say, the recital of Indra’s strength is not disinter-ested: the poet calls for Indra to use his powers in defense of the poet’s people and, in the last verse (15), to perform the deed that exists for him to do (a nice return to the existential theme), in order to merit another poem from the poet.1. Praise him whose might is overpowering, the vanquishing but unvanquished, much-summoned Indra.Mighty, conquering but unconquered, the bull of the settled domains—strengthen him with these songs.2.

But most of the rest of the hymn is devoted to a verse-by-verse listing of Indra’s great deeds, not only the standard Vr̥tra (vs. 2) and Vala (vss. 3–4) tales, but also the defeat of a series of named enemies on behalf of named mortal clients. Some of these stories are familiar (the Śuṣṇa/Kutsa story, vss. 4–5, and the stealing of Namuci’s head, vs. 6), and some are mentioned much more rarely (e.g., Vetasu and Tuji, vs. 8), with unclear details. Many of these same stories are also treated in VI.26.1. O Indra, wealth that in its vast power surmounts (the wealth) of the stranger, (namely) the peoples in battles, as heaven does the earth,that brings thousands as plunder, wins fertile fields, and overcomes obstacles—give that (wealth) to us, o son of strength.2.

You, Indra, became the first strengthener. Making wide space for Uśanā Kāvya,(to him as?) grandfather you handed over Navavāstu, who was to be delivered up, as his own grandson.12.

This theme is connected to the common worry about whether Indra himself exists and, if so, where—subtly articulated in verses 2 and 4, and triumphantly refuted in the last pāda of verse 10. The themes are connected by the anxiety about Indra’s epiphany (see esp. vs. 4). Since the goal of the soma sacrifice is to produce Indra’s epiphany, that is, his appearance at our ritual ground, then his absence may result either from"},{"pageNumber":819,"pageContent":"VI.21802his favoring another group of sacrificers and poets or from the fact that he doesn’t exist at all!1.

VI.21.4]). In fact, the same phrase is used in both hymns to introduce other questions: VI.21.6 tám pr̥chántaḥ “(the singers) asking about him” and VI.22.5 tám pr̥chántī “(the song) asking about him.” In each case the subject (singers or song) seeks information about ways to make contact and find favor with Indra, though the anxiety seems less in this hymn than in VI.21.The similarities between VI.21 and 22 extend to their final verses. The exhor-tation to come here with his teams in VI.22.11 is structurally and semantically, though not lexically, parallel to two halves of the two final verses of VI.21, 11ab and 12cd—an interesting example of how a poet can expand an underlying formu-laic sequence by inserting new material.Otherwise, the hymn alternates verses praising Indra’s qualities and deeds in list-like fashion (e.g., vss. 1cd, 2cd) and begging him for wealth and martial help (e.g., vss. 3, 8, 10). Stylistically it is noteworthy that in much of the hymn, particu-larly at the beginning, the initial word of every half-verse refers to Indra (1a, c; 2a, c; 3a; 5a, c; 7a, c; 11a). In 3c, the first half-verse in the hymn not beginning with a word referring to Indra, the poet tricks us by playing on our expectations: the yáḥ “who” could easily be Indra, as it was earlier (see 1a, c), but in fact has a different referent. The most complex verse syntactically is verse 5, which is perhaps fitting, as it describes the poet’s own song.1. To him who alone is to be called by the separate peoples, to Indra chant with these hymns,to the bull with bull-like strength who is master, the real “real thing” with many magic wiles, mighty.2.

This theme is established in the first pāda of the first verse, and every subsequent verse has some reference to soma: all but verse 8 contain a form of the word so﻿́ma (and vs. 8 does make clear reference to soma-induced exhilaration), and of those, all but verse 7 have “pressed,” “pressing,” or “presser” as well. The other ritual aspects of the soma sacrifice, especially the poetry and sacred formulations, also receive frequent men-tion. The reminders to Indra that sacrificial labor should be requited with gifts and help from the god occur throughout the hymn, but are not annoyingly obtrusive.Stylistically the hymn is noteworthy for its pairs of syntactically linked verses: 1–2 with their “or when” clauses; 3–4 with their run of agent nouns governing accusa-tive objects; 5–6 with a number of repeated formulae.1. You are intertwined in the pressed soma, Indra, and in the praise song, in the sacred formulation, and in solemn speech as it is recited,when, bounteous one, you drive with your two yoked fallow bays, bearing your mace in your arms,2. Or when on the decisive day, Indra, you help the soma-presser in the smiting of obstacles [/Vr̥tra] and at the contest of champions,or when, (yourself) being unafraid, as their skill became fearful, you subdued the vaunting Dasyus, Indra.3. Let Indra be the drinker of the pressed soma, the mighty one ever leading the singer forward with his help,the maker of wide space for the hero and the soma-presser, the giver of goods to his praiser, even a feeble one,4. Going to even such pressings as these with his two fallow bays, bearing his mace, drinking soma, giving cows,who makes the manly hero possessed of hale heroes, the hearer of the singer’s call, for praise songs are his vehicle.5. It is for him that we toil at what he holds dear—for Indra, who has performed labor for us from of old.When the soma is pressed, we sing praise; (a priest) recites the solemn words, so that the sacred formulation will be strengthening for Indra.6. For you have made the sacred formulations strengthening for yourself, to the extent that we have toiled for you, Indra, with our thoughts.When the soma is pressed, o soma-drinker, might we make (the pressings/the formulations) to be most wealful, enjoyable means of increase (for you) through our sacrifices."},{"pageNumber":823,"pageContent":"VI.248067.

The importance of mortal praise and worship for maintaining Indra’s powers is not forgotten; see verses 7–8 and especially verse 6, which seems to concern the traffic in praise: inspiration going out from Indra to the poets and then returning to him as praise (for a similar sentiment and phraseol-ogy, see VI.34.1). The last two verses (9–10) ask for Indra’s gifts and protection.1. Bullish exuberance, noise, and solemn words are in Indra; he is the drinker of the pressings and in possession of the silvery drink, when the soma juices are in his company.He is worthy to be chanted by men with solemn words as the bounteous one, the heaven-ruling king of hymns, whose help is imperishable.2.

The various types of opponents are vividly described, as well as the potential types of hostile encounter: see especially the apparent wrestling match in 4ab. But the poet’s expressed confidence in Indra’s ability to provide the decisive assistance is also a subtle way of asserting the supremacy of Indra. This second theme can be seen"},{"pageNumber":825,"pageContent":"VI.25808more clearly by examining the structure of the hymn: verse 5, which concerns the invincibility of Indra, is the exact middle of the hymn and serves as an omphalos; verses 4 and 6 match each other in structure and referents and form a ring around the omphalos, with a further ring provided by repeated phrases in verses 1/2 and 8/9, with Indra’s supremacy repeated in verse 8.1. What is your nearest help, what your farthest, and what your midmost, tempestuous Indra,with those (forms of help) help us well at the Vr̥tra-smashing and with these prizes, as the great one among us, o mighty one.2.

O Indra, the rapacious ones who, kin or not kin, have hitched themselves up, turning here against us,(render) their powers faltering, smash their bull-like (strengths), put them far away.4. Now a champion may defeat (another) champion with his limbs when the two, their bodies gleaming, will set upon each other in their struggle to overcome,or when, with offspring, cattle, lineage, waters, and fields at stake, their two war-cries will dispute with each other.5. Yet no champion, no overpowering and no bold one, no one thinking himself a fighter has fought against you.Indra, none of these is equal to you. You dominate all that have been born.6. He is master of the manly power of both of these (armies) when the ritual adepts call on him in the clash,when, whether an obstacle or a dwelling place rich in men is at issue, the two (armies) in their expansion keep tussling mightily back and forth with one another.7. So then, when your separate peoples will stir, Indra, become the rescuer and defender (of those,)our most manly patrons, who have set us ahead of the stranger, o Indra.8.

The first two verses also play with the word vā́ja “prize,” perhaps punning on the name of the poet and his bardic clan, Bharad-vāja. The middle part of the hymn (vss. 3–6) gives brief accounts of Indra’s battles against various named enemies and his aid to various named mortal allies; in this structure it is very reminiscent of VI.20, and many of the same inci-dents, with the same, often obscure names, are found in both hymns. The final two verses (7–8) beg Indra to show the same powers in aid of the poet and his patrons. The structure of the hymn is thus both fairly conventional and also symmetrical, with requests to the god in the first two and last two verses and the middle four verses providing previous models for the aid the god is asked to supply.Stylistically noteworthy is the regular fronting of the personal pronoun. Beginning with verse 2, every half-verse through 5a has a fronted form of the 2nd-person sin-gular pronoun “you” (and usually another one in an even pāda: 2d, 3b, 4d), either nominative tuva﻿́m or accusative tvā́m. The rest of verse 5 briefly breaks the pat-tern, which returns in verse 6. Then, interestingly, the 1st person asserts itself: 7a aha﻿́m “I”, 8a vaya﻿́m “we,” with 2nd-person genitive ta﻿́va (7b) and instrumental tva﻿́yā (7c) interspersed. This distribution corresponds to the thematic structure of the hymn, with the recounting to Indra of his own deeds followed by requests of him by us mortals on our own behalf. Verse 7 brings the 1st person “I” and 2nd person “you” into happy conjunction.1. Hear us, Indra. We are calling to you as we are “boiling over” at the winning of the great prize.When the clans clash together at the contest of champions, give us mighty help on the decisive day.2. To you does the prizewinner, son of a prizewinner, call, at the winning of the great prize to be secured,to you, Indra, the surpassing master of settlements, when there are obstacles; to you does the fist-fighter look as he fights for cattle.3. You spurred the poet [=Uśanā Kāvya] on at the winning of the (sun’s) rays. You wrung out Śuṣṇa for the pious Kutsa.You struck far away the head of the invulnerable one, intending to do (a deed) worthy to be proclaimed for Atithigva.4.

It begins with a question, a question all the more open because one of the crucial terms is unspecified (though easily supplied), the repeated pronoun asya “of it”—referring, clearly, to soma. The question is what did Indra make or create under the influence “of it,” and the surprisingly broad answer given in the responsive verse 2 is “what exists.”The unqualified comprehensiveness of Indra’ production—“being,” “what exists”—is contrasted with our imperfect knowledge of his powers in verse 3. But even what small proportion of that power we have experienced (vs. 4) was more than sufficient to destroy the Vr̥cīvant army of the enemy Varaśikha for the benefit of the poet’s patron, Abhyāvartin Cāyamāna—a battle described in verses 4–7. The second half of verse 6 is especially notable for its warrior slang: the phrase “playing the lord’s role for an arrow,” which also appears in X.27.6, in our opinion refers to warriors’ boasting, and “breaking their pots,” which many commentators have tried to interpret literally, must show the same use of “pot” for “head” as, for example, German “Kopf ” and French “tête.” In our opinion the site of the battle is the con-fluence of two rivers, mentioned by name in verses 5 and 6, and then referred to jointly in verse 7. The dual bovines in that verse have been variously interpreted, but"},{"pageNumber":828,"pageContent":"VI.27811in our opinion, despite a problem with grammatical gender, the most likely referents are the rivers, in a phrase very reminiscent of one (III.33.1) describing two rivers as mother cows licking each other in the famous hymn III.33, the dialogue between the poet Viśvāmitra and two rivers.The final verse is a dānastuti, praising and detailing the gift made by Abhyāvartin Cāyamāna to the poet. The poet gives his patron the epithets “bounteous,” a stan-dard qualification of Indra (as in vs. 3 in this very hymn), and “universal king,” also regularly used of Indra (among other divinities). He thus verbally associates his patron with the unlimited power of Indra, as it was portrayed earlier in the hymn.1. What did Indra create in the exhilaration of it, what at the drinking of it? what in the fellowship of it?Or those [=priests] who were there with joy at the installation of it—what did those previous ones acquire? what do the current ones?2.

(But) there has appeared just that Indrian strength of yours with which you smashed the posterity of Varaśikha,when from the blast of your mace when it was smashed down, from just its sound, their farthest (division) shattered, Indra.5. Indra smashed the posterity of Varaśikha, doing his best for Abhyāvartin Cāyamāna,when at the Hariyūpīyā (River) he smashed the Vr̥cīvants in the front division, and the rear (division) shattered from fear.6. O much-invoked Indra, at the Yavyāvatī (River), though they were a hundred thirty altogether and armor-clad, with a yen for fame,the Vr̥cīvants, playing the lord’s role for an arrow, breaking their own “pots,” came to failed ends.7. He for whom the two ruddy cows [=rivers?], seeking good pasturage, acted the go-between as they licked each other again and again,he handed Turvaśa and the Vr̥cīvants over to Sr̥ñjaya, doing his best for the son of Devavāta.8.

The hymn was later used as a blessing for cows as they return home, but it may originally have been intended to bless the cows given as a dakṣiṇā (priestly gift) as they enter the home of their new owner. According to the Vaitāna Śrauta Sūtra 21.24, the sacrificer awaited the cows intended for the dakṣiṇā with the hymn Atharvaveda IV.21 (=R̥V VI.28.1–7). It is worth noting that almost the last word of the preceding hymn (VI.27.8d) is dákṣiṇā, and this may have invited the placement of this hymn here.The safety of the cows of the pious man as they graze is the subject of much of the hymn, and the various dangers that could befall them are detailed: being stolen by a thief or in a cattle raid, getting lost, going to the slaughterhouse. They are also given rather grandiose identifications in verse 5, including with Indra: 5c is a clear echo, almost to parody, of the famous hymn II.12 with its refrain: “he, o peoples, is Indra.”The final verse is in a different meter, and as it is not part of the Atharvaveda version of this hymn, it was probably originally separate. In form it is a magical exhortation and makes use of the only slightly euphemistic verb upa-√pr̥c “mix sexually.” The verse obviously expresses the wish that the cows become impreg-nated, and thus picks up the adjective “bearing offspring” in verses 2 and 7. The use of the near deictic “right here” modifying “the inseminator” suggests that the performance of the spell has a physical component in addition to the verbal, as is regularly found in the Atharvaveda.1. The cows have come here and have made (the house) blessed. Let them find a place in the cow-stall; let them find enjoyment among us.Here should those of many colors be, bearing offspring, as through many dawns they give milk for Indra.2. Indra does his best for the man who sacrifices and delivers in full. He gives more; he does not steal what belongs to him.Making wealth increase more and more just for him, he establishes the man devoted to the gods in undivided virgin land.3. These will not be lost, and no thief will take them by deception. No enemy will venture against their meandering course.Those (cows) with which he sacrifices and gives to the gods, he keeps company with them as their cowherd for a very long time.4.

In verse 2 it is Indra’s own powers that are attached to him, or rather to his hand (see also the mace in hand in vs. 1), but in the following two verses ritual elements offered by men are the attachments. Since the final verse (6) is a summary verse, introduced as often by evā́ “in this way,” verses 2–4 constitute an omphalos defined by the attachment theme. Interestingly, the only one of Indra’s great deeds mentioned in this hymn is his forceful separation of heaven and earth (vs. 5b), which provides a conceptual opposite to the attach-ment elsewhere.The larger concern of the hymn is the reciprocal relation between men, who offer Indra sacrifice and praise poetry, and Indra, who places his power in the service of men and offers them gifts. This relationship is announced in the first verse, espe-cially in the word “partnership, comradeship” in the first pāda, and is also conveyed iconically by the “attachment” of the words “Indra” and “men,” which occur next to each other initial in the opening pāda of the hymn, and again in 4c (índraṃ [vo] na﻿́raḥ). The relationship between the god and his worshipers is here modeled on that between the poet-sacrificer and his patron. Indra is in fact called a “patron” in verse 5 and described as providing the priestly gift (dakṣiṇā) in verse 3, which is the task and prerogative of a patron."},{"pageNumber":831,"pageContent":"VI.308141.

To which hand manly powers are firmly attached, (as) a chariot driver is to his golden chariot,(as) reins are to the two brawny fists, (as) bullish horses yoked together are to the road.3. For your glory do our friendly services firmly attach themselves to your two feet [=do homage]. As the bold mace-bearer, (you) provide the priestly gift;wearing a fragrant cloak, (lovely) to be seen like the sun, you have become vigorous, o dancer.4. (But) the pressed soma has become the most firmly attached (to him), in whose (presence) the cooked food is cooked and there are roasted grains,while the men who create the sacred formulations are praising Indra and reciting their hymns as the men most cherished by the gods.5. No limit has been set for this vast power of yours. He forced apart the two world-halves with his greatness.With his help our patron [=Indra] brings these things to fulfillment as he keeps thrusting, as if driving his herds together to the waters.6. Just in this way let lofty Indra be easily called—the warrior with golden lips, with his help that needs no help,for in this way was he born with unequalled, surpassing might. He will strike down many obstacles [/Vr̥tras] and Dasyus.VI.30 (471) IndraBharadvāja Bārhaspatya5 verses: triṣṭubhThis hymn is entirely a celebration of Indra’s cosmogonic and cosmos-maintaining deeds and powers. The only possible indications of a human dimension in the hymn are the oblique reference to the soma sacrifice in the first pāda of the hymn, the granting of good things in the second pāda, and the ruminative “I think” at the beginning of the second verse. The pace of the hymn is brisk, but this straightfor-ward recital of the high points of Indra’s career has a pleasing balance and variety in its expressions.1. He has been strengthened even more for the heroic deed; he alone, the unaging, apportions good things."},{"pageNumber":832,"pageContent":"VI.31815Indra projects beyond heaven and earth: the two worlds are equivalent to just half of him.2. Therefore I think his lordly power to be lofty. Those things that he upholds, no one alters.Day after day the sun becomes visible. The strong-willed one distributed the seats widely.3. Even today, even now, this is the labor of the rivers, since you dug out a way for them, Indra.The mountains settled down like (flies) settling on food. By you were the airy realms fixed fast, o you of strong will.4. This is really true: there exists no other like you.

You (sent) forth the waters, (opened) wide the doors in every direction.

The final verse exhorts Indra to perform the same martial services for us.The most interesting verse is the first, where at first glance the logical connec-tions among the three clauses are not clear. But the contrast between the singleness and unification of the first half of the verse and the division in the second seems to be the point. Indra is the single lord of wealth because he can gather all peoples just in his two hands—peoples who were otherwise disunited and quarreling over the various goods of existence. Indra’s act of unification in this verse seems to be a kind of wishful thinking on the poet’s part, however, for the battles depicted in verses 3 and 4 are the result of disunity, and in verse 5 we call on Indra for aid in the same sorts of disputations found in 1cd. The “separate peoples” (carṣaṇí) of verse 1 also return in verse 5; the poet wishes to see them as a sort of universal audience for the fame of himself and his people, brought about by Indra’s intervention on their behalf.1. You, o wealth-lord, have become the single (lord) of wealth: you have taken (all) the communities in your hands, Indra."},{"pageNumber":833,"pageContent":"VI.32816The separate peoples, disputants, were disputing with each other over progeny and posterity, the waters, and the sun.2.

You, Indra—fight along with Kutsa against the insatiable Śuṣṇa, the demon of bad harvest, in the quest for cattle,and against his ten before the (ritual) mealtime. Then you steal the wheel of the sun. You have toiled at your labors.4. You smashed down hundreds of impregnable fortresses of the Dasyu Śambara,when, able one, with your ability you did your best for Divodāsa the presser and for Bharadvāja the singer, for (them to obtain) goods, o you who can be bought with the pressing.5.

The remaining verses, each of which begins with the pronoun sá “he,” constitute the praise the poet announced in verse 1. Verses 2–3 refer to the Vala myth, with special attention paid to Indra’s companions in this enterprise, the unnamed Aṅgirases, and verse 5 may be an oblique account of the aftermath of the Vr̥tra slaying. In verse 4 Indra is exhorted to grant the singer pow-ers and riches.1. For him I have fashioned with my mouth these words, unprecedented, best of many, most wealful—for the great hero, powerful and precipitous,conferring abundance, bearing the mace, stalwart.2.

He, the doer of many deeds, triumphed every time when cattle were at stake, in company with the conveyors (of songs), the versifiers with their knees fixed.Acting as comrade along with his comrades, the smasher of fortresses broke the firmly fixed fortresses, being a poet along with poets.4.

He, launched in a surge with power along with his coursers, Indra, overcoming the precipitous, (sent) the waters (surging) to the right.Sent surging in just that way, without turning aside, day after day (the waters) have toiled at their purpose, not to be neglected.VI.33 (474) IndraŚunahotra Bhāradvāja5 verses: triṣṭubhA martial hymn. The poet reminds Indra that he will receive entreaties for help from all sides in the combat (vs. 2, using language almost identical to that in nearby VI.31.1), but begs him to help our side alone, in battles and in contests. The poetry is for the most part quite straightforward, except for the enigmatic expression in verse 3 (probably not coincidentally the middle verse), in which Indra’s weapons against formidable enemies appear to be “well-placed cloaks.” This expression has been much discussed, and a number of scholars have opted to emend it. But it likely refers to Indra’s penchant for shape-shifting disguises in combat. Moreover, the word “well-placed” (súdhita) is phonologically close to a word for “hatchet” (svádhiti), and this pun may well be lurking in the simile about trees.1. What is the most mighty, o Indra, give that to us: your (battle-)ecstasy, very superior and rich in gifts, o bull,which, possessing good horses, will win a mass of good horses and will defeat obstacles and enemies in battles.2. For the separate peoples, disputants, call (separately) on you for help at the contest of champions.You dispersed the niggards through (the inspiration of) the inspired poets, and it is just through your aid that the charger is the winner of the prize.3. You, o champion, smite both kinds of enemies, the Dāsa and the Ārya obstacles,like trees (with hatchets), with your well-placed cloaks. Break (them) apart in the battles, o most manly of men."},{"pageNumber":835,"pageContent":"VI.348184. You, Indra—by your unstinting help become our lifelong companion and helper for our strengthening,when, in the winning of the sun, we call upon you as we fight, facing the other side in battles, o champion.5.

Be there for us in mercy and in superiority.Singing in just this way, might we be under the protection of the great one and on the decisive day be the best winners of cattle.VI.34 (475) IndraŚunahotra Bhāradvāja5 verses: triṣṭubhThe first verse of this hymn is a remarkably condensed expression of the poetic economy: Indra is both the recipient of praise songs and the source of inspira-tion for those poetic thoughts. Moreover, all poets, past and present, vie to attract Indra’s attention, each with his own poem. The rest of the hymn develops these thoughts. Verses 2–3 continue the theme of multiple poets focusing on a single object, Indra, and then provide a transition to the final two verses (4–5), which celebrate the benefits that Indra receives from praise and sacrifice in a manner that indicates that our praise and sacrifice are happening now.1. Many songs have converged on you, Indra, and out from you go inspired thoughts far and wide.Previously and now, the seers’ songs of praise, their recitations and hymns, have contended over Indra.2. The skillful one, who is called upon by many and welcomed by many, who alone is celebrated by many with sacrifices—like a chariot yoked for great power, Indra is to be cheered on.3. Indra, whom neither insightful thoughts nor voices harm; they just approach him, making him strong.When a hundred, when a thousand praisers sing to him who longs for song, that is weal for him.4.

We consider it a reference to the Vala myth (as is clear at least in the mention of the Aṅgirases in d and also probably of the doors in b): the poet hopes that the mythic opening of the Vala cave and the good things that emerged from it will serve as a model for Indra’s wished-for bounties now. The “com-munity” is probably both the poet’s own people and the Aṅgirases as comrades of Indra.1. When will the sacred formulations find their resting place in the chariot? When will you give to the praiser what will prosper a thousandfold?When will you clothe his praise song with wealth? When will you make his insights have prizes as jewels?2.

The fallow bays of verse 1 are Indra’s familiar horses, bringing his chariot to the sacri-fice, but the same word (ha﻿́rayaḥ) in verse 2 refers to the tawny soma drops. In verse 3 we return to the real horses, qualified as “charging straight on,” just like the soma in the previous verse. The mention of Vāyu in verse 3 identifies the ritual in question as the Morning Pressing.The remaining two verses of the hymn (4–5) do not continue the journey theme. Instead Indra is configured as a (divine) patron (vs. 5), who gives the priestly gift to the (human) patrons (vs. 4).

In verse 1 Agni seems to carry the invocation heavenward; in the second the invocation turns Indra here. The strength Indra will derive from both praise and sacrifice occupy the next two verses (3–4), and the final verse summarizes our attempts to attract him and the benefits he will provide us.Especially in the first two verses the poet is coy about reference, and the audience must guess the subjects of the verbs and the referents of the pronouns until the last pāda of verse 2.1. He [=Agni?] has drunk from here; the most glittering one will carry up our great, heaven-bright invocation to Indra.On his journey he of good gifts will win a more admirable insightful thought as present for the divine folk."},{"pageNumber":839,"pageContent":"VI.398222.

The subject of the hymn is really soma, but the word “soma” does not appear in it, and in the middle verses of the hymn, which are insistently about soma, the poet intentionally mis-leads us about the referent.In verse 1 a long series of adjectives in the genitive describing an unidentified being is resolved by the verb “you have drunk”—the subject is Indra, and the genitive ref-erent must be soma. The three middle verses (2–4) form an omphalos defined by the repeated near deictic “this one here.” This pronoun should have a referent in the immediate vicinity of the poet, but the first of these verses concerns what is clearly the Vala myth, which invites the audience to supply Indra as the subject. It is only as the sequence unfolds (and especially with the specification of “this one” as a “drop” in vs. 3) that it becomes clear that soma is taking the role of Indra is these verses.For a similar covert coding of soma, there by the use of the genitive pronoun asya “of it, of this one” see VI.27.1–2.1.

However, it is chronologically backward. The first two verses urge Indra to drink, the first opening with a peremptory command, “Indra, drink!” The next two verses (3–4) command Indra to “drive here,” the logically prior action. Only in the last verse do the two actions occur together, in the temporally appropri-ate order. The imperative “drink!” (píba) found as the second word in the hymn is matched in the last pāda of the hymn by another imperative “take a drink” (pāhi), likewise second in its pāda, both verbs formed to the same root but in the present and aorist systems respectively.Note also the reciprocal expressions in the final pādas of verses 1 and 4: in verse 1 it is Indra who will create vitality for the singer and the sacrifice; in verse 4 by contrast the sacrifice creates vitality for Indra.The final word of the hymn, “with the Maruts,” establishes the Midday Pressing as the ritual in question. The Maruts are also obliquely referred to in the first verse, in the phrase “amid your troop.”1. Indra, drink! It is pressed for you for your exhilaration.

The usual “drive” theme is also present (vss. 1, 4, 5), but backgrounded. The emphasis is on the attractions of the particular soma offered. Only in the last pāda of the last verse does the poet ask Indra for something in return.1. Free of anger, drive here to the sacrifice. For you do the pressed soma drops purify themselves.Like cows toward their own home, o mace-bearer, come here, Indra, as the first of those worthy of the sacrifice.2.

Rather, Indra is in the 3rd person throughout, and commands are issued to a single individual (vss. 1, 4) and to a group (vss. 2–3), to serve Indra. None of the addressees is identified until verse 4, with its vocative addressing the Adhvaryu. He is likely therefore also to be the addressee in verse 1; presumably the priests as a whole are addressed by the plural imperatives in the internal verses.In this otherwise ritually focused hymn, the very specific anxiety expressed in the last half-verse comes as some surprise, a surprise mirrored in the meter, with the 12/8 half-verse contrasting with the 8/8 structure that has prevailed throughout. This wondering question about Indra’s possible aid against the boastful slanderer functionally fills the usual hymn-final slot of direct plea to the god for help, despite its indirection.1. Present (it) to him who desires to drink, who knows all things,to the superior man who comes fittingly, who comes regularly, who does not lag behind.2. Go toward him, the best of the soma-drinkers, with the soma juices,to Indra possessing the silvery drink, with tankards, with the pressed drops.3.

As often, the pattern set in the rest of the hymn is modified but not entirely broken in the final verse: verses 1–3 contain the syntagm yásya . . . máda- “(in) whose exhilaration,” while the final verse substi-tutes the participle mandāná “finding exhilaration” for the etymologically related noun máda, and also inserts a part of the soma plant, its stalk, on which the relative pronoun is dependent.1.

Several of the tr̥cas are rhetorically unified: 1–3 with its repeated second half-verse following a definitional relative clause; 19–21 with its insistent “bull” theme; 22–24 with its repeated half-verse-initial “this one here” (ayám) referring to soma. The others have less obvious internal unity, though there is often a continuity of theme or subject. There is also no visible external unity among the tr̥cas collected in this “hymn,” though it seldom strays far from Indra and the soma-drinking, the topic of many of the immediately preceding hymns.

Given its position in the Indra cycle, it is unlikely to have been originally a single hymn, but there are some themes that keep recurring throughout the hymn, such as the comparison of Indra with a cow or calf (vss. 7, 22, 25–26, 28), the sacred formulation as a vehicle for Indra (vss. 4, 7, 19), and the stake that is set as a prize in a contest (vss. 2, 11–13, 15).

Nonetheless, the hymn seems to be a conceptual unity, rather than a collection of independent pragāthas.The hymn concentrates on Indra as the helper of his praisers in contests and in battles. He is exhorted to come to our aid, to provide us with protection, to bring"},{"pageNumber":849,"pageContent":"VI.46832us the power inhering in rival peoples (see especially vss. 7–8), and to help us defeat our foes. The hymn is without major complications, and the theme is more repeated than developed. This regular repetition gives the hymn an unhurried pace, which contrasts with the urgency of the contests and battles described. This pace begins to quicken in the last verses: the repeated phrase introducing an imperative, “So then, as ever” (vss. 10, 11, 12), seems to be building to a finale. But the last pragātha (vss. 13–14), rather than providing the expected climactic plea to Indra for aid that would end the hymn conventionally, is instead a two-verse subordinate clause about Indra and his racing horses that utterly lacks a main clause, and it displays a den-sity of imagery, with unrelated similes piled up pell-mell, that seems designed to replicate the breathless pace of a real contest—a remarkable effect. At the same time, it harkens back to the beginning of the hymn, with its mention of steeds and the racecourse (see vs. 1) and the “great stakes” (see vs. 4), so that the apparently reckless speed and lack of completion of the final two verses is contained within a ring-compositional structure.1. Because it is just you that we bards call upon at the winning of the prize,you, Indra, as master of settlements that our men (call upon) amid obstacles, you at the finish lines of our steed,2.

Also like III.53, VI.47 consists of a number of smaller units, some of which seem to have little or no connection with each other. Different scholars have suggested different divisions of the hymn; our own is based in great part on arguments based on rhetoric."},{"pageNumber":851,"pageContent":"VI.47834It begins with an extravagant praise of soma (vss. 1–5), rhetorically unified by the oft-repeated pronoun “this one here” (ayám), which in several of its occurrences takes an unusual final position (as opposed to its standard initial slot). With the presence of soma unquestionably established, Indra is then invited to drink it in the following verse (6), with the ritual context explicitly identified as the Midday Pressing. In fact already toward the end of the soma verses, there has been a modu-lation toward Indra: several of the deeds attributed to “this one here” are more Indraic than Somian, especially the propping of heaven in 5cd, and the final words of verse 5 “the bull accompanied by the Maruts” would ordinarily uniquely identify Indra, who is addressed in the next pāda (6a).The extended middle section of the hymn (vss. 7–21) is entirely devoted to Indra. Verses 7–10 contain a series of direct pleas, for Indra to lead us forward to wider space and a better life and to provide refreshment and a good life. The next three verses (11–13) are similarly general, but couched in the 3rd person. (Two of these verses [12–13] are repeated in a very late hymn, X.131.6–7, and in turn are used in the later Sautrāmaṇī ritual, but we see no direct evidence of that ritual here.) Indra appears in these verses as a sort of universal protector and helper. This character-ization seems to raise questions in the poet’s mind: if Indra is the protector of all, then how does any particular group get ahead?This implicit question prompts the next, somewhat jarring, section of the hymn (vss. 14–19), which concerns the fickle and unpredictable way in which Indra’s patronage flits from one man to another. The section begins undramatically by announcing the many verbal and ritual offerings to Indra, coming (it seems) from many different groups (vs. 14), all seeking his aid. The next verse (15) seems to treat Indra’s capriciousness as a positive trait: he doesn’t only and always aid the strong, but will frequently promote a man who has fallen behind. The next two verses (16–17) continue this theme, but with Indra’s behavior appearing in a darker light, as he arbitrarily breaks his agreements and betrays his followers. In the following verse (18) Indra is infinitely multiplied, presenting a different appearance to each differ-ent group and seemingly possessed of a thousand horses, each pair of which might take him to a different group pleading for his aid. This somewhat disturbing section is brought to a happy end in verse 19: only one pair of horses is yoked (to bring Indra to us?), the various forms are under Tvaṣṭar’s control, and in the rhetorical question that forms the second half-verse (matching the question in vs. 15) it is concluded that Indra is unlikely to stay with the enemy when our own patrons are now providing such a good sacrifice. One of the most notable aspects of this little section (esp. vss. 15–18) about Indra’s constantly changing behavior is its grammati-cal reflection: these verses are packed with āmreḍita nominal compounds “each x, x after x” and so-called “intensive” verb forms (really iterative-frequentative, mean-ing “keeps x-ing, continually x-es”), forms that are relatively marked in the Vedic grammatical system. The presence of four āmreḍitas and four intensives in four verses both calls attention to the message and reflects it by portraying a regularly alternating set of actions and objects."},{"pageNumber":852,"pageContent":"VI.47835The reassurance of verse 19 has come none too soon, for in verse 20 the poet and his group find themselves in a bad spot, not the wide and bountiful place they prayed Indra to lead them to in verses 7–8. In verse 21 the opposing forces are over-come (by Indra, it seems, though he is unnamed). Thus, verses 7–8 and 20–21 form a larger ring around the Indra section.A dānastuti follows (vss. 22–25), in which the victorious kings distribute the bounty won in the battle referred to in verse 21. The dānastuti proceeds briskly and efficiently, without any of the jocularity commonly found in dānastutis elsewhere, just a list of the acquisitions.The last part of the hymn (vss. 26–31) is the strangest. It consists of three verses (26–28) addressed to the war chariot and three (29–31) addressed to the war drum. These verses are also found in the Atharvaveda (VI.125–126). Each of these martial objects is praised in the most extravagant terms and compared with the attributes of the gods. Although this section seems to have no direct connection with the rest of the hymn, it may have been attached to the hymn (or even originally composed as part of it) in response to the battle depicted in verses 20–21 and the distribution of booty in verses 22–25. Chariots are part of the gift (24a), and it would not be surprising that a war drum might be allotted as part of the post-battle distribution. It is also worth remembering that in III.53, the family hymn of the Viśvāmitras mentioned above, one of the final sections (vss. 17–20) is devoted to the possible perils besetting a chariot and its team, with phraseology similar to verses 26–28 in this hymn.1. Sweet is this one, certainly, and it is honeyed; sharp is this one, certainly, and it is full of sap.And now that Indra has drunk of it, no one at all overcomes him at the challenges.2. This sweet one here was the most exhilarating, on which Indra became exhilarated for the smashing of Vr̥tra,he who (having performed) many exploits smashed apart the nine and ninety walls of Śambara.3. This one, when it is drunk, rouses my speech; it has awakened an eager inspired thought.This wise one measured out the six broad (realms), from which no world is at a distance.4. This is the one who created the expanse of the earth; who created the height of heaven is this one here;this one (created) the beestings on the three slopes [=worlds?].

The headnote above reproduces the dedicands suggested by the Anukramaṇī, but they do not exactly fit the contents of the hymn. The first ten verses, dedicated to Agni, seem a conventional Agni hymn, the curios-ity being that it is not placed among the other Agni hymns. It is also metrically the most stable portion of the hymn, with paired pragātha verses alternating br̥hatī and satobrḥatī, save for verses 6–8, where each verse has an extra eight-syllable pāda at the end.The next three verses (11–13) offer an odd interlude: the priestly associates of the poet are ordered to drive a cow nearby, who will give milk for the Maruts. Although the Anukramaṇī identifies the Maruts as the dedicands of these verses, they seem incidental. The focus is on the cow—whether as a metaphor for Bharadvāja’s poetic inspiration, as a real cow meant to provide the milk to mix with soma in the ongoing sacrifice, or as both. This cow is reminiscent of the apparent cow in the extremely enigmatic verses of the Viśvāmitra family hymn (III.53.15–16), a hymn that occu-pies a similar place in its maṇḍala.Pūṣan is the subject of verses 14–19, the heart of the hymn. As Geldner points out, the Bharadvājas have a special relationship with Pūṣan: Maṇḍala VI contains"},{"pageNumber":856,"pageContent":"VI.48839the only series of hymns devoted to that god (VI.53–58). The first two verses of this section (14–15) present a solemn, formal praise of Pūṣan, who is compared to the great Vedic gods in his various qualities, despite his usual rustic and relatively lowly status. The two verses clearly form a pragātha, though the second of them (vs. 15) has five pādas (12 12 12 8 8) rather than the expected satobr̥hatī (12 8 12 8). After these two straightforward verses, notable only for the hyperbolic encomium of this minor divinity, there follow three verses (16–18) containing a remarkable, intimate address to Pūṣan, whispered into his ear (see 16ab), some of which, espe-cially verse 17, is close to unintelligible. The translation of that verse given here is extremely provisional; what is clear is that the style and syntax are informal, and the poet probably uses idioms and popular sayings current in colloquial speech. Moreover, since it is whispered to Pūṣan, it should be unintelligible to us. The final verse devoted to Pūṣan (19), though it remains a 2nd-person address, returns to the high, formal style of the first two (14–15) and is in br̥hatī. It should be noted that the three intimate verses have the same metrical structure as the three verses about the cow (11–13) and share with those verses a certain idiomatic register. Each con-sists of a sequence of kakubh (8 12 8: vss. 11, 16), satobr̥hatī (12 8 12 8: vss. 12, 17), and puraüṣṇih (12 8 8: vss. 13, 18).The final three verses (20–22) are dedicated to the Maruts. The first two form another pragātha (20 in the expected br̥hatī, 22 with an extra eight-syllable pāda at the end, like the extended satobr̥hatīs of vss. 6 and 8), while the final verse (22) is in anuṣṭubh. The reason for their position here is unclear. The final verse is enigmatic, as verses referring the Maruts’ mother Pr̥śni and their birth often are (cf. II.34.2 and especially nearby VI.66.1), and the hymn, having presented us with a number of puzzles along the way, ends with a final one.1.

Most verses name the god in question, though the name can be postponed till late in the verse, as in verse 2 dedicated to Agni or verse 8 to Pūṣan, whose name is the last word in the verse. Two do not name the god at all: verse 3 to Night and Dawn and verse 12 to Indra. The riddling tech-nique of postponing or omitting the name of an entity defined by the verse is of course common in R̥gvedic rhetoric, and its use in All God catalogues is especially appropriate.There is no obvious ritual or other significance to the order of gods in this hymn, though many of the parties to the Morning Pressing occur early in the hymn: Agni (vs. 2), Night and Dawn (vs. 3), Vāyu (vs. 4), Aśvins (vs. 5). On the other hand, the verse dedicated to Indra (12), a regular participant in the dawn ritual, is late in the hymn, though he is obliquely present, with the Maruts, in 6cd. No god receives more than a single verse, though, as just mentioned, Indra and the Maruts have a presence in the Parjanya and Vāta [=Thunder and Wind] verse (6), as Agni does"},{"pageNumber":859,"pageContent":"VI.49842in the Mitra and Varuṇa verse (1) and in the Tvaṣṭar verse (9). The reference shifts between the 3rd and 2nd person, with the former predominating. The final verse of the hymn, in a slightly different meter (triṣṭubh but with an extra pāda), mentions no specific gods, but asks all of them for benefits.1. I will praise the people of good commandment with newer hymns, will praise Mitra and Varuṇa the gracious.Let them come hither; let them listen here—those of good dominion, Varuṇa, Mitra, Agni.2.

The first verse establishes this messy inclusiveness, calling on Aditi, the three principal Ādityas (Varuṇa, Mitra, and Aryaman), Agni, Savitar, Bhaga, and the “rescuer gods,” who may, but need not be, the Maruts. The hymn also has a more direct and intimate feel than VI.49: although both hymns mix 2nd-person and 3rd-person reference to the gods, in VI.50 the 2nd person predominates, in contrast to VI.49, and the 2nd-person invocations in VI.50 more often contain"},{"pageNumber":861,"pageContent":"VI.50844imperatives and requests in the optative, in contrast to the generally descriptive clauses of VI.49.Another noteworthy feature is the relative prominence of female divinities. Again, the first verse sets the scene by placing Aditi first. Besides Earth, in the pair Heaven and Earth (vs. 3), we find Rodasī (vs. 5), the motherly Waters (vs. 7), Sarasvatī (vs. 12), the Wives of the Gods, associated with Tvaṣṭar (vs. 13), and Earth again (vss. 13–14). The divine ladies end the hymn (vs. 15).1.

Chant to this hero who has a yearning for songs—to Indra with a new sacred formulation, o singer.He will hear the call. While being praised and being greatly hymned, he will give rewards.7. O Waters belonging to Manu, establish unimpaired succor as luck and lifetime for our offspring and descendants.For you are the most motherly healers, the begetters of everything still and moving.8. God Savitar, who gives protection, should come hither to us—the golden-palmed one deserving the sacrifice,who, rich in gifts, like the face of Dawn discloses valuables to the pious.9.

On the basis of both structure and content, it appears that these were originally at least two separate hymns. Verses 1–12 are unitary in tone, and the central, responsive verses 6–7 can be interpreted as an omphalos, supported by various lexical rings. (Oldenberg [1888: 199–200], however, divides these twelve verses into four tr̥ca hymns.)The hymn so defined differs markedly from the last two All God hymns (VI.49–50), which catalogue a series of gods and their attributes in an unordered list. This hymn, in contrast, is highly reminiscent of the Mitra, Varuṇa, and Sūrya hymns in Maṇḍala VII (VII.60–63), in which the Sun surveys the human world and bears wit-ness to Mitra and Varuṇa about the innocence and guilt of men. Like those hymns, this begins with the rising of the sun (vss. 1–2); it then turns to praise of the Ādityas. The emphasis is on their truth and lack of deceit—Ādityan preoccupations."},{"pageNumber":863,"pageContent":"VI.51846The omphalos verses (6–7), marked by initial repeated mā́ “don’t!,” beg the gods not to subject us to undeserved punishment, thus implicitly claiming our innocence, which should be visible to the all-seeing Sun (though the final pāda of the follow-ing vs. 8 seems to allow the possibility of a modicum of guilt). The remaining five verses (8–12) return to the theme of the truthful gods, with somewhat more insis-tent prayers for grace and help. Toward the end, in verse 11, a larger group of gods is named: invocations of additional gods at the end of a hymn are very common. The last verse (12), naming the priestly family and summarizing the content and intent of the hymn that precedes it, is a typical final verse.The remaining verses (13–16) may have been appended to this hymn because they chiefly concern various malefactors whom we wish to banish or destroy, including the cheat (ripú, vs. 13) and the (clearly human) “wolf ” (vŕ̥ka, vs. 14), both of which were also mentioned as dangers in the omphalos verses (“cheat” vs. 7, “wolf ” vs. 6).1. Up goes this great eye of Mitra and of Varuṇa—dear and undeceivable.The blazing, sightly face of truth has flashed forth on its rising like the bright ornament of heaven.2.

(So also Oldenberg 1888: 199–200.) The first twelve verses divide into four tr̥cas, the first two in one meter, the second two in another. The first tr̥ca (vss. 1–3) inveighs against a rival sacrificer and calls on the Maruts and Soma to destroy him, in lively and imaginative terms. In style, though not in meter, it more closely resembles verses 13–15 of the preceding hymn VI.51 than what follows. The second tr̥ca (vss. 4–6) is more staid, but notable for calling on not only the standard deities but also on natural phenomena for aid. The remainder of the hymn is generic and somewhat repetitive, urging the gods in general to hear our calls and partake of our sacrifice.

This particular hymn begins with gentle and positive requests of the god (vss. 1–2), but quickly becomes more bloodthirsty, seeking Pūṣan’s punishment against stingy patrons. The instruments of punishment are the homely tools of Pūṣan, his awl (vss. 5–8) and goad (vs. 9). Despite the apparent viciousness of the actions urged on Pūṣan, the short lines, repeated phrases, colloquial expressions, and phonetic figures (what is trans-lated anachronistically as “shred them, make them shrapnel” in vss. 7–8 is in Sanskrit the delightful ā́ rikha kikirā́ kr̥ṇu) give a light texture and playful feeling to the hymn.1.

The last verse does contain a phonological echo of the preceding one: “brother” in verse 5 (bhrā́tā) is echoed by the last word of verse 6 (“bearing” bíbhrataḥ).It is also noteworthy for the startling, but oddly offhand and uncensorious, allu-sion to incest in verses 4–5, where Pūṣan is identified as the lover of his sister and the wooer of his mother. This follows on three verses (1–3) seeking Pūṣan as chari-oteer and giver of wealth, and after the incest verses the poet returns to the chariot motif to end the hymn (vs. 6). What the poet is alluding to is Pūṣan’s alleged mar-riage to Sūryā, Daughter of the Sun, glancingly mentioned in nearby VI.58.4 as well as in X.26.6.1. Come here!

VI.55.2); he helps the thoughts of poets reach their goal (vs. 4, cf. VI.53.4); he helps us win the prize of cattle (vs. 5, cf. VI.53.4, 10).There are several novelties in the hymn as well. The hymn begins by naming Pūṣan as “porridge-eater” in an enigmatic construction. Porridge is indeed well known from elsewhere as Pūṣan’s characteristic food (see, e.g., VI.57.2 in the next hymn), but is the last phrase of verse 1 an ominous warning, as some have taken it (Pūṣan will be insulted), or a positive indication of Pūṣan’s eagerness to respond, as others have (he doesn’t need to be invited twice, when porridge is mentioned)? We think that it is neither one; rather, “porridge eater” is such a unique designation for Pūṣan that a poet need provide no further clues to identify him.In verse 2 Indra appears as Pūṣan’s companion; this partnership is further devel-oped in the next hymn, VI.57. The third verse is the most puzzling of the hymn. Nothing further is known about this story—if it is a story—of Pūṣan, the Sun’s char-iot wheel, and the gray cow, though we suspect that it is connected with the extremely puzzling nearby verse VI.48.17, also of Pūṣan. If so, this associates Pūṣan with Indra in the tearing off of the wheel of the Sun’s chariot, a myth found in scattered pieces elsewhere. The “gray cow” may also be a naturalistic reference to a cloudy dawn twilight, with the sun rising through it. Whatever lies behind it, the image is striking.1. Whoever will designate him, Pūṣan, as “porridge-eater,”by him the god (need) not be designated (again).2. And he is the best charioteer. With him as partner and yokemate, the lord of settlements,Indra, keeps smashing obstacles.3. And yonder golden wheel of the Sunhe set down in the “gray cow”—he the best charioteer.4. What today we will say to you, much praised wondrous counselor,make that thought of ours reach its goal.5. And make this cow-seeking troop of ours reach its goal for winning.From afar, Pūṣan, you are famed.6.

In the next two verses (2–3) their contrastive attributes are used as definitional descriptors; in verse 2 Indra is the first identified, while in verse 3 the order is the opposite. The end of verse 3 and verse 4 seem to background Pūṣan while foregrounding Indra’s great deeds, but the final two verses (5–6) return them to equality, and indeed in both verses Pūṣan is mentioned first, with Indra almost an afterthought. The implied equipoise between the two gods would of course be amusing to a Vedic audience, given the sharp distinction between their importance in the pantheon.In the translation we have retained as much as possible the order of the ele-ments, even though this violates normal English patterns, because the balance between the two gods and their qualities is conveyed by their careful stationing in the verse.1. Indra and Pūṣan would we—for partnership, for well-being—call upon—for prize-winning.2. Soma has the one sat down to, to drink it pressed in the two cups.Porridge does the other one desire.3.

It pictures Pūṣan in a more cosmic context than the previous hymns and ascribes rather more powers to him. The final verse (4), probably with verse 3, refers to the apparent marriage of Pūṣan to Sūryā, daughter of the Sun, a tale alluded to in passing earlier in this cycle."},{"pageNumber":871,"pageContent":"VI.598541.

Nonetheless, eleven hymns are dedicated jointly to them. In this particular hymn, the pairing is insisted upon: every verse has a form of the dual dvandva compound “Indra-Agni.” Moreover, their kinship and joint birth is the subject of the first two verses, which, as many scholars have claimed, may be conceptually connected to the murky hymn X.124, possibly concerning the defeat of the Asuras (the Fathers of vs. 1 in this hymn?) by the Devas or gods. Elsewhere in the R̥gveda there is no evidence for a family connection between Indra and Agni.As in some other Indra-Agni hymns, Agni is assimilated to Indra at least in the early verses, since Indra has the more dynamic mythology. The standard promise to Indra to “proclaim (his) manly deeds” is made to Indra and Agni in verse 1; soma is offered to them in verses 1, 3 and 4, though it is really Indra’s drink; and they are both said to possess the mace, Indra’s weapon, in verse 3. The balance changes somewhat in verses 5–6. The two gods are separated and, though not named, are identified by their characteristics. The second hemistich of 5 refers to Agni alone, and in verse 6, after a reference to Dawn and her cows, probably alluding to the Morning Pressing where Agni is kindled and Indra appears, the second half-verse contrasts Agni (pāda c) and Indra (pāda d)."},{"pageNumber":872,"pageContent":"VI.59855This brings to an end the first division of the hymn as defined metrically, and this portion forms a satisfactory unit celebrating the gods and offering them praise and soma. The last four verses, also metrically unified, make the singer’s requests, for aid against enemies (vss. 7–8) and for wealth (vs. 9), and again invite them with praise and soma (vs. 10). Despite the metrical division, which corresponds to a functional and thematic difference, there is no reason to consider this a composite hymn, pace Oldenberg (1888: 200). It conforms to a common pattern: praise and then requests, and the shorter dimeter meter of the last four verses is appropriate to the specific requests, in contrast to the rhetorically more formal praise section in the lyric br̥hatī.1. I shall now proclaim, when (soma drinks) have been pressed for you, the manly deeds that you two have done.Slain are your fathers whose rivals were the gods, but, o Indra and Agni, you are (still) alive.2.

Our translation reflects this peculiar disjunction of vocatives. This separate address is not characteristic of the rest of the hymn, where the dual dvandva compound “Indra-Agni” (or, once, a conjoined phrase “Indra and Agni,” vs. 12) is found in nine of the remaining twelve verses, and the last tr̥ca begins with a verse (13) con-taining four occurrences of the explicit adjective “(you) both” (ubhā́).The content of the praise is generic, with a tendency toward Indraic deeds and qualities (see esp. vss. 3, 6). The second-to-last tr̥ca treats the two gods separately, without naming them: Agni in verse 10, Indra in verse 11, and a return to joint ref-erence in verse 12. The final triplet (vss. 13–15) is in three different meters, and it has been suggested that it did not originally belong to the rest of the hymn. However, notice that the return to longer lines matches the meter of the first tr̥ca, and there are also verbal responsions with the first three verses, so that a ring-compositional structure is sketched. The strong emphasis on the unified front presented by the two gods in verses 13–15 contrasts implicitly with the separate address in the first tr̥ca, and may hint that our own hymn has brought about the close cooperation between the two gods that will benefit us.1. He pierces the obstacle and wins the prize who will serve Indra and Agni, the mighty oneswho have control over abundant goods, the two most mighty with their might as they seek the victory prize.2.

The complexity of the meter corresponds roughly with the density of the thought: the first tr̥ca is rich in imagery and particularities; the follow-ing three tr̥cas are less adorned and more generic, though Sarasvatī’s riverine nature is clear, especially in the second of these tr̥cas, verses 7–9. The hymn ends with a final statement of her superiority (vs. 13) and a plea for her aid and sustenance (vs. 14).The sheer power of the river and the potential menace of her relentless flow are nicely conveyed, especially in the first tr̥ca, where she punishes a series of human foes and even destroys the mountains while rewarding her praisers. In parts of the hymn, these rewards are clearly related to her identity as river—the streambeds in verse 3, the milk we pray for in verse 14—but in others the connection is not clear, especially the gift to Vadhryaśva of (apparently) a son Divodāsa, which opens the hymns. The hostile Br̥saya of verse 3 is also unclear: the name occurs only once elsewhere in the R̥gveda (I.93.4) in similar context.1. She gave to the pious Vadhryaśva tempestuous Divodāsa who shakes the debtor,she who has wrenched away the provender from one niggard after another. These are your powerful gifts, o Sarasvatī.2.

Though the theme and sentiments are familiar, there are a number of nice touches—the enjambment across verse boundaries (1/2a; 2bcd/3a, at least in our opinion) and the play on the concepts of newer and older in verses 4–5. This section ends (5d) with the phrase, modifying the Aśvins, “providing bright gifts to the singer” (gr̥ṇate﻿́ citra﻿́rātī).The following two verses (6–7) touch on several of the Aśvins’ famous deeds, especially the rescue of Bhujyu from the sea (vs. 6), but the two verses after that (8–9) take a detour, addressing other gods and urging them to take violent action against various enemies. The poet seems so agitated that he loses his grip on gram-mar: verse 9, concerning Mitra and Varuṇa, is syntactically fragmented, shift-ing without warning or grammatical agreement between dual and singular and between 3rd and 2nd person. (We have not been able to render the full effect in English.)Though verse 10 returns us to the Aśvins’ journey and to a more tranquil gram-matical level, it too enlists the Aśvins to attack and also suggests that their journey to us was prompted by the failure of other men. The final verse gives no hint of the agitation in the immediately preceding verses and ends with the same phrase as verse 5, thus implicitly indicating the bipartite structure of the hymn.1. I shall praise the two outstanding men of this heaven; I call upon the Aśvins, singing [/awakening] with my chants—they who, at the breaking of the ruddy dawn, in a single day seek to encompass the ends of the earth and its broad expanses,"},{"pageNumber":877,"pageContent":"VI.628602.

The next two verses (5–6) enter mythological territory: the journey of Sūryā, daughter of the Sun, on the Aśvins’ chariot along with them. This mytho-logical journey returns us to the actual journey of today (vs. 7) and the hopes we have of these gods when they attend our sacrifice (vs. 8). The final two verses (9–10) are a dānastuti, naming a number of the patrons of the poet, Bharadvāja, with the single pāda of verse 11 expressing his hope for the Aśvins’ favor to both himself and his patrons at the place of sacrifice.1.

As so often, the hymn refers to the present and immediate past when Dawn has just dawned. The standard tropes are present: her wide radiance (vss. 2, 3), her ease of travel (vss. 1, 4), her feminine beauty (vs. 2), her accompanying bovines (vss. 3, 5), and especially her connection with the priestly gift distributed at the early-morning sacrifice and with wealth in general (vss. 1, 4, 5, 6). Although the hymn does not stand out for elaborate rhetorical tricks, it is characterized by pleasing imagery; see especially Dawn as archer and chariot-driver in verse 3 and the morning activities of birds and men in verse 6 (a verse found also at I.124.12).1. The shining Dawns have arisen for splendor, glistening like the waves of the waters.She makes all pathways, all passages easy to travel. She has appeared—the good priestly gift, the bounteous one.2. Auspicious, you have become visible; you radiate widely. Your flare, your radiant beams have flown up to heaven.You reveal your breast as you go in beauty, goddess Dawn, shining with all your might.3.

The structure of this hymn is more cunning than the somewhat bland VI.64, however. The poet uses identical pāda openings (4a, 4b, 4c, 5a: idā́ [hí] “[for] right now . . . ”), with insistence on the here-and-now, to modulate from the present situation and current poet to the mythological model for the dawn and the associated distribution of treasures, namely the Aṅgirases opening the Vala cave (vs. 5), which is presented as if it were happening now. As often when this myth is mentioned as a model for the singer (see, e.g., V.45), there is no mention of Indra, to whom the leadership in this deed is usually attributed. By the end of verse 5 the mythical and successful Aṅgirases have merged with the current poets, and the invocation of both is proclaimed as having come true. The connection between past and present is continued in the pleas for wealth and fame made in the last verse (6).1. This very one, the daughter born of heaven dawning for us, has awakened the human settlements,she who with her glistening radiance amid the nights has been recognized even across the nocturnal shades of darkness.2. They have driven through it with their ruddy-yoked horses; brightly shine the Dawns with their gleaming chariots.Leading the vanguard of the lofty sacrifice, they thrust aside the darkness of the night.3.

The story of the birth is introduced by a signal that it is esoteric knowledge; verse 1a announces it as a mar-vel even for someone who really perceives properly. The rest of the verse is both a paradox and a riddle: two entities have the same name, “milker,” but one of them constantly gives milk, and the other has done so only once. The riddle is solved by the last word of the verse, “udder”; the paradox juxtaposes the normal udder of a cow, which constantly swells with milk, with the udder of the Marut’s mother, Pr̥śni, who bore them, that is, milked them out, all at once. (This same phenom-enon is referred to in riddling terms in VI.48.22.) Verse 2 continues this theme, and the other parent of the Maruts, their father Rudra, is introduced in verse 3. But both 1 and 3 also allude to the androgynous behavior of the mother Pr̥śni, who elsewhere (see esp. IV.3.10) is identified as a bull who gives milk that is identical with semen; in verse 3 here she is the subject of the quintessentially male verb of impregnation (ga﻿́rbhaṃ √dhā “implant an embryo”). Verse 4 is the most opaque verse in this sequence. It clearly describes the moment of the Maruts’ birth; they did not resist being born, but in fact were milked out when they wished, after hav-ing “purified their flaws” while still within her womb. A two-word expression early in the verse (a﻿́yā nú) seems to have a double meaning: on the one hand, it is the poet’s comment about the manner of birth: “now (it happened) in this way”; on the"},{"pageNumber":882,"pageContent":"VI.66865other, it can be read as the direct speech of the Maruts (considered as a group), “Now I will go” (that is, be born), an indication of their moment of choice. The final verse of the birth story relates the fact that Pr̥śni, having given them as milk, did not give them milk after they were born, but they were undeterred. There is much that is doubtful in our translation of these verses, but the main outlines seem clear, while the tricks of the poet are much on display.Though more of his tricks appear in the rest of the hymn, none of it is as dif-ficult as these first five verses. Verse 6 turns on a pun between the word for the “two world-halves” (ro﻿́dasī) and the female who is often found as the Maruts’ lover, Rodasī́ (distinguished from the first only by accent). The marvel of their journey through the midspace is described in verse 7, and the good fortune of the man who receives their aid in verse 8. The journey of verse 7 must be to carry them to our sac-rifice, for the remaining verses bring the hymn to a fairly conventional end: in verse 9 we produce a hymn for the Maruts; in verse 10 they are compared to the ritual fire, an appropriate simile if they are situated on the ritual ground; in the final verse (10) the aim of attracting them to the sacrifice is made explicit and the competing hymns of rival sacrificers are alluded to.Unlike many Marut hymns, this one lacks any significant description of their thunderstorm-like aspects.1. Let this be a marvel even for one who (truly) perceives—(though) owning the same name “milker,”while the one stays swollen to give milk to mortals, only once did Pr̥śni milk the gleaming (milk/semen) from (the other) udder.2. Those who kept blazing up like fires being kindled, when the Maruts were strengthened two or three times over—dustless, golden were their (chariots)—they came into being all at once with their manly and male powers.3. Those who are the sons of Rudra the rewarder, and whom she was stalwart (enough) to bear—for she is known as the great mother of the great—just she, Pr̥śni, implanted the embryo for good offspring.4. Those who do not retreat from their birth: now (it happened) in this way [/(saying) “Now I will go”]—purifying their flaws while still within (their mother),they were milked forth gleaming, at their pleasure, growing in splendor all along their bodies.5. Those for whom even right away [=right after their birth] the irrepressible one [=Pr̥śni] was not there to give milk—those who, assuming the bold name “Marut,”did not (stand still) like posts, (but were themselves) irrepressible in their greatness.

By contrast, this hymn is obscure in reference and meaning, and full of rare words, unclear morpho-logical forms, contorted phraseology, puzzling imagery, and ellipses difficult to fill. Our interpretation of the hymn both in detail and in general outline differs from the many incompatible interpretations offered by other scholars (differences that we cannot discuss here), but our interpretation does produce a clear structure within which the many puzzles can be evaluated.The hymn begins straightforwardly enough, with an exhortation to the priests to offer ritual praise to Mitra and Varuṇa (vs. 1) and an invitation to the two gods"},{"pageNumber":884,"pageContent":"VI.67867to come to our ritual sacrifice (vss. 2, 3ab). This first section ends (3cd), in our view, with an elaborated version of 1ab, declaring the gods’ power to control even the rich and powerful.The ritual context returns later in the hymn (vss. 7–8), and the two ritually oriented portions frame a section relating to the birth of Mitra and Varuṇa from Aditi (vs. 4) and the powers they assumed to regulate the cosmos (vss. 5–6). The allusion to their birth recalls the lengthy birth narrative of the Maruts in the immediately preceding hymn (VI.66.1–5). With the return to the ritual situation, the two gods are first exhorted to drink the soma, whose preparation is described in enigmatic terms (vs. 7). In verse 8, again in our view, the two gods receive a summons from Agni (not named), the ritual fire through whom they will con-sume ghee, because he finds they are not there. (See the calls in the structurally matching vss. 2–3.)This absence leads to the final section of the hymn (vss. 9–11), which appears to treat the rivalry among competing sacrificers. If Mitra and Varuṇa are not at our sacrifice (vs. 8b), they must be elsewhere. The poet describes these competi-tors in extremely negative terms (vs. 9) as violating the ordinances that are the most prominent feature of Mitra and Varuṇa’s moral command. In contrast, verse 10 presents the proper ritual behavior and attitudes of our side, ending with yet another affirmation of the gods’ power to control and set in place the people (10d, reminiscent of 1cd and 3cd). And in the final verse (11) we are ourselves properly placed in the shelter of Mitra and Varuṇa (a placement first requested in vs. 2), hoping for generous gifts when the soma sacrifice is performed. The last half-verse refers, in our view, to this sacrifice: the cows are the milk mixture pursuing the straight-flying soma; the bold bull in battle-lust is also the soma. But the expressions also evoke martial images appropriate to the rivalry among sacrificers found in the preceding two verses. It is worth not-ing that the preceding hymn also made brief allusion to sacrificial rivalry in its final verse (VI.66.11).1. Of all beings the most preeminent, Mitra and Varuṇa are to be continuously strengthened by your songs.The best controllers, the two without equal, who, like reins, firmly control the peoples with their own arms.2. This inspired thought from me is spread forth for you two, (calling you) two dear ones with homage to the ritual grass.Hold forth to us, Mitra and Varuṇa, the unbesiegable shelter of yours that provides defense, o you of good drops.3. Drive hither, Mitra and Varuṇa, dear ones being called to (the ritual grass) with good recitation, with homage.You two who like industrious workers firmly (control) (even) the peoples ensconced in prosperity, you set in their place even those (who themselves say) “listen!” [=bosses], with your greatness."},{"pageNumber":885,"pageContent":"VI.688684.

The praise, such as it is, comes in the next three verses, a series of super-latives characterizing them both in verse 2, a contrastive glance at their respective functions in the second half of verse 3, and an assertion that the two are preeminent even among the other gods in verse 4. (Verse 4 is also noteworthy for the gendered description of the gods; female deities are not usually given recognition when the gods in general are mentioned.)Wealth is the target of the middle verses (5–8), wealth for priests and patrons alike. The word rayí “wealth” is prominent in all four verses.The final verses (9–11) depict the here-and-now of the sacrifice, happening in real time, as it were, signaled by an occurrence of a form of the annunciatory near-deictic pronoun (“here is/this here”) in each verse (aya﻿́m 9c, ima﻿́m 10a, ida﻿́m 11c).

The gods are repeatedly urged to come together to the sacrifice, to enjoy the various forms of praise, and to drink the soma—as well as to give us wealth in return. Only one verse (4) is devoted to the gods’ deeds, with the “wide striding” that is Viṣṇu’s best-known exploit attributed to both of them. Their unity is reinforced by the grammar. Every verse in this hymn contains a voca-tive address to the two gods, always in a dvandva compound, except for the final verse (8).In that verse, the two gods are grammatically separated though still addressed in the vocative, and this grammatical change marks a sharp change in conception as well. Though it is emphasized in the first half of the verse that both have con-quered and not been conquered, in the second half it is said that they contended with each other, but in the end divided the stake of a thousand (cows?) in thirds, with each taking a part. As Geldner points out, this dispute between Indra and Viṣṇu is referred to a number of times in early Vedic prose and later, and according to the Taittirīya Saṃhitā (VII.1.5.5) Indra received two thirds of the stake, Viṣṇu one third.

Besides these liquid endow-ments, the physical qualities of the two divinities are barely mentioned; it is instead their status as objects of worship and praise at the sacrifice and their ability to grant rewards to us that preoccupy the poet.1.

Geldner suggests that the first is a morning hymn, the second an evening hymn.The parallelism is especially clear at the beginning: the first verses of each (1, 4) begin identically: “Up this god Savitar . . . ” (úd u ṣyá deváḥ savitā́ . . . ) and fol-low with a mention of his golden arms/hands. The second verses (2, 5) are each appropriate for the time of day they represent: in the morning hymn (vs. 2) Savitar impels the creatures forth to their daily activities, while in the evening hymn (vs. 5) he brings them to rest. The third verses (3, 6) make the expected pleas for help and benefit from the god.1. Up has this god Savitar raised his two golden arms for impelling, the very resolute one.He sprinkles his hands with ghee, the young battler of good skill, in his spreading apart of the dusky realm.2.

Each of the verses recounts one or more of Indra’s cosmogonic deeds or his beneficial acts for mankind, here ascribed equally to both gods. Since Indra needs to drink soma in order to accomplish his feats, this sharing of credit is not surprising. Some of the acts are expressed in the past tense, some in the present, even those that belong to the mythical past like the smashing of the serpent (vs. 3). The language is straight-forward, even in the expression of the familiar paradox in verse 4 of the cooked milk found in the raw cows.1. Indra and Soma, great is this greatness of you two. You did the first great things:you found the sun; you found the sunlight; you smashed away all the shades of darkness—and the scorners.2.

Indeed, the gods have little in common, and the elements in this hymn that are not generic to divinity in general are applicable only to Rudra—in particular, the plea to destroy disease (vs. 2) and give healing remedies (vs. 3). The adjective “very kindly” (suśévau) in verse 4 is etymologically related to and anticipates the epithet śíva “kindly,” which later char-acterizes Rudra (already R̥V X.92.9) and ultimately replaces his name.1.

It praises the weapons of battle and their parts, and it is structured as a list of riddles. Each weapon receives one verse; some-times the weapon is named at the beginning of the verse (as in vs. 2), but more often it is found only toward the end, preceded by a riddling definition. Particularly strik-ing are the verses in which the subject is described as a seductive woman or tender mother (vss. 3–4), a characterization that contrasts sharply with the violence of battle. (Weapons so described are feminine in grammatical gender.) In the following translation the weapon that is the answer to the riddle is italicized.The hymn is more or less metrically unified for the first ten verses, and verse 10 reads like a hymn-final verse, breaking the riddle pattern to beg a collection of gods and ancestors for protection. The rest of the hymn alternates trimeter and dimeter meter, and although the riddling verses continue (vss. 11, 13–15), there is also direct address to the weapons themselves and prayers to various gods for protection. The more various character of this second part of the hymn has led some scholars to consider it an even later addition, although this does not seem a necessary conclu-sion. The final verse (19) calls down destruction on every type of enemy and affirms the primacy of the protective sacred formulation—as “inner armor,” thus paired with the outer armor (the same word várman) found in the first verse of the hymn. Thus, whether secondarily or not, the hymn has a faint ring structure.1. His mien is like that of a thundercloud, when he drives armored into the lap of battles.With an unpierceable body, conquer! Let the greatness of your armor carry you through.2. With the bow may we win cattle, with the bow the contest, with the bow may we win the sharp battles.The bow banishes the (battle-)lust of our rival. With the bow may we win all the quarters.3.

According to the Anukramaṇī two hymns were composed either by Vasiṣṭha or by Kumāra Āgneya (101, 102), and two hymns were joint com-positions of Vasiṣṭha and his sons (32, 33). In 32, however, it assigns one pāda, or at most one and a half verses, to Śakti Vāsiṣṭha, and the rest of the hymn is by his father. The Anukramaṇī unequivocally attributes all the other one hundred hymns of the maṇḍala to Vasiṣṭha alone.This attribution of all these hymns to a single poet is historically unlikely. Perhaps many of the poems were composed by Vasiṣṭha, but unlike the other family poets, the Vasiṣṭha poets apparently developed a tradition of crediting their work to their illustrious ancestor. Because of this focus on him, Vasiṣṭha emerges as a distinct literary figure in the maṇḍala. He is mentioned—or mentions himself—twenty-four times in VII, and he appears as a model ritualist also in hymns from later maṇḍalas, for example, X.150.5, X.181.1, both attributed to his descendants, and X.65.15. Not only is he a distinct figure in the R̥gveda, he also has a distinct literary person-ality. For the construction of a poetic persona, see Jamison (2007: esp. chap. 1, and the following chapters) for a discussion of Vasiṣṭha.Maṇḍala VII also has a distinctive distribution of hymns. It includes nine hymns dedicated, either wholly or in part, to the Ādityas or to Mitra and Varuṇa, four hymns to Indra and Varuṇa, and four hymns to Varuṇa alone. The significant role that the Ādityas and particularly Varuṇa play in VII perhaps reflects a family connection to these gods, which also figures in the tradition that Vasiṣṭha was the son of Mitra and Varuṇa. The personality of Vasiṣṭha is defined most strongly in the four hymns to Varuṇa (VII.86–89). They describe an intimate relationship between the poet and the god, in which the poet fears the god’s displeasure but hopes for his mercy and his guidance, while recalling their previous friendship.The maṇḍala also contains the R̥gveda’s longest continuous series of hymns to the Aśvins (67–74) and to Dawn (75–81), although the hymns of neither collec-tion show the originality of the Varuṇa hymns. There are a number of noteworthy individual hymns. Among the most significant is VII.18, depicting the so-called "},{"pageNumber":897,"pageContent":"VII.1880Battle of the Ten Kings, which may reflect actual events, although with what accu-racy it is hard to say. In distinctly triumphalist language, it tells how King Sudās and the Bharatas were victorious over an alliance of ten kings ranged against him. This battle may have been historically important if it marked the dominance of the Bharatas over other Vedic tribes and significant movement toward a political consolidation of the Vedic peoples. Closely connected with VII.18 is VII.33, attrib-uted partly to Vasiṣṭha himself and partly to his sons. The hymn affirms the role of Vasiṣṭha in securing Indra’s critical help in Sudās’s victory over the ten kings and concludes with his sons’ story of the birth of Vasiṣṭha. Another quite remarkable hymn, although in a very different vein, is VII.103, the Frog Hymn, in which the poet compares the action and croaking of frogs to the ritual acts and recitations of priests. The hymn was likely composed for the beginning of the rainy season and with the purpose of spurring the fertility appropriate to the season. Equally unusual and delightful is the sleep charm (VII.55).The Vasiṣṭha clan refrain, “Do you protect us always with your blessings,” occu-pies the final pāda of most of the triṣṭubh hymns in this maṇḍala.VII.1 (517) AgniVasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi25 verses: virāj 1–18, triṣṭubh 19–25This hymn contains a double ending. The first is at verse 20, which concludes with the signature pāda of the Vasiṣṭhas in 20d and which is marked by a shift to triṣṭubh meter in verses 19–20. The hymn continues in triṣṭubh to verse 25, which repeats verse 20. Oldenberg suggests that there is a deliberate attempt to make this hymn parallel to VII.34, the first of the hymns to All Gods, which also has twenty-five verses. The two parts of the hymn, verses 1–20 and 21–25, are thematically similar since both are concerned with the life and lineage of the householder, although the second part places particular emphasis on Agni as the sacrificial fire and the bless-ings that he can bring.The hymn describes the kindling of Agni in the house so that the household fire will guard its prosperity and help it flourish. Agni will be the leader of the household (vs. 3) and the fire of the sacrifice (vs. 16). In particular, the householder desires sons and other males in his extended family, who will bring prosperity to the home and guarantee the householder’s continued lineage. These are the vīrā́ḥ “men, heroes” (vss. 5, 11, 15, 19, 24), an abundance of whom the poet desires and the lack of whom he fears (19). The poet also mentions the náraḥ “men” or “fine men” (vss. 1, 4, 9, 10, 11), who in the first three of these verses are described as ritually serving Agni. That function is typical of náraḥ, who elsewhere in the R̥gveda are often priests. Here the vīrā́ḥ and náraḥ do not appear to be different people, however, since they are described in similar terms. So the na﻿́raḥ in 4c and the vīrā́ḥ in 15c are"},{"pageNumber":898,"pageContent":"VII.1881both “well born,” and the poet asks that the householder never suffer from the lack of either (11a and 19a).The poet repeats the word nítya in reference to Agni as “our own” or “their own” (vss. 2, 12) and to “his own” offerings (vs. 17) and “our own” lineage (vs. 21). He also repeats svá, which has a similar sense, with reference to “our own” devotion (vs. 6) and the householder’s “own” kin (vs. 12). Through their repetition and meaning, the two words form a nexus between Agni and the householder, which connects the kindling and tending of the fire to the longevity of the householder’s family. Likewise in verse 17, as Geldner notes, the circumambulation of the Hotar with the fire around the fire-place is described as the procession of a bride and groom around the fire at a wedding. The imagery of the wedding affirms that Agni is now a member of the family of the householder.More generally, the poet creates a close connection between Agni and humans by allowing either one to be the subject of verse 23cd and either one to be the object. That is, either the god Agni allows the priest to obtain goods from the gods and the patronage of a sacrificer, or the priest makes it possible for Agni to obtain goods for mortals and to become accessible to the patrons of the sacrifice.1.

In verse 2cd the gods who sweeten the offer-ings are probably the assembly of the deities and divine objects who are invoked in the hymn. Two similes complicate the second half of verse 5. The priests open the doors so that the chariot, probably the sacrifice itself, can pass into the realm of the gods. In 5cd with their oblations of ghee the priests anoint the many doors that lead to the gods. In pāda c the doors are compared to cows licking a calf. We have sug-gested that the “divine chariot,” the sacrifice, corresponds to the calf and that the ghee-offerings at the Prayājas, the “fore-offerings,” are the “licks.” It is not entirely clear why the doors are compared to unmarried girls in pāda d. The ritual situation to which the verse refers, however, is explained by I.124.8, which describes anointed brides-to-be who about to choose a husband (vrā́) at the assemblies (sa﻿́mana) that include prospective grooms. The two similes are united by the representation of the dúraḥ, which are grammatically feminine, as females: mothers and brides. And finally, rather unusually, verse 7 identifies the two divine Hotars, who are not actu-ally named, each as Agni Jātavedas. The phrasing suggests that this verse may be a reversal of V.9.1–2. In V.9.1c the poet says ma﻿́nye tvā jāta﻿́vedasam “I think you"},{"pageNumber":901,"pageContent":"VII.2884[=Agni] to be Jātavedas,” and then in 2a, he calls Agni a Hotar. Alternatively, the form jāta﻿́vedasā could be an elliptical dual, as Geldner suggests, in which one of the pair is Agni Jātavedas and the other the “inspired praise poet.”The conclusion of the hymn, verses 8–11, is identical to III.4.8–11, so either the Viśvāmitra Āprī hymn has borrowed from this Vasiṣṭha hymn or vice versa. Presumably the first part of the hymn was enough to make each of the two hymns sufficiently unique to its gotra.1. Today find pleasure in our kindling wood, Agni.

The last verse, which con-tains the poet’s requests for blessings concluding with the usual Vasiṣṭha signature line, thus stands outside of hymn’s principal development.The hymn describes the emergence of fire from the friction sticks that give birth to it. Agni breaks free of these fire-churning sticks as he is fanned into flame (vs. 2). He then appears as a new-born, who never grows old (vs. 3). His flames rapidly advance over the wood (vs. 4), and then, in the middle verse of this principal section, he becomes the recipient of offerings (vs. 5). The descriptions of the fire after that point reflect its intensification through the offerings covered with ghee (vss. 6–7). The “strongholds” in verse 7 and in verse 8 (if this is how the ellipsis in that verse is to be completed) refer to Agni’s now brightly shining flames. Their brilliance cuts through space, protecting the sacrificer and opening a way for the songs to reach the gods.The hymn is notable especially for its skillful use of simile, especially in the first half of the hymn. The poet compares Agni to a horse (vs. 2), a weapon (vs. 4), a stallion (vs. 5), and a jewel (vs. 6), and he calls Agni a bull (vs. 3). In each case the same verb describes the action of the fire and of the object to which it is compared. So, for example, in verse 2 Agni and the horse both “snort” and both “stand free”—Agni of the fire-churning wood and the horse of its corral. In verse 5 the fire and a stallion are both “groomed,” and in verse 6 both fire and a jewel “glow.” In 4d we may have an exception to this pattern. In this case, the verb is vivekṣi which should be from √viṣ “toil at,” and we reflect that analysis in our translation. But there is a pun, for vivekṣi can formally be derived from √vic “sift,” an action that would apply to the barley in the simile. That is to say, whereas the same action applies to the simile and the frame in the previous examples, here the same verb form but not in the same meaning applies to the wood and the barley."},{"pageNumber":903,"pageContent":"VII.38861. Make the god Agni along with the fires your best sacrificing messenger in the rite—he who is firmly established among mortals and possessing the truth, the pure one with burning head, with ghee as his food.2.

This is a wish found already in VII.1, but it is even more strongly articulated here. The best evidence for this interpretation is verses 7–8, which describe the importance of a son of one’s own. Nonetheless, in our view, the subject of this hymn is more likely Agni than a son, and its concern is with a fire that has not come or is just coming to birth. The poet wants a fire of his own, which will bring wealth to him and preserve his life. To be sure, the hymn does contain an implicit analogy between Agni and a son, who likewise brings wealth and preserves the family.One of the features of this hymn is the repetition of a word or of related words in successive lines or verses: jagr̥bhre﻿́ (3b) and gŕ̥bham (3c); uvo﻿́ca (3c) and duro﻿́kam (3d); agnír amŕ̥taḥ (4b), agnír amŕ̥tān (5b), and agnír amŕ̥tasya (6a); pa﻿́ri ṣadāma (6d) and pariṣa﻿́dyam (7a); and a﻿́raṇasya (7a) and áraṇaḥ (8a). Other repetitions occur at a greater distance. Thus verse 8, the third from the last verse, has gra﻿́bhāya (8a) and o﻿́kaḥ (8c), echoing the repetitions within verse 3. This technique does not occur in the first, introductory verse, nor in the last two verses, which are also VI.15.12 and VII.3.10 respectively and which may have been borrowed from these hymns. These verbal repetitions are a challenge to translate, particularly because in some cases the poet uses the words in different senses. So, for example, amŕ̥ta refers to the “immor-tal” gods in verse 5 but to “living” human beings in verse 6. In verse 6 pa﻿́ri √sad describes the sacrificers “sitting around” the fire, but in verse 7 it probably refers to sequestering something or keeping it separate by drawing a notional circle around it.1. Bring forth your offering and your thought, well-purified, to the flaming ray of light, to Agni,who with wisdom goes among all races, the divine ones and those descended from Manu.2.

He completely eats his food all at once, even though it be abundant.3.

More spe-cifically, Agni is a tribal fire, which here represents an aggregation of clans in the Pūru tribe (vs. 3). This hymn thus accords with VII.19.3, in which Indra also sup-ports the Pūru tribe, but contrasts with VII.18.13, in which Indra supports Sudās, the enemy of the Pūru. As Proferes (2007: 46–49) details, it is as a tribal fire and as the sun that Agni is called Vaiśvānara, a name repeated in each of the first five verses and then again in the last two (8–9).The hymn begins with a statement of Agni’s presence in heaven and on earth, nurtured by both the gods and priests (vs. 1). In the second verse Agni is called the master of both flowing and pooling waters, a theme echoed in verse 8, the second to last verse, in which Agni is asked to send the “refreshing drink,” which might be the rain for humans or the soma for the gods or both. Having descended"},{"pageNumber":906,"pageContent":"VII.5889to earth, Agni’s radiance extends to the Ārya clans (vs. 2cd). In verse 3 the víśaḥ. . . aśiknī ḥ “dark clans” are Dasyus (vs. 6), but they are not dark because they are “dark-skinned,” as the description is often interpreted, but rather because they represent powers of darkness opposed to the Āryas (cf. Hock 1999). Note that the brilliance of Agni in 3cd breaks apart the “dark clans” and, as light, disperses darkness. Or likewise in verse 6 Agni drives away the Dasyus, providing a “broad light” for Āryas. As fire and sun, Agni extends his light throughout the worlds (vs. 4). In verse 5, the middle verse of the hymn, the poet concretizes Agni as the present sacrificial fire, who guards and prospers the different communities and as both the sacrificial fire and the sun, both of which appear in the early morning as beacons of the day.1. Bring forth a song to the mighty Agni, to the spoked wheel of heaven and earth,who as Vaiśvānara has grown strong in the lap of all the immortals through the watchful (priests).2.

In 1ab Agni is called a “universal king and lord” to be honored “by the settlements.” This description recalls Varuṇa and his rule over settled communities. Then in the second hemistich Agni’s acts are explicitly compared to the heroic deeds of Indra during war. The description of Agni as the “breaker”—if that is the meaning of dārú in 1d—is appropriate to him: in X.69.3d the poet asks of Agni sa﻿́ vā́jaṃ darṣi “Break out victory’s prize.” But the word also anticipates puraṃdara﻿́ “breaker of strong-holds” in 2c, here an epithet of Agni but normally one of Indra. In 2cd the two gods, Indra and Varuṇa, are combined in Agni through the description of him as puraṃdará and through reference to his vratá “commandment,” a term that is con-ceptually and etymologically connected to Varuṇa. But then in verse 3 Agni takes on the persona of Indra more exclusively as one who pursues the Paṇis, who are the great enemies of Indra in his destruction of the Vala cave. The reference to Agni as the one who brings the dawn in verses 4–5 is appropriate to the fire of the morning sacrifice, but it also continues the reference to the Vala story, telling of the release of the dawns. In verse 5cd Nahuṣ is the ancestor of the Nahuṣa, a tribe of whom Agni takes possession. In I.31.11 Agni is the clanlord of the Nahuṣa, but it is still not clear why they are mentioned here, although doing so does bring Agni’s action down to earth and perhaps into the present. The last two verses give Agni posses-sion of the whole earth, including the goods and peoples on it.1. (I proclaim) the praise of the universal king and lord, of the man to be celebrated by the settlements.Extolling the deeds of the mighty one—I extol the breaker—I proclaim them like those of Indra.2. They urge on the poet and beacon (of the sacrifice), the wellspring and light beam from the stone, the luck and rule of the two world-halves.By my songs, I seek to gain the ancient and great commandments of Agni the breaker of strongholds.3.

Within this recursive frame the poet follows the descent of Agni from the heaven onto the earth. In 1d Agni runs at “a measured pace” and is found “among the gods in his own person,” that is, in the form of the burning sun. He is then invited to journey to earth (vs. 2) and to the sacrificial place as a participant in the rite (vs. 3). Still, Agni remains simultaneously earthly and heavenly. His “two mothers” or “mother and father” in 3c are Earth and Heaven, but they can also be the two fire-churning sticks, the ara﻿́ṇī̆. In verse 4 Agni’s birth is set squarely on earth and at the sacrifice, where he assumes his role as chief priest of the rite (vss. 4–5). Verse 6 presents an interesting problem since it is not clear who is spoken about. In our view the subject is most likely the gods, to whom the poet now returns at the end of the hymn, thus balancing the reference to them in verses 1–2. But pādas a and cd can also describe the patrons of the sacrifice and b can parenthetically refer to the priests, as Geldner suggests. This ambiguity is likely intentional, allowing a double reference to gods and humans.1.

These surpass everything through their heavenly brilliance—the manly ones who fashioned the solemn utterance and its desirable reward,who, heeding them, extend the clans and who will reflect upon this, my truth.7. And now we Vasiṣṭhas beseech you, the master of good things, o Agni, son of strength.You have obtained refreshment for the singers of praise and for our generous (patrons). – Do you protect us always with your blessings.VII.8 (524) AgniVasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi7 verses: triṣṭubhCommenting on verse 4, Proferes (2007: 37) rightly says that this Agni, the fire of the Bharatas, is linked to the military power of the tribe, and it is he, not the king or the warriors, who is credited for the victory over the enemy tribe of the Pūrus. There are hints of the extent of Agni’s power to repel the Pūrus in the repetition of ví “afar” in verses 2, 3, and 4. Likewise, the poet describes how Agni, the son of strength (vs. 7), becomes mighty (vs. 2) and makes his body strong (vs. 5). In an interesting twist, Agni’s bodily strength, which is marked by his brightness, will drive human bodily illness into darkness (vs. 6)."},{"pageNumber":910,"pageContent":"VII.98931.

The exchange between sacrificers and gods is reasserted at the end of the penultimate verse (vs. 5cd), which urges Agni to sacrifice to the gods in order that they will benefit humans. The theme of exchange is continued in verse 2a, since"},{"pageNumber":911,"pageContent":"VII.9894Agni’s “strong resolve” is to sacrifice, and as a result of this resolve he opens the pens of the Paṇis and, as in the Vala story, lets loose cattle, symbols of both wealth and the dawns. In the latter part of this verse the function of Agni in promoting the exchange between gods and sacrificers is suggested by word play that turns on the ambiguity of arka﻿́, which can mean either “chant” or “flame,” and of the com-pound purubho﻿́jas, either “bringing sustenance” or “consuming sustenance.” That is, Agni purifies either the chant that creates food for humans or the flames that consume it on behalf of the gods.In 3ab, in a different kind of word play, Agni bears the names of three gods, all of whom, like Agni, have roles in carrying out the ritual: Aditi is the embodiment of the “Guiltlessness” of one who performs the rite correctly, Vivasvant is the first sac-rificer (as Geldner notes), and Mitra is the deity of the sacrificial alliance between gods and humans. The name Vivasvant may also carry its appellative significance “shining forth,” which would also fit the fire. In 3cd Agni is brought into connection with two groups of goddesses, who are complicit in the birth of Agni: the Dawns, with whom he appears in the early morning, and the Waters, who give birth to Agni and place him in the “fruitful” plants, from which the fire emerges. There is a final word play in verse 6c, where puruṇīthā́ . . . jarasva can mean that, as a god, Agni should awaken to the musical modes of the ritual chants or, as a priest, should sing musical modes through the sounds of the fire. There is even battle imagery in the latter part of the hymn: in verse 4 Agni enters the “melee” and in verse 5 with Agni’s help Vasiṣṭha destroys the Jarūtha, probably a demonized enemy who is part of the Vasiṣṭha family lore. In that context, puruṇīthā́ could also have a secondary refer-ence to warriors’ strategems by which wealth is won.1. The lover of the Dawns has awakened from their lap, the delighting Hotar, the best of sage poets, the pure one.He sets in place the beacon for both races: the oblations among the gods and wealth among the good ritual performers.2. He of strong resolve, who (opens) up the doors of the Paṇis as he purifies the chant that brings much sustenance for us,he, the delighting Hotar and the housemaster of the clans, has become visible, across the darkness of the nights.3. The sage poet who is never misled—Aditi and Vivasvant, Mitra of good fellowship and our kind guest—with shimmering radiance, he radiates at the head of the Dawns. The infant of the Waters has entered the fruitful ones.4. The one to be invoked by you among the generations of Manu, entering the melee, Jātavedas blazed.He who radiates forth with a radiance beautiful to see—cows awaken in response to him as he is kindled.5.

The first words of the first verse uṣo﻿́ na﻿́ jāra﻿́ḥ echo its last uśatī́r ajīgaḥ, and throughout the verse the poet pairs initial sounds: pr̥thú pā́jaḥ, da﻿́vidyutad dī́dyat, and bhāti bhāṣā́, in what may be a sonic representation of the flickering fire repeatedly flaming. In verses 2 and 3 he strings sets of three repeti-tions: drava﻿́d dūto﻿́ devayā́vā (2d) and susaṃdŕ̥śaṃ supra﻿́tīkaṃ sva﻿́ñcam (3c). He then returns to pairs in verse 4: rudra﻿́ṃ rudre﻿́bhiḥ, āditye﻿́bhir a﻿́ditim. These repetitions abruptly stop at the last verse, which states matter-of-factly the principal theme of the hymn first enunciated at verse 2: Agni brings offerings to the gods in heaven and wealth to mortals on earth. There is a variation on this theme in verse 4, in which Agni not only conveys oblations to the gods (as in vs. 3), but also conveys the gods to earth at the sacrificial place.1. Like the lover of Dawn, flaring, shining, and blazing, he has held up his broad face.The bull, the blazing fallow bay, radiates with his radiance. Urging on our eager insights, he has awakened them.2. Like the sun, at the dawning of the Dawns he has shone, stretching forth the sacrifice, like fire-priests their thought.Distinguishing the kinds (of gods and mortals), the god Agni (comes) here at a run as a messenger, seeking the gods and best bringing gain (to mortals).3. Our songs and thoughts, serving the gods, come to Agni, seeking a share in wealth,to him of lovely appearance, of lovely face, and of lovely look, to him conveying oblations as the spoked wheel of the descendants of Manu.4. O Agni, convey Indra to us along with the Vasus, lofty Rudra along with the Rudras,Aditi belonging to all peoples along with the Ādityas, and Br̥haspati granting all wishes along with the reciters of verses."},{"pageNumber":913,"pageContent":"VII.118965. The fire-priests invoke him, the delighting Hotar, the youngest one; the clans invoke Agni at the rites,for he has become the protector of riches on earth and the unwearying messenger to bring sacrifice to the gods.VII.11 (527) AgniVasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi5 verses: triṣṭubhThe keywords in this hymn are ā́ “hither” and iha﻿́ “here.” The poet asks that Agni come “hither” (vs. 1c) to sacrifice “here” (vss. 1d, 3c). And not only should Agni come, but he should also bring the gods “hither” (vs. 5a) to enjoy the sacrifice “here” (vs. 5b). The last pāda—excluding the Vasiṣṭha signature pāda—presents an interesting twist, for the poet asks that this sacrifice, the sacrifice that is at this place on earth, that is here where he has asked Agni to come and here where he is to bring the gods, be placed “in heaven among the gods” (vs. 5c). At the end, therefore, what is present and local should become celestial and divine.Verse 3 of this hymn presents an additional puzzle. What does it mean when it says that good things become visible in Agni “three times at night”? Following Sāyaṇa, Geldner argues that “night” here means the whole day, and therefore the reference is to the three soma-pressings. Recognizing the difficulty of this interpre-tation, Oldenberg wonders whether there might be a reference here to an Atirātra or “overnight” rite. We agree and think that the reference here is to the rites that take place at night. But what rites these are or why “good things” are visible in the fire during them remains unclear.1. You are the great sign of the rite; without you the immortals find no elation.Travel hither in the same chariot with all the gods. Agni, take your seat here as the first Hotar.2. Bringing offerings, the descendants of Manu always invoke you, the nimble one, to act as messenger.Upon whose sacred grass you sit with the gods, o Agni, for him the days become bright shining.3. Three times at night, good things become visible within you for the pious mortal.As you did for Manu, o Agni, sacrifice here to the gods. Become our messenger, protecting us from curses.4.

Agni’s principal function here is to pro-tect the household against unnamed difficulties (vss. 2a, 2c) and accusations (vs. 2c). It is because he protects the family that he is Varuṇa and Mitra (vs. 3a), since these two gods guard the structure of the household and of the larger society.1. We have come with great reverence to the youngest one, who, kindled, shines in his own home—to him of shimmering radiance between the two wide world-halves, to him facing out in every direction, receiving the well-poured offering.2.

Because Agni is the sun, he blazes everywhere, smashes enemies, fills heaven and earth with his light, releases the gods from the curse (of darkness), looks upon all beings, and encom-passes the earth.

Noteworthy in this hymn is the repetition of an emphatic vaya﻿́m “we” at the beginning of each pāda in verse 2, continuing its placement in 1d. The poet is drawing the god’s attention not only to the forms of ritual service he is being offered, but also to the poet and his people as those offer-ing that service.1.

The first triplet of verses defines Agni as the clan fire, which lives close to the family and protects it. In the second triplet Agni is invoked to be present as the fire of the sacrifice. Structurally, the second triplet replicates the first, since the second two verses in each form a single syntactic unit that begins with a relative clause and continues with an imperative. This repeated structure iconically suggests the identity of the clan fire and the sacrificial fire, and in the third triplet the sacrificial fire and the clan fire are explicitly blended. Agni represents the clanlord and he receives the sacrificial oblations (vs. 7). Through the sacrifice Agni provides the clan with “heroes,” the male children who guarantee the prosperity of the clan. In verse 9, as also in VII.1.14, the a﻿́kṣarā refers to both a syllable—its primary meaning—and a cow that always gives milk. Thus, the “syl-lable” of the poets comes with thousands of syllables, and because their speech is an inexhaustible cow, it brings thousands of cattle.The fourth tr̥ca takes Agni into the sphere of the minor Ādityas, Savitar, Bhaga, and the mysterious Diti, who is here the personification of giving embodied in the sacrificial fire. Geldner suggests that Diti is the female counterpart of Bhaga, but Diti is as easily male (and we believe more likely so) as female. Diti and Aditi, the mother of the Ādityas, appear to be in a systematic grammatical relationship, with the latter being a negated version of the former. But here Diti is not the opposite of Aditi but seemingly one of her children, since Diti appears alongside other Ādityas.If the fourth tr̥ca emphasizes the gifts of the Agni, the last appeals for his power to protect from bad times and evil people.1. Pour the oblation in his mouth for him to be reverently approached, for him granting rewards,who is closest friendship for us.2. Who has sat down in every house, (presiding) over the five peoples—the sage poet and houselord, the youthful one—3. Let him, Agni, guard our household possessions in every direction,and let him protect us from difficult straits.4. Now I give birth to a new praise song for Agni, the falcon of heaven.Will he not win for us what is good?5. Whose glories are eagerly sought to be seen, like the wealth of one rich in heroes—(the glories of him) who flames at the beginning of the sacrifice—6. Let him pursue this vaṣaṭ-call.

Because he thus nourishes both gods and humans, he is the “child of nourishment” (vs. 1). The poet repeatedly mentions the patron or patrons of the rite alongside the priests. Agni himself is not only the Hotar, who recites, and the Potar, who purifies the soma, but also the householder, who is the patron of the rite (vs. 5). In verse 6 the poet calls on Agni to sharpen not only the priests but also the one who “praises well” and “is skillful,” a combination of the ability to recite and the ability to perform the rites. The latter may be a priest, but it might be again the householder, who is also a participant in the rite and who owns, in a sense, all of the priestly functions.

The hymn has long been used as a major source for the reconstruction of R̥gvedic history, perhaps somewhat too credu-lously, as the description of the battle is anything but clear and is also clearly full of puns, derisive word plays, phonological deformations of the names of oppo-nents, and other poetic tricks, all couched in slangy language. Since the “historical” dimension of the hymn has been fully treated elsewhere (see especially Schmidt 1980 and Witzel 1995a), we will not discuss it further here.The hymn falls into three parts. Verses 1–4 recall the aid that Indra has given us in the past and ask for his help and gifts now. The poet names himself at the very end of verse 4, which forms a clever ring with verse 1: the description of Indra in 1d, . . . va﻿́su . . . va﻿́niṣṭhaḥ “best gainer of goods,” is condensed into the poet’s own name in 4d, va﻿́s (u)(va﻿́n) iṣṭhaḥ → va﻿́siṣṭhaḥ. The language and contents of these first four verses are well-crafted but unremarkable.The battle proper and its immediate aftermath occupy verses 5–21; the battle itself takes place in and around the Paruṣṇī River (see esp. vss. 8–10), whose course seems to have been diverted during the battle and in which a number of the com-batants seem to have drowned. The account, especially the earlier verses, seems to mirror the confusion and chaos of battle itself (reminiscent on a much smaller scale of Tolstoy’s great accounts of the unintelligible disorder of battle in War and Peace, or of Stephen Crane’s in The Red Badge of Courage). The confusion begins to sort itself out as Indra’s role becomes more prominently featured. It is emphasized sev-eral times that the forces of Sudās were outnumbered but that Indra was able to marshal this overmastered force to defeat their foes (esp. vss. 14, 17). This section ends with several verses celebrating the victory and Indra’s benevolence (20–21).The final four verses (22–25) are a dānastuti, praising the extravagant gifts of Sudās to the poet, ending (vs. 25) by commending Sudās to the protection of the Maruts.1. Since with you beside (them), o Indra, our fathers, the singers, also won all things of value—because in you are the good milking cows, in you the horses—you are the best gainer of goods for one who serves the gods.2.

These gladdening hymns, contending with each other here, seeking the gods, have reverently approached you.Let the path of your wealth lead our way. Might we be in your good thought, Indra, in your shelter.4.

The allegiances and enmities of that hymn are strikingly different here: for example, Indra helps the Pūru king in this hymn (vs. 3), whereas in VII.18 the Pūrus are the enemy.Beginning with verse 6 we attempt to mobilize the powers and protection that Indra has previously provided for us, and as usual we offer praise in return.1.

It continues with praise especially of Indra’s martial powers (vss. 3–5). Verse 5 takes up the theme of Indra’s birth, found in the first pāda of the hymn, but it is not entirely clear who the father and mother are. In our opinion this is only a metaphorical reference to birth: Indra’s vivification at the soma sacrifice, with the bull-father actually soma, referred to in the immediately preceding pāda (4d). The identification of the mother is more dif-ficult in this interpretation: it could be a reference to the cow whose milk is mixed with soma. A non-ritual reading of the verse is also possible, with the father and mother the unnamed parents of Indra referred to elsewhere in the R̥gveda.The second half of the hymn (vss. 6–10) describes the usual reciprocal relation between worshiper and god: anyone who gives the appropriate ritual devotion to Indra will be appropriately rewarded (see esp. vss. 6, 8). Yet the poet is not entirely sure Indra is doing his part, and in verse 7 he rather saucily (and even slangily) con-trasts the proper patron–client behavior among humans with Indra’s failure to come through. The poet also treats himself somewhat mockingly: in verse 9 he compares his praise first to a bellowing bull and then—in our view (the relevant word is a disputed hapax)—to another animal with a wailing or screeching cry, perhaps a monkey. But these light moments give way to the usual pleas for benefits at the end of the hymn."},{"pageNumber":925,"pageContent":"VII.209081.

He acknowledges that there are competing rituals designed for Indra (vss. 6–7) and also acknowledges that no ritual activities and no hymns of men can quite measure up to the worth of Indra (vss. 8–9). Indeed, in this case Vasiṣṭha’s modesty seems justified: though the hymn is pleasingly phrased, it hardly counts as one of the pinnacles of R̥gvedic praise poetry.1. Drink soma, Indra. Let it exhilarate you—(the soma) that the stone has pressed for you, you of the fallow bays,(the stone) like a steed well guided by the arms of the presser.2. The dear exhilarating drink that exists to be yoked by you, with which you smash obstacles, you of the fallow bays,let that one exhilarate you, Indra of preeminent goods.3.

The first two verses seem to establish the context as a verbal contest between competing poets, although this context is not prominent in the rest of the hymn. The dominating theme is simply the soma sacrifice (soma drinks, vs. 5) and especially the accompanying verbal offerings (vss. 1–4). Praise of Indra’s great deeds and powers is limited to a single pāda in the first verse (1c) and the second half of verse 3. Even this latter provides a transition to the ritual: 3d seems to refer to the Vr̥tra myth, and 4a might be taken as expressing the aftermath of the Vr̥tra-slaying, namely the release of the waters. But we consider its primary reference to be the waters used to swell the soma stalks before pressing; “swell” is regularly used of fertile, milking cows, but here the paradox is that the waters swell as if with milk although they are not themselves fertile.Noteworthy is the second half of verse 2, a variant of the usual plea to the gods to extend our lifetime for a hundred years. Here we ask that we be carried across the various dangers to long life, though we do not know the lifetime we will have. Otherwise, Indra receives the standard requests to distribute wealth to us (vss. 4–6)."},{"pageNumber":929,"pageContent":"VII.249121. The sacred formulations have risen up, seeking fame.

On the one hand, the first two verses respond to each other and establish pressed soma and hymns as the linked indispensible requisites of the sacrifice to Indra; the doubly negative formulation of the first half of verse 1 is especially striking. The last two verses (4–5) also respond to each other, each beginning with evā́ “in just this way.” These two pairs of verses highlight the excluded verse 3, the middle verse, as an omphalos, and this verse does contrast with the rest of the hymn in several ways. It is the only place where Indra’s deeds are spoken of, and it also contains in its second half a striking simile (the only simile describing Indra in the hymn), in which the submission of fortresses to Indra is compared to the submission of cowives to their common husband. Thus verse 3 is in a sense a miniature example of proper praise-poetry, celebrating a god’s mythic exploits in artful language.A different structural feature pairs verse 1 with the final verse 5, in opposition to the three middle verses (2–4). In the first verse the speaker is “I”; in the last (vs. 5) it is Vasiṣṭha, who is doubtless identical with the “I” of verse 1. The middle verses instead have plural ritual participants: “those of equal skill” who call on Indra (vs. 2), ritual adepts (vs. 3), and the unidentified subject of “they speak” in verse 4. These middle verses may refer to the competing invocations of rival sacrificers, a subject that is something of a preoccupation of this set of Indra hymns (see, e.g., VII.22.6, 27.4, 28.1). The fear is always that they will attract Indra to their sacri-fice rather than to that of the current speaker. The position of the Vasiṣṭha verses on both sides of these verses and enclosing them seems implicitly to assert that Vasiṣṭha’s invocation has been successful. The parallelism of the last two verses, “just in this way [evá] they speak . . . ” (vs. 4) and “just in this way [evá] Vasiṣṭha hymns . . . ,” highlights this contrast.The pleasing contrastive balance of both types of ring structures gives substance to the poet’s boast in verse 1 that he is composing a “newer hymn that [Indra] will enjoy.”"},{"pageNumber":932,"pageContent":"VII.279151. Soma, unpressed, does not exhilarate Indra, nor do pressings unaccompanied by sacred formulations (exhilarate) the bounteous one.For him I beget a hymn that he will enjoy, a newer manly one, so that he will listen to us.2. Wherever there is a hymn, soma exhilarates Indra; whenever there is (ritual) conduct, the pressings (exhilarate) the bounteous one,when, like sons to their father, those of equal skill [=poets/sacrificers] call urgently upon him for help.3. He did those (deeds)—he will now do others—which the ritual adepts proclaim at the pressings.As a single common husband does his wives, Indra has dragged down all the strongholds to submission.4.

The words “bounty,” “bounteous,” “largesse,” and so forth are prominent. What would prompt his giving, namely our praise and sacrifice, is barely, but significantly, men-tioned: the first verse opens with the martial context that is common throughout these Indra hymns in the VIIth Maṇḍala, with men in battle position. In our inter-pretation of pāda b, Indra is expected to harness the praise hymns directed to him by the poets of our side “to be decisive”—that is, the hymns will ensure that Indra will fight on our side and bring us victory. This concern to have Indra on our side in battle is echoed in verse 4 with the “coincident call.” This call can refer both to war-riors on opposing sides each calling Indra to fight on their own side, as in verse 1, and also to rival sacrificers each calling Indra to come to their sacrifice, as we have seen elsewhere in this Indra cycle.Another important theme in the hymn is confinement, with subtle allusion to the Vala myth. We ask for a share of the cattle enclosure in 1d and in 2d exhort Indra to break apart the firmly closed fortresses and uncover what is enclosed there; the"},{"pageNumber":933,"pageContent":"VII.28916swelling gift-cow in 4cd was previously enclosed (in our opinion; this adjective is ordinarily ascribed to a different root, and it can be a pun, with the second meaning “sought after”); and in the final verse (5) we ask Indra to make wide space for our wealth.1. Indra do men call upon when facing the other side, so that he will hitch up these insights (of theirs) (to be) decisive.As champion at the winning of men, taking pleasure in your strength, give us a share in the enclosure containing cattle.2. The unbridled power that is yours, bounteous Indra, (with it) do your best for your comrades, your men, o much invoked one.Because as one who can tell things apart you (take) apart the fastnesses, o bounteous one, (now) uncover largesse like something confined.3. Indra is king of the moving world, of the settled domains, (and of) whatever of diverse form exists on the earth.From this he gives goods to the pious man; he impels largesse nearby, just when he is praised.4. Never does bounteous Indra, because of (another) call coincident with ours, hold back from giving spoils along with help to us,he whose unfailing gift-cow swells, a thing of value for his men, his comrades, she who was (previously) enclosed.5. Now, Indra, make wide space for our wealth. May we turn your mind here for bounty,as we pursue (wealth) in cows, horses, and chariots. – Do you protect us always with your blessings.VII.28 (544) IndraVasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi5 verses: triṣṭubhAnother hymn in this series concerned with competition between sacrificers. The first verse exhorts Indra to heed only our call, though others are calling, too, and in the second verse the phrase “penetrate through” seems to refer to Indra’s ability to ignore the competitive calls in order to come to ours. The second half of verse 2 and verse 3 then turn to Indra’s great deeds, but this section is connected to the first by a word play. Although it cannot be rendered easily in English, both the “vie in invok-ing” of verse 1 and the “penetrate through” in verse 2 contain the preverb ví “apart, through,” which is in regular opposition to sám “together.” In verse 3 it is said that Indra “united” the two world-halves, using a verb phrase including the preverb sám (literally “lead together”). But the cosmogonic deed that is regularly credited to Indra is rather the separation or pushing apart of the same two world-halves (for a nearby example see VII.23.3); we contend that here this underlying formula"},{"pageNumber":934,"pageContent":"VII.29917is evoked by its opposite—the audience, familiar with the verbal formulae encap-sulating Indra’s great deeds, would understand “lead together [sám]” as “lead apart [ví],” primed by the ví forms found earlier in the hymn. For another example of an underlying formula appearing on the surface as its opposite, see Jamison (1982/83).Verse 4 is notable because of the intrusion of Varuṇa into this Indra hymn, and Varuṇa in his role as observer and judge of the moral behavior of humans. Varuṇa is the tutelary deity of Vasiṣṭha (see the remarkable series of Varuṇa hymns, VII.86–89 below), but Varuṇa’s presence is otherwise not found, or expected, in Indraic context. Since the last verse (5) is a refrain verse, in this Indra hymn Varuṇa has the last word, as it were. For Mitra and Varuṇa’s parentage of Vasiṣṭha, see VII.33.10–14.1. Drive up to our sacred formulations, Indra, as knowing one. Let your yoked fallow bays be turned our way,for although all mortals vie in invoking you, listen only to us, o all-impeller.2. Your greatness, Indra, has penetrated through to our call, in that you protect the sacred formulations of the seers, o powerful one,when, o strong one, you have taken the mace in your hand. Being terrible by virtue of your will, you were born invincible—3. When with your guidance you “united” the two world-halves, which were like men eagerly calling upon (you).Because he was born for great dominion, for power, the thruster pierced just the non-thruster.4. Through these days, Indra, show favor to us, for the settled peoples who possess bad alliances are purifying themselves.When the sinless one [=Varuṇa] observes untruth, once again Varuṇa, master of artifice, (will) unloose us (from it).5.

Also, as in VII.28, another god is introduced into an Indra hymn, this time Agni (vs. 3), rather than Varuṇa (VII.28.4).

It begins with the poet’s address to his priestly comrades (vs. 1), followed by his self-address (vs. 2a), and the joint production of his comrades and himself is referred to in the 1st plural in 2bc. The last tr̥ca likewise begins with an address to the priests by the poet (vs. 10). At regular intervals throughout the hymn the poet and his fellow celebrants are compared to the Maruts, who likewise hymned Indra (vss. 2, 8, 12).The praise of Indra and the benefits we request of him are generic, but nicely balanced.1. Sing forth your exhilarating (song) to Indra of the fallow bays,to the soma-drinker, o comrades.2. (You yourself, o poet—) recite solemn speech to him of good gifts.

Even within the verse pairs there is little cohesion. But there is a unifying theme that runs throughout: Indra’s gener-ous giving and our grateful receiving, to an extent unusual even in an Indra hymn. Moreover, it is not only Indra’s giving that we seek: it is repeatedly emphasized that Indra helps and gives to mortals who themselves give, that is, the patrons of the sacrifice (see, e.g., vss. 7, 8, 10, 15).The hymn opens (vs. 1) with the preoccupation that has been visible in many Indra hymns in VII, the fear that rival sacrificers may attract Indra to their own rituals, and Indra’s epithet “invoked by many” appears several times (vss. 17, 20, 26). Much of the hymn is concerned with defining the type of ritual behavior that will cause Indra to choose one sacrifice over another.Indra is supreme in this hymn. In its twenty-seven verses there is only one men-tion of another divinity, the Maruts in verse 10.1. Let not (any other) cantors at all stop you at a distance from us.Even from afar come here to our joint revelry, or being (already) here hearken (to us),2.

The Anukramaṇī identifies the poet of verses 1–9 as Vasiṣṭha and the “deity” as Vasiṣṭha’s sons, with the opposite identifications for verses 10–14, but this does not seem the most perspicuous assignment of roles. Rather, it seems that the hymn falls into three parts: 1–6, 7–9, 10–14, starting with a time close to the (semi-mythical) present and moving backward to the deep mythical past.The first six verses celebrate the Vasiṣṭhas’ successful invitation of Indra to their soma sacrifice and Indra’s subsequent aid to Sudās and the Tr̥tsus in the Ten Kings battle. Indra himself appears to be the speaker in verses 1 and 4. The first two verses depict one of the themes running through this set of Indra hymns: competing sacri-fices. Here, Indra seems actually to rise from his seat at another sacrifice to go to the Vasiṣṭhas in verse 1, with his journey described in verse 2. Verses 3–6 treat his aid to Sudās in the Ten Kings battle, with all credit given to the Vasiṣṭhas’ poetic skill for bringing this aid (vss. 3–5), and Indra himself declaring this in verse 4.The next section begins with a trio of riddles based on the number three (vs. 7), with the last pāda of that verse asserting that it is exactly this knowledge that the Vasiṣṭhas control—a nice meta-comment on what Vedic poets were supposed to know. There is no consensus (modern or ancient) on the answers to these three riddles. The three producers of semen may be the three soma-pressings, or heaven (with its rain), soma, and man—and other answers have also been suggested. The three Ārya “creatures” with light in front could be the three ritual fires, or the fire, the sun, and dawn—and, again, there are other possible solutions. As for the three “heats,” these could again be the ritual fires, or the sun, the fire, and the gharma"},{"pageNumber":941,"pageContent":"VII.33924drink, or some other triad. It is perhaps pleasing that the Vasiṣṭhas’ esoteric knowl-edge has remained safe with them for over three millennia! This skill of theirs at decoding secrets and putting them in proper verbal form is celebrated further in verse 8 and the first half of verse 9.The second half of verse 9 provides the transition to the last section, concern-ing the birth of Vasiṣṭha. What the Vasiṣṭhas are weaving (a motif recurring almost verbatim in vs. 12) is not entirely clear, but we are inclined to think it concerns the institution and performance of the sacrifice. It is clear why they are approaching the Apsarases (the heavenly “nymphs” of Vedic and later Indian culture): one of the Apsarases’ number, Urvaśī, is their mother (see vss. 11–12), with Mitra and Varuṇa as their father (see vss. 11, 13), in the first of their forefather Vasiṣṭha’s births. Both births are referred to in verse 10, both that from Mitra and Varuṇa and that when Agastya presented him to the clan. To say that the details of the births are murky is an understatement, and we will not attempt here to interpret all the mysteries in these verses. The last verse (14) is traditionally taken as Agastya’s words, introduc-ing Vasiṣṭha to his adoptive clan, the Tr̥tsus, and outlining Vasiṣṭha’s ritual role. The address to “you thrusters forth” (pratr̥daḥ) is most likely a pun on their name.1. [Indra:] They, bright-faced, with their braids on the right side, quickening thought—because they exhilarated me,I, standing up from the ritual grass, speak about the superior men: “They cannot be helped by me from a distance—the Vasiṣṭhas.”2. From a distance they led Indra here with pressed (soma)—across a lake’s worth (of soma), on beyond the powerful drink.Over the pressed soma of Pāśadyumna Vāyata he preferred the Vasiṣṭhas.3. It was certainly just with them that he crossed the Sindhu; certainly just with them that he smashed Bheda [/the “Splitter”];it was certainly just by reason of your sacred formulation that Indra helped Sudās in the Battle of the Ten Kings, o Vasiṣṭhas.4. [Indra:] Gladly, you superior men, by reason of your fathers’ sacred formulation, I have engirded the axle: you will certainly not be harmed,since with a lofty cry in Śakvarī [=martial] (meter) you established impetuous force in Indra, o Vasiṣṭhas.5. Like thirsty ones looking toward heaven (for rain), in distress they looked toward (Indra) when they were surrounded in the Battle of the Ten Kings.Indra hearkened to Vasiṣṭha as he was praising; he made the broad space broad for the Tr̥tsus.6.

But in later parts of the hymn the gods and divine forces are identified, starting with Varuṇa in verses 10–11. Minor gods predominate in this section (e.g., Ahi Budhnya, the Serpent of the Deep, vss. 16–17), through verse 23. There are also several interludes requesting help against hostility and bodily harm (vss. 12–13, 18–19). The final two verses call on many of the major gods of the pantheon, without distinguishing characteristics.There is a distinct watery theme running throughout the hymn, beginning with the waters themselves (vss. 2–3). When Varuṇa is mentioned (vss. 10–11), it is in his association with waters, a mostly later quality of Varuṇa’s. The Child of the Waters (Apām Napāt, vs. 15) and the “water-born” Serpent of the Deep (vss. 16–17) con-tribute to this aqueous environment, and the waters themselves reappear in verse 23. The reason for this emphasis on water is not clear.1. Let the gleaming divine inspired thought go forth from us,well-fashioned like a prizewinning chariot.2. They know the means of begetting of earth and of heaven;the waters listen then, even as they flow.3.

The verses whose divinities are clear are 1: Sun; 2: Mitra and Varuṇa; 5: Rudra, 6: Rivers, 7: Maruts (and their mother Pr̥śni?); 8: Aramati, Pūṣan, and Bhaga; 9: Maruts and Viṣṇu. For verse 3 some schol-ars identify the Wind and Parjanya [Thunder] as the dedicands, but we assign it instead to Soma; verse 4 may belong to both Indra and Aryaman, but we consider aryamán here to be used as a descriptor of Indra, rather than as the name of the third member of the Ādityan triad, since the other descriptors—strong resolution and confounding of the enemy’s battle fury—are characteristic of Indra.The hymn can also be read as a chronological progress through a sacrifice. In verse 1 the fire is kindled at dawn and ritual speech is uttered on the ritual ground. The hymn is mentioned in verse 2, and the preparation of soma in verse 3. The invitation to Indra to come to the sacrifice with his horses is given in verse 4, and the actual sacrifice occurs in verse 5.

The association of Indra with the R̥bhus identifies the ritual moment as the Third Pressing, which they share, and since Savitar is often associated with the evening, his presence is also appropriate.The first four verses concern the sacrifice: the gods come, drink together, and give gifts to the sacrificer and his patrons. In verse 4 Indra is sent home with a final chorus. The next verses change the scene. In verses 5–6 Indra is praised for his help in winning more territory for us, but he seems to be withholding the wealth we expect. The most puzzling verse is 7, which has elicited various interpretations. In our opinion, the “triple kin-bonds” refers to the three-generation model, in which a man is situated conceptually between his father and his sons; this man is threatened by dissolution and premature death, not only of himself but also of his sons, and he approaches Indra for aid, since Indra himself successfully attains old age (an inter-esting conceit for a “deathless” or “immortal” god). But this interpretation remains uncertain and speculative. The first pāda of the final verse (8) forms a ring with the first pāda of the hymn, and the topic returns to the gifts we expect and hope for.1. Let the chariot, the best conveyor, convey you here to be praised, o Vājas, R̥bhukṣans—(a chariot) indestructible.Fill yourselves to exhilaration with great triple-backed soma drinks at the pressings, you lovely-lipped ones.2.

It is found in the middle of the All God hymns of the VIIth Maṇḍala in proper sequence as to meter and number of verses, and, in addition to Savitar, mentions a number of divinities, including several minor ones found also in the surrounding All God hymns: see especially verse 5 with the Gift-Escorts (also VII.34.22, 23; 35.11; 40.6), Ahi Budhnya (the Serpent of the Deep; also VII.34.17; 35.13), and the Shielding Goddess(es); also VII.34.22; 40.6). The mysterious Ekadhenus (literally, “having a single milk-cow”) are found only here. It is not unusual in an All God hymn for a single god to predominate and others to be mentioned only in passing; compare nearby VII.37 with its primary focus on Indra and the R̥bhus.Savitar’s role is most prominent in the first two verses, where, as usual, he stands up and raises his emblem, demonstrating his power to impel and compel. The group of gods known as Vasus praises him in verse 3; Aditi and the Ādityas greet him in verse 4; and, as already mentioned, several minor divinities are found in verse 5. As often, the god Bhaga (“Fortune”) is invoked along with Savitar (vss. 1 and 6) as the distributor of goods, which we seek. The last two verses (7–8) concern the “prize-winners” (vājín). This word is frequently a descriptor of horses in competition, and a number of scholars consider the reference here to be actual horses in the human realm. However, the sacrificial context in these two verses is strong, and on the basis"},{"pageNumber":950,"pageContent":"VII.39933of phraseological parallels we consider the referents to be the Maruts (who are called prizewinners in VII.36.7, while the phrase “let the Maruts of good chant be luck for us” is found in VII.35.9).1. This god Savitar holds up the golden emblem which he has fixed firm.Now is Bhaga to be invoked by the sons of Manu—he of many goods who distributes treasures.2. Stand up, Savitar.

The final verse (7) summarizes what has gone before, in the name of the Vasiṣṭhas.Verse 2b contains an impossible hapax, bī́riṭe, phonologically aberrant and mor-phologically opaque.

But a wide variety of gods are implicated in this giving, as well as in providing other help (see vss. 3–4). There is little to attract particular attention in this hymn, save for the sly admonition to Pūṣan not to be jealous of our receiving gifts (vs. 6).1.

The early-morning context of the hymn returns with the last two verses (6–7), concern-ing the Dawns, who bring Bhaga with them (vs. 6). The final verse, which does not mention Bhaga, is found also in a Dawn hymn later in the VIIth Maṇḍala (VII.80.3) and is clearly extra-hymnic here.1. At early morning we call on Agni, at early morning on Indra, at early morning on Mitra and Varuṇa, at early morning on the Aśvins;at early morning on Bhaga, Pūṣan, Brahmaṇaspati, at early morning on Soma and Rudra should we call.2. We should call on the one victorious at early morning, Bhaga the strong, Aditi’s son, who is the distributor,to whom even a person who thinks himself weak (and also) even the powerful, even the king says “Apportion me a portion.”3.

The hymn begins with a verse expressing the readiness of all the ritual ele-ments. Then Agni takes over and provides the impetus, hitching up his flames in verse 2, and, as he gets larger, performing the sacrifice (vss. 3, 5). In verse 4 Agni (identified as a guest, as often) is asked for the reward that is the expected return for a successful sacrifice. The final verse (6) is a typical summary verse and names Vasiṣṭha as the poet, as in another summary verse in this series (VII.39.7=40.7). Although this is an All God hymn, the participation of named gods other than Agni is limited to verse 5, where they are the simply the recipients of the sacrifice. The mention of Aṅgirases in verse 1 is probably meant as a reference to the poet and the other priests.1. The Aṅgirases, possessors of the sacred formulation, are reaching forth. Let the roar of (the hymn? fire? soma?) that is set to burst out go questing forth.The cows swimming in the waters are bellowing forth. The two pressing-stones should be yoked, as the ornament of the ceremony.2. Easy is your road, Agni, which was found long ago. Yoke your fallow bays and chestnuts when the soma is pressed,or those ruddy ones which, conveying heroes, are at your seat. Seated, I call the races of gods.3. They magnify the sacrifice for you all with acts of reverence; the gladdening Hotar [=Agni] is projecting in the nearness.Sacrifice well to the gods, o you of many faces. You should turn hither Aramati [/Devotion] worthy of the sacrifice.4. When in the dwelling of a rich hero the guest will show brightly, lying in his comfortable womb,Agni, well pleased, well established in the house, will give to a clan such as this a desirable reward.5. Enjoy this ceremony of ours, o Agni. Make it glorious for us among the Maruts and Indra.Then sit here on the ritual grass night and dawn. Sacrifice here to Mitra and Varuṇa, who desire it.6.

Instead the sacrifice is again the focus: it is set in motion in verses 1–2, with the priests exhorted to perform the ritual actions in the latter verse. The gods’ attendance is described in verses 3–4, and the poet’s relative indifference to their individual identities is expressed in the phrase “however many you are” at the end of verse 4. Appropriate to the ritual focus, Agni is the only god named (besides a glancing reference to Heaven and Earth in vs. 1), and his actions and companion-ship are crucial to our well-being.1. At the sacrifices those seeking the gods chant forth for you all to Heaven and Earth with acts of reverence, in order to prosper—those whose unequalled, inspired sacred formulations go questing in divergent directions like the branches of a tree.2. Let the sacrifice go forth, like a team to be spurred on. Being of one mind, hold up the (ladles) facing toward the ghee;spread the ritual grass that brings success to the ceremony. The flames, seeking the gods, have stood up erect.3.

(See IV.38–40 for other hymns devoted to Dadhikrā; the last two [39—40] also show significant dawn associations.) Unlike VII.41, however, where the god who is subject of the rest of the hymn, Bhaga, holds the stage essentially alone after the first verse, Dadhikrā shares each of the subsequent verses with a number of gods, again primarily characteristic of the dawn ritual.The most difficult verse is 3, not coincidentally the middle verse, whose third pāda contains two color terms as addressees and a next-to-impossible hapax (mām̐ścato﻿́ḥ), whose meaning is hotly disputed. Most commentators interpret the color terms as referring to other horses. Our interpretation is quite different and unavoidably speculative, but rather than introducing two otherwise unknown horses, we identify the two addressees as gods associated with the ritual. In our view the hapax refers to the two twilights (literally, “the time of the hiding of the moon,” originally applied just to dawn), and the copper-colored one is the sun, whose color is reddish at rising and setting, while the reddish-brown one is soma: the same color term is used of soma a number of times.Though it is not entirely clear why Dadhikrā is so strongly associated with the dawn, it may be significant that the priestly gifts (dakṣiṇā) are distributed at the dawn ritual and horses are among the most prized of these gifts. In most of this hymn the equine aspects of Dadhikrā are not emphasized, except for vs. 4, unlike the Dadhikrā hymns in Maṇḍala IV.1. Upon Dadhikrā as the first, upon the Aśvins and Dawn, upon the kindled Agni and Bhaga, do I call for your sake for help,upon Indra, Viṣṇu, Pūṣan, and Brahmaṇaspati, upon the Ādityas, Heaven and Earth, the Waters, and the Sun.2. Awakening Dadhikrā with homage, rousing ourselves and reverently approaching the sacrifice,seating the goddess Refreshment on the ritual grass, we would call upon the Aśvins, inspired poets easy to call.3. To Dadhikrāvan and Agni do I speak on having awakened, and to Dawn, the Sun, and the Cow,to the one of Varuṇa who is copper-colored at the twilights [=sun?] and to the reddish-brown one [=soma?]. Let them keep all difficulties away from us.4. Dadhikrāvan becomes the foremost prizewinning steed at the forefront of the chariots, as the foreknowing one,being in accord with Dawn and the Sun, with the Ādityas, Vasus, and Aṅgirases.5.

Let god Savitar drive here, possessed of good treasure, filling the midspace, journeying with his horses,holding many things meant for men in his hand, bringing the world to rest and impelling it forth.2. His two golden arms, pliant and lofty, have reached up to the ends of heaven.Now this greatness of his has been marveled at. Even the sun has ceded to him his task.3.

These waters come to be replaced by the rivers in the last two verses (3–4), but their physical characteris-tics are not mentioned either. However, the final pāda before the refrain (4c) alludes to the rivers’ making “wide space” for us, quite possibly an allusion to the enlarging of the Ārya territory by crossing and conquering rivers.1. O Waters, your wave of refreshments that those devoted to the gods made Indra’s first drink—it, gleaming and unbesmirched, showering ghee and filled with honey, might we win today.2. That wave of yours, o Waters, most filled with honey—let the Child of the Waters who impels swift (horses) help it.That on which Indra, along with the Vasus, will bring himself to exhilaration, that one of yours might we, seeking the gods, attain today.3.

Here as elsewhere the three R̥bhus can be invoked by the name of any one of them in the plural. A partial exception is that the stem vibhva﻿́n or víbhvan is replaced by víbhū or vibhú in the plural to name Vibhvan and the other two R̥bhus. Further, in this hymn verse 2 employs víbhvaḥ as an equivalent to víbhvā(m̐), the nominative of Vibhvan. Although the use of the plural of one name to designate the three gods is peculiar in translation, we have retained the Vedic idiom to avoid prolonging the addresses to the gods.The complex mixing of stems and singular and plural forms in such a short hymn suggests that the poet is deliberately drawing attention to the names of the R̥bhus and their meanings. Such a strategy is probably behind the repetitions in verse 2, which mentions “R̥bhu with the R̥bhus,” then “Vibhvan” (or more accu-rately “Vibhva”) “with the Vibhus,” and “Vāja. . . in winning the vā́ja.” The mean-ing of r̥bhú is approximately “craftsman,” víbhū and vibhú are “far-ranging,” and vā́ja is “prize.” These are all things or imply qualities that the sacrificers want, and indeed in 2ab the poet asks that the sacrificers be a “R̥bhu” or “a craftsman” and a “Vibhvan” or “far-ranging” in the company of R̥bhus and Vibhus in order to win a vā́ja, a prize.1. O R̥bhukṣans, o Vājas, among us find exhilaration in our pressed soma, o generous men.Like travelers’ intentions, let them [=your horses] make you, who are turned this way, and your manly chariot roll here, o Vibhūs.2.

With Indra as our yokemate, we would overcome our Vr̥tra [=obstacle].3. Because these very ones [=Indra and the R̥bhus] overcome many (commands) by their command, they conquer (even) in the face of the superiority of the outsider.Indra, Vibhvan, R̥bhukṣan, and Vāja will put away the manliness of the outsider and of the rival by confronting it.4.

But the purity and purifying power of flowing waters, noted in the first three verses, gives them a moral as well as a physical quality, and in verse 3 the god Varuṇa in his role as observer and judge of human actions is found among them. From passages like this it is easy to see how Varuṇa came to be so closely associated with the waters, a dominant characteristic of Varuṇa in later times. Verse 4 moves from the physical and moral to the ritual realm, to the employment of water in the soma sacrifice, the theme that prevailed in VII.47.1. They come from the middle of the (heavenly?) ocean, those whose chief is the sea—becoming pure, never settling down,whom the mace-bearing Indra, the bull, dug out—let those waters, goddesses, help me here.2.

The hymn is included among those to the waters because of the last verse invoking the rivers for their help. For a translation of the hymn and notes on the various lexical problems in it, see Zysk (1985: 28 and 130–32).The afflictions against which this hymn is recited center on the feet. The reference to the “creeping thing” in the refrain of 1–3 led Velankar (1963) to propose that the hymn is for treatment against different kinds of poison but especially against snake venom. However, the symptoms and the causes of the foot problems, even though they are too unclear to determine, appear to be varied. Zysk (p. 131) identifies the “creeping thing” as the ajakāva (vs. 1), “an evil-looking, crawling animal. . . which"},{"pageNumber":961,"pageContent":"VII.51944was known to have lived under the skin and to have formed a swelling or eruption” (pp. 25–26). However, the ajakāva could also be referred to in 1b and therefore be an ulcer or a swelling, if, as Renou (EVP XVI: 111) suggests, “the nesting thing” is a skin lesion in contrast to a “swelling thing” on the skin. Likewise, we cannot identify the vijāman joint, although it could be located in the foot, since the erup-tion apparently spreads from it to the ankles and knees. And, as Zysk (pp. 131–32) argues, the last verse probably refers to two kinds of female demons, the śipadā and śimidā, who polluted waters and caused the foot problems.1. Guard me here, Mitra and Varuṇa. Do not let the nesting or the swelling thing come upon us.I put the ajakāva of vile appearance out of sight. – Let not the creeping thing find me, bringing a disease of the foot.2. What eruption will appear on the vijāman joint and will become smeared over the knees and ankles,let blazing Agni force that away from here. – Let not the creeping thing find me, bringing a disease of the foot.3. What poison is in the silk cotton tree, what in streams, and what is produced from plants,let the All Gods propel that away from here. – Let not the creeping thing find me, bringing a disease of the foot.4. (The rivers) that are from the slope, depth, and height, those that are filled with water and those empty of water—let (these) kindly (river-)goddesses, swelling with (waters as their) milk, become for us free of śipadā-demons,let all the rivers become free of śimidā-demons.VII.51 (567) ĀdityasVasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi3 verses: triṣṭubhThis hymn is a general exhortation to the Ādityas to protect the sacrifice, keeping its performance in “offenselessness” (adititva﻿́), in accordance with their character as sons of Aditi, the goddess who represents offenselessness or innocence. In the later rite the offering of soma to Mitra and Varuṇa (as well as to the other dual divini-ties) takes place in the morning and that to the Ādityas (as well as to other divine collectives) in the evening. The gods in the last verse are worshiped at various times in the sacrificial day, but there appears to be an emphasis on gods associated with the evening rite: the Ādityas, All Gods, R̥bhus, and even the Aśvins, who are con-nected with both the morning and the evening rituals.1. We would be accompanied by the present help of the Ādityas and by their most luck-bringing protection."},{"pageNumber":962,"pageContent":"VII.52945Let the overpowering ones establish this sacrifice in guiltlessness and in offenselessness (adititvá), listening (to us).2.

In verse 1 the poet describes himself and his fellow sacrificers as a﻿́diti “offenseless,” and because they are a﻿́diti they are also āditya﻿́ “Ādityas” or “sons of Aditi.” This is a surpris-ing claim, and Geldner understandably softens it by turning the metaphor into a simile. According to him, the poet asks that he and his people be offenseless like Ādityas. Were we to adopt Geldner’s approach, then in 1b we could supply a differ-ent verb form and translate “there should be for us a fortress” (so Geldner) or “you [=Ādityas] should be for us a fortress.” This solution is attractive since gods are called fortresses in, for example, I.189.2 and VII.95.1. But there is no signal in the text for the simile or for the ellipsis, and therefore, albeit with considerable hesita-tion, we have translated the verse as if the speakers embody the “offenseless” gods. That theme of offenselessness is continued in the next verse, in which the poet begs that he and the sacrificers not be held responsible for the evil actions done by others.In the last verse the poet speaks of the presence of the Aṅgirases in this sacrifice, which suggests that the present priests now embody the legendary Aṅgiras priests, a claim implicitly made elsewhere as well. The appeal to Savitar, who is associated with the evening, and in verse 3d the reference to the All Gods, who in the later rite receive offerings at the Third Pressing, place this hymn in that soma-pressing. The identity of the “father” (vs. 3c) remains mysterious. Sāyaṇa identifies him as Varuṇa since Varuṇa and Mitra are the fathers of Vasiṣṭha (cf. VII.33.11–13), but there is little basis for associating Varuṇa here with either the Aṅgirases or the All Gods.1. We would be offenseless (a﻿́diti) sons of Aditi, and a fortress among gods and mortals, o Vasus.Winning (this) we would win, o Mitra and Varuṇa. Becoming (this) we would become greater, o Heaven and Earth.2.

Verses 1–2 emphasize their antiquity and the antiquity of the poetic cel-ebration of them, while verse 3 asks, as usual, for their gifts.1. I urgently invoke Heaven and Earth, the lofty ones worthy of the sacrifice, with sacrifices and acts of reverence,for the ancient poets who also hymned them set in front those two great ones whose sons are the gods.2.

It is divided into two parts by the meter (vss. 2–4, 5–8), but forms a conceptual unity. Verses 2–4 are addressed to a dog, presumably a watchdog barking in the night, who is urged to go to sleep. The dog is given a grand metronymic, “son of Saramā,” the legendary bitch of Indra, who on Indra’s behalf tracked down the cows stolen by the Paṇis and retrieved them, in the memorable dialogue hymn X.108.The next two verses (5–6) are an incantatory listing of each member of the house-hold, sending them all to sleep one by one (reminiscent of the modern American children’s book Goodnight Moon). The next verse (7) puts them all to sleep with the moonrise, with the final verse devoted to an intriguing set of unidentified women falling asleep wherever they happen to be. This fleeting picture of somnolent ladies reminds us of several similar famous scenes in much later Indian literature, such as the sleeping rākṣasīs in Rāvaṇa’s household in Laṅka in the Rāmāyaṇa (V.7.30–62, 8.30–46) and the sleeping women whose fleshy sensuality disgusts Siddhārtha, the future Buddha, in Aśvaghoṣa’s Buddhacarita (V.47–67).A number of fanciful scenarios have been devised, both ancient and modern, Indian and Western, as the backstory of this hymn, but this creative plotting seems unnecessary: the hymn can be simply enjoyed for itself.1.

It also shares a final verse with VII.34, a generic plea for the gods’ protection. But in content there is little in common between the two hymns.This hymn begins with four verses about the birth and identity of the Maruts, alluding both to their mysterious generation from Pr̥śni (see esp. vs. 4) and the para-dox that they are both identical (“belonging to the same nest,” vs. 1) and separate and rivalrous. This theme then disappears from the hymn, save for several refer-ences to their plural “names” (vss. 10, 14; we of course know them only under one name, “Maruts”). The rest of the dvipadā section (vss. 5–11) is essentially descrip-tive, of their power, beauty, and accoutrements.Although this celebration of the Maruts’ qualities continues in the triṣṭubh por-tion, there is also a significant ritual component, initiated in the first half of verse 12. Subsequent verses make clear what ritual is involved: in verse 14 it is said that they are worshiped at the beginning of the sacrifice, and they are invited to enjoy the House-offering; in verse 16 they are called “playful.” In middle Vedic ritual the third and last of the “Four-monthly” (Cāturmāsyāni) rituals is the Sākamedha,"},{"pageNumber":966,"pageContent":"VII.56949celebrated in the autumn. On the day before the Sākamedha day proper, the Maruts receive two oblations—thus, they are worshiped at the beginning of the sacrifice. Moreover, the second of these two oblations is the “House-offering” (Gr̥hamedhīya). And on the next day there is an offering to the “playful Maruts,” using the same word that describes their behavior in verse 16d. (For further refer-ence to the Maruts at the Sākamedha in this Marut cycle, see VII.59.9–10. On the ritual itself see, e.g., Hillebrandt 1897: 117–19; Keith 1925: 322–23.)As usual, offerings to the gods prompt us to ask for reciprocal benefits from the gods, and these requests occupy much of the remaining verses (17–24), with the final refrain verse (25) extending the requests to other gods as well. The last few request verses specific to the Maruts (vss. 22–24) ask for their help in battles over land and waters, alluding presumably to the Ārya expansion.1. Who, separately, are these anointed superior men who belong to the same nest—the young bloods of Rudra, possessing good horses?2. For no one knows their (separate) births.But certainly they know, mutually, each his own separate means of begetting.3.

The hymn begins with an invita-tion offered to the Maruts to the sacrificial “honey” (soma), an invitation phrased in a way very close to the English idiom indicating potential possession “has their name on it” (at least in our interpretation). They travel to the sacrifice and, having received the guest reception, are asked to sit on the ritual grass, to receive the obla-tion (vs. 2). The sacrifice is successfully concluded in verse 5, and their help and gifts requested. The last two verses (6–7) seem to be a summary of the ritual process—in 6 they are urged to come in pursuit of oblations, in 7 to come in order to give help in return—the two verses being unified by the opening “when praised.”Verse 4 is somewhat odd in a Marut context. Although it is common to beg the Maruts to keep their missile away from us (see, e.g., the preceding hymn, VII.56.9), the reference to an “offense” committed by us humans is more appropriate to a Varuṇa or Āditya context: see especially the use of the term in the Vasiṣṭha-Varuṇa hymns later in this maṇḍala (VII.86.4, 87.7, 88.6), since the Maruts are not usually associated with moral issues (though see vs. 5 in the next hymn, VII.58). Much more typical is the lovely description of the glittering Maruts in verse 3.1. Your honey has the name “Marut,” o you who deserve the sacrifice. At the sacrifices they become invigorated with its strength:they who set even the two wide world-halves to trembling, the mighty ones swell the wellspring, when they have journeyed.2. It’s surely the Maruts who take note of the singer, who lead forward the thought of the sacrificer.Sit on our ritual grass today, having been graciously received, to pursue (the oblations) at the rites of distribution."},{"pageNumber":969,"pageContent":"VII.589523. The others do not glitter like these Maruts here, with their brilliants, their weapons, their bodies.All adorned, themselves adorning the two world-halves, they smear a common unguent on themselves for beauty.4.

Let your most delightful favor rest in us.5.

When praised, o Maruts, come hither, all of you in your totality, with help to the patrons,who, possessing hundreds, strengthen us by themselves. – Do you protect us always with your blessings.VII.58 (574) MarutsVasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi6 verses: triṣṭubA description of the fearsome power of the Maruts, embodiments of the thun-derstorm, begins the hymn (vss. 1–2), but the topic turns to their power to help the poet and his patrons in verses 3–4, with the mythic model, their aid to Indra, invoked briefly in verse 4. In verse 5 the potential anger of the Maruts is men-tioned, and we seek to atone for whatever act occasioned it. Like the human offense punished in verse 4 of the previous hymn, VII.57, this moral tone is somewhat out of place in a Marut hymn. However, here the reference to the Maruts’ father, Rudra the punisher and healer, provides a better context for this scene of anger and atonement. The final verse (6) is a summary verse, referring to the performance in the immediate past of the praise hymn that constitutes the first five verses.1. Chant forth to the flock, grown strong all together, which has the power of its divine nature.They pound the two world-halves with their greatness; they reach to the vault from chaos, from propless (space).2. Even your birth, Maruts, (was attended) by turbulence, you fearsome ones, of powerful battle fury, unruly,"},{"pageNumber":970,"pageContent":"VII.59953who stand out because of their great powers and their strength.

Its length confirms this analysis, since the previous hymn contained only six verses.The first six verses consist of three pairs of pragāthas concerning the ritual ser-vice offered first to a collection of gods (vs. 1, probably vs. 2) and then particularly to the Maruts (vss. 3–6) and the benefits that accrue to the sacrificer. Vasiṣṭha names himself in verse 3. This six-verse sequence conforms to the numerical pattern of the Marut cycle and could have been original to it. The following two triṣṭubh verses (7–8) continue the same theme, though more vividly. In particular, in verse 7 the Maruts are compared to “dark-backed geese,” preening themselves in secret and then flying here. This may be a reference to how quickly storms can seem to arise, with thunderclouds fully developed (“preened in secret”).The last four verses are clearly late additions. They make reference to the Sākamedha rite encountered also in VII.56.14, the last of the Four-monthly rituals described in middle Vedic texts. In verse 9 the Maruts are called “descendants of the scorcher” (sā́ṃtapana), in verse 10 “sharers of the House-offering” (gŕ̥hamedha); at the Sākamedha the Maruts as Sāṃtapana receive an offering at midday, and in"},{"pageNumber":971,"pageContent":"VII.59954the evening as Gr̥hamedha. The final verse (12), in a different meter, is dedicated to “Tryambaka,” an epithet of Rudra. The Sākamedha ends with an oblation to Rudra Tryambaka.1. Whom you safeguard, o gods, and whom you lead right up here,to him—o Agni, Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman, Maruts—extend shelter.2. With the help of you, o gods, on a favorable day the one who has sacrificed crosses over hatreds.He furthers his dwelling place, ex(tends) his great refreshments, who does ritual service to your liking.3.

Your help in battles certainly does not desert him to whom you have granted it, o men.Your favor has turned here anew. Drive straightaway, you who desire to drink.5. You of ardent generosity, drive here to drink the stalks.Here are the oblations for you, o Maruts. Because I have bestowed them, don’t go somewhere else.6. Sit here on our ritual grass and undertake to give us coveted goods.O unfailing Maruts, you will exhilarate yourselves here on the somian honey—Hail!7. Surely even in secret they keep preening their bodies. The dark-backed geese have flown here.As a whole troop you have sat down all around me, like battle-lusty men, becoming exhilarated on the pressing.8. O Maruts, whoever, being evilly angry at us and at cross-purposes, seeks to strike us, you good ones,may he be fastened to the fetters of deceit. With your most scorching stroke strike him.9. You descendants of the scorcher, Maruts, enjoy this oblation here.(Come here) with your help, you who care for the stranger.10. Come here, you sharers of the House-offering—Maruts, don’t stay away—with your help, you of good drops.11.

We sacrifice to Tryambaka the fragrant, increaser of prosperity.Like a cucumber from its stem, might I be freed from death, not from deathlessness."},{"pageNumber":972,"pageContent":"VII.60955VII.60 (576) Mitra and VaruṇaVasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi12 verses: triṣṭubhThe opening four verses describe the rising Sun, who watches over the good and evil that people do. As such, he is the agent of Mitra, Varuṇa, and Aryaman, since they are the gods whose central character is to govern the actions of mor-tals. In verses 3–4 the poet blends the offerings that rise to the gods at dawn with the antelopes of the Sun that carry him aloft. These antelopes are “rich in ghee” (vs. 3), as the offerings would be. In verse 4 the “strengthening, honeyed ones” are primarily the offerings given to Mitra and Varuṇa, but juxtaposed to the Sun’s ascent and to the description of his antelopes, they also become reflections of these antelopes, lifting the Sun to the heaven. In 4cd the Ādityas clear a path for the Sun, and this image leads to the principal theme of the succeeding verses and of the hymn itself—the ability of the Ādityas to lead even through difficult circumstances. The Ādityas keep away those who oppose the truths they embody (vs. 5), and they guide even those who may not understand their truths (vss. 6–7). The “unwinking, perceptive ones” in 7a might be the gods themselves, although they could also be the spies of Mitra and Varuṇa, who are described in similar ways (cf. VII.61.3, 5) and who would be present both in heaven and on earth (cf. VI.61.3).If there is benefit in following the Ādityas, there is also danger in not doing so. The poet warns of the anger of the Ādityas (vs. 8), the hostility of Aryaman (vs. 9), the secret attack they can bring, and the hidden strength they possess (vs. 10). All this leaves the poet and his people “trembling” (vs. 10) before them. The sense of danger, either from those who do not follow the ways of the Ādityas or from not following those ways, is strongly articulated in the second half of the hymn. It is also here that the hymn designates Sudās, the king, as the special recipient of the Ādityas’ protection and mercy (vss. 8, 9). This may point toward a time in which the king and his people were trying to find and to establish a settlement after the normal period of migration and battle, a time that might well be one of particular peril.1. If today as you arise, o Sun, you who are free of offense will speak the truth [=that we are free of offense] to Mitra and Varuṇa,we would be (offenseless) before the gods, Aditi, and dear to you, Aryaman, as we sing.2. O Mitra and Varuṇa, this very Sun, who draws the gaze of men, rises up over both [=standing and moving beings] on earth—the herdsman of everything, (both) the standing and the moving, seeing the straight and crooked (acts) among mortals.3.

These are the avengers of much untruth, for they are Mitra, Aryaman, and Varuṇa.These have grown strong in the house of truth—the capable, undeceivable sons of Aditi.6.

Who by sacrifice will gain your favor for his formulation at the winning of victory’s prize and of the highest wealth,his generous patrons will strive to overpower the battle fury of the outsider.

In verse 2 the rising Sun parallels the voice of the poet, who raises his hymn to Mitra and Varuṇa. And just as the Sun fills the worlds with light, Mitra and Varuṇa penetrate all the worlds and even go beyond them. Like kings who send their agents into the communities to note what their subjects are doing and saying, Mitra and Varuṇa also have spies who are everywhere (vs. 3).The mention of these spies in verse 3 may help explain the most problematic verse in the hymn, verse 5. There are several ways to construe the verse: a﻿́mūrā víśvā could be vocative and nominative dual respectively, describing Mitra and Varuṇa as those who can never be fooled (so Geldner), but more likely they describe the drúhaḥ “deceptions” in 5c. As Oldenberg notes, grammatically dis-persing the phrase a﻿́mūrā víśvā(ḥ). . . imā́ḥ “all these who are never fooled” seems forced. But the idea that Mitra and Varuṇa themselves deceive has understand-ably given interpreters pause. Still, in X.109.4 Indra is said never to be deceived but himself deceiving (√dabh) and in the previous hymn, in VII.60.9c, Aryaman can bring “hostilities” against those who do not act rightly. The “deceptions” of Mitra and Varuṇa are probably their hidden spies. These spies are actually not seen and accordingly in this verse they are unidentified and hence verbally hidden. The verse even works a deception of its own, describing the spies in the feminine plural—spa﻿́śaḥ “spies” is masculine plural—and delaying the feminine term that stands for them, drúhaḥ, until pāda c.1. Upward arises the eye of lovely appearance that belongs to you two gods, o Varuṇa—the Sun, who has extended himself.He who watches over all living beings marks the battle fury among mortals.2. Truth-possessing, the far-famed inspired poet raises his thoughts forth to you, o Mitra and Varuṇa—he whose formulations you will help, o you of strong will, when you two will bring his autumns to fullness, as if by his will.3. (You have reached) past the wide (midspace), past the earth, o Mitra and Varuṇa, past the high heaven aloft, o you who bring good gifts.You have placed your spies among the plants and among the clans, guarding unwinkingly against him who goes his own way.4.

The antelopes of the Sun carry him up, as do the praise songs as they rise, and from heaven the Sun witnesses the deeds of humans and attests to the Ādityas and Agni the innocence of the sacrificers (vs. 2). In verse 3 the poet asks that Varuṇa, Mitra, and Agni bring them the highest arka﻿́. The primary meaning of arka﻿́ is “chant,” and therefore the first idea is that these gods will inspire the chant of the sacrificers. But arka﻿́ can carry a secondary meaning, “flame,” a sense that is actualized here through the description of the gods as candra﻿́ “glitter-ing” and by arcís “flame,” the latter etymologically related to arka﻿́ in this meaning. So like the Sun these gods will brighten themselves and also make bright the world of the sacrificers.In verse 4 three gods—Heaven and Earth and Aditi, the mother of the Ādityas—are addressed in pāda a, but the remainder of ab refers only to two gods, Heaven and Earth. The poet continues to address two gods in verse 5, revealing only in the last pāda that the two gods are Mitra and Varuṇa. Finally, in the last verse the poet matches the image of light spreading over earth and heaven that was introduced in the first verse with the “wide space” across generations and the freedom of move-ment that Mitra and Varuṇa will offer.Although the poet does not continue the strategy through the whole hymn, verses 1–2 have a striking number of sound repetitions.

Here the Sun becomes the visible sign and the embodiment of the Ādityas. He is the eye of Mitra and Varuṇa (vs. 1) and subha﻿́ga “bringing good fortune,” like Bhaga, the god Fortune (vs. 1). But the Sun is especially like the god Savitar, the “Impeller.” He is prasavita﻿́r, who “impels forth” (vs. 2); he takes the form of Savitar (vs. 3); and the people are impelled (prasūta﻿́) by him (vs. 4). The god Savitar especially drives living beings to their homes at night, so here the"},{"pageNumber":977,"pageContent":"VII.63960Sun assumes the complementary function of impelling them forth to their various daytime tasks.The Sun is also the fire common to all the Vedic peoples. He is the “common support of the sons of Manu,” creating a cultural or even possibly a political unity among them (vs. 1) and the “common wheel” (vs. 2), whose turning commences the day and the activities of the day. Representing Savitar, the Sun upholds the “com-mon institute” (vs. 3) that governs all the peoples.In verse 5b, the images of the herd and the falcon are puzzling. If the herd belongs to the frame as we have translated the verse, then it is probably the gods whom the Sun follows as they clear a road for him across the sky. On the other hand, if the herd is part of the comparison, then a hungry falcon might follow a herd of cattle because the cattle would attract birds, which could become its prey. Of course it is also possible, even likely, that the poem legit-imately allows both interpretations. See also IV.38.5, in which there are like uncertainties.1. Upward he rises, bringing good fortune and with his gaze on everything, the common support of the sons of Manu—the Sun,the eye of Mitra and Varuṇa, the god who has rolled together the shades of darkness like hides.2. And upward he rises, the one impelling the peoples forth—the great, undulating beacon of the Sun,about to turn the common wheel that Etaśa pulls, harnessed on the yoke poles.3. Gleaming forth from the lap of the Dawns, he rises upward, being celebrated by the husky-voiced singers.He appears to me as the god Savitar, who does not violate the common institute.4. The bright ornament of heaven, having a broad gaze, rises upward—he whose goal is in the far distance, gleaming as he crosses over (toward it).Now the peoples, impelled forth by the Sun, will go toward their goals, and they will perform their tasks.5. Where the immortals have made a way for him, he follows after the herd [=the gods?], flying like a falcon.When the sun has risen, we would worship you two with our acts of reverence and with our oblations, o Mitra and Varuṇa.6.

Geldner rightly sees the likelihood of a double reading of verse 1. The “cloaks of ghee” are butter offerings given to Mitra and Varuṇa, but at the same time they are rain that the Ādityas send in response to these offerings. So also in verse 4, the “ghee” that Mitra and Varuṇa should sprinkle on the composer of this hymn is rain. As a result of the rain, the dwellings of the sacrificers will prosper (4cd, 5c).As often, the middle verse of the hymn is more cryptic than the others. Mitra and Varuṇa are addressed, as is the devo﻿́ arya﻿́ḥ, translated here the “civilizing god” and referring to Aryaman. The point of mentioning Aryaman in such an indirect way is to create a verbal connection between the devo﻿́ arya﻿́ḥ and the arí, the “stranger” in pāda c. An arí is an outsider, but one who belongs to the Vedic peoples and fol-lows the customs of the Āryas. The point is that such a stranger will recognize the sacrificers as those who prosper because they follow the Ādityas and the ways of the Āryas and will honor them as sudā́saḥ “good givers,” generous people. But Sudās is also the Bharata king who figures very prominently in the Vasiṣṭha hymns, and, inescapably, this designation must recall him. That is to say, even one who belongs to another Vedic tribe will see that the sacrificers are “Sudāses” or like Sudās, the great king, in their prosperity and generosity.In verse 4, the “chariot seat” is the seat of honor here at the sacrifice, which is implicitly imagined as a chariot, as often elsewhere.1. You two who are masters of space in heaven and on earth—to you they should give cloaks of ghee.Mitra, well-born Aryaman, and King Varuṇa of strong rule enjoy our oblation.2. O you two kings, herdsmen of great truth, lords of the rivers, and rulers—travel here to this place.Send down refreshment to us and rain from heaven, o Mitra and Varuṇa, you of lively drops.3. Then let Mitra, Varuṇa, and the civilizing god [=Aryaman] lead us forth by the most successful paths,so that a (civilized) stranger will thereby speak of us as “good givers.” With gods as our herdsmen, might we find exhilaration by your refreshment!4.

It too is fundamentally a prayer for rain to Mitra and Varuṇa. There is no reference to Aryaman, although there is an indirect reference to his function as god of customs in the poet’s description of Mitra and Varuṇa as arya﻿́ “civilizing” (vs. 2a). Verse 4 most explicitly states the theme of the hymn. In pāda a the poet offers the gods oblations, which include ghee and other ritual liba-tions, and in b he asks for these in return, though in the form of rain. In c we read va﻿́ram “wish” twice, once in the phrase pra﻿́ti. . . va﻿́ram “at your wish,” referring to the wish of the gods for oblations, and second in the phrase va﻿́ram ā́. . . pr̥ṇīta﻿́m “fill our wish” for rain. Thus in both ab and cd, the poet first refers to the desire of the gods and then his own desire.The translation below also takes víśva “everyone” twice in the translation of verse 1, which, like the first verse of the preceding hymn, offers a possible double reading. According to the translation below, in pāda d Mitra and Varuṇa move “upon the course of everyone,” that is, they follow or accompany the actions of all beings. But yā́man “course” can also mean “entreaty,” and if construed with ācít “attentive,” the line could also mean, “moving on the course of everyone, attentive to the entreaty of everyone.”1. When the sun has risen, I call upon you two with hymns, upon Mitra and upon Varuṇa of purified skill,you two, who possess imperishable and preeminent lordship, you two moving upon the course of everyone, attentive to the entreaty of everyone.2. Because you two are lords of the gods and you two are civilizing, make our dwellings to be nourishing.Might we reach you two, Mitra and Varuṇa, where heaven and earth will swell and also the days.3.

The first three are three gāyatrī tr̥cas, followed by three br̥hatī/satobr̥hatī strophes and one more gāyatrī tr̥ca. The hymn then concludes with a final, single puraüṣṇih verse. Despite its metrical complexity, the hymn sustains its basic themes throughout. Once again this is a hymn recited at sunrise, and indeed the phrase “at the rising of the sun” occurs at the beginning of three of its seven strophes (vss. 4, 7, 12). Also the beginning of fourth strophe (vs. 14) contains a variant of the phrase, the final tr̥ca starts (vs. 16) with a reference to the rising of the sun, and the pragātha beginning at verse 10 opens with a mention of the sun. Therefore of the hymn’s eight units, only the first tr̥ca (vss. 1–3), which establishes Mitra and Varuṇa as the dedicands of the hymn, and the final summary invitation to Mitra and Varuṇa lack a reference to the rising sun in its first verse. This repeated mention of the rising sun is a structuring device that unifies the hymn despite the diversity of its meter. Thematically, the rise and movement of the Sun across the heavens becomes the representation of the Ādityas’ lordship extending across the world.The actions of the Ādityas are also linked with the words and action of the ritual. This theme is introduced at the outset, when they are described as suda﻿́kṣa “of good skill” and the children of Dakṣa, the embodiment of skill and specifically sacrificial skill (vs. 2). The gods sustain “the three divisions” (vs. 10), a phrase that likely refers both to the divisions of the world (earth, midspace, and heaven), and to the divisions of the ritual (the three soma-pressings). They also sustain the divi-sions of time (vs. 11): the year, month, and day, but also the sacrifice and the night, a division that could refer to the sacrificial rites by day and the continuation of the rites across the night. The Ādityas “impel” (√sū)—a word connected with Savitar, of course, and therefore with the Ādityas—the sacrificers and thereby bring their rituals success and take their worshipers “across difficult straits” (vss. 4–5)."},{"pageNumber":981,"pageContent":"VII.669641.

They also present problems of translation and interpretation that turn on the identity of the Aśvins’ chariot. Elsewhere the Aśvins’ chariot can be the sacrifice or the hymns of the sacrifice that bring the Aśvins to the rite. Therefore, the chariot in verse 1a is the vehicle bringing the Aśvins. In 1c “that which” the poet recites and “that which” serves as a messenger to awaken the Aśvins is the praise song, now become the Aśvins’ chariot carrying the Aśvins to the rite. In verse 4 there is no explicit men-tion of the chariot, but there is a complex ellipsis in 4a, which lacks both subject and verb. The gapped subject may be the chariot, but again the chariot as the hymn that seeks the Aśvins.The hymn itself continues to be the focus of the poet in verses 5–6. In verse 5 he calls upon the Aśvins to advance his insight so that it will win gain for the sac-rificers. While the poet previously mentioned the chariotry directly, here he refers to the hymn using the language of competition and prizewinning appropriate for a chariot. In verse 7 the poet also speaks of the “treasure,” the soma, which is offered to the Aśvins along with his hymn, and he shifts attention from his “thought,” which he offers to the Aśvins in the form of his hymn (vs. 1), to the Aśvins’ thought, which he hopes will not be hostile to the sacrificers. In the final two verses the poet appeals to the Aśvins to support his patrons, whose generosity and bounty he celebrates."},{"pageNumber":983,"pageContent":"VII.67966Structurally, the hymn forms a ring, since the infinitive jara﻿́dhyai “to awaken” and the verb a﻿́jīgar “he has awakened” in the first verse are answered in the last verse by the imperative ja﻿́ratam “awaken!” However, while the translation of the a﻿́jīgar is secure, the interpretation of neither the infinitive nor the imperative is certain. The form jara﻿́dhyai is a hapax in the R̥gveda, and it is not clear whether it is transitive or intransitive and, if transitive, who is being “awakened.” In the last verse, ja﻿́ratam might be from same root, although it also might be from a different root and mean “make old!”1.

In verse 3 the Aśvins come with the daughter of the Sun, Sūryā, which marks this as a morning hymn (cf. also vs. 9). In verse 4c the vípra “inspired poet” is likely the reciter of the hymn, but in 4ab the pressing stone also sounds as it crushes the soma stalks, and therefore it too could be the poet in the latter half of the verse. The stone prepares the soma offerings, so the reference to the oblations in 4c would also be appropriate to it.Then in the second set of four verses (vss. 5–8) the poet briefly describes great deeds of the Aśvins and four of the past figures whom they helped. In verses 6 and 8 the poet mentions the offerings of Cyavāna havirdā́ “the giver of offerings” and their summons (hūya﻿́māna) by Śayu, words that echo the present offerings (havís, 2b) and the calls to the Aśvins (ha﻿́vana, 2c).Verse 5 alludes to the story of Atri, who was rescued from the heat of a pit oven by the Aśvins and who received sustenance from them. That is to say, the Aśvins rescued him with food and from becoming treated like food. In this verse the poet refers to the “sustenance” (bho﻿́jana) and the “relief ” (oma﻿́n) Atri receives. Similarly, in I.116.8 the Aśvins give Atri “nourishment together with solid food” (pituma﻿́tīm ū́rjam) and in 118.7 they give “nourishment” and “relief ” (ū́rjam omā́nam). Geldner suggests that Atri receives from the Aśvins an elixir that restores him to life, but these descriptions suggest more mundane gifts of food and drink that saved Atri from starvation.In verse 7 Bhujyu’s evil-intentioned companions include his father, Tugra, who left him behind (I.116.3, 119.8). But somehow the Aśvins changed Tugra’s mind and rescued Bhujyu through Tugra, who, as the description yuvā́ku “seek-ing you” implies, was a worshiper of the Aśvins (cf. I.117.14). In verse 8 the poet refers to the Aśvins’ willingness to come to the rescue even of a “wolf,” of a bad person, who is “starving” (ja﻿́samāna). This applies to Śayu, since he was once"},{"pageNumber":985,"pageContent":"VII.68968“starving” (ja﻿́suri, I.116.22), but the Aśvins rescued him by making his sterile cow give milk.In the final verse (vs. 9), which is reminiscent of the first verse of the previous hymn, the poet alludes to the cow that the Aśvins swell in verse 8. Geldner under-stands the cow to represent the gifts that the poet receives from the sacrificer, but more likely it is the poem itself, which will yield good things for the poet. Note that the poem is the focus of 9ab, which refers to “good hymns” and “good thoughts.” The verb jarate, translated here as “awakens,” can also mean “sings,” and the hymn’s audience would surely have been aware of the double sense.1. Beautiful Aśvins, wondrous ones, journey here with your good horses, enjoying the songs of him seeking youand the oblations brought before you. Pursue our (offerings).2. The exhilarating soma stalks have come forth for you. As is right, come to pursue my offeringacross the calls of the stranger. Hear our (calls).3. O Aśvins, your chariot swift as thought rises forth across the airy spaces, bringing hundredfold help,speeding to us, o you who bring Sūryā as goods.4. When this stone—seeking the gods, pressing the soma—speaks aloft to you two,the inspired poet should turn you enchanting ones here by the oblations.5. Since you now have brilliant sustenance (for him), you two keep away the intense (heat) for Atri,who will receive relief from you, since he is dear to you.6. And again, Aśvins, this is your recompense to Cyavāna, the giver of offerings, who was growing old:that you two lay an ageless appearance on (him).7.

The poet opens with the chariot (ra﻿́tha) and refers to it, often explic-itly, in every verse. In verse 1 the poet describes their “golden chariot,” whose bril-liance reflects the morning light that accompanies its advent. The final pāda of the verse takes an interesting turn. The chariot is first called voḷha﻿́r “conveyor,” a term that ordinarily refers to the chariot driver (as in I.144.3d, VI.64.3d, VII.2.35c) or the horse that pulls a chariot (IX.81.2b, 96.15d, 112.4a). But here and in the simi-lar pāda VII.71.4a, it describes the chariot itself, attributing agency to it. But then the poet also calls—or appears to call—the chariot nŕ̥pati “lord of men,” which should describe the Aśvins themselves, as it does in VII.71.4. Geldner suggests that it could be a luptopamā, a comparison in which the particle of comparison has been omitted: “(wie) ein Fürst.” Renou (EVP XVI: 48) describes the figure as a sort of hypallage caused by the juxtaposition rátho nr̥patī in VII.71.4. Renou is likely right that the pāda responds to VII.71.4, but it rather appears to be a semantic expansion of the chariot so that it includes or rather becomes the horses that pull it and the drivers who direct it. Also in verse 3 the chariot again takes the role of a groom, “clasping the bride,” who is being carried on the chariot to her marriage. Behind this semantic expansion of the chariot, if that is what is occurring, may be the image of the Aśvins’ chariot as the sacrifice itself. Note that the chariot is described as “having tracks of ghee” (vs. 1c) and “three chariot-boxes” (vs. 2b), corresponding to the three soma-pressings. The chariot is not just the sacrifice, however. As usual, it remains the chariot that brings the Aśvins to the sacrifice, as well as being the sacrifice, at least in these opening verses.The theme of the journey of the Aśvins is marked by verbal derivatives of √yā “journey,” which appear in every verse except verses 4 and 7. These two verses refer to the great deeds of the Aśvins: how they brought the daughter of the Sun to her marriage, how they rescued Atri from the heat of a pit oven, and how they saved Bhujyu from the sea. The Aśvins’ chariot and thereby the theme of journeying are involved in all of these rescues.1. Let your golden chariot, ever pressing upon the two world-halves, journey here with those bulls, your horses—the (chariot) with tracks of ghee, gleaming at its wheel-rims, the driver of refreshments, the lord of men with prizewinning mares.2. Spreading over the five lands, yoked by thought, let it with its three chariot-boxes journey here—(the chariot) by which you two go to the clans serving the gods, as you set your journey toward any direction, Aśvins."},{"pageNumber":987,"pageContent":"VII.709703.

He is quite right: his hymn is complex, since it presents metaphors of unclear reference and ellipses of uncertain interpretation. Such intricacy is attractive to gods like the Aśvins, and the purpose of the poet is to get the attention of the Aśvins by means of the hymn and to cause them to take notice of the offerings and other elements of the sacrifice so that they will be present at it.In verse 1 the poet summons the Aśvins to take their place at the sacrifice, but 1cd, in which he describes the coming of the Aśvins, can be variously interpreted. In 1c something “stood” when the Aśvins took their place. We have suggested that this is the sacrificial fire kindled in the early morning, but other interpreters have offered other reasonable possibilities: the hot milk offered to the Aśvins (Oldenberg, Renou [EVP XVI: 49]) or the liquid offerings more generally (Geldner), the vessel"},{"pageNumber":988,"pageContent":"VII.70971for the hot milk (Oldenberg), the “good favor” mentioned in verse 2a (Renou), or the place itself (Geldner, Velankar [1963]). Of these, the gharma or hot milk offer-ing, which is mentioned in 2b, is the strongest possibility, and of course, the sup-pression of the subject in 1cd might have allowed hearers to recall several or all of these things that welcome the Aśvins.In verse 3 the poet shifts attention to the rewards that the Aśvins will bring. The sacrificer hopes to find prosperity for the sacrificer from the rivers, plants, and clans, among which the Aśvins find a place, over which they sit “at the peak of the moun-tain”—in heaven perhaps? In verse 4a the “plants and the waters” recall the rivers, plants, and clans of verse 3 and verbally connect the two verses, even though the poet again shifts the theme back to the sacrifice being offered to the Aśvins. Here the waters and plants represent sacrificial libations and offerings. In 4b it is not clear what are the “harness cords” (yogyā́). They might be rites or offerings (especially the hot milk offering), or hymns. That is, they are elements of the sacrifice of one kind or another. Whatever these cords are, the image carries forward the descrip-tion of the Aśvins in 2cd as “well-harnessed” horses and therefore should represent what attaches the Aśvins to the sacrifice. In 4cd the Aśvins reward the present sacri-ficers while keeping in mind the ancient ones. The present sacrifices are the equal to the ones of the past and therefore deserve the reward of the Aśvins.In the last verses the poet becomes more straightforward in calling the Aśvins’ attention to his hymn, his “formulations,” which he has sent out in search of them (vs. 7), and to the sacrifice which stands ready for them (vs. 6).1. Come to us, Aśvins, who grant all desires: this has been proclaimed as your place on earth.Having prosperity on its back like a prizewinning horse, it [=the fire?] stood up when you two sat down here as if (sitting) upon your womb to remain steadfast.2. The most delightful favor clings to you two. In the house of Manu has been heated the hot milkthat carries you, having been harnessed like a pair of well-harnessed swift steeds, across the seas and rivers,3. (Across) the places that you two have taken for yourselves, Aśvins, among the exuberant (rivers) from heaven, among the plants, and among the clans—(you two) sitting down at the peak of the mountain, (you two) bringing refreshment to the pious man.4. O gods, delight in the plants and waters when you will take on the harness cords [=the ritual acts?] of our seers.While granting many treasures to us, you two have kept in view the ancient generations.5.

The first verse marks this as an early-morning hymn. Since the ruddy light of early dawn is elsewhere associated with the ruddy cattle, the poet echoes that connection by describing the horses and cattle that the Aśvins bring. There is also a second possible reading: the two compounds a﻿́śvāmaghā[ḥ] go﻿́maghā[ḥ] “having bounties of horses, bounties of cattle” could be nominative plurals as well as duals and be taken as proleptic adjectives modify-ing the 1st-person “we.” This grammatical ambiguity can imply that the horses and cattle that the Aśvins bring will become the horses and cattle that we will have.In verses 1–2 the Aśvins are asked also for rescue from enemies, want, and dis-ease. In verses 3–4 the poet then turns especially to the chariot of the Aśvins, and, as often, the chariot is linked to the sacrifice itself. In 3c its horses are “in the harness of truth,” that is, joined to the hymns and even to the rites, which may also be expres-sions of truth. The chariot is also syū́magabhasti, an elusive hapax. Geldner among others connects ga﻿́bhasti “hands” to the rays of the sun, but there is no clear instance of such a use elsewhere in the R̥gveda. We propose, therefore, that the hands, which normally hold reins, have themselves become the reins (syū́man) of the chariot because they are the hands of the priests, who control the ritual. In verse 4 the analy-sis and reference of viśva﻿́psnya, perhaps “containing all milk,” are obscure. Geldner wonders whether the word might describe the praise hymn or Agni. The gharma vessel suggested here is uncertain at best. Verse 5 then returns to the Aśvins’ ability to save from danger by describing four great acts of rescue. The last, the rescue of Jāhuṣa, is the least familiar and can be only tentatively reconstructed. The best sug-gestion is that of Oldenberg, who says that by combining verse 5d and I.116.20cd we can get the following: Jāhuṣa was trapped by his enemies is a wild, rocky area, but the Aśvins brought him out and set him down on light, soft soil."},{"pageNumber":990,"pageContent":"VII.729731.

The urgent pleas that the Aśvins come here to this place, to this sacrifice and not to another, is reinforced by other words meaning “near” or “this way” (arvā́k, 2a) and “here” (a﻿́chā, 3d). Only verse 4 counters by opening with ví, here translated “forth,” but more exactly signifying “away, apart.” This verse shifts the attention to the spreading light of dawn (pādas a, c), which is matched in pāda d by the spreading light of the sacrificial fires and in b by the poetic formulations rising from the sing-ers. The last verse joins the expansiveness of verse 4 to the invitation to the Aśvins by describing the four directions in which the Aśvins are present and from which they can come to the sacrifice at the center."},{"pageNumber":991,"pageContent":"VII.73974The four directions and the implicit center in verse 4 are reflected in the “wealth belonging to the five peoples” (vs. 5c), that is, the wealth belonging to all the Vedic clans and tribes. This wish also suggests that this hymn is recited on behalf of one who sees himself, his tribe, or his clan at the center of the Vedic peoples. The Vasiṣṭha poet is not shy about pointing to his family’s connection to the center either, since he speaks of the familial formulations that “awaken” in order to bring the Aśvins (vs. 3ab).1. Journey here, Nāsatyas, by your much gleaming chariot filled with cattle, filled with horses.All your teams accompany you, having beautified your bodies with your eagerly sought glory.2.

All is ready for the Aśvins to con-sume the soma and the other offerings presented to them (2cd). In verse 3a the poet compares this sacrifice to a chariot speeding to the Aśvins. This image is answered in verse 4ab, which looks forward to the arrival of the va﻿́hnī, the “two chariot-horses.” The term can refer to the horses of the Aśvins, but it might also refer to the Aśvins themselves as chariot-horses (cf. VIII.8.12). But in either case the idea is"},{"pageNumber":992,"pageContent":"VII.74975that the fully prepared sacrifice races to the Aśvins, and the Aśvins, with or as fully equipped horses, race to the sacrifice. Again, in verse 4cd the poet draws attention to the ritual preparations made for the Aśvins and begs the Aśvins not to ignore his call and overlook his sacrifice. The last verse repeats the final verse of the preceding hymn. Here it is not so closely tied to the themes of the hymn, but it appropriately continues the plea to the Aśvins to travel from wherever they are to the sacrifice.1. We have crossed to the further shore of this darkness, aiming our praise song as we seek the gods.My song calls to those having many wondrous powers, foremost among many, born in the distant past, to the immortal Aśvins.2.

All three mention food, most often the soma (vss. 2d, 3b) or other nour-ishment (vs. 5b) that the Aśvins receive. But the poet also describes the nourishment that the Aśvins give (vs. 2a). The last two verses connect these two kinds of nourish-ment in the climax of the hymn. In verse 5 the poet pairs the nourishment that his patrons follow as they approach the Aśvins as a complement to the “glory,” their prominence in the social order, that they receive from the Aśvins in exchange. As a result these patrons become godlike—able to keep away “the wolf,” which represents danger (cf. I.174.10 of Indra), and swelling “with swelling strength” (śa﻿́vasā śūśuvuḥ; cf. VII.93.2 of Indra and Agni, VI.19.2 of Indra, and I.167.9 of the Maruts). The"},{"pageNumber":993,"pageContent":"VII.75976ability of the Aśvins to go to every clan (vs. 1d) likewise parallels the “man-protec-tors” (nr̥pātā́raḥ), or kings of the peoples, of the tribes consisting of clans.1.

The hymns share and recycle much of the same vocabulary and phraseology, and there are striking phonologically driven lexical responsions across hymns, which can unfortunately not be rendered in translation. What distinguishes the hymns from each other is their structure, which can be quite tightly organized and reinforced by verbal and grammatical markers. See, for example, VII.76.VII.75 (591) DawnVasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi8 verses: triṣṭubhThis Dawn hymn contains most of the usual Dawn themes: her immediate arrival, which awakens the world, her beauty and brightness, her daily journey, and, espe-cially, her bestowal of riches on her praisers.

Dawn, born in heaven, has dawned widely with her truth; revealing her own greatness, she has come here.She has uncovered the deceits, the disagreeable darkness; best of the Aṅgirases, she has awakened the paths.2. For our great good faring take note of us today; o Dawn, for our great good fortune provide (for us).Establish for us bright, glorious wealth that seeks fame—o goddess among mortals, belonging to the sons of Manu.3.

This"},{"pageNumber":995,"pageContent":"VII.76978structure is reinforced by tense usage: the verbs in verses 1–2 are all augmented aor-ists referring to the immediate past of today’s dawn; those in verses 5–7 are present indicatives and imperatives, stating general truths about the behavior of the dawns and the singers; while those in verses 3–4 are augmented imperfects (with one per-fect) referring to the distant past, which gave rise to the present situation.This structure defines verses 3–4 as an omphalos, and indeed these verses show clear omphalos features. Verse 3 contains the most intricate syntax in the hymn, while verse 4 concerns the Father’s finding of “the hidden light” in the Vala cave, the primeval model for each new dawn. Verses 3 and 4 are in reverse chronologi-cal order: the Fathers find the hidden light of Dawn in verse 4, and verse 3 then describes the subsequent time with the periodic return of the Dawn, eagerly pro-ceeding to the sacrifice as if to a lover, not moving slowly and reluctantly like a maiden leaving an assignation.The exact repetition in the inner ring mentioned above is not a static feature. It participates in what we have termed “poetic repair” (Jamison 2006) and therefore provides forward movement by setting up a puzzle that is resolved later in the hymn. The adjective ámardhantaḥ “not negligent” modifies “paths” in verse 2. The com-bination seems discordant, although the hearer can construct a meaningful read-ing: paths that are not negligent are those, properly maintained and “set in order,” that lead one where they are supposed to go. The application of “not negligent” to the priests in verse 5 is far easier to interpret: not negligent priests are those who properly perform the sacrifice every morning and therefore do not transgress the gods’ commandments that regulate the proper functioning of the cosmos, since by ritual logic the sacrifice causes the new day to dawn. The phrase in verse 5 thus “repairs” the more jarring one in verse 2, but the jarring phrase in verse 2 also forced the hearers to formulate a more complex conception.As so often, consideration of poetic structure gives depth to the apparently conventional expressions and images in this hymn, which recur in so many other descriptions of Dawn.1. The immortal light belonging to all people—he who belongs to all men, god Savitar, has propped that up.In accordance with his will, the eye of the gods has been born. Dawn has revealed the whole world.2. The paths leading to the gods have become visible to me—paths that are not negligent and are set in order by the good ones.The beacon of Dawn has appeared from the east. She has come here, facing west from her habitation.3. Those were the days: the many days through which, at the rising of the sun,you became visible, o Dawn—faring forth thence toward the east-facing (sacrifice), like (a maiden) faring forth to her lover, not like one going (home) again."},{"pageNumber":996,"pageContent":"VII.779794.

Although it lacks the intricate patterning of the immediately pre-ceding hymn, its simpler structure gives it a forward-moving urgency encoded in its deployment of verb forms. The first half of the hymn (vss. 1–3) opens with a perfect (ruruce “she has shone”) but thereafter consists entirely of aug-mented aorists (like vss. 1–2 of VII.76), with aroci of 2d almost forming a ring with the opening perfect form, built to the same root (√ruc). There is an abrupt change of verbal mood in verse 4, with a cascade of imperatives in the next two verses (4–5). The grammatical person also changes: the constant 3rd person of verses 1–3 is succeeded by 2nd person in the rest of the hymn. Thus the first half of the hymn describes the immediate arrival of Dawn, and in the second the poet addresses a series of eager commands to Dawn, who has just appeared in front of him. Two features tie the hymn together grammati-cally: (1) the abundance of present participles modifying Dawn in both halves, though more common in the first; and (2) the constant use of Dawn as subject. Except for 1c and the first half of the final verse (6ab) Dawn is always the grammatical subject. A glance at other Dawn hymns in this series shows that this uniformity is unusual.No doubt Renou’s remark concerned the “content” of the hymn, and it is cer-tainly true that there are no remarkable images or elaborate conceits.

In fact, there is, until near the end, little novel about this hymn. The most noticeable feature until the end is that the middle verse (3) refers to the dawns in the plural, though they seem to be immediately present, while the other verses have singular Dawn.But the most noteworthy aspect of the hymn is the striking hapax verb that opens the last half verse (5c): tilvilāyádhvam. This is a transparent denominative built to the adjective tílvila (V.62.7), but this only displaces the problem, as the meaning and derivation of this adjective are not at all clear, and its rhyming reduplicative"},{"pageNumber":998,"pageContent":"VII.79981formation (til-vil) deviates markedly from normal Vedic word formation patterns. The adjective is generally taken to mean “fruitful’ or the like and may be connected with the word tilá “sesame.” If so, the creation and abundant scattering of seed may be the intended meaning here, though this is only a guess. The English idiom used to translate this obscure word is meant to convey its special status in the diction of this otherwise unremarkable hymn.1.

Dawn’s association with the distribution of goods is also emphasized in the last three verses.1.

It is therefore likely to have been an addition to the collection, and the 1st-person plural subjunctive bhunájāmahai in verse 5 with the modernized -mahai ending supports this assumption. However, the themes and concerns of the hymn and the phraseology employed do not differ significantly from those that went before.1. She has appeared opposite, as she comes here dawning, the Daughter of Heaven.She unwraps the great darkness for seeing; the spirited one creates light.2. The sun sends the ruddy (cows) surging up all together, as that heavenly body itself goes up with his rays.O Dawn, just at your first flush and that of the sun, might we be united with what is apportioned.3.

The first is an invocation to Indra and Varuṇa to come to the rite and consists of verses 1 and 7–10. The second section and the heart of the hymn are verses 2–6, which describe the two sides of kingship that the two gods represent.Indra represents the king ruling during times of migration and conflict; Varuṇa represents the king ruling during times of settlement, ideally times of peace. In the"},{"pageNumber":1001,"pageContent":"VII.82984political structure of the Vedic period, different men may have been kings during these two times or, as we believe more likely, the same king may have exercised these complementary functions at different times of the year.In verse 2 the poet calls one of the gods samrā́j “sovereign king” and the other svarā́j “independent king.” While both terms can be used of both Indra and Varuṇa (cf. Schlerath 1960: 132–35), samrā́j is used especially frequently of Varuṇa and the Ādityas (cf. I.25.10; V.63.3, 85.1; VIII.25.7–8, 29.9, 42.1; X.63.5) and svarā́j frequently of Indra (cf. I.61.9; III.45.5; VIII.12.14, 46.28, 61.2, 69.17, 93.11). Therefore, despite Schlerath’s doubts, the “sovereign king” here is likely Varuṇa and the “independent king” Indra. Further, at least in this verse, the contrasting titles likely reflect the distribution of kingly functions between the two gods. Since the samrā́j governed the peoples and their divisions, he might be connected with times of settlement. Since the svarā́j was independent of other authority, he might be associated with times of conflict between separate clans, peoples, and rulers.However the relation between svarā́j and samrā́j is to be understood, the poet insists on the necessity of both kinds of king and both sides of kingship. Indeed, after contrasting the two gods in verse 2ab, the poet emphasizes their similarity (2cd) and their united action in ordering the world (3ab). In verse 3cd the actions of the ritual are blended with the gods’ cosmic functions. The two gods share Soma—here both the ritual drink and the god—who inspires their action and who therefore metonymically possesses the transforming power, the “cunning” (māyā́), by which they made the waters swell. The image of swelling waters is then metaphorically carried over to the hymns, which should likewise swell.In verse 4 the poet returns to the two periods associated with the two sides of king-ship: in 4a the poet and his people are moving in chariots at the time of conflict and migration; in 4b they are seated at the beginning of the period of settlement. But here, unlike verse 2ab, the poet does not explicitly distinguish between the two gods. Both gods are summoned at both times. In verse 5cd, however, he reintroduces their oppo-sition by connecting Varuṇa with settlement and Indra with movement. This alterna-tion between conjunctions and disjunctions underscores the mutual dependence of the different sides of kingship and the poet’s insistence that both gods are great.Verse 6 continues the contrast between Indra and Varuṇa in a fashion similar to verse 2, although the actions of the gods in 6cd are not entirely clear. Assuming that 6c refers to the action of Indra and possibly to the destruction of Vr̥tra and similar “obstacles,” then 6d describes the action of Varuṇa. As Renou (EVP VII: 83) notes, the verb pra﻿́ √vr̥ in 6d is rare, but appears to mean “ward off ” the attack of an enemy (cf. IX.21.2). Unlike the aggressive action of Indra in 6c, the action of Varuṇa is thus defensive. Perhaps he protects the individual settlements during times of peace from incursions from enemies who might threaten them. The two gods thus have complementary functions in their different contexts and the similarity between them is reflected in the singular o﻿́jas “power” (6b) that both possess.In verse 1 the poet is especially aware that his is not the most elaborate sacrifice offered, but he asks the gods to ignore what he sees as the overly showy rites of his"},{"pageNumber":1002,"pageContent":"VII.82985competitors and to come to his rite. While it may be plainer than other rites, it does not have the evil intent behind it that those rites have. Returning to this theme in the latter part of the hymn, verses 7–10, the poet pleads for the attention of Indra and Varuṇa. In verse 9 he recalls the competition for the gods’ favor and again asks the gods to hear his words, for his sacrifice will please the gods more than the words and rites of others.1. O Indra and Varuṇa, extend great protection to our rite, to our clan and people.In the contests might we conquer the one whose fore-offerings are long, who is overzealous—those of vile intent!2. One of you two is called a sovereign king [=Varuṇa]; the other an independent king [=Indra]. Indra and Varuṇa are both great, both bearers of great goods.All the gods in the furthest heaven have united power and strength in you two, o bulls.3. You two drilled holes for the waters by your power, and you two raised the preeminent sun in heaven.O Indra and Varuṇa, in the exhilaration of cunning (Soma) you made the depleted (waters) swell. Make our insights swell!4.

O Indra and Varuṇa, since you two created all these beings of the living world by your greatness,with peaceful settlement Mitra befriends Varuṇa; with the Maruts the other, powerful one [=Indra] speeds toward beauty.6. For the sake of (displaying) the great exchange-gift (of Indra?) and the vibrant might of Varuṇa, the two show the measure of enduring power belonging to him [=to each one], which is his own:the one [=Indra] overcomes the piercing (enemy) [=Vr̥tra?], who is no kin; with a few the other [=Varuṇa] wards off the greater.7. Narrow straits do not (come) upon the mortal, nor do difficulties, nor does burning heat from anywhere, o Indra and Varuṇa,to whose rite you two come, o gods, (whose rite) you two pursue, nor does a mortal’s crookedness reach him.8.

This battle was a key moment in Vasiṣṭha history, and the poet recalls this historic victory in order to extend it into the present. Now warriors allied with the Vasiṣṭhas are going forth in their quest for cattle (vs. 1). Looking on Indra and Varuṇa, who are present at the sacrifice, with their minds if not with their eyes and thinking of their close association with the two gods, the poet and his allies call upon the gods to help them. The cry to help Sudās in 1d replicates the call to which the gods responded before and sets the stage for the poet’s recollection of the Ten Kings’ battle.In verse 3 the poet re-enters the earlier battle and speaks as if he were part of it or speaks in the voice of those who were. In the person of the earlier Vasiṣṭha, he calls for help in the midst of the turmoil of battle. Then in verse 4ab he remembers that the gods did help Sudās, and in 4cd the poet returns to his present, calling on Indra and Varuṇa to hear him. Like the earlier Vasiṣṭha, the poet and his people confront enemies on every side (vs. 5ab), and therefore he calls upon Indra and Varuṇa to help at the critical time as they did before (5cd). The poet knows that others summon the gods as well (vs. 6ab), but in verses 6cd–8 he recalls that the gods chose to help Sudās and Vasiṣṭha and not the other kings and priests. In the end the sacrifices of these others were inadequate, and in the end the gods were present at the sacrifice of Vasiṣṭha (vss. 7–8). In verse 9 the poet distinguishes Indra and Varuṇa for the first and only time in this hymn. While the two gods may have different functions, both their divine functions apply to the poet’s present situation. Indra can bring victory to the poet and his people and Varuṇa can defend them.1.

This movement is marked by the repetition of pra﻿́ “forth” or “forward” in verses 1c, 3d, 4c, and 5b and by verbal forms such as invati “speeds” in 2a and -jūtaḥ “hastened” in 3c. The various kinds of movement involve the proffering of hymns and oblations and the answering progress of the sacrificers by means of the wealth and offspring they receive from the gods. There is also movement implied in the “speed” of the rule of Indra and Varuṇa (2a), which extends high and wide. In verse 2, verbally enclosed within this description of the extent of their rule (2a, 2d), are the “bonds” of the two gods (2b) and the anger of Varuṇa (2c), which show the menacing power of the gods to enforce their rule.Another characteristic of this hymn is verbal sleight of hand in verses 1 and 4. In verse 1 the “ghee-rich one” (ghr̥tā́cī) would normally described the sacrificial ladle, but, as Renou (EVP VII: 85) notes, it can also characterize the dhī́, the “insight” embodied in the hymn (I.2.7) or the “songs” (gíraḥ, VII.5.5). Because this “ghee-rich one” is held in the arms of the priests, hearers would think first of the ladle. But in 1d the “ghee-rich one” goes “by itself ” and “in its varying appearance.” These descriptions would fit the hymn, which flies to the gods with its varied sounds and words. The final line, therefore, creates for hearers an unexpected redefinition of the “ghee-rich one” and produces a double image of it as both ladle and hymn. As such, the “ghee-rich one” represents the “oblations and reverence” offered to the gods in 1b.Neither the translation nor the interpretation of verse 4cd is secure. The rela-tive clause in 4c surely describes Varuṇa, but śū́ra “champion” in 4d is more likely a description of Indra. So the normal relation between relative and main clauses suggests that the subject in 4d is Varuṇa (as Sāyaṇa understands it to be), but the content of 4d suggests that it is Indra. Moreover, there is a word play between minā́ti “confounds,” which ends 4c, and a﻿́mitā “immeasurable,” which opens 4d. They are not from the same root, although they sound as though they could be. The words thus create a verbal icon of simultaneous similarity and dif-ference. These ambiguities accord with the representation of Varuṇa and Indra as embodying different sides of kingship, which are nonetheless complementary and necessary to one other. As we read the lines, therefore, the two gods are separately characterized, but their separation is undermined by formal features that efface it.1. I would turn you two here to our rite with oblations and reverence, o kings Indra and Varuṇa.The ghee-rich one [=the ladle/hymn] (goes) forth to you two, being held (forth) in our arms.

Agni has a “face of ghee,” that is, he is both bright like ghee and receives oblations of ghee (cf. I.143.7, III.1.18, V.11.1, X.21.7). This prepares for verse 4, in which the poet asks that Agni be the Hotar of this rite, who will bring the oblations to Indra and Varuṇa. The last verse is also found as VII.84.5 but is less thematically connected to this hymn than it is to the previous hymn.1. While offering soma to Indra and Varuṇa, I will purify for you two an inspired thought free from anything demonicand with a face of ghee like the goddess Dawn.

Jamison (2007: 91–118) offers a detailed study of the hymns in this group and of the creation of the poet’s personality. Like the other hymns in this small collection, this poem centers on just two figures, the poet—Vasiṣṭha according to tradition—and the god Varuṇa, and Vasiṣṭha speaks personally, even confessionally with Varuṇa. Apparently Vasiṣṭha has been suffering from some kind of affliction, which, he has been told, is the pun-ishment of King Varuṇa for an offense. He begs Varuṇa to accept his offerings and repentance, to forgive his transgressions, which he says were not intentional (vs. 6), and to restore him to prosperity and health.The relationship between Vasiṣṭha and Varuṇa constantly shifts as the hymn unfolds. The literary strategy of the poem most clearly appears in its use of pro-nouns and other markers of person, as Jamison (2007: 96–100) shows in her analysis. Use of the 3rd person distances the speaker and the object, while addressing another as “you” is a token of closeness and presence to one another. The poet deploys these pronouns first to distance Vasiṣṭha and Varuṇa, then to bring them close, and finally to separate them once again. So in verse 1 Vasiṣṭha is absent because there is no reference to the speaker, and Varuṇa is distanced by the 3rd singular pronoun asya. His absence is mitigated only by fact that unaccented asya should be anaphoric and therefore might point to the previous presence of the god. Otherwise, the relation-ship between Vasiṣṭha and Varuṇa is completely broken. In verse 2 Vasiṣṭha is present (1st sg. in each of the four lines), and Varuṇa remains distanced. In verse 3 Vasiṣṭha is present once again (1st sg.) and Varuṇa is partly present: he is addressed in the vocative but he is also mentioned in the 3rd person. In verse 4 both Vasiṣṭha (1st sg.) and Varuṇa (2nd sg.) are present. Then there begins a retreat from their full presence to one another. In verse 5 Vasiṣṭha is less present (the 1st pl. generalizes rather than personalizes the speaker) and Varuṇa is present (through the vocative address and 2nd sg. imperative). This verse reverses 3, in which Vasiṣṭha was fully present but Varuṇa partly present. In verse 6 Vasiṣṭha is distanced (note especially sva﻿́ “one’s own,” not “my own”), and Varuṇa is present (through the vocative address). Again"},{"pageNumber":1008,"pageContent":"VII.86991this verse reverses 2, in which Vasiṣṭha was present and Varuṇa was distanced. In verse 7 Vasiṣṭha is present (1st sg.), but Varuṇa is distanced (3rd sg.). This partially reverses 1 insofar as Vasiṣṭha was absent there but is present here. Varuṇa remains distanced in both verses 1 and 7. The last verse (8), is a concluding, extra-hymnic verse, a coda that stands outside the main structure of the hymn.This analysis also shows the omphalos structure of the hymn. Verse 1 corresponds to 7, verse 2 to 6, verse 3 to 5, and verse 4 is the center. It is the thematic heart of the hymn because it is in this verse that the poet and the god are both present and pres-ent to one another. It also signifies the determination of Vasiṣṭha, who anticipates the resolution of his conflict with Varuṇa. Varuṇa will—perhaps even in the sense of “must”—proclaim what Vasiṣṭha has done, and Vasiṣṭha promises to make amends to the god to receive the god’s forgiveness. Although the hymn moves away from this encounter between Vasiṣṭha and Varuṇa, the last verse suggests that the problem has been resolved. Varuṇa has returned to the distance, but he and Vasiṣṭha now mutually support one another. Varuṇa has enlightened Vasiṣṭha (vs. 7c), and Vasiṣṭha ritually serves the god to his greater “wealth,” his power and glory (7d).In verse 2b the meaning of va﻿́ruṇe “within Varuṇa” may play on the possible ety-mological relation of va﻿́ruṇa and vrata﻿́ “commandment.” That is, “within Varuṇa” has the sense of “under, or in conformity with, the commandment of Varuṇa.” The poet wants to be no longer at odds with Varuṇa. At the same time the hope for closeness to the god or even for envelopment by the god, which is suggested in the phrase, looks forward to the increasing intimacy of Vasiṣṭha and Varuṇa. The state is both parallel to and contrasts with the situation in verse 6c where the elder is “within the misdeed of the younger.”In verse 4d, we read áva . . . īyām, from ava + √yā “make recompense,” instead of the transmitted but metrically faulty áva . . . iyām.1. Insightful are the races (of gods and mortals) through the greatness of him who propped apart the two wide world-halves.He pushed forth the vault of heaven to be high and lofty, (also) the star [=the sun] once again, and he spread out the earth.2. And together with my own self, I speak this: “When shall I be within Varuṇa?Might he take pleasure in my offering, becoming free of anger? When shall I, with good thoughts, look upon his mercy?”3. I ask myself about this guilt, o Varuṇa, wanting to see; I approach those who understand in order to inquire.Even the sage poets say the very same thing to me: “Varuṇa now is angry with you.”4. Was the offense so very great, Varuṇa, that you wish to smash a praise singer and companion?You will declare this to me, o you hard to deceive, o you of independent will!

Like the previous one, therefore, this hymn has an omphalos structure, organized around the central verse 4 and the words of the god himself. In hymns organized around a central verse, that verse is often the key to under-standing a hymn or the dramatic climax of the hymn, as it is, for example, in the previous hymn. But sometimes, as here, it is the most enigmatic verse of all. In 4a, as implied in the translation below, does Varuṇa know that the poet is wise and therefore will understand his cryptic words? Or does me﻿́dhira “wise” anticipate the wisdom that the poet will receive from Varuṇa’s words? In that case, we might rather say that Varuṇa spoke “to me (to make me) wise”? As Jamison (2007: 102–3) argues, the ambiguous placement of na﻿́ in 4c allows it to be taken either as a particle of comparison (“like”) or as a negation (“not”). As a result the pāda can mean either “he will speak (their names) like secrets,” that is, he will speak the names but he will do so only in a cryptic manner, or “he will not speak their secret (names),” that is, he will keep the secrets hidden. But most of all, there are the obscure words of the god in 4b: “The inviolable cow bears three times seven"},{"pageNumber":1010,"pageContent":"VII.87993names.” As often, the “cow” in this verse is speech (e.g., Thompson 1995: 20), and it is speech, or more specifically this hymn, that carries within it twenty-one “names.” These names may be similar to the three times seven “tracks” (padā́) in I.72.6, although these tracks too are also “secret” (gúhyāni) and therefore their reference unclear.There is one possible clue to the twenty-one names in the following verse. Verse 5 mentions three heavens and three earths “arranged in six” or “arranged in sixes.” That is, “six” could refer to the three heavens and three earths, and, if so, we should translate, “Three heavens are hidden within him, and below are three earths, form-ing an arrangement of six.” On the other hand, if ṣa﻿́ḍvidhānāḥ refers only to the three earths and if each of the three earths is arranged in six, then we would have eighteen earths and three heavens, which gives twenty-one, the number of “names.” In that case, the “names” might be tokens of the extent of Varuṇa’s rule.Returning again to verse 4, its last mystery is the “later generation” in 4d, which may refer not to a future generation of human beings but to humans as the “generation” of beings later than the gods. If so, then Varuṇa strives to instruct humans despite their limited capacities, perhaps well illustrated in our attempts to understand him.While verse 4 is the most enigmatic in the hymn, it is not the only mysterious one. We have already touched on the riddle of three heavens and three earths of verse 5ab. In verse 6a Varuṇa is like the sky, which drops to the horizon at the far distance where there is the river that surrounds the earth. Because he is like the sky that drops toward this river, he is called a wild animal (6b) that comes down to the water to drink and he is like the “bright drop,” which, as Geldner points out, might be the setting moon or sun or even the soma as it sinks into the waters with which it is mixed. In 6c Varuṇa is “of deep recitation.” The primary sense is probably that Varuṇa speaks profound words, but the compound is ambiguous and could also mean that Varuṇa inspires or receives profound praise-recitations. Verse 7 connects this hymn to the previous hymn and provides a persuasive reason to link the two hymns, as Jamison (2007: 103) has noted. In VII.86.2 the poet asks, “When shall I be within Varuṇa?” Here in verse 7 the poet gives an answer: when we are free of offense, then “we would be within Varuṇa.” That is, we would be in conformity with the vratā́ny a﻿́diteḥ “the commandments of Aditi,” the goddess representing offense-lessness, whose commandments are mentioned in 7c.1. Varuṇa dug the paths for the sun. Forward (went) the floods of rivers to the sea,(those) mares, like a surge sent surging, following the truth. He made great streambeds for the days.2. Your breath, the wind, roars again and again through airy space, like an ardent animal [=stallion], victorious in its pasture.(Here are) all your own domains, Varuṇa, between these two great and lofty world-halves."},{"pageNumber":1011,"pageContent":"VII.889943.

Three heavens are hidden within him, and below are three earths, arranged in sixes.The clever King Varuṇa created this, the golden swing in heaven [=the sun], for the sake of beauty.6. Like heaven, Varuṇa has descended to the river—he, the powerful wild animal, like the bright drop;he of deep recitation, who takes the measure of the airy space; he the king of what is, whose lordship offers good passage.7. Might we be without offense within Varuṇa, who will have mercy even on him who has committed an offense,as we obediently fulfill the commandments of Aditi. – Do you protect us always with your blessings.VII.88 (604) VaruṇaVasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi7 verses: triṣṭubhThis intricate and justly admired hymn has been widely anthologized and stud-ied. See especially the treatment of the hymn in Jamison (2007: 103–8) and Lüders (1951: 315–21). It is closely related to the two preceding hymns and likewise con-cerns the relationship between Vasiṣṭha and Varuṇa, delineating it in perhaps the most intimate fashion of any of these hymns.Vasiṣṭha speaks for himself in these verses, even though he begins in verse 1 by addressing himself in the vocative. Once again, the theme of the poem is the distance between Vasiṣṭha and Varuṇa that has been created by something that Vasiṣṭha has done. That Vasiṣṭha addresses himself in the 2nd person perhaps suggests not only his distance from the god but even, as a result, from himself. The meaning of this becomes clearer as the poem develops. In verse 2 Vasiṣṭha approaches the ritual fire during the night and in the face of fire sees the face of Varuṇa. This results in a vision of Vasiṣṭha and Varuṇa sailing together (vs. 3). Their goal is Varuṇa’s “swing,” which, as in VII.87.5, is probably the sun, which Vasiṣṭha hopes will dispel the dark-ness that surrounds him and his relationship with Varuṇa. This vision takes Vasiṣṭha back to the time when he and Varuṇa were close (vs. 4), when Varuṇa made Vasiṣṭha a seer (ŕ̥ṣi) and praise singer (stota﻿́r). The light imagery is most intense in this verse,"},{"pageNumber":1012,"pageContent":"VII.88995for the day Vasiṣṭha became a seer and praise singer was the “brightest day of days.” This memory of a time of perfect harmony between Vasiṣṭha and Varuṇa is the dra-matic and emotional climax of the hymn and not surprisingly occupies the central verse of the hymn, which like the two previous hymns has an omphalos structure.In verse 5 Vasiṣṭha returns from his vision and memory of better times to the unhappy present, in which he is no longer in the household of Varuṇa. But in verse 6 he continues to hope that, despite what he has done, the god will not hold his offenses against him, and will again offer him the protection that he once enjoyed within the house of Varuṇa. The poet keeps these offenses distant from himself by talking about the offender in the 3rd person (in 6ab), but then he refers to those who bear the guilt of those offenses in the 1st person (in 6c). Finally, in verse 7 the poet more confidently looks to Varuṇa’s forgiveness: he “will release his fetter” of punishment “from us.” As Jamison (2007: 107) has pointed out, both pādas a and c have present participles for which there is no grammatically appropriate noun. Logically they should describe “us”—and that logic is reflected in the translation—but the absence of an explicit reference to us generalizes that happy result and the possibility of reconciliation with the god.1. Present to generous Varuṇa a carefully preened, much-loved thought, o Vasiṣṭha,to him, the lofty bull who brings a thousand rewards—(you, Vasiṣṭha,) who will make near at hand the one worthy of the sacrifice.2. Now then, when I came into sight of him, I thought the face of Agni to be that of Varuṇa.When the sun is in the rock and darkness is master, may he lead me to see his wondrous form.3. When we two, Varuṇa and (I), will board the boat, when we two will raise the middle of the sea,when we two will voyage through the crests of the waters, we will swing on the swing for beauty.4. Varuṇa placed Vasiṣṭha on the boat. Skillful in his work, he made him a seer through his great powers.The inspired poet (made him) a praise singer on that brightest day of days for so far as the heavens, for so long as the dawns will extend.5. Where have these companionships of ours come to be, when previously we would have accompanied one another without wolfish hostility?O Varuṇa of independent will, I went into your lofty mansion, your house with its thousand doors.6. Varuṇa, though one be your very own dear friend and your companion, if he will commit offenses against you,may we, burdened with guilt, not pay for (the transgression) against you, you uncanny one.

It is in another meter, and Vasiṣṭha does not appear by name within it. Moreover, while the other three hymns of this collection refer to Vasiṣṭha’s unhappy state, this hymn more explicitly concerns an illness afflicting the speaker. It is an illness so serious that it could bring the speaker to the mr̥nma﻿́yaṃ gr̥ha﻿́m “house of clay” (vs. 1), the earth, in which the dead are buried.According to both indigenous commentators and contemporary schol-ars, the illness especially associated with Varuṇa is dropsy, on which see Zysk (1985: 59–61). The reference in verse 2 to the speaker as “inflated like a water-skin” could point to dropsy, as could prasphura﻿́nn iva, here translated “seeming to kick,” if it is interpreted as stumbling or as describing the water-skin as quiver-ing. But the evidence is not very firm.The last verse, which is in a different meter, brings the hymn closer to the preced-ing three hymns, since it lays the blame for the speaker’s condition on a violation of the commandments of Varuṇa, his dha﻿́rmā “ordinances.”1. O King Varuṇa, let me not go to the house of clay!– Be merciful, o you whose dominion is great. Have mercy.2. If I go, seeming to kick, inflated like a water-skin, o master of the pressing stones,be merciful, o you whose dominion is great. Have mercy!3. By my weakness of will I have gone against the current in every way, o bright one.– Be merciful, o you whose dominion is great. Have mercy!4. Though he is standing in the midst of waters, thirst has found the singer.– Be merciful, o you whose dominion is great. Have mercy!5.

This ritual purpose is announced quite clearly in the first verse, and, as often in Vāyu hymns, the invitation is followed by the god’s journey to the sacrifice. As often also in Vāyu hymns the poet makes productive use of the ambiguity between Vāyu’s “teams,” his wind-horses (see vs. 3), and ours, the poetic thought we deploy, and in verse 5 the priests and poets actu-ally become the horses that pull the chariot of the two gods.As befits the early morning setting of the ritual, Dawn is prominent in the hymn (vss. 3–4), with the latter verse alluding obliquely to the Vala myth associated with the primal dawn. The distribution of gifts and goods appropriate to the early morn-ing ritual is also prominent. In the early verses 2 and 3 there is promise of benefits for the sacrificer from the gods, a promise that in the last two verses (6–7) is actually fulfilled by the gifts made by the human patrons of the sacrifice. Indeed the patrons seem to be partly assimilated to the gods: they have the power to confer not only goods but sunlight itself (see vs. 6), and they share with the gods the repeated par-ticiple īśāná “having dominion over,” said of Vāyu in verse 2, of Indra and Vāyu in verse 5, and of the patrons in verse 6.1. The clear, honeyed pressed (soma-drinks) have been presented to you two by the Adhvaryus with desire for heroes.Drive, Vāyu; travel to our teams [=poetic thoughts]. Drink of the pressed stalk, to euphoria.2.

The first half of the hymn is both more miscellaneous and more obscurely phrased. True, verse 2 also issues the invitation to the two gods, but it is sandwiched between two verses with which it seems to have little in common.Verse 1 is variously interpreted, with its parts variously arranged in translation. In our interpretation it contains speculation about the prior existence of the gods and the beginning of ritual activity: the gods who now derive their strength from men’s sacrifices must have existed before the sacrifice began, the proof being that these gods created the dawn and the sun for both Vāyu, a god of the midspace, and for Manu, the first man and first sacrificer, under trying conditions. (A somewhat similar situation is depicted in VI.49.13, where Viṣṇu measures out the realms for “hard-pressed Manu,” another cosmogonic deed.) The creation of dawn would in turn allow the ritual process, the ritual day, to begin—and begin it does with the offering to Vāyu. Verse 3 is clearly a depiction of the sacrifice, but the referents of the various phrases are not entirely certain. Although most scholars consider Vāyu the subject of the first half-verse, on the basis of shared vocabulary we instead consider it a disguised reference to the soma and its usual accompaniment, cow’s milk. The soma drops then offer themselves to Vāyu. The first half of verse 4 complements the concerns in verse 1: in the first verse the time before the creation of the sacrifice by the gods is the subject of speculation; in 4ab the unbounded continuance of the sac-rifice is envisioned, for as long as men have the power to perform it. With these ends of the sacrifice demarcated, the offering to Indra and Vāyu in the here-and-now can proceed, and the simple invitation of the rest of the hymn is issued to them.1.

They are identified as thousandfold in the first and last verses of the hymn, forming a conceptual ring, and in the middle verse (3) the productive ambiguity of the word is exposed: the teams are not merely the wind-horses that bring Vāyu here, but also the many forms of wealth he brings to us in return for the sacrifice. The even verses (2 and 4) first make the invitation to the sacrifice clear and then express wishes for success both for the priests and poets and for the patrons.1.

The two gods are called “smiters of Vr̥tra” (vss. 1, 4) and “possessors of good maces” (Indra’s weapon; vs. 4); they “smite” (Indra’s activity) the enemy (vs. 5) and “drive” to the sacrifice (vs. 6; since Agni is kindled on the ritual ground, he has no need to drive to it). Moreover the theme is the winning of prizes (vā́ja) and their distribution, and the besting of opponents: this agonistic cast is more typical of Indra than of Agni. The last two verses (7–8) are addressed to Agni only, in his familiar ritual role, mediating between the sacrificer and the gods, including Indra. But even in these verses Agni’s own character is overlaid with that of other gods: for instance, in verse 7 he seems to be assimilated to Varuṇa and the other Ādityas in forgiving offenses.1.

There are two main themes, the varieties of poetic thought and its product, verbal praise, which the poets address to the two gods, and the hope that these gods will favor these poets over their rivals (see esp. vss. 3, 7, 8, 12).

Her distin-guishing characteristics are all associated with this physical nature: the power and beauty of her ever-flowing current, and the nourishment and riches it brings with it. She is often mentioned along with her sister rivers, as first among equals, and in this hymn (vs. 3) and the next (VII.96.4–6) also with her shadowy male coun-terpart Sarasvant.1.

The first three verses, dedicated to Sarasvatī, consist of a pragātha (vss. 1–2) of the usual type (br̥hatī alter-nating with satobr̥hatī), extended with a third verse in prastārapaṅkti (12 12 8 8). The"},{"pageNumber":1021,"pageContent":"VII.961004other three verses form a conventional tr̥ca, dedicated to Sarasvant, whose charac-ter seems little different from his better-known counterpart Sarasvatī. It is perhaps the identity of the “bachelors” in verse 4 that suggests that prayer to a male divinity would be appropriate. But the attribution of a “swelling breast” to this same male in verse 6 is distinctly odd; a nourishing, wealth-giving breast (using the same word stána) for suckling is attributed in I.164.49 to Sarasvatī, a more suitable figure by her gender.The phrase “both stalks” (ubhe﻿́ . . . a﻿́ndhasī) in verse 2 has occasioned much discussion, and in recent years some political and military conclusions have been drawn from one quite speculative interpretation of it—conclusions not justified by the evidence, in our opinion. Although most interpreters take the “two stalks” as referring to two different beverages, one of which is soma (the usual referent of singular a﻿́ndhas is the soma stalk), either soma and surā or soma and milk, some, following Grassmann, interpret the word as referring metaphorically to the two banks of the river. From this interpretation it is inferred that the Pūrus crossed the Sarasvatī and conquered the territory on the other side—a conclusive leap based on a shaky interpretation of this word. By contrast, we interpret the term on the basis of the twinned hymn VII.95, whose corresponding verse 2 states that Sarasvatī “milked out ghee and milk,” a liquid pairing that may well be referred to by the dual in verse 2 of this immediately following hymn.1. I shall sing a lofty speech: she is the lordly one of the rivers.Magnify Sarasvatī with well-twisted (hymns); with praises (magnify) the two world-halves, o Vasiṣṭha.2.

The hymn is more carefully structured than the random listing would suggest, however.First, as has often been discussed above, Hanns-Peter Schmidt (1968) has shown that Br̥haspati was originally an epithet of Indra in his priestly role and only gradu-ally split off into a separate god. As in IV.50 this divine history is recapitulated in part in the progress of this hymn, though in a different way from the earlier hymn. For most of the hymn only one of the divine figures is on stage at a time: verse 1 has Indra, verse 2 Br̥haspati, and Br̥haspati holds sway in verses 4–8. Even in verse 3, supposedly dedicated to both Indra and Brahmaṇaspati, the two are not depicted together, and in fact the phraseology seems designed to identify Indra as Brahmaṇaspati: the two-word phrase bráhmaṇas pátim “lord of the sacred formula-tion” in pāda b is, it seems, paraphrased with the defining relative clause of d, refer-ring to Indra: yo﻿́ bráhmaṇaḥ . . . rā́jā “who is king of the sacred formulation,” with “king” substituting for “lord,” thus superimposing the one on the other. What we are claiming here, then, is that in verses 1–8 the divine names Indra and Br̥haspati/Brahmaṇaspati refer to a single divine figure, Indra.But when the transparent designation Brahmaṇaspati recurs in verse 9, it is immediately preceded by the dual pronoun vām “you two”; there must therefore now be two divine addressees, and the split between Indra and his epithet has been effected. The last two verses (9–10) call upon them both, using dual verbs, pro-nouns, and vocatives quite insistently. It is because we consider bráhmaṇas páti- an epithet in verse 3 and a divine name in verse 9 that we have translated them differ-ently in the two verses. Notice also that Brahmaṇaspati, as opposed to Br̥haspati, is only found in verses also containing the noun bráhman “sacred formulation.”But the hymn has another divine presence, not named but clearly there, who complicates the identity problem even more. The entire hymn is set on the ritual ground; this scene is set at the very beginning, in verse 1, starting with the word yajñé “at the sacrifice” and continuing with a clear depiction of the locus of ritual offerings, where men and gods (including Indra) meet. But, in the middle verses mentioning only Br̥haspati (4–8), that god is described in ways extremely suggestive of Agni, the ritual fire: he sits on the womb (vs. 4); he is both bright and roaring (vs. 5), bright, golden, and good to enter (vs. 7), and most clearly, in the image of verse 6 he is dark below but possessed of horses like ruddy clouds. All of this phraseol-ogy has clear counterparts in descriptions of Agni. Thus, the divine figure Indra/"},{"pageNumber":1023,"pageContent":"VII.971006Br̥haspati is identified here in this ritual context with the ultimate ritually oriented god, Agni. This identification is found elsewhere; see especially V.43.12.It is noteworthy, but not surprising, that the usual mythological association of Indra/Br̥haspati with the Vala cave is entirely absent.1. At the sacrifice, at the seat of men (coming) from heaven and from earth, where men seeking the gods become exhilarated,where pressings are pressed for Indra, he will come at first for exhilaration and to vitality.2. We choose divine help. Br̥haspati holds himself ready for us here, o comrades,so that we might become without offense to the one who grants rewards, who is a giver to us from afar, like a father.3.

The two goddesses, the world-halves, begetters of the god, strengthened Br̥haspati with their greatness.Comrades, exert your skill for the one whose skill is to be besought.

The theme of the rest of the hymn is Indra’s close affinity with and unslakable desire for soma. Not only is it the regular ritual offering that he seeks daily (vss. 1–2), but it belonged to him from birth (vs. 3) and became his special substance after his first victories (vs. 5). The deeds and power of Indra are also celebrated. Intriguingly, his mother first proclaims his greatness (vs. 3): the mention of Indra’s mother, especially in connec-tion with soma, always tantalizingly alludes to apparently fraught family dynamics associated with Indra’s birth (see III.48 and IV.18). Verse 5, near the end of the hymn, repeats the proclamation of his deeds, using the formula sometimes found and expected at the beginning of a hymn (see, e.g., I.32.1, I.154.1), though not rare later in the unfolding of the poem.The poet, of course, wishes to profit from the battle-might soma inspires in Indra (vs. 4) and receive some of the spoils of his victories (vs. 6).1. Adhvaryus, offer the ruddy, milked plant to the bull of the settled domains.Better at finding a drinking hole than a buffalo, Indra travels everywhere, seeking a man who has pressed the soma.2. What you made your own dear food on a distant day, every day you desire the drinking just of that.Taking pleasure with heart and with mind, being eager, drink the soma drinks set out, Indra.3. On being born, you drank the soma for strength. Your mother proclaimed your greatness.Indra, you filled the wide midspace; through combat you made a wide realm for the gods.4. When you will set to fighting those who think themselves great, we shall overcome them, though they are exulting in their arms.Or when, Indra, with your superior men you will attack the defensive forces, with you may we win the contest that brings good fame.5. I proclaim the first deeds of Indra, proclaim the present ones that he has performed.When he overcame the godless magic powers, then soma became his alone.6.

Viṣṇu’s primary mythic exploit in Vedic is the “three strides” he made across the cosmos, measuring out, enlarging, and mapping the cosmic spaces. In middle Vedic literature and later, Viṣṇu takes the form of a dwarf when making these vast strides, but there is no trace of this notion in the R̥gveda.The first three verses of this hymn are addressed solely to Viṣṇu and allude to his establishment and fixation of the cosmic spaces, though without directly mention-ing his three strides. The first verse does sketch (in the second half) the three sepa-rate realms with which Viṣṇu is associated, an indirect reference to the three strides; but in verses 2 and 3 the action that creates the spaces is “propping,” an action more characteristic of Indra. However, in verse 3 Viṣṇu fastens the earth down with “loom pegs,” a homely device in a way. The word (mayū́kha) is found only one other time in the R̥gveda, in verse 2 of the late hymn X.130, where the creation of the sacrifice is likened to weaving. This verse is also noteworthy for Viṣṇu’s direct address to Heaven and Earth as he props them apart.The second three verses (4–6) are dedicated to Indra and Viṣṇu together, and though heroic deeds are attributed to both of them, the deeds themselves are ones assigned only to Indra elsewhere (e.g., the destruction of Śambara and of Varcin in vs. 5). It is not unusual in hymns addressed to dual divinities for the more dynamic mythology of one to be credited to both.The final verse is dedicated to Viṣṇu alone (Śipiviṣṭa being an enigmatic epithet of Viṣṇu found in the R̥gveda only in this and the following hymn), though the sen-timents of the verse are conventional. For further on the epithet, see the next hymn.1. O you who have grown with your body beyond measure, they do not attain to your greatness.We (only) know both your dusky realms of the earth; god Viṣṇu, you yourself know the farthest one.2.

Viṣṇu’s three strides are the subject of the following two, responsive verses (3–4). Verse 3d also introduces the theme of Viṣṇu’s name, which is the subject of the last two real verses of the hymn (5–6, since vs. 7 is merely a repetition of the final verse of VII.99). The enigmatic epithet śipiviṣṭa﻿́ found in the last verse of the last hymn (VII.99.7) is, as it were, interrogated in these verses. In verse 6 the poet, who boasts that he knows the hidden patterns, sets out to proclaim the god’s name, while addressing him as Śipiviṣṭa, and then asks in the next verse whether the god’s own proclamation of himself as Śipiviṣṭa was meant to be ignored or passed over. The poet then mysteriously alludes to two different forms of the god, which may (or may not) correspond to two different names. The hymn does not resolve these questions, perhaps leaving the shadowy figure of Viṣṇu to be fully developed in the ensuing centuries.1.

The number three is a recurrent theme: the “three speeches” of verse 1; the “triply layered” shelter and “triply turned” light of verse 2; the three heavens, three stages of flowing water, and three buckets of verse 4. There is also, as often with R̥gvedic atmospheric phenomena, gender ambiguity and gender shifting. The bull of verse 1 creates a calf as his embryo. In verse 3 an unidentified subject (though surely Parjanya) is sometimes a barren cow and sometimes gives birth. (The “he” of the translation is a necessary English compromise: the Sanskrit has no pronominal subject and therefore no gender identifier.) Later in that verse the father provides milk to the mother. As is often the case with R̥gvedic enigmas, it is"},{"pageNumber":1028,"pageContent":"VII.1021011likely that there is no one correct answer to the riddles, which are instead meant to stimulate creative speculation.1. Speak forth the three speeches with light at their front, which milk this udder milking out honey.Creating the calf, the embryo of the plants [=Agni], as soon as he is born the bull sets to bellowing.2. The one who is the increaser of plants, who of the waters, who, as god, holds sway over the whole moving world,he will extend triply layered sheltering shelter, triply turned very superior light to us.3.

Although there has been much debate about whether this hymn satirizes priests by comparing them to frogs or instead is to be taken with deadly seriousness, the truth no doubt lies somewhere in between. The poet obviously took great delight in his skill at match-ing frog behavior with ritual behavior and is unlikely to have been unaware of the potentially comic aspects of the comparison; however, the explosive fertility of the frogs provides a model for similar increase in the human sphere, and therefore the comparison has a serious purpose.Attention to modern studies of animal behavior allows us to see just how much careful observation of frogs lies behind the depiction of the frogs here, and understanding anuran mating habits deepens our understanding of the poem. (See Jamison 1993.) For example, the frog lying “like a dried-out leather bag” is a coun-terintuitively accurate representation of a frog in estivation: some really do go dor-mant and dry up during the dry season, and “adding water” plumps them up and revives them. Once revived, the chorus of frogs begins, the purpose of which is to draw female frogs to the males, who are vocalizing, for mating. This antiphonal chorus is described in verses 2–6. Since the calls of different species are quite dis-tinctive (as sketched in vs. 6), the different cries serve to attract conspecific females to the appropriate male. The actual mating posture of frogs is described in verse 4: it involves the male approaching the female from behind and grasping her firmly for as long as it takes—which for some species can be quite awhile (days or weeks).Another important aspect of the hymn is its comparison of the frog chorus to a pedagogical situation (see esp. vss. 3, 5), in which the father/teacher speaks and the pupils exactly repeat his utterance. This is the clearest and earliest depiction of pedagogy in ancient India and is an example of how our knowledge of everyday life at that time must be obliquely won. The most famous word in this hymn is found in verse 3, the phonologically aberrant akhkhala (underlying the so-called cvi-formation, akhkhalī-[kŕ̥tya]). On the one hand, it would take a very austere interpreter, and a killjoy, not to recognize this as an onomatopoetic imitation of a froggy sound; on the other hand, in the inspired analysis of Paul Thieme (1954), this is, in Middle Indic guise, a representation of the word akṣara “syllable.” What the frog pupils are doing is “making syllables,” that is, repeating the utterance of the teacher verbatim, as sound, not meaning. This is a pedagogical technique that endures to this day in traditional Vedic learning. It is also telling that the word akhkhala is in Middle Indic form, as the everyday language of the R̥gvedic poets, and especially of their wives and children, had most likely already undergone many"},{"pageNumber":1030,"pageContent":"VII.1031013of the phonological and morphological changes characteristic of Middle Indic, but only found in preserved texts from a much later period. Instruction of the young, as well as most ordinary conversation, was no doubt carried out in this language rather than in the high Vedic Sanskrit of the hymns.As for the ritual application, the Pravargya rite occurs after a year-long con-secration, like that referred to in verse 1 and brought to an end in verses 7–9. The most salient feature of the Pravargya is the offering of the gharma drink, referred to specifically in verses 8–9, the heated milk-offering that boils until it overflows. The last, and most important, implicit comparison between frogs and priests turns on this ritual offering: the prodigious discharge of eggs after anuran mating, especially by many pairs simultaneously, must have reminded the poet of the frothy bubbling overflow of the boiling milk. And since the thousands of eggs released are a tan-gible sign of fertility and increase, the frogs are seen as assuring increase for us as well, in the final verse (10), culminating in the “Pressing of Thousands.”Oldenberg suggests that that this hymn was added at this point in the Maṇḍala, just after the two Parjanya hymns (VII.101–2), because of the presence of Parjanya in the first verse. It is certainly appropriate for the rainy season.1. Having lain still for a year, (like) brahmins following their commandment,the frogs have spoken forth a speech quickened by Parjanya.2. When the heavenly waters have come to him, lying like a dried leather bag in the pond,like the bellow of cows with their calves, the call of the frogs comes together here.3. When it has rained on them, who are yearning and thirsting, when the rainy season has come,saying “akhkhala” [/repeating syllables] like a son to a father (at lessons), one goes up close to the other who is speaking.4. One of the two grasps the other from behind, when they have become exhilarated in the discharge of the waters,when the frog, rained upon, has hopped and hopped, and the speckled one mixes his speech with the green one.5. Once one of them speaks the speech of the other, like a pupil that of his teacher,(then) a whole section of them speaks as if in unison, when you of good speech speak amid the waters.6. One of them has a cow’s bellow, one a goat’s bleat; one is speckled, one green.Bearing the same name but different forms, they ornament their voice in many ways as they speak.7.

Not a praise hymn, it calls upon a series of gods and other powers to destroy all manner of threats to us, in all manner of creatively bloodthirsty ways. It therefore has more in common with what we might term the “instrumental” hymns of the Atharvaveda than with the R̥gvedic manner, and it is in fact found in almost identical form as Atharvaveda Śaunaka VIII.4 and in Atharvaveda Paippalāda XVI. The relentless focus on the elimination of evildoers and the changes rung on the methods of destroying them can give an impression of homogeneity, despite the number of different gods called on (mostly Indra and Soma, but with a number of others interspersed: see the Anukramaṇī ascriptions above).Nonetheless smaller divisions can be discerned within the hymn as a whole. The mood is set by verse 1, with no fewer than eight violent imperatives addressed to Indra and Soma, urging action against the wicked. The first five verses follow the same pattern: an initial vocative índrāsomā “o Indra and Soma,” followed by imper-atives addressed to those gods. The sixth verse starts the same, with the vocative, but continues somewhat differently: rather than ordering the gods to unleash their powers in yet another way, the poet expresses the hope that his own thought (and its verbal expression) will envelop the gods like horse-tackle. This prayer-offering"},{"pageNumber":1032,"pageContent":"VII.1041015and the sacred formulations (bráhman) that Indra and Soma are urged to quicken in pāda d brings the brutal first section to a more benign and R̥gvedic conclusion.Verse 7 is also addressed to Indra and Soma, also in the vocative, but with the vocative postponed till the beginning of the second half of the verse. This slight change in structure allows this verse to serve as a transition to the next subsection, which continues, in our opinion, through verse 11 and is defined by a ring provided by the preverb práti “against, in response to,” opening 7a and 11c. Though the demands for action continue in this section, they take a more personal turn. In the first section, the gods were simply ordered to destroy evildoers; in this section the target is evildoers who act against us (as the práti signals). These verses all posit an innocent victim (usually 1st person) of the malefactor who is to be destroyed by the gods. Moreover, the avengers are no longer just Indra and Soma in tandem; each verse has a different designated hitter: just Indra in 8, Soma in 9, Agni in 10, and the gods in general in 11. The nature of the offenses has also become more sharply defined, in that the transgressions involve evil or false speech (even the “cheat” of vss. 10–11 means literally “desire to deceive”). Although evil speech and hostility to sacred speech were already found in verse 2, these linguistic offenses were only some of the condemned activities in the first section; they are the only ones here.In the two next verses (12–13), speech, true and false, is foregrounded, and the punishment of the speaker of falsehood is reassuringly affirmed. But the mood changes abruptly in verse 14: the speaker seems to stand accused of the very offenses he called upon the gods to punish; the innocent 1st persons of verses 7–11 are the objects of Agni’s anger. The aborted conditional clause of 14ab seems to convey the speaker’s distress. In verses 15–16 the speaker swears a dramatic oath concerning the truth of his denial and calls down further destruction on the man who falsely accused him. The accusation is that he is a yātu(dhā́na), a “sorcerer.” The speaker’s ringing assertion of his innocence and his powerful curse against his accuser brings this section of the hymn to a resounding conclusion.Indeed, we are of the opinion that the rest of the hymn was simply tacked onto what precedes because it concerns sorcerers, using the same word yātu, and simi-lar demonic beings. The tone of the remainder (vss. 17–25) is very different, with the theme of true and false speech recessive. The enemies are sorcerers in various animal forms, and the sense of personal menace and of human evildoing is almost entirely absent. Nonetheless, even if we are correct that these nine verses were origi-nally independent, the fact that the full hymn was transmitted independently in the R̥gveda and both recensions of the Atharvaveda would indicate that the join was made early.The Indian tradition (and many Western commentators, including Geldner) reads Vasiṣṭha’s biography into the dramatic middle of the hymn, interpreting the accusation and denial in verses 15–16 as evidence for the hostility between Vasiṣṭha and Viśvāmitra found in much later texts. In this interpretation Viśvāmitra is the accuser, and Vasiṣṭha the outraged 1st-person speaker.

Within each group, the hymns are organized by divinity and meter and length of hymn. As noted in the general introduction, two poetic lineages predominate, that of the Kāṇvas, especially in the first two-thirds of the maṇḍala, and that of the Āṅgirases in the last third, although the Anukramaṇī attributes some hymns to poets belonging to neither lineage and in addition Kāṇva hymns appear in the Āṅgirasa section and vice versa. The Kāṇva/Āṅgirasa identifi-cation links Maṇḍala VIII with Maṇḍala I, where poets of these families are promi-nent. Inserted in the middle of the maṇḍala are the apocryphal or “half-apocryphal” Vālakhilya hymns (VIII.49–59), appearing between the sixth and seventh anuvākas of the maṇḍala. Although these were supplements to the R̥gveda collection, they were transmitted with it and transmitted with accents, unlike the other khilāni, the other appendices to the saṃhitā text. For further on the structure and affiliations of VIII, see especially Oldenberg (1888: 209–19) and Hopkins (1896).Many of the hymns in VIII are made up of strophes consisting of two or three verses (pragāthas and tr̥cas respectively), in various meters. Quite long hymns can be thus assembled, and there is often more coherence within the strophes than between the strophes. These strophic structures were especially associated with the sung portions of the ritual, whose principal priest in the classic śrauta ritual was the Udgātar, the priest of the Sāmaveda, into which many of the verses of Maṇḍala VIII were borrowed. Thus the VIIIth Maṇḍala seems to have a liturgical function somewhat separate from the rest of the saṃhitā.Unlike the rigid divinity order in the Family Books, where Agni hymns always precede Indra hymns, the ordering within the hymn groups is more various, with Indra often leading off. Indeed Indra is the dominant god of the maṇḍala: of the ninety-two non-Vālakhilya hymns, exactly half, forty-six, are dedicated to him alone, with a further two to Indra and Agni jointly. Moreover, six of the eleven Vālakhilya hymns are Indra’s, in addition to a joint Indra-Varuṇa hymn. Agni is, by con-trast, rather muted in the book: only fourteen hymns belong to him alone. The Aśvins are relatively well represented, with eleven hymns and parts of several oth-ers. The Ādityas also have a presence, with three hymns to them as a group, one to Mitra and Varuṇa, and one to Varuṇa alone, as well as a substantial part of the "},{"pageNumber":1037,"pageContent":"VIII.11020composite hymns VIII.42 and 101 and of the All God hymns VIII.27 and 83. The Maruts receive three hymns, Soma two (of the few Soma hymns outside of IX), but the minor gods are almost invisible in this maṇḍala except in incidental mentions in All God hymns.There are many high points and striking features in this sprawling maṇḍala, of which we can mention only a few. From a ritual point of view, VIII.31, which treats the household pair, provides the only clear R̥gvedic mention of the Sacrificer’s Wife, whom we consider a ritual innovation in late R̥gveda. Another likely sociocultural innovation, the explicit organization of the three Ārya varṇas, the social classes of brahmin, kṣatriya, and vaiśya, is obliquely referred to in the trio of hymns VIII.35–37. On the mythological side, the story of Indra, Viṣṇu, and the Emuṣa boar, found in later brāhmaṇa texts, is mentioned several times in this maṇḍala, with a fairly coherent account of it given in VIII.77. Perhaps the single most striking hymn in VIII is the Apālā sūkta, VIII.91, in which a barely pubescent girl conducts a private soma sacrifice for Indra. A particularly beautifully structured hymn is the All God riddle hymn, VIII.29. Finally, one of the most salient features of the maṇḍala is the number of dānastutis, including some of the most notable in the R̥gveda.Although the first five hymns of VIII (VIII.1–5) are attributed to a variety of poets, as Oldenberg discusses (1888: 214) they appear to belong together because of the simi-larity of the names of the poets assigned by the Anukramaṇī, the regular appearance of a dānastuti, and the connection of the names of the Kaṇvas and Priyamedhas.VIII.1 (621) Indra (1–29), Dānastuti of Āsaṅga (30–33), Āsaṅga (34)Pragātha Kā ṇva (formerly Pragātha Ghaura, brother and adoptive son of Kaṇva) (1–2), Medātithi Kā ṇva and Medhyātithi (3–29), Āsaṅga Plāyogi (30–33), Śaśvatī Āṅgirasī, wife of Āsaṅga (34)34 verses: br̥hatī, except satobr̥hatī 2–4, triṣṭubh 33–34The structure of this hymn is metrically complex; indeed Oldenberg despairs of it. It begins with two pragāthas (vss. 1–4, br̥hatī alternating with satobr̥hatī) and ends with two triṣṭubhs (vss. 33–34). In between are twenty-eight br̥hatī verses, whose organization is unclear. Oldenberg is inclined to assume an overall tr̥ca structure, which has been disturbed—and indeed some of whose verses have been lost, as he believes. Geldner, on the other hand, sees paired verses (continuing the pragāthas of 1–4) in verses 5–20, tr̥cas in verses 21–29 and the dānastuti (vss. 30–33), with the final verse (34) falling outside these structures. It is also important to note that this hymn violates one of the principles of arrangement in the VIIIth Maṇḍala, whereby within each poet’s collection all hymns to the same deity are grouped together in order of descending number of verses: our VIII.1 has thirty-four verses, whereas"},{"pageNumber":1038,"pageContent":"VIII.11021VIII.2, also to Indra, has forty-two. This discrepancy is one of the pieces of evi-dence that led Oldenberg to suggest that some verses had been lost in VIII.1.In any case the metrical particulars do not help in discerning the thematic struc-ture. The one indisputable fact is that the last four verses (30–34) stand apart from the rest of the hymn: verses 30–33 form a dānastuti, and the striking final verse (34) belongs to the same level of colloquial discourse as the three immediately preceding verses and may in fact be part of the dānastuti (see below). The rest of the hymn is devoted to Indra, but there is very little sustained praise of the god and almost no mythology (apart from a few glancing references in vss. 11 and 28). Most of the Indra portion falls roughly into the genres of “journey” hymn and invitation to the soma sacrifice, but as often in Indra hymns there is concern that Indra will go elsewhere for his soma. The first ten verses develop this theme, but with somewhat slangy language (e.g., “having it both ways,” vs. 2; “keep crisscrossing,” vs. 4) and with an intimate and almost teasing approach to the god, as when the poet in verse 5 promises that he won’t “hand over” Indra even in return for a great sum. But the anxiety that Indra will pass by his sacrifice is clear, especially in verses 3–4, 7; this theme recurs in verses 13–16, and, even in the following verses devoted to the soma preparation and the god’s response (17–22), in verse 20 the poet expresses his fear that he might anger Indra with his importunings. The themes of the journey and the invitation to soma are repeated once more in verses 23–27, and verse 27 ends with a strong affirmation that Indra will come to our sacrifice, thus ending the repeated doubts expressed earlier in the hymn. Two more verses (28–29), paired by their repeated fronted pronouns, bring the Indra part of the hymn to a close.Thus the hymn keeps circling around certain topics, while other common fea-tures of Indra hymns such as mythological references are absent; nonetheless, there is little in the way of formal structure or organized presentation. Moreover, the striking turns of phrase found in the earlier parts of the hymn are less frequent in the later parts, with one exception: verse 12. This baffling verse is found also in the Atharvaveda in the wedding hymn (AVŚ XIV.2.47). It seems to depict Indra as a wondrous physician, in most interpretations: without even touching it he sticks together a breach, perhaps a wound, which was perhaps made by a missile, before the missile, if that’s what it is, pierces through to the collarbones. The translation given here is provisional, and it is not at all clear to us why the verse is found in this hymn or what it really refers to.The dānastuti (vss. 30–33) is notable for a number of reasons, not least that it mentions several different patrons. The “praises of the gift” are characteristically obliquely expressed. But the oddest verse in the hymn, and indeed one of the oddest verses in the R̥gveda, is the final one, verse 34. In it a woman (identified as Śaśvatī by the Anukramaṇī, but we prefer to take that word as an attributive adjective) expresses happy surprise at the sight of the penis of an unidentified man. There is no context for this vignette of sexual encounter with its snatch of provocative direct speech. The later tradition (Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra XVI.11.17, Br̥haddevatā VI.41) consid-ers the female to be the wife of Āsaṅga, the patron mentioned in the immediately"},{"pageNumber":1039,"pageContent":"VIII.11022preceding verse (33), who had become a woman but was turned back into a man thanks (according to the Br̥haddevatā) to the poet Medhyātithi. But this explanation seems a desperate makeshift and the complex gender switching entirely invented. It seems more likely that the verse belongs to the dānastuti, and in an even more oblique expression than those that precede it, it “praises the gift” of a woman to the poet (women are often mentioned as part of the poet’s spoils: see the final verse of the next hymn, VIII.2.42) by alluding to the enthusiastic response of his new prize to his sexual advances. (The poet thereby also obliquely praises his own equipment.)1. Don’t praise anything else! Comrades, don’t do yourselves harm.Praise only Indra the bull when (the soma) is pressed, and right now pronounce your solemn recitations—2.

The discrepancy in length between the two hymns is one reason Oldenberg suggests that VIII.1 may have lost verses in transmission. (See the introduction to the preceding hymn.)As indicated by the Anukramaṇī, the majority of the hymn is devoted to Indra, with the final verses a dānastuti; however, despite the Anukramaṇī’s division, the dānastuti must begin with verse 40, not 41, both because of the tr̥ca division and on grounds of content and tone. In the Indra portion the focus remains almost exclusively on the preparation of soma in its various forms, and the hope that Indra will come to our sacrifice, drink of our soma, and reward us. As often in such hymns, there is a journey component (esp. vss. 19, 26–28), and underlying the calls to Indra to journey to our sacrifice is the worry that Indra will stay away from our sacrifice because of anger or the appeals of other sacrificers (vss. 5–6, 19–20). There are also some slight indications that the hymn is concerned with a ritual innovation being introduced in some of the R̥gvedic clans, the Third Pressing, which takes place in the evening and involves soma mixed with milk. There are two occurrences of the word ā́śir “milk-mixture” (vss. 10, 11; see also 9b [ā́śir is also found twice in VIII.31, which also seems to contain refer-ences to Third Pressing]), and verse 18 seems to imply that the gods themselves are not satisfied with a soma sacrifice that ends with the Midday Pressing. The emphasis on the number three (esp. vss. 7–9, 21) may also support this interpretation, as may the hope expressed that Indra will not spend his evening away from us (vs. 20).Aside from the thematic unity of some of the tr̥cas (e.g., vss. 7–9 on the three types of soma), this long first section of the hymn has little apparent structure, and it is also notable for its lack of mythological reference (beyond a few token men-tions of Vr̥tra, vss. 26, 31, 36). But throughout this section there are unusual simi-les (e.g., vss. 6, 12, 17, 19, 20) and turns of phrase, including some untranslatable grammatical and lexical puns (as in vs. 3). The loose texture and the lightness and transparency of the meter also help to make it an appealing piece.The dānastuti (vss. 40–42) is, as often, hard to interpret. In verse 40 the actor seems still to be Indra, who in the guise of a ram had some sort of interaction with Medhyātithi: the language here is unclear, and although there are various treatments of Medhātithi (sic) and Indra as ram in the Brāhmaṇa literature, these seem desper-ate attempts to make sense of the fleeting and mysterious reference here. Though it"},{"pageNumber":1043,"pageContent":"VIII.21026appears to be Indra who is addressed in a subordinate clause in the 2nd person in verse 40, the 2nd person reference has shifted in verse 41 to Vibindhu, apparently the human patron. Perhaps Indra’s generosity is being superimposed on this human patron. The final verse, 42, like the final verse of the dānastuti in VIII.1 (vs. 34), con-cludes the hymn with a sexual innuendo: two “daughters of joy” (a phrase that goes neatly into French as filles de joie “prostitutes”) have also been given to the poet. These may indeed be two women, but since they are called “milk-strong,” it is quite possible that the poet is referring to the two breasts of one woman. If so, this verse responds directly to VIII.1.34, where the woman of the poet praises his member, and recalls IV.32.22-24, with a likewise disguised reference to the breasts of a woman given to the poet in payment for his verse.1.

The Indra portion is arranged in stan-dard pragāthas, while the dānastuti is metrically more varied. The verse pairs of the pragāthas are for the most part internally unified, but like many of the longer hymns in VIII there is not much apparent structure in the hymn as a whole. There are, however, several recurrent themes: the greatness (mahimán) and vast power (śávas) of Indra (e.g., vss. 4, 6); the gods and poets who have previously celebrated Indra and have been helped by him (e.g., vss. 7–9, 16); and the sheer noise made by Indra’s praisers (e.g., vss. 3, 7, 16, 18). In the context of all this previous poetic activity, verses 13 and 14 raise anxious questions about what constitutes the proper topic of praise poetry and how to configure these praises anew, the perennial prob-lem of the R̥gvedic bard.The dānastuti is far easier to interpret than those of the previous two hymns: the patron Pākasthāman is celebrated for his gift of a particularly fine sorrel horse, given also by Indra and the Maruts. The first half of the last verse (24) seems to contain an adage, or adapted piece of folk wisdom, as a foil to further praise of the patron in the second half of the verse. The verse itself has a slight Pindaric ring.1. Drink of the sap-filled pressed (soma).

However, there is less inter-nal cohesion in the verse pairs, but more discernible structure in their arrangement in the hymn. As noted in the Anukramaṇī the hymn falls into three major sections: the longest (vss. 1–14) devoted to Indra, the next (vss. 15–18) to Pūṣan, and the last (vss. 19–21) a dānastuti. The Indra portion opens with a pragātha (vss. 1–2) listing many"},{"pageNumber":1049,"pageContent":"VIII.41032possible sacrificers that Indra might visit, and urging him to come to the Kaṇvas here. The next four pragāthas (vss. 3–10) form a ring composition, with verses 3/4 and 9/10 matched to each other: Indra as a thirsty animal coming to drink (3a, 10a) and his assumption of supreme power (4d, 10d). The remaining two pragāthas in this section (vss. 11–14) command the Adhvaryus to press soma for Indra. The actual content of the Indra section is conventional: praise of his powers and his help for mortals, invita-tions to journey here and drink the soma, with the invitation becoming more insistent toward the end. There are almost no mythological references (though the enigmatic first pāda of 8 seems to refer to the same event as III.32.11, where Indra wears the earth on his hip), and the usual pleas for gifts are essentially absent, replaced by indi-rection: descriptions of pious men who benefit from Indra.The Pūṣan section (though the Anukramaṇī offers a choice of Indra or Pūṣan as the deity, it is clearly Pūṣan) makes the requests for gifts overt, and it serves as a transition to the dānastuti proper. The penultimate verse of the Pūṣan section (17) in fact seems to refer to a different Kaṇva poet, Pajra Sāman (see VIII.6.47), who has his own gifts to praise—as our poet turns to his own in verse 18, apparently sequestering his share of the cattle in a different pasture. The dānastuti (vss. 19–21) is fairly straightforward in its first two verses, but the final verse (21) is entirely opaque, at least to these translators.1. When, Indra, you are being called forward or back, up or down, by men,you yourself, propelled by men, are many times in the company of the descendants of Anu, are in the company of Turvaśa, you vaunter.2.

Come here!3. As a thirsty buffalo goes down to a salt-pocket made by water,come swiftly here to us in friendship [/in the morning], in the evening. In the company of the Kaṇvas, drink up!4. Let the drops exhilarate you, bounteous Indra, to give largesse to the presser.Having stolen the pressed soma, you drank it in a cup. (Then) you assumed this most superior might.5.

Many pādas in the hymn have exact or near counterparts elsewhere.The hymn begins not with the Aśvins but with the appearance of the (unnamed) Dawn (vs. 1), as a lead-in to the Aśvins’ early morning journey. Throughout the hymn the two gods are urged to drive here to our sacrifice, with occasional mentions of the sacrifices they should pass over on their way to ours (esp. vss. 13, 15). They are also begged for the usual assortment of wealth in goods and livestock; their “refreshments” (íṣ) are especially insistently hoped for (see vss. 5, 9, 10, 20, 21, 31, 34, 36). There is almost no mythological material, little mention of the miraculous rescues that are the Aśvins’ stock in trade. Brief allusions to two of these exploits are found in verses 22–23, and the bare names of a number of their clients are listed in verses 25–26.The last three verses (37–39) are a dānastuti praising the gift of one Kaśu, lord of the Cedis. His previous, fairly modest, gift is mentioned in verse 38, with the hope that the Aśvins will have the opportunity to see a more magnificent version in verse 37. And in verse 39 Kaśu is implicitly challenged to make an unparalleled gift, so that other men will not win greater praise for their generosity.1.

It is thus not surprising that the hymn is not a tightly structured creation, but a fairly loose collection of three-verse units treating various aspects of Indra. Nonetheless, certain themes are threaded through the hymn, in particular the Kaṇvas’ role in strengthening Indra through their poetry. This is strongly articulated in the first tr̥ca (vss. 1–3), in which the poet Vatsa himself claims this role in verse 1, alongside his ancestral family in verses 2–3. This last verse contains the striking assertion that the Kaṇvas’ praise is their “familial weapon,” which they “speak”—an image developed in verses 7–8, where the Kaṇvas’ insights are blazing missiles. In the next tr̥ca (vss. 10–12) the poetic “I” (presumably Vatsa) speaks of his poetic heritage. The tr̥ca consisting of verses 19–21 implicitly identifies the verbal products of the Kaṇvas with the physical obla-tions of the sacrifice. (And pāda 20c contains a particularly opaque simile, whose"},{"pageNumber":1055,"pageContent":"VIII.61038meaning we are uncertain of.) Once again, in two adjacent tr̥cas (31–33, 34–36) the Kaṇvas’ power to strengthen Indra by poetry is celebrated in straightforward terms. The last tr̥ca before the dānastuti (43–45) begins with another mention of the Kaṇvas’ activity.Interspersed among the Kaṇvas’ self-glorifications are tr̥cas of straight praise for Indra. Tr̥cas 2 (vss. 4–6) and 5–6 (vss. 13–18) celebrate Indra’s might and his victories, especially over Vr̥tra, and could be taken as examples of the Indra-strengthening praise-poetry that the Kaṇvas attribute to themselves. The later Indra-oriented tr̥cas (22–24, 25–27, 37–39, 40–42) are more concerned with the sacrifice, the invita-tion and journey to the soma, and the goods and help the sacrificers hope to obtain from Indra. In the midst of these is an enigmatic tr̥ca (vss. 28–30), which seems to suggest a connection between the primordial birth of the god (Indra? Soma?) and the origins of poetic inspiration.The hymn ends with a three-verse dānastuti, which, for a change, is far easier to interpret than the hymn to which it is appended.1. Great Indra, who is like rain-bearing Parjanya in might,has grown strong through the praises of Vatsa.2. They (are) guiding the offspring of truth [=poem] safely across, when they bring it forward—the conveyors,the inspired poets, by the conveyance of truth.3. The Kaṇvas—when by their praises they have made Indra the one who assures success to their sacrifice,they are speaking their own familial weapon.4. To his battle fury the clans and all the communities bend down together,like the rivers to the sea.5. That might of his flared when Indra rolled upboth worlds together like a hide.6. With his mace of a hundred joints, with the ram, he split apartthe head of raging Vr̥tra.7. These insights (bellow out)—we bellow out—again and again toward (you) at the forefront of the inspired words,(the insights that are) missiles, like the blazing of fire—8. Since, though they are hidden, the insights blaze forth by themselves—the Kaṇvas (blaze forth)—in a stream of truth.9. Might we attain to this, Indra: to wealth in cows and horses,and to a sacred formulation to be first in your thought.10.

This is one of only three Marut hymns in VIII (with VIII.20 and VIII.94). As with most Marut hymns, this one contains considerable description of the effects on the cosmos of these embodiments of storm and of their journey through the midspace: the bowing of the mountains, the violent winds and rain, the roaring. These descriptions are found primarily in the first part of the hymn (e.g., vss. 2–5, 7–8) and toward the end (see esp. vs. 34, with its bowing mountains forming a ring with vss. 2 and 5). The middle portion of the hymn (approximately vss. 11–21) expresses our desires for their presence at our sac-rifice and for their gifts, with the last two verses (20–21) posing anxious ques-tions concerning the whereabouts of the Maruts and the loss of their attention. This anxiety returns in two further question verses, 30–31, which preface the Maruts’ final journey to the place of sacrifice, where they are praised together with Agni (vss. 32–26).Verses 22–26 present various fragments of mythology; particularly striking, and baffling, is verse 26 with its mention of the poet Uśanā and the “loins of the ox,” which may be a glancing reference to the Vala cave.Like other long hymns in VIII the structure of this one is quite loose. However, it does have at least a sketchy ring: in addition to verses 2/5 and 34 mentioned above, note the references to meter in the first and last verses (1 and 36). It is char-acterized also by recycling of vocabulary, by rhetorical repetition (see, e.g., vss. 6, 9, 17, 22–24), and by frequent phonetic figures (a particularly nice one is found in 28ab: . . . pŕ̥ṣatī ra﻿́the / pra﻿́ṣṭir . . . ro﻿́hitaḥ)."},{"pageNumber":1059,"pageContent":"VIII.710421.

His composition is monotonously one-note: “Come/drive here to us” is found, with few variations, in the first seven verses and in a number of later ones (10, 11, 14, 17, 19); the Aśvins are urged to leave wherever in the cosmos they find themselves (e.g., vss. 3–4, 7, 14), in order to come to our sacrifice, and the usual anxieties about competing sacrificers who might tempt the gods to pass us by are on view (vs. 8). The poet’s uncertainty about the location of the Aśvins and his desire to lure the gods to his sacrifice and away from his com-petitors are summed up in the final verse (23), with its paradoxical presentation of the “three footsteps” of the Aśvins, which are both visible and hidden. The evocation of Viṣṇu’s three strides is probably deliberate, but the reasons for it unclear.There is little other content in the hymn beyond the urged journey, the offered sacrifice, and the expressed hopes for bounties in exchange. Verse 10 briefly and obliquely alludes to the maiden Sūryā’s mounting of the Aśvins’ chariot, from the well-known myth about Sūryā’s marriage, and the names of some successful clients of the Aśvins are listed in verses 20–21.1.

However, as Oldenberg points out (1888: 151), save for the tr̥ca composed of verses 10–12, all these differently named meters are composed of combinations of eight- and twelve-syllable pādas, which combine easily and without confusion, and several tr̥cas consist of a single meter (anuṣṭubh vss. 7–9, 16–18).As in the previous hymn, the poet identifies himself several times as Vatsa (vss. 1, 6, 15); the Anukramaṇī’s ascription to Śaśakarṇa (“Hare-eared”) may be taken as a nickname or simply a fanciful invention, as it has no verbal support in the hymn.The contents of the hymn are both as various as its meters and, underlyingly, as harmonious. Certain expressions recur throughout the hymn (half-verse initial ā́ nūna﻿́m “here and now,” alternating with simple ā́ “here”; repeated ya﻿́d and ya﻿́d vā “when”/“or when”; repeated pra﻿́). The poet focuses on asking the Aśvins for aid and protection, and offers sacrificial service in return. A tr̥ca late in the hymn (vss. 16–18) is addressed to Dawn in her relation to the Aśvins, a connection that fixes the ritual time of at least that part of the hymn as the Morning Pressing.1.

Unlike the tr̥ca structure of the last hymn, this one is arranged in pragāthas, the first two of which (vss. 1–4) are irregular, while the last (5–6) has the familiar br̥hatī/satobr̥hatī alternation.The hymn is a distillation of one of the key themes in the much longer Aśvin hymns that precede it (VIII.8–9).

Compared to earlier hymns in the cycle it is both brief and, as Renou points out (EVP 13: 147), elementary. Nonetheless it is a pleasing composition, with adroit deployment of contrastive terms, such as “mortal/god,” and of parallel structures, such as “to be X-ed at Y” (vss. 1, 2, 10—the last also providing a simple ring).1.

All but the last of these hymns (VIII.18 [Ādityas]) are dedicated to Indra and arranged properly by descending numbers of verses.VIII.12 (632) IndraParvata Kāṇva33 verses: uṣṇih, arranged in tr̥cas.R̥gveda VIII.12 is tightly structured: the meter is uṣṇih (8 8 12), and in each tr̥ca the last four syllables of the final pāda form a refrain, which is, however, syntacti-cally integrated into the verse. The last two tr̥cas before the final one (vss. 25–27, 28–30) expand the four-syllable refrain to full pāda length (that is, the final twelve syllables), which retards the verbal progress and hints at the end to come. The long refrain of verses 25–27, “just after that your two beloved fallow bays waxed strong,”"},{"pageNumber":1068,"pageContent":"VIII.121051echoes the short refrain of the second tr̥ca (vss. 4–6), “you have waxed strong,” and thus hints at a ring composition as well.The verb form shared by those two refrains (“waxed strong,” root vakṣ) is found elsewhere in the hymn, as are synonyms (root vr̥dh: “grow strong, make strong, increase”) and near synonyms (“spread,” “swell”), and this verbal material pro-vides the thematic spine of the hymn. Otherwise there is a mixture of mythological material, especially toward the end, and invitations to and descriptions of the sac-rifice. In the final tr̥ca (vss. 31–33) the poet announces the launch of his own hymn, that is, the hymn to which this tr̥ca forms the end, and asks for the usual bounties from Indra.1.

The theme of growing and making strong found in VIII.12 is continued here, however—notably in the first tr̥ca (vss. 1–3) and that formed by verses 16–18, but also generally throughout the hymn. There are also less insistent links between different parts of the hymn (e.g., the tree branches of vss. 6, 17), and some pleasing turns of phrase, like the “sea of the stalk” (vs. 15) referring to a particular large vessel of soma.Mythological material is mostly lacking in the hymn, and what is found is given perfunctory treatment (see the allusions to the Maruts in vss. 20 and 28–29). The focus instead is the usual give-and-take of the ritual compact.

Two tr̥cas in the hymn are devoted to Indra’s great deeds: verses 7–9 to the splitting of the Vala cave and the supporting of the heavenly realms, verses 13–15 to several different exploits, most notably the decapitation of the demon Namuci (vs. 13). Though Namuci is mentioned several other times in the text, this is the only place in the R̥gveda that refers to the later story of Indra’s trick-ery directed against Namuci: pledging not to slay him with anything dry or wet, he used seafoam as his weapon. (The earliest clear version of this tale is probably that in Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā IV.3.4, but it is recounted in several other Brāhmaṇa texts and into epic and Classical Sanskrit. See M. Bloomfield [1893: 143–63]. For a pos-sible indirect reference in the R̥gveda, see I.104.3.)The gāyatrī meter and tr̥ca structure, combined with the conversational tone of the opening verses, give this hymn a light texture and informal style that contrast nicely with the more ponderous Indra hymns in the early parts of Maṇḍala VIII."},{"pageNumber":1074,"pageContent":"VIII.1410571.

It asserts the dominance of Indra over all the cosmos (esp. vss. 2–6), and conversely the contribution the cosmic entities and the various other gods make to Indra’s power (vss. 7–10). The final tr̥ca (10–12), with its coda apparently addressed to Soma (vs. 13), seeks to harness all Indra’s powers for victory for our side, and thus echoes the poet’s opening charge to his comrades (vs. 1). The return to the beginning is also signaled by a ring-compositional device: the first two pādas of verse 11 are almost identical to those of verse 3 in the Sanskrit, though their translations diverge somewhat.Both the language and the structure of this hymn are straightforward, but its relatively simplicity avoids the banal by the deft balancing of the powers in the two contrastive sections of the hymn and the unembellished grandeur of the rhetoric.1.

Although the hymn is certainly full of actual praise of the deity, it also repeatedly refers to invoking, praising, singing to, and giving recognition to Indra and his pow-ers and deeds—in other words, to the delivery of the praise itself. Perhaps related to this feature is the noteworthy fact that Indra is in the 3rd person throughout the hymn, until the direct address and requests of the final verse (12). The constant 3rd-person reference is emphasized by regular fronting and incantatory repetition of 3rd-person pronouns referring to Indra (see, e.g., vss. 5–6, 8–9) and of his name (see, e.g., vss. 7, 9, 11).As for the content of the praise, it focuses on Indra’s power in warfare, where separate peoples vie for his aid. Yet, despite the battle theme, the descriptions are surprisingly devoid of violence, and it is Indra as maker of space (from constric-tion, vs. 6) and light (from darkness, vs. 10) and as the verbal advocate for his clients (vs. 5) who stands out.1. Start up the praise anew with songs to the sovereign king of the separate peoples, Indra,the man who overpowers men, the most munificent,2. In whom recitations find their joy, and all (deeds) worthy of fame,as the aid of the waters does in the sea.3. With my good praise I seek to entice him, the preeminent king, effective at raiding,the prizewinner, for the gains of the great (prize?).4.

This over-length, combined with its metrical disunity and the varying use of the verses in later Vedic ritual, suggests that the “hymn” is actually a composite of three: verses 1–10, consisting of three tr̥cas plus a final verse; another independent tr̥ca, verses 11–13; and a final pragātha, verses 14–15. (For details, see Oldenberg 1888: 139 n. 1 and 214 n. 2.)The first and longest of the three hymns (vss. 1–10) is a straightforward invita-tion to soma, urging Indra to make the journey to our sacrifice and promising an ecstatic immersion in the liquid. There are several striking images toward the end, especially that of the soma mixed with milk as a woman in disguise going to a ren-dezvous (if our interpretation is correct) (vs. 7), and a vivid picture of Indra in the grip of soma-exhilaration (vs. 8). Only the last verse (10), tacked onto the final tr̥ca, asks for something in return.The other two hymns, or hymn fragments, are more opaque. The first (vss. 11–13) begins with a conventional invitation to Indra, but the following two verses address otherwise unknown men involved in some way in the soma sacrifice. The final pragātha (vss. 14–15) first gives a praiseful description of the soma drop in"},{"pageNumber":1078,"pageContent":"VIII.171061verse 14, but ends with yet another unknown man also engaged in the soma sacri-fice, who seems to have some success in getting Indra to drink it.1.

There is a fair amount of coherence within tr̥cas—for example, the dominance of Aditi in verses 4–6, the repetition of śa﻿́m “weal” and the four-syllable tag refrain in verses 7–9.1.

Sobhari addresses himself in every hymn but VIII.21.VIII.19 (639) Agni (1–33), Ādityas (34–35), Trasadasyu’s Dānastuti (36–37)Sobhari Kāṇva37 verses: 1–26, 28–33 pragātha strophes of kakubh (8 12 8) and satobr̥hatī (12 8 12 8), except dvipadā virāj 27, uṣ ṇih 34, satobr̥hatī 35, kakubh 36, paṅkti 37Save for VI.16 with its 48 verses, this is the longest hymn dedicated to Agni in the R̥gveda, but unlike the composite VI.16, this hymn shows clear signs of unity. This unity is evident (though more clearly in the Sanskrit) in the constant recy-cling and recombination of vocabulary, especially the lexicon related to sacrifice. Thematically the hymn focuses on Agni’s role in the sacrifice and on mortals’ tasks"},{"pageNumber":1081,"pageContent":"VIII.191064in helping him fulfill that role. Numerous verses promise the favor and aid of Agni to the mortal who properly serves the fire (see, e.g., vss. 5–6, 9–14).This reciprocal relationship between the god Agni and mortal men and Agni’s mediating position between gods and men provide other themes in the hymn. The first verses (1–4) emphasize Agni’s divine nature even while sketching his role as the Hotar parallel to mortal priests and chosen by them (esp. vs. 3ab), but this equivocal position of Agni is explored differently later in the hymn. Verse 24 again puts heavy emphasis on the fact that Agni is a god and immortal and also the Hotar acting for and established by men, but here he seems to be acting almost like a mortal himself—seeking the rewards of the sacrifice like a human priest. This subtle role shift leads to a more explicit and otherwise unthinkable one in the next verses (25–27), where the poet imagines himself as the god and Agni as his mortal server and claims that he, the poet, would act beneficently. (For a similar role reversal but with Indra and his mortal worshiper, see nearby VIII.14.) This flight of fancy ends quickly, and the proper relations between man and god are restored in verse 28.The hymn also has a political agenda, coming to a climax in verses 32–33, but foreshadowed at various places earlier in the hymn. In verse 32 the poet announces that he and his fellows have come to the fire belonging to the great king Trasadasyu, the fire on which all other fires are dependent (vs. 33). As Proferes convincingly argues (2007: 33–34 and passim), the fire represents the king’s sovereignty and is depicted as being made up of the fires of the individual peoples who give allegiance to the king, the brilliance belonging to each of these peoples being brought together in a team. Agni is thus not only the mediator positioned between men and gods, but also among different groups of men, and in both cases he is chosen for the role, put in that position, by men acting voluntarily.The model of the sacrifice as reciprocal action and responsibility provides an implicit model for the state. As noted above, earlier parts of the hymn hint at what is to come. In verse 7 the poet hopes that his group can use their fires to provide good fire for an unidentified plural “you”—quite possibly the larger pol-ity. The plural “fires” is significant: though in ritual context it can easily be taken as referring to the three fires on the ritual ground, in a political reading it can represent the dependent fires of verse 33. The next verse (8) refers to Agni as “a guest associated with alliance” (átithiḥ . . . mitríyaḥ). Again in ritual context this refers to the god’s presence as guest in the house of a mortal and the alliance between gods and men thus effected, but in a political reading the alliance is the banding together of the peoples under Trasadasyu represented by Trasadasyu’s fire. In verse 14 we find the curious and syntactically unusual expression “who will piously offer boundlessness throughout the domains.” The word “boundlessness” is áditi, usually used as the name of the goddess Aditi, mother of the Ādityas, but more easily interpreted as a common noun here. Again, in a ritual context it may mean that the ritual ground is equivalent to the whole world and thus unbounded, but in a political context it may refer to the erasure of boundaries"},{"pageNumber":1082,"pageContent":"VIII.191065among the peoples who give allegiance to Trasadasyu and his fire. It may also indirectly promise the favor of the Ādityas, the gods who oversee the relationships among men, to the men who subscribe to this allegiance. The principal Ādityas, Varuṇa, Mitra, and Aryaman (as well as Bhaga), show up in verse 16, and already Agni was said to be Mitraic (/associated with alliance) in verse 8 (see also vs. 25). It is surely significant that the two verses following the climactic declaration about Trasadasyu’s sovereign fire (vss. 34–35) are dedicated to the Ādityas, specifi-cally Varuṇa, Mitra, and Aryaman. The final two verses (36–37) are a brief and uncomplex dānastuti of Trasadasyu.It is hoped that this introduction gives some sense of the richness and intricate interconnections of this hymn; much more could be said.1.

After inviting them to the sacrifice (vss. 1–2), the poet first describes the effects in nature of the storm they embody (vss. 3–6) and then their flashy beauty and that of their chariot (vss. 7–12), ending this section with two verses (13–14) on their lack of individuality (see also vs. 21). The remainder of the hymn concerns the generosity of the Maruts and begs them to display it in response to Sobhari’s hymn: the poet addresses him-self in verses 19–20. Unlike the generic gifts generally asked for in R̥gvedic hymns, the final verses make it clear that the poet has a specific request: Marut medicine to heal the afflicted (vss. 23–26). Their association with healing comes through their father Rudra.The hymn exhibits a light touch and has a number of neat turns of phrase—for instance, verse 8, where “the music of the Sobharis is anointed with cows” indicates that their hymn reaps a bovine reward from the patron, or verse 19, with its pun on the participle cárkr̥ṣat meaning both “plowing” and “celebrating.”1.

Amid the standard invitations to the soma sacrifice (e.g., vss. 3, 5) and praise of Indra’s quali-ties (e.g., vs. 10), the poet depicts himself and his people as previously deprived of Indra (vs. 7), but as possessing hopes and visions of the god’s entering into rela-tionship with them (see esp. vs. 6), and he imagines what they could achieve if this relationship were activated (vss. 11–12). The stress on the 1st plural “we” (including Indra along with the mortals) and on “our” states of mind is highly unusual in R̥gvedic poetry.The poet’s conception of possible relationships develops in even more unpredict-able ways toward the end of the hymn. The pragātha strophe consisting of verses 13–14 begins strikingly by calling Indra friendless, and continues in verse 14 with a brief and idiosyncratic characterization of some who don’t have relationships with Indra. The following pragātha (vss. 15–16) urges “us” not to miss our own chance with Indra, with a noteworthy comparison of “our” potentially damaging lack of activity to that of aging spinsters.Thus, though much of the hymn contains conventional Indra-hymn material, there is a distinct “psychological” tinge to the poet’s depiction of the interaction of his group with Indra. This depiction of an emotional bond between the worshipers and the deity makes the abrupt transition to the dānastuti all the more surprising, especially because the dānastuti seems to belittle Indra’s giving in comparison to King Citra’s.1. O you without precedent—we, seeking help like people carrying something massive,call upon you, the brilliant, in the prize contest.2.

The hymn focuses especially on the chariot of the Aśvins, as well as on their journey to us, the sacrifice with which we will welcome them, and the multi-form aid we hope for in return.Nonetheless there are a few striking images and turns of phrase, particularly in verse 6 where the Aśvins “plow barley with a wolf,” an expression that cannot be sep-arated from the similar one in I.117.21, likewise an Aśvin hymn, where they “scatter barley with a wolf.” Starting with Yaska (6.26), the “wolf ” has regularly been identi-fied as a type of plow, though this recourse to agricultural technology could be taken as a reductive attempt to explain away the wondrous nature of the Aśvins’ feats—here perhaps their ability to harness the power of a dangerous and semi-wild beast for a civilizing task. On the wolf as a cross-category in the Vedic conceptual universe, situ-ated between the wild and the civilized and partaking of both, see Jamison (2008b).1.

The names Vyaśva and its patro-nymic Vaiyaśva occur several times in these hymns, as does the name of the patron (Varo) Suṣāman, and the hymns are also characterized by the almost exclusive use of the uṣṇih meter (8 8 12). See Oldenberg (1888: 211–13).VIII.23 (643) AgniViśvamanas Vaiyaśva30 verses: uṣṇih, arranged in tr̥casThe poet begins the hymn by urging himself to perform his sacrificial tasks (vss. 1–2ab), ending this little section with vocatives addressed to himself but seem-ingly designed to identify himself with his divine target Agni: “belonging to all domains” is often an epithet of Agni (as well as of Indra) and “having all in mind” (viśva﻿́manas) could be a divine descriptor. However, at least according to the Anukramaṇī, it is the poet’s own name, and he then (vs. 2c) speaks in his own 1st-person voice. This interactive quality is prominent throughout the hymn. The poet’s self-address returns in verse 24, and in between he also addresses in the 2nd-person plural the assembled priests and worshipers, on whose behalf he is work-ing (vss. 7–9; see esp. 9a, where he calls them “seekers of the truth”). (On poetic self-address see Jamison 2009a.) Agni’s role in this social context, as clanlord of"},{"pageNumber":1093,"pageContent":"VIII.231076clans, is also emphasized (vss. 10, 13–14, 20). Manu, the mythical founder of the larger Ārya sacrificial community known as the “descendants of Manu,” is also duly remembered (vss. 13, 17, 25–26), as are the mythical seer Uśanā Kāvya (vs. 17) and the poet’s immediate ancestor, the seer Vyaśva (vss. 16, 23), whose devo-tion to Agni and lucrative relationship with his patron, Ukṣan, merit mention and provide a model for Vaiyaśva’s own gentle hint to his patron Varo Suṣāman (vs. 28). Thus the poet situates his praise of the god and his requests to him in a web of social relations and mutual dependency pertaining both in the current time and in the long history of the descendants of Manu.Both the praise and the requests follow the common tropes of the genre, though often nicely executed. The focus is on Agni as the messenger of the gods and as the carrier of our oblations to them. Some of the tr̥cas show thematic or syntactic unity (e.g., vss. 13–15 against demons and cheats), but the tr̥ca structure is not prominent, and there are bridges across tr̥cas (e.g., the messenger theme in vss. 18–19).1.

Stand up with your divine body while you are being praised, o you who conduct good ceremonies,with your gaze (on us), blazing with your lofty radiance.6. O Agni, drive (to the gods) with our good lauds, pouring oblations in yourself in the proper sequence,as you have become our oblation-carrying messenger.7. I call upon Agni on your behalf, the foremost Hotar of the settled domains.I shall hymn him with this speech, and I shall praise him for you all,8. Him of unerring will, whom, together with his body, they sweeten with their sacrifices,him, like an ally, well established among the people who abide in truth.9.

The first two verses of the dānastuti are unexceptional in diction and tone, but the last verse (30) contains puns and neologisms, as often in dānastutis.The rest of the hymn contains fairly standard praise of Indra, with special emphasis on his generosity—rā́dhas “generosity” is something of a signature word in the hymn, occurring six times—though his powers do not go unmentioned. The need to praise Indra to stimulate his giving is also a recurrent motif in the hymn, and the poet calls upon both himself (sometimes by name) and his companions to provide that praise (see, e.g., vss. 1, 14, 19, 22–23). Such interactivity was also char-acteristic of the preceding hymn (VIII.23) to Agni.The hymn consists of tr̥cas, but there is little unity within most of these triplets; instead, there are a number of instances of cross-tr̥ca transitions (see, e.g., vss. 3/4, 6/7, 9/10). The poet also makes considerable use of alliteration and, especially, of pairing derivationally related words. Verse 10 provides a particularly fine example of the latter practice.1. Comrades, we direct our formulation to Indra who bears the mace—I shall praise him on your behalf—to the most manly, bold one.2.

Starting in verse 10 other gods join the group besought for help and protection. In particular the Sun, as a representative of the Ādityas, is the main subject of two tr̥cas (vss. 16–21). The final verses of the hymn (starting with vs. 19) turn their attention to the sacrificial setting. A simile concerning the ritual fire in verse 19 serves as a transition to this scene, and an address to the Sun in verse 21, which introduces the poet’s “benefactors,” likewise produces a transition to the final tr̥ca (vss. 22–24), a dānastuti praising the gift of several horses and a chariot.Although the thematic structure of the hymn roughly tracks the arrangement in tr̥cas, the tr̥cas do not have strong internal cohesion, and there is relatively little verbal unity within them.1.

The first nineteen verses are dedicated to the Aśvins and, as usual, urge them to drive their chariot to our sacrifice and to give us goods in return. There is little novel to capture the audience; the most striking image is found in verse 13: the unnamed god Agni, dressed in sacrifices like a bride in her wedding finery.The final six verses belong to Vāyu, deified Wind, another god associated with the early-morning sacrifice, who receives the first soma drink there. He too is called to make the journey to our sacrifice and reward us for our offerings. He is twice (vss. 21, 22) designated as the son-in-law of Tvaṣṭar, the fashioner god—a somewhat surprising identification, given the tangled marital situation of Tvaṣṭar’s daughter as tantalizingly sketched in X.17.1–2—where Vāyu is not in the picture.1.

On the group see Oldenberg (1888: 215).VIII.27 (647) All GodsManu Vaivasvata22 verses: br̥hatī alternating with satobr̥hatī, arranged in pragāthasThis hymn to the All Gods falls roughly into three parts on the basis of the gods addressed. The first eight verses contain a number of named gods, whose associa-tions seem random, rather than ordered into the usual functional groups—with, for example, the Maruts mentioned next to the Ādityas, singly or jointly, or to Agni. In contrast to this jumble of divine names, the middle section (vss. 9–14) mentions no gods except Savitar (vs. 12), and he is in service of the unnamed plural “you” used of the gods as a corporate entity. The unity and superimposability of the vari-ous gods in this section is made clear in verses 13–14. The final section (vss. 15–22) mentions only the Ādityas, though in fact they appear only in verses 15, 17, and 22.Despite these differences in divine address, the hymn is unified by its concerns, especially the desire for protection and shelter offered by the gods (see, e.g., vss. 4, 9, 20), and by its vocabulary—in particular the epithet viśvá-vedas “affording all possessions” (vss. 2, 4, 11, 19, 20, 21) or, according to others, “having all knowledge, which is a near phonological match to víśve devā́ḥ “All Gods,” to whom the hymn is dedicated. The ritual context is also very much present in the hymn.On the basis of verse 12 and the sketch of Savitar’s functions there, Geldner suggests that this is an evening hymn. But later in the hymn the poet insistently mentions various times of day (vss. 19–21), and so it seems rather that he is seeking the aid and protection of the gods round-the-clock, as it were."},{"pageNumber":1103,"pageContent":"VIII.271086The language of the hymn is fairly simple and straightforward, and the lexicon often repetitive. But the effect is pleasing, and the poem hardly deserves Renou’s judgment (EVP IV: 106) that it is “banal” and “facile.”1. Agni has been set in front while the solemn speech (is being recited), as have the pressing stones and the ritual grass while the ceremony (is going forth).With a verse I implore the Maruts, Brahmaṇaspati, and the gods for help worthy to be chosen.2.

The common canonical number of gods, thirty-three, is mentioned in verse 1, and these undifferentiated gods are apparently our global protectors in verse 3 and able to attain all their desires in verse 4. Verse 2 mentions an oddly assorted set of gods: the three principal Ādityas, but also multiple Agnis, and two fairly mar-ginal groups of divinities, the Wives of the Gods and the Gift Escorts. Though verse 2 names the divinities, in contrast to verses 1 and 3–4, it shares the ritual context of verse 1, which is lacking in the two following verses concerning the gods in general.The final verse (5) is in the same riddling style as the following hymn (VIII.29), though in a different meter, and its vocabulary invites the identification of the “seven” as the Maruts (called thrice seven in I.133.6), especially since they are not found in the following hymn.1. The gods, three beyond thirty, who sat down on the ritual grass,they found and once again they gained.2. Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman, the Agnis with the Gift Escorts,along with the Wives (of the Gods), are those to whom the vaṣaṭ-cry is made.3. These are our herdsmen to the west, these to the north, these likewise to the south,to the east—through their whole clan.4. As the gods desire, just so will it be. No one will confound this (desire) of theirs,not even a hostile mortal.5. Of the seven there are seven spears; seven brilliancies are theirs;seven beauties did they put on.VIII.29 (649) All GodsManu Vaivasvata or Kaśyapa Mārīca10 verses: dvipadā virāj (so Anukramaṇī), but really dvipadā satobr̥hatī"},{"pageNumber":1106,"pageContent":"VIII.291089A very tightly and intricately structured riddle hymn. (See discussion in Jamison 2007: 75–77.) Each short verse (dvipāda satobr̥hatī verses contain only twenty syl-lables apiece) identifies a god (or pair of gods) by attributes or behavior, but not by name—though the referents would be clear to the audience. It is thus, in the first instance, a list hymn. However, the poet has devised a method to endow the list template with both internal structure and forward momentum. In second position of each of the verses is a numeral. In the first seven verses it is ékaḥ “one,” but verses 8 and 9 have dvā́ “two” and the last verse plural éke “some” or, literally, “the ones,” so that the verse structure builds through the categories of grammatical number, culminating in the only plural—though since éke belongs to the same stem as ékaḥ, there is also a sense of symmetry and return.There is further structure within the subsections of the hymn. The éka verses, the first seven in the hymn, show an omphalos structure, with the three middle verses (3–5) having the identical sequence . . . éko bibharti háste “the one bears in his hand.” The poet plays with number in other ways in this hymn: verse 7, the final verse containing “one,” begins trī́ṇi ékaḥ “three the one. . . . ” The referent is Viṣṇu and his three strides, so the poet, by introducing a new number, prepares us for our departure from the singular. Similarly, the next verse, the first with “two,” also con-tains “one”: VIII.29.8a víbhir dvā́ carata ékayā sahá “With the birds the two wander along with the one” [=the two Aśvins plus Sūryā], with the feminine instrumental ékayā providing a transition between the “one” verses and the “two” verses.If we are correct, the lone and climactic plural éke in verse 10 also has a differ-ent status from the apparently parallel numerals in the previous verses. As previ-ously noted, each riddling verse defines a god, but in this last verse the identity of the éke is not entirely clear: the Aṅgirases or Atri(s) have been suggested (see Geldner’s note ad loc.). I would suggest instead that this verse now turns to the world of men by presenting the poets’ self-identification. The poets themselves (or their ancestors) are the solution to this final riddle. They draw attention to their own creative activity (or that of their ancestors), and as often in final verses they make a sort of meta-reference to the rest of the hymn that precedes this announce-ment: it is this same hymn that they are chanting now. At the same time the rigid poetic parallel structure implicitly claims for the mortal poets the same status as the gods they have just celebrated, since they are numerically identified in the same type of riddle as the gods of verses 1–9. In favor of the view that human poets/ritualists are the subject of verse 10 is the presence of the words árcanta(ḥ). . . sā́ma “chanting . . . melody.” Joining these two words in the same clause seems intended to evoke the technical terms r̥ ́c “verse” (of the R̥gveda) and the sā́man “melody” (of the Sāmaveda) to which it is set, major components of Vedic ritual utterance, and therefore to mark the event depicted as a contemporary ritual of the present Vedic community. “Causing the sun to shine” may ascribe a cosmogonic act to the original performance of the ritual, or (more likely in our view) simply suggest that the hymns uttered at the daily dawn ritual actually ensure the rising and shining of the sun, rather than simply celebrating it."},{"pageNumber":1107,"pageContent":"VIII.301090Thus the poem skillfully combines and balances architectonic structures with forward, developing movement, and does so in a remarkably economical package. The development is not only formal, for the order in which the gods are presented takes us from the here-and-now of the ritual ground (Soma and Agni), through the mythical space where gods perform deeds that have effects on men (Tvaṣṭar, Indra, Rudra, Pūṣan), to the airy and heavenly spaces (Viṣṇu, Aśvins and Sūryā, Mitra and Varuṇa), ending specifically “in heaven” (diví). Yet, despite all this clever machinery, the hymn wears its structure lightly, and the mechanisms that provide so much plea-sure are essentially invisible to the audience.1.

Much more jarring—and, in our opinion, deliberately so—is the contrast between the slangy and popular register in verse 1 and the solemn, almost stilted rhetoric of the second verse, which explicitly represents itself as quoting the first one. The remaining two verses express conventional prayers for aid and protection, in much the same style as verse 2."},{"pageNumber":1108,"pageContent":"VIII.3110911. “Since there isn’t a little runt among you, gods, nor a little kid,(you are) all just entirely great.”2.

The first nine verses contain two parallel treatments of the same subject; verses 10–14 seem unconnected both with what precedes and what follows, and resemble some of the disordered All God sequences in earlier Manu Vaivasvata hymns (VIII.27.1–8 and VIII.28) in calling on an odd assortment of gods for protection; the final four verses (15–18) return to the topic of the beginning of the hymn, the benefits accruing to the punctilious sacrificer, though in rather general terms.The beginning of the hymn, especially verses 5–9, are of extraordinary rit-ual interest, for they contain the only clear reference to the participation of the Sacrificer’s Wife in R̥gvedic ritual—participation which is, in our view, a ritual innovation in the late R̥gveda. (For indirect references to her presence in R̥gvedic ritual, see Jamison 2011 and forthcoming a and b, and discussion ad VIII.33.) As the Anukramaṇī states, verses 5–9 are dedicated to the “household pair” (dámpatī), who are depicted as jointly participating in soma preparation (vs. 5). Their rewards are great and appropriately domestic (see esp. vs. 8). Indeed, the mention of the “milk-mixture” (āśír, vs. 5) makes it quite likely that the ritual depicted is the Third Pressing, itself likely a ritual innovation, found only among certain R̥gvedic clans, the pressing in which the participation of the Sacrificer’s Wife is particularly promi-nent in later śrauta ritual (see Jamison 1996a: 126–46). The first four verses of the hymn mention only the Sacrificer, with no mention of the Wife, but a reference to the milk-mixture in verse 2 and to the benefits to his house (vs. 4) makes it likely that these four verses treat the same topic, though without the radical overt mention of the Wife."},{"pageNumber":1109,"pageContent":"VIII.311092The Anukramaṇī considers the final four verses (15–18) to be blessings for the same household pair (dampatyor āśiṣaḥ), but again there is no overt mention of the Wife, and, in contrast to verses 1–4 with its reference to the milk-mixture, the ritual that the successful sacrificer performed is left unclear.1.

See Oldenberg (1888: 215).VIII.32 (652) IndraMedhātithi Kā ṇva30 verses: gāyatrī, arranged for the most part in tr̥casThe hymn begins with a call to the Kaṇva poets to praise Indra’s great deeds, and the next two verses (2–3) provide a quick catalogue of Indra’s victories over several of his lesser known opponents. This theme, with some of the same names/epithets, returns at the end of the hymn (esp. vss. 25–27). In between we find the usual twin exhortations to Indra—to come to our soma sacrifice (rather than that of others; see esp. vss. 21–22) and to give us wealth and aid. The reciprocal obligation of the sacrificers and the recipient of sacrifice is nicely expressed in verse 16, where Indra’s debt to (other) sacrificers has been discharged by his countergift.There is nothing of particular note in this hymn, though it is nicely executed. It also contains several hapaxes and words with apparently non-Indo-Aryan phonol-ogy, especially toward the beginning, that give it a slightly exotic air.The internal structure of the hymn is not entirely clear. We follow Oldenberg’s analysis, whereby the hymn consists of tr̥cas plus a final verse (30) save for verses 19–20, which form an incomplete tr̥ca with perhaps a verse missing.

Indra’s “resolve” (-krátu) is frequently mentioned (vss. 5, 6, 11, 13, 14).The last four verses (16–19), in a different meter, are also entirely different in tone and intent and have given rise to multiple interpretations—especially the final taunt (19d): “You, a brahmin, have become a woman.” Our view of this tantalizingly opaque sequence is that it concerns the introduction of the Sacrificer’s Wife into the performance of solemn ritual, an introduction celebrated in the nearby hymn VIII.31 (see remarks there). But, unlike the situation in VIII.31, the poet of VIII.33 displays a conservative opposition to this ritual innovation, an innovation that he nonethe-less ascribes to Indra’s leadership. In verse 16 the poet complains that an unnamed ritualist no longer listens to the instructions of his fellow ritualists but only to Indra’s. In verses 17 and 18 Indra speaks, and though he at first disparages women’s intellect (vs. 17), he asserts that a sacrifice directed by a complementary pair (mithunā́, a word often used explicitly of a sexual couple) is especially successful (with implicit contrast to the older model without female participation)—while at the same time suggesting that the husband should keep the upper hand (or upper chariot-pole: the common metaphor of sacrifice as chariot is in play). The final verse is, in our view, spoken by the jaundiced poet himself. In the first three pādas he mocks his ritually innovative colleague by pretending to be a mother inculcating proper feminine behavior into her little daughter. The language is both slangy and heavily diminutivized, and the crucial noun in pāda c, the dual kaśaplakaú, is a hapax and unclear, though it may well refer to female genitalia. He then announces his reasons for this mockery: the innovative colleague, by favoring women’s ritual participation, risks being tainted by the female presence and becoming a woman himself. (Such charges have frequently been directed at men who favor women’s rights, at least since the time of John Stuart Mill.) For more detailed discussion, see Jamison (forthcoming a and 2011).It is not entirely clear why this curious sequence is found tacked onto an other-wise ordinary Indra hymn. It occupies the position often taken by a dānastuti, and of course dānastutis often display a linguistic register similar to what is found here, slangy and colloquial vocabulary, syntactically informal direct speech, and sexual innuendo. It has been suggested that it is a sort of anti-dānastuti, a “satire” in the technical sense. This is an appealing explanation for its position in the hymn, but with the proviso that, at least in our interpretation, the target of the satire is clearly not the poet’s patron (stingy or not), but a fellow ritualist.1.

The second half of each verse consists of a refrain, which implicitly contrasts with the first half of each verse. The refrain addresses an uniden-tified plural “you,” who have driven to heaven and command heaven; we consider the “you” to refer to the other gods, as contrasted with Indra, or perhaps specifi-cally to the Maruts. Most of the first half-verses begin with the preverb ā́ “here” and generally call upon Indra to drive here (using the same verb as in the refrain) and participate in the sacrifice. Thus Indra’s desired presence “here” is the constant counterweight to the removal of the other gods to heaven."},{"pageNumber":1116,"pageContent":"VIII.341099The other part of the refrain is a curious vocative, clearly addressed to Indra, divā-vasu “you who (bring) goods by day,” found only here and of odd formation. The motivation for this form becomes clear in the dānastuti (vss. 16–18), where the patron’s name is given as Vasu-rocis (vs. 16) “whose light is goods”: Indra’s epithet divā-vasu is a pun on and a metathesis of this name, with the vásu “goods” element reversed and rocís “light” replaced by dívā “by day.” The similarity between this name and the relentlessly repeated epithet of Indra establishes an implicit identifi-cation between the human patron and Indra; even more strikingly, verse 16 asserts that the poet and the god Indra have jointly received rich goods from Vasurocis, so that even Indra is presented as a beneficiary of the largesse of Vasurocis.The formal structure of the hymn continues to its very end: the final word of the hymn is the signature ā́ “here,” which also began it.1.

This long hymn may be one of the most repetitive in the R̥gveda. In the first twenty-one verses the c-pāda is identical, and the tr̥cas making up the hymn all have refrains encompassing at least the second half-verse (pādas cd: vss. 1–3; pādas cde: vss. 22–24) and usually the second (b) pāda as well (bcd: vss. 4–6, 7–9, 10–12, 13–15, 16–18, 19–21). This leaves the first (a) pāda as the only locus of variation in each tr̥ca, and even that variation is patterned and under strict control. Moreover, the contents and phraseology of the individual tr̥cas do not differ significantly one from another—urg-ing the Aśvins to come to the sacrifice with numerous other gods and to partake of our offerings while providing us with gifts and aid in return. The repetitive structure has an incantatory effect, but it does not challenge the decoding skills of the audience.The most interesting tr̥ca consists of verses 16–18. As a number of others have pointed out, these three verses, asking the Aśvins to “quicken” or “animate” various things for us, are appropriate to the three varṇas in turn: verse 16 to the brahmin, 17 to the kṣatriya, and 18 to the vaiśya. In fact, verse 16 begins with the word bra﻿́hma, while 17 begins with kṣatra﻿́m. In 16 we ask for the Aśvins’ aid for ritual and priestly elements, in 17 for elements related to kingly and martial power, and in 18 for our livestock and people. As is well known, the varṇa system is not a prominent feature of the R̥gveda and may well only be taking shape in this period, but this small collec-tion of Śyāvāśva hymns displays it clearly—not only in this tr̥ca, but in the next two twinned hymns (36 and 37) with their reference to bra﻿́hman and kṣatra﻿́ respectively.1.

This structure is almost identical to that of the pre-ceding hymn (VIII.35).This hymn and the following one, VIII.37, although in different (but related) meters, are twinned conceptions. Both are seven verses long; both devote most of the first six verses to refrain, reserving only the first pāda of each verse for new material. The final verses of both hymns are almost identical save for a few lexical variants, the most important of which is the correspondence between bráhmāṇi “priestly formulations” in VIII.36.7 and kṣatrā́ṇi “lordly powers” in VIII.37.7. This correspondence suggests that the hymns were designed as appropriate to brahmins and kṣatriyas respectively, and though the formalized doctrine of the three twice-born varṇas seems to be taking shape only in the late R̥gveda (see especially the Puruṣasūkta, X.90.11–12), it is surely no accident, as Oldenberg points out (Noten ad loc.), that this same group of Śyāvāśva hymns contains a tripartite blessing clearly referring to the three upper varṇas (VIII.35.16–18). Nonetheless in this hymn there seems little that is specifically applicable to the brahmin and only to him, and indeed the strong emphasis on victory in the refrain would seem more a warrior than a priestly preoccupation.Since Śyāvāśva is best known for his Marut cycle in the Vth Maṇḍala (V.52–61), it is entirely appropriate that Indra is “accompanied by the Maruts” in this refrain. Śyāvāśva’s ancestors the Atris (note his patronymic Ātreya) are also glorified in this hymn (vss. 6–7); the Atris are, of course, more at home in their own family maṇḍala, V, than in VIII.1.

Each of the three tr̥cas has a differ-ent refrain, though each of the refrains begins with the vocative dual dvandva índrāgnī “o Indra and Agni.” The final verse (10) breaks the pattern, though the same dvandva is found, pāda-initial, in the genitive. In content the hymn is entirely devoted to the soma sacrifice and the poet’s invitation to the two gods to come and enjoy it. The poet names himself in verse 9 and summarizes his poetic activity in the past tense. Such a summary is ordinarily found in the absolute final verse of hymns, but here it is capped by the pattern-breaking verse 10.As often in hymns dedicated jointly to these two gods, who share little in terms of activities and attributes, they are either described in general terms or with epi-thets related to one or the other—for example, in verse 1 it is technically only Agni who is a “regular offerer of sacrifice” ( r̥tvíj), while Indra is more appropriately the victor in prize contests (vā́jeṣu) than Agni. The third term in that verse, kármasu “in acts/deeds,” is ambiguous, however, since kárman is regularly used both of the types of heroic deeds associated with Indra and with ritual acts more commonly ascribed to Agni."},{"pageNumber":1124,"pageContent":"VIII.3911071.

The group is characterized by the slangy refrain that puns on his name, nábhantām anyaké same “let all the other squirts burst!” The poet is also partial to the mahāpaṅkti meter, found in VIII.39–41.VIII.39 (659) AgniNābhāka Kā ṇva10 verses: mahāpaṅktiAgni’s role as messenger between heaven and earth and as mediator between gods and men is particularly emphasized in this hymn. And, in addition to his usual ritual role, his identity as poet is also mentioned several times (see esp. vss. 1, 7, 9). The hymn"},{"pageNumber":1125,"pageContent":"VIII.391108contains an example of the well-known trope of “pouring prayers” (vs. 3), and in the middle of the hymn we find a pun on one of Agni’s standard epithets Jāta-vedas, in verse 6 where it is said that he “knows” (veda) the “races” (jātā́) of gods and men.The hymn in general has a benign tone and high discourse level, and so the flip-pantly bloodthirsty refrain rests oddly in it. Only in verse 2 does it fit the contents, and even there the linguistic register is quite distinct between the verse proper and the refrain.The poet handles the six-pāda structure of the mahāpaṅkti flexibly. The last pāda of each verse is the Nabhāka refrain. Otherwise the first two pādas (ab) and the fourth and fifth (de) pādas each group together, while the third pāda (c) belongs sometimes with ab (generally in the first part of the hymn) and sometimes with de (toward the end, vss. 7–9).1.

Much of the content is martial, appropriate to Indra, and also more appropriate to the Nābhāka refrain than any other of the Nābhāka hymns. The freeing and winning of the waters is celebrated several times (vss. 5, 8, 10/11). There are several paired verses: 4 and 5 where Nābhāka is mentioned by name, and 10/11, the first to Indra, the sec-ond, almost identical, to Agni. The hymn ends with a verse in a different meter, without the refrain, that summarizes the hymn that precedes, as is often the case.1.

The sun and moon as his deputies function at the intersection of the spatial and temporal (vs. 9). The god is also presented as holding both human and natural phenomena within his encom-passing physical protection (vss. 1cd, 3ac, 4de, 7abc).The hymn seems to have a loose omphalos structure. Verbal correspondences in verses 2/9 (especially the “seven”) and 3/8 (ní √dhā “deposit” and feminine plurals) provide a weak ring (see also the “three” in vss. 3/9 and “embrace” [pa﻿́ri √svaj] and “envelop” [pa﻿́ri √mr̥ś ] 3/7). And the two middle verses, 5–6, the omphalos proper, point to the hymn’s cryptic message—the creative power of poetry and of the knowledge and control of words, especially names.Varuṇa’s later association with the waters is evident in several hints in the hymn: his closeness to the rivers in 2d, who are also his seven sisters in 2e and the seven over which he has control in 9e, and his identification as “a secret sea” in 8a. The waters may well be the referents of the unidentified feminine plurals in 7a and 8c.Much remains unclear in this hymn, however, and we do not claim to have pen-etrated all its many mysteries. One of the most obvious, but perhaps least interest-ing, puzzles is the relevance of the jaunty and bloodthirsty Nābhāka refrain to the high-minded and solemn contents of the hymn.1.

He propped up heaven—the lord who possesses all possessions—he measured out the expanse of the earth;the sovereign king made all the living worlds his seat.

On the surface the hymn is a pleasant but generally unremarkable praise of Agni. His ritual functions are showcased throughout, and toward the end the “we” of the poet and his fellow sacrificers invoke him more and more insistently"},{"pageNumber":1131,"pageContent":"VIII.431114in this role. But earlier in the hymn there is some nice naturalistic description of fire and fires (vss. 3–10). In verses 14 and 16 the poet emphasizes the kinship between himself and Agni as poet.Another thematic strain evident in the hymn and asserting itself more and more toward the end is the role of Agni as a unifying focus of various clans and settle-ments in the larger Ārya community. In several early verses multiple fires are kin-dled at once (vss. 4–5). In light of later parts of the hymn, these can be interpreted as the separate family or clan fires, which are later joined conceptually in the single fire to which all the separate groups give allegiance (see esp. vs. 18, also 27, 29). This single fire, found in multiple places but shared by all the clans, is invoked for help in combat in verse 21. Agni’s competitive (vss. 20, 25), martial (vss. 21, 23, 26, 32), and ruling (vs. 24) aspects become more prominent in the second half of the hymn; the sacrificers clearly wish to harness these powers for the good of the whole com-munity. Though not insistent, this theme is pervasive and provides a subtle unity to this superficially rambling thirty-three-verse composition.1. For the inspired poet, the ritual adept, the indestructible sacrificer, for Agni—these hymns, these praises arise right here.2. For you right here, yearning for it, o unbounded Jātavedas,o Agni, I generate a lovely praise hymn.3.

Indeed, this hymn does appear to ramble, unlike the last one, in which several persistent themes provided structure. There are several sig-nature words, especially forms of the root śuc “flame, blaze” and of the nominal vásu “good/goods.” Agni’s ritual function is the dominant topic, and his twin and contrasting roles as vípra “inspired poet” (vss. 10, 12, 21, 29) and kaví “sage poet” (vss. 7, 12, 21, 26, 30) are regularly mentioned. But there is no clear development in the hymn, and most of the verses contain standard descriptions and addresses to the god.1.

The tr̥ca division can otherwise be faint, and in several instances seems to contravene groupings of verse by content (see esp. vss. 36–39). The Anukramaṇī attributes the hymn to a certain Triśoka, but this name has probably been plucked from verse 30.The first two verses establish a ritual mise-en-scène, but we quickly move into the martial and competitive mode that prevails in most of the rest of this long hymn."},{"pageNumber":1136,"pageContent":"VIII.451119Familiar chords are struck: Indra is exhorted to destroy enemies in various fero-cious ways (e.g., vs. 8) and to parcel out their goods to us (e.g., vs. 15), to drink our soma and aid our efforts (e.g., vs. 14), and to give us rich gifts (e.g., vs. 12), and he is praised for his past deeds (see esp. vss. 25–30).But the hymn also has several unusual features. The poet expresses a remarkable degree of apprehension about the exercise of Indra’s powers and fear that they may be turned against him and his comrades. Although a certain amount of such senti-ment (as in the beginning of vs. 10) is not rare in Indra hymns, the sequence of verses 31–35, which begins with a plea to Indra not to do what he has in mind and seeks to accomplish, a sharp reversal of the usual request, depicts men in fear of being Indra’s targets—or perhaps even just of witnessing his terrifying hyper-power (see vss. 32, 35)—and begging for his mercy. Already in verse 19 they expressed worry about their shaky relationship with Indra, and the poet speaks of their “offenses” in verse 34, a term more at home in an Ādityan context.Even more striking are two snatches of dialogue, which bookend the hymn: the first two verses of the second tr̥ca (vss. 4–5) and the first two verses of the penul-timate tr̥ca (vss. 37–38). In the first pair the just-born Indra takes up a bow and asks his mother about potential enemies, and she replies with what appears to be a proverbial expression assuring him of his ultimate victory. (This scene has a close parallel in VIII.77.1–2.) In verses 37–38 it seems (the verses are quite obscure and uncontextualized) that Indra and the Maruts exchange slangy insults: in 37 Indra reproaches the Maruts (not named but identified by one of their epithets) for not honoring their partnership by even thinking of abandoning him, while they reply in 38 by suggesting that he should have thought of that before, when he was hogging the soma. The unspoken context is the well-known episode when all the gods but the Maruts abandon Indra before the Vr̥tra battle (see, e.g., VIII.96.7, using some of the same vocabulary), and the Maruts later demand from Indra a share in the soma sacrifice because they stood by him (see especially the dialogue hymn I.165). This intriguingly deracinated exchange seems to have been suggested to the poet by verse 36, in which he himself hopes not to be deprived of a comrade. If Indra himself could find himself deserted by his friends, how much more conceivable such a situa-tion is for a mere mortal. This theme of comradeship was announced in the refrain to the first tr̥ca (vss. 1–3) and arises several times elsewhere in the hymn (vss. 16, 18).Though the hymn does not have a clear structure—and its length would have made such a structure difficult to apprehend in a performance situation—the themes and concerns that keep surfacing give some sense of unity, and the two little dialogues at the two ends of the hymn grab the attention.1.

(Some irresolvable irregularities remain.) For the most part, the verses are grouped into two-verse pairs (anomalous pragāthas), but the hymn begins with a tr̥ca (vss. 1–3), and the metrically messy verses 14–16 also appear to form a tr̥ca. The two dānastuti sections (vss. 21–24 and 29–33), broken by two pragāthas to Vāyu, show no internal metrical struc-ture. The meter is discussed by Oldenberg with his characteristic acuity both in the Prolegomena (1888: 109–10) and in the Noten."},{"pageNumber":1140,"pageContent":"VIII.461123The hymn is miscellaneous in content as well. It begins and continues for some time as a fairly standard Indra hymn, insistently focused on begging Indra for gifts of all sorts. The Indra section continues through verse 20, but becomes more and more problematic, with metrical and syntactic difficulties reinforcing each other. Verses 14–16 are metrically almost unanalyzable, and they consist in great part of syntactic fragments the relationships among which are difficult to construct. Verse 17 (paired in a pragātha with 18) equally resists metrical and exegetical certainty, but introduces the Maruts as a counterweight to Indra; in verse 18 we return to more rational metrical structure and, to some degree, analyzable syntax. The last two verses of the Indra section (19–20) are fairly straightforward and bring the praise of Indra to a conclusion with an explosion of adjectives (the first hemistich of 20 is also made entirely of vocatives).The remaining thirteen verses of the hymn consist of three almost equal parts: two dānastutis (vss. 21–24, 29–33), interrupted by a dānastuti-tinged section addressed to the wind god Vāyu, who participates in the Morning Pressing, when the priestly gifts are distributed. Both dānastutis mention extravagant numbers of livestock. In the first the poet Vaśa Aśvya mentions himself (vs. 21) and his patron Pr̥thuśrava s Kānita (vss. 21, 24); the final verse (24) of this first dānastuti has a distinctly sum-mary tone and clearly spells out the cause-and-effect relation between gifts and fame. The second dānastuti mentions a more various set of patrons, and the poet names himself in the final verse (33), as a “great maiden,” clearly his favorite gift, is brought toward him. The diction and style of both dānastutis is straightforward; they lack the sly puns and clever insult-as-praise and praise-as-insult that characterize many dānastutis and seem intent only on counting up the spoils. The four intervening verses (25–28) describes Vāyu’s dawn journey to the sacrifice, but it is made clear that his purpose there is to give, or (vs. 27) to motivate the patron to give, to the poet.1.

The refrain continues through the last third of the hymn (vss. 13–18), but in the non-refrain portions the focus nar-rows—to the elimination of the “bad dream,” which is sent far away to the shadowy figure called Trita Āptya. Nothing else in the scraps of mythology we know about Trita Āptya explains why he should be the scapegoated recipient of our nightmares, much less why he would make them into body ornaments (vs. 15) or use them as food and work (vs. 16). The agent who removes the bad dream to Trita is Dawn (vss. 14–16, 18), whose participation is easier to understand—as anyone knows who has experienced the relief of waking in the morning to discover that the nightmares just experienced were not real.1.

The preparation of soma is not treated here, save for a single reference (vs. 7) to it as “pressed.” Instead the emphasis is on soma’s effects, “when drunk” (pītá vss. 4, 5, 10, 12), on the drinker. The immediate effect is euphoria; as in the famous exultant boast in verse 3 “we have drunk the soma; we have become immortal; we have gone to the light; we have found the gods.” The soma produces a sense of space and boundlessness (vss. 1, 2, 5) while, paradoxically, being confined in the drinker’s body (vss. 2, 9, 10) and hold-ing this body together (vs. 5). The temporal equivalent of this spatial expansion is the wish constantly expressed to “lengthen our lifetime” (vss. 4, 7, 10, 11). Soma is thus characterized by vitality, or life force, which he also confers on the drinker: the first and last verses of the hymn contain this signature word váyas.The mood in the second half of the hymn darkens slightly. Though the poet still sees Soma as his protector and kindly comrade, he senses the threats that cause him to need that protection—threats from outside (vs. 8), from his own imperfect actions (vs. 9), and even from soma itself (vs. 10). Though he ultimately pronounces the threats vanquished (vs. 11), the mood of sheer exuberance has been broken.The final few verses (12–14) take a more ritual turn, with our ceremonial dedica-tion of an oblation to soma, in his connection with the forefathers (who themselves receive soma, as is made clear elsewhere). The ancestor cult thus briefly surfaces here, and the emphasis throughout the hymn on lengthening our lifetimes (on earth) may provide a counterpoint to the ritually shaped afterlife inhabited by our ancestors.1. I of good wisdom have partaken of the vitality of the sweet drink, which is rich in purpose and excellent at finding wide space,which all the gods and mortals, calling it honey, converge upon.2. When you have gone within, you will become Aditi [/boundlessness], appeaser of divine wrath.Drop, enjoying the comradeship of Indra, like an obedient mare following the chariot-pole, you should follow riches to fulfillment."},{"pageNumber":1146,"pageContent":"VIII.4811293.

These are apocryphal or, in Geldner’s felicitous description, “half-apocryphal” (halbapokryph). A number of khilāni or apocrypha were transmitted in the R̥gvedic tradition, but only these eleven (or, in some other reported recensions, somewhat fewer) were inserted into and transmitted within the R̥gveda Saṃhitā itself, as well as in the khilāni collections. Moreover, these eleven were trans-mitted with accents and were treated in the Padapāṭha, the Anukramaṇī (save for the tenth, VIII.58), and so forth, though they were not commented on by Sāyaṇa in his R̥gvedic commentary. In our R̥gveda recension, the Śākalya, they were inserted between the sixth and seventh anuvākas of VIII, though they are reported to appear elsewhere in other recensions, not always in a single group. The Grassmann numbers, 1018–1028, reflect the status of these hymns as addi-tions to the original saṃhitā.The text of these hymns is in general less well transmitted than the rest of the R̥gveda, and the hymns themselves sometimes have the air of a school exer-cise. Notable in this connection is the fact that the first eight hymns proceed in pairs, each pair dedicated to the same divinity (except for a few verses in the third pair, VIII.53–54) and containing the same number of verses in the same meter (except for a few verses in the last pair, VIII.55–56). Moreover, the first pair (VIII.49–50) and, to a much lesser extent, the second pair (VIII.51–52) follow the same model, verse by verse, often using identical or near identical vocabulary but varying grammar, or else employing transparent lexical sub-stitution but keeping the grammar the same, and one can imagine that the two hymns represent separate realizations of a set pedagogical task. However, whatever the reason for their coupling, the pairs afford us interesting insights into the composition of R̥gvedic hymns. For this reason, as well as the fact that puzzles in one hymn of the pair are sometimes illuminated by the parallel passages in the other, we will comment on the first two sets of paired hymns together."},{"pageNumber":1148,"pageContent":"VIII.49 1131VIII.49 (1018) IndraPraskaṇva Kā ṇva10 verses: br̥hatī alternating with satobr̥hatī, arranged in pragāthas. Parallel to 50.This pair of hymns follows a standard trajectory: the poet exhorts himself to praise Indra for his generosity and his power, and then invites Indra to partake of the soma at his sacrifice, traveling with his fallow bays from wherever he might be. The final pragātha asks Indra to provide the same help and largesse as he has on other occasions at the sacrifices of other, named individuals.The interest in these two hymns lies in the interplay between the quite strict parallelism in parts of each verse and the freedom with which the poet treats the variable portions. There is no space here for a full catalogue of the correspondences, but a few telling patterns will be noted. First, despite the pervasive parallelism there are no repeated pādas between the hymns. The initial verses of the two hymns (49.1, 50.1) are perhaps the most fully parallel, and in subsequent verses the beginnings and ends of pādas and half lines are more likely to be parallel than the middles, not surprisingly given the salience of these positions. Responsion can take a num-ber of different forms. Frequently there is exact responsion, as in 49/50.6c udrī́va vajrinn avatáḥ . . . “Like a well-spring full of water, o mace-bearer. . . . ” Single-word repetitions will ordinarily take the same metrical position, as in the pāda-final surā́dhasam of 49/50.1a. Derivationally different synonyms can correspond, as in 49.5c svadáyanti / 50.5c svádanti, both “they sweeten”; similarly, to stems belonging to the same root but with different nuances, 49.10c ásanoḥ “you won” versus 50.10c ásiṣāsaḥ “you sought to win.” Or an expanded phrase can take the place of a single word, as in 49.8b vā́tā iva “like the winds” versus 50.8b o﻿́jo vā́tasya “the power of the wind.” Synonyms or functionally identical words can respond, as in 49.5b (d)hiyāno﻿́ áśvo ná “being spurred on like a horse” and 50.5b iyāno﻿́ átyo ná “being sped like a steed,” where the morphology and word order are identical, but the lexi-cal realization entirely different. Phonological correspondence is not neglected, as in the adjectives in the parallel phrases 49.8a ajirā́so hárayaḥ “nimble fallow bays” and 50.8a rathirā́so hárayaḥ “fallow bays fit for the chariot.” And of course there is rough semantic parallelism throughout the two hymns, even when there is no lexi-cal, morphological, syntactic, or phonological identity. It is also the case that one of the pair can provide the answer to an obscurity in the other, as in 49.2a where śatānīkeva “like (something) with a hundred facets” responds to 50.2a śatānīkā hetáyaḥ “missiles with a hundred facets,” where the comparandum is explicit.1. Chant forth to Indra, the very generous, in the way that is known—who as a bounteous one possessing many goods—by the thousands, as it were—exerts himself for you singers.2.

Parallel to 52.By contrast to VIII.49–50, the parallelism of these two hymns is quite muted and surfaces only occasionally. Not only are strict responsions rare, but the develop-ment of the thought in each hymn is quite distinct, though both focus on Indra as"},{"pageNumber":1151,"pageContent":"VIII.51 1134generous giver. The correspondence between the two hymns is clearest at the begin-ning: both hymns have almost identical initial verses, save for the personal names of the human hosts. These verses also have the same structure as the final verses of VIII.49–50.10. There is also some verbal responsion in the beginning of verses 3 and 5, throughout much of verse 6, and at the beginning of verse 7, and there are also correspondences that cross verse lines, for instance, 51.6c=52.4c táṃ tvā vayám . . . “we you . . . ,” with the continuation of that pāda (51.6c) maghavann indra girvaṇaḥ “o bounteous Indra who longs for songs” matched in 52.8a.As just noted, both hymns are primarily concerned to stimulate Indra to generos-ity. In VIII.51 are interspersed several obscure references to unknown sagas: verse 2 with the old, prone Praskaṇva set upright (Praskaṇva figures also in nearby VIII.54.8, but only as beneficiary of Indra’s largesse, and he is the poet to whom I.44–50 as well as VIII.49, the first Vālakhilya hymn, are attributed) and Indra’s defeat of Krivi (vs. 8). And in verses 4 and 8, in identical language, an apparently miraculous birth follows ritual and cosmogonic activity. One of these acts is the chanting of a “seven-headed, threefold chant in the highest footstep” (vs. 4), and a stripped-down version of the same phrase, “they chanted the chant” is found in the final verse (10), with the current poets as subject, thus implicitly attributing cosmogonic powers to the poets of today.The construction of VIII.52 is far less orderly than that of 51. It is characterized by subordinate clauses that lack main clauses (e.g., vss. 2, 3), lack of grammatical agreement between apparently coreferential entities (e.g., sg. “whose” picked up by “we” in vs. 4; similar disharmony in vs. 8), and a general looseness of structure especially in the verses that lack all responsion to 51. If this was a school exercise, perhaps it was an unsuccessful one.1.

However, verse 6 not only shares the concern for winning that characterized the previous hymn, but also shares some of its phraseology: it begins with a compound of ā́ji “contest” and two compounds with -pati “lord,” closely paralleling VIII.53.6a, and much of the second half of the verse matches the second half of VIII.53.7.The three pragāthas dedicated to Indra (vss. 1–2, 5–6, 7–8) are interrupted by one to the All Gods, an elementary listing of various groups of gods (vs. 3) and individual gods and natural forces (vs. 4).

The following two verses (2–3) list a miscellany of gifts, including some odd ones. He then praises the Kaṇvas in general (vs. 4) and returns to the gift in the final verse"},{"pageNumber":1156,"pageContent":"VIII.56 1139(5).

The hymn follows the general pattern of VIII.55: the generosity of the patron is praised in the first verse, and the details of the gifts follow, especially in verses 3 and 4. The latter verse describes the presentation of an adorned female whose identity is disputed, as the readings of the R̥gveda and the khila collections differ. Some scholars consider her to be Pūtakratu’s wife, thus the patron’s mother or stepmother, but the daughter of Pūtakratu’s wife (following the R̥gveda reading with some minor adjustment), the patron’s sister or half-sister, might make more sense. The final verse (5) to Agni and Sūrya marks the moment of the kindling of the ritual fire at sunrise, when the ritual gifts are distributed.1. Your immoderate generosity has just been seen, Dasyave Vr̥ka—Your capacious power is like heaven in its extent.2. To me Dasyave Vr̥ka, son of Pūtakratu,granted ten thousands from his own wealth.3.

The first verse explicitly establishes the context as the Third Pressing, which, as we have discussed elsewhere, was probably a recent addition to R̥gvedic rit-ual. And especially in verse 2 there are insoluble textual problems. Since the verse itself is not terribly interesting in content, the difficulties can safely be left aside here.1. You two, o gods worthy of the sacrifice, yoked by your age-old purpose, with your chariotcome here to the powerful (soma?), o Nāsatyas, with your skills. You will drink this Third Pressing here.2. You two have the gods, the thrice eleven, (called upon); those realest of the real have appeared in front.Taking pleasure in our sacrifice, our pressing, drink the soma, o Aśvins, as ones for whom the fire glows.3.

Verse 3 in fact appears to belong to the"},{"pageNumber":1158,"pageContent":"VIII.59 1141Aśvin hymn VIII.57, with which it fits well: the “left-over” soma it mentions is a standard offering in the Third Pressing treated in VIII.57.As for the other two verses, Geldner memorably characterizes verse 1 as a riddle without an answer, and verse 2 as an answer without a preceding riddle. This seems persuasive, and the two verses may have been secondarily connected because of the bahudhā́ “in many forms, in many ways” that appears in the middle of the first pāda of each verse. Proferes argues (2007: 56), again persuasively, that verse 1 inquires about the compact or agreement between the Sacrificer and the priests that is ritu-ally dramatized in the later śrauta system in the ritual of the Tānūnaptra, in which a formal alliance is created among these participants, and he suggests that this verse is a precursor of that later ceremony. Verse 2, on the other hand, has been taken, since Sāyaṇa, as the answer to the riddle posed in X.88.18ab “How many fires and how many suns? How many dawns, and how many waters?” and the tone of this verse is in harmony with the philosophical speculation characteristic of such Xth Maṇḍala hymns.1. This sacrifice here, which the priests, configuring it in many ways, carry out with one mind,and the Brahman who was yoked as reciter—what is the Sacrificer’s compact there [=with them]?2. Just one fire is kindled in many forms; just one sun has projected through all.Just one dawn radiates over this whole (world). In truth just One has developed into this whole (world).3.

In contrast, the hymn has a rather tight structure, with an apparent omphalos: verses 3 and 5 have a number of lexical correspondences, and in particular they both announce a truth (satyám). These correspondences form a ring that defines verse 4, the central verse of the hymn, as the omphalos, as well as containing the “truth” proclaimed in the adja-cent verses. All three verses refer to a group, or groups, of seven in riddling fashion. At least the female “seven” in verses 3 and 4—seven voices, seven sisters—can be"},{"pageNumber":1159,"pageContent":"VIII.59 1142identified as the soma-purifying waters, conceived of as the “seven rivers” of Vedic mythology. (They are called “voices” because of the noise they make, just as one of the words for “river,” nadī́, is derived from the root nad “roar,” an etymology explicitly recognized by Vedic speakers.) The three heptads of verse 5 may refer to the same streams, multiplied, or may evoke the number of gifts Indra and Varuṇa should bestow in response.The omphalos verse is left incomplete: the poet urges the two gods to “estab-lish . . . ” (dhattam [if this is the correct reading, as we think]) but does not specify the object desired. This truncated wish returns at the end of the hymn, however. The final verse contains two occurrences of this same verb, with a plethora of objects. This completion of the unfinished expression of verse 4 may be seen as another example of “poetic repair” (Jamison 2006).Indra and Varuṇa do not form a natural pair, and it is not surprising that very few hymns are dedicated to the two alone (I.17, IV.41–42, VI.68, VII.82–85, and a tr̥ca in III.62 [1–3]). In the more prominent hymns to both divinities, especially the justly celebrated IV.42, their contrastive qualities, especially their different types of kingship, are highlighted. Here by contrast the two gods are essentially featureless (the possible exception is 2cd), their only activities being to accept the soma offer-ing and give prosperity to the sacrificers in return. In fact, vocabulary appropriate to a more standard pair of gods, the Aśvins, is adapted here, especially the vocative “you two lords of beauty” (śubhas patī), a common epithet otherwise confined to the Aśvins.1. These portions here run to you two, Indra and Varuṇa; run forth to you when the (soma-drinks) are pressed, for your great (generosity?).At every sacrifice you bustle toward the pressings, when you do your best for the sacrificer who presses (soma).2. The plants and waters, offering tribute to these two, have reached greatness, o Indra and Varuṇa—the two who run on the far side of dusky space, at the far limit of their road, the two of whom no non-god vaunts himself as their rival.3. This is really true, Indra and Varuṇa: the seven “voices” of Kr̥śa milk out a wave of honey for you two.With these, you lords of beauty, help the pious man who, undeceivable, keeps watch over you with his thoughts.4. The ghee-sprinkling companions of soma, possessing lively drops, the seven sisters in the seat of truth,who are ghee-dripping for you two, Indra and Varuṇa—with these establish . . . .

Nonetheless, the order of deities and the number of verses per hymn provide good evidence. We follow Oldenberg’s (1888: 216–18) proposed structure.The next collection of hymns (VIII.60–66) is ascribed to Pragātha and several of his sons.

The sacrificial context returns at this point, and in verses 11–12 the sacrificers seek to harness Indra as their comrade, whose powers they wish to marshal for their protection against hostile forces (see esp. vss. 13, 15–18).The syntax is fairly straightforward, but there are a number of rare words and hapaxes (e.g., the last two words of vs. 9) and pleasing verbal plays. The poet espe-cially likes variable repetition (of the type “unassailable assailant” vs. 3).1.

The relationship between Indra and the sacrificers seems to become stronger as the hymn progresses, its growth tracked through the word “yoke.” In the early verses of the hymn Indra is isolated in his accomplishments: in verse 2 he is said to be “without yokemate” and to accomplish his deeds alone; in verse 3 he is about to win even with an unsatisfactory horse. But after he comes to the sacrifice, the exchange relationship between worshiper and god comes to the fore (vs. 5) and already in verse 6 the poet announces that Indra makes the soma-offerer his partner and “yokemate.” By the penultimate verse (11) the poet himself, in the first person, proposes that the god and the mortal “yoke ourselves together,” to achieve the winnings Indra was on the point of winning alone in verse 3.

The hymn’s structure, by contrast, is rather simple and follows a straightforward trajectory, with each of the four tr̥cas expressing a different theme.The hymn opens with a mysterious figure, the “tracker,” who is smeared or anointed with mental constructs—intentions and insights—by two different agents, who can be plausibly identified as the gods and Manu in his role as father of mankind and the first sacrificer. This liminal figure, the tracker, is most likely a ritual mediator between the divine and the human, and Agni makes the most sense as the referent. The second verse confirms the ritual setting, and in the third verse Indra makes his first appearance, in his role as opener of the Vala cave. This mythological reference calls dawn to mind, and suggests the time of the current sacrifice. Thus, the first tr̥ca establishes the scene as the Morning Pressing.The second tr̥ca (vss. 4–6) then calls Indra to that sacrifice; each verse contains the word arká “chant.” In the third tr̥ca (vss. 7–10) various deeds of Indra are celebrated, especially his defeat of enemies for the Five Peoples (vs. 7) and his involvement, with Viṣṇu, in the killing of the Emuṣa boar (vs. 9), a myth which is a specialty of this part of Maṇḍala VIII (VIII.69.14–15; 77.1–2, 6–8, 10–11; 96.2). Here only the preliminaries, in which a rice porridge is fetched by Viṣṇu to nourish Indra, are treated. The middle verse 8 mentions Indra’s manly deeds in general, but also contains the phrase “you furthered the turning of the wheel” (cakrásya"},{"pageNumber":1167,"pageContent":"VIII.631150vartaním), which reminds us of the later designation cakra-vartin “turner of the wheel” for a universal monarch. The last tr̥ca (vss. 10–12) introduces the Maruts and finally the gods in general as associates of Indra and calls on all of them for help.1. The tracker [=Agni?], stationed in front, has been smeared with the intentions of the great ones [=gods],he on whose doors father Manu smeared insightful thoughts to the gods.2. The stones with soma on their backs have sat up, as if to the measure of heaven.The solemn words and sacred formulations are now to be recited.3. Indra, knowing how, uncovered the cows for the Aṅgirases.That manly act of his is to be praised.4. As of old, let Indra, strengthener of poets, fortifier of speech,the kindly one, come among us for help at the pouring of our chant.5. And therefore, following the intention of your will, those eager to sacrifice (have cried out) “hail!”;their chants have cried out to (you), who are swollen with strength, Indra, to give of the cowpen.6. All heroic deeds, both done and to be done, are in Indra,whom the chants know as the very ceremony itself.7. When cries were sent surging to Indra by the clan belonging to the Five Peoples,through the power of their inspiration, through the power of his measure he laid the strangers low. He is peaceful dwelling.8. Here is the praise that follows you: you did these manly deeds;you furthered the turning of the wheel.9. (Viṣṇu) strode widely to the rice porridge for this bull to live on.(Indra) took it, as cattle do barley.10. Seeking help as we present this (praise hymn), through you (all) might we have skill as our fatherfor the strengthening of the one accompanied by the Maruts [=Indra].11. Yes indeed! through our chanters we cry out again and again for your establishment according to the ritual sequence, o champion.Let us conquer with you as our yokemate, Indra.12. For us are the Rudras [=Maruts] in their profusion and the mountains of one accord at the Vr̥tra-smashing, where the call is “Carry (the day)!”The steadfast one who has been established for the praiser and presser—with him, Indra, as their chief let the gods help us."},{"pageNumber":1168,"pageContent":"VIII.641151VIII.64 (673) IndraPragātha Kā ṇva12 verses: gāyatrī, arranged in tr̥casA hymn artful in its extreme simplicity. Its diction, its syntax, and its structure are all straightforward. It consists of four tr̥cas. The first (vss. 1–3) begs Indra for gifts and aid against enemies and celebrates his preeminence. The second (vss. 4–6) calls him to the sacrifice. The third (vss. 7–9) consists of rhetorical questions about Indra’s whereabouts and the possibility of his consorting with other sacrificers. The final one (vss. 10–12) presents him with the just-pressed soma.The transparency of the hymn is produced in great part by its syntax: many of the verses contain several short, generally pāda-length sentences (vs. 1 is a typi-cal example), and more extreme concision is encountered in the abrupt series of imperatives “come! run! drink!” in the last tr̥ca (vss. 10c and 12c; cf. also 4a). Even when the sentence extends beyond the pāda, it often deploys simple parallel con-stituents across two pādas (e.g., vss. 3ab, 6ab). There is also no overt subordination in the hymn (unless we count the nahí [“for not”] clause of 2c). There are almost no past tenses (only in 5c [perfect] and 9a [aorist]); the finite verb forms are otherwise limited to imperatives, indicative presents, and one presential perfect (8c).The sentiments expressed and the vocabulary are likewise uncomplex and stan-dard. Only the penultimate verse (11), with its apparent references to locales for finding soma, causes any interpretive problems.1. Let the praises whip you up. Show your generosity, o master of the stones.Strike down the haters of sacred formulations.2. With your foot stamp down the ungenerous niggards. You are great,for no one is equal to you.3.

And indeed it shows important similarities to VIII.64. It, too, tends to short, often pāda-length, syntactic units and to balanced parallel constituents (e.g., 2a, c, 6ab), and there are even agreements in wording: the abrupt verse-final imperative “drink!” of VIII.64.10 and 12 is repeated in 65.5 and 8 (with the former also containing éhi “come!” like the examples in VIII.64), and “we call upon” appears in the same verse (6) in the same position in both hymns.However, VIII.65 introduces some complications absent from VIII.64. Unlike 64, which had no subordination at all, 65 begins with a subordinating conjunction (yád), which occurs three times in the first two verses, and verse 2 finds its main clause only in verse 3. (See also vs. 7.) Though present indicatives and imperatives predominate, the range of verbal forms is somewhat widened as well, with injunctives (9b, 10c), aor-ists (8b, 12c), a subjunctive (2b), a preterital perfect (probably, 11c), and a number of dative infinitives, as well as two of the much discussed -ṣé forms (5a).The diction can be more resistant than that of VIII.64, as in verse 2 where the choices given to Indra are puzzling. Are these places (as in the also puzzling 64.11) or sources of exhilaration, and are there two choices or three? What do the opaque phrases, especially “the sea of the stalk,” refer to?Like VIII.64 this hymn consists of four tr̥cas. The last (vss. 10–12) is clearly defined as a dānastuti. The other three are not thematically differentiated. They all call on Indra to attend our sacrifice, and the major concern running throughout is that rival sacrificers are competing with us for his presence (e.g., vss. 1, 2, 7, 9). These first three tr̥cas, before the dānastuti, display ring composition: the command"},{"pageNumber":1170,"pageContent":"VIII.661153“drive here straightaway” (ā́ yāhi tū́yam) in 1c is echoed in 9b “come here straight-away” (tū́yam ā́ gahi).1.

Oldenberg suggests (Noten ad loc.) that it may consist of two hymns (or even three): verses 1–8"},{"pageNumber":1171,"pageContent":"VIII.661154and 9–14, with verse 15 appended in a different meter. However, as he also notes (1888: 217), there is no strong internal support for this division, and it may very well be a single hymn.The invitation to Indra to the soma sacrifice is the primary theme of the hymn. It begins with a call for Indra’s help (vs. 1) and continues with descriptions of the sac-rificial offerings (vss. 5–8, 11–12), along with the usual hope that Indra will choose our sacrifice over those of others (see esp. vs. 12). The poet remarks particularly on the regular and predictable nature of the sacrifice (vs. 7), and in a striking image in verse 8 suggests to Indra that, since even the apparently uncontrollable wolf follows its own routine, Indra should make it a habit to attend our sacrifice as he has before. The regular nature of the sacrifice has its drawbacks, of course: many others before us and many others around us have performed and continue to perform it, but the poet assures Indra in verse 11 that although he and his comrades are only the most recent among the sacrificers, their formulations are novel and unprecedented (see also vs. 5). The competition between us and the others is emphasized by the numer-ous occurrences of “many” in this hymn.Interspersed are verses celebrating Indra’s power and his aid to his worshipers (vss. 2–4, 9–10). Not all of this praise is entirely clear, especially that in 3ab, where Indra is identified with two hapaxes, our translations of which are quite provisional. In the final pragātha (vss. 13–14) the poet makes his strongest plea for Indra’s help. The final verse (15), in a different meter as noted, is puzzling. It reassures an oth-erwise unknown group of people, the Kalis, that if they press soma, whatever is threatening them will disappear.1. With staying power and force (I call for) Indra, finder of goods, for help;as (we) sing loftily at the rite with its pressed soma, I call (for him) as if for the takings of a decisive victor,2. Whom neither obdurate nor substantial hindrances will obstruct when the fair-lipped one is in the exhilaration of the stalk,who, tearing them out for the laboring presser, is the giver of praiseworthy (goods) to the singer.3.

The final six verses are a dānastuti to a set of patrons whose names and identities are not entirely easy to sort out.The Indra portion is conventional, with an emphasis on his extreme power and might. The dānastuti is likewise comparatively straightforward compared to others of this genre, with a catalogue of the gifts received and a promise to the patrons, expressed in surprisingly negative terms, that even a man who wishes to insult them will not be able to do so (vs. 19).1.

Although many details remains obscure, the thematic outline of the hymn becomes clearer when that structure has been discerned. In our view, the hymn falls into two halves (vss. 1–9, 10–18), which are exactly parallel. Each consists of two tr̥cas (1–6, 10–15), followed by a single verse celebrating the partnership between Indra and the poet (7, 16), and ending with two verses concerning the Priyamedhas’ ritual offering to Indra (8–9, 17–18). The parallelism is especially clear in the final three verses of each half: both 7 and 16 contain the dual optative sacevahi “might we two become comrades” and concern a journey of a certain number of steps. In both 8–9 and 17–18 the Priyamedhas are explicitly mentioned. They are exhorted to ritual per-formance in verses 8–9, while in 17–18, as is suitable in hymn-final verses, their per-formance is summarized. The parallelism between the opening tr̥cas of both halves is much freer, though there are rough correspondences.The relationship between the two tr̥cas of the first half is noteworthy. The first tr̥ca (vss. 1–3) is quite puzzling, with opaque phraseology and uncertain references; the second tr̥ca (vss. 4–6) seems a double of the first, paraphrasing and explaining it, in a sort of global example of “poetic repair” (Jamison 2006). The second tr̥ca exhorts the poet to “chant forth” to Indra (vs. 4), and the next two verses describe the preparation of soma for Indra, with the soma drops racing to the milk (con-ceptualized, as so often, as cows). With this in mind we can approach the first tr̥ca. In verse 1 the opening phrase “forth, forth” recalls the similar phrase in verse 4 and allows the verb “chant” to be supplied (see also vs. 8). In verse 1 the recipient of what is chanted, the poem, identified as “triṣṭubh refreshment,” is clearly Soma (“the drop”), not Indra as in verse 4, but the constructions are parallel. The poem is"},{"pageNumber":1177,"pageContent":"VIII.691160then the subject of the second half of the verse, as it seeks to win something unspec-ified. In our opinion the subject of verse 2 is this same poem, taking aim at Soma (the “roaring bull”) among the cows, who represent the milk-mixture. In verse 3 the soma mixture is prepared for Indra, and, it seems, for the rest of the gods.This matched pair of triplets is followed by the remarkable verse 7, in which the poet proposes a partnership between himself and Indra, a partnership to be sealed by the symbolic seven steps that in the later marriage ceremony make a marriage legal after the bride and groom have taken them, and that already in the R̥gveda (X.8.4) are the symbolic act creating a contract or alliance. The phrase “the seven(th) step of the comrade” seems to refer to this ceremonial institution. In order to make this alliance the poet and Indra go to Indra’s own home and drink the soma together, having made the journey over the surface of the sea of soma (in our view, though others consider this to be a reference to the sun). The relationship between poet and god is thus a surprisingly intimate one, remi-niscent of that between the poet Vasiṣṭha and Varuṇa in VII.86–89, especially the verses describing their former comradeship with grammatical constructions and lexicon very similar to those here (VII.88.3–5). It is also similar to nearby VIII.62.11, where the poet again proposes that he and Indra yoke themselves together. The first half of the hymn is then brought to a close by the aforemen-tioned exhortation to the Priyamedhas to chant to Indra (vs. 8), with a tantaliz-ing glimpse of what appear to be three musical instruments accompanying them (vs. 9).The two tr̥cas opening the second half of the hymn (vss. 10–15) reverse the order of obscurity. The first (vss. 10–12) is relatively straightforward and, at least to begin with, matches material in the first half: the speckled cows giving milk for the soma mixture in verse 10 remind us of the dappled cows and their milk in verse 3 (also 5–6), and Indra and other gods partake of the soma in verse 11, though the pres-ence and role of Varuṇa in verses 11–12 are somewhat puzzling. However, it is the next tr̥ca (vss. 13–15) that almost defeats the interpreter, especially verse 13. There is no agreement even on what god (or gods) the verse concerns, much less on what the actions in question are and whether the verse is a self-contained syntactic unit. We are inclined to take the verse as a suite of relative clauses referring to Indra, who is triumphantly proclaimed in verse 14. The second half of verse 14 alludes to the Emuṣa myth (also treated in VIII.77, etc.), in which, it seems, Indra as a boy slew a boar named Emuṣa by shooting through a mountain, and brought (or Viṣṇu brought him) a rice porridge and some buffalo (which had been protected by the boar?) from the mountain. The next verse (15) most likely also concerns this myth, or it may refer to another of Indra’s boyhood deeds. There are numerous difficulties in these three verses, and our translation is only provisional.The following verse (16) brings us back to the present, with the poet’s second proposition of fellowship to Indra, again in the course of a journey. And the final two verses (17–18) summarize the Priyamedhas’ ritual efforts and pronounces them even better than before."},{"pageNumber":1178,"pageContent":"VIII.691161We cannot claim to have settled the many issues of this hymn, but the structure outlined above does give a context in which to evaluate the difficulties that remain.1. Forth, (chant) forth your triṣṭubh refreshment to the drop that invigorates heroes.With your visionary thought and with plenitude it is seeking to win, in order to gain wisdom.2.

These dappled cows, which give the sweetening milk, prepare the soma for him [=Indra].At its birth the clans of the gods are in the three luminous realms of heaven.4. Chant forth with a song to the lord of cows, to Indra, in the way that is known,to the son of the real, the master of settlements.5. The tawny (soma-drops) have been let loose at the ruddy (cows) upon the ritual grass,where we will bellow out together.6. The cows have milked out the milk-mixture for Indra, the honey for the mace-bearer,since he found them in the remote place.7. As we two, Indra and (I), go up to his home along the surface of the coppery (soma),having drunk of the honey three times, might we two become comrades at the seven(th) step of the comrade.8. Chant! Chant forth! Chant, o Priyamedhas!Let your little sons chant, and you—chant boldly as if against a fortress.9. The Gargara(-instrument) will gurgle downward, the Godhā(-vīṇā) will keep resounding all around,and the Piṅgā(-string) will keep quivering all around. The sacred formulation is offered up to Indra.10. When the speckled (cows), who yield good milk and never kick, fly here,take hold of the kicking soma for Indra to drink.11.

The first six verses consist of three pragāthas in br̥hatī alternating with satobr̥hatī, the next six (7–12) of two tr̥cas in br̥hatī, and the last three (13–15) of verses in three different meters, but all consisting of eight syl-lable or a mixture of eight and twelve syllable lines, like the br̥hatī/satobr̥hatī verses before them.The thematic divisions correspond well with these metrical divisions. The first six verses are extravagant praise of Indra’s unequalled power. Having flat-tered him with his praise, the poet occupies the tr̥ca portion with the usual requests for Indra to exercise his generosity and, more strikingly, for him to pun-ish mortals who do not worship him and do not follow the Ārya way, with the"},{"pageNumber":1180,"pageContent":"VIII.701163culminating verse 11 listing the numerous ways in which this evil man can deviate from the proper path. One of the stylistic features especially of the tr̥ca section (but see also vs. 4) is the tendency for the final word or words of the c and d pādas to match (4cd, 7cd, 8cd, 11cd, 12cd; see also 9a+d), and there are other verse-internal echoes.The final three verses (13–15) are a dānastuti of Śara Śauradevya, or rather what we might term an anti-dānastuti or, technically, a satire. The first of these verses (13) poses a rhetorical question that seems to promise lavish praise to come, but the poet takes this back in verse 14 with another rhetorical question: will you really receive praise for a gift that consists of calves doled out in miserly fashion? The final verse specifies just how miserly: a single calf for three poets. In these verses the standard vocabulary of generosity (benefactor, patron, bounteous one) is deployed sarcasti-cally, and the poet cleverly gives his criticism a gloss of praise.For an analysis of the phonetic and grammatical features of the entire hymn, see Watkins (1995: 184–87).1. He who is king of the separate peoples, a driver with chariots, rich,an overcomer in all battles, who is sung as the preeminent smasher of Vr̥tra—2.

As Oldenberg suggested (1888: 217; Noten ad loc.), it could be made up of two separate hymns, and the lack of thematic continuity in fact favors this divi-sion, though there is some shared vocabulary. The first names of the two alternative poets suggested by the Anukramaṇī were extracted from verse 14.The first nine verses beg Agni’s protection for the pious worshiper from all manner of malign and threatening forces, particularly those of other humans. It is"},{"pageNumber":1182,"pageContent":"VIII.711165Agni’s power as a god that is emphasized, with mortals hostile or devout subject to this superior divine power, to be punished or rewarded, as they deserve.The second part of the hymn (vss. 10–15) is dominated by a stylistic pattern: Agni in the accusative case is the goal of sacrificial actions and words throughout this section. In verse 10 he is not named, but an epithet in the accusative is found in every pāda of the verse. His name (agním) begins the next verse (11a), and in the subsequent verses it is featured again and again. Verse 12 contains five occurrences of agním, one beginning every pāda, plus one in the middle of the third. Verse 13 varies the pattern by beginning with a nominative form of the name, but the second half-verse returns to the initial accusative, which continues through the subsequent verses: three examples of initial agním in verse 14 (pādas a, c, d), two in the final verse (15a, b). The interplay between our ritual devotion and prayers and his gifts and aid is the topic of this section, but the content is far less noticeable than the form.1. O Agni, protect us by your great powers from all hostilityand from mortal hatred.2. For no human fury is master of you (gods), o (Agni), born dear.Just you are the protector of the earth.3.

Mete out a measure of your great good, o child of nourishment, to uswho are your singers, o comrade, o good one.10.

The Anukramaṇī gives two choices: Agni or “praise of oblations” (haviṣāṃ stutiḥ). There are several good reasons to prefer the second designation, or at least to reject the first. On the one hand, Agni is named only once, close to the end (vs. 15) and in conjunction with Indra. Though the ritual fire and its divine representative are clearly the referents in a number of verses, a number of different ritual substances and apparatus are also referred to through the hymn; the fire is not significantly more prominent. Moreover, as Oldenberg points out (1888: 217), the third hymn in this little collection is clearly to Agni, so that the first should have a different dedicand.As a number of scholars have noted, the hymn contains a sequence of ritual moments, sometimes even quoting from mantras found in later ritual, depicted in allusive and indirect fashion. Although some have tried to find a systematic and sequential representation of the, or a, sacrifice, these efforts have not been suc-cessful. Rather we seem to have a set of discontinuous sacrificial vignettes, cast as riddles. Though nowhere near as famous as the well-known riddle hymn (I.164), this hymn resembles that one in certain ways, including a fondness for numerology (vss. 7–9) and for unidentified referents (throughout).We confess to being uncertain about many of the answers to these implicit rid-dles, and for others the machinery of explanation would overwhelm the poetry. We have therefore for the most part avoided parenthetical identifications and para-phrases. In general the first verses (esp. 2–5) seem to concern Agni and the initiation"},{"pageNumber":1184,"pageContent":"VIII.721167of the sacrifice, signaled by the sighting of the horses and chariot (of the sun?) in verse 6. Most of the rest of the hymn, verses 7–17, concerns the preparation of soma. The final verse (18) has much the same structure as verse 6, which closed the first section of the hymn, and has similar annunciatory function.1. Make oblation! He will come here. The Adhvaryu seeks (him) again,knowing his command.2. The Hotar sits down beside the sharp soma-plant, in Manu’s presence,taking pleasure in its companionship.3. They seek him within (themselves) and among the people, (seek him) as Rudra beyond inspired thought.With his tongue they grasp the grain.4. I have heated my familial bow. Imparting vital force, he has mounted the wood.With his tongue he has struck the millstone.5. The gleaming calf, roaming here, does not find anyone to bind it.It pursues its mama to praise (her).6. And it’s just now that his team of horses, great and lofty,the binder of the chariot, has been sighted.7. The seven (priests) milk the one (cow [=soma plant?]), and the two (=hands?) send the five (fingers?) nearby,at the ford of the river, at its sound.8. With the ten (fingers) of Vivasvant, Indra has agitated the caskof heaven with his triple hammer.9. A newer firebrand goes around the ceremonial course three times.With honey the Hotars perform the anointing.10. With reverence they dip out the encompassing wellspring with its (water-)wheel aboveand its sides facing downward, the inexhaustible one.11. The pressing stones are just on their way to it. The honey has been poured down into the lotusat the wellspring’s surging forth.12. O cows, approach the wellspring with help.

Into the pressed soma pour glory [=milk], the full glory of the two world-halves.The Rasā (River [=water]) should receive the bull.14. They [=soma juices] recognize their own home. Like calves coming together with their mothers,they pair off with their kin [=milk and water].15.

The poorly understood story of the Aśvins’ res-cue of Atri is mentioned in verses 3 and 7–8, their relation to Saptavadhri in verse 9, and an unnamed figure, sometimes identified by commentators as Saptavadhri, is addressed in the final verses 17–18. The stories of Atri and Saptavadhri (who are sometimes considered to be the same person) have often been discussed, and radically incompatible plots have been reconstructed for them. See, for example, Jamison (1991: 212–46) and, more recently, Houben (2010), who discusses previous accounts. Houben emphatically rejects Jamison’s version, and his own has some points in its favor but remains unconvincing in its entirety, at least to us.1. Rise up for the man who acts according to truth; hitch up your chariot, o Aśvins.– Let the help of you two become truly nearby.2. Drive here with your chariot that is quicker even than a wink, Aśvins.– Let the help of you two become truly nearby.3.

The first four (vss. 1–12) concentrate on the formal praise and invocation of Agni, who appears in three of the four (vss. 1–6, 10–12) insistently as the accusative object of the reverent approach of the worshipers. (The other tr̥ca, verses 7–9, has the worshiper’s prayerful thought as its subject.)"},{"pageNumber":1187,"pageContent":"VIII.741170Somewhat surprisingly, Agni is several times associated with a lexical and mythic complex far more characteristic of Indra: obstacle [/Vr̥tra] smashing. Agni is called the best smasher of obstacles in verse 4, and the theme returns in verses 9 and 12. This association may have been triggered here by the identification of Agni as the tribal fire of the Anu (vs. 4), the group whose leader appears to be the poet’s patron Śrutarvan (vss. 4, 13, 15). The tribal fire represents the (temporary) unifi-cation of separate groups of people generally mobilizing against outside threat, and an obstacle-smashing tribal fire would serve their purposes well. Although the unification theme is not insistent in the hymn, notice that the first verse begins by announcing Agni’s affiliation with every clan, “dear to many” (vs. 1ab), and the joint invocation of Agni by various peoples is repeatedly mentioned (vss. 2, 6, 10, 12).The final tr̥ca (vss. 13–15), with slightly different metrical structure, is the poet’s dānastuti of Śrutarvan and his gift of four horses and a chariot. Though it is not as self-consciously clever as some dānastutis, verse 13 contains a nice pun.1. The guest of every clan, dear to many, (shall we praise) on your behalf as (we) seek the prize;Agni belonging to the house shall I praise on your behalf, (with) speech and with thoughts of fortifying song—2.

The Indra hymns are all assigned to the same Kāṇva poet by the Anukramaṇī, but the other two hymns have different authors, 75 an Āṅgirasa, 79 a Bhārgava.VIII.75 (684) AgniVirūpa Āṅgirasa16 verses: gāyatrī arranged in tr̥casAgni’s role in the sacrifice and his relationship with the poet-sacrificers is the subject of the first two conventional tr̥cas (vss. 1–6), but a martial, indeed a belligerent, strain appears beginning with verse 7. The setting seems to be a contest for cattle or a cattle raid, and the poet calls on Agni to use his aggressive powers to defeat encroaching threats and assure victory and the winning of cattle and wealth (vss. 7–13). The hymn ends with general, and less combative, prayers for help for the sacrificer (vss. 14–16).1. Harness your horses that best summon the gods, o Agni, like a charioteer.Take your seat as the primordial Hotar.2. And as one who knows better, invite the gods for us, o god.Make our trust (in the sacrifice) into all things worth desiring,3.

The Maruts are mentioned as Indra’s companions in each of the first nine verses, and the invitation to soma occu-pies the middle six verses (4–9), while the Vr̥tra myth, glancingly alluded to, occupies much of the first tr̥ca. Only the last tr̥ca lacks mention of the Maruts."},{"pageNumber":1190,"pageContent":"VIII.761173The first verse of the last tr̥ca (10) appears to present the soma-drinking as accomplished, and Indra’s role as Dasyu-smiter is celebrated in the next (11). The final verse of the hymn (12) is a meta-verse describing the production of the hymn itself. The numerological expression “eight-footed, nine-cornered” is, as Oldenberg suggests (Noten ad loc.), a reference to the gāyatrī tr̥cas in which this hymn is composed, with eight-syllable lines arranged into three verses of three pādas each.Although the hymn is simple, it makes implicit reference to a complex ritual development—that, in the course of the R̥gvedic period, the Midday Pressing, orig-inally dedicated entirely to Indra, made room for the Maruts as joint recipients of the soma with Indra. An important mythological treatment of this ritual innova-tion is found in I.165 and related hymns. Here we see only the liturgical result, an insistence on Indra Marutvant in a soma-drinking context.1. This master of artifice here I now invoke, Indra, holding sway by his might,accompanied by the Maruts—as if to twist (him here).2. This Indra here, with the Maruts as comrades, split apart the head of Vr̥trawith a hundred-jointed mace.3.

An eight-footed nine-cornered speech that touches the truth—I have measured out its body because of Indra.VIII.77 (686) IndraKurusuti Kāṇva11 verses: gāyatrī arranged in tr̥cas 1–9; br̥hatī 10, satobr̥hatī 11, arranged in a pragāthaThis hymn primarily treats the obscure Emuṣa myth, a boyhood deed of Indra’s. As far as can be determined, in the R̥gvedic version (there are later Vedic prose ver-sions, e.g., Taittirīya Saṃhitā VI.2.4.2–3) the just-born Indra, after a brief dialogue with his mother, takes a bow named Bunda and kills a boar named Emuṣa, allow-ing him to capture (or Viṣṇu to capture for him) a special mess of rice porridge, as well as some buffalo, which he cooks for his father and mother. The most impor-tant (and essentially only) R̥gvedic passages about this myth outside of VIII.77 are I.61.7, VIII.45.4–5, VIII.69.14–15, and VIII.96.2.Our hymn begins with Indra’s dialogue with his mother (vss. 1–2), a dialogue found in the same words in VIII.45.4–5. Since in that passage Indra takes the Bunda bow prior to questioning his mother, we can connect the first two verses of this hymn with the story in verses 6–8, even though the Bunda bow is not men-tioned here in verses 1–2 and other material intervenes. Between the dialogue of verses 1–2 and the rest of the story starting in verse 6 are several references to other deeds of Indra’s, at least one of them (vs. 5) even more obscure than the Emuṣa myth. It does seem likely, however, that the drinking of prodigious amounts of soma in verse 4 is part of the Emuṣa story: in III.48, also about Indra’s boyhood and his relationship to mother and father, he consumes vast amounts of soma right after birth.When the story is taken up again, we first are given a general summary of the myth in 6ab, and then the first incident in the story, the taking of the Bunda bow, in 6c. In our opinion, verse 8 is the speech of Indra’s mother, urging him to cap-ture the porridge by means of the bow. Her “just born right now” (vs. 8c) echoes the “just born” that begins verse 1, and these two phrases form a ring defining the Emuṣa story. Verse 7 continues the story of the Bunda bow and the aiming of the arrow. Verse 9, the final verse in the gāyatrī meter, is a standard summary of Indra’s great deeds.The last two verses (10–11) are in different meter. The first gives a précis of the myth, introducing Viṣṇu’s role in securing the rice porridge, a detail that does not appear in accord with verse 6. The final pāda of verse 10 identifies Indra’s opponent as a boar (no mention of the boar in the earlier verses) and in its final word provides"},{"pageNumber":1192,"pageContent":"VIII.771175the boar’s name, Emuṣa, as the solution of the riddle. (The name Emuṣa occurs only here in the R̥gveda.) The version given in verse 10 agrees better with the one in I.61.7 than it does with the treatment in the rest of this hymn and indeed in the rest of Maṇḍala VIII, which contains the other pertinent passages, and one wonders if the poet was trying to harmonize two versions that he knew of this myth by tack-ing the Viṣṇu verse onto the Viṣṇu-less version found in the gāyatrī portion of the hymn. The final verse (11) is a high rhetorical celebration of the Bunda bow and of Indra’s arms that wield it.1. Just born, the one of a hundred resolves asked his mother,“Which ones are powerful; which ones are famed?”2. Then she, the strong one [/Śava sī], named to him Aurṇavābha [/the spider’s son] and Ahīśuva [/the one puffed up like a snake].“Let them be (yours) to lay low, son.”3. The Vr̥tra-smiter just hammered them together, like spokes in a nave with a hammer.When grown up, he became smiter of Dasyus.4. At one shot he drank thirty ponds at once,hogsheads [?] of soma—(did) Indra.5. He bored through to the Gandharva in the bottomless dusky realms,to strengthen the composers of sacred formulations—(did) Indra.6. He pierced (the boar Emuṣa), pierced the cooked rice porridge forth from the mountains, and held it fast.Indra (took) the well-stretched Bunda-bow.7. Your arrow with a hundred ruddy glints and a thousand feathers was the single onethat you made into your yokemate, o Indra.8. [Indra’s mother:] “With it [=Bunda-bow] bring to the praisers, to the superior men and to their ladies, (the rice porridge?) to eat,though you were just born right now, o steadfast one of the R̥bhus.”9. These highest exploits performed by you in profusionyou held fast with your whole heart.10. All these things Viṣṇu brought here, the wide-striding one spurred on by you:a hundred buffaloes, a rice porridge cooked in milk—(when) Indra (pierced) the boar Emuṣa.11.

The first tr̥ca (vss. 1–3) barely mentions the offerings we make to Indra in the haste to list the things we want in return, down to the earrings in verse 3. The last tr̥ca (vss. 7–9) praises both Indra and Soma for their (potential) generosity, and verse 9 gives another list of desired gifts. Verse 10, in a different meter, may be the most egregious of all: the poet, picking up the desire he expressed for grain in verse 9, tells Indra he plans to do no labor for his grain, but expects Indra to deliver it, not only grown but processed—preferably stacked, but at least mown. So Indra is expected to serve as farmhand! This verse may indirectly express the stockbreeder’s disdain for agriculture.The middle tr̥ca (vss. 4–6) contrasts somewhat with its surroundings. Though the greed motif is found in verse 4, it is expressed in terms of Indra’s unique pow-ers to increase wealth, to win goods, and to give them. The rhetorical pattern set in this verse carries into the following verses, where the description of the god’s powers becomes more general. However, the theme of the rest of the hymn is not far from the surface, for Indra’s ability to see and to anticipate everything a mortal might do would allow him to identify proper recipients and deny gifts to those who behave badly.1. (Taking pleasure) in the offering cake and of the soma-stalk, Indra, bring here to us a thousandand a hundred cows, o champion.2.

None of the physical or ceremonial properties of soma the substance, the ritual drink, is found in this hymn. There is only indirect reference to the preparation of soma, in verse 3, where the “body-makers,” presumably the priests who prepare the soma, are given shelter from hatred, and in verse 4 soma is called “possessor of the silvery (drink) [that is, soma itself],” an epithet otherwise almost exclusively used of Indra.Instead of the ritual soma, we have here a portrait of an all-powerful and multi-talented divine helper: a winner (vs. 1), a poet (vs. 1), a healer (vs. 2), a giver (vs. 5), a finder of lost objects (vs. 6), and especially a protector from hostility (vss. 3, 4, 9). Only in verse 8 is there any hint that Soma might ever be anything but benevolent to us, but this hint is not developed.1. Here is the effective gambler, ungraspable, all-conquering Soma, who got the lucky break—a seer, an inspired poet with poetic skill.2. He covers over what is naked; he heals everything that is sick.The blind man sees; the lame sets forth.3. O Soma, for those who create your body [=soma-pressers] you hold out a broad defensefrom the hateful things done by others.4. You possessor of the silvery drink—through your perception, through your skills you keep away from heaven and earththe hatred of any evil man.5. And when those with (ritual) tasks proceed to their tasks, they will surely reach the generosity of the giver,should they (manage to) deflect the desire of the thirsting man.6.

But 87 can in fact be broken into two original hymns, to produce the proper sequence. The poets named by the Anukramaṇī are various.VIII.80 (689) Indra (1–9), Gods (10)Ekadyū Naudhasa10 verses: gāyatrī, probably arranged in tr̥cas, except final verse, triṣṭubh 10The final pāda of this hymn (10d) is the same as the refrain in the verbally clever and finely structured hymns of Nodhas Gautama in Maṇḍala I (I.58, 60–64). (R̥gveda I.59 is also attributed to him, but lacks the refrain; see also nearby VIII.88.) The patronymic of our poet (Naudhasa) identifies him as a descendant of Nodhas, and he seems to have inherited some of his ancestor’s skill: the tone of the hymn is light and slangy, and he addresses Indra informally and with mocking exasperation, especially in the second tr̥ca (vss. 4–6), in which the poet complains that Indra has been slow to help his chariot in the race (see also vs. 8).The poet seems to be withholding his highest praise for Indra until Indra has earned it. He begins the hymn by announcing that he hasn’t chosen anyone else for certain as his mercy-giver, and invites Indra to show mercy. He ends the hymn proper (vs. 9) with a promise that Indra will be proclaimed as lord after he “makes his fourth sacrificial name.” What these four names are is not at all certain, but we suggest that the phrase forms a ring with the first verse, where the title/name “mercy-giver” hasn’t yet been bestowed on the god. The poet is thus urging Indra to perform the actions that will earn him the names that will attract sacrifice and praise from mortals.In the final verse, in a different meter, the poet names himself and reminds all the gods (and goddesses, an unusual inclusion) that he has performed service for them, demanding appropriate recompense.1.

One verse is somewhat puzzling: the middle verse (5), in which Indra seems to participate in the ritual in priestly roles as well as being the object of wor-ship, but this theme is not pursued.1.

It is simple in diction and entirely focused on the ritual situation and the hope for Indra’s arrival, save for the last verse (9), which alludes briefly to the myth of the stealing of soma from heaven. The last tr̥ca is marked by a refrain.1. Run here from afar and from nearby, Vr̥tra-smiter,in response to the proffering of the honey.2. Sharp are the soma-drinks. Come here! The pressed drinks are ready to exhilarate.Drink heartily as you are accustomed.3.

The poet praises the help of these gods in the first tr̥ca (vss. 1–3) and asks for valuables in the second (vss. 4–6). The final tr̥ca turns to other gods (see esp. vs. 7) and to a more interesting topic: the ultimate kinship of gods and men (vss. 7–8). The gods are reminded of this relationship presumably to stimulate them to give help and goods.1. We would choose the great help of the gods,of the bulls, to aid us.2.

The most salient aspect of the hymn is the series of ques-tions it contains: in the second tr̥ca (vss. 4–6) the poet asks what services we should perform for Agni and how we should perform them (vss. 4–5); the final tr̥ca (vss. 7–10) again begins with a question (vs. 7), this time about which poet is the recipient of Agni’s poetic stimulation. The poet is clearly concerned with producing the proper praise for the god; he mentions hymns or praises in verses 3–7.The Anukramaṇī names as the poet the legendary and mythic figure Uśanā Kāvya, to whom the three hymns IX.87–89 are also attributed. It is not clear why, save for the mention of the kaví “sage poet” in verse 2.1. The dearest guest will I praise for you—dear like an ally—Agni, worth acquiring like a chariot,2.

The poet identifies himself twice (vss. 3–4).1. Come to my call, o Nāsatyas, o Aśvins,to drink of the honeyed soma.2. Hear this praise song of mine, Aśvins, this call of mine,to drink of the honeyed soma.3. This Kr̥ṣṇa is calling you, o Aśvins whose goods are prizewinning mares,to drink of the honeyed soma.4.

The two named men, Viśvaka and Viṣṇāpū, are found together three times else-where, always in Aśvin context. In nearly identical Kakṣīvant passages (I.116.23, 117.7) the Aśvins “gave” (dadathuḥ) Viṣṇāpū to Kr̥ṣṇiya Viśvaka (Viṣṇāpū com-pared to “a lost herd-animal” in 116.23); in X.65.12 they “let loose” (a﻿́va sr̥jathuḥ) Viṣṇāpū to Viśvaka. The first verb occurs twice in our hymn (2b, 3b), though not with a personal object; the other verb has a close synonym (mumo﻿́catam “release”) in the refrain of all five verses. Thus, our hymn seems roughly to conform to the other R̥gvedic occurrences of these personae. Unfortunately this is all we know of the story: neither of the named men occurs in later texts, and though Geldner provides a contextualizing narrative, himself relying on Sāyaṇa, with Viśvaka the “grieved and deserted” (betrübte und verlassene) father who catches sight of his son, a poet who had gone far away to seek his fortune, there is no real evidence for this plot in the R̥gvedic passages—not even for the father–son relationship. Like many of the Aśvin myths it is intriguing and probably ultimately unknowable.The Viśvaka/Viṣṇāpū episode seems only to occupy the first three verses, which may form a tr̥ca, as Oldenberg suggests (Noten ad loc.). The last two verses (4–5) retain the final-pāda refrain (of vss. 1–3), but omit the repeated c-pāda with its mention of Viśvaka. The appeal to Indra for help (vs. 4) and the praise of truth (vs. 5) seem loosely attached to the rest of the hymn.1.

Detaching the last verses would restore an acceptable order, with a five-verse hymn (86), followed by four- and two-verse hymns.1.

This refrain is not found in this hymn, though the most striking word in the refrain, makṣū́ “soon, right away,” does appear in verse 2. And in verse 4 the Gotamas are identified as creators of the chant being presented to Indra in phraseology very close to that used in the Nodhas Gautama hymns in Maṇḍala I (esp. I.61.16, but also I.60.5, I.63.9, I.62.13).The hymn contains the usual mixture of praise for Indra’s overwhelming might and pleas for his largesse. The poet uses Indra’s unconstrained powers as an argu-ment for his exercising generosity (see esp. vss. 3, 6). It is a well-crafted and pleasing piece; however, whether it is a part of the oeuvre of the Nodhas of Maṇḍala I is difficult to determine on stylistic grounds.1.

(Note that the names of the other two meters in the hymn, br̥hatī and satobr̥hatī, contain a form of this word as well.) The theme of the hymn is the Vr̥tra battle and the singing of the Maruts that strengthens and inspires Indra for the battle. The middle verse (4) is quite possibly the Maruts’ direct address to Indra, the sacred formulation (bráhman—note the phonological similarity to br̥hánt) mentioned in the previous verse (3).The hymn begins and ends with an exhortation to produce a song or hymn for Indra. In verse 1 it is explicitly the Maruts who are thus urged (so also vs. 3), but in the last half of verse 7 the addressees are not identified (though they must be plural, unlike the singular “you” of 7ab). This lack of referent allows the verse to be interpreted in two ways—as a further address to the Maruts or as an address to the human poets—and this in turn allows the Maruts and the poets to be identified with each other and allows the current ritual to acquire the resonance of a divine correspondent. The ritual context is clear from the beginning: in verse 1 the gen-eration of the light suggests the dawn sacrifice; in 6ab the creation of the sacrifice and its elements are Indra’s recompense for his cosmogonic deeds; and in 7cd the mention of the heated gharma pot evokes a particular ritual, the Pravargya, which involves heating milk to boiling—milk that may be indirectly alluded to in 7a.The hymn is also notable for what it lacks: any request for aid or riches. It is that very rare thing in the R̥gveda, a pure hymn of praise. It is also nicely crafted, with balanced rhetorical responsions and variations and phonological and morphologi-cal play throughout, in deceptively direct and simple language.1. For Indra, o Maruts, sing the lofty (sāman) that best smites Vr̥tra,with which those who are strong through truth [=Maruts or gods] gave birth to the light, god(like) and wakeful, for the god.2. The smiter of malediction blew away the interdictions. Then brilliant Indra was at hand.The gods yielded themselves to partnership with you, Indra—you of lofty radiance, with the Maruts as your flock.3. To lofty Indra, o Maruts, chant your sacred formulation.He will smite Vr̥tra—the Vr̥tra-smiter of a hundred resolves—with his mace of a hundred joints.4.

There is nothing particularly remarkable in this hymn except for verse 5, where there appears to be an obscure reference to Varuṇa as the “sustainer of domains,” who concedes various unopposable obstacles to Indra. This epithet, carṣaṇī-dhŕ̥t, is actually more often used of Indra than of other gods, but Varuṇa is also so called (IV.1.2, twice), and a telling passage, VII.85.3, describes an amicable division of labor between Indra, who smashes unopposable obstacles, and Varuṇa, who sustains the peoples, in almost identical phraseology to our verse 5. What then does “concede” mean in our passage? Most likely, in our view, that Varuṇa concedes the sphere of warfare and martial defense to Indra, while con-tinuing to perform his own task of assuring orderly existence in times and places of peace.1. Let Indra, who is to be invoked, tend to all our battles.Let the Vr̥tra-smiter attend upon our sacred formulations and our pressings—he who has the highest overwhelming power, who is equal to song.2.

Unusually the speaker is an unmar-ried girl, who undertakes a clandestine soma ritual for Indra, with erotic over-tones, in ultimate preparation for her marriage. It begins with a contextualizing introduction (vs. 1a–c): a maiden going to fetch water finds soma on her way. She brings it home and addresses first the soma and then Indra. She announces to soma her intention to press it (1de): as it turns out she presses it with her own mouth (2c) and offers it to Indra along with all the accoutrements of a real soma sacrifice (vs. 2). Indra arrives for the soma, and she seeks to understand his intentions, even as she assures him that she will keep his presence a secret (3ab). The lexeme translated “recite” (ádhi √i) is an item of pedagogical vocabulary, appro-priate to her age and stage of life, and refers to students’ oral recitation of their lessons; in this context it seems to mean “reveal your presence verbally.” She then urges the soma to flow softly, in contrast to the excessive noise usually associated with soma’s preparation (3cd). In verse 4 she tremulously speculates to herself about whether Indra will be able to achieve what she wants from her private soma-pressing, and worries, as an adolescent girl apprehensive about sexual-ity and marriage, about sexual intercourse with Indra, a rather formidable first sexual partner, one might think. In the next two verses (5–6) she expresses her wishes—three different types of hair growth: on the fields, that is, plants; on her father’s bald head; and on her “belly,” the last wish indicating a desire for pubic hair as a sign of sexual maturity. Apālā’s words end here; the final verse says nothing directly about whether Indra fulfilled her expressed wishes (though we take it as implying that he did), but simply states that he purified her by pulling"},{"pageNumber":1207,"pageContent":"VIII.921190her through increasingly smaller holes, rendering her “sun-skinned,” quite pos-sibly a reference to the curing of teenage acne, a frequent accompaniment to the entry into sexual maturity.This R̥gvedic hymn is extensively quoted and embedded in a prose narrative in the Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa (I.220–21). For detailed discussion of this hymn and its middle Vedic version, see Jamison (1991: 149–51, 165–67). That account and this translation are deeply indebted to and dependent upon the ground-breaking discus-sion by Hanns-Peter Schmidt in chapter 1 “The Affliction of Apālā (R̥gveda 8.91)” in his 1987 Some Women’s Rites and Rights in the Veda (pp. 1–29).1. A maiden going down to the water found soma along the way.Bringing it home she said, “I will press you for Indra; I will press you for the able one.2. “You over there, the dear little hero who goes earnestly looking from house to house,drink this (soma), pressed by the jaws—(soma) accompanied by grain, by gruel, by cakes, by hymns.3. “We wish to comprehend you; we will not ‘recite’ you aloud.Softly-like, ever so softly-like, o drop, flow around for Indra.4. “Will he be able? Will he do it? Will he make us better off ?Shall we, though coming as husband-haters, unite with Indra?5. “Indra, make these three surfaces grow forth—the head of my Papa, the field, and this on my belly.6. “That field of ours, this body of mine,and my Papa’s head—make all these hairy.”7.

Although the poet does ask for aid from time to time, the focus is on the sacrifice, the verbal accompaniments, and the soma itself. The poet names himself (or nicknames himself: the name is Śrutakakṣa “having a"},{"pageNumber":1208,"pageContent":"VIII.921191famous armpit” [or a famous crotch]) in verse 25. This nickname appears in the midst of a striking sequence using the adverb áram “fitting(ly)” (vss. 24–27) in a clever shift implicitly equating Indra’s body parts (e.g., “fit for your cheek” vs. 24a) with the gifts the poet hopes to receive (e.g., “fit for a horse” vs. 25a), at least once punningly: verse 35c, where the word dhā́mane can refer both to a body part, the “fundament,” that is, the buttocks, and to Indra’s conferring of gifts.1.

These paired addresses to other deities within an Indra hymn suggest the ritual context of a dawn soma sacrifice (though Dawn herself is not alluded to). Indeed, the soma offered to Indra is the dominant theme of the hymn, which becomes more insistent as the hymn progresses. Not surprisingly, mention of the aid and material wealth he will give in return for the soma is also not scanted.Throughout the hymn Indra is especially celebrated as (best) Vr̥tra-smiter: the simple epithet and its superlative form occur an astonishing nine times, even though the myth itself is treated only sparingly (vss. 2, 7, 14–15).As often, the tr̥cas become more tightly organized toward the end of the hymn, with a partial refrain in verses 25–27, and full-pāda refrains in 28–30 and 31–33, the latter being introduced (31a) by the same pāda that provides the refrain (31–33c). There are also intra- and inter-tr̥ca verbal echoes in these later verses. The separate final verse (34) mentioning the R̥bhus seems to have little or no connection to the rest of the hymn.1. Up toward the bull whose bounty is famous, who performs manly work,toward the archer do you go, o Sun.2. He who split the nine and ninety strongholds with his arm-strong (mace),and as Vr̥tra-smiter smote the serpent,3.

Although the Anukramaṇī assigns the whole hymn to the Maruts, it has several features that deviate markedly from the general pattern of Marut hymns. To begin with the clearest, the second tr̥ca (vss. 4–6) names a number of gods as drinkers of the soma being presented: not only the Maruts (vs. 4), but the Aśvins (vs. 4), Indra (vs. 6), and the Ādityas, both as a body (vs. 4) and separately (vs. 5). By contrast, in the remaining tr̥cas (vss. 7–9, 10–12) only the Maruts are mentioned, but they are several times qualified by epithets and actions that are ordinarily the province of other gods: for example, “having refined skill” (vss. 7 and 10), generally used of one or more of the Ādityas; “mountain-dwell-ing” (vs. 12), usually of Soma. Since the lexicon of Marut hymns is often tightly limited, this borrowing of attributes is somewhat remarkable. Similarly the cos-mogonic acts of spreading out the cosmic realms (vs. 9) and propping apart the two world-halves (vs. 11) are Indra’s signature deeds, not otherwise attributed to the Maruts.It is the first tr̥ca (vss. 1–3) that is the most problematic, however. It ends (vs. 3c) exactly as the third tr̥ca ends (9c), and with a variant of the formula found in all three verses of the final tr̥ca (vss. 10–12), in all cases inviting “the Maruts to drink the soma.” But the hymn begins with a paradox (vs. 1), a cow who herself sucks rather than giving suck, a cow identified as the mother of the Maruts and also, in a sharply different animal metaphor, as the draft-horse of their chariots. In the second verse this female figure seems to transform into, or be identified with, Aditi: “the lap of Aditi” is a common phrase. It is this idiom that gives some clue as to the intent of the first two verses. “The lap of Aditi” seems elsewhere to refer to the ritual ground, or some part of it or some vessel associated with it, and soma is prepared or deposited in this lap. The statement that “the gods cause their commandments to be upheld” in this lap is a way of saying that the ritual activities of mortals sacrificing to the gods keep the cosmos functioning, so that, for example, the sun and the moon can be seen. As for the first verse, Pr̥śni, the mother of the Maruts, is in a few mysterious passages (notably IV.5.7, 10) also apparently identified with some part of the ritual ground or equipment, and so Aditi (in “the lap of Aditi”) and Pr̥śni can be superimposed on each other. If “the cow” of verse 1 is the ritual ground (or some part thereof or piece thereon) as Pr̥śni, she “sucks” by receiving the oblation, and she is the draft-horse of the Maruts’ chariots in providing the occasion for their journey.The identification of the Maruts’ mother with Aditi in the first tr̥ca and the ascription to them of epithets and activities characteristic of other gods in the rest"},{"pageNumber":1214,"pageContent":"VIII.941197of the hymn presumably stem from the same motive: to universalize the Maruts and make them a species of All Gods.1.

The most notable feature of the hymn is the last tr̥ca (vss. 7–9), with its inescapable repetition of the word śuddhá “cleansed, washed,” applied not merely to the soma but also to its ver-bal accompaniments, as well as to Indra and the help he will bring. This verb is not a standard part of soma vocabulary: it is used only once in Maṇḍala IX (IX.78.1), where it refers to the washing of the soma plant before its pressing. The verb is in general rare: almost all of its R̥gvedic attestations are found in the last three verses of this hymn. In the few other occurrences where the nature of the action can be determined, water is the agent, and it is clear that washing is the literal meaning of the verb and the metaphor deployed in this hymn.1.

Its parts conform well to the tr̥ca structure, especially (as often) toward the end. Each of the last four tr̥cas (vss. 10–21) has a verbal signa-ture: in verses 10–12 the half-pāda refrain “surely he will take cognizance” (kuvíd aṅga﻿́ ve﻿́dat); in verses 13–15 the “droplet” (drapsa﻿́); in verses 16–18 the opening “you then” (tuva﻿́ṃ ha tya﻿́d); in verses 19–21 the definitional “Vr̥tra-smiter” (vr̥trahā́).The first tr̥ca of the hymn (vss. 1–3) sets the stage for the wide-ranging praise of Indra by describing his overwhelming power in three different areas. In verse 1 the powers of nature are subject to him. Verse 2 apparently contains a snatch of the Emuṣa myth, most extensively related in VIII.71. In that myth Indra shoots a boar named Emuṣa through many mountains; here only the mountains and the arrow-shot are mentioned, but the prodigious nature of the unnamed archer’s action is clear, and the audience would be aware that this was a boyhood deed of Indra’s. In verse 3 Indra’s body is described as the site of his powers, both physical and mental.The second tr̥ca (vss. 4–6) begins with a summary of his preeminence (vs. 4), but soon moves to the Vr̥tra battle (vs. 5) and especially to the Maruts’ role in it, a topic that will also occupy the third tr̥ca. The Maruts appear to be the “formula-tors” (brahmáns) introduced at the end of verse 5, bellowing to Indra. Verses 6–9 are best interpreted as the direct speech of the Maruts to Indra, offering him their praise while seeking an alliance with him. They remind him (vs. 7) that they stuck and continue to stick by him when the other gods deserted him in the Vr̥tra battle, and they put in their claim to share the sacrifice with him (vs. 8), a claim also vividly dramatized in the dialogue hymn I.165. They end their speech (vs. 9) with the reas-surance that together they, the Maruts and Indra, will make an unbeatable team.The next tr̥ca (vss. 10–12) returns to the ritual present, with the poet’s exhorta-tion to himself to produce well-crafted words for Indra—whose attention to the praises he nervously hopes for. The following tr̥ca (vss. 13–15) is the most puz-zling part of the hymn; it concerns an otherwise unknown story about a “droplet” (drapsá) or perhaps an individual (human? divine? semi-divine?) so named. There is a conflict of some sort in the Aṃśumatī River, which Indra appears to win in verse 15.

But the “story” may also be an extended ritual metaphor. “Droplet” is a word also used of soma, and the name of the river means literally “possessing (soma) plants.” The descent of the droplet into the river could well describe the rinsing of the soma plant that forms a regular part of soma preparation, although the ritual counterpart of the mythic conflict is difficult to identify.Unified by its opening words “you then,” the next tr̥ca (vss. 16–18) provides a survey of some of Indra’s great deeds, some obscure (like the rivalry with the unidentified seven in vs. 16), some familiar: the defeat of Śuṣṇa (17c), the release of the cows from Vala (17d), and the Vr̥tra battle again (18). The last tr̥ca begins with a riddle, though not a very challenging one. The first three pādas of verse 19 give a series of definitional descriptors of a hero. Those asked the riddle give their answer to “the other,” in our opinion the riddler himself: “That’s the Vr̥tra-smiter!” And they provide other embellishments to the Vr̥tra-smiter in the following two verses (20–21), while declaring the need to invoke and praise him. The hymn thus keeps returning to the Vr̥tra battle, and the final three verses implicitly assert that Vr̥tra-smiter is Indra’s fundamental role.1. For him do the dawns pass along their course; for Indra do the eloquent evenings (pass along their course) by night.For him do the waters, the seven mothers, stand still—the rivers easy to cross, for men to traverse.2. They were pierced through by the archer, though he wavered—the thrice seven backs of the mountains fitted firmly together.No god nor mortal could surpass this—(the deeds) that the bull, grown strong, performed.3. The metal mace is an appendage of Indra; greatest power is in the two arms of Indra.The intentions of Indra are in his head exclusively; into his mouth they rush en masse, to (become speech) worthy to be heard.4. I consider you the most worthy of the sacrifice of those worthy of the sacrifice; I consider you the stirrer of the unstirrable;I consider you the beacon of warriors, Indra; I consider you the bull of the settled domains.5. When, o Indra, in your two arms you took the mace stirred by exhilaration, to smite the serpent,the mountains bellowed forth, and forth the cows, forth the formulators [=Maruts] approaching Indra.6.

I dispatch you, bulls. Fight in the contest.”15. Then the Droplet held his body in the lap of the Aṃśumatī, as he glittered.With Br̥haspati as yokemate, Indra overcame the godless clans as they attacked.16.

In the first tr̥ca (vss. 1–3) the poet asks Indra to take possession of wealth belonging to other human lords, who do not follow proper ritual behavior, and to redistribute it to the ritualists of the poet’s own group. The next tr̥ca (vss. 4–6), as often, calls on Indra to come to the sacrifice from wherever he happens to be. The hope for Indra’s exclusive company and the fear that he might not come at all are balanced in the third tr̥ca (vss. 7–9). This tr̥ca has an unusual structure, with the first and last pādas of each verse identical, a type of very tight ring-composition.Only in the following tr̥ca (vss. 10–12) does the poet turn to formal praise of the god (though vs. 9 serves as a transition), but these verses function almost as much as a praise of the praisers themselves. In verse 11 the mockingly designated “raspers” (rebha﻿́), that is, the singers, especially the poet himself, whom the Anukramaṇī iden-tifies as Rebha, make Indra strong through their praise. More strikingly, in verse 12 the poets “bend the felly” of his chariot just by looking at it, and make Indra"},{"pageNumber":1220,"pageContent":"VIII.971203himself bow by their words; the point is surely that they thereby make Indra change the course of his journey and come to the sacrifice. In verse 10 an unidentified group both fashions and begets Indra; given the agents of the following verses, it is very tempting to assume that Rebha intends us to understand that it is the poets who fashioned and begot Indra (although the gods themselves, mentioned at the end of the previous verse, could also be the subject). In the last tr̥ca the poet com-bines praise of Indra’s immense power with pleas for him to use it for our benefit.1.

It is arranged in tr̥cas, but not all the tr̥cas show unity of form or content. The second tr̥ca (vss. 4–6) has a four-syllable refrain, and each verse of the last (vss. 10–12) begins with a form of “you” and contains the vocative “you of a hundred resolves,” though not always in the same position. Otherwise there are no clear formal marks.The hymn begins (vs. 1) with an exhortation to the ritualists to sing to Indra, and the second tr̥ca begins (vs. 4) with a complementary request to Indra to come to the sacrifice, but most of the rest of the first six verses is devoted to generalized praise of Indra. In the third tr̥ca (vss. 7–9) the ritualists mobilize their verbal resources to strengthen Indra and bring him to the sacrifice, and in the last tr̥ca (vss. 10–12), as usual, the poet then states our requests, here for battle strength and fighting heroes rather than wealth."},{"pageNumber":1222,"pageContent":"VIII.9912051.

The poet expresses his hope for goods somewhat indirectly, in a curious simile about"},{"pageNumber":1223,"pageContent":"VIII.991206getting cooked in the sun (vs. 3) and in the complex negative constructions of verse 4. The references to the same time yesterday (vs. 1) and to the apparent rebirth, that is, the regular rising, of the sun (vs. 3) suggest that the setting is the dawn ritual, when priestly gifts are distributed.The second half of the hymn (vss. 4–8) is the praise hymn proper, with emphasis on Indra’s irresistible might in battle. The changes rung on the root tr̥̄ “overcome” as well as the balanced oppositions (of the type “who X-es but is not X-ed”) and parallelisms (e.g., the recurrence of -tar- agent nouns) give this portion of the hymn a high rhetorical polish.1.

Needless to say, it has been much discussed and disagreed upon, and our own interpretation of it is not entirely secure.The first two verses are a brief dialogue between an unidentified speaker and his addressee, Indra. The first speaker demands that Indra obtain a portion of the sac-rifice for him before he will assist Indra in his deeds (vs. 1). In verse 2 Indra promises him the soma and proposes an active partnership. The first speaker has been vari-ously identified, but we are in agreement with Oldenberg (Noten ad loc.), inter alia, that it is Vāyu, the god who along with Indra receives the first soma-offering at the soma sacrifice. (The word ágre “at the beginning” in vs. 2 gives strong support to this view.)Thus we seem to have embarked, in mythical time, on the ritual day of real time. Such blending of mythical and current ritual time is not uncommon. And, in our view, what happens next, in the next snatch of dialogue (vss. 3–6), is the emergence of the real-time ritualist. A singer (who may, or may not, be named Śarabha [vs. 6]), addresses his colleagues (vs. 3), urging them to praise Indra, even as he raises doubts about Indra’s existence—doubts that Indra counters directly (vs. 4) by his epiphany and self-praise. The scene has shifted from the mythical dialogue between Indra and Vāyu to the ritual dialogue between Indra and the singer.Indra continues to speak in verse 5, though the contents of the speech are rather unclear. In our view the verse concerns the relationship between Indra and the Maruts, often called Indra’s “companions” (sákhāyaḥ) as here, and the verse is here both because of the progress of the ritual day and because of an association of ideas with verses 1–2. The second or Midday Pressing of the soma sacrifice is dedicated to Indra and the Maruts, but the Maruts’ share of the pressing was only established mythically when they reminded Indra of their help to him in the Vr̥tra battle and demanded from him a share in the soma—a scene effectively dramatized in the famous hymn I.165. Thus, we have moved from the Morning Pressing with Indra and Vāyu to the Midday Pressing with Indra and the Maruts, and the covert thematic connection is that both Vāyu and the Maruts demanded a share of the sacrifice from Indra. What makes the mental association even more complex is the fact that in verse 5 Indra remains in dialogue with the singer, while remembering and recounting to the singer his side of a dialogue with the Maruts. In any case the singer is now convinced of Indra’s reality and declares that Indra’s deeds are to be praised."},{"pageNumber":1225,"pageContent":"VIII.1001208The following three verses (7–9) in dimeter meter (as opposed to the trimeter meter of the rest of the hymn) are in our opinion the contents of the singer’s praise hymn to Indra, highlighting the Vr̥tra battle (vss. 7 and 9) and the fal-con’s theft of soma for Indra (vs. 8). But, not surprisingly, the narration is far from straightforward. Most strikingly, in verse 7 there is a further layer of ven-triloquism: in this verse the singer imitates the speech of yet another speaker, a witness or participant in the Vr̥tra battle, urging the waters, freed by Indra’s slaying of Vr̥tra, to flow forth. The speaker whom the singer is quoting might be Indra, speaking of himself in the 3rd person or perhaps the Maruts. But in either case we the audience are three levels down: we are listening to the hymn’s poet (supposedly Nema Bhārgava) imitating an unnamed singer in dialogue with Indra, and the singer is in turn imitating Indra or some other eyewitness of the mythical scene. The following verse (8) returns to straight narration, of the falcon’s flight with the soma. In verse 9 we are back to the Vr̥tra battle, but notably the description is in the present tense, as if still from the point of view of an eyewitness, and it depicts a curious, indeed unprecedented episode, Indra’s mace lying covered with water—a scene that reminds us of the dead Vr̥tra, who is famously described as lying defeated with the waters streaming over him in I.32.8, 10.As complex and uncertain as our reading of these first nine verses is, the fol-lowing two verses (10–11) are considerably more mystifying. It is not that the language or the content is difficult in itself; the verses concern the goddess Speech (Vāc) and present the common image of Speech as a milk-cow (vss. 10–11) and the common theme of the four divisions of speech (vs. 10). The perplexing part is why Vāc should make her appearance at this point in the hymn. The best answer to this question was given by Oldenberg well over a century ago (1885): he cited a story in later Vedic prose (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa IV.1.3) relating a dispute between Indra and Vāyu after the Vr̥tra battle. Vāyu, as the swiftest god, was sent to make certain that Vr̥tra was dead, and he was rewarded with the first offering. Indra wanted a share of it (thus the opposite of the issue in our first two verses) and promised Vāyu in return that speech would be intelligible. The two gods then wrangled over their proper shares, and Indra received only a quarter, not the half he was expecting. Therefore he decreed that only a quarter of speech would be intelligible. The details of the story match in many ways those in the two verses in question, and it may well be that with these verses we return to the beginning of our hymn and the bargaining between Vāyu and Indra, in a sort of thematic ring composition. However, the Brāhmaṇa story is narratively confused and, as just noted, assigns the roles of petitioner and share-giver exactly opposite. It could therefore also be an after-the-fact attempt to rationalize the peculiari-ties of this part of the R̥gvedic hymn. We reserve judgment, and also point out that the cow in association with speech is celebrated at the end of the next hymn (VIII.101.15–16)."},{"pageNumber":1226,"pageContent":"VIII.1001209And then there is the final verse, addressed to Viṣṇu and echoing the first two verses verbally: the initial vocative “comrade” matches Indra’s offer of comradeship to Vāyu in verse 2c, and the promise “we two will smite Vr̥tra [/the obstacle]” matches the almost identical phrase in 2d “we two will keep smashing obstacles.” The close similarity of these verses led Geldner to assume that Viṣṇu is the speaker in verse 1, not Vāyu. In our opinion this assumption is unnecessary. We think rather that the final verse is an attempt to identify Viṣṇu with Vāyu, or to transform the older god Vāyu (who has a good Indo-Iranian pedigree) into the emergent and increasingly important god Viṣṇu, whose roots are not so deep.Like many late R̥gvedic hymns, the difficulties here lie not in the language or the imagery, as is the case in earlier hymns. A major question in this hymn is what ties all the parts together. If we are correct that the first nine verses mark the progress from the morning to the midday rituals, via the gods (Vāyu, Maruts) associated with Indra at those occasions and their negotiations with Indra about their sacrificial share, and if Oldenberg is correct that the verses concerning Speech (vss. 10–11) conceal the story about the dispute between Indra and Vāyu after the Vr̥tra slaying, then we confront two different and superficially contradictory possibilities of hymnic unity. On the one hand, it may be a ritual unity—the progress of the ritual day—but then the Speech part awkwardly returns us to the beginning of the day. Or it may be a mythological unity, with the Vr̥tra battle viewed from different angles by different partici-pants—but this leaves the ritual real time, with the prominent role of the singer, out of consideration. It is possible, but extremely speculative, that the final Viṣṇu verse gives us a way to reconcile these two approaches. As we have noted frequently elsewhere, the Third Pressing of the soma sacrifice was most likely a ritual innovation, slowly adopted by various clans at different times through the R̥gvedic period and after. Viṣṇu’s most famous deed, the most prominent theme associated with him in the R̥gveda, is the cosmogonic taking of “three strides,” which define and measure out the three worlds. It is possible that because of his association of “three,” the introduction of Viṣṇu at the end of this hymn brings us to the end of the new ritual day, to the Third Pressing, while maintaining the mythic focus on the Vr̥tra slaying.We do not claim to have solved the manifold difficulties of this hymn, but we hope that readers can still enjoy and respond to the intense directness of the dia-logues and the stimulating if destabilizing rapidity of the transitions from one vignette to another.1.

(See Oldenberg 1888: 218 n. 1.) The divisions we see are somewhat at variance with the Anukramaṇī’s analysis. The first six verses appear to belong together, with two pragāthas (vss. 1–4) to Mitra and Varuṇa and a third (vss. 5–6) expanding to include the Ādityas in general, the three best known (Mitra, Varuṇa, and Aryaman) named and the rest subsumed under the title “kings.” The focus is on the gods’ journey to the sacrifice and the praise presented to them there, save for the second pragātha (vss. 3–4), which gives a notable description of Mitra and Varuṇa’s missile and the threat it poses.There follow a pragātha to the Aśvins (vss. 7–8) and one to Vāyu (vss. 9–10), focused even more strongly on their journeys to the sacrifice. The following pragātha to the Sun (vss. 11–12) contains some of the most flat-footed verses in the R̥gveda; it is hard to tell whether the poet’s inspiration gave out, or if there is some deeper purpose that escapes the modern reader.In our opinion the praise of divinities stops here, and the remainder of the hymn (vss. 13–16) depicts the ritual moment. In verse 13 an oblation of butter or some other milk product is poured into the fire by the priests; verse 14 (the most difficult verse in the hymn) appears to concern the offering of soma. The final two verses (15–16) exalt the cow, who appeared briefly in verse 13, in the most extravagant terms, as kin to major groups of gods, source of immortality, and a goddess asso-ciated with speech. This association (vs. 16) reminds us of the somewhat intrusive presence of the goddess Speech as a milk-cow at the end of the immediately preced-ing hymn (VIII.100.10–11).1.

In general there is little internal unity in the tr̥cas, and indeed the third tr̥ca (vss. 7–9) is particularly disjointed, making a false start with two unconnected sentence fragments (vs. 7), followed by a purpose clause with no main clause (vs. 8). However, the second tr̥ca (vss. 4–6) has a refrain, and a curi-ous one at that: “Agni, whose garment is the sea.” This description probably references several different Agni themes: his identification and ultimate merging with Apām Napāt “Child of the Waters” (see esp. II.35); the myth about Agni’s flight from his ritual duties, in which he hides in the waters; and the sprinkling of the fire with consecrated water in the Agnihotra, a ritual action also referred to in verse 14, where the associated act of laying ritual grass around the fire is also mentioned. Verse 14 may also recall Agni’s flight and his concealment in the waters.The conventional hymn appears to end with the sixth tr̥ca (vss. 16–18), solemnly treating the generation and installation of Agni as the conveyor of both the gods and the oblations. The next tr̥ca (vss. 19–21) has a light and self-deprecating tone. The poet claims to have neither of the barebones requisites for even a simple offer-ing to Agni, a cow for the oblation and wood to feed his flames (vs. 19). All he has is “something like this”—namely the hymn he has just produced. This is clearly false modesty, and indeed the poet treats the standard wood and ghee rather slight-ingly in the next two verses (20–21). In the final appended verse (22, not part of a tr̥ca), he proudly pronounces that a man should kindle Agni with his mind and his vision (not, the implication is, with mere wood and ghee), and indeed that he has just done so."},{"pageNumber":1231,"pageContent":"VIII.10212141.

Proferes (2007: 38–40) argues that the opening tr̥ca concerns the forg-ing of a unified power from multiple clans by commitment to their mutually wor-shiped fire, which is identified as belonging to Divodāsa, the great Bharata leader (vs. 2). The territorial expansion and the overcoming of other populations therein are treated in verses 2–3.Though the pragātha that follows (vss. 4–5) does not explicitly continue the theme of victory through centralized leadership, it does promise rewards to the man who devotes himself to Agni—particularly the renowned “imperishable fame” (a﻿́kṣiti śra﻿́vaḥ, vs. 5), a phrase whose Indo-European antiquity has been known and discussed for a century and a half. And “heroic glory” (vīra﻿́vad ya﻿́śaḥ, vs. 9), as well as goods and protection, are the rewards for service to Agni in the following pragāthas (vss. 6–11). The final pragātha (vss. 12–13) seeks to avert Agni’s anger. In the summary verse (14) the poet names himself and invites Agni to the sacrifice.1.

It consists of 114 hymns dedicated to Soma Pavamāna, “self-purifying Soma.” It treats the deified ritual substance, the exhilarating drink soma, whose preparation and offering are the focus of the most important Vedic ritual, the soma sacrifice, but it treats that substance at only a single episode in the whole elaborate sacrifice, the time when the soma juice, which has already been pressed, is poured across the sheep’s fleece that serves to “purify” it—that is, to remove the vegetable detritus still present in the liquid—before it is first diluted with water, then mixed with milk, and poured into the offering vessels. (For more detailed treatment of the ritual procedures involved see, e.g., Geldner’s introduction to this maṇḍala and Oberlies 1999.)There are no other hymns to Soma Pavamāna in the R̥gveda and only a few to Soma in his other aspects (I.91, VIII.48, VIII.79, X.25, as well as a few dedi-cated to Soma and another god [e.g., Soma and Rudra I.43, Agni and Soma I.93]). Judging from this absence, as well as from the data provided by the poets named by the Anukramaṇī, it is clear that many of the hymns in the maṇḍala were extracted from the original bardic collections and assembled in this liturgi-cally oriented collection, while other hymns in the maṇḍala were composed by younger poets. The beginnings of the construction of a pan-Ārya sacrificial sys-tem, superseding the separate and competing clan rites—a construction that led to the middle Vedic śrauta ritual system—can be discerned in various composite hymns, especially IX.67.It is little short of remarkable that the R̥gvedic bards could take this ritual snapshot, consisting of what seems like extremely unpromising material, and make it into high poetry not once, but 114 times, and even the most devoted Vedicist approaches this maṇḍala with some trepidation and with fear of the ennui to be induced by endless repetition of a few ritual tropes. What is truly surprising is that the poets for the most part managed to create an extraordinary variety of approaches to this limited theme, and, for readers interested in how the tra-ditional poets of antiquity used all their ingenuity and poetic resources to trick out and ring changes on an invariant topic, the IXth Maṇḍala serves as a sort of laboratory to observe these skills in action. The hymns in the latter part of the "},{"pageNumber":1251,"pageContent":"IX1234maṇḍala in trimeter meter especially display this richness of approach, but even the sixty-seven hymns in the short (24 syllables per verse) gāyatrī meter are very different from each other.One of the ways in which the poets imbue this ritual moment with gravity beyond the simple facts of the procedure is by animatizing all the elements deployed in the procedure and making them actors, rather than inert things acted upon. The soma juice is configured as Soma, king and god, making a royal progress across the filter to his rendezvous with the gods. Or he is a pow-erful charging bull, or a swift racehorse, or a bird in flight. The fleece filter is a ewe; the milk is regularly conceived of as a herd of cows, eager to mate with the bull Soma. These ritual elements are also given cosmic dimensions. Soma is a pillar between heaven and earth; the sheep’s fleece is the whole surface of the earth or of heaven; the waters for dilution are a vast sea into which the waves of soma empty themselves; the milk in its gleaming brightness is the sun or the day-lit sky. Once they have assumed these other poetic identities, the elements of the ritual then participate in still other metaphors and images that stretch those identities further. And the identities shift constantly within even brief hymns. In short, although it may be difficult to love the Soma Maṇḍala, it pro-vides an almost ideal lesson in how to construct traditional poetry. However, in order to appreciate the artistry and the distance between the real subject and its ennobling verbal treatment, it is necessary to keep the physical facts of the ritual always in view; we have emphasized these regularly in the introductions to the individual hymns. For a close study of the imagery, form, and composi-tion of the soma hymns, see Oberlies (1999).The maṇḍala is organized by meter, with the majority of the hymns in the dimeter gāyatrī meter (IX.1–67), followed by smaller collections of trimeter—jagatī (68–86) and triṣṭubh (87–97)—then anuṣṭubh (98–101), uṣṇih (102–106), pragātha structures (107–108), ending with miscellaneous meters (109–114). Within each metrical group the hymns are arranged by length, from longest to shortest. Although the gāyatrī, jagatī, and triṣṭubh collections end with some very long hymns, these “hymns” can easily be deconstructed into smaller hymns containing the correct number of verses. For example, the jagatī group ends with two apparently nonconforming hymns. After a long series of five-verse hymns (IX.75–84) we find IX.85 at twelve verses and IX.86 at forty-eight. But IX.85 can be broken down into three four-verse hymns and IX.86 into sixteen tr̥cas (three-verse groupings). The longest hymn in the R̥gveda is the final hymn of the triṣṭubh group, IX.97 with fifty-eight verses, divisible into tr̥cas (with a final, extra verse).Gāyatrı̄ Hymns: 1–67"},{"pageNumber":1252,"pageContent":"IX.11235IX.1 (713) Soma PavamānaMadhuchandas Vaiśvāmitra10 verses: gāyatrīThe poet to whom the Anukramaṇī ascribes this hymn has the same name as the poet of the first collection of hymns in the R̥gveda: Madhuchandas Vaiśvāmitra is the author named for I.1–11 (and a descendant, Jetar Mādhuchandasa, for I.12). It is possible that in the absence of a known author the Anukramaṇī simply borrowed the name for this first hymn; in fact, the first four hymns of the IXth Maṇḍala are attributed to the first four authors of Maṇḍala I. On the other hand, the Soma Pava māna hymns of the first four poets of Maṇḍala I may have been selected to begin the Soma Maṇḍala in order to provide an ordered framework.The command “purify yourself ” (pávasva) is the first word of the second pāda of this hymn and sets the theme for the entire maṇḍala: “self-purifying” soma. This first verse also introduces the necessary complement to this self-purifying soma, namely the consumer of soma par excellence, Indra. Thus the verse encapsulates in its sim-plicity the endlessly repeated and often monotonous concerns of the maṇḍala. The second verse alludes to the technical details of soma’s preparation, another topic that will preoccupy the hymns to follow. Soma’s powers to benefit men and gods directly are the subject of verses 3–5, while his power to stimulate Indra to do the same, an indirect benefit for both populations, closes the hymn (vs. 10).Verses 6–9 contain more idiosyncratic material, a catalogue of female beings who aid in the preparation of soma. True, both the fingers that perform the press-ing, metaphorically described in verses 7–8, and the cows that provide the milk to mix with soma (vs. 9) are common denizens of soma hymns, but the Daughter of the Sun is not: she otherwise appears in the IXth Maṇḍala only almost at the end, in IX.113.3. It is unclear what her role is here; perhaps she signals the Morning Pressing. Moreover, the “skin pipe” blown by the maidens in verse 8 is somewhat puzzling; on the basis of other passages (I.117.21 and VII.89.2) it appears to be a musical instrument, but how this image is meant to apply to soma (perhaps the stalk?) and how the fingers can also “blow” is not clear.In short, most of this hymn is familiar, not to say clichéd, material in soma hymns, but as usual there are small deviations and striking images that challenge our notion that the soma hymns, particularly those in gāyatrī meter, are an undif-ferentiated mass of repetitive phrases.1. Purify yourself in the sweetest, most exhilarating stream, Soma,when you are pressed for Indra to drink.2. Demon-smasher, common to all domains, he has reached his seat upon the metal-hammered womb,upon his sitting place, by means of the wooden (vessel).3.

So, just as the first hymn of IX is ascribed to the poet of the first hymns of Maṇḍala I, the second hymn of IX is said to have been composed by the poet of the second collection in I.The hymn begins with the signature command “purify yourself ” (pávasva), and the first word of the second pāda belongs to the same root: pavítram, the “means of purifying,” that is, the filter. The first verses in general follow the steps in the preparation of soma after the pressing proper: the filtering of the pressed soma (vs. 1), into a vessel (vs. 2) with water (vss. 3–4), followed by the mixing with milk (vs. 4). This process is summarized in grandiose and cosmic terms in the following two verses (5–6), with the verbal accompaniment, the hymns and prayers, intro-duced in verses 7–8. Verse 9 echoes the earlier part of the hymn, particularly verse 3, and the poet ends (vs. 10) with a description of all of Soma’s winnings, which can be interpreted as a covert request for Soma to provide us with these items.There is nothing particularly noteworthy or out of the ordinary in this hymn, which could be taken as a prototypical Soma hymn.1.

It is thematically unified by its focus on only one step of the preparation, the filter-ing through sheep’s wool that is the self-purification proper. A form of the verb “purify oneself ” appears in seven of the ten verses (and “filter” derived from the same root in an eighth; only vss. 1 and 6 lack such a form). The poet provides vari-ety with a range of images, from the bird of verse 1 to the chariot rider in verse 5, and as is common he conflates, and equates, the ritual and cosmic spheres. So, for example, the filter across which the soma moves is both a tangle of wool (vs. 2) and the vast spaces of heaven and the atmosphere (vs. 7).1.

A third of each verse is occupied by the self-contained refrain (pāda c: a﻿́thā no va﻿́syasas kr̥dhi “then make us better off ”), and many of the verses consist of short imperative clauses. There are local repetitions as well: the initial “win!” (sánā) of verses 1–3, the repeated pāda about resolve and help in verses 5b–6a, and the initial “rush” (abhy àrṣa) of verses 7–8. Only two verses (6, 9) lack an imperative, and the former contains an optative in similar usage.These conscious formal limits of the hymn are obviously its point: content is secondary. One might note, however, that the sun’s light is especially desired (vss. 2, 5, 6)."},{"pageNumber":1256,"pageContent":"IX.512391.

The last statement, that Soma takes to himself hymns, though they are hidden, is not entirely clear, but it may refer to his ability to stimulate poetic inspiration, and to cause poets to create new hymns from deep within themselves.Noteworthy is also the pun in verse 2, where the drop (índu) is urged to flow as “Indra.” The phonological similarity between these two words is often exploited elsewhere, indeed in the immediately preceding hymn (IX.5.9).1. O Soma, as bull purify yourself in a gladdening stream as you seek the gods,as you seek us, in the sheep’s fleece.2.

The two middle verses (4–5) contain the meat of the hymn: Soma is depicted both as a poet (as in the previous hymn, IX.6.8–9) and a successful king and warrior. The rest of the hymn (vss. 1–3, 6–8) depicts the usual journey of the soma around the fleece filter and into the wooden vessel in which he mixes with water. The final two verses of the hymn proper (7–8) name several of the divine recipients of soma; those in verse 7 are especially associated with the Morning Pressing.1. The drops have surged along the path of truth, upon its foundation—the very splendid ones,recognizing its route.2. Forth (goes) the stream, the forefront of the honey; it plunges through the great waters,to be extolled as the oblation among oblations.3.

Some of the puzzles are illuminated by the next hymn, IX.10, which is in some ways a more straightforward twin to this one. This one also appears to be an omphalos hymn, with an inner ring"},{"pageNumber":1261,"pageContent":"IX.91244defined by numerological repetition in verses 4 and 6, around the omphalos verse 5.On the ritual level, the soma is pressed between or in his two granddaughters (vs. 1): most likely the hands of the priest, on the basis of IX.10.2; after his journey (vss. 1–2), accompanied by hymns he is united with the waters (vss. 4–5), who make him their eye. He is called upon to give aid to the ritual and to the hymn (vss. 7–8).This synopsis leaves a number of questions unanswered. Who, for example, are his two mothers in verse 3? Are they the same as his two female kinsmen in verse 1? Since R̥gvedic poets delight in paradoxical kinship relationships, this is certainly possible. If so, they could be both the ritual implement (hands) and Heaven and Earth, and in this latter cosmic manifestation their son Soma, who makes them shine in verse 3, could be identified with the sun—an identification that is supported by the “single eye” of verse 4. Again under a cosmic interpretation the rivers of verse 4 can be not only the waters with which soma mixes in his ritual preparation, but also the heavenly streams (and indeed real rivers).The referents in the middle verses 4–6 are especially floating and uncertain: both the insights and the rivers of verse 4 are feminine in gender. The agent of verse 5 (the omphalos verse) is feminine plural, and so could be either insights or rivers or both, and “the great” is also left unspecified. In verse 6 we encounter “the seven” again, which can either be the seven insights of verse 4 (which we also met in the preceding hymn, IX.8.4) or the rivers, since the canonical number of rivers is seven. This series of puzzles is capped by the final pāda of verse 6, with the impossible word krívi, which seems here to refer to Soma. The goddesses whom he satisfies could, again, be either the rivers or the insights (or perhaps even just goddesses).The final three verses (7–9), with their requests, cause little difficulty, by contrast.Although the mysteries of the hymn remain largely unsolved, we can note a the-matic strain that provides some unity: the issue of light and darkness. The Soma/Sun of verse 3 lights up his mothers; he may also be the Sun in verse 4. In verse 7 we call upon Soma to help us combat darkness and in verse 8 to light up the lights. The last word of the hymn (vs. 9) is “sun” (svàḥ). It seems that in this hymn Soma is both identified with the Sun and seen as a force that can win and keep the light that Vedic people so craved and worried about. This focus on the sun is also found in the next hymn, IX.10.1. The poet of heaven makes the circuit of his own vital powers, when propelled between his two granddaughtersas he is being pressed—he who has a poet’s purpose.2. You, delightful to the praiseworthy dwelling place, to the race without deceit [=gods]—rush ever forward in your most pleasing pursuit (of them).3.

After a verse (4) with no poetic figuration, the second part of the hymn switches to metaphor, and especially to metaphors of and identifications with the sun, as in IX.9. The spreading of the soma juices across the sheep’s fleece is likened to suns and their rays (vs. 5). The “lone one” in verse 7 is probably both the soma crossing the filter and the sun crossing heaven. Soma’s eye is first tied to the sun (vs. 8), and then the sun implicitly becomes his eye (vs. 9). In addition, the “portion” of Vivasvant (“the one shining forth”) and of Dawn in verse 5 probably refers to the radiance of these divinities, obtained by the soma juices, which are then transformed into suns.Other metaphors involve the poets and sacrificers: the doors of poetry (vs. 6), the seven siblings of the priests (vs. 7), who are no doubt the seven inspired thoughts of previous hymns (IX.9.4, 6; IX.8.4). This latter metaphor of kinship then provides our own kinship relationship to Soma himself (vs. 8). One image remains somewhat obscure: in verse 9 the “track of heaven” is said to have been placed in hiding by the Adhvaryus. This must be a specific ritual reference, with the track of heaven being likened to Soma’s own tracks—perhaps when Soma disappears into the fleece when the Adhvaryu priests are first pressing him."},{"pageNumber":1263,"pageContent":"IX.1112461.

Thus, for example, in verse 4 Soma is both “in the navel of heaven” and “in the sheep’s fleece”—both referring to the filter; the “surface of the sea” in verse 6 is either the soma itself collected in the vessel or the water with which it mixes; the “dear tracks of heaven” in verse 8 are the meanderings of soma through the fleece filter (see also IX.10.9). The buffalo-cow in verse 3 is probably the hide on which the pressing apparatus is set. Only in the last verse (9) does the poet make any requests of the god.1. The soma juices have surged, the drops pressed in the seat of truth,most honeyed for Indra.2. The inspired poets have roared—like mother cows to their calf—to Indra, to drink the soma.3.

This is especially clear in his depiction of the manual manipulation of soma: in verse 2 the hands are called “troops of five kinsmen,” in verse 5 the same fingers are “the granddaughters of Vivasvant” (here the prototype sacrificer), and in verse 7 a standard word for “fingers” finally makes its appearance. Similarly he gives two quite similar expressions for the mixing with milk, both using the image of clothing (vss. 3, 5), and in verse 6 there is a glancing reference to Soma’s desire for cows.The episodic structure of the hymn also seems reflected in the shifting tenses of the verbs. In particular, the past tense of verse 3ab seems to follow directly from verse 1, with the presents of verses 2 and 3c in alternation.1.

The beginning (vs. 1) and end (vs. 7) of the hymn record the ritual moment, the purification in the filter. The intermediate verses, especially 4–6, ascribe human and then cosmic powers to the ritual substance.

The focus is instead on the exchange relation between Soma and his praisers: hymns for goods, an exchange that is seen as, literally, fecund.

The impregnated thoughts will give birth not only to inspired poetry, but also to the material goods that this poetry will win, as verses 1 and 6 make clear. The final two verses (6–7) also call for Soma’s help in besting rivals.1. O Soma, what bright good thing, heavenly or earthly, is worthy of hymns,bring that here to us as you are being purified.2.

Although most of the phraseology is standard for soma hymns, the image in verse 5 of Soma entering the songs seems to be a deliberate reversal of passages in which the songs themselves enter a god, and seems also to imitate and vary the numerous passages in which Soma enters Indra.1.

These are running for Indra, these drops, the ardent soma juices,bringing exhilaration and finding the sun,2. Warding off attackers, finding wide space for the presser,by themselves creating vitality for the praiser.3. Moving playfully at will toward one and the same seat,the drops have flowed in various ways into the swell of the river.4. These self-purifying ones have obtained all things of value,when propelled like the team on a chariot.5. O drops, set the tawny tracker [=Soma himself] here in him [=Indra], to instruct (the man)who does not give to us.6.

Their rush is com-pared to cosmic forces in verse 2, and in verses 4–5 they travel through the cosmos itself. But the poet reaches even further conceptually: he equates this cosmic jour-ney with a ritual one. In matched expressions in verses 3 and 5 the juices pervade not only the cosmic spaces (vs. 5) but also our “insights” (vs. 3), that is, the thoughts that produce ritual poetry. And in verse 6 they reach a higher place than the cosmic space, namely the sacrifice itself, symbolized, as often, by the stretched thread.In the final verse (7) this journey theme is abruptly abandoned, and the disjunc-tion between this verse and what precedes is also conveyed by the switch from plural (“soma juices”) to singular (“Soma”), and from 3rd-person reference to 2nd. It also contains an implicit equation of Soma with (the unmentioned) Saramā, Indra’s dog"},{"pageNumber":1273,"pageContent":"IX.231256who reacquired for him the cows stolen by the Paṇis (see esp. X.108)—an equation seemingly unmotivated by what precedes. (The Paṇis are mentioned only one other time in the IXth Maṇḍala [IX.11.2].) Perhaps the cosmic journey of Soma reminded the poet of Saramā’s long trek. The stretched thread of the sacrifice ends the hymn, and brings it back to the ritual scene.1. These swift soma juices have been propelled forward like prizewinning chariots,surges (of them) sent surging—2. These, (surging) wide like the winds, like the rains of Parjanya,(surging) at will like the flickerings of fire.3. These purified soma juices, mixed with curds, attentive to poetic inspiration,have pervaded our insights with inspiration.4. These immortal ones, once groomed, have not flagged in their flowing,as they seek to reach the paths through the airy space.5. These, going forth widely, have pervaded the backs of the two world-halves,and this highest airy space.6. They have reached the highest thread being stretched, along the inclines,and this one that is to be higher still.7. You, Soma, secured from the Paṇis the good things of cattle.You have roared toward the stretched thread.IX.23 (735) Soma PavamānaAsita Kāśyapa or Devala Kāśyapa7 verses: gāyatrīThis hymn begins very like the last one, with the rushing of the soma juices, but goes in a different direction. Verse 2 introduces the Āyus, men both of the past (so vs. 2, also IX.10.6) and of the present, who are regularly credited with the prepara-tion of the soma in the IXth Maṇḍala and by this very poet (IX.10.6, 15.7, 16.8, 19.3). But surprisingly in verse 4 the Āyus are identified with the soma juices, a rhetorical strategy that must result from the fact that in this verse the juices purify themselves into the exhilarating drink; in other words they prepare themselves and therefore behave like the Āyus who prepare the soma.In the last three verses (5–7) Soma’s relationship to Indra becomes the focus: in verse 5 the rushing soma acquires the power of Indra as its essence, and in verses 6 and 7 this power is transferred to Indra, to perform his heroic deeds, both in the past and in the present. Verse 7 thus harkens back to the ancient Āyus and their newer path in verse 2."},{"pageNumber":1274,"pageContent":"IX.2412571.

That soma is Indra’s drink is repeatedly emphasized (vss. 2, 3, 5, and under the qualifier “con-queror of territories,” a word regularly applied to Indra, vs. 4). Soma himself is given the most characteristic of Indra’s epithets—“obstacle-smasher”—in the superlative in verse 6.1. The soma juices have run forth, the self-purifying drops.Brought to readiness, they have been groomed in the waters.2. The cows have run toward them, like waters going along a slope.Becoming purified, they have reached Indra.3.

This connection may account for the mention of the Maruts in verse 1 as recipients of soma, along with Vāyu: the Maruts are quite scarce in the Soma Maṇḍala.The hymn is otherwise unremarkable, though one might note the insistent iden-tification of Soma as a kaví (“poet,” vss. 3, 5, 6).1.

It clusters especially closely with the three hymns that precede it: these four hymns (IX.27–30) are all attributed to poets with the patronymic Āṅgirasa, and all four contain at least one form of śúṣma “tempestuous force” or śuṣmín “tempestu-ous” (IX.27.6; 28.6; 29.6; 30.1, 3), mostly in the final verse.

Parallel constructions and phraseol-ogy (e.g., the fronted “for you” [túbhyam] in vss. 3, 5, the fronted “be/become” [bhávā] of vss. 2, 4) give a sense of unity. Unlike many soma hymns, where the finale delivers the soma to Indra (e.g., the final verses of nearby hymns such as IX.23.6–7, 26.6, 27.6, 30.6), here it is “we” who declare our desire for his pres-ence and partnership (vs. 6).The poet, Gotama Rāhūgaṇa, is also the composer of a soma hymn in the first maṇḍala, I.91, and verse 4 in this hymn is identical to I.91.16, which occurs in a triad of ritually connected verses.1.

There is, however, less emphasis on the physical process of purification, and more on the sounds that accompany it: verse 4 introduces three voices, which may be the three types of ritual speech, the r̥c, yajus, and sāman familiar from later śrauta ritual, or may refer to the priestly formulations (5a), the bellowing of the cows (4b), and the roar of the rush-ing soma itself (4c). The theme continues in verse 5, which also highlights “truth,” found in verse 2 as well.The hymn is bookended by watery references: the simile of the waves of water in verse 1 returns in the final verse (6) as the seas of wealth that soma will produce for us.1. Forth go the soma juices, attentive to poetic inspiration, like waves of the waters,to the wooden (cups) like buffaloes to the woods.2.

What lies between is, for the most part, unremarkable. Verse 2 lists the recipients of the soma, a longer list than usual (and a verse almost identical to vs. 3 in the previous hymn, IX.33), and verses 3–4 concern the preparation of the drink. However, verse 5 is difficult: the Maruts milk for themselves (or yield as their milk) the oblation in the direction of “the upper surface of truth.” Although in the context of the hymn, soma should be the product of milking (see vs. 3), the liquid the Maruts ordinarily milk is rain. Moreover, “the upper surface of truth” is a puzzling phrase, which occurs elsewhere only in the mystical and baffling Vena hymn (X.123.2). Since the latter hymn seems to concern the mystical identification between soma and the sun, it is likely that here too we have double reference, with the ritual substance soma assimilated to the cosmic fecundator, the rain, and “the upper surface of truth” referring both to the soma filter and to heaven (or the res-ervoir of rain in heaven).1.

This theme is abandoned until the final verse (6), when Soma goes seeking horses for the worshipers. The hymn is otherwise a fairly standard soma hymn, though one might note that the connection of soma with light made in the previous hymn (attributed to the same poet), IX.35.1, is also found here in verse 3.

In addition to the mundane details of the preparation, however, the hymn makes cosmic claims for the ritual actions. The sheep’s fleece of verse 3 also stands for “the luminous realms of heaven”; in verse 5 Soma finds a wide realm, usually a symbol of freedom and the acquisition of territory.Verse 4, the pause on the journey, has been much discussed, and its various phrases, “on the back of Trita,” “along with (his) relatives,” also given cosmic ref-erents (though there is no scholarly agreement on just what they are). We are of the opinion, however, that it primarily concerns the ritual preparation: the “back of Trita” is the filter and the “relatives” (jāmí) are, as usual in a soma context, the fingers of the officiant, namely Trita (see “Trita’s maidens,” the fingers, in the next hymn, IX.38.2). It is this ritual preparation that allows the cosmic act of Soma, making the sun shine (at the Morning Pressing), in that same verse (4).1.

In verse 1 Soma makes his journey through the filter to the place on the ritual ground where the gods await their oblation. When he arrives there in verse 6, the priests order him to take his seat. In between, Soma’s journey involves travel in both ritual and cosmic space (see esp. vss. 2, 4).1.

Instead, beginning with verse 3, the focus is on the wealth that Soma will bring us, and the repetition of vocabulary in these four verses induces a sense of claustrophobia, with the same elements recycled: “o Soma,” “o drop,” “purifying,” “bring us,” and “wealth.” Although claustrophobia is to some extent endemic to the IXth Maṇḍala, most hymns make some attempt to vary the lexicon and phraseology.1.

This hymn begins strikingly, with an incomplete sentence describing the stampede of a wild mob, against the “black skin,” presumably the Dasyu referred to in verse 2. The constituents of the mob are not identified, but are presumably the soma juices, here mobilized against the non-Ārya enemy.

This twofold theme continues through the hymn, as, for example, in verse 4 where Soma begets the gods while being poured in the filter.

In the final verse (6) he asks for a proper recompense for the poet (that is, himself) who produces these hymns.1.

In contrast, some qualities of soma known from elsewhere that are rarely or never mentioned in the IXth Maṇḍala make their appearance—in particular his source in the mountains (vs. 1) and in verse 4 the technical distinction between “pure” (that is, unmixed) soma (śukrá) and soma with grain stirred in (manthín, a word otherwise only found once elsewhere in the R̥gveda [III.32.2]). (In the later śrauta ritual, cups of śukra and manthin soma form both a ritual and a grammatical pair, in the dual dvandva compound śukrā-manthinau, here found in discontinuous form.) The gods Vāyu (vs. 2) and Indra (vss. 3, 6), recipients of the first soma oblations at the Morning Pressing, are named. Verse 2 contains a striking image of the soma drops adorned like a girl for marriage.1.

The Soma of this hymn is distinctly militant, using the power he has acquired (vs. 1) to destroy the Dasyus (vs. 2) and win spoils, as Indra’s very mace (vss. 3, 5). But the same Soma is both a poet (vs. 4) and a recipient of poetry (vs. 3), who facilitates the human poet’s acquisition of treasure from his patron (vs. 4).1. Through this good ritual performance Soma has waxed strong even over the great ones.Becoming exhilarated, he up and acts the bull.2. His deeds done and to be done, crushing the Dasyus, are conspicuous,and the bold one exacts recompense for debts.3.

The militant theme of the previous hymn is visible in verse 2, while the story of the falcon’s theft of Soma from heaven, a myth not prominent elsewhere in Maṇḍala IX, is the subject of verses 3–4. Unlike most of the gāyatrī soma hymns, this one contains no explicit reference to the preparation of the soma, with only a glancing mention of the “impelling” of soma in the final verse (5), a term generally used in IX of the push that starts the soma on its purificatory journey through the filter.1.

The first four verses contain imperatives addressed to Soma, the last verse a 3rd-person past tense, suggesting that the wishes expressed have been fulfilled.1.

This hymn has a distinct focus on sound, that of Soma as he is being prepared (vs. 1), of (probably) the officiating priests (vs. 3), and of the ritual chant (vs. 4). A potential pun in verse 2 suggests that the priestly voices there are both competing with each other and seeking the sacrificial reward. Verse 5 contains another potential pun, with the same word (aktú) meaning both “ointments” and “nights.”1. Your snortings rise up like the roar of the wave of a river.Spur on the wheel-rim of the music.2. At your stimulus there rise up three voices ready for combat [/seeking bounty],when you go onto the back of the sheep.3.

The contents of the first two verses are conventional enough—the entry of Soma into the filter—but they contain several instances of phonological and morphological play, as do the final two verses (4–5). These cannot be conveyed in translation.Verse 3, characterized by the repetition of the verb īṅkhaya (“push, shove”) of highly marked formation, has a slangy and disparaging tone. Its object is generally interpreted, in our opinion correctly, as a reference to an ungenerous rich man, perhaps the poet’s patron. He is compared to a pot, no doubt both because he is full of goods and because of his stodgy demeanor, and the soma drop is urged to prod this miser into giving.Two matching compounds, sanád-rayiḥ “gaining wealth” (vs. 1) and maṃhayád-rayiḥ “readying wealth” (vs. 5), provide a thematic and grammatical ring.1.

Although these brief soma hymns have some interesting features, they lack the mind-boggling verbal pyrotechnics of that hymn.On the other hand, the organizing principle of V.44 is the double application of each verse to two different divinities, Agni and Soma, with a lexicon ambiguous enough to allow both interpretations. Something of the same thing is visible in this hymn, in which each verse but the last (4) invites the audience to supply a refer-ent different from the one meant. The first verse deploys clear Indraic vocabulary, particularly the vocative “possessor of the stone,” though Soma can, and should, be its subject. The first two-thirds of the second verse (2ab) suggest either Indra or Soma as referent, until the 1st singular verb form “I will praise” that opens the last pāda establishes the 1st-person speaker as the referent. Again, the third verse opens like a verse to Varuṇa or another Āditya, and only the “self-purifying” that begins the second pāda ties it to Soma. It is only the last verse that contains unmistakable somian vocabulary and which, in its final pāda, clarifies the roles of the drop (índu) and Indra.1. Your blasts have arisen, splitting the demonic power, you possessor of the stone.Push aside the challengers all around2. With this (insightful thought), slamming down with strength when chariots clash and a prize is set,I will praise with fearless heart.3.

However, unlike the last hymn, the poet does not try to mislead the audience into supplying"},{"pageNumber":1295,"pageContent":"IX.551278the “wrong” referent. Rather, the hymn is structured as a series of explicit riddles: a form of the pronoun ayám “this one” opens each of the first three verses (and also 2b), and what is predicated of “this one” fits, or can fit, the Soma paradigm. The explicit solution to the riddle is given in the last pāda of verse 3, with the name Soma prominently situated. And the final verse brings the drop (índu) and Indra together in the same way as IX.53.4.1. In accord with the age-old brilliance of this one, they have milked the gleaming, immoderatemilk from the seer who wins thousands.2.

Verse 1 is notable for its mention of agriculture, though again the relevance is not entirely clear. The martial Soma is on display in verse 4.1. Stream around to us grain upon grain, fruiting upon fruiting with your stalk,o Soma, and all the gifts of good fortune.2.

The fourth verse then requests protection for ourselves and our men, while urging the soma to flow for its divine recipients.1. Swift Soma, as lofty truth, rushes about in the filter,smashing apart the demons, seeking the gods,2.

All four verses have a pāda-length refrain, which is entirely applicable to Soma, and the hymn begins with this same refrain. The first verse is clearly a soma verse throughout, but verse 2 is more appropriate to Dawn and verses 3 and 4 appear to be an abbreviated dānastuti. The patrons named in verse 3 are identified as protegés of the Aśvins in I.112.23 (though with the first in slightly different form); middle Vedic literature also has a confused tradition about these same personages.1.

More salient is the chaining from verse to verse: a significant portion of the final pāda of one verse opens the next verse.The hymn also has extra-hymnic structural echoes: its final pāda is identical to the final pāda of the first verse of the preceding hymn (IX.59.1), ascribed to the same poet, save for “semen” in place of “treasure.”1.

(The only exception is the Āprī hymn, IX.5, which has eleven.) But the gāyatrī sequence ends with six thirty-verse hymns (IX.61–66), followed by one with thirty-two verses (IX.67)—all arranged in tr̥cas (the final two verses in IX.67 are supplements) and each attributed to a different poet or group of poets—before the jagatī group begins. It is probably not an accident that these groupings of tr̥cas come at the end of the gāyatrī sequence, since, as agglomerations of three-verse sequences, they logically follow the four-verse hymns.In this particular hymn there is little evidence of unity either within tr̥cas or between them: the standard topics of soma hymns—the details of preparation (e.g., vss. 4–5) and the gods for whom he’s prepared (e.g., vss. 8–9), the cosmic connections of Soma (e.g., vss. 10, 16, 18), and the largesse and aid we ask him for (e.g., vss. 3, 23–24)—are strung together in no apparent order.

One verse, 17, is more specific than the usual generic treatments: here the soma is a horse yoked to the chariot of the sacrifice, which has three backs and three seats, presumably the three pressings and the three fires, by the visionary thoughts of the seven seers. It is also notable how often Soma is called a poet or connected with poetry in the second part of this hymn (vss. 13, 14, 25, 26, 27, 30). In the final verse he is in fact called “the entruthed poet” or “the poet (who is) truth (itself),” a power-ful expression of his relationship to creative speech.Though some of the tr̥cas display internal formal unity (e.g., vss. 19–21 begin-ning with ā́), most do not. The poet to whom the hymn is attributed names himself in verse 24.1. These drops have surged, swift across the filter,toward all gifts of good fortune.2.

On the one hand, the purification is seen as a process of Ārya-ization (vs. 5), and the spaces that Soma traverses, for example the filter, become “Ārya domains” (vs. 14). The waters that Soma crosses (vss. 5, 21) and the rivers in which he is groomed (vs. 17) are both the ritual waters in which the soma plant is rinsed and rehydrated and, metaphorically, the frontier rivers the Āryas crossed in expanding their realms. (See also the mentions of finding or making “wide space” in the two preceding hymns [IX.61.12; 62.3, 9].)On the other hand, Soma is compared to and identified with the Sun (espe-cially in the third tr̥ca, vss. 7–9, also vs. 13), and his journey across the filter is also metaphorically the Sun’s daily journey across the heaven. Since the ritual activity happens on earth, at the hands of Manu (vss. 7–8), the first sacrificer and the cul-tural ancestor of the Ārya, even the rising of the Sun is thus implicitly attributed to human agency.The hymn is, of course, also full of requests for material goods of all sorts, and, especially toward the end, for Soma to smite all manner of enemies and hostile forces (vss. 24, 26, 28–29; also 5).Although the hymn does not seem tightly structured, some tr̥cas show formal unity (e.g., vss. 25–27 with forms of the root sr̥j “surge”), and the hymn begins and ends with verses containing the imperative dhāraya “secure, sustain.”1. In purifying yourself, o Soma, bring wealth in thousands and an abundance of good heroes;secure our claims to fame for us.2. You swell refreshment and nourishment; most exhilarating for Indra,you sit down here in the cups.3. Pressed for Indra, for Viṣṇu, soma has streamed into the tub.Let it be honeyed for Vāyu.4.

What follows is for the most part a conventional treatment of the purification process, with special emphasis on his entry into “the sea” (that is, the purificatory waters, vss. 8, 16, 17, 19, 27). The association with the Sun found in the preceding hymn is also present here, with Soma not merely yoking the Sun’s horse, Etaśa, but identified with him (vs. 19) and with the Sun himself in the final words of the hymn (vs. 30; see also vss. 7, 9). Soma’s light and brilliance are also mentioned throughout (vss. 1, 8, 13, 15, 28).1.

Indeed, the hymn is in part about space: the con-stricted area in which the soma is prepared and the materials employed in the preparation are likened to various cosmic domains and natural phenomena (see, e.g., vss. 2–3, 5–6, 12–13). Soma himself is explicitly or implicitly identified with other deities and natural forces, and they with him: the sun (vss. 18, 22, 27), probably Indra (vs. 26), and especially Agni (vss. 19–21). This last identification is so complete that the Anukramaṇī identifies Agni as the divinity of this tr̥ca—not surprisingly, as it begins (vs. 19) with an address to Agni, who is assigned the archetypal Soma epithet “self-purifying” (vs. 20, with verbal forms in vss. 19 and 21), while also keeping his own characteristic vocabulary (esp. “installed in front” [puro﻿́hita] vs. 20).The poet also seeks comradeship with Soma (vss. 1, 4, 14, 18), in addition to the usual good things.From an Indo-European perspective, the hymn is notable for containing one of three R̥gvedic occurrences of the famous phrase ákṣiti śrávaḥ “imperishable fame,” cognate with Greek kle﻿́os a﻿́phthiton “idem,” and the formula, identified by Adelbert Kuhn in 1853, that launched the field of comparative Indo-European poetics.1. Purify yourself, you who are common to all the separate peoples, (surging) toward all products of poetic skill,a comrade for your comrades, to be reverently invoked.2.

It has been convincingly argued by Proferes (2007: 10) that this structure shows that the separate lineage rites were already being collected into a single pan-Ārya ritual during the R̥gvedic period and that this com-posite hymn was a conscious attempt to bring the various clans under one ritual umbrella. He argues that the final two verses (31–32) were added by the redactors or compilers and celebrate this ecumenical project, by declaring that the assemblage is greater and more powerful than the sum of its parts.Certainly its parts are quite various. The first twenty-one verses, attributed to the various clan-poets, are for the most part conventional Soma Pavamāna verses, and the tr̥cas for the most part exhibit some internal cohesion. The single unconventional tr̥ca consists of verses 10–12, attributed to Atri, in which the god Pūṣan dominates. Pūṣan otherwise scarcely appears in the IXth Maṇḍala, has little or no connec-tion with soma elsewhere (gruel is his favored meal), and barely appears in the Atri Maṇḍala (V) except in lists of other gods. The reason for his intrusion here is unclear.Verses 22–27 form a self-contained purificatory spell, calling on various gods, including Soma, Agni, and Savitar, in addition to groups of gods, to purify us with their own characteristic instruments. There follow two verses (28–29) that return to the soma theme, and then the strangest verse of all (30). The interpretation of this verse is much disputed, but it appears to refer to the myth of the disappearance of the ritual Agni and urges Soma to bring him back, along with a, or the, rat, which may be a reference to the god Rudra, whose animal victim in later ritual is a rat. But this is only a guess.The last two supplementary verses (31–32) were discussed above.1. You, Soma, are supporting, invigorating, strongest at the ceremony.Purify yourself, readying wealth.2. You, bringing exhilaration to superior men when pressed, most exhilarating when you have run,are patron to Indra, with your stalk.3.

The hymn has an omphalos structure: since verse 10 is a summary verse and in a different meter (triṣṭubh), verse 5 is the middle verse and encodes the esoteric knowledge that is the hymn’s message. This verse is framed by a number of verbal and semantic responsions (though not as tightly arranged as in some omphalos hymns): for instance, the fingers of verses 4 and 7, as well as the same phrase “held by men” in both verses; the forms of the root vid “find, discover” in verses 3 and 6 (and 9).More important is the conceptual architecture: the hymn leads up to the ompha-los and away from it, returning to its conceptual starting point. It begins with the"},{"pageNumber":1316,"pageContent":"IX.681299ritual soma and the familiar details of its preparation (vss. 1–2): the journey across the filter and the mixing with milk, complete with details about the actual filtering process, as the juice leaves its detritus in the filter. But toward the end of verse 2, the journey gains a larger resonance, however vague: soma circles “the wide expanse,” an area that sounds more ample than a mere sheep’s fleece. In verses 3 and 4 the journey has turned cosmic: heaven and earth are now the domain for Soma’s travel and for his fecundating activity, and in our view the contrast between Soma’s swell-ing footprint in 4b and his head in 4d expresses his cosmic reach, from his feet on earth, swelling with rain, to his distant head in heaven.Verse 5, the omphalos, provides an explanation, albeit a mystical one, for the difference between the ritual soma of the first two verses and the cosmic one of verses 3–4. He really had two births, one in secret even beyond the two worlds and one made evident to all. And as a consequence there are actually two Somas, a fact first recognized by Heaven and Earth. (Such is our reading of this verse, which has generally been interpreted quite differently: one influential opinion identifies the Aśvins as the twins mentioned, a solution of desperation in our opinion.)The second form of Soma, the physical and visible one, is brought to earth in verse 6, and the poets and ritualists transform him into the ritual soma now familiar to us. The remaining verses before the summary (7–9) bring us back to the current ritual soma with which we began, but with a clearer awareness of the powers his dual nature has bestowed on him. For example, in verse 1 the drops are simply “pro-vided with speech,” but in verses 8–9 Soma “rouses speech” all the way to heaven. Similarly, in verse 2 he simply “circles around” the wide expanse, whereas in 9d, the last pāda of the hymn proper, he “finds” wide space, a feat much desired and much celebrated by the Vedic Āryas.1. Forth toward the god have the honeyed drops flowed, like milk-cows.Sitting on the ritual grass, provided with speech, with (full) udders, they have assumed as their swirling raiment the ruddy (cows’ milk).2. Bellowing continually he has cried out to the (cows) in front; loosening his shoots, the tawny one becomes sweet.Across the filter, circling around the broad expanse, the god will lay down his stems at will.3. The exhilarating drink, which measured across the converging twin sisters [=Heaven and Earth], swelled those two imperishable ones, grown strong simultaneously, with imperishable milk.Continually rediscovering the two great, unbounded world-halves, advancing upon imperishable (space), he assumed his full dimension.4. Wandering between the two mothers [=Heaven and Earth], stirring up the waters, the wise one swells his own footprint by his independent power.The plant is ornamented with grain when he is held by men; while he joins with his female kin [=fingers], he guards his own head."},{"pageNumber":1317,"pageContent":"IX.6913005.

Sometimes several ref-erents are simultaneously possible, as in verse 1, where both “thought” and “soma” could be the subject of the middle part of the verse. This verbal richness is quite appropriate, since at least the first two verses concern the poetic impulse; note the nice description of the tongue as “the gladdening goad” in 2b.The middle verses (3–7) treat Soma’s journey across the filter to meet and mix with the cows/milk. This mixture is described in increasingly elaborate images of clothing in verses 4–5, ending with the cosmos as his garment (5cd).

The theme of the hymn is the difference between, and ultimate unity of, heavenly Soma and earthly, ritual Soma—a theme that was also the subject of nearby IX.68. The disjunction is announced in the first verse, where the “real” milk-mixture is pro-duced in heaven, and the worlds are Soma’s garment. In verse 2, by contrast, it seems that the earthly Soma is seeking a share of his heavenly counterpart by per-forming cosmic deeds through ritual means. A rapprochement is effected in verse 3, where Soma’s beacons (ke﻿́tu) go to and work upon both men and gods, and as a consequence they accept him as their king; on the basis of other passages in which this term is found, the beacons appear to be both his cosmic sunlike rays and the glinting streams of ritual soma as they circle in the filter. The intermediary role of Soma between gods and men and Heaven and Earth remains the subject of the fol-lowing verses (4–6), though not all is clear, especially the first half of verse 4 and the last half of verse 6. The last four verses (7–10) return us to the ritual Soma and his ultimate goal, the body of Indra, but the cosmic associations he acquired in the earlier parts of the hymn make him nourishment fit for the gods.1. Three times seven milk-cows have milked out for him the real milk-mixture in the foremost distant heaven.He made the four other dear worlds to be his raiment, when he grew strong through the truths [=hymns].2. Seeking a share of the dear immortal one, through his poetic skill he has loosened both, Heaven (and Earth), from each other.He lavishly wraps himself in the glinting-sharp waters when, by the god’s [=Soma’s] fame, they [=waters] know his seat.3. Let those immortal undeceivable beacons of his suffuse both races [=gods and men],the beacons by which both manly and godly (powers) become purified. Just because of that have the zealous ones accepted him as their king.4. He, being groomed by the ten who work well [=fingers], (goes) forth to bellow forth amid the midmost mothers [=waters?].Protecting the commandments of the dear immortal one [=heavenly soma], having his sight on men, he surveys both clans [=gods and men].5.

The journey is pre-sented as a straightforward trajectory on the one hand, with his arrival among the gods and his union with the praise hymn the last step, in verse 8. But the hymn is also structured by a number of responsions between the earlier and the later verses; note especially 2b and 8a, with the almost identical phrases “the color that is his” and “this is his color.” In this particular example the forward movement of the journey and the architectonic structure of responsions comple-ment each other, for in verse 2 Soma sheds his original form and color and in verse 8 he gains new ones.1. The tempestuous one is sent surging, along with the gift-cow, to take his seat here.

The phrase-ology in this pāda is strongly suggestive of erotic slang, but unfortunately the word has so far defeated all attempts to decode it. It is worth noting, however, that it is a partial anagram of the patronymic of the poet Harimanta Āṅgirasa, and he may be punning on his name in this playful, erotic context.1.

The signature phrase is “they have sounded in unison” (sám asvaran, vss. 1, 4, 5, 6); in none of its occurrences is there an overt subject, an omission that is surely deliberate. The verb forms in ques-tion, and indeed most of the hymn, can be interpreted as referring either to the soma streams as they noisily cross the filter or to the priests/poets who provide the hymns that accompany soma’s journey. This double reference is found even in the name of the poet to whom the hymn is attributed: Pavitra (“Filter”): the filter is both the sheep’s wool filter that purifies the soma and the poet who creates the ritual speech; the word pavítra occurs several times in the hymn (vss. 3, 7, 8, 9, and implicitly 4). The “solution” to the central riddle of the hymn, this dual reference, is suggested in the first half of verse 7 and definitely expressed in the final verse (9), where “the thread of truth” ( r̥ta﻿́sya ta﻿́ntuḥ) is stretched both on the filter and on the tongue-tip. The thread may be both the track of the soma across the filter and the continuous line of speech. The second half of the verse emphasizes the importance of united action to attain it, and the necessity of always advancing.Another thematic strain is the deployment of the power of this unified sound against enemies and hostile forces (see esp. vss. 5, 6, 8), a power associated with Varuṇa and his māyā́ (“magic power, artifice,” vss. 5 and 9), with whom Soma is identified, first in verse 3. Varuṇa is of course the protector of commandments (vratá, vss. 3, 5, 8) and is associated with truth/true speech ( r̥tá, vss. 1, 6, 8, 9), words prominent in the hymn. Thus, Soma, as the embodiment of Varuṇa, and the poets who assist him can marshal Varuṇa’s weapon, “true speech,” against forces that deny or attempt to thwart it.Many individual puzzles remain, but the overall structure and purpose of the hymn are clear.1. In the jaw (of the pressing stones) while the droplet was blowing its blast, they sounded in unison.

As noted, verse 4 for the most part is a standard soma verse, but pāda c skates fleetingly and unemphatically over an apparent paradox, with a"},{"pageNumber":1328,"pageContent":"IX.781311male Soma conceiving himself as his own embryo. In the final verse Soma is com-pared to Varuṇa, because of his control over truth and deceit, and to Mitra, in his role as mediator among communities.1. This honeyed one has cried out in the bucket, the mace of Indra, more wondrous than any wonder.The good milkers of truth, dripping with ghee, rush bellowing to him, like milk-cows with their milk.2. The primordial one purifies himself—he whom the falcon, propelled across the airy realm, stole from heaven.Quivering, with a mind fearing Kr̥śānu the archer, it [=falcon] binds on the honey.3. Let these drops, those ahead and those behind, run to a great prize of cows for us—those drops worth looking at, cherished like fertile cows, which take pleasure in every sacred formulation, every oblation.4. This one here, knowing how, will win against those who seek to win—the drop praised by many with fully focused mind,who has conceived the embryo in the seat of the powerful one and rushes to the wide-open pen of cows.5. The active, effective sap of heaven purifies himself as great Varuṇa, not to be deceived by one who goes astray.The one worthy of the sacrifice has been pressed as Mitra in the (ritual) enclosures [/communities], constantly whinnying like a charger acting the bull in the herd.IX.78 (790) Soma PavamānaKavi Bhārg ava5 verses: jagatīA fairly straightforward hymn. The first three verses treat the preparation of the soma: after being swollen with water it is sent forth into the filter, which captures the plant detritus, on its way to the milk mixture (vs. 1); it goes across the filter and into the cup (vs. 2); and it is mixed with waters, here unusually personified as the nymph-like females, the Apsarases (vs. 3). The last two verses list the benefits that will accrue to us when the gods drink the soma.1. The king, begetting speech, has flowed forth; clothing himself in the waters, he seeks to attain to the cows.The sheep grasps his defilement, (the stems) attached to his body. Cleansed, he travels to his rendezvous with the gods."},{"pageNumber":1329,"pageContent":"IX.7913122. For Indra, o Soma, you are poured in circles by the men.

The Apsarases belonging to the sea, sitting within, have streamed toward Soma of inspired thought.They spur him on, the conqueror of the secure house; they beg the imperishable self-purifying one for his grace.4. Winning cows for us, winning chariots and gold, winning the sun and the waters, winning thousands, Soma purifies himself,whom the gods have made their exhilarating draught for drinking, the sweetest ruddy drop, who is joy itself.5. O Soma, purifying yourself, you rush, seeking us, while making these treasures real.Smash the rival nearby and the one who is in the distance; make wide pasturage and fearlessness for us.IX.79 (791) Soma PavamānaKavi Bhārg ava5 verses: jagatīThe combative spirit of this hymn is reminiscent of that in other hymns attributed to Kavi Bhārgava, especially IX.47 and IX.76. The hymn is especially interesting because of the light it throws on social divisions in the R̥gvedic period. The word arí (vss. 1, 3), here translated “stranger” following Thieme (1938), is a much-discussed and much-contested one, underlying as it does derivatives such as ā́rya “Ārya.” We are of the opinion that an arí is a member of the larger Ārya society, but not of one’s immediate community. He is thus a stranger, but one with whom one in principle shares social values and to whom one owes certain reciprocal duties, such as hospitality. But as a stranger he may also pose a threat to the smaller community one belongs to, if he exhibits hostility rather than a communal spirit. The scenario sketched in this hymn involves the latter type of arí, whose hostility menaces the success of our sacrifice (vs. 1). Verse 3 is quite explicit about the affinity of the arí: he is “one of our own,” while a person who does not belong to the larger Ārya society is called a “wolf,” an outlaw, when his actions threaten us. The poet calls on Soma to destroy both types of enemies.Verse 4 provides a brief interlude, outlining the cosmic dimensions of Soma—from heaven to earth, where his “fingers,” the shoots of the plant, grow—and a few details of the preparation, vividly rendered. This verse cleverly incorporates four different body parts (navel, fingers, skin, and hands) each belonging to a different"},{"pageNumber":1330,"pageContent":"IX.801313entity. The final verse summarizes the process of pressing and calls once more for Soma to display his feistiness on our behalf.1. Without impulsion let our tawny drops run, forth to those dwelling in lofty heaven, when they are pressed.If hostilities will reach our refreshments, those of the stranger will go to destruction. Our insightful thoughts will prevail.2. Let our drops run forth, those arousing exhilaration, or (those) with which we speed the chargers to the stakes,across the crookedness of any mortal. May we always bear away the stakes.3. Now, in the case of the hostility of one of our own, (we proclaim:) “he, indeed, is a stranger!” And, in the case of the hostility belonging to the other (side), (we proclaim:) “he, indeed, is a wolf!”As if in a desert, thirst should strike them. O self-purifying Soma, smite those of evil intent.4. It was in heaven, in its navel to which your highest (form) was bound; your “fingers” have grown on the back of the earth.The stones gnaw you on the skin of the cow. Those of inspired thought milk you in the waters with their hands.5. In just this way, o drop, do those foremost ones, excelling in splendor, express your sap of good essence and good ornament.Self-purifying one, you will undermine every scorn(er). Let your tempestuous spirit, your dear exhilaration become manifest.IX.80 (792) Soma PavamānaVasu Bhāradvāja5 verses: jagatīOn the one hand, this hymn is somewhat static, stuck at the same stage of soma’s preparation, as the almost exact responsion of the last two verses (4–5) emphasizes. On the other hand, Soma’s relationship with the gods, especially Indra, a relation-ship that figures in every verse, enlarges the conceptual frame of the hymn and keeps it from seeming airless.1. It purifies itself—the stream of Soma, who has the gaze of men. With truth he summons the gods from heaven.With the roar of Br̥haspati he has flashed forth. Like seas they [=the waters?] envelop the pressings.2.

The preceding verse contains two occurrences of the word vásu “good (one),” which is also the name of the poet. Soma’s task of mediating between the world of gods and men is treated in verse 2, anticipating the appeal for his help to the poet in verse 3 and the invitation to the gods in verses 4–5.1. The bedizened waves of self-purifying soma go forth to the belly of Indra,when, ladled up with the curds, with the glorious (product) of the cows, the pressings have exhilarated the champion for giving.2.

Verse 3, however, is more cryptically phrased, and the name Soma is not mentioned. He appears as a buffalo with feathers and/or leaves, and his father is Parjanya (“thunder”): the image is of a plant produced by the rains. As often, his home is in the mountains, here identified as the navel of the earth. And the rinsing waters, the milk, and the pressing stones of the ritual preparation appear in the second half of the verse. Verse 4 is notable for its 1st-person singular speaker; the abrupt phrase “Listen: I am speaking to you” is reminiscent of the famous command given by the goddess Speech (Vāc) in X.125.4 “Listen to me, you who are listened to. It’s a trustworthy thing I tell you.” First-person singular speech is quite rare in Maṇḍala IX. The combination of a rid-dling middle verse and the poet’s announcement of his own speech is reminiscent of omphalos hymns, though there is little other support for such a structure.1. Soma has been pressed—the ruddy, tawny bull. Wondrous like a king, he has roared to the cows.While being purified, he circles around the sheep’s fleece, to sit, like a falcon, on his ghee-filled womb.2. As a poet with ritual expertise, you circle around the great (filter). Groomed like a steed, you rush to the prize.Warding off difficulties, o Soma, be merciful. Wearing ghee as your raiment, you drive around.3. Parjanya is the father of the feathered [/leafy] buffalo. In the navel of the earth, on the mountains he has established his dwelling place.The sister waters have also flowed to the cows. He will unite with the stones when the ceremony is undertaken.4. (Kindly) like a wife to her husband, you, kindly one, are generous of yourself. O embryo of the steadfast (earth?), listen: I am speaking to you:amid the choir I shall advance to good living.

It in many ways resembles the famous Vena hymn, X.123, which also involves a mystical iden-tification between Soma and the sun. The double meanings and enigmas are, as often, fostered by the suppression of overt reference. Crucial verbs lack expressed subjects, and unidentified asya “of him/it” substitutes for expressed possession (see 2b, 2c, 3c, 4a). The word so﻿́ma does not appear in the hymn at all, nor do his com-mon epithets. The hymn has elicited many different and contradictory interpreta-tions, to which we add our own.Attributed to the same poet as IX.73, this hymn shares with that earlier one the mystical metaphor of the filter (pavítra), which is also the name of the poet. Indeed, the words “outstretched” and “filter,” construed with each other in the last verse of IX.73 (vs. 9), open this hymn, and the two verses (73.9 and 83.1) both con-cern the qualities required to attain the filter and what it represents. In this hymn the necessary quality is being cooked, rather than raw; it is somewhat startling to encounter this whiff of Claude Lévi-Strauss very much avant la lettre. In this con-text “cooked” must refer in the first instance to the ritual preparation of soma. Although this preparation does not involve literal cooking, via application of heat, it clearly turns the raw material extracted from the natural plant into a cultural product, both through physical manipulation and through verbal accompaniment.But the filter metaphor has a cosmic dimension, as is especially clear in verse 2, where it is compared to the sun with its rays spread across the sky like the tracks of the soma across the filter. The “cooking” of verse 1 provides a neat transition to the “hot one” of verse 2, heat being an obvious characteristic of the sun.Verse 3 and the first half of verse 4 are quite enigmatic—not surprisingly, given their position in the middle of the hymn. Both the “dappled one” and the “ox” can refer both to the Sun and to Soma, each of whom is also associated with dawn, and the first half of the verse thus continues the Sun/Soma identification of verse 2. The second half of verse 3 appears to contain one of those paradoxes beloved of R̥gvedic bards. In our (very tentative) interpretation, the forefathers are the ancestral poet-sacrificers or their divine prototypes. They both “set” the embryo of Soma/Sun, that is, engendered it, and they were themselves made into poets by the magic power or artifice (māyā́) of the same Soma/Sun. In this way the Soma/Sun is both progenitor of the forefathers in their ritual role and, as they fulfill their ritual role, their child. The identity of the Gandharva in verse 4 is not entirely clear, but on the basis of parallels, especially in the Vena hymn mentioned above, it seems likely that it is again a double reference to Soma and the Sun, each guarding his"},{"pageNumber":1334,"pageContent":"IX.831317track (or perhaps the track of the other), thus taking up the theme of the track found in verse 2.With the second half of verse 4 we return to a much clearer ritual context and to the filter with which we began. The filter traps the impurities of the soma as the liquid passes over it, and the priests attain (a reprise of the verb found twice in vs. 1) the prepared soma. The final verse (5) returns to the 2nd-person address to the ritual Soma, last found in the first half of verse 1. But the Soma thus addressed has achieved a much-elevated status: he is proclaimed a king, outfitted with cosmic garments and traveling a cosmic course, with the filter, the focus of the hymn, as his chariot. The very last words of the hymn attribute to him “lofty fame.”The omphalos structure of the hymn is quite pronounced. The outermost verses (1ab, 5) are couched in the 2nd person and have a clear ritual content, with an inner ring (vss. 1cd/2ab, 4cd) serving as transition between the ritual context and the mystical identifications. There are a number of formal responsions that mark these rings, besides the 2nd versus 3rd person of verses 1 and 5: pavítram (1a, 2a) / pavítra(-ratha) (5c); páry eṣi (1b) / pári yāsi (5b); āśata (1d, 4d); padá- (2a, 4a). Enclosed within these rings are the mysterious and shifting identifications that make the hymn both aggravating and mesmerizing.1. The filter is outstretched for you, o lord of the sacred formulation. Advancing, you circle around its limbs on all sides.A raw one, with unheated body, does not attain it [=filter]; only the cooked ones, driving along, have attained it entirely.2. The filter of the hot one is outstretched to the track of heaven; its blazing threads have been extended.His swift (steeds) aid the Purifier. They mount the back of heaven in their manifestation.3. The dappled one at the front has made the dawns shine. The ox, seeking the prize, bears the worlds.They were measured out [=created] as masters of artifice by his artifice; the forefathers having their gaze on men set the embryo.4. The Gandharva guards his track just so; the infallible one protects the races of the gods.The lord of snares [=filter] grasps the defiler with his snare. Those who best perform (ritual) action have attained the draught of honey.5.

The most interesting image is found in verse 2, where Soma “performs the knotting and unknotting.” On the ritual level, this phrase probably refers to Soma’s journey through the tangle of sheep’s wool on the filter, but comparison with IX.97.18 suggests that it also has moral force, with Soma separating and distinguishing the straight way from the crooked one.1. Purify yourself—exhilarating the gods, unbounded, winning the waters—for Indra, for Varuṇa, for Vāyu.Make for us today wide space accompanied by well-being.

However, each of these longer hymns can be divided into a series of shorter ones, which then conform to the patterns of hymn arrangement.

As we will see, there are certainly striking similarities between the last quartet of IX.85 (vss. 9–12) and X.123.The first quartet (vss. 1–4) begins with Soma the militant, keeping unworthy and hostile forces at bay and aiding Indra in the same enterprise (vss. 1–2). His relation-ship to Indra persists in verses 3–4, which show a more positive side of the militant Soma: his status as king (vs. 3) and winner of space for us (vs. 4).The second section (vss. 5–8) is quite straightforward and focuses on the purifi-cation of the soma, deploying the standard tropes.As noted the final four verses (9–12) strongly resemble the Vena hymn (X.123), but they are considerably easier to decode. They concern heavenly Soma, who is identified with the sun, but who also appears in a number of different guises: a bull, a poet, and a king (all in vs. 9), an ox (vs. 10), an eagle, a child, and a bird (vs. 11), and finally a Gandharva (vs. 12).1.

The resulting triadic groupings do not at all match the divisions in the Anukramaṇī reproduced above. The degree of internal cohesion between tr̥cas varies considerably: some show no obvious signs of unity, while others (e.g., vss. 28–30) are stylistically unified. There is also some chaining across tr̥ca boundar-ies; for example, verse 4, which begins the second tr̥ca, is strictly parallel to verses 1 and 2 (especially the former). Such chaining is not an argument against the tr̥ca division, as perceived similarities between particular tr̥cas might have dictated the arrangement of originally separate hymns. The last tr̥ca (vss. 46–48), attributed to Gr̥tsamada, ends with the Gr̥tsamada clan refrain of Maṇḍala II.That said, the impression this sprawling collection gives is of an agglomeration of soma-hymn clichés, many of which are repeated with little or no variation at irregular intervals throughout the “hymn.”"},{"pageNumber":1338,"pageContent":"IX.8613211.

There are also the faintest sketches of Soma’s participation in well-known myths: the Vala myth (vs. 3cd, where Soma is credited with finding the cows), the falcon’s stealing of soma from heaven (vs. 6c), and the dog Saramā’s role in the recovery of the cows in the Vala myth (vs. 8ab).This last example neatly shows the integration of ritual and mythic themes. The first half of the verse, which alludes to the myth, does not identify the grammati-cal subject by name or attribute, but does use a pronoun to mark it as female. This might seem to exclude Soma as the referent—until we reach the final word of the verse: dhā́rā “stream,” a feminine noun regularly used of the “stream of soma,” which does allow the identification. From the mythological point of view, the dog Saramā comes out of the mountain and finds the cows in the cave; in ritual terms the (feminine) stream of soma comes out of the pressing apparatus and mixes with the cows’ milk in the vessel. And this superimposition of ritual upon myth allows Soma, indirectly, to be identified as the rescuer of the cows himself, as in verse 3.1. Run forth around the cask; sit down; being purified by men, rush to the prize.Grooming you like a prizewinning horse, they lead you toward the ritual grass with reins.2. He of good weapons, the god, the drop purifies himself, smiting malediction, protecting the community,the father, begetter of the gods, possessing good skill, prop of heaven, buttress of the earth.3.

These soma drinks have been sent surging toward bovine thousands, toward acclamations, for great immortal reward,being purified by the filters—like fame-seeking steeds driving to battle.6.

These (refreshments? verses?) are your invitatory praise.IX.88 (800) Soma PavamānaUśanas Kāvya8 verses: triṣṭubhThis hymn is structured by a series of similes; only the first verse lacks an explicit simile. Many of the similes also involve identification of Soma with other divinities (see esp. vss. 3–5, 7), and so the powers and mythological deeds of these gods are implicitly attributed to Soma by way of these comparisons.The two outer verses (1, 8) are complementary to each other. The first is addressed to Indra and announces the soma as distinctively his, while verse 8, emphasizing the 2nd-person pronoun as verse 1 did, declares that to Soma belong the distinctive qualities and attainments of the Ādityas.1. This soma is pressed for you, Indra; for you it purifies itself. You—drink of it—the one that you have made your own, that you have chosen, the drop, the soma to be yoked for exhilaration.2. It has been yoked, like a chariot that conquers much, as the great one to win many goods.Therefore, all creatures stemming from Nahus, standing upright beside the wood(en cup), roar at him at the winning of the sun.3. You, who like Vāyu with his team maintain your desired course, who like the Nāsatyas are most availing at a summons,who like the Treasure-Giver in person bring all desirable things—like Pūṣan you give speed to insight, o Soma.4. You, who like Indra are a doer of great deeds, are a stronghold-splitting smiter of obstacles, Soma.Because, like Pedu’s (horse), (you are the smiter) of those with serpents’ names, you are the smiter of every Dasyu, Soma.5.

Soma is"},{"pageNumber":1348,"pageContent":"IX.931331also a poet (vs. 2) and surrounded by poetry (vs. 3). It is this association with the kaví, the sage poet and master of words, that probably prompted the most striking statement in the hymn, that all the gods are “in your secret” (vs. 4). This statement comes in the middle of the hymn and may constitute a weak omphalos, especially as it is embedded in a series of verses that play with numbers (2–4), often a sign of an omphalos structure.1.

The hymn features similes that exploit idi-omatic ambiguity to produce different meanings in the simile proper and the frame (see esp. vss. 1 and 3) and by obscure turns of phrase (see esp. 4d). It is therefore not surprising that, as in IX.92, Soma is identified as a kaví, a poet, enmeshed in poetry (vs. 3), and the main focus of the hymn, especially in the first three verses, is the interchange between the poetic products of the mortal participants in ritual and those of Soma himself.1. When the insightful thoughts contend over him, like adornments upon a prizewinner, like the clans over the sun,choosing the waters, he purifies himself, poetically crafting a thought like a stable for the raising of livestock,2.

Soma’s speech is the topic of the first two verses, culminating in 2cd in his revelation of the “hidden names of the gods” that will be proclaimed aloud on the ritual ground. But the verbal compositions of the mortals take center stage in verses 3–4. In the final verse (5), Soma both prompts the speech of others and (it seems) produces his own.1. The tawny one keeps roaring as he is being set loose, as he is sitting in the belly of the wood, as he is being purified.Guided by men, he makes cows his raiment. Thereupon he generates poetic thoughts through his own powers.2.

The six hymns thus obtained show different degrees of internal cohesion.For example, the first four verses display clear thematic unity and development. The first verse is explicitly martial, with Soma as a warrior about to charge, a pic-ture continued in the following verse. In verse 3 he achieves one of the most desired results of Vedic warfare, wide space for us to inhabit, and with this obtained, verse 4 articulates a counter-message, that of peace and nonviolence. Indra is explicitly mentioned in the first three verses, and comradeship is a central theme, as is seen in verses 1, 2, and 4.The second hymn (vss. 5–8) shows stylistic progression. It begins with a rhe-torically restricted verse (5), consisting primarily of seven repetitions of the word “begetter” with different genitive complements. The next verse (6) continues the dominantly nominal construction of vs. 5, but with a more varied verbal repertoire, though the nominative-genitive syntagm persists. Verse 7 continues to describe the qualities and characteristic actions of Soma, in the 3rd person, though it abandons the strict nominal style. And finally vs. 8 breaks out into the dynamic 2nd person and imperative mood.The third group (vss. 9–12) ends with a characteristic hymn-final summary verse, which seems to mark a decisive break from what follows. Although no clear the-matic unity imposes itself on the four verses, the focus on Soma’s relationship with our ancestral ritualists and our hope that this relationship will continue fruitfully is noticeable, especially in the last two verses (11–12). On the other hand, it is difficult to identify any unifying features in the next group of four (vss. 13–16), which con-sist primarily of standard soma-hymn tropes. In verses 17–20 Soma as poet (esp. in vss. 17–18) and his journey from the filter to the cups provide a weak cohesion. In the final group (vss. 21–24), three verses (22–24) contain courtship imagery, and the root krand “roar” is prominent.1. The army-leader, the champion, at the forefront of the chariots, goes forth seeking cattle.

It is also the last IXth Maṇḍala hymn in triṣṭubh. Despite its extraordinary length, it can be analyzed as consisting of a series of originally independent tr̥cas combined into one, and it therefore conforms to the prevailing principles of arrangement in the Saṃhitā. In the first half (vss. 1–30) each tr̥ca is attributed to Vasiṣṭha or to a different Vasiṣṭhid; the second half is divided between two, non-Vasiṣṭhid, poets. If we assume that the tr̥ca division continues in this sec-ond half (as most scholars do), the Anukramaṇī ascription does not conform to the tr̥ca division, as the first two verses of the tr̥ca of verses 43–45 are credited to Parāśara Śāktya and the last one to Kutsa Āṅgirasa. There is also an extra verse, most probably the final one (58), which contains the Kutsa refrain of Maṇḍala I (I.94.16cd, etc.). Although according to the Anukramaṇī each of these poets is responsible for fourteen verses, there is no more apparent unity in these larger stretches than in the individual tr̥cas of the first half.As is often the case in such long, composite hymns, the tr̥cas exhibit varying degrees of cohesiveness, from the tight and emphatic verbal repetitions of verses 49–51 to the diffuseness of groupings like verses 7–9, 40–42. Some of the tr̥cas, though not thematically or verbally unified, have a third verse that marks it as final; for instance, the first two tr̥cas (vss. 1–3, 4–6) each end with the Vasiṣṭha clan refrain as the last pāda, and the final verse of three tr̥cas begins with a summary evā́ “thus” (vss. 13–15, 19–21, 25–27), a word characteristic of final verses.As might be expected, the contents of this hymn are also extremely various, but generally exhibit the standard tropes of soma hymns: the mechanisms of"},{"pageNumber":1355,"pageContent":"IX.971338soma preparation, including the journey across the filter and the mixing with waters and with milk; the power of soma to incite the gods, especially Indra, and the power of the ritualists and, especially, the poets, to strengthen the soma for this task; and the rewards the ritualists will receive from properly prepar-ing the soma. Nonetheless, the hymn contains a number of striking similes and metaphors, and some passages of great difficulty, chief among which is the tr̥ca of verses 52–54, which may (or may not) be a dānastuti and whose translation here is provisional in places. Note also verse 38, which in our interpretation con-tains an archaic formula denoting an archaic figure, the “Placer of the Sun” (see Jamison 2010).1.

The normal stages in the preparation of the soma are treated (see esp. vss. 2–3, 6–10), and the poet regularly reminds Soma of the gifts he should bring to his mortal preparers (see esp. vss. 1, 4–5, 12).

This division, made solely on numerical grounds, is confirmed by the structure of the hymn, for the final four verses repeat or ring changes on the first five. Verse 6, the first of the original second hymn, is structur-ally, and in part verbally, identical to the final verse of the original first hymn (5), but also incorporates, in variant form, verse 4d. Verse 7 repeats much of verse 1 in different order. Verse 8 deviates more from its model, verse 2, but reproduces verse 2d verbatim as verse 8d. Verse 9 is the most distant from its model, verse 3, but contains the “heaven and earth” found in the “earthly and heavenly goods” of 3cd.

There is, however, some interconnection among the tr̥cas that points to a sense of cohesion. In particular, the first and last tr̥cas (vss. 1–3 and 13–15) are linked by the striking image in their first verses (1, 13) of a sacrifice-defiling dog drawn to the sound of the soma being pressed, a dog that must be driven away. Verse 13 also contains a brief and enigmatic allusion to a myth also enigmatically mentioned to in X.171.2.Most of the rest of the hymn contains standard material: the details of prepara-tion of the drink and its journey across the filter to mix with the milk, as well as its relationship to the gods, especially Indra. There is some internal unity visible in the individual tr̥cas, but it is not pronounced.1.

There is clarity also in the general progression of the hymn, which follows Soma’s journey from the press (vs. 2) and across the filter (vs. 3) to his final preparation (vs. 7). Another theme that runs throughout is that of Soma as a child in relation to his mothers (vss. 1, 4, 7; see also 6), who not only gave him physical birth but also formed him in his ritual rule (see vs. 4).It must be admitted, however, that much remains puzzling in the hymn. There are a number of problems of syntax and lexicon. The two adjacent appearances of Trita (or “the third one,” vss. 2–3) are also unclear, though they clearly play on the numerals two and three found in those verses. The hymn is ascribed by the Anukramaṇī to Trita Āptya, and so it might be that the poet is simply inserting himself in the poem. But, since Trita Āptya is actually a mythological figure, it is more likely that the Anukramaṇī has assigned the hymn to that figure on the basis of the occurrences of tritá in those two verses.1. Through his action the child of the great (rivers), spurring on the visionary power of truth,encompasses all dear things—now once again.2.

The focus on pa﻿́ri arises from the description of the motion of the soma as it is poured in circles into the filter.Like the last hymn, this one follows the journey of Soma and also focuses on his ritual role and his participation in reciprocal ritual speech. Not only do we find the technical term vedhás “ritual adept’ (vs. 1), as in IX.102.4 and 101.15, but also the likewise technical vāghát “cantor” (vs. 5) in its only appearance in the IXth Maṇḍala. The poet’s presentation of his speech and poetic thoughts in verse 1 and the voices of the seers in verse 3 are met by Soma as himself “leader of thoughts” in verse 4.The hymn shares some lexical and thematic material with the immediately pre-ceding IX.102. In addition to the aforementioned vedhás, note, for example, the cleverly variant pādas 102.5b and 103.4b, which both contain “all the gods” and lack of deceit. But in 103 all the gods are embedded in a compound modifying Soma, whereas in 102 they are syntactically independent; moreover, the “deceit” theme is carried by two different roots (dabh, druh) in two different valences: the gods of 102 do not deceive, while Soma in 103 cannot be deceived. It is difficult not to consider 102 and 103 as composed in conversation with each other, and the Anukramaṇī’s ascription of 103 to Dvita Āptya (“the second Āptya”) clearly plays off 102’s Trita Āptya (“the third Āptya”—but also the original Āptya from a myth-ological perspective, since he is a commonly mentioned figure and has an Avestan correspondent, whereas Dvita Āptya is essentially found only here).1. Forth to the ritual adept, to Soma as he is being purified, shall I bear the upraised speechlike a present, along with my thoughts. He will find enjoyment.2. Around the sheep’s fleeces he rushes, being anointed with cows.Being purified, the tawny one creates three seats for himself.3.

In this case the division is in general accord with the Anukramaṇī, which ascribes the hymn to three different mythical poets, marked by their patronymic relationships as grandson, son, and father, each with a tr̥ca. The grandson returns as poet of the last five verses, that is, of the final tr̥ca (10–12) and the two-verse unit that ends the hymn.The contents of the hymn are entirely conventional, with a focus on Indra as drinker of the soma, especially in the first part of the hymn.

In particular, 20cd “We have flown like birds far past the sun . . . ” recalls several famous 1st-person descriptions of soma’s effects: VIII.48.3 “We have drunk the soma; we have become immortal; we have gone to the light; we have found the gods” and X.119, the Laba-sūkta, in which the soma-drinker flies through the cosmos, describing his bird’s eye view of heaven and earth.1.

On the other hand, there are signs of ring composition: the first phrase of the hymn, “purify yourself as the most honeyed for Indra, o Soma” recurs as the framing words of the first verse of the final pragātha (vs. 15), and the relative clause about the drinking of soma that introduces verse 2 is echoed, with the same relative pronoun, in 14a.Allusions to the Vala myth are found in the interior of the hymn (vss. 4, 6). The heavenly soma, conceived of in part as rain, is also a prominent theme (vss. 9–11, and also probably vss. 4 [the “dear immortal one”] and 6 [the “watery” cows]).

(The meter’s name means “ant-middled,” because a short pāda is sandwiched between two longer ones.) Despite the hetero-geneity of the meters, there is evidence that the hymn is a conceptual unity, par-ticularly in the signs of ring composition: the last two verses (11–12) echo the first two. “The one who gains the prize” (11c) matches “to gain the prize” in 1a; the two forms of the root sah “vanquish” in verse 12 (a and c) recall the “vanquisher” in 1b; the “difficult plunges” in 12b are the negative counterpart of Soma’s plunge in 2c. Internally we may note that the begetting of the sun in verse 3, at the end of the first tr̥ca (3a, with its initial verb ájījanaḥ) is immediately reprised in 4a, in a new meter, again with the fronted verb ájījanaḥ.The hymn also echoes some of the vocabulary and phraseology of the preceding hymn, X.109, whose metrical simplicity is in marked contrast to this hymn. Both hymns begin almost identically, though adjusted by the addition of particles for the metrical difference: IX.109.1a pári prá dhanva and 110.1a páry ū ṣú prá dhanva . . . , both meaning “run forth and around.” The rare word pīyū́ṣa “beestings, first-milk,” which makes two appearances in 109 (vss. 3, 6), recurs in 110.8, qualified as “the beestings of heaven” (diváḥ pīyū́ṣam) like the “heavenly beestings” of 109.3 (divyáḥ pīyū́ṣaḥ).In content the first three and the last three (10–12) verses are fairly straight-forward, and, especially the last three verses, are concerned with the earthly soma of the ritual, though also celebrating his great powers in confronting enemies and obstacles. A hint of the cosmic soma comes in verse 3, in the aforementioned beget-ting of the sun, though in this verse this action is linked with Soma’s ritual progress. The middle six verses (4–9), in an otherwise unattested meter, are more difficult and treat the interaction and blurred boundaries between earthly, ritual soma and"},{"pageNumber":1378,"pageContent":"IX.1101361cosmic soma. The gods’ yearning for soma (see esp. vs. 6) and the primal prepara-tion of soma (see esp. vss. 7–8) are described, and the final verse of this group (vs. 9) declares Soma’s universal power.1.

The poet, according to the Anukramaṇī, is Anānata son of Parucchepa, a poet not otherwise represented in the R̥gveda. However, his putative father, Parucchepa, is the author, again according to the Anukramaṇī, of I.127–39, the only sustained corpus of atyaṣṭi in the R̥gveda.The hymn begins with a description of Soma’s journey, and the final verse (vs. 3) returns to this theme. The middle verse (vs. 2) is a brief, and quite enigmatic, treatment of the Vala myth. In our view it involves something of a reversal of some standard tropes. The 2nd-person subject of the first three pādas of the verse is Soma, who is here credited with retrieving the cows stolen by the Paṇis. These cows, of course, also represent the milk with which the soma will be mixed. Soma then grooms or cleans these cows along with his (or their?) mothers. Now ordinarily it is Soma who is groomed; he doesn’t perform any grooming on others. And a number of translators and commentators have attempted to make the verb used here (mar-jayasi) reflect this normal usage. However, this particular verb form is emphatically and unambiguously transitive, and it seems likely that the poet is thus drawing our attention to the role reversal, with the usual female agents of Soma’s grooming relegated to auxiliaries.The reference of the next item, the melody or sāman, is equally obscure. If it is part of the Vala myth, it may refer to the song sung by Indra/Br̥haspati and the Aṅgirases to open the cave and free the cows; they came “from afar” bringing their song, and to the cows within the cave the song would have sounded “from afar.” It is also possible that the simile just refers to a general situation, the pleasure one gets from hearing a snatch of song out of nowhere. In any case in the last portion of this verse Soma acquires vigor or vitality from the cows, who are also identified as the three forms of ritual speech.1. Being purified with this golden light, he crosses all hatreds with (horses) of his own yoking—like the Sun with the (horses) of his own yoking.In the stream of pressed (juice) he shines ruddy and tawny as he is being purified,when he makes the circuit of all his forms by (the impetus of) the versifiers—by (the impetus of) the versifiers with their seven mouths.2. You found that good thing of the Paṇis [=herd of cows].

The diversity of people’s occupations and of their goals is the theme, presented in casual style and sometimes colloquial language (see especially the designations for father and mother in vs. 3), with the gently cynical message that what everyone really wants is gain or an easy life. The final verse (4) opens out to the nonhuman world.Perhaps the most interesting verse, as a small window on realia, is the second one, which presents a rare picture of a smith and his equipment. The “old plants” must be for producing a hot fire, the “feathers of birds” for fanning the flames, and the stones are probably whetstones.Casting about for a reason for the refrain and for the inclusion of this hymn in the IXth Maṇḍala—it may be that the point of the refrain is that, like the people and animals mentioned in the body of the text, the drop has its own goal, particular to itself, namely simply to seek Indra. Or perhaps the hymn was simply too delight-ful to abandon.1. Truly our thoughts are various, and the obligations of peoples are different:a carpenter seeks the broken, a healer the injured, a formulator a man who presses soma.– O drop, flow around for Indra.2.

Most strikingly, the imagery that describes this heaven—its freedom, joy, and sat-isfaction of all desires—occurs again in the Upaniṣads to characterize the mysti-cal realization of the self. The hymn begins more or less as a conventional soma hymn, however. In verse 1 Indra is urged to drink the soma to strengthen himself for action, and in verse 2 Soma is commanded to purify himself, with the signature imperative pavasva. Verse 2 also introduces the theme of true ritual speech, which is taken up again in verses 4–6. Verse 3 seems to contain an interlude about the rain, which provides the sap to the soma plant, though the mythological sequence involv-ing the Daughter of the Sun and the Gandharvas is obscure.Verses 6 and 7 are the omphalos verses and provide a dramatic transition from the poet’s description of the preparation of soma in the first half of the hymn to a vision of heaven (vss. 7–11), where immortality and the fulfillment of all desires are attained. Verse 6 is still set on the ritual ground and is in some ways the climax of the hymn, for it anticipates the drinking of the soma. Since soma is the drink of deathlessness, the ceremony becomes the place of immortality. Verse 6 is also gram-matically incomplete, consisting only of a dependent clause and producing tension awaiting resolution in a main clause that will answer the implicit question: “what will happen in this ‘where’?” The first half of verse 7 is responsive to 6 and thus builds the tension, but the locus of the “where” has changed: the poet has trans-formed the ritual space into the heavenly realm. The tension finds its release in the second half of verse 7, with the long-postponed main clause. The remaining verses reproduce the structure of verse 7, enlarging and embellishing the vision of the immortal world.What links the first half of the hymn to the second, besides the transforma-tive responsion of verses 6–7? The answer is not entirely clear, but it seems that the true speech that accompanies the preparation of the soma (vs. 2), perhaps the natural speech of the thunder (vs. 3), the true speech Soma himself speaks (vs. 4), the sacred formulation with which he is purified (vs. 5), and the verbal behavior of"},{"pageNumber":1382,"pageContent":"IX.1131365the formulator of that formulation (vs. 6) provide Soma with the power to bestow immortality. He does so by placing the poet in the immortal realms, and placing is also a recurrent theme in the first half of the hymn: Indra places soma’s strength in himself in verse 1; the rain is placed in soma as his juice in verse 3; soma is pre-pared by the Placer in verse 4; the sun was placed in the heavenly world in 7b, and finally the poet implores Soma to place him in the same world in 7c. The first two of these placings also involve clear transformation of substance: soma becomes Indra’s strength; the rain becomes soma’s sap. We can also see transformation in the Placer’s preparation of soma in verse 4, as this preparation makes a physical substance into a drink of immortality, and ultimately in Soma’s placing of the poet in the immortal world, which will make the poet himself immortal. The command of the second half of verse 7 “place me in that immortal, imperishable world” is fol-lowed by the command refrain of the remaining four verses (8–11), “there make me immortal,” a sequence that appears to support the notion that the “placing” both precedes and causes the poet’s transformation.1.

The seer addresses himself in verse 2, and the fortunate ritualist depicted in verse 1 is most likely Kaśyapa as well. In verse 3 he produces a triad of heptads, which have little to do with his call to Soma to protect us (3d). The final verse (4) repeats this call and enlarges on the dangers we wish to avoid.1.

As a whole, X was certainly the final addition to the codified R̥gveda, and it contains many hymns with younger linguistic features and “popular” themes, or at least subjects that were not central to the soma sacrifice that dominates the rest of the R̥gveda and determines the choice of hymns to be included or excluded in the rest of the text. These include life-cycle rituals like the funeral and the wedding, meta-reflections on the sacrifice and its parts, additional mythological material, celebrations of deities and divine forces peripheral to the soma sacrifice, dramatic monologues and dialogues, healing spells and curses, and so forth. However, it is easy to overemphasize the special character of X, for, when compared even with the chronologically close Atharvaveda, the intricate, playful, and allusive style, the lexicon, and the complex development of themes of most of X are quite distinctively R̥gvedic.Approximately half the maṇḍala is organized into collections generally attrib-uted to individual poets. The first few of these collections are comparable in num-ber of hymns to those in I, but starting with X.61 the hymns are arranged first in pairs (61–84) and then, beginning with X.85, as individual hymns.This maṇḍala contains too many striking hymns, famous or unsung, to list here. The reader is referred to the introductions to the individual collections and hymns.The first nine hymns of Maṇḍala X are assigned to two different poets: Trita Āptya 1–7 and Triśiras Tvā ṣṭra (“Three-Headed Son of Tvaṣṭar”) 8–9. Both of these are mythological figures, who appear as opponents in the same myth, which is narrated briefly at the end of X.8. Although the poets’ names were generated from the mytho-logical material and therefore do not reflect “real” poets, it is clear from their narra-tive connection that the hymns belong together (Oldenberg 1888: 232–35).All of the Trita Āptya hymns (1–7) and the first two-thirds of X.8 are dedicated to Agni. The last three verses of X.8 (7–9), where the myth of the confrontation of Trita Āptya and his three-headed opponent is narrated, is assigned to Indra by the Anukramaṇī.

But this nascent fire is endowed with cosmic importance, identi-fied as the embryo of the two worlds (vs. 2) and compared to Viṣṇu in his lofty reach (vs. 3ab). The role of his hymnists is also given its due (3cd), and Agni’s pivotal priestly role in the sacrifice is emphasized as the hymn continues (vss. 5cd–7). In the final verse (7) Agni is sent forth to bring the gods to the ritual ground, where the sacrifice can begin.1. At the forefront of the dawns he has stood upright on high. Having gone out from darkness, he has come here with light.With his luminous beam, Agni, beautiful of limb, has filled all the seats at his birth.2. At your birth you are the embryo of the two world-halves, o Agni, the beloved one dispersed among the plants.A brilliant babe, circling around the dark shades and the nights, you have come forth from your mothers, constantly roaring.3.

In this feature it reminds us of the hymns devoted to the r̥tugrahas (the offering of “sequential cups” to an ordered set of divinities by an ordered series of priests); see I.15 and II.36–37. Although our hymn has much in common with those hymns, it does not provide the complete series, as those hymns do. Instead it focuses on Agni as the Hotar and the central figure in the sacrificial program—the senior partner, as it were, in the ritual enterprise involving both Agni and mortals as officiants. Agni’s most important quality in this hymn is knowl-edge: he is called vidvā́n (or pravidvā́n) “knowing” four times in the hymn (vss. 1, 3, 4, 7), and “discerning” (vijānán) once (vs. 5). The epithet we have translated as “Establisher of Thought” in verse 2 (mandhātár) probably also participates in this theme, since it is etymologically almost identical to the name of the chief divinity in the Old Iranian pantheon, Ahura Mazdā, “Lord Wisdom” (< Proto Indo-Iranian *mn̥s-dhaH). Mortals, by contrast, are very un-knowing (áviduṣṭara, vs. 4) and prone to moral and ritual mistakes (vss. 4–5).Less prominent in the hymn, but noteworthy because of the importance of this theme later in the Xth Maṇḍala, is the distinction between the path going to the gods (vs. 3) and that to the forefathers (vs. 7), which figures prominently in the funeral hymns (X.14–18).1. Please the gods, who are eager for it, o youngest one. Knowing the ritual sequences, o lord of the sequences, perform the sacrifice here.Those divine sequential-sacrificers—along with them, o Agni, you are the best sacrificer among the Hotars.2.

You are the Establisher of Thought and the Giver of Wealth, possessing the truth.(When) at the svāhā-call we shall make the oblations, let Agni the god sacrifice to the gods, (himself) deserving it.3. We have come along the path of the gods, to carry forward along it what we can.Agni is the one who knows: he will perform the sacrifice; just he is the Hotar. He will arrange the rites, he the ritual sequences.4.

Agni’s triumph over Night, a female, and his welcoming of Dawn, likewise a female, are the subjects of the first three verses, and the whole hymn is pervaded by Agni’s wide shining and the many words that express his radiance and brightness.The poet is also fond of synesthetic images, as when his journeys “kindle” calls in verse 4, or his beams “purify themselves” (the signature verb of the soma drinks) like sounds (probably of soma as well) in verse 5. The poet’s pet word for Agni, aratí “spoked wheel” (vss. 1, 2, 6, and 7), presumably originally referring to the shape of the fireplace, prompts a number of chariot and journey images through the hymn (vss. 4, 6, 7).1. The powerful spoked wheel, now kindled, has appeared, to exercise his skill—he who is Rudra-wild but of easy birth, o king.Observant, he beams widely with his lofty beam. Driving away black (Night), he comes to luminous (Dawn).2.

What gives the hymn its character are the concentrated and somewhat unusual images that are studded through it. This is already evident in verse 1, where Agni (who is fire, after all) is compared to “the first drink in a wasteland”; presumably the point of comparison is that both are eagerly desired and it is not certain they will appear. A series of similes involving domestic animals follow in verses 2–3, while verses 4–6 concern the firewood that covers the nascent fire and that it begins to consume. The most elaborate and surprising image is found in verse 6, where the two arms of the priest who is tending the fire are compared to two thieves entering the woods, risking their lives. “Going into the woods” must refer to the manipula-tion of the firewood; the “risk” must be that of being burned. But why “thieves”? Most commentators think that the thieves are entering the wood to attack travel-ers and tie them up with cords—the ten cords compared to the priest’s ten fingers. Perhaps, but the image is the more resonant for not being entirely transparent.1. I begin the sacrifice to you and I propel my thought to you, so that you will become the one to be extolled at our invocations.You are like the first drink in a wasteland, o Agni, for Pūru who seeks to attain (you), you age-old king."},{"pageNumber":1389,"pageContent":"X.513722.

There are numerous conflicting interpretations of this hymn, not surprisingly. We will just present our own, with all due caution. In our view the standard theme of the birth of Agni/the ritual fire, its growing strength, and the rise of its flames and smoke to heaven is grafted onto a treatment of the mysteries of creation and a claim that poets (or, to be more explicit, “sage poets,” kaví) have special access to these mysteries and indeed antici-pate and direct the natural processes.We should start by noting that the name Agni occurs only once in the hymn, at the beginning of the last half-verse (7c), though he is present in every verse. The hymn begins with a reference to the sea, but various parallels make it clear that this “sea” is really the sea in our heart and the source of poetic insight. The poet claims that this sea is a single entity, but that Agni, who has many births, emerges"},{"pageNumber":1390,"pageContent":"X.51373from it. Already the poet is establishing the priority of poetry over even the god Agni and the ritual he represents. Pāda c seems to describe the birth of Agni from the kindling sticks (or possibly also the two world-halves, or night and day). His later journey to heaven is anticipated by his identification with a bird in pāda d.In verse 2 the bullish buffaloes in the same nest and the mares with which they unite are presumably the flames of the fire, mingling and twisting in the fireplace. The birth of the fire is further described in verse 3, where again the two parents referred to are probably the kindling sticks but may also represent cosmic pairings. The cosmic aspect becomes clear in verse 4, where the fire rises between the two world-halves, which nourish it. The fire rises in the midspace with its flames in verse 5, while in verse 6 it is pictured as a pillar stretching to very highest heaven. Verse 6 reprises some of the vocabulary of the beginning of the hymn: the foundation (dharúṇa) of verse 1 and the nest (nīḍá) of verse 2 and thus transports the original earthly birthplace of fire to a new location.The final verse (7) connects this heavenward journey of the fire [/Agni] with the issue of creation. The paradoxical phrase “both the nonexistent and the existent” that famously begins the creation hymn X.129 is a signal that the undifferentiated mass of matter (for want of a better word) that precedes real creation is present in the highest heaven where the male Dakṣa, the “skillful one” (in this case identified with Agni), and the female Aditi, the pair that set the processes of creation into motion in another famous creation hymn (X.72; see esp. vss. 4–5), are born. Agni is also identified with the androgynous bovine (both bull and milk-cow) that pre-sides over creation in another treatment thereof (III.38; see esp. vs. 7). Thus “our” just-born ritual fire is identified as both the first created thing and the creator itself, and ritual time, as so often, recapitulates cosmic time.We have not yet said anything about the poets’ role, beyond noting the assertion of priority in verse 1. In verses 2–3 the poets oversee “the track of truth” and control the thread that others (priests? gods?) are pursuing; we interpret this to mean that the poets are directing or at least keeping safe the cosmic progress of the fire (see the trails in vs. 4), and in verse 6 it is the poets who establish the boundaries that define its journey. Also in verse 2 they anticipate the endpoint of the fire’s journey by setting in a secret place “the highest names.” Since creation is generally viewed as the differentiation of the mass mentioned above into individual entities with “name and form,” the poets’ control of the hidden names in verse 2 signals their participation in the creative process.There is much that remains unclear in this hymn, particularly the seven boundaries in verse 6. But the connection between the birth of the ritual fire and the Ur-creation, mediated by the poets, seems to be the conceptual focus of this hymn.1. The sea is (just) one, the foundation of riches, but he, having many births, gazes out from us, from our heart.He attends upon the udder in the lap of the two that are hidden. The track of the bird has been set down in the middle of the wellspring."},{"pageNumber":1391,"pageContent":"X.613742.

It begins with an annunciatory “here he is,” and the remainder of the first three verses consists of relative clauses describing Agni. Relative clauses also dominate verses 5–6. The contents are fairly standard: Agni’s radiance (esp. vss. 1–2), his role in the sacrifice and his reciprocal relationship with the poet and priest (vss. 3–5), and prayers for Agni’s intervention in bringing help and other good things to us (vss. 6–7).

Agni’s supreme competence as a sacrificer is contrasted with the potential incompetence of the mortal sacrificer in verse 4, as in X.2.5. Otherwise the hymn seems primarily con-cerned with the material gain that will come to the mortal sacrificer for his ritual efforts (see esp. vss. 1d, 2, 4, and 7).1.

(See Oldenberg 1888: 233–34.) The poet of X.8–9 is given as Triśiras Tvāṣṭra, a speaking name: “Three-Headed Son of Tvaṣṭar” and a figure who is the mythological enemy of Trita. Thus, as Oldenberg saw, the two poets to whom this sequence of nine hymns is ascribed are narratively linked, and both names were probably assigned as poets to these hymns because of the mythological narrative sketched in this particular hymn."},{"pageNumber":1394,"pageContent":"X.81377Trita’s defeat of his three-headed foe, also known as Viśvarūpa (“having all forms”), is treated in the last three verses of our hymn (7–9). The myth goes back to Indo-Iranian times in one form or other. In the Younger Avestan Hom Yašt (Yasna 9–11), Zarathushtra asks the Haoma (= Skt. Soma) the names and stories of the men who first pressed him. In Y 9.7–8 Haoma names a certain Āθβiia (note the similarity to, but not identity with, Āpt(i)ya) as the second man to press him, whose son, Θraētaona, smote a mighty serpent-dragon (Aži Dahāka; cf. the Sanskrit cognate áhi “serpent” frequently used of Vr̥tra) with three heads (θrikamǝrǝδa; cf. mūrdhán “head” in vss. 3 and 6 of this hymn). Immediately thereafter (Y 9.10–11) he identifies Θrita (= Skt. Trita) as his third presser, one of whose sons defeats another formidable dragon (also aži) in a particularly imaginative fashion. The names Āθβiia and Θrita, though differently distributed, and the three-headed mon-ster speak strongly for the kinship of the two myths, though they are not identical in all their features.What is not clear is why this little mythic vignette has been appended at the end of this Agni cycle, though we will suggest some reasons at the end of the introduc-tion. Here and elsewhere in Vedic the story of Trita Āptya’s slaying of three-headed Viśvarūpa is associated with Indra (even in this hymn; see vss. 8–9), not Agni, and it is assimilated in several ways to the better-known Vala myth—generally an Indra myth. First, Trita Āptya begins his quest in a cave or hole of some sort (vs. 7a), and the happy result of the defeat of Viśvarūpa is the release of his cows (vss. 8–9)—just as the cows confined in the Vala cave are released at the end of that myth. Moreover, the “familial” (vs. 7) or “ancestral” (vs. 8) weapons Trita employs in the fight appear to be mental and verbal (see especially the “visionary thought” he seeks in 7b and his “speaking” his weapons in 7d). In the Vala myth Indra and his helpers, the Aṅgirases, break open the cave with verbal spells, not physical weapons. Since the corresponding Avestan version does not have these elements, it is likely that these Vala-like features were grafted onto the inherited myth, whose popularity was per-haps waning in R̥gvedic times. (It does have a robust revival in Vedic prose.)The first few verses of the hymn for the most part contain standard Agni fare, though with a cosmic dimension. The fire, conceived of also as a powerful male animal, reaches through the worlds to heaven itself (vs. 1), just after it is born (vs. 2). His birth and installation are further treated in verse 3, where the ritual references probably also have cosmic referents. The hymn begins to take an odd turn in verse 4. In that verse Agni “sets seven steps,” thereby “begetting an alliance (or, the god Mitra).” The seven-step reference is to the culminating ritual action particularly of the marriage ceremony, after which the marriage is irrevocable, when the bride and groom take seven steps together; other alliances can be assimilated to the mar-riage alliance by the performance of the seven steps (see Jamison 1996a: 120–23). These seven steps are always taken beside the ritual fire, and as Proferes (2007) has discussed at length (on this particular passage, see p. 61), the fire is also a symbol of the alliances made by social groups. Through those alliances the fire itself is strengthened and increased, hence the “for the sake of your own body” in this verse. The reason for this intrusion of the social world at this point in the hymn is unclear,"},{"pageNumber":1395,"pageContent":"X.81378since heretofore the focus has been entirely on Agni. In the following verses (5–6) Agni is identified with, or transformed into, a series of divinities and functional roles. Perhaps these identifications were suggested by the alliance generated in verse 4, representing the web of associations in which Agni participates.The six Agni verses end with Agni setting his head (mūrdhán) in heaven. As noted above, the hymn in fact contains two occurrences of mūrdhán (vss. 3, 6), and its Avestan cognate kamǝrǝδan (with pejorative ka-prefix), in the bahuvrīhi Θri-kamǝrǝδa “having three heads,” qualifies the monster killed by Āθβiia’s son. The corresponding form in the Trita myth in this hymn has a different word for head, -śíras- (acc. sg. m. tri-śīrṣā́ṇam, vs. 8). However, the R̥gveda does contain an occurrence of tri-mūrdhán—but referring to Agni, in the phrase trimūrdhā́naṃ saptáraśmim “having three heads and seven reins” (I.146.1). The three heads are most likely the three ritual fires, the seven reins possibly the seven priests, but the important thing is that this same phrase, “having three heads and seven reins,” is found in our hymn X.8, describing the enemy Viśvarūpa (8c). This, we would submit, is the initial point of contact between this Agni hymn and the Trita saga appended to it: the old Indo-Iranian myth used the word *tri-mr̥Hdhan for the three-headed beast. But the epithet can also be used positively as a descriptor of Agni with his three representative fires on the ritual ground. The poet is playing with the delicious positive/negative polarities of the epithet, and signals the connection between the Agni portion of the hymn and the little Trita myth by using the word originally used of the monster, mūrdhán, elsewhere in the hymn.But there may be another connection. As we noted, Agni undergoes several transformations in the last verses of his section of the hymn. And it is quite possible that verse 7 is suggesting yet another transformation, into Trita or “the third (fire),” being born in the fireplace, seeking poetic vision and ritual release. Agni sometimes seems to be called Trita (see esp. X.46.3, 6), and the Trita/Viśvarūpa story may be introduced here via a modulation through Agni identified with Trita.1. With his lofty beacon Agni drives forth; the bull keeps bellowing to the two world-halves.He has reached up even to the farthest ends of heaven; the buffalo has grown strong in the lap of the waters.2. He rejoices as an embryo, as a hump-backed bull.

He who has seized the head of his two parents [=Heaven and Earth? kindling sticks?], (him) they [=priests] have set down at the rite as the sun’s undulating flood.At his flight the ruddy females [=flames? dawns?] with the horse [=fire?] as their foundation find pleasure in their own bodies within the womb of truth."},{"pageNumber":1396,"pageContent":"X.913794.

The paradox of “fire in the waters” (as embodied else-where in the figure of Apām Napat “Child of the Waters,” identified with Agni) is also alluded to in verses 6 and 8. The healing and life-giving qualities of the Waters are also found in the two preceding verses (4–5).The first three verses of the hymn stand somewhat apart from the remainder of the hymn and progress from the bland and generic to a rather surprising conclusion. Verse 1 simply describes the Waters as refreshing and asks them for nourishment"},{"pageNumber":1397,"pageContent":"X.91380and happiness. In verse 2 the refreshment is specified as juice or sap (rása) and implicitly compared to breast milk, since the Waters themselves are compared to mothers. And then there is the very puzzling verse 3, which can only be understood as an enlargement of that simile, for it is said that the Waters “animate and beget us.” But even more puzzling than their apparent role in giving birth to “us” is their purpose in so doing: so that we will go to be “fit” for the dwelling of an unidentified third party. This third party is generally assumed, most likely correctly, to be the patron of the sacrifice, and the poet/sacrificer calls upon the Waters to (re)vivify him, send him to the house of the patron, and make him fit to render service to this patron in the form of hymns and ritual labor—but the stark economy with which this sentiment is expressed challenges the modern interpreter.1. Since you Waters are sheer refreshment, so destine us for nourishmentand to see great happiness.2. Your most beneficent juice—make us have a share in that here,like eager mothers (their milk).3. Let us, as your (offspring), go to be fit for him for whose peaceful dwelling you animateand beget us, o Waters.4.

O Waters, fully grant healing and protection for my bodyand (for me) to see the sun for a long time.8. O Waters, carry this away, whatever trouble is in me—whether I have committed deceit or I have cursed—as well as untruth.9. O Waters, today I have followed (you). We have united with your sap.Full of milk, o Agni, come here. Merge me with luster.The next ten hymns (X.10–19) form a Yama cycle, though the subject matter found in the individual hymns is quite various. Yama, the son of Vivasvant, is king of the land of the dead because he was the first mortal to die. Yet he was apparently born immortal (see esp. I.83.5) and chose to become mortal, subject to death, “for the sake of the gods . . . and for the sake of offspring” (X.13.4). The opening hymn in the cycle, the dialogue of Yama and his twin sister Yamī, on the fraught topic of embarking on incestuous sex in order to produce offspring, addresses Yama’s change of status and his choice, but in a deliberately oblique and misleading fashion, as Yama spurns the sexual advances of his sister, and at the end of their bitter argument there seems little likelihood of children."},{"pageNumber":1398,"pageContent":"X.101381The last six hymns in this cycle (X.14–19) are collectively known as funeral hymns. The first, X.14, is devoted especially to Yama in his role as king of the realm of the dead, while the others, especially 15–18, concern various aspects of death and the treatment of the dead—for example, the forefathers who preceded us to Yama’s realm in X.15, the cremation fire in X.16, the funeral itself in X.18. The intermediate hymns, X.11–13, have less superficially clear connections to the Yama saga, but both X.12 (vss. 6–7) and X.13 (vss. 4–5) make important comments on Yama and on Yama’s choice.There is also an underlying unifying theme, that of duality and twinned-ness: the absolute disjunction between and the ultimate complementarity and unity of the mortal and the immortal, life and death, men and gods, men and women, heaven and earth, sacred and profane. It is appropriate that the cycle should begin with the dialogue between the primal twins, Yama and Yamī, whose very names mean “twin” and who bridge the gap between mortal and immortal.X.10 (836) Dialogue of Yama and Yamı̄Yama Vaivasvata and Yamī Vaivasvatī14 verses: triṣṭubhThis justly famous (and much discussed) hymn presents a tense dialogue between a pair of twins, the male Yama and female Yamī (yama﻿́ means “twin”; yamī́ is the feminine form), who become the first mortals. Yamī́, who speaks first, urges her twin brother to have sex with her, so that they can have children and continue their line in the approved manner. Yama indignantly rejects her advances, outraged by the idea of incest and certain that the divine guardians of moral order will see the act and punish them.It is impossible in a short introduction to do justice to the richness of this hymn and the extraordinary skill with which the poet deploys grammatical categories such as person, number, and verb modality in service of the condensed drama of their encounter. Both Yamī and Yama make legalistic arguments, often using juridi-cal turns of phrase, and especially in the first part of the hymn they distance the personal and emotional implications of their speech by regularly using plural and 3rd-person forms to refer to each other. It is not until the last word of verse 4 that one of them uses a 1st-person dual (“we two”) form. They also use dueling divine models for the relationships they are arguing for: Yama cites their near ancestors, “the Gandharva in the waters and the watery maiden,” as reason not to violate the incest taboo (vs. 4) and Mitra and Varuṇa as stern enforcers (vs. 6) with spies everywhere (vs. 8)—while Yamī claims that Tvaṣṭar, who shapes embryos in the womb, made them a married couple already in the womb (vs. 5) and twice (vss. 5, 9) invokes as their divine counterparts Heaven and Earth, a notoriously incestuous pair (as she makes quite explicit in 9c). The use and placement of kinship terms"},{"pageNumber":1399,"pageContent":"X.101382in the hymn is also notable, including the fact that “brother” and “sister” are not encountered until verse 11. It is also striking that the names of the speakers do not appear until verse 7.The emotional temperature of the hymn rises significantly at that very point. Ya mī abandons her legalistic arguments—that they need to have offspring, that they were already a married couple in the womb—in favor of a naked expression of sexual desire. Yama remains unmoved, but the roiling emotions are reflected in the ragged meter of some of the later verses (12–13), especially in the latter verse where Yamī breaks off her speech in frustration in a very short pāda containing two occurrences of a word (bata﻿́) found nowhere else and exhibiting aberrant phonology. Our render-ing of the word aims at the level of slangy insult to which bata﻿́ appears to belong.The hymn ends in an impasse. Yama remains obdurate and urges Yamī to find another lover—a difficult quest when there are no other mortals!

The last three verses (7–9), in triṣṭubh, are fairly straightforward, describing the benefits that accrue to a mortal who serves the ritual fire and calling on Agni to bring the divinities to the sacrifice and let it begin.The first six verses, in jagatī, are far more complex, and, when viewed as a piece, without the three triṣṭubh verses at the end, turn out to have an omphalos struc-ture: the middle pair of verses (3–4) are parallel in structure, have the phrase agníṃ ho﻿́tāram “Agni (as) Hotar” opening their final pādas, and together treat both the"},{"pageNumber":1401,"pageContent":"X.111384initiation of the current sacrifice and the charter myths for the introduction of the two ritual substances, fire and soma (with concomitant juggling of verb tenses). In verse 3 the first sacrificer, Manu, is present at the kindling of the ritual fire; verse 4 sketches the famous tale of the falcon’s theft of soma from heaven.The outer verse pairs, 1–2 and 5–6, treat these two substances and their deified counterparts, fire/Agni and soma/Soma, both simultaneously and in parallel, with the referent often left unclear. The final verse of this section (6) is especially busy, with both Agni and Soma actively performing their ritual tasks at the same time (and perhaps under the same descriptions; see esp. 6c). The tentative identifications in that verse are made on the basis of the use of the phraseology in other parts of the R̥gveda. For example, the exact phrase “he trembles with his thought” is used of Soma in IV.71.3, and the verb translated as “he displays his power” (taviṣyá) in that same pāda has Soma as its subject in its two other occurrences. However, it is very likely that the poet expected the audience to consider both possibilities for the referent in each case and to grasp thereby the underlying commonalities of the two ritual substances. The first section of the hymn is thus a simpler example of the conflation of Agni and Soma found in the fiendish hymn V.44.1. The bull [=Soma] has milked out his draughts of milk for the bull [=Indra] by the milking of heaven—he the youthfully exuberant, undeceivable (son) of Aditi.He [=Agni] knows everything, as Varuṇa does, through his insight. Let him who is worthy of the sacrifice perform sacrifice throughout the sacrificial sequences.2.

Our eldest brother [=Agni] will proclaim (it) first.3. And even now Dawn, rich in cattle, rich in glory, accompanied by the Sun, has dawned for Manu,when they [=priests] beget Agni as Hotar for the ritual distribution—him being eager for it and following the will of those who are (also) eager.4. And this drop here [=Soma], widespread and widely visible, has the bird, the falcon that was sent (for it), brought here to the rite,when the Ārya clans choose wondrous Agni as their Hotar.

It begins inno-cently enough, with two verses devoted to the sacrifice initiated by Agni as Hotar, with Heaven and Earth as witnesses—picking up the topic of the last verse of the preceding hymn (X.11.9). In our view, the third verse continues that theme: an obla-tion derived from a cow, probably ghee, is made into the fire; thus it is Agni’s “own acquisition.” This sacrificial event in some sense generates the gods and their cos-mic activity, which is framed as a ya﻿́jus or sacrificial formula, and it also generates the rain, the “heavenly ghee.” We may see here an early example of the famous Upaniṣadic doctrine of the Five Fires and the water-cycle, whereby the oblations, produced from the plants and animals on the earth, rise to heaven as smoke and return to earth as water, to start the cycle anew. The sacrifice begun in verse 1 seems to end with verse 4, where Heaven and Earth are again (as in vs. 1) called upon to hear us. What has been added conceptually is the notion that Heaven and Earth also participate in the cycle that the sacrifice controls, by producing rain (“honey”) in the course of time.The second half of the hymn (vss. 5–8; vs. 9 is repeated from the preceding hymn, X.11.9) appears to be on another subject, or several other subjects, entirely. It begins with the worried speaker speculating on what wrong we have done to Varuṇa, con-trasting the unfathomable reactions of that god with the more forthright and reliable Mitra. It ends (vs. 8cd) with the perhaps over-hopeful assertion that Mitra, along"},{"pageNumber":1403,"pageContent":"X.121386with Aditi and Savitar, will declare us blameless to Varuṇa. But the verses in between (6–7) at first seem unconnected with this current drama. It is our contention, how-ever, that these verses, especially verse 6 about Yama, provide the mythological sup-port for the poet’s hope that his relationship with Varuṇa can be repaired.Verse 6 needs to be read in the context of X.10, the famous dialogue between Yama and his twin sister Yamī, but also of X.13.4, another cryptic verse about Yama in this cycle of hymns. In X.10, as is well known, Yama and Yamī argue about her desire to have sex with him in order to produce offspring. He strongly resists, condemning (X.10.2) their possible pairing by characterizing it with the phrase also quoted in 6b of this hymn: sa﻿́lakṣmā ya﻿́d víṣurūpā bha﻿́vāti, “that (the female) will have the same ‘marks’ [=family characteristics] (though) dissimilar form [=gender]” in our rendering. This phrase has received many different inter-pretations; we believe that it defines the forbidden incestuous partner Yamī as being of the same family but of a different shape—female rather than male—as Yama. The dialogue of X.10 ends with the issue unresolved. It is X.13.4 that seems to give us the answer. In that verse Yama “chose death” for the sake of the gods and for the sake of offspring “did not choose immortality.” It seems that Yama was born immortal (see esp. I.83.5) but chose to forego this state, in order to produce children and also to institute the sacrifice to the gods. This act of self-abnegation and the change of state it produced is, in our view, what is being celebrated in verse 6 here. The poet first (pāda a) mentions Yama’s “immortal (name),” which he does not want to think about—since it reminds him of the taint of incest (pāda b), but his other name, by implication the “mortal” one, is a happy one to think about and ensures Agni’s protection for the thinker. (Note that the actual name Yama is only mentioned in the second instance.)In the next verse (7) we move to the seat of Vivasvant, a common kenning for the ritual ground, but in this context it is important to remember that Yama is a descen-dant of Vivasvant (see his patronymic in, e.g., nearby X.14.1 vaivasvatám . . . yamám). The juxtaposition of Yama in verse 6 and Vivasvant in verse 7 reminds the audience that Yama chose death in order to institute the sacrifice, and further reminds them that when they perform sacrifice they are replicating the actions of Yama, which transformed his bad reputation (“name difficult to contemplate”) into a good one. Thus, though we still have no idea why the gods do what they do (see 7ab, 8ab), we trust in the power of our sacrifice to make things right with these inscrutable gods.1. Heaven and Earth, who speak what is real, become the first to hear in accordance with truth,when the god, setting mortals to sacrifice, takes his seat as Hotar facing (them), as he comes to his own life.2.

Although the carts are not explicitly mentioned in the hymn, this assignment is undoubtedly correct and confirmed by the recitation of the first two verses in the later canonical rit-ual when the carts are pushed into place. The first four verses are also found in"},{"pageNumber":1405,"pageContent":"X.131388Atharvaveda (Śaunaka) XVIII.38–41 (in slightly different order) in a large collec-tion of funeral verses, while verse 5 is paralleled by Atharvaveda VII.57.2. The hymn presents a number of difficulties, and the conceptual relationship among the verses is not always clear. Nonetheless, for various reasons (to be sketched below) it seems likely that the R̥gvedic hymn forms a unity.The first two verses are the clearest and have the clearest ritual content: the two soma carts are hitched up, the signal for the sacrifice is given, and the carts are brought to the sacrificial ground.After these two verses of relative clarity, we are plunged into the numerological obscurity of verse 3—not surprisingly the middle verse with the typical form of an omphalos verse. (Oldenberg refers to its “vague mysticism” [vage Mystik] and sug-gests resignation as a proper response for the interpreter [1913: 135 = 1967: 822].) It does not help that the first, scene-setting pāda contains the impossible word rúp, which arouses the same bewilderment in its other occurrence, IV.5.7. Nonetheless, we can sketch some parameters for the interpretation of the verse, though our inter-pretation is quite insecure in detail. First, it seems to continue the ritual scenario of the first two verses, and the 1st-person speaker, with his four 1st-person verbs, matches the speaker of the first pāda of the hymn. In the first pāda of this verse we suggest (following an offhand suggestion of Oldenberg’s [1913: 136 = 1967: 823]) that the “five steps” (páñca padā́ni) of the rúp (here translated “mount”) are the five verses of this very hymn. The “four-footed” (cátuṣpadī) entity in the next verse must be feminine in gender, and various suggestions have been made for what noun to supply. We believe that its reference is deliberately ambiguous: it may refer to the four pādas of a verse (ŕ̥c fem.), thus continuing the (possible) theme of 3a. It has also been suggested that the noun is vartaní “course, track” (also feminine), and the speaker is literally following the track of the two soma carts, each with two wheels, thus four wheel-ruts altogether. The only other R̥gvedic occurrence of the adjective “four-footed” is in I.164.41, where it modifies the noun gaurī́ “buffalo cow” refer-ring to Speech, which is regularly said to consist of four parts. Thus in our view this pāda refers both to ritual action (following the four wheel-ruts of the carts) and ritual speech (the four-pāda verse), and ritual speech in particular calls to mind Speech in general. In the next pāda (3c) the poet seems to make explicit the equiva-lence of his particular ritual speech and Speech in general by claiming to make a single syllable the equivalent of Speech herself. This mystical treatment of the ritual ends with a purification (3d).Verse 4 veers off in a different direction and alludes obliquely to what we might call the Felix Culpa (“fortunate fall”) of Yama, who, though born immortal (at least according to I.83.5 and possibly X.17.1), chose death over immortality in order to sacrifice to the gods (pāda a) and produce offspring (pādas b and d), whereas the gods constituted their sacrifice through Br̥haspati and avoided death but also do not reproduce. (So, roughly, Geldner.) This fleeting reference to Yama’s choice seems to answer the question left hanging at the end of X.10—will Yama yield to Yamī’s frenzied entreaties for sex or will he maintain his ascetic distance? On the basis of"},{"pageNumber":1406,"pageContent":"X.131389the offspring mentioned here, he seems to have yielded, though in the present verse the role of Yamī has been elided and the agency rests with Yama—he “chose.”But why, one may well ask, is this bit of Yama’s history found in a hymn dedi-cated to the soma carts? It is probably more productive to ask why a hymn to the soma carts is found in this Yama cycle (X.10–19), positioned right before the funeral hymns, especially X.14 dedicated to Yama. First, remember that the Atharvaveda repetitions of the first four verses of this hymn are found in the collection of funeral verses, so to the compilers of the Atharvaveda they must have seemed appropriate to a funeral context. Note, moreover, that the carts themselves are called “twins” (yamé) in verse 2, paired with verse 4 around the omphalos verse 3; “twins” of course calls to mind the twin couple Yama and Yamī. The pairing of the two carts also reminds us of the two divergent paths, one leading to the gods (devayā́na), one to the ancestors or forefathers (pitr̥yā́na); the latter is the one that the dead follow to the world where Yama presides. This journey is a particular preoccupation of the funeral hymns, and the conflation of the twin (yame﻿́) soma carts with the twin paths, one of which leads to Yama, may explain how the soma carts ended up in the Yama collection.The final verse brings the hymn full circle, but with a series of tricks embedded in it. On the surface the last half of the verse returns to the ritual situation and the soma carts, which take their places (yatete) with the same phraseology as verse 2 (yátamāne). They rule over and thrive on “it” of both kinds, most likely a reference to both pure and mixed soma (cf., e.g., VIII.101.10). But the lack of explicit refer-ents for any of the forms of “both,” combined with the first half of the verse, which has nothing obvious to do with the carts, invites us to look further. The first half of the verse seems to draw the same contrast as in verse 4 between gods and mortals. While the referent in pāda a is fairly clearly Indra (the epithet “accompanied by the Maruts” being a strong clue), we are inclined to see Yama as the referent in pāda b; he who surrendered his immortality for the sake of offspring is identified as a father in conjunction with sons, in fact the mortals whom he sired after he chose death. We, the poets and sacrificers, are among these sons, and have learned our verbal craft (“have made truth [our] familiar”) and produced this poem.If we are correct in our identification of Yama as the father in 5b, there are several further implications for the structure and contents of this hymn. On the one hand, the father and sons of 5b both recall and contrast with “all the sons of the immortal one” in 1c, for those were the gods. So we have another element of a formal ring structure, but with a different referent. The contrastive pairs Indra/Yama and gods/mortals may also underlie the insistent “both/both kinds” of the second half of verse 5, where (despite the neuter [or feminine] gender of the repeated subject ubhé “both”) Indra and Yama may be credited with joint ruler-ship (note that Yama is called “king” in the first verse of the next hymn, X.14.1d) and prosperity.To sum up and indeed to go further, this hymn, and the hymn cycle within which it is embedded, are a reflection of and a reflection on the dualities that define"},{"pageNumber":1407,"pageContent":"X.141390human existence: mortal and immortal, male and female, heaven and earth, sacred and profane, as we pointed out in the introduction to the Yama cycle as a whole. These dualities are neatly conceptually symbolized in the notion of twins, the pri-mal twins Yama and Yamī, and in this hymn also ritually symbolized by the twin soma carts, appropriate both to the sacrifice and to the divergent paths that lead to the gods and the ancestors respectively, thus providing a proper preface to the funeral hymns that follow.1.

Verses 1–6 offer praise to Yama as the pathfinder to the ancestral world (vss. 1–2) and then invite him to attend our sacrifice along"},{"pageNumber":1408,"pageContent":"X.141391with others, both gods and ancestors—suggesting implicitly that the pitr̥yā́na is a two-way street. It is also noteworthy that, though the gods and the forefathers respond to slightly different variants of the ritual cry (vs. 3: svā́hā for the gods versus svadhā́ for the forefathers), the mechanisms for the sacrifice to gods and fore-fathers are presented as more or less identical in this section and in verses 13–16, and in particular Yama is offered soma. See also the next hymn, X.15.Verses 7–12 concern not this age-old death but a recent one. A newly dead man is addressed and urged to follow the same path, to join Yama and the ancestors in highest heaven and even to reunite with the body from which he has been temporar-ily separated (vss. 7–8). Potential troublemakers along the way are dismissed (vs. 9), and the dead man is escorted by the two formidable guardian dogs of Yama (vss. 10–12).The last four verses (13–16) are in dimeter meter (save for 15c), instead of the triṣṭubh of the rest of the hymn. The first three are simple exhortations to perform sacrifice to Yama; the final verse (16) is by contrast quite opaque, with some of the typical marks of obscurity: unidentified referents (pādas a and b), numerology (pāda b), and manipulation of names of meters (pāda c). In particular, pāda b pres-ents us with six broad feminine entities and one lofty neuter one. (The contrasting grammatical genders so obvious in the Sanskrit are not easily rendered in transla-tion.) The six broad feminines are generally considered to be worlds or realms (on the basis of VI.47.3, which, however, doesn’t have an overt referent either), and the lofty neuter some other superior type of space. Given the extreme uncertainty of the referents, the syntax (should pāda b be construed with pāda a, or with cd, or, as we have done, connected neither to what precedes nor what follows?), and the reason for the presence of this verse as the finale of this hymn, we have chosen to leave the meaning open.1.

They are repeatedly urged to sit on the ritual grass, to partake of the offerings, including soma, and to provide us with material and spiritual benefits in return. The language is quite straightforward, with very few verbal tricks. Only in verse 3 do we encounter a turn of phrase that invites our inquiry: in the first half of the verse “I” find not only the forefathers on the ritual ground but also “the grandson/child” (nápāt) and the “stride of Viṣṇu.” The “grandson” may be a reference to Agni, often called “child of strength” (ū́rjo nápāt) and also frequently identified with the “Child of the Waters” (Apām Napāt), but it may also and simultaneously refer to the various descendants of the returning forefathers, descendants who would be present at the ritual and serving at it. As for Viṣṇu’s wide stride, most commentators take this as the highest heaven, that is, the last of Viṣṇu’s three strides. But it is hard to understand how this would be found “here”; we think rather that it refers to Viṣṇu’s first stride, which measures out the earth, and in this case that it is a specific reference to the delineated sacrificial space.Toward the end of the hymn, the god Agni becomes prominent (vss. 9–14) and his special relationship with the forefathers—as their cremation fire—is alluded to (esp. vss. 11, 14).1. Let the nearer ones rise up, up the further, up those in the middle—the forefathers deserving of soma.Those who have gone to (their next) life avoiding the wolf, knowing the truth, let those forefathers help us at the invocations.2.

This fire is seen both as a blessed release of the dead man"},{"pageNumber":1412,"pageContent":"X.161395to the realm of the ancestors and as a menace to the vulnerable dead body. This ambivalence is clearly on display in the first verse, where the fire is begged not to burn up the body, but, on the other hand, to make the dead man “cooked” and ready to go to the forefathers. The same sentiment is repeated in verse 2, and the journey undertaken. The dead body itself is addressed in verse 3, with its parts consigned to the corresponding cosmic entities. Two more verses to Agni follow (4–5), continuing the themes of verses 1–2. In verses 6–7 the body is addressed again: in verse 6 it is reassured that the physical indignities it has undergone since death will be fixed by the cremation fire and by soma, but in verse 7 it is urged to protect itself against the same fire. The cremation seems to end with verse 8.With the cremation concluded, the next verses (9–12) treat the inauspicious but powerful cremation fire and the means to render it harmless and to reintegrate it into the generally auspicious sphere of fire. The “flesh-eating fire” is first explicitly distinguished from “the other” fire, the ritual fire that receives the oblations to the gods, and the flesh-eating fire is assigned the task of taking the sacrifice to the ancestors and bringing them to the sacrifice here. Since this task is parallel to that of the other fire, the gods’ ritual mediator, the negative aspects of the flesh-eating fire can be set aside, and it can be conceptually reconfigured as a positive force, a transformation completed in verse 12.In the final two verses (13–14) the place where the cremation took place returns to nature, with the fire extinguished and plants growing again. The import of the final apostrophe to a cool and chilly feminine entity is clear, even though the refer-ent (a water plant?) is not.1. Don’t burn him through, Agni; don’t scorch him; don’t singe his skin, nor his body.When you will make him cooked to readiness, Jātavedas, then impel him forth to the forefathers.2.

All this is fairly clearly set out in the first verse: it opens with a Svayaṃvara (“self-choice marriage”) invitation issued by the father for his daughter, to which the whole world responds (1ab), and the second half (1cd) appears to summarize the results of that marriage—the husband chosen apparently being Vivasvant, and the child issuing from the marriage apparently being Yama. (It should be noted, though, that the identity of Tvaṣṭar’s daughter [1a] with the mother of Yama [1c] and wife of Vivasvant [1d] is only implicit from context, not expressly stated, and her name is not given in vs. 1.) The only disquieting part of this verse comes with the last word: “she disappeared” (nanāśa). This word sets the stage for its companion verse.The second verse considerably muddies the clean lines of our initial family tree. It turns out that the vanished woman of verse 1 was actually hidden away (2a) by an unnamed set of individuals—perhaps the gods, who create and pass off on (the unsuspecting?) Vivasvant a simulacrum of his wife (2b). In the second half of the verse the neat maternal line of 1c is likewise made obscure: someone (the origi-nal woman? the simulacrum?) bears the Aśvins (2c), and she (or the other female) leaves behind (abandons? leaves as a legacy?) two unnamed paired ones (2d). Yama, the son in 1c, is not mentioned by name, but he may lurk as part of the two in 2d (Yama and Yamī? Yama and Manu?), who could on the other hand be the afore-mentioned Aśvins. Each of these possibilities has had its scholarly champions (and it has in fact also been argued that 2d refers to two pairs, that is four in all). The last word of verse 2 is the feminine name Saraṇyū (lit., “hastening”), seeming to identify our protagonist, but the name provides little help, and could, in principle, belong to either the original or the duplicate woman.All in all, the two verses seem deliberately and cleverly designed to mislead and confuse, and in that they have admirably succeeded, beginning with the retellings of the story in the later Vedic tradition and continuing to this day. The myth has also often been invoked in a comparative Indo-European context. (For a recent discus-sion of the history of scholarship and for his own Indo-European interpretation, see Jackson 2006: Part II: esp. 72–93.) This is not the place to produce a full treat-ment of the myth behind the verses or its various interpretations; suffice it to say that we are inclined to see the paired two in 2d as Yama and Yamī, in part because a connection with Yama’s history is the only way to make sense of the inclusion of these verses here.The relevance of the next set of verses (4–6), to Pūṣan, is considerably clearer. Pūṣan as the good guide and finder of lost livestock makes an excellent psycho-pomp, leading the dead along the dangerous path to the next world.The goddess, and river, Sarasvatī is addressed in the next three verses (7–9), with a final verse (10) to the Waters in general. Sarasvatī here seems especially connected with the dead forefathers and the offerings to them at the ritual (esp. vss. 8–9); this may be an early foreshadowing of the later ritual offering of water to the dead, or, as verse 10 suggests, connected with the general purificatory power of waters (see X.9.6–9 earlier in this maṇḍala)."},{"pageNumber":1415,"pageContent":"X.171398Verses 10–13 concern the “drop” (drapsá) and are addressed in the 2nd person to Soma, who is never named but clearly identifiable from his characteristic vocabu-lary.

The first six verses depict the mourners leaving the service and returning to their lives. Death is dismissed in verse 1, and in verses 2–3 the living turn back to an enhanced life, full of “dancing and laughter” (vs. 3). They are separated from death by a barrier (vs. 4); in the later ritual a stone is set down near the grave. Verses 5–6 are especially concerned with the orderly sequence of life and death, in particular the fear that the younger will die before their elders and disrupt the proper sequence (see esp. 5cd).The next three verses (7–9) have been much discussed, especially in the context of “suttee” (satī) or widow-burning, though the verses are emphatically not a depic-tion thereof. From verse 8 it appears that the widow lies down, temporarily, beside her dead husband, but is summoned back to life and indeed symbolically reborn to become the wife of a new husband (quite possibly her brother-in-law, in levirate marriage). The happy women in verse 7 apparently approach the funeral pyre to adorn the widow for her return to life. A similar “return to life” is granted the dead man’s bow in verse 9, where someone, quite possibly the dead man’s son, repossesses the bow to put it to future use."},{"pageNumber":1417,"pageContent":"X.181400The burial is the subject of verses 10–13, with an emphasis on the softness and gentleness of the welcoming earth, both mother and bride, which lies lightly on the dead man. Verse 13 forms a sort of ring with verse 1, with both expressing a prohibition against harm with the same construction and the same root √riṣ (1d mā́ . . . rīriṣaḥ, 13b mā́ . . . riṣam). This ring defines the final verse (14) as outside the hymn proper, and other indications support this extra-hymnic status. It is in dimeter meter, instead of the trimeter that prevails elsewhere, and the Aśvalāyana Gr̥hya Sūtra, which treats the ritual usage of all the other verses, ignores it, as does the medieval commentator Sāyaṇa. The sense of this verse is also much disputed. Many scholars think that the poet is predicting his own future death, on a day that is approaching him, in the first hemistich, and in the second he restrains his speech in anticipation. (As Geldner says, rather more dramatically than usual, “der Rest ist Schweigen” [the rest is silence].) In contrast, we consider this to belong to the typi-cal genre of hymn-final meta-poetic verses, in which the poet comments on his own skill in producing the poem that precedes. By this interpretation, the first half-verse concerns the well-conducted funeral that has just taken place, while the second refers specifically to the poet’s taming and controlling the speech that accompanied that ritual.1. Depart, Death, along the further path, which is your own, different from the one leading to the gods.To you who possess eyes and who listen do I speak: do not harm our offspring nor our heroes.2. Effacing the footprint of death when you have gone, establishing for yourselves a longer, more extended lifetime,swelling up with offspring and wealth, become cleansed and purified, o you who are worthy of the sacrifice.3. These the living have turned aside from the dead. The invocation of the gods has become favorable for us today.We have gone facing forward to dancing, to laughter, establishing for ourselves a longer, more extended lifetime.4. I set down this barrier here for the living. Let no one of these later go to this goal.Let them live for a hundred ample autumns. Let them conceal death with a mountain.5. Just as the days follow each upon the last, just as the seasons follow straightaway upon the seasons,so, o Ordainer, arrange their lifetimes, so that the later does not leave behind the earlier.6.

The signature idiom in this hymn is “turn back,” and perhaps it was attached to the Yama cycle on thematic grounds, because the first verses of the preceding hymn, X.18, concern the return to life of the living after the funeral of their dead kinsman (see esp.

The patronymic of the latter choice would identify the poet as a son or descendant of Vasukra Aindra, the author of the three desperately difficult hymns that immediately follow (27–29). The poet of X.25.11 also identifies with or identifies himself as Kakṣīvant, the very skilled poet of I.116–126.Whatever the poet’s affiliation, he is fond of unusual meters (see esp. 21, 22, 24, 25) as well as puns on the name Vimada. The hymns are dedicated to Agni (20–21), Indra (22–1st half of 24), the Aśvins (2nd half of 24), Soma (25), and Pūṣan (26).X.20 (846) AgniVimada Aindra or Vimada Prājāpatya, or Vasukr̥t Vāsukra10 verses: gāyatrī, except ekapadāvirāj 1, anuṣṭubh 2, virāj 9, triṣṭubh 10This first of the Vimada hymns starts with a single-pāda verse adapted from the first verse of X.25 and placed here to provide an auspicious beginning for the series. The second verse has a similarly marked beginning: its first two words are identical to the first words of the R̥gveda, I.1.1 agním īḷe “I invoke Agni. . . . ” The hymn mostly treats the familiar topic of the physical presence of the ritual fire, though with some strik-ing imagery and turns of phrase.

He takes pleasure in the oblations of the son of Manu. The craftsman stands erect at the sacrifice.Fixing his seat, he goes in front.6. For he is peaceful dwelling, oblation, and sacrifice.

The meter āstārapaṅkti (8 8 / 8 4 8 4) is limited to this group of hymns attributed to Vimada, providing the meter for the two hymns X.21 and X.25 and the first half (vss. 1–3) of X.24. (The Anukramaṇī identifies the meter of the single verse X.170.4"},{"pageNumber":1421,"pageContent":"X.211404as āstārapaṅkti, but the characteristic 8 4 8 4 sequence must be read as 12 12 there.) In all the Vimada occurrences the two four-syllable pādas form a grammatically unified refrain (the same refrain in all three hymns), interrupted by an eight-syllable pāda semantically and syntactically integrated into the rest of the verse: ví vo máde x x x x x x x x vívakṣase “In my exhilaration I wish to acclaim you (gods).” The first four-syllable pāda of the refrain is also a pun on the poet’s name: ví vo máde, literally “in exhilaration you . . . ,” but also “Vi . . . mada” (itself interrupted by the enclitic pronoun vaḥ). Although the effect is striking and insistent, it is also impos-sible to render in translation, and so the refrain has been unified and placed at the end of the verse. To illustrate the difficulties of a literal translation, we will give a rendering of the first verse in this hymn in that style:As if with (hymns) with their own twists, we choose you, Agni, as Hotarfor our sacrifice whose ritual grass has been strewn—in exhilaration you (gods)—(we choose you,) sharp and pure-flamed—I wish to acclaim.The formal novelty of the hymn is not matched by its content, which is simply a typical celebration of Agni’s installation as Hotar at his kindling, along with wishes for his gifts of wealth.1. As if with (hymns) with their own twists, we choose you, Agni, as Hotarfor our sacrifice whose ritual grass has been strewn, (you,) sharp and pure-flamed.– In my exhilaration I wish to acclaim you (gods).2.

Like many hymns whose meter is irregu-lar, this one is driven more by phraseology, verbal echoes, and lexical chaining than by meter. The responsion and chaining begin with the first two verses, which consist of a rhetorical question about Indra’s fame (vs. 1) and its answer (vs. 2).The general praises of Indra continue in the next two verses, but shade, in verse 4, into the myth (or fragments of myth) that occupy most of the rest of the hymn: the journey of Indra and his client Kutsa (unnamed here) to the house of Uśanā (Kāvya) with the horses of the Wind (vss. 4–6), the plea to Indra to smite the demon Śuṣṇa (7–9), and the actual slaying of Śuṣṇa and its aftermath (vss. 10–11, 14), with several verses interspersed (12–13) begging Indra for aid and comfort. (These may belong to the Śuṣṇa saga and represent the speech of the same “we” who asked Indra to kill the demon in vss. 7–9, but they can also be generalized to the current “we” of singers and patrons.)Although there are many puzzles in these mythological verses, the real crux is the pair concerning (apparently) the slaying of Śuṣṇa, verses 10–11, which contain sev-eral well-nigh-impenetrable hapaxes and whose syntax is in places unparsable. Verse 10, especially, may be deemed impossible, and its translation is therefore provisional and differs radically from others’ interpretations. We believe that it contains a badly remembered and garbled allusion to an inherited Indo-Iranian mythic complex. The hapax kārpāṇé, which others interpret as “in the sword-combat” (relating it to a much later attested word kr̥pāṇa “sword”), we connect with the Avestan word karapan (read disyllabically in the Gāthās), the designation of a person or persons hostile to the Mazdayasnian religion and associated with equally hostile kauuis"},{"pageNumber":1423,"pageContent":"X.221406(e.g., Yasna 44.20, Yasna 32.12, 14–15, Yasna 46.11)—just as our kārpāṇé occurs in a verse with unidentified (and, as it happens, syntactically untethered) kavis. In the topsy-turvy religious system of the Gāthās, of course, entities viewed positively in the R̥gveda (like kavis) have negative valuation. This is not the place to explore this hypothesis in detail, but for another apparent manifestation of this myth, see X.99.9, and for further discussion see Jamison (2009d [2013]).The hymn ends with an impeccable triṣṭubh verse (15), containing a conven-tional invitation to Indra to drink the soma and conventional wishes for his good will and patronage.1. Where is Indra famous? Among what people is he famed today like an ally among the people?—he who, whether in the dwelling place of the seers or in concealment, is constantly celebrated in song.2. Here is Indra famed. Among us today he is praised as the wielder of the mace, equal to song—he who like an ally among the peoples has made glory for himself among the peoples, not by halves;3. He who is the lord of great strength, not by halves, and of great manliness, the thruster,the bearer of the bold mace, like a father (of) his dear son.4. As the one having yoked the two boisterous horses of the Wind, as god (having yoked those) of the god, o wielder of the mace,as the one who streams along the radiant path when set loose along the highways, he is praised.5. You have come to just these two horses of the Wind, the silvery ones, to drive them by yourself,those for which no god nor mortal can be found as controller.6. Then Uśanā asks you both [=Indra and Kutsa] on your coming, “With what purpose (have you come) to our house?You have come from afar, from heaven and earth, to a mortal.”7. You will ask for us, for our upraised sacred formulation, Indra.We (in return) beg you for this help, that you smite Śuṣṇa, the non-man.8. The Dasyu of non-deeds, of non-thought, the non-man whose commandments are other, is against us.You smasher of non-allies, humble the weapon of this Dāsa.9.

The praise of Indra that follows is fairly conventional; we hear of his mace (vss. 1, 3), his pair of fallow bays (vss. 1–3), and, less usually, his beard (vss. 1, 3). He is portrayed, in contrastive but complementary fashion, as at once warrior and generous and paternal patron (see, e.g., vss. 1d, 2b, 5).The final two verses (6–7) mention the poet Vimada (7b) and his family (6a), and both verses feature prominently the verb vidmā́ “we know,” a partial anagram of this name. Indra’s name is also played upon, in the adjective iná “strong” (6c), and possibly, earlier in the hymn, by the presence of several pleonastic occurrences of the particle íd (3a, 4d). In the same spirit, the frequent occurrence of the pre-verb/particle ví seems designed to recall the Vimada name. This punning is more subtle and varied than that found in the Vimada hymns with the repeated catch-word refrain ví vo máde . . . vívakṣase (X.21, 24.1–3, 25). Thus, though the contents of the praise are conventional, the playful phonological complexity gives texture to the poem.1. We sacrifice to Indra with the mace in his right hand, the charioteer of the fallow bays who follow separate commandments.He stands erect, constantly shaking out his beard, while apportioning (goods) by virtue of his weapons, by virtue of his generosity."},{"pageNumber":1425,"pageContent":"X.2414082.

The first three verses, to Indra, contain the Vimada refrain. (For a discussion of its structure see the introduction to X.21.) The poet straightforwardly asks for goods and aid from the god in return for the soma offered to him.The second three verses, to the Aśvins, allude to an otherwise unknown or little-known myth in which these gods churn out a pair of females (which may or may not be magical fire-churning sticks), which fly away to the gods’ disappoint-ment; the gods ask the Aśvins to return them (vss. 4–5).

In fact, there is almost no acknowledgement that soma is a ritual substance at all: just the phrase “the fellow-ship of the stalk” in verse 1, the identification of Soma as máda “exhilarating” in verse 10, and the refrain beginning “in . . . exhilaration” (ví . . . máde), itself a pun on the name of the poet Vimada (see introduction to X.21).The Soma of this hymn is predominately a protector, benevolently forgiving childish transgressions on our part (vs. 3), watching over our possessions and our-selves (vss. 6–7), and guarding us from external threats (vss. 3, 7–10), as well as helping us cultivate our best qualities (vss. 1, 4). This Soma also presides over the distribution of desirable things, probably in the form of the priestly gift or dakṣiṇā. This aspect of Soma is first hinted at in verse 2, developed in verse 5, and trium-phantly proclaimed in the final verse, 11.The hymn contains some curious turns of phrase and slanted imagery, and so the mention of the great Ist Maṇḍala poet Kakṣīvant in verse 10 is not"},{"pageNumber":1427,"pageContent":"X.251410altogether surprising. It is unclear whether the poet of this hymn is simply claim-ing Kakṣ īvant’s mantle or whether there is a family connection or even identity with Kakṣīvant.The least clear part of the hymn is the second part of the final verse (11), where it is claimed that Soma will help the blind and the halt “for the seven.” Soma’s aid to the disabled is expressed in similar terms in VIII.79.2, another Soma hymn found outside of IX, but the identity of “the seven” in our verse is disputed, and the poet seems to have wanted to leave it open.1.

See especially verse 6, whose language and intent are almost entirely obscure.The general themes are Pūṣan’s reciprocal relationship with inspired poets and their thoughts (see vss. 1–2, 4–5) and his role as companion and friend (see vss. 2, 5–8).1.

In general and in its many particulars it has received a number of compet-ing and conflicting treatments. We will restrict ourselves to presenting our own, often tentative, interpretation, without discussion of other possibilities that have been advanced.First of all, in our opinion the hymn falls into two complementary units, verses 1–12 and 13–24, with the former subdivided into verses 1–7, 8–10, and 11–12 and the latter into verses 13–18 and 19–24. The overall theme of the whole hymn is the proper reciprocal relationship between men and gods, especially Indra, as symbol-ized by the sacrifice, and the proper functioning of the cosmos that this mutual rela-tionship ensures. But this theme is treated in distinct ways in the course of the hymn.The first half is primarily in dialogue between Indra and the singer. In it Indra contrasts the aid he gives to sacrificers with the destruction he metes out to non-sacrificers (vss. 1, 4), and the singer echoes Indra’s contrastive pairing by announcing his intention to offer to Indra, as opposed to the self-aggrandizing atheists (vs. 2). Indra is somewhat skeptical of the singer’s intent (vs. 3): he suggests that men sacrifice to him only when they need his help (3cd), but after he has helped them win, they forget to offer to him (3ab). Indra continues boasting about his pow-ers (vs. 5), perhaps taken up by the singer (or still in the mouth of Indra himself; vs. 6), promising destruction to non-sacrificers. The singer’s glorification of Indra’s powers and the devastation he will produce ends this section (vs. 7).The contrast between followers of Indra and their opposites is continued by another image in the next verses, the metaphor of lost and straying livestock. In verse 8 cows are wandering loose, grazing in the pasture of a stranger, though accompanied by a cowherd. In our view the cows stand for men, turning away from"},{"pageNumber":1430,"pageContent":"X.271413devotion to “their own lord,” Indra, to follow other ways and other leaders. In verse 9 Indra promises to reassemble his lost herd and reestablish proper relation-ships among them. The first half of verse 10 has the sound of a truth formulation, again announcing the reassembling of the herd, with the second half of the verse expressing the consequences for his weakened enemies, using the striking image of these enemies fighting Indra “with women,” a phrase used elsewhere of about-to-be-defeated opponents (V.30.9; cf. I.104.3).The mention of women in verse 10 may have prompted the coda verses 11–12, which treat the legal issue of the flawed woman given in marriage, known also from the later dharma literature (cf. Mānava Dharma Śāstra IX.72–73, VIII.205, 224). According to Manu a father is culpable if he tries to marry off a physically or mentally flawed girl without declaring her faults in advance, but if he has informed the bridegroom before the marriage, the latter has no legal recourse. Here verse 10 contrasts the suitor of a blind girl who knows she is blind (ab), with one who was tricked into marriage without that knowledge and who therefore has the right to deploy mení “the power of thwarted exchange.” (For further discussion, see Jamison 1996b.) Verse 12 presents the opposite picture of an unflawed and happy bride, embodying the appropriate and successful functioning of the exchange rela-tions that characterize Ārya society.Thus, though this first half of X.27 utilizes three dominant images—sacrificers versus non-sacrificers, a unified herd following its herdsman versus dispersed and straying livestock, and a properly contracted marriage versus one that involves fraud and deception—all three contrast proper social relationships with aberrant ones, and warn of the consequences of the latterThe second half of the hymn seems superficially to have nothing to do with what went before, but viewed in the larger context it can be seen to pick up the first and most important image, that of sacrifice as the binding relationship between men and gods, and to develop it. The first six verses of this half (vss. 13–18) deal, in our view, with the creation of the sacrifice and the mystery of its central focus, the fire. This section begins with two riddling verses (13–14) identifying the fire without naming it: verse 13 of the already kindled fire and verse 14 of its creation by the “lofty steed” without shadow or foliage, probably the fire-churning spindle (later pramantha), and the mother, probably the lower fire stick (aráṇī) with a hole in which the spindle is turned and from which the “embryo,” the fire itself, emerges. The second half of this verse describes the oblation, conceived of as a cow, “lick-ing the calf (that is, the fire) of another (that is, the fire stick)” when poured into the fire. The creation of the fire is also treated in verse 16, with much of the same lexicon, but with the addition of the ten fingers, which manipulate the fire-making apparatus.In between is an enigmatic verse (15) about unidentified but numerically pre-cise groups coming from different directions. In our view this treats the original establishment of the sacrifice through the cooperation of various prototypical Ārya communities (perhaps including the Seven Seers, the Navagvas, and the Daśagvas)."},{"pageNumber":1431,"pageContent":"X.271414This theme is continued, though somewhat enigmatically, in verse 17, but in verse 18 there is schism: two groups go off in opposite directions and follow opposite cus-toms, cooking versus non-cooking. It is the cooks and their fire who are predicted to prevail. With this we return to the stark divisions of the first half of the hymn between sacrificers and non-sacrificers. The split depicted in verse 18 also reminds us of the fuller treatment of sacrificial schism in I.33.4–10.If the first eighteen verses of this hymn are fiendishly difficult, the last six (19–24) might properly be termed impossible—not so much because of their grammar, but because of the rare words, the obscurity of the references, and the unclarity of the relationships of the verses to each other and to the rest of the hymn. The interpretation that follows is even more tentative than what has pre-ceded. The first two verses of this section (19–20) seem to be riddles turning on astronomical or temporal references. The first may refer to the year and its com-ponent parts (“the horde”) turning by itself and regularly bringing an end to the mortal generations while renewing itself. The “two oxen of the Pulverizer” (death or old age?) in verse 20 could perhaps be another temporal reference, to night and day as similarly measuring out the lifespan of humans, beneath the eternal world of heaven and the heavenly bodies. This theme appears to be continued in the first half of the next verse (21), though what the “mace” (vájra) represents here is entirely unclear—perhaps the year or other temporal division as a weapon that smites mortals. The second half of this verse seems to offer a less bleak picture than the inevitable decay and destruction that temporal divisions bring in their train: there is “other fame,” to which old age can lead, though what that fame is or is based on is not stated.If we are correct, the implicit answer to this question is the sacrifice and its cen-ter, fire, and this answer is given obliquely in verse 22. Fire the substance is always potentially present, but not always actually present, and so it appears to defy the temporally defined progress to old age and death. Latent “within every tree,” it can burst forth at any time. It is frightening in some of its effects (the flames as “man-eating birds”) and strikes terror in all beings (pāda c), but is also the benevo-lent focus of sacrifice (pāda d). The original establishment of the sacrifice by the gods seems to be treated in verse 23, and in the thoroughly obscure last pāda of that verse Indra, unnamed, may come himself to the sacrifice for epiphany, thus returning us to the beginning of the hymn and the direct involvement of Indra with sacrificers.The last verse is no clearer than the preceding ones, though it seems to be announcing a final, instructive truth according to which one should lead one’s life. Perhaps the idea is that the sacrifice is the means to life, which connects one to the eternal world of heaven and the sun. The destructive temporal forces mentioned earlier (vss. 20–21) were “below the sun,” but in this final verse the sun reveals itself, hides the mist (if that’s what the phonologically problematic hapax busá means), and reaches its “foot” (a sunbeam going toward the ground?) out to be seen, thus providing a potential bond for the sacrificing mortal to the higher world. This shaft"},{"pageNumber":1432,"pageContent":"X.271415of light, liberated from its covering, that ends the hymn, seems an optimistic prom-ise to the addressee of better things than decay and death.But much of this is poorly supported speculation, and the hymn, especially the final verses of the hymn, invites further detailed investigation.1.

Like the first half of X.27, this hymn consists of a dialogue between Indra and a singer/sacrificer, introduced in this case by a verse spoken by the sacri-ficer’s wife (who then disappears from the hymn). The hymn is more tightly struc-tured than X.27, and it complements X.27 in another way: though the second half of X.27 is deliberately obscure and esoteric in its expression, X.28 presents itself (however misleadingly) as instruction to the simple, couched in straightforward language.The topic of the hymn, to be reductionist, is successful and unsuccessful sac-rifices, and the human participants in the dialogue seem to express anxiety about failing, perhaps by accident, to provide a sacrificial offering adequate to attract the gods, especially Indra. The hymn begins (vs. 1) with the sacrificer’s wife, who is"},{"pageNumber":1435,"pageContent":"X.281418also Indra’s daughter-in-law, anxiously noting Indra’s absence from the sacrifice. In verse 2 Indra responds that he protects those who provide him adequate soma; the singer (probably) replies, perhaps a bit testily, that not only do they press soma and cook bulls for Indra, but Indra does consume this provender (vs. 3).There follows an abrupt change of subject, or at least change of tone. Indra begins verse 4 with “Mark well this (speech) of mine, singer” and then alludes glancingly to what appear to be animal fables of the sort found in much later texts like the Pañcatantra. In verse 5 the mortal expresses doubt about his ability to understand the god because of his (the mortal’s) simple nature, but also expresses certainty that the god will enlighten him at the right time. The next three verses (6–8) we will take up below. The animal fables return in verses 9 and 10, while the last two verses (11–12) contrast greedy people, who consume what was destined for the sacrifice and thereby actually weaken themselves, with the hard-laboring sacrificers, who thrive.The hymn is thus structured in the following way: the outer verses (1–3, 11–12) concern successful and unsuccessful sacrifices and sacrificers, the opening verses being more personal, the final ones more general. Within this frame there is an inner ring of verses (4–5, 9–10), which establish a dialogue between mortal and god about this problem and which express the god’s teaching in the simple terms a mortal can understand, that is, in animal allegories briefly alluded to. This double ring of complementary verses thus surrounds and marks out the center of the hymn, verses 6–8, and especially the exact center of the twelve-verse hymn, verses 6–7. These two verses are also rhetorically responsive, and both their position and their structure define them as an omphalos. Furthermore, they are uttered directly after the singer has expressed certainty that Indra will proclaim his doctrine at the right time (vs. 5cd). Everything in the context seems to mark these verses as the direct teaching of Indra, his significant message—and, indeed, as his epiphany, the epiphany that was expected but not realized in verse 1. The vaunting self-praise in the omphalos verses contrasts strangely with the animal fable verses that form the inner ring around them, for in those the message seems to be rather that the weak can best the strong.The re-transition from the ātmastuti (“self-praise”) of the omphalos (vss. 6–7) to the animal fables (vss. 9–10) is effected by an even more enigmatic verse (8). Though it does not match any of the structurally paired verses of the rest of the hymn, it may carry the key to the whole, for it seems to treat the original establishment of the sacrifice, instituted first by the gods. This reminds us of the more elaborate treat-ment of the origins of the sacrifice in X.27.13–18 (esp. 15), and it also suggests that the sacrifice is the tool by which the weak (currently mortals) may control the strong (Indra and the gods), as in the animal fables that enclose the hymn’s center. Reached by way of a playful transition (vss. 10d, 11a), the final two verses (11–12) return us to the present day and the ritual situation, and remind us of the contrast between sacrificers and non-sacrificers in the first half of X.27, especially verses 2 and 7.A word about the animal verses. Despite the major importance of animal fables and allegories in later Sanskrit, there is essentially nothing like them in"},{"pageNumber":1436,"pageContent":"X.281419Vedic, especially early Vedic, and even the allusions to stories we have here—which are reminiscent of the summary verses of Pañcatantra tales—are unique in the R̥gveda. Keeping in mind that animal stories are not told in later Sanskrit simply to amuse, but are overtly instructive and educational, especially for cal-low and wayward youth, we can connect the use of these allusions in this hymn to the singer’s self-description as “a simple man,” incapable of understanding Indra’s message (vs. 5). Indra is tailoring his instruction to the mental abilities of his hearer: rather than express himself in the usual mysteries of R̥gvedic high style (as in the immediately preceding X.27), Indra packages his message in a series of beast fables. If this reading of the hymn’s general scenario is correct, then we must assume already for the R̥gvedic period not only the existence of a body of story literature, of animal fables, but also (more interestingly) a fairly organized functional role for this literature in an instructional setting, conform-ing to the same model that we find quite a bit later in Indic literature in general. And this in turn may lead us to reconsider the standard views of the history of Indian literature and especially the connections between Vedic and Classical genres.For further discussion of this hymn, see Jamison (2004a; 2007: 80–83; 2008b).1.

(See Jamison [forthcoming c].) Suffice it to say that the verse manages to refer, by indirection and implication, to the five most important gods at the dawn rit-ual: Agni, Indra, Vāyu, and the Aśvins, though only Indra is named. (Dawn is the sole important divinity absent, but she appears in the first pāda of the next verse.) Besides the common R̥gvedic habit of employing words applicable to two or more referents, the verse shows in embryo a device prized in later kāvya: that of allowing a single phonological sequence to be read in two of more different ways by means of variant word divisions. Add to this an unprecedented syntactic"},{"pageNumber":1438,"pageContent":"X.291421construction, which is also a syntactic pun, and dizziness ensues for the hearer/reader.The structure and thematic contents of the hymn are less clear than in X.27 and 28, however. After the first two extremely opaque verses, which appear to treat the dawn ritual and the divine conjunction of Indra and Agni (and probably of the two Aśvins), the poet turns his hopes and attention to attracting Indra to show himself at the sacrifice, to produce an epiphany (see esp. vs. 4), through properly performed offerings. There are a number of obscurities in these verses as well, especially verse 5, and the lack of a perceptible structure hampers our efforts to clarify them. Much remains to be excavated from this rich poetic mine.1. Whether he takes pleasure in the wood or not, he [=Agni] has been installed (as priest) [/been deposited (in the wood)].

In verses 1–3 the Adhvaryu priests are sent to fetch water for the soma-pressing, but first make an offering to the waters and the Child of the Waters (Apām Napāt). The Adhvaryus then bring the waters to the sacrificial ground (vss. 4–9), with a reminder that they (the waters) owe a favor to Indra, the principal drinker of soma, because he freed them (vs. 7). More praise of the waters follows (vss. 10–12) as they approach the place of sacrifice. They arrive in verses 13–14, and the pressing can begin in verse 15.The feminine and enthusiastically yielding nature of the waters (the stem áp being feminine in gender) and their relationship to various masculine forces, the Adhvaryus (vs. 2), Soma (vss. 5–6), and the gods (vs. 15), are also emphasized.1.

As in many such compositions, one of the major sources of obscurity is the uncertainty of the referents in many key verses and the possibility of multiple referents in such cases. The interpretation given here is ten-tative and uncertain, and even if correct, or partially so, it does not exclude other possible interpretations. In our view, the hymn speculates about the mystery of the sacrifice, about the relations between men and gods that the sacrifice encodes, and about Agni, the most conspicuous symbol of the sacrifice and the mortal–immortal partnership, as the foundational principle of the cosmos and the neutralization of the distinction between space and time. Although assigned to the All Gods, this is obviously not a conventional All God hymn (if such exist) but one for which the designation serves as a cover for mystic speculation. If it has a conventional deity, it is Agni.The hymn begins innocently enough with four verses establishing the ritual scene. However, even in the first verse we encounter something unusual: the raw material of the sacrifice seems to be seeking us out, as if the gods themselves were assisting us in our duties toward them. Nonetheless, verse 2 asserts that the mortal sacrifi-cer must exert his own inherent powers in order to perform a proper sacrifice and receive its benefits. The happy result of the mutual action of men and gods (note the latter are called “helpers” in 3b) is expressed in verse 3, and in verse 4 (particularly full of unidentified referents; see esp. pāda d) it seems that the central divine figure Agni is well pleased and that other gods have favored the sacrificer as well.Verses 5–6 are roughly the center of the hymn (especially since vs. 11 is a pseudo-dānastuti); they are verbally responsive (note the asyá beginning 5c, 6a, and 6c, for example), and they introduce a larger cosmic dimension to the depiction of the sacrifice. They thus qualify as an omphalos. Most important in these two verses are the three words for “earth” that knit them together: kṣā́ḥ in 5a, bhū́man in 6b, and, by implication, pr̥thvī́, disguised in the feminine participle paprathānā́ in 6a, derived from the same root (prath) as pr̥thvī́ in 9a. (The three words—kṣā́ḥ, bhū́man, and pr̥thvī́—are reunited again in vs. 9, a good indication that the conjunction in vss. 5–6 was deliberate.) This emphasis on the earth in a ritual context seems to make an implicit claim that the sacrificial ground is the earth. In verse 5 the sacrifi-cial context is more overt: this seems to concern the distribution of the dakṣiṇās or"},{"pageNumber":1442,"pageContent":"X.311425priestly gifts at dawn. Verse 6 is more opaque, but in our view refers to the benevo-lence of a well-pleased Agni radiating outward. The second half of verse 6 provides a transition to the cosmic speculations that follow: the “lord” of 6a seems still to be Agni, with his womb containing, on the one hand, his flames, and, on the other hand perhaps, the gods.The speculations of verses 7–10 begin, as often, with an unanswerable question about the origins of the cosmos. Verse 7 also contrasts the stable and unchanging quality of heaven and earth (space) with the ever-changing and aging aspect of time. This opposition in a way provides the framework for the next few verses, although the direct connection between 7 and what follows is superficially dim. However, if, as we believe, the next three verses (8–10) concern Agni, he partakes of both space and time, and provides the foundation for both. He supports heaven and earth (8b)—there is no reason to look elsewhere (8a)—but he is also in con-stant motion (8cd, 9ab) and appears in many guises (9cd). He thus grounds the stability of the spatial cosmos while being in constant motion through it. In the same way (vs. 10), temporal aging is represented by his regular rebirth, but because of the paradox that he is born before his parents, temporal advance is negated. The space/time conundrum is solved! The last clause of verse 10, “if they should inquire” / “when they shall ask,” is in our view the formal closure to the cosmic speculation opened by a question in verse 7 and not confined to the themes of verse 10.The final verse (11) has all the trappings of a dānastuti, appended to the hymn, but it seems to refer to a very obscure saga also encountered in I.117.8, an Aśvin hymn.1. Let the laud of the gods, the means of sacrifice, come in quest of us, to help us, along with all the overpowering ones [=gods].Might we come to have good fellowship with them. Might we be those who cross over all difficulties.2. A mortal should await material wealth along the path of truth; he should seek to win it through reverence.And he should consult with his own resolve and grasp better skill with his mind.3. The insightful thought has been set in place; the (sacrificial) portions have been sent surging. The helpers [=gods] come close to the wondrous one [=Agni] as if to a ford.We have attained the fortifying (hymn) for our good faring; we have become cognizant of the immortals.4. Our own constant lord and master of the house [=Agni?] should find pleasure (in him [=sacrificer?]) for whom the god Savitar has given birth,or Bhaga and Aryaman should anoint him with cows. That one seems beloved to him, and so he should be."},{"pageNumber":1443,"pageContent":"X.3214265. Might this earth here be like (the place) of the dawns. When the possessors of livestock [=gods? patrons?] have assembled here with their strength,desiring to partake of the praise of this singer, let the powerful prizes approach us.6. The good favor of just this one, spreading out, became the foremost cow throughout the land;in the womb of this lord are those of the same nest, being borne in the same burden.7. What was the wood, and what the tree from which they carved out heaven and earth,the two that stand together, unaging and enduring? But the days, the many dawns, grow old.8. There does not exist another of such kind beyond that. The ox bears heaven and earth.With a will of his own, he makes his skin into a purifier, when they convey him, as the tawny (horses) do the sun.9. Like a snake [?] , he passes over the wide earth; as wind (blows) away mist, he blows across the land,where, being anointed as Mitra and as Varuṇa, like a fire in the forest, he has let loose his flame.10. When the barren cow [=kindling stick] gave birth all at once as she was being driven/anointed, she, though faltering, did so unfalteringly, since she has her own herdsmen [=priests].When the son [=Agni] was born before his two parents [=kindling sticks], the cow [=lower stick] swallowed the peg [=upper stick]—if they should inquire.11.

The first five verses in jagatī are indeed Indra’s, but the last four verses (6–9) in triṣṭubh are more appropriate to Agni. However, these two parts fit together into a larger thematic whole."},{"pageNumber":1444,"pageContent":"X.321427The verses dedicated to Indra follow to some degree a conventional “journey” hymn trajectory: Indra’s pair of horses bring him to the sacrifice in verse 1, with the journey further described in verse 2. Verse 4 appears to concern the focal point of the sacrifice, the sacrificial ground or, more precisely, the fire altar, to which all the sacrificial participants and substances make their way. A two-way journey is fore-seen in verse 5, with Soma (if this identification is correct) on his way to the gods, and Indra and companion gods on the way to the sacrifice.Several features disturb this simplistic sketch of the hymn. First, the journey is also conceived of as a wedding journey; in addition to verse 3 (to be discussed) see especially the “wooers” in verse 1 and the bridal procession in verse 4. Moreover, the middle verse of this portion of the hymn, verse 3, has a pronounced omphalos char-acter. It announces itself as a wonder, and then produces three striking paradoxes: the son who knows his parents’ birth (pāda b), the wife who conveys her husband on the bridal journey (pāda c), and the same role reversal seen from the husband’s point of view, a bridal procession made for the man (pāda d). It is difficult to know exactly what to make of this, but it appears that Indra’s journey to the sacrifice is being imagined as the wedding journey of a bride. The hyper-virile Indra is in some sense filling the pas-sive role of bride—a fine conceit, though one that the poet does not over-emphasize.The focus on the “seat” in verse 4, quite possibly the hearth, as well as the first paradox of verse 3, the son who knows his parents’ birth, a typical Agni trope, turn our attention to that god in the second part of the hymn. The installation and kin-dling of the ritual fire are the subject, and the mythic model is the well-known tale of Agni’s flight, concealment in the waters, and recovery (vs. 6ab). The narrator owes his knowledge of this to Indra (6cd); in verse 7 he makes a general statement about the value of instruction for the uninitiated. This short sequence is reminiscent of nearby X.28, in which Indra acts as the instructor of the callow. Verse 8 returns to Agni and describes the kindling of a dormant fire. The enigmatic verse 9 presents itself as a sort of reverse dānastuti, though with the identity of the speakers being somewhat unclear.1. The two (horses) are come, those in the power of the one being conjured up by our insights [=Indra]—(they are come) to the wooers taking their seats in front along with (the other) wooers.Indra will find pleasure in both (offerings) of ours when he will take cognizance of the soma-stalk.2. O much-praised Indra, you drive across the heavenly luminous realms and across the earthly ones through the airy space.Those who convey you in an instant right up to the ceremonies, let them vanquish the ungenerous ones who chatter.3. Just this will appear to me as more wondrous than any wonder: that the son knows by heart the birth of his parents.The wife conveys the husband amid the uproar; just for the man an auspicious bridal procession has been made ready."},{"pageNumber":1445,"pageContent":"X.3314284.

The progress of the poem is marked by changes in meter. In the first verse the poet remembers his for-mer privileged position and, in its last pāda, the sudden advent of disaster. The next two verses (a pragātha) describes his present miserable state (in terms found also in part in I.105.8) and begs Indra for help. In the last six verses, in gāyatrī, the poet first recalls how he “chose” (a telling expression) his former patron Kuruśravaṇa (vss. 4–6).

This hapless speaker describes the intoxi-cation that grips him when he is playing or even contemplating play and that leaves him helpless to resist (vss. 1, 5–9), as well as the toll this compulsion takes on his personal life and the self-pity this evokes in him (vss. 2–4, 10–11). At the end of the hymn the gambler vows to renounce play (vs. 12), and the god Savitar restores him to his former position (vs. 13). The final verse (14) is the gambler’s address to the dice, urging them to leave him alone and find another victim. This portion of the"},{"pageNumber":1447,"pageContent":"X.341430hymn has the form of a ritual expiation, embodied especially in the last words of 12d, in which the gambler avows the truth of his speech.Dicing was an important cultural feature of ancient India, especially associ-ated with kings and the ruling class. Already in middle Vedic sacrifice, in the Rājasūya, the ritual of the consecration of the king, there is a ritual dicing match, rigged so that the king-to-be wins. Of course, the whole of the great epic, the Mahābhārata, is determined by the outcome of the dicing match between Yudhiṣṭhira and his cousins: Yudhiṣṭhira gambles away his kingdom, his broth-ers, his wife, and himself and must fight to regain his kingship. The much-loved story of Nala and Damayantī also involves the gambling away of a kingdom, this time by Nala. And the dharma texts consider gambling, along with hunting and womanizing, to be a characteristic pursuit—and vice—of kings (cf. Mān ava Dharma Śāstra VII.47, 50; for condemnation of gambling in general see, e.g., MDŚ IX.220–28).Ancient Indian dicing was quite different from the game that the word con-jures up in the modern mind, and much scholarship has been devoted to figur-ing out what the play actually consisted of (see, e.g., Lüders 1907; Falk 1986). It seems to have involved a large quantity of a particular kind of nut (vibhīdaka /vibhītaka) as the dice; these had no markings on them. They were thrown into a hollow on the ground, and the players took turns pulling out a handful. The best “hand” was one divisible by four, and the other hands were ranked accord-ing to how many nuts were left over after a division by four, with a single leftover nut being the worst (see vs. 2c). For details, see Falk (1986: 73–133). Although it may be hard for us to imagine the passions enflamed by this kind of long division, our own games of chance probably will not stand up to scrutiny some millennia in the future.The monologue form found here is almost unprecedented in the R̥gveda, and the shifting play of emotions—guilty excitement, tender remembrance of his past life and family, scorn for his own weakness and the disgust he arouses in others, bitter anger at the inanimate dice that brought him low, to which he ascribes agency and malign intention and for which he still longs—is psychologi-cally convincing and very moving. Showing our own biases, we might proudly deem it quite “modern.”1. The dangling (nuts) of the lofty (tree) exhilarate me, the ones born in a windy place, constantly whirling in the gaming hollow.Like a draught of soma from Mt. Mūjavant, the wakeful vibhīdaka nut has pleased me.2.

The first two, to the All Gods, are attributed to Luśa Dhānāka, while the other two were given fanciful poets’ names derived from the contents of the hymn itself: 37 Abhitapas Saurya (“Scorching Heat, son of the Sun”) and 38 Indra Muṣkavant (“Indra, possessing testicles”).X.35 (861) All GodsLuśa Dhānāka14 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 13–14This is primarily a morning hymn, calling especially on the gods associated with the early morning sacrifice for aid and protection: the Sun, the Dawn, Agni, Indra, the Aśvins, as well as Heaven and Earth. The ten interior verses (3–12) have a pāda-length refrain dedicated to the kindled ritual fire, and the activities of Dawn occupy much of the hymn (esp. vss. 3–6). The hymn opens out toward its end, with special focus on the Ādityas (vss. 9, 11–12), but the later prominence of the Ādityas has been prepared by mention of “blamelessness” in earlier verses (2–3) and by the “proclamation of truth” in verse 8. This truth, formulated in 8c, is simply that “the Sun, as spy,” rises every day, but we know from elsewhere in the R̥gveda (nearby X.37 belonging to the same poetic group [see discussion there], as well as, e.g., VII.62.2, VII.63.1) that the Sun is the eye of the Ādityas, especially Mitra and Varuṇa, who attests to the innocence or guilt of the men whom he sees as he rises. Thus this brief truth formulation encapsulates our knowledge that our place in the moral order is mediated through the cosmic order of the daily rhythm of sunrise.1.

Here the Sun is primary, and his role as the eye of Mitra and Varuṇa, and thus as the observer of mortals’ guilt or blamelessness, is announced at the beginning (vs. 1a), and an expanded version of the truth formulation of X.35.8 is found in the second verse.The benefits the Sun brings to us and the regularity of his return form the sub-ject of the middle part of the hymn. The connection between our moral behavior and the Sun’s daily round is asserted again toward the end of the hymn (vs. 9), which concludes (vs. 12) with a general expiation for faults unwittingly committed and a scapegoating of our enemies.1.

It is a martial hymn, calling on Indra to fight on our side in pitched battles, vanquishing our enemies and sharing the booty he acquires. The style is lively and at times slangy, especially in the final verse, with its surprise ending: depicted as all powerful in the rest of the hymn, Indra is revealed to be not entirely free, but in some unspecified thrall to Kutsa (otherwise a client of Indra’s in the R̥gveda), and the poet taunts Indra to break the bonds.1. At this glorious battle charge, Indra, at the vehement battle cry, help us to win,when at the winning of cattle, when the bespangled (warriors) have been emboldened, the missiles fly in all directions at the time to conquer superior men.2.

For I have heard of you, Indra, as tightly wound, unyielding, spurring on (even) the feeble, o bull.Release yourself from Kutsa! Come here! Will such a one as you stay tied by the balls?From X.39 through X.56 the hymns are arranged in groups of three, each trio gener-ally ascribed to the same poet by the Anukramaṇī. See Oldenberg (1888: 236).The next three hymns, dedicated to the Aśvins, are attributed to a female poet Ghoṣā (X.39–40) and her son (X.41). Ghoṣā herself bears the patronymic Kākṣīvatī “daughter/descendant of Kakṣīvant,” the exceptionally artful poet of I.116–126, who is especially devoted to the Aśvins: five of his eleven hymns are dedicated to them (I.116–120). Indeed the phraseology and mythological references of the Ghoṣā hymns share much with Kakṣīvant’s Aśvin hymns, and whether we accept the Anukramaṇī’s ascription of the hymns to a woman and her son (the latter iden-tified by the metronymic Ghauṣeya), there can be no doubt that these hymns have a remarkably close relationship to the Kakṣīvant hymns in Maṇḍala I. It is worth remembering that Kakṣīvant shows a particular interest in women and marriage in his hymns.All three of the Ghoṣā hymns begin with a verse invoking the Aśvins’ chariot, but they diverge significantly thereafter. The final hymn (X.41) is a brief (three-verse) pendant to the series, straightforwardly describing the Aśvins’ early-morning jour-ney to the sacrifice and urging them to come to our offering in preference to other possible ones. The other two are more complex, with significant involvement of an apparent woman’s voice, especially in X.40, which focuses on marriage.X.39 (865) AśvinsGhoṣā Kākṣīvatī14 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 13This first hymn in the series is in most ways a standard Aśvin hymn, especially in the Kakṣīvant mode. After the first verse devoted to the chariot and a plea to the Aśvins for lavish gifts (vs. 2), the hymn settles into the familiar pattern of many Aśvin hymns, in a list form briefly mentioning good deeds performed and benevolent"},{"pageNumber":1456,"pageContent":"X.391439treatment meted out by those two gods. The first catalogue is fairly brief, consisting of the two verses 3–4, with a formulaic summary (“I shall proclaim your ancient heroic deeds . . . ”) in verse 5. The poet promises to make the Aśvins “new” (5c), just as they famously made Cyavāna young again (4ab). A second longer catalogue of deeds, more formally constructed, occupies verses 7–11.But these lists are interrupted (in vs. 6) by a surprising, 1st-person intrusion: a woman (the feminine pronoun iya﻿́m opens the verse and makes the gender of the speaker unmistakable) calls upon the Aśvins and begs them to serve as her parents and aid her in her plight, since she lacks friends and relations. The reason for her distress is not given, but the traditional view that she is asking them to find her a hus-band seems reasonable, given that an orphaned girl would have no marital prospects and would be quite vulnerable to mistreatment. Her verse closely echoes the first verse of the hymn: she uses the same verb “invoke” and uses a paternal image like that in verse 1d.This heartrending verse seems to have no sequel in the hymn. Although it is not impossible that the following catalogue verses are also her speech, it seems unlikely because of their strict conformity to Aśvin-hymn diction. While it is certainly true that the next verses mention several females helped by the Aśvins (the wife for Vimada, the aid given to Vadhrimatī and to Puraṃdhi, vs. 7; to Viśpalā in vs. 8), males are just as often recipients of their favor in those verses, and the most striking female figure, the spinster growing old in her parents’ house in verse 3, who is identified with the woman in verse 6 and indeed with Ghoṣā by many commentators, is not in a verse that our female speaker could be saying.The female speaker in this hymn foreshadows and complements the female speaker, explicitly identified as Ghoṣā, in the next hymn (X.40.5–8), and the speaker in this hymn is often said to be that same Ghoṣā. However, in the opinion of one of us (SWJ) this is quite unlikely because our speaker bemoans her lack of kin, while Ghoṣā in X.40.5 is said to be a king’s daughter. Instead, the two female speakers seem meant to contrast with each other and to reflect extreme poles of women’s sta-tus in a marital context. The other of us (JPB) sees the speaker’s lament in 39.6 that she has no friends or relatives as a metaphorical and hyperbolic characterization of her unhappy life rather than a literal description of it. In that case the speaker in X.39 could the woman called Ghoṣā in X.40.Another, enigmatic reference to a woman is found in verse 11, which ends the cat-alogue. The verse declares that no trouble afflicts a man if the Aśvins put his chariot and his wife (pa﻿́tnī) “in front.” What exactly is meant here is unclear, but we sug-gest that this is yet another fleeting reference to the introduction of the Sacrificer’s Wife (pa﻿́tnī) into the ritual in late R̥gveda; the chariot and the wife leading the way remind us of the Mudgala/Mudgalānī hymn (X.102), in which Mudgala’s wife, Mudgalānī, serves as successful charioteer in a chariot race—a hymn we have also interpreted as a reference to the new ritual institution of the Sacrificer’s Wife. (For further discussion, see the introduction to X.102.)"},{"pageNumber":1457,"pageContent":"X.391440The hymn ends with a return to the Aśvins’ chariot drive (vs. 13), with a few more incidental good deeds, and a summary verse announcing our own praise hymn (vs. 14).1.

Accordingly we have contributed contrastive, signed discussions of the hymn’s context in this introduction.SWJAs already noted, the hymn begins with a mention of the Aśvins’ chariot journey (vs. 1) and indeed continues with speculations on their whereabouts (vss. 2–3) and a description of our attempts to attract them to our sacrifice (vs. 4). These verses contain vivid imagery, especially the contrastive pictures of sexual pairing in verses 2–3 (see also X.39.14c, which is a mirror image of 40.2d).These erotic images prepare the way for the scenes of apparent betrothal and marriage that follow (vss. 5–11). These verses open with the speech of a woman identified as Ghoṣā, whose status as king’s daughter contrasts with that of the bereft, unnamed woman who speaks in X.39.5 (see the introduction to that hymn). Ghoṣā boldly addresses the Aśvins themselves and demands to know if they will “be there” for her (vs. 5). The scene sketched is, in my opinion, a Svayaṃvara or woman’s “self-choice” marriage. The stage has been set for this in verse 3d, where the Aśvins are described as coming to soma-pressings “like kings’ sons” (rājaputrā́)."},{"pageNumber":1459,"pageContent":"X.401442This tatpuruṣa compound is found only here in the R̥gveda and would neatly iden-tify the Aśvins as appropriate suitors coming to a Svayaṃvara, where the woman making the choice would likewise be a king’s daughter (5b). Her unabashed speech, questioning them about their suitability as husbands and supporters, would be fit-ting in a Svayaṃvara context.The next verses (6–8) seem to depart from the marriage theme, and it is not possible to be certain that they are spoken by Ghoṣā. I believe they are, however, because the marital theme continues beneath the surface: verses 5–7 contain four somewhat problematic instances of the preverb pa﻿́ri “around” (5a, 6a, 6c, 7c), in the same metrical position, but in awkwardly unidiomatic verbal lexemes. The problems they cause for the translator are seen in the somewhat “off ” English that represents them. This intrusive pa﻿́ri is, in our opinion, an insistent reminder of the wedding context, evoking one of the important parts of the wedding ceremony, the circumambulation of the fire, and also evoking the consummation of the marriage, the embrace of the bride, found close to the end of these wedding verses, in 10d “the wives are to be embraced (pariṣvaje﻿́).”Ghoṣā’s likely speech ends with verse 8, ostensibly praising the Aśvins for “giv-ing freedom/wide space” to various individuals and opening up an enclosure with all the characteristics of the Vala cave, a deed not usually attributed to the Aśvins. The wide space created and the opening up of the enclosure can (perhaps fancifully) be taken metaphorically here, in this wedding context, for the deflowering of the virgin bride.The following two verses (9–10) return to the narrator/poet and describe the wedding itself, but develop the theme identified in the previous verse. In the first pāda of verse 9 the maiden is born—presumably born into womanhood, after the “opening up” just performed. The “little lad” in flight in the same pāda may be her bridegroom, or even a pet diminutive for his penis. The next two pādas (9bc), with sprouting plants and flowing rivers, are generally interpreted as expressing nature’s approval of the marriage; in contrast we again consider them metaphorical, express-ing the advent of sexual maturity and sexual awakening. The sprouting sprouts of pāda b remind us of the maiden Apālā’s prayer that her pubic hair would grow along with the plants in the fields (VIII.91.5–6); the rivers of pāda c might either be her first menstrual blood, the blood from her deflowering, or sexual fluids produced by arousal. This verse ends with the same phrase that Ghoṣā used in her question to the Aśvins, “be there for the day,” but with a reversal of genders (the bride will be there for her husband, as Ghoṣā asked the Aśvins to be there for her), followed by the triumphant “this is marriage!” While verse 9 treats marriage as an intimate exchange between the two principals, verse 10 brings us back to the social aspects of marriage: the exchange relation created between the families and the effort required to bring it about. The mysteries of sex are, mysteriously, touched on in verse 11.The hymn ends with three verses (12–14) more conventionally addressed to the Aśvins with requests for goods and aid, though the final verse (14) echoes the ques-tions about the whereabouts of the Aśvins that began the hymn."},{"pageNumber":1460,"pageContent":"X.401443JPBAn alternate view of the ritual context of X.39–40 is that both hymns find a place in an Atirātra, an Overnight Soma Sacrifice, in the morning rites that conclude the ceremony. In these rites, which are a continuation of the rites of the Third Pressing from the previous evening, the Aśvins return in the morning of the second day to receive a last offering of soma. The references to the night between evening and morning oblations (e.g., X.40.2), to the soma offerings (X.39.4, 40.13, 14), and, of course, to the Aśvins, to whom both hymns are dedicated, accord with the ritual context of an Atrirātra.One of the themes of the Third Pressing in the classical soma rites is the fertil-ity of the sacrificing couple. Since this is a relatively late hymn, the Wife of the Sacrificer may already have been a participant in the rite for which these hymns were composed. Therefore, the hymns might have been an appeal to the Aśvins to help make the marriage of the sacrificing couple a success by giving them a son. Thus, the “little lad” who “has taken flight” in the puzzling verse 9 might be the hoped-for child, whose birth marks the success of their marriage. His “flight” can refer to his conception; the image of an embryo “flying” to the womb also occurs in X.162.3. For a detailed study of the hymn that reflects this interpretation, see Brereton 2013.1.

They share the last two verses (10–11), as well as lexicon and phraseology. Yet the two hymns are thematically distinct, and X.43 lacks the carefully balanced reciprocity of X.42. The focus here is on liquids—on nourishing streams of water (vss. 3, 6–8) as well as on soma (vss. 2, 4, 6–8)—and on finding the sun or the light (vss. 1, 4, 5, 8). These themes together evoke the triumphant progress of the Ārya, conquering rivers and finding sunlit space, which is mythically embodied in Indra’s release of the waters confined by Vr̥tra indirectly reflected in verse 8b. This recourse to the mythic model accounts for the references to Manu, the primal Ārya sacrificer (vss. 4, 8).One can point to a nice index of the different uses even shared elements are put to in the two hymns X.42 and X.43: identical or almost identical phrases assign roles to exactly opposite personnel. Thus, the phrase “fix desire on someone” (√śri kā́mam LOCATIVE) is found in both X.42.6b and X.43.2b; in the former Indra has fixed his desire on us, while in the latter I have fixed my desire on Indra. Similarly, in the elaborate gambling simile found almost identically in X.42.9abc and X.43.5ab it is the mortal who is the subject in X.42 and Indra in X.43.1. My thoughts—sun-finding, all directed to a single goal, eager—have bellowed to Indra.They embrace him as wives do their husband, embrace the bounteous one like a sleek young blood, for help.2.

Since there is soma here, let there be drinking for you.3. Indra, warding off from diverse directions neglect and hunger—just he, as bounteous one, will be master of wealth and goods.Just his vitality do these seven rivers, in their torrent, increase—the vitality of the tempestuous bull.4. Like birds on a leafy tree, the soma drops—exhilarating, sitting in the cup—have settled down on Indra.Their countenance, powerfully flashing forth again and again, found the sun, the light of the Ārya, for Manu.5. Like a (gambler) with the best throw he pulls out the perfect (“hand” of dice) in the game, when the bounteous one wins the sun as his takings.No other will be able to match this heroic deed of yours, neither one of the past, o bounteous one, nor of the present."},{"pageNumber":1465,"pageContent":"X.4414486.

The hymn bristles with difficulties in the details, but its overall trajectory is clear: it is a journey hymn, inviting Indra to drive to our sacrifice (vss. 1–3) to take his place on the ritual ground and partake of our soma (vss. 4–5). The poet then contrasts evil-minded non-sacrificers with their generous counterparts (vss. 6–7). The poet gives a brief précis of the heroic deeds Indra accomplished in the past after drinking soma (vs. 8), and in verse 9 urges Indra to defeat the poet’s enemies, while making himself at home at the soma sacrifice.1.

The cosmic aspects of Agni (vss. 4–6, 8) are thus marshaled in service of the ritual Agni, installed as fire-priest in verse 7, and it is therefore easy to believe in the good things that will come to the mortal who sacrifices to Agni (vss. 9–12).1. From heaven was Agni born first; from us was he born second as Jātavedas.(Born) a third time in the waters, the inexhaustible one—kindling him, the manly minded, very attentive (mortal) sings to him.2.

He radiates with his radiant beam between the two world-halves.5.

However, X.46 is, for the most part, more rhetorically driven and more obscurely phrased than X.45, with images pushed to the edge of intelligibility (and beyond; see, e.g., vs. 7). The trickiness of its phraseology is matched by its meter, a shifting combination of triṣṭubh and virāj lines, with a number analyzable as either. Nonetheless, the emphasis on the installation of the ritual fire is manifest through-out: the original installation (vss. 4, 8–10), the reinstallation of the disappearing Agni (vss. 2–3), and the current installation (vss. 5–6)."},{"pageNumber":1469,"pageContent":"X.4614521.

Nonetheless, the subject matter of this hymn is quite distinct from the two Agni hymns that precede it: it is a naked demand to Indra for wealth. The hymn has a superficially monotonous structure consisting of attributes in the accusative: verses 2–5 form a single sentence dependent on the second hemistich of 1. But this monot-ony conceals, or rather reveals, the poet’s cleverness, for it is entirely ambiguous whether the accusatives modify Indra or the “wealth” of the refrain found in all the d-pādas. In the former case, the adjectives would agree with the accusative tvā in the verb phrase found in 1c vidmā́ hí tvā “for we know you (as),” punctuated and inter-rupted by the syntactically unconnected refrain; in the latter case with the accusative rayím in the refrain. The semantics of the predicate adjectives in these verses would allow either, sometimes slightly tipped toward one or the other. It may seem that the question is settled finally in verse 5, where we encounter the first noun—vā́jam “prize”—in this sea of adjectives, since “prize” might seem a more likely synonym of “wealth” than of Indra. However, in the rhetorical universe of the R̥gveda it would certainly be possible to refer to a god as a prize. We think it highly likely that the poet intended the audience to consider both possibilities throughout the sequence.The last three verses (6–8) more conventionally state that praises are being offered, to Br̥haspati (vs. 6) and to Indra (vss. 7–8), in return for favors.1. We have grasped your right hand, Indra, seeking goods, you goods-lord of goods,for we know you as cow-lord of cows, o champion. – To us give bright, bullish wealth.2.

Given the supposed identity of poet and dedicand, the first two of these are appropriately cast as Indra’s own self-praise.X.48 (874) Indra VaikuṇṭhaIndra Vaikuṇṭha11 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 7, 10–11As noted immediately above, X.48 and 49 present themselves as Indra’s self-praise (ātmastuti, on which see Thompson 1997). They are spoken in the 1st person, with insistent 1st-person pronouns and verbs. In this hymn only verse 10 lacks an explicit 1st-person form, and the first verses especially establish the pattern: each pāda of verse 1 begins with a 1st-person pronoun (ahám, ahám, mā́m, ahám), as does each half-verse of verse 2 (ahám, ahám), and again, each pāda of verse 3 (máhyam, máyi, máma, mā́m). (Of the 1st-person singular pronominal paradigm, only instrumental máyā and ablative mát are absent from this hymn, and both are poorly attested in the R̥gveda [three and twelve times respectively].)The contents of the self-praise range over Indra’s many accomplishments, but especially focus on his victories in battle and what he has won thereby—a warrior’s boast, in other words. Some of the exploits are obscure, indeed mentioned only here (e.g., vs. 8).The only verse lacking 1st-person reference, verse 10, appears to be a riddle, with a balanced opposition between the good or successful man (?), who has soma within, and his opposite number, whose failure is exposed by his lack of soma. But this interpretation must remain tentative, given the puzzles in that verse."},{"pageNumber":1472,"pageContent":"X.4814551. I was the foremost lord of goods.

For the for-mer, note that of the twenty half-verses (excluding the final summary verse 11), sixteen begin with ahám “I” and one with mā́m “me.” Only three (6c, 7c, and 10c) lack such an initial pronoun, and 7c has the enclitic mā “me” in second position (yán mā), while 10c begins with spārhám, a rhyme form to ahám.As for verbs, the hymn is dominated by the injunctive, with nearly twenty such forms. This morphological skewing contrasts with the patterns in the preceding hymn, which has a wider range and more balanced selection of tenses and moods. The reasons for the prominence of the injunctive are not clear to us and, somewhat surprisingly, Hoffmann fails to treat this hymn systematically in his monograph on that verbal form (Hoffmann 1967).Like X.48 this hymn particularly celebrates Indra’s martial successes and the aid he gave various mortal clients in subduing their enemies. Several of these vignettes are little known, if at all, and others are quite obscurely phrased (e.g., vs. 3, though it treats the well-known saga of Kutsa, Śuṣṇa, and, probably, Uśanā Kāvya; vs. 6). The hymn also emphasizes, more than X.48, the importance of the sacrifice in strengthen-ing Indra and securing his help: verse 1 announces this theme quite clearly, and verses 4–7 treat the relationship between sacrificer and Indra as well, though not as clearly.The final verse (11) summarizes Indra’s own speech, before addressing him directly and assuring him that the deeds he himself boasted of will also be praised by singers.1. I gave the foremost good to the singer. I made the sacred formulation a strengthener for me.I became the inciter of the sacrificer. I have vanquished the non-sacrificers in every contest.2.

It is striking that the gods, perhaps disingenuously, do not argue for their own deserving state. In the last three verses (7–9) the gods propose rewards for Agni’s returning to his task, and he accepts them.1.

I flinched from it like a buffalo from the bowstring of an archer.7.

He ceremonially requests guidance from the gods about how to perform his new duties in verses 1–2.The middle verse (3) seems not to be spoken by Agni, but rather by a mortal attending or officiating at the sacrifice and catching sight of the newly installed Agni. In the first half of the verse he expresses some anxiety about this fire’s con-nection to Yama; at issue is the possible confusion between, or identity of, the new ritual fire with the cremation fire, which conveys the dead to Yama’s realm. (Similar anxiety is treated in the funeral hymns, especially X.16.) Reassurance seems to be dispensed in the second half of the verse; it may be (following Lanman 1884: 388) that the daily rebirth is that of the Agnihotra fire, while the monthly rebirth is for the Śrāddha, or ceremony in honor of the dead—allowing separation of the two fires and their functions.In verses 4–5 Agni quotes the gods’ words as they install him (4cd), and prom-ises to fulfill his duties in exemplary fashion. The final verse (6) sums up the gods’ installation of Agni.1. [Agni:] All you gods, instruct me how, chosen here as Hotar, I shall conceive it [=task] upon being installed.Proclaim to me how, by what path I shall convey your share, your oblation to you.2. [Agni:] I have sat down as the better sacrificing Hotar. All the gods, the Maruts spur me on.Every day, o Aśvins, the Adhvaryu-ship is yours. The kindling stick becomes the Formulator; this is the poured offering for you two.3. [Sacificer?:] This one here who is the Hotar—who is he to Yama? Whom am I calling upon when the gods anoint (him)?Every day he is born, every month. And so the gods have installed him as conveyor of the oblation.4. [Agni:] The gods have installed me as conveyor of the oblation—I who had slipped away, undergoing many troubles:“Agni, the knowing one, will arrange the sacrifice for us, with its five courses, three turns, seven threads.”5. [Agni:] Through sacrifice I will win you immortality rich in heroes, so that I can make wide space for you, o gods.Might I place the mace in Indra’s arms. Then he will win all these battles.6.

The first three verses are apparently spoken by mortal sacrificers, who have installed the recovered Agni as Hotar and are pleased (vs. 3) with the resulting success of their sacrifice.In verses 4–5 Agni responds, inviting both gods and men to take pleasure in his application to this ritual role. Verse 4 also contains one of the few R̥gvedic refer-ences to the enmity between the gods (Devas) and the Asuras. Although this persis-tent rivalry dominates middle Vedic mythology, it only begins, very tentatively, to appear in the late R̥gveda, to which period this hymn belongs.The next three verses (6–8) are again the speech of human priests, addressed both to Agni and to fellow celebrants, urging them to carry on the ritual work. In verse 7 the sacrifice, as often, is metaphorically identified with a chariot, and the puzzling beginning of verse 8 may refer metaphorically to a river crossing, taking the sacrificers to a better state.The most enigmatic verses of the hymn are the last three (9–11), in jagatī meter (as opposed to the prevalent, but not ubiquitous triṣṭubh). They begin with the god Tvaṣṭar, the “Fashioner” of the gods: he has fashioned drinking cups for the gods, and now sharpens a hatchet for Brahmaṇaspati to use. Since Brahmaṇaspati has a transparent name, “Lord of the Sacred Formulation,” he is almost surely going to use the hatchet to hew a sacred formulation, the mystical verbal embodiment of cosmic truth. In verse 10 the poets are urged to use the same types of tools, presumably to fashion the same things: sacred formulations. Or, in another com-mon metaphor, to create “hidden tracks” (that is, mystical verbal compositions). Verse 11 may be an example of such a hidden track: it is certainly impenetrable enough, with riddling and paradoxical images that several millennia of study have not solved.1. The one whom we sought with our mind, this one has come here just now, knowing the sacrifice, attentive to its articulation.He will perform sacrifice for us in the divine assemblage as superior sacrificer, for he will sit down (as Hotar) close by, in front of us.2. He has been realized as Hotar, as superior sacrificer by his installation. Since he watches over the well-placed pleasurable offerings,we shall sacrifice to the gods deserving the sacrifice—yes! We will reverently salute those worthy of salutation with ghee.3. He has made our pursuit of the gods successful today. We found the tongue of the sacrifice in hiding.He has come here, sweet smelling, clothing himself in life. He has made our invocation of the gods fortunate today."},{"pageNumber":1479,"pageContent":"X.5414624.

Stretching the thread (of the sacrifice), (o Agni,) go following the radiance of the airy realm. Protect the paths of light made by insightful thought.(You priests,) weave a work without knots for the ever-praising ones. Become Manu, (o Agni). Generate the divine race.7.

In between there is both standard praise of Indra’s well-known deeds (e.g., vss. 1cd, 3) and more ambiguously phrased assessment of his accomplishments. In verse 2bc, for example, Indra’s victories seem almost dismissively characterized as a magic trick (māyā́, the word later famously used of the “illusion” of reality) produced by his own boasts. The four names of Indra in verse 4 are presumably his famous epi-thets, such as vr̥trahán “Vr̥tra-smasher,” but the poet also seems to be slyly implying that Indra’s deeds are reducible to words. These deprecatory hints are slight and could be otherwise interpreted, but in any case the poet has avoided a conventional recital of Indra’s exploits. Instead he seems to be saying that Indra’s great deeds and the words that express them are essentially the same: his reputation is equiva-lent to himself (vs. 1ab); his own proclamation of his powers is taken by the world as identical to “battles” (vs. 2); his epithets are the power that produces his deeds (vs. 4). Although this poetic ploy is, in one sense, the usual message that mortals’ praises strengthen Indra for his deeds, the poet here seems to be claiming something more: that the poet’s formulations are Indra’s essence.In the very last pāda of the hymn the poet seems to be doing something simi-lar with his own name Br̥haduktha (“having/producing lofty speech”), as Jesse Lundquist has suggested to me (personal communication). The pāda (6d) reads brahmakŕ̥to br̥ha﻿́dukthād avāci (“. . . has been spoken . . . from Br̥haduktha, the crafter of sacred formulations”), with his name positioned between the other two words in the line. The first half of his name, br̥ha﻿́t, is a close phonological match to the first half of the first word, brahma “sacred formulation”; the last half of his name, uktha “(solemn) speech,” is etymologically related to the verb avāci. Thus his very name can be, as it were, transformed into the verbal products that are his reason for being.1. It was to your reputation in its greatness, o bounteous one, that the two frightened world-halves called upon you.You furthered the gods, you overcame the Dāsa might, as you did your best for the other progeny, Indra.2. When you roamed, having grown strong in body, proclaiming your own powers among the peoples, o Indra,that was just your magic trick, which they call battles: neither today nor before have you discovered a rival.3. What seers before us have reached the end of your whole greatness,in that you begot your mother and father [=Heaven and Earth] at the same time from your own body?4. There exist four lordly names for you, the unfalsifiable names of the buffalo.You surely know all these, through which you have done your deeds, o bounteous one.5.

Who placed light within the light, who joined the honeys with the honey.So, a dear fortifying thought has been spoken to Indra from Br̥haduktha, the crafter of sacred formulations.X.55 (881) Indra [or the All Gods?]Br̥haduktha Vāmadevya8 verses: triṣṭubhA puzzling and enigmatic hymn, with close ties to the previous hymn, especially at the beginning. The first puzzle is that this, the second of the three Br̥haduktha hymns (X.54–56), is assigned Indra as its deity in the Anukramaṇī, but is longer (eight verses) than the previous hymn (X.54, six verses), which is also dedicated to Indra. Bergaigne (per Oldenberg 1888: 226) suggests that the ascription is incor-rect, and that this is really an All God hymn, as is the next one (X.56, seven verses). Although Oldenberg rejected this suggestion (1888: 238–39) on grounds of content, we are inclined to accept it. Although Indra is the clear or likely deity of most of the verses (1–3, 7–8), the center part of the hymn (vss. 4–6) is not, in our view, Indraic. Moreover, the numerology (see esp. vss. 2–3, 5) and the riddling phraseol-ogy throughout, without expressed referents, are quite reminiscent of a certain type of speculative All God hymn.The first verse of the hymn exactly matches that of X.54 in structure (with X.55.1 somewhat clearer syntactically), and their second pādas are almost identical. Both concern the call that Heaven and Earth issued to Indra in fright, and go on, in the second hemistich, to recount other of Indra’s deeds. And this verse also takes up the theme of the “hidden name” found also in X.54.4. But already in X.55.1 we meet an unidentified referent: “the sons of your (or a?) brother,” especially puzzling because, as far as we know, Indra has no brother.The name theme continues in verse 2, but introduces a light, into which five unidentified dear ones merge. Nothing further is made of this merger, but the same lexeme “merge into” (sáṃ √viś) is used in the next hymn (X.55.1) for the merger of the body of the dead with light in some unspecified distant place, and it seems likely that our passage touches on the same theme of death and transfiguration. Though verse 3 begins with a conventional deed of Indra, filling the world-halves, it pursues both the numerology of verse 2 and the light, now both fragmented and unified. Although various identifications of the referents here have been proposed, none is entirely convincing; moreover, the poet seems more interested in keeping us guess-ing than in providing a clear roadmap.What does seem clear is that the cosmic context of Heaven and Earth and the focus on light(s) have led us to astronomical imagery, which occupies the next three verses of the hymn. We begin (vs. 4) with Dawn, explicitly identified, and celebrated in a for-mulaic final pāda that is modeled on the refrain of a famous mystical All God hymn,"},{"pageNumber":1482,"pageContent":"X.551465III.55, where the “one and only lordship” is that of the gods. The next verse (5) has no identified referents at all, and the language is difficult and cryptic. Nonetheless it seems to refer to the moon traveling among the stars, until swallowed up by a gray one—perhaps the gray twilight of dawn or the smoke of the ritual fire kindled at dawn. The poet seems to recognize the hyper-“poetic” quality of this description (5c) and provides a simply phrased (though not simply interpreted) gloss in pāda d. Verse 6 is most easily interpretable as referring to the sun, who is called a “ruddy eagle” elsewhere in the R̥gveda, but it could also be Agni or Indra; if the latter, it provides a transition to the final two verses (7–8), which belong more clearly to Indra.1. Far away in the distance is that hidden name which the two, frightened, called you, to grant them vigor.You propped up Earth and Heaven at the critical moment, when you were sparking the sons of your brother, bounteous one.2. Great is that hidden, much-coveted name by which you begat what has been and by which (you will beget) what is to be.The light born of old that is his—that dear light do the five dear ones merge into.3. He filled the two world-halves and their middle. The five (groups of) gods in their proper sequence, seven by seven,does he survey with the thirty-four (lights) in their multiplicity, (which are one) light having a single form but following various commandments.4. In that, o Dawn, you dawned as the foremost of the radiant ones, because you begat the thriving of the thriving,in that you have nearer kinship with the more distant (Dawn)—great is the one and only lordship of great (Dawn).5. The solitary (moon?) running in the crowd of many (stars?)—though he was young, the gray one swallowed him—behold the poetic skill of the god in his greatness. (In simple language:) today he died; yesterday he was (still) utterly breathing.6. Through his power he is the powerful, ruddy eagle, who, as the nestless champion from of old, (has power) over the great.What he perceives, that is truly real, not false. He is both the winner and the giver of the eagerly sought good.7. He acquired his bullish manly powers through these, through whom the mace-bearer grew strong for the Vr̥tra-smashing,the gods who, because of the greatness of the deed being done, came into being without (their own) doing.8. Giving rise to his deeds with (them as his?) yokemate, he who possesses all might and all mind, the smiter of taunts, the overcomer of the powerful,having drunk of the soma, having grown strong, the champion blew the Dasyus forth from heaven in battle."},{"pageNumber":1483,"pageContent":"X.561466X.56 (881) All GodsBr̥haduktha Vāmadevya7 verses: triṣṭubh 1–3, 7; jagatī 4–6Traditionally this hymn was interpreted as Br̥haduktha’s funeral hymn for his son Vājin (the name extracted from vājín- “prizewinner” in vss. 2–3). More recently it has been taken as the funeral hymn for a horse, either the horse sacrificed in the Aśvamedha (Oldenberg) or simply a particularly distinguished racehorse (Geldner). We find all these interpretations unduly restrictive. Though it is undoubtedly a funeral hymn, or, to be more general, undoubtedly refers to what happens after death, there are no particularly equine features in it, since vājín can be used of humans and gods as well as horses. Nor is there any trace of the personal grief a poet might express for his son. Instead the hymn has taken some of the cosmic speculation of the last hymn (esp. X.55.2) and directed it to the more focused topic of the afterlife.The first two verses urge the dead to merge his body with a light in an unspeci-fied but very distant place, presumably even beyond heavenly lights like the sun, but associated with the gods. This merger is considered a kind of birth (see vs. 1d). The distance traveled on this good journey is treated in verse 3.The meter changes in the next three verses (4–6) and so, to some extent, does the topic. Verse 4 is quite unclear and quite disputed, in part because the ref-erent of the pronoun “their” (eṣām) is not specified. In our opinion the verse asserts that the ancestors (“forefathers”) do not control the fate of the recently dead: “their” greatness (i.e., that of the recently dead) is not in the power of their predecessors, the ancestors (4a); rather, the gods transfer the mental spirit of the dead to the realm of the gods (4b), where they, the dead, incorporate animating motion (4c) and re-enter their bodies (4d). In other words, the verse is an attempt to describe the mechanism whereby the dead regain their bodies, joining mental power with physical activity within the envelope of the old body. As such, it is more detailed than the simple, reassuring command to the dead in the funeral hymn X.14.8 “Unite with your body in your full luster,” which gives no directions as to how to go about it.The happy result of this heavenly reincarnation is expressed in the first half of verse 5, but in the second half a more certain, because more visible, means to life after death is depicted—the familiar one of extending one’s own life in the lives of one’s progeny. This R̥gvedic truism is, in our view, developed in the following very difficult verse (6) in two complementary ways. On the one hand, sons can make their “lord” (in our view, their father) into a “finder of the sun”—here we take “sun” to be equivalent to the light in verse 1, with which the dead are to merge—in two ways. The father can merge with the highest light by being provided with a proper funeral, and he can have further life on earth, continue to see the sun, as it were, by being propagated in his children and grandchildren. Viewed from the opposite direction, the forefathers, already in the heavenly afterlife, established their paternal dominion by placing descendants in later generations."},{"pageNumber":1484,"pageContent":"X.561467The final verse, returning to triṣṭubh meter, simply sums up in simpler language Br̥haduktha’s understanding of this process. For a more detailed interpretation of this hymn as a funeral hymn, see Brereton (forthcoming a).1. Here is one (light) of yours, and far away is another one. Merge with the third light.At the merging of your body, be one cherished and dear to the gods at this highest means of begetting.2. Let your body, o prizewinner, leading the body, establish a thing of value for us and protection for you.Unswerving, in order to uphold the great gods, you should exchange your own light as if for the light in heaven.3. You are the prizewinner with a winning spirit. You are well gone to the (dawns?), the good trackers, well gone to the praise, well gone to heaven,well gone according to the foremost foundations that hold true, well gone to the gods, well gone along your flight.4. Even the forefathers are not masters of their greatness. The gods placed their mental force among the gods,and they enveloped those things that were in vibrant motion. They entered into their bodies again.5. With their powers they strode around the whole airy realm, measuring the ancient, unmeasurable domains.All living beings are held down within their bodies, but they have extended themselves multiply through their offspring.6. Sons set up their lord [=father] as a finder of the sun in two ways by a third action.And their forefathers have established their own offspring as their paternal power, as their “stretched thread” among the later generations.7. As if with a boat across the swell through all the earth’s directions, (having gone) beyond the difficult places with blessings,Br̥haduktha by his greatness has placed his own offspring both among later ones and among those previous.After the sequence of hymn trios beginning with X.39, the next group (57–60), of four hymns, seems out of place, but Oldenberg (1888: 236) suggests that the whole has been arbitrarily divided into four hymns and could conceivably be resolved into three. The hymns share a theme—that of healing and returning to life—and are ascribed to “the four Gaupāyanas.” Perhaps the division into four hymns was sug-gested by the four supposed authors."},{"pageNumber":1485,"pageContent":"X.57–581468X.57 (883) All GodsBandhu, Subandhu, Śrutabandhu, and Viprabandhu, the four Gaupāyanas or Laupāyanas6 verses: gāyatrīOn its surface this hymn contains a simple revivifying spell seeking the return of “mind” to a person or persons in some distress—prefaced by two verses seeking to avoid ritual wrongdoing and to attain the help of Agni. This hymn is closely linked with X.58, a patterned litany calling for the return of mind. In both, “mind” has a broader semantic range than it generally does in English, encompassing not merely thought and mental processes, but what we might want to term “spirit.”Traditionally this hymn and the following three (X.57–60) are considered the poetic representations of an itihāsa (traditional explanatory story) concerning the king Asamāti, who dismissed his purohitas (house-priests), the four Gaupāyanas (supposedly the poets of these very hymns), and hired several Asuras instead. The latter deprived one of the Gaupāyanas, Subandhu, of his life, and in this hymn the three remaining brothers call his mind to return. The anachronistic details in this story—the king’s house-priest, the evil nature of Asuras—mark it as a secondary confection, invented for or adapted to hymns composed for other purposes.1.

But the monotonous patterned repetition in this piece"},{"pageNumber":1486,"pageContent":"X.581469contrasts with the varied ways in which X.57 seeks the return of mind. In fact, we might consider this the performative verbal material, the incantation itself, referred to in X.57.3 “we now call mind hither.”The structure is simple: each verse envisions a distant location where mind may have gone, and calls for it to return from that place. The first verse is perhaps the most crucial, for Yama is the ruler of the dead, and if mind has gone there, the person in question has presumably died. Yama’s realm is also probably alluded to in the middle verse (6): the first verse of the Yama hymn, the first funeral hymn (X.14.1), refers to Yama as the one “who has departed along the great slopes,” using the same word, pravát, as here. The other destinations are generally features of heaven or of earth; the range seems like an elaborated version of the disposi-tion of the body and its parts in the funeral verse X.16.3 “Let your eye go to the sun, your life-breath to the wind. Go to heaven and to earth as is fitting. Or go to the waters, if it has been fixed for you there. Take your stand in the plants with your limbs,” and it is also reminiscent of similar dispositions of the body in the Upaniṣads.1.

Geldner treats it as a unified composition, with verses 1–3 and 8–10 wishing long life and health to Subandhu, and the middle verses 4–7 extending these wishes to other beings.But structural considerations call this view into question. For one thing, Subandhu is mentioned only in the last part of the hymn (vs. 8), not the first. Moreover, the first four verses are marked by an apotropaic refrain addressed to Nirr̥ti “Dissolution” and should be considered as a group. The first of these verses does concern the resto-ration or lengthening of the lifetime of an unnamed person, compared to the Aśvins’ mythical restoration to youth of Cyavāna; the last of the verses (4) is a conventional prayer to avoid death and attain old age. The two middle verses (2–3) lie further from the theme of restored life, treating success in sacrifice (2) and in combat (3).The next two verses (5–6) are addressed to Asunīti “the leader to (the other) life,” a word found also in the funeral hymns (X.12.4, 15.14, 16.2), calling for the resto-ration not only of mind (vs. 5a), the concern of X.57–58, but also of other senses and powers. The following verse (7), in the same meter, invokes other gods to join in this restoration.The final three verses (8–10) are in different, but related meters (variants of paṅkti, assemblages of eight-syllable lines), and share a three-pāda refrain. The first two (8–9) call on Heaven and Earth to provide remedies and remove mala-dies; the last (10), outside of its refrain, is completely opaque: Indra is asked to “restore the . . . ox that drew the wedding-cart of Uśīnarāṇī,” a female figure appear-ing nowhere else in the R̥gveda, or indeed in Sanskrit (though the masculine uśīnara is found as the name of a people in middle Vedic and later) and whose relevance here cannot be fathomed—efforts to do so only demonstrating the ingenuity, but not necessarily the good sense, of the scholars who proposed them.1.

It first recalls him to life (vs. 7), then provides models from the constructed and natural worlds (vss. 8 and 9 respectively) for securing Subandhu’s mind within him. The return of his mind is announced in verse 10, while his sickness is banished in verse 11, again with models from the natural world. Finally the healing hand is praised in verse 12. Thus, this final segment of the Gaupāyana collection returns us to the first two hymns, X.57–58, and their concentration on the return of the mind of a sick person. Note especially that the first verse of X.58, which envisions the departure of his mind to Yama Vaivasvata in the realm of the dead, is triumphantly completed here by verse 10, “I have brought the mind of Subandhu here from Yama Vaivasvata.” 1.

Here is my hand that brings good fortune; here is my (other hand) bringing better fortune.Here is my all-healing one; here the one of propitious touch.The next twenty-four hymns, X.61–84, are paired hymns, generally attributed to the same poet and showing signs of internal connection.The first pair (61–62) are the Nābhānediṣṭha hymns to the All Gods, the first devilishly complex, the second far less so.X.61 (887) All GodsNābhānediṣṭha Mān ava27 verses: triṣṭubhThe near impenetrability of this hymn with all its poetic tricks and semantic eva-sions produces a certain despair in the translator, and it is no wonder that even sensible and thoughtful interpreters have clearly gone astray—as, no doubt, have the present ones. Much of what follows is tentative and provisional, but we have attempted to give an interpretation that is internally consistent and depends as little as possible on outside and post-R̥gvedic materials.This hymn and the next one are attributed by the Anukramaṇī to Nābhānediṣṭha Mānava. Although the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa contains a story about Nābhānediṣṭha (AiB V.14), it is generally agreed that this later tale has little to do with this hymn and cannot explain its mysteries. We would go further and suggest that the sup-posed poet’s name has simply been extracted from verse 18, where it is, in our view, the name or epithet of a different participant. We are inclined to ascribe the hymn rather to Kakṣīvant, the crafty poet of I.116–126, or a descendant or would-be epigone of his: Kakṣīvant is mentioned in verse 16, and the hymn has certain con-nections with Kakṣīvant’s oeuvre, especially I.121.The hymn consists of several different sections, but we believe that these are all linked through the dawn sacrifice and the participants therein, particularly Dawn herself, Agni, the Aśvins, and Indra. Two mythological sections treat different myths about Dawn, and these are sandwiched between sections apparently depict-ing and meditating upon an early-morning sacrifice and the dakṣiṇās, or priestly gifts, distributed there.The first four verses concern a man called Tūrvayāṇa, who in a verbal contest produces a supremely effective verbal formulation, which brings the Aśvins to the sacrifice and which also prompts liberal gifts to himself and which rescues or oth-erwise provides help to his parents and priests. His effective speech is contrasted with that of Cyavāna (a client of the Aśvins in other circumstances), who produces"},{"pageNumber":1491,"pageContent":"X.611474only “sweet dregs” (vs. 2), while Tūrvayāṇa’s speech is likened to gushing semen. His invocation to the Aśvins is given verbatim in verse 4.The next four verses treat the shocking story of Heaven’s incest with his daughter, Dawn. This is a favorite myth of the middle Vedic period (see Jamison 1991: 294–96), but nowhere is it as graphically, if fragmentarily, treated as it is here. She finally escapes (vs. 8), but before this happens, some of his semen is spilled on the ground (vs. 7), indeed on the ritual ground (vs. 6). From this semen the ritual fire is fash-ioned (vss. 7 and 9). Thus, though the rape of Heaven’s daughter is depicted as brutal, it results in the creation of the central ritual substance—as so often, around the world, in myths of cosmic rape and incest the taboo sexual encounter is primally creative. It seems likely that the comparison of Tūrvayāṇa’s verbal production with semen, in conjunction with the overall theme of dawn sacrifice, prompted the telling of this story in just this place.Verse 9 and the birth of fire form the transition to the next mythological sec-tion, the freeing of Dawn from the Vala cave by the Aṅgirases and Navagvas (vss. 9–13). Verses 9–11 all begin “right away” (makṣū́). As noted, verse 9 treats the newly created fire. In verse 10 (at least in our reading of it) the Navagvas attempt to free Dawn from her “protector,” the Vala cave. In verse 11 the mythic motifs of the Dawn cow and her milk and of Agni, the product of Heaven’s semen, are brought together—the motifs that are sacrificially found together in the dawn sacrifice. The Aṅgiras story is continued in the two following verses (12–13), though the dramatic high point has already been reached.The subject changes abruptly with the next verses (14–15), back to the ritual fire and the sacrifice to which the Aśvins will come. There then follows a section that has led many commentators (see especially Oldenberg and Geldner) to con-struct elaborate family trees and “back-stories” for the poet, who is supposed to be seeking either a new, adoptive father (Geldner) or a new varṇa (Oldenberg). In our view these ingenious constructions are unnecessary and misguided. Instead the poet, perhaps Kakṣīvant (16c), is presenting his patron with what appears at first to be a praśasti, an encomium, but which then gently mocks him for his pretentions and for perceived stinginess. Verse 16 is a fine straightforward piece of praise, attributing grand titles and qualities to the king, in our view the poet’s patron. Verse 17 is more equivocal. The king, the sacrificer, is “of two lin-eages”: this is the term that provoked the family-tree constructions of Oldenberg and Geldner. We think rather that the poet is suggesting that the king is kin to both the human and divine races—or that the king so believes (see the next verse). But the poet also says that the king ought to milk the cow that yields sap but does not give birth—which may be an allusion to the king’s slowness to produce dakṣiṇās for his poet, who points out in the second half of the verse that he him-self is doing his job in producing poetry. Verse 18 seems to us to embody the pretensions of the patron-king. His name or epithet is Nābhānediṣṭha, “nearest to the navel”: “navel” is a standard metaphor for origin and close kinship (especially the point of origin of two disparate groups), as well as for the focal point of the"},{"pageNumber":1492,"pageContent":"X.611475sacrifice or indeed the world itself. (This epithet must be very old, as the same word is found in Younger Avestan nabānazdišta “closely related, next of kin.”) And in the second half of the verse he wonders aloud how high his “navel” is, relative to an unidentified other, then boasts of the unbroken chain of generations that links him to the original navel. He gets his comeuppance in the next verse (19), where the god Agni lays claim to the real navel, the gods, the two births, and the cow and her products.With the patron put in his place, the hymn now turns to a depiction of the dawn sacrifice, or rather its conclusion, in five verses (20–24), each beginning with the word ádha “(and) now.” The dakṣiṇās are now properly given (see 21ab), and the poet therefore calls on the gods for honor and protection for the patrons (vss. 22–23). In the final verse of this sequence (24) the poet and his colleagues appear to be poised to express their final prayers (24b), prayers found in the final verse (27). In between are two verses (25–26) that ascribe “good lineage” to an unidenti-fied subject, who both takes pleasure in a praise hymn and performs ritual service. The “good lineage” reminds us of the patron’s claims to distinguished kinship earlier in the hymn, which were trumped by the god Agni. In these two verses we believe that the poet deliberately left the subject unidentified and that he meant the verses to be read with both Agni and himself (the poet) as potential subjects, thus associating himself with the fine family and divine relations that the patron craved.Needless to say, this is a very speculative reading of the poem, and many details remain unaccounted for. It is to be hoped that further progress can be made in its interpretation, within a R̥gvedic context.1. Here is a Rudrian formulation right to the point, (which) he whose speech is welcome (produced) with his mental force at a contest in skill,(a formulation) that, standing ready for liberality, will effectively guide across his two parents and, on the fifth [?] day, the seven Hotars.2. Just he, as the winner (at the contest), (stands ready) for the man who can be outwitted to give: Cyavāna measured out his altar with “sweet” (dregs),but Tūrvayāṇa, whose speech is the most welcome, poured enduring semen like a gush—3.

The Aṅgirases, who figured in verses 10–13 of X.61, are the subject of the first seven verses of this hymn, with blessings heaped upon them in verses 1–4. Their lineal descent from Agni is clearly indicated here (vss. 5–6), while in X.61 it was present pri-marily by implication (vss. 9–10). The Vala myth is treated in verses 2 and 7, and in verse 3 the Aṅgirases are credited with cosmogonic deeds more appropriate to Indra.The “navel” of X.61.18–19 is also encountered in verse 4 of this hymn (loc. nā́bhā, pāda a). Although some (e.g., Geldner) consider the navel in that verse to be a truncation of the (supposed) poet’s name Nābhānediṣṭha, we consider it to a reference to the sacrificial ground or the ritual fire, as in X.61.19.The first four verses end with the refrain “Accept the descendant of Manu (mānavá).” Geldner, who believes that the hymn conforms to the story told in Aitareya Brāhmaṇa V.14 about Nābhānediṣṭha Mānava, considers this refrain to be a self-reference by the poet and supplies “me” with mānavám as its appositive (“accept me, the descendant of Manu”).

Given that our poet’s patron is named Manu (see vss. 8 and 11), it seems more likely that in this refrain the poet is com-mending his patron and/or his family to the protection of the Aṅgirases.The final four verses (8–11) are a dānastuti of this patron, Manu Sāvarṇi, with the final Aṅgiras verse (7) serving as a transition to this praise of magnanimity.1.

The gods from whom the poet solicits well-being are primarily the Ādityas and their mother Aditi, who especially dominate the first half of the hymn. Beginning with verse 9 other gods are also invoked, though the Ādityas keep their prominence. Not surprisingly in a hymn devoted to well-being, the emphasis is on positive thoughts, though some worries about potential dangers do intrude (see vss. 11–12). More surprisingly in a hymn with such a strong Ādityan cast, our potential moral flaws are barely men-tioned (vs. 8c).1.

He begins with rhetorical questions (vs. 1): which god would it be best to address? Having suggested that all of them are potentially his targets (vs. 2), he runs through a long list of possible individuals (vss. 3–12), sometimes listing the bare name, sometimes offering further characterization.Only in verses 13–14 do we reach something more interesting. In verse 13 he expresses his hope that the Maruts will recognize their “common birth” with him, presumably on the basis of their shared role as singers and poets (on this see also I.87.5), as they meet at the “navel” (the loaded word of X.61–62, hymns attrib-uted to a different poet). The navel here must be both the sacrificial ground of the here-and-now and the mythical point of their joint origin, before their division into mortals and gods. In verse 14 he suggests Heaven and Earth as a model for this kin-ship. Perhaps the idea is that Heaven and Earth are not divided, with Heaven taking the gods’ side and Earth that of mortals, but they work as partners—both being related to the gods and both accepting the sacrifice of men. In any case the kinship that the poet has suggested he has with the Maruts as poets he asserts in another way in verse 16, where he describes himself as a “powerfully roaring poet” (kavís tuvīrávān), the exact phrase with which he identified Br̥haspati, the wordsmith par excellence of the gods, in verse 4.The final two verses (16–17), in a different meter from the rest of the poem, are the poet’s summary verses, both beginning with evā́ “in this way” and both men-tioning the poet by name.

As discussed above (see especially the introduction to IV.50), Hanns-Peter Schmidt (1968) has clearly shown that bŕ̥haspa﻿́ti was originally an epithet of Indra in his role as priest and formulator, a role that is highlighted in the Vala myth—since Indra opens the Vala cave and frees the cows not with his normal power and violence but with song and correctly crafted verbal formulae. In this hymn Br̥haspati is credited with the deed, but in equivalence with Indra. The names are essentially superimposed upon each other, an equation made more obvious by their positioning: the name Br̥haspati opens the second half-verse of verses 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, and the more transparent version of his name, Brahmaṇaspati, is in the same position in verse 7. In the midst of this sequence, in the middle verse 6, we find Indra in initial position in the verse and credited with the same deed. The poet could hardly have made their identity clearer. (The final verse of the hymn [12] begins with the word Indra, here as hero of other stories, especially the Vr̥tra myth.)The hymn begins (vs. 1) with the primal finding and production of a true insight; the unidentified “fourth one” in the second half of the verse probably refers to the fourth, inaudible portion of speech, or the fourth formulation, which figures prominently in Vedic speculations on the nature and power of speech (see Jamison 1991: 251–57). The second verse introduces the Aṅgirases, the crucial partners of Br̥haspati/Indra in the opening of the Vala cave; they too find the truthful word. The next five verses (3–8) narrate the dramatic opening of the cave and the freeing of the cows. One notes a certain irony in the poet’s treatment of Vala: though the cave is first depicted as a fetter (vs. 4) and a stronghold (vs. 5), it is described with the ambiguous term “guard” in verse 6 (a term as ambiguous in Sanskrit as it is in"},{"pageNumber":1506,"pageContent":"X.671489English), and then with a more sarcastic tone “cow-nurturer” in verse 7 and “cow-herd” in verse 8.The hymn ends with four verses celebrating the god and asking for blessings. Most interesting in this section is the final pāda of verse 10 (if we have rightly interpreted it), which alludes to the different poetic skills and styles of the mortal celebrants.1. This seven-headed insightful thought here, born of truth and lofty, did our father find.The fourth one indeed did the irrepressible one, belonging to all men, generate as he was pronouncing a solemn speech for Indra.2. Pronouncing the truth, thinking straight, the sons of heaven, the heroes of the lord,the Aṅgirases, establishing their inspired word [/laying their inspired track], pondered the first foundation of the sacrifice.3. Along with his comrades, who were constantly gabbling like geese, while he was throwing open the fastenings made of stone,while he kept roaring to the cows, Br̥haspati both started the praise song and struck up the melody, as knowing one.4. With two (gates) below, with one above, the cows standing hidden in the fetter of untruth—Br̥haspati, seeking light in the darkness, brought up the ruddy ones, for he opened up the three (gates).5. Having split apart the stronghold (from front) to back, (having split apart) the lairs, at one blow he cut out the three [=dawn, sun, cow] from the reservoir.Br̥haspati found the dawn, the sun, the cow, (found) the chant while he was thundering like heaven.6. Indra cut apart Vala, the guard over the milkers, with a roar like a tool.Seeking the milk-mixture with (his comrades) anointed with sweat, he made the niggard wail: he stole the cows.7. With his trusty comrades blazing, with the winners of spoils, he cleaved apart the cow-nurturer.The Lord of the Sacred Formulation reached through to the treasure with his bulls, his boars, with their hot sweat [/sweating over the gharma pot].8. With trusty mind begging the cowherd for the cows, they compelled him with their insightful thoughts.Br̥haspati loosed the ruddy ones upward, with his own yokemates who protect each other from fault.9. With our propitious thoughts strengthening him, ever roaring in his seat like a lion,we would celebrate Br̥haspati the bull, victorious at the contest of champions, victorious in every raid,"},{"pageNumber":1507,"pageContent":"X.68149010. When he won the prize of all forms and mounted to heaven, to the higher seats.Br̥haspati the bull (would we celebrate), strengthening him—though each (of us) brings light with our mouth in our own way.11.

O Heaven and Earth, along with the gods, further us.X.68 (894) Br̥haspatiAyāsya Āṅgirasa12 verses: triṣṭubhA wonderful hymn, which takes the fairly straightforward (though artful) narra-tive of the Vala myth in the preceding hymn (X.67) and embroiders each part of it with imaginative and studied imagery and verbal constructions. Most striking is the blizzard of similes, many having two and even three points of comparison (see, e.g., 5ab), or with simile piled on simile (see, e.g., 1c), or with complex social content (vs. 2). By contrast X.67 contains only four similes (3a, 5d, 6b, 9b), each with only one point of comparison—a number essentially reached in the first verse of this hymn.As a particularly elaborate example consider the underlying content of verse 2, whose role in the mythic narrative is simply to state that Br̥haspati reunited the Aṅgirases with their cows. But this reunion is compared to the ceremony of mar-riage and the participants are compared to the married couple and to the divinities who preside over marriage. (If we understood Vedic marriage ceremonies better, we might understand the verse better.) In the first half of the verse Br̥haspati leads the unnamed Aṅgirases to reunion with the cows, just as Bhaga (Fortune or Good Fortune) leads Aryaman, the “civilizing” god of custom, one of whose roles is patron of marriage, to the marriage ceremony in order to preside. The ceremony itself is performed at the ritual fire, and in the third pāda of the verse Br̥haspati is compared to Agni, under the designation “ally among the people” (several times used of Agni elsewhere). Just as Agni anoints the marrying couple with milk, so Br̥haspati “anoints” the Aṅgirases (compared to the couple) with cows. The fact that the word for “ally” (mitrá) is identical to the divine name Mitra simply intro-duces another complication into this complicated verse. Since, as the next verse (3) makes clear, the cows are embodiments of civilization, of the social bonds that"},{"pageNumber":1508,"pageContent":"X.681491unite the Ārya peoples, this remarkable verse is not just a poetic tour de force, but also an assertion of the centrality of social custom.Another complex simile worth exploring is in the second half of verse 6, where the poet exploits the ambiguity of two words (páriviṣṭam and ā́dat) to deploy two dis-tinct three-term comparisons simultaneously. The past passive participle páriviṣṭam can belong to either of two roots, √viś “enter,” in which case the idiom means “sur-rounded, trapped,” or √viṣ “work,” in which case the idiom means “served.” The verb ā́dat can belong to √dā “give,” with preverb ā́, in which case the idiom means “take,” or to √ad “eat.” Combining these possibilities, we can interpret the image as that of the tongue worrying food caught between the teeth, or as the tongue and the teeth eating food that has been served. Either image can be appropriate to the removal of the cows from the cave, though we are partial to the notion of Br̥haspati winkling out cows from every interior crevasse.There is no need, or space, to dissect every simile; we can only invite the reader to savor the exuberance, the precision, and often the everyday nature of the imagery throughout the hymn and to consider the construction of these similes as forerun-ners of the kāvya style in Classical Sanskrit.1. Constantly gabbling like water birds watching out for each other, like the sounds of booming (thunder) emanating from a cloud,exulting like waves stiff-peaked (like) mountains, the chants bellowed toward Br̥haspati.2. (Bellowing) with the cows, (Br̥haspati) Aṅgiras, coming near, led (the Aṅgirases) together with the cows, as Bhaga leads Aryaman.As the ally among the people [=Agni] anoints the household pair, he anoints (the Aṅgirases). O Br̥haspati, incite them like swift (horses) in a contest.3. (The cows—) thoroughly civilized, providing for guests, vigorous, cherished, of lovely color and faultless form—Br̥haspati, having brought them through, strewed the cows forth from the mountains, like grain from sacks.4. Spraying the womb of truth with honey, flinging (it=honey?) down like a firebrand from heaven when the chant (sounded),Br̥haspati, when he brought the cows up out of the stone, split asunder the skin of the earth as if (just) with water.5. With his light he drove away the darkness from the midspace as the wind drives the śīpāla-plant from the water.Br̥haspati, having (just) stroked (the skin/womb) of Vala, as the wind does a cloud, brought the cows here as his own.6. When Br̥haspati split the feebleness of taunting Vala with his fire-hot chants,he took (the cows) as the tongue takes (food) trapped by the teeth [/he “ate” (the cows?) as the tongue along with the teeth eats served (food)], and he revealed the hidden treasures of the ruddy (cows)."},{"pageNumber":1509,"pageContent":"X.6914927. For Br̥haspati brought to mind this very name of these who were resounding (with)in the seat—(the name) that was hidden.Having split the womb of the mountain like the eggs of a bird, he drove up the ruddy ones by himself.8.

He found the dawn, found the sun, found the fire; he thrust aside the dark shades with his chant [/ray].Br̥haspati extracted (the cows) of Vala, whose beauty was the cows, like marrow from a joint.10. As the woods (lament) their leaves stolen by cold, Vala lamented for the cows (stolen) by Br̥haspati.He performed an inimitable (deed), not to be repeated as long as the sun and moon will rise in alternation.11. Like a dusky horse with pearls, the Fathers ornamented the heaven with stars.In the night they placed darkness and light in the day. Br̥haspati split the rock and found the cows.12.

It illustrates the existence of a central fire tended by multiple clans who affirm through it their mutual solidarity, and who see in it the source of their domination over others” (p. 40). This particular clan-fire is that of King Vadhryaśva (see vss. 1–2, 4, 10–12), a speaking name with a deprecatory sense: “possessing gelded horses,” and in fact the fire itself bears the patronymic “son/descendant of Vadhryaśva” (see vss. 5, 9, 12). The current fire is also con-trasted with fire or fires kindled previously (vss. 4–5), and toward the end of the"},{"pageNumber":1510,"pageContent":"X.691493hymn this fire present here is depicted as victorious over former fires, presumably belonging to other clans (vss. 10–11). Such victories are just an aspect of the victo-ries over other peoples that the clan-fire brings Vadhryaśva and his allies, the men who kindle and tend this fire (vss. 5–6, 9–12).One curious detail in the hymn is found in verse 7, where various possessions are ascribed to the fire (here called a craftsman), including “a thousand barren cows.” The negative connotations of this property are immediately counteracted in the next verse (8ab), in which the fire is credited with having an abundantly fertile cow whose flow of milk is inexhaustible, but the great flock of barren cows is nonethe-less odd. It finds its explanation in a semantic pun: just as the triumphant and suc-cessful Vadhryaśva bears the name “possessing gelded horses” so does his equally triumphant and successful fire “possess barren cows.”Stylistically there is much chaining of phraseology and repetition of syntactic patterns.1. Auspicious are the manifestations of the fire of Vadhryaśva; his guidance is valuable; reverent approaches (to him) bring joy.When the clans that are good allies kindle him at the beginning, bepoured with ghee he awakens, flashing again and again.2.

(The word jñāna does not occur in the hymn, or indeed in the R̥gveda.) Hymn X.72, dedicated simply to the gods (Devāḥ) according to the Anukramaṇī, is a cosmogony focused on the origin of the divinities.X.71 (897) WisdomBr̥haspati Āṅgirasa11 verses: triṣṭubh, except jagatī 9This hymn describes the mastery of sacred speech (vā́c), which is essential for the priests performing the soma rites. This mastery binds the priests together, establish-ing their “companionship” (vs. 2). The degree of mastery distinguishes one priest from another (vss. 4–5, 7–8), while the inability or unwillingness of some priests to employ sacred speech in performance marks them and their mastery as useless (vss. 6, 9). Using the language of horseracing, the poet speaks of the “competition” or “competitions” (vā́jina, vss. 5, 10) in which priests succeed through their mastery of speech. These “competitions” could be contests to determine which priests can best compose hymns or recite hymns and therefore which ones will be chosen to partici-pate in a ritual performance. That kind of contest occurred and is likely described in verse 10ab. It is also true that the poem emphasizes the composer of the hymns: it begins with a reference to Br̥haspati, the “Lord of the Sacred Formulation,” and in the concluding list of priests, the brahma﻿́n, the “formulator,” is the only one men-tioned by name. But the “competitions” could also be the sacrifices themselves, which strive against one another for the attention and favor of the gods. If so, sacred speech is not contained just in the hymns, but constitutes all of the speech in the rite. This broader conception of sacred speech is implied in the reference to the “seven husky-voiced singers” (3d), who are likely the “seven Hotars,” the seven priests of the sacrifice (cf. II.1.2), and the reference to four types of priests in the last verse.The hymn begins by remembering the ancient seers (cf. vs. 3b, ŕ̥ṣi), who first found the “hidden name.” As Schmidt (1968: 124) suggests, the reference may be to the ancient seers who found the hidden name of the cows and so were able to release the imprisoned cows from the Vala cave (cf. X.68.7). Their concerted priestly action and effective priestly speech is then a model for contemporary priests, to whom the poet shifts in verse 2. These priests have also created the speech of the sacrifice, and their knowledge and their ability to articulate that speech bind them together as colleagues. Because sacred speech belongs to them, it carries their “mark” or “brand” (lakṣmī́, 2d). In verse 3 they found this speech"},{"pageNumber":1514,"pageContent":"X.711497by the sacrifice, for it was in the words of the ancient seers, who were their ances-tors and forerunners. They have brought that speech into the present and dis-persed it throughout the sacrifice. Not everyone who would recite or compose is capable of doing so (vs. 4). Or, as verse 5a puts it, there are those who are “stiff and swollen in their companionship.” This description is open to various interpretations, but “stiff and swollen” could apply to a corpse and here meta-phorically describe someone who is useless, similar to the American expression “the guy’s a stiff.” Their talent is unproductive, “no milk-cow,” and their words are sterile, bringing no “fruit or flower” (5d). Likewise, the uncooperative priest betrays the speech he perceives because only the priests together can perform the rite (vss. 6, 9). In verse 9cd the poet compares the speech in the sacrifice to the warp-threads on which the sacrifice is woven. But someone who does not use his knowledge and ability in the rite offers nothing more substantial than a stream of water and produces nothing worthwhile.This hymn and its concentration on vā́c invites comparison with the famous self-praise pronounced by the goddess Vāc herself (X.125), though the tone of the two hymns is very different.1. O Br̥haspati, (this was) the first beginning of Speech: when they [=the seers] came forth, giving names.What was their best, what was flawless—that (name), set down in secret, was revealed to them because of your affection (for them).2. When the wise have created Speech by their thought, purifying her like coarse grain by a sieve,in this they recognize their companionship as companions. Their auspicious mark has been set down upon Speech.3. Through the sacrifice they followed the track of Speech. They found her having entered into the seers.Having brought her here, they dispersed her in many places. The seven husky-voiced singers together cry her out.4. And many a one who sees has not seen Speech, and many a one who hears does not hear her.And for another she has stretched out her body, like an eager, well-dressed wife for her husband.5. And they say that another is stiff and swollen in his companionship: him they do not spur on at all in the competitions.He moves with an artifice that is no milk-cow, having heard Speech without fruit or flower.6. Who has abandoned the companion joined (to him) in knowledge, for him there is no share in Speech at all.When he hears her, he hears in vain, for he does not know the path of the rightly performed (ritual)."},{"pageNumber":1515,"pageContent":"X.7214987. Though all have eyes and ears, the companions are unequal in quickness of mind.Some seem like ponds reaching up to the mouth or up to the armpits, and others seem like ponds good to bathe in.8. When, in the mind’s quickness that is fashioned in the heart, brahmins perform the sacrifice together as companions,then they leave behind some by their knowing ways and others range widely with their lauds and formulations.9. Who move neither close nor far away, who are not brahmins, and who do not perform in the soma-pressing,they, having fallen upon speech in a bad way, stretch streams of water as their warp-thread, producing nothing.10. All his companions rejoice with a companion who has come in glory, who is overpowering in the assembly,for, rescuing them from their errors and winning sustenance for them, he is fittingly spurred onward to the competition.11. The one [=Hotar] sits, blooming a blooming of verses; the other [=Udgātar] sings a song in śakvarī verses.The one, the formulator [=Brahman], speaks the knowledge born (in him), and the other [=Adhvaryu] measures out the measure of the sacrifice.X.72 (898) The GodsBr̥haspati Āṅgirasa, Br̥haspati Laukya, or Aditi Dākṣāyaṇī9 verses: anuṣṭubhGeldner remarks that the hymn almost seems as if the poet intentionally wanted to show the insolubility of the problem of the origin of things by setting incompat-ible theories of cosmogony alongside one another. While we find greater coherence than this, we recognize the complexities and uncertainties that caused Geldner to come to this conclusion. At least at a very general level, the hymn does show a cos-mogonic progression from “what is not existing” to “what is existing” and finally to immortal gods and mortal humans.The hymn also has thematic elements in common with the preceding hymn. The most obvious is that bra﻿́hmaṇas pa﻿́tiḥ, the Lord of the Sacred Formulation (vs. 2), is Br̥haspati, who is invoked at the beginning of X.71. Then too, while it has the appearance of a cosmogony, the hymn also makes repeated reference to sacrificial performance. One thematic strand of this hymn is that the sacrifice embodies the principles that gave rise to the world.In verse 3 what Br̥haspati “smelted” is the “births” of the gods, as Sāyaṇa already noted. Br̥haspati brings them about by means of a sacred formulation (bra﻿́hman)"},{"pageNumber":1516,"pageContent":"X.721499expressing the origins of the gods. But such a formulation can also bring about the birth of the gods in a specific ritual place at the time of a ritual performance. In that way, words—or the thoughts behind words—can make beings real. Perhaps this is what the poet means when in verse 2d he says that “what exists,” what are “things” (the world, the gods, and humans), was born from “what does not exist,” what are not “things” (thoughts or words).In verse 3cd “the one whose feet were opened up” gives rise to what exists, which in turn gives rise to the regions of space. But in 4ab “the one whose feet were opened up” gives rise to the earth, which gives rise to the regions. That is to say, between the two hemistichs, there is a shift in the middle term: “what exists” in verse 3 and “the earth” in verse 4. The key to the significance of this shift is the word bhū́ “the earth.” “The earth” is only one possible translation; the word could also mean a “form” that something assumes (cf. III.55.13b=X.27.14d) or, etymologically at least, the act of “becoming.” If the ambiguity is intentional, then the two verses together redefine “what exists” as that which has material substance—most broadly the earth or more specifically what has form.The source of “what exists” or “the earth” is the principle or entity described as “one whose feet were opened up” (uttāna﻿́pad). Falk (1994: 7–10) understands uttāna﻿́ to describe something whose feet are “turned upward,” perhaps the upside-down world tree with its roots above. We take the more common approach in seeing here an image of birth or possibly sexual availability. But then whose feet are these? If the answer is inside the hymn, then it might be the goddess Aditi, who appears in verse 4 and is a mother of the gods in verses 8–9. Or again, since “what exists” (sa﻿́t) is said to have arisen from “what does not exist” (a﻿́sat) in verses 2 and 3, there is per-haps an implied identification of “the one whose feet were opened up” with “what does not exist.” Whoever or whatever the uttāna﻿́pad may be, the term also contains an oblique reference to the lower ara﻿́ṇī, one of the pieces of wood used to kindle the sacrificial fire. See, for example, III.29.3ab addressing the priests, uttānā́yām áva bharā cikitvā́n, sadyáḥ právītā vŕ̥ṣaṇaṃ jajāna “Attentive, bear down upon her who is opened up (uttānā́) [=the lower fire-churning stick]. Impregnated on this day, she has given birth to the bull [=Agni].” That is to say, the appearance of fire from the fire-churning wood replicates the emergence of “what exists” from “what does not exist.”In verse 4cd the poet describes the paradoxical birth of Aditi from Dakṣa and Dakṣa from Aditi. Aditi is not only a goddess, but also a principle, the principle of Innocence or Offenselessness against the gods. Likewise, Dakṣa can be a god per-sonifying ritual Skill. Their birth from one another may signify the mutual depen-dence of freedom from offense against the gods and ritual skill, both of which are necessary to carry out the sacrifice. Similarly, there may also be reference to the sac-rifice in verse 5d, in which the gods are said to be amŕ̥tabandhavaḥ. The compound can mean that the gods are kin of the “immortal” Soma or Agni or that they are kin “to immortality” or that they are connected to the immortal waters (Falk 1994: 13). There are possible references to the ritual or ritual mythology in the succeeding"},{"pageNumber":1517,"pageContent":"X.721500verses as well. Thus, in 6d tīvra﻿́, “sharp” or “bitter,” is a typical description of soma. Or again in 7a the Yatis are ritual priests, whose death resulted in the rains that swell “the living worlds” (cf. Jamison 1991: 111). And finally in 7cd the sun in the waters can be a figure describing soma (cf. Oberlies 1999: 164–65) or fire.The last two verses describe the birth of immortals, Aditi’s “seven sons,” with whom she went to the ancient generation of gods (vs. 9ab), and the birth of mortals, who are born from a “dead egg” (Hoffmann 1976b [=1992: 723]), a divine miscar-riage, both “for procreation” and “for death” (9cd).As a cosmology the hymn invites comparison with X.129.1. Now amid acclaim we will proclaim the births of the gods,so that one in a later generation will see (them) as the hymns are recited.2. The Lord of the Sacred Formulation [=Br̥haspati] smelted these (births) like a smith.In the ancient generation of the gods, what exists was born from what does not exist.3. In the first generation of the gods, what exists was born from what does not exist.The regions of space were born following that (which exists)—that (which exists) was born from the one whose feet were opened up.4. The earth was born from the one whose feet were opened up; from the earth the regions of space were born.From Aditi, Dakṣa was born, and from Dakṣa, Aditi.5. Because Aditi was born—she who is your daughter, o Dakṣa—following her, the gods were born, the auspicious kin of the immortal one.6. When, o gods, well clasped to one another, you stood there in the ocean,then the bitter dust [=spray] dispersed from you, like (the dust [=sweat?]) of those dancing.7. When, o gods, just as the Yatis did, you swelled the living worlds,then you brought here the sun, which was hidden in the sea.8. Eight are the sons of Aditi, which were born from her body.With seven she went forth to the gods. She cast away the one stemming from a dead egg.9. With seven sons Aditi went forth to the ancient generation.For procreation but also for death, she brought here again the one stemming from a dead egg.Two hymns to Indra (73–74) are ascribed to Gaurivīti Śaktyā; the first is quite com-plex, the second quite straightforward."},{"pageNumber":1518,"pageContent":"X.731501X.73 (899) IndraGaurivīti Śaktyā11 verses: triṣṭubhA dense and difficult hymn, with many cryptic allusions to Indra’s birth and some of his exploits. The Anukramaṇī ascribes it to the same poet as V.29, the first Indra hymn in the Vth Maṇḍala, and indeed this hymn has links to some of the fragmen-tary narratives in the early Indra hymns of V, especially V.30 and 31.The hymn begins and ends with the birth of Indra; the unusual and difficult nature of that birth was also the subject of IV.18. In verses 1–2ab it seems that Indra’s mother was beset with some trouble at the time of his birth. Nonetheless, he was successfully born but required strengthening by the Maruts. The account of his birth at the beginning of the hymn is quite straightforward when compared to the one given in verse 10, where several alternative sources of Indra are sug-gested. The common opinion seems to be that he “came from a (male) horse,” though “I” (the poet) have a different view. And the last word (or non-word) is Indra’s: “whence he was born, only Indra knows that.”The material immediately after the birth story is extremely cryptic, and our interpretation is quite speculative. We believe that verses 2cd–5ab combine two motifs: a ritual situation, the early-morning sacrifice, and a mythological one, the image of Indra as cosmic begetter and tender parent. The dawn ritual is suggested by the Aśvins’ journey to the sacrifice with Indra (3d, 4b) and the apparent men-tion of early morning in 2d. The mythological material is harder to evaluate and to bring into a coherent schema. In 2cd it seems that something, quite possibly the worlds, were covered, perhaps sexually, by a “great foot(print),” and from the dark-ness there came embryos, presumably engendered in this encounter. Since Indra’s feet are mentioned in the next verse (3a), it seems likely that the “great foot” in verse 2 is Indra, covering the worlds and begetting the embryos.Verse 4 brings us the curious image of Indra with a thousand hyenas in his mouth. Though Geldner, for example, considers this simply a measure of how big a mouth Indra has and specifically denies that it has anything to do with the wide-spread Brāhmaṇa stories of Indra and the hyenas, this seems disingenuous. Since the hyena word appears only twice in the R̥gveda and only once in conjunction with Indra, it seems perverse not to explore the possible connection with these later tales. The Brāhmaṇa narratives and the light they may shed on this passage are discussed at length in Jamison (1991: pt 1). Suffice it to say that hyenas carry their young around in their mouths like cats, and the image here suggests that Indra is functioning as an attentive parent to his brood. Another aspect of Indra’s parental role may be found in the next verse (4cd), where Indra “makes fast” thousands in an otherwise unidentified female: “make fast” seems a reasonable euphemism for impregnate or implant embryos. This section concerning Indra’s fatherhood seems to come to an end in 5ab."},{"pageNumber":1519,"pageContent":"X.731502After this we turn to Indra’s great deeds, especially the slaying of Namuci (5cd–7), a deed also treated in the related hymn V.30.7–8. Why the abrupt switch from Indra as parent to Indra as killer? The answer probably lies in the early-morning context of this hymn. Indra famously vowed not to kill Namuci by day or by night, or with a weapon dry or wet. The weapon, according to later accounts, was foam (also glancingly alluded to in VIII.14.13), and the time of slaughter the morning twilight—the exact time depicted in the hymn. We also consider the “darkening mists and darkness” of 5d to be the weapon used for the slaughter (rather than the later foam), since mist, too, counts neither as wet nor as dry. This mist, diffused like smoke, though directed at Namuci, settles “even on the two of the same name,” whom we identify as the Aśvins, mentioned several times previously in the hymn, who make their journey during the early morning twilight.Verse 8 summarizes Indra’s accomplishment of his deeds by way of his epi-thets and acknowledges the applause of the gods, but it ends (8d) with a cryptic allusion to another of Indra’s deeds, continued, in our view, in the first pāda of verse 9. Another tale favored in the early Indra hymns of Maṇḍala V is the chariot race between Indra and the Sun, in which Indra steals the Sun’s wheel and puts his chariot in front of the Sun’s, though it had been behind (see, e.g., V.31.11). The “topsy-turvy” outcome of 8d and the stuck wheel of 9a are suggestive of this myth. The rest of verse 9 simply celebrates Indra’s fructifying of the plants and animals, which may remind us of his parental role earlier in the hymn, and with verse 10 we return to his mysterious birth. In the final verse (11) the poets ask Indra for aid in their plight.1. You were born as the strong one for powerful might, the gladdening strongest one with manifold designs.It was just the Maruts who strengthened Indra then, when his mother, best at pushing (in childbirth) [/running], was going to set the hero to running.2. She, even though caressing (him), was sunk down because of the activities of (demonic?) deceit. They [=Maruts] strengthened Indra much with their laud.These (worlds) were as if covered over [/sexually “covered”] by a great footprint [=Indra]. From the dark, from the early morning, embryos arose.3. Lofty are your feet when you go forth. The Vājas and whatever (others) were there strengthened (you).You, Indra, took a thousand young hyenas in your mouth. You should turn the Aśvins hither.4.

Hymns X.94 and X.76 have a number of phrases and images in common, but X.94 is more charming than X.76, with vivid and imaginative com-parisons and a light tone, while X.76 is perhaps more rhetorically ambitious, with some mythological and cosmic resonances, as well as some challenging syntax. The stones are more often addressed in the 2nd person and with imperatives in X.76 (no imperatives are addressed to the stones in X.94). This implicit attribution of agency to the stones becomes more pronounced toward the end of this hymn, where they seem to supplant the human pressers. The word náraḥ “superior men” is found in verses 6–8; although the first two occurrences could be interpreted as referring to humans, the last is a vocative addressed to the stones—which makes it clear that in the previous two verses the “men” must be the stones as well.1. I stretch straight toward you at the first dawn flushes of nourishment. Anoint Indra, the Maruts, and the two world-halves,so that both day and night, in partnership, will make every seat spacious for us as they break out.2. Press this as the best pressing.

Although according to the Anukramaṇī the meter is triṣṭubh, in fact in X.77 only the last three verses (6–8) really conform to that meter, and in X.78 only the last (8). Most of the rest of the verses have eleven-syllable pādas, as is diagnostic of triṣṭubh, but clear jagatī cadences, an even more diagnostic test. As Oldenberg has shown (1888: 92–95), most such pādas have an opening of five syllables, end-ing with a light syllable (regularly ná “like”), followed by two heavy syllables, the first of which seems to substitute for the double-light break usual after an opening of five. (There is also often a word-break after these two heavy syllables, seeming to produce a second caesura in the line.) The apparent equivalence of the heavy sixth syllable with two light syllables introduces a principle of substi-tution or responsion not otherwise found in Vedic, or most Classical Sanskrit, meters, a principle that only achieves prominence in the Āryā meter quite pos-sibly deriving from Middle Indo-Aryan.X.77 (903) MarutsSyūmaraśmi Bhārg ava8 verses: triṣṭubh (and mangled jagatī)On the metrical structure, see the introduction just above.Rhetorically the hymn (through vs. 5) is dominated by similes, often studied and syntactically complex ones, with three or four similes in every verse. When the dense concentration of similes ends (beginning with vs. 6), the meter returns to con-ventional triṣṭubh and to conventional hymn-ending expressions of hope for favor.Most of the descriptions of the Maruts, however contorted their syntax, belong to the familiar repertoire of Marut characteristics: their stormy nature, their asso-ciation with Indra, their beauty and ornaments, their boisterousness. However, twice they are connected with the Ādityas (vss. 2d, 8b), a group of gods with which they generally have nothing in common. This connection is puzzling. Thieme (1938: 158) suggests that their common quality was “caring for the stranger” (if that is what the disputed word ríśādas, also found twice in the hymn [vss. 3, 5], means)."},{"pageNumber":1525,"pageContent":"X.7715081.

In fact, this hymn goes further than the previous hymn in both features. The only standard triṣṭubh verse is the final one (8), which also breaks the rhetorical pattern. And the similes not only continue throughout the hymn (until vs. 8) but are under more rigid syntactic control. It is worth discussing in some detail how the poet has crafted his hymn and how the apparently rigid repetitive structure, with each pāda containing exactly one simile, still allows the possibility of forward momentum and rhetorical climax. (See also Jamison 2007: 77–79.)Each of the first seven verses of this eight-verse hymn contains four pāda-length similes, each marked with ná “like,” and with the point of comparison almost always positioned at pāda-end. Since in runs of similes it is common to alternate between the simile-markers ná and iva, the complete avoidance of iva in this hymn is noteworthy and the regular repetition of ná contributes to the sense of regimenta-tion. Furthermore, the ná is almost exclusively in second position in the pāda and is generally the last syllable of the opening (before an often irregular break: see the introduction to X.77).All of these similes are in the nominative plural masculine, with the Maruts always the subject. This rigid syntactic structure, reinforced by its coinciding exactly with metrical units, has an almost claustrophobic effect—an effect signifi-cantly enhanced by the fact that the first six verses are entirely nominal in their syntax: in these twenty-four separate clausal similes there is not one finite verb or even predicated participle. (This exclusively nominal style cannot be entirely captured in translation.) This syntactic stasis contrasts markedly with the nature of the subjects being celebrated, for the Maruts are the most active gods in the R̥gveda. Moreover, many of the similes in this hymn concern the Maruts’ uncon-trollable energy, despite the motionless quality of the poetic form. The disjunc-tion between content and form produces a remarkable aesthetic effect. Yet the effect is not of complete stasis even in these verses, for the subjects of the similes modulate from verse to verse, while the complexity of imagery increases gradu-ally. For examples, the winds appear in verses 2 and 3 in different images, likewise bride-seeking young men in verses 4 and 5, with two types of stones and two types of mothers in verse 6.And then finally in verse 7 the straitjacket of nominal style is broken: though this verse, too, contains four pāda-length similes, both hemistichs end with finite verbs, 7b vy àśvitan “they have shone forth,” 7d mamire “they have measured.” While maintaining the underlying structure that unifies the hymn, the poet manages, by strictly grammatical means, to build to a climax. The energy kept suppressed by the nominal style is finally released by the finite verbs of verse 7."},{"pageNumber":1527,"pageContent":"X.781510The last verse (8), which is, as noted, the only standard triṣṭubh, abandons the structure of the rest of the hymn, and in conventional terms asks the gods for the usual gifts, as so often in final verses. But it is noteworthy for containing the first and only occurrence of the name marút in the hymn. Retroactively we can see that the hymn also functions as a very long riddle, whose answer is given only in this last verse. This verse is linked to what precedes by a small and subtle verbal device. As noted, twenty-five of the twenty-eight preceding pādas begin X ná, with the simile marker in second position; verse 8 begins X no (i.e., naḥ “us”). The poet invites us to expect yet another simile, but substitutes the phonetically similar 1st-person plu-ral enclitic pronoun in its place. Thus, though the verse is cast in entirely different stylistic terms from the rest of the hymn, its integral connection to what precedes is signaled by the playful naḥ. (Note that the naḥ is entirely unnecessary in this verse, since it redundantly doubles and anticipates the full pronoun asmā́n opening the second pāda.)1.

Such rhetorical moves are typical of omphalos hymns, but the mystery in this hymn seems less profound than the structure in which it is embedded seems to promise. It is simply the com-mon trope of Agni as an insatiable eater, with a nice twist in verse 6, where the poet commiserates with Agni for having, because of imagined sins, to eat without teeth. Although the supposed enigma of this hymn is not particularly enigmatic, the style is lively and the images sharp.1. I have seen the greatness of him, the great one, of the immortal one among the mortal clans.His jaws are alternately opened up and closed together again. Insatiable, gnawing, they eat amply.2. His head is deposited in hiding; his eyes set apart. Insatiable, he eats the wood with his tongue.With their feet they [=priests] collect things for him to eat, their hands outstretched with reverence among the clans.3. Questing further and further for the hidden place of his mother like a child, he creeps through the wide plants.He [=priest?] found him, gleaming like ripened grain, licking within the lap of the mount [?] .4. I proclaim this truth to you, o you two World-Halves: while being born, the embryo eats his two mothers [=kindling sticks].As a mortal, I do not discern the god, but Agni certainly discerns afar and discerns ahead."},{"pageNumber":1529,"pageContent":"X.8015125.

In the first half of the hymn (vss. 1–4) the form is almost exclusively nomina-tive singular (save for the genitives in 2a and 4d), while the second half has primar-ily the accusative. As so often, the final verse breaks the pattern: the first trisyllabic form (dat. agnáye in 7a) is followed by two vocatives (a﻿́gne) in the last hemistich (7cd), a simple grammatical switch that turns the insistently descriptive 3rd-person cast of the rest of the hymn into a direct, 2nd-person plea to the god for help and wealth.The actual contents of the hymn are subordinated to this formal structure. Most of the first half of the hymn is devoted to detailing the gifts and aid that Agni generally provides, though verse 3 briskly mentions four mythological prec-edents where Agni has aided specific individuals, somewhat in the style of the cata-logues of good deeds in Aśvin hymns. (In fact, the only reasonably well-known figure in vs. 3 is Atri [3c], whose rescue is usually attributed to the Aśvins.) Verses 5–6 establish Agni as the target of all creatures in need. In the final verse (7) the poet both announces his hymn, produced on the model of the R̥bhus, and states what he wants in return.1. Agni gives a prize-bringing team; Agni (gives) a hero, worthy of fame, outstanding through his work—Agni roams widely through the two world-halves, anointing them completely—Agni (gives) a woman with a hero in her belly, Plenitude (herself)."},{"pageNumber":1530,"pageContent":"X.8115132.

But he is also both an ancient seer (ŕ̥ṣi) and Hotar (vs. 1) and a present companion (vs. 5cd) and help (vs. 7) to the sacrificers, for his priestly work has continued from the ancient past into the present (vs. 1cd). This priestly work is closely connected with his creative work. He wins heaven and earth by a sacri-fice that he carries out for his own sake (vs. 6ab), and his ritual work is dedicated to the benefit of the realms he surveys (vs. 5). In the first line the poet speaks of Viśvakarman’s “pouring” beings “in oblation” (júhvat). It is not clear exactly what he means by that phrase, but it likely describes a process by which Viśvakarman sustains the living world through time or continues to make living beings his own."},{"pageNumber":1531,"pageContent":"X.811514The phrase must be significant, since the poet verbally recalls it in the last verse, when he anticipates that Viśvakarman will enjoy the “oblations” (ha﻿́vanāni) offered to him. In 1c the description “seeking wealth with hope” refers to Viśvakarman’s ritual activity, which carries the hope of prosperity for the sacrificer.The first and last verses of the hymn create a frame for the hymn. In the first verse, Viśvakarman is both a seer (ŕ̥ṣi) of hymns and a Hotar, who pours oblations (júhvat). In the last he is the vāca﻿́s pa﻿́ti- “Lord of Speech,” who “will take pleasure in oblations (ha﻿́vanāni).” That is, within the hymn, Viśvakarman begins as the model of a priest who both speaks and makes offerings, and concludes as the master of speech and the recipient of offerings, who supports the sacrificers. This movement from divine priest to priestly divinity exalts poets and priests, who are closely asso-ciated with him and whose words and deeds follow his.One of the stylistic characteristics of the hymn is the echoing of Viśvakarman’s name through the frequent use of víśva “every, all” (vss. 2d, 3ab, 7cd). Even more striking is the repeated use of words containing the v-sound also extracted from his name. Over a third of the words of the hymn contain that sound. Its repeti-tion is especially obvious in 5cd śíkṣā sákhibhyo havíṣi svadhāvaḥ svayáṃ yajasva tanvàṃ vr̥dhānáḥ and 6ab víśvakarman havíṣā vāvr̥dhānáḥ svayáṃ yajasva pr̥thivī́m utá dyā́m, two pādas that together have a string of twelve words containing v. The invocation to Viśvakarman and his presence thus persist even when his name is not explicitly mentioned.1. The seer who took his place as Hotar, pouring all these living beings in oblation—our father,seeking wealth with hope, entered the later (generations while) concealing the first ones.2. What was the resting place? Which one was providing support? How was it?—that from which Viśvakarman, producing the earth, (also) uncovered the heaven by his greatness—he who has his eyes on everything.3. Whose eyes and face are turned in every direction, whose arms and feet move in every direction,producing heaven and earth, he forges them together with his arms, with his fan(-bellows)—he, the god alone.4. What was the wood? What was the tree?—out of which they fashioned heaven and earth.O you of inspired thought [=priests], in your thinking ask about that upon which he rested, giving support to living beings.5. What are your highest domains, what your lowest, and these that are your midmost, Viśvakarman—do your best for them for the sake of your companions at the oblation, o you of independent will. Increasing your own person, by yourself sacrifice for yourself."},{"pageNumber":1532,"pageContent":"X.8215156. O Viśvakarman, since you are increased through the oblation, by yourself win earth and heaven by sacrifice.Let the other peoples all around be left in confusion; for us here let there be a generous patron!7.

The first words of the hymn, which call Viśvakarman the “father of the eye” (cákṣuṣaḥ pitā́), create the possibility of double reference. On the one hand, as Geldner and Renou (EVP XV: 170) rightly see and the subordinate clause “for he is insightful in mind” supports, the eye is the inspired vision of seers. On the other hand, the “eye” can be the eye of the sun, as frequently in the R̥gveda (e.g., I.164.14, V.40.8, 59.5, X.10.9). This double possibility is realized in the remainder of the verse, which describes both the sacrifice and the cosmos. In pāda b, the primary reference is to the sacrifice, evident in the ghee that the father produced. Because they are set in a sacrificial context, “the two that bob up and down” refer initially to the sacrificial ladles (juhū́), bending to the fire. But the two can also be heaven and earth, which rise and fall, a subsequent reading triggered by pāda d. In 1cd there is a shift to a cosmic context, which then becomes primary, and the sacrificial context is secondary. In 1c the phrase ántāḥ . . .pū́rve “ancient lim-its”—the beginnings of the world—can also mean the “eastern limits,” the limits from which the sacrificial area is measured. The reference to “heaven and earth” in pāda d confirms the cosmic context of this hemistich but without excluding sacrificial reference, for on the sacrificial ground heaven is represented by the Āhavanīya or “offering fire” in the east and earth by the Gārhapatya or “domestic fire” in the west. (Though those terms, ubiquitous in middle Vedic śrauta litera-ture, are not used in the R̥gveda of those two fires, the polarity of the two fires is clearly reflected in the R̥gveda.)In verse 2a there is again an ambiguity: iṣṭá may mean what is offered in sacrifice or what is wished for, and here both meanings are possible. But whose are these “offerings” or “wishes”? The seers represented in the constellation of the Seven Seers (vs. 2b) are the closest and best possibilities. The frame of reference would then be the cosmos. Or those offering or wishing may be the “ancient seers,” who"},{"pageNumber":1533,"pageContent":"X.821516appear in verse 4. In that case the frame of reference is the sacrifice. That is to say, the first verses describe both the creation of the sacrifice and the creation of the world and thereby link the creation of the sacrifice to the creation of the world.Whatever it is that Viśvakarman represents is central to these creations. He is initially set beyond both the sacrifice and the cosmos as the “father” of poetic vision and of the sun. But then in verse 2 he spreads throughout the sacrifice and the world. Verse 2ab puns on his name Viśvakarman, repeating its first syllable by the prefix vi- in vímanā “vast in mind,” víhāyā “vast in power,” and vidhātā́ “vast distributor”—the last, the one who distributes widely. The opposite of vi-, literally “apart,” is sam- “together, completely,” and the latter replaces vi- in 2bc in saṃdŕ̥ś “full manifestation,” a cosmic term, and sám √mad “fully invigorate,” a sacrificial term. The lexical shifts create the sense that Viśvakarman first extends throughout the sacrifice and the cosmos and then condenses in a perceptible form.In the latter part of the poem, in verses 5–7, the poet explores the manifest forms that Viśvakarman has taken. The best clue to the forms of Viśvakarman is the ref-erence repeated in verses 5 and 6 to “the first embryo” that the waters received and in which all the gods were manifest and gathered. That first embryo can represent any or all of three realities. First, on the cosmic plane, it can be the sun, which rises out of the waters. Thus Viśvakarman would be initially the father of the sun and then, in manifest form, the sun itself. Second, on the sacrificial plane, the embryo can be fire, or more specificially the sacrificial fire, which is the “child of the waters” (apā́ṃ nápāt) and the form in which the presence of the gods at the sacrifice is manifested. And third, perhaps uniting cosmos and sacrifice, the embryo can be the king, who is reborn as the sun or as a sun-like being by means of the unction waters in the royal consecration rite. For a clearer reference to such imagery in the royal consecration rite, see X.121.1. The father of the eye, for he is insightful in mind, gave birth to the ghee and the two that repeatedly bob up and down [=two ladles/heaven and earth].Only when the ancient [/eastern] limits were fixed, only then did heaven and earth spread out.2. Viśvakarman is vast in mind and vast in power, the distributor—the vast distributor—and the highest full manifestation.Their offerings [/wishes] are fully invigorated by nourishment where, beyond the Seven Seers [=the Big Dipper], they say the one is.3. To him who is our father and progenitor, who is the vast distributor, who knows the domains and living beings, all of them,who is the giver of names to the gods, the one alone—to him go the other living beings to make peace.4. Like singers, the ancient seers together won for him wealth in abundance by sacrifice—they who together created these creatures after the airy realm, sunlit and unsunlit, took its seat."},{"pageNumber":1534,"pageContent":"X.8315175.

Rhetorically the hymn is characterized by verbal chaining: almost every verse ends with a word picked up by the very beginning of the next verse. Thus, “fire” in 1d/2a, “alone” 3d/4a, “victory” 4d/5a, “ready to hand” 5d/6a, “pour in” 6d/7a; only 2d/3a lacks this concatenation.1.

Many of the verses are found also in the Atharvaveda (Śaunaka) wedding hymns (XIV.1–2) and are utilized in the gr̥hya sūtras (the proto-cols of the domestic rituals) in the wedding rite.It begins (vss. 1–19) with a fairly coherent account of the wedding of Sūryā, the Daughter of the Sun, whose marriage serves as the prototype of human mar-riage. She is also named by the Anukramaṇī as the author of the hymn, a clearly fanciful ascription. The bridegroom is Soma, and the first five verses are devoted to asserting that this is not the familiar earthly soma, the ritual drink (see esp. vss. 3–4), but rather the celestial Soma—here identified for the first time as the moon, an identification that becomes standard later. The waning and waxing of the moon are referred to in verse 5, and probably cryptically in the first part of verse 4, in the puzzling adjective “those whose regulation is sheltering” (ācha﻿́dvidhāna), using an idiom otherwise used for the regulation of the months and seasons (e.g., in vs. 18).The next verses (6–12) employ a style familiar from the Atharvaveda and from middle Vedic prose, a structured series of identifications between cosmic and every-day entities; the everyday entities here are the different features of the wedding, and especially the wedding vehicle. Much in these verses is unclear for several reasons. For one thing, workaday language is seldom found in these high-culture texts, and"},{"pageNumber":1537,"pageContent":"X.851520so the words for the members of the wedding party and the pieces of the bridal finery and wedding cart are unfamiliar. Moreover, the cosmic comparanda are dif-ficult to penetrate as they seem to refer to unidentified astronomical bodies and movements. Verses 13–16 focus on a single episode in the marriage ritual, the “woo-ing.” Judging from later practice, the bridegroom’s party sends several males to the potential bride’s home, to ask her father and other male members of the fam-ily for her as bride for the man they represent. This part of the ceremony begins with the wooers identifying themselves by name and lineage—the “pointing out” of verse 15. In this hymn the Aśvins are the wooers, arriving on their characteristic three-wheeled chariot, whose wheels provide the topic for a series of (presumably astronomical) riddles (vss. 15–16). (For further discussion see Jamison 1996a: 222–24.) After a verse of homage (17), this part of the hymn ends with two further verses of riddles about the sun and moon (18–19).After this long, more-or-less self-contained mythological and cosmological opening the hymn continues with verses more appropriate to the current, human wedding. Verses 20–27 contain a somewhat jumbled treatment of the wedding, from the wooing to the arrival in the new home, beginning with an invitation to mount the wedding vehicle (vs. 20), perhaps placed here because it has connections with the Sūryā section. Verses 21–22 are addressed to a Gandharva (a type of lubri-cious demigod, thought to target unmarried girls), declaring the new wife off-limits. Verse 23 seems to collapse the earlier journey to the wooing and the journey to the new home, while the following two verses (24–25) concern the ceremony itself: at least in the later ritual the wife is briefly bound with a cord, as a symbolic initiation parallel to the initiation of a young Ārya boy. (See Jamison 1996a: 42–48.) Finally, in verses 26–27 we reach the journey to the new home and good wishes for the new mistress of the household.Verses 28–35 are a strange, sinister, and menacing interlude between the gener-ally happy tone of the first part of the hymn and the blessings with which it closes. These, especially verses 28–30 and 34–35, are also the most discussed and disputed verses in the hymn. Let us dispose of the relatively unproblematic verses 31–33 first. These concern the possible dangers of the wedding journey: diseases emanating from the spectators of the procession (vs. 31) and robbers and other hazards (vs. 32). In verse 33 the spectators are allowed to look at the bride and wish her good luck, but then ordered home.It is generally agreed that the three preceding verses (28–30) have to do with the deflowering of the bride, though there is much disagreement about details. Verse 28, it seems, begins with the announcement of the blood-stained sheet or garment, the all-important sign that the bride was a virgin. But the rest of this verse and the two verses following do not treat this as an altogether positive outcome, especially for the groom. Because the bride was a virgin, the marriage is valid, so her relatives are pleased (28c)—but the new husband is trapped. The bride becomes a noose (like the old sexist American slang expression “ball-and-chain” for a wife), and he is bound in her bonds. She also becomes witchcraft embodied (28b, 29c). In our view"},{"pageNumber":1538,"pageContent":"X.851521this refers to the unnerving and dangerous hold that sex, in the person of his wife, will exert over the husband. (Compare American English “that old black magic” for sexual attraction and desire.) He is not only legally but also mentally bound, and this hold is also expressed by the paradoxical “the wife enters her husband” at the end of verse 29. Though the sexual act of course happens the other way—hus-band enters wife—symbolically she enters him: she has penetrated his defenses, got-ten “under his skin.” The first half of verse 29 is unconnected with this emotional transformation; instead it simply continues the legal and social ramifications of the consummated marriage. With most commentators (pace Falk [1993], who thinks it is the sable pelt worn by the groom), we interpret the śāmulyàm of 29a as the stained garment of the bride, now to be disposed of. Pāda b treats the gifts to be given to the priests who officiated at the ceremony. In verse 30 we return to the groom’s compromised physical and emotional state: sex, especially this first sex of marriage, is making him weakened and vulnerable, his naked flesh “glistening in an evil way,” perhaps with sexual fluids. The theme of the garment found in literal terms in verses 28–29 acquires a somewhat shocking metaphorical twist in the second half of verse 30, where sexual intercourse is depicted as the husband dressing his penis in the “garment,” that is, the body, of the bride.After this emotional binge, the dangers of the road in verses 31–33 seem rather minor! (The journey verses may have been interpolated here because the diseases of vs. 31 are reminiscent of the groom’s physical state in vs. 30.) But menace returns in verse 34, where an unidentified object is ascribed all sorts of harmful qualities. Only a brahmin can neutralize them. Similarly, in verse 35 various violent actions are depicted, which a brahmin can absolve. Most commentators have considered the object in verse 34 to be the stained garment of the bride, and the actions in verse 35 to have been performed on the garment to sanitize it. We think this unlikely; instead we consider these two verses to concern the wedding feast and in particular the cow killed for the feast. Just as the sex of verses 28–30 involved violence, surrender, and the breaking of taboos, so the slaughter of a cow to be eaten at the celebration requires the same ambivalently viewed actions and in a sense is a public representa-tion of the private violation of deflowering. But brahmins who understand “Sūryā,” that is, the nature of marriage, including its negative qualities, can safely eat the offered cow.Verses 36–37 depict a far more benign husband than the tortured one of verses 28–30 and one more uncomplicatedly eager for sex. These verses lead into the famous series (38–41) about the previous, divine husbands of the wife. The final six verses (42–47) are simply expressed blessings of the married couple and of the new wife.1.

The three participants in the dialogue are Indra, his wife Indrāṇī, and his raffish monkey pal Vr̥ṣākapi, who is making sexual advances to Indrāṇī. The hymn contains startlingly explicit sexual discourse, as well as a dazzling array of apparent non-sequiturs, all embedded in an exaltation of Indra, signaled by its consistent refrain.Not surprisingly its meaning and web of references have been the subject of much controversy; we cannot discuss the many conflicting interpretations here. However, in our opinion many of the puzzles can be solved if it is interpreted as an oblique treatment of the Aśvamedha (Horse Sacrifice) ritual, a royal ritual in which, according to the middle Vedic ritual texts, the chief queen copulates with the sacrificed horse to increase and magnify the power of the king, her husband. In this reading, the monkey represents the horse, with whom Indrāṇī must have sexual relations. She both indignantly rejects and also encourages Vr̥ṣākapi’s advances in the course of the hymn, and after their ritual copulation she is called “wife of Vr̥ṣākapi” (vs. 13). The power of her husband Indra, the king, is extended by the"},{"pageNumber":1543,"pageContent":"X.861526performance of this ritual, though he has been, in effect, cuckolded. Hence the paradoxical announcement in verse 17, which proclaims the sexual “loser” the real master. For a detailed discussion of the hymn in the context of the Aśvamedha, see Jamison (1996a: 74–88).The hymn begins with Indra’s complaint that he is no longer receiving honor or soma, a statement echoed by his wife (vss. 1–2). The falling off of ritual obser-vance sets the stage for the performance of an Aśvamedha, for Indra to regain his position. The topic then shifts to Vr̥ṣākapi (vss. 3–6), whose friendship with Indra is clearly a bone of contention between the married couple. Indrāṇī reveals in annoyance that he has made advances to her, but then, in a startling descent into vulgar speech, boasts of her own sexual prowess (vs. 6). Vulgarity is matched by vulgarity in Vr̥ṣākapi’s first entry into the conversation (vs. 7), where he responds to her implicit invitation. These two verses may well verbally signal the sexual activ-ity between them, the climactic moment of interspecies pairing that mimics the Aśvamedha. The next two verses (8–9), presumably spoken by Indra and Indrāṇī, may well be a humorous reflection of this intercourse, which may appear to Indra as spectator more like vexation than pleasure.In our view, the next two verses (10–11) are spoken by the narrator, proclaiming Indrā ṇī’s important new ritual status, as the queen ensuring the life and prosper-ity of her husband Indra. (The Anukramaṇī assigns them to Indra.) Indra then laments the loss of his friend (vs. 12), who is going to the gods as sacrificial offer-ing, but rejoices in the renewed sacrificial offerings he himself is receiving (vss. 13–14). In these verses he addresses his wife both as Indrāṇī (“wife of Indra,” vs. 12) and Vr̥ṣākapāyī (“wife of Vr̥ṣākapi,” vs. 13), for by her copulation with the monkey she became his temporary ritual wife. The narrator affirms the renewal of soma offering to Indra in verse 15, rectifying the lapse in ritual attentions noted in verse 1.The two responsive verses that follow (16–17) are the heart of the hymn and the best support for and justification of the Aśvamedha. The first contains what would be a universally accepted truism: the sexually successful male is the master and has the power. But this is trumped by the paradoxical reversal: the sexually successful male does not have the power; it’s the unsuccessful one who is master. This state-ment is beautifully applicable to the Aśvamedha: the king is cuckolded by a horse (or, in this case, a monkey) and is witness to this humiliating act, but the king also receives all the benefit from the ritual, which increases his power, while the sexual partner of the queen is sacrificed.With this pair of verses the hymn has reached its high point and conveyed its message. The remaining verses are something of a letdown. The next five (vss. 18–22) are an extended pun, relating the yearlong journey of the horse/monkey before the sacrifice with its journey to the gods after its sacrifice. The final puzzling verse (23) superficially has nothing to do with the rest of the hymn, but relates a miraculous birth from the daughter of Manu, who has the speaking name “Rib.” The deeper connection must be the explosive fertility that the performance of the"},{"pageNumber":1544,"pageContent":"X.861527Aśvamedha should confer on its participants.

The language is gleefully and cre-atively bloodthirsty, crediting Agni with a large arsenal of weapons, mostly based on the shape of his flames, and of means of violent destruction of the enemy (pierc-ing, crushing, shattering, disemboweling, etc.). The vividness of the language is enhanced by the fact that, after the first verse, Agni is always addressed in the 2nd person and almost always with imperatives. (Only vss. 15 and 18 lack direct address to Agni, though he is lurking in the background. These two verses are also the only ones in which any other gods are allowed a part of the action.)Agni’s connection with ritual is barely mentioned in the hymn. In verse 1 the poet sprinkles him with ghee, addresses him, and kindles him, in order to ensure his protection, and in verse 4 it is made clear that the murderous power of Agni’s weap-ons comes from the sacrifice and the associated ritual speech. That Agni’s fierce and aggressive protection of us stems from our ritual behavior toward him should be kept in mind—though it must be admitted that the poet seems to forget this fact for long stretches of the hymn.Lexical repetition and phonological figures, both simple and complex, are important features of the style of the hymn. To mention only one of the complex figures, the unusual participle sphūrja﻿́yan “sizzling” (the only occurrence of this verb in the R̥gveda) in 11c is echoed phonologically by śaphārújam “hoof-breaking” in 12b (and to a lesser extent by dhū́rvantam “damaging” in 12d).The sheer exuberance of the hymn is contagious, at least to its translators.1.

The present-day sacrifice begins (vs. 1ab) and ends (vs. 19) the hymn, and periodically surfaces throughout (vss. 3, 5, 14). However, the dominant strain is the primordial one, which begins in the second half of verse 1; the role of the gods in creating the original sacrifice and “begetting” the sacrificial fire is especially emphasized in verses 4 and the long sequence of 7–13, where the phrase “the gods begot” appears four times (vss. 8–10, 13), alongside similar expressions. This the-matic strain is especially striking because the gods are also regularly identified as “worthy of the sacrifice” (vss. 3, 6, 11, 13; see also 5, where Agni is so called), that is, worthy of receiving the sacrifice, while they are in fact performing the sacrifice.The other theme of superimposition is the identification of Agni, especially under the epithet Vaiśvānara “belonging to all men,” with the sun. At first the sun’s dependence on and complementarity with Agni is mentioned (vss. 1b, 2, 6): the sun only becomes visible and begins to shine when Agni is also visible. But the cosmos-filling radiance and heat of Agni (see vss. 3, 5, 7, 9) leads gradually to the premise that the gods created Agni as the sun, expressed clearly in verses 10–13. The poet then acknowledges Agni as the sun (vs. 14) and in enigmatic language describes the two paths between heaven and earth along which the sun / cosmic fire moves (vss. 15–16).The last three verses (17–19) seem to provide a simultaneous transition from the cosmic and primordial elements in the superimposed structures to the present-day everyday—by way of a dialogue between two unnamed participants. Most interpreters (e.g., Geldner and Renou) identify the speakers as two priests, probably the Brahman and Hotar who are explicitly mentioned in the last pāda of the last verse (19d). But the words that introduce the speakers in verse 17, a﻿́vara and pa﻿́ra, are ambiguous. They can mean “nearer” and “farther” (referring to the positions of the priests on the sacrificial ground), but they can also mean “lower” and “upper” / “below” and “above,” as derivatives of these words do in verse 14. In verse 17 they can therefore refer to cosmic elements. It is our view that in verse"},{"pageNumber":1550,"pageContent":"X.88153317 the dialogue is first presented as a debate between Earth and Heaven (which appear at the end of vs. 15 as the defining poles of the cosmos) about their roles in sacrifice, but the dialogue participants unobtrusively become transformed into present-day priests.The final verse anchors us firmly in the here-and-now of the sacrifice, but also asserts that as long as the morning fire will be kindled and the dawns will dawn, the sacrifice as we know it will be performed. This assertion may involve a bit of propa-ganda. The term brāhmaṇá as the technical designation of a priest appears in this verse; this term was only introduced in the late R̥gveda (as opposed to the earlier brahma﻿́n “formulator”), presumably as part of a codification and partial reorgani-zation of the sacrificial system. The poet may then be claiming a long future for the new system, and implicitly suggesting its long history, stretching back to the origins of the world—cloaking a religious innovation in a garment of imagined tradition, as so often.1. The oblation, the drink, unaging and delightful, has been poured into Agni, the one who finds the sun and touches heaven.For him to bear and support the world, the gods spread out (the world) by their autonomous power.2. The world was swallowed and hidden away by darkness; (then) the sun became manifest when Agni was born.The gods, Earth and Heaven, and the waters and plants took pleasure in the fellowship of this one, of him.3. Now urged on by the gods worthy of the sacrifice, I shall praise Agni, unaging and lofty,who with his radiance stretches through earth and this heaven, through the two world-halves and the midspace.4. He who was the first Hotar, delightful to the gods, whom they anointed with melted butter upon choosing him (as priest),he made what flies and what goes (on foot), the still and the moving, to wax strong—Agni Jātavedas.5. When, o Agni Jātavedas, you stood at the head of the world together with your light,we spurred you on with thoughts, songs, and recitations. You became worthy of the sacrifice as the one filling the two world-halves.6. Agni becomes the head of the world by night; thence is the sun born, rising early in the morning.(Behold) this artful contrivance of those worthy of the sacrifice, that the swift one pursues his work, knowing the way.7.

The penultimate verse (17d) mentions the Viśvāmitras, though that half-verse seems to have been borrowed from the Bharadvājas (VI.25.9). The poet appears to take his legacy quite seriously, for the hymn strikes one as self-consciously old-fashioned, a well-crafted Indo-Iranian praise poem, celebrat-ing Indra’s high cosmogonic deeds in carefully balanced rhetoric and beginning classically with the 1st-person subjunctive announcement “I shall praise Indra” (índraṃ stavā). The poet has also inherited the verbal cleverness appropriate to a proper r̥ṣi: his similes and figures of speech are aptly deployed, and he knows how to mislead his audience and withhold information for surprise effect. This particu-lar skill is clearest in verse 5, which appears to continue the praise of Indra, until we encounter as the first word of the second hemistich so﻿́maḥ, the real subject of the verse.In the second part of the hymn, beginning in verse 8, we encounter another theme dear to the Indo-Iranians: the punishment to be meted out to those who break or play false to their alliances or have no alliances at all. The word mitrá “alli-ance, ally, deified Alliance,” alone or in compounds, appears seven times in verses 8–15, and is, of course, an element of the poet’s ancestral name. Indra is repeatedly urged to punish the transgressors on behalf of the gods whose task is to maintain the proper relationships among men, namely Mitra, Varuṇa, and Aryaman (see vss. 8–9). It is striking that, unlike in many Indra hymns, we don’t simply call for Indra’s aid in battle against whatever enemies oppose us; in this hymn our enemies are characterized as moral failures.There is another way in which the poet appears to show his consciousness of his tradition—one that we might hesitantly call “intertextuality.” In verse 14 the poet seems to be consciously citing, with some variation, the famous Indra-Vr̥tra hymn I.32. He asks that after Indra’s exercise of vengeance the enemies “will lie” in a certain way: pr̥thivyā́ āpŕ̥g amuyā́ śáyante “will lie there . . . in the (same) way (as) the embracer of the earth.” It is difficult not to see this as a deliberate con-flation of two famous phrases describing Vr̥tra from I.32: 5d . . . śayata upapŕ̥k pr̥thivyā́ḥ “will lie as the embracer of the earth” and 8a . . . amuyā́ śáyānam “lying in that way.” This quotation and conflation of phrases from a particular, and no"},{"pageNumber":1553,"pageContent":"X.891536doubt well-known, poem seem quite different from the standard formulaic varia-tion of our traditional poets, and it is perhaps not surprising to encounter it in the Xth Maṇḍala, as the practice of traditional poetic composition was drawing to a close.1.

Its central symbol is the púruṣa, the “man,” “person,” or “human being.” On the surface, this"},{"pageNumber":1555,"pageContent":"X.901538hymn tells of the sacrifice of a giant man, from whose parts the world was created. The theme of creation through a cosmic sacrifice is widespread, but this hymn is not simply the retelling of an ancient tradition. The púruṣa here serves as a symbol of the sacrifice itself, which especially in the middle Vedic tradition is a locus of cre-ative power. The púruṣa is thus similar to the later divine figure Prajāpati, who in the Brāhmaṇas personifies the sacrifice. Indeed this late hymn represents a verse com-mentary on the sacrifice that prefigures the prose commentaries of the Brāhmaṇas. This hymn is also notable because it is the only R̥gvedic mention of the four varṇas, the hierarchical division of the social order that forms the theoretical basis for the caste system. One reason that the hymn may have been included in the R̥gveda to provide a R̥gvedic charter for such a division of society.The identity of the Man and the sacrifice is established in the opening verse, for his thousand heads, eyes, and feet recall Agni, the sacrificial fire, and his macro-cosmic equivalent, the Sun (cf. Brown 1931: 109–10). The Man comprehends the earth and extends beyond it. As Mus (1968: 549) has pointed out, the “ten-fingers’ breadth” by which he exceeds the world measures from the Man’s hairline to his mouth. The Man’s mouth represents speech, which marks the boundary between the imperceptible world of thought and the perceptible world created by speech. His mouth is also associated with eating, and in verse 2 the Man rises beyond the world “through food,” that is, by making the world his food. In later texts the “eater” is the master and the “eaten” is one who benefits the master (cf. Rau 1957: 34–35). The image may therefore reflect the Man’s dominance over the world. See also X.125, in which the mouth is similarly both the locus of speech and the locus of eating.This theme of dominance or rule continues also in verse 5 in the mutual genera-tion of the Man and the Virāj. The word virā́j can mean either “brilliant” or “ruling, rule.” The latter is the more likely sense here, and therefore this word connects the hymn to Vedic ideals of the king, who in his consecration encompasses the world in a similar way that the Man does here (Proferes 2007: esp. ch. 3). Since the term virā́j is grammatically feminine, it complements púruṣa, which is masculine in grammar and connotation.The Man is the “offering” (vs. 6), the sacrificial victim (vs. 15), but more espe-cially he is the sacrifice itself that the gods, the Sādhyas, and seers performed (vs. 7). Through this sacrifice the elements of subsequent sacrifices emerged: the “clotted-mixture” (vs. 8), the verses, chants, meters, and sacrificial formulae (vs. 9), and the sacrificial animals (vs. 10). The parts of the sacrifice also became the three upper varṇas (vss. 11–12): his mouth the brahmins, masters of knowledge and speech; his arms the rulers, the possessors of power; and his thighs the freemen or clansmen, who are the productive support of society. These three classes form parts of the sacrifice because they can participate in the sacrifice. The śūdras or “servants” are not part of the sacrifice but rather emerge from the feet of the Man, a symbol of their low social status and their exclusion from the sacrifice. Finally, the elements of the cosmos and gods themselves come forth from the sacrifice (vss. 13–14). This primeval sacrifice thus establishes the “first foundations” for the performance of the"},{"pageNumber":1556,"pageContent":"X.901539sacrifice or even for the ritual, social, divine, and visible worlds more generally (vs. 16ab), and it creates access to heaven (16cd).The identity of the Sādhyas (in vss. 7 and 16) is not clear. Their name means “those to be brought to success,” and they appear to be ancient sacrificers whose proper ritual performance has “perfected” them and who have attained god-like status or the status of gods.1. The Man has a thousand heads, a thousand eyes, and a thousand feet.Having covered the earth on all sides, he extended ten fingers’ breadth beyond.2. The Man alone is this whole (world): what has come into being and what is to be.Moreover, he is master of immortality when he climbs beyond (this world) through food.3. So much is his greatness, but the Man is more than this:a quarter of him is all living beings; three quarters are the immortal in heaven.4. With his three quarters the Man went upward, but a quarter of him came to be here again.From there he strode out in different directions toward what eats and what does not eat.5. From him the Virāj was born; from the Virāj the Man.Upon his birth, he reached beyond the earth from behind and also from in front.6. When, with the Man as the offering, the gods extended the sacrifice,spring was its melted butter, summer its firewood, autumn its offering.7. On the ritual grass they consecrated that sacrifice, the Man, born at the beginning.With him the gods sacrificed, (also) the Sādhyas and those who were seers.8. From that sacrifice, when it was offered in full, the clotted-butter mixture was collected.It [=the sacrifice] was made into the animals: those of the air (and both) those that belong to the wilderness and those that belong to the village.9. From this sacrifice, when it was offered in full, the verses and chants were born.Meters were born from it. The sacrificial formula—from it that was born.10. From it horses were born and whatever animals have teeth in both jaws.Cows were born from it. From it were born goats and sheep.11. When they apportioned the Man, into how many parts did they arrange him?What was his mouth? What his two arms? What are said to be his two thighs, his two feet?"},{"pageNumber":1557,"pageContent":"X.91154012. The brahmin was his mouth.

The poet of this hymn is especially fond of etymological figures (especially in the first few verses) and chaining between verses (note, e.g., vss. 8d/9a, 10/11).The hymn covers many familiar themes, contrasting the physical fire (e.g., vss. 5–7) with the deified fire and his ritual roles, but it is the latter aspect of Agni that is dominant.1.

This initial similarity may account for the placement of the hymn in the maṇḍala. Two Agni verses also close the hymn (14–15) in a ritual context.What lies between seems to lack structure and logical progression. Some verses contain an odd assortment of divinities and semi-divinities (e.g., vss. 4–5, 11–13); Rudra and/or the Maruts recur in several verses (5–6, 9). Fragments of familiar myths appear without further development—for example, Indra’s interference with the horses of the Sun in verse 8—and other verses contain apparent references to other stories of which we know nothing (e.g., vs. 10). In short, despite some pleas-ing passages, the hymn mostly yields frustration.1.

The syntax of the hymn is also quite sketchy, with many verbs missing and with nominal forms often apparently merely juxtaposed rather than being linked by normal case relations, and the identity of the referents in many verses is obscure.The reasons for the choice of the gods honored and their sequence are also not clear. The hymn begins with a verse to Heaven and Earth, who recur in verse 10. Verses 2–3 treat the gods in general, while verse 4 begins to name names, starting with the Ādityas. The next three verses (5–7) form a relatively well-organized unit, with a focus on the Aśvins and a shared opening (utá naḥ “and us”). The end of verse 7 provides a transition to verse 8, with the R̥bhus and their master, Indra, who also appears in verses 9 and 11. The poet summarizes his poem in verse 12 (with more pride than we would perhaps allow him). Verses 13–15 constitute a dānastuti, mentioning a number of patrons. Note that the name that the Anukramaṇī supplies for the poet has simply been extracted from the name(s) of one or more patrons in verse 15.1. Become greatly wide, o Heaven and Earth; the two world-halves are always like exuberant young women for us.With these (gods?) protect us from one more powerful; with them protect us when (he is) swollen with strength.2. At every sacrifice that mortal honors the godswho, of longest fame, seeks to entice them here with benevolent thoughts."},{"pageNumber":1562,"pageContent":"X.9315453.

The stones are animatized throughout—as human workers, as hungry bulls, as birds, as antelopes, as horses. But there is special emphasis on them as speakers. The first four verses begin with “speaking” verbs (and often continue with them), with a variant phrase beginning verse 5, and the last two verses (13–14) echo these verbs. These last two verses treat the unhitching of the stones, their task completed, and the last pāda of verse 14 rather poignantly not only releases them but de-animatizes them: they are now perceived as just stones.1. Let them speak forth; let us speak forth. Speak a speech to the pressing stones that are speaking,when, o stones, o mountains, all together you swift ones possessed of soma bear your signal-call, your cry to Indra.2. They speak as if in hundreds, in thousands. They roar with their golden mouths.Having toiled at their good work, the good workers, the stones, have achieved the eating of the oblation even before the Hotar.3. They speak; in this way they found the honey. They growl over the cooked flesh.Gnawing at the branch of the reddish tree, the gluttonous bulls have bellowed out to it.4. They speak loftily by reason of the delighting delightful (soma). Shrieking to Indra, in this way they found the honey.(Fit) to be clasped by the sisters [=fingers], the clever ones have danced, making the earth heed with their trampling.5. The eagles have raised their speech up to heaven. In their lair the black antelopes have danced vigorously."},{"pageNumber":1564,"pageContent":"X.941547Down they go downward to the rendezvous with the lower one.

He accosts her on her journey (presumably back to her fellow Apsarases) and demands that they discuss what went wrong with their marriage (vs. 1). He reminisces about her beauty (vs. 3) and her good wifely ways (vs. 4), while she impatiently dismisses him (vs. 2) and provides her own view of her service as wife (vs. 5). The next verses (6–11) primarily concern the crowd of Apsarases who attended Urvaśī when she gave birth to her and Purūravas’s son Āyu. Purūravas evinces some jealousy about (as well as some physical attraction to) these females with whom he competed for Urvaśī’s attention and to whom she is returning, while Urvaśī here implies that Purūravas should have his mind on more manly matters than love, such as military protection (esp. vss. 7 and 11; see also the ironic vocative “hero” in 5).Urvaś ī attempts to dismiss Purūravas again (vs. 11). He tries another tack to keep her from leaving: how can she separate him from his loving son (vs. 12)—to which she briskly replies that she’ll send him the kid, chillingly referred to in the neuter, back to him (vs. 12). The second half of this verse forms a ring with the second half of verse 2, her first speech: she seems thus to be trying to bring the conversation to a close. But Purūravas raises the stakes: with masterfully expressed self-pity he then suggests that he may disappear or die (and won’t she be sorry then . . . ?, vs. 14). Urvaśī wearily talks him out of it (vss. 15–16). He tries one more time (vs. 17), using a grander and more solemn linguistic register. The hymn ends with a somewhat enigmatic summary verse (18) containing the gods’ address to Purūravas at the end of this affair. Because Purūravas’s connection with the immortal Apsaras (note that Apsarases are called “immortal” in vs. 9) was severed and his son was returned to him, the mortal, he is bound to death, and his offspring will relate to the gods as mortals do, by sacrifice. But he will nonetheless later receive a joyous afterlife in heaven. (It is noteworthy that this is the only occurrence of the word svargá “heaven” in the R̥gveda.)One of the many extraordinary features of this brief masterpiece is the way it replicates the shifting emotional logic, the abrupt changes of tone and subject, and the twisting of the other’s words characteristic of a genuine marital quarrel of whatever era and culture, while presenting us with pictures of great beauty, however difficult the language is to interpret in many places. It is also uncompromising in its depiction of a resolute and hard-hearted female, unmoved by the abject pleas and emotional blackmail of her former lover who is still in love with her, anxious to return to her carefree life with her fellow Apsarases, and happy enough to abandon her child in order to get free.There are several well-known later versions of this story. The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa XI.5.1 embeds many of the R̥gvedic verses into a prose narrative, which"},{"pageNumber":1566,"pageContent":"X.951549seems to have misunderstood, deliberately or not, several of the crucial verses. And one of the three surviving plays of the great Classical Sanskrit poet Kālidāsa is a much expanded treatment of the pair’s love affair. No subsequent version can toler-ate the radical portrait of the emotionally detached Urvaśī found in the R̥gveda; in all cases the separation of the former lovers is not the result of the female’s decision, but of a curse. In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, a creative misreading of verse 3—involv-ing bleating pet lambs tied to a bedpost, a thunderstorm, and the provision that Urvaśī never see Purūravas naked—results in Urvaśī’s disappearance. In Kālidāsa’s play the curse has no connection to anything in the R̥gvedic hymn: a love-besotted Urvaśī brings it on herself by uttering her beloved Purūravas’s name at the wrong time. (In both versions the portrayal of Purūravas does retain his own passion for Urvaśī; in fact in Kālidāsa’s play he goes mad after she disappears and asks birds, beasts, and trees, in the late Middle Indo-Aryan language variety Apabhraṃśa, about her whereabouts.) It is an interesting commentary on the changing fortunes of female figures that the hard edges of the R̥gvedic Urvaśī must be softened to make her acceptable in later literature.1. [Purūravas:] “Woe, wife! Thoughtfully—stand still, fearsome woman!—let us two now exchange words.These thoughts, if unuttered, will not bring us joy even on a distant day.”2.

[Urvaśī:] “Three times a day you used to pierced me with your rod, and you ‘filled it up’ [=had an erection] for me, who did not seek it.Purūravas, I followed your will. You were then the king of my body, you ‘hero.’ ”6.

Why will you speak without profit?”12. [Purūravas:] “When will my begotten son seek his father? (When) will he let a tear roll like a wheel, on recognizing (him [=his father])?Who keeps apart a married couple joined in mind as long as the fire will (still) blaze in (the house of) the parents-in-law?”13. [Urvaśī:] “I’ll give him an answer when he lets his tear roll. Like a wheel he screeches for kindly care.I will send it [=child] to you, that thing of yours that’s with us. Go away home. For you will not attain me, you fool.”14. [Purūravas:] “And if the gods’ pet should fly away today, never to return, to go to the most distant distance . . .Then he might lie in the lap of Dissolution. Then again the ravening wolves might eat him . . . ”15. [Urvaśī:] “O Purūravas, don’t die. Don’t fly away. Don’t let the unkindly wolves eat you.There exist no partnerships with women: they have hyenas’ hearts.”16.

As in III.44 we have rendered the former as “golden,” even in reference to the horses, and the latter as “gladden(ing),” as a close English equivalent of this play on words. A subsidiary pun is persistent through the hymn, involving the golden mace and the golden soma (see, e.g., vs. 3); the referent of the adjective is often not expressed, and the audience is free to fill in either or both. The context often allows either, and since they are identical in gender, there is no grammatical obstacle. Similar ambiguity is found between the golden horses and the golden soma (e.g., vs. 10). In other verbal twists the “wrong” qualifier is used, but the underlying pun evokes the “right” one. Thus in verse 4 the “gladdening” mace is compared to the sun, which should really be “golden.”1. I proclaim your two golden (horses) at the great rite of distribution. I prevail over the gladdening, exhilarating drink for you who are eager for it,the drink which, like ghee, drips with golden (drops). Let the songs enter you, whose form is golden.2.

The protagonists of this legend are Devāpi, a priest and poet, in fact the Hotar and Purohita (at this late stage in the R̥gveda this latter priestly role seems to have become established) for Śaṃtanu, presumably a king, and the god Br̥haspati. The first four verses consist of a dialogue between Devāpi (vss. 1, 3), Br̥haspati (vs. 2), and, in our view, Śaṃtanu (vs. 4, though some schol-ars consider this verse the speech of Br̥haspati). Devāpi requests Br̥haspati to act as intermediary for him, asking the appropriate god to send rain. Devāpi must have made this request standing by the ritual fire, for in verse 2 Br̥haspati identifies Agni as their go-between and then provides Devāpi with a speech, presumably a charm that can provoke rain. Devāpi acknowledges this gift in verse 3, and in verse 4 Śaṃtanu asks Devāpi to perform sacrifice.The next three verses (5–7) summarize the successful outcome of this story.

[Br̥haspati:] “The quick messenger god [=Agni], taking cognizance, went from you, Devāpi, to me.Turn here, face to face in front of me: I place heaven-bright speech in your mouth.”3. [Devāpi:] “Place heaven-bright speech in us, in our mouth, o Br̥haspati, speech that is invigorating and free from affliction,by which we two will win rain for Śaṃtanu. The honeyed drop of heaven has entered (me).”4. [Śaṃtanu?:] “Let the honeyed drops enter us. O Indra, give a thousand (cows) with a chariot in addition.Sit down to the office of Hotar; sacrifice according to the ritual sequence. O Devāpi, honor the gods with an oblation.”5.

In this higher sea the waters stood still, confined by the gods.They ran, sent gushing by the son of R̥ṣṭisena, impelled by Devāpi in currycomb tracks [=rivulets].7. When Devāpi, installed as Purohita for Śaṃtanu and chosen for the office of Hotar, reflected with longing,Br̥haspati, bestowing, gave him speech audible to the gods, winning rain.8.

On the other hand, the structure and progression of the hymn are surprisingly clear. Although it is an Indra hymn, at least according to the Anukramaṇī, the name Indra does not appear until the very last verse, the poet’s summary verse (12b), and then only once. In fact the hymn contains almost no divine names: Rudras (in the plural, perhaps of the Maruts, perhaps not, in vs. 5) and Varuṇa in a simile in verse 10. The first four verses contain no names at all, and though subsequent verses do contain a number of them, most of these are names of enemies or of mortals aided by the gods. As in many other difficult hymns the avoidance of names seems to be meant to keep the referents deliberately unclear, and the contorted phraseology and allusions to otherwise unknown stories, especially in the earlier parts of the hymn, seem designed to keep the audience guessing and in some cases to deliberately mis-lead them. As the hymn goes on, Indra’s identity becomes clearer, as in verse 9 with the Śuṣṇa/Kutsa saga. (On this obscure verse see also Jamison 2009d [2013].)The grammar mirrors this gradual progress toward the recognition and perhaps the epiphany of Indra. The hymn begins in verse 1 with questions about the identity of the referents, an indication of maximal uncertainty. The next seven and a half verses (2–9ab) display an advance toward certainty: almost every half-verse begins with the pronoun sá “he,” suggesting that the poet has a definite referent in mind, however vague it may be to the audience. But sá is a discourse pronoun: it does not indicate where the referent is located. Starting with the second half of verse 9 the next four half-verses begin with a form of the deictic pronoun ayám “this one here,” strongly pointing to a referent in the immediate vicinity of the speaker. These ayám forms may signal the actual presence, the epiphany, of Indra, arrived at the sacrificial ground.1.

But it slowly becomes clear that the sacrifice is not simply a physical procedure, but is intimately bound up with our emotional well-being (see esp. vss. 5c and 6c). Moreover, in verse 7 it becomes the site of our declaration of innocence before the gods, a sort of “truth formulation,” though without all the formal marks of the truth formulation. At this point the refrain becomes an integral part of the verse to which it is attached. Having thus affirmed our blamelessness, we can now ask for the dangers that beset us to be banished (vss. 8–9) and for prosperity and healing to attend us (vs. 10). That the soma sacrifice is the setting for these pleas and that the elements of the ritual facilitate their fulfillment is shown by the promi-nence of the pressing stones (vss. 8–9) and the mixing milk for the soma (vs. 10).The happy conclusion of the sacrifice is depicted in verse 11, the last verse with the refrain. The final verse (12), in a different meter, is a somewhat curious mixture. The first half is addressed to an unidentified referent—quite possibly Agni, since the compound “having bright radiance” is ordinarily used of him (though once of Indra and once of Savitar)—with a slightly sinister reminder slipped into the second pāda that there are still enemies around who are thriving. The second half looks like a fragment of a dānastuti, but there are no further clues as to how it might fit into the rest of the hymn.1. O Indra, stand fast, bounteous one.

The preparation of soma is then compared to raising water from a well (vss. 5–7) for livestock. The preparation of the soma advances through a series of changing images (vss. 8–10), ending with a surprisingly eroticized pair of verses (11–12).1. Wake up of one mind, o comrades. Kindle the fire together, you who are many, but from the same nest.I call down Dadhikrā, Agni, and goddess Dawn, all accompanied by Indra, to aid you.2.

These contrasting views are set out in separate signed discussions in the following introduction.SWJThis famous and famously enigmatic hymn presents an intriguing scenario: a char-iot race (or a chariot drive) in which a man named Mudgala decisively wins the stakes, with the help of Indra, despite using unorthodox equipment and personnel that seem destined to fail him. His charioteer is his wife Mudgalānī (see vs. 2) and the team drawing the chariot seems to consist of a boisterous and ill-controlled bull yoked with an inert piece of wood (see esp. vss. 9–10). Or so is our best guess; the depiction of the race is oblique and narratively shattered.Not surprisingly the hymn has provoked much discussion, both about the bare “facts” of the chariot race and about the meaning and purpose of the hymn as a whole. There are two major and interconnected thematic strands motivating the hymn, and these converge in the figure of Mudgalānī and are expressed especially clearly in verse 11, where Mudgalānī recovers her husband, and the pair burgeon with apparent fertility—he “dripping” and she “swelling.” She is there also identi-fied as a “(once) avoided wife,” in later śrauta ritual a technical term for one of the king’s wives, avoided presumably because she failed to produce offspring. So, on"},{"pageNumber":1579,"pageContent":"X.1021562one level the hymn depicts the recovery of fertility and the future production of offspring in Mudgala’s line. The hovering presence and aid of the hyper-virile Indra and the emphasis throughout the hymn (see esp. vss. 4–6) on his animal stand-in, the bull pulling the chariot, reinforces this message. Mudgalānī’s sexual nature is suggested by our first glimpse of her, with the wind lifting her garment (vs. 2a), and in a particularly startling verse (6) the droppings of the defecating bull keep hitting the woman who is driving him—an image that suggests, as it subverts, sexual con-tact between the bull and the woman. If this bull stands in for Indra, its yokemate, the wooden club, may represent an impotent Mudgala, and the announcement in verse 10 that the wooden club has now been “made to mount” may signal that Mudgala has, paradoxically, recovered his sexual potency by association with the bull/Indra.The other thematic strand is a ritual one. In my opinion this hymn takes part in the disguised dialogue in the late R̥gveda about the ritual innovation, the introduc-tion of the Sacrificer’s Wife, the ritual patnī, into solemn sacrificial practice. As we have discussed elsewhere, various hymns and sections thereof seem to favor or oppose this innovation, but always in the guise of another discourse. This hymn seems strongly in favor of the introduction of the patnī. It begins with a pun, whose implications are worked out through the rest of the hymn. The first pāda of the hymn introduces Mudgala’s chariot, which is mithūkŕ̥tam. This word is generally translated “wrongly functioning, falsely made” or the like, and that is surely one of its implications here: the chariot is defective. But it can also mean “making/forming a sexual pair,” and this is a very apt description of the new ritual model, with the Sacrificer and his Wife the pair associated with the chariot, a common metaphor for the sacrifice. The rest of hymn can be read as an extended metaphorical treatment of the new ritual model, using the same image of the sacrifice as chariot—with the Wife is charioteer, not yokemate of the Sacrificer as in some other contributions to the discussion (see, e.g., VIII.33.18). The emphasis throughout the hymn on the unorthodox and makeshift nature of the equipment and the surprising outcome in victory signals that the ritual partnership between husband and wife is a new, untried model, which nonetheless brings even more success than the old one. The happy outcome of the hymn, the recovery of her husband and the swelling fertility of Mudgalānī (vs. 11), reminds us of the relentless stress on the Wife’s raison d’être in classical śrauta ritual as representative of sexuality and fertility in all their forms (see Jamison 1996a: esp. ch. 3, sect. C–E).JPBAlternatively, the hymn may have been composed to accompany a rite of niyoga, in which a surrogate is appointed as a substitute for an impotent or dead husband. Mudgala is the dead or impotent husband, but Mudgalānī has been able win off-spring for him by finding a “bull,” a potent man, who can impregnate her and secure"},{"pageNumber":1580,"pageContent":"X.1021563the continuation of Mudgala’s lineage. In this interpretation, the “wooden club” in verse 9 is a symbol of the potency of the surrogate, rather than the impotence of Mudgala, especially if the “racecourse” in the middle of which it lies is a figure for the body of Mudgalānī. Verse 6 provides a possible clue to the application of this hymn. If the praise of Indra in verse 12 is taken as extra-hymnic, verse 6 is the center of the hymn, the place where the secrets of hymn are often disclosed (or buried even more deeply). It begins kaka﻿́rdave vr̥ṣabho﻿́ yukta﻿́ āsīt. Unfortunately, as noted below, the meaning of kaka﻿́rdave is uncertain. (It might be dative “for making kaka” as translated below, but it might also be locative “in the creaking one,” referring to the cart driven by Mudgalānī.) But the rest of the pāda is simple and clear: “the bull was yoked.” Again in pāda c, the poet repeats that the bull was “yoked.” The reason for poet’s insistence on this detail may be that yukta﻿́ “yoked” in this key verse points to the etymologically related “niyoga,” the hymn’s ritual context.For further discussion of this hymn see Brereton (2002) and Jamison (2011 and forthcoming a).1.

The early parts of the hymn present Indra as the unconquerable conqueror. Stylistically this part is marked by repetition and especially by the chaining of key lexical items from the end of one verse to the beginning of the next. Curiously, X.84, a hymn to “Battle Fury,” also shows this type of concatenation, and so it may be that stitching verses together in this way creates a sort of magically impenetrable verbal armor.In the course of the hymn the focus shifts from exclusive concentration on Indra to our warriors and the inspiration Indra’s model should provide for them to per-form heroically in battle. Our men are first addressed already in the second half of verse 2, but it is in verse 6 and then in verses 10–13 that the application of Indra’s behavior to that of our men and the transference of his skills and courage to them really come to the fore.1.

Like X.89, another Indra hymn of the Xth Maṇḍala ascribed to a Vaiśvāmitra and ending with the same refrain, this hymn seems like a self-consciously old-fashioned composition, falling squarely into the genre of “journey” hymn, in which Indra is invited to come with his horses to the soma-pressing. That praise poetry is at least equally important as soma at the sacrifice is made abundantly clear throughout the hymn. Toward the end (starting with vs. 8), the hymn turns to the topic of the Vr̥tra myth and, especially, Indra’s freeing of the waters after his defeat of Vr̥tra.1. The soma has been pressed for you, o much-invoked one. With your pair of fallow bays, drive swiftly to the sacrifice.The songs, having poets for heroes, making their way, have run to you, Indra.

Despite the Anukramaṇī analysis it is better analyzed as consisting mainly of verses with a seven-syllable middle pāda, and one or more triṣṭubh pādas before and/or after. See Oldenberg (1888: 158–59).The hymn also poses many problems of interpretation, and the metrical and ver-bal anomalies have led many commentators to consider the text corrupt—a judg-ment by which we are tempted. Even if not corrupt, the text is stylistically abrupt, contorted, and compressed, and many puzzles remain unsolved. The hymn also appears to be jocular in places, making sly fun of Indra and cutting him down to size. This is especially clear in the section devoted to Indra’s pair of fallow bay horses (vss. 2–5), where the poet implies that without his horses Indra is nothing"},{"pageNumber":1585,"pageContent":"X.1051568much: it’s the horses that give him prestige (see esp. vss. 3–4).

Structured like another Aśvin hymn, II.39, it presents a blizzard of similes—generally one each pāda, four to a verse—with the two gods compared to all manner of animals, people, body parts, and cosmic features. Unfortunately the style goes far beyond the recon-dite to the utterly incomprehensible, with impossible hapaxes of unusual morpho-logical structure, seemingly in part driven by phonological play. These words may be archaic or dialectal or slang or belong to specific technical fields or borrowed/adapted from a substrate language or playfully generated from morphological tem-plates—or, as has been suggested, the middle section may be written in a kind of code, with phoneme-by-phoneme substitution. Or all of the above, and more.In any case, following the eminently sensible lead of Geldner (implicitly endorsed by Oldenberg and Renou), we have simply left the middle verses (5–8) untranslated, while attempting to wring sense from the outer frame. Although many ingenious attempts have been made to interpret the baffling lexical items in this hymn and more could have been made, such attempts remain just that—exercises in ingenuity. It seems more honest, as well as truer to the spirit of the hymn, evidently designed to challenge the decoding skills of the most proficient and experienced hearers, to acknowledge its impenetrable center. From this several observations emerge. First, this appears to be the ultimate omphalos hymn. In most omphalos hymns the center holds the mystery, but the mystery is expressed in words whose purport can be puz-zled out. Here that mysterious center deliberately defies analysis by being expressed in words that are tantalizingly close to familiar word-types, but whose code cannot be cracked—and rendered all the more frustrating by the presence of real, analyz-able words in the midst of the semi-gibberish. The hymn takes the notion of an omphalos and carries it as far as it can go, suggesting that many mysteries will remain beyond our apprehension, or at least our apprehension by verbal means.The outer verses (1–4, 9–11) reveal further traces of poetic structure, espe-cially when compared with II.39 mentioned above. The parallels between the two hymns seem to be deliberate and self-consciously generated. They begin almost identically: the first pāda of II.39.1 (minus the opening simile) reads . . . ta﻿́d íd a﻿́rthaṃ jarethe “you two awaken to just this aim,” in sense and verbal expression almost identical to our ubhā́ u nūna﻿́ṃ ta﻿́d íd arthayethe “Now you both have just this as your aim,” with the “awaken” postponed until pāda c. The final verses of both hymns (II.39.8, X.106.11) are summary verses, announcing the hymn just completed (interestingly called a mantra in this hymn) and urging the Aśvins to drive to the hymn and the sacrifice. In between are a varying number of verses, constructed as webs of similes, most of which are more complex and clever than the general run of R̥gvedic similes. It thus seems that this hymn-type provides a"},{"pageNumber":1587,"pageContent":"X.1061570template, which could generate within it an unlimited number of inventive com-parisons. It is not hard to imagine this process as a competitive one, with poets vying to use the most outre﻿́ words and over-strained and mannered images, all contained and controlled by the overall structure of the template. In our hymn we return to discipline from the unruly center via several verses of reasonably com-prehensible similes (vss. 9–10) to reach, with some relief, the safe shore of verse 11. (It may not be entirely fanciful to suggest that the first simile in the return verses [9a] promises “firm standing in the depths”—something the audience has surely been seeking, in vain.)1.

The hymn sel-dom strays from its point—that a dakṣiṇā, once given, brings untold benefits to the giver, both material and spiritual, far exceeding the value of the original gift. It is a persuasive, if somewhat monotone, piece of work.1. Their great generosity has been revealed. All life has been freed from darkness;the great light, given by the forefathers, has come. The wide path for the priestly gift has become visible.2. High above in heaven have they taken their stand—those providing the priestly gift. Those who give horses, they (come) together with the sun;those giving gold receive a share in immortality; those giving garments extend their own lifetime, o Soma.3. The priestly gift is the divine bestowal, a sacrificial offering to the gods; it is not for the stingy, for they do not bestow.But many men who present priestly gifts bestow through fear of disgrace.4. Those with manly sight see (it as) the wind with its hundred streams (of rain), (as) the chant that finds the sun; they see (it as) the oblation.Those who bestow and present at the (sacrificial) assembly, they milk the priestly gift with its seven mothers.5. The provider of the priestly gift goes as the first invited; the provider of the priestly gift goes to the front as the leader of the horde.I think just he is the lord of peoples—the one who first sought out the priestly gift.6.

This dialogue takes place in the midst of a narrative whose outlines are clear, even if its details are not. The Paṇis have entrapped cattle in a cave. Indra and the ancient Vedic seers wish to release the cattle. Therefore, Indra sends his dog Saramā to track down the Paṇis and to demand the release of the cattle. She crosses the Rasā, the river at the border of the world that separates heaven and earth, and finds the Paṇis. The Paṇis refuse to surrender the cattle, however, and at the end Indra and the seers—the Aṅgirases and Navagvas—themselves come to the place where the Paṇis have hidden the cattle. They break open the cave through the power of the hymns they compose and chant. Because Indra’s weapon in this story is not the vajra, the mace with which he destroys Vr̥tra, but the truth embodied in the hymns that Indra and the seers recite, Indra is here called Br̥haspati, “Lord of the Sacred Formulation.”The story also tells of the coming of the dawns, since the power of Indra’s and the seer’s words lies in the secret truth that the cattle are the dawns. Note that at the"},{"pageNumber":1590,"pageContent":"X.1081573end, the poet uses the power of this truth for his own ends: through the truth of his hymn, he should acquire or recover cattle.Despite the seriousness of the theme, it is hard to believe that the audience did not relish the depiction of a talking dog, especially one as saucy and forthright as the faithful Saramā, who resists the offered blandishments of the Paṇis, to remain loyal to her master Indra.1. [Paṇi:] Seeking what has Saramā arrived here, for far is the road, swallowing up (the traveler) in the distance?What is your mission to us? What was the final turn (bringing you here)? How did you cross the waters of the Rasā?2.

What is his appearance?—he as whose messenger you raced here from afar?If he will come here, we will make an alliance with him, and then he will become the cowherd of our cattle.4. [Saramā:] I know him not as one who can be deceived. He will deceive!—he as whose messenger I raced here from afar.Deep flowing rivers do not hide him. Smashed by Indra, Paṇis, you will lie still.5. [Paṇi:] These cattle that you sought, Saramā, as you were flying around the ends of heaven, fortunate one—who will release them to you without a fight? And our battle weapons are sharp!6. [Saramā:] Your words are no weapons, Paṇis! Let your evil bodies be impervious to arrowsor let the path to you be impossible to follow—either way, Br̥haspati will have no mercy on you!7. [Paṇi:] This treasury with its foundation of rock is overflowing with cows, horses, and goods, Saramā.The Paṇis, who are good herdsmen, guard it. In vain have you come on an empty track.8. [Saramā:] The seers, sharpened by soma, will come here to this place: Ayāsya [=Indra], the Aṅgirases, and the Navagvas.They will divide up this pen of cattle. Then will the Paṇis just vomit this speech (of theirs)!9. [Paṇi:] Even though you have come in this way, Saramā, compelled by divine power,I shall make you my sister. Do not go back.

The topic of the hymn is the “Brahmin’s wife,” mentioned explicitly in verses 2–7, and in particular the “giving back” of the Brahmin’s wife. The currently prevailing opinion about the hymn (see espe-cially Geldner and Doniger O’Flaherty) is that it represents an early version of the story in the Viṣṇu Purā ṇa (IV.6.5) in which King Soma abducts the wife of Br̥haspati, the guru of the gods, and ultimately is forced to return her. Needless to say, the chronological difference—the several millennia intervening between the R̥gveda and the Viṣṇu Purā ṇa—should make this connection a disfavored one unless no other possible interpretations can be found. And it is also the case that the R̥gvedic hymn lacks almost all the salient features of the purāṇic story, includ-ing the abduction.We instead believe that the hymn relates to the much-debated issue in the late R̥gveda about the introduction of the Sacrificer’s Wife into ritual performance (see, e.g., nearby X.102), and that the poet both recognizes the perils of this new ritual practice and reassures his audience that all will be well. The hymn has an omphalos structure: the first and last verses (1 and 7) concern the “offense” (kílbiṣa) implicitly done to the Brahmin (husband of the woman in question) by separating him from his wife and placing her in the ritual arena, where she interacts with the gods and acts as conduit of the fearsome forces unleashed by the sacrifice. Her contact with the gods is potentially adulterous, and, given the power of the gods, there is also the danger that they will not want to release her at the end of the ritual. But these possible dangers do not arise: the inner ring of the hymn (vss. 2, 6) emphatically states that the gods have given her back without rancor, and the kílbiṣa is expiated in the final verse (7).The middle verses (3–5) concern the wife’s activities on the ritual ground and their importance. It is she who “places what is difficult to place in the highest dis-tant heaven” (vs. 4), in our view a reference to her role in mediating between the"},{"pageNumber":1592,"pageContent":"X.1091575earthly and divine realms especially in the animal sacrifice: she figuratively depos-its the oblation in heaven by touching and ritually preparing the sacrificed ani-mal. The most difficult verse is 5, which also contains the only R̥gvedic occurrence of the word brahmacārín (already in the Atharvaveda a word for “Vedic student” and later a standard way of referring to a man practicing chastity). Although the verse remains enigmatic, it is possible that it suggests that a single ritual performer (reciter of formulations) is necessary but not sufficient, and it is for this reason that the Wife has been introduced into ritual practice.The hymn is also saturated with wedding vocabulary (“grasp the hand,” “lead,” etc.). This domestic ritual, in which man and wife participate jointly, provides a reassuring model for the wife’s foray into the more solemn and serious realm of śrauta ritual.For more detailed discussion, see Jamison (forthcoming b).1.

The deposit is to be grasped only by her hand, just when they have announced: “Here is the Brahmin’s wife.”She does not stand for sending a messenger. In this way is the kingship of the ruler protected.4. The ancient gods and the seven seers, who settled down to ascetic fervor, conversed about her:“Fearsome is the wife of the Brahmin, when she is led close [/initiated]; she places what is difficult to place in the highest distant heaven.”5. The one who practices formulations keeps constantly laboring at his labors. He becomes (just) one limb of the gods.With him Br̥haspati discovered the (Brahmin’s) wife, who was led by Soma, as (you found) the sacrificial ladle [/tongue (=Agni)], o gods.6. The gods, verily, have given (her) back, and the sons of Manu (have given her) back;the kings [=Ādityas], making it come true, have given back the Brahmin’s wife.7.

This hymn follows the stan-dard Āprī pattern of course, but is notable for the amount of internal recycling of phraseology (see the echoes between vss. 2 and 10; 3 and 9; 4, 7, and 10; 4 and 8).

As often, the Vala and Vr̥tra myths are sometimes superimposed upon each other, with the cows/dawns of the former conflated with the waters (also female) of the latter. For example, the first pāda of verse 8 seems to continue the travels of the Dawns found in verse 7, but the next pāda makes it clear that the referent is actually the waters of the Vr̥tra myth.On the other hand, and especially in its first few verses, the hymn concerns itself with the interaction between poems and deeds. In verse 1 we poets rouse Indra by making his deeds real, that is, by celebrating them in poetry. In verse 2 the poetry almost seems to precede and stimulate the deed, and verse 3 provides us a picture of Indra whose knowledge of his own deeds seems to derive from hearing about them from poets. If our understanding of verse 4 is correct, the power of poetry to provoke the deeds it celebrates is put into the mythic past, with the Aṅgirases bring-ing Indra’s feats to realization by their hymns. Although this theme disappears in the rest of the hymn, to a poetically acute audience its resonances would probably still be felt in the more conventional treatment of Indra’s deeds that follows.1.

In depicting these various partnerships between Indra and various gods, the poet is establishing the model for a similar relationship between Indra and the present poets and sacrificers. In verse 8 he attributes to “all the gods” the ritual strengthening of Indra by means of praise poetry and soma—an exact parallel to mortals’ standard activity on behalf of Indra. In the first half of verse 9 in rather labored language he then addresses his fellow priest-poets, urging them to spell out to Indra their mutual acts of partnership—and providing in the second half of the verse a mythic example of Indra’s aid to a mortal in return for hospitality. (Dabhīti’s hospitality to Indra and Indra’s requital of it by rendering Dabhīti’s enemies Dhuni and Cumuri powerless are recounted elsewhere; see, e.g., VI.20.13 and VI.26.6.) Finally in verse 10 he addresses Indra directly, requesting goods from him. Interestingly, it seems that the poet is not asking for these goods for himself, but presumably for his patron, so that the patron in turn will consider the poet a successful wordsmith and reward him appropriately.1. Heaven and Earth, of one mind with all the gods, assisted his impetuous force.Creating his own greatness and Indrian power as he went, upon drinking the soma the resolute one increased.2.

This style is especially evident in the first verses of the hymn, while numerology comes more and more to dominate the later verses. Indeed, significant numbers are found from the very beginning (the two heats of vs. 1, the three dissolutions of vs. 2, the four braids and two eagles of vs. 3), but the manipulation of numbers begins in earnest with verses 4–5. These same two verses contrast the poet with his “simple mind,” who sees only one entity (vs. 4), with the inspired ones and sage poets (vs. 5), who use their words to make that single entity manifold. Even though many of the details of this enigmatic hymn remain obscure, we can see in this contrast the inherent message of the hymn, that insight and its verbal product, poetry, have the power to give shape and multiplicity to the perceptible world.1.

For example, verse 5 appears to fit the type of a hymn-ending summary verse, calling on the god for aid, but it interrupts the two most complex verses (vss. 4, 6) characterizing Agni as fire, which appear to belong together, however unclear some of the details are. The last three verses of the hymn (7–9), each in a different meter, provide three alterna-tive endings to the hymn, each with overt signals of a final summary verse: verse 7 (in the same meter as the first six verses) evā́ . . . stave “thus he is praised”; verse 8 . . . íti tvā . . . vandate . . . vā́k “so does the speech extol you”; and verse 9 íti tvā . . . avocan “so have they proclaimed you.” It is difficult to know what to do with this overabun-dance of finales.The descriptive verses (1–4, 6) repay attention, with bold images and multiple puns (e.g., druṣád in verse 3, literally “wood-sitting,” which is equally applicable to Agni sitting on firewood and to the two associated similes: a bird sitting in a tree and the soma-drop sitting in the wooden cup). As noted above, verses 4 and 6 are especially complex, and they have been variously interpreted. In our view these two verses concern Agni and his flames. In verse 4 he is surrounded by his flames, cleverly compared both to the very active winds and to immovable mountains, and they urge him, here identified, as sometimes elsewhere, as Trita, to mount an expedition. But in verse 6 his own flame concedes to his superior power, even as he seeks food in inhospitable places.

This hymn has no divine dedicand, but in the Anukramaṇī is termed a “praise of the gift of wealth and food.” There is, in fact, almost no mention of divinities or divine powers in the hymn, an almost unique situ-ation in the R̥gveda; the gods figure only in the first verse and there only obliquely. The emphasis is instead on the mutual relations between humans (comradeship; see, esp., vss. 3–4, 6) and the obligation of the fortunate to provide for those in need. Insofar as the R̥gveda treats the ethical responsibilities of men, ethical behavior is ordinarily mediated through the gods, especially Mitra and Varuṇa, but here there is no such mediation: the admonitions to behave properly to one’s fellow men are direct and no gods are represented as observing and judging human behavior.The argument for generosity is twofold and is couched not in purely ethical terms, but in terms of self-interest. On the one hand, giving does not do the giver any harm, as his stores do not become depleted. This sentiment is expressed most clearly in verse 1c, but it seems also to underlie the maxim-like verses 7 and 8. Verse 7 seems to be a version of the slightly vulgar English expression “use it or lose it,” while verse 8 suggests that sheer quantity isn’t the measure of power and effective-ness: the more “feet” an entity has, the less its autonomy and power. On the other hand, not giving does the ungenerous man actual harm. In part, the harm is simply the isolation produced by not acting in a comradely manner. As verse 6 says suc-cinctly, “who eats alone has only evil.” But it is also the case that one’s fortunes can change (see esp. vs. 5). Those who are rich and well fed today may find themselves in need in the future, and it is best to forge comradely ties by giving now, in case the situations of giver and receiver are reversed.The tone of the hymn is colloquial and conversational. A number of verses deploy what appear to be old sayings or popular adages, distilled folk wisdom, whose pertinence to the topic at hand is indirect and requires some figuring out. Because of their rarity in the high-register texts of early Vedic, such expressions are very precious, though they can be hard to penetrate."},{"pageNumber":1604,"pageContent":"X.1171587The Anukramaṇī identifies the poet as Bhikṣu (“beggar”) Āṅgirasa, a name pre-sumably suggested after the fact by the subject matter, especially since the word bhikṣu, though very common and culturally important in later times, does not occur in the R̥gveda or indeed any Vedic text that we know of.1. Truly the gods did not give hunger as the only deadly weapon, and the forms of death do come upon him who is well fed.Moreover, the wealth of one who gives does not become exhausted, and the non-giver finds no one to show mercy.2. Whoever—when a man, weak and broken, has approached desiring nourishment—though he has food,hardens his heart, though he always used to be his friend, he also finds no one to show mercy.3. Just he is a benefactor who gives to the beggar who, emaciated, goes roaming, desirous of food.He becomes sufficient for him at his pleading entreaty, and he makes him his companion in the future.4. He is no companion who does not give of his food to a companion, who, being in his company, accompanies him.He should turn away from him; this is not a home. He should seek another who gives, even a stranger.5. The stronger man should give to one in need. He should look along the longer path,for riches turn like chariot-wheels: they come up to one man after another.6. The undiscerning man finds food in vain. I speak the truth: it is just a deadly weapon for him.He does not prosper in compatriot, nor in companion. Who eats alone has only evil.7. It’s just when it plows that a plowshare makes a man well fed.

The exuberantly and ingeniously violent punishments envisaged in the other Rakṣohan hymn in X (X.87) are entirely absent. Instead the dominant picture is of a peaceful sacrificial hearth in which the fire responds happily to the attentions, and especially the butter oblations, of his worshipers. Stylistically the hymn is characterized by chaining: the repetition of a word or phrase from one verse in the next, with a different word or phrase from that verse repeated in the following one.1. O Agni, you strike down the devourer as you shine here among mortalsin your own dwelling place, o you of blazing commandment.2. You stand up when you are well bepoured.

Who the 1st-person speaker is meant to be has generated much discussion. The Anukramaṇī calls this the ātmastuti “self-praise” of a laba (a word that does not appear in the hymn or in the R̥gveda), a particular type of bird, the lapwing—while commentators have generally identified the speaker either as the poet or as a par-ticular god, usually Indra or Agni. We are inclined toward a version of the interpre-tation of George Thompson (2003). Thompson situates the hymn in the genre of ātmastuti, with its boastful self-assertion and the impersonation, or role-playing, by a poet of “a divine agent.” Under this interpretation, the speaker is fundamentally the poet, but the poet consciously taking on the voice and identity of another entity or entities—in our view, both that of a bird and that of a god, indeed of Indra.The presence of the poet is clearest in his claims about his mind and the thought that approaches him and that he shapes (vss. 1, 4–5). It is even possibly visible in the spirited refrain—“Have I drunk of the soma? Yes!”—in which the speaker inter-rogates himself and only after this internal verbal exchange asserts that he has con-sumed soma. (One might suggest, only partially in jest, that Indra would not need this verbal self-reassurance.) To characterize the soma-drinking experience the poet borrows the identity of a bird, suggesting that the overwhelming sensation is that of flight, lifting him up (vss. 2–3), making the people on the ground seem impossibly small and insignificant (vs. 6) and his own wings large enough to cover the cosmos (vss. 7, 11). But this prodigious creature cannot be only a bird, for the speaker boasts of his control of the cosmic spaces and his ability to move the earth at will (vss. 8–10). These boasts are most appropriate to Indra, who commonly manipulates cosmic enti-ties, who is most likely to engage in self-vaunting ātmastuti (cf., e.g., X.48–49), and who is the archetypal soma-drinker among the gods. The hymn ends (or almost ends) with the apparent epiphany of Indra in verse 12, triumphantly announced by “here I am” (ahám asmi) and calling attention to his presence in the ritual arena.The final verse (13) seems an anticlimax, and its contents also sit uneasily in the rest of the hymn. The identity that this 1st-person speaker claims, that of oblation-carrier (havyavā́hana), is responsible for the view that the speaker throughout the hymn is Agni, for havyavā́hana and its variant havyaváh are always epithets of that god. But the fact that Agni speaks this verse does not require that he be the speaker in the rest of the hymn. In our view this verse, like many final verses, marks a shift of subject or a coda. The speaker is indeed Agni. It seems possible that Indra’s epiphany in the pre-ceding verse has brought him face to face with the principal god of the ritual and the ritual ground, namely Agni, and that Agni borrows the rhetoric of Indra to make his own counter-boast and assert the importance of his own role—though his somewhat pedestrian self-comparison to a well-equipped household contrasts almost comically with the soaring and exuberant language of the rest of the hymn."},{"pageNumber":1607,"pageContent":"X.12015901.

There is special emphasis also on the relation between Indra and his verbally active “helpers.” The relationship is hierarchal—Indra is supreme—but also reciprocal, in that the helpers cheer him on and fortify him for his exploits (esp. vss. 1–4). The helpers are not named; the two most prominent Indra myths, Vr̥tra and Vala, both feature a troop aiding or encouraging Indra: the Maruts and the Aṅgirases respectively. It is thus possible that either or both groups are meant here, and, further, that human poets are assimilated to these divine choruses (see vs. 4)."},{"pageNumber":1608,"pageContent":"X.1201591The encouragement becomes more personal in verse 5, where a 1st-person speaker assumes the role of verbal inciter. This is surely the poet himself, but, we will claim, not a mere human poet. The last two verses of the hymn (8–9) summa-rize the performance context of the hymn. Verse 8 begins “Br̥haddiva speaks these sacred formulations to Indra,” and Br̥haddiva is named again as the poet in verse 9 (as well as being so identified by the Anukramaṇī). But verse 9 introduces a puzzle or a surprise, for it begins, “In this way Br̥haddiva addressed his own self—that is, Indra.” It is difficult to read the sentence in any other way, though many have tried, but if Indra is the same as Br̥haddiva, who is Br̥haddiva?A way to a solution to this conundrum has been presented by Hanns-Peter Schmidt, though he himself does not discuss this hymn. As Schmidt convincingly argues (1968), Br̥haspati was originally an epithet and aspect of Indra, especially in the Vala myth, in which Indra uses not brute strength but verbal skill to open the Vala cave and release the stolen cows. Br̥haspati becomes detached from Indra and treated as a separate god, but this process is a protracted one and can be observed happening in the R̥gveda. We suggest that this hymn reflects an awareness of their original identity and their growing separateness, with the verbally adroit Br̥haspati, master of sacred formulations (bráhman; see vss. 5d and 8a), praising his other self, the king and victorious warrior Indra. The name Br̥haddiva (lit., “possessing lofty heaven”) is reminiscent of Br̥haspati, and the sacred formula-tions he addresses to Indra in verse 8 precisely concern the Vala myth, the locus of their identification.1. Just this was the foremost among living beings, from which the mighty one of vibrant manly spirit was born.As soon as he is born, he melts down his rivals, while all his helpers cheer him on.2. Having grown strong through his swelling power, he of much might, as rival to the Dāsa, creates terror for him.On your winning the animate and the inanimate, (your helpers) bellow to you together at the presentation (of the soma), at the revels.3. All bend their will toward you, even when these helpers are twice or three times as many.“Send the sweeter than sweet surging together with the sweet. With honey, battle for that honey yonder.”4. For it is even in those words that at every revel the inspired poets cheer you on as you win the stakes.Stretch your mightier (bow) taut, bold one. Let the sorcerers of evil ways not deceive you.5. Through you we have become exultant in our battles, as we see before us the many fights to be fought.I rouse your weapons with my words; I hone your vital powers with my sacred formulation."},{"pageNumber":1609,"pageContent":"X.12115926.

Br̥haddiva speaks these sacred formulations fortissimo to Indra: “the first to win the sun,he has dominion over the great cowpen of the sovereign king, and he opened up all the doors that are his own.”9. In this way, great Br̥haddiva, the Atharvan, addressed his own self—that is, Indra.The stainless sisters, who stay by their mother, speed him with swelling strength and make him strong.X.121 (947) Ka “Who?”Hiraṇyagarbha Prājāpatya10 verses: triṣṭubhThis hymn takes the form of a cosmogony, but here the creative principle is unnamed or has no name. Rather than declaring its deity, the hymn’s refrain is a question: “Who is the god to whom we should do homage with our oblation?” Although without a name, the deity has a form. In the first verse the poet calls it hiraṇyagarbhá “the golden embryo” (vs. 1a), the yolk of an egg (cf. Lommel 1939), thus anticipating later myths of creation from a world-egg (e.g., Vāmana Purāṇa Saromāhātmya XXII.17). But the “golden embryo” is also the sun, which here is born as the center of the cosmos. Toward the end of the hymn, in verse 7, the poet gives the still unnamed principle a second identity not just as a god but as “the life of the gods” (devā́nām . . . ásuḥ). The last verse finally attaches a name to the unnamed principle, but this verse is a later addition (Oldenberg 1888: 248), reflect-ing a redactional effort not to leave the mystery of this principle unresolved. In that verse the deity is revealed to be Prajāpati, the “Lord of Creatures,” who in the Brāhmaṇas is both the creator god and the archetype of the sacrifice. Later tradition confirms the identity of this principle by understanding the constantly repeated ká “who?” to be a name of Prajāpati. Accordingly the Anukramaṇī desig-nates Ka as the deity of this hymn.In a very perceptive interpretation of the hymn Proferes (2007: 140–41) shows the relation of this hymn to the ideology of kingship. In the royal unction ritual the king is reborn by means of the unction waters as a being with the power and brilliance of the sun. This hymn reproduces the elements of that rite: the conception of an embryo"},{"pageNumber":1610,"pageContent":"X.1211593(vss. 1, 7) and a ruler (vss. 1, 2, 3), the waters (vss. 7, 8, 9) that bear an embryo (vs. 7), and the birth of fire (vs. 7). The unnamed principle encompasses the entire world (vss. 4, 5, 10), and its power extends in every direction (vs. 4) and over every being (vss. 2, 3, 8), as the king (ideally) is the master of the world, whose power extends everywhere. Likewise, the unnamed principle supports the world—making it firm (vs. 5) and steady (vss. 5, 6)—and gives it life (vss. 2, 7), as the king maintains and preserves the world.Structurally, the hymn is organized as an almost unbroken series of dependent clauses. The first series of relative clauses, hanging off the main clauses in verse 1, lasts from verses 2 through 6. Verse 7 then re-establishes the pattern, for it has a main clause, on which the relative clauses in verse 8 depend. The phrase “he alone existed” in verses 1b and 8c create a ring, which defines the boundaries of the main body of the hymn. Outside this ring and outside the main body of the hymn, verse 9 repeats in miniature the pattern of preceding verses. It has a main clause in 9a, which is followed by three more relative clauses and concluded by the refrain. The verse is an appeal to the unnamed deity to do no harm, making it also thematically distinct from the main body of the hymn. Like verse 10, it too may have been a later addition, as Thieme (1964: 69) has asserted.1. The golden embryo evolved in the beginning. Born the lord of what came to be, he alone existed.He supports the earth and the heaven here— – Who is the god to whom we should do homage with our oblation?2.

It is a fairly standard praise of Agni, deploying a wide range of his standard epithets and ritual roles and titles. The ritual is the complete focus of the hymn, and the rewards that the sacrificer will receive from properly performing it and serving Agni are also at the forefront. There is much recycling of vocabulary.1.

The subject is announced in the first words of the first verse: “this Seeker” (ayám vénaḥ), and the Anukramaṇī also attributes the hymn to the same figure, or his multiform: Vena Bhārgava. This poet is also cred-ited with the soma hymn IX.85 by the Anukramaṇī, and the last four verses of that hymn (9–12), which contain phraseology quite similar to X.123 and which we might term “Vena without Tears,” help clarify X.123. What is at issue is the common iden-tification of Soma and the Sun, united in the Seeker figure, who is also identified as a Gandharva (vss. 4 and 7) and as a bird (vss. 5–6). Most verses are applicable to either Soma or the Sun, and, as is common in hymns with such dual referents, the effort of fashioning phraseology that works for both referents accounts for many of the enigmas in the hymn, beginning with the birth and first appearance of the Seeker in verses 1–2.It is noteworthy that the Seeker is also eagerly sought: the inspired poets pursue him (vss. 1, 4, probably 6), as do women seeking a husband (vs. 2) and mothers (vs."},{"pageNumber":1613,"pageContent":"X.12315963)—both feminine references probably standing for the hymns produced by these poets. Needless to say, both Soma and the Sun are regularly the object of such poetic attentions, and the intimate bond between poets and what they celebrate is a prominent theme in the hymn.Less prominent, but perhaps not less important, is the theme of name-and-form. This first surfaces explicitly in verse 4, where it is their recognition of the form of the Seeker that inspires the poets’ longing for him. In the same verse the Seeker, as Gandharva, finds “the immortal names.” Later, in verse 7, this same Gandharva engenders his own names. These verses seem to adumbrate the later preoccupation with name and form as representing the creation of the multiplicity of objects in the world by the division of the formless into “forms” and the assignment of “names” to each in order to differentiate them. This theme is treated with great skill and subtlety also in III.38. In this hymn here the Gandharva’s engendering his own names in the penultimate verse of the hymn leads to a climax of sorts in the final verse (8), though one that is quite downplayed. In that final verse the undifferentiated figure of Soma/Sun is actually divided into its two constituent parts, though neither is mentioned by name. The first half of the verse concerns the drop (drapsá), a word regularly used of Soma, while the second half has as its subject bhānú “radiance,” which is especially characteristic of the Sun. Through the power of the poets’ perception of the true “form” of things and their ability to assign them “names,” Sun and Soma emerge at the end of the hymn as separate, though mutually dependent, entities.1. This Seeker here spurs on those females whose embryo is the dappled one—he whose afterbirth is light—in the measuring out of the airy realm.At the union of the waters and the sun, the inspired poets lick him with their thoughts like an infant (calf).2. The Seeker raises up a wave from the sea. The cloud-born one, the top of the delightful one has been sighted,as the glint on the back of truth, on its upper surface.

(For a brief characteriza-tion of many of these treatments see W. E. Hale [1986: 86–92], and for a recent and intriguing interpretation see Proferes [2007: 121–27].)The hymn begins with an address to Agni by Indra (vs. 1); Agni answers in verse 2 and, in many interpretations, continues to speak in verses 3 and 4—though I fol-low the opinion that Varuṇa and Soma are the speakers of those two verses. Indra returns as speaker in verses 5 and 6, addressed to Varuṇa and Soma respectively. The last four verses (7–10) appear to be the words of the poet.In his speech Indra is attempting to coax the other gods addressed to join him in his new sacrifice, leaving behind their old ways and their old kin group. The gods need little persuasion. After Indra promises to make him the oblation-bearer in verse 1, Agni agrees with alacrity to go “as a god, from the non-god” and “from my own fellowship to an alien lineage” (vs. 2). In verse 3 Varuṇa (if he is the speaker; otherwise Agni again) echoes this proposed journey, in the expression “I go from the non-sacrificial to the sacrificial portion,” while in verse 4 Soma (again, if he is the speaker) “chooses Indra” and “leaves the father,” ending the verse with the ring-ing declaration: “the kingship has made a revolution.”Thus the subject of the hymn seems to be nothing less than a radical politi-cal and religious reconfiguration, with shifting alliances leading to a fundamental"},{"pageNumber":1615,"pageContent":"X.1241598realignment of the major divinities and to a new sacrificial order and a new rule. What has intensified the scholarly debate about this hymn is the assumed identity of the losing side. In verse 3 we find “Father Asura” (or “the lordly father”), pre-sumably the same father that Soma leaves after choosing Indra in verse 4. In verse 5 Indra asserts that the Asuras (or “lords”) have lost their māyā or “magic powers,” while the first divinity to leave, Agni, begins verse 2 with the emphatic ádevād deváḥ “from a non-god (I) a god . . . ” It has thus been difficult not to consider this hymn in the context of the vexing question about the Asura–Deva rivalry so prominent in Vedic prose, mirrored in the Avestan Ahura–Daēuua split, but complicated by the R̥gveda, which shows almost no signs of such a rivalry or even of a defined group of Asuras distinct from the Devas. Despite these R̥gvedic lacunae it was still tempting to see in this hymn a depiction of the overthrow of the Asuras by the Devas and a number of scholars have done so, although there are important counterindica-tions—not least the passage just cited where Agni asserts his identity as a god even as he is leaving his own kin-group, supposedly the Asuras.I will not pursue this particular question further, for want of space (and a disinclination to engage in a debate unlikely ever to be satisfactorily resolved). I will, however, point out a striking feature of the hymn that seems not to have been sufficiently noted. Whoever the two opposing parties in this revolution were, the power shift from one to the other was remarkably peaceful, especially for the R̥gveda, where most conflicts have violence as their defining characteristic. This peacefulness is emphasized throughout the hymn. Agni refers to the non-god he left as “being kindly disposed” (śivá), apologetically describing himself as “unkind” (áśiva) in leaving (vs. 2c). Varuṇa seems to counter this in verse 3c by proclaiming to Father Asura that Agni was indeed kind (śéva) (in my interpreta-tion: this pāda has been variously interpreted). In verse 7 Varuṇa is said to have released the waters “without an excess of power,” and the waters thus released “make peace with each other.” In verse 8 Indra “dwells peacefully” amid his sub-jects. The only violence in the hymn is prospective: the smashing of Vr̥tra fore-seen by Indra in verse 6, once Soma has allied himself with Indra. The hymn is all about negotiation and a sort of sacrificial horse-trading: see Indra’s offers of important roles to Agni (1c), Varuṇa (5d), and Soma (6d). Indra even begs Varuṇa to “love” him (5b). The principal figures “choose” their side and their ruler (Soma in 4b and even the female rivers in 8b) and make their own moves, as emphasized by the repeated verbs of motion (“come!” 1a; “going . . . I go, . . . I leave, . . . I go” 2; “I go” 3d; “I leave . . . they bestir themselves . . . (I) coming here” 4; “come!” 5d; “come forth!” 6c). The peaceful and voluntary nature of the change in alliances—the lack of retaliation by the deserted side, the lack of interest in pursuing their advantage and crushing their opponents by the winning side—distinguishes this episode not only from almost every other such situation in the R̥gveda but also from the perpetual conflict and reflexive hostility between Asuras and Devas in middle Vedic literature—an indication, perhaps, that that rivalry is not the con-text in which to interpret this hymn."},{"pageNumber":1616,"pageContent":"X.1241599Although, given the apparent failure of so many R̥gvedic interpreters to iden-tify the deserted party successfully, it is foolhardy to suggest my own candidate, I will make an unemphatic essay in that direction. Note first that the figure most clearly left behind by the deserting gods is a “father”—qualified once as Father Asura/lordly father (3c), once just as father (4b). Note also the first half of verse 6, where Indra points to the sun and its previous preeminence on the scale of value, but suggests that it is now eclipsed or rivaled by the light of the broad midspace. Let us also remember the heads of the pantheons in Greek and Roman mythology, Zeus Patēr and Iuppiter respectively, and the curious fact that the cognate figure in ancient India, formulaically transparent Dyaus Pitar “Father Sky/Heaven,” has no comparable prominence in Vedic mythology though he is reasonably well attested in the texts. On putting these clues together, it seems possible that the old sky-centered religion focused on the inherited paternal divinity Dyaus quietly gave way to one located in realms closer to men, where divinities concerned themselves with issues important to mankind, such as the release of the waters (vss. 7–8), and actively sought the praise and sacrificial offerings of men (vs. 9 and, by implication, throughout the hymn). Dyaus Pitar remained a revered figure but played little role in the sacrificial system. There was thus no violent rupture in the social or religious fabric, just a peaceful fad-ing into well-but-perfunctorily-honored irrelevance for Dyaus, displaced by ritual-centered gods like Agni and Soma and those deeply involved with men’s affairs, ethically (Varuṇa) or martially (Indra).JPBIn the introduction above, SWJ expresses well-considered doubt about the possibil-ity of ever resolving the interpretive difficulties of this hymn. In trying once again to understand the narrative and situation behind it, I know I risk adding yet another not quite convincing interpretation to an already large stack of not quite convinc-ing interpretations. But this hymn is difficult to avoid, because it is central to one of the more intriguing questions of Vedic religious history: When and how does the story of the conflict of Devas and Asuras develop? There is little possible evidence and still less likely evidence in the R̥gveda for this narrative staple of the later Vedic and classical traditions. We have pointed out several passages that might reflect it, but even these are not certain (see, for example, X.53.4 and 157.4). However, as my colleague pointed out above, a number of scholars have cited X.124 not only as evidence for the definition of the Asuras as a group of deities distinct from and in opposition to Devas but also as evidence—the only evidence—for an elaborate nar-rative in which former Asuras shift to the side of the Devas (see, for example, Brown 1919: 100, Kuiper 1975, Oberlies 1998: 391).In Brereton (forthcoming b), I have proposed a different approach to the hymn. I try to show that this hymn asserts a human claim of succession after the death of a previous ruler. The hymn is indeed a dialogue, but I identify the speakers differently"},{"pageNumber":1617,"pageContent":"X.1241600from their assignment below. Verse 1, I believe, is not in the voice of Indra, but in that of the sacrificer, in whose rite the hymn was recited. The first three pādas are a fairly standard invitation to Agni to come to the sacrifice. It is only in the last pāda that the verse takes an unexpected turn: “For a long time,” it states, Agni has “lain in long darkness.” That is to say, the ritual fire has been extinguished. The later Veda prescribes that the ritual fire be extinguished at the death of a sacrificer, and therefore at least one possibility is that this summons to Agni is a summons to return after such a death. Verse 2 is Agni’s response: he has departed from one who was a mortal, a “non-god,” but he now returns to his new life as the sacrificial fire of a living sacrificer. In verse 3 the new sacrificer welcomes Agni, who previously was the guest of the old sacrificer, to the “many domains of truth,” the places where the new sacrificer has now installed the sacrificial fires. The sacrificer then proclaims a kindness for his “lordly father,” the deceased sacrificer, thus identifying the old sacrificer as both his own father and a “lord,” a ruler. The kindness he offers is the continuation of his father’s ritual performance, which will guarantee his father’s life in the realm of the ancestors, and in this way he converts Agni’s “unkindness” in deserting his father to an act of kindness. In verse 4 Agni once again speaks. For many years he acted “within it”—if antár asmin refers to the sacrifice obliquely mentioned in verse 3—or “within him,” within the sphere or authority of the old sacrificer. But now Agni chooses “Indra.” As in IV.42, the coronation hymn of King Trasadasyu, “Indra” here is the new king. “The kingship has made a revolution,” Agni declares, for there is a new king, and Agni promises to do what he can to help in the institution of that king’s rule. To this the new sacrificer and king replies, now addressing Varuṇa, who has been made present by Agni. He says that rival lords lack the ability to rule, and therefore Varuṇa should come and govern with him and in support of him.In my view the dialogue ends with verse 5. In verse 6 the sacrificer and new king makes a final declaration, in which he explicitly identifies himself with Indra, here by assuming Indra’s most characteristic deed, the destruction of Vr̥tra. The final three verses are in the voice of the priestly narrator. In verse 7 he identifies the new king with Varuṇa by attributing to him the deeds of Varuṇa, and in verse 8 the new king once again becomes Indra. Finally in verse 9 the sage poets “discern” Indra. And where do they discern him? In the king, who acts in accordance with the praise that follows him!Thus, the hymn parallels IV.42, in which Trasadasyu acts as both Varuṇa and Indra in peace and in war. Unlike Trasadasyu, however, the claimant here seems to have had opposition, which would have made the ritual affirmation of his rule all the more essential. In this interpretation, ásura “lord” or “lordly” dissolves as a designa-tion for a group of gods. In its two occurrences, in the singular in verse 3 and in the plural in verse 5, ásura refers to human lords, not to gods or antigods or old gods. And not only does it refer to humans, but also to quite different humans: in verse 3 to the predecessor of the sacrificer and in verse 5 to the sacrificer’s enemies or rivals.1.

The 1st-person speaker uses the word “I” (ahám) fifteen times (not counting other cases"},{"pageNumber":1619,"pageContent":"X.1251602of this pronoun), along with numerous 1st-person present-tense verbs. With the fame of the hymn comes a certain carelessness on the part of its many transla-tors, who have tended to smooth out the rough and puzzling places. See, for example, verse 3d, where a more fluent and expected expression might be “I have many stations and enter many things” (compare Doniger O’Flaherty’s “I dwell in many places and enter into many forms” and Maurer’s “with many a place and entering upon many a form”), but the undoubted causative verb form in the second phrase makes that easy rendering impossible. The praises that Speech heaps upon herself are not necessarily for the things that we expect her to boast about, and as translators and interpreters we must follow the lead of her own grammatical choices.She begins by asserting her companionship with, indeed her support for, the primary gods and groups thereof (vss. 1–2), as well as for the mortal sacrificer. In verse 3 she sounds the common theme of the divisions of speech, though not in the usual way; in the phrase noted above (3d), she asserts that not only is she found in many places—that is, she has been much subdivided—but that many things enter her—that is, she also encompasses the many entities that make up the world. These contrastive, mirrored images are part of her totalizing project.Verse 4 and 5 are the center of the hymn and its crux, defined as an ompha-los by the framing forms of ā́-√viś “enter” in 3d and 6d and by the repeated vadāmi “I speak / tell” of 4d and 5a. In the first three pādas of verse 4 she depicts speech as that on which the other operations of life depend, but in a curiously oblique way—not through speech directly but through eating. She identifies eat-ing as the central operation and herself as the instrument and facilitator of eat-ing (“through me he eats food”), with the other senses (“who sees, who breathes, who hears . . . ”) dependent on the eating. (Other translators tend to elide the distinction between the main clause “he eats food” and the subordinate clauses “who sees,” etc., but the contrast is too marked to ignore.) What can she mean by this odd statement? If we are right, (at least) two different things. On the one hand, she is laying claim to the mouth, the organ that engages in both eating and speaking. The other sense organs—eyes (sight), nose (breathing), ears (hear-ing)—are not involved with either operation. Eating is essential to life: one can’t see, breathe, or hear without being alive, which requires food, and so, by their joint location in the mouth, Speech can assert her primary role in eating and thus in staying alive. By this argument, all other sense activities depend on Speech. But we think there is also another, more pointed message here, about the poet, whom she is about to address. The poet makes his livelihood (“eats his food”) by producing poetic speech from the inspiration of the goddess Speech, and his sense activity, including the ways in which he receives inspiration, by seeing and hearing especially, as well as his life depends on her.In the final pāda of verse 4 she addresses the poet directly, with a tour de force of phonological play, much remarked upon in scholarly literature: śrudhí śruta śraddhiváṃ te vadāmi “Listen, o you who are listened to: it’s a trustworthy thing"},{"pageNumber":1620,"pageContent":"X.1251603I tell you.” The poet is the one who is “listened to” in the world: his verbal products have a privileged status, and she makes him a conduit of her own message. In the following verse (5) she explains how she chooses and anoints her choice as poet and what qualities she invests him with.After the omphalos verses she returns (vss. 6–8) to a more general and wider focus, asserting her pervasion of Heaven and Earth, indeed of all the worlds, both horizontally and vertically, and even beyond them. Quite striking, and also super-ficially unclear, is her statement in verse 7a, literally “I give birth to the/a father on his head” (aháṃ suve pitáram asya mūrdhán). In contrast to most interpretations of this statement, we interpret it in light of a common use of the phrase “the head of heaven” in the R̥gveda as an epithet for Agni (e.g., III.2.14 agním mūrdhā́naṃ diva﻿́ḥ). The father is “Father Heaven” (Dyaus Pitar), but “his head” is then actually a reference to fire, most particularly the ritual fire in its deified form Agni. If we are correct, Vāc is returning to the notion of sacrificial speech found earlier in the hymn, implying that speech produced on the ritual ground beside the sacrificial fire in a sense creates and sustains the cosmos. From this restricted space, namely the locus of the sacrifice, speech spreads across all realms and up to heaven. (Under this interpretation, the womb in the waters of 7b could refer to the waters of the soma sacrifice, though this is not necessary.)In sum, our version of a beloved hymn to a beloved goddess is stranger and perhaps less lovable than its usual interpretations, but also reflects the crafty indi-rection of the goddess herself.1.

The first seven verses are in upariṣṭādbr̥hatī, technically 8 8 8 12. But the last four syllables of the final pāda are a refrain, “beyond hatreds” (áti dvíṣaḥ), giving the impression of an anuṣṭubh verse (8 8 8 8) with a decorative flourish at the end. The principal dedi-cands of the hymn are the Ādityas, or rather the trio Varuṇa, Mitra, and Aryaman. These appear in scrambled order in verse 1cd, but for the rest of the upariṣṭādbr̥hatī verses (2–7) occupy the entire second pāda in fixed order. This punctuation of each verse with two fixed phrases, each at the end of its hemistich, subordinates the mes-sage of each verse to its structure. Fortunately the message is elementary: the gods in question should lead us out of difficulties and to shelter and safety.A few other gods appear in the hymn: Rudra with the Maruts, and Indra and Agni in verse 5, and Agni in the appended and metrically distinct final verse (8), but their presence barely registers in the very Ādityan atmosphere.1.

The night described here is not that of the frightening and formless darkness so often mentioned in the text, but rather starry night, who has beauties of her own. In fact, she is described in places (see vss. 2 and 3c especially) with phraseology more appropriate to Dawn, whose own advent is anticipated in verse 7.1. Goddess Night, while coming hither, has looked about in many places with her eyes.She has laid on herself all beauties.2. The immortal goddess has filled the broad (midspace), its depths and heights;with light she repels the darkness.3.

The first two verses situate the performance of the hymn “at the competing invocation(s)” (vihavá, a derivative of which provides the poet’s name, Vihavya, in the Anukramaṇī)—a moment when sacrificers all over the Ārya lands are inviting the same gods to their own separate sacrifices. The poet urges his own case with a series of emphatic fronted 1st-person singular pronominal forms (“mine,” “to me,” etc.) in the first four verses. The potential competing sacrificers in these early verses are transformed into even more threatening figures as the hymn progress—haters (vs. 5), violent challengers in battle (vs. 6), rivals (vs. 9). The poet then asks for the aid of the gods in repulsing them and in protecting him.The grammar and diction of the hymn are straightforward and spring no surprises.1. Mine be the luster at the competing invocations, o Agni. Might we thrive in our body as we kindle you in your body.To me let the four quarters bow. With you as our overseer might we win battles.2.

Because it is elusive and suggestive rather than directly narrative, it has given rise to a wide variety of interpretations. The interpre-tation we offer here follows the more extensive discussion in Brereton (1999), which also refers to earlier literature and alternate interpretations.If this is a cosmogonic hymn, it is certainly a strange one, because the last verse does not come to a conclusion but ends with a question. This incompleteness is formally marked by both metrical and syntactic irregularities. The meter of verse 7b is two syllables short, leaving the its hearers to anticipate two beats that are not there, and the syntax of 7d is incomplete since the poem ends with a relative clause without a main clause. A close look at the rest of the hymn explains the reason for these poetic strategies.In verse 1 there is a progression from negations—what existed was neither exist-ing nor nonexisting and neither space nor heaven existed—to questions (1c) to possibilities (1d). Verse 2 also begins with negation, here the negation of death, deathlessness, and the signs of night and day. The only narrative progress is the greater specificity in verse 2 about what is negated: there are no mortals or immor-tals, there is no moon or sun. But whereas 1cd continued with questions and pos-sibilities, 2cd provides an answer to the question of what existed: there existed “that One,” which “breathed without wind.” In 1c the poet asked what “stirred,” or more literally what “moved back and forth,” and in 2c the implicit answer is that the “breathing” of the One moves back and forth. If 2c answers the question of 1c and indeed if verse 2 defines what verse 1 suggests, then “that One” in verse 2 is the pre-viously undefined thing that was neither existent nor nonexistent in verse 1.Verse 3 sharpens the sense that nothing is happening, nothing material at least. It apparently starts over once again: 3a ends “in the beginning” (a﻿́gre) just as 1a ends"},{"pageNumber":1625,"pageContent":"X.1291608“at that time” (tadā́nīm) and 2a “then” (ta﻿́rhi). But where verses 1 and 2 asked ques-tions or only hinted at answers, 3a asserts that there was something, namely “dark-ness” covered by darkness, and 3c describes a “thing coming into being” (ābhú) covered by “emptiness.” In verse 3, therefore, “that One” still does not have sub-stance, but it is beginning to have shape, since there is something that is “covered” by something. As Thieme (1964: 66–67) has observed, that shape is the shape of an egg, and it is this egg-like shape that in 3d “was born” or hatched through heat.Thus far there has been little development of substance, although there has been an evolution of concept. An unidentified subject that neither exists nor does not exist is introduced in verse 1. It has taken conceptual form as the “One” in verse 2, and finally assumed an egg-like shape in verse 3. In verse 4 there is a shift that apparently breaks the continuity of the hymn. According to 4ab, thought gives rise to desire, which is concretized as the “primal semen,” the origin of beings. However, there is one thing that connects verses 3 and 4 and maintains the hymn’s continu-ity: “desire” in 4a corresponds to “heat” in 3d. If so, then “thought” in 4b should correspond to the “One” in 3d. And so it does, for “thought” is the hidden metaphor in verses 1–3. In verse 1 it is thought that neither exists nor does not exist, because thought is something real but at the same time something not real, since it is not externally perceptible. Or, to put it another way, thought has shape but no sub-stance, as verse 3 says. This hymn, therefore, shows an omphalos structure, in which the middle verse, in this case verse 4, contains the key to the hymn. Here that key is the revelation that thought is the One, which is the ultimate source of creation. It is not surprising, therefore, that the “connection” (ba﻿́ndhu) between “existing” and “not-existing,” the connection that is thought, was discovered by poets “though inspired thinking” (manīṣā́, 4d). In verse 5 this “connection” also becomes a divid-ing “cord” (raśmí) and through it there emerges the distinction between males (the placers of semen and the offering) and females (“greatnesses,” i.e., pregnancies, and independent will).But even if thought is the ultimate and primal creative act, the origin of the world is still unknown, even by the gods (vs. 6c). If there is an overseer of the world, he might know, or he might not (vs. 7cd). The lack of an answer means that “think-ing” will not come to an end. The poem ends with metrical and syntactic irresolu-tion and with a question in order that its hearers are left thinking and in that way left repeating the fundamental act of creation, the act of thinking.1. The nonexistent did not exist, nor did the existent exist at that time. There existed neither the airy space nor heaven beyond.What moved back and forth? From where and in whose protection? Did water exist, a deep depth?2. Death did not exist nor deathlessness then. There existed no sign of night nor of day.That One breathed without wind by its independent will.

Their cord was stretched across: Did something exist below it? Did something exist above?There existed placers of semen and there existed greatnesses. There was independent will below, offering above.6. Who really knows? Who shall here proclaim it?—from where was it born, from where this creation?The gods are on this side of the creation of this (world). So then who does know from where it came to be?7. This creation—from where it came to be, if it was produced or if not—he who is the overseer of this (world) in the furthest heaven, he surely knows. Or if he does not know . . . ?X.130 (956) Creation of the SacrificeYajña Prājāpatya7 verses: triṣṭubh, except jagatī 1In its first three verses the hymn depicts the creation of the acts of the sacrifice through the image of weaving. The form of the sacrifice was instituted by the gods (vss. 1, 3) and first carried out by the “fathers,” the ancient seers who were the ancestors of the current priests (vs. 6). Indeed, these fathers are at the present rite as well (1cd). In verse 2 it becomes complicated because it is difficult to know who the actors are. In 2ab the subject may not be “a man,” but “the Man,” a figure similar to the Puruṣa of X.90. That is how Sāyaṇa and others have understood it. But it might also refer simply to “a man” in the sense of “a human” and imply that humans have taken up the weaving of the gods and ancestors, and in doing so their activity reaches to heaven. Again in 2cd it is not clear who “they” are who have sat down to weave the sacrifice. They might be the fathers after 1cd, the human priests in continuation of 2ab, or the gods in anticipation of verse 3. Since any of these could have been so described, the ambiguity may be intentional.Verse 3ab completes the weaving image, although the terminology reflects the ritual as much as it does weaving. The “model” and “image” could be for a woven cloth or a ritual performance. The nidā́na, a “connection” or a “rope,” might fit weaving but does not fit the ritual very well. Since according to X.114.2 poets are"},{"pageNumber":1627,"pageContent":"X.1301610able to see the hidden “connection,” in a ritual context it may describe knowledge that a priest has. On the other hand “melted butter” and a “frame” could find a place in either weaving or ritual. In 3cd the imagery is all from the sacrifice. In 3c the poet mentions the Praügaśastra, which is the second recitation of the Morning Pressing in the classical Agniṣṭoma. The recitation comprises I.2–3, which names the deities who receive soma in the three pressings in an Agniṣṭoma, and may have been singled out because of that. The last line could also be translated “when all the gods sacrificed to the god,” but we have understood it as an echo of 6d and X.90.16a (=I.164.50a) yajñe﻿́na yajña﻿́m ayajanta devā́ḥ “with the sacrifice the gods offered the sacrifice.”The ritual frame described in verses 1–3 is then filled with gods in verses 4–5, verses that link the various meters of Vedic poetry with the major gods of the sacri-ficial day. There are various associations between a particular meter and a particu-lar god: The sacrificial fire, Agni, begins the sacrificial day, and the gāyatrī meter is associated with the morning soma-pressing. The name of the br̥hatī-meter is similar to the name of Br̥haspati, and Indra hymns are characteristically composed in the triṣṭubh meter. And, balancing Agni and the gāyatrī, the All Gods and the jagatī meter are associated with the evening soma-pressing.The last two verses recall the ancient sages who ordered the sacrifice and affirm that the priests today follow the path that has been set for them. As Geldner notes, the “courses (of the ritual)” refer to the actions of the ritual to which the recitations are attached.1. The sacrifice, which is extended in every direction by its warp threads and stretched out by a hundred and one acts of the gods—these fathers who have traveled here weave that. They sit at the warp, saying, “Weave forth, weave back.”2. A man extends it [=the warp] and pulls it up (with the heddles); a man has extended it out upon the vault of heaven here.Here are their pegs; they [=the gods?] sat down upon their seat and made the sāman-chants the shuttles for weaving.3. What was its model, its image? What its connection? What was its melted butter? What was its frame?What was the meter? What was the Praüga-recitation, what the hymn?—when all the gods offered the god [=the Sacrifice].4. The gāyatrī meter became the yokemate of Agni. Savitar has united with the uṣṇihā meterand Soma with the anuṣṭubh meter, gaining greatness through the hymns. The br̥hatī meter helped the speech of Br̥haspati.5. The virāj meter is the full glory of Mitra and Varuṇa, and the triṣṭubh meter is here Indra’s portion of the (sacrificial) day.The jagatī meter entered the All Gods. According to this did the seers, the sons of Manu, arrange (the ritual)."},{"pageNumber":1628,"pageContent":"X.13116116.

Moreover, almost half of Kakṣīvant’s output consists of Aśvin hymns (I.116–120), indeed, more than half by verse count, and verses 4–5 of our hymn allude to a myth not otherwise found in the R̥gveda but prevalent in later Vedic, in which the Aśvins figure prominently.Verses 2 and 3 have a slightly folksy air, using homely images to provide a model for Indra’s behavior toward us. In verse 2 the model is the harvesting and threshing of grain; if our interpretation is correct, the poet compares the threshing of the grain, which gets rid of the chaff and keeps only the wholesome grain, to deci-sions Indra should make about how to distribute goods he has acquired. The goods should come only to us [=the good grain], not to those [=the chaff] who neglect their sacrificial tasks. This image has the type of twist that Kakṣīvant enjoys: the audience thinks at first that the grain is being compared to the “goodies” to be distributed, and when that interpretation doesn’t work, they must dig deeper to redistribute the metaphorical roles.Verse 3 is not as conceptually complex, but it displays a virtuosic density. The first pāda contains the entire metaphorical model: a one-horse vehicle won’t suc-ceed, or in an expanded and more literal paraphrase, “there is nothing that, when drawn by a single animal, has traveled in the right way.” The implications are then worked out: pāda b suggests that relying on oneself alone will not bring fame; the last half of the verse provides the solution: seek Indra as helper and yokemate.This message, that everyone needs a helper, is then projected onto the mythologi-cal plane, indeed onto the greatest hero—often presented as acting triumphantly alone—Indra. The little snatch of the Aśvin story found in verses 4–5 emphasizes how they and Sarasvatī “helped” Indra in his need. This myth has been much"},{"pageNumber":1629,"pageContent":"X.1311612discussed in the literature (see especially Bloomfield [1893] and Oldenberg [1893], as well as Jamison [1991: 98–103]), especially in its relationship to the later Sautrāmaṇī ritual, which in fact utilizes some of the verses in this hymn and which owes its name to the epithet of Indra found in verses 6–7, sutrā́man “of good protection.” We will not pursue the issue in detail here. In brief summary, Indra became sick after drinking an excess of soma, and in order to heal him the Aśvins and Sarasvatī had him drink the usually forbidden alcohol surā, which they obtained in one way or another (the methods are different at different periods in Vedic) from the asuric Namuci. The surā was not pure but mixed, and both the Aśvins and Indra are here depicted as performing the singular feat of separating the two mixed liquids in the course of drinking them.If even Indra occasionally needs helpers, we need feel no shame in seeking one ourselves, and in the last two verses (6–7) we express the hope that Indra will fill this role for us.1. O overpowering Indra, thrust away all the eastern foes, away the western ones,away the northern ones, o champion, and away the southern ones, so that we might rejoice in your broad shelter.2. Surely it is like barley-growers and their barley—how they cut it, threshing it according to the old ways—(so), here, just here (with us [=grain]) put the goodies of those [=chaff] who have not come for the reverent twisting of the sacred grass.3. Because a “one-horse” carriage doesn’t drive well, so fame has never been acquired (thus) at the encounters.Inspired ones, seeking cows, seeking horses, seeking prizes, (seek) the bull Indra for partnership.4. O Aśvins, having separated the surā-soma by drinking it in company with the asuric Namuci,you helped Indra in his deeds, o lords of beauty.5. Like parents their son, both the Aśvins helped (you), Indra, through their wondrous skills and sage words.When with your powers you separated the surā-soma by drinking it, Sarasvatī healed you, bounteous one.6. Let Indra be of good protection, of good help with his help, very gracious, affording all possessions.Let him thrust away hatred; let him create fearlessness.

Given the serious disturbances in the meter, it is quite possible that many of the problems in the hymn result from faulty transmission, but we must translate what we have, not what we wish we had. At this point it is impossible to produce a satisfy-ing account of the purport of the whole hymn and of its many puzzles of detail, but it is also not possible to supply even a tentative translation without having a prior hypothesis about the underlying aim of the composition. Geldner suggests that a specific political story lies behind it, full of sin, murder, and regal intrigue, but his sketch of this scenario is not convincing.Our own hypothesis is less dramatic, though perhaps equally unconvincing. We believe that it reflects the ritual innovation happening during this late R̥gvedic period that split the earlier role(s) of sacrificing priest-poet into what in classical śrauta ritual are the “Sacrificer” (Yajamāna, lit. “the one sacrificing for himself ”), who actually has little active participation in the sacrifice but provides the mate-rial support for it, and the working priests who are the actual physical and ver-bal performers of sacrifice. The new “Sacrificer” in part takes over the old role of “patron” (sūrí), but maintains a more organic connection to the sacrifice. In this hymn this new type of Sacrificer is celebrated, as is his largesse to us, the working priests. Divine models for this split role with complementary duties are provided in the hymn—primarily by Mitra and Varuṇa, the ostensible dedicands, but also by Heaven and Earth (vss. 1 and 6, with Heaven also paired with Varuṇa in vs. 4) and the Aśvins (vs. 1).Perhaps the best support for our views is the first verse, which contains three fronted repetitions of the perfect middle participle ījāna﻿́ “having performed sacrifice for himself,” the perfect-stem equivalent of the present middle participle ya﻿́jamāna “sacrificing for himself ” that is substantivized to become the title Sacrificer. This figure is the object of the ministrations of both Heaven and Earth (ab) and the Aśvins (cd). The first half of verse 2 contrastively introduces “us,” the priests who are sacrificing (in the active voice, yajāmasi) at the prompting, presumably, of the Sacrificer, who appears in the second half of the verse, in the guise of another mid-dle participle, krāṇá “performing (ritual) for himself.” Mitra and Varuṇa bestow their favors on both parties and assure their joint victory over demonic forces.Verse 3 is particularly challenging and has received numerous clashing interpre-tations, but we believe that it continues the theme of complementary roles and in fact introduces the motif of the Sacrificer’s gifts to the priests. In our view “we,” in our priestly role, are seeking to attract Mitra and Varuṇa to the sacrifice (pāda a), while the Sacrificer is represented as the giver in pāda c, with pāda d express-ing the hope or expectation that no one can disrupt his gifts to us. Complicating"},{"pageNumber":1631,"pageContent":"X.1321614the interpretation is the rare and rather charged word re﻿́knas “legacy.” However, re﻿́knas is several times used of what we gain from the gods at the sacrifice (e.g., I.31.5, 121.5, VI.20.7); in keeping with its etymology (from the root ric “leave”), it can be viewed as what was “left behind” by the gods at the sacrifice, and both the priests and the Sacrificer should receive it, as they both seem to in pādas b and c respectively.Serious impediments to our (or anyone else’s) interpretation arise in the follow-ing verses, especially the second half of verse 4 through the first half of verse 5. The first half of verse 5, in a twist on the classic “the one . . . the other” (anya﻿́ . . . anya﻿́) construction typically used to depict the complementary functions of two indi-viduals, posits the shared or successive kingship of Heaven and Varuṇa. In pāda 4c Varuṇa, addressed in the 2nd person, or Varuṇa or someone else, presented in the 3rd person (the verb is ambiguous), “takes pleasure in the chariot.” The chariot could be the chariot of the sacrifice, found also in verse 7b, or the war chariot. The latter seems more likely in the context of the next pāda and the first hemistich of verse 5 and gains resonance from other features of the god Varuṇa. Pāda 5d states that “It is not by such a transgression that (a man) is (called) ‘oath-breaker’ ” (following the reading āntakadhrúk of Eichner-Kühn [1982], who connected it to the seṭ root am “pledge, swear,” rather than the previously standard interpre-tation antaka). What transgression? If it is what is found in the previous pāda, taking pleasure in the chariot, it might be a very oblique reference to Varuṇa ’s standard functions. It is well known that Varuṇa and Indra often share kingship (see the famous dialogue hymn IV.42), with Indra functioning as king in times of war, Varuṇa in times of peace. If Varuṇa is taking pleasure in the war chariot, his behavior is uncharacteristic and could indeed be considered transgressive, but, the poet tells us, it would not be sufficiently serious to constitute a breach of his nor-mal duties, would not be an oath-breaking infraction. His unaccustomed behavior points to the theme of the hymn, by implication: each member of a pair has his own sphere and venturing out of that sphere may invite suspicion or even blame. (Alternatively, if the subject of pāda c is an unidentified third person, the pleasure that person/god takes in the war-chariot would not brand him as one who has violated his oath to Varuṇa.)What would be a sufficient transgression is laid out in 5ab and attributed to an individual derogatorily named “Shit-purified” (Śakapūta)—namely, treacherously continuing to attack fallen warriors after a peace-treaty has been concluded. Even if our speculations about the meaning of 4cd–5ab are correct (and there are alterna-tive interpretations; for example that 4ab refers to the passing of power from Father Sky [Dyaus Pitar] to gods such as Varuṇa and Indra possibly depicted in X.124), it is difficult to understand why this bitter little anecdote was inserted into the hymn at this point and just as quickly dropped. Note, by the way, that the Anukramaṇī attributes this hymn to Śakapūta, but it is almost certainly the case that this name was simply plucked from the hymn itself. The Anukramaṇī’s patronymic Nārmedha has a better chance of conforming to fact, as the name Nr̥medha is found in the"},{"pageNumber":1632,"pageContent":"X.1321615final verse, where poets typically name themselves, and a Nr̥medha Āngirasa is the supposed poet of several other hymns (VIII.89–90, 98–99; IX.27, 29; VIII.90 shows some parallels to our hymn).The rest of verse 5 and all of verse 6 appear to concern the present sacrifice, where the pair Mitra and Varuṇa are to be found, as well as Heaven and Earth (in a simile)—in addition to Agni and Aditi, for good measure. Again, there are a number of difficulties in the details. The first half of the final verse (7) also takes place at the sacrifice, and it seems to reaffirm the split roles of Sacrificer and priest that we claim provide the subject for the hymn. The “two ruling over property” in pāda a are, of course, Mitra and Varuṇa, but they also represent the Sacrificer-patron figure, while the unnamed subject of pāda b is the actual priestly officiant who will direct the chariot of the sacrifice.We would be perfectly happy if the hymn had ended with 7b, for the last hemis-tich presents yet another unsolvable challenge. As noted above, the poet (if that’s who it is) Nr̥medha names himself in this half-verse, also under the punning desig-nation Sumedha. But the nature of the exploit he boasts of—the rescue of a certain set of females (or feminine-gender items)—must remain opaque, because the word characterizing the rescued is an impossible hapax, a plural present participle to an apparent denominative verb meaning “seek/behave as/perform kaṇūka,” a word with no etymology or apparent relatives. Following Sāyaṇa, most modern transla-tors render it as “lamenting,” but this was clearly a desperate, though contextually plausible, guess on the part of Sāyaṇa, and it seems better to leave the poet’s pun-ning wordplay or contemporary reference untranslated.1.

Our hymn is attributed to Sudās Paijavana; Sudās is the name of the leading king in the Battle of the Ten Kings, on whose side Indra fought, and it is perhaps not an accident that the first three verses in this hymn are in a form of śakvarī meter (here seven pādas of eight syllables). In VII.33.4 “a lofty cry in śakvarī” is what attracted Indra to fight on the side of Sudās in this battle. It is meter that also provides the possible connection with the Nābhāka Kā ṇva hymns just mentioned: the rare śakvarī meter is also found in VIII.40.2, and the likewise rather rare mahāpaṅkti meter (six pādas of eight syllables) of the second three verses of our hymn (4–6) is also the meter of the Nābhāka hymns VIII.39, VIII.40 (save for vss. 2 and 12), and VIII.41.The hymn celebrates the martial deeds and powers of Indra and urges the god to use his powers against our enemies, both within and without.1.

The latter hymn shares its meter, mahāpaṅkti, with the second triplet (vss. 4–6) of X.133; both hymns are dedicated to Indra and share phraseol-ogy (e.g., 133.4bc and 134.2cd); and 134 also has a refrain in its first six verses, though one without the slangy sassiness of 133.1–6.Like the last hymn, this one asks Indra for help against our enemies and also for bounties. These are of course standard requests, but the imagery toward the end of the hymn (vss. 5–6) is both precise and quirky, particularly the picture of Indra using his ability like a long crook to pull down a high branch and shake down its fruit, an image in turn compared to a goat doing the same with his forefoot. (Anyone familiar with goat behavior will recognize this picture instantly.)1.

Without discussing previous interpretations in detail, we will add our own, with no expectation that it will meet with any more acceptance than those that preceded it.It is generally (but not universally) agreed that it concerns a death, either that of a boy or that of his father, and the journey to (or from) the realm of Yama, the ruler of the dead (see, e.g., X.14). Both a boy (kumārá, vss. 3–5) and a father (vs. 1) are explicitly mentioned in the hymn, and we follow those who consider the dead man to be the father. The pleasant place over which Yama has domain is described in the first and last (7) verses; in the first verse the dead person is traveling there, while in the last he seems to have reached it successfully.The first two verses appear to be spoken by the boy whose father has just died. He imagines his father’s journey to Yama (vs. 1), and in verse 2 he displays a psy-chologically plausible ambivalence: he longs to see his father again, but recoils from even the thought of following him on his road to the realm of the dead. The solu-tion to his psychological dilemma seems to be given in verses 3–4: the boy creates"},{"pageNumber":1636,"pageContent":"X.1351619a mental chariot without wheels that he mounts without seeing it, and presum-ably this vehicle carries him to his father without the rigors of the journey. To us this mental conveyance suggests a dream, and many of us have experienced such reunions with the beloved dead in dreams. But the chariot can also be (and in vs. 4 more likely is) the ritual, quite possibly the correctly performed funeral service for his father.The real problems in this hymn are found in verses 5–6 and in particular the word anudéyī, found in both verses (5d, 6a) in identical phrases. Although the word is a transparent gerundive, in the feminine, formed to the lexeme ánu-√dā “hand over, concede” and should therefore mean “to be handed over, conceded,” its exact usage is completely unclear. Its only other occurrence is in the wedding hymn (X.85.6), where it appears to refer to a bridesmaid or female servant of the bride, who is to accompany her to her new home. Interpretations of the word in this hymn vary wildly, an indication of the problems it poses: Grassmann “Braut” (bride); Geldner “Amme” (nurse); Renou “viatique” (provisions for a journey; EVP), but “chargement” (cargo; Hymnes spéculatives [1956]); Oldenberg (following Caland) “Anustaraṇīkuh” (cow to be killed at the funeral rite); Griffith “funeral gift”; Macdonell “equipment”; Doniger O’Flaherty “gift for the journey.” Our own interpretation is informed by the use of the lexeme ánu-√dā in an Atharvaveda pas-sage (AVŚ VI.118.1–2), a passage found in various versions also in the Paippalāda recension of the Atharvaveda, in the Maitrāyaṇa Saṃhitā, and in the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka. In this passage the speaker asks for his offenses, his debts (r̥ṇá), to be forgiven, using the verb ánu-dā (vs. 1: “let the two Apsarases forgive this r̥ṇá of ours today”), and he seeks for this to happen before he enters “Yama’s world.” The part of the passage concerning Yama’s world is read variously in the various texts and has clearly been subject to corruption, but in most readings the person in ques-tion fears entering Yama’s world “with a rope on” (ádhirajju), a rope presumably imposed by his debts.Reading our passage with these passages in mind, we may speculate that verses 5 and 6 find the father arriving at Yama’s world with the same anxiety apparent in the passages just referred to: that he will be called to account for the debts he owes and must prove that they have been repaid or forgiven (ánu-√dā) before he enters that realm. The Taittirīya Saṃhitā (VI.3.10.5) already knows the three debts (also r̥ṇá) with which a brahmin is born: studentship to the r̥ṣis, sacrifice to the gods, and sons for his ancestors. Although we see no trace of studentship in this hymn, the two questions in the first half of verse 5 provide implicit answers about the other two debts: the dead man begat a son, and he (and/or the son) also sent forth the chariot of sacrifice. Satisfactory answers about these debts clear the way for the father to enter Yama’s realm in verse 6, and it may in fact be Yama who is asking the questions.Several questions remain, however. Since r̥ṇá “debt” is a neuter noun, why is ánudeyī feminine in gender? There are no obvious feminine referents in this hymn that could underlie this adjective. For this problem the Atharvaveda passage"},{"pageNumber":1637,"pageContent":"X.1351620provides a clue. As was noted above, the protagonist in that passage fears entering Yama’s world “with a rope on,” with the rope representing his unpaid debts. The word rájju “rope” is feminine, and we suggest that this symbolic representation is the referent of ánudeyī. A more literal rendering than that given in the translation below would be “(the rope/fetter of debt) to be forgiven.”Even in this interpretation verse 6 remains somewhat puzzling, though the over-all impression made by the last three pādas is that of the enlargement of space. Here the clue is found in the final pāda, in the word niráyaṇam “coming forth.” The lexeme nír-√i (and closely related nír-ā́-√i) is almost entirely confined in the R̥gveda to birth contexts, to “coming forth” from the womb or a womblike container. In X.60.7 it is used not of an original birth, but of a symbolic rebirth, recalling a sick man to life. We suggest that here, too, a rebirth is at issue, but this time it is the rebirth into a happy life in Yama’s world, where the dead man will be reunited with his body and partake of the pleasures hinted at in verses 1 and 7, as well as in, for example, X.14 (esp. vss. 7–9). The reuniting with the body after death in a distant realm is treated at length in X.56, where it is also likened to birth (X.56.1). The rebirth in our verse is somewhat graphically depicted, with the top (the head of the infant) coming out first, then the rest of his body, until the coming forth is completed. (Or, alternatively, the nirayaṇam may actually refer to the afterbirth.)The last verse announces the dead and now reborn man’s arrival at Yama’s delightful seat, with the emphatic annunciatory pronouns idám (7a), iyám (7c), ayám (7d), all meaning “here is, this one right here.” The promise of verse 1 has finally been fulfilled.For a detailed presentation of this interpretation of X.135, see Jamison (forthcoming d).1.

From the R̥gvedic point of view its closest analogue is the Labasūkta (X.119), describing the sensations of a soma-drinker, with its refrain “Have I drunk of the soma? Yes!” Both hymns depict the experience as flight, especially flight sped by the wind (here see vss. 2–6) and affording a bird’s eye view of the earth and its inhabit-ants (here vs. 4–5), and also emphasize the subject’s sense of power over cosmic entities (here esp. vss. 1, 5).The difference seems to be the identity of the drink that produces these sensa-tions: soma in I.119, “poison” (viṣá) in this hymn. The mention of the latter sub-stance begins and ends this hymn (vss. 1a, 7c) in ring composition. It is unclear what the liquid in question is. However, it should be noted that the drinker himself/itself is provided with characteristic somian vocabulary (“sweet, most exhilarating”) in the last pāda (6d) before the final verse depicting the preparation and drinking of the poison, and furthermore that the preparation of this poison by churning/stir-ring (√manth) and crushing (√piṣ) seems to mimic the preparation of soma: “crush” is semantically close to “press” (√su), and a certain type of soma, mixed with meal, is technically called manthín. The prominence of the wind-god Vāyu (vss. 5, 7) is also reminiscent of the soma sacrifice, for Vāyu, along with Indra, is the first recipi-ent of the soma drink. Thus, the cultic practice here is either being presented as a mirror-image analogue of the orthodox soma sacrifice, or in fact is the soma sacri-fice, but in esoteric guise.1.

Six of the seven verses (all but vs. 6) are found together in single hymns in both the Śaunaka and the Paippalāda recensions of the Atharvaveda (IV.13 and V.18 respectively), and the contents form a unity. Not surprisingly, given its Atharvaveda parallels, it is a simple Atharvan healing spell, calling on the gods, the wind, and the waters to bring a remedy for the disease afflicting the object of the spell. The poet-officiant is the actual effector of the healing, however, and in the last verse of the hymn (7; see also vs. 4) he deploys both his hands and his voice to bring about the cure—the usual pairing of action and speech characteristic of Atharvan practice.1. O gods, the one who has been put down, o gods, you lead him up again.and, o gods, the one who has committed an offense, o gods, you make him live again.2.

It begins without much difficulty, with two verses devoted to the opening of the Vala cave, though even here there are some puzzles. The second verse ends with the triumphant appearance of the sun after the cave is opened.This appearance seems to set the theme for the remaining verses of the hymn: though these four verses treat several different deeds of Indra (the destruc-tion of Pipru’s fortresses in vss. 3–4, the Vr̥tra smashing in at least part of vs. 5), they share a preoccupation with what we might call the deregulation of cosmic time and Indra’s participation in and repair of these problems. In 3a the Sun “unhitched his chariot in the middle of heaven,” an image that seems to suggest that the normal daily progress of the sun through the sky stopped abruptly and time stood still. This may, or may not, be a version of Indra’s stealing the wheel of the Sun (see, e.g., V.29, 31; IV.30.4–5). Two factors favor the identification of the two mythic allusions. On the one hand, Kutsa generally appears associated with Indra’s theft of the Sun’s wheel, and he appears in our verse 1. On the other, the final pāda of our hymn (6c) may refer, very indirectly, to the restoration of the Sun’s wheel in heaven (see below).Similar to the stopping of the Sun’s chariot in 3a is the striking incident in 5cd, also referred to elsewhere (though rarely; see esp. II.15.6, IV.30.8–11), in which Indra smashes the cart of the goddess Dawn, and she runs away in fear. Again, this seems to involve a perturbation of the ordinary progress of time. In between, 4c presents the sun and the moon in some relationship, which is entirely unclear but which does not seem entirely positive.The second half of the final verse (6) seems to show Indra remedying the situa-tion, perhaps restoring both nightly and daily cosmic time. In 6c he places in heaven"},{"pageNumber":1641,"pageContent":"X.1391624“the apportioner of the months,” presumably the moon, while in 6d “the father” (pitā́, the final word of the hymn), presumably Father Heaven, “bears the circlet split apart by you [=Indra].” If we are correct that the stopping of the Sun’s chariot in 3a is a preliminary to the stealing of his chariot-wheel, then the “wheel-segment” borne by Heaven could be the disc of the Sun now restored to its proper place.However, much remains unclear in this hymn, and the interpretations given here are quite tentative.1. In partnership with you, Indra, these conveyors (of songs), conceiving the truth, thoroughly split apart the Vala cave,when, showing favor to the dawns, making the waters flow, you exerted your wondrous power (on them) and on the fertile cows, for the sake of Kutsa and at his thought.2.

The evidence"},{"pageNumber":1642,"pageContent":"X.1391625for their connection includes shared vocabulary and close lexical variants—e.g., mádhye . . . diváḥ 138.3 and divo﻿́ mádhye 139.2 “in the middle of heaven”; pradhí (“wheel segment”) 138.6 and paridhí (“encirclement”) 139.4; ahī́ “fertile cow” 138.1, 139.6; daṃsáya / dáṃsas 138.1, 2 “wondrous skill” and dákṣa 139.6 “skill, capability”—as well as ring composition: 138 begins with two verses about the opening of the Vala cave and the release of the fertile cows, and the final verse of 139 (vs. 6) returns to exactly this theme.More subtle is their shared thematic concern. As noted in the introduction to 138, that hymn seems to treat disturbances to the orderly progress of cosmic time and the heavenly bodies that measure it, the sun, the moon, and dawn. By contrast X.139 focuses on the sun, in part through its (partial) representations: Savitar (vss. 1, 3) and the heavenly Gandharva (see also I.123, the Vena hymn, where Vena and the Gandharva represent an amalgam of the sun and Soma). The hymn also depicts the sun as holding its proper place and performing its proper functions. Though in this hymn (vs. 2) as in the last one (vs. 3) the sun stands still in the middle of heaven, in 138 this stoppage seemed ominous, whereas in this hymn the sun’s position seems designed to give him the best view of the whole phenomenal world. It is repeatedly emphasized (vss. 1d, 2a, c, 3b) that he (or his representatives) sees everything, and as heavenly Gandharva he measures the airy realm (5b), again displaying proper cosmic progress.It must be admitted, however, that many things remain unclear in this hymn, particularly verse 4.1. With the rays of the sun, with golden hair, Savitar has raised up the unaging light from the east.At his instigation Pūṣan travels—the knowing cowherd surveying all beings.2. With his eye on men, he sits in the middle of heaven, having filled both world-halves and the space between.He watches over (his mares? the ladles?) facing toward ghee, facing in all directions, between the eastern and the western beacon.3.

Though in verse 2 the danger is confined and contrasted with the poets’ successful productions, the following verses give free rein to the destruc-tive power of wildfire with vivid descriptions of its progress through the land.The final two verses, in a different meter, append a magical charm, to banish dangerous fire from the land and make that land the abode of water and plants.The Anukramaṇī identifies “the four Śārṅgas” as the poets of the hymn.

In the first two verses he asks that the Aśvins aid him as they did others in past times. The third verse offers recompense for their aid: if they help him to produce insightful poems, these poems will be for them alone. Verses 4 and 6 expand the targets of the aid from Atri alone to his ritual companions, while verse 5 offers the mythological example of Bhujyu, often mentioned elsewhere as a client whose life the Aśvins saved, as a model for what we ourselves hope for.1.

Indra appears only in the first and last (6) verses as the recipient of the soma drink, represented ring-compositionally by the “drop” (índu) in both verses. His return to the hymn is anticipated by the minimal te “for you” in the penultimate verse 5. In between the poet first describes Soma’s talents (vss. 1–2), and then nar-rates (or alludes to the narrative of) the famous theft of Soma by the falcon. This account is highly poeticized, with vocabulary deployed in obscure metaphors. In our view both 3a and 4c refer, in very different ways, to the fortresses in which Soma"},{"pageNumber":1647,"pageContent":"X.1451630was confined (see IV.27.1 and IV.26.3 for the hundred fortresses, also keeping in mind that “fortress” [púr] is grammatically feminine). Since Soma is being guarded in heaven, when he looks down (vs. 3c) in search of his falcon rescuer he sees clouds, again metaphorically represented.The vivifying effects of Soma are treated in verses 5–6, as is his role in reinforc-ing the relationship (bandhútā “family tie,” 5d) between gods and men, by means of the sacrificial offering. Verse 6b may contain the first occurrences of the later notion of sacrifice as “surrender” (tyāga﻿́, found here in a different nominal derivative of the same root, tyájas). Indra takes the oblation surrendered by men and places it among the gods.1. Because this deathless drop here, like a courser, displays his masteryas lifelong skill for you, the ritual adept,2. He is a craftsman in poetic art among us and a mace for the one generous with gifts.Like a craftsman, he brings the exhilarating drink with pearls [=bubbles] on top—the exhilarating drink that gets results.3. Eager for the energetic falcon, the bull among his own females [=fortresses?]looked down at those puffing up like snakes [/swelling like fertile cows] [=clouds?] —4. He whom the fine-feathered (bird), the son of the falcon, brought here from afar— him who had a hundred wheels [=concentric fortresses?]—who is the track of the fertile cow—5. Whom the falcon brought here for you with his foot, the cherished one who keeps the wolf away, who is the ruddy housing of the stalk—by him is vitality, is lifetime lengthened for living; through him does our family tie stay vigilant.6. Thus, by the drop Indra will secure that great surrender (of the offering) also among the gods.By your will is vitality, is lifetime lengthened, o you of strong will; by your will has this soma here been pressed from us.X.145 (971) Against CowivesIndrā ṇī6 verses: anuṣṭubh, except paṅkti 6Attributed to Indra’s wife, Indrāṇī, this hymn is spoken in the 1st person by a woman conjuring against her cowife for the affections of their joint husband. In Atharvan style (and with an Atharvaveda correspondent, AVŚ III.18), it combines ritual/magic action with a verbal spell. The speaker digs the efficacious plant (vss."},{"pageNumber":1648,"pageContent":"X.14616311–2) and applies the plant to her husband (vs. 6), while confidently proclaiming her victory over her rival (esp. vss. 3–5). A similar hymn against cowives is found at X.159.1. This plant do I dig, most powerful shoot,with which (a woman) repels her cowife, with which (she) acquires her own husband completely.2. You with outstretched leaves, luck-bringing, god-sped, possessing victorious might—blow away my cowife, make my husband my own.3. Higher am I, o higher one, higher even than the higher ones.But she who is my cowife, she is lower than the lower ones.4. I do not take [=mention] her name, nor does she rest by this person [=husband].To the farthest farness we (all) make my cowife go.5. I am gaining victory, and you [=plant] are victorious.Both having become victoriously mighty, we two shall be victorious over my cowife.6. On you [=husband] have I laid the (plant) that wins victory; I have harnessed you with an even more victorious one.Let your mind run forth after me, like a cow after a calf, like water along its path.X.146 (972) Lady of the Wilderness (Araṇyānı̄)Devamuni Airammada6 verses: anuṣṭubhThis lovely and evocative hymn has been much translated. It is dedicated to the spirit of the araṇya, the wild place, and the contrast between the wild place and the settled one, an opposition that runs throughout Indian literature, dominates the hymn. Despite the ostensible dedication, the poet tries as much as possible to evade the wilderness and conjure up the safety of the village. From the start, in the first verse he expresses surprise that the Lady of the Wilderness herself doesn’t inquire for a village or settlement (grā́mam); he is surprised that she is not afraid of her own domain. The strange sounds that accompany the Lady in her progress and the strange (and unidentified) animals that make those sounds in verse 2 clearly unsettle the poet, and in verses 3 and 4 the poet, seeming him-self to be in the wilderness at nightfall, attempts to transform the threatening sights and sounds of the wild into reassuring domestic scenes—cows grazing and lowing, woodsmen, the creak of a cart—though this cheerful self-deception does not last. The poet abruptly breaks off the sequence with “(something) has shrieked!” The final two verses of this short hymn contain a formal praise of"},{"pageNumber":1649,"pageContent":"X.1471632Araṇyānī, but even this begins with the negative, and slightly nervous, reassur-ance that she doesn’t kill unless she’s attacked; the positive portions of the praise come second.1. O Lady of the Wilderness, Lady of the Wilderness, you there, who seem to be lost just ahead.How is that you don’t ask for the village? Does fear not find you at all?2. When the ciccika (bird?/bug?) helps out the bull-roarer [=frog? bird?] as it speaks,the Lady of the Wilderness displays her greatness like (a king?) who hurtles along amid the clash of cymbals.3. And it’s as if cows are eating and as if a settlement is seen,and the Lady of the Wilderness at evening—it’s as if there’s a cart creaking.4. Surely it’s someone calling his cow; surely another has been splitting wood.But staying by the Lady of the Wilderness at evening, one imagines “(Something) has shrieked!”5. In truth, the Lady of the Wilderness does no slaughter, if someone else does not attack.Having eaten sweet fruit, one settles down at pleasure.6. Fragrant with ointments, sweet-smelling, providing much food though she does no plowing,the Mother of wild beasts, the Lady of the Wilderness have I proclaimed.X.147 (973) IndraSuvedas Śairī ṣi5 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 5The poet begins his hymn (vs. 1, 2ab) by proclaiming his trust in Indra’s “battle fury” (manyú), on the basis of the god’s deeds and his dominance over the cosmic spaces. It turns out that the poet has something more than simply praise on his mind. Indra and his battle fury are much in demand among men in search of vic-tory and its spoils (vs. 2cd), and the poet recommends his patrons to Indra’s atten-tion and care (vs. 3). He realizes, however, that securing Indra’s help requires proper ritual observance (vs. 4). The hymn ends (vs. 5) with explicit requests for Indra’s aid and bounty, such desires having been only indirectly expressed earlier in the hymn.1. I put my trust in your foremost battle-fury, in that you smashed Vr̥tra and labored at the manly work,in that both world-halves yield to you and even earth trembles from your tempest, o possessor of the stone."},{"pageNumber":1650,"pageContent":"X.14816332.

The poet seems especially aware that Indra bestows his aid on those whom he likes (see esp. vss. 1c, 3b, 4c) and so emphasizes men’s need to offer abundant praise and oblations with a cheerful spirit.1. After having pressed soma we praise you, Indra, and also after having won the prize, you powerfully manly one.Bring us well-being (for him) in whom you take pleasure. Through ourselves and our lineage may we win, aided by you.2. Lofty were you when you were just born, o champion Indra. Along with the sun, you should overcome the Dāsa clans,(as you did) the one placed in hiding, fit to be hidden, hidden in the waters [=Vr̥tra]. We offer soma as if in a gushing (stream).3. Or, (Indra,) chant in response to the hymns of the stranger—as the wise one, inspired poet among the seers, taking pleasure in good thinking.May we be the ones who find enjoyment by means of the soma drinks—through this and through the portions for you, who are conveyed on a chariot."},{"pageNumber":1651,"pageContent":"X.14916344.

Thus this hymn may be making a cross reference to another hymn in the samḥitā. Although there are no blatant links between the two hymns, both are concerned with the divisions of the cosmos and Savitar’s relationship to them. In this hymn especially Savitar’s cosmogonic role is highlighted.1. Savitar brought the earth to rest with his fastening straps; in the place with no prop Savitar made heaven fast.Savitar has milked the boisterous midspace like a stallion, (has milked out) the sea bound within the unfathomable (realm).2. Where the propped-up sea flooded forth—Savitar knows that, o Child of the Waters—from there was the world, from there was the airy realm arisen; from there heaven and earth spread out.3. After this (world) here there came into being the other one [=heaven], deserving the sacrifice, with its fill of immortal creation.Certainly the fine-feathered Garutmant(-bird) of Savitar [=sun] was born earlier, and it (was born) in accordance with his support.4. Like cows to the village, like a warrior to his horses, like a bellowing, benevolent milker to her calf,like a husband to his wife—let him come down to us, the supporter of heaven, Savitar bringing all desirable things.5. Just as Hiraṇyastūpa Āṅgirasa called on you, Savitar, when this prize (was in question),even so, chanting to you for help, extolling you, I stay wakeful facing toward you, as if toward the plant of soma."},{"pageNumber":1652,"pageContent":"X.1501635X.150 (976) AgniMr̥ḍīka Vāsiṣṭha5 verses: br̥hatī 1–3, upariṣṭājjyotis or jagatī 4, upariṣṭājjyotis 5A simple hymn with a rigid skeletal structure, despite the variety of meters. The last pāda of every verse begins with a form of mr̥ḍīká “grace, mercy,” in all but verse 4 the dative mr̥ḍīkā́ya. (This repetition is clearly responsible for the Anukramaṇī’s ascription to a poet with the given name Mr̥ḍīka.) The object of the poet’s address throughout is the god Agni; for the first half of the hymn (through vs. 3ab) he is unnamed though easily identifiable from his attributes; from then on a form of his name opens every hemistich. The contents of the hymn are quite straightfor-ward: Agni is urged to come to our sacrifice, bringing the gods along. In the final verse (5) his aid to various legendary humans is recalled, and the poet names him-self as Vasiṣṭha (or “best one”)—again, no doubt responsible for the Anukramaṇī’s patronymic Vāsiṣṭha, although the distinctive clan refrain of the Vasiṣṭhas is not present.The final two verses also contain the epithet puro﻿́hita, literally “set in front,” applied first to Agni (4a) and then to the poet Vasiṣṭha (5cd). Ritually speaking the sacrificial fire is indeed “set in front”: the offering fire is established on the eastern edge of the ritual ground. However, there is no clear ritual reason to refer to the poet as “set in front,” and it seems likely that in this late hymn the term has already become the designation of a particular type of priest, in later times the king’s “house-priest.”1. Even when you have been kindled, you are kindled (again), o oblation-bearer for the gods.With the Ādityas, the Rudras, the Vasus, come to us here. For grace come to us here.2. This sacrifice here—having delighted in this speech, come near to it.We mortals call you, kindled one; for grace we call.3.

Agni, the god, became the one set in front [/Purohita] of the gods; Agni have the human seers kindled.Agni do I invoke greatly at the winning of the stakes; (I invoke) his grace for the winning of the stakes.5.

In its Vedic origins it refers not to “faith,” at least in the Western, Christian sense (cf. its Latin cognate credō), but rather to “trust”—espe-cially in the efficacy of cultural institutions, and there especially in hospitality and the sacrifice, itself a specialized type of hospitality. (For further discussion see Jamison [1996a: 176–84].)In this hymn its close ties to the sacrifice are quite clear. Note especially the last verse (5), which makes not-so-veiled reference to the three soma-pressings; the appearance of Vāyu in the previous verse probably refers to the fact that he receives the first soma offering at the Morning Pressing. One of the important facets of trust in the sacrifice is the certainty that a properly performed sacrifice will produce material rewards for the performer, and this belief is reflected throughout the hymn; see especially verses 2–4.1. With trust is the fire kindled; with trust is the oblation poured.We at the head of good fortune make known our trust with speech.2. O Trust, this (speech) spoken by me: make it dear to him who gives, dear to him who intends to give,and dear among the benefactors who offer sacrifice, o Trust.3. Just the gods created trust in themselves among the powerful lords,so among the benefactors who offer sacrifice make what has been spoken by us trust(ed).4. Trust do the gods revere, sacrificing for themselves with Vāyu as their herdsman—trust, with a purpose that comes from their heart. By trust one gains possession of goods.5.

But the birth motif disappears (except for an attenuated version in vs. 5c): the hymn then continues with standard praise of his powers—the word o﻿́jas “might” is positioned prominently in four of the five verses (2–5).1. Rocking (him), the busy women attend upon the new-born Indra,receiving (him) as their share of the abundance of heroes.2. You, Indra, were born from power, from strength, from might.You, bull, are really a bull.3. You, Indra, are the smasher of Vr̥tra. You spread out the midspace.You propped up heaven with your might.4.

Soma purifies himself for some; others reverently approach ghee.Those for whom honey flows forth—right to them let him go now.2.

The Sadānvās are monumentally ugly (vs. 1) and seem to pose a threat especially to unborn children (vs. 2) and, in the Atharvaveda passages, to the household and livestock in general. In this hymn they are also sexually menacing and sexually repulsive (vs. 4).In the first three verses the Sadānvā is attacked and sent away in good Atharvan fashion, but the hymn takes another rhetorical turn starting in verse 4, which announces the defeat of Indra’s rivals in the high style of a victory paean, to the"},{"pageNumber":1656,"pageContent":"X.1561639apparent accompaniment of the Sadānvās beating their breasts in stylized mourn-ing. And in verse 5 the defeat of the hostile forces has been effected not by an Atharvan-like charm, as in the earlier parts of the hymn, but by ritual activity on the sacrificial ground and by the creation of “fame” among the gods—both features that are associated with the more solemn R̥gvedic priestly and martial ethic. This shift in diction and attitude is striking, and it may have been felt necessary (or at least desir-able) to “R̥gvedify” the charm when it was incorporated into the R̥gveda collection.1. You one-eyed, deformed demoness, go to the mountain—you Sadānvā.With the warriors of Śirimbiṭha, with them we banish you.2.

The first three verses express the hope that this kindling of the fire will bring goods to the ritual participants, an oblique reference to the distribution of the priestly gifts at the Morning Pressing. This blatant desire for reward is somewhat camou-flaged by couching it in terms of contests (vs. 1), cattle raids (vs. 2), and chariot racing (vs. 3).1.

The last two verses are notable for what is probably the only reflection in the R̥gveda of that corporate entity, the Asuras, and of the eternal hostility between them and the Devas (“gods”), ubiquitous in middle Vedic and providing a major mythological cycle in those texts. Elsewhere in the R̥gveda the word ásura generally means “lord” and is applied to gods as well as to humans, viewed positively or negatively. It is only in this very late hymn that we see the germ of the later division of divine beings into the two inimical moieties of Devas and Asuras. For further on this question, which has important implications for Indo-Iranian as well as Vedic religion, see Wash Edward Hale (1986) as well as the discus-sion in our introduction and passim.1. These living worlds here let us bring to success—we and Indra and all the gods.2. Our sacrifice and our own body and our offspring may Indra, along with the Ādityas, set in order.3.

But, whereas in X.145 she was in the act of performing the spell with which she hoped to vanquish her cowife, in this hymn her triumph is complete. She recites a victory paean, in the appropriate high rhetorical style—albeit with some dips into the vernacular, such as the diminutivized derivative of the personal pro-noun in verse 1, māmaká “li’l ole me.” It is worth noting that in verse 3 she extends her triumph to her sons and her daughter; as the early parts of the Rāmāyaṇa teach us, one of the most important reasons that cowives plot against each other is to secure preferment for their children.1. Up has gone yonder sun; up this good fortune of li’l ole me.I, a cunning woman, now have gained victory over my husband, (so that I am) victorious.2. I am the beacon; I am the head; I am the powerful debater.Only my will should my husband follow, when I am victorious."},{"pageNumber":1659,"pageContent":"X.16016423.

According to the Anukramaṇī, the poet is a descen-dant of the Viśvāmitras, and the last two words of the hymn, śunáṃ huvema “for blessing we would invoke” are the first two words of the Viśvāmitra clan refrain, found in most of the Viśvāmitra triṣṭubh Indra hymns (III.30.22, etc.).1.

I release you, with an oblation, to living, from the unknown disease, from the kingly disease.Or if a Grabber has truly grabbed him in this way, from her, o Indra and Agni, release him.2. If his lifetime is exhausted, or he is (already) departed, or if he has just gone down to the face of death,I bring him here from the lap of Dissolution. I have redeemed him for a hundred autumns.3. With an oblation with a thousand eyes, conferring a hundred autumns and a hundred lifetimes, I have brought him here,so that Indra will lead him through a hundred autumns to the far shore of all difficult going.4.

The stages of pregnancy are nicely"},{"pageNumber":1661,"pageContent":"X.1631644laid out in verse 3, a good example of the indirect means by which we can gain information about Vedic people’s knowledge and conceptualization of “real life.” The methods by which the “ill-named affliction” might gain access to the fetus are graphically depicted in verses 4–6. In verse 5 it is somewhat startling that masquer-ading as a brother (in addition to husband or lover) would give intimate access to the pregnant woman; this whiff of incest is reminiscent of the situation between the siblings Yama and Yamī in X.10.1. In concert with a sacred formulation let Agni, demon-smasher, repel from herewhatever evil-named affliction lies on your embryo, in your womb.2. Whatever evil-named affliction lies on your embryo, in your womb,Agni, along with a sacred formulation, has banished the flesh-eater.3.

This hymn provides us with what we might term a body-part litany. The officiant declares the removal of disease from a series of related body parts in each verse, each associated with a particular area of the body—another valuable window on how Vedic peoples divided up and named reality. Although the names of the more standard body parts (eyes, ears, etc.) are well known and have well-established cognates, the identification of some of the more obscure terms is uncertain, though the locational association narrows the range of possibilities.1. From your eyes, your nostrils, your ears, your chin,I tear the disease of the head out of you—from your brain, your tongue.2. From your neck(bones?), the (bones of the?) nape of your neck, your vertebrae, your backbone,I tear the disease of the torso out of you—from your shoulders, from your arms."},{"pageNumber":1662,"pageContent":"X.16416453.

It begins with the curt dismissal of an otherwise unknown “Lord of Thought” (or “Lord of Mind”), ordering him to go far away and speak to the goddess Dissolution (Nirr̥ti), who presides over chaos and calamity. The Lord of Thought is to provide her with some examples of men’s thoughts, in verse 2. These examples seem to be the sort of harmless self-delusions whereby people reassure themselves that all is going well for them. But in verses 3 and 4 the verbal behavior becomes less innocent—culminating in one of the worst offenses in Vedic India (and indeed Indo-Iranian), deceit (vs. 4). We ask various gods, including Indra “Lord of the Sacred Formulation” (voc. brahmaṇas pate), presumably Indra in his role as Br̥haspati, to distance these offenses from us. The final verse celebrates the success of this request and expresses our desire that all such offenses be visited on our enemy.The unifying theme of the hymn is thus all sorts of mental and verbal action, whether harmless or hostile, whether done consciously (awake) or not (asleep), or even both (the “waking dream” of vs. 5).1. Go away, o Lord of Thought—stride away; move far away.(When) far away, announce to Dissolution: “Of many kinds is the thought of the living.2. “Lucky is the choice they make; lucky the right (horse) they yoke;lucky the eye (they keep) on the son of Vivasvant [=Yama] (—or so they think). In many places is the thought of the living.”3. Whatever pass we’ve reached by hope, by blame, by curse, when awake or sleeping.let Agni put away, at a distance from us, all those things ill-done and unpleasing."},{"pageNumber":1663,"pageContent":"X.16516464.

Not surpris-ingly, given their style and contents, the verses of this hymn are found in variant form in the Atharvaveda (AVŚ VI.27, 29.1, 28.1).1. O gods, when the dove, sent as a messenger of Dissolution, has come here to seek,we will chant to it, and we will perform expulsion. Let there be weal for our two-footed, weal for our four-footed.2. Let the dove that has been sent be kindly to us; o gods, let the omen-bird be without offense in our house.Let Agni, the inspired poet, take pleasure in our oblation, and so let the winged missile avoid us.3. The winged missile will not take us by deception. In the corner [?] it sets its footprint in the fireplace.Let there be weal for our cattle and for our humans. Let the dove not harm us here, o gods.4. When the owl screeches, that comes to nothing; likewise when the dove set its footprint in the fire.The one for whom it was sent forth as messenger—to that one let there be reverence: to Yama, (who is) Death.5.

Using the well-nigh universal tropes of high and low, he repeatedly emphasizes the spatial (and thus conceptual) position of his defeated enemies, who are literally beneath his feet (vss. 2, 5; see also vss. 3–4). Verse 4 is notable for the trio of attributes that the speaker seizes from his rivals, a set that easily accommodates a trifunctional (Dumézilian) analysis: “cognition” as the higher mental power appropriate to the priestly First Function, “command-ment” representative of the warrior-ruler Second Function, and “company, assem-bly” the Third Function mass of followers. Although we are not over-sympathetic to the Dumézilian paradigm, this particular passage gains resonance from such an analysis.1. Make me bull over my equals, widely victorious over my rivals,smiter of my rivals, wide-ruling cattle-lord of cattle.2. I am a smiter of rivals, like Indra, unharmable, invulnerable.Beneath my feet are my rivals: all these here have been stood upon.3.

One of Indra’s great deeds, the conquering of the sun, is alluded to (vss. 1–2), and already in verse 1 he is asked for wealth. The final verse is spoken by Indra himself, who accepts both the soma and the praise while recognizing that he is entitled to these offerings only if he provides good things in return. One noteworthy feature is the poet-priest’s claim to have himself consumed copious amounts of soma (vs. 4)."},{"pageNumber":1665,"pageContent":"X.16816481.

But again, as in X.186, the hymn only mentions Vāta, a god of wind with more physical and natural characteristics of wind than Vāyu and little or no ritual profile. Nonetheless, Vāta is given full-dress eulogistic treatment in this little hymn: The first verse begins with his name, and the opening, “now the greatness [acc.] of Wind . . . ” (vā́tasya nú mahimā́nam . . .), recalls celebratory openings like I.32.1 índrasya nú vīryā̀ṇi . . . “now the heroic deeds of Indra . . . ”). The final pāda (vs. 4d) is a standard formula of homage, with the recipient in the dative (“to him, to Wind . . . ”) and an instrumental of the type of offering (“with our oblation”), ending with the 1st plural optative vidhema “might we do honor”); see numerous parallels, including VIII.48.12–13, I.121.1–9.In between the swift progress of Wind, his chariot, and his retinue (which we consider to be the eddies and gusts that are characteristic of any strong wind) is nicely described.1.

Let them crop plants full of nourishment.Let them drink (waters) full of fat, providing riches to the living. Setting them loose, Rudra, be merciful to our food on the hoof.2.

Commentators have suggested other deities: Dawn (vs. 1), Sūrya (vs. 2), Agni (vs. 3), Dawn (vs. 4), or Sūrya (vss. 1–3). These particular identifications cannot be confirmed, but it is clear that this is a hymn appropriate to early morning. In verse 2 the subject awakens mortals. Though verse 1 is less clear, the cows there are on the move after giving milk (in our interpretation): as real cows, they are going to pasture after the morning milking; as dawn cows they are following the track of the sun out of the east and across the sky, having filled the sky with their milky light. In the third verse the sacrifice is begun, as is appropriate at dawn. And finally in verse 4 Dawn makes an explicit appearance upon her birth.1. Drive here along with your longing. The cows follow your track, when (they have given milk) with their udders.2. Drive here with good insight, as the most bounteous one, along with those of good gifts, as you awaken the bountiful while aging the combatants.3.

The keyword of the hymn is dhruvá “firm”—firmness being the quality most desired in the royal candidate—and in fact the Anukramaṇī has extracted this word for the name of the poet. The affirmation of the chosen king by both the human clans (viś, vss. 1, 6) and various gods is required. Among the gods we find Indra, the arche-typal warrior king (vss. 2, 5–6), and Varuṇa, the archetypal peacetime king (vs. 5). (For these two aspects of kingship, divided between the two gods, see especially IV.42.) In addition there are the ritually connected gods, who would officiate at the consecration ceremony: Brahmaṇaspati (vs. 3)/Br̥haspati (vs. 5), who represent the verbal portion, and Agni (vs. 5) and Soma (vs. 3), who participate in the physical portion. Soma, as ritual substance, is found in verse 6, which effects the king’s installation. The hymn has parallels in both recensions of the Atharvaveda, and elsewhere in Vedic literature."},{"pageNumber":1669,"pageContent":"X.174–17516521. I have brought you here: be among (us).

Here the signature idiom is abhí-√vr̥t “roll over,” again providing the Anukramaṇī’s poet’s name. The king’s ability to “roll over” and crush his opponents as Indra did, leaving him the only one standing, is celebrated and ritually effected with an oblation named with the idiom and associated with Indra (vss. 1, 4).1. The Over-rolling oblation with which Indra rolled over (his enemies),with that, o Brahmaṇaspati, make us roll to kingship.2. Having rolled over the rivals, over those who are hostile to us,stand over the one who gives battle, over the one who is envious of us.3. God Savitar has made you—Soma has made you roll over—made you roll over all creatures, so that you will be an Over-roller.4. The oblation through which Indra, when he performed it, became the highest brilliant one,that (oblation) I have now performed, o gods: I have therefore become without rivals.5.

The only real difficulty is found in verse 4. Although the precise meaning of the first hemistich is disputed, it seems to these readers that this verse almost paradoxically frees Agni from his birth as a god in order to situate him firmly in the mortal sphere, where human life takes place: the theme of Agni’s “dual citizenship” is a common one in the R̥gveda.1. The sons of the R̥bhus [=flames], their circles, bellow out loftily—they who, deriving all nourishment, feed upon (heaven and) earth as if on a mother cow.2. Bring forward the god Jātavedas with a godly insight.He will convey our oblations in their proper order.3. This Hotar right here, seeking the gods, is led forth to sacrifice.Decked out like the chariot of a traveler, he comes into view, glowing with heat, in his own person.4.

The images, though not always clear, echo many found in similarly mystical treatments of poetic inspiration, such as the famous Vena hymn (X.123), and make a powerful impression.1.

Here it seems to be the name of a prodigious and mythical racehorse, much like Dadhikrā(van) (see IV.38–40); indeed verse 3 here is a vari-ant of the Dadhikrā verse IV.38.10. Both horses are associated with Trasadasyu, leader of the Pūrus: his association with Dadhikrā is announced directly in the first Dadhikrā verse (IV.38.1), whereas his association with Tārkṣya is mediated through the horse’s name, which is a vr̥ddhi derivative of Tr̥kṣi, himself a descendant of Trasadasyu (see VIII.22.7, see also VI.46.8).1. This god-sped prizewinner, victorious overtaker of (other) chariots,him whose wheel-felly cannot be damaged, the swift one driving to battle—Tārkṣya would we summon here for our well-being.2. Summoning his generosity again and again, like that of Indra, we would board him like a boat for our well-being.O you two who are broad like the two wide (worlds), voluminous and deep—let us not suffer harm of you in our coming nor in our going.3.

The first verse invites the priests to assess the readiness of the libation; the second and third verses, later the Puro'nuvākyā and Yājyā respectively, invite Indra to the midday service and offer him the cooked por-tion, clearly identified in verse 3c.1. Stand up, (you priests)! Look down on Indra’s portion which is due.If it is cooked, pour it! If it is uncooked, wait!2. The oblation is (now) cooked. Indra, fare forth here; the sun has arrived at the middle of its road.Your comrades await you with servings (of food), as a housekeeper awaits the master of the barnyard who is making his rounds.3. (The oblation) in the udder is cooked, I think, and the one in the fire is cooked. Well cooked, I think, is also this newer truth [=hymn].O mace-bearing Indra, you who do many deeds—drink of the sour milk of the Midday Pressing, taking enjoyment of it.X.180 (1006) IndraJaya Aindri3 verses: triṣṭubhIndra’s victories over his (and our) enemies are the special focus of this hymn, but the poet does not fail to mention our interest in his gifts as well (vs. 1).1. O much-summoned one, you have vanquished your rivals. Your tempestuous power is preeminent. Now let your giving be here:Indra, bring good things here along with the priestly gift. You are the master of rich rivers.2. Like a fearsome wild beast, living in the mountains and roaming wherever it wants, you have come here from the farther distance.Having honed sharp your fang and your wheel-rim, Indra, carve apart your rivals. Shove aside the scornful.3. Indra, you were born to dominion and to might worth winning, you bull of the settled domains.You drove away the people that are not allies.

Whose name is “Spread” and “Wide-spread,” which is the oblation of the oblation in anuṣṭubh meter:from the flashing Founder and from Savitar and Viṣṇu has Vasiṣṭha carried here the Rathaṃtara.2. They found what was placed beyond, what was the highest hidden domain of the sacrifice:from the flashing Founder and from Savitar and Viṣṇu, from Agni, has Bharadvāja brought here the Br̥hat.3. They found, as they reflected with their mind, the yajus that sprang forth first, going the way of the gods:from the flashing Founder and from Savitar and Viṣṇu, from the sun, have they carried here the hot milk (gharma).X.182 (1008) Br̥haspatiTapurmūrdhan Bārhaspatya3 verses: triṣṭubhBr̥haspati, the master of ritual speech, is called upon to aid our speech, but also to punish all forms of evil speech and their speakers.1. Let Br̥haspati lead (our thought) across the difficult depths, but for the utterer of evil he will lead his thought back (against him).– He hurls aside malediction and smites away ill-will; then he will create luck and life for the sacrificer.2. Let Narāśaṃsa help us at the Fore-offering; let the After-offering be luck for us at the invocations.– He hurls aside malediction and smites away ill-will; then he will create luck and life for the sacrificer.3.

As Geldner points out, the situation seems to be similar to that depicted in I.179 (the Agastya–Lopāmudrā dialogue), with the husband ending a period of asceticism (see vs. 1b) and the wife eager for sex and its product, children. It thus conforms to the pattern common throughout Indian literature of the reluctant ascetic and the sexually aggressive female (see Jamison 1996a: 15–17 and passim), but in the short exchange here the husband seems more amenable than usual, and the rhetorical responsions between the two verses make the pair seem more attuned to each other. The final verse (3) is spoken by an unidentified spirit responsible for all sorts of fertility, who promises sons.1. [Wife:] I saw you with my mind, as you became ever more cognizant with yours, you born from fervor, developed from fervor.Bestowing progeny here, wealth here, progenerate yourself with progeny, o you who desire sons.2. [Husband:] I saw you with my mind, as you became ever more intent with yours, being in distress in your own body at your period.Up here, near to me. You should become a young woman (again).

There a married couple prepares to have sex in order to conceive; here a range of gods and goddesses responsible for conception and safe pregnancy are called upon to ensure conception followed by a full-term birth.1.

Certainly the Anukramaṇī seems to have concluded something of the sort, since it identifies the divinity of the hymn as Aditi, though she appears only obliquely.1. Great be the heavenly help of the three—of Mitra, of Aryaman,of Varuṇa—help difficult to assail.2. For neither at home nor on wild waysdoes an evil-speaking cheater hold sway over them—3. For whom the sons of Aditi hold forth inexhaustible light,for the mortal to live.X.186 (1012) V āyuUla Vātāyana3 verses: gāyatrīAs with X.168, although the Anukramaṇī identifies the divinity of this hymn as Vāyu, he is only called Vāta “Wind” here. He is credited with the ability to provide healing (vs. 1) and, in all three verses, to keep us alive and prolong our lifetimes. This strong association between life and the wind must be mediated through the latter’s identification (bandhu) with breath, although this identification is not made explicit in the hymn.1. Let the wind blow hither a remedy, which is luck itself, joy itself, for our heart.He will lengthen our lifetimes.2. O Wind, you are father to us, and brother, and comrade to us.Make us live.3.

Rouse forth speech for Agni, for the bull of the settlements.He will carry us across hatreds.2. Who from the distant distance shines across the wastelands,he will carry us across hatreds.3. Who grinds down the demonic forces, the bull with flaming flame,he will carry us across hatreds.4. Who looks at all creatures separately and sees them whole,he will carry us across hatreds.5.

The focus of this hymn is the sacrifice and Agni’s role in it.1. Spur forth now Jātavedas, the prizewinning horse,to sit here on this ritual grass of ours.2. For this Jātavedas here, whose heroes are poets, who grants rewards,I rouse forth a great praise hymn.3.

The former identification seems far more likely, or, rather, the hymn appears to be set at the dawn sacrifice and to play with the various sources of light"},{"pageNumber":1677,"pageContent":"X.190–1911660that compete and combine at that time: the sun and the ritual fire, as well as Dawn (vs. 2ab). The fire, and in part its counterpart the sun, is portrayed as a variety of animals: a (male) cow (vs. 1), a buffalo (vs. 2), and a bird. The association of speech with the bird is also found in the Pataṃga hymn (X.177) and probably reflects the importance of ritual speech at the dawn sacrifice. There are no signs of snakes, much less their queen.1. This dappled cow has stridden here and sat in front of its motherand its father, as it goes forth toward the sun.2. She moves within the realms of light, breathing in from his breathing-out.The buffalo has looked out across heaven.3. He shines [/rules] over the thirty domains.

The entities created and the order and source of their cre-ation are curious and thought-provoking, but unlike the famous cosmogonic hymn X.129, there are no puzzles to decode.1. Both truth and reality were born from heat when it was kindled.From that, night was born, and from that the undulating sea.2. From the undulating sea was born the year,which distributes the days and nights and exerts its will over everyone who blinks [=mortals].3.

The R̥gveda Saṃhitā (“Collection”) has assembled the poetic products of numer-ous separate clans, who also had their own cultic practices and who presumably"},{"pageNumber":1678,"pageContent":"X.1911661coexisted in an uneasy vacillation between semi-hostility and wary cooperation. This hymn collection was produced under the new circumstances of a centralized (or centralizing) sociopolitical regime, generally considered to be the Kuru kings, which sought to impose (or encourage) a standardized, shared ritual culture—the R̥gveda collection being its most enduring product—that would also support the political unification.The hymn begins (vs. 1) with the ritual fire, which brings all the Ārya together, including those who don’t seem to want it (1b), and is the most visible representa-tion of the underlying unity of their ritual praxis. There’s an implicit warning in this verse: the ritual fire itself will appropriate the goods of any hold-outs. Verse 2 then provides a positive model: like the gods, who put aside their differences to take their common shares in the sacrifice, we should make a common sacrifice (which, implicitly it is said, will make us more successful, once we no long have to compete among ourselves all the time). Verse 3 outlines the results of the program to devise a standardized ritual shared by all. The second half of this verse is a virtual speech act: the speaker performs the two fundamental components of the ritual—ritual speech (the mantra) and ritual action (the oblation)—thus by this announcement effectively creating the new, shared ritual. Verse 4 promises that the results will be worth the effort. For further discussion, see Proferes (2007: 11 and passim).1. Over and over, o Agni, you bull, you wrest together all things from the stranger.You are kindled in the footprint of refreshment. Bring goods here to us.2. Come together, speak together; together let your thoughts agree,just as the gods of long ago, coming to an agreement together, reverently approach their sacrificial portion.3. Common to them all is the solemn utterance, common the assembly, common their thought along with their perception.I (hereby) utter an utterance common to you all on your behalf; with an oblation common to you all I offer on your behalf.4.
