The materials cast light on the first studies of the Babi and Baha’i Faiths, new religious phenomena which, in Baron Rosen’s time, were emerging in Persia. Iran has always been a strategic concern of Russia’s geopolitical interests and the tradi-tional importance which has been given to Persia has manifested itself in hundreds of documents and writings collected by the pre-revolutionary Russian diplomats and scholars. These documents, large parts of which have never been published before, reveal interesting information on the attitude of the Russian government towards religious and ethnic minorities as well as towards related issues within the Russian Empire and abroad.Bringing together materials in Russian, English, Persian, Arabic, and French related to the Babi and Baha’i Faiths from Rosen’s archive in the original lan-guages with an English translation, this book will be of great interest to students and researchers in the fields of Iranian Studies, Religion, and Middle East Studies among others.Youli A.

There are an estimated 5 to 6 million Baha’is throughout the world, from different ethnic backgrounds, in more than 200 countries and territories. As pointed out by William Hatcher and J. Douglas Martin, ‘The new faith is a distinct religion, based entirely on the teachings of its founder, Bahá’u’lláh. It is not a cult, a reform movement or sect within any other faith, nor merely a philosophical sys-tem. Neither does it represent an attempt to create a new religion syncretistically by bringing together different teachings chosen from other religions’ (Hatcher and Douglas Martin 2002: xiii). Its history goes back to 1844, when a young mer-chant in the Persian city of Shiraz, Siyyid ‘Alí-Muhammad proclaimed his mis-sion as the bearer of a new divine revelation. He assumed the title ‘Báb,’ meaning ‘the Gate,’ and is considered by Baha’is to be the forerunner of Bahá’u’lláh, and Prophet-Founder of the Babi Faith. The Báb declared in his many Writings1 that he saw his mission as one of alerting the people to the imminent advent of another Prophet, ‘Him Whom God shall make manifest.’2 The Báb addressed the issue of this Prophet on almost every page of his major doctrinal work, the Persian Bayán.As the Báb gained followers and the Babi movement gathered strength, its doc-trines inflamed the Shi‘ih clergy. Their resentment led to the Báb’s imprisonment, the persecution of his followers, his trial before the Muslim divines in Tabriz, and finally his execution in 1850. The Báb left his adherents in a state of constant expectation of the promised messenger. In the Persian Bayán, he urged his com-munity to recognize and accept this bearer of a new divine revelation, wherever and whenever he chose to arise and make himself manifest. The only proof and sign of his prophetic mission should be his divine verses.Among the prominent followers of the Báb was a Persian nobleman, Mírzá Husayn-‘Alí (Núrí), known by the title ‘Bahá’u’lláh,’ meaning the ‘Glory of God’ (1817–1892). Although Bahá’u’lláh and the Báb never met, they corresponded. After the attempt on the Shah’s life by two misguided Babis in 1852,3 causing an upsurge of persecution, Bahá’u’lláh was put in an underground prison in Tehran"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"2 Introductionfor four months. It was there, as he relates in his Writings,4 that he first received a revelation, through a dream of a ‘Maid of Heaven,’ that he was the divine messen-ger promised by the Báb. When Bahá’u’lláh was exonerated of complicity in the plot against the Shah, the royal government – which was initially determined to execute him – released him from prison, but banished him to Iraq, which was part of the Ottoman Empire at the time. Bahá’u’lláh was thus sent to Baghdad, accom-panied by some members of his family and companions. The exile in Iraq lasted from 1853 to 1863, until the Persian government succeeded in persuading the Ottoman authorities to banish Bahá’u’lláh further away from the Persian borders. Consequently, he was moved to Constantinople (Istanbul), and soon afterwards to Adrianople (present-day Edirne).On the eve of his departure from Baghdad to Constantinople (April–May 1863), Bahá’u’lláh declared to his followers that he was the ‘Promised One’ foretold by the Báb. Once in Adrianople, he began to publicly proclaim his mission, address-ing Epistles and Tablets to the kings and rulers of the day, urging them to estab-lish world peace, justice, and unity. Although most Babis gradually accepted Bahá’u’lláh as the one whom the Báb had repeatedly referred to as ‘Him Whom God shall make manifest,’ he faced fierce opposition within the Babi community, led by his half-brother, Mírzá Yahyá Subh-i-Azal, and a company of those who followed him. This latter faction became known as ‘Azalis.’5Fearing the further spread of the Baha’i teachings, the Persian ambassador to Constantinople exerted every effort to convince the Turkish authorities of the political and religious danger posed by the Baha’i exiles. Their apprehension, and the constant plotting on the part of Mírzá Yahyá and some of his supporters aimed at discrediting Bahá’u’lláh in the eyes of the Ottoman government caused the latter to ‘resolve the question of the exiled community once and for all.’ In 1868, Bahá’u’lláh and his followers in Adrianople were committed to perpetual imprisonment in the penal colony at Acre in Palestine. As Hatcher and Martin point out, ‘Acre was chosen because it was confidently believed that Bahá’u’lláh could not survive the experience. In the 1860s the prison city was a pestilential place, a home for criminals from all parts of the empire ... Prevailing winds and tides washed the refuse of the Mediterranean onto its shores, creating a climate so unhealthy that a popular saying held that a bird which flew over Acre would fall dead in the streets ... The first two years of the Baha’is’ imprisonment was a period of intense deprivation and hardship’ (Hatcher and Douglas Martin 2002: 42). Bahá’u’lláh spent these two years strictly confined to the barracks. After the movement of troops required the use of the barracks,6 Bahá’u’lláh and his family were transferred, under house arrest, to a succession of other dwellings in the city. Later, in 1877, he took up residence in a mansion of Mazra‘ih for a period of two years, and was finally allowed to settle in Bahji, near Acre, where he remained until his death on 29 May 1892. It was there that Bahá’u’lláh received Professor E. G. Browne, of the University of Cambridge, one of the few Westerners known to have visited and written about him (see his letters in this book)."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Introduction 3In his will and testament, Bahá’u’lláh named his eldest son ‘Abdu’l-Bahá (1844–1921), as his successor and the authorized interpreter of his teachings. He, in turn, named his eldest grandson, Shoghi Effendi (1897–1957) to succeed him as Guard-ian of the Baha’i Faith. After the passing of Shoghi Effendi, the leadership of the Baha’i community passed to the Universal House of Justice, an institution ordained by Bahá’u’lláh in his Writings. The first election of this administrative body took place in 1963. It consists of nine members who are elected for a period of five years. The seat of the Universal House of Justice is on Mount Carmel, at the Baha’i World Centre in Haifa. All the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh, the Báb and of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá form the Baha’i sacred scripture. The founder of the Baha’i religion left behind a rich spiritual legacy: books, epistles, and tablets, considered by Baha’is to be the revelation of God. The writings and talks of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and the works of Shoghi Effendi are regarded as authoritative interpretation. Bahá’u’lláh’s major Writings include The Most Holy Book (Kitáb-i-Aqdas), The Book of Certitude (Kitáb-i-Íqán) and many others, originally in Arabic and Persian, and now translated into some 800 languages. The Baha’i message is of a global nature. It is not confined to a particular people, national, ethnic, or cultural group, but is addressed to humanity as a whole. This accounts for the fact that, although the new religion originally emerged in a Persian cultural milieu, it has gradually spread across national boundaries and attracted believers around the world from different ethnic backgrounds. In the Baha’i teach-ings, history is seen to be unfolding through a series of divine messengers, referred to as manifestations of God or divine manifestations, each of whom reflects the same divine reality, that is, God’s will, and establishes a religion that is suited to the needs of the time and the capacity of the people in which it appears. These divine manifestations include Abraham, Krishna, the Buddha, Moses, Zoroaster, Jesus, Muhammad, the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh. Thus, religion is seen as a historical progression, corresponding to each stage of humanity’s collective growth, and maturing in a manner similar to the phases in the life and development of an indi-vidual. This notion is defined as ‘progressive revelation.’ Humanity is understood to be in a process of collective evolution and spiritual progress. The current stage is described as that of adolescence, the stage immediately preceding full matu-rity, at which point humanity is challenged to recognize its organic oneness and gradually establish peace, justice, and unity on a global scale. The basic notion of universal harmony is expressed and reflected in all the major principles of the Baha’i Faith: the oneness of God, the fundamental unity of religion, the oneness of humankind, harmony between religion and science, the equality of men and women. Other principles include the independent investigation of truth, the spir-itual foundation of society, universal education, the abandonment of prejudice and superstition, abolition of the extremes of poverty and wealth, and the adoption of an auxiliary international language."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"4 IntroductionThe commandments of God revealed by the succession of divine manifestations are seen as falling into two categories: first, eternal laws, spiritual in nature, which never alter, such as the law requiring man to acknowledge and worship God, essential spiritual principles, such as love, compassion, moderation, respect for parents, etc., and the fundamental laws of unity, harmony, and attraction; and sec-ond, social laws, such as particular ordinances governing marriage, inheritance, education of children, etc. Both aspects are described as being divine in origin and must be obeyed, but succeeding manifestations may change or modify the social laws revealed by previous manifestations.7 The second half of the nineteenth century was characterized by an increasing interest in the Babi and Baha’i Faiths in Europe. Diplomats, Orientalists, and oth-ers were making contributions in every conceivable way to the study of this phe-nomenon: the emergence of a new religion, contradicting the prevalent view that the appearance of new religions was only possible in ancient times because it was thought to be characteristic of early forms of human society.There was considerable interest in the Babi and Baha’i Faiths in Russia and Great Britain, countries whose political positions in Iran were exceptionally strong, and whose diplomats therefore had greater opportunities to collect materials on this subject at the very dawn of the religion’s history. The establishment of the Rus-sian Academic School of Oriental Studies served as a historic background and prelude to research in such fields as the Babi and Baha’i Faiths in tsarist Russia. It is with this school that the academic activity of V. R. Rosen (see p. 7) was directly connected. Therefore it would be relevant to touch upon the origin and history of Middle Eastern and Oriental studies in Russia and highlight their relation to the Western European academic school of research. Oriental studies as a scholarly discipline first originated in Western Europe (pri-marily in colonial empires) in the eighteenth century and have undergone rapid development since the mid nineteenth. Although they were stimulated by foreign policy considerations, the process was not entirely politically motivated. Schol-ars and researchers collected and studied literary monuments to ancient Middle Eastern and Oriental cultures, making them available for Europeans, thus debunk-ing Western Eurocentric concepts and stereotypes, and contributing to the mutual enrichment of civilizations. Oriental studies in Russia followed the same pattern, as they were closely related to, but not entirely determined by, the tsarist interests in the East. The Russian Empire was geographically located too close to Middle and Far Eastern regions, and its interests were too closely intertwined with those areas of the globe for Russia to be able to remain isolated from the processes which were unfolding in the neighboring Asian countries. Russia’s scholarly Oriental studies drew upon three major resources: (a) applied Oriental studies, which considered the country’s needs in military and diplomatic spheres; it also included the missionary activity of the Russian Orthodox Christian"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Introduction 5Church in the East; (b) traditional (primarily religious) scholarly establishments of the Asian peoples under Russian rule; these tended to specialize in the study of the culture and history of different local ethnic groups, both native (within Rus-sia’s borders) and foreign (those inhabiting neighboring countries); (c) Western Oriental studies, which involved inviting Western scholars to Russia for work, as well as publishing studies of Western European researchers in Russian.The history of Russian Oriental studies as an academic discipline goes back to 1720 when Peter the Great issued a decree concerning the establishment of a Col-lege for Foreign Affairs, which included an ‘expedition8 of Turkish and other Asian languages.’ The latter employed experts on Near Eastern languages. Some of them were engaged in the translation of manuscripts. In 1797 ‘a special Depart-ment for arranging affairs related to Asian peoples’ was set up within the College for Foreign affairs. In 1802, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was established by a royal decree, and in 1820, an Asian Committee was formed. It was within this structure that the Educational Department of Oriental Languages which trained staff for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs emerged in 1823.A great many graduates of this department became talented Orientalists and highly qualified professionals. Some devoted their lives to practical work, while others were engaged in academic activities. Applied and academic research in the field of Oriental studies was much in demand in the mid nineteenth century as a result of the colonial campaigns in Central Asia and Southern Caucasus. Russia’s applied Oriental studies are considered to have owed much of their success to E. P. Kovalevski (1811–1868), a prominent diplomat and scholar, who began sending major scholarly-diplomatic expeditions to Asian countries to carry out significant research. The result of their work was very fruitful. N. V. Khanykov headed a scholarly mission to Iran and Afghanistan; N. P. Ignatyev9 led an expedition to Khiva and Bukhara; and N. G. Stoletov headed a diplomatic mission to Bukhara and Afghanistan. Military agencies made their own contribution to the development of Russia’s applied Oriental studies. Military missions and agents provided detailed reports on the political situation, geography, ethnic composition, and religion of neighbor-ing Asian countries. At the end of the seventeenth century, Russian navy officers kept diaries as they sailed to India, China, and South Asia, some of which were later published. An important military-diplomatic mission, headed by general A. P. Ermolov, visited Iran in 1817, resulting in a series of essays (in Russian): The Ways and Troops of the Persians: A Brief Outline of Persia in the Military Aspect, and other works. Considerable influence was left on Iranian and Afghan studies by I. F. Blaramberg, a military Orientalist and army general.The development of applied Oriental studies was matched by those of an academic nature. Russia’s first Orientalist-academician (full member of the Academy of Sciences) was the Königsberg (now Kaliningrad) born German scholar, Gottlieb"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"6 IntroductionSiegfried Bayer (1694–1738), who offered his services to the Russian Academy of Sciences in 1725. His professional interests were quite broad, covering a wide spectrum of Oriental disciplines. However, he devoted his whole life to a work entitled Chinese Museum, published in St Petersburg in Latin in 1730–1731. The first government establishment specializing in Oriental studies within the Acad-emy of Sciences, the Asiatic Museum, came into being in 1818. This marks the beginning of Russian academic Oriental studies proper. Its director and caretaker was Christian Martin Joachim Frähn (1782–1851), a German-Russian numisma-tist, historian, and academician, born at Rostock, Mecklenburg-Schwerin. The Asiatic Museum quickly established itself as the main institute for the collection and study of Oriental manuscripts and books in Russia, as well as a major interna-tional centre for Oriental studies. By the time of the Russian Revolution in 1917, almost a hundred years after its founding, the Asiatic Museum housed one of the most extensive collections of Oriental manuscripts and printed books in the world (see below). Frähn was succeeded after his death by B. A. Dorn (1805–1881), who headed the Asiatic Museum for almost 40 years. This academician was an eminent scholar, professor, broad specialist in the field of Iranian studies, and founder of Afghan studies in Russia, who contributed significantly to the formation and study of St Petersburg collections of Oriental manuscripts, coins, and books, and to the development of Oriental studies in Russia.10 After Dorn, the Asiatic Museum was successively headed by V. R. Rosen (see more about him on p. 7), F. I. Videman, V. V. Radlov, and K. G. Zalemann. Studies in the Near and Middle East were prima-rily, but not entirely, aimed at reaching a better understanding of and addressing the problems of the peoples of the Asian provinces of the Russian Empire which were culturally close to those regions of the world. Particular attention was paid to the study of the Caucasus and Central Asia. Russian diplomats and diplomatic mission staff in nineteenth century Iran were especially active in collecting materials relating to the emerging new religion. Russia’s General Consul in Tabriz, A. M. Bezobrazov; General Consul in Astra-bad, F. A. Bakulin; chief interpreter of the Russian mission in Tehran, I. G. Grig-orovich, and others played a considerable role in the preservation and contribution of Babi and Baha’i manuscripts to the collections in the then capital of the Russian Empire, St Petersburg, and primarily to the collection in the Library of the Insti-tute of Oriental Languages of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, later transferred to the Asiatic Museum. This academic establishment, which was also known as the St Petersburg Branch of the Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences, now bears the name of the St Petersburg Institute of Oriental Manu-scripts of the Russian Academy of Sciences (IOM).Among the European scholars whose contribution to Baha’i and Babi studies, including the publication of original texts, was exceptionally valuable were Rus-sian Orientalists Baron V. R. Rosen, A. G. Tumanski, and British Orientalist E. G. Browne."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Introduction 7A Russian aristocrat of German descent, Baron Victor Romanovich Rosen (1849–1908) was an academic, professor of Arabic at the St Petersburg University, Dean of its Faculty of Oriental Languages,11 Head of the Oriental Branch of the Rus-sian Archeological Society,12 and founder and editor of the Zapiski Vostochnogo Otdeleniya Russkogo Archeologicheskogo Obshestva (ZVORAO) (Memoirs of the Oriental Branch of the Russian Archeological Society).13 Rosen translated several of the Baha’i Writings into Russian including the Glad Tidings by Bahá’u’lláh (Rosen 1893b: 183–192). Born in Reval – present-day Talinn, the capital of Estonia, then a province of the Russian Empire – Rosen chose Oriental studies as his professional field. He soon became an outstanding expert in Arabic and Persian cultures, literature, Islamic, Christian, and finally Baha’i studies, and was one of the pioneers of research in this newly emerging scholarly area in Europe. He rose to a remarkably high posi-tion and was a recognized authority both in Russia and in the West. A full-time member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Rosen was also a corresponding member of several foreign academies and a member of academic societies such as the Royal Prussian Academy of Sciences, the Royal Academy of Sciences in Amsterdam, the Institut de France, and an honorary member of the Royal Asiatic Society in London. One of Rosen’s greatest achievements and contributions to Oriental studies was the establishment of ZVORAO (Memoirs), of which he remained editor for the rest of his life. Rosen died at the age of 58, leaving behind scores of published works, including descriptive catalogues of manuscripts. The first volume of the Memoirs came out in 1886, equaling such long-standing European scholarly journals as the Journal Asiatique, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gezellschaft, Giornale della Società, and Asiatica Italiana. Rosen prepared for publication in the original Arabic and Persian a volume of Epistles by Bahá’u’lláh and left detailed descriptions of many Babi and Baha’i manuscripts which now belong to the manuscript collection of the IOM. The descriptions are extensively illustrated by lengthy extracts from the texts of the manuscripts. Rosen also properly identified some important Epistles, such as the Súriy-i-Mulúk (the Súrih of the Kings) revealed by Bahá’u’lláh. He encouraged his students, A. G. Tumanski and others, to collect and study materials related to the Babi and Baha’i Faiths. E. G. Browne paid tribute to his Russian colleague and pointed out ‘the extreme value of the materials which he has made accessible to scholars, and the exceptional claim which he has on the gratitude of all Oriental-ists’ (Browne 1892b: 322).Alexander Grigoryevich Tumanski (born in 1861), who came from an old Lithua-nian aristocratic family, was Rosen’s student. As a young captain in the Russian Imperial army, while serving in the Turkistan region (Ashkabad: now Ashgabat, capital of Turkmenistan), he came into close contact with the recently established"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"8 IntroductionBaha’i community there. He undertook a trip to Persia arranged by the Baha’is and sanctioned by the Russian authorities to collect information about the Baha’is in Persia. He was accompanied on his trip by his young wife, and his journey to Per-sia at that time was an adventure. Among Tumanski’s good friends was the promi-nent Baha’i scholar Abu’l-Fazl Gulpáygání. Tumanski was the first translator of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas into a European language, namely Russian (Tumanski 1899). Among his other publications of Baha’i Writings in the original, accompanied by his Russian translation, was The Will and Testament of Bahá’u’lláh (Tumanski 1893). According to Professor Akimushkin of St Petersburg, Tumanski fled with his family to Turkey after the so-called Bolshevik October Revolution and died in 1920 in the Princes’ Islands. His descendents live in Belgium.It is interesting to quote Tumanski’s own account of how he first became inter-ested in Baha’is and Baha’i studies:In the summer of 1890, as a student of the officers’ courses under the Edu-cational Department of Oriental Languages, I was required to go to the mili-tary training camp. Driven by the desire to practice my colloquial Persian in summer as well as to get to know the Babis better, I requested to be allowed to go to the military training camp in the Transcaspian Region instead of to Krasnoye Selo;14 the request was granted as a favor to me, provided that I went there at my own expense. Much to my regret, I did not tell anyone of my intention to apply myself to Babi studies before my departure and for this reason I had no opportunity to become acquainted with works by E. G. Browne. Even Baron V. R. Rosen’s works became known to me thanks to I. F. Gotvald, whose cordial welcome in Kazan I remember with much appreciation. The only way in which I can justify myself is that I was not aware of what precisely would greet me in Ashkabad. I had obtained my first informa-tion about the Babis from the Nouvelle Géographie Universelle by [Élisée] Reclus15 at a time when I was still preparing for the entrance examination at the Oriental Languages courses. It was then that I was amazed by this reli-gious struggle which is possible in this age, if not in Europe at least in Asia.In the winter of 1889–90 a telegram was published in the newspaper Novoye Vremya,16 which said that the four Shi‘ih Persians who had been con-demned to death by hanging by the military tribunal in Ashkabad for murder-ing a Babi had their sentence mitigated at the request of the Babis themselves, their death penalty being changed into penal servitude for life. It was then that I decided to go to Ashkabad for the summer and made myself familiar with Prof. Kazembek’s book: The Báb and the Babis S[aint]-P[eters]b[urg] 1865 as my preliminary guide. The reason why I did not tell anyone about my project was that I was not sure whether my trip would provide anything new in this field or not. Furthermore, [I was wondering] what kind of Babis I would find in Ashkabad: whether they were knowledgeable in their own teaching or not, all this was unknown to me. Therefore I kept silence."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Introduction 9Arriving in Ashkabad on 29 June 1890, I was able without difficulty to become acquainted with the most interesting Babis. Due to their meritori-ous lifestyle they [were] accepted by Russians most favorably. Some of the wealthiest Babis are even permanent members of the city public assembly. That is why making their acquaintance was not difficult at all. Seeing my desire to get to know their religious teaching better, three of them were eagerly vying with one another to help me in it ... (Tumanski 1892: 314–315, translation mine) As Baron Rosen remarked in his description of Tumanski’s undertaking: ‘... Mr. Tumanski left [for Turkistan] without having a chance to become aware of Mr. Browne’s memoirs, which he studied on his return. Therefore he is completely independent in his judgments, which makes them all the more precious’ (Collec-tions Scientifiques ... 1891, VI: 243, translation mine). In about two years after his first summer trip to Ashkabad, Tumanski went there again for military service. It appears from his letters that he spent a total of 6–7 years in the Transcaspian Region. The prominent British Orientalist E. G. Browne is too well known both in the West and in the East to need a long introduction here. However, it is relevant to make a few comments regarding his contribution to Babi and Baha’i studies. The numerous works of this scholar, which appeared from the end of the nineteenth to the beginning of the twentieth century, have preserved their value up to the present day.These include translations and commentaries, and the publication of important and interesting documents. I will mention some of them: The Bábís of Persia; A Traveller’s Narrative Written to Illustrate the Episode of the Báb; The Táríkh-i-Jadíd or New History of Mírzá ‘Alí Muhammad the Báb; Materials for the Study of the Bábí Religion; Kitáb-i Nuqtִatu’l-Кáf, being the Earliest History of the Bábís Compiled by ִНájjí Mírzá Jání of Káshán. Browne was most remarkable in his deep penetration into the subtlest nuances of theological and metaphysical subjects and his illuminating explanations of many core concepts of the religious teachings. However, though the British scholar, like his Russian colleagues tried to base his studies on primary sources, he widened the definition of this term to encompass an extremely broad range of sources. Trusting unconditionally the materials coming from circles biased against the Baha’is, he hastily and uncriti-cally borrowed extensive data from them for his works and relied on it in his judg-ments, ignoring obvious contradictions which this data contains.17 This tendency made Browne’s research in the field of Babi studies much more profound and well substantiated than in the field of Baha’i studies, which he regarded as being of secondary importance (see his letters to Rosen in this book). However, the limitations of Browne’s approach were compensated by the works of both Rosen and Tumanski, who focused their endeavors completely on Baha’i studies. For this reason the scholarly activities of Russian Orientalists on the one hand, and those of Browne’s on the other, can be regarded as complementary. This impression is largely confirmed by their correspondence which reveals in what close cooperation the three scholars were working together and with what"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"10 Introductionwillingness they exchanged information and materials and discussed their plans.18 Baron V. R. Rosen’s archive in the Russian Academy of Sciences and this bookBaron V. R. Rosen left to posterity a vast collection of unpublished materials which, among other purposes, are of extreme value for the study of the Babi and Baha’i Faiths, as well as for research on Babi and Baha’i studies in Europe, espe-cially for those interested in a historical perspective. These materials are preserved in the St Petersburg Branch of the Archive of the Russian Academy of Sciences (St Petersburg, Russia). They comprise Rosen’s correspondence with A. G. Tumanski, E. G. Browne (the larger part of the collection), G. D. Batyushkov, academic S. F. Oldenburg, V. I. Ignatyev, S. Voirot, and I. Kheyru’lláh.Of special importance are manuscripts (and copies of manuscripts), official reports of Russian diplomats from Persia on the Babis, and reports from Adri-anople on the Babis residing there at the same time that Bahá’u’lláh was exiled in that city.It would also be relevant to say a few words about the other key figures (besides the three prominent Orientalists), whose work figures in the above-named collection.1. Academic Sergei Feodorovich Oldenbourg, who mentions the Babis in his letter to Rosen.2. Vladimir Ivanovich Ignatyev – another of Rosen’s university students, a dip-lomat working in Tehran, Ashkabad, and Bukhara.193. Georgiy Dmitrievich Batyushkov – Persian and Arabic scholar and diplomat working in Tehran in 1893–1899, and author of a short book on the Babi and Baha’i Faiths (Batyushkov 1897).4. Sébastian Voirot – a French Baha’i.5. Ibráhím George Khayru’lláh (Kheiralla) – the first Baha’i teacher in America.6. Mírzá Abu’l-Fazl Gulpáygání – a prominent Baha’i scholar, a former Mus-lim master teacher in a religious seminary in Tehran, who became a devoted Baha’i.I will now briefly describe the materials in Rosen’s archive collection related to our subject which are presented or introduced to the reader in this book:1. Tumanski’s correspondence with Rosen (in Russian), which date from 1892 to 1899. These comprise over 21 letters and a newspaper article dealing with a wide range of issues: the Babi community in Ashkabad, the translation of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas (and related issues), Tumanki’s trip to Persia and some information he gathered there about the Baha’is, and other subjects. The arti-cle written by Tumanski on the ascension of Bahá’u’lláh was published in the"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Introduction 11newspaper Kavkaz. The author gives in it an unbiased account of the history of the Baha’i Faith and calls Bahá’u’lláh ‘a prophet’;2. Browne’s correspondence with Rosen comprises 49 letters, dated between 1889 and 1902; two letters are in Persian, and the remainder are in English. These letters also cover a wide range of issues and show the close cooperation with Rosen with whom Browne was researching the Babi and Baha’i Faiths. For example, these letters reveal that Browne used for his work both tran-scripts of the Persian Bayán from the St Petersburg manuscript collection, made available to him by Rosen;3. Ignatyev’s correspondence with Rosen comprises three letters (in Russian). These throw light on the stance of Russia’s Foreign Ministry on the Babi/Baha’i issue and reveal the differences between the Foreign Ministry and the Russian authorities in Turkistan in this respect;4. Batyushkov’s correspondence with Rosen consists of three letters (in Rus-sian), revealing Batyushkov’s attraction to the Baha’i Faith and his protective attitude towards it;5. Sébastian Voirot’s letter (in French) throws light on the French Baha’i com-munity of the time;6. Kheyru’lláh, who was put in touch with Rosen by Browne, offers Rosen his book in his letter (in English);7. Official reports of Russian diplomats in Persia on the Babis/Baha’is; one is in French, while the remainder are in Russian, but written in a Russian script spe-cially modified to make its reading difficult. These reports, dated 1868–1890, cover the period 1855–1890. Among them is a report by the Russian Chargé d’Affaires in Tehran, Mr. Zinovyev, to Duke Gorchakov (in French);8. ‘The Babis in Adrianople’ – a report by the head of the Russian Consulate in Adrianople based on eyewitness accounts; the report was compiled in Rus-sian on Rosen’s request;9. Manuscripts: (a) The Lawh-i-Sámsún (in Arabic), also known as the Lawh-i-Hawdaj (Tablet revealed by Bahá’u’lláh in Samsun on his way to Constantino-ple). The manuscript is preserved in excellent condition; (b) The Lawh-i-Javád (three pages in Persian); (c) A chapter from the Qayyúmu’l-Asmá’ (‘Chapter of Josef’) in Arabic;(d) Prayers;(e) ‘History of Hájí Muhammad-Rizá’ – a history in Persian of the mar-tyrdom of Hájí Muhammad-Rizá Isfahání in Ashkabad, manuscript in Abu’l-Fazl Gulpáygání’s hand; All the above manuscripts (except for the Lawh-i-Javád, included in Rosen’s volume of Epistles by Bahá’u’lláh) have not so far been available to the gen-eral public, because they have been preserved in the Archive, which accounts for their excellent condition. They are not described in any published descrip-tive catalogue of manuscripts."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"12 Introduction10. Two letters in Judeo-Persian20 with a translation into standard Persian, giving an account of the events which happened to Babis (Baha’is) of Jewish back-ground in Iran and the persecutions they suffered. One letter is addressed by Áqá Sulaymán-‘Attár Hamadání from Tehran to Áqá Sulaymán-Shálfurúsh Hamadání in Ashkabad;11. A letter written by Abu’l-Fazl Gulpáygání to Tumanski (in Persian) on behalf of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. The letter is probably a transcript of Gulpáygání’s original letter.Two-thirds to three-quarters of these letters (except for a few from Brown and a couple of Tumanski’s letters) are related to the Babi and Baha’i Faiths. Some extracts from the Russian language materials of this collection were previously quoted in Kuznetsova’s article: ‘K Istorii Izuchenia Babizma i Behaizma v Ros-sii (On the history of studies in the Babi and Baha’i Faiths).’ Later the archive documents with quotes in English were briefly presented by me in: Ioannesyan, ‘Baron Rosen’s Archive Collection of Babi and Baha’i Materials.’ The Russian part of these materials – the official reports of Russian diplomats, Tumanski’s and Ignatyev’s letters as well as one of the three of Batyushkov’s letters translated into English, have been recently published in full in the book: The Baha’is of Iran, Transcaspia and the Caucasus, ed. by S. Shahvar, B. Morozov and G. Gilbar. The latter scholarly two-volume work is a significant and valuable contribution to Baha’i and Iranian studies.However, neither the English, Persian, and Arabic language parts of this collec-tion nor the originals of the Russian language section have so far been published or introduced to the reader (except for certain passages quoted by Kuznetsova, see p. 114).The purpose of this book is to bring together in one work all the materials in Russian, English, Persian, Arabic, and French related to the Babi and Baha’i Faiths from Rosen’s archive in the original languages supplied with an English transla-tion (where necessary) and comments. These documents are closely interrelated since they all deal with the same issues and are addressed to the same person, that is, Baron Rosen. The book presents extensive quotes from all the above materials: private correspondence, diplomatic reports, and descriptions of manuscripts con-tained in the archive, accompanied by comments. All passages from the given cor-respondence relating to the Babi and Baha’i Faiths are quoted in the book.21 Since the letters are complementary to the sender’s or Baron Rosen’s published works, throwing sometimes additional light on the issues discussed in these publications, the comments on them are primarily (but not entirely) intended to help the reader understand how a given letter or report relates to a particular published work. The publication of the quotes is authorized by the Archive of the Russian Academy of Sciences as certified by a special agreement. The materials in languages other than English (Russian, Persian, French, Arabic) are presented in their original and in the English translation made by Linda and Youli Ioannesyan.Since these materials contain and touch upon so many varied subjects, it is impossible to classify them according to their content. For this reason, they are"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Introduction 13arranged chronologically and sequentially based on their deposit, inventory and item numbers; sometimes the main subject of the letter or quote is emphasized. The materials in the Archive are registered under the following three numbers: deposit (фонд) inventory (опись) unit (единица хранения).All the quotes are given with a reference to the page. The numeral stands for the folio page number; ‘a’ indicates the folio front page, ‘b’ indicates the folio back page. The transliteration of Persian/Arabic titles and personal names follows in gen-eral the Baha’i transliteration system with the exception of the subscript diacritical marks, which are not used in the work and the Persian izáfih, which is not placed between the components of complex personal names. This system enables the titles of Babi and Baha’i Writings to preserve the set forms (Arabic or Persian) in which each text is commonly known among the followers of the Baha’i Faith. At the same time, it for the most part matches Browne’s transliteration which the British Orientalist employs in his letters published in this book. The terms ‘Babi’ and ‘Baha’i’ (whether in reference to the religion or to its followers) as well as geographic names do not have any diacritical marks. The terms and names influenced by Turkish pronunciation in the original documents (in the reports and letters from Turkey) are not transliterated either. However, all the quotes from English language sources (Browne’s letters and published works) preserve the original transliteration of Persian/Arabic terms and personal/geographic names including the use of subscript dots. The same applies to the punctuation and quota-tion marks (the use of double quotation marks instead of singular). This accounts for an inconsistency in the rendering of certain personal/geographic names and terms: Tumansky/Toumansky, Jawád, Ashkabad/‘Ishkábád, Bâbýs, Bâby/Bábí, Behá’i, Ezelí(s), etc. in Browne’s letters and quotes from his published works, while elsewhere in the book the corresponding forms are: Tumanski, Javád, Ashkabad, Babis, Babi, Baha’i, Azali(s). Throughout the archival correspondences, the Baha’is are referred to as ‘Babis’ as was common practice in the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth centu-ries. I keep this term in the original texts but replace it with ‘Baha’i’ and ‘Baha’is’ where the latter are implied in my comments. All the Common Era (CE) dates in the Russian (or French) language section of the collection follow the Julian calendar.Notes 1 In this book, the initial capital letter in ‘Writings’ is used when referring to the works of Bahá’u’lláh and the Báb (as they are considered to be the Holy Scripture in the Baha’i Faith). In other contexts, the initial capital letter is not used. 2 See Momen, W. 1989: 28. 3 See Cameron and Momen 1996: 55–56."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"14 Introduction 4 In the Súriy-i-Haykal, for example. 5 For more information about him, see Momen W. 1989: 243. 6 See Cameron and Momen 1996: 94. 7 See Momen W. 1989: 137.

Certainly I have applied myself to the realization of my old project, namely, the translation into Russian of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas and other main Lawhs,1 Munájáts, Tarázáts2 as well as of some other delightful works of this kind.

Огнепоклонник Манукчи во время 1-го похода англичан в Кабул слу-жил в английских войсках на должности Тавильдара Низами (кажется интендантская должность). В виду существующих порядков в анг-лийских войсках и пренебрежительного отношения к неангличанам, Манукчи, отчаявшись в военной карьере, вышел в отставку и уехал в Тегеран, где и прожил более 30 лет. Всю свою деятельность Манукчи посвятил облегчению положения своих единоверцев в Персии. Он глав-ным образом обратил внимание на урегулирование جزيه, которую пла-тили гебры и успел выхлопотать у Персидского Правительства право взимать непосредственно самому эту подать. Тот излишек, который до той поры попадал в карманы хакимов, Манукчи обратил в фонд на проценты с которого он устроил известные гебрские школы. Все это конечно не могло быть иначе как с помощью английского правительс-тва, подданным которого был Манукчи. Но в последнее [P. 3/а] время почему / то оставшись недовольным своим правительс-твом, Манукчи изменил тактику и стал действовать не сам, а через русс-кого подданного Таджир баши армян Хаджэ-Ивана. Летом 1890 г., когда я был первый раз в Асхабаде, пришло известие о его смерти. Живя долго в Персии Манукчи был очевидцем многих событий дви-жения бабидов и сам лично относился с симпатией к ним. В бытность свою в Багдаде он виделся с Беха-Уллой, от которого на имя Манукчи есть два Лауха. Один Вам известен – это тот Лаух, который находится в конце «Мудуние» написанный чистым персидским языком. Другой Лаух последовал в благодарность за присылку сочинения Манукчи آيئیهوشنک.

Этот последний и написал книгу فرازستان. [P. 3/b] Историю же ба/бидов он поручил составить бабиду Мирзе Хусейн Гамадани*.

Mánukchí focused all his activities on easing the plight of his coreligionists in Persia. He turned his attention to the matter of the regulation of جزيه,12 which the Guebres13 had to pay and managed to obtain from the Persian gov-ernment the right to directly exact the tax himself.

This could never have been possible without the help of the English government, whose subject [P. 3/a] Mánukchí was. But recently for some reason, / Mánukchí became unhappy with his government, changed his tactic and, started to operate via a Russian citizen – Khájih-Ivan, the Tájir-báshí 15 of the Armenians, instead of working directly with them himself. In the summer of 1890, while I was in Ashkabad for the first time, the news of his death arrived. Living in Persia for many years, Mánukchí witnessed many of the events of the Babi movement and was himself sympathetic to the Babis. During his stay in Baghdad he met Bahá’u’lláh, who wrote two Lawhs, addressed to Mánukchí by name. One is known to you. It is the Lawh, which appears at the end of ‘Muduniyyih’ [sic] and is written in pure Persian.16 The other Lawh was written out of gratitude for [Mánukchí’s] sending his work آيئیهوشنک17 [to Bahá’u’lláh]. I don’t have this Lawh in my possession. In 129718 Mírzá Abu’l-Fazl met Mánukchí in Tehran. At the time Mánukchí had embarked on publishing two historical treatises. One was on the history of the pre-Islamic kings of Persia, a work which he entrusted Ismá’íl Khán Zand to compile. The latter consequently wrote the book: فرازستان.19 As for [P. 3/b] the history of / the Babis – he entrusted Mírzá Husayn Hamadání,* the Babi, with this work. Mánukchí could not write [a history] himself because he did not know the Arabic alphabet, but he wanted to incorporate his own recollections and views into this history. Mírzá Husayn Hamadání sought Mírzá Abu’l-Fazl’s advice and Mírzá Abu’l-Fazl suggested that he should base it on the chronology of the Násikhu’t-Tavárikh and then incorporate Mánukchí’s recollections into this chronological framework. Abu’l-Fazl himself, as I have already pointed out, wrote something like an introduction (عنوان)20 to this history. It would be wrong at this point not to mention the editor of this History, Hájí Siyyid Javád Karbilá’í, to whom Mírzá Husayn Hamadání showed his drafts. This Hájí was one of the most famous Shi‘ih scholars, from the family of Siyyid Mihdí who was known as the greatest scholar and went by the name of بحرعلوم.21 This Hájí, having begun his studies in Karbila at an early ... [word unclear] was one of Shaykh Ahmad Ahsá’í’s disciples. Then for 10–12 years he was under Kázim Rashtí’s instruction and eventually became a Babi. He [P. 4/a] knew the Báb / as a child and recognized his wonderful qualities even before his اظهار.22 It was from him that my friend, Abu’l-Fazl received the light of Babiism. Hájí died in Kerman in 129923 at the age of 100. This is all I can tell you at present about the Táríkh-i-Jadíd ...* Footnote by Tumanski]: Since he died in Rasht in 1299, the time of the compilation of the Táríkh-i-Jadíd should be between 1297 and 1299.

But the emphasis in the article is made on the history of the compilation of the chroni-cle in question.

Suffice it to say that Bahá’u’lláh revealed a Tablet specially addressed to Mánikchí, and another addressed to Mírzá Abu’l-Fazl, in which the Prophet-founder of the Baha’i Faith replied to Mánik-chí’s questions.E. Browne made extensive use of the Risáliy-i-Iskandaríyyih, received from Tumanski, in his introduction to the English translation of the Táríkh-i-Jadíd (Browne 1893: xxv–xli). He wrote:Thanks to Lieutenant Toumansky24 of the Russian Artillery, to whose ener-getic and successful researches amongst the Babis of ‘Ishkábád science owes so much, a full account of the circumstances which gave rise to the composition of the New History, and the manner in which its composition was effected, has been obtained from one of the three persons (the only one still living) concerned therein, to wit. Mírzá Abu’l-Fazl Muhammad ibn Muhammad Rizá of Gulpáy-agán, whose acquaintance M.Toumansky made at ‘Ishkábád. The substance of what M. Toumansky learned from Mírzá Abu’l-Fazl he most kindly communi-cated to me through Baron Rosen, with full permission to make use of it.[ibid., xxxiii–xxxiv] Browne reproduced word by word in English the same account of the history of the compilation of the Táríkh-i-Jadíd which is contained in Tumanski’s article in Russian, without expanding on the part about Mánikchí. Therefore, Tuman-ski’s letter, containing a detailed biography of Mánikchí, based on Abu’l-Fazl Gulpáygání’s account as its source, considerably amplifies his article, as well as Browne’s introduction to the Táríkh-i-Jadíd.Násikhu’t-Tavárikh – a well-known history of Iran during the Kajar dynasty con-sisting of about 15 volumes.

See Browne’s letter # 25.Matvey29 Avelyevich Gamazoff (1812–1893) was an Orientalist, Head of the Edu-cational Department of Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It was in his memory that Tumanski dedicated his translation of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas. The manuscript sent to Gamazoff is currently in the collection of the IOM. It con-sists of 100 folios and is registered in the Concise Persian MS Catalogue under the sequential number 4186 (code: B 1147).30 The front page has a dedication note from A. G. Tumanski: ‘This Babi manuscript “Tarikh-i-Seyyah [sic]” was sent from Astrabad in 1892 as a gift to the Educational Department by lieutenant Alexander Grigoryevich Tumanski, a graduate of the Oriental languages courses at the Officers’ courses of the Department in 1891’ (translation mine).31 Zaynu’l-Muqarrabín, Bahá’u’lláh’s calligrapher, was one of the 19 outstanding early Baha’is known in the history of the Baha’i Faith as ‘Apostles of Bahá’u’lláh.’As for the original manuscripts of Bahá’u’lláh and the Báb mentioned in the letter, their whereabouts are not known.32It is remarkable that the often-mentioned drawing of the Báb by the painter brought by the Russian Consul in Tabriz is discussed in a letter written when Bahá’u’lláh was still alive. Since this issue did not come up in Tumanski’s other letters to Rosen, it would be safe to assume that Rosen did not know the answer to this ques-tion.

He specifies who exactly broke him the news of the passing of Bahá’u’lláh and spoke the words in Persian quoted in the letter (ibid., 193). It was Mírzá ‘Abdu’l-Karím Ardabílí, known under the Russianized name of Asadov. The latter is described by Tumanski in his other publication: ‘Dva Poslednikh Babidskikh Otkroveniya’ (‘Two Recent Babi Revela-tions’) as one of the three Babis (Baha’is) of Ashkabad who played an exceptionally great role in trying to make Tumanski familiar with the teachings of their religion. Moreover, Mírzá ‘Abdu’l-Karím almost daily spent time reading and explaining the Kitáb-i-Aqdas to him (Tumanski 1892: 315). This outstanding Baha’i was also the addressee of one of Bahá’u’lláh’s two epistles to the Babis (Baha’is) of Ashkabad published by Tumanski as the Two Recent Babi Revelations (ibid., 317–320).Jání’s History or the History of Mírzá Jání is an account of the Babi movement attributed to Hájí Mírzá Jání Káshání, a prominent Babi killed in 1852. Browne, who published a critical edition of this book based on two manuscripts from the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris, appraised it as one of the earliest histories of the Babi movement, a fact which he emphasized in the title (Browne 1910). More-over, Browne, regarding this work as ‘the primary historic source’, considered it a criterion by which the authenticity and truth of other historic sources should be measured. However, subsequent studies revealed considerable inconsistencies and disparities in the text published by Browne, including differing dates of its compo-sition clearly indicated in the work and references to certain events which could not have occurred during Mírzá Jání’s lifetime.40 This led researchers to the conclusion that the historical part was apparently written by several authors on the basis of an earlier history by Mírzá Jání, to which a theological treatise was appended. Though the issue is still disputed by scholars, it is evident from data contained in the text that some portions of the work were later interpolations. At any rate, the book in Browne’s published version appears to have gone through redactions.41It is also worth noting that despite Tumanski’s doubts in the possibility of finding Jání’s History he did find it, of which he informed Rosen later (see his letter # 15).For the Lawh-i-Sámsún or the Lawh-i-Hawdaj by Bahá’u’lláh, see letter # 4.Tumanski devoted an article to the ascension of Bahá’u’lláh in which he tried to give an accurate account of the history of the Babi and Baha’i Faiths. 3.Deposit: 777/inventory: 2/unit: 460[Article by Tumanski in the newspaper Kavkaz, No 180, dated 9 July 1892]Асхабад, 25-го июня/Корр. «Кавказ»На днях получено известие о кончине главы бабидов и их пророка Бэха-Уллы, последовавшей в Акке (С.

Это замечательная личность, которая сумела привлечь около миллиона последователей в разных частях Персии, придала бабизму тот миролюбивый характер, которым в настоящее время отличаются адепты этой религии. Из гордого перса-шиита, признающего дружбу только со своими единоверцами и полное отчуждение от иноверцев (теберра ве тевелла) учение это сделало человека смиренного, считающего всех людей братьями, бабида. Бэха-Улла, настоящее имя которого Мирза-Хусейн-Нури, родился 1-го ноября 1817 года. Он был сыном Мирзы-Бузурк-Нури, бывшего визиря Фегих-Али-шаха.42 Молодость свою он провел в доме отца, где вращаясь постоянно в среде интеллигентных и образованных людей, он отличался очень рано умственным развитием и прекрасным нравствен-ным направлением. Когда началось движение бабидов*) Мирза-Хусейн-Али является одним из ревностных приверженцев Баба и проповедником его доктрины в Мазандеране, где и оставался до смерти Махоммед-Шаха. После этого он вернулся в Тегеран, где при посредстве Муллы-Абдуль-Керима Каз-вини вошел в сношения с Бабом. В 1852 году, после покушения на жизнь Шаха-Наср-Эддина, Бэха-Улла должен был удалиться из Персии. По некоторым известиям, он был, в числе заподозренных в этом покушении, арестован, но благодаря вмешательству русского посла был освобожден. Историк бабидов Сейях об этом не упоминает,**), но за то сам Бэха-Улла в одном из своих пос-ланий вспоминает с благодарностью помощь, оказанную ему русским посланником***). Удалившись из Персии Бэха-Улла избрал себе местожительством Багдад. Прожив в полном уединении и отрешившись от всех дел около года в Багдаде, Бэха-Улла один без спутников отправился в горы турец-кого Курдистана, изредка заезжая в Сулеймоние [sic]. Но по настоя-нию бабидов, которые после казни Баба 1848 и разгромов в Хорасане, Мазандеране и Зенджане остались без руководителей, он опять вер-нулся в Багдад, пробыв два года в горах. Возвратившись в Багдад он посвятил себя, по словам упомянутого историка Сейяха****), «делу воспитания, побуждению к улучшению нравов, к приобретению позна-ний, усвоению искусств всех стран, к хорошему обхождению со всеми народами мира и доброжелательству ко всем национальностям, к общи-тельности, единению, повиновению, скромности, к воспитанию детей, к производству того, в чем нуждается человеческий род, и основанию истинного счастья людей». Деятельность Бэха-Уллы здесь выразилась в неустанной переписке и рассылке увещаний и советов. К этому-же периоду относится и появление его первой книги, еще не претендующей на божественное происхождение, а именно Китабе Иган. К концу пребывания своего в Багдаде, т.е. перед тем, как его, по проискам персидского генерального консула Мирзы-Бузурк-Хана, вытребовали в Константинополь, Бэха-Улла объявил себя тем лицом,"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"28 Part Iпоявление которого предсказывал Баб, и которому Баб считал себя пред-течей. Действительно Баб неоднократно в своих писаниях говорил, что после него явится «тот, на которого Бог укажет» (Манн-юзхиругуллаху). Вот это то предсказание Бэха-Улла и принял на себя, и с этого момента бабизм вошел в совершенно новую фазу своего существования, претер-пев во многом весьма существенные изменения. Весь новый религиоз-ный строй заключается в массе отдельных посланий Бэха-Улла, адре-сованных различным лицам и по разным случаям и носящим большею частью название Лаух’ов (скрижалей); главные же основы заключаются в так называемой Китабе-Акдес43 (священнейшая книга), перевод кото-рой на русский язык подготовляется к печати. В Константинополе Бэха-Улла и его спутники оставались не долее шести месяцев и по распоряжению турецкого правительства были посе-лены в Адрианополе. После пятилетнего пребывания в этом городе в среде бабидов произошли раздоры и они разделились на две партии: одни признавали Бэха-Улла за того, за кого он себя выдавал, другие-же сгруппировались около брата Бэха-Уллы Субхе-Эзеля (настоящее имя его Мирза Яхья). В виду этого турецкое правительство сочло необхо-димым разделить их: одних сослали на остров Кипр, других-же с Бэха-Уллой в Акку, где он и прожил до смерти. В настоящее время главой бабидов, согласно неоднократным указаниям Бэха Уллы и его послед-него завещания, признан старший сын его Мирза Аббас (Аббас Эфенди) под титулом Гусне ’Аазем (величайшая ветвь).А.

Bahá’u’lláh, whose original name was Mírzá Husayn Núrí, was born on 1 November 1817. He was a son of Mírzá Buzurg Núrí, the former minister45 of Fath-‘Alí Sháh. He spent his youth in his father’s house, where constantly surrounded by cultured and educated people he displayed at quite an early age great mental capacity and a wonderful moral mindset. When the Babi movement started *) Mírzá Husayn ‘Alí was one of the Báb’s most ardent adherents and preacher of his doctrine in Mazindaran, where he stayed until Muhammad Sháh’s death. After that he returned to Tehran, where he communicated with the Báb through Mullá Abdu’l-Karím of Qazvin. In 1852, after the attempt on Násiri’d-Dín Sháh’s life, Bahá’u’lláh had to depart from Persia. According to some information, he was among those sus-pected of that attempt, was arrested, but owing to the Russian ambassador’s intervention, was released. The Babi historian, Sayyáh, doesn’t mention this episode **), but Bahá’u’lláh himself recalls the help, rendered to him by the Russian envoy, with gratitude in one of his epistles ***). Having departed from Persia, Bahá’u’lláh chose Baghdad as his residence. After living approximately a year near Baghdad in complete seclusion and following the suspension of all activities, Bahá’u’lláh alone, without any companions, made his way to the mountains of Turkish Kurdistan, at times paying visits to Sulaymaniyyih. But at the persistent request of the Babis, who after the Báb’s execution in 184846 and their defeats in Khorasan, Maz-indaran, and Zinjan were left without leaders, Bahá’u’lláh returned to Bagh-dad having stayed for two years in the mountains. After coming back to Bagh-dad he, according to the above-mentioned historian Sayyáh ****), applied himself fully to ‘educating [his people] and inciting [them] to morality, the acquisition of the sciences and arts of all countries, kindly dealing with all the nations of the earth, desire for the welfare of all peoples, sociability, con-cord, obedience, submissiveness, instruction of [their] children, production of what is needful for the human race, and inauguration of true happiness for mankind.’ Bahá’u’lláh’s activity in this respect manifested itself in ongoing correspondences and the issuing forth of admonitions and counsels. His first book, namely the Kitáb-i-Íqán, with no claim to a divine origin yet, goes back to that period. By the end of his residence in Baghdad, that is before he was, due to the intrigues of the Persian general consul Mírzá Buzurg Khán, deported to Con-stantinople, Bahá’u’lláh declared himself to be the person, whose manifesta-tion had been foretold by the Báb and whose precursor the Báb had consid-ered himself to be. Indeed the Báb had repeatedly said in his Writings, that the ‘one whom God will make manifest’ (Man-yuzhiruhu’lláhu) will appear after him. This is the prophecy which Bahá’u’lláh applied to himself [as being fulfilled by him], and since that moment Babiism has entered an entirely new stage of its existence, having undergone quite considerable changes in many"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"30 Part Iaspects. The whole new religious system is contained in a great number of separate epistles by Bahá’u’lláh addressed to different individuals on differ-ent occasions, which for the most part bear the name of the Lawhs (Tablets); the basic principles are contained in the so-called Kitáb-i-Aqdas (The Most Holy Book), of which a translation into Russian is now being prepared for print. Bahá’u’lláh and his companions stayed in Constantinople for no longer than six months and by the orders of the Turkish government they were [then re]located in Adrianople. After a five-month stay in that city there appeared among the Babis discord and they were divided into two parties: one [consisted of those who] recognized Bahá’u’lláh to be the one he claimed to be, while others grouped around Bahá’u’lláh’s brother, Subh-i-Azal (his real name is Mírzá Yahyá). For this reason the Turkish government considered it neces-sary to divide them: one group were banished to the island of Cyprus, others were [banished] with Bahá’u’lláh to Akka, where he lived until his death. His oldest son Mírzá ‘Abbás (‘Abbás Effendi) who is titled Ghusn-i-A‘zam (The Most Great Branch), is, according to Bahá’u’lláh’s repeated instructions and his last Will, recognized at present to be the Head of the Babis.

Not only does this author of the first European book on the history of the Babi Faith fix the wrong year for this event but he even questions Moshnin’s correct date when he quotes Moshnin in his book (Kazimbeg 1865: 33).

The word ‘Hawdaj’ is translated as a ‘seat for riding a camel.’The phrase from the Tablet quoted in Arabic, which literally means: ‘they will be seized with “grievous and tormenting Mischief,”’ is not considered in the Baha’i writings to be an allusion to the Russo-Turkish war. In God Passes By, Shoghi Effendi gives it the following interpretation: ‘Sighting from His howdah the Black Sea, as He approached the port of Sámsún, Bahá’u’lláh, at the request of Mírzá Áqá Ján, revealed a Tablet, designated Lawh-i-Hawdaj (Tablet of the Howdah), which by such allusions as the “Divine Touchstone”, “the grievous and torment-ing Mischief”, reaffirmed and supplemented the dire predictions recorded in the recently revealed Tablet of the Holy Mariner’ (Effendi 1995: 157).

N. Curzon addresses this issue in his book:Quite recently the Babis have had great success ... having secured many pros-elytes among the Jewish populations of the Persian towns. I hear that during the past year they are reported to have made 150 Jewish converts in Teheran, 100 in Hamadan, 50 in Kashan, and 75 per cent of the Jews at Gulpaigan (Curzon 1892, 1: 500).The two letters enclosed by Tumanski are in Judeo-Persian with a translation into regular Persian. The term ‘Judeo-Persian’ is applied by linguists to the peculiar Persian dialect of Iranian Jews, which uses Hebrew characters (but not the lan-guage) in writing. The letters in the original Judeo-Persian are on pages 7/а – 7/b; 8/а, b – 9/а of the same unit.

There is also a postscript in Russian saying: ‘The letter of Áqá Mihdí Zargar, a Jewish Babi, to Áqá Sulaymán-Shálfurúsh.’ Because of the con-fusing way in which both these indications are made, it is difficult to judge which of them refers to which letter.Rabí‘u’l-Avval is the third month of the Muslim lunar year. Rabí‘u’l-Avval 1310 corresponds to September 1892.The second (longer letter) is supplied with interpolated comments in Russian.

I suggest that this verse may serve as an introduction to one of the Lawhs, which I also intend to translate. This Lawh is addressed to the above-mentioned Fázil and concerns different philosophical issues; mainly it reveals the Babi attitude towards the Mullá Sadrá and Mullá Hádí Sabzivárí ()اشراقی( )68 philosophi-cal school. When everything is ready I will send you [these] for [the pub-lication in] the Zapiski. I have received news about the رساله69 concerning Bahá’u’lláh’s biography, that it is finished and has been sent to me. I will surely try to give a detailed report on it ... Comments:In The Will and Testament of Bahá’u’lláh, published by Tumanski under the title: Kitáb-i-‘Ahdí (The Book of My Covenant) [Tumanski, Posledneye Slovo Bahaulli (Bahá’u’lláh’s Last Word)] Tumanski describes Fázil (Nabíl-i-Akbar), the news of whose death, according to Tumanski, was received by the Baha’is of Ashkabad on the same day as the news of the ascension of Bahá’u’lláh, as ‘one of the most promi-nent Babi figures, who was an associate of the Báb himself’ (Tumanski 1893: 193–194). However, the information contained in the last clause of the quote is incorrect: Nabíl-i-Akbar was not an associate of the Báb. (See also Tumanski’s letter # 6).The mentioned Tablet (Lawh) was published by Tumanski in the original Persian and his Russian translation among the Supplements to the Kitáb-i-Aqdas (Supple-ment II) under the title: لوحبسيطالحقيقة (The Tablet of the Uncompounded Real-ity).70 Supplement II starts with an introduction which includes a brief description of Tumanski’s manuscript of the biography of Fázil (Nabíl-i-Akbar) written by Nabíl-i-A‘zam (Mullá Muhammad Zarandí, prominent Babi and Baha’i, author of the narrative of Babi and the earliest days of Baha’i history, The Dawn-Breakers). Therefore it would be reasonable to suppose that what is implied in the letter by the ‘chronological historical verse by Nabíl for someone named Fázil’ is in fact the above biography (see also Tumanski’s letter # 6 and comments).Mullá Sadrá or Hájí Mírzá Husayn Shírází (1572–1640) was an Iranian theolo-gian, philosopher, and mystic. He was a Shi‘ih ideologist in Safavid Iran.Mullá Hádí Sabzivárí, also known under the nickname of Asrár (1797–1872) was a famous Iranian scholar and philosopher of his time.Ishráq is the name of the philosophical school founded by Shaykh Shihábu’d-Dín Suhravardí."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Tumanski’s correspondence with Rosen 375.Deposit: 777/inventory: 2/unit: 458[from a letter dated 24 October 1892, sent from Ashkabad] [P. 13/b] ...

This might be an allusion to the cir-cumstances referred to by Mírzá Abu’l-Fazl in his letter to Tumanski, whose copy Tumanski enclosed with his own letter to Rosen.

Having intended to originate a new religion of so eclec-tic a nature as neoBabiism, Bahá’u’lláh, I believe, could not withhold from the slightest tint of proselytizing. Moreover, the Lawh itself bears the name of لوحنداء, i.e. the Tablet of ‘the Call’ as well as another title with an allusion to Christian terminology: بشارت.74 No real news about Babiism except for the [recently] received brief report concerning the murder of four [P. 15/a] people in / Yazd.

For this I beg your pardon and, please, don’t be too hard on me ...Comments:The same idea of admiration for the abundance of Writings revealed by Bahá’u’lláh is expressed by Tumanski in less metaphorical terms in the closing part of the Introduction to the Kitáb-i-Aqdas: ‘Apart from the lawhs known to us there will probably be found many more new ones, for Bahá’u’lláh’s prolificacy in this respect is amazing.’83 The publications of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas and of a few Lawhs mentioned in the let-ter, as is clear from the term ‘publications,’ imply lithographical editions and not manuscripts. The first might refer to the lithograph of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas used by Tumanski together with his manuscript of this Book for translation. Let us quote an extract from his Introduction to the translation of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas: Finally, the third volume, which included the ‘Most Holy Book’ – the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, which I present now to the reader, was lithographed in 1892 (AH 1308) in Bombay, and I received the first copies of it in the beginning of 1893. This was during the time when I was finishing the translation of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas from the manuscript, obtained by me in 1890, consequently, I felt the need to collate its text with the canonical edition of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas. The present edition is based on the latter [canonical] edition, while the differences"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"44 Part Ibetween this version and my manuscript are marked: my manuscript version is designated by the letter P. (Tumanski 1899: xxvii–xxviii, translation mine)This lithographical edition comprises the Kitáb-i-Aqdas and some Tablets. It is described by Tumanski in the quoted Introduction (ibid., xxviii–xxxvi). Unfortu-nately, it is not known what happened to that lithograph later. As for the edition of the Lawhs by Bahá’u’lláh which Tumanski sent to Rosen with the letter, the only lithographic edition of Bahá’u’lláh’s Tablets in the collection of the IOM as well as of the St Petersburg State University which matches the description in the letter is a lithographical volume comprising: The Tablet of Effulgences (Lawh-i-Tajallíyát), The Tablet of Splendours (Lawh-i-Ishráqát), The Tablet of Ornaments (Lawh-i-Tarázát), The Tablet of the Words of Paradise (Lawh-i-Kalimát-i-Firdaw-síyyih), registered in the Catalogue as: Alváh, code: Ps II 163.84 But whether this is the same lithographical edition which Tumanski mentions in his letter with respect to the Lawhs he was sending to Rosen is still a question.The chronicle written by ‘someone named Mírzá ‘Alí Asghar’ has not been found in Baron Rosen’s archive.

In the latter article he elaborates on the circumstances of this find, which provides a clue for a better understanding of the letter:Our discussions [with Mírzá Abu’l-Fazl] often switched to historic subjects too and I was listening to the inspiring improvisations of the Persian scholar with real enjoyment. But however brilliant and knowledgeable my unforget-table companion might be, the one who shared in the translation of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, I still managed to tell him something new, to wit, I introduced him to an Arab geographer ... During these discussions I was trying to persuade Mírzá [Abu’l-Fazl] to look for old manuscripts ... These discussions took place in the spring of 1892, and in the fall that fol-lowed a summer which is going to be remembered by the people of Ashkabad for cholera I was happy to find out that my Mírzá was alive and well and resided in Samarkand. Shortly afterwards I received a letter from him ... (ibid., 121, translation mine)Tumanski quotes a passage from Mírzá Abu’l-Fazl’s letter in the original Persian and translation, which is directly related to the subject addressed in his corre-spondence with Rosen:During my stay in Bukhara ... I came upon a very good copy of an old book comprising four treatises. The first treatise is on geography, and it served as introduction to a map. The second treatise is also on geography. It was com-piled 943 years ago and was handwritten 808 years ago. It mentions the names of cities totally unknown now. The third treatise is on music, and it is very short. The fourth treatise is a book by Imám Fakhr Rází – Jámi‘u’l-‘Ulúm.(ibid., 122) Tumanski continues with the story in the article:Later I surely conveyed the news of this find to Baron V. R. Rosen, who never left me without his guidance during the whole period of my stay in the East. I avail myself of this most suitable opportunity to express my sincere gratitude to him. In 1893 I brought the manuscript to St Petersburg and because of my upcoming business trip to Persia entrusted it to the care of that scholar.(ibid., 123)By ‘conveying the news of this find to Rosen’, Tumanski apparently refers to this letter from Rosen’s archive. As for the so-called ‘new script’ (خطبديع) also mentioned in this letter, Tuman-ski addresses it in his article ‘Dva Poslednikh Babidskikh Otkroveniya’ (Tumanski 1892: 316) and in the Introduction to his translation of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas (Tuman-ski 1899: xxviii).

It is one of those relatively late Writings of the founder of the Baha’i Faith which came into existence after the Kitáb-i-Aqdas.Supplement I to the Kitáb-i-Aqdas (Tumanski 1899: 49–52) is devoted by Tumanski to Bahá’u’lláh’s Tablet of Karím Khán , who is described by Tumanski as ‘the sworn enemy of the Babis and Bahá’u’lláh’s fol-lowers, the former Head of one of the Shaykhí factions.’ Tumanski quotes the beginning and end parts of the Tablet as well as a longer passage from Shaykh Ahmad, cited by Bahá’u’lláh, which contains a prediction about the Mahdí. He bases these quotes on the two manuscripts of the Tablet of Karím Khán in his possession and makes an attempt to present his tentative Russian translation of this difficult passage from Arabic, making reference to verse 157 in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas (corresponding to verse 378 in Tumanski’s publication of the Most Holy Book).By ‘a Tablet about the Sufis’ the Tablet of ‘Alí must be implied, addressed by Bahá’u’lláh to Hájí Mullá ‘Alí Akbar Shahmírzádí. The manuscript containing this Tablet and the mentioned Tablet of the Uncompounded Reality was received by Tumanski in the May of 1893 from Jadíd ‘Azízu’lláh.102 Tumanski published both these Tablets (as illustrating Bahá’u’lláh’s attitude towards the Sufis and the philosophy of Mullá Sadrá) in the Persian original and in his Russian transla-(لدح كريم خاش)"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Tumanski’s correspondence with Rosen 53tion in Supplement II to his publication of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas (Tumanski 1899: 53–71).

This might well be a reference to the above letter.Unfortunately I don’t possess any information that would cast light on the cur-rent whereabouts of the mentioned manuscript of (Mírzá) Jání’s History. All one may be certain about is that neither this manuscript nor the rest of Tumanski’s private collection of Babi and Baha’i writings have become part of any academic collection in Russia. He gives a description of this manuscript in a long footnote to the Introduction to the Kitáb-i-Aqdas (Tumanski 1899: v–vi). From this descrip-tion one finds out that the manuscript was written in 1291 of Hijrih (corresponds to AD 1874) and was obtained by Tumanski in the April of 1894 in Tehran. Interest-ingly enough, despite Tumanski’s concern that ‘the Babis quite reluctantly give away old documents’ (see his letter # 2), he succeeded in obtaining it through a Baha’i – Mírzá Abu’l-Fazl Gulpáygání, whom he describes as ‘his old friend from Ashkabad’ and for whom he expresses his sincere appreciation. Tuman-ski also quotes in his Introduction a passage from this manuscript in the original Persian and in his Russian translation, surprisingly omitted or suppressed in E. G. Browne’s manuscript of the same History, which contains an account of how Bahá’u’lláh took upon himself the flogging intended for his half-brother Mírzá Yahyá when they were both arrested in Amul (Tumanski 1899: viii–ix).106 As his journey was drawing to a close, Tumanski wrote:16.Deposit: 777/inventory: 2/unit: 460[from a letter dated 28 October 1894]107[P. 11/а] ...

Сличение конечно разрешит этот вопрос. Но я все таки рад этой находке главного и основ-ного исторического памятника бабидского движения. Я Вам писал, что в начале моей рукописи недостает несколько листов. Будучи в Кашане я через одного из членов семьи Джани узнал, что имеется еще один полный экземпляр в окрестностях Кашана и мне обещана копия недо-стающих листов. Посмотрим сдержут ли обещание. Но повидимому [P. 12/b] / недостающие листы ничего не отнимают от исторической части рукописи и составляют часть введения استدلاليه, которое продолжается на первых имеющихся у меня листах. Кроме этого я раздобыл два исто-рических стихотворения: одно из ранних творений Небиля, другое при-писываемое персидской принцессе [sic] под تخلّص’ом فتنه и характерное тем, что рисует утрату авторитета Субхе Эзеля среди секты.

[Their] collation would certainly resolve this issue. However, I am still glad to have found this main and major historic monument of the Babi movement. As I wrote to you earlier, several pages from the beginning of my manuscript are miss-ing.

Затем их много в окрестностях Исфагани, а именно в Неджеф Абаде, в Сидех, в Абадех. В Фарсе они группируются в Зергане, в Сервистане и в Нейризе. В юго-восточном Фарсе их совсем нет, равно как и в Бендер Аббасе. Полное отсутствие их замечено мной и в Буруджирде.

The figure given by Curzon and quoted by Browne is to the best of my knowledge exag-gerated. However, this by no means detracts from their importance. Currently there is an especially large number of Babis in Tehran, among whom you can find very high-ranking and influential people. Moreover, Babiism also serves as a banner around which elements unhappy with the existing regime group together. Among these there are some very influential khans and chiefs of nomadic tribes. I personally met two highly influential Baktiyari khans and an Arab shaykh from Fars (بنوشيبان).116 However, I will tell you all about it in more detail later. Moreover, I have, for the description of Babis proper, two interesting documents. One is the Ghusn-i-A‘zam’s [P. 17/b] circular mes-sage / of a polemic nature*), while the other is secret instructions to a Babi concerning the safety measures required to undertake a trip to Akka, which I found in our Mission archive ...[P. 18/b] Have you finished your Volume of the Lawhs and is there any news from Cambridge? [Footnote by Tumanski]:*) It is titled[:]رسالهسياسيه [Risáliy-i-Siyásiyyih].Comments:‘The figure given by Curzon’ and disputed by Tumanski may refer to the statis-tical data in Persia and the Persian question by George N. Curzon, who in the chapter ‘Institutions and reforms’ of this book fixed the total number of Baha’is in Iran at 1 million: ‘The lowest estimate places the present number of Babis in Persia at half a million. I am disposed to think, from conversations with persons well qualified to judge, that the total is nearer one million’ (Curzon 1892, 1: 499). However, some Russian officials were rather inclined to accept it as a realistic estimate (see Ignatyev’s letter # 2).‘The Volume of Lawhs’ implies the First Volume of Epistles of Beha’u’llah, the Babi [in the original Arabic and Persian], which Baron Rosen was preparing for publication at the time. Tumanski’s letters dated after 1895 were sent from Dudergoff/Krasnoye Selo (two small towns very close to one another situated near St Petersburg) and from"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"64 Part ISt Petersburg. This must serve as an indication that by that time the Ashkabad period in his military career was over and he moved to the capital. That period, as far as Tumanski’s correspondence with Rosen goes, was from the beginning of 1892 through 1895 inclusive.117Below are letters related to the new period in Tumanski’s life. One of them just consists of an article in the Al-Ahram newspaper in Arabic, published in Egypt, which Tumanski sent to Baron Rosen. Another letter (# 22) contains Tumanski’s address in St Petersburg downtown, which indicates that he also stayed in the city itself at least for a while. These letters speak for themselves and I will make but a few brief comments on them:The street where Tumanski stayed in St Petersburg (‘Nijegorodskaya Street’) now bears the name of the ‘Lebedev Street,’ while the town of Dudergoff is currently named ‘Modzayskoye.’ By the ‘Persian questions’ Bahá’u’lláh’s Tablet of the Seven Questions (Lawh-i-Haft Pursish)118 is most likely implied, while ‘the texts of the کلمات’ (lit.: words) must be a reference to His Words of Paradise. Both of these Writings as well as the Tablet of Splendours (Lawh-i-Ishráqát), the Tablet of Orna-ments (Lawh-i-Tarázát), and the Tablet of Effulgences (Lawh-i-Tajallíyát) were published by Tumanski in Supplement III to the Kitáb-i-Aqdas (Tumanski 1899: 72–124). In the short foreword to the given Supplement, Tumanski explained that the mentioned Writings were borrowed by him from the manuscript he received in the December of 1891 from Bahá’u’lláh’s son-in-law – Hájí Siyyid ‘Alí Afnán, who was in Ashkabad at the time, and that given this fact the manuscript could be considered ‘canonical.’ In the brief description of the manuscript, he pointed out that most of the Tablets contained in this manuscript were delivered to E. G. Browne by Bahá’u’lláh’s son – Mírzá Badí‘u’lláh in the October of 1890 and were described by the British Orientalist in the ‘Catalogue and Description of the 27 Babi Manuscripts’ (Browne 1892a: 666–671). Tumanski also observed certain differences between his manuscript and Browne’s, namely in the arrangement of the Tablets and in the fact that his manuscript comprised certain Lawhs which were lacking in Browne’s.Karl Germanovich, mentioned in letter # 22, is most likely a reference to Karl Germanovich Zalemann (1849–1916), who was a Russian philologist specializing in Iranian studies and member of the Russian Academy of Sciences (since 1895), director of the Asiatic Museum (see also Introduction).19.Deposit: 777/inventory: 2/unit: 460[from a letter dated 10 June 1896, sent from Krasnoye Selo] [P. 22/а-b] ...

One of them is the illustrious scholar Baron Rosen, who is among the senior celebrated doctors in the edu-cational establishments of [St]Petersburg. He sent one of his students, Cap-tain Tumanski, to the city of Ashkabad and then to Iran. So, he lived with Babis over three years and got to know all their commandments and customs.

Whatever this year may indi-cate, it obviously cannot be considered a correct reference to the time when the Tablet of Sultán was delivered to Násiri’d-Dín Sháh of Iran, an account of which is contained in the following passage. The given Tablet, revealed by Bahá’u’lláh in Adrianople, was sent to the Shah of Persia from Akka, to which city the Prophet-founder of the Baha’i Faith was moved by the Ottoman government in 1868.Let us go back now to the text of the report. [P. 6/b] Un homme du peuple s’était à plus d’une reprise présenté au camp / Royal et avait témoigné le désir de parler au souverain de la Perse.

He breathed his last without wishing to say anything else.It is easy to imagine what a painful impression this revelation made on the Shah’s naturally nervous and suspicious spirit. The order was immediately given to carry out careful searches both in the camp and in the capital and to arrest all suspects. When these arrests were made, it was a matter of course that some Babis were caught; but the latter refused to name their leaders and stayed calm in the face of death.Comments:The above passage gives the account by a Russian diplomat of what may be described as one of the most heroic episodes in the history of the Baha’i Faith, namely of how Badí‘, a 17-year-old follower of Bahá’u’lláh, who volunteered to deliver Bahá’u’lláh’s message to the Shah of Persia, fully aware of the fatal con-sequences of such an action, were he able to carry out his mission. It is clear from the above report that the diplomat (diplomats) who compiled it had a vague idea of what was contained in Bahá’u’lláh’s message to the Shah. Another account of this event was published by E. G. Browne (Browne 1889b: 956–95) and was quoted by Baron Rosen (in English) in his description of the Tablet of Sultán in the Collections Scientifi ques (Collections Scientifi ques ... 1891, VI: 192–193). Rosen, while presenting to the reader the full original text of the Tablet, made some interesting remarks. He paid attention to the instructions given by Bahá’u’lláh to Badí‘ to approach the Shah or even his servants ‘with full humil-ity and politeness (الاداب و الخضوع بکمال)’ and to simply make it known that the message was on behalf of the ‘prisoner’. In this work Rosen also made the follow-ing observations: Meanwhile I would dare ... express some doubts concerning certain details of the account obtained by Mr. Browne. It is much more probable that the envoy executed his master’s orders precisely. He came forward humbly and politely to the royal camp requesting to be admitted into the presence of His Majesty"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"Russian diplomats’ reports and private letters 73the King of Persia. He had already been refused several times, when all he had declared was that he was a Babi and had certain revelations to make ... once he found himself in the Shah’s presence, he told him only that he was the envoy of ‘the prisoner’; that is all; he endured the consequences of his action with a smile on his face (ibid., 194; here and below, translation from French is mine).Rosen concluded the publication of the Tablet of Sultán and the brief analysis of its content with the following observation:The attentive reader will easily notice that the message ... is full of respect to the monarch. The goal of its author is evidently to convince the Persian Sou-verain [sic] of the truth of the new religion and at the same time to reassure [him] of the essentially peaceful character of its propaganda. It is not surpris-ing that Bahá’[u’lláh] did not reach his goal. As it takes a lot of patience to read the ‘revelation’ of the ‘prisoner’ from the beginning to the end and pen-etrate into its meaning it is more than probable that neither the Souverain nor his counselors took pains to do it. The very name of the Babis has been odious since the time of the [Babi] uprising and the attempt [on the Shah’s life], and all the eloquence of the present Head of the sect will never be able to lay to rest the government’s fears (ibid., 216). Let us now turn our attention to the concluding part of the report.[P. 7/b] En attendant les tendances subversives de cette secte se manifestent / par de profanations qui ont été commises dans plusieurs mosquées, tant à Téhéran qu’aux environs et qui ne sauraient avoir d’autre but que celui d’exaspérer la population d’ébranler sa confiance dans le gouvernement.Les événements que je viens de retracer sont de nature à fixer la plus sérieuse attention du gouvernement du Shah, entendu que les annals d’aucun autre pays du monde n’offrent d’aussi frappants exemples de la facilité avec laquelle les différentes doctrines sociales et réligieuses se sont répandues en Perse.Translation:[P. 7/6] In the meantime, the subversive tendencies of this sect are shown by the atrocities which were committed in several mosques, in both Teheran and other places, which could have no other purpose but to upset the population and undermine their confidence in the government.The events which I have just described are of such a nature as to demand the most serious attention of the Shah’s government, given that the annals of no other country offer such striking examples of the ease with which different social and religious doctrines have spread in Persia."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"74 Part IIComments:The concluding passage above also merits attention. Its tone, apart from the alle-gations it contains, reveals clearly that the diplomat (diplomats) behind the report was (were) by no means sympathetic to the Babis/Baha’is and did not look for-ward to the advancement of the Babi or Baha’i Cause. That the offi cial attitude of the Russian authorities towards the Baha’is and especially towards the Babi move-ment refl ected in the attitude of many Russian government offi cials and diplomats was far from being ‘exceptionally friendly’ is supported by the evidence of some other documents in the Archive (see letters and comments below).Therefore it is very important to make a distinction between the personal atti-tude of certain Russians (diplomats and scholars) towards the Babi/Baha’i Faiths and the official position of the Russian government. If the former might have been personally attracted to the Babi and Baha’i teachings (at least some of them like Tumanski and Batyushkov were), the Russian authorities’ official policy towards the Babi/Baha’i Faiths was decidedly balanced. The government did not show any preference to the Babis and Baha’is over any other religious community, includ-ing Muslims. Moreover, when it came to choosing between Babis/Baha’is and Muslims, especially in Iran, they preferred to support the latter or at best not to interfere on either side. As for the Babi movement in general, the Russian authori-ties had every reason to view it with suspicion, which was their standard approach to any movement, which they classed as or suspected of being ‘social’ and there-fore ‘revolutionary.’ That is exactly how they viewed the Babi movement.The narratives contained in the following documents in many respects match Shoghi Effendi’s account of the same events, at the same time being complementary to it.2.Deposit: 777/inventory: 1/unit: 99Бабиды в АдрианополеДонесение Упр[авляющего] Конс[ульством] в Адрианополе от 26 Авг. 68 г. за No 88[P. 1/а] Вашему Превосходительству известно, что в 1862 г.

There was beside other ‘Babis’ someone named Husayn-‘Alí who plays the role of a great Shaykh8 among his own people.Until quite recently the Babis stayed in Adrianople living a quiet and solitary life: performing quite carefully their religious ceremonies and being engaged in small trade.Comments: It is curious that the Báb is defi ned in the document as ‘a poet,’ which suggests an analogy with the Prophet Muhammad and other Prophets of the past, mentioned in the Koran (see verses 21:5; 37:35; 52:30; 69:41), who were also referred to as ‘poets’ as they started their prophetic mission. The Báb is incorrectly named: His middle name Muhammad precedes his fi rst name ‘Alí. The indicated year of Bahá’u’lláh’s banishment to Adrianople from Baghdad is also wrong. This incor-rect date (1862 instead of 1863) of the given event produced, as it seems, a confus-ing effect on Rosen, pushing him to an erroneous conclusion, which he expressed in the Collections Scientifi ques:... they (Bahá’u’lláh and His followers) must have been interned to Adri-anople in 1862 and not in 1864 ...

The correct date is given by Tumanski in the Introduction to the Kitáb-i-Aqdas: ‘After a four-month journey Bahá’u’lláh arrived in Constantinople, probably, at the end of summer or the beginning of the fall of 1863’ (Tumanski 1899: xv). Though Tumanski speaks here of arriving in Constantinople, it is obvious from the context that he did not separate this event from Bahá’u’lláh’s banishment to Adrianople.The document attributes the cause of this banishment (first from Baghdad to Constantinople and from there to Adrianople) to the insistent requests of the Per-sian mission in Constantinople, which matches completely the account of this event in Baha’i sources. In God Passes By one reads: ‘Such has been the interposition of God’, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá ... affirms, ‘that the joy evinced by them hath been turned to chagrin and sorrow, so much so that the Persian consul-general in Baghdad regrets exceedingly the plans and plots the schemers had devised’, ‘This Ambassador10 was pressed continually by his government to persist in the policy of arousing against Bahá’u’lláh the hostility of the Turkish authorities’. (Effendi 1995: 150, 159) This is also echoed by Tumanski’s account:The Persian consul in Baghdad, Mírzá Busurg Khán, was hostile towards the Babis of Baghdad ... Shaykh ‘Abdu’l-Husayn found an active ally in the consul, and it was decided to act through Tehran, where reports started to pour in concerning the danger for the State coming from so close a proxim-ity of such inconvenient emigrants as the Babis of Baghdad to its borders and Shi‘ih pilgrim sites. These reports produced an effect and at the urgent request of the Persian envoy in Constantinople, Hájí Mírzá Husayn Khán Mushíru’d-Dawlih, the Turkish government summoned the Babis of Bagh-dad to Constantinople. (Tumanski 1899: xiv, translation mine) That the Baha’is lived a quiet and humble life is mentioned repeatedly throughout the diplomatic reports (see documents below).Let us now go back to the report.В конце Июля месяца здешний Каимакам11 получил телеграмму от Верховного визиря, в которой Аали-паша [sic] предписывал ему немед-ленно же отправить, под конвоем всех персидских эмигрантов в [P. 1/b] Галлиполи, где их будет ожидать комиссар от порты, / которому даны надлежащие инструкции для дальнейшего путешествия бабидов.Нечего и говорить, что турецкие власти, от излишнего усердия, не преминули пересолить приказания Аали-Паши и тем возбудили крайнее"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"Russian diplomats’ reports and private letters 77негодование и без того уже рассерженных бабидов (sic).12 Адрианополь-ский Каимакам13 прежде всего и без всякой нужды приказал заключить в тюрьму всех персидских эмигрантов, исключая их шейха, который находился в [sic] домашнем аресте.

First the Adrianople Qaimaqam, without any reason, ordered the imprisonment of all the Persian emigrants, except their Shaykh, who was under house arrest. This measure embittered the Babis to the extent that one of them even attempted suicide. While [they were] arrested the Qaimaqam sold the Babis’ entire property and paid off their debts to both the Turkish and Greek subjects.Comments:‘Alí Páshá (‘Alí Páshá Muhammad Amín) was prime minister of the Ottoman Empire at the time.

(The postscript note below the passage provides a plausible reason behind the timing of the edict.) As in the above-men-tioned sources, the account mentions Gallipoli as the place where the exiles were fi rst moved on their way to Akka. The last paragraph also corresponds to Baha’i sources in the description of the sympathy shown by the population of Adrianople towards the Baha’is, with whom they had had the opportunity to become familiar over several years, and their frustration with the government’s decision to ban-ish Bahá’u’lláh and His followers from their midst. Shoghi Effendi, quoting Áqá Rizá, writes: ‘A great tumult seized the people ... All were perplexed and full of regret ... Some expressed their sympathy, others consoled us, and wept over us ...’ (Effendi 1995: 180–181).The account of events related in the above document is strikingly similar to the description given by Shoghi Effendi in God Passes By. The reader will see even more remarkable parallels with it in the document below. But fi rst let us turn our attention to the postscript note following the letter on the back of the page, which was probably not part of the original. It may provide a clue to understanding why the Persian ambassador was so anxious to have the Baha’is exiled at that particular time. The man whose opinion is quoted in the postscript is Ignatyev. The other individual mentioned is V. I. Vitman.[P. 2/a] В препроводительном письме к В. И. Витману Н. П.

Interestingly enough, the narrator attributes the main role in those events to Qurratu’l-‘Ayn or Táhirih, the greatest heroine of the Babi movement.To cast some light on the story related in the passage, it would be useful to quote a few lines from E. G. Browne:Hájí Mullá Muhammad Takí of Kazvín was, as mentioned by Gobineau, the uncle and father-in-law of Kurratu’l-‘Ayn, the Bábí heroine.

Let us now return to the document.[P. 16/а]39 В свою очередь Сеид / Мехмет был схвачен и посажен в кре-пость Чегра (между Дильмаром и Урмией). Он провел в тюрьме 7 лет. Он нашел возможность сноситься со своими последователями и (по утверждению персидского Правительства) Мюриды его несколько раз проникали в Тегеран с целью убить Шаха. Однажды будто бы Шах был легко ранен выстрелами из пистолета и ударом кинжала. Схваченные мюриды сознались в своем преступлении и выдали Сеид Мехмета. /[P. 16/b] Они были немедленно казнены.

Наибы Сеид Мехмеда (sic) начали борьбу с правительством (это было в шести-десятых годах хиджры40).Translation:[P. 16/a]41 Seid / Mehmet was seized in his turn and incarcerated in the fortress of Chihriq (between Dilmar and Urumiyyih). He spent 7 years in prison. He found a way to communicate with his followers and (according to the assertion of the Per-sian Government) his Murids42 penetrated into Tehran several times attempting to assassinate the Shah. Once, the Shah was allegedly slightly wounded by gunshots and a dagger. The murids who were [P. 16/b] seized confessed their crime and gave away Seid Mehmet. / They were immediately executed. Meanwhile, Seid Mehmet’s Naibs43 started a fi ght in Zingan (?)44 with the government (this was in the sixties of Hijrih).Comments:The account in the passage is obviously based on a confusion of events. The attempt on Násiri’d-Dín Sháh’s life, which is apparently related here, took place in 1852 (two years after the Báb’s execution), having nothing to do with the Báb’s arrest and subsequent trial.45The document continues:[P. 16/b] Привезенный46 в Тегеран Сеид Мехмед был представлен соб-ранию улем,47 которым он объявил что он настоящий Мехди (Мехди ..."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"84 Part IIрасул) ожидаемый персиянами.

A commotion started to spread, and for the execution to be car-ried out Christian soldiers were selected. After the first volley which slightly wounded Seid Mehdi,55 the convicted rent the ropes asunder and fled. He hid under the roof of the watchman’s little house and nobody attempted to deter him.

No doubt, he found it equally incredible to picture how a wounded person, tied to a high pillar could ‘rend the ropes asunder’, and then jump down from the pillar and escape. And if the wounded man had been strong enough to do this after being shot, would it not have been much easier for him to attempt an escape before he was tied to the pillar and shot at? However, his comparison by no means detracts from the value of the account, as it represents confi rmation, from an independent source, of the fact that, when the smoke from the rifl es cleared, the Báb inexplicably disap-peared from the scene after he was shot, as a number of other sources attest.57 Let us now go back to the document. Starting with the next passage, we will observe many parallels with the account of the events in Baha’i sources. I will quote them to highlight these parallels.[P. 18/a] Со смертью Сеид Мехмеда ему наследовал сын его Шейх Хусейн Али, бывший до того времени наибом отца. – Преследование бабидов продолжалось в Персии и Шейх Хусейн Али убежал с частью [P. 18/b] своих последователей в Багдад. / От времени до времени он посылал оттуда своих мюридов в Персию, где их убивали тотчас как власти узнавали о их появлении.Персидское правительство обращалось к Султану со требованием о выдаче бабидов, но Шейх Хусейн просил покровительства Турок, дока-зывая что он и его последователи сунниты, тогда как Персы шииты [P. 19/а] и что вследствие этой разницы всех их зарежут / по прибытии их в Персию. Абдул Азиз приказал привезти Шейх Хусейна и его последова-телей в Константинополь.

In fact Bahá’u’lláh stayed in Constantinople for four months. The definition of Bahá’u’lláh (Shaykh Husayn-‘Alí) as the Báb’s son might be considered a curious confusion if not a gross misrepresentation. However, the fol-lowing words: ‘who until that time had been his father’s naib’ may hold a clue to this mistake. ‘Naib’ in the given context could well mean ‘secretary’. One should not forget that the Báb’s amanuensis’ name was also Husayn: Siyyid Husayn of Yazd (Effendi 1995: 53, Momen W. 1989: 15). The similarity of the names Husayn-‘Ali and Siyyid Husayn has brought about a confusion in much more recent days. In the essay by N. A. Kuznetsova, one of the very few Soviet scholars who made a sincere effort to present an accurate account of Babi and Baha’i his-tory, Bahá’u’lláh, however, is described as the one who ‘was imprisoned together with the Báb but refuted His teaching [at the last moment]’ (Kuznetsova 1978: 83). This grievous error would never have occurred but for the confusion of names, because the given episode is in fact connected with the Báb’s amanuensis. If we admit a similar confusion in the case of the diplomatic document this would at least account for Bahá’u’lláh’s being portrayed as the Báb’s secretary though will by no means explain why he is also presented as the ‘Báb’s son’.‘The year 1279’ (with the question mark) might hold a clue to understanding why Baron Rosen, though not without a grain of doubt, assumed that Bahá’u’lláh was banished to Constantinople and Adrianople from Baghdad in 1862 (see above). The year AH 1279 corresponded to the seven months (greater part) of the year AD 1862 and the first five months (lesser part) of the year 1863. The May of 1863 fell in the last month of 1279. Without the precise month of Hijrih being indicated in the report(s), one could easily make an error in one’s calculation. This wrong conver-sion of dates from the Moslem lunar calendar into the Christian solar calendar may also account for the same mistake in the previous report from Adrianople.In the last three lines of the passage (as in the previous document), the blame for banishing Bahá’u’lláh to Constantinople and further to Adrianople is laid specifi-cally on the Persian ambassador Mushíru’d-Dawlih (Mushir et Doule), who ‘made every effort to have the sectarians extradited’. This is completely in accord with Shoghi Effendi’s account:That fateful and ignominious decision, arrived at by the Sultán and his chief ministers, ‘Alí Páshá and Fu’ád Páshá, was in no small degree attributable to the persistent intrigues of the Mushíru’d-Dawlih, Mírzá Husayn Khán, the Persian Ambassador to the Sublime Porte, denounced by Bahá’u’lláh as His “calumniator,” who awaited the first opportunity to strike at Him and the Cause of which He was now the avowed and recognized leader.

This also matches completely the account in Baha’i sources:The revelation of so many important Tablets, and the proclamation of Bahá’u’lláh’s Message to the kings and the rulers of the world, had endowed the Faith with such ascendancy that by the summer of 1868 the authorities in Constantinople had become apprehensive of its rising prestige and power. (Taherzadeh 1996, 2: 397)As for the representatives of foreign countries willing to intervene with the Turk-ish authorities on behalf of Bahá’u’lláh and His decline to take advantage of the foreign powers’ help as stated in the document – a clear confi rmation of this fact can be found in Baha’i sources: Some of the consuls of foreign powers called on Bahá’u’lláh, and expressed their readiness to intervene with their respective governments on His behalf – suggestions for which He expressed appreciation, but which He firmly declined. “The consuls of that city (Adrianople) gathered in the presence of this Youth at the hour of His departure», He Himself has written, “and expressed their desire to aid Him. They, verily, evinced towards Us manifest affection”. (Effendi 1995: 180)The treatment of events related to sending Bahá’u’lláh and His followers to Akka through Gallipoli where they were taken under convoy, and Mírzá Yahyá to Cyprus also generally corresponds with the account in Baha’i sources: The government’s original order was to banish Bahá’u’lláh, Áqáy-i-Kalím and Mírzá Muhammad-Qulí, with a servant to ‘Akka, while the rest were to proceed to Constantinople.

About six months later they transferred to more commodious quarters, known as the house of Amru’lláh (House of God’s command) situated on the northern side of the mosque of Sultán Salím.

All these were important factors ...’ (Taherzadeh 1996, 2: 398).The document also emphasizes the friendly relations between the Baha’is and the local population of Palestine.

As you can easily imagine, of the remaining articles the one [P. 11/b] which has interested / me most is A. Tumanski’s letter. The book arrived in the very 2nd week since I had intentionally made the acquaintance of one of the most learned and respectable Babis in Tehran, that same اديب احسن ميرزا,1 who has compiled the Persian grammar sent to you via me for your Alekseevich, and has participated in the publishing of the دانشوران نامۀ2 (which ceased to exist after the 1st volume, because it was a Government edition, which has no chance of surviving in Persia, since any endeavor that involves expenses and does not promise huge profit is not favored by the Shah and his M[ini]sters) and who is the author of some other historic works وغيره.3 I found out that he belongs to ‘them’ آنطائفه,4 as we refer [to them] out of caution, from his extremely liberal comments on Islam and his readiness to introduce me to one of the chief Ѕحق اهل,5 who, however, still avoids meeting with Babis. The division of the inheritance of a Babi, a Russian subject (there is a large number of them in the Caucasus), who kept quite a few Ba[bi] manuscripts and books, happened just in time. Obviously, I tried to get hold of these papers as if they were useless when [P. 12/a] settling [banking]accounts, and thus / saved from publicity a lot of ...6, which could otherwise have suffered considerable damage, for the Gov[ernmen]t and the cl[er]gy view them with great suspicion as proved by the Baku incident. This [division of] the inheritance has helped me in two ways: first of all I am becoming familiar with the content of the الواح,7 which for the most part are addressed to different individuals* and almost exclu-sively contain admonitions and counsels, and [also] I am finding out about the existence of various books and prayer books; moreover, for this favor [I am doing the Babis], I am being promised books and verses which are quite will-ingly being delivered to me [by them]. Thus, I already have: the اقدس کتاب,8 which is something like our Book of Laws[,] the ايقان9 and the هيکل کتاب,10 which apart from the الهيکل ة سور11 comprises also letters to the kings and many other [things] – the book was printed in Bombay in 1308 (certainly, it costs 19 qirans), and I have been promised transcripts from the Akka Archive (in Akka copies of all the letters and epistles are preserved).[Footnote by Batyushkov]:* you see, I must read them to find out whom they are addressed to in order to return them to the addressees."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"Batyushkov’s correspondence with Rosen 105Comments:Mírzá Ahsan Adíb (Hájí Mírzá Hasan-i-Adíbu’l-‘Ulamá’), whose name Batyush-kov wrote in Persian and whom he defi ned as ‘one of the most learned and respect-able Babis’, was an eminent follower of Bahá’u’lláh. He was appointed a Hand of the Cause and identifi ed as one of the 19 Apostles of Bahá’u’lláh. In 1874 he was employed by the Qajar princes, writing a large number of encyclopedic books (Momen W. 1989: 98).‘Námiy-i-Dánishvarán’ (lit.: Scholars’ book) was an encyclopedic book published in Iran during Násiri’d-Dín Sháh’s reign under the supervision of Prince ‘Alí-Qulí Mírzá I‘tizádu’s-Saltanih, who was the minister of education of the time.‘Alekseevich’ is a Russian middle name (patronymic). The person in question is most likely to be Valentin Alekseevich Dzukovski – a well-known nineteenth century Per-sian studies scholar in Russia, who among other things published the Asrár-i-Tawhíd ...12 and wrote (together with K.

The Persian rulers have managed even to turn this sect into a revenue-making enterprise for themselves: whenever they need money, they ... [word unclear] and accuse some wealthy person of being a Babi; he has to pay [them]. / I. G. [P. 6/b] Grigorovich has succeeded in making a copy of the Babis’ Qur’an [sic], which he apparently has delivered to you. I have a Babi manuscript – the Báb’s utterances with commentaries in Persian, which I will send you."},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"114 Part IVComments:The passage of the letter starting with the words: ‘Unfortunately, it is almost impossible’ up to the words: ‘he has to pay them’ is quoted by the Soviet scholar N. A. Kuznetsova in her article (Kuznetsova 1978: 96).The Qayyumu’l-Asmá’, also known as Commentary on the Súrih of Josef, was an early Writing of the Báb which preceded the Bayán. One of its two transcripts is in the manuscript collection of the IOM, added to the given collection on 12 August 1880 as a gift from I. G. Grigorovich (Chief translator of the Russian Diplomatic mission in Tehran). Its code is С 1167. The transcript was finished in AH 1297 / AD 1880, and, according to a postscript in Russian, was ‘a copy made from the original, preserved in the Library of Prince ‘Alí-Qulí Mírzá I‘tizádu’s-Saltanih, son of Fath-‘Alí Sháh, [who was] Minister of Education’. The latter (original) manuscript was dated AH 1261 / AD 1845 (Ioannesyan 2006: 80–81). Given the fact that the Babis regarded the Qayyumu’l-Asmá’ as their ‘Qur’an’ (Momen W. 1989: 190), the reference in the letter to the ‘copy of the Babis’ Qur’an’ obtained by I. G. Grigorovich must imply this particular manuscript. As for the manuscript of ‘the Báb’s utterances with commentaries in Persian’, which Ignatyev promised to send Rosen, neither does any of the manuscripts in the IOM collection well match this description nor bear a sign of being a gift from Ignatyev.There is a long stretch of time (nine years) between Ignatyev’s first letter and his second letter to Rosen. Moreover, whereas the former was sent from Iran the latter was sent from Russian Turkestan.2.Deposit: 777/inventory: 2/unit: 186[from a letter dated 25 March 1892, sent from Ashkabad][P. 18/а]ГлубокоуважаемыйВиктор Романович,Простите ради Бога, что ответ мой на Ваше письмо так сильно запоздал. Полно спешной работы пред отъездом Куропаткина, а затем составле-ния политических отчетов, которые недавно только отправил в Петер-бург, причиною замедления было отчасти и то обстоятельство, что нельзя было дать переписывать перевод безграмотным писарям нашей Канцелярии, а единственный порядочный писарь, который написал уже один экземпляр перевода для Куропаткина, был завален работой."},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"Ignatyev’s correspondence with Rosen 115 Прежде всего приношу Вам искреннюю благодарность за перевод, как от себя лично, так и по просьбе Куропаткина.

I had a lot of urgent work to do before Kuropatkin’s1 departure, after which I was busy compiling political reports, which I sent to [St]Petersburg quite recently, the reason for this delay was partly the fact that it was impossi-ble to entrust our Office’s illiterate clerks with copying the translation, while the only proper clerk, who had already written a copy for Kuropatkin, was overloaded with work. First of all I would like to express to you our sincere appreciation for the translation both from myself and on Kuropatkin’s behalf. He took the [P. 18/b] translation with him to [St]Petersburg.

I presented the translation to Kur[opatkin] with a short report, in which I conveyed [to him] your opinion about the documents.Comments:It is hard to tell what particular Baha’i writings referred to as ‘documents’ are implied in the passage. It might well have been the Glad Tidings by Bahá’u’lláh sent to Rosen, which the latter published in the original and his translation (see more on it in Buck and Ioannesyan 2010: 20–21). It is obvious from the letter that Ignatyev had communication with Tumanski in Ashkabad. We will see further proof of it at the end of the letter."},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"116 Part IVSince there is no distinction between the ‘soft’ [h] and the ‘hard’ [h] sounding like [kh] in Russian it is more than likely that Bahá’u’lláh’s ‘Secretary Hajiullah’ stands for ‘Khádimu’lláh (Servant of God)’, which was the title given to Mírzá Áqá Ján – Bahá’u’lláh’s amanuensis. Let us go back to the letter.Аккский узник повидимому раздумал ехать сюда, если только он вообще имел такое намерение. – Действительно, организация у бабидов хороша и, повидимому, они находятся в постоянном сношении между собой и подчиняются одной власти. Несомненно, что у Бехауллаха имеются повсюду надежные Агенты [sic].

Наш Посланник в Тегеране, при возбуждении переписки по вопросу о принятии в русское подданство проживающих в Асхабаде Бабидов, – сообщил Начальнику Области, что о распространенности бабидов в Персии возможны лишь гадательные суждения, но что есть основание предположить, что число последователей Баба достигает миллиона. Они рассеяны во всех слоях населения, не исключая и высшего класса.Translation:The prisoner of Akka has apparently changed his mind about coming here, if he ever really had such an intention. The Babis are indeed well organized, and apparently they are in a constant communication with each other, being under the same authority. Undoubtedly, Bahá’u’lláh has reliable Agents [sic] everywhere. The above documents, [which] are genuine, after being copied for Kuropatkin were sent to Persia for diffusion by Babis. [P. 19/a] As for the Babis’ future, / I have strong doubts about it. To begin with, they do not know themselves the extent of their strength. They do not know (or maybe just conceal ) how many they are. When correspondence about granting Russian citizenship to the Babis living in Ashkabad started, our Envoy in Tehran informed the Head of the [Transcaspian] Region that as regards the spread of the Babis in Persia, there could only be made conjectural assumptions, but there was reason to believe that the number of the Báb’s followers reached a million. They are spread among all the strata of society including the upper class.Comments:‘The prisoner of Akka’ is obviously a reference to Bahá’u’lláh. That Bahá’u’lláh might have intended to visit Ashkabad seems an improbable but not entirely impossible suggestion."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"Ignatyev’s correspondence with Rosen 117As for the ‘The Babis (Baha’is)’ future’ which Ignatyev had ‘strong doubts about’ – this is just an example of what an ungrateful job it is to make historical pre-dictions. The prominent Russian academic V. V. Bartold, in one of his critical reviews, asserted that if the Baha’i Faith had any future at all, its chances for a future were ‘in Persia only’ (Bartold 1966: 396). Browne was most positive in predicting a future for the Baha’i Faith. Thus he wrote: ‘Of one thing there can, in my opinion, be but little doubt: the future (if Bábíism, as I most firmly believe, has a future) belongs to Behá and his successors and followers’ (Browne 1891, 2: xviii). In evaluating the chances for the future of the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh and their possible role in the world in the years to come Tumanski, who definitely penetrated deeper into those teachings,3 held a more balanced and prudent view. In his Introduction to the Kitáb-i-Aqdas he wrote:We, who are almost witnesses to4 it, are not in the best position to make an exact evaluation of the significance of these events which stand among the most remarkable historical phenomena of the nineteenth century ... On 16 May 1892 (old calendar)5 in the garden of Bahji, near Akka, there ended the activities and life of Bahá’u’lláh. His grave is still too fresh to allow [us] to draw any conclusions about his reform. At any rate the ethical aspect of the new teaching merits our attention and sympathy.(Tumanski 1899: iii, xlviii, translation mine)The last lines of the above passage of the letter shows that Curzon’s estimation of the number of Babis/Baha’is in Iran did not appear exaggerated to Russian high-ranking officials (see also Tumanski’s letter # 18 and comments).The letter continues:Еще более трудно судить о том, насколько успешна пропаганда учения Баба в настоящее время. Среди суннитов число последователей секты весьма незначительно. Мне передавал здесь один персиянин задосто-верное, что не очень давно в Асхабаде сделались бабидами даже армяне (армяно-григор. исповед.). Он не хотел мне сообщить имен этих армян. Так как они, опасаясь совершенно основательно преследования со сто-роны властей, а равно и своих единоверцев, тщательно скрывают о пере-ходе в бабизм. Здесь рассчитывали, что бабизм составляет [P. 19/b] переходную ступень ко христианству и, кажется, на/деялись, что обласканные бабиды не только согласятся сами перейти в право-славие, но и окажут благодетельное [sic] влияние на других мусульман. Вышло однако наоборот: христиане сделались бабидами, но до сего времени, на сколько мне известно, ни один бабид не перешел в хрис-тианство. Если примеру двух армян последуют и другие, то придется, конечно, принять какие либо меры ..."},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"118 Part IVTranslation:At present, it is still more difficult to judge how successful the propaganda of the Báb’s teaching is. Among the Sunnis the followers of the sect are very few.6 A Persian told me with certainty that even some Armenians (of the Armenian-Gregorian Church) in Ashkabad had recently become Babis. He did not want to disclose the names of those Armenians, for they, not without good reason, fearing persecution from both the [Russian] authorities as well as from their own [former] coreligionists, carefully conceal their adoption of Babiism. It was expected here that Babiism was a transitional stage to [P. 19/b] Christianity and apparently it was hoped / that the Babis, having been treated with so much kindness, not only would agree to adopt the Russian Orthodox Church’s form of Christianity but would moreover have a benefi-cial effect on other Muslims. However, the opposite has happened: Christians became Babis, while not a single Babi has so far, to the best of my knowledge, embraced Christianity. If others follow the two Armenians’ example, then certain measures, surely, will have to be taken ...Comments:Though a large number of Baha’is fleeing from persecution in neighboring Iran found refuge in Ashkabad, it would be wrong to conclude that the Baha’is were specially favored by the Russian authorities unless by ‘being favored’ one implies being fairly treated and regarded as any other religious non-Russian Orthodox Christian community with all the rights endowed and limitations imposed on such a community by Russian law. Of course this contrasted greatly with the Baha’i situation in Iran, where they were even denied all the rights granted by Muslim society to non-Muslims, such as Christians, Jews, and even Zoroastrians, and were not protected by any religious or civil law. On the contrary, the great benefit for Bahai’s in Russia consisted in their being protected by Russian law like any other subjects or residents of the Empire. This was most clearly proved by the harsh court verdict passed on the three Shi‘ih fanatics who assassinated Hájí Muham-mad-Rizá Isfahání, a venerable Baha’i, in Ashkabad. However, the ‘favors’ of the Russian authorities did not go beyond that. As it is evident from Ignatyev’s letter, they were not interested in the growth of the Baha’i Faith even in such a Muslim-dominated region as Turkistan, let alone other regions, and were determined to check it.Let us continue with the letter:Возможно допустить, что, при весьма вероятных смутах в Персии, после смерти нынешнего Шаха, из за престола, какой либо из претендентов и прибегнет к содействию бабидов, предварительно объявив себя их пок-ровителем.

Но если он решится на это, то лишь в крайнем случае, т.е. когда все остальное население будет на стороне его соперника. А в этом слу-чае бабиды конечно не помогут ему.[P. 20/а] Само собой разумеется, что ни России, ни / Англии нет ника-кого расчета поддерживать бабидов, и для меня представляется неве-роятным, чтобы когда либо (по крайней мере в близком будущем) тако-вой расчет явился [sic]. Англичане, пользующиеся всеми возможными средствами для упрочения своего влияния в Персии, в особенности среди населения, не считают однако возможным для себя оказывать какую либо поддержку бабидам. По поводу последних жестоких каз-ней над бабидами в Йезде ни один из европейских посланников не решился сделать Шаху заявление в пользу угнетенных, конечно не из боязни возбудить неудовольствие Шаха и его Министров – неудоволь-ствие это еще не так опасно – а из опасения, как мне кажется вооружить против себя большинство населения, – несомненно враждебно относя-щегося к бабидам, – и в особенности всесильное духовенство. А что духовенство в Персии всесильно – это доказали последние события в Персии из за табачной монополии и других монополий, данных Шахом англичанам.Translation:One can imagine that given the high probability of disturbances in Persia after the death of the current Shah, some claimant [to the throne] may resort to the Babis’ assistance, first declaring himself to be their protector. It would be most reasonable to expect such a step from Zillu’s-Sultán, whose funds have recently been considerably depleted. But if he were to decide to do so, it would only be as a last resort, i.e. when the rest of the population is on his rival’s side. Surely, in this case the Babis will not help him.[P. 20/a] It is taken for granted that neither Russia nor / England have any reason to support the Babis, and it seems inconceivable to me that such a reason would ever (at least in the foreseeable future) be found. The English, who use every possible means to enhance their influence in Persia, especially among its population, do not, however, consider it possible for themselves to offer the Babis any support. Not a single European envoy dared to intercede on behalf of the persecuted with the Shah during the latest executions of the Babis in Yazd, certainly not through fear of arousing the discontent of the Shah and his Ministers – after all such discontent is not really that dangerous, but rather out of their concern, as it seems to me, not to set against themselves the majority of the population, which is undoubtedly hostile to the Babis, and especially the all-powerful clergy. That the clergy in Persia are all-powerful has been proved by the latest events in Persia around the tobacco monopoly and other monopolies granted to the English by the Shah."},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"120 Part IVComments:Zillu’s-Sultán – lit.: ‘Shadow of the King’, was the title of Prince Mas‘úd Mírzá, Násiri’d-Dín Sháh’s eldest son.This part of the letter was apparently written in response to Rosen’s question or suggestion as to the possibility of Russia’s offering support or protection to the Baha’is in Iran. The categorical rejection of such a possibility for both Russia and England by the high-ranking Russian diplomat, with the explanation of the reasons behind this rejection, is an important documented proof. Needless to say that the assertion sometimes made in Iran by some Iranian circles that Baha’is were sup-ported and used in Iran by foreign (European) powers to promote their own politi-cal aims, in the light of Ignatyev’s above statement, appears totally unfounded. Let us proceed with Ignatyev’s letter:Не могу также согласиться с Вами в том, что нашей дипломатии [P. 20/b] следовало / бы попытаться пугать Шаха бабидами, и угро-зами дальнейшего покровительства им заставить его исполнить наши требования. Во 1х угроза эта может оказаться и без сомнения окажется недействительной, что было бы неудобно для нас, а во 2х подобной угрозой, как я сказал выше, мы повредим только себе, вооружив против себя огромное большинство мусульман и духовенство. А что, если Шах на такую угрозу ответит нам: «извольте, я выполню все Ваши [sic] тре-бования, если Вы не будете принимать к себе бабидов и выдадите тех, которых Вы уже приняли»? В каком положении мы окажемся? Конечно, выдать бабидов мы ни в коем случае не можем, ибо выдача их не соот-ветствовала бы достоинству России как великой Державы. ...Напуганный беспорядками, которые ему подготовили друзья-анг-личане, Шах спешит вернуться на прежний путь и вновь приобресть [sic] расположение России. За последние 2–3 месяца он уже сделал нам [P. 21/а] несколько уступок / по пограничным вопросам в Закаспийс-кой области.

Выше я сказал, что учение бабизма среди текинцев до сих пор не имело успеха. А между тем, почва для пропаганды теперь именно как нельзя более удобна. – Замечательно, что текинцы, относившиеся, до завоевания нами Закаспийского Края, совершенно индифферентно как к исламу [sic], так и вообще ко всем религиям, становятся теперь с каж-дым годом религиознее и даже фанатичнее.

First, such a threat could and surely would be ineffective, which would make it uncomfortable for us. Sec-ond, as I have already pointed out above, we can only harm ourselves by such a threat, for we are going to set against us the vast majority of Muslims and the clergy. What if the Shah responds to the threat saying to us: ‘So be it. I will meet your terms if you do not accept the Babis in your country and extradite those whom you have already accepted’? In what situation shall we find ourselves? Definitely, under no circumstances can we extradite the Babis, because their extradition would not correspond to Russia’s image as a great power ... Scared by the disturbances which were caused by his friends, the English, the Shah is attempting a swift return to the old way and win Russia’s favor again. Over the last 2–3 months he has already made several concessions to us / [P. 21/a] in border issues in the Transcaspian Region. For this reason I am doing my best trying to prevent the issue of granting the Babis [Rus-sian] citizenship being raised, while they never cease dreaming about it and therefore remind the Governor of the Region of it whenever they get a chance. I have already pointed out above that the Babi teaching has not so far been successful among the Tekke people.7 Meanwhile, the soil for propaganda is more fertile than ever before. It is remarkable that the Tekke people, who before the Transcaspian Region was conquered by us, were absolutely indif-ferent to Islam as well as to all religions in general, are now becoming more religious and even fanatical with every passing year. Apparently, the peaceful life which they were not familiar with before the Russians came, to a cer-tain extent made the Tekke people, given their natural predisposition towards idleness and an abundance of free time, philosophers, causing them to reflect upon religious matters ...

Comments:‘Nov. Vrem.’ is an abbreviation standing most probably for ‘Novoye Vremya’ (lit.: ‘New Time’), a political–literary newspaper published in St Petersburg in 1868–1917.Ignatyev refers to events prior to 1890, because General A. V. Komarov was Head (Governor) of the Transcaspian Region until 1890. He was succeeded by General A. N. Kuropatkin, who held this post for eight years: 1890–1898 (more details of his background are given on p. 000). It is General Komarov who is mentioned by Bahá’u’lláh in His epistle to the Baha’i community of Ashkabad addressed to ‘Abdu’l-Karím. Praising the Russian authorities for their execution of justice with respect to the violent murder of the prominent Baha’i Hájí Muhammad-Rizá Isfahání in 1889, the founder of the Baha’i Faith referred to General Komarov as ژنرالاکرم – ‘the most noble general’ (Tumanski 1892: 318).A brief report on Komarov’s presentation titled: ‘Some data concerning the reli-gious teaching, habits, and activity of the Babis of Ashkabad’ at a meeting of the Oriental Department of the Archeological Society was published in the Memoirs ... (Komarov 1893, Karskaya 2000: 178). The content of the presentation is not disclosed in the report. It is very likely that this is the very meeting Ignatyev refers to in the above passage of the letter. That the issue of Memoirs came out a year after Ignatyev’s letter was written does not preclude his referring to this event in his letter, since the material for the given issue might well have been submitted for publication earlier.The letter continues:На днях произошел факт, который может неблагоприятно отозваться на [P. 24/b] торговле здешних бабидов.

When I returned to my native country, I engaged myself in arranging these materials, and though I wanted to write a comprehensive book about these issues, still I considered it advisable to first write a brief work with an account of the history of the religion of the Babis, the story of my own sojourn among them, a detailed list of the titles of their books and compositions work by work, and the explanation of their beliefs from the beginning of the Manifestation up to now. Thus, according to [the saying] ‘a little proves much, one drink is indicative of a pool and a shaking (?) is a proof of a large threshing floor’, there would be an example of this treasury and the first fruits of this vineyard. Therefore I wrote two papers for The Royal Asi-atic Society. One is an account of what I have seen among the Babis, which has already been published. The other is an explanation of the Babi teachings. That one will come out at the beginning of autumn, / if it is [P. 3/a] the will of God, the Most High. When I was engaged in writing those works, the book which your Lordship had written on this subject, i.e. ‘Collections Scienti-fiques de l’Institut des Langues Orientales’, came to my notice. I was very happy to peruse it and drew a lot of benefit from it. As I saw that [you] had greatly expanded the bounds of knowledge by that excellent book and made an advanced effort to explain very hidden and obscure issues, I considered it my duty to offer your Lordship a copy of this first work of mine. Even though it is not worthy, perhaps, your Lordship may find it entertaining to read it for half an hour. At any rate I count on Your [P. 2/b] Excellency’s kindness and generosity / and that you will not be hard on me for the small size and brevity of these unbefitting memoirs, for it is said:‘An ant’s gift is a locust’s leg’My teacher, who passed away two months ago – Dr. Wright, was apparently one of your Lordship’s friends, for I heard him praise you a lot. I will not give you any more trouble.4 God willing, the work will reach [you] together with this petition. The second work, which is more important than this, I will send you as soon as it comes out.

I was very anxious to [P. 4/b] learn what books the latter represented, & where the collection / had been bestowed, especially as all the books collected by M.

For Dorn, academician and Director of the Asiatic Museum, see Introduction.Let us continue with Browne’s letter:I am extremely pleased to learn that you are preparing notices of other Bábí M.S.S. recently acquired by the St. Petersburg Library & look forward anx-iously to the appearance of the book in question ... ... my second article (on the Literature & Doctrines of the Bábís) is in the press now ...

One object I had in putting forward these papers also was to call forth criticism, so that my erroneous ideas which I had formed might be removed. – Already I have received information which compelled me to modify some of the views I expressed in the first paper – e. g. I wrote to a friend of mine at Shiraz who is in some degree related to the Báb and begged him to try to obtain for me more accurate information about the Founder of the New Religion, especially, if possible, the date of his birth.

I also learn that ميرزايحيیُصبحازل8 is still living in Cyprus.Comments:The date of the Báb’s birth mentioned by Browne needs correction. Actually the Báb was born on the 1st of Muharram AH 1235.As a profound scholar, Browne, like his Russian contemporaries Rosen and Tumanski, saw in the great religious movement which started in 1844 in Iran with the Báb’s declaration of His mission, the birth of a new religion. However, if Tumanski and Rosen in the early 1890s already applied the term ‘new religion’ to the Baha’i Faith, the British Orientalist remarkably, though not surprisingly in 1889, 26 years after Bahá’u’lláh’s declaration of His mission, still implied by the ‘New Religion’ and its ‘Founder’ the Babi Faith and the Báb respectively. Whether this was altogether due to the fact that he simply did not keep pace with history or he intentionally downplayed the importance of Bahá’u’lláh’s mission which surpassed by its significance any prior event is a question which is not easy to resolve. It might well have been both. What is certain, however, is the fact that Browne, being absolutely fascinated with the person of the Báb, found it difficult to accept the idea that the Babi dispensation had not lasted longer. He admitted it himself in his article:I must now conclude this necessarily imperfect consideration of the doctrine of the Báb to pass on to the subsequent developments of it by Behá and oth-ers. I do so with regret, for who can fail to be attracted by the gentle spirit of Mírzá ‘Alí Muhammad? (Browne 1889b: 933) Let us continue with Browne’s letter: In this way I hope that gradually a mass of information may be collected which may make our knowledge of this subject fairly complete. I only wish [P. 5/b] that other / Orientalists would follow the admirable example which you have set them, & make known to the world the treasures concealed in their Libraries. In case it may be of any use or interest to you, I herewith enclose a list of the Babi M.S.S. in my own collection, & those which I have been able to find in the British Museum. If any question of identity arises, I should be very glad to send fuller particulars about them, as it seems to me the first thing is to form an idea of the number of Bábí works & copies of each in Europe.

He proclaimed in it his claims and station, calling on monarchs and rulers to renounce their possessions and embrace his Cause. Browne expressed the same doubts almost in the same language concerning Bahá’u’lláh’s authorship of the given Tablet in his second paper on the literature and doctrines of the Babis/Baha’is in which he ascribed it to Mírzá Yahyá (Browne 1889b: 957–958). Baron Rosen by his convincing arguments proved to Browne that the author of the Súrih of the Kings could be no one except for Bahá’u’lláh (Collections Scientifiques ... 1891, VI: 146–148). The British Orientalist agreed to Rosen’s arguments, which put an end to his doubts (Browne 1892b: 270, 273–276, Browne 1891, 2: 108, footnote 1).The other title mentioned in the letter is the Alváh-i-Salátín (Tablets/Epistles to the Kings/Rulers). This implies a number of Tablets addressed by Bahá’u’lláh to kings and rulers of the world individually, which includes Násiri’d-Dín Sháh (of Persia), Napoleon III, Kaiser Wilhelm I, Francis Joseph (of Austria and Hungary), Pope Pius IX, Tsar Alexander II (of Russia) and Queen Victoria (see also com-ments to Browne’s letter # 6).

Work on the History (on which I am now engaged) will take me at least 6 or 8 months[,] more[over] the بيان29 will take a long time ... I am very greatly interested in your description of your new unique MS. I think you must be right after all about the letters being all Behá’s, in spite of the difficulties involved in this supposition.Comments:The above passage clearly demonstrates the difference of approach between Rosen and Browne. If Rosen (like Tumanski) applied himself fully to the publication of Bahá’u’lláh’s writings, Browne did not consider them a priority, focusing prima-rily on texts related to the previous dispensation. However, the two scholars can be seen as complementing each other in their studies. Rosen did publish the original text of the Tablet of the Temple (Súriy-i-Haykal) together with the Tablets to the Kings/Rulers (Alváh-i-Salátín) in the Collections Scientifiques in 1891 (Collec-tions Scientifiques ... 1891, VI: 149–192). ‘The unique manuscript’ mentioned in the passage is obviously the manuscript volume consisting of 29 Epistles of Bahá’u’lláh belonging now to the collection of the IOM, code: B 1142 (Ioannesyan 2006a: 88). Bahá’u’lláh’s authorship of the given Epistles was first established by Baron Rosen. The latter described the manuscript in Vol. I of the Collections Scientifiques (Collections Scientifiques ... 1877, I: 191–212). These Epistles form the first part of the Volume of the Epistles of Bahá’u’lláh published by Rosen in the original (Rosen 1908).Speaking of the Súriy-i-Haykal by Bahá’u’lláh, Browne remarked:[P. 18/a, b] I am extremely30 glad you / have got the MS of this very impor-tant document & I hope you will publish all of it, or at least as much as you can – I have again heard a few days ago that Behá is dead, and that the Bábís are keeping it very secret, having put an old man called \u0002از\u00076 8$\u0011 :\u001b$;331 in his place. This statement is on the same authority as before, but more confidently reiterated."},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"142 Part VIIComments:The last lines of the above passage reporting ‘the death of Bahá’u’lláh’ in 1889 (three years before it really occurred) based on a statement from an Azali source, ‘more confidently reiterated’, reveal that the Azali sources which Browne so much relied upon for his information did not suffer from a lack of vivid imagi-nation. Browne, though not without a grain of doubt, made reference to this unconfirmed report in his work: The Bábís of Persia (Browne 1889b: 517, foot-note 1).The following letter presents Browne’s account of his trip to Cyprus and Pales-tine during which he visited Bahá’u’lláh and Mírzá Yahyá (Subh-i-Azal). Browne draws a picture of the journey from a slightly different perspective than in his published account of that historic trip.7.Deposit: 777/inventory: 2/unit; 42[from a letter dated 6 May 1890]Pembroke College, Cambridge[P. 7/a] ... My journey – as I daresay you will have desired was intimately connected with the same object. It appeared to me that for a proper under-standing of the subject (apart from the great interest one feels in beholding face to face the prime movers in a great national or religious movement) it was very desirable to have a personal interview with the chiefs of both par-ties of Bábís, since from them (if they chose to speak) the most authentic and detailed accounts might be expected So, having obtained some extension of the Easter vacation, I once more turned my face Eastwards, and on March 19th landed in Cyprus. Next day I [P. 7/b] proceeded to Famagusta, where I remained about / 17 days, during which time I had daily interviews with Subh-i-Ezel. I found the old man very pleas-ant & courteous, and by no means uncommunicative. & every afternoon, note-book in hand, I sat drinking tea with him, & writing down every fact relating to the history or doctrine of the early Babis which he let drop. But on one point on which I particularly desired information he was very reticent – viz. the ori-gin of the schism, & the beginning of the rupture between himself and Behá. Besides the information achieved from Subh-i-Ezel himself I obtained from him 2 MSS – one containing besides some of his own writings [,] some of the writings of جنابقدّوس )حاجیمحمّدعلیبارفروشی(:32 the other containing a work of his own called لآلیومجالی333 consisting of short aphorisms.

He also showed me some of the “talismans”35 referred to by Kazem"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"Browne’s correspondence with Rosen 143Beg, which he said were written by the Báb himself.

Subh-i-Ezel has 5 sons with him in Cyprus, & about 3 or 4 followers (Per-sians – all from Zenján) who have settled there so as to be near him. He has also several daughters. By the kindness of the Governor-General of Cyprus I was permitted to [P. 8/a] examine all the papers / (some, however, being confidential‹privileged) referring to the exiles. Unfortunately the original Turkish documents which indicated the crime wherewith they were charged appear to have been destroyed or carried off by the Turkish K.á’im-mak.ám or the British occu-pation.

Commenting on the phrase from the Persian Bayán (Wáhid 5, chapter 10): ‘God hath appointed the Figures (Haykal) to Men and the Circles (Dá’ira) to Women, that they should write thereon what they will from the Bayán’, Browne wrote: These ‘Figures’ and ‘Circles’ are both talismanic in character, the former generally in the shape of a pentacle. I have in my possession several which I have received from Subh-i-Ezel and his followers. Like so much else of what is occult and mysterious in the primitive Bábí doctrine, they appear to have been discarded by the Bahá’ís. (Momen M., 1987: 366–367, also footnote 1).The next passage contains an account of the second part of Browne’s trip which took him to Akka and provided him with an opportunity to see Bahá’u’lláh:After leaving Cyprus (on April 6th) I proceeded to Beyrout, & thence, after a delay of 5 days (for I had to obtain permission from Behá to approach him) to Acre. This delay unfortunately reduced my time at Acre to 5 days (for the ride thither & back occupied 3 days each way), but during these 5 days I was completely amongst the Bábís, who treated me with unbounded Kindness.

He is to look at a very majestic old man – but though he must be 70 at least his long beard & hair are quite black. He wears a very tall namad )نمد(37 cap with a small white turban. His manner is gracious and dignified, but somewhat restless, suggesting great stores of energy. He talked for the most part of the necessity of all nations choosing one language as a means of international communication & one writing (a sort of sermon on the concluding text of the لوحاقدس38) & of the necessity of putting down war & international jealousy & hostility. Of doctrine properly so called he spoke little. I might write pages on all that I saw & heard, but to the present I must con-fine myself to the above brief outline. Of course I hope to publish the result of my journey ere long. At Acre I obtained an authenticated copy of the ايقان39 written by their special scribe زَينَالمقرّبين40 & (more valuable) a new history of the sect approved & sanctioned by Behá himself – This is chiefly valuable because it treats less of the Báb than of Behá, & because it has passed under the ...

These latter interested me very much, for though as I mentioned to you I several times had the سورۀهيکل42 in my hands I had not time to read it at all, nor could I secure a copy, though the Bábís promised to get one made for me and send it. There is no doubt that it is one of the most important of Behá’s works – & St. Petersbourg is to be much congratulated in possessing a copy – I have sometimes fancied that the difficulty in obtain-ing certain of the older الواح43 of Behá is not altogether fortuitous. It may be that they are less anxious to exhibit writings written during the [P. 9/b] period that Behá was still maturing his designs. Moreover I / fancy the Behá’is are anxious that Subh-i-Ezel should as far as possible be forgotten & his exist-ence ignored, for no doubt his claims are strong, if probably advanced, to be the خليفه44 of the Báb.

Its text was not among the 29 Epistles of the manuscript currently contained in the collection of the IOM (see explanation on p. 000), which formed the first part of the Volume of Epistles of Bahá’u’lláh published by Rosen.

According to another روايت73 it was written by a munshí74 in his employment who is now dead. My own opinion is that it was probably the result of the joint labours of the two, as I have suggested in a Note in the “Traveller’s Narrative”.

Vol. VI. It would be logical to infer that by the Tablet (لوح) ‘called forth thereby’, despite the singular form of the word, two Epistles by Bahá’u’lláh to the Baha’is of Ashkabad on the occasion of the given events are implied. The Epistles were published by Tumanski in a special article (Tumanski 1892: 314–321) and by Rosen in the mentioned volume of the Collections Scien-tifiques (see also Ignatyev’s letter # 3 and comments).For the so-called ‘new script’ (خطبديع), see Tumanski’s letter # 8, comments and footnotes.Let us now return to Browne’s letter:"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"152 Part VIIThe proofs which you sent me this time were extremely interesting.

He is mentioned in the records which I still have occa-sion to quote in the notes of my book. He escaped from the Island before the English occupation, went to Acre, & after a while returned to Beyrout, where he is believed to be still living under another name. With regard to the chronology of Nabil’s poem, it is not faultless I fancy, but as to the dates of the different migrations from the data given by the Bábí writings it would appear:(1) That Behá’, S.ubh.-i-Ezel, & etc. went to Baghdad about the end of 1852, i.e. 3 or 4 months after the great persecution of Teherán.(2) That they remained at Baghdad 11 years or a little more – i.e. till the beginning of 1864.(3) They were then transferred to Constantinople (accomplishing the jour-ney thither slowly over land viâ Mosul, Diyár Bekir & Samsun, & thence by sea.(4) At Constantinople they remain 4 months./[P. 21/a](5) They reach Adrianople in 1864.If the “Traveller’s Narrative” [To say nothing of the Musulman historian (ناسخالتواريخ)80 which mentions Mírzá H.usayn ‘Alí of Núr who can be no other than Behá as one of those arrested at Teherán in Aug. – Sept. 1852 & spared from death in default of definite evidence against him]81 be true, Behá cannot have reached Baghdád much before the end of 1852.

Suppose he arrived at Bagh-dad in S.afar A.H. 1269 (November–December A.D. 1852) which would seem the earlier date possible – suppose he remained there 11 years (for in other passages he says “11” not “12”) he could not have left Baghdad before S.afar [P. 21/b] A.H. 1280 (July 1863) and possibly did not leave till later in the / same year.

As for the incorrect date, I have already made a suggestion that the one year error in dating this event AD 1864 instead of 1863) might have been caused by a miscalculation in the conversion of years from the lunar Muslim calendar to the solar Christian (see comments on the account by Sherif Agha in the Official reports ... # 3).It seems that the idea to resort to diplomatic sources for the clarification of dates first came up in Rosen’s correspondence with his British colleague. It is Browne’s suggestion made in the above letter that appears to have prompted Rosen’s request to the Russian consulate in Adrianople which resulted in a series of reports com-piled by Russian diplomats there (see Rosen’s questions on the clarification of dates raised before the Russian Consulate in Adrianople). However, these reports notwithstanding their value in many respects, did not settle the issue completely. The correct chronology of certain events of Baha’i history would have remained a puzzle to Rosen but for Tumanski’s and his Baha’i friend – Mírzá Abu’l-Fazl Gulpáygání’s efforts to cast more light on this subject.

The Tablet is published in the Volume under number 20.‘Vol. 1’ must be a reference to the Persian text of the Traveller’s Narrative, pub-lished by Browne.‘The articles on Súfiism and Bábíism’ are obviously Browne’s chapters of the book Religious Systems of the World: A Contribution to the Study of Comparative Religion (Browne 1889a). The book was first published in 1889 and published again in 1901. The article on Babiism is on pp. 333–53 of the book. The IOM library still has an excerpt of the book containing only these two chapters (one on Sufism and the other on Babiism) by Browne. It is highly likely that this unique excerpt is the author’s gift mentioned in the letter. As the reader will find out later, Browne used for his work on the Persian Bayán of the Báb both manuscripts from what is today the IOM collection, which he collated with the other transcripts of the Bayán in his possession.

I have found a new M.S. of the Persian Beyán, as I believe, the original of the 125 translated by Gobineau; and, most interesting still, as I think, a book that would appear to be the original from which the compilers of the جديد تاريخ126 got most of their circumstantial narratives. Of course in the five or six days during which I worked at the Bibliotheque Nationale I could take rapid and brief notes & extracts of the MSS., but I mean to go back to them. I should like to write a brief account of them either for the English or the French [P. 7/a] Asiatic Journal, / but I am not sure what is the etiquette about MSS. in foreign libraries. However, I shall write and ask M. Barbier de Mrynard, M. Scheper, or M. Zotenberg, and see if there is any objection. I feel that, if “Babology” is to progress, it is very desirable to ascertain clearly what MSS. exist in Europe, and what works they represent .../ [P. 7/B]... What you tell me about M. Gamazof inspires me with the highest admiration for his enterprise and disinterested love of science. How I wish we had such a publication in England!I safely received the proof-sheets of the الملوک سورة127 & etc which are being printed by the Academy of Sciences, and also the Zapiski (vol. vi, 1–4), for which very many thanks. I have not yet had time to examine them carefully ...How I wish I could read Russian; unfortunately I cannot, so that the Rus-sian part of the Zapiski is a sealed book to me. I must try and learn some when I [P. 8/a] get a little time, but a brief examination / of Russian grammar which I once indulged in led me to the conclusion that it is a very difficult language.Comments:The ‘Book of Precepts (Livre des Préceptes)’ or the Arabic Bayán of the Báb was published by Compte de Gobineau in his French translation in the Appen-dix within his work: Les religions et les philosophies dans l’Asie centrale, pp. 396–474 (see also Browne’s letters # 2, 7 and comments).M. Barbier de Mrynard was an Orientalist working at the French Mission in Tehran together with Gobineau. The former wrote a review on the latter’s book (de Mrynard 1899).

Browne’s correspondence with Rosen 169The above passage of the letter shows that Browne viewed keeping record of the existing Babi (and possibly Baha’i) manuscripts in Europe as one of the priorities of his studies.Let us now continue with the letter:As to the 22nd & 23rd letters in the proofs, I think that by نبيل قبل على128 the Báb – Mírzá ‘Alí Muhammad – is meant, not ندی زر (؟) اخرين نبيل,129 as the author of the Hasht Bihisht calls the poet. The Báb not infrequently seems to call himself –نبيل قبل على“‘Alí before Nabíl”, i.e. ‘Alí before Muhammad or ‘Alí Muhammad, as, for example, in the document published by me at pp. 996–7 of my second paper on the Bábís in the J.R.A.S.نبيل (ن = 50 + ب = 2 + ی = 10 + ل + 30: total = 92) in a mere substitution for محمّد (م = 40 + ح = 8 + م = 40 + د = 4: total = 92),Such as the Bábís are so fond of – e.g. سرّ ارض = ادرنه:130 (260) شديد = چهريق131(318) /[P. 8/b] Besides, seeing that Nabíl soon (as it would appear) withdrew his claim, and now lives at Acre, a humble disciple of Behá, he must, I should think, have recalled and cancelled any “revelations” which he may have writ-ten. And also he could have no followers after withdrawing his claim, and no follower of Behá’s, I should think, would insert writings by a rival claimant in a collection of Behá’s works. You see I avail myself of one of your own weapons, whereby you disapproved my no longer tenable hypothesis that the سورةالملوک132 might be by Subh-i-Ezel! So if I am right here you must say, like Násir-i-Khusraw’s eagle –133[P. 9/a] ... I cannot utilize your valuable list of chapters in your MS. of سورة يوسف134 in this number. But if you will allow me I will insert it in my catalogue of my MSS. (to appear in July, I hope)...The finding of the phrase اﷲ بقيّة يا135 did, I confess, rejoice me much. I sat down one morning with the الاسماء قيّوم136 determined to find it if possible, though I felt it was rather like “looking for a needle in a bundle of hay”!Comments:As for the Epistles Nos 22 and 23 in the Volume of the Epistles by Bahá’u’lláh, they are untitled. No. 22 begins as follows: :جبلزا هك ملان هك زا تسام هك رب تسام أهك زا تسام هك"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"170 Part VII No. 23 starts with the words:. Both belong to the first 29 Epistles in Arabic of the given Volume published from the manuscript in the collection of the IOM.Browne speaks of the word ‘Nabíl’ being an equivalent of the name ‘Muhammad’ (the numerical number of both is 92) according to the abjad notation in the Babis of Persia (Browne 1889b: 997), while in a footnote to ‘Mírzá Jawád’s Histori-cal Epitome’ he gives the same explanation as in the above passage of the letter concerning the words Sirr (Mystery) and Edirne (Adrianople) having the same numerical value: 260 (Browne 1918: 19, footnote 1).For Nabíl Zarandí (Nabíl-i-A‘zam), see Tumanski’s letter # 4 and comments.Browne apologizes in the letter for not utilizing Rosen’s list of chapters of the Báb’s Commentary on the Súrih of Josef (Súriy-i-Yúsuf) also known as the Qayyumu’l-Asmá’ in ‘Some Remarks on the Babi Texts edited by Baron Rosen’ (Browne 1892b). The latter is implied by the article ‘in this number’ of the JRAS. The catalogue which was due to come out in July is a reference to Browne’s ‘Cata-logue and Description of the 27 Babi Manuscripts’ (Browne 1892a).‘O Remnant of God’ is an expression found in the Báb’s Commentary on the Súrih of Josef and quoted in other writings. See Browne 1891, 2: 3.He continues in the same letter:Many thanks for the fullest particulars you give me about the Russian Con-sular dispatch from Adrianople. Is the Consul still living? If so, might he not perhaps be able from his own reminiscences to throw some light on the [P. 9/b] situation of the Bábís / at Adrianople, and especially the final rupture between Behá and Subh-i-Ezel? I confess that this part of the history of the Sect has a great and preeminent interest for me, and it is precisely the part which, owing to the interests involved, it is most difficult to fathom. I fancy Baghdad and Adrianople would furnish much light if one knew how to seek for it.It would be very interesting if the سورةالملوک137 could be identical with Behá’s protest written from Gallipoli, as you suggest. It seems at least a very likely hypothesis. As to the copies of my Traveller’s Narrative which M. Toumanski says the Bábís at Ashkabad wish to buy, I need not say that it would be likely to encour-age the University Press very much in the publication of other / such [P. 10/a] works if so large a number were sold all at once. I have written to them to tell them about it and to ask them to give me an estimate of the cost and weight of – (a) 50 copies of the English(b) 100 copies of the Persian bound in cloth like your copy.(c) 100 copies of the Persian in a special paper cover to diminish the weight يأ ان المبحان الكافى الباقى هو اش امةالغصن هذا عن اش نداء المعى. هو العزيز العالى الرفيع اسمع نداء وتلق ثم اعمل بما تزهرالغصن هذا عن اش نداء المعىالغصن هذا عن اش نداء المعى"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"From E. G. Browne’s correspondence with Rosen 171Comments:It is obvious from the above passage that Baron Rosen shared with Browne his information obtained from Russian diplomatic sources (see ‘Reports from Adri-anople on the Babis staying there’ – Official reports ... # 3) as it is quite likely that some of the questions raised by Rosen before the Mission in Adrianople were suggested by the British Orientalist. It is also worth noting that Russian scholars (Rosen, Tumanski) as well as diplomats did not share Browne’s profound interest in what he called the ‘schism’ or ‘rupture between Bahá[‘u’lláh] and Subh-i-Ezel’ or probably they saw more than a mere ‘schism’ or ‘rupture’ in it. Therefore it is not quite surprising that very little light if ever was cast on this issue in the diplo-matic reports sent in response to Rosen’s questions.As for Rosen’s hypothesis, supported by Browne, that the Súriy-i-Mulúk could be identical with ‘Bahá’u’lláh’s protest written in Gallipoli’ (see ‘Free translation of the Babi Shaykh’s petition from German’), this suggestion would not appear very probable even if we were to assume the existence of some real document of which the mentioned ‘protest’ might be a very inapt paraphrase. Not only do the content of the Súriy-i-Mulúk and that of the ‘protest’ have very little in common but also their dates do not match. The ‘protest’ was dated 9 August 1868, while the Súriy-i-Mulúk was revealed much earlier as Browne rightly suggests in one of his works: ‘The Súratu’l-Mulúk would therefore seem to have been written about the beginning of the Adrianople period’ (Browne 1892b: 281).For the Baha’is of Ashkabad wishing to buy copies of the Traveller’s Narrative published by Browne, see Tumanski’s letter # 1.Let us now return to Browne’s letter. In the passage below, the British Oriental-ist makes very interesting confessions which among other things cast some light on his doubts and personal preferences.... The only difficulty I see is, will the books be allowed to pass through Russia without difficulty? I understand that there are difficulties in the trans-mission of books through Russian territory. They would, I suppose, be most cheaply sent by steamer to Odessa or Batoumi, thence rail to Bákú, steamer to آطه اوزون,138 and rail to Ashkabad .../[P. 10/b] I am less anxious for the English volumes to go than the Per-sian, firstly because I doubt if they would meet the approval of any Bábí (the Behá’ìs would not like Note W), and secondly because I very much doubt whether there are 50 Bábís or even Persians sympathizing with Bábís who know English, and I do not see what use they would have for so many cop-ies. Indeed my feelings about the Traveller’s Narrative are curiously mixed: I sympathize profoundly with the Bábís as a whole, but hardly know what to think as between Behá and Subh-i-Ezel. My book would certainly please neither: the former would by no means approve of the English, the latter would never forgive me for editing Persian.

I wrote about all that to Al. Grig. Tumanski, and this is what he wrote to me on this subject 8 Sept. 1892:] V[iktor] R[osen].[Tumanski’s reply]:... I have delayed my reply a little. The reason for this [delay] was my wait-ing for the arrival of the Babis, who had gone to Akka (زوّار)144 and had been there during the passing of Bahá[‘u’lláh]. Five of them had gone there, namely: (1) افنان الحسن ابو ميرزا اقا,145 (2) كليمی سليمان اقا,146 (3) شيرازی جعفر ميرزا,147 (4) بصّار باقر ميرزا,148 (5) رشتی عسکر اقا.149 They arrived at Akka five days before the passing of حضرت150 and stayed the whole time there. According to them, there has been no discord between the Aghsán (i.e. Bahá’u’lláh’s sons) nor could there be any discord, for the order of the succession to the عرش is firmly set in both the اقدس كتاب151 and in the Will and Testament. The first days fol-lowing Bahá’u’lláh’s death all the Babis held fast to the ordinances of the اقدس كتاب and finally on the ninth day gathered in the قصر152 where ‘Abbás Effendi unsealed in their presence the envelope, sealed with Bahá’u’lláh’s seal, pulling out of it the عهدی كتاب,153 and handed it to Bahá’u’lláh’s nephew, Majdu’d-Dín, to read it الالحان باحسن.154 In addition, the Babis use the family upbringing and the existing relations between its members as a proof that no discord would be possible [among them]. Muhammad-‘Alí was in full har-mony with the rest of the family members during the whole time they were in Akka.

I found out that a copy of the epistle ‘Glad tidings’ was also sent to Browne from Akka and that it contains 15 glad tidings instead of 14. This circum-stance led me to ask E. G. Browne to kindly share with me the variants (points of difference) of his copy – a request which my English colleague, just as had been anticipated, granted with much willingness. (ibid., 311–312, translation mine) Rosen gave in the article the whole list of variants sent him by Browne with a particular emphasis on the ‘additions’ in Browne’s copy and missing in his. One of such additions is the fifteenth glad tiding which deals with a constitutional mon-archy. This part is quoted by Rosen in full in the original Persian from Browne’s letter and in Rosen’s Russian translation.As for the Will and Testament (Covenant) of Bahá’u’lláh mentioned in the letter, see Tumanski’s letter # 2 and comments.Browne relates to Rosen that he was acquainted with poet ‘Andalíb (‘Alí Ashraf Láhijání, also known as ‘Fázil’ and ‘Nabíl-i-Akbar’), whom he describes as ‘a most enthusiastic Behá’i’.

The quoted expression which, according to Browne, ‘is interjected by the Ezelis in so sinister a manner’ is from the Tablet of Wisdom, addressed to Nabíl-i-Akbar (see p. 41). In the published Volume it is on p. 95 (No. 20). Browne’s casual remark in the letter about it does not allow the reader to understand what exactly he implies by ‘its being interjected.’The whole long passage which contains the quoted phrase: ‘He is powerful over every single thing ...’ in the fourteenth glad tiding in Rosen’s publication is not part of the authoritative text of the given Writing of Bahá’u’lláh."},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"From E.

Second, the British Orientalist who regarded every case of a passage being absent from a transcript as ‘suppression’ would be surprised to find out that it is exactly his copy of the given Chronicle in which an account of how Bahá’u’lláh took upon himself the flogging intended for his half-brother Mírzá Yahyá in Amul was sup-pressed.

It appears that this account did not dispel Browne’s doubts com-pletely, for he wrote: One point, however, I must again briefly allude to: I mean the share in the work here ascribed to Seyyid Jawád of Kerbelá. In my Catalogue and Description of 27 Babi MSS181... I expressed a doubt as to the correctness of this portion of Mírzá Abu’l-Fazl’s statement, my grounds for this doubt being the ascription to Seyyid Jawád of the Hasht Bihisht, a controversial work of strongly-marked Ezelí proclivities, and assurances given to me by Subh-i-Ezel to the effect that Seyyid Jawád was one of his staunchest adherents ... Both the Ezelís and the Behá’ís claim him; and I think, we have not yet suf-ficient evidence to enable us to decide between them ... (Browne 1893: xlii–xliii)Tumanski viewed the matter in a completely different light. He wrote in his article: Generally speaking I feel necessary to add that a great number of Babis in Ashkabad knew Hájí Siyyid Javád personally. There is even a photo which shows him with Hájí Muhammad-Taqí who is presently in jail in Tehran. I do not know what relation Siyyid Javád may have had to Azal’s adherents in general and to the composition of the ‘Hasht Bihisht’ in particular, but I will try to clarify whatever I can.

(Tumanski 1894: 43, translation mine) Probably, it was this assurance given by Tumanski that led Browne to give up his former view, for it appears from his above letter that he was ready to reconsider his earlier opinion (see also Tumanski’s letter # 1).35.Deposit: 777/inventory: 2/unit: 45[from a letter dated 26 July 1893][Stamp:] Pembroke College,CambridgeJuly 26, 1893[P. 16/b] ...

In 1930, he became the first director of the Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences founded in Leningrad on the basis of the former ‘Asiatic Museum.’The issues raised in the letter are a puzzle. The context does not allow the reader to understand whether Rosen’s remark about the infallibility of the prophets was made privately (in a letter which is the most likely possibility) or in a published work.

He was not alone in his prognosis concerning the Babi Faith (by which at that time the Baha’i Faith was implied) being the future religion of Persia. A similar view, though less categori-cally stated, was expressed by Batyushkov in his book: As for the future of Babiism it is quite hard to make predictions in this respect; at any rate its spread would undoubtedly be of great benefit to Persia ... Maybe in the near future some Shah will become convinced of the merits of this teaching, proclaiming it the dominant [Faith], and the Persian people, exceedingly gifted as they are, with a renewed spirit and a renewed strength will revive the glorious past of their poetry and literature which for some unclear reason is considered irreparably lost.

Bertels’ who was a prominent Russian and later Soviet Orientalist specializing in Iranian studies. He wrote in his article (critical review): ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, being fully aware of the need for the teaching to be further developed so that it might preserve its vitality, symbolized the progressive trend. On the contrary, Muhammad-‘Alí was inclined towards conservatism; he held on to the literal meaning of his father’s words. Unless this conserva-tism were considered as an ostensible means of maintaining [him in the posi-tion of] authority, his disrespectful attitude towards the Will and Testament of his father would seem absolutely inexplicable. However, like Subh-i-Azal he did not receive support in the wider circles and therefore has no significance for the history of Behaism. (Bertels 1925: 204, here and below translation mine) In another passage Bertels says:The issue of this schism gave rise to abundant literature both in the East and in the West, especially among the Baha’is in America, where the number of followers of this teaching has recently grown considerably. However, the great majority of these books are completely unknown to the wider public in Europe, therefore it is a pity that one of the best experts on Behaism, the English prof[essor] E. Browne, has published a polemical treatise by a fol-lower of Muhammad-‘Alí named Mírzá Javád Qazvíní in his book, which came out in 1918 under the title: Materials for the Study of the Babi Religion. Of course impartiality requires that the scholar should listen to both parties, but the publication of a pamphlet of the party which is obviously wrong with-out documents speaking in favor of its opponents would create an extremely unfavorable prejudice against the right party.

It is erroneously described in the Archive record as ‘being copied by Abu’l-Fazl Gulpáygání’ (see below). The manuscript consists of 19 pages; the page numbers are completely confused. The History presents the author’s eyewitness account of the assassination by Shi‘ih fanatics of a venerable Baha’i – Hájí Muhammad-Rizá Isfahání, which occurred in Ashkabad in 1889 and the execution of justice with respect to the murderers by the Russian authorities (see also comments on Ignatyev’s letter # 3). A brief account of this event can be found in Tumanski’s and Rosen’s publications (Tumanski 1892: 316–7; Collections Scientifiques ... 1891, VI: 247–8) and in Baha’i sources (Effendi 1995: 202–3, Cameron and Momen 1996: 117–8).

R. Rosen’s extremely rich collection of archival materials on the Babi and Baha’i Faiths from the St Petersburg Branch of the Archive of the Russian Academy of Sciences is a pre-cious source for research in the given fi eld, which considerably broadens the scope of studies on this subject. These materials being closely related to the published works by V. R. Rosen, A. G. Tumanski, G. Batyushkov, and E. G. Browne cast more light on many issues covered in those publications. At the same time, they are also very illuminating with respect to the Babi and especially Baha’i studies undertaken by European scholars in the second half of the nineteenth century – the century which witnessed the birth and development of the new religion during the fi rst decades of its existence. These materials demonstrate that there emerged a group of scholars in Europe at the time, who, driven by the same purpose – collect-ing information about the new phenomenon based on primary sources, fi rst-hand reports and accounts as well as on their own experience of communication with adherents of the new religion – combined their efforts in their research, widely and willingly sharing the materials and information they obtained. They might be right or wrong in their assumptions, judgments, and conclusions, but since they were defi nitely honest in their approach they tried to stay unbiased towards the subject, setting a good pattern for the future generations of scholars. However, large parts of this priceless archival collection have so far remained unexplored. Some of its items, such as manuscripts of Bahá’u’lláh’s Writings and Abu’l-Fazl Gulpáygání’s autograph of the History of Hájí Muhammad-Rizá Isfahání, have a special value of their own. It has been my intention in this book to introduce these materials to the reader as an integrated whole, bound by a single thematic framework. Hopefully, the Babi and Baha’i studies explored here will be useful to scholars and those interested in the subject."},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"Figure 1.1 Article by Tumanski in the newspaper Kavkaz (beginning)Figure 1.2 Article by Tumanski in the newspaper Kavkaz (end)"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"Figure 2 The opening page of Abu’l-Fazl Gulpáygání’s transcript of the History of Hájí Muhammad-Rizá"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"Figure 3.1 Transcript of Bahá’u’lláh’s Lawh-i-Sámsún, p.1"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"Figure 3.2 Transcript of Bahá’u’lláh’s Lawh-i-Sámsún, p.2"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"Figure 3.3 Transcript of Bahá’u’lláh’s Lawh-i-Sámsún, p.3"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"Figure 3.4 Transcript of Bahá’u’lláh’s Lawh-i-Sámsún, p.4"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"Figure 4.1 Browne’s letter dated 6 May 1890, p.7 front"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"Figure 4.2 Browne’s letter dated 6 May 1890, p.7 back"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"Figure 4.3 Browne’s letter dated 6 May 1890, p.8 front"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"Figure 4.4 Browne’s letter dated 6 May 1890, p.8 back"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"Figure 5 Baron Rosen’s grave site in the Novodevichye Cemetery in St Petersburg, Russia (Summer of 2011)"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"ReferencesPublications in Western languagesBahá’u’lláh (1976) Gleanings from the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh, Wilmette, IL: Bahá’í Pub-lishing Trust.
