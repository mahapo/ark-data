I wish to acknowledge my debt of gratitude to a number of people who have helped and inspired me during more than fifteen years of study in India and in Oxford, where I had the privilege of working for my doctorate. One of the first who comes to mind is Mr. G. S. Sanderson, whom 1 consider not only a fine scholar but also a friend. I would also like to express my gratitude to Professor R.

Tripathi, head of the Research Department of the same university, has also helped me a great deal, not so much in the field of Tantric studies, but in Sanskrit grammar. His profound knowledge of Panini and the Sanskrit language has inspired me to take delight in the Sanskrit itself, not just as a tool to read texts but as a language to speak and write for its own sake. 1 should acknowledge the many suggestions made by Dr. Goudriaan, who is at present at the University of Utrecht, and Dr. N.

This vast area of study, so badly neglected in the past, is now slowly beginning to come into its own. The new interest, accompanied by a greater (although still very limited) knowledge of the Tantras, has led to a more critical and scholarly approach to the study of these sacred texts. Although scholars in the past were aware that important internal distinctions exist in the 'Tantric tradition',1 they were largely glossed over in an attempt to penetrate the 'philosophy of the Tantras',2 or the 'principles of Tantra'.3 Important exceptions on the Saiva side (we are not concerned here with Vai$nava Tantra) have been the studies and critical editions made in recent years of the Siddhantagamas. This important work must be largely credited to the French Institute of Indology at Pondicherry and in particular to Pt. N. R. Bhatt and Dr. Helene Brunner-Lachaux, who has contributed to it immensely by her extensive work on Siddhanta ritual.4 Another area of research has been the Srividya tradition. Many of the major Tantras and allied works of this school have been edited and independent studies published. However, apart from these two major fields, hardly any other work has been done on individual Tantric traditions. The aim of this monograph is to pursue this line of approach further by presenting a preliminary study of another Hindu Tantric tradition, namely, the cult of Kubjika, the details of which are recorded in the Tantras of the Western School: the Pascimamnaya. The Pascimamnaya belongs to a category of Saivagama variously called ' Kulagama', 'Kulasastra''or 'Kulamnaya', which we shall attempt to delineate in the second part of this monograph. Although not as extensive as the Siddhanta or as well known and diffused as the Srividya, the Pascimamnaya is an important and substantial Tantric tradition. Up to now very little work has been done on the Pascimamnaya (see appendix A). Hardly any texts of this school have been edited, although about a"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"4   THE SAIVA AGAMAS hundred independent works., some of considerable length, are preserved in manuscripts, almost all of which are in Nepal (see appendix D). At this preliminary stage of research we would do well, first of all, to locate this sacred literature in the vast corpus of the Saivagama. Such is the aim of this monograph. Thus, although we shall deal with the Tantras and cult of Kubjika, we are here primarily concerned only with the contents of these Tantras that can help us to locate them in the Saiva canon and construct their history. We are acutely aware that we are considerably handicapped in this task not only by our limited knowledge of the Pascimamnaya but also by our scant understanding of the structure of the Saiva canon. Even so, we feel that, however provisional it may turn out to be, at least an attempt should be made to plot, even if in the most general terms, the extent and divisions of the Saivagama. Forced as we are at present to work largely with sources in manuscript (many of which are corrupt), and given the vast amount of material that has yet to be studied and the even greater amount that has been lost, our endeavor is audacious, perhaps foolhardy. Even so. we shall be amply rewarded if this work leads to new insights into possible future avenues of research not only in the Kubjika Tantras but, more generally, into the Saiva canon. The Saivagamas The earliest known references to sectarian Saivism are found in Patanjali's Great Commentary (Mahabhasva) on Panini's grammar probably written in the second century B.C.. Patanjali refers to the Sivabhagavats which he describes as itinerent ascetics who wore animal skins and carried an iron lance.5 The Saiva symbols found on the coins of the Greek, Saka and Parthian kings, who ruled in Northern India between the second century B.C. and the first century A.D., confirm that Siva was already well established during this period as a sectarian god.6 Unfortu­nately, however, no sacred texts of any pre-Agamic Saiva sect have been preserved. Possibly none were written during this early period. It is not unlikely that when Saivism developed into a popular movement it relied at first on the Vedas and related literature along with the developing Epic and Puranic traditions as sounding boards for their sectarian views. We might also justifiably speculate that there must have existed numerous oral traditions that ultimately contributed to the development of a corpus of sacred Saiva literature the Saivagamas that considered itself to be independent of the authority of the Vedas and had nothing to do with the Epics or Puranas."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"The Saivagamas  5  Although it is not possible to say exactly when the first Agamas were written, there is no concrete evidence to suggest that any existed much before the sixth century. The earliest reference to Tantric manuscripts cannot be dated before the first half of the seventh century. It occurs in Bana's Sanskrit novel, Kadambari in which the author describes a Saiva ascetic from South India who \"had made a collection of manuscripts of jugglery, Tantras and Mantras [which were written] in letters of red lac on palm leaves [tinged with] smoke.\" Bana also says that \"he had written down the doctrine of Mahakala, which is the ancient teaching of the Mahapasupatas,\"7 thus confirming that oral traditions were in fact being committed to writing. If our dates are correct, it seems that the Saivagamas proliferated to an astonishing degree at an extremely rapid rate so that by the time we reach Abhinavagupta and his immediate predecessors who lived in ninth-century Kashmir we discover in their works references drawn from a vast corpus of Saivagamic literature. It is this corpus which constituted the source and substance of the Saivism of Kashmir, which Kashmiri Saivites, both monists and dualists, commented on, systematized and extended in their writings and oral transmissions. The dualist Siddhantins, supported by the authority of the Siddhamagamas, initiated this process by developing the philosophical theology of the Siddhanta. Subsequently, from about the middle of the ninth century, parallel developments took place in monistic Saivism which drew inspiration largely, but not exclusively, from the Bhairava and other Agamic groups which constituted the remaining part of the Saiva corpus. It was to this part of the Saivagama that the sacred texts of the Pascimamnaya belonged. These Tantras, unlike those of the Siddhanta, advocated in places extreme forms of Tantricism that actively enjoined such practices as the consumption of meat and wine as well as sex in the course of their rituals. Agamic Saivites who accepted these practices as valid forms of worship constituted a notable feature of religious life throughout India. Although many of these Saivites were householders, the mainstays of these traditions were largely single ascetics, many of whom travelled widely and in so doing spread their cults from one part of India to another. An interesting example of this phenomenon is Trika, nowadays virtually identified with monistic Kashmiri Saivism. Abhinavagupta, who was largely responsible for developing Trika Saivism into the elevated, sophisticated form in which we find it in his works, was initiated into Trika by Sambhunatha, who came to Kashmir from neighbouring Jalandhara. Sumati, his teacher and an itinerent ascetic like himself, was said to have travelled to the North of India from some \"sacred place in the South.\"8"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"6 THE SAIVA AGAMAS The Jain Somadeva confirms that Trika was known in South India during the tenth century. Somadeva identifies the followers of the Trikamata as Kaulas who worship Siva in the company of their Tantric consorts by offering him meat and wine.9 It is worth noting incidently that Somadeva was very critical of the Trika Kaulas. \"If liberation,\" he says, \"were the result of a loose, undisciplined life, then thugs and butchers would surely sooner attain to it than these Kaulas!\"10 Although Somadeva was a Jaina monk and so would naturally disapprove of such practices and tend to take extreme views, it appears nonetheless that Trika was not always as elevated as it now seems to us to be. Although the Pascimamnaya is entirely confined to Nepal at present, it was, according to one of its most important Tantras, the Kubjikamata, spread by the goddess to every corner of India, right up to Kanyakumari in the South, identified, by allusion, with Kubjika the goddess of the Pascimamnaya.'' A long list of initiates into the Pascimamnaya and their places of residence is recorded in the Kubjikanityahnikatilaka, a work written before the twelfth century. It is clear from this list that the cult had spread throughout India although it was certainly more popular in the North.12 That the Pascimamnaya was known in South India in the thirteenth century is proved by references in Mahesvarananda's Maharthamanjari13 to the Kubjikamata14 as well as a work called \"pascimam\"15 which may or may not be the same work but most probably belongs to the same tradition. An old, incomplete manuscript of the Kubjikamata is still preserved in the manuscript library of the University of Kerala in Trivandrum.16 Despite relatively early references to the existence of Agamic Saivism in the South, it seems that the Saivagamas originally flourished in northern India, spreading to the South only later. Madhyadesa (an area covering eastern Uttar Pradesh and west Bihar) was, according to Abhinavagupta, considered to be the \"repository of all scripture\"17 - hence also of the Saivagama and the KulaSastra.18 The importance of this part of India is indirectly confirmed by the fact that Benares, in the centre of this area, is to be visualized as a sacred place (pitha) located in the heart of the body in the course of the Kaula ritual described in Tantraloka.19 Similarly, Prayaga and Varanasi are projected in the same way onto the centre of the body during the ritual described in the Yoginihrdaya,20 a Kaula Tantra of the original Saivagama. The sacred circle (mandala) shown to the neophyte in the course of his initiation into the cult of the Brahmayamala is to be drawn in a cremation ground with the ashes of a cremated human corpse. In it are worshipped Yaksas, Pisacas and other demonic beings, including Raksasas led by Ravana, who surround Bhairava to whom wine is offered with oblations of beef and human flesh prepared in a funeral pyre. The name of"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"The Saivagamas 7 this circle is the \"Great Cremation Ground\" (mahasmasana) and is to be drawn in Varanasi.21 Siddhesvari is a quarter of Benares named after a goddess worshipped there; she was originally called Siddhayogesvari,22 an important goddess of the Trika. Although the Pascimamnaya was not popular in Kashmir,23 we must first examine the monistic Kashmiri sources to understand something of the development of the Saivagama and the relationship between the different groups which constituted it, including the Kaula group to which the Pascimamnaya belongs. This is because Abhinavagupta's Trika encompassed the entire spectrum of Saiva Agamic cults ranging from these of the Saivasiddhanta and the Siddhanta-type ritual of the Svacchanda cult24 popular in Kashmir, right through to those of the Bhairavatantras and Kulagamas to Trika. There are references to more than five hundred lost works within this range. Many of these Tantras and related works must still have existed in the thirteenth century when Jayaratha commented on the Tantraloka and quoted extensively from these sources. From the manner in which he talks about these Tantras it appears that some at least of the rituals they described continued to be performed in his time.-25 However, outside the Himalayan region matters were different. Thus, although the Siddhanta flourished in the South, we can infer from the numerous references in Mahesvarananda's Mahdrthamanjari, written about this time, that a good number of the primary Tantras familiar to Abhinavagupta were not known in the South. However, the secondary works associated with them (many still scripture in their own right) as well as Kashmiri works of known authors and texts belonging to the Kramanaya had been carefully preserved and even added to. A great deal of this literature has been lost. There is no denying the fact that a relatively sudden interruption of the traditions associated with these texts has taken place: a break has occurred in the development of the Tantras. Within two or three centuries not only had the bulk of the Bhairavatantras and similar Tantric works been lost, but even Abhinava­gupta and the monist Kashmiri authors seem, except in a few isolated cases, to have disappeared. It was only in the beginning of this century that the works of these authors started to be rescued from oblivion when their works began to be edited by Kashmiri scholars employed in a government research centre at Srinagar which published them as the Kashmir Series of Texts and Studies. The study of these texts made scholars aware of the loss of a large and rich corpus of Tantric literature. Indeed, this loss has been so great that all the developments in monistic Tantra after Abhinavagupta, with the important exception of the cult of Srividya, were fresh beginnings which had little direct connection with the older corpus, so much so that the younger scriptures are no longer called \"Saivagamas\" but \"Tantras.\""},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"8 THE SAIVA AGAMAS Thus the term \"Tantra,\" which has anyway a wide range of connotations,26 is used at times to denote a Sakta Tantric scripture to distinguish it from a Saiva Agama, whereas we find both words used in the early corpus without distinction.27 The reason for this loss has certainly much to do with the ethos of Hinduism itself and its history as a whole. The secrecy that these types of Tantras have always imposed on themselves is indicative of the uneasiness which these Tantric cultural elements must have aroused in many.28 Thus the Puranas, which are from many points of view the bastions and guardians of Hindu orthodoxy, initially tended to reject the authority of the Tantras and so largely avoided quoting from them. However, insofar as the Puranas aimed to be complete compendiums of Hindu spirituality and practice, they later included long sections from Tantric sources, especially when dealing with ritual, the building and consecration of temples, yoga and related matters.29 Thus there is much Tantric material to be found everywhere in the Puranas. The Brahmavaivartapurana contains a brilliant theological exposition of the Supreme as the Goddess Nature (Prakrti), which is a theme dear to Tantra in its later phases. The Devi, Devibhagavata, the Kalika and large portions of the Narada Puranas are extensively Tantric. The hymns eulogizing the names of the goddess, accounts of her actions, lists of female attendants of male gods, their Mantras, Yantras and much more show how strong the influence of Tantric ideas was on the Puranas. They also demonstrate that such trends were not only clearly apparent in the history of the development of Tantra but applied to them also. These developments, in other words, concerned the whole of the literate tradition, and so the Puranas could, without difficulty or self-contradiction, incorporate relevant material from the Tantras. These incorporations were drawn from the entire range of Tantric sources available at the time in which they were made. It seems likely, in fact, that a possible way in which we can gain some idea of when these Tantric passages were added to the Puramc text is to establish the type of Tantric source from which they were drawn. No one has yet attempted to apply this method in an extensive or systematic way. However, the validity of this approach finds the support of R. C. Hazra, who in his work does attempt to date some Puranic passages on this basis.10 The Agni and Garuda Puranas, for example, deal extensively with Tantric topics. Their treatment is based largely on the Saivagamas and Pancaratrasamhitas which belong to the early Tantric period, i.e., prior to the tenth century. As an example relevant to the study of the Pascimamnayu, we may cite chapters 143-147 of the Agnipwana where the goddess Kubjika is extolled and the manner in which she is to be worshipped is described.\" As Kubjika"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"The Saivagamas 9 is not worshipped in the way described in the Agnipurana in later Tantric sources, we can conclude that this addition must be relatively early. The changes in the Tantric material found in the Puranas also serve to underscore the fact that many of the early Tantras were lost and their cults superseded by others. Undoubtedly, this is partly due to the effects of the passage of time with its changing fads and interests. Manuscripts in India have a relatively short lifespan; if they are not copied, the texts they transmit soon become obsolete. Through the centuries much has been lost in this way from all the Indian sastras. In the case of the Tantras, particularly the esoteric ones such as those belonging to the Bhairava and Kaula groups, this natural process was reinforced by the custom of disposing of the Tantric text once the teacher had explained its meaning to his disciple.12 Moreover, the regional character of many of these Tantric cults entailed the scarcity of copies of their Tantras. Not infrequently, therefore, the speaker of a Tantra prefaces his instruction with an exhortation to hear the Tantra which is \"very hard to acquire (sudurlabha).\"33 There were, however, other factors at work apart from purely mechanical loss. Let us go back to the Purapas. Although the Puranas drew from Tantric sources, their attitude to the Tantras varied and was at times far from positive. The orthodox community, which the Puranas largely represented, was not always in favour of the Tantras, even though they somehow accepted them. The problem was that the Tantras often set themselves in opposition to the orthodox line. For one thing, the Agamas as a whole rejected the authority of the Vedas. Some Agamic schools took a mere tolerant view, others stuck to a harder line; even so the Agamic tradition as a whole thought of itself as being quite distinct from the Vedic. This was particularly true of the Bhairava and the other classes of Tantras that suffered the greatest loss. Thus the Anandabhairava-tantra declares; The wise man should not elect as his authority the word of the Vedas, which is full of impurity, produces but scanty and transitory fruits and is limited. [He should instead sustain the authority] of the Saiva scriptures. Abhinava remarks: That which according to the Veda is a source of sin, leads, according to this doctrine of the left, directly to liberation. In fact, all the Vedic teaching is dominated by Maya.34 The Puranas basically sustain the authority of the Vedas. Under-"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"10 THE SAIVA AGAMAS standably, they therefore reacted against these scriptures which so explicitly opposed themselves to it. Sometimes these differences were simply ignored; in other cases, however, the Puranas manifested an open hostility towards the Saivagama. The Puranic passages which represented the orthodox standpoint staunchly condemned these scriptures as inferior. They agreed that Siva had revealed them, but his reason for doing so was to delude the apostate and distract him from the true path: they are the scriptures of darkness (tamasi).35 The Kurmapurana is particularly adamant in its opposition to these scriptures and repeatedly stresses that the Vedas are the sole source of right conduct and true religion (dharma).36 The Kurma, which is a Saiva Purana, wants to disassociate itself completely from Agamic Saivism. It displays an almost obsessive concern to condemn the scriptures of the heretical (pasanda) Saivites, namely, those of the Kapalikas, the Bhairava and Varna Tantras, the Yamalas and those of the Pasupatas.37 Similarly in the Varahapurana, Rudra himself denounces the Pasupatas and the other followers of the Saivagamas as given to \"mean and sinful acts\" and as \"addicted to meat, wine and women\".38 Their scriptures are outside the pale of the Vedas (vedabahya) and contrary to them.39 The smarta Sakta Devibhagavata unambiguously declares that Siva made the scriptures of the Vamas, Kapalikas, Kaulas and Bhairavas with the sole intention of deluding them. Even so, it is more tolerant towards these scriptures than the Kurmapurana, and so prescribes that those portions of them that do not go against the Vedas can be accepted without incurring sin.40 These instances are just a few of many examples that clearly demonstrate that a marked tendency existed within Hinduism to reject these scriptures and condemn their followers. It is not surprising, therefore, that these Tantric traditions were at times actively repressed. We read, for example, in hagiographies of Sankara's life of his encounter with the king of the Vidarbhas in eastern Maharashtra who asked Saiikara to suppress the heretical views of the followers of the Bhairavatantras - a request with which he gladly complied.41 King Yasaskara of Kashmir (938-48 A.D.) was concerned to enforce the rules regulating the caste and conditions of life (varnasramadharma) amongst his subjects and was therefore against the Tantric practices of the Saivagamas which had no regard for them. He was so opposed to these practices that he did not hesitate to imprison even the nephew of his foreign minister for attending Tantric gatherings (cakramelaka).42 This resistance within Hinduism to the Agamas was not, however, the direct cause of their loss, although it must have been a crucial attendent factor. The interruption that occurred in the Tantric tradition was catastrophic: it took place suddenly and was totally devastating. We must"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"The Saivagamas   11   therefore seek a cause which was immediate and directly effective. Nor do we have to look far. The eleventh century, which marks the beginning of this change in the Tantric tradition, coincides with a sudden reversal in the course of India's history, namely, the advent of Muslim rule. In the beginning of the eleventh century the brief incursions of Muslim raiders into Indian territories that had been going on for centuries turned, under the lead of Mahamud of Ghazni, into a full-scale invasion. The onslaught of Islam forced Hinduism to retreat, challenging its resistance and stability as a whole. The Muslim scholar, Al-Biruni, who came to India with the invading armies noted that \"the Hindu Sciences have retired far away from those parts of the country conquered by us, and have fled to places which our hand cannot yet reach, to Kashmir, Benares and other places.\"43 Mahamud of Ghazni did not manage to conquer Kashmir, although he plundered the Valley in 1014 A.D. and again attacked it, this time without success, in the following year. But even Kashmir, although outside the Muslim's reach for the time being, felt the intense impact of the Muslim presence in India. Ksemendra, the Kashmiri polymath, describes in his Acts of the Incarnations of Visnu (Dasavataracarita) written in 1066 A.D., the dire conditions that will prevail in the world on the eve of the coming of Kalki, Visnu's last incarnation who was to finally herald the dawn of a new age of freedom. He says: The Dards, Turks. Afghans and Sakas will cause the earth to wither as do the leper his open, oozing sores. Every quarter overrun by the heathen (mleccha), the earth will resound with the sound of swords drawn in combat and her soil will be drenched with blood.44 The following centuries, during which the Muslims consolidated and extended their rule, witnessed the disappearance of Agamic Saivism in the north of India. The Agamic Siddhanta survived these upheavals by fleeing to the South where the Muslim presence was not as powerful as in the North. Dunuwila writes: After the twelfth century the Siddhanta seems to have been losing popularity over most of India, giving way to more syncretic forms of Hinduism. The Siddhantins also seem to have lost their posts as Royal Preceptors with the downfall of the dynasties that patronized them, as did the Kalacuris in the early thirteenth century. What remained of the Siddhanta was apparently annihilated by the ever-increasing Muslim incursions into Central India from the more northern regions of the country already under Muslim dominion. The Hindu will to resist the Islamic invaders, never very firm, was demoralized by Prthviraja Ill's"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"12 THE SAIVA AGAMAS defeat at Tarian in 1192. Malwa, the Siddhanta's homeland, was raided by the Mamluk Delhi Sultan lltutmish in 1234-35, by his successor Balban in 1250, and by the Khalji Sultan Jalaluddin in 1292. The Muslims finally triumphed in 1305, when Alauddin Khalji overran Malwa, destroying, among other places, the sacred city of Ujjayini and Bhoja's capital Dhara. The Siddhanta had to take refuge in the Tamil country to survive.45 The Tantras of the Pascimamnaya composed during this period are intensely aware of the harmful consequences of these developments. According to the Manthdnabhairavatantra, the demon Ravana incarnated in this Age of Darkness (Kaliyuga) and descended onto the bank of the Indus, thus initiating the tyranny of the heathens' rule that extended its sway throughout the world.46 Another Tantra of the Kubjika school describes the dreadful state which prevails in the Age of Darkness as one in which the lower classes are oppressed by the proud Hindu aristocracy even though it has been defeated in battle and so must, presumably, accept foreign domination.47 Just as the Siddhanta found refuge in the South, the cult of Kubjika was similarly protected by the patronage of the Nepalese who eagerly adopted it as their own. Thus, it has survived to this day along with the huge royal libraries and many private collections large and small where virtually all that remains of the early Agamic sources in North India is preserved. It was not until the late thirteenth century that Kashmir finally succumbed to the Muslim invader and so we find, as we have already noted, that the Agamas existed intact in the twelfth century when Jayaratha wrote his commentary on Abhinava's Tantraloka. However, in Kashmir, which must have been one of the most flourishing centres of Agamic Saivism in India, the powerful internal forces within the monistic Agamic traditions that led to the further development of monistic Saivism in the hands of Kashmiri Saiva theologians and exegetes, also helped to render obsolete the Agamas, which were their original sources and foundation. The Kaula rituals which were controversial gradually ceased to be performed, giving way to tamer and milder cults, such as that of Svacchandabhairava, while the deeper philosophical, psychological and mystical insights behind the symbolic actions of the Kaula ritual were transferred entirely into the realms of philosophy and a mysticism of graded inner experiences. Thus the original scriptures, which were concerned with ritual, ceased to serve a purpose and all that remained was their philosophical and mystical exegesis. In Nepal on the other hand, where these sorts of developments did not take place, the Nepalese abandoned themselves to the opposite extreme - a formal ritualism which,"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Major and Secondary Divisions 13 though charged with meaning, had lost all significance for them beyond the ritual act itself. Thus the Nepalese, unlike the Kashmiris, did preserve the original Tantras they made use of in their rituals, but largely failed to see anything beyond their immediate content. But apart from these extrinsic factors, a highly significant intrinsic factor contributed to the loss of these scriptures, namely, the internal development of the Saivagama itself. The Saivagamas, even those most Saiva-oriented, accommodated within themselves the concept of Sakti.48 This trend developed within some of the Saivagamas towards such a female-oriented view that at a certain stage, they simply ceased to be Saiva. The Saktatantras took over and, permeated with the earlier Kaula doctrine and ritual forms, preserved, along with those Tantras which continued to consider themselves to be Kaula (although not directly connected to their predecessors), the presence of this antinomian element within Hinduism. The old was transformed into something new, which replaced what had gone before so completely that all that remained was a dim memory of a glorious past in the form of the names of the ancient Agamas now given to new works.49 The most hardy survivor of these far-reaching changes was the mild Kaula cult of Srividya. The Pascimamnaya is another Kaula cult that has managed to survive almost to the present day, although only within the narrow confines of Nepal. Saivagama - Its Major and Secondary Divisions At the outset of our exposition of the extent and divisions of the Saivagamic canon, with a view to ultimately determining the place of the Pascimamnaya within it, it is important to note that although each Agama does identify itself as a member of a cognate group, it is, ideally, complete in itself.50 Indeed, the standard pattern in many large Agamas of every type is the exposition of the essentials for a complete cult. These include the rites of initiation along with other occasional and obligatory rituals as well as the rules of conduct to be observed together with some theoretical considerations about the nature of reality and other matters. Many of the large temple complexes in South India, both Saiva and Vaisnava, affiliate themselves to one or other Vaisnavasamhita or Saivagama on the basis of which (in theory at least) they were built and worship in them is conducted. Abhinavagupta frequently refers to a Tantra as a teaching (sasana) in its own right. Again, although he accepted all Saiva scripture as authoritative to a degree, the Siddhayogesvarimata, (A)namakatantra and Malini-"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"14 THE SAIVA AGAMAS vijayottara were singled out as the ultimate authorities for the Trika Tantricism he sponsored. He also sustained the Siddhayogesvarimata's claim to being the most important of all the scriptures. The primary textual tradition orders itself into canonical corpuses of sacred literature, which reflect upon themselves as belonging to a single group and so strive to concretely supplement and extend each other within the parameters chosen for themselves. We can observe this happening more commonly with primary texts belonging to the early formative period of Tantra. This tendency is more noticeable the more restricted the group becomes. Thus the scriptures of the Pascimamnava, which constitute a subdivision of a much larger category of scriptures, form a relatively coherent group. The rituals of the individual Tantras of the Pascimamnaya do, in fact, share many common details. The basic Mantric system, for example, is fairly uniform in the majority of the Pascima Tantras, and matters which one Tantra deals with cursorily are taken up and elaborated in another. In this way the huge body of primary texts consists of a manifold in which each member is independent although connected, more or less directly, through the mediation of common affiliations variously established, to others. It is not surprising, therefore, if we come across a certain amount of incoherence (not to say, at times, outright contra­diction) even between texts belonging to the same group. Indeed, one of the functions of the Tantric master in the ordering and development of the Tantric tradition is to sort out these textual problems. Thus Abhinava-gupta explains in his Tantraloka that the Tantric master who teaches his disciples the meaning of the scriptures must, if necessary, proceed through them as a frog does, leaping from place to place within them. He must have an eye for every detail and observe it in its broader context, viewing the text as a whole, as does the lion strolling through the jungle who looks in all directions as he walks. Paraphrasing the Devyayamala, Abhinava says: The master should explain the statements [of the Tantra, demonstrating and] corroborating their consistency by means of their interconnection and apply this principle to the various sections of the text, its chapters, sentences, words and root meaning (suira). He should ensure that the preceding and subsequent sections of the scripture do not appear to contradict each other and so apply, as required, the principles [that one must move from one section to the next] as a frog leaps [omitting what is irrelevant], or as the lion who looks around [in all directions as he walks]. In this way he should coalesce the meaning of the scripture into a single coherent expression unconfounded with other teachings. Knowing well the meaning of each phrase as he expounds it, he avails himself of sound associations (tantra), repetition (avartana)."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Major and Secondary Divisions 15 exclusion (badha), extensive application (prasanga) and reason (tarka), etc., taking care to distinguish one topic from another.51 The manner in which Saivism developed in these early primary texts is analogous to the development of Hinduism as a whole: subsequent developments are viewed as being culminations of what has gone before in such a way that what is new appears not only as superior, but also incorporates all that has happened in the past. In this manner new scriptures can maintain their canonicity within (in this case, an amazingly rapidly) expanding corpus that encompasses what is old in a new system of classification in which the newcomers can reckon themselves to be amongst the members of the highest class. We can observe this process happening in the sections of the Agamas dealing with the Agamic canon. These sections are an important part of the text because it is by means of them that the text can validate its own canonicity while at the same time present itself as belonging to a well-defined category of scripture. As new developments take place, these categories are extended, and subdivisions added or redefined. A particular Tantra may assert itself as a major member of a group and so institute new categories to make a place for itself or elevate old ones to a new, higher status. In other words, a text that records the structure of the canon is free to interfere with it. At times, this leads to a major change in the form of the canon. More often however, these changes are minor, indeed, sometimes none need be made if the text can accommodate itself amongst the others as a member of an already established group. Even so, the picture we get of the canon is, at times, perplexingly mutable. Moreover, matters are further complicated by the fact that more than one system of classification usually operates at one time. Thus a given text may fall into a number of classifications operating at different times. A text may understand itself, and the extent, and nature of the group to which it belongs, in different terms than it is understood by another text - particularly if the latter is of a different class. Another factor which adds to the confusion is that some terms of reference to groups are broader than others. If all this were not enough, we also find that seemingly identical paradigms of classification are applied to different groups. In order to understand the overall scheme of the Saivagama, we shall now briefly consider what different texts have had to say about their own location in it, and from that try to form a picture of its extent and parts. We shall begin by seeing what the Saivasiddhanta has had to say. According to the Kamikagama52, spiritual knowledge was originally of two types, superior (para) and inferior (apara), according to the level of"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"16   THE SAIVA AGAMAS intelligence of those fit to comprehend it. Sivajnana, which illumines the nature of Siva, is superior while inferior is that knowledge which, starting from the Veda, illumines the nature of the fettered soul (pasu) and that which binds him (pasa). These two degrees of knowledge are as different from one another as the night vision of a cat and that of a man.53 Saiva scripture encompasses both the superior and inferior degrees of knowledge insofar as Siva is considered to be the ultimate source of both. The higher knowledge is divided into four groups. These are, in descending order of importance: Saiva, Pasupata, Lakula and Somasiddhanta. Each is again divided into three: Right (daksina), Left (vama) and Siddhanta in such a way that the highest is Saivasiddhanta.54 According to a similar classifi­cation found in the Siddhanta manuals of South India, there are two basic categories: Siva and Saiva. These are subdivided as follows:55 Siva -Vamasiva Daksinasiva Misrasiva or Yamalasiva Siddhantasiva Saiva Pasupata Somasiddhanta Lakula Clearly, the basic scheme consisting of four components, namely, Saiva, Pasupata, Lakula and Somasiddhanta, has not changed. All that has happened is that the first of these four has been further analysed. Indeed, this basic scheme recurs frequently in the Siddhantagamas56 where it is generally integrated (as happens in the Kamikagama) into the larger scheme we shall discuss later. It appears to be one of the most basic classifications of the Saivagamic schools and so, possibly, one of the oldest. Let us therefore examine it a little more closely. Important sources for us are the commentaries on Brahmasutra 2/2/37 which states: \"For the Lord there can be no creatorship for that leads to incongruity.\" Commenting on this aphorism, Sankara simply refers to the Mahesvaras as those who worship Siva as the supreme God. Vacaspati Misra (c. 850 A.D.) divides the Mahesvaras into four: Saiva, Pasupata, Kapalika and Karunika Siddhantins.57 Yamunacarya (c. 1050 A.D.), in his Agamapramanya, lists the same basic four as Saivas, Pasupatas, Kapalins and Kaiamukhas.58 Most later commentators follow this classification. Ramanuja in his commentary on the Brahmasutra lists"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Major and Secondary Divisions  17  the same four declaring, mistakenly, that they are Pasupata sects because their followers agree that Pasupati is the instrumental cause of the universe.59 Kesava Kasmirin agrees with this view,60 while Srikantha correctly explains that they are all believers in the Agamas revealed by Siva, rather than just Pasupatas.61 We find the same set of four in the Puranas and other independent sources. Lorenzen has collected a number of references to these groups and lists them in his book. Although Lorenzen's chart is somewhat lengthy, the material it contains is sufficiently relevant to our present discussion for us to quote most of it here.62 See Table 1. Table 1.

Firstly, despite the variant names and entries, they effectively establish the uniformity of this system of classification. Secondly, we can identify the groups generically called \"Saiva\" with the Saivasiddhanta in a restricted sense (as the Naradiya and Siva Puranas seem to do) and, more generally, with the Saivagama as a whole considered independently of the Pasupatas etc.. This conclusion is supported by the distinction made between the 'Siva' and 'Saiva' groups in the South Indian Siddhanta manual we have referred to previously.79 Moreover, the absence of this entry in the lists drawn from the Yogavasistha, Kurma and Linga Puranas apparently"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Pasupatas and Lakulisa 19 coincides with the addition of the Bhairava and Vamatantras, which are major components of the Saivagamic canon. Thirdly, the entry \"Kapalika\" (variants: Kapala, Soma, Saumya and Kankala) appears regularly in almost all the lists and so must be considered to be an independent group. This is true also of the \"Pasupata\" and the \"Lakula\" (variants: Nakula, Vakula, Lanjana, Laguda and Langala). Finally, we notice that \"Kalamukha\" (variants: Kalamukha, Kalanana and Kalasya) sometimes appears to take the place of the Lakulisa Pasupata entry. The Kalamukhas studied Lakulisa's religion (Lakulasamaya)80 and doctrines (Lakulasiddhanta).81 Kalamukha teachers are regularly praised in inscriptions by identifying them with Lakulisa.82 There can be no doubt, therefore, that the Kalamukhas were Lakulisa Pasupatas. Even so, not all Lakulisa Pasupatas were Kalamukhas; it would therefore be wrong to simply identify the two. Let us now turn to a more detailed discussion of these groups individually. We shall deal first with the Pasupata sects, then discuss the Kapalikas, and then finally turn to the Saivagamas and their major divisions. The Pasupatas and Lakulisa The Mahabharata refers to the Pasupata as one of four doctrinal systems (jnana)83 along with the Veda, Samkhya-Yoga and Pancaratra. Although the Puranas not infrequently condemn the Vaisnava Pancaratra as advocating principles contrary to those of the Veda, it is the Pasupatas who are generally considered to be the most subversive. In a myth often retold in the Epics and Puranas, it is Siva, not Visnu, who destroys Daksa's sacrifice in a fit of rage because he was not invited to it along with the other gods. In the Epic, one of the many variants of this important myth portrays this event as symbolic not only of the growing importance of Saivism which seemed, as it developed, to be ousting the older Vedic religion but, more specifically, as an occasion to assert the growing power of the Pasupatas. Thus, when Siva in his terrible form of Rudra has destroyed Daksa's sacrifice, he declares: 1, Rudra, for the first time created the mysterious religion of the Pasupata, beneficent to all, facing in all directions, one that can take years or only ten days to master, one which although censored by the foolish because it is in places opposed to the order of the rules of caste and stages of life (varnasramadharma), is nevertheless appreciated by those of perfected wisdom (gatantu) and is in fact superior to it.84"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"20 THE SAIVA AGAMAS It is not impossible that the reference in the Mahabharata to the four doctrinal systems we have noted above was written at a time when the Saivagamas had not yet begun to be compiled and their cults had not yet developed, that is, when the major representatives of sectarian Saivism were the Pasupatas. It seems likely that these Pasupatas, who considered themselves to be independent of the Vedic-Smarta tradition were, as such, the immediate precursors of Agamic Saivites. Consequently, the latter reserved a place for them amongst their own numerous groups and incorporated the Pasupata into their own canonical categories. We know very little about the oldest Pasupata groups. According to the Mahabharata, Srikantha, the Lord of the Elements (bhutapati) and Uma's husband (umapati), started the Pasupati cult.85 Pathak has tried to establish that Srikantha is a historical figure,86 his views however have been hotly contested and largely rejected. A more\" commonly accepted opinion is that LakuliSa was the original founder of Pasupata Saivism.87 Although scholars generally agree that Lakulisa really existed, not everyone shares the opinion of some scholars that he lived in, or before, the second century.88 There can be no doubt, however, that Lakulisa must have lived before the sixth century because it is from this time onwards that images of him bearing standard iconographic features began to be produced. Anyhow, however early Lakulisa's date may be, it is far from certain that Pasupata Saivism starts with him. Indeed, it is far from certain that we can identify the Sivabhagavats mentioned by Patanjali as pre-Lakulisa Pasupatas, as Banerjee does.89 Nor can we affirm without doubt that they are amongst the ascetic sects mentioned in Pali and other early sources.90 Even so there are good reasons to distinguish between the Lakulisa Pasupata and other Pasupata sects that have nothing to do with Lakulisa. We have seen that the Pasupatas and Lakulisas are invariably distin­guished in the Puranas, Agamas and other sources. Lakulisa had four disciples'. Kusika, Gargya, Kurusa and Maitreya.91 Each of these founded subsects. The ascetics of these orders considered themselves to be Lakulisa Pasupatas belonging to one or other of four lineages (gotra). They were not just Pasupatas. We know also that other Pasupata groups did exist, such as the Vaimalas and Karukas. Although it is not possible to say whether they predate Lakulisa, there are concrete indications that he did have predecessors. Thus a number of Puranas declare that Siva had twenty-eight incarnations, which they list and portray as a lineage of Yoga masters ending with Lakulisa. Dvivedi, who has collated these lists, believes that this tradition records, however imperfectly, the names of early Pasupatas.92 Although we have no means at present of assessing how much, if any,"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Pasupatas and Lakul'isa 21 historical basis there is for these names, there appears at least to have been a tradition which admits the existence of Pasupata teachers prior to Lakulisa. But, whether Lakulisa was the first Pasupata or not, he is without doubt an important founder figure whose contribution was so substantial that he came to represent Pasupata Saivism as a whole. Presumably this is why Abhinavagupta divides Saivism (Saivasdsana) into two main currents (pravaha): one associated with Lakulisa and the other with Srikantha, whose teachings (sasana) consist of the five major streams (srotas) of the Saivagamas we shall discuss later.93 Unfortunately, no original Pasupata scriptures have been recovered. Moreover we are hard pressed to find evidence to prove that such scriptures ever existed. We do come across expressions like \"Pdsupata-sastra\"and even hear of its fabulous size94 but we have managed to trace only one concrete reference to a possible Pasupata scripture. This occurs in Bhattotpala's tenth century commentary on Varahamihira's Brhat-samhita95 where he says that the Pasupatas worship Siva according to the procedures enjoined by the Vatulalantra. All of the few works so far recovered belong to Lakulisa's school. The oldest is the Pasupatasutra attributed to Lakulisa himself. We also have a commentary called \"pancarthabhdsya\"by Kaundinya, whose date, although far from certain, is generally thought to be sometime between the fourth and sixth centuries A.D.96 Although we cannot be sure that the sutras are, as the commentator says, by Lakulisa himself, they do, in fact, appear to be quite old and bear many archaic traits. These are apparent particularly in the figure of Pasupati himself who is identified with Prajapati and associated with the Vedic Rudra with whom he shares a number of Vedic names such as Aghora, Ghora, Sarva and Sarva. Apart from the Pasupatasutra the only other extant Lakulisa Pasupata work is the Ganakarika by Hara-dattacarya and a tenth century commentary, the Ratnatika, by Bhasarvajna. These works, along with summaries of Lakulisa Pasupata philosophy found in medieval treatises on the philosophical systems, are the sole sources we possess.97 It is possible that Lakulisa's disciple, Musalendra, wrote a work called the Hrdayapramana98 and there are numerous quotes from lost works both in the Ratnatika and Kaundinya. Unfortunately, the sources are never named, and it is hard to say whether they are original Agamas or not, or if they are specifically Pasupata scripture or secondary works. The spiritual discipline these works prescribe does not involve complex rites or require extensive intellectual development. It is, however, largely intended for the renunciate, rather than the householder. Thus lay worshipers have only to recite obeisance to Siva (namah sivaya) with folded hands while the celibate ascetic is given much more to do. He can be"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"22 THE SAIVA AGAMAS either fully naked or wear a single strip of cloth to cover his privities. He should practice austerities, such as the penance of sitting amidst five fires. After his morning ablutions he smears his body with ashes and does the same at noon and in the evening. After his bath he goes to the temple where he sits to meditate on Siva. As he does so, he should sometimes laugh loudly, sing and dance. Before leaving and saluting the deity, he repeats the seed-syllable \"huduk \" three times and recites his mantra. When he bathes alone, he should pay homage to the lineage of Pasupata teachers (tlrthesa) headed by Lakulisa. After his bath he should select a clean place for meditation and stay there to practice it through the day. In the evening the site is again cleared and purified with ashes. When he feels sleepy, he again spreads ashes on the ground and lies down to sleep. When the Pasupata yogi has developed a degree of spiritual insight (jnana), his teacher permits him to practice antinomi'an behaviour.99 At this stage of his spiritual discipline, he should act like a madman ignorant of right and wrong. Pretending to sleep, he snores loudly or rolls on the ground and talks nonsense. When he sees a beautiful woman, he should make lewd gestures at her. In this way he courts abuse in the belief that his disgrace will gain for him the double benefit of purifying him of his sins and gaining the merit of those who abuse him. The Lakulisa ascetic is, however, basically a disciplined, continent man. Moreover, although he is told to behave in a manner contrary to accepted norms, his conduct falls short of the total abandon extremist Tantrics allow themselves. He can laugh and sing in the temple but he is not allowed to offer Siva anything else if it is not prescribed.100 In fact, his behaviour is regulated by injunctions (vidhi) down to the smallest detail. For instance, he must offer garlands to Siva, but they must not be made of fresh unconsecrated flowers.101 He cannot simply abandon himself on his own initiative: he must wait for his teacher's permission to do so. His lewd gestures are just play-acting: in reality he must avoid woman's company whenever he can. He is specifically prohibited from even talking to women102 and must be strictly celibate.103 Women are a particularly dangerous source of temptation; they are not embodiments of the goddess and as such potential Tantric consorts through whom communion with Siva could be attained. As Kaundinya says: She whom people regard as woman is [in reality deadly] poison [which consumes a man's life like] fire [and is as dangerous as] a sword or an arrow. She is horror and illusion (maya) incarnate. Fools, not the wise, revel in the body full of impurities and worms. Foul smelling and unclean, it is the ephemeral abode of urine and excreta. It is the sight of a woman, not wine, that maddens a man. Shun therefore woman whose"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Pasupatas and Lakulisa 23 mere sight, even at a distance, deludes. The world is bitten by the snake whose form is woman's sexual organ who, with mouth cast downwards, moves between [her] thighs, beyond all control [even that] of the scriptures.104 If the Lakulisa Pasupata works that have been preserved reflect Lakulisa's own views, it appears that his path is a peculiar combination of the orthodox and extreme heterodox. As outlined in these works, it is, despite the antinomian elements, as closely linked to the orthodox 'Vedic' patterns as it is to the Tantric. If Lakulisa was, in fact, a reformer who revived Pasupata Saivism, as some scholars believe, possibly this reform consisted in a restatement of Pasupata ideals and the rationale behind the Pasupata's behaviour in such a way as to make them more acceptable to the Brahmanical literate class. Alternatively, it is possible that Lakulisa brought about a revival of an older, essentially Vedic, form of Saivism that evolved out of the proto-sectarian ascetical orders of the Vedic world. These groups were sustained in their ideals by the peculiar figure of Rudra, a Vedic god whose appearance and character could serve as the focus of an alternative set of values sustained by the Brahmanical classes. Be that as it may, LakuIisa himself is consistently portrayed, both in the Pumnas and the Pasupata texts, as a brahmin. The Karavanamahatmya says that he was an incarnation of Siva born to a Brahmin couple in Ulkapuri and later went to Kayavarohana where he began to preach.105 Kaundinya says that he was an incarnation of Siva who, taking the form of a brahmin, was born in Kayavatarana.106 This place, also called Kayavarohana, Karohana or Kayarohana, is identified with the village of Karvan situated some twenty miles north of Baroda. Ulkapuri is modern Avakhal in the same region.|07 According to the Sivapurana, Siva entered and revived the corpse of a brahmin lying in a cremation ground near Kayavarohana. He did so for the benefit of all brahmins.108 According to the Kurmapurana he, \"the Lord of the gods,\" resides in the sanctuary of Kayavatara.109 He was the last of Siva's incarnations, all of whom come into the world for the welfare of brahmins and to establish the Veda.110 Kaundinya repeatedly stresses that the followers of Lakulisa must be brahmins. This is because Lakulisa was himself a brahmin and taught his religion to brahmin pupils.111 The Pasupatasutra itself declares that: \"no brahmin returns to the world.\" Kaundinya comments: \"no brahmin, be he a householder, student, hermit or ascetic who reads one, two, three or four Vedas or even (merely recites) the Gayatri and who approaches close to Rudra by his conduct, returns to the cycle of rebirth.\"112 The Pasupatasutra prescribes that the aspirant should not even talk to a member of the lowest (sudra) caste. 113 If he happens inadvertently to do"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"24 THE SAIVA AGAMAS so or - worse - to touch one, he must purify himself by practicing breath control and repeating a Vedic mantra (here called Gayatri) addressed to Rudra.\"4 In this way, his mind is freed from impurity (kalusa). Several teachers of the Kalamukhas who, as we have noted, were LakuliSa Pasupatas, are referred to in inscriptions as brahmins.115 Their monastic centres were places where these celibate ascetics could study every branch of orthodox Sanskrit learning, including the Mimamsa and the Vedas with their auxiliaries.116 The Pasupatas of the Pasupatasutra were also close to their Vedic roots. The importance given to the recitation of \"OM\" (a practice normally forbidden to the lower castes) and the recitation of Vedic Mantras in honour of Pasupati clearly indicates the Brahminical character of this cult.117 However, not all Pasupatas had to be brahmins. Dvivedi observes that some of the names of Pasupata teachers listed as preceding Lakulisa correspond to a list of members of the Ksatriya aristocracy found in the Mahabharata.118 The Vamanapurana confirms that Ksatriyas also followed the Pasupata's path.119 Possibly these references are evidence that Lakulisa did, in fact, introduce changes in this respect into the earlier Pasupata religion. Perhaps also, we can understand the specific injunction in the Sutras not to look at urine and excreta as a reaction against the more extreme practices of the earlier Pasupatas that required the handling and even consumption of these and other obnoxious substances.120 In fact, we must clearly distinguish between two basic types of Pasupata traditions, namely, one that bases itself on the Vedic tradition (or better its classical smarta form as it appears in the Puranas, etc.) and one that, in the eyes of the former, runs counter to that tradition. We find extensive references to the former everywhere in the Puranas, particularly in the Kurma, which can be said to be the most important Purana for smarta Pasupatas. In this Purana the consort of the Great Goddess is Pasupati121 and she enjoins that men should follow the ordinances of the Vedas and smrtis concerning caste and the stages of life (varnasrama).,n She loves those who do so.121 Pasupati is invoked by reciting the Satarudriya section of the Yajurveda and other Vedic hymns along with the Atharvasirasupanisad.124 Indeed, Siva is the embodiment of the Veda and can be known solely through the Veda, while the Veda's sole object of knowledge is Siva.125 Prthu's grandson, King Susila, went to the Himalayas and there praised Siva with Vedic hymns. There appeared before him the sage Svetasvatara, a great Pasupata. He imparted to the king a Vedic mantra and thus initiated him into the Pasupata path. The king thus entered the last stage of life (samyasa) and, covering himself with ashes, dedicated himself to the study of the Vedas.I26 Everywhere in this Purana, Siva extols the importance of the Pasupata vow:"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Pasupatas and Lakullsa 25 Tranquil, with the mind under one's control, the body covered with ashes, devoted to celibacy and naked, one should observe the Pasupata vow.

The sage, devoted to the practice of the Vedas, wearing nothing but a loincloth or single piece of clothing, should meditate upon Siva, the Lord of Beasts (Pasupati).127 But even though Siva enjoins the observance of the Pasupata vow, he goes on to say that scriptures of the followers of Lakulisa and the Pasupatas are amongst those that he has created which run counter to the ordinances of the Veda and so should not be followed.I28 We seem to be faced with a contradiction. The Lakulisa Pasupata path, as outlined in the Pasupatasutra and other extant works of this school, basically falls in line with the Pasupata path described in the Kurmapurana. Yet both the Pasupatas and the Lakulisa Pasupatas are repeatedly censored in this Purana as heretics and outside the Vedic fold (vedabahya). Similarly, the Devibhagavata stresses that knowledge of the Veda bears fruit only by applying ashes to the body as a sign of devotion to Siva. It warns, however, that the ashes must not be prepared in the manner described in the Tantras nor should they be accepted from the hands of a Sudra, Kapalika or other heretics including, presumably, non-Vedic Pasupatas.129 The Sivapurana distinguishes between two types of Saivagama, namely, Vedic (srauta) and non-Vedic (asrauta). The former consists of the essential purport of the Vedas, and is that in which the supreme Pasupata vow is explained. The latter is independent and consists of the twenty-eight Siddhantagamas.130 Why then does the Kurma reject some Pasupatas and not others? Again, what should we make of Abhinava's analysis of the Saiva teachings (Saivasasana) into two currents - one associated with Lakulisa and the other with Srikantha?131 Does he mean that Lakulisa's current flows through the Puranas and Smrtis? Probably not, otherwise he would not distinguish between the \"Saiva teachings\"and those of the Vedic tradition, which he says are its very opposite.\"132 The Saivagamas do, in fact, frequently refer with approval to the Pasupatas and make room for them in their world view. Thus the Svacchandatantra, as Dvivedi indicates in his article,133 has homologized the places associated with Siva's incarnations prior to Lakulisa with the worlds located in the metaphysical principles (tattva) which constitute the cosmic order. The Agamas in general, as we have already noted, accept both the Pasupata and Lakulisa Pasupata as branches of the Saiva teachings. Moreover, Abhinava associates them particularly with the monistic Tantric traditions which have contributed to the formation of Kashmiri Saivism and sees them as being intimately"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"26   THE SAIVA AGAMAS related to the Kaula and Bhairava Tantras.134 This association is apparently confirmed by the Puranas which treat the Pasupatas and followers of the Vama and Bhairava Tantras as groups of equally heretical Saivites. We must therefore distinguish not only between two types of Pasupatas in general but also, more specifically, between two types of Lakulisa Pasupatas as well. How these Smarta and Agamic Saivites are related to one another is a subject of further research. The Kapalikas The Kapalikas, so-called because they vowed to carry a human skull (kapala), are as well known to the common Indian as they are obscure to them. Infamous for their extreme antinomian behaviour and for their supposed practice of human sacrifice, they caught the imagination of Sanskrit poets in the past just as they continue to fascinate the Indian mind to this day. Sometimes hardly more than an object of ridicule for his superficial hedonism and peculiar beliefs and way of life, the Kapalika is more often portrayed as a villain dedicated to the exercise of his magic powers, which he acquires through his penance, Mantras and awesome, often violent, rites. Krsna Misra (c. 1050-1100) creates a Kapalika in his play, the Prabodhacandrodaya, who proudly proclaims the essentials of his creed as he describes his way of life: \"My charming ornaments are made from garlands of human skulls,\" says the Kapalika, \"1 dwell in the cremation ground and eat my food from a human skull. 1 view the world alternately as separate from God (isvara) and one with Him, through the eyes that are made clear with the ointment of yoga. . . We (Kapalikas) offer oblations of human flesh mixed with brains, entrails and marrow. We break our fast by drinking liquor (sura) from the skull of a Brahmin. At that time the god Mahabhairava should be worshipped with offerings of awe-inspiring human sacrifices from whose severed throats blood flows in currents.\"1\" One of the earliest references to a Kapalika is found in Hala's Prakrit poem, the Gathasaptasati (third to fifth century A.D.) in a verse in which the poet describes a young female Kapalika who besmears herself with ashes from the funeral pyre of her lover.136 Varahamihira (c. 500-575 A.D.) refers more than once to the Kapalikas137 thus clearly establishing their existence in the sixth century. Indeed, from this time onwards references to Kapalika ascetics become fairly commonplace in Sanskrit"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Kapalikas 27 literature. However, only half a dozen or so inscriptions which unambiguously refer to the Kapalikas and their ascetic organisations have so far been recovered. This is possibly because, unlike the Kalamukhas, Siddhantins and other Saiva groups, the Kapalikas maintained a more strictly itinerant way of life and did not found durable monastic institutions of any size. The Kapalikas are regularly referred to as \"Somasiddhantins,\" implying that they had formulated their own set of beliefs on a rational basis (siddhanta). However, they do not appear to have had any scriptures which were peculiarly their own, nor written independent works.138 The Kapalikas seem to have been ascetics who took the vow to live the Kapalika's way of life; they were a distinct sect in this sense alone. Hindu Kapalikas were invariably Saivites who imitated in their own way the peculiar behaviour of Siva, their mythical exemplar. It was possible for members of differing Saiva sects to adopt the Kapalika's vow. Even Buddhist ascetics could take similar vows in the context of their own Tantric practice. Thus Kanhapada (Skt. Krsnapada) who lived in the eleventh century and is well known as one of the Bengali Siddhas of the Buddhist Tantric Sahajiya school calls himself a Kapalin. He is such, he says, because he has entered into the higher path of Yoga and is sporting in the city of his body in non-dual form.139 His anklets and bells (ghanti) are the two breaths which represent the opposites. His earrings (kundala) are the sun and moon. The ashes he smears on his body are the ashes of passion, aversion and error. His pearl necklace is the highest liberation. 140 These are the same insignia that distinguish the Saivite Kapalika as well, namely, the necklace (kunlhika), neck ornament (rucaka), earrings (kundala), crest jewel (sikhamani), ashes (bhasma) and sacred thread (yajnopavita).141 Most important of all is the skull the Kapalika carries, which distinguishes him from other ascetics and symbolizes his antinomian way of life. The Aghori is the Kapalika's modern counterpart. Committed to a spiritual discipline which aims at freeing him directly from every contrast between the opposites of prescribed and forbidden conduct, his disregard for the conventional norms of behaviour has earned him, as it did the Kapplika, an ambiguous reputation. On the one hand, the conventions of the world do not touch him and so in India, where the subjective sense of personal freedom is considered to be a measure of spiritual development, the Aghori is a saint. At the same time, as one would expect, he is considered (especially by the higher castes) to be unclean and vulgar. Nonetheless, he is respected and even feared for the powers (siddhis) he acquires by the strangeness of his way of life. A modern observer who has spent time with these ascetics in Manikarnika, the main cremation ground"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"28 THE SAIVA AGAMAS at Benares, writes that the Aghori: ... .may go naked or clothe himself in a shroud taken from a corpse, wear a necklace of bones around his neck and his hair in matted curls, his eyes are conventionally described as burning-red, like live coals; his whole demeanour is awesome, and in speech he is brusque, churlish and foul mouthed. . . . The Aghori sleeps over a model bier (made from the remnants of a real one); smears his body with ashes from the pyres, cooks his food on wood pilfered from them and consumes it out of the human skull which is his constant companion and alms-bowl. . . . The 'true' Aghori is entirely indifferent to what he consumes, drinks not only liquor but urine and eats not only meat but excrement, vomit and the putrid flesh of corpses.142 A linga is installed in an open shrine in the cremation ground called, significantly, Kapalesvara - the Lord of the Skull. Kapalesvara is worshipped here by the resident Aghori, who acts as the officiating priest for his cult. He is joined at dawn every morning by a small group of householders who are followers of Rama Avadhuta, a well-known Aghori belonging to the KInaram sect, named after the Aghori who founded it in the eighteenth century in Benares. These householders call themselves Kapalikas although, technically, they are not so. Travelling back in time we observe that Saiva sects in the past have also associated themselves with the Kapalikas because they resembled them. We should stress here that this resemblance did not necessarily imply that they advocated such a shocking life style. In fact, we more often find that the Kapaiika is thought to be a man who has shaken off all worldly ties (avadhuta) and his antinomian behaviour is understood to be a meaningful visible expression of the liberated life (jivanmukti) he leads. This is how the Kapaiika and his code of conduct are viewed in the Natha tradition that has associated itself in the past, although somewhat peripherally, with the Kapalikas. Our source is the Goraksasiddhanta-samgraha, a late medieval Sanskrit work. The anonymous author quotes from the Sdbaratantra a list of twelve sages to whom the Kapalika doctrine was revealed, namely: Adinatha, Anadi, Kala, Atikaia, Karala, Vikarala, Mahakala, Kaiabhairava, Batuka, Bhutanatha, Viranathaand Srikantha. These twelve each had a disciple who propagated the path. They were: Nagarjuna, Jadabharata, Hariscandra, Satyanatha, Bhimanatha, Goraksa, Carpata, Avadya, Vairagya, Kanthadhari, Jalandhara and Malayarjuna.143 Several of these names appear in the Natha lists of eighty-four Siddhas and nine Nathas, notably that of Gorakhanatha himself, who is also associated with the Sabaratantra,144 and Adinatha, who is generally"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Kapalikas 29 accepted by Gorakhanathis to be Matsyendranatha's teacher who was Gorakhanatha's preceptor.145 Although we cannot expect to glean much of real historical value from this list, its existence indicates how easily the Kapalikas are aligned with other Saiva groups. It is not surprising, therefore, that the Kapalikas were frequently confused with other Saiva groups, such as the Kaulas whose scriptures we shall discuss in the second part of this book.146 The Kapalikas worshipped Bhairava, the wrathful form of Siva who, because he decapitated Brahma, was forced to carry a skull as penance. According to the Vamanapurana,147 it was because Siva was a Kapalin that Daksa did not invite him to the sacrifice he had prepared for the gods. In this version of the myth, the orthodox tradition represented by Daksa does not appear to be concerned to exclude Siva from the pantheon as much as Bhairava - the Skull Bearer and the god of many Saiva Agamic cults, including those of the Kapalikas. The Kapalikas who, as we have already noted, do not appear to have had scriptures of their own, looked to the Bhairavagamas as their authority. Madhava in his Sankaradigvijaya describes a meeting between Sankara and Krakaca \"the foremost of Kapalin teachers.\" Krakaca mocks Sarikara for being a half-hearted Saivite who smears his body with ashes but even so prefers to carry an 'impure' clay bowl rather than a human skull: \"Why,\" he then asks, \"do you not worship Kapalin? If he does not receive your worship as Bhairava with liquor (madhu) and the blood-smeared lotuses which are human heads, how can he be blissful when embraced by Uma, his equal?\" In this way Krakaca is said to \"prattle the essence of the Bhairava­gamas.\" 148 A battle then ensues between Krakaca's Kapalika followers and Sankara's disciples. Seeing his army routed, Krakaca approaches Sankara and says: \"O devotee of evil doctrines, behold my power. Now you will reap the fruits of this action!\" Closing his eyes (Krakaca) placed a skull in the palm of his hand and briefly meditated. After that master of the Bhairavagamas had thus meditated, the skull was immediately filled with liquor (sura). After drinking half of it. he held (the remaining half) and thought of Bhairava.149 Bhairava then appears as Mahakapalin, the Bhairava of Universal"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"30 THE SAIVA AGAMAS Destruction (Samharabhairava). But instead of killing Sankara, as Krakaca orders him to do. Sankara convinces him to kill Krakaca instead. Krakaca and his disciples are expressly said to be Kapalikas and distinguished from the followers of the Bhairavataniras that Madhava says Sankara vanquished before he met Krakaca.150 Even so, Krakaca evidently derives his power from the Bhairavatantras in which he is well versed. It is not surprising, therefore, that the adepts of the Bhairava­tantras and other Tantras like them, such as the Varna and Kaula groups, are similar to the Kapalikas in many respects. Thus Bana, the seventh century poet, describes a Bhairavacarya in his Harsacarita who, as Lorenzen remarks, \"performed a Tantric ritual appropriate for a Kapalika.\"151 His lip hung low \"as if overweighted by the whole Saivite canon (Saivasamhita) resting on the tip of his tongue.\"152 He worships Mahakalabhairava, the god for whom Tantric rites are performed. The Bhairavacarya is engaged in magically subduing a Vetala by offering black sesame into a fire burning in the mouth of a corpse upon which he sits in the dense darkness of a moonless night.153 But, however striking the resemblance may be, he is not a Kapalika. The Bhairavagamas do, in fact, outline many rituals and patterns of behaviour that can serve as the basis for the Kapalika's practices. We have already noted the form of the initiation prescribed in the BY.154 (See pp. 128-133 for abbreviations.) In the same Tantra (which belongs to the Bhairava group) a lengthy section is devoted to a ritual known as the \"Sacrifice of the Skull\" (turayaga) in which the deity is invoked and worshipped in a human skull.155 According to Abhinavagupta, this rite can take the place of the more conventional worship of Siva's Lihga156 which, although more extensively treated in the Siddhantagamas, is also prescribed in the Bhairavatantras. This rite, which involves ritual sex and the offering of wine and meat (even beef and human flesh), is clearly based on the power the skull possesses to invoke the awesome presence of Bhairava and the other gods and goddesses worshipped in it. We are reminded here of Krakaca's skull and the magical powers (siddhis) he possesses by virtue of his penance, that is, the vow he makes to carry a skull (Kapalavrata). Although the Sacrifice of the Skull and the Kapalika's vow are independent of each other, they belong to the same world: the culture of the cremation ground where death and decay are not just reminders of the transitoriness of life but awesome sources of yogic power and, for those who seek it, liberation. Carrying the skull of a brahmin, thus imitating Bhairava's penance for having severed Brahma's head.157 the votary of the Vow of the Skull gains the god's cosmic power. This vow is one of a number, including that of the Pasupata, that the initiates of the"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Kapalikas 31 Bhairavagamas can undertake.158 Even so, the Agamas distinguish between the Kapalikas, as Votaries of the Skull (Kapalavratin), and other Saivite yogis, ranking them separately in a group of their own along with the Pasupatas. This group is called the Higher Path (atimarga).159 According to the Svacchandatantra, the Higher Path is so called because it is beyond all intellectual notions and the knowledge of it transcends the world. The worldly are the fettered who travel the path of creation and destruction, whereas the ones who adhere to the Vow of the Skull and the Pasupatas are established on the Higher Path beyond it and so are no longer subject to further rebirth.160 Another reason why this group is called the \"Higher Path\" can be understood if we examine how the Agamas in general, and the Siddhanta in particular, conceive of the relationship between themselves and other technical and sacred literature (sastra). According to the Kamikagama,161 all existing sastras are divided into five groups which, although ultimately uttered by one of Sadasiva's five faces, are created through the mediation of a Karanesvara who is one of five deities collectively called the Five Brahmas (pancabrahma). See Table 2. Table 2. The Treatises and Scriptures Spoken by Sadasiva's Faces. Direction Face Karanesvara Sastra West  Sadyojata Brahma Laukika North Vamadeva Visnu Vaidika South Aghora Rudra Adhyatmika East Tatpurusa Isvara Atimarga Upper Isana Sadasiva Mantratantra The Laukikasastras are the secular arts and sciences, including politics, medicine, dramaturgy and horticulture. The adhyatmikasastras are the Samkhya and Yoga while, according to Ksemaraja, the knowledge taught on the Higher Path is \"beyond the well-known path of the Veda, Samkhya and Yoga, etc.. It refers here to the means [to liberation and the acquisition of power] explained throughout the Supreme Lord's scripture in general, namely, the many rituals, mandalas and gestures (mudra). It is not independent of the [other] four.\"162 It is quite clear that what Ksemaraja is saying here is that the Saiva groups that belong to the Higher Path draw from the sacred texts and treatises belonging to the other categories and do not possess a corpus of scripture of their own. We are reminded here of the Pasupata Kalamukha teachers who are praised in"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"32   THE SAIVA AGAMAS South Indian inscriptions as erudite scholars in all the major branches of Sanskrit learning and who, by their knowledge of the Supreme Soul's scripture (paramatmagama), the Lakulagama, contributed to the Lakulisa Pasupata system.163 Essentially, therefore, the Saivagamas are the Mantratantrasastra manifested by Sadasiva through Isana, his upper face. Insofar as each face is supposed to possess all five faces, the Mantratantra group is also divided into five. See Table 3. Table 3. Divisions of the Mantratantra. Direction Face  Class of Agama West  Sadyojata Bhuta North  Vamadeva Varna South  Aghora  Bhairava  East  Tatpurusa Garuda Upper  Isana  Siddhanta  This system of classification is common to the Siddhantagamas as a whole164 and appears to have originated with them. Moreover, Jayaratha tells us that all Agamic Saivites generally accept that the Saiva teachings are divided into these five major currents of scripture.165 The Siddhanta­gamas stick closely to this basic scheme while many major Agamas of other types modify it in various ways and sometimes also integrate it with other systems of classification for their own purposes. A good example of how these modifications take place can be observed in the way Trikatantras prevalent in Kashmir present the Saiva canon from their own perspective. Thus the Srikanthiyasamhita, which Abhinava treats as his major authority in these matters, divides the scriptures into three groups belonging to Siva, Rudra and Bhairava respectively. The first two constitute the Siddhantagamas and the third is related to the Bhairava-tantras. This division into three groups suits the SKS purpose which is to establish that the three aspects of Trika are the source and essence of the scriptures. But although the currents of scripture are reduced in number, they are still said to originate from Sadasiva's five faces which produce them by combining in various ways.166 Consequently, Abhinava still considered the original five-fold division of the scriptures to be the most basic and fundamentally linked to the very structure of reality as a"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Kapalikas 33 manifestation of the five powers of universal consciousness. Abhinava writes: The phenomenal aspect [of reality] born of consciousness shines radiantly and spontaneously through the Five Brahmas in the five individualized powers of its own nature, the forms of which are consciousness, pulsation, will, knowledge and action. (Thus) assuming the nature of scripture, it unfolds five -fold.167 The Siddhanta, which universally categorizes itself as the \"upper current\" and hence as the highest class,168 consists of twenty-eight principal Agamas, of which ten are Sivagamas and eighteen Rudragamas. The list of these twenty-eight Agamas is well known and recurs regularly, not only in the Agamas of the Siddhanta but also in those belonging to other groups,169 thereby indicating the Siddhanta canon's stability and the authority it managed to establish for itself at a relatively early date. The Siddhanta canon is, in this respect at least, reminiscent of the Puranic canon. Once the number of Puranas had been fixed at eighteen, they remained eighteen and every major Purana thought of itself as one of them. The Agamic texts were not, however, generally subject to the manifold additions, subtractions and other changes that occurred regularly in Puranic texts. The Agamas simply increased in number. In the case of the Siddhanta, where the number remained fixed, addition took place by the accretion of subsidiary Agamas (called upagamas) which attached themselves to the principal Agamas. However, other Agamic-groups - particularly the Bhairavaiantras - continued to undergo major developments in their structure through the addition not just of Agamas that submissively tacked themselves on to others, but of scriptures that asserted .themselves as primary, root texts. Thus the way these Agamas classified the scriptures had to keep changing in order to accommodate these additions and the altered understanding of their own identity that was entailed. In order to understand what changes have taken place in the Saiva canon and how they have occurred, let us see first of all what we can make out of the basic division of scripture into five currents. Below is a list of these Tantras. The Siddhantagamas are sufficiently well known to be excluded from our present discussion. Originally in the Pruristhalaksana-sarasamuccaya, Dvivedi has, in his Luptagamasamgraha, reproduced this list in alphabetical order.170 Here the original order in which these Agamas are listed has been restored because, as we shall see, it tells us a great deal.

Firstly, we know that the author of the PLSS, Vairocana. was the son of the Bengali Pala king Dharmapala who reigned from 794 to 814 A.D..171 Thus this list furnishes an ante quern for these works which can be ascertained with reasonable accuracy. Moreover, it is the only list we know of at present in which the Daksinatantras are related to those of the Siddhanta in the basic five-fold scheme and in which all the Agamas are clearly enumerated. Thirdly, it appears that this was an early standard list (or one of them) and that it does present a faithful picture of these currents of scripture (srotas) at an early stage of their development, as the following discussion will hopefully establish. In the Mrgentiragama we find that the Saivagama is divided into five major currents and eight secondary ones. Unfortunately, the reference is very concise; even so it supplies us with a number of facts. Here it is: The currents [are as follows]: the Upper [current consists of the Agamas] starting with Kamika. [The Agamas] starting with Asitanga"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"36   THE SAIVA AGAMAS belong to the South, those starting with Sammohana are in the North. To the West is the extensive [group] starting with Trotala. Eastern are those starting with Candasidhara of Candanatha.172 Here, as usual, the Upper Current is that of the Siddhantagamas. Although the Kamika normally heads the list of these Agamas, its explicit mention is particularly relevant here because the Mrgendra is closely related to it.173 The Daksinasrotas - the current of the Southern Face is characterised by the Asitahgagama which, although admittedly not at the head of the PLSS list, does figure as a member of this group. Moreover, the Kamika considers Asitanga to be one of the forms of Siva that spoke these Tantras.174 According to the Mrgendra, the Sammohanatantra heads the next group, namely, the Vamatantras belonging to the North. The Sammohana probably corresponds to Mohanam] the fourth Tantra in the PLSS list. The Kamika confirms that there are twenty-four Tantras belonging to this group. Moreover, it considers the Nayasutra to be the first of the Vamatantras which tallies with Nayatantra, that heads PLSS's list.175 We know from the Brahmayamala that the Sammohana and Nayottara along with the Sirascheda belong to the Vamatantras.176 This is supported by the Jayadrathayamala (also known as the Sirascheda) which says:177 Belonging to the Current of the Left are the perfect [Agamas including] the frightening Sirascheda. The three: Nayottara, Maharaudra and Mahasammohana have, O goddess, emerged in the Current of the Left. A further important piece of evidence that these Agamas belong together is furnished by a Cambodian inscription dated Saka era 974 (1052 A.D.). It refers to the introduction of these Agamas into Cambodia during the reign of Jayavarman II, who came to re-occupy the throne in Cambodia in 802 A.D. after a period of exile in Java. His priest was a brahmin called Hiranyadama who, with the king's consent, revealed to Sivukaivalya, a fellow priest, the Four Faces of Tumburu, namely, the Sirascheda, Vinasikha, Sammohana and Nayottara.178 The king also invited Hiranyadama to perform a ceremony meant to bring about the independence of Cambodia from Java and establish himself as emperor. The ceremony was performed according to the Vinasikha. During the ritual Hiranyadama recited all four Tantras so that Sivakaivalya could write them down and learn them. According to the Netratantra, Tumburu is the form of Siva that"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Kapalikas 37 presides over the Vamasroias179 although, like Sadasiva, he has five instead of four faces.180 Even so. most other independent sources do describe him as having four faces.181 In the NT, as in other sources, Tumburu is accompanied by four goddesses. These goddesses are commonly found together in a group in both Puranic and Tantric texts and need not necessarily be associated with Tumburu, although they are usually his chief companions when he is represented along with his attendants.182 The names of these goddesses are significant for us, as they correspond (in the feminine) to four Vamatamrasin the PLSS list, namely, Java (Jayam), Vijaya (Vijayam), Ajita (Ajitam) and Aparajita (Aparajitam). These four Tantras appear together directly below the Vinatantra and thus could well be the Vinasikha mentioned in the Cambodian inscription. A manuscript of the Vinasikhatantra is preserved in Nepal and has been edited by Goudriaan.183 As one would expect, Tumburu is the chief deity of this Tantra and is portrayed along with the four goddesses.184 It is, however, surprisingly short and the rituals it describes are relatively simple. Even so, there can be no doubt that this VST is closely associated with the Sirascheda, Sammohana and Nayottara to which the goddess refers at the beginning of the Tantra while expressing the desire to know more.185 The Nayottara is mentioned as a source of basic rituals the votary of the VST should perform.I86 Similarly other rituals were drawn from the Sarvatobhadra and Mahasammohana Tantras.187 The Agamas regularly characterise the Vamatantras as being concerned with the acquisition of power: Siddhi.188 According to the Cambodian inscription, Hiranyadama, \"an expert in the science of siddhis\"189 revealed a unique siddhi to King jayavarman and taught it to Sivakaivalya, 190 along with the means to acquire it. In fact, the VST, which Siva proclaims bestows siddhi,191 is primarily concerned with this. Even the worst sinner, one who has killed a brahmin, can attain this siddhi by performing the rituals of the VST.192 Here \"siddhi \"does not mean success in Yoga or yogic powers, but rather the successful completion of magic rites and the powers acquired thereby. These rites are of two types, either cruel (raudra) or pure (suci). Amongst the former are those meant to subjugate others, defeat and kill one's enemies or create discord between friends. The latter include those performed for peace and the pacification of malevolent spirits. Even when the Tantra deals with higher esoteric practices that can potentially lead to communion with Siva,193 it prefers to devote itself to magic and the acquisition of power. For example, according to this Tantra, when Siva in the form of the vital breath, moves along the path of the nerve Pingala, his nature is fiery and bestows he powers to perform the cruel acts (raudrakarmari). When Siva moves along"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"38 THE SAIVA AGAMAS Ida's track, he is nectar and gives the power to perform the pure acts (sucikarman) Between these two nerves lies Susumna, which is the way of release (moksamarga).194 The Tantra, however, almost exclusively deals with the first two paths. Anyway, the rituals and Mantras taught in the VST lead to both worldly success and release.195 Once the adept has fully enjoyed all the worldly pleasures the Tantra can bestow, he ultimately reaches Siva's abode.196 Other Tantras of the Vamasrotas A number of manuscripts of a Tantra called the Jayadrathayamala, which identifies itself as the Sirascheda, are preserved in Nepal. Possibly the same Sirascheda to which the Cambodian inscription refers, it is a long and complex text. According to the Javadratha's colophons, it belongs to the Bhairavasrotas.. However, it affiliates itself to a Middle Current of scriptures between those of the Right and the Left197 while affirming that it belongs equally to both.198 Although the JY's association with the Right Current is well established, there are numerous links that connect it to the Vamatantras of the Left. One is the sage Sukra who the JY says, received this Tantra (from Bhairava?) and transmitted it to men.199 The VST affirms that one of the rituals it describes was taught by this sage, who extracted it from the Sarvatubhadra and Nayottara Tantras,200 while accord'ng to the JY, Sukra, along with Ahgiras, received the Nuyoitara and brought it into the world.201 Apparently the JY's syncretistic character and complex affiliations with both the Right and Left currents made it possible lor it to be linked with both as well as either of the two. The JY probably postdates the Nayoltara and other major Tantras of the Left. This seems likely not only because it refers to them but also because its system of classifying the Tantras displays a degree of sophistication that presupposes previous extensive developments (see below). There can be no doubt, however, that the JY precedes Abhinava-gupta (c. 975-1050 A.D.) who refers to it as a major authority. Known to the Kashmiris as the Tantrarajabhattaraka, the JY was an important source for the ritual worship of Kali. There can be no doubt about the identity of these works because we know that the Madhavakula was an important section of the Tantrara/abhattaraka202 and it is indeed a major section of the JY. The Anandatantra is a lengthy Tantra203 known in Kashmir as the Anandasasana, Anandadhikarasasana, Anandesvara and Anandasastra."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Garuda and Bhuta Tantras 39 It may possibly correspond to the Anandam listed as no. 17 of the Vamataniras in the PLSS. Abhinava expressly states that the Ananda-lantra teaches the \"doctrine of the left\" (vamasasana).204 It is also one of the Tantras Abhinava cites when he describes Vamacara ritual,205 one of the characteristics of which is the offering of a drop of libation with the left hand to matrcakra in the sacrificial vessel.206 According to the Gama­tantra, the fourth finger and thumb are to be joined when making this offering because these two fingers represent power and the possessor of power which, as Jayanti and Tumburu, unite together.207 Elsewhere the deity of this Tantra is referred to as Varna.208 Of course, although the Gamatantra prescribes ritual procedures for those who practice Vamacara, this does not necessarily mean that it was a Vamatantra. The Left-hand Practice, Vamacara, is a pattern of spiritual discipline and the Tantras of the Left a category of scripture: they need not have anything to do with each other. Even so, the Anandatantra, which was probably a Vamatantra, does discuss Vamacara, while the references to Jayanti and Tumburu in the Gamatantra may indicate that it was, at least in this ritual context, influenced by the scriptures of the Left. The Garuda and Bhuta Tantras No Garuda or Bhuta Tantras have been found; the list of these Tantras recorded in the PLSS can, however, be established to be authentic by references from several sources. The Srikanthiyasamhitastates that the number of Garudaiantras was traditionally said to be twenty-eight which agrees with the number in our list.209 The Kamika confirms that the number of Bhutatantras was twenty.21\" Again the passage from the Mrgendratantra quoted above states that the Garuda group in the East is headed by the Trotalatantra.211 The Tolalam and Totalottaram are, in fact, at one end of our list, although not at the beginning. Again, these Tantras are found listed together as a pair in a list of sixty-four Tantras found in the Nityasodasik arnava.212 While the Vamataniras are traditionally said to be concerned with the acquisition of siddhi, the Garudatantras are supposed to deal with magical remedies for snakebite and poisons, and the Bhutatantras with the exorcism of ghosts and malevolent spirits.211 Unfortunately, we have not recovered any of these Tantras; even so it is possible to get an idea of the sort of rites they described from other sources. In the case of the Garuda­­antras, in particular, our scant knowledge can be supplemented by the"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"40 THE SAIVA AGAMAS Garudapurana. The Garuda, like the Agnipurana, appears to have drawn its Tantric material from relatively early sources. It is not at all improbable that Garudatantras were amongst them. Thus, chapter 19 of this Purana deals with a system of Mantric formulas belonging to Garuda technically called the \"Vidya of the Lord of the Vital Breath\" (pranesvaravidya), which is expressly said to have been taught by Siva. Could this teaching have been imparted in a Garudaiantra? In fact, the Garudapurana contains many incantations and magical rites designed to counter snakebite and the effects of poison, all of which are connected with Garuda. Worth noting in passing is that some of these rites are Vaisnava, in which case Garuda is represented as a form of Visnu, while others are Saiva with Garuda portrayed as an aspect of Siva.214 It is Visnu who originally granted Garuda the power to overcome snakes and, because of his sincere devotion, took him as his vehicle.215 Thus Garuda's Vaisnava associations are obvious. Even so, the Saiva Garuda Mantras and rites are, as a whole, more extensively treated in the Garudapurana than are the Vaisnava ones. Could this be because these matters were of greater concern to the Saiva Agamas than to the Vaisnava Samhitas?216 The way in which Garuda Mantras are applied is basically the same in both Saiva and Vaisnava forms. The body of the ailing person is first transformed into a cosmic body of Mantric energies by the projection of Mantras and seed-syllables onto it. The sick man must then think that he is one with Garuda and so be cured. Abhinavagupta declares that a man who identifies with Garuda is freed from the effects of poison,217 thus confirming that these, or similar, techniques were known to Agamic Saivites. Sometimes this process of identification involves long and elaborate visualizations. An interesting example is a practice Garuda himself is said to have taught to Kasyapa. It is outlined in chapter 197 of the Garuda­purana. The adept first visualizes the five elements in the form of symbolic-figures (mandala) of various shapes and colours. They are then imagined to be located in separate parts of the body. Letters and syllables are then projected into these figures, which thus become charged with their Mantric powers. Finally, the divine beings they embody are worshipped and the adept's body is fully transformed into a microcosm in the centre of which is the Lotus of the Heart wherein resides the Self (atman), the adept's authentic nature. This he must identify with Garuda in the following way: Contemplate your own nature that creates and destroys [all things], beautiful and of the form of passion, as pervading [literally 'flooding'] the entire universe and encircled with garlands of flames burning radiantly from [the abode of] Brahma up to this world. To be successful in all"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Garuda and Bhuta Tantras  41  [your] undertakings, remember [that you are] Bhairava who is Garuda.218 [Contemplate yourself as Bhairava] who has ten arms and four faces. His eyes are a tawny-brown and he carries a lance. His terrible teeth are exposed in a fearful grimace. Extremely terrible, he has three eyes and bears the [crescent] moon on his head. To destroy snakes contemplate [yourself as] Garuda, awesome and frightening. At his feet lie the hells, the quarters are his wings, he bears on his chest the seven heavens and the universe (brahmanda) on his throat while his head contains all space. Garuda, the Lord of the World, is Siva himself who bears Sadasiva with [his] three powers in his topknot. In all your undertakings think of Garuda brilliant like the Fire of Time, his body Mantra, his face frightening, devouring, three-eyed and his form terrible, the destroyer of snakes and poison. Having performed the projection in this way, whatever one thinks becomes [easily] attainable and man becomes in truth Garuda. Seeing him, ghosts, spirits, yaksas, snakes, gandharvas, raksasas and all the fevers are destroyed.219 As we can see from this example, rites designed to counter the effects of poison can also be effective against malevolent spirits. It is not surprising, therefore, if the Garuda and Bhuta Tantras, which specialized in these matters, had, like the Varna and Daksina Tantras, much in common. This supposition is supported by the only known extant Tantra which associates itself with these two groups, namely, the Kriyakala-gunottara, manuscripts of which are deposited in the National Archives in Nepal. Ksemaraja quotes this work extensively in the course of his commentary on chapter 19 of the Netratantra,220 which deals with the various types of possession by ghosts and spirits including Pisacas, Matr, Daityas, Yaksas and Raksasas. It is clear from the introductory verses of this work quoted in the Nepalese catalogue that this Tantra subsumes under a single category of concerns the matters treated in both the Garuda and Bhuta Tantras and deals with them all equally.221 That there was much common content in the Tantras of these two groups is further confirmed by the citations from the Totulagama Ksemaraja quotes, along with the Kriyakalagunottara, in his commentary on the Netratantra.222 Although the Totalatantra is listed in the PLSS in the Garuda group, these passages refer to possession (bhutavesa and yaksagraha), rather than magical antidotes for poison. The Totala and Totalottara are the only Garudatantras, and the Candasidhara the only Bhutatantra, to which we find references.223 It seems, therefore, that most of these Tantras were lost at quite an early date. The reason for this is possibly because the matters they dealt with could be accommodated into the wider perspective of other less specialised Tantras. Thus the Netratantra, as we have seen, contains a long chapter"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"42   THE SAIVA AGAMAS dealing with possession as does the Sritantrasadbhava which Ksemaraja quotes in his commentary on this part of the Netratantra. The Daksinatantras The Tantras that issued from Sadasiva's Southern (daksina) Face are the Tantras of the Right Current of scriptures (daksinasrotas), while those that issued from the Northern (vama) Face are those of the Left (vama-srotas). The Tantras of the Right are called \"Bhairavatantras\"224 because Bhairava is their supreme god and is, in most cases, the one who teaches them to the goddess, his consort. The Siddhantagamas belonging to the Upper Current and the Bhairavatantras of the Right became the most important of all the Agamic groups.225 As we have already noted, the Garuda and Bhutatantras were largely lost at a relatively early date. The Vamatantras must have been valued and studied, as their presence and influence in distant Cambodia testifies. Even so their corpus did not grow as did that of the Daksinatantras which, on the contrary, developed extensively. The Siddhantagamas largely superseded all the other Agamas in the South of India. In the North, in Kashmir and Nepal - the only regions about which we have sufficient source material to make relatively detailed assessments - the Vamatantras were mostly ignored (in Nepal) or relegated to a secondary place (in Kashmir). The Bhairavatantras neither dwindled in importance nor acquired the stability of the Siddhantagamas but kept on growing both in terms of their number and internal categories. We cannot be absolutely sure that similar extensive developments did not take place in the other currents of the Saivagama without examining their Tantras or discovering further notices of them in other sources; even so this possibility seems remote. The fact of the matter is that, in the regions in which the Agamas have been preserved, we are left with two basic categories of Agamic text. One includes the Siddhantagamas and their numerous subsidiary Agamas (upagama) which are preserved largely in South India.22'' The other, preserved in Nepal, includes the Bhairavatantras and numerous groups closely affiliated to them, the most important of which are the Kaulatantras we shall discuss in Part Two of this study. Let us see now how these developments are reflected in the Agamic accounts of the Saiva canon. Before the ninth century, the division into five currents of scripture gave way to a new basic three-fold division into Left, Right and Siddhanta.227 This scheme is found in the Netratantra, which presents the"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Daksinatantras 43 mantra of Siva, the Conqueror of Death (Mrtyunjaya), as one by which the gods of each Current (srolas) can be worshipped and so finds occasion to deal briefly with these divisions.228 Here the presiding deity of the Left is Tumburu; of the Right, Bhairava; and of the Siddhanta,229 Sadasiva. They are presented as aspects of Siva, the Lord of Ambrosia (Amrtesa), in chapters 9, 10 and 11 respectively. A similar division into three currents is found in the Brahmayamala. Although it is not the first Tantra to make use of this system of classification,230 it is not as well defined here as it is in the NT, indicating that it probably precedes it. According to the BY, each of these three currents is presided over by one of the three powers (saktitraya) that together pervade the \"three worlds.\"231 The Right Current is considered pure (suddha), the Left mixed (misra), while the Middle one is said to be affected by every form of impurity.232 The Middle Current is like rice in its husk, the Left Current is like rice when the husk has been removed, while the Right Current is like rice when it has been washed and made ready for cooking. These three together constitute the Stream of Knowledge (jnanaugha).233 The Right Current is then expressly identified with Bhairava, while the Vamatantras are said to belong to the Left Current and the Siddhantagamas to the Middle. The latter are of two types, namely, Sivagamas and Rudragamas, both of which are said to originate from the Upper Face (urdhvavaktra) just as they do according to the Siddhanta. The BY identifies a category of scripture belonging to the Right Current which it calls \"the division into eight times eight\" (astastaka-vibhaga), also known as the \"Eight times Eight Bhairavatantras\" (bhairavastastaka). Moreover, there is a fourth, the Lower Current (adhah srotas) to which belong the Tantras that deal with the worship of Nagas and Narasimha as well as those of the Pancaratra together with the Garuda and Bhuta Tantras and the Tantras dealing with alchemy (rasayana). In this way the BY eliminates the Eastern and Western currents of scripture to which the Garuda and Bhuta Tantras belong. They thus lose much of their identity, barely surviving in the Lower Current to which are relegated odd classes of scripture that cannot be accommodated elsewhere. The account of these divisions in the BY tells us a great deal about the development of the Saivagama, particularly if we compare it with that of the Srikanihiyasamhita and our original list of Tantras belonging to the four currents. The SKS's system of classification basically agrees with that of the BY. although there are important differences also. Thus, the SKS also divides the scriptures into three groups but these are said to be the ten Siva, eighteen Rudra and sixty-four Bhairava Agamas. This division into three allows the SKS to establish that these groups correspond to three levels of doctrine, namely, dualism (bheda), unity-in-diversity"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"44 THE SAIVA AGAMAS (bhedabheda) and monism (abheda),234 which are represented as the three powers of universal consciousness constituting Trika and worshipped as the three goddesses: Apara, Parapara and Para.235 In this way the Vamatantras have been eliminated as a major current of scripture.236 We notice, however, that some of these Tantras are found amongst the sixty-four Bhairavatantras, particularly in a group of eight called Sikha-bheda 237 It appears that the SKS's categories are more compact units than those of the BY, possibly because the SKS postdates the BY. Moreover, the SKS lists the sixty-four Bhairavatantras in full whereas the BY does no more than barely refer to their existence collectively as a group. Again, according to the BY the sixty-four Bhairavatantras are just a part of the Vidyapitha, which is itself only a part of the Right Current of scripture. The SKS removes the Siddhanta from the older division into five currents and relegates the remaining four currents to a secondary level equivalent, broadly speaking, to the BY's Lower Current. In the process, the sixty-four Bhairavatantras have become an isolated group which assumes a new and particularly important status. The sixty-four Bhairavatantras are also treated as an important group in the J Y's system of classification (see appendix C), where it assumes such a markedly independent character that it is not attached to any particular current of scripture. Thus, although described in detail, it is not fully integrated into the JY's system of classification, but appears there as an addition or an afterthought. The names of the eight groups correspond exactly in the J Y and the SKS, and they are enumerated in the same order. However, in the SKS there is a discrepancy between the order of these groups when stated in brief, at the beginning of its detailed exposition of their members, and the order in which they are listed when the Tantras of each group are named individually. As the order of enumeration tallies with that in the J Y in the first instance, there can be no doubt that the order in which these groups are presented has been altered when the SKS deals with them in detail. Moreover this fact proves that this is a well-established and standardized system of classification. Finally, a detailed comparison of these lists (see below p. 121-3) reveals that more than half of the names of these Tantras correspond. It is quite clear, therefore, that this group came to be considered a fully formed corpus in its own right with its own subdivisions which was independent of the original classification into currents of scripture. Even so, it remained closely related to it as a whole and directly connected to the current of the Right in which it originated and developed. In order to understand a little better how the sixty-four Bhairava­tantras are related to the original thirty-two Daksinatantras, we will now"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Daksinatamras 45 compare some lists of these Tantras. What interests us here particularly are the first eight Bhairavatantras of the Right Current. According to the SKS each group of eight is associated with eight Bhairavas. These eight Bhairavas occur again in almost the same order as the names of the Tantras of the first group of eight, namely, the Bhairavastaka. The Tantras belonging to this group are listed below along with another group of eight Bhairavatantras found in the BY and the first eight Tantras of the Right as recorded in the PLSS. See Table 5.

Bahurupa Mahocchusma Vagisa  Kapalisa  8. Vagisa Kapalisa Sikha  Unmatta  What we want to establish is that the eight Bhairavas who are said to preside over the eight groups of Tantras are in fact the eight Tantras that belong to the first of these groups, namely, the Bhairavastaka. Once we have done this, we can go on to compare this group with the eight Tantras that head the list of Daksinatantras in the PLSS. First of all, we can assume that the order of these groups is as we have it in column A1. This is a reasonable assumption insofar as this order coincides exactly with the one we find in the JY. Now if we compare these lists, we find that entries 3) Al+Bl and 3) A2+B2 as well as 4) Al+Bl and 4) A2+B2 correspond exactly. To 8) Al+Bl corresponds 7) A2+B2. It is clear that Kapalisa has been displaced from his position as no. 8. Again, the empty space created by the absence of a Bhairava for the Yamala group'18 seems to have moved Cauda and Unmatta of list Bl down one place. If this is so, the order of the first five Bhairavatantras in the Bhairavastaka of the SKS and JY corresponds exactly to those of the Daksinasrotas according to the PLSS. Again 6) and 7) B2 are Ruru and Kapalisa who follow one another as no. 6 and 7 in the list of the Daksinatantras. The original order given in the SKS (column Bl) places Kapalisa in the eighth place with Mahocchusma in the seventh. It seems, however, that the seventh and eighth were originally Ruru and Kapalisa respectively because their corresponding divisions, Bahurupa and Vagisa, are the seventh and eighth in list Al. If this is so, then Mahocchusma is dislodged from its position as no. 7 in column Bl and moved up to the place of no. 6. In this way this Tantra preserves its place next to Asitanga. The resultant order then is: Svacchanda, Canda, Krodha, Unmatta, Asitanga, Mahocchusma, Ruru and Kapalisa. If this order is correct, then all that needs to be done to the list of Dak sinatantras is to eliminate Samuccayam - which is not the name of a Bhairava - and Mahocchusma can then be accommodated in the gap left in position 6. It is clear, therefore, that the Bhairavastaka and the first eight Tantras of the Dak sinasrotas were originally the same. In other words, what came to be known as the Bhairavastaka was a standard group in the Bhairavatantras of the Daksinasrotas which, possibly because it headed the list of these Tantras, came to be considered as the basis of the sixty-four Bhairava­tantras. The Kamikagama says: 'The Bhairavatantra originated two-fold from the Southern Mouth.\"239"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Daksinatantras 47 Can it be that the two types mentioned here were the first eight Bhairavatantras as one group and the remaining Daksinatantras as the other? That the Bhairavastaka existed as a group in its own right is confirmed by the Nityasodasikarnava which refers to it as constituting eight of the sixty-four Tantras that it enumerates (see below). The list of eight Bhairavatantras in the BY is further proof that this is so. Thus, if we identify Ugra with Canda and restore him to his place as no. 2 in the list, then the first four correspond exactly, while of the three not found in the Bhairavastaka only one is not found in the list of Tantras belonging to the Daksinasrotas.240 Finally, it is worth noting that, apart from these eight, not a single Tantra in the SKS's list corresponds to any of the Daksina­tantras noted in the PLSS. The reason for this seems to be that the first eight Tantras of the Daksinasrotas have been extracted from it to serve as the basic model for the astastakabheda, which although originally just a part of the Daksinasrotas assumed an independent status in a different sphere from the original Daksinasrotas. This appears to be clearly the case when we consider that the SKS retains the older classification as subsidiary to its own Trika-based exegesis of the Saivagamic corpus in which the Daksinasrotas now figures as consisting of twenty-four Tantras and not thirty-two. Is this not because the Bhairavastaka has been removed from it?241 The Bhairavastaka is not the only group which has acquired an identity of its own. Another important group is that of the Yamalas. In the Kamikagama, the Yamalas (without specifying their number) figure as a separate category which was not even specifically connected with the Saivagama although the possibility that Saivas could practice according to them was allowed for.242 In the BY they form a group of eight along with the eight Bhairavatantras and other Tantras in the Vidyapilha to which the BY itself belongs.243 The Yamalas are represented as forming a group of their own also in the JY; so too in the NSA244 which is probably older than the BY.245 There can be no doubt, however, that there were a good deal more than eight,246 and judging from the original Yamalas still preserved, many were probably of considerable length. Finally, Bahurupa and Mata are two divisions of eight found both in the SKS and the NSA indicating that they were also considered to be groups in their own right. Let us consider next the sixty-four Tantras as a whole. A comparison of the lists of sixty-four Tantras found in the NSA and in the SKS proves to be highly instructive from many points of view, both because of their similarities as well as differences. Firstly, it is a striking fact that there are hardly two titles common to both lists. This could perhaps be justified by saying that the SKS lists the sixty-four Bhairavatantras while the NSA lists what it calls the sixty-four Matrtantras. In this case, however, the"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"48 THE SAIVA AGAMAS expression \"matrtantra\" should not be understood in a technical sense, because the Tantras listed are far from forming a uniform group. Despite the wide divergence between these two lists of Tantras, there are also striking similarities between them. Thus, four groups of eight - as groups - coincide, although the members of these groups, as far as we can tell, are not the same. Indeed it seems that the layout in the NSA is a crude form of that found in the SKS. It is as if a neat scheme of eight by eight is what it is tending towards, having got barely half way with its three astaka-s named as such and the Mala Tantras which, although they do in fact constitute another group of eight, are listed individually. Moreover, it seems that the SKS's list is more contrived, less natural than that of the NSA which does seem, on the contrary, to be just a list of important Tantras prevalent at the time and place of its compilation, although the number sixty-four is certainly a symbolic figure. Thus in the SKS, titles are apparently added in places merely to fill out the eight by eight scheme; for example, the whole of the Cakrabheda does not appear to be a genuine record of Cakratantras. The names recorded are: 1) Mantra, 2) Varna, 3) Sakti, 4) Kala, 5) Bindu,6) Nada, 7) Guhya and 8) Khacakra. One could very reasonably argue that we have here not a group of Tantras, but a mystical ascent of consciousness in ordered stages (krama) expressed in the typical symbolic language of these texts. It seems, therefore, that the NSA list is the older of the two, which is certainly possible, as the NSA is older than the BY.247 That the system of classification in the BY is cruder than that of the SKS also suggests that the BY precedes it. Moreover, one could argue that the scheme of eight by eight Tantras rather than just sixty-four had not yet been formulated at the time of the redaction of the NSA but because the cult of Srividya continued to be sustained by a living scriptural tradition, the NSA furnished the model for the subsequent enumeration of the Tantras into sixty-four rather than eight by eight.248 If the NSA is indeed as old as the evidence seems to suggest, then we must assign a relatively early date to the Pascimamnaya insofar as the Kubjikamata figures in the NSA's list of Tantras. This means that the Pascimamnaya existed at the time of the redaction of the NSA, which is in all probability the first Tantra dealing with Srividya and the sixteen Nityas.249 This is not at all impossible because the Kaula scriptural tradition is certainly quite old - the Siddhantagamas are well aware of it (see below) as are the Tantras of other groups. The NSA itself lists three Tantras which can be said to be Kulatantras, namely, the Kulasara, Kuloddisa and Kulacudamani.250 It is difficult to assign dates to these texts. However, if we accept that they do succeed each other chronologi­cally in this way, it is not improbable that the Pascimamnaya originated at"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Pitha System 49 least two centuries before Abhinavagupta, that is, in the eighth or ninth century and is probably older. This is the most we can say at present. Before we proceed to the next section of our exposition, a few remarks remain to be made about some other Tantras listed by the PLSS as belonging to the Daksinasrotas. There are three Tantras we notice here in this list that we know to be Trikatantras, namely, the Trisiram (called \"Trisirobhairava\"or \"Trisiromata\"\\n Kashmir), the Nisisamcaraand the Siddhayogesvaram (or Siddhayogesvarimata).251 Their presence in this list establishes that these Tantras are old members of the Saivagama. If we accept that these are amongst the Daksinatantras which existed at the time of the compilation of the Siddhantagamas, there are good grounds to argue that they are older than some of them, at least. Thus, it transpires that Tantras teaching Trika doctrine and ritual already existed at the time of the formation of the Siddhanta as a coherent group of Saivagamas. Moreover, it may also be argued, in broader terms, that the Siddhanta's notion of itself as a group presupposes the existence of an older classification into four divisions to which it has added itself as an upper fifth. This is a standard pattern of development of the canon as we shall have occasion to observe again when we come to deal with the amnaya division of the Kulatantras and the place of the Pascimamnaya in it. The Pitha System of Classification The word \"pitha,\" in a non-technical sense, means a stool, seat or bench and, by extension, the pedestal upon which an idol is installed. In the Tantras it commonly means a sacred place. In this present context, however, it means a \"collection,\" or \"aggregate\" (samuha) with reference to a group of scriptures252 and so denotes a class of Agamas. It also signifies a range of matters that, taken collectively, concern a single Tantric topic. The two usages of the word are closely related: sometimes one applies, sometimes the other and, occasionally, both. In order to understand how the pitha system of classification works, we should first distinguish these two uses of the word. In order to do so, before we attempt to outline the contents of the pithas understood as categories of scriptures, let us see what pitha means as a Tantric topic. There are four pithas, namely, Vidya, Mantra, Mudra and Mandala-pitha. According to the BY, Tantras that concern themselves with one or other of these topics belong to the corresponding pitha.253 Abhinava adds that, insofar as the essential contents of the Tantras are basically the same."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"50 THE SAIVA AGAMAS the ascription of a particular Tantra to one or other of the pithas indicates the most dominant feature of its contents. In this sense, therefore, one can say that each pitha contains all the others.254 Thus the mandalapitha is a topic considered separately in its own right in the SYM,255 and mudra-pithadhikara is the name of chapter 52 of the BY, although both Tantras belong to the Vidyapitha.256 Similarly, in the Tantraloka, Abhinava deals with the basic Mantras, Mandates and Mudras of Trika Saivism individually in chapters 30, 31 and 32 respectively. In this way the pitha division can serve as a device by which a Tantra, although formally affiliated to one or other pitha, could say that it contains in itself the essential doctrines of all the other Tantras because it deals with all these matters. So we find that some Tantras, like the Svacchanda, claim that they consist of all four pithas and bestow the fruits of them all.257 We notice this same claim being made in the Pascimatantras. We are told that another name for the goddess Kubjika is \"Samaya\" the feminine form of the word \"samaya\" which means rule. As such, she is the Rule that is observed equally in both the Tantras of the Left and Right as well as in all four pithas.258 As Kundalini, she is the essence of the Kaula tradition and so the same 'rule' which prevails in all the pithas.259 We do, in fact, come across references to matter drawn from various pithas in the Pascima-tantras. Thus, for example, the Kularatnoddyota contains Mantras described as belonging to the Mantrapitha.260 Again, the KMT explains that the Mudrapitha is characterized by the joining of the two hands flat together. The left hand symbolizes creation (srsti) and the right, destruction (samhara). The union of the two is the 'Kundalini of the Self which is the Supreme Power, the primordial energy 'Beyond Mind' (manonmani). It is the Supreme Gesture (mudra) that brings about universal pervasion, and he who knows it, knows the entire universe. When the hands are joined, the emissive power of consciousness (visarga-sakti) rises up out of the genital region and comes to reside in the foundation of this Gesture by uniting creation and destruction.261 The pitha classification served an important function in the formation of the Saivagamic canon. Affiliated through this system of classification, Tantras not otherwise related could belong together in a group which expressed the coherence of the basic principles they taught. Affiliation to a pitha was a sign of an alignment not of schools or traditions, but of practice and application of method. Thus Rupasiva in his commentary called \"Vidhana\" on the Manthanabhairavatantra which is the root collection (mulasangraha) of the doctrines of the Kubjika school, associates the antinomian behaviour prescribed in Kulacara with the Mudrapitha.262 Parts of the Kaula ritual (kulaprakriya) described by Abhinavagupta in chapter 29 of the Tantraloka are ascribed to two"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Tantras of the Four Pithas 51 traditions (sampradaya), one linked to the Mantra and Mudra pithas and the other to the Vidya and Mandala pithas.263 The rituals relating to all four pithas are described here because, Jayaratha tells us, the scripture in this context is of these four types.264 Presumably what Jayaratha means here is that the pitha classification includes all the Saivagama although it refers in a special way to that part of it which is Kaula-oriented. Accord­ingly, in a short tract dealing with Kaula yoga called \" Yogapitha, \"of which there are early manuscripts in Nepal,265 the Lord of Kula is adored at the beginning as the consort of the goddess who is the presiding deity of the four pithas.266 It appears, therefore, that in some important aspects the pitha classification became the focus of a new and higher understanding that an important part of the Saivagama had of itself as Kaula-oriented. At the same time it allowed for the existence within this broad system of categorization for the existence of scriptures which did not expressly consider themselves to be Kaula as such and so served to link the two. The Tantras of the Four Pithas We turn now to the second aspect of the pitha classification, namely, \"pitha\"understood as a category of scripture. The BY makes use of this system of classification, integrating it somewhat awkwardly with a division of the scriptures into Left, Right and Middle currents. The BY's account of the pithas is sketchy and unsystematic - a sign that this system of classification is still at an early stage in its development. In the JY, on the other hand, the pitha classification is well worked out and the contents of each pitha clearly defined. Indeed, it has developed to such a degree that it has superseded the division into srotas, which is relegated to the level of a secondary, subsidiary classification. A detailed account of the JY's description of the contents of each pitha is found in appendix C, to which the reader is referred. Here we shall deal with the basic structure of these pithas and how they are related to each other and to other systems of classification. It appears that the Vidyapitha was the most extensive and important of the four pithas. Abhinava considered this pitha to be the highest, after which comes the Mantrapitha sustained by it.267 Again, the Mudra division follows the path of Mantra268 and is said to be its reproduced image (pratikrti),269 while the Mandalapitha is the lowest.270 This is also the order in which they are graded in the BY. The JY deals with the Mantrapitha first although the contents of the Vidyapitha are more extensive."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"52 THE SAIVA AGAMAS The pithas are also generally linked together in pairs. The BY treats the Vidya and Mantra pithas together and similarly considers the Mudra and Mandala pitha to be a pair.271 This agrees with Abhinava's exposition of the division of the pithas found in the Anandasastra which states: 'Pitha' [is a term referring] to a class [of Tantras]. It is of two types: right and left, called Mantra and Vidya respectively, from which are derived the two associated with Mudra and Mandala.272 Accordingly, we can represent the four pithas schematically as follows. See Figure 1. Figure 1. The Four Pithas. The Mudra and Mandala pithas seem to have been the least well defined of the four pithas. The BY enumerates the Tantras of the Vidya -and Mantra - pithas as belonging to the current of the Right but then simply states that the other two pithas include all the Mudras and Mandalas of the Tantras in all the currents of scripture.273 Similarly, the JY refers to only one root Tantra in the Mandalapitha and then simply states that this pitha is part of the contents of all the pithas. The Mudrapitha contains only three root Tantras of which one is the Kubjikamata.274 The Mantra and Vidya pithas are thus generally considered to be the most important pair and we shall therefore limit our discussion to them."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Mantrapitha   53   The Mantrapitha We start with the Mantrapitha because it is less extensive than the Vidyapitha and is a more compact category. The BY lists seven Tantras belonging to this pitha: Vlra, (Ugra?) Bhairava, Candabhairava, Gudaka, Bhairavi (?), Mahaviresa and Bhairava.275 The BY appears to be uncertain of the contents of this pitha. It lists two titles that are virtually the same (i.e., Vtra and Mahaviresa), and two entries - Bhairava and Bhairavi -seem to be incomplete. That the Candabhairavatantra is listed here is significant because this Tantra usually belongs to the standard group of eight Bhairavatantras, namely, the Bhairavastaka we have already discussed. In fact, it is this group that in the JY comes to constitute the Mantrapitha. According to the Sarvaviratantra, four of these Tantras belong to the Mantrapitha, namely the Svacchanda, Cauda. Krodha and Unmatta.276 Ksemaraja thinks that the Svacchandatantra belongs to this pitha and quotes the Sarvavira as an authority to support this view.277 The Svacchanda itself, incidentally, nowhere aligns itself specifically with any pitha although it knows this system of classification.278 The JY quotes the Sarvavira279 and appears to take the lead from this Tantra in its exposition of this pitha. Thus the JY takes the four Tantras mentioned above as the main Tantras of this pitha and links them systematically with the remaining four Tantras in the group of eight Bhairavatantras thus: Svacchanda - Asitanga Canda - Ruru Krodha - Jhankara Unmatta - Kapalisa If we place the right-hand column below the left, we have the eight Bhairavatantras in the order in which the JY enumerates them. It seems, therefore, that we can trace a line of development here from the BY through the Sarvavira to the JY. These Tantras must, therefore, also succeed each other chronologically. The Vidyapitha The Vidyapitha, as the JY presents it, virtually contains the three"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"54 THE SAIVA AGAMAS currents of scripture, viz., Left, Right and Middle. The JY has, however, rearranged their contents. The Siddhant agamas have been entirely excluded from the pitha classification.280 Therefore, the Middle Current is now vacant and a new category is created to take its place, namely, the Saktitantras. However, this is just a new name for old familiar Tantras amongst which are the Siddhayogesvarimata, the Sarvavira and the JY itself. It is worth noting that the SYM is regularly assigned to this .pitha. The BY does so and Abhinava tells us that it is this pitha which dominates in this, the root Trika Tantra, and hence also in the Malinivijaya, which presents the essentials of the former.281 In fact, the SYM itself tells us that it belongs to the Vidyapitha.282 The BY locates the Vidya and Mantra pitha in the current of the Right281 while the JY extends the Vidyapitha to include the Tantras of the Left amongst which are the Mahasammohana and Nayottara. Although the Vinasikha is not amongst the major Tantras, it may be the Sikhatantra listed as one of the secondary Tantras associated with the Sammohana.284 The Right Current of the Vidyapitha consists of the Yamalas amongst which the BY is considered to be the most important. The JY thus allots a major category to the Yamalas and they are, as we have already had occasion to remark, treated at times as a category on their own. The Tamil poem, the Takkaydgapparani by Ottakkuttar written in the twelfth century, frequently refers to the \" Yamalasastra. \" According to this work there are ninety-one secondary Yamalas and Tantras associated with the main Yamalas of which one of the most important is the BY.285 It is indeed an extensive and interesting work which deserves to be edited and care­fully studied. The Mantra and Vidya pithas are closely related, so much so that Jayaratha says that they stand for Siva and Sakti.286 Similarly, the JY states that the Mantrapitha is associated with masculine words and the Vidyapitha with feminine ones.287 Perhaps we can understand this to mean that the Tantras in the former group are more Siva-oriented than those belonging to the latter. The Svacchandatantra, which is said to belong to the Mantrapitha, is indeed markedly more 'Saiva' than the Siddha­yogesvarimata of the Vidyapitha which is more 'Sakta Moreover, Abhinava's statement that the Vidyapitha sustains and strengthens the Mantrapitha288 is exemplified in the context of the Trika exegesis of Saiva scripture by the secondary and yet vitally important place given to the Svacchandatantra which supplies, amongst other things, along with the Malinivijaya, the cosmology of the Trika. In Kashmiri circles the Vidyapitha was considered to be the most important of the pithas. Abhinava quotes the Kularatnamalatantra to say that Trika, as a Kaula school which embodies the essence of the doctrines"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"Vidyapitha   55   of the Tantras of the Left and the Right currents, is superior to them all.289 He does this immediately after he has extolled the superiority of the Vidyapitha, implying perhaps in this way that Trika as a whole belongs to this pitha. Thus Abhina va exalts the Vidyapitha as the ultimate essence of the other pithas by stating, on the authority of the Anandasastra, that all the pithas ultimately derive from the Vidyapitha in such a way that, as Jayaratha puts it: \"there is only one pitha which is of the nature of them all.\"29\" The Vidyapitha is also important in Nepal. Most of the Tantras preserved there, which affiliate themselves to a pitha, belong to this one. Amongst them are two texts which represent themselves as elucidating the essentials of the doctrines of this pitha. One is called \"Vidyapitha\"and is quite short291 while the other, the Srividydpithamatasara, claims to be 12,000 verses long.292 The Vidyapitha and its importance in Nepal is particularly relevant to our present study because major Tantras of the Kubjika cult affiliate themselves to it. The Manthanabhairavatantra, which is a mongst the most important Tantras of this school, belongs to this pitha293 and tells us that the goddess of this tradition resides in it.294 Certain manuscripts of the KMT bear long colophons that are very similar in form and content to those of the MBT and include a reference to the affiliation of the KMT to the Vidyapitha. As these colophons are not uniform in all the manuscripts, it is hard to say on the basis of this evidence alone whether the KMT did, in fact, originally affiliate itself to this pitha. Although, as we have noted above, the KMT does consider its doctrines to be the essential teachings of all theseptthas,295 it does not expressly say that it belongs to any pitha. Possibly the J Y is right to assign it to the Mudra-pitha. If this is so, it appears that later tradition shifted the KMT's affiliation to the Vidyapitha. Anyhow, many later Tantras of the Kubjika cult most certainly do belong to this pitha. Thus the Srimatottaratantra which is considered to be a direct successor of the KMT (which is also called Srimata) is a Vidyapithatantra,296 and so is a Tantra closely associated with it, namely, the Kadibheda of the Gorak sasamhita.297 To conclude the first part of this monograph, let us recall what K. C. Pandey wrote more than three decades ago concerning Saivagamic studies: \"How can any correct conclusion be possible unless all of (the Agamas) or at least a respectable number of them be carefully read?\"298 Indeed, we cannot say much about the structure, history and form of the Saiva canon without having access to. and carefully studying, the extant material in manuscripts which, although a tiny fraction of this vast corpus of sacred literature, is vast in itself. This is a major area of Indology which has, sadly, not even gone past the stage of preliminary assessment."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"PART TWO The Kaula Tantras"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"The Kulagama The Kaulatantras belong to such an extensive and important category of Agamic scripture that they can be considered to constitute a corpus in their own right which we can conveniently label \"Kulagama\". But although, as we shall see in the following pages, the Kulagama can be treated as an independent unit with its own subdivisions and internal distinctions, its link with the greater Agamic corpus is very close and consistently maintained. Thus, the Kaulatantras consider themselves to be essentially Saiva and venerate Bhairava as the highest God.1 Moreover, many Kaulatantras are not only affiliated to their own Kaula groups but also have a specific place of their own in the greater Saiva canon, usually as members of the Bhairavasrotas. Even so, one of the most striking features of these Tantras is their markedly Sakta character. Indeed, Kaula traditions are sometimes distinguished from one another, and their Tantras classified, according to the goddess who is at the focus of their complex Tantric system of Mantras, rituals and yogic practice. Kaula rites are generally private and, ideally, performed in secluded places such as lonely forests, mountains, deserts, cremation grounds or sacred centres where adepts, male and female (suddhas and yoginis), traditionally assemble. The deity worshipped is often (but not always) fearsome and adored with offerings of meat (including at times beef and human flesh) and wine as well as the male and female sexual fluids (kundagolaka) produced during ritual intercourse. The deity may be invoked to take possession of the worshipper so that he can gain its awesome power through which he perceives the deity's pervasive presence (vyapti) in all things. Many practices such as this one are designed to be fearful (bhayavaha); others, and these were particularly important for the refined Kashmiri Trika Kaula, are meant to delight the senses and mind (sukhavaha). The sacrificial offerings and ritual, in this case, induce the emergence of the innate bliss of consciousness (anancla). This inner, spiritual joy is cultivated as the adept's consciousness unfolds until he lays"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"60 THE KAULA TANTRAS hold of his own innate nature (svasvabhava), when consciousness reaches its most fully expanded state (purnavikasa). This process, therefore, entails a change in the modality of the adept's consciousness which takes place by the actualization of the latent inner spiritual power technically called \"Kundalini.\" When Kundalini awakens, it rises in the form of the Upward Moving Breath (uddnaprana), penetrating, as it does so, through successive levels of the cosmic order homologized to the microcosm of the adept's body. Finally, it merges, in the form of the vitality of the vital breath (pranasakti) and Mantra (mantravirya), into the universal breath (prdnana) and divine resonance of consciousness in the highest state of bliss, to then permeate all the lower levels it traversed in its ascent. In this way the delight of the senses becomes a means to liberation: one who is on the Kaula path drinks wine, eats meat and performs ritual intercourse in order to make the innate bliss of his own nature manifest - not out of greed or lust.2 The bliss the Kaula experiences is entirely spiritual and not at all worldly. The Kaula savours the objects of the senses not just for his pleasure but to use this pleasure to make consciousness more fully manifest and in so doing unite it with its object. When Kundalini rises, the fettered soul is elevated out of his state of bondage (pasutva) in which the experience of sensory objects deprives him of his authentic subjectivity and so becomes, like a sacrificial beast (pasu), a helpless victim of the forces of his own contracted consciousness. Accordingly, some Kaula traditions advocated symbolic substitutes for the meat, wine and sex, declaring that the essential point of Kaula practice is the arousal of Kundalini and the expansion of consciousness. The followers of these Kaula schools were, however, condemned by others such as the Kashmiri Trika Kaulas who, possibly closer to the original spirit of Kaula doctrine, insisted that these were essential and hence irreplaceable elements of Kaula ritual.3 The flow of Kundalini up through the lower levels, reabsorbing them as it goes into their ultimate source - the Nameless (anamaka) absolute Beyond Mind (unmana), and its return back down, recreating as it does so all the lower levels now experienced as one with consciousness, constitute the sequence of absorption and emanation (samhdra- and srstikrama) which are the two aspects of the dynamic power of consciousness, here called Kula.4 At the same time, as the pure consciousness which is the innate nature of all things and their universal cause, it is the source of this flow and the abode of rest where it reposes.5 As such, it is said to be the Supreme Bliss of one's own essential nature.6 This authentic Being is Akula - the male principle, while his cosmic outpouring (visarga) is Kula, his divine power - Sakti, the female principle.7 These two are worshipped as Kulesvari and Kulesvara. The union of these two principles - Kula and"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"Kulagama 61 Akula - is called the Supreme Kaula (param kaulam) which is both at rest in itself (santa) as well as rising out of itself (udita) in the form of its cosmic manifestation. Both these, Kula and Akula, are combined in Kaula doctrine.8 The philosophical standpoint of the Kaulatantras and that of their exegetes is essentially monist. Ultimate reality is Kaula - the fusion of opposites in which subject and object are united in the unfolding of consciousness which expands out into itself to assume the form of its universal manifestation.9 This reality can be realized by the performance of Kaula ritual without succumbing to doubt (sanka),10 that is to say, in a state of consciousness free of thought-constructs (nirvikalpa) in which the opposites, particularly the dichotomy of pure and impure, prohibition and injunction, are transcended. Kaula doctrine and practice is not confined exclusively to those Tantras which explicitly consider themselves to be Kaula: it is an important element of other Tantras as well - particularly those of the Varna and Daksinasrotas with which the Kaulatantras are closely related. Kula doctrine originates in these two currents of scripture and so is said to flow from them and extend them at their furthest limit.11 At the same time, it is present in all the Saiva scriptures, pervading them as their finest and most subtle element, like the perfume in flowers, taste in water or the life in the body.12 In fact, the expression \"Kaula\" can be used to refer to a typology of practice outlined in the Tantras as a whole, as well as to an identifiable part of them which is sometimes even specifically said to be such by the Tantras themselves. Thus the Netratantra describes the worship of Sadasiva, Tumburu and Bhairava in three separate chapters as representative of the three Saivasrotas, while the Kulamnaya is treated separately in a chapter on its own.13 This chapter, according to Ksemaraja, deals with Kuldmndyadarsana14 which he says is the \"undivided essence of the upper, left and right currents.\"15 Although the NT deals with Kaula ritual separately in a category of its own, this does not mean that the Kaula tradition is a newcomer whose Tantras need to be somehow accommo­dated into an older, already well-defined corpus,16 for we come across references to Kaula schools already in the Siddhantagamas as distinct groups alongside the Saivagama.17 The Kaula traditions were, in a sense, set apart from other Agamic schools due to their strictly esoteric character. As a Saiviteone could be initiated into Kaula practice, although this was to be kept as secret as was one's own Kaula identity.18 In fact, Kulasastra seems to have been developing alongside the Tantric schools of the Saivagama from an early period, influencing them while being influenced by them. It made sense, therefore, in view of this close symbiosis, that Kaula rites should find a place in Tantras which did not consider themselves to be specifically Kaula. We observe this phenomenon"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"62 THE KAULA TANTRAS particularly in the Varna and Bhairavatantras, while the Siddhanta, on the contrary, is virtually free of this Kaula element. An instance of the application and integration of this important dimension of the Varna, and more particularly of the Bhairavatantras, led to the development of Kashmiri Trika which, even though it originated in the Daksinasrotas, came to think of itself as Kaula. Kula schools seem to have proliferated to an astonishing degree.19 The number of Kulas were so many that they are referred to in juxta­position with the Tantras of the Saivagama as if the Kulas were as numerous as the Tantras themselves.20 In this context, \"Kula\"meant a line of transmission (santati) from master to disciple or a tradition (sampradaya)21 that was handed down in small monastic centres (mathika) and so was also called \"mathika. \"22 The Tantrdloka records one of the basic patterns of classification of these Kaula traditions, namely, the Siddhakrama (or Siddhasantati) originally established by four Kaula masters, each said to have been incarnated in one of the four Ages (yuga). They are, in due order: Khagendranatha, Kurmanatha, Mesanatha and Matsyendranatha.23 Each of these teachers had consorts while the last couple gave birth to (or initiated) twelve 'princes' of whom six were fit to impart Kaula doctrine and founded six distinct Kaula traditions.24 Following another system of classification, Jayaratha distinguishes between four basic types: Mahakaula, Kaula, Akula and Kulakula.25 A more common distinction is that made between Kula and Kaula, which the Nisisancdra and Bhairavakulatantra consider to be of ascending order of importance, with Trika as superior to both.26 The Pascimamndya also recognizes the distinction between Kula and Kaula and thinks of itself as separate from both.27 At the same time, it considers itself to be a Saiva (sambhava) tradition which combines both Kula and Kaula.28 In this tradition, both the male and female principle are worshipped, and so it is Kaula and leads to the blissful experience of both Siva and Sakti.29 What this means, apparently, is that the Pascimamnaya is closely associated with the Saivagama although its roots are in the Kula tradition, emerging as it does as both Kula and Kaula.30 Thus this tradition can say, without contradiction, that it is equally Kula as well as Kaula.31 This Kula/Kaula school is said to be of six kinds.32 These six are listed in the Kularatnoddyota as follows: ananda, avali, prabhu, yaugika, atita and pada, which correspond to the Kaula traditions established by the six princes generated from Matsyendranatha.\" The grouping together of these traditions (santati) is one of the many features the Pascimamnaya shares in common with the Trika (see below). The Kaula schools generally set themselves apart from one another'4 but the Pascimamnaya, like the"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"Mouth of the Yogini 63 Trika, prides itself in being higher than other Kaula schools because it includes them all within itself and does not make unnecesssary distinctions between them, although, of course, it maintains its own independent existence as a sastra to be followed without resorting to others.'5 The Mouth of the Yogini A characteristic feature of all Kaula traditions is that they consider themselves to be originally oral transmissions imparted in secret,'6 and the Pascimamnaya is no exception.17 The master imparted the teaching to the disciple who proved his worth, for it was felt that only in this way could the tradition be preserved and protected from the insincere. It is certainly true, as Abhinavagupta says, that there is a limit to what can be written and learned in books;'* the master is not, however, merely a source of extra information that cannot be found in the scriptures or simply a man who knows how to decipher their codes or interpret their subtle meanings. He is above all the vehicle through which the hidden power of their teachings is transmitted. He is the one who imparts the initiation which marks his disciple's entry into a new existential condition in which he is on the path to liberation, training himself through the grace of the deity (embodied in the master) to attain the enlightened state his master reached before him and thus perpetuate the transmission of the teachings. His constant companions and supports along his journey are the Mantras he was taught when, during his initiation, he made this transition. Full of the vital, living power of consciousness, Mantras can only be effective if imparted directly, properly intoned by one who has activated their hidden energy in his own consciousness. Written Mantras are powerless;39 they are as ineffective as lines drawn on water.40 Equally useless is any other spiritual practice learned from the dead letter of the written word. Thus the Pascimamnaya lays particular stress on the importance of the master. He is the sole essential element41 of this, the \"Tradition of the Master\" (gurvamnaya)42, also known as that of the \"Mouth of the Master.\"4' It is here that spiritual knowledge and Mantra reside, by virtue of which he is the Lord of the Pascimamnaya.44 In the Pascimamnaya, as in all Kaula traditions in general, women are thought to have a special role to play as the transmitters of Kaula doctrine for, as the saying goes, \"one should place wisdom in the mouth of a woman and take it again from her lips.\"45 She is the master's Tantric consort (duti) who, like the master, instructs the disciple and so is to be respected as his"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"64 THE KAULA TANTRAS equal in every way.46 She can also be the unattached yogini encountered by the adept (siddha) who, in search of yogic accomplishment, wanders on pilgrimage to the sacred places of the Kaulas where meetings take place.47 It is from her that the wisdom of the tradition is learned and how the rituals should be performed. The Manthanabhairava of the Pascimamnaya insists that there is no difference between the teacher and the yogini.48 The secret of all the scripture, the supreme essence of the oral tradition, is on the lips of the yogini.49 Thus she is venerated as the Supreme Power which bestows the bliss of the innate nature of all things (sahajananda) and is the embodiment of Bhairava's will.50 The yogini is the womb from which the enlightened yogi is born and her mouth, from which issues the tradition, is the sacred matrix (yoni), the triangle consisting of the powers of consciousness to will, know and act.51 As the womb (yoni) of creation, it is the Lower Mouth (adhovaktra) which is the essence of Kaula doctrine.52 This lower face is that of the yogini equated in the Trika with the Primary Wheel (mukhyacakra), namely, that of consciousness into which all the Secondary Wheels (anucakra) of consciousness - those of the senses, both physical and mental - dissolve away and from which they emerge.55 It is the Circle of Bliss (anandacakra) from which the energy of emission (visargasakti) flows forth as Kundalini, that is, as Kaulikisakti, who in the Pascimamnaya is represented as Kubjika, the presiding goddess. The 'Lower Mouth', which is the Mouth of the Yogini, is generally considered by the Kaula tradition as a whole to be the source of Kaula doctrine. From it flows the sixth current below the five currents of the Saivagama. The Lower Current is hidden there, below the faces of Sadasiva, symbolizing its esoteric character.54 By virtue of the monism of its doctrines, it is said to rise through, and permeate, the other Saiva traditions, leading them ultimately to the undivided bliss of consciousness which is the experience of Siva in His highest state (parasiva).55 The Pascimamnaya, like other Kaula traditions, calls this face \"Picuvaktra, \" i.e., the face of the yogini called Picu.56 It is the Face of the Nether Region (patalavaktra) from which creation streams forth.57 According to a system of classification outlined in the Satsahasrasamhita of the Pascimamnaya, the Agamas are divided into seven groups corresponding to the seven psychic centres in the body (cakra). The lowest centre is the Wheel of the Foundation (adharacakra), which is that of the Nether Region, followed by the five currents of the Saivagama spoken by the five faces of Sadasiva. Above these is the Wheel of the Uncreated (ajacakra). Schoterman explains that in the first - the highest - mouth resides Siva as Adideva together with the Adisakti, while in the seventh - the lowest - mouth resides the goddess as Guhyasakti: the union of these two mouths is the"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Mouth of the Yogini 65 goal.58 One of the points, it seems, that is being made here is that the Pascimamnaya is the highest of the Agamic schools and contains them all by combining within itself both the highest Kaula and the highest Saiva doctrines. The tradition which emerges from the yogini's mouth is called in the Pascimamnaya, a Saivasrotas.59 The Siddhantagamas also consider the Kaula tradition to be represented by two of eight subsidiary currents (anusrotas) associated with the five principal currents of the Saivagama. These two are called Yoginikaula and Siddhakaula. The Yoginikaula is so called because the yoginis heard it from Siva's mouth and kept it within their own line of transmission. The Siddhakaula is similarly originally derived from Saiva doctrine but is transmitted by Siddhas, the male counterparts of the yoginis.60 These two categories are well known in the Kaulatantras and are vitally connected with each other. In the Kaula-jnananirnaya, Matsyendranatha figures as the founder of the Yoginikula tradition which is especially associated with the fabulous land of Kamarupa,61 although he himself seems to have belonged to the Siddha, or Siddhamrtakaula.62 That Kaulatantras did, in fact, reflect on themselves as belonging to one or other of these two broad categories transpires from the characterization of the Urmikaulatantra as belonging to the Siddhasantana transmitted through one of its branches.63 The Yoginikula is mentioned in a work quoted by Jayaratha.64 The typifying characterization of these two classes by the KMT of the Pascimamnaya is essentially the same as that found in the Siddhantagama referred to above.65 The Pascimamnaya, consistent with its characterization of Kula doctrine as the tradition which expounds the essence of the teachings of the Yogini,66 considered itself to be the tradition of the yoginis (yoginikrama)67 and the secret of their oral transmission.68 Even so, Pascima doctrine is considered to be that of Siddhas of the Pascimamnaya69 and is not to be revealed to those who do not belong to the Siddhakaula school.70 There are places, however, where the Yoginikula is made to appear to be a part of the Pascimamnaya.71 Again, Kubjika, the presiding deity, is Kundalini, which is the essential teaching of the Yoginikula. Thus amongst the Kaula traditions originating from the sacred places (pithas), the Pascimamnaya presents the most vital doctrine of all the Kaula tradition72 - including the Yoginikaula. At its highest level, however, the Pascimamnaya agrees with the Yoginikula that the ultimate object of devotion is Siva (here called Sambhu). He is the abode of the Sambhava state and as such the Supreme Place that, although beyond all characterization, bestows infinite qualities.

Similarly, the term \"amnaya\" is used to denote distinct groups of scriptures within the Kulagama, each consisting of Tantras that share a common affiliation to a single tradition and said to have originated from a fixed direction. Our best example is the Pascimamnaya itself - the 'Western Tradition'. The amnaya system of classification did not include all the Kaulatantras. We are told in the texts of the existence of many Kula 'amnayas 'in the sense of 'traditions' or 'schools' without this implying that they belong to any systematic classification. It is in this broad, generic sense that we occasionally come across this term in the Siddhantagama.74 Indeed \"Kulamnaya\"'is a common way of referring to the Kulatantrasas a whole; it is synonymous, in other words, with \"Kulasastra\"or \"Kula-sasana\"in general.75 The amnaya system of classification is nowhere discussed by Abhinavagupta. This fact seems, at first sight, to indicate that the classification of Kulatantras (or at least of a part of them) as groups belonging to fixed directions (on the analogy of the Siddhanta classifi­cation) was a late development. Thus Tantras such as the Bhairavakula or Nisisamcara which thought of themselves as being Trika,76 divided the Saivagama into three main groups: Siddhanta, Varna and Daksina while distinguishing these from Kula and Kaula of which Trika was considered to be the culmination. They do not refer to the amnaya classification and so, presumably following their lead, neither does Abhinavagupta. Perhaps, therefore, we should not immediately assume that the amnaya classification postdates Abhinavagupta. Indeed, there is positive evidence which leads one to suppose that it did not. The KMT, which is generally considered to be the oldest recovered work of the Pascimamnaya77, postdates the Siddhayogesvarimata to which it refers specifically as the Tantra where the goddess Siddhayogesvari is exalted.78 Even so, as one of the sixty-four Tantras listed in the NSA, it can certainly be claimed to be prior to the ninth century (see above p. 48). Moreover, as noted above, Abhinavagupta himself refers to the KMT79 while it specifically considers itself to be \"the Path of the Pascimamnaya\"80 and also knows of the Uttara- and Daksina-amnayas which it respects as teaching valid doctrines.81 It seems also, in one place at least, to refer to the Purvamnaya82 Nor is it justifiable to suppose that this classification is peculiar to the Tantras of the Kubjika school as we shall see in the following exposition of the amnayas."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Amnayas of the Kaulatantras 67 The Amnayas of the Kaulatantras The division into amnayas seems to have been originally into four, with each amnaya symbolically set in one of the four directions. We have seen that the KMT knows only of four. The Yogakhanda of the MBT also refers to only four amnayas where they have a more tangible identity.83 They are represented as corresponding to the four Ages (yuga), with the Pascimamnaya as that which is most fit for the present Kali Age.84 In the Sat SS the amnayas are said in various places to be either five, six or even seven. The five-amnaya division is equated with the five vital breaths in such a way that the Pascimamnaya corresponds to the Pervasive Breath (vyana), the experience of which is the universal pervasion of conscious­ness to which the teaching leads.85 The division into five amnayas (formed by adding an upper one to the original four) is at times represented as spoken by the five faces of Sadasiva, following the basic Siddhanta pattern. The six-fold scheme can be formed by adding a sixth upper current \"beyond the upper\" (urdhvordhva), although a division into six is also possible by adding a lower current, an example of which we have already noted in relation to the five-fold Siddhanta pattern with Kula as the sixth.86 The former alternative is found in Trikatantras like the Bhargasikha where Trika is located above the Upper Face which is that of Isana,87 The four-fold division appears to be the oldest. This supposition is confirmed by the Kularnavatantra which characterizes the secret of the \"secrets more secret than secret\" (rahasyatirahasya) of its own Kaula doctrines as an upper-amnoya88 situated above the four amnayas to which the many Kaula traditions belong that are \"known to many.\"89 These five are here said to be spoken by Siva. The Samketapaddhati, an early'Kaula text,90 refers to just four amnayas.91 A four-fold division which, as in the Samketapaddhati, is equated with four metaphysical moments in the dynamics of ultimate reality, represented as aspects of the power Speech (bharatisakti) which issues from the four faces of the \"beginningless Mother\" - Mahavidya, is found in Amrtananda's Saubhagyasudhodaya which he quotes in his commentary on the Yoginihrdaya.92 An account of the spirituality and history of the four amnayas, from the Pascimamnaya point of view, is recorded in a short but interesting work called the Cineinimatasarasamuccaya. All the manuscripts of this text located up to now are found in Nepal.93 The CMSS claims that it belongs to the Divyaugha and is a compendium or essence of the Supreme Kaula doctrine of the Siddha tradition.94 It also implicitly identifies itself with a type of Tantric work common in the earlier period (i.e., prior to the"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"68 THE KAULA TANTRAS eleventh century), namely, a Sarasastra, by referring to a number of other Tantras of this type in its introductory section,95 while affirming that it presents the essence (sara) of the Kubjikamata. The four amnayas (here variously called vesman grha or ghara)96 are presented as originating from the Pascimamnaya which is the \"Source Tradition\" (janmamnaya) that possesses them all.97 Similarly, the MBT also says of it that it clearly manifests the four amnayas, the knowledge of which gives rise to the Divine Tradition (divyamnaya) and so is the highest of them.98 The Pascimamnaya is where all the sequences of inner mystical states of the other three amnayas, once abandoned and transcended, ultimately merge.99 As such, it is equated with the pure thought-free consciousness of the Sambhava state - Siva's inner experience of himself which pervades all the Kaula traditions. Thus, because it is also essentially Saiva,100 it is their ultimate goal, embracing as it does both Kula and Akula - Sakti and Siva.101 So, pure in all respects, and free of both virtue and vice (dharma and adharma), the Pascimamnaya is above all the other amnayas.102 Let us see then what the CMSS has to say about the Purva, Daksina and Uttara amnaya, after which we shall present our analysis of its views, to conclude with a short account of the Pascimamnaya. The Amnaya Classification and the Four Amnayas According to the Cincinimatasarasamuccaya Purvamnaya This amnaya is described as the Yoginimatasara present in both Kula and Kaula. The goddess manifests here in the form of the bliss of one's own consciousness. This tradition teaches the best Kulacara, namely, the manner in which Kula emerges in the womb of Kula. Thus, the goddess of this amnaya is Kulesvari who \"devours the Kumarikula.\" This tradition transmits the consciousness which pervades the Sky of transcendental reality and through it Trika was brought into this world. Trika doctrine is here embodied as Trika the goddess of three-fold form who is the Mistress of the Three Worlds (Tribhuvanesvari).

She arises from the three pithas and resides in their centre, pleasing to behold as the early morning sun and yet brilliant like a hundred million lightning flashes. She is the Passionate One, full of the passion (Kama) which devours Kumarikula desirous of herself. Kamesvari descends into the world in the form of a young virgin (kumarl). She melts the Circle of Birth of her own nature by her energy, and by the intent of her own vitality fills it. She is Kulayogini of divine form, peaceful and pure as translucent crystal. She has two arms, one face and three eyes and her waist is thin. She resides on the northern side of the Malini Mountain behind which is a bower (gahvara) called the Place of the Nightingale. It is filled with wild ganders, ducks and other birds of all sorts. Khecari, Bhucari, Siddha and Sakini reside there absorbed in meditation. There, in the Divine Circle of the Triangle, is located the cave called the Face of the Moon in which resides the goddess, the virgin who is the flow of vitality (sukravahini). Siddhas, munis (including Krodhamuni) and ascetics practiced austerities there for thousands of years, until they became aged and emaciated. Their gaze was averted upwards, to the Inner Face until they saw the goddess Sukra and thus attained the state of divine inebriation (ghurmyavastha) by virtue of her divine splendour. Once the goddess had transmitted this divine knowledge to them, Kamadeva appeared before her in divine form and 'melted' by the power of Kamesvari. Thus the two became one and gave rise to the Rudra Couple. The son born of this union was Kaulesa who taught this divine knowledge. In this amnaya, Kamesvari is described as the twelve-lettered Vidya, surrounded by twelve goddesses. Then come Vagesvari, Tripura, Vagabhava and Bhagamalim who are Kamesvari's powers (prabhava).

She is Kalesvari and practices Kaulacara, contains Kaula (kaulagarbha), is the arising of Kaula and is Trikaula. She resides in the Centre of Birth (janmadhara). This is the Supreme Tradition (paramamnaya), Divyaugha transmitted \"from ear to ear.\" It is Kalikakulakrama and is twelve-fold taught by Krodharaja and called Actionless Knowledge (niskriyajnana). From the centre of the sun (surya) emerges another Sun (ravi) which is the inner light that illumines the entire universe. It is surrounded by the rays of the Sun-goddess, Bhanavikaulini, also known as Kaulesvari and Kulagahvari. She is the rays of the Sun which shines in the centre of the sacrificial hearth of the Great Sky of the Ocean of Siva. The Great Mantra consisting of the sixty-four Bhairava wombs (yoni) arises and dissolves here. In the centre of (he Hearth of the Sun (bhanavikunda) is the Wheel of Dissolution which is one's own true nature (svasvabhava). Destroying both Being and Non-being, it is the Fire of Consciousness personified as the goddess Kulakrsodari. All this is the Supreme Brahman which is one's own nature (svasvabhava). We are then told that Niskriyananda \"made manifest in the world this nectar of Kula spoken by the yogini\" and so revealed the Mahakalikrama. The text goes on to describe its transmission to Vidyananda. Vidyananda practised yoga in the guise of a Siddhasabara. His residence was a cremation ground where he practised yoga at night and delighted in Kaula practice in the company of Siddhas and Viras. He worshipped the deity in a cave to the north of the Sivaputha known as Srisaila, wishing to attain Actionless Knowledge (niskriyajnana). His devotion was so intense that Niskriyanandanatha finally transmitted to him by word of mouth the secret of the Kalikakrama. This is called the Knowledge of the Left (vamajnana) and the Sequence of Sixty-five Stages. It is the dawning of the Twelve-fold Kali of Light (Prabhakali) in the Sky of Consciousness which arises there in the Sequence which Annihilates Destruction (samharasamharakrama), so called because the goddess devours all things. This, the Kalikrama, is the flux of Kula and yet is beyond it. It is the Divine Upper Mandala that, fully risen, transcends the mind as the emergence of consciousness that penetrates beyond every level of consciousness and the cosmic flux which it melts away with its rays. Thus the yogi drinks the incomparable nectar of immortality in the Supreme Sky of consciousness which unfolds spontaneously within him.

This, the Sequence of the Sun (bhanavikrama), is the life of every living being and illumines the mind as it rises in the Sky beyond the Sky, intensely aflame and burning up the Three Worlds. As this tradition teaches in this way the secret of both immanent Kula and transcendent Akula, it is called Kulakulamnaya. The twelve-fold goddess of this tradition is identified with the powers symbolized by the twelve vowels and is called Malini of the Sequence of Exertion (udyogakramamalini). The yogi who is truly established in his own nature contemplates this Great Supreme (mahakrama), the Kalikrama taught by Niskriyanandanatha. The names of the Twelve Suns which dawn as aspects of the Kali of Light (Prabhakali) are said to be the secret of the Kaulikagama. They are: the Kali of Creation (Srstikali), the Kali of Persistence (Sthitikali), the Kali of Destruction (Samharakali), the Kali of Passion (Raktakali), the Good Kali (Sukali), the Kali of Control (Yamakali), the Kali of Death (Mrtyukali), the Auspicious Kali (Bhadrakali), the Kali of the Supreme Sun (Paramarkakali), the Kali of the Great Sun (Mahamartandakali), the Terrible Kali (Rudrakali) and the Great Kali (Mahakali). Kumari is worshipped in the centre of the circle of these twelve powers. Analysis This account of the amnayas is striking both for the richness of its expression and the heights of the yogic experiences it conveys through the imposing visionary symbolism of the Kaula traditions it presents. The CMSS is later than the KMT and differs from its doctrinal position in many respects due largely to the development of Paseima doctrine (see below). Even so, this account is of value to the historian of Kaula Tantra and the Pascimamnaya because of what it tells us about the character of these traditions and their relationship to the Pascimamnaya. Particularly interesting from the latter point of view is the assignment of Trika to the Purvamnaya because of the close relationship that the Trika has with the Pascimamnaya - a point we shall deal with later when discussing how Pascima doctrine is built up and its historical antecedents. We shall therefore refer to it last after discussing the Daksina- and Uttara amnayas. Daksinamnaya It is clear from this account that the CMSS identifies the Srividya"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"74 THE KAULA TANTRAS tradition with the Daksinamnaya. The presiding goddess of this amnaya is Kamesvari who, initially alone, unites with Kamadeva. This broadly corresponds to the union of Kamesvari and Kamesvara in the centre of Sricakra locked in the sexual embrace of Kamakala. Kamadeva is the god of the seed-syllable known as 'Kamaraja' in the Srividya school. Amrtananda, a major early exponent of Srividya doctrine, clearly links this seed-syllable with the Daksinamnaya in just the same way as does the CMSS. In his Saubhagyasudhodaya, he characterizes the four amnayas, along with their attendant features, as symbolic aspects of one of the most important Mantras of this school, namely, the Mantraraja. Each amnaya contributes to the construction of this Mantra by supplying one of its seed-syllables. The seed-syllable Kamaraja belongs to the Daksinamnaya and is in the form of Rudra in union with his power, Rudrani. Together they form a couple (yamala). This seed-syllable is also linked to the Pascimamnaya as its protector.103 The CMSS also refers to the other three seed-syllables along with Tripura, as energies of the goddess Kamesvari. In the Srividya tradition they are indeed found together in the innermost triangle of Sricakra with Tripura in the centre and Vagesvari, Vagbhava and Bhagamalini in the corners around her.104 Nor can there be any doubt about the Kaula character of the Srividya school. The NSA describes the form of Srividya and her Mantra as rising in waves out of the infinite ocean of Kula105 as if to express her Kaula origins. Indeed, she is expressly said to be \"Kulavidya\" which is the Great Vidya of the yoginis.106 Accordingly, the Yoginihrdaya enjoins that she should be worshipped only by those who practice Kulacara.107 The Goddess Tripura is young and comely. Her eyes slightly red with wine -the perfect archetype of the Kaula female partner.108 Tripura is considered to be the greatest of the goddesses that preside over the phases of the cosmic cycles of time. These are the Nityas which the CMSS says originated in the Daksinamnaya. As Nitya, Tripura is Kula, the Supreme deity's sovereign power.109 The NSA and YHr, the original Tantras of this school, never refer to the amnaya system of classification. They do, however, talk about their own tradition as divided into four currents which issue from four sacred centres (mahapitha), namely, Kamarupa, Jalandhara, Purnagiri and Odiyana.110 However, the commentators, supported by early sources, equate these with the four amnayas.111 They also associate the four Yuganathas with the amnayas in a manner reminiscent of the Pascima characterization of the amnayas as each belonging to one of the four Ages. This connection also brings into the Srividya tradition an essential element of all Kaula ritual, namely, the worship of the Yuganathas. Thus, Srividya is said by Vidyananda in his commentary on the NSA to be common to all"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Analysis 75 the amnayas. He also says that it is particularly important in the Daksinamnaya,112 thus confirming that the allocation of Srividya to this quarter is not peculiar to the CMSS. In fact, the presence of Srividya is apparent in the Kubjikatantras. Thus, of Kubjika's three forms as a child, young and old woman, her young form is appropriately identified with the young and beautiful Tripurasundari.113 Uttaramnaya The way in which this amnaya is described in the CMSS is of interest not only to the historian of Kaula Tantra but also to the student of Kashmiri Saivism, particularly of that part of it which modern scholars call the Krama system, otherwise known as the Kramasasana, Krama-darsana or Kramanaya in Kashmiri sources as well as in the original Tantras themselves.114 The focal point of the spirituality of the Uttaramnaya is here presented as the experience of the Arising of the Sequence of Kalis (Kalikramodaya).115 The manner of their arising, as well as the order and names of the Kalis in this account, is virtually the same as we find in the Agamic passages quoted by Jayaratha in his commentary on Abhinava's exposition of the sequence of Kalis (kalikrama) in Anakhyacakra.116 Abhinava considered this to be the central teaching of the Krama system, which he syncretizes with the Anuttaratrikakulakrama (generally simply called \"Trika\") of which his Tantraloka is a comprehensive manual dealing with the liturgy of this Kaula-cum-Tantric school.117 Modern scholars of non-dualist Kashmiri Saivism generally distinguish between Kula and Krama as if they were two separate schools or, to use the current expression 'systems'. In the light of the evidence both from the recently recovered Agamic sources, as well as that afforded by the Kashmiri authors themselves and their references from the original scriptures, this distinction can be said to be clearly false. The Krama system is a Kaula tradition in every respect. The evidence is enormous in support of this view. We will only refer to a small part of it here, just enough to prove our point. In the Kramastotra, the first of the twelve Kalis is described as a wave of dense bliss which rises from the ocean of Kula118 and then merges again in the abyss of Kula. Ultimately, the last Kali in the series merges in Akula,119 which is represented generically as the Supreme Abode of the Goddess.120 In this way, Sakti as Kula merges into Siva as Akula, having emerged out of her infinite potentiality and traversed through the entire"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"76 THE KAULA TANTRAS cycle of manifestation, which is nothing but the expression of her own nature.121 Thus the two, Kula and Akula, constituting the Supreme Kaula reality (paramakaula), encompass all of manifestation as an inscrutable union of immanence leading to transcendence and transcendence to immanence. This is pure Kaula doctrine. Similarly Krama ritual, like Krama doctrine, is Kaula. That Krama ritual at times required the offering and consumption of meat and wine as well as ritual sex is well known to scholars of Kashmiri Saivism.122 In Abhinava's exposition of Kaula ritual in chapter 29 of the Tantrdloka, he refers to a number of Krama works,l23 as does his commentator Jayaratha. These include the Kramapujana,124 Kramarahasya,125 Devipancasatika,126 Kallkula,127 Madhavakula,128 Srikulakramodaya129 and Tantraraja-bhaffaraka.130 The Madhavakula, which is a part of the Tantraraja-bhaffaraka that Kashmiris considered to be a major authority on Krama, refers to the type of ritual it expounds as Kulapujana.131 Abhinava refers to the Kramapujana132 as an authoritative Tantra in which the Supreme Lord explains the secret essentials of Kula ritual, namely, the worship of the Yuganathas and their consorts, which is a standard necessary preliminary of all Kaula ritual. Thus Abhinava refers to a Krama text as his authority right at the beginning of his exposition of Kaula ritual. Similarly, in the CMSS the Yuganathas and their consorts are worshipped in the Purvamnaya which in the course of practice comes first, located as it is in the East.133 Jnananetranatha (alias Sivananda) is venerated by Kashmiri Krama authors as the founder of the Krama tradition of which they are direct descendants.134 He \"brought down to earth\" a Krama work called the Yonigahvaratantra135 in which he lists the names of the Yuganathas and their associates, proclaiming that they taught the secret of the Kula path (kulamarga).l36 It is not surprising, therefore, that Krama is also known as the Kalikula137 or Kramakula138 in the Agamic sources to which Kashmiri authors refer. In short, it appears that although Krama is an independent school (with many subdivisions of its own) it cannot be distinguished from Kula but is, in fact, one of its branches.139 We turn now to the next point, namely, the Kalikula's identity as Uttaramnaya. In MahesvarSnanda's time (thirteenth century) the Krama system he adhered to and which he traces back to Sivananda (so aligning himself unequivocally to the Kashmiri Krama tradition) was considered to be Uttaramnaya. MaheSvarananda refers to it as \"Auttaramnaya\"twice and as the \"non-dual principle of Uttara\",140 which was originally taught by Bhairava to Bhairavi141 and ultimately transmitted to him as the Krama doctrine he expounds in his Maharthamanjari.142 By extension he also calls this doctrine that of the \"anuttaramnaya\"143 as \"the philosophy of absolute (anuttara) non-dual consciousness\"144 which leads to liberation in"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"Analysis 77 this life in which freedom and enjoyment (moksa and bhoga) are united. Although, as we have already had occasion to remark, neither Abhinava nor the Kashmiri authors before him refer to the Krama system as Uttaramnaya, there is evidence to suggest that it was known as such to some, at least, of the earlier Tantras, although this may not have been its original identity in the earliest sources.145 Thus the colophons of the Yonigahvara by Jnananetranatha state that this Tantra belongs to the Orikarapitha of the Uttaranmaya146 and says of itself in the body of the text that it is \"the tradition of the Great Teaching,\" and \"the essence of the Northern Kula.\"147 Similarly, the colophons of the Devipancasatika declare that this Tantra, which deals with the Kalikakrama, belongs to the Northern Tradition.148 It transpires from this evidence that, although we can talk of a \"Kula system\" as a doctrinal standpoint in the context of Kashmiri Saivism as well as Hindu Tantricism in general, the generic meaning of the term \"Kula,\" when it is used to refer to the entire Kaula tradition with its many schools, is not to be confused with the former sense. Similarly, it appears that the term \"Krama,\" like \"Kula,\"also conveys a broad generic meaning. It refers, in one sense, to the sequence of actions in Kaula ritual, the order of recitation of Mantras, deposition (nyasa) of letters or the seed-syllables of Mantras on the body or on a mandale, image or other representation of the deity and its surrounding entourage such as a pitcher or the sacrificial firepit.149 \"Krama\" can also mean the liturgy or ritual itself and so is virtually synonymous with the term \"prakriya.\"150 Again the term \"Krama,\" variously qualified, can serve as the appellation of a Kaula school. Thus the Kashmiri Krama system as a whole is at times called \"Kalikrama\" although the term also refers to the order of the sequence of Kalis worshipped in the course of certain rituals or as a series of states of consciousness. Similarly, the Kubjika school or Pascimamnaya is also sometimes called \"Srikrama.\"151 \"Krama\" and \"Kula\" are in this sense, to all intents and purposes, virtual synonyms: the expressions \"Kalikula\"and \"Kalikrama\" are interchangeable, as are the terms \"Srikrama\" and \"Srikula.\" The term \"Krama\" lays emphasis on the typical ritual form a particular Kaula school exhibits, while the term \"Kula\" stresses its doctrinal affiliations and individual identity as a specific Kaula tradition. Thus the combination of the two terms, as in the expressions \"Kalikula-krama\" or \"Srikulakrama\", although hardly different from \"Kalikula\"or \"Kalikrama\", etc., focus primarily on the character of these schools as possessing distinct liturgies of their own. Again, there appears to be a distinction between Kaula schools which were \"Kramakulas\" (or equally one could say \"Kulakramas\") and those that were not, in the sense that the Tantras of these schools do not align themselves with any Krama. This is"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"78 THE KAULA TANTRAS true generally of independent Kaula traditions which had no place in the amnaya system of classification. Although the Pascimamnaya is a substantial Tantric tradition with a clearly defined identity of its own, and its Tantras contain much that is original, it is, at the same time, built up of diverse elements which it draws from various sources, particularly other Kaula schools. This is a feature common to all these schools in general.152 Thus, a way in which we can better understand the Pascimamnaya in the broader context of the many Tantric schools which constitute the Agamic tradition as a whole is through a careful analysis of its constituent elements. By pursuing this approach, we can study the Pascimamnaya as a living tradition whose growth is marked both by the development of its own new ideas and the accretion of others. From this point of view, the integration of Kali worship into the Kubjika cult is significant. In the CMSS the mysticism of the Kallkula is assigned to a high level. Of the Four Doors of Kula (Kuladvara), which constitute Kaulacara, the highest is the experience of the Immaculate (niranjana) attained through the Arising of the Sequence of the Cycle of Kalis (Kalicakrakramodaya), that is, the Wheel of Time. The yogi who contemplates its successive phases assimilates through it into his own consciousness the one Ultimate Reality which is both the multiplicity of diversity and unity of oneness.153 This sequence is that of Anakhya (the Inexpressible), which is a well-known feature of the Krama system.154 According to the KMT, Kali (as Kalasamkarsini or Guhyesvari) is merely a minor manifestation of Kubjika.155 In the KNT, which postdates the KMT, Kubjika is occasionally considered to be a form of Kali called \"Kakali\", which is probably an abbreviated form of \"Kubjikakali.''156 The MBT, which is later than the KMT, but probably earlier than both the CMSS157 and KNT, identifies Kali with Kubjika, the Supreme Goddess.158 Moreover, the Srikrama of the Kubjika school and the Kalikrama are juxtaposed as two Kramas, one belonging to the Western Tradition Pascimamnaya and the other to the Northern - Uttardmnaya.159 By the time we reach the CMSS, the Kalikrama is fully integrated into Pascima doctrine and they are vitally linked together by their common esoteric Kaula character. Before we conclude this section and proceed to discuss the Purvamndya and its relationship to the Kubjika school, we should take note of an important historical reference in the CMSS's treatment of this amnaya, namely that the cycle of Kalis here described was taught by Niskriyanandanatha to Vidyananda. The CMSS agrees here with other sources, according to which the line of transmission of the Kalikrama teachings is as follows: Niskriyanandanatha (consort Jnanadipti) -"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"Analysis 79 Vidyananda (consort Rakta) - Saktyananda (consort Mahananda) -Sivananda (consort Samaya). We are told by Jayaratha that these teachers and consorts are worshipped as a standard part of the preliminaries to Kaulapuja in works such as the Devipancasatika and the Kalikula.160 The Yonigahvara refers to this line of teachers directly after the standard group of Yuganathas and entourage,l61 and so integrates the two groups as those of Kauia masters who are all equally worthy of veneration.162 There seems to be little reason to doubt that the Niskriyananda and the Vidyananda of the CMSS are the same as the teachers mentioned in these sources. However, although the fact that Niskriyananda figures in the CMSS as the revealer of an original transmission is significant, this is not in itself enough evidence to prove that he was the founder of the Krama system as a whole. Perhaps we may attribute to him the distinction of having been the first to have realized this particular sequence of Kalis.163 But before saying anything definite about this, we must first examine the earlier Agamic sources to understand the historical antecedents of the Krama system as a distinct school. The Purvamnaya The CMSS clearly identifies Trika with the Purvamnaya through which the original Kaula teachings were transmitted by the Yuganathas. Thus the masters which every Kaula, whatever school he may belong to, should venerate as the founders of Kaulism as a whole are here all made to belong to the Trikamathika. We do not possess enough of the early sources to be able to compare directly what the original Agamic Trika tradition has had to say about this. Fortunately, however, Abhinavagupta explains in his Tantraloka how Kaula ritual should be performed by Kashmiri Trika Saivites. The way in which Abhinava conceives the relationship between the Yuganathas and the Trika principle (and hence, by implication, their relationship with Trika Saivism) agrees well enough with the CMSS for us to be reasonably sure that Abhinava must have based his account on Agamic sources. Moreover, although he deals with several Kaula rites described in different Tantras, he is not solely concerned with them alone but seeks, in broader terms, to explain the method (prakriya) that underlies all Kaula ritual. In other words, what he has to say is, from his point of view, universally applicable by all Kaula Saivites. This is particularly true of the worship of the Yuganathas, which he describes at the beginning of his account, to which we now turn. As a prelude to the rite proper, the officiant must first purify himself."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"80   THE KAULA TANTRAS He does so in this case by projecting the Para and Malini Mantras onto his body in the prescribed manner and, once filled with their cosmic power, then identifying himself with Bhairava. He now offers libations to Bhairava and the circles of his energies that surround him, which are identified with the officiant's own sensory and mental powers. This is done by drinking a mixture of male and female sexual fluid (kundagolaka) from a sacrificial jar previously filled for this purpose. According to Abhinava, the officiant attains in this way a vision of the fullness of his universal nature which has been rendered brilliantly manifest by the energy of the sacrificial offering. He has, therefore, no need to do anything else unless he wishes to see this same fullness manifest also in the outer world through the outpouring of his sensory energies, in which case he proceeds to perform the outer ritual.164 This begins, as usual, with the worship of the Kaula teachers in a sacred circle (mandala) drawn on the ground with coloured powders. The form of this mandala, called \"siddhacakra\", is basically as we have illustrated it here. See Figure 3. The Yuganathas with their consorts and disciples are worshipped in the inner square.

Moreover the names of the ovallis and plthas associated with the Six Princes, according to the CMSS, agree exactly with Abhinava's account and the Kulakridavatara, which Jayaratha quotes in his commentary.166 Note, incidentally, that the names of the ovallis in these accounts do not quite agree with the KRU (see above p. 62). Abhinava does not record the town (nagara) associated with the Six Princes but lists instead their ghara (literally \"house\") and palli (literally \"village\"). More interesting than the coincidence of these details is the formation and identity of the triangle in the centre of the mandala. Abhinava explains the form of this triangle and the way in which it is worshipped in his Paratrimsikavivarana.167 The triangle represents the divine matrix"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"82 THE KAULA TANTRAS Irani), in the centre of which resides Kulesvari, in her aroused state, in union with Paranandabhairava from whom flows Kula, the blissful power of emission (visargasakti), through which the cosmic order is generated. The triangle (whose microcosmic equivalent is the female sexual organ) is worshipped by contemplating this creative flow of bliss in the unity of universal consciousness. This can be done either directly in elevated states of consciousness and /or through the ecstatic experience of physical orgasm. It seems that the CMSS refers to this distinctly Trika practice when it remarks that the goddess emerges from the centre of its energies along with Paramanandabhairava (see above p. 69). In this way \"Kula emerges in the womb of Kula\" (ibid.) and the worship of the Yuganathas bears fruit. The mandala in which the Yuganathas are worshipped is divided into five sections, namely: 1) the Mantras of the Trika goddess, 2) the Kaula masters, 3) the sphere of the flux of the Wheel of Malini which corresponds to the vital breath, 4) the sphere of the Wheel of Matrka corresponding to the activity of consciousness, and 5) the outer square representing the senses. These together constitute Kula, the micro- and macro-cosmic Totality. In the centre resides Kulesvari who can be worshipped in the form of any of the three Trika goddesses, either alone or with Kulesvara, her consort.168 We can conclude, therefore, that the CMSS records, in broad terms, the manner in which the Yuganathas are worshipped in the Trikakula. Associated with the Purvamnaya, they are the first to be worshipped in the order of the amnayas and so accorded a peculiarly high status, which at the same time sets them apart from the Pascimamnaya and its own line of transmission, while integrating them into it. We move on now to our next object of enquiry, namely, the relationship between these amnayas and Trika. The Kularatnoddyota repeatedly associates the Purvamnaya with the Pascimamnaya. The Kaula tradition with which this Tantra is associated develops, it says, in these two forms.169 Thus the KRU at times combines both together. For example, the fire ritual, mandala and initiation is said to be explained in accord with the ritual procedures of both traditions.170 At the same time, however, the two traditions are also distinguished. Thus it is clearly stated in places that the rituals and doctrines of this Tantra are basically those of"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"Analysis 83 the Pascimamnaya, which has incorporated elements of the Purvamnaya. For example, in a sequence of sixty-four energies divided in the usual pattern of eight times eight (which in this case are eight energies associated with eight sacred places), the eight powers (matr) belonging to Prayaga are said to originate from the Purva tradition.171 But even though the KRU admits that it has borrowed from the Purvamnaya, it maintains that the Purvamnaya as a whole is derived from the Pascimamnaya and that this is why they are essentially similar. The Purvamnaya is a direct offshoot of the Kubjika tradition and is similar to it in every respect, just as a reflection is a reproduction of the reflected object.172 The KRU's account of the origin of the Purvamnaya associates it with Mitranatha, a well-known Pascima master. Mitranatha was a direct disciple of Vrksanatha who, as an incarnation of the goddess Kubjika, brought the Pascima teachings down into the world during this Era.173 Accordingly, insofar as the Purvamnaya is derived from Pascimamnaya in this way, the goddess enquires how the Purvamnaya arose from it.174 The account of its origin which follows is basically a variant of many similar myths which explain how Matsyendranatha received the Kaula teachings.175 Here the story goes that Parvati taught the Purvamnaya to her son, Skanda, secretly from a book. For some unexplained reason Skanda became angry and in a fit of rage threw the book into the sea where it was swallowed by a fish (minaka). In the belly of this fish resided a great Siddha who read the book and practiced the yoga it taught and so grew powerful and full of splendour. From the belly of this fish emerged Adinatha in the form of Matsyendranatha. A connection is here clearly being made between the first Kaula teacher of this era, Matsyendranatha, and the Purvamnaya, as it is in the CMSS. However, the KRU does not equate the Purvamnaya with Trika, although it knows of the Trikatantra as an independent group which it mentions along with the Siddhanta, Varna, Bhuta and Garuda Tantras as well as the Kapalika Somasiddhanta, amongst others.176 In a long list of Tantras177 at the beginning of this work, the Siddhadevimahatantra is mentioned which is clearly none other than the Siddhayogesvarimata. We have already noted that both CMSS and KMT refer to this, the root Trikatantra. Indeed, there can be little doubt that Trika is an important element of the Pascimamnaya. Thus the worship of the three goddesses, Para, Parapara and Apara, which is a distinguishing characteristic of Trika, is an important feature of the Kuojika cult as well.I78 Their Mantras are the same as those of the Trika,179 as are those of the male consorts associated with them, namely, Bhairavasadbhava, Ratisekhara and Navatma.180 Triads in general are a prominent feature of the Pascimamnaya; we often"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"84 THE KAULA TANTRAS find groups of three related to one another.181 The goddess Kubjika herself is three-fold in the form of a young girl, maiden and old woman.182 Moreover, she is explicitly said to be three-fold as the union of the goddesses Para, Pardpara and Apara. An important triad is here, just as it is for the Kashmiri Trika, that of Sambhava, Sakta and Anava, which are three basic ritual patterns at one level, and at the inner level of conscious­ness correspond - as in the Trika - to will, knowledge and action. Cosmic counterparts are attributed to them in the form of the Three Worlds into which the universe is divided.183 The whole of the teaching is similarly divided into these three types,184 which is why there are three types of initiation (devidiksa) through which the Srlkrama becomes manifest.185 Even more vital and fundamental than these similarities are the basic forms of the Mantric codes adopted by the Kubjika cult, namely, those of Sabdardsi and Mdlini.186 They are the very backbone of the entire Mantric system of this tradition, just as they are of that of Trika, so much so that the god tells the goddess in the KRU that: The Trikatantra will be constructed by the conjunction of the parts primary and secondary, of the three Vidyas along with Malin'i and Sabdarasi.\"187 Although the use of the future here implies that the god is going to make Trikatantra after the revelation of the Kubjika cult, there can be little doubt that Trika precedes the Kubjikatantra and it is the latter which has borrowed from the former, not the other way around. Indeed, in places these Tantras themselves inform us that they have drawn elements from Trikatantras.188 Moreover, the oldest known Pascimatantra, the Kubjikamata, must be later than the first Trikatantra, the Siddha-yogesvarimata, because it refers to it. Again, the MBT and KRU both know Trika as Trika. This means that they were redacted when Agamic Trika had reached an advanced stage of development because the earliest Tantras that taught Trika doctrine and ritual, such as the SYM, did not consider themselves to be Trikatantrasas such.189 Thus the KMT, which is earlier than the MBT and KRU, does not refer to Trika as a school, possibly because it precedes this phase of Trika's development. Whether this is the case or not, it it a significant fact that the later Pascimatantras know of Trika's existence especially because reference to Trika is rare in the primary sources. Moreover, that the CMSS knows the Trikasdra, an extensive Trikatantra frequently referred to by the Kashmiris, shows that the followers of the Kubjika cult continued to consult Trika sources throughout its development. I90 It is significant, from this point of view, that it is in Nepal, where the Kubjika cult flourished, that the Siddha-"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Kulatantras and Saivagama  85  yogesvarimata has been recovered. This is probably because it was felt to be related to the Kubjika cult and so was copied and preserved. The Kulatantras and Saivagama Before we move on to discuss the Pascimamnaya, we take this opportunity to sum up what we have said up to now about the develop­ment of these Kaula traditions. Firstly, we should emphasize that the essential features of Kaula doctrine and ritual are by no means exclusive to Tantric works which call themselves Kaula. Practically all that is generally considered to be the ritual, yogic practice and life style of a Kaula (whether itinerant ascetic or householder) can be found prescribed in the Bhairava-lantras. The JY, SYM, BY and Bhairavatantras of this sort all seem at first sight highly Kaula in character. They themselves, however, do not consider themselves to be such, even though they do sometimes describe rituals that they specifically state are Kaula. Indeed, this fact only serves to make the contrast between them and the Kaulatantras even more striking, despite much that they seemingly share in common. How then are we to distinguish a Kaulatantra from other Tantric works? The reply to this question lies essentially in what a given Tantra says about itself and its relationship to other Tantras and Tantric traditions. A Kaulatantra will itself tell us that its dominant concern is with Kaula doctrine which it labels as such in its own terms. This is a simple principle of general application in trying to assess to what type a Tantra belongs. As we have already noted, the earliest Tantras which Kashmiri Saivites refer to as original sources of Trika doctrine are not, in this sense, Kaula. It makes sense, therefore, that according to Abhinavagupta the Malinivijayottaratantra which he considers, along with the SYM, to be the most important Trikatantra, refutes Kaula doctrine. Although he says that it goes beyond Kula doctrine, in fact it belongs to the strata of Trikatantra which had not yet become Kaula (or a 'higher' Kaula) in the way that it is for example, in the Bhairavakulatantra or Kularatnamala. The same is true of the Kalikrama. The Tantrarajabhattaraka (alias Sirascheda or Jayadrathayamala), to which the Kashmiris refer as an authority for certain points of Krama doctrine, is a sophisticated Tantra which typologically can be said to be highly Kaula in character; it does not, however, define itself as such even though it does deal with Kaula ritual in places.191 Therefore, we cannot say that this Tantra belongs to the Kalikrama in the specific sense of the term, although it is certainly concerned in parts with the worship of Kali in many forms and is full of"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"86 THE KAULA TANTRAS typically Kalikrama notions. Other, probably later, Tantras of the Kali cult were, however, Kaula and conscious of themselves as Kalikrama Tantras. One could say that the Kalikrama, like Trika, acquired a specific independent identity as a Tantric tradition when it became conscious of itself as Kaula. Moreover, at this stage of its development we can begin to identify figures in the line of the Agamic Kali cults who brought Tantras 'down to earth' or transmitted the oral tradition of the Kalikrama which finally emerged in Kashmir, fashioned at the hands of the Kashmiri authors, as a fully fledged system, not just a mass of ritual details or scattered visions in chaotic scriptural sources. We can trace a continuity from the virtually total anonymity of the earliest scriptural sources of the proto-Krama and proto-Trika, namely, the Bhairava and Varna Tantras, to the more distinctly sectarian Kaula-tantras of the Trika and Krama, right up to the extra-canonical exegetical works of monist Kashmiri Saiva authors. In this way, by the middle of the ninth century, they emerged out of the world of the Saiva Agamas into that of the sastras. For at least two centuries these two worlds of discourse remained vitally linked through the Tantric adepts who belonged to the line of transmission of the Agamic teachings and served as living sources of their hidden meaning. Although we have taken a leap outside the ambit of Saiva scripture into a different dimension of discourse, the line of transmission is linked to that of the canonical works themselves. In other words, the Trika and Krama schools matured to this level following the pace of a progressively more refined hermeneutics of the Tantras'esoteric meaning, which developed in the oral traditions. It was Sambhunatha -Abhinavagupta's Trika master - who gave him the basic exegetical Trika-based model upon which the culminating work of the Trika tradition - the Taniraloka - is based. Again it appears that it was largely due to him that Trika was taken to be the apogee of monist Kashmiri Saivism, for there can be no doubt that Trika is far from the central focus of monist Kashmiri Saivism before Abhinavagupta. To get back to the point: when the Krama emerged as a self-conscious Kaula cult, it seems that it also became conscious of itself as one of a group of amnayas. Whether these two events are concomitant or not, that is, whether the Kalikrama as an independent Kaula tradition knew itself right from its inception as the Uttaramnaya or not, it certainly did so at some stage of its development. The Trikakula on the other hand, it seems, never thought of itself as belonging to an atnnaya even though the CMSS refers to Trika as the purvamnaya. This is probably why the Kashmiri Saiva authors ignored the amnaya system and preferred to relate the Trika - as a 'higher' Kaula tradition - to the Saivagama as a whole, just as the Agamic Trika itself did."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"Pascimamnaya 87 The Tantras of the Kubjika cult were, however, it seems, Kaula right from the start and thought of themselves as belonging specifically to the Pascimamnaya. We know that the KMT is older than the JY - a proto-Krama Tantra - which refers to it (see appendix C) and that it is also older than the NSA. The JY is well aware of an independent current of Kaula scripture although it does not say specifically that the KMT belongs to it. Are we therefore to assume that the Kalikula already existed at the time and that it represented an Uttaramnaya in relation to the Kubjikatantras? Or is the KMT the oldest extant type of amnaya-oriented Tantra? We have already noted that it nowhere clearly defines the amnayas of the other directions, although it refers to them. Could this be because they were simply empty categories? In other words, did they have no more than an ideal existence as mere logical complements to an existent Pascimam­naya? If we accept this hypothesis, we are led to consider the possibility that the Kalikrama accommodated itself later to this pattern, as did the Srividya tradition in a less certain manner. Perhaps, on the other hand, it would be better to think of them as developing together with their roots firmly embedded in the Saivagama, drawing life from it and growing out of it, as well as alongside it. The Pascimamnaya - The Cult of Kubjika Some scholars have assumed that the cult of Kubjika is of Nepalese origin largely because virtually all the manuscripts of the Tantras of this school are Nepalese.192 This assumption is not, however, supported by the texts themselves. They do say that this school originated in a mountainous region, probably the Himalayas (see below), and make the point that it spread throughout India. Even so, Nepal is hardly mentioned as a place sacred to the goddess,193 while the Nine Nathas who are said to have propagated the doctrine of Kubjika in our times, although all of North Indian origin,194 are not Nepalese. However, wherever it may have originated, the cult of Kubjika was known in Nepal by the first half of the twelfth century A.D. - the date of the oldest manuscript of the K.MT.195 The great abundance of manuscripts of Tantras and related works belonging to this school copied from this time up to the seventeenth century testify to its popularity there during this period. Judging from the number of manuscripts copied from this period onwards, the Kubjika cult seems to have waned in importance although it must have continued to command a small following up to quite recent times because a few manuscripts did continue to be copied right up to the present century. I"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"88   THE KAULA TANTRAS was informed during a recent visit to Nepal that Kubjika is still worshipped on certain occasions in the Kathmandu valley although her cult is now hardly known to anybody. Scholars have pointed out that references to Kubjika and her school are rare,196 nor are images of her common whether drawn or sculptured.197 This is true of another goddess associated with her worship and whose cult has similarly been popular in Nepal since the inception of the cult of Kubjika, namely, Guhyakali.198 The reason for this seems to be that such cults either disappeared along with countless others or else managed to survive only at the regional level. A prime example of this phenomena is Trika Saivism which, but for its following in Kashmir and the genius of those who applied themselves to it there, would probably be unknown. It is not quite right, therefore, to think of the Kubjika cult as a school which \"remained very independent and stood aloof from other Tantrik schools.\"199 In fact, one of the aims of future research into this school could be to identify, as far as the available sources permit, the various elements of other Tantric traditions which have contributed to its formation and to distinguish them from its own original contributions. Kubjika, the 'Crooked One' \"Kubjika\" is the feminine form of the Sanskrit word \"Kubja\" which literally means \"humped-back\" or \"crooked.\" Even so, although the Tantras of the Kubjika school describe many forms in which the goddess can be visualized, she is not commonly represented as bent over. It has been suggested, in order to account for this fact, that \"Kubja\"is a word of Munda origin200 that does not originally mean \"crooked.\" The Tantras do not, however, support this contention. Thus we find that Kubjika is also called \"Vakresvarl, \"Vakrika or Vakra because, as the Tantras explain, her limbs are crooked (vakra).201 Of her three principal forms as a girl (Bala), young woman (Kumari) and old woman (Vrddha), it is the last which, as one would expect, is associated with her crooked form.202 Perhaps this image of her as old and deformed is the reason why she is also called \"Khanjani\" which means literally \"she who walks with a limp.\"203 A myth recorded in the KRU that explains why she is bent over does not, however, relate this to herage.204 The story goes that Kubjika once sat with devotion to worship the union of the god with the goddess. The god then appeared to her and took hold of her hand as a prelude to union but she, overcome with apprehension and bashfulness, contracted her body, and so became 'Kubjika'. As such, she is equated with Kundalini who, when awakened,"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"Kubjika 89 becomes bent over with 'shame'.205 Again, Kubjika's crooked form relates to her nature as Kundalinl who is the matrix (yoni) or Triangle (srgata) from which creation pours forth and in which it resides. As such, she is bent over, not when awakening but when she is dormant, and the power of consciousness (cicchakti) is contracted, which is as one would expect, and is in fact usually the case in representations of Kundalinl. From this point of view, consciousness is 'straight', i.e., unconditioned when it is free of 'crooked' obscuring thought-constructs.206 From another point of view, Kubjika is said to be crooked because she must contract her limbs to reside in the body of Kulesvara just as someone whose body is large must stoop down when moving about in a small hut.207 While according to the Paratantra, she is bent over because she initially 'churns' her navel with her tongue to give birth to the universe within her womb.208 This is because, as the CMSS explains, the navel is the Great Matrix (mahayoni) from which Kundalini rises. Thus in this account Kubjika is bent over in order to stimulate her cosmic power which, rising through the body, leads the yogi to liberation.209 Kubjika is the Supreme Goddess (Para devi) where form is the divine light of consciousness that shines in the centre of the brilliant radiance enlightened yogis perceive.210 As such, she is the Great Mother they experience within themselves.211 As Kundalini she is pure bliss, the power of the Light which resides in all the six centres in the body (cakra) and so is of six forms.212 As the power of consciousness she is the source of all Mantras and as such has three aspects: Supreme (Para), Middling (Parapara) and Inferior (Apara). In this three-fold form she is, just as in Trika doctrine, Malini213 consisting of the fifty letters of the alphabet in a state of disorder, symbolizing the rising of Kundalini and the disruption of the cosmic order that takes place when it is reabsorbed into the Supreme Matrix (parayoni) - the goddess Kubjika - from whence it was originally emitted. At this level the goddess resides in the state which is Beyond Mind (unmanabhavatita) as Siva's divine power (sambhavasakii) to will, know and act. She has thus three forms (trirupa) and travels along the three paths (tripathaga)214 of the sides of the triangle of the organ of generation (bhaga) which is both the source and ultimate end of all creation.215 At the corners of this triangle are located the Mahapithas: Purnagiri, Jalandhara and Kamarupa. In the centre is Odiyanapitha where the goddess resides in union with the divine linga whose nature is bliss itself and whose seed (bindu) is the Sky of Consciousness.216 In the centre Akula and Kula unite, while the goddess, as Rudra's power (rudrasakti), pervades each part of the triangle and lords over it as the Mistress of Kula (Kulesvari) who is also called Mahakaulika and Bhairavi.217 According to the CMSS, the form in which Kubjika resides in the"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"90 THE KAULA TANTRAS centre of this triangle is as a tamarind tree: Cincini. Thus it refers to the doctrine of the Kubjikatantras as Cincinisastra.218 The abode of this doctrine is the Circle of the Divine Transmission (divyaughamandala), higher than that of the Transmission of the Perfected Ones and of Men (Siddha and Manavaugha).219 It is under this Tamarind Tree that Cincininatha (alias Vrksanatha) attained, by divine command, the highest state.220 This tree is the tree of the light of consciousness (cincinicit-prakasa) brought into this world by Siddhanatha221 who planted it on the Island of the Moon (candradvipa) which is in the Great Ocean of Kula. The roots of this Tree and its branches are extensive and it bears the fruits of the Divine Transmission. It is Kaula rooted in Kula and flourishes in Siva's Circle. The juice of this tree is one's own nature (svasvabhava); its young sprouts are the Vedas and Vedangas; its flowers are the senses, and the divine fount which waters it is the delight of consciousness, its inner glory.222 To lie in its shade is to experience the highest state of rest (visranti) in which one is free of the opposites of pleasure and pain. The Origins of the Kubjika Cult The founder of the Kubjika cult is said to be Siva who is venerated as Adinatha,223 the primordial teacher. It is Adinatha who imparts the doctrine to the goddess Kubjika in the KRU. He, the first Master, is, according to one myth, the source of the goddess224 even though he declares that both he and his consort are beginningless and with no end. It is he, not the goddess, who is the essence of the Pascima tradition which draws its life from him, because he is the authentic identity of those who worship him and the goddess.225 His body is the source of the sacraments offered to him and the goddess with whom he unites to emit the 'sequences' (krama) of the liturgy and the sacred circles (mandala) in which he is worshipped with the sacrificial formulas he himself has taught.226 Adinatha is also called Srinatha227 who is identified with Mahabhairava, the Lord of Kula and Kubjika's consort, Kubjesvara.228 He receives the doctrine from the goddess but at the same time is praised by her as the source of all Kula doctrine.229 Srinatha is also identified with Srikantha, said to be the original propagator of the Saivagama230 who is worshipped at times even before Sankara.231 Although Srinatha is extolled as the highest God, there are reasons to believe that he was an historical person. He is listed as the last of eighteen teachers in the line of the Divine Tradition (divyamnayanukrama) and was said to be the only teacher in the town of Candrapura who belonged to the Western Tradition. He was"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"Origins of the Kubjika Cult 91 helped at the beginning of the present Age of Darkness to propagate the doctrine by Odisanatha, Srisasthanatha and Sricaryendranatha who lived in the land of Konkona where where Candrapura was situated.232 As the founder of a line of teachers, he is called \"Olinatha\".233 A Siddhanatha is also referred to as the original propagator of this tradition but he may be none other than Srinatha if we take \"Siddhanatha\" to be a way of referring to an accomplished adept rather than a proper name.234 As we have noted above, Siddhanatha was said to have brought the teachings to earth on the Island of the Moon (candradvipa), also called the \"City of the Moon\" (candrapura), the \"City of the Island of the Moon,\"2'5 or the \"City of the Sacred Place of the Moon.\" (candrapithapura).236 It symbolizes the Innate Nature (svabhava) of all things where the divine body of the goddess Kubjika resides in the form of Kundalini. It is probable that Candrapura did exist although the Tantras overlayed it, as they did other places sacred to the goddess, with a symbolism which interiorized it into an inner sacred geography, thus making it difficult for us to locate the site of this town. The land of Konkona, where Candrapura was situated, is said to have been in the Himalayas. Schoterman, however, does not believe that this is likely but thinks instead that: \"Konkona denotes the whole strip of land between the Western Ghats and the Arabian Sea.\"237 It seems more likely, however, that Candrapura was located somewhere in the Himalayan region in view of the many associations that the goddess and her place of origin has with mountains. Thus in the KMT the Mountain of the Moon [candraparvata) is said to lie to the west of mount Meru near Gandhamalya218 which is where the Island of the Moon is located according to the Sat SS.239 Indeed, this is probably one of the reasons (if not the main one) why the cult of Kubjika is associated with the western quarter. Between the three peaks of Himavat is the site of the Land or Town of the Tradition (santanabhuvana / pura) which is equated with the Western Tradition, also called (as is common practice in these Tantras), the Abode of the Moon {candragrha).240 According to the mystical physiology of these Tantras, Himavat symbolizes the mind (manas) found at the end of the Twelve-finger Space above the head (dvadasanta) where Kundalini abides in her most risen state.241 Thus Kubjika is said to descend onto the peak of the Snow Mountain (himagiri) in the land of India. This peak is located at the end of the stream of divine sound (nada)242 which resounds throughout the micro/macrocosm until it merges into the Silence of the Transcendent at the highest level of being at the End of Sound (nadanta) in the Twelve-finger Space. The goddess is therefore said to reside on the peak of mount Kailasa and, as such, is the Goddess of the Peak (sikhadevi) and the Mistress of the Wheels of Energy which revolve in the cosmic"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"92   THE KAULA TANTRAS body.243 Her body is pure consciousness and bestows the bliss of the 'churning'or arousal of the power of enlightened consciousness.244 As the power of consciousness, she is also Speech and as such is adorned with the fifty letters of the alphabet and resides in this form within the divine triangle of the Three Peaks once she descends into it along the Paih of Meru.245 The MBT, according to the colophons, has also emerged along the Path of Meru in the Primordial Sacred Abode (adyapitha).246 The KRU explains that the Path of Meru means, according to Kula doctrine, the Tradition (santana). The Lord of the Tradition is the Great Meru, the Supreme Sky of Consciousness which knows its own nature completely. It is from here that the beginningless sequence of the progressive unfolding of consciousness and the transmission of the doctrine originates and so is called the Primordial Abode (adipitha) located in the Centre between Kailasa and Malaya. The Lord resides here with his power that pervades all things.247 Although it is not possible on the basis of the evidence so far available to say anything definite about where the Kubjika cult originated, if we assume that the Tantras of these schools invest with symbolic meaning the environment and localities in which the Kubjika cult originally developed, it seems likely that we would be right to seek its origins somewhere in the western Himalayas. That this cult was known in the mountains of the North of India during the earliest period of its development seems to find support by a reference in the KMT to birch bark as the material on which a Mantra is to be written.248 The MBT also refers to it as a writing material249 and the GS prescribes that a sacred diagram be drawn on it with sexual fluids mixed with poison.250 The study of the cult of Kubjika and the Tantras of the Western Kaula Tradition is barely in its infancy. We hope that some of the more important of these texts will be edited and studied in the near future. There can be no doubt that this is an early Kaula tradition which is of great interest not only for the richness of its doctrines and the beauty of its symbolism but also because it can tell us something important about a part, at least, of the history of Hindu Tantra."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"PART THREE Appendices"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"APPENDIX A A History of the Study of the Kubjika Cult Scholars first heard of the existence of the literature of the Kubjika school at the turn of the century when Haraprasada Sastri and C. Bendall published their catalogue of manuscripts belonging to the Darbar Library in Kathmandu.1 In 1934, P. C. Bagchi published an edition of the Kaulajnananirnaya along with a number of short tracts attributed to Matsyendranatha. In his introduction he quoted extensively from the Kubjikanityahnikatilaka, which was correctly identified by Sastri in the Nepal catalogue as belonging to the Pascimamnaya. Bagchi however failed to grasp the distinctive character of the Pascimamnaya and so simply identified it wholesale with the Kaula school.2 The next brief reference to the existence of this corpus of literature appeared in an article by Chintaharan Chakravarti published in 1937 in the Yearbook of the Asiatic Society of Bengal. This brief article dealt with the Nepalese manuscripts of the works of this school deposited in the library of the Society.3 One manuscript of the KMT, which was thought at that time to have been written in late Gupta script (but has since been proved to be an early form of Sarada4), aroused particular interest due to its presumed antiquity. Chakravarti also wrote short notices of these manuscripts in his catalogue of Tantra manuscripts belonging to the Society which came out in two volumes in 1939 and 1940 respectively.5 In 1947 a series of articles written by the Nepalese major-general Dhana Samser Jangabahadur Rana came out in the Hindi magazine Candi. They were published every two months and each gave a brief account of the amnayas amongst which was the Pascimamnaya.6 In 1963 De Mallmann published a book on the iconography of the Agnipurana in which she briefly discussed the form of Kubjika described there.7 This was the state of affairs up to the beginning of the 1970s when a group of scholars at the University of Utrecht in Holland decided to edit the KMT which resulted in 1972 in a preliminary article by Dr. K. R. Van Kooj on the problems involved.8 In 1976, an edition of the Goraksa-"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"96 APPENDIX A samhita was published by Janardana Pandeya from Sampurnananda Sanskrit University, Benares. This edition was prepared on the basis of two manuscripts, one the scholar noticed in 1963 in the manuscript library of the said university and another he found in the collection of the All-India Kashiraj Trust in Ramnagar near Benares.9 This was the first edition of a Tantra belonging to the Kubjika school made, as it happens, without the editor knowing that this was the school of Tantra to which this text belongs. In 1977, Schoterman published a short article on the KMT10 and in 1980 an article on the worship of Kubjika in the Agnipurana.l1 In 1982, he published an edition of the first five chapters of the Satsahasrasamhita along with an English translation and extensive notes.12 This text is an expanded form of the 3500 verse KMT and so Schoterman's work is the first major study of a Tantra of this school. At the University of Utrecht an edition of the Kularatnamulapancakavatara has been prepared for a research degree. Dr. Schoterman is also preparing an edition of the Kubjlkanityahnikatilaka by Muktaka (alias Manjuka) which is a manual for the worship of Kubjika written before the twelfth century (the date of the manuscript). Dr. T. Goudriaan and Dr. Schoterman have completed the edition of the KMT and will hopefully manage to publish it shortly with an English introduction."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"APPENDIX B The Manthanabkairavatantra The Manthanabhairava is a lengthy Tantra belonging to the Pascimamnaya. It also calls itself caturvimsatisahasra,* that is, a \"book of 24,000 verses\" and is in fact not much short of this size. The oldest dated manuscript traced so far was copied during the reign of Somesvara and is dated N.S. 300, i.e., 1180 A.D.2 The most recent was copied during the reign of Viravikrama Saha and is dated Sam. 1897, i.e., A.D. 1841. Forty-one manuscripts, many of which are more than 150 folios long, are listed in Appendix C. One manuscript of a part of this Tantra is preserved in the Asiatic Society of Bengal. It is in Bengali script and was copied from a manuscript belonging to a monk in Bodhagaya dated N.S. 761, i.e., 1641 A.D.. It contains chapters 74-89 and is written on 199 folios of foolscap paper.3 Apart from this one, no manuscript of this Tantra has so far been found that is not Nepalese. The MBT is divided into four sections, three of which are called \"khanda. \" Although a colophon of one of these sections states that this Tantra is divided into three parts,4 in actual fact it appears, on the basis of the descriptions in the catalogues, that they are not three but four. These are listed below along with their approximate length: Yogakhanda  4,500 verses Kumarikakhanda  6,000 verses Siddhakhanda  2,900 verses Navanityayagadhikara - - 4,300 verses Total 17,700 verses In the Paratantra, the MBT is referred to as the \"mahamanthana-satkaka\"* which may be translated to mean the \"Great Manthana (bhairavatantra) consisting of a group of six [thousand verses]\" or also as"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"98 APPENDIX B \"consisting of groups of six [thousand verses].\" If the first meaning is intended, then perhaps the Paratantra is referring to just a part of it. Perhaps, however, the work is conceived to be divided into four parts of six thousand verses, as is the Jayarathayamala. This is perhaps not the case because, as we have already noted, only three out of the four sections refer to themselves as a \"khanda, \"while the MBT describes itself (in the Kumarikakhanda at least) as divided into three parts. Does this mean then that the Navanityahnikadhikara is a later addition? Or is it, in fact, a part of one of the three original sections? This is just one of the many preliminary problems that need to be solved. Indeed, without carefully examining all the MSs it is not possible even to make out which parts of the MBT they contain. Certainly there is no single MS that contains it all. Moreover, the order of the sections also needs to be assessed. From the notices we have of these MSs there appears to be a commentary on this Tantra called \"Vidhana\" written by a certain Rupasiva. Again, without examining the MSs it is impossible to say whether the commentary extends to cover the entire Tantra or just a part and if so, which part. The MBT is also called Khanjinimata indicating its close connection to the KMT for, as the reader will recall, Khanjini is another name for Kubjika. It was brought down to earth by Kalankanatha (see below) while the Kulalikamata of 3,500 verses, i.e., the KMT, which the MBT also calls the \"Ratnasutra, \"was brought down to earth by Tumbura. The reference here to the KMT of 3,500 verses proves that the MBT is a later work.6 This is further confirmed by another passage where the presiding god of this school is described as sitting in the mandala of the Vidyapitha holding in one hand the Srimata, i.e., the KMT.7 That the MBT is probably not the original Tantra of the Kubjika school is also indirectly confirmed by the highe regard that the Tantras of this school have for the KMT, rather than the MBT, and that it is the former, not the latter, which figures as one of the sixty-four Tantras listed in the NSA. The Kumarikakhanda of this Tantra is particularly interesting from this point of view as it seems to be closely related to the KMT. Perhaps, indeed, it is an expanded version of it, like the Satsahasrasamhita referred to above. Nor can it be the Sat SS because this Tantra is divided into fifty chapters whereas the Kumarika­khanda is in sixty-six chapters. It is not possible at present to date the MBT with any degree of accuracy. It cannot be earlier than the seventh century Buddhist logician, Dharmakirti, to whom it refers.8 Probably, however, Dharmakirti much precedes the reduction of this portion of this Tantra. A reference to an invasion by foreigners who conquered the entire country after crossing the Indus9 is apparently a reference to the full-scale invasion of India by Muslims in the early eleventh century. It appears, therefore, that the MBT"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"Manthanabhairavatantra 99 cannot be older than this nor is it younger than 1180 A. D. which is the date of the oldest Nepalese manuscript. To conclude, we shall say a few words about the traditional accounts of the revelation of the MBT. Up to now, I have managed to trace two. One is found in the Yogakhanda10 of the MBT, and the other in the concluding portion of the Kumarikakhanda.11 According to the latter account, the original form of this Tantra (here called \"Paramesvaramata\") was a fabulous million, million verses long (laksakoti). The essence of the doctrine of this Tantra was transmitted in another seventy million verses from which another version was supposed to have been derived consisting of one hundred and twenty-five thousand verses. The most essential doctrines of this Tantra were then recorded in a twenty-four thousand verse version which is the present MBT. This was transmitted by Kujesi to Mitranatha in three sections. The Yogakhanda's account is more complex than that of the Kumarik ak handa and differs from it in certain details. Here the Divine Transmission of the Khanjinimata is said to have passed originally from Adinatha to Mitranatha, who then transmitted it to Sastinatha, who gave one half to Caryanatha. Caryanatha in his turn passed on half of what he had learned. Unfortunately, a break occurs in the text here so we do not know whom Caryanatha taught; possibly this was Odiyananatha who is usually associated with the three other teachers. Whoever this teacher was, he transmitted half to Brhatkantha, who gave one half to Ganaveksa. The remaining portion of the Khanjinlmata was transmitted by Akulanatha. The text now goes on to explain that the version consisting of one hundred twenty-five thousand verses was brought to earth by Cinca(natha) and that all the rest of the teaching was transmitted by the community of Siddhas on the Island Free of Thought-Constructs (nirvikalpadvipa) from whence it spread to India. We are also told that the Tantra of twenty-four thousand verses was brought to earth by Kalankanatha. These two accounts are illustrated graphically in Table 8. Table 8. The Transmission of the Manthanabhairavatantra. 1) Paramesvaramata of 1 million, million verses Version of 70 million verses Version of 125,000 verses MBT revealed to Mitranatha in three khandas together consisting of 24,000 verses."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"100   APPENDIX B 2) Adinatha Mitranatha Sastinatha - Caryanatha - ? - Brhatkantha -Ganaveksa - Akulanatha Cincanatha (also called Cincinlnatha) revealed the 125,000 verse version. Kalanikanatha revealed the 24,000 verse version."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"APPENDIX C The Canon of the Jayadrathayamala After completing this monograph, it was my good fortune to have been given a copy of a manuscript of the first satka of the Jayadratha­yamala by Mr. G. S. Sanderson who is at present lecturer in Sanskrit at Oxford University. Several chapters of this text are dedicated to the Saiva canon.1 P. C. Bagchi examined this section of this Tantra in the 1930s2 but did not publish an extensive report of its contents, although he did point out its importance. It does, in fact, contain a great deal of interesting information relevant to the study of the Saiva canon and its history. We have, therefore, thought it best to present it as a single unit largely as it stands in the original. The numbers in the margin refer to the folio numbers of the manuscript. Bhairava, prompted by the goddess, sets out to give an account of the sastras. He starts by explaining that a sastra is so-called because it teaches (sasanat) those who are frightened, suffering or wicked the way to salvation (trana) from their sins and worldly troubles,3 All sastras belong to four basic categories:4 Common (samanya) Common-cum-particular (sadharanavisesa) Particular (visesa) Specially particular (visesatara) (65b Once Bhairava has enumerated these categories, he tells the goddess that this progressive development from less to more specialized knowledge through these four stages is inevitable because it is impossible to teach everything at once. Even so, however broad or focalized the terms of reference may be, all human and divinely revealed knowledge refers to the same reality. Bhairava also implies here that there is a temporal as well as a logical progression between these categories and, indeed, the last three do follow each other in roughly chronological order. Thus these are:"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"102 APPENDIX C Common (samanya). The sastras belonging to this category enjoy extensive popular support and are not criticized as improper by anyone. Thus, because everyone is fit to study and hear them and because their scope is very extensive, they are said to be 'common' as well as 'worldly' (laukika). They include the Puranas, literary works (kavya) and those dealing with history (itihasa), mathematics (ganita), dramaturgy (nataka), metrics (chandas) and grammar (sabda). Common-cum-particular (sadharanavisesa). Only Brahmins are compe­tent to study these texts and so they are said to be 'particular'; while because those who study them do not need to affiliate themselves to any cult, they are also said to be common. To this category belongs the Sruti, here reckoned to be the three Vedas, namely, Rk, Sama and Yajus - not the Atharvaveda. They are the most important in this group. Then comes Smrti, the Upanisads, Mantrasutra, the Kalpasutra and logic (anviksa). Particular (visesa). The texts belonging to this category are said to be 'particular' because they belong to specific traditions (samaya). These include the Saura, Saiva, Pancaratra, Pramana, Vaimala,5 Atharva, Samkhya, Yoga, Bauddha and Arhata. \"Saiva\" here means specifically the Saivasiddhanta scriptures which are of two types according to whether they belong to the Siva or Rudra group. Specially Particular (visesatara). These texts are more 'particular' than those belonging to the previous group because they are meant for the followers of specific cults within the various traditions. Amongst them are the scriptures of the Vajrayana, including the Guhyasamajatantra.6 To this category also belong the Bhairava, Bhuta and Garuda Tantras. The exposition of the canon which follows is concerned with this last category and more particularly with the Tantras of the Bhairava cult which encompass, from the JY's point of view, virtually the entire Saiva canon apart from the Siddhanta. Thus this category of'specially particular'texts is said to be divided variously into three, four and five currents (srotas) as well as into four pithas. 166b Before going into the details of these divisions extensively, the discussion digresses to deal with the origin of the Saiva scriptures in general. The goddess wants to know how the scriptures originated. She wants to know about the nature of the relationship (sambandha) between those who transmitted and received the scriptures because unless this relationship is established, the scriptures cannot serve as a source of insight (pratipatti). Bhairava explains that Mahesvara is the sole cause of liberation in this"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"Canon of Jayadrathayamala  103  beginningless, confined world of transmigratory existence. It is Mahesvara's nature to seek to grace mankind, while the latter is the object of his grace because every man is a victim of his own faults. Moreover, in his omniscience, Siva knows how to grace humanity and liberate man from his state of bondage. The most direct means to this end is scripture which, like a powerful medicine, heals man's suffering and, through the revelation of its meaning, extinguishes the lamp of pain. It is through scripture that Siva's divine vitality (virya) is made to fall into the wombs of liberation, fertilizing them to issue forth into the new life of the liberated state. Scripture is ultimately the instrumental cause (nimitta) of liberation and immediately that through which the relationship (sambandha) to the teachers of its purport is established and hence with its original source which is Siva himself. The Lord's body is pure consciousness; thus when he wishes to generate this relationship through the production of scripture, a movement (pravrtti) arises within him that issues out of his transcendental, unmanifest state. Kundalini, the power of consciousness and speech latent within him, is aroused by the fullness of the growing intensity of this movement and so straightens to become a manifest resonance (svara) within consciousness.7 Siva is in this way filled with the energy of speech and so assumes the form of the aggregate of all words (sabdarasi), here identified with Sadasiva who, eternal, (sada) and endowed with Siva's nature, is ever at the upper level (urdhvasthana). Sadasiva reflects upon the manifest universe as consisting essentially of two categories, namely, the 'listener' and 'speaker'. This is the one relationship (sambandha) through which the meaning of scripture is communicated. Therefore, although these are two aspects of a single reality and the relationship between them is undivided, it is of various types according to the level of its manifestation, namely: Great (mahat): that between consciousness and its power. Subsequent (anantara): that between Sadasiva and the Viras. Intermediate (avantara): that between he who awakens and he who is awakened. Divine (divva): The relationship between Sadasiva as he who awakens and divine beings below him up to the level of Maya. Mixed (misra): that between divine beings and sages. Other than divine (adivya): that between sages and ordinary men.\" Sadasiva as the source of Saiva scripture is in his supreme (para) form. At the intermediate (parapara) level he is said to be the vitality of yoga and his body consists of the five Mantras associated with his five faces"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"104 APPENDIX C which are the sources of the five currents (srotas) of Saiva scripture.9 In his lower (apara) form, Sadasiva is the lord of the Mantrapitha and is here said to have four faces. Now, although the JY itself belongs to the Vidyapitha, it also considers the Mantrapitha to be very important and deals with this class extensively. Accordingly, the Mantraplfha is said to be the divine pitha (divyapitha) of the Mudra- and Mandala- pithas of which Sadasiva is also the Lord. From Sadasiva's five faces issues the pure knowledge (suddhavijnana) through which the divine Sound (nada) and Drop (bindu) emerge. When these combine with the metres, they generate through their rhythm all the sastras. The gods first revealed reality (artha) through the Vedic metres {chandas), even so all the scriptures are forms in which Sadasiva embodies himself. Consciousness has no form in itself but is said in this way to possess a body made of Mantras. As such, Sadasiva is full of divine powers and has a form (vigraha). Through the four instruments {karana) of mind, ego, intellect and speech, he assumes the identity of the teacher who instructs; while when the fourth instrument -speech - is substituted by the power of hearing, he becomes the disciple who listens. He who knows the four instruments is said to be a \"Maha-karunika\" l0 Within these gross bodies is the subtle body (ativahikalinga) governed by the vital breath which moves through the right and left currents of vitality. In this way the right and left currents of scripture descend into the world along with a 'mixed' current formed by their conjunction to which the Yamalas belong. 1. The Pitha Division The JY deals with Agamic Saivism from two points of view. Firstly it enumerates the Tantras which belong to the pithas; then it enumerates the lines of transmission of the scriptures from master to disciple (santana) and the schools (mathika) belonging to the currents (srotas) of the scriptures.11 Thus the JY seeks to present a picture of Agamic Saivism and its many different branches from the point of view of both systems of classification. It reserves, however, pride of place for the pitha system as the most fundamental classification of scripture while the srotas system is, in a sense, devolved to a classification of groups of Saiva traditions and lines of transmission of doctrines, each peculiar to its own parent current. The ideal Saiva master (here the term \"guru \"is generally used rather than \"acarya\") is one who is conversant with the teaching of all the currents.12 The relationship between the pitha and srotas classifications is peculiar and somewhat strained. It appears, as we have already had"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"Canon of Jayadrathayamala 105 occasion to remark, that it is a system which developed after the classifi­cation into five currents, at a time when they were reduced to three (see above p. 42 ff), namely into 'right', 'left' and 'mixed' currents and takes over from it as a system of classification of scriptures as a whole (and as a set of groups to which the Tantras affiliated themselves), cutting across the - distinctions made within it. We have already noted that this is happening in the B Y's account of the Saiva canon while the following remark in the J Y seems to echo the view of the BY which, as we shall see, is considered by the JY to be a particularly important Tantra: \"The four pithas are together said to reside in the right, left and mixed currents as if they were the principal branch in a subsidiary branch (of the teachings).\"13 Before dealing with the pi/has extensively, Bhairava talks about them in general and deals with their contents summarially. Bhairava starts by listing a number of synonyms for the word \"pi/ha\", all of which mean a \"group\" or \"collection\".I4 The Mantrapitha is associated with masculine words while the Vidyapitha is associated with feminine ones. Perhaps by this is implied that the Tantras of the Mantrapitha deal more extensively with male deities while those of the Vidyapitha with female ones, as the Svacchandabhairavatantra and the SYM, which belong to these two pithas respectively, exemplify. The Mudrapitha is of three forms related to mind, speech and body. It is called \"terrible\" (ghora). The Mandala-pitha is where all three unite and is said to be undivided. This does not mean that the Tantras of this pitha are monistic but rather that it has, according to the JY's account, no subdivisions. Again, the preference the JY has for the Mantrapitha is evidenced by the way it characterizes it as the repository of the supreme brilliance (paramam tejas) which symbolizes the state of the enjoying subject (bhoktr), while the Vidyapitha is the object of his enjoyment (bhogya). Mudra includes both of these while Mandala is present in them all.'5 To the Mantrapitha (\"beyond which there is nothing\") are said to belong twelve thousand Mantras. It consists essentially of eight Bhairava-tantras, namely, the Svacchanda, Unmatta, Asitanga, Ruru, Canda, Krodha, Jhankara and Kapalisa16 with which secondary Tantras are associated. The JY appears to quote a verse from the Sarvaviratantra recorded by Ksemaraja in his commentary on the SvT which states that the Tantras of this pitha are four, namely, the Svacchanda, Canda, Krodha and Unmatta-bhairavatantras.'1 The apparent contradiction is recon­ciled if we understand that what is meant here is that these are the four major Tantras of the Mantrapitha, each of which is linked with one of the four remaining Bhairavatantras. Consequently the Mantrapitha is said to be two-fold.18 The Vidyapitha is also extensive.19 The major Tantras listed as"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"106 APPENDIX C belonging to this pitha are the following: Sarvavira, Samayoga, Siddhayogesvarimata, Pancamrta, Visvadya, Yoginijalasambara, Vidyabheda, Sirascheda, Mahasammohana, Nayottara and Maharaudra. Then comes a list of Yamalas (it appears that all the Yamalas belong to the Vidyapitha); these are: Rudra, Brahma, Visnu, Skanda, Auma (i.e„ Uma), Rudrabheda, Hari and Gautami yamalas. Firstly, it is interesting to note that the JY itself does not figure amongst the Yamalas but is separately listed as the Sirascheda. Although eight Yamalas are listed here, in the detailed exposition which follows (see p. 114 ff.) only the first five of them are discussed, of which the BY is considered to be the most important. Eighteen subsidiary Yamalas are said to be associated with them, namely, seven Matrkayamalas, six Yoginiyamalas (beginning with Jaya) and five Matryamalas. According to the detailed account of the five Yamalas, four of them are said to generate four others as follows: Brahma - Vetala, Visnu - Isana, Rudra - Atharva and Skanda - Sarasvati.20 The standard complement of eight Yamalas is thus complete, although these eight are not the ones listed above. Nor are they quite the same as those listed amongst the sixty-four Bhairavatantras (see p. 121 ff.) which are: Brahma, Rudra, Visnu, Skanda, Gautamiya, Atharva, Vetala and Ruruyamala. However, if we identify the Ruru­yamala with the Rurubheda, only the Uma and Hari-yamalas are missing in this list. The Mudrapitha consists of eighteen thousand Mantras and one hundred and eight Kalpas. It has three principal divisions associated with the following root Tantras (sutra): Hrdbheda, Matrbheda and Kubjikamata. The Mandalapitha has only one division belonging to its root sutra and is said to be sealed by a hundred (i.e., countless) mandalas. It appears from the JY's account that the Mandalapitha had little substance of its own (at least at the time of the redaction of the JY). Essentially, it is considered to be a part of the other pithas, enjoying little autonomous existence of its own as a separate category. Finally, the JY refers to another important classification of the scripture, one we have already discussed at length (see above p. 43 ff.) namely, that into eight groups of eight (astastaka) which, as we shall see, is essentially the same as we find in the Srikanthiyasamhita. After this brief exposition Bhairava goes on to give a detailed description of the contents of these pithas along with the lines of their transmission."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"Canon of Jayadrathayamala  107  2. Mantrapitha This is basically divided into the Tantras associated with four root Tantras or mulasutras, namely, Svacchanda-, Canda-, Krodha-, and Unmalta-bhairavasutras. 169b Svacchandabhairavasutra. This is divided into two branches, namely, those of Svacchanda and Asitanga. The Svacchanda branch was made manifest at the command of Svacchandabhairava. It consists of eight sections, each taught by a Bhairava starting with Kankalabhairava and ending with Sitabhairava. The first to hear these teachings was Ananta who received it through the power of yoga (yogasakti) operating on the Pure Path. They were then adopted by Srikantha and Lakulisa. Lakulapani expounded the teachings extensively to sages like Gautama who knew the Veda. His best disciple was Musalendra to whom he transmitted the essence of the teachings.21 Asitanga, the second branch, was revealed by eight Bhairavas including Asitanga and Kapala to the Anantaviras manifested through them. The teaching was then transmitted through the ages in various Tantras considered to be schools or branches (sakha) of the Asitangon-mattasutra. These include Asitanga, Mahanada, Ekapada, Mahodaya, Bindukapala, Nadendu, Sekhara, Caryamrta, Kalajala, Kalakuta, Mahamrta, Mahaghanghala, Bhairavaghanghala, Mahanirvanayoga, Vicitrabhairava. Bhima. Mahabija and Parampada.22 170a Candabhairavasutra. This sutra is also divided into two sections, namely those belonging to Canda- and Ruru-Bhairavas. The Candabhairava­sutra, which has twelve Kalpas, was originally revealed to Vikarala, Simhakesa and to one other(?) along with eight Viras by Candanatha. These sages founded several schools. This Great Knowledge (mahajnana) was then transmitted by Candanatha's will along the following line of teachers. From Simhakesara to Manohara - Visnu - Kausika - Srivatsa -Srivinasa - Srigarbha - Visvavaisrava - Saura - Midhaswami -Subhadra - Munjakesin - Adhoksaja - Medhasas. It was also given to Agastya's circle of masters by Vigrahesa and, by the will of the Srikantha-suris, was transmitted by Bhairava who gave it to the gods. It was then transmitted to Sakatayana - Pippalada - Uddalaka - son of Naciketas who brought it into this world with its many branches (sakha). The Tantras belonging to this sutra are twenty-one in number, namely Dandatantra, Viratantra, Mahapitha, Supitha, Candapitha, Susravana, Purakalpa, Candogra, Candamandala, Candasidhara, Bhutogra (?), 170b"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"108   APPENDIX C Bhutanigraha, Vijaya, Tripada, Kama, Amogha, Ardhalocana, Patalavijaya, Trailokyavijaya, Mahadamara and Ghoraddmaratantra.23 171a Krodhabhairavasutra.

The Tantras of these branches were taught by eight Bhairavas, including Kantibhairava, Sikhasekhara and Rodhina (?). The branch associated with Samghatabhairava is also divided into eight branches taught by eight Bhairavas starting with Sasankasekhara up to Virupaksa. All these branches again have many subdivisions so that the Krodhatantra group is said to have been transmitted along innumerable lines. Kantabhairava spoke it to Rudrohkara and Mahesa while the Krodhograsamhita belonging to this Tantra was taught by Krodhabhairava himself to Kamalesvara who transmitted it to Bhima who gave it to Jnanabhrt and Amsumati. Again Vimalabhairava gave the Vimalatantra to Candrapida, while Krodhesa gave it to Surapida and Tarapida. (Sikha?) Sekhara-171b bhairava gave the Krodhamalinisamhita (said to describe many mudras) to Amalesa, while Mahavirasikhara transmitted it to his disciples on the lower level. The Krodhanalasamhita of one hundred seventy-five thousand verses was taught by Mayapinda and Amalesa; the hundred thousand verse recension was taught by Bhairava, while Nandin taught the version of twenty million verses. At his command Bhairava and the goddess taught it to the Baiakhilyas. The one thousand eight hundred verse version was taught by Nandinatha, that of seventeen (hundred?) verses by Krodhin(?) and that of eight (hundred?) by Dattatreya, while the third group of eight Viras gave it to Sitamsusekhara. The Nanajharikara-malinisamhita was received by Visalaja from Jhankara while Krura-bhairava taught a section of this Tantra called Krodhakarankinisamhita to Kandarpa. The Binduvijayatantra was imparted to Sasibhusana. Bindukitiratantra (?) was taught by Kalikahladadeva. Samanta received the Yogamalinisamhita from Krakaca and Sasikanti gave the Krodha-samvarttaka to Mahasamantadeva. Tara received the Mahanadatantra while the Visamaksodhamalitantra(?) belongs to Mahatarapati. The Krodhatantra was transmitted from Tarapati - Sutarapavana -Dhamalila - Jitaiavanyaka - Hatakanatha and was finally received by Kalanala. 172a Bhairava concludes this section by defining the term \"krodha\" (meaning literally \"anger\"): \"Anger is said to be that by virtue of which one becomes genuinely one-pointedly intent on removing whatever obstacle there may be to liberation.\"24 Unmattasutra. Bhairava starts by saying that this root Tantra and its"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"Canon of Jayadrathayamala 109 ramifications are but a drop from the infinite ocean of Sadasiva. The Unmattapaddhati is divided into two lines, each of which is of eight divisions corresponding to eight Bhairavas. Unmattabhairava taught the Unmattatantra to which belong twenty-one Samhitas, while Kapalisa presides over the second line of which there are eight principal Samhitas, namely: Anantabhairava, Anantavijaya, Bhairava, Para, Vinasikha, Acaloddisa, Martandasamhita and Candograbhairava. These Samhitas were brought to earth by eight sages amongst which only Visaialocana, Tarapati and Sutara are named, the latter being the revealer of the Martandasamhita. These Sarnhitas are linked to each other and to other Tantras as follows: Sikha - Amrta, Ananda, Pramoda, Anantavijaya25 Andcala and Amrtananda - Ananda, Gambhira, Jivananda, Sirottara, Sunanda. Martanda - Manthara, Vijayananda, Surananda Candogra - Sadananda, Asritananda, Marigalananda, Mangala. (Bhairava) - Lelihana, Mahajvala, Candamalini, Karankini, Karala, Karnamula, Kalevara, Mahaphetkarabija Each of the Tantras associated with the Unmattabhairavasamhita have other Tantras associated with them. These are: Lelihana Nityanity, Anitya, Nilya. Mahajvala Umadeha, Nilakan/ha, Yoganidra Candamalini Pujodaya, Kurangaksi, Padaksi, Citrakandhara. Karahkini Two extensive Samhitas - not named. Karala Nigraha, Dhvastavighna Karnamula Vighna, Sudiptabhdva. Kalevara Samaya, Ksudrd. Phetkara Vimala, Siva. 173a The Unmattatantra of the first line was transmitted by Unmatta­bhairava (?) to the gods starting with the five Sivas (Sivapancaka). From Suddhavidya it was transmitted in a version of three hundred and fifty (chapters?) to Dhyanahara who taught it to Prapanca, then to Kunda-bhadra and Sikhesa who gave it to Bhira (?). Bhairava then explains that he assumed the form of Unmattabhairava when he became mad with passion at the sight of Daksayamkali.

Pleased with her, Bhairava spoke the Jayatantra of twelve thousand verses. This Tantra has five versions (kalpa) of six thousand, three thousand, one thousand eight hundred, eight hundred and seventy -five, and five (or five hundred?) verses. Before concluding this section on the Mantrapitha with the affirmation that it is very extensive, Bhairava states that the Bhairava -tantra was brought down to earth by the eight sages: Durvasas, Sanaka, Jisnu, Kapila, Kasyapa, Kuru, Samvarta and Sankhapala. 3. The Vidyapitha The Vidyapitha is said to be closely connected to the Mantrapitha. The account of its contents is basically divided into three sections. Firstly, a brief outline of these sections and their contents: The Saktitantras belonging to the Middle Current. These are the Sarvavira, Trisula (i.e., the SYM), Sricakra, Visvadya, Yoginijala -sambara, Vidyabheda and Sirohrta (i.e., Sirascheda).2b The Tantras belonging to the Left Current. Nayottara. Maharaudra, Mahasammohana.27 The Tantras belonging to the Right Current. These are basically the Yamalas of which five are the root texts. Of these, four are in a group of their own, namely Raudra - , Auma - , Vaisnava - and Skanda - yamalas 174a The fifth is the Brahmayamala which is said to expound \"the conduct which involves the use of rotten flesh\" (kravyacara) whereas the others do not. It is also called \"Picumata,\" \"Dvayaksara\"or just \"Mata.\" Seven other root Tantras (sutra) are associated with it, namely Ucchusma, Niracara, Mahacara, Sarvatobhadra,28 Dvika, Sarvatmaka and Mahadaksina. The last Tantra is divided into two sections. Thus there are eight Tantras altogether and as these are all Matatantras they are called the \"Eight Matas\" (matastaka). After concluding that there are fifteen root Tantras (mulasutra) in the Vidyapitha, the JY moves on to a more detailed treatment of each of them. The Sarvaviratantra. This Tantra was revealed by Mahadeva and transmitted along the following line: Daksina - Mahavira - Pracanda -Kankala - Nilakantha - Bhairava - consort - Garutmat - Dasa -khandara - Ravana and Vibhi$ana - Patanga - Bhavapapin who then"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"Canon of Jayadrathayamala  111  transmitted it to men. The basic form of this Tantra (mulasutra) is said to be of three hundred and fifty (chapters?), its concise (samgraha) version is called \"sahasra \" which presumably means that it is one thousand verses long. Other versions consist of sixteen thousand, twelve thousand and twenty-four thousand verses. Altogether this Tantra is said to be over one hundred thousand verses long and has been heard, spoken and transmitted many times. The Siddhayogesvarimata. This Tantra has three (sections/versions?) taught by three different teachers, namely: Para by Mahendra, Parapara by Bhisma and Apara by Siddhayogin. A number of Tantras, all of which are said to be two hundred and fifty (chapters?) long, are associated with the SYM and transmitted by various teachers. These are: 174b Teacher Maladhara Karalin Ajakarna Sankhadharin Marmaphetkara Rudras Vidyadhipati Vidyolka Aghora Ghoresvara Vidya Kitacaksus Bhairava's will Padmamudra Niranjana Iccha Jnatr Tantra Malini (?) - (?)

The Sricakratantra. Eight Cakrasamhitas are associated with this Tantra, namely: Svaracakra, Varacakra, Nadicakra, Guhyacakra, Kalacakra, Sauracakra, Vahneyacakra and Somajacakra.29 Siva 'resounds' (svarati) and is manifest in the Svaracakratantra while Varnacakra deals with 175a"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"112 APPENDIX C Mantra. Nadicakra (also called Sutara) and the Guhyacakra deal with the nature of Sakti. There are two Kalacakratantras, both are said to deal with the duration of man's life (ayus). One of the two is Saura and said to be auspicious (subha); the other is Buddhist and is considered to be inauspicious (asubha). Vahneyacakra is said to be 'enflamed' (dipta) by Mantra while the teachings of Somajacakra (also called \"Candatantra\") destroy death. The Pancamrtatantra. The only information supplied about this root Tantra is the line of its transmission which is: Sakti - yoginis, ganas, gods and snakes - Prahlada - Ausanasena - Bhargava - Devala -Krsnatreya (\"who knew the Vedas\") - Kusadhvaja - Sitoda -Patadra (?) - Dantya. 175b The Visvadyatantra. This Tantra is named \"Visvadya \"because it teaches the nature of the group of yoginis (yoginijala) starting with the one named Visva. The line of transmission is as follows: Sadasiva - Visvatman -Vimaladrsa - Kanticchatra - Saundin - Bhairava - Sakti who hid it. A few of the Mantras of this Tantra were known to Kilaheli who learned them from Sakti and transmitted them to the world of men. Yoginijalasambara. There are twelve Tantras associated with this root Tantra: Mahasamvarttaka, Bhima, Tilaka, Nakha, Bimba, Candralekha, Candasitaka, Silada, Bhagamala, Bhogini, Sukesin and Sudhama.30 176a Associated with these Tantras are twenty Upasamhitas: Taraka, Aksi, Pasaghni, Nandini, Gamini, Bhrguni, Satya, Daksayani, Uma, Maya, Mahakali, Candali, Acalasri, Bhadrakali, Sumedha, Tara, Arkamani, Tarakabharana, Raudri and Jvalamalantika.

The Siraschedatantra. This Tantra is taught by Bhairava himself in the last aeon. It is the last of the seven root Tantras of this Current to come to earth and also belongs equally to the Right and Left Currents. It is expressly said to be a Yamalatantra and is also called \"Jayadratha\"or \"Satsahasra. \" It was transmitted from Mina(?) - Narasimha - Yogini -Daivavatsyaikacaksus - Sukra.

Bhairava received it in the form of the Kalabhedatantra (also called Kala -samkarsana). He taught it to his consort and to Yatudhanadhipa and Vrnadarakamuni. It was transmitted through his divine power in countless sections (skandha). The Sammohanatantra. Once when the Lord of the Demons, in alliance with the Heroes and the circle of Mothers, was fighting the gods, he drank the sacred nectar and became drunk. In this state he started to dance while the Mothers, headed by Cakrakaralini, began to devour the circle of the gods along with Bhairava who presides over it. Siva, aware of the danger, emitted into the ocean of wine a Lotus of Power of four petals on which sat the goddesses Jaya, Vijaya, Jita and Aparajita with their brother, Tumburu, seated in the centre. They played upon their vinas and the terrible circle of Mothers, attracted by the music, desisted from their intent.32 It was the same Tumburu, skilled both in playing the vina and vocal music, who, along with his four sisters, brought the Maha-sammohanatantra to earth. 177a The line of transmission of this Tantra is as follows: Tumburu -177b"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"114 APPENDIX C Mahesana - Sammohana - Ananta - Trimurti - Dundubhi -Nilakantha. Nilarudra was another teacher of this Tantra.

The Maharaudratantra. The deity of this Tantra is called Maharaudra or Ruru (bhairava). He. taught this Tantra to Sarva - Rudra - Samvarta — Canda and Saundin - Ardhanarisa who taught a short version to Bhrnga. I82b The Yamalas. The term \"yamala\" which literally means \"a couple in union\" and commonly refers to the coupling of the god with his consort, is here given a special meaning as the union of Mantra and Vidya. The implication here is that these works deal with both the ritual formulas corresponding to and embodying the gods (as Mantras) as well as the goddesses (as Vidyas).35 Again these operate in the domain of another couple, namely, knowledge (Jnana), which is both insight into ultimate principles and an understanding of the methods described in the Tantras, together with action (kriya) which is the application of this knowledge. They depend on one another.36 The goal of spiritual endeavour is achieved by following the teachings of the Yamalas, dealing as they do with these four topics. 179b The Brahmayamala. The root of all the Yamalas is considered to be the Brahmayamala. It has three principal divisions called Raurava, Andhaka and Kanaka. The Visnu, Skanda and Rudrayamalas belong to these three respectively. The four Vedas are said to originate from them along with"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"Canon of Jayadrathayamala  115  the Umayamala37 The Brahmayamala has many other secondary divisions and many Tantras are associated with it. It is said to partake of the character of all five srotas and is also called \"Picumata. \" The word \"Picu\" is said to consist of two units, namely, \"Pi\" which means \"body\" (pinda) and \"cu\" which means \"seed\" (bija): a true yogin is one who unites these two elements, that is, his body with the seed of consciousness. Again, \"Pi\" denotes menstrual flow (kaminipuspa) and \"cu\" the male seed (retas). The repeated union of these two in conjunction with the performance of the appropriate ritual (kriya) and recitation of Mantra is considered to be Picu. \"Pi\" is also said to denote the female organ (yoni) while \"cu\" is the male seed. This seed - called \"vindu\" - is the omniscient knower - 'vid'. It is the supreme seed of consciousness. The BY is the main Matatantra and has eight Matatantras associated with it. These, along with the teachers who brought them to earth and anutantras associated with them, are as follows:'8 179b Teacher Bindusara Kapalin Hetuyana (?) Siva Nilakesin Bharudi Kausiki Matatantra Rakta0 Pecika0 (Hedamata) Mrgalinimata (Vrkadaya) Sambara Utphullaka39 Nilakesa Bharunda Pingala Anutantra Utpala0 Karalinimata Aitreya Sarasvata Kalasara + Mukuta Lampata Kalakhya Picusara and Nayodaya Associated with the eight anutantras are eight parisistatantras. How these are linked is not always made clear. They are Pancalika (linked with the Utpalalantra), Manava (associated with the Vagavalitantra), Karalimata and its 'sarasamgraha', Laksmi (associated with the Kalakhya), Vimala (associated with the Lampatatantra), Kacchapi (associated with the Kampakiihadrutantra) and Garbhaprakarana (associated with the Nayodayatanlra). From the parisistatantras originate the upasutras. These are Asvapluta, Saranga, Gojika (?), Bhedavipluta, Vaibhariga, Matanga, Kusumali and Savitraka. All these Tantras are the root ancilliaries (mulapansista) of the BY. Along with them are seven misrasutras which are said to belong to all five currents of scripture. These are Musti, Kusa, Lava, Kalasara, Ambika, Tilaka and Avadhuta. 180a"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"116 APPENDIX C Bhairava now goes onto discuss an interesting matter which concerns both the exegesis of these Tantric texts and how they are conceived to be related to one another. Bhairava explains that there are five types of basic Tantras (sutra) which disclose the different levels of meaning of the teachings.40 These are as follows: Mulasutra: This is the root Tantra. There are different root Tantras for each pitha.41 Each one is supposed to deal extensively with the teachings of a given tradition as a whole. It is the text which indicates (sucaka) the entire extent of the doctrines and ritual procedures of its tradition. Guhyasutra: The Tantras of this type discuss the hidden esoteric meaning of the teachings. Nayasutra: These Tantras deal with how the adept is likely to fall from the path and lose the attainments he has already acquired (siddhi) and how he can get them back. Uttarasutra: This discusses and clarifies the intended sense of the teachings as determined by these sutras. The Uttarottarasutra: This elucidates and supplements what remains to be understood or has, inadvertently, not been dealt with fully in the previous four sutras. It is said to teach the ultimate purport of these scriptures just as it is inherently in itself and beyond all thought-constructs (nirvikalpa). It is the teacher's responsibility to expound the meaning of the scriptures clearly. He does this by connecting their sense into a coherent whole through a number of correlates (sambandha)he establishes between their contents. He deals with the root Tantras individually at first in order to bring out the underlying coherence between them and their associated Tantras, and to then ideally establish it between all the sutras and their teachings. According to the JY, there are five correlates which, by implication, it juxtaposes with the five types of sutras. These are: Indication (sucana): The teacher summarizes what has been taught before and on the basis of that indicates what is going to be taught further. Preliminary Exposition (abhidhana) Validation (gamaka): The teacher now gradually unfolds the meaning of the sutra. In order to make it clear, he makes use of examples and refutes possible objections. Clarification (prakasaka): This follows from the previous correlate."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"Canon of Jayadrathayamala 117 Ordering the Disordered (sahkirna): In order to explain the meaning of a Tantra, the teacher must distinguish between the sections of it which deal with particular matters. As he proceeds from one chapter to the next of the Tantra, he points out where one topic begins and another ends. He deals first with each section individually and then indicates how they are related to the others. Other Agamas also deal with these correlations in their own way. Abhinava devotes a section of his Tantraloka to an explanation of how the teacher should transmit the meaning of the scriptures to his disciples (vyakhyavidhi).42 Abhinava bases himself mostly on the Devyayamala which Jayaratha accordingly quotes extensively in his commentary. Paraphrasing this Tantra, Abhinava starts by saying that there are five kinds of teachers: Those who know just one Kalpa, that is, a version of a given root Tantra or a Tantra associated with it. Those who know the entire range of Kalpas associated with a given Tantra. Those who know all scriptures belonging to a given class (Sasira). Those who know the meaning of all the Samhitas. Those who know all the classes of scriptures.4' The best teacher is, of course, one that belongs to the fifth group. However, if a student cannot find a teacher who knows the scriptures in their entirety, he should seek a teacher who is well conversant with the particular Tantra he wishes to learn and whose teachings he seeks to put into practice. The Devyayamala, like the JY, says that there are five correlates through which the teacher can explain the meaning of a Tantra with reasoned argument in order to preserve the doctrines of his own tradition (svamnaya). These are: The Sections (pada): Theoretically a Tantra of the Samhita type is divided into four sections, called pada. The teacher must first explain the overall sense of the Tantra. He does this by dealing with each one of these sections, explaining their contents in general terms in the order in which they appear in the beginning, middle and end of each section. The Coherence of Each Section (pddagaia): The teacher should explain how each part of each section fits with every other in a coherent manner"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"118 APPENDIX C and without contradictions. The Chapters (patala): The teacher can now explain the contents of the Tantra chapter by chapter and in so doing connect one to the other. The Meaning of the Words (padartha): The teacher now explains each statement in the Tantra individually. The Meaning of the Sutra: The teacher can now deal with the entire root Tantra. He reflects on its overall content, distinguishing it from other sutras, in order to elucidate its unique character in relation to other sutras.44 Although the divisions into grades of sutras is more theoretical than real, it is interesting to observe how the Agamas attempted to find through it coherence in their extensive and diverse literature. Certainly some Tantras were more closely linked to each other than were others; even so we can't help feeling that we have here an ideal scheme. We can compare this scheme with the Buddhist Tantras which do, in fact, tend to develop in this way, at least in part. Perhaps we might hazard to suggest that the Saiva Tantras took over this scheme as a theoretical possibility which did, in a partial way reflect an aspect of the relationship between the Tantras and their traditions. The Rudrayamala. Eleven Samhitas are associated with the Rudra-yamala: Arthasara, Suradharma, Daityaghni, Virarthina, Virasara, Raudri, Mudrantamalini, Kalottara, Kalaghni, Mahamrtunjaya and Candabhairava.45 180a The Visnuyamala. The line of transmission of this Yamala is as follows Sadasiva - Kapalisa - Svacchanda - Krodha - Ucchusma - Ruru -Candabhairava - Unmatta - Virabhairava - Ananta - Bhaskara -Manthana - Nilakamha - Bhima - Vamaka - Mahakala - Visnu -Munindra - Sandilya. Associated with this Yamala are the following Samhitas: Trimundini Bahurupa, Ucchusma, Canda, Pronmatta, Virabhairava, Anantamata Anantabhaskara, Trnaka (?) and Anantavijaya. A group of four Samhita: collectively called \"rupa\"are said to be derived from the Anantavijaya These are Bhima, Varna, Mahakali and Grdhrapati. Along with these scriptures is the Kalavadanasamhita of twenty-one thousand verses and the Visnupasamhita of six thousand verses. The Durdarsanasamhita (also called Sudarsana) of three thousand five hundred verses was brought to earth by Sandilya. 181b Skandayamala. This Tantra, also called the \"Senapatiyamala\", was"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"Canon of Jayadrathayamala 119 transmitted along the following lineage: Tejodhaman - Prthusiras -Samadrsa - Visvabhuk - Visavalayagola - Bhairava - Consort -Visakha - Kunjaramukha - Sambhadra - Virabhadra - Ugracanda -Mahendra - Candrarkavayumuni - Manugana. The Samhitas associated with this Yamala are Gauhasphanda, Analakdntha, Visacchada, Saisava, Mayurasikha, Ramanodbhava, Varada and Lilotpatamalika. Umayamala. The line of transmission of this Yamala is as follows (Bhagarudra) Bhairava - Asitadrsa (Krsnaksa) - Yamantaka -Pingalesa - Humkara - Sahkukarna - Pingala - Mrtyunjaya. There are eight Samhitas associated with this Yamala and they are said to belong to all four pithas. These are Uma, Rauravi, Bhima, Gambhira, Langala, Matryananda, Surananda and Bhairavananda. The Umayamala is supposed to have originated from the Soma-yamala while countless other yamalas are supposed to be derived from the other ones. These include four Devatayamalas, four Dutibhavayamalas, four Kinkiniyamalas, six Yoginiyamalas, eighteen Bhimayamalas, ten Dakiniyamalas and a number of Matryamalas. 182a 4. The Mudrapitha The Mudrapilha is also called the Kriyasutra, probably because Mudra is a manifestation of the power of action (Kriyasakti) just as Mantra is a manifestation of the power of knowledge. The revealer of the Tantras of this pitha is Bhairava who also created the sixty-four Bhairavatantras. The Mudra which the Tantras of this pitha are said to disclose is the Gesture or Seal of Emptiness (vyomamayi mudra). It is one's own authentic nature {svasvabhava) that is self-established and delights in eternal bliss. This seal is 'stamped' onto all the relationships between the categories of existence and melts away all bodily bondage. When it descends onto the level of the empirical world where meditation and its object are distinct, it is variously conceived and so assumes countless forms. Three root Tantras belong to this pitha: Hrdbheda. All the JY tells us about this Tantra is the line of its trans­mission which is as follows: Phetkarabhairava - Kantichatra - ? -Prapalambha - Niranjana - Vyapin - Vigrahesvara - Bhairava -goddess who revealed a short version to mankind. Matrbheda. Bhairava explains that this Tantra is so-called because it exalts the mother (matr) in whom and by whom all the universe is 183b"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"120 APPENDIX C measured (mapita) and saved (tranita) and of whom there are many diverse forms (bheda).46 There are five Samhitas associated with the Matrbheda, namely Aparajita, Vastuvidya, Sarvabimba, Karotini, Siddhasarartha, Citrartha (?).47 184a The Kubjikamata. The KMT is said to have originated in the mountains.48 It is considered to be the most important Tantra of the Mudrapitha although it is linked with all the pithas. This is the Tantra of the goddess Kubjika. She is the power Beyond Mind (manonmani) who, in the bliss of loving union (samplava), withdraws her limbs to form the divine triangle of the Seed (bija). Drop (bindu) and Sound (nada) through which the universe is created. The KMT is said to deal with the Seal of Speech (vacika mudra). This is of countless forms although it consists essentially of the fifty letters of the alphabet. It denotes the meaning of countless words and indicates the true nature of things leading thus to its realization. The sections (or associated texts) of this Tantra are Ekaksara, Dvyaksara, Padamala, Sabdamala, Sabdamalartha, Malini, Vakyamala and Vidyamala. 5. Mandalapitha This pitha is said to be equally present (samanya) in the other three pithas. Although it has only one mulasutra, which is not named here, it is divided in many parts (kalpa). The line of transmission is as follows: Pancasekhara who brought it to earth transmitted it to RatiSekhara -Samharabhairava - Dindi - Dandesvara - Ghoreya - Gomati -Trikala - Srikantha - Bhairava - Brahma who heard it in each pitha. 6. The 'Eight Times Eight' Bhairavatantras After the goddess has been told about the contents of the four pithas associated with Bhairava, she then wants to know about the sixty-four Bhairavatantras said to constitute the Wheel governed by Sadasiva. These Tantras are listed below along with the names of their teachers who are considered to be incarnations of Bhairava. The ordering of the eight groups is just as we find it in the SKS (see above p. 45 ff.). Moreover, more than half of the Tantras listed in the SKS are the same as those listed here. We have therefore recorded their names in a separate column as shown in Table 9."},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"Table 9. The Sixty-Four Bhairavatantras.

The Srotas Division The JY knows and accepts the standard classification of the Saivagama into five currents and even explicitly states that this is the original basic form of the canon.50 However, it also refers to a sixth Upper Current which we shall discuss later. Each of these six Currents is here analysed in terms of the transmission of the teachings of the Tantras belonging to them. They are, in other words, distinguished from one another on the basis of the teachers (guru) and traditions (santati, santana) associated with them.51 Each of Sadasiva's five faces (with the sixth Current above them) is accordingly linked with a family of lineages technically called \"gotra\" to which belong various lines of transmission (santati). The members of each Current (or gotra) undertake vows (vrata) and practice their own particular disciplines (carya) which the JY enumerates for each in serial order. Again, each Current has its own monastic centres called mathikas. It is not essential to list all these names here; we shall limit ourselves instead to making a few observations. Firstly, it is worth noting that the Agamas understand themselves as transmitted doctrine not just as scripture. It is the living tradition that matters and hence also the teacher who preserves and passes it on to his disciples. Although each Current has its teachers, the ideal teacher according to the Bhairavagamas is one who knows all six Currents. He alone can explain the teachings of each Current along with their esoteric meaning.52 The personal imparting of the teaching to a small group of disciples entails the existence of numerous monastic centres, each of which is headed by its own teacher who can bequeath it to his successor.53 Some of these monastic centres came to prominence and acquired an importance in their own right. The Kashmiri tradition, for example, associates the dualist, monist and qualified monistic schools of Saivism with three mathikas named after Tryambaka, Amardaka and Srinatha respectively.54 The word \"mathika\" thus comes ultimately to denote a particular school of thought associated"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"124 APPENDIX C with the founder of the monastic centre from which it was propagated. The JY, as we have said, accepts the basic Five Current division of the Saivagamas. However, although it does classify them in these terms, it does not concern itself to do so in detail. The Siva and Rudra division of the Siddhantagamas are said, as usual, to consist of ten and eighteen Agamas respectively. The Left Current consists of the Tantras which 'delude'55 which is clearly an allusion to the Sammohanatantra that is regularly considered to characterize the scriptures of this Current. The Current of the Right contains, amongst others, the sixty-four Bhairava-tantras and the Yamalas. To this Current also belong the SvT and the entire Mantra and Mudrapitha.56 The Garuda and Bhutatantras are characterized in the usual way as concerned with remedies for poison and with exorcism respectively.57 They are ascribed, as usual, to the Eastern and Western Currents.58 The Tantras of the Left Current are said to deal with the acquisition of the eight yogic powers (siddhi) and power to control others,59 while the Right Current is the eternal non-dual abode of all the pleasures of this world and every type of liberation.60 The Sixth Current is above the others. It belongs particularly to Siva's power through which all the traditions and their teachings are revealed in this world.61 Siva is the root source of all the Agamas; infinite and full of the knowledge of consciousness he is both omniform and tranquil like a waveless sea. His power is his vitality (virya) whose field is the delight of the abode of consciousness and is beautiful with its blissful pulsation generated through the diversity of its immanently manifest and transcendentally unmanifest forms.62 This vitality is Speech at all levels63 and pours out of universal consciousness in countless extensions (prasara) of its power of which the six Currents of scripture are the main streams.64 Full of this divine power at its very source the Sixth Current leads to realization in an instant with great force (hathat) and so the form of Siva that governs it is Hathakesvara. He is said to know the mysteries of Kula and Kaula and so all the secret teachings originate from here. Conse­quently this Current is present in those of the Left and Right.65 Moreover, although it flows in the upper regions (urdhvd) it is also connected with the lower ones as well, that is, with those frequently assigned, as we have seen, to the Kulagama. Thus Hathakesvara's domain is said to be \"the abode of the fire of time\" which burns in the hells below the world-order. The SvT confirms that Hataka is the name of the Lord of Sauvarna which is the eighth and lowest hell66 while the JY tells us that all the lords of the hells (patalanayaka) are born from Hathakesvara's mouth.67 According to a passage quoted by Abhinavagupta from the Rauragama,68 when Srikantha resides in the hell worlds he assumes the form of Hataka because he bestows yogic powers suddenly and with great force (hathatah) while \\"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"Canon of Jayadrathayanala 125 the J Y expressly states that the Upper Current \"bestows all yogic powers.\" The Anandadhikaratantra69 declares that Hataka is the lord of the hell where souls burn in the \"fire of time.\" This place is destined for those initiates who have broken their pledges and, more especially, for those who, although votaries of the Left-hand Path, censor it. Here, according to this Tantra, go those who have been taught higher doctrine but have, nonetheless, resorted to lower teachings or Mantras of a lower order such as those practised by the devotees of Garuda. They can, however, free themselves of their suffering by offering themselves to Lord Hataka and so reach the higher divine principles and then, from there, ultimately merge into Siva.70 8. Conclusion Accounts such as these not only teach us a great deal about the extent of the Agamic corpus but also about its history and, consequently, about the history of the development of Agamic Saivism. We should, however, treat these accounts with caution. As we have seen, all the major Agamas have their own peculiar view of the Saiva canon and, although their accounts are in many ways compatible and even supplement each other, none of them are either complete or unbiased. Moreover, they give rise to many questions which still remain unsettled. Thus, we cannot help asking ourselves whether all these Tantras did, in fact, exist. For example, although the eight Bhairava Tantras are generally considered to form a standard group, it is by no means certain whether they all existed. Certainly the Svacchandatantra, at least, does and possibly a number of others but it is hard to believe that all the Tantras said here to have been associated with them did as well. Bhairavas are commonly worshipped in groups of eight while the group which has given its name to these Tantras is particularly well known. It is hard not to suspect that these lists are not entirely genuine when we notice that groups of eight are such recurrent features in them. May it not be the case that some of these titles are purely fictitious additions to fill out ideal schemes? We can only be sure that a Tantra existed when we find additional evidence to corroborate the statements made in accounts such as these. We must, for example, find direct quotations from it, or reference to it in independent sources such as inscriptions. Best of all, of course, would be to find the text itself or fragments of it. Again, how genuine are the names listed in the lines of transmission of these Tantras? Certainly the gods, divine beings and Upanisadic sages who figure in these accounts cannot be considered to be historical figures"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"126 APPENDIX C connected with them. Even so, it is not impossible that the last few members of these lines did, in fact, live at some time and propagated these Tantras; perhaps, indeed, they even wrote them. It is worth noting, however, that the account of the line of transmission given here of the SYM and its own account as presented by Abhinavagupta in the Tantraloka do not agree. This fact should put us on our guard to deal cautiously with what these account tell us because our knowledge of the extent and content of even the extant Tantras is still very superficial. Even so, there can be little doubt that future research will reveal a vast field of inquiry and that these accounts of the Saivagamic canon will serve as important guidelines by which we may orient ourselves in the course of work to help us to locate ourselves in this vast body of literature."},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"APPENDIX D Manuscripts of the Kubjikatantras For almost twenty years German scholars have been directing a project to photograph manuscripts in Nepal. Amongst the many thousands of manuscripts that have been photographed so far, there are many of Tantras and related literature belonging the the Kubjika school. Unfortunately, no descriptive catalogue of the manuscripts the project has photographed has as yet been prepared and, due to the amount of material. collected, it will probably take a great deal of time to produce. In the meantime, in order to make part of this new material more readily accessible, we have listed below some manuscripts relevant to the study of the Kubjika cult. This list is by no means exhaustive. For one thing, I have had the opportunity to consult only the index cards of the microfilms made of manuscripts belonging to the National Archives in Kathmandu. I have not had the time to see index cards of the numerous manuscripts in private collections the project has photographed and so they could not be listed here. Nor have short tracts with generic titles such as\"Kubjikapuja''been included, both because they are very many and also because it is impossible to assess their content or value without seeing them. For the same reason I have had to list many manuscripts of sections of the MBT as \"unidenti­fied.\" I have also not listed manuscripts of the KMT (also called Kulalikamnaya) because it has already been edited by Goudriaan and Schoterman. A few entries, such as the important Satsahasra, are listed without reel numbers. This is because it appears that the project has failed to photograph these manuscripts although they are listed in the catalogues.

That the Pascimamnaya was known in Kashmir is established by a number of references. Thus Abhinavagupta quotes from the Kubjikdmata in PTv, p. 184. Unfortunately, this reference has not been traced in the 3500 verse recension edited, but as yet unpublished, by T. Goudriaan and J. A. Schoterman. Jayaratha quotes an unknown Agama which refers to the Thohakasamata of the Pascimamnaya: madyariktastu ye devi na te siddhyanti pascime | thohakasamate nityam kulabhrastah svayambhuvah || (TA, vol. Xlb, p. 13). In the following verse, quoted by Jayaratha in his commentary on the Vamakesvarimata from an older commentary by the Kashmiri Allata, Kubjika, the goddess of the Pascimamnaya, is mentioned: urmiriti bhoginityapi kubjeti kulesvariti jagaduryam | srikalakarsanltyapi kundalinityapi ca naumi tarn devim || (VMT, p. 28). Another reference is found in the following passage which Jayaratha quotes without naming his source: \"The triangle is called the female organ (bhaga), the secret circle in the Sky. Its corners are will, knowledge and action and in its centre is the sequence (krama) of Cincini.\" (TA, vol. 11, p. 104). The worship of the absolute viewed as the source of cosmic manifestation symbolized by the female organ from whence arises the power of Kundalini is an important feature of the Tantras of the Pascimamnaya. Kubjika, the Supreme Goddess, is frequently called Cincini (see below p. 90). In a hymn to Bhaga in the Cincinimatasdrasamuccaya we find the same verse. Thus, the first line of Jayaratha's quote reads: trikonam bhagam ityuktam viyatstham guptamandalam | In the CMSS (fl. 10b, line 1): bhagam trikonavikhyatam dhiyastham guptamandalam | The second line is identical. We cannot be sure that Jayaratha quoted this verse from the CMSS, but there can be little doubt that he drew it from a Tantra of the same school. Also, in the KNT a sudra named Srasehila, whose initiatory name was Ramanandanatha, is listed as being a follower of the Pascimamnaya who lived in Kashmir. Bagchi KJN, p. 69."},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"Notes to Part One 139 24. Although the SvT is a Bhairavatantra and not a Siddhantagama, the initiations and other ritual procedures it describes are similar to those of the Siddhanta. Consequently, Somasambhu (eleventh century) incorporates a great deal of material from the SvT in his compendium of Siddhanta ritual, the Kramakandakramavali better known as the Somasambhupaddhati. Composed in South India, this manual is the oldest one still extant. Although no longer in use, Aghorasivacarya's Kriyakramadyotika (written in 1158 A.D.), which is still popular in South India, follows the SSP very closely. Brunner in her notes on the SSP frequently refers to the SvT without thereby contravening her principle not to quote from Agamas whose rituals differ radically from these of the SSP. The SvT, which she describes as a revealed text of Kashmiri Saivism (SSP, vol. Ill, intro. p. liv), evidently inspired Somasambhu. Brunner notes that a number of cosmological concepts and forms of yoga the Siddhanta does not know about have passed from the Northern to the Southern Agamic schools through this text (ibid). But even though the SvT adds something new to Siddhanta ritual, it is clearly compatible with it and shares much in common with it, even in matters of detail. Indeed, old South Indian authorities on Siddhanta ritual refer to it frequently as does, for example, Nirmalamani in his commentary on Aghorasiva's manual. Visvanatha in his Siddhantasekhara and Isanasivagurudeva in his paddhati go so far as to prefer, at times, to follow the SvT in matters of detail concerning ritual and cosmography rather than the Siddhantagamas (SSP, vol. Ill, p. 185). 25. Jayaratha more than once refers his reader to a teacher for information about matters he feels that he cannot elaborate, particularly the secret details of Kaula ritual. Thus when dealing with how the sacrificial vessel should be filled in the course of a Kaula rite he says: yasca atra etat purane sampradayah sa rahasyatvat samayabhariga-bhayac ca na iha asmabhih pradarsita iti | etad gurumukhad eva boddhavyam | (TA, vol. Xlb, p. 19). Such passages indicate that differences of opinion prevailed about practice in his day (see also TA, vol. Xlb, pp. 40-1), clearly proving that these rituals were actively performed in Kashmir at that time. There is ample evidence that Kashmir was a society where Kaula ritual was an active concern of an appreciable, although probably small, part of the populace. This, as one would expect, charmed and pleased sincere Saivites of Abhinavagupta's stamp who wrote enthusiastically about Kaula ritual in Kashmir. Thus, in a poetic vein, he praises the wine Kaulas drink: [This is] the wine which imparts boldness to the words of lovers and frees them from fear while making love; the wine in which all the deities [of consciousness] who reside in the shade of the tree of the Kali age and practice mystic union (cakracarya) gladly abide; the wine which here [in Kashmir] bestows first pleasure then liberation. (TA, 37 44). But not all thought so highly of these practices. We know that bans were"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"140 NOTES imposed and practising Kaulas ostracized. Some, such as the satirist Ksemendra, who lived in Kashmir at the time, considered Kaula ritual and practice to be merely a source of moral corruption and an excuse for licence. See my Doctrine of Vibration, vol. I SUNY Press, Albany, 1987, chapter 1. 26. For definitions of the word \"Tantra\" see Tantra in Bengal: A Study in Its Origins, Development and Influence by S. C. Banerji, Naya Prakash, Calcutta 1978, pp. 1-3. 27. Renou remarks that the later Tantric texts Woodroffe studied that \"describe the worship of the great Goddess\" are called \"Tantras\" rather than \"Agamas\" (preface to SSP, vol. 1, p. 1). Brunner notes, however, that in the early Siddhantagamic context the terms \"Agama\"and \"Tantra\" are synonymous (ibid., intro. p. iv.). Thus we find the following definition of Tantra, which has been repeated frequently throughout the centuries in a wide variety of Tantric scriptures, in the Kamikagama also. This must be one of the earliest citations of this definition: tanoti vipulan arthams tattvamantrasamaSritan | tranam ca kurute yasmat tantram ityabhidhiyate || (P.Ka., 1/29). 28. Thus, Abhinavagupta, \"in the course of discussing one of the basic principles of Kaula doctrine, namely, that purity or impurity is not an inherent quality of things but a mental projection which must be overcome along with all other thought-constructs to achieve the pure conscious state of liberation says that: \"such was also (the insight of) the ancient sages (muni) by virtue of their state free of thought-constructs but who, in order not to disrupt the order of the world, concealed it.\" (TA. 4/243b-4a). 29. R. C. Hazra writes: \"At the time the chapters on vows, worship etc. first began to be included in the Puranas, the Tantric elements were eliminated as far as possible.\" Studies in the Purdnic Records on Hindu Rites and Customs, Motilal Banarsidass, 2nd edition, Delhi, 1975, p. 260. According to Hazra the additions made to the Puranas prior to the ninth century were largely free of Tantric influence. From about the beginning of the ninth century the authority of the Tantras came to be gradually recognized by the Puranas and so Tantric rituals were increasingly incorporated into them (ibid., pp. 260-2). 30. See, for example, Hazra p. 119. 31.

Thus the Rsis in the Kamikagama were, \"intent on Siva and Sakti desirous of understanding the Supreme Knowledge.\" They praise Siva saying of Him; [You) are of the nature of the flow of innate bliss whose characteristic is one's own consciousness, [You Who are] united with the Supreme Power whose nature is supreme consciousness. (P.Ka., l/7a-8b). 49. There are a number of later Tantras whose names are the same as Tantras of the older group; examples of these are the Kulacuddmani, Kularnava, Tantraraja, Guplatantra, Jayadralhayamala, Saipmohanatanira and a medieval work not at all associated with the Pascimamnaya called Kubjikaiamra. Schrader writes: \"That occasionally the same name has been given to two or even more different works is nothing unusual in Agamic literature. For instance, among the Sakta Tantras there are, . . . three Prapanca tantras, two Harigauri tantras, three Kubjika tantras, two Yogini tantras and two Mrdani (?) tantras.\" Introduction to the Pancaratra and Ahirbudhnya Samhitd by F. Otto Schrader, Adyar Library Series, Adyar, 2nd edition 1973, pp. 14-5. In the later period Saktatantras are distinguished from Saivatantras and called \"Nigama\" and \"Agama\" respectively. The characterizing distinction between them is stated to be that the former are spoken by the goddess and the latter by the god. Originally the Tantras were generally spoken by the male"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"142 NOTES partner to his companion, however much they may have been concerned with female divinities and their rituals. Thus the NSA, which belongs to the early period but was in the later period considered (quite justifiably in terms of its content) to be an exemplary Saktatantra, is taught by Isvara to the goddess The goddess herself remarks that the god had taught all the preceding Tantras including those which the goddess defines as the \"Tantras of the Mothers\"although the ones that are listed are of many types including Siddhantagamas The passaee reads: bhagavan sarvamantrasca bhavata me prakasitah || catussastisca tantrani matrnam uttamani tu | (NSA, 1/13). evam etani sastrani tathanyanyapi kotisah | bhavatoktani me deva sarvajfianamayani tu | (Ibid., I/21b-22a). The matrtantra figure as a separate group along with the Yamalas in the Siddhantagamas (see P.Ka., 1/122) while a reference from an unknown source in Jayaratha's commentary on the TA shows that a distinction was made between the Sankaratantra and the Devitantra (see TA, vol. Xlb, p. 12). Even so, we do not find that a clearcut distinction exists between Sakta and Saiva Tantra in the early sources, even in the Kulatantras which were in practice Sakta in most respects By the middle of the ninth century, when Somananda wrote the Sivadrsti the Saktas figure as a distinct group (see ibid., chapter 3) but in this case they could arguably be said to be connected to the tradition only indirectly as its commen­tators and exegetes. The Siddhantins during this period also applied this distinction. Narayanabhatta does so in his commentary on the Mrgendragama although it is not found in the Agama itself. Thus he says: saivanam eva desikadinam iha laksanam | saktadayastu te anyadrsa eveti vijnapayitum saivapadopadanam | (Mr.T.

Pathak, pp. 4-6. 87. Lorenzen rejects the view that Pasupata orders existed before Lakulisa and declares that \"Lakulisa was in all likelihood the founder of the Pasupata order.\" (Lorenzen p. 175). This was also R. G. Bhandarkar's view. He remarks: \"Lakula was the general name by which the Saiva sects were called. This general name has for its basis the historical fact that a person of the name Lakulin or Lakulisa founded a Saiva system corresponding to the Pancaratra system, which the Vayu and Linga Puranas consider to be contemporaneous with it. The other general name, Pasupata, arose by dropping the name of the individual Lakulin and substituting that of the god Pasupati, whose incarnation he was believed to be.\" Quoted by Chakraborti in his introduction to the Pasupata Sutram with Pancarthabhasya by Kaundinya, Academic Publishers, Calcutta, 1970, p. 9. 88. Lakulisa's date is uncertain. Much controversy centres on an inscription published in 1931 by D. R. Bhandarkar found on a pillar near Mathura dated 380 A.D. (EI XXI 11-9). It records a donation by the Mahesvara teacher, Uditacarya. of two lingas named after his teacher, Bhagavat Kapila and grand-teacher, Bhagavat Upamita. Uditacarya is described as tenth in descent from Kusika and fourth from Parasara. Bhandarkar identified this Kusika with Kusika the disciple of Lakulisa. Thus he assigned Lakulisa to the first half of the second century A.D. (Lorenzen pp. 179-80). We cannot be sure, however, that these Saivites were indeed Lakulisa Pasupatas. A figure is sculpted on the pillar with a trident; the base shows a pot-bellied standing figure, nude with two hands, leaning on a staff and with a third eye (Lakulisa: Saivite Saini by U. P. Shah in Discourses on Siva edited with an introduction by Michael W. Meister, Vakils, Feffer and Simons Ltd., Bombay, 1984, p. 96). There is no mention in the inscription of the Pasupatas nor of Lakulisa; nor does the figure on the pillar bear the standard attributes of Lakulisa. Even so, Kusika is well known as one of Lakulisa's disciples who heads a lineage of Lakulisa Pasupatas. That this name is found associated with a Saivite ascetic has seemed to most scholars grounds enough to accept this identification. But whether this date is correct or not, a fairly regular iconography of Lakulisa as a Saivite saint begins to emerge by about the sixth century (Shah p. 97) and so must belong to at least the fifth century. 89.

According to him, consciousness is the one reality and so can never be contamin­ated.

This is why the Viravalitantra declares that \"the ancient rsis ate both beef and human flesh\"(TA, III, p. 268).

The compound sa + uma = soma, implies the Kapalika's creed, i.e., Somasiddhanta, which affirms that the liberated condition is analogous to the bliss (ananda) experienced in sexual union which reflects that of the union of Siva with his consort Uma. The word \"soma \"also means moon and so the Kapalikas have accordingly been associated with the moon. See Bhattotpala's commentary on Varahamihira's Brhajjataka 15/1. 149.

One such Kalamukha teacher was Somesvara who is praised in several inscriptions. Thus, for example, in an inscription found at Belgave dated 1103 A.D., Somesvara is eulogized as: \"he who is gracious to learned men, he who is a very sun to (open) the great cluster of water-lilies (blooming in the daytime) that is the Nyayasastra, and who is a very autumn moon to bring to full tide the ocean of Vaisesikas; he who is the very ruby ornament of those who are versed in the Samkhyagarna, and who is a very bee on the water-lilies that are the feet of his teacher; he who is a very spring to the grove of mango trees that is the Sabdasdstra and who gave new life to the Lakulasiddhanta by the development of his wisdom.\" (Ed. and trans, by Fleet EI V, 220 quoted by Lorenzen, p. 113). Such terms as \"Lakuldgama\" or \"Lakulasiddhanta\" recur frequently in Kalamukha epigraphs (ibid., p. 110). I believe, as does Lorenzen, that these names, or even the expression \"Paramatmagama,\" refer equally, according to the context, both to the doctrines of the Lakulisa Pasupata and the Saivagamas in general. 164. Thus Narayanabhatta says: tatha hi sargadau paramesvarah urdhvapragdaksinottarapascima-srotah pancakabhedabhinnam jnanam | (Mr.Vr.Vidyapada, p. 7). 165.

Goudriaan has made a chart of the forms of Tumburu, his attendants and Mantras found in a variety of Puranic and Tantric sources on pp. 47-50 of this book to which the reader is referred. Tumburu is well known in lexicons and Buddhist works as a Gandharva and musician. (Bagchi, p. 12) He is often associated with Narada as an attendant of the gods (Goudriaan, p. 18). He also figures as an authority on music in the Samgitaloka and the tambura may well have got its name from him (Bagchi, p. 13). The god Tumburu described in the Vinasikhalantra has nothing to do with music, nor is he associated with the vina despite the title of the Tantra. He is also devoid of these associations in the"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"150   NOTES   sources Goudriaan has consulted. However, a description of Tumburu, white in colour with two arms and one face, wearing a tiger's skin sitting on a bull playing the vina is recorded in the PLSS. (See line drawing on p. 39 in vol. I). A more extensive description of Tumburu is found in the fifth chapter of the first satka of the JY (NA, no. 5/4650, fl. 22a ff.). Here Tumburu's association with music is clearly evident. According to the JY, Tumburu is the Lord Himself (prabhu) and is called the Great Fierce One (mahavyala), the crest jewel (siroratna) of all the gods as their Topknot (sikha) - a term used in these Tantras to refer to Kundalini. He has two aspects, one without form (asakala) and the other with form (sakala); it is the latter which is described here. He has four energies (kala) which reside in the Cave of the Heart of His universal consciousness. These are: Santikala, Vidyakala, Nirvrti-kala and Pratisthakala. They correspond to the goddesses Jaya, Vijaya, Ajita and Aparajita who generate the phenomenal universe (karya) while He Himself is the fifth and highest energy - Santyatitakala - which transcends all manifestation. Thus He resides in the Abode of Tranquility (saumyadhama) which is full of the savour of countless Mantras. His entire body is illuminated by the circle of His light and the rays of the jewels of His many Vidyas. He smells sweetly with the scent of many garlands and His body is stained with blood. He makes the gesture of the Saktipitha and His mandala is that of Candradurdanda. He has four hands in which he holds a noose, hook, trident and makes the gesture of bestowing boons. He has four faces which are white, red, yellow and dark blue (krsna). His body is like a blazing light shining brilliantly like mount Meru. His principal face is like that of a human being whose lotus-like eyes are blooming and is most beautiful. He wears an earring and its rays cover His face in a network of light. His neck is like a precious gem and His hand is adorned with a ruby ring set in emerald. He wears emeralds and rubies and His broad hips are covered with Kasmiri cloth. From His mouth comes a deep sound like the rumble of a storm cloud. Of His remaining faces one is that of a crocodile while the two others are those of swans singing sweetly. The pollen of His lotus feet bestows bliss to the Viras. The hook He holds is the goad of the universe. His noose is the abode of all the fetters (pasa) which bind beings as they rise to higher levels or descend. The trident He playfully carries has for its three prongs persistence, arising and destruction. He bestows all that men desire with His wish-bestowing gesture. Tumburu resides in the circle of the fourteen powers of the Great Fetters (mahapasa) and is surrounded by a host of female attendants (duti) and servants. His hosts laugh and shout terribly and their forms are hideously disfigured while He is the Great Hero who can destroy the entire universe by the mere thwang of His bow. At the same time He is the source of all phenomenal existence (bhava) and its saviour. He is the cosmic breath (hamsa), the Great Lord of Time and the Fire of Time. He stands (or sits?) on a lotus of four petals. On the eastern petal is seated Jaya, on the southern Jayesvari, on the northern Jita, while Parajita is in the west. They are the sisters of Tumburu and all play vinas. Tumburu's association with music - particularly the vina - is also brought out by a number of goddesses amongst the many that surround Him who are said to be skilled in playing this"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"Notes to Part One 151 instrument.

G.P., 3/8 expressly says that \"Garuda is Visnu\" (garudah sa harih). For Gamma's sincere devotion, Visnu grants him the boon that he will become Visnu (ibid., 2/55a) and the mere sight or recollection of him will destroy serpents (ibid., 3/7b). In other places he is said to be Siva Himself, e.g., ibid., 197/51. 215. G.P., 2/52 if. 216. Ibid., 2/51-57. The Kasyapasamhita of the Pancaratra (ed. by Sri Yathiraja Sampathkumaramuni, Madras 1933) is concerned entirely with the exposition of the Garudamantra. It is a text on snake bites and cures. It is, however, a unique work in the Pancaratra corpus so much so that this has led to the suspicion that it is not canonical even though the worship of Garuda as a cure for snake bites is counselled in certainly genuine Pancaratra texts (e.g., Brhadbrahmasamhita II, 3, 36-57). See The Smith Agama Collection: Sanskrit Books and Manuscripts Relating to Pancaratra Studies by David H. Smith, Syracuse 1978, pp. 21-23. 217. TA, 37/12b-13. 218. This preliminary identification with Bhairava is interesting. The purpose of it here seems to be to reinforce the efficacy of the adept's identification with Garuda. Bhairava is also depicted as a powerful being who can counter the effect of hostile planets, protect fields, defeat ghosts and raksasas as well as counter the effects of poison (G.P., 20/14). 219.

There"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"Notes to Part One 153 are a number of cases where we notice that a text travels from one group to another or, to put it another way, is appropriated by other groups. 224. \"bhairavagamesu daksinasrotah samutthesu svacchandacandatrisiro-bhairavadisu bheditam |\" (NTu, vol. 1, p. 225). These three Tantras are No. 1, 2 and 24 in the list of the Daksinalanlras. Also SvT, vol. 1, p. 8. 225. Abhinavagupta exalts the Bhairavataniras which he considered to be the highest of the five currents of scripture: XXXXXX srotah pancakam yat tato'pyalam | utkrstam bhairavabhikhyam XXXXXXXX (TA, 37/17). 226. At the Institut Francais D'Indologie in Pondicherry, transcripts have been made of all twenty-eight Siddhantagamas. MSs of many of the two hundred-odd updgamas have also been collected. 227. So, for example, the Neiratantra says: sarvagamavidhanena bhavabhedena siddhidam | vamadaksinasiddhantasauravaisnavavaidike | (NT, 9/2). 228. In certain MSs (e.g., NA, 1/285) the colophons describe this tantra as: sarvasrotasamgrahasarah | i.e., \"the essence of the summary of all the currents of scripture.\" 229. NT, 9/11. 230. Thus the goddess says: yad uktam daksinam srotarn vamam caiva tatha param | madhyamasca tatha srotam coditah purvam eva hi || (BY, MS no. NA 1/296, fl. 187b). (Philological note- the word srotas is a neuter noun ending in the consonant \"s.\" Here it is treated as if it were a neuter noun ending in \"a.\" Accordingly, the form of the nominative singular is srotam rather than srotas.) 231. These energies constitute a standard triad of will, knowledge and action. Their iconic forms in the BY are portrayals of the goddess in the three ages of life, namely, youth, maturity and old age. (See Ghosal Sastri, vol. 11, part IV p. 13. Sastri bases his brief account of this triad on a MS of the BY deposited in the library of Visvabharati University, no. sil. 16/3, fol. 6a). It seems that we have a prior parallel here for the Trika identification of the three currents with Para, Parapara and Apara who are the three goddesses that are the focus of Trika ritual. This identification is made in the Srikanthiyasamhila although there the three currents are differently defined. 232. \"asesamalasamdoharanjitah madhyamasrayah |\" (BY, ibid., fl. 188a). Note: The rules of euphonic combination have not been observed here; ranjilah should be ranjito. 233. Sivqjnana is here expressly identified with the Siva and Rudrabheda of the Madhyamasrotas; thus the parajnana of the Siddhanta becomes just a part of jnanaugha."},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"154 NOTES 234. It is certainly not at all clear whether we can, in fact, make such clear-cut distinctions, although generally speaking the Siddhantagamas do tend to be dualistic, unlike the Bhairavatantras which are predominantly monist. Even so, it is certainly not possible to distinguish the Sivagamas from the Rudragamas on the basis that the former are dualist while the latter conceive reality to be a unity-in-difference. 235. Abhinavagupta goes further by making all the Saivagama ultimately a part of Trika. The god who utters the scripture is not the five-headed Sadasiva of the Siddhanta. The Supreme Lord who spoke the three types of scripture (of the Left, Right and Siddhanta) is in fact three-headed. He is Trisirobhairava, the Trika form of Siva: tad vibhavayati bhedavibhagam tat sphutatvakrd athoktam anantam | samgrahisnu paramesvararupam vastutas trisira eva nirahuh || (MVV, 1/397). 236. This state of affairs is peculiar to the Srikanthi which does anyway, in a sense, retain the Vamatantras as a part of the same standard, older division into srotas although it is relegated to the lower level of a secondary, subsidiary class­ification. Other Trikalaniras such as the Bhargasikha and Nisisamcara sustain the continued existence of the Vamatantras although they integrate them into Trika. There was, however, certainly a tendency for the Vamatantras to lose their identity in the ambiance of Kashmiri Saiva Trika. 237. The Sikhabheda in the SKS consists of the following eight Tantras: Bhairavi called Sikha, Vina, Vinomani, Sammohanam, Damaram, Alharvakam, Kabandha and Sirascheda. In the Vamatantra list Vina is the seventh, Sammohanam may correspond to the fourth called Mohanam and Vmamani to the fourteenth called Cintamanimahodayam (although this identification is certainly more tenuous than the previous one). Also worth noting is that the Sirascheda, which is the Jayadralhayamala, finds itself in this, rather than in the Yamala group, possibly indicating its closer affiliation to the Vamatantras. 238. That there was some problem here is confirmed by the fact that the correspondent member in the Bhairavastaka is called simply \"Bhairava.\" 239. P.Ka, l/27a. 240.

There can be no doubt that the Yoginihrdaya, which mentions the NSA in many places and has been even considered to be the second part of it, is at least contemporaneous with it. 246. Amongst the eight Yamalas noted in the SKS the following are not named above: Svacchanda0, Ruru\", Atharvana\" and Vetala0. We know of others from references; thus the Devyayamala is an important scripture quoted in the Tamraloka and elsewhere (see LAS, vol. II, pp. 84-90). There is also the Samkarsiniyamala (quoted in TA, vol. IX, p. 139). Again, although the Yamalas which have been preserved - namely, the JY, BY and fragments of the Umayamala - belong to the Bhairavasrotas, Yamala was considered by Trika to be higher than the Daksinasrotas. Thus Abhinava writes in the TA, probably quoting from the SYM: vidyakalantam siddhante vamadaksinasastrayoh | sadasivantam samanaparyantam matayamale || (TA, 15/319). 247. See above footnote no. 92. 248. The lists of sixty-four Tantras in Laksmidhara's commentary on the Saundaryalahari and Bhaskara's setubandha commentary on the NSA as well as the one in the Kulacudamanitanira are almost the same as that of the NSA. There can be little doubt that they adopted it wholesale as a standard canonical list. Other later lists of sixty-four Tantras are indeed different and probably do present an actual account of the Tantras at the time of their compilation. Even so, the Tantras were listed as a group of sixty-four on the basis of the older, traditional system of classification to which the NSA subscribed. For these lists see LAS, vol. II, pp. 94-111. 249. The Goddess says at the beginning of the NSA: nityah sodasa devesa sucita na prakasitah || idanim srotum icchami tasam namani samkara | ekaikam cakrapujam ca paripurnam samantatah || (NSA, !/22b-23). 250. These are numbers 51, 52 and 53 in the list. The Kuiasara is quoted by Ksemaraja in the S.Su., vi., p. 67. It is also named in the Cininimaiasara-samuccaya of the Pascimanmaya; see NA, MS no. 1/767, fl. lb.

Another work of the same name which is more likely to be the same as the Tantra listed here is quoted by Ksemaraja in S.SC, vi., p. 29. 251. These are numbers 24, 12 and 26 in the list. The Trisirobhairavatantra is one of the Tantras Abhinavagupta quotes the most. We know from Ksemaraja that it was considered to be a Daksinasrotatantra: \"bhairavagamesu daksina-srotah samuttheju svacchandacandatrisirobhairadisu bheditam |\" (NTu, vol. 1, p. 225). There can be no doubt that this is also a Trikaiantra because Abhinava refers to it at length in chapter 30 of his Tantraloka where he deals with the Mantras of the three goddesses Para, etc., and their consorts, which is a characteristic feature of Trika. Indeed, the exposition is based essentially on the MVT and SYM, which are Trikatantras par excellence. Here the Trisirobhairava is referred to as presenting a number of variant forms of these Mantras. The Trisirobhairava is again referred to at length in TA, 3 i where the drawing of the Trisulamandala is described, the knowledge of which, according to Abhinava, is the mark of the true Trika master (TA, 31/50b-52). We know that the Nisisamcara. (also called Nisacara and Nisatana) must have been a Trikaiantra because it considered Trika to be the highest school (see quotations in TA, vol. 1, p. 49 and PTv, p. 92). A single incomplete and very corrupt MS of a Nisisamcaratamra is deposited in the NA at Kathmandu (MS no. 1 /1606). This is a palm leaf MS and the text is written in old Newari script probably belonging to the twelfth century A.D., if not earlier. The content and style is certainly of the type one would expect of a Tantra of the older group. Even so, its esoteric exposition of the pithas does not agree with that found in references from the Nisisamcara quoted in Kashmiri works, although the treatment is conceptually similar. Possibly the fragment in Kathmandu was the original Daksinatantra, although it does not affiliate itself to it or any other group anywhere in the text or the colophons. Three MSs of the SYM have been located, all of them incomplete. One is deposited in the NA -MS no. 5/2403 (23 fl.); the other two are in the Asiatic Society in Calcutta, viz. MS no. 3917D (2 fl.) and 5465 (72 fl.). The first of these two Calcutta MSs contains only the fifth chapter called \"Karikapatala.\" The second MS contains 31 chapters. Although the fragment preserved in the first MS is a part of this Tantra, it has not been traced in the second MS. Again, although a number of verses have been traced in the second MS which are quoted in Kashmiri works, it seems that this is a shorter recension than the one known in Kashmir. Perhaps this shorter recension was called \"Bhairavavirasamhita\" which is the name given to this Tantra in the colophon of chapter 21. The SYM is known to the NSA (no. 51 in the list) and the BY, clearly indicating that this is an old and well-established scripture. It itself confirms that it is a Bhairavatantra: mahabhairavatantre'smin siddhayogesvarimate | (fl. 15a). 252. proktam bhagavata kila samuhah pitham etac ca | (TA, 37/18)."},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"Notes to Part One 157 253. vidyasritani yani syu vidyapitham varanane | mantrasritani yani syu mantrapitham tatha caiva || mudrasritani yani syu mudrapithastu suvrate | mandalaplthakani syu mancjalapitha ucyate || (BY, fl. i88b).

We come across the term \"mantrapitha\" in the Siddhanta but here it refers to the seat of the deity (pitha) which is transformed in the course of the ritual into Mantra (see Mf.T., Kr. 8/196b-197). Vidyapitha in the Siddhanta refers to the Agama in general viewed as an object of veneration. The worship of the sacred scripture is a way of worshipping Siva. The Agama the disciple studies is an object of his veneration; it is therefore, on occasion, worshipped with flowers and incense, etc., as is the teacher (see SSP, vol. 1, p. 226, 290). During certain rites of atonement prescribed in the Trisirobhairavatantra, a sacred thread (pavitra) is offered to all the places of worship on the site where the ritual is performed, including the Vidyapitha which is presumably where the Agama is"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"Notes to Part One 159 worshipped (TA, 28/156b). Pascima ritual also provides for the worship of scripture. According to the MBT (Y), the Kulagama is to be worshipped in a specially prepared mandala called Vidyapitha (fl. 86a). Similarly, at the beginning of the GS the manner in which the master and then the Agama are to be worshipped is described (p. 5), while the Sat SS explains how the Tantra of the Kubjika tradition is to be worshipped before the master teaches the disciple its meaning (SatSS, 3/98-102). 281. vidyapithapradhanam ca siddhayogesvarimatam || tasyapi paramam saram malinivijayottaram | (TA, 37/24b-5a).

Abhinavagupta: An Historical and Philosophical Study by K. C. Pandey, Chowkhamba, Benares, 1963, p. 138. PART TWO 1. According to the NT (chapter 12), the presiding deity of the Kulamnaya is Bhairava. His form differs only in minor details from the Bhairava who, according to chapter II of this same Tantra, presides over the Daksinasrotas. The Goraksasamhita, a Pascimamnaya Tantra, opens with a hymn to Bhairava (pp. 1-3) who is said to be \"born of Kula and Akula, [although] free of the emergence of Kula\" (ibid., p. 162). He is, in other words, both transcendent Siva (Akula) and immanent Sakti (Kula) and at the same time free of all cosmic manifestation (Kula). Mahesvarananda says of Kulesvara, the deity every Kaula school venerates as supreme, that \"in the Kaulikatantras he is generally called Bhairava\" (MM p. 172). 2. evam etat kulamarganupravistena sarvatha -vatmananda-vyanjakatamatraparataya sevyam na tu tad gardhena | (TA, vol. Xlb, p. 67). According to Jayaratha. the Kaula's wife is not the ideal Tantric consort for him because ritual intercourse with her is attended by the danger of his succumbing to lust. Abhinavagupta, however, does not consider this to be a problem and so, according to him, ritual union (meldpa) can be of two kinds, depending on whether it takes place with one's own wife or with any other woman initiated into Kaula ritual. 3. Jayaratha quotes from an unnamed Tantra:"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"Notes to Part Two 161 He who is dedicated to Kula practice (kulacara) but is not touched by wine should practice penance, be he a brahmin or a ksatriya.

Xlb., p. 4). \"It is from whence this [cosmic] picture arises and where the universe comes to rest\" (TA, vol. XII, p. 373). 7. \"For the emission of the Lord of the Absolute is the Mistress of Kula\" (Ibid., 5/67). \"The absolute is the Supreme Abode and it is that which is called Akula. The emission of this Lord is said to be the power Kaulika\" (TA, 3/144). \"His inner intention is called Kauliki, the Supreme\" (TA, 3/137). 8. santoditam sati karanam param kaulam | (TA, 29/117a ff). 9. \"Therefore it is free of all obscuring coverings and so extroverted consciousness is awareness in the form of the means of knowledge while the object of knowledge is the object of awareness such as 'blue' or 'pleasure', at one with it. All this, be it subject or object, etc., is the essence of this expansion. The point is that there is nothing apart from that\" (TA, vol. Xlb, p. 7). 10. In the economy of the Trika of the Tantraloka, the Nisisamcaratantra is constantly referred to as the authority for this view. Doubt is the Kaula's greatest obstacle; doubt constitutes the firm bars of the prison of samsara and it is this doubt he must overcome (see TA, 12/ 18b-25). 11. ata eva hi naikatyad vamadaksinasastrayoh || dhara prantadharaprante kauliki pravijrmbhate | (MVV, l/394b-5a). 12. puspe gandhas tile tailam dehe jivo jale 'mrtam | yatha tathaiva sastranam kulam antah pratisthitam || Abhinava quotes this verse from the Kalikula in TA, 35/34, after he has said that: \"The supreme goal of (all the scriptures) is the Abode named 'Trika'. That alone is said to be Kula because [only] that which is at one with all things [and unconditioned by time and space] is perpetually manifest. Just as life is one and the same in every individual limb of the body, whether major or minor, similarly Trika is present in all things as scripture itself confirms.\" Abhinava is here clearly equating Trika with Kula in order to establish that it is present in all the scriptures as Kula. Jayaratha similarly quotes this verse to suggest that Trika is Kula. Trika, Jayaratha says, is the sixth current of scripture that consists of the Siddhanta, Varna and Bhairava Tantras. The three goddesses. Para, Parapara and Apara, reside in Trika and so it contains all the scripture and \"floods them with the nectar of Supreme Monism (paramdvaya)\" thus rendering them effective (TA, vol. I, p. 45).

Mahesvarananda is not. however, really much at odds with Abhinava because his Krama tradition is that of Anuttara which is the absolute Abhinava's Trika treats as Trika, the supreme principle itself. Accordingly, Mahesvarananda does not see much difference between Trika-darsana and Mahartha (ibid., p. 92). 13. athatah sampravaksyami kulamnayanidarsanam | yagam homam japam karyam yena sarvam avapnuyat || (NT, 12/1). 14.

Brunner, in an article on the NT, says in a footnote: \"One could ask oneself why Ksemaraja deems it necessary to explain the characteristics of this school insofar as he has said almost nothing about the others, and why he stresses the fact that it is essentially similar to them. Is it perhaps because it was not popular in his time? Or described? Or not yet integrated into the great Saiva family? One defends oneself with difficulty from the impression that this integration is achieved at the cost of a certain amount of effort. One frequently comes across references in the Neira to the triad Varna Daksina Siddhanta which seems to form a solid block: if in these cases reference is made to Kula, it is because it is not a constant fixed group; it is like an addition, in another movement of discourse.\" Un Tantra du Nord: Le \"Netra Tantra\" in BEFEO, Tome LX1, Paris, 1974 pp. 154-5. 17. After the Uttarakamika has described the five srotas we read: pascimad vamasamjnarn tu vamad daksinam uttamam | daksinat kaulikam srestham mahakaulam tatah param || purvamnayam tatas srestham tasmat siddhantam uttamam | (U.Ka, 24/92-93a). In the Mrgendragama, the Siddha - and Yogini - Kaula which, as we shall see, are important divisions in the Kulagama, are referred to as upasrotas of the five srotas.

II, p. 3). 22. tasya mathiketi kulam iti cabhidhanadvayam \\ (TA, vol. Ill, p. 296). In a different, more restricted sense, \"Kula\" was the name given to the particular group or 'family' to which a demon or malevolent spirit belonged. It was important to determine the spirit's Kula in order to invoke the Lord of that Kula to free those who were possessed by it: yasmin kule yadamsena mudritah kilitah kvacit | tat kulenaiva cesfena sarvadosaih pramucyate ]| (NT, 19/80b-la). Yaksini, Yogini, Matrka, Sakini, Dakini and other potentially malevolent spirits belonged to these Kulas. Their exorcism and propitiation is a part of Kula practice, which in some of its phases included a number of exorcistic cults. 23. Matsyendranatha (variously \"called Macchanda,\" \"Macchagnapada,\" \"Minapada,\" \"Minanatha,\" \"Macchendra\" and \"Macchagna\") is an important founder figure who is mentioned in various contexts in diverse Kaula works. The Kashmiri Trika Kaulas consider him to be the originator of the Kulagama. For an extensive treatment of the legends concerning this figure, the reader is referred to Bagchi's introduction to the Kaulajnananirnaya. Also G. Tucci, Animadversiones Indicae JASB, N.S., XXVI, 1930 p. 131 ff.. Ksemaraja tells us that the worship of the four Kaula masters, called \"Yuganathas,\" namely, Khagendranatha, Kurmanatha, Mesanatha and Matsyendranatha who taught in the four Ages (vugas) is a necessary part of all Kaula ritual. Although the Pascimamnaya, like every Kaula school, had its own masters, it advocated the worship of the Yuganathas (Schoterman p. 7). Here, however, Matsyendra­natha and the others are associated, as we shall see, with the Purvamnaya with which the Pascimamnaya had close affiliations. A number of works are attributed to Matsyendranatha although it seems highly unlikely that they are in fact his own. Almost all the MSs are in Nepal. Bagchi has edited a number of them and notes others in his KJN. Another work which he has not noticed is the Kulapancasika of which there is only one MS, deposited in the NA in Kathmandu (no. 1/1076). The last colophon of this short tract on Kaula yoga reads: iti kulapancasikayam srimatsandapavatare pancamah patalah samaptah | Clearly \"srimatsandapa\" is a corruption of a homonymn of Matsyendrapada. This work is quoted twice by Ksemaraja. (S.Su. vi. p. 54 and NTu I p. 191; fl. 4a and 3b in the MS). There is no indication in the text that it is by Matsyendra. Bagchi notes the existence of MSs of the Srikamakhyaguhyasiddhi (also called"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"164 NOTES just \"Guhyasiddhi\"). A list of eight shidhamatrka found in this work constituting the \"Kulastaka \"also occurs in a number of texts belonging to the Pascimamnaya. Indeed, Bagchi himself notes that he has come across it in the KNT, a Pascimam-nayapaddhaii. It is possible, therefore, that it is in fact a work of the Pascimam­naya, attributed to Matsyendranatha. That these and other works could wrongly be attributed to Matsyendranatha is not difficult to explain in view of the fact that many individuals were given this name as initiates. For example, according to the KNT this name was given to a Bengali brahmin initiated into the Pascimamnaya.

If the two words are conjoined and the compound inflected to form \"bhairavibhairavena saha\" the metre would be disturbed. For the same reason the forms \"bhairavena bhairavya saha, \" although grammatically correct, would not fit in this verse. Moreover, it appears that both words are here in the nominative to indicate that they carry equal weight. The gods can be either with Bhairava or Bhairavi as well as with both together). 28. anyatha kulakaule 'smin sambhave na sprsanti te | (Ibid., fl. 29b).

The Pascimamnaya, in common with other Kaula schools, views itself and other traditions not just as doctrine, scripture or school but also as an essential expression of metaphysical principles. \"Kula\" and \"Kaula\" are in this context interchangeable terms reflecting the close interaction between Kula and Kaula as divisions within the Kulagama as well as expressions of Kula itself as the power of Speech (vacchakti) incarnate in doctrine. Accordingly, the MBT explains that the lower, grosser metaphysical principles merge progressively into the higher, subtler ones in such a way that the entire series ultimately disappears into the Nameless (anamaka) absolute beyond all differentiation. The Nameless is Kula identified with Kulesvara who is the essence of Kaula, the ocean of consciousness in which the god and his consort, the goddess, fuse (MBT(Y), fl. 26b). Thus Kula - the goddess - has become the god while he is the essence of both the god and goddess where both dissolve and disappear. In other words, Kula is Kaula at the level of the mysterious Nameless, the supreme reality. At the same time, Kaula is the source of creation and its power is Kulasakti, the supreme goddess, the 'Neuter' (napumsaka in the feminine!) who is the mother of all doctrines: kaulam nama mahadeva yena srsti caracaram | tasy(ec)cha nirgata saktir ankurakarakaulini || darsananam ca mata sa para devi napumsaka | (MBT(Y), fl. 33b). The Supreme Goddess (Paradevi) is Kubjika, the goddess of the Pascimamnaya which represents itself in this way as higher than Kaula doctrine. It is an independent system in its own right which both integrates and goes beyond these categories. 32. kaulam tu sadvidham satva satkutapatitam dhruvam | satsamjna ca samudbhmam prasarat pascimanvayam ║ (CMSS, fl. 3a). (Read \"srutva\" for \"satva.\" \"Samjnatah\" instead of \"samjna ca\" would be grammatically correct. Note also that the word \"anvaya\"is masculine; here as often happens in these texts, it is treated as neuter). 33. purvapascimabhedena sailarajasuta nume | anandavalibhedena prabhu yogikena tu ║ atitapadasamjna ca satprakaram idam kulam | (Read -\"sute\"for -\"suta\" and \"avali\" for \"avail.\" \"Prabhu\" should be in the instrumental, i.e., \"prabhuna. \" This is probably a scribal error as the present form cuts short the metre by one syllable. \"Samjna ca\"should be \"Samjnaya\";"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"166 NOTES in that case, however the seventh syllable would be short instead of long as the metre demands). In TA, 29/36 the order is 1) Bodhi, 2) Prabhu, 3) Pada, 4) Ananda, 5) Yogin, 6) Avali. The order in the KMT, (fl. 3a) is the same as the KRU; the latter, however, arranges these six into three groups of two: 4)+ 6); 2)+ 5) and 1)+ 3), thus allowing the Pascimamnaya to be free, in a sense, to have its own line of teachers without losing its essential connection to the original Siddhasantana. The KRU then links one group to the Purvamnaya and the other to the Pascimamnaya and so aligns them through their common Kaula heritage and stresses their intimate connection with each other. However, in the KMT, which is older than the KRU, no such distinction is made. The six Kaula traditions are collectively called the Siddhakrama which has been transmitted along the Siddha path (siddhamargakramayatam) (KMT, fl. 3a). The CMSS assigns the Kaula traditions to the Purvamnaya which it integrates into the Pascimamnaya (see below). 34. The Kaula schools display a marked tendency to exclusivity (as indeed do all Hindu sects and cults in general). The Vrmikaulatantra, for example, expressly prohibits contact with those who follow other scriptures (TA, 15/573b-4). A Kaula does not distinguish himself from other Kaulas on the basis of caste but according to the Kaula group to which he belongs. The Kaula tradition prohibits commensuality outside its circle as a whole and enjoins measures for atoning defaults in this respect (TA, 15/ 272). Voicing the Kaula view, Abhinava says: \"In order to attain a state of identity (with Siva and one another) one must follow one's own spiritual tradition and neither worship nor enjoy the fruits of a Tantric gathering (cakra) along with those who belong to a different spiritual lineage.\" (ibid., 4/268b-9a). Even members of one or other of the six schools (ovalli) affiliated to Matsyendranatha could not worship together and went as far as to devise a system of signs by which they could recognise members of their own group in order to avoid others (TA, 29/37). Once within a group, however, no distinction between its members was admissible. Caste and social status ceased to be operational in this society; once in the fold the members become one with Siva and so indistinguishable from one another. He who viewed the others or talked of them in terms of former caste distinctions ran contrary to the Rule (.samaya) (ibid., 15/576). In this respect, the Kaula traditions were perfectly in agreement with many other Tantric cults (see for example, SvT 4/414 and 4/545). 35. In an important passage in the Taniraloka (4/221-270) Abhinava comments on part of chapter 18 of the MVT (18/74-81) which he presents as typifying the Trika view and which he contrasts with that of the Saivasiddhanta, on the one hand, and Kula on the other. Thus, whereas the former enjoins the performance of rituals and the observance of vows and rules governing outer conduct, the Kula position is seen to be one of denying their validity and rejection of these outer forms in favour of inner spiritual discipline. Kula doctrine is essentially based, from this part of view, on an exclusivist monism (advaya) intolerant of contrasts, which thus rejects all forms of spiritual discipline that are 'external', that is, 'outside' in the state of duality. The Trika view, however,"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"Notes to Part Two 167 excels this because it is a supreme monism (paramadvaya) in which nothing needs to be pursued or even abandoned. Even if ritual is performed, it does not break up the integrity of the absolute consciousness of the subject (TA, vol. Ill, p. 288 ff.). Nothing is here prohibited or enjoined insofar as whatever is pleasing is fit to lead to union with Siva: muktikamasya no kincin nisiddham vihitam ca no || yad eva hrdyam tad yogyam sivasamvidabhedane │ (TA, 15/291b-2a). One could say that Trika is in this respect more intensely Kaula than the Kula schools and so, in the same spirit, rejects the view that the divisions between Kaula traditions are important. According to the Trikasasana, there is an essential equality among all these traditions insofar as they are all ultimately Saiva (ibid., 4/274-5a). Indeed, according to Abhinava, these distinctions are denied in all the Trika scriptures starting with the SYM because they break up the unity of ultimate reality (ibid., 4/269). Trika Mantras are applicable in all circumstances (ibid., 11/38) but, even so, one should take care not to be misled by following the teachings of other schools (TA, vol. Ill, p. 279 ff; TA 25/563). 36. The god says to the goddess at the beginning of the Yoginihrdayatantra of the Srividya school: \"Listen, O goddess, to the great secret, the Supreme Heart of the Yogini; out of love for you I will tell you today that which is to be kept well concealed, that which has been taught from ear to ear and so reached the surface of the earth.\" (YHr. l/2b-3). Similarly in the Kaulajnananirnaya which was revealed, as tradition would have it, by Matsyendranatha: \"O goddess, it is heard as residing in the ear (not in books) and has come down through the line of teachers; this, O goddess, is Kaulika [doctrine] transmitted from ear to ear\" (KJN, 6/8b-9a). 37. After explaining in a veiled, cryptic manner how to construct a mantra, the KMT says: \"This method is hard to acquire, it can be obtained only from the mouth of a master\" (fl. 37a). 38.

These include \"cotton,\" \"a type of soft grain,\" \"a weight,\" \"a leper,\""},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"Notes to Part Two 169 \"the neem tree\" and \"thorn apple.\" It is also the name of the Bhairava who teaches in the BY and of one of his eight faces. 57. picuvaktradyaparaparyayam yoginlvaktram eva mukhyacakram uktam | patalakhyam adhovaktram srstyartham samprakirtitam | adhovaktram srstivaktram picuvaktram | quoted by Schoterman (pp. 86-7) from the SatSS, a Tantra belonging to the Kubjika school. He also points out in his commentary to verse 2/ 37 of this Tantra that this mouth is called Picuyoni. Picuvaktra is also equated with Patalavaktra in TA, 15/206 and commentary. The BY (fl. 201a) also confirms that those Tantras which deal with Kulacara are said to originate from the Lower Current along with others. In the context of describing the content of the Lower Current, the BY states that it is Bhairava who teaches here. The SKS's canon is unusual insofar as it equates the Mouth of the Yogini with the Right Current from which arise the sixty-four Bhairavatantras: \"The scripture called Bhairava consisting of eight times eight [Tantras] entered all together into the independent Saiva [tradition] that is, the [current of the] Right, that of the Emission of the Heart\" (TA, vol. I, p. 41). Jayaratha comments that \"the Bhairava group consisting of sixty-four [Tantras] is predominantly monist and belongs to the Right Face which corresponds to the [single] non-dual inner nature of the union of Siva and Sakti, also called the Mouth of the Yogini.\" In other words, the Bhairavatantras are here understood to be vitally linked with the Kaulatantras through their common source. The BY is a good example of how this works. Its very name - Picumata (the Doctrine of Picubhairava) - subtly implies its hidden connection with the Kaulatantras. Accordingly, Abhinava quotes it along with other Tantras belonging to the Bhairavasrotas in the course of his exposition of Kaula ritual in the Tantraloka. One chapter (56) of this work is devoted to Kulacara while another (69) deals with the Picubheda. The overall Kaula character of this work is unmistakable, although it does not consider itself to be such. Certain passages, however, refer directly to the attainment of Kaulasiddhi and union with Kula (see quote in TA, vol. Ill, p. 64). The Kaula character of other Tantras belonging to the Daksinasrotas is also evident, particularly of those Tantras which teach Trika doctrine. Thus, according to the MVT, the SYM teaches the method by which Kulacakra is to be worshipped (MVT, 19/48). Abhinava quotes Trisiro-bhairava, a Trikatantra belonging to the Daksinasrotas, when defining the meaning of \"Kaula\"as a metaphysical principle (TA, vol. Xlb.p. 6). He also refers to it several times while describing Kaula ritual in the Tantraloka, including one passage which deals with the characteristics of the ideal Tantric consort (TA, vol. Xlb, pp. 69-70). That not all Tantras of the Bhairava group are so markedly Kaula-oriented becomes apparent when we consider the character of the Svacchantlabhairavatanrra whose ritual programme is in many respects similar to that of the Siddhantagama in which Kaula rituals and practice are largely absent. It seems that the Vidyapithatanras of the Saivagama were, in this sense, extensively Kaula in character, and it is to this pitha that the Trikatantras generally belong. Moreover, it is to this pitha that most of the Tantras of the Pascimamnaya"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"170 NOTES affiliate themselves and so do many other Kaulatantras. Thus the god says in the Yoginihrdaya: \"The Secret Doctrine 1 have hidden which bestows immediate understanding . . . resides in [those Tantras] associated with the Vidyapilha. It bestows divine yogic accomplishments and [is attained] by those dedicated to Kulacara\" (see YHr., 2/76-80). 58.

P., 2/13). 75. For this generic usage of the term \"Kulamnaya,\" see, e.g., TA, 15/533; also ibid., 15/572. 76. The earliest Trikatantras, such as the Trisirobhairava and even the Sidilhayogesvarimata, do not know themselves to be Trika although they expound Trika doctrine and ritual. The same is true of the Malimvijayottara to which Abhinava refers as the essence of the SYM which is to all intents and purposes, the root Tantra of the Trika and indeed, probably, the first Tantra to expound the essentials of Trika, namely the worship of the three goddesses -Para, Parapara and Apara - and their Mantras. 77. The Pascimamnayatantras to which 1 have had access so far, which are but a fraction of those extant in Nepalese MSs, all refer to the KMT and so undoubtedly postdate it. Thus the CMSS refers to itself as the essence of the KMT which had been previously expounded extensively:"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"172 NOTES kathitam devadevesi samksepan na tu vistaram | srikubjikamatasaro'yarp vistaram kathitam maya || (CMSS, fl. 24a). (The word \"vistara\"is masculine so \"vistaram \"should be \"vistarah. \" Accordingly, \"kathitam \" which agrees with it should be \"kathitah.\" The third quarter of the verse contains an extra syllable. This is probably due to the addition of the word \"Sri\"made as a sign of respect for the KMT. \"Vistaram kathitam maya\" in the second line should read \"vistarah kathitah maya.\") The Yogakhanda of the MBT refers specifically to the KMT of 3500 verses which corresponds to the length of the recovered text of this Tantra. The Goraksasamhita, which postdates the MBT, to which it refers in one place (p. 278), also knows the KMT, to which it refers in several places as Srimata (p. 4, 24, 49, 116, 158, 208, 277, 375) and once as Kulalitantra (p. 152). It is closely affiliated to the Srimatottara (perhaps they may be the same work) which, as its name implies, follows after the KMT. The Kularatnoddyota is also a later work as it affiliates itself to the Kubjikamata. The colophons are generally of the type: ityadinathaviditam pancasatkotivistirnasrimatkubjikamate sri-kularatnoddyote Also the Kubjika paddhati by Muktaka, the KNT, certainly postdates the KMT as does the Kularatnapancaka. Although all these texts are later than the KMT, there is still room to doubt the originality of this Tantra. Thus in one place in the KMT it seems that there is a reference to an earlier Tantra. On fl. 49a the goddess says: \"now explain clearly what you have alluded to in the previous Tantra but not clearly elucidated\": XXXXXXXX idanim kathaya sphutam | purvatantre tvaya deva sucitam na prakasitam || This reference may, however, be construed to mean that the matters which are to be discussed are found in older Tantras which do not necessarily belong to the Pascimamnaya. We have still to study the extant literature to see whether there is any more evidence to decide this issue one way or the other. It seems highly probable, however, that the KMT is not only the root Tantra of the Pascimamnaya but also the first. 78. KMT, fl. 44b. This reference is part of a passage reproduced in the GS, 14/ 195-206a. Other Tantras referred to in this passage are the Sammohana and Svarodaya which is a Tantric astrological work. The Svacchandabhairava is referred to here as \"the best of Tantras.\" Svacchanda Mantras are in fact integrated into the Pascimamnaya (see, for example, the exposition of Svacchandastra in GS, p. 155 ff.). C. Chakravarti notices two after works referred to in the KMT, namely, the Labdhvitantra (emend to \"Laghvitantra\") and Aghoridamaratantra (RASB Tantras, cat. II, p. 874). 79. PTv, p. 184.

The association of the Kalikrarna with the Uttaramnaya is well established in other Tantras (see below). 92. The YHr, pp. 100-102.

The Tantras referred to are the Tantrasdra, Kriyasara, Kaulasara, Trikasara and Yogasara. The CMSS also refers to the Yuginihrdaya, Kala-cakrodaya and Yamala. Other scriptures and groups are the Bhairavasta and the Astastabheda, the Pahcasrotabheda, the Garuda- and Bhutatantras. It then refers to a number of other groups (bheda) namely Mantra, Tantra, Cakra, Hrdantara, Sara, Kala and Nitya- bheda as well as the Svacchanda which it considers to be the highest (fl. I b). Other works referred to in the body of the text are the Siddhayogesvarimata (fl. 14a), Rudrayamala (fl. 18a) and K.MT (fl. 24a). 96. The CMSS says that grha is the Inner Dwelling. It is the Wheel of Passion (raticakra) which is in the womb of the goddess, sanctified (bhavita) by Kula and Kaula. Yogis reside there in that consciousness, mentally discerning that which is free of being and non-being and playing in the Kulamnaya, the imperishable abode of consciousness (fl. 14b). The Pascimagrha is: gadha(m) gambhiragahanam tad anandagrhasmrtah | (Ibid., fl. 4b). (The word \"gadha\" normally means \"shallow.\" The word \"agadha\". which is formed from it by adding the negative prefix \"a-\", means \"deep.\" Although \"agadha\" is derived from \"gadha,\" it is more common in use, particularly in figurative expressions such as this one. The meaning of \"gadha \"has here, it seems, been mistaken for that of \"agadha.\" \"Anandagrhasmrtah\" is not a valid compound.

Although the Pascimamnaya is, like the other amnayas, Sakta in the sense that it is the goddess who is the primary focus of worship, Siva is exalted as the highest principle: sivat parataran nasti ityajna paramesvari | (CMSS, fl. 25a). From this point of view the Pascimamnaya is also known as the Sambhava-sara, i.e., the essence of Saiva doctrine. It is Siva who is the ultimate source of the Pascimamnaya and is himself its arising and present in it: tatrastham sambhavam natharn pascimat pascimodayam | (MBT(Y), fl. 38a). Indeed all four amnayas are represented as belonging to 'Siva's circle' which is identified with Kula doctrine itself: athatah sampravaksvami yani siddhodayam kule | pascime daksine vame purve va sambhumandale || (Ibid., fl. 40b). (Emend \"siddhodayam\" to \"siddhodaye\".) The shift of emphasis from the male to the female principle and vice versa is reflected in the exchange of roles between them as the imparters of Pascima doctrine. Thus, most of the Pascimatantras, (for example, the KMT, KRU and CMSS) are taught by the god to the goddess who inquires about the doctrine. However, in some cases, such as the Yogakhanda of the MBT, the reverse is true - it is the goddess who instructs. The Pascimatantras themselves take note of this and explain that the teaching is transmitted in this two-fold manner. In the KRU the god (Adinatha) says: \"I. O goddess, have explained [the doctrine] which was established in the beginning. In this case I, O goddess, am your teacher [that is], O Supreme Goddess, [in the imparting of the original] terms of reference (samjna).\" \"In the second one of my pervasive eras you will be my [teacher].

In the KMT, which presents the doctrine at its origins, it is indeed Bhairava who speaks, even so, as the embodiment of the Word held within consciousness (sabdarasi). He is forced to acknowledge his dependence on the goddess who, as MalinI, is the power of his speech by virtue of which the Word can become manifest. Again, it is by virtue of the goddess travelling and manifesting herself in the sacred places throughout India that the doctrine is spread. She, and not he, is the chief protagonist as, indeed, is generally the case with the non-dualist Tantras whether they consider themselves to be specifically Kaula or not. 101. sambhavam yatra llnam tu vyapakam sarvatomukham | akula ca kulam jnanam vividham pascimam grham ║ (MBT(Y), fl. 35b).

The Pascimamnava also refers to itself as divided into lines (oli) originating from masters said to reside in these pi/has. In the KNT they are the three listed below along with their Lords: Pitha Masters  Lords  Odiyara: Oddisanatha - Nandesvara Purnagiri: Srisasthinatha - Karttikeya Kamarupa: Sricaryanandanatha - Ganesvara (See Schoterman, p. 36). In the Divyakrama of the Srividya the four pithas are arranged in a triangle, the corners and centre of which correspond to a seed-syllable (bija) and teacher who appeared in one of the four Ages. See Figure 5 below. Figure 5. The Triangle of the Divyakrama. Although the names of the teachers in the various locations do not correspond, the fact that they are the same in these two schools is striking. According to the Srividya tradition, these four teachers belong to the Divyaugha through which the earliest transmission of the teachings took place. The Tripura and Kubjika cults share these teachers in common, thus linking them vitally together. However, neither of the two traditions show overt signs of being conscious of this connection between them. As the KMT makes no reference to these teachers, it seems likely that this is a later development in the Pascimamnaya. Rather than say that the Kubjika tradition has simply borrowed this from that of Srividya. it may perhaps be more accurate to say that it happens to find common roots with it in an 'original' transmission of Kaula doctrine conceived to be the same for every Kaula tradition. Again, that the CMSS defines itself as a Tantra belonging to the Divyaugha is a sign that major Kaula schools attempt to appropriate this 'original tradition' in order to appear to be the first, and hence, most genuine recipients of the Kaula teachings."},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"Notes to Part Two 179 111. Mahesvarananda in his Maharthamanjari takes over the same division into four lines of doctrine found in the NSA and calls them srotas. His purpose is to identify Mahartha, the Krama absolute worshipped as Kali, with Tripura. He does this by comparing the four srotas to oceans churned by Manthana-bhairava who although associated, from his point of view, particularly with the Kalikrama is considered to be the Bhairava of all the Kaulatantra (MM, v. 68 pp. 170-2). Thus Mahesvarananda appears to be integrating the four-fold pi/ha division of the Srividya with the four amnayas of the Kulatantras. In the process, he makes Manthanabhairava the Lord of them all, thus demonstrating that the highest tradition and the essence of all the scriptures (MM, p. 171) is the Mahartha or Krama which, as he himself says, is the Kaula Uttaramnaya (ibid., p. 6, 143, 186). Mahesvarananda thus knew and supported the division into four amnayas which must therefore have persisted in this form up to his time (mid-thirteenth cent.) along with the original Kaula Tantras which adhered to this classification. 112. iyam ca vidya caturamnayasadharanyapi daksinapaksapatiniti (NSA, p. 41). 113. Schoterrnan p. 36. In the Paratantra, where the amnayas are six, the goddesses presiding over the amnayas are fearful in form except Kubjika and Tripurasundari who are both seated on Sadasiva's lap and described as young and beautiful. 114. The term \"Kramadarsana\" is not common in the original Tantras. They generally refer to their doctrinal and ritual system as \"Kramanaya,\" \"Atinaya,\" \"Mahartha,\" \"Maharthakrama,\" \"Mahakrama,\" \"Kalikula,\" \"Kalikulakrama,\" \"Kalikrama,\" \"Kalinaya\" or \"Devinaya\" (see Rastogi, pp. 16-30). 115. CMSS, fl. 23b. 116. Jayaratha refers to a number of authorities in his commentary on TA, 4/148-170 where Abhinavagupta expounds the order of the twelve Kalis constituting Samviccakra. Amongst them are the Devipancasatika, Srisardha-satika, and the Kramasadbhava which have been edited from Nepalese MSs by Mr. G. S. Sanderson but, as yet, unfortunately not published. The Krama­sadbhava enjoins the worship of seventeen Kalis in Anakhyacakra whereas the other sources usually speak of thirteen (apart from the Kramastotra where they are twelve). In the Srisardhasatika (quoted in TA, vol. III, p. 161) the thirteen Kalis are listed in the following order: I) Srstiº 2) Sthitiº 3) Samharaº 4) Rakta° 5) Svakali 6) Yamakali 7) Mrtyu° 8) Rudraº 9) Paramarkaº 10) Martanda II) (Kalagni) Rudra 12) Mahakali and 13) Mahabhairavacandograghorakali who is in the centre. The Tantraraja-bhattaraka (quoted in TA, vol. III, p. 189) also lists thirteen Kalis. The eighth Kali is called Bhadrakali, as it is in the CMSS, while the name of the thirteenth Kali, Mahabhairavakali, is a variant of Mahabhairavacandograghorakali which is the commonly accepted form of her name. The order of the Kalis in the Devipancasatika as quoted by Jayaratha is listed below: 1) Srsti° 2) Rakta° 3) Sthiti0 4) Yama0 5) Samhara0 6) Mrtyu0 7) Rudra0"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"180 NOTES 8) Martandaº 9) Paramarka° 10) Kalagnirudraº 11) Mahakali° 12) Maha-bnairavacandograghorakali and 13) Sukali. The order of the Kalis Abhinava presents follows the Kramastotra a work on which he wrote a commentary called the Kramakeli. This is as follows (TA4 / 148-170) 1) Srstiº 2) Raktaº 3) Sthitinasaº 4) Yama° 5) Samhara° 6) Mrtyu° 7) Bhadraº 8) Martandaº 9) Parmarkaº 10) Kalagnirudra0 11) Mahakalakali 12) Maha-bhairavacandograghorakali. Abhinava rejects the sequence of thirteen Kalis and leaves empty the space in he centre of the rotating circle of Kalis, where the thirteenth Kali is usually located. Thus he agrees with the Kramastotra as opposed to the generally accepted pattern by the Tantras which take Mahabhairavacandograghorakali to be the thirteenth (see TA, vol.III. p.189)..He does this, again following the lead of the Kramastotra. by eliminating Sukali who is usually the fifth in this sequence. This, Jayaratha tells us, the Pancasatika does not do (ibid ) Moreover it seems that Mahabhairava Kali was the thirteenth according to this text as well. It is therefore probable that Jayaratha has altered the original order of the Kalis it enumerates to fit with that of the Kramastotra. Another Tantra Jayaratha quotes arrives at the number twelve by eliminating Sukali. It appears, therefore that Paramadevi who is located in the centre of the twelve Kalis according to the CMSS is Mahabhairavacandograghorakali. Thus there can be doubt that the Kalis to which the CMSS refers are those of the Kalikrama as presented in the majority of the Agamas of the Krama school prevalent in Abhinava's time. 117. santi paddhatayas citrah srotobhedesu bhuyasa | anuttarasadardharthakrame tvekapi neksyate ║ (TA, 1/14). Gnolis translation of this verse into Italian reads in English: \"Many are the manuals in use in the different currents. For the school of that of which there is none higher, for the Trika and for the Krama, there is however not a single one\" In a footnote he writes that the \"school of that of which there is none higher\" (anuttara) ,is probably an allusion to the Kula school. He adds, however that the first part of the compound (viz. \"anuttarasadardhartha-\") could also be translated to mean \"for the method concerning Trika, that is, the school of that of which there is none higher.\" It seems to us that this translation is more satisfactory. The original translation imlies that Kula is a separate system which differs substantially from Krama and Trika and has an independent identity similar to them. It seems, however, that \"Kula\" is, in Abhinavagupta's works, a much broader term of reference than \"Trika\" or \"Krama,\" as it is in the original Agamic sources. In one sense, the term \"Kula\" refers to a type of doctrine and liturgical pattern. This use of the term is well exemplified by the contrast posited in the TA between the Kula method or liturgy (kulaprakriva) and the Tantric Method (tantraprakriya). The former denotes Trika and Krama Kaula ritual ,in general; the latter all Tantric ritual that is free of Kaula elements notably, the use of meat, wine and ritual intercourse. Again, \"Kula\" denotes a type of Tantric tradition; there are, as we have seen, a number of Kula schools"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"Notes to Part Two 181 Therefore, the expression \"Anuttarasadardharthakrama\" is best not taken to be a copulative compound but read to mean \"the liturgy (krama) of the Anuttaratrikakula school (artha).\" Jayaratha also takes the word \"Krama\" here to mean \"liturgy\" (prakriya) and not the Krama school (anuttaratrikartha-prakriyalaksanam TA, vol. 1, p. 33). The Anuttaratrika Kula is the highest form of Trika. It is also known as the \"Anuttaramrtakula\" which Abhinava invokes in the first verse of his Tantraloka and which Jayaratha says is the supreme principle that contains, and yet is beyond, the Triad (Trika) of Para, Parapara and Apara (see commentary on TA, 1/1). 118. kaularnavanandaghanormirupam unmesamesobhayabhajam antah | niliyate nilakulalaye ya tarn srstikalim satatam namami || (quoted in TA, vol.

We notice here how, as with other Kaula schools, Siva figures as the supreme transcendental principle. He is the ultimate end of all the sequences . of states of consciousness, ritual acts and their macrocosmic counterparts, namely, the stages of manifestation and withdrawal. As in the Pascimamnaya, Siva is called Sambhu in the Kramasadbhava where he is identified with Bhasa - the principle of pure illumination, equivalent to the \"expanse of the glory of the light of consciousness\" (prakasavibhavasphitham) referred to in the Kramastotra as Kali's supreme abode (TA, vol. Ill, p. 185). In the Krama­sadbhava, Anakhya is Sakti who follows after creation, persistence and destruction. jnanam srstim vijaniyat sthitir mantrah prakirtitah | samhararn tu mahakalamelapam paramam viduh || anakhyam sakcirupam tu bhasakhyarrt sambhurupakam | (quoted in MM, p. 94). 122.

Jnananetra received the original transmission from the goddess Mangala (also called Makaradevi) in the Uttarapitha, also called \"Ohkarapitha\" identified with Oddiyana in which the cremation ground called Karavira was located (MP, pp. 49-50, 107; also MM, p. 92). (For Sivananda and his works see Rastogi. Page numbers are listed extensively in the index on p. 287. Also Pandey, index p. 1004). Although Jnananetra is referred to as the master who brought Krama doctrine to earth {avatarakanatha, TA, vol. Ill, p. 195) he was not the original propagator of Krama doctrine but the founder of a branch of the Krama tradition which associated itself with the Uttarapitha. 135.

Goudriaan (Hindu Tantric and Sakta Literature, p. 50) points out that \"the exact position of the Krama system within the Kashmiri tradition and its relationship to.

The Krama Tantrivism of Kashmir, Motilal Banarsidass, Delhi. 1979. He says however that \"Rastogi seems to lay too much emphrsis of the Krama school as a separate entity. We are inclined to think of a method of initiation or self-realization which could be followed by adherents of the Kula view point. The history of Agamic Krama, its structure and relationship to Other Tantric traditions, is another of the many subjects we can hope to understand only by carefuly studying what remains of the original Agamic sources. 140. In the opening benedictory verses of his commentary he says: \"May that imperishable Auttara non-dual principle which is rooted in A [i.e., the absolute] unfolding, be victorious!\" (MM, p. 1). 141. Ibid., p. 189. 142. In the concluding section of his book (p. 180 ff), Mahesvarananda tells us of the tradition, also recorded in Abhinava's commentary on the Kramastotra that the Mahartha i.e. Krama, doctrine was taught by Krsna to Arjuna in the Bhagavacigita. Mahesva ananda goes on to say that this doctrine is that of the Auttara Krama. For other references see ibid., p. 6 and 176. 143. Ibid., p. 170. 176. 144.

The implication, therefore, seems to be that Mahesvarananda (like Abhinava) sees Trika and Krama as intimately connected in a single doctrinal tradition. Accordingly, he says that he sees little difference between them (MM, p. 92). 145. The Paralantra says that the Lhtaramnaya originated from the Kalikula (4 10). Perhaps the Uttaramnaya is a part of the Kalikula, (or a development of it) which, as an independent tradition, precedes it. Apparently we are dealing here with a later development in the Kalikrama schools. It seems that Krama, like Trika. acquired an identity as a system only gradually. 146. ityultaramnaya sriomkarapithavinirgate sricandabhairave sodasasahasre udite yonigahvaram samaptam (RASBTantra, cat., 1, p. 109). 147. mahasasanasampradayam | kaulottarasarabhutam | (Ibid., p. 108). 148.

Dr. Goudriaan has delivered a lecture on the Samayamantra of Kubjika described in KMT, chapter 18, in which he has incidentally also demonstrated that the Para, etc., Mantras of the Kubjika school are those of the Trika as expounded in chapter 30 of the Tantraloka. Conference on Yantra and Mantra at the CNRS, Paris, 22/6/84. 180. These Mantras are dealt with extensively in the KRU in various places. For Navatmamantra see KRU, 5/76-78. Bhairavasadbhava and Ratisekhara fl. 53-54. The three Mantras of Para, etc., are described ibid., 5/119 ff. Not only are these Mantras essentially the same, but the energies associated with them are also similar. There is no need to expect that all the details should coincide as Abhinava himself tells us that there are a number of variants in the form of these Mantras and associated principles even in the one Tantra (here he is referring to the Trisirobhairava TA, 30/27b-28a). However, we find that the eight energies (kala) of the Parapara Mantra are virtually the same as those we find in the Trisirobhairava. In the KRU (5/ 121-2a) they are Aghora, Parama-ghora, Ghorarupa, Anana, Bhima, Bhisana, Vamani and Pivani. In the passage quoted from the Trisirobhairava in TA, vol. V, p. 11 and TA, vol. XII, p. 341 the names and order are the same, except that Anana of the KRU is called Ghoravaktra. In the MVT, l/19b-20 these same eight energies are said to create, sustain, destroy and offer grace. They are associated with the Mantresvaras and Mahamantresvaras from which the seven kotis of Mantras which constitute the cosmic order are created. 181. So, for example, it is said in the CMSS, (fl. 4b): \"He who knows the three Kulas, that which is beyond the three Kulas, the three states and that which is other than the three states, the three wombs and that which has no womb is the follower of the tradition\". In the MBT(Y), fl. 72a-b Pascima is described as the \"divine tradition, which removes all impurities and is established in the three principles.\" Groups of three are then listed. 182. These three recur persistently in the Pascimaiantras as three Kramas through which the goddess is worshipped. According to the MBT, in her child (bald) form, Kubjika is called \"Umabhagavati\" and is described as having six faces, five of which are named here: Upper (Malini), East (Siddhayogesvari), South (Mahalaksmi), North (Mahakali) and West (Kubjika). (MBT(Y) fl. 93a ff.) Malini, which is important in the Trika, is here given pride of place as the upper face, while Siddhayogesvari is located in the east which reminds us of Trika's association with the Purvamnaya, the Eastern Tradition. 183. satakotipravistirnam vyakhyatam khanjinimatam | evam sa sambhavlsaktir ananta anantatam gata || tasya(h) samprerana yatam sambhavasakt(akta)m anavam | icchajnanakriyasya(s) ca samsthita bhuvanatrayam || (MBT(Y), fl. 70a)."},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"Notes to Part Two 187 (The last half of the third line reads: \"sambhavasaktam anavam.\" The copyist has written \"-akta-\"twice by mistake.

An account of these three initiations is found in the KRU, fl. 68b. ff. 186. For an extensive account of Sabdarasi and Malini see A. Padoux's standard work: Recherches sur La symboliques el L 'Energie de la Parole dans certains Textes Tantriques, Paris 1963. For an account of how these operate as codes in the Tantras of the Kubjika school, see Schoterman, pp. 182-221. 187. sabdarasisca malinya vidyanam tritayasya ca | sahgopangasamayukta trikatantram karisyati || (KRU, fl. 78b). (For \"sabdardsis\" read \"sabdardses.\" For \"-samayukta\" read \"-samayukram\"). 188. For example, the CMSS acknowledges that it has derived the pithasamketa from the Siddhayogesvarimata: sarnketa esa vikhyatas siddhayogesvarimate | (fl. 14a). According to this account, there are four pithas, namely, Onkara, Jalandhara, Purna (giri) and Kamaru. The first is located in the mouth, which represents the circle of the Sky of Consciousness as the state of withdrawal and suspension of all extroverted conscious activity. Jalandhara and Purna are in the right and left ears respectively while Kamaru resides at the end of the flow of the vital breath (pranante). 189. The original Trikaiantras, such as the SYM and Trisirobhairava, as we have already had occasion to remark, were Bhairavatantras. Moreover, none of the Trikaiantras 1 have had access to, namely, the published Malini-i'ijayotlara, a part of the SYM and Srilantrasadbhava (NA, MS no. 1/363) ever refer to Trika as a school. The last two simply affiliate themselves to the Vidyapitha of the Bhairavasrotas. Another unexpected feature of these Tantras is that they are not Kaulatantras although their doctrines, metaphysical presuppositions and rituals are of a Kaula type. Where Kula is referred to as a ritual pattern, doctrine or tradition, it figures as an element in the broader context of the Tantra as a whole. However, the later Trikaiantras, which did think of themselves as belonging to a Trika tradition, such as the Nisisancara, Kularatnamala. Bhairavakula and Trikasara, define Trika in Kaula terms as the highest Kaula school which as such is, in a sense, beyond the Kula tradition. These facts along with the absorption of Krama doctrine in some form are fundamental features of the history of the development of Agamic Trika before Abhinavagupta. 190. The Pascimatantras, it seems, are so conscious of having absorbed many Trika elements that at times it becomes necessary for a Tantra in the course of its exposition of a topic to distinguish what it is going to say about it from what the Trika and others have said. Thus, for example, the MBT proclaims that it will explain the characteristics of the sacrificial hearth according to the Pascima Kula Kaula tradition (see above p. 62) as explained in the Maharnava-"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"188 NOTES tantra(?) and the common ritual which concerns it, free of Trika and Daksina elements: kundanam laksanam vaksye kule kaule tu pascime | maharnave laksapade uktam te sarvakarana || olinathas tu samanyam trikadaksinavarjitam | (MBT(Y), fl. 8a). (Read \"-karanam\" for \"-karana\") Similarly the goddess proclaims the purity of the Pascima doctrine taught in the KMT by saying that it is free of the Eastern portion: idam ca pascimam deva purvabhagavivarjitam | (KMT, fl. 6b). It is quite common in these Tantras, as it is in others, for the speaker to let us know that what he has said or is about to say is new in some respect. The god may say to the goddess: \"Now I will tell you of a matter I have never revealed before,\" or \"Hear now the tradition which up to now has been transmitted only by word of mouth,\" or \"Now I will clarify that which has been kept hidden in previous Tantras\" or \"Know that this form of the deity has never been spoken of before,\" etc. Again, at times, we are told that a topic has been dealt with only cursorily, in which case the god may say something like \"Now 1 will explain at length that which was told to you before concisely.\" Such remarks are clear indications that the tradition is conscious of drawing from external sources (whether these be Tantras which have been set to writing or oral tradition) as well as contributing something new of its own. 191. Judging from the colophons recorded in the BSP, many chapters of the JY are dedicated to accounts of the worship of Kali in diverse forms. The names of the Kalis mentioned in the colophons are, in the second satka: Kalasankarsani, Yamakali, Gahanesvari, Raktakali, Indivarikalika, Dhanadakali, Isanakali, Viryakali, Raktakali and Saptarnakali. In the fourth satka: Mohakali, Amaresvari, Parantakali, Meghakali, Priyakali, Stambhakali, Kalaratri, Melapakali, Nityakali, Santikali, Netrakali, Jagatksobhakali, Ghattanakali and Hrdayakali. It is interesting to note in passing that one chapter of this satka is concerned with the worship of Siddhayogesvari. Seven chapters in this same section are specifically labelled as dealing with Kalikulakrama rites (see BSP, Tantra I, p. 119 ff). 192. See Goudriaan and Gupta, 1981, p. 52; also Schoterman pp. 5-6. 193. Apart from the sacred geography peculiar to these Tantras, we find combined with it the general pattern of sacred places referred to in the Kaulatantras and cognate texts as a whole. Representative lists of the latter are found in references in the Tantraloka. Nepal hardly ever figures in these lists (an exception to this general rule is YHr, 3/37). The reason for this is probably that Kaula-oriented Tantra was introduced into Nepal only after the original redaction of these works. The oldest MSs of these Tantras do not pre-date the eleventh century. Before then the type of Saivism popular in the Kathmandu valley seems to have"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"Notes to Part Two 189 been of the Siddhanta and Puranic type which prescribed linga worship and consisted of cults such as that of Umamahesvara described in works like the Sivadharma, Sivadharmottara and Sivopanisad. An early tenth century MS of these texts (NA, no. 4/ 53)) is preserved in Nepal. Similarly early Nepalese MSs of the Kiranagama and other Siddhantagamas also exist. Although the earliest Saiva cults in Nepal were not Kaula-oriented, a reference to Nepal as one of eight upapithas occurs in the MBT(Y), fl. 15b. Another reference has been traced in a MS of the Nisisancaratantra (NA, MS no. 1/1606) which is written in early Newari characters probably not younger than the twelfth century. Here Pasupati is mentioned as residing in Nepal along with his consort Guhyesvari. These references suggest that Nepal did not become a centre of Kaula Tantricism much before the eleventh century. 194. See Schoterman, p. 6, 37. 195. Schoterman, p. 6. 196. Practically the only reference to Kubjika apart from in her Tantras is a brief description of her worship in the Agnipurana. See Schoterman's article A link between Purana and Tanlra: Agnipurana 143-147 in ZDMG suppl. IV Wiesbaden 1980. See also Les Enseignemems konographiques de L'Agnipurana by Mth. de Mailman Paris 1963 pp. 159-60, 206-207. 197. See Schoterman, p. 10, fn. 4. 198. Dr. Kisoranatha Jha in his Hindi introduction to the first part of the Guhyakalikhanda of the Mahakalasamhila (p. 18, fn. 1) informs us that the late Parmesvara Simha, who was a Maithili Tantric, had a statue of Guhyakali in her ten-faced form made and installed in a temple in the village of Madhubani in the Bhauragadhi district of Behar. This is the only example he knows of a representation of this form of the goddess in India. There is, however, an old image of Guhyakali carved in black marble preserved in the Rajputana Museum in Ajmer (No. 193, 268). See article by P. K. Majumdar, Sakti worship in Rajasihan published in the Sakti Cult and Tara, Calcutta 1957, p. 68. 199. Schoterman, p. 6. 200. Kuiper, F. B. J. Proto-Munda Words in Sanskrit, Amsterdam 1948, p. 42. ff.; referred to by Schoterman, p. 11. 201. Kubjika is also called \"Kukaradevi\" which is not only an abbreviated form of her name but also the seed-syllable corresponding to the Earth Principle. The word \"ku\" means \"earth\" and so\"Kuja\" which is one of Kubjika's common names means \"born of the earth\" and \"Kujesvari\" - \"the goddess born of the earth.\" 202. tatha sa kutila vakra madhyamolyam kulesvara | kubjika satprakara ca vrddharupena devata || (MBT(Y), fl. 95a). 203. The KMT, fl. 69b says: \"She in whose centre the universe resides and who resides in the centre of the universe is thus called Khanjika; she who is subtle and present in subtle things.\" These names give rise in their turn to various names for the Kubjika school such as \"Khanjinimaia,\" \"Khanjinikula,\" \"Vakrikagama,\" \"Vakrikamala\"as well as \"Cincinlsastra\"or \"Cincinimata\"and \"Kulaiikamnaya\"(for Kubjika as Cincini see below, andasKulalika the potteress,"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"190 NOTES see Schoterman, pp. 7-9). 204.

In this Wheel are located the three goddesses Para, etc. and worshipped there as aspects of Malini. The dhyanas of these three are found in verses 8/159-163 (Para), 8/113 (Parapara) and 8/171-8 (Apara). 214. CMSS, fl. la. 215. A hymn dedicated to Kubjika as Bhaga is found in the CMSS, fl. 10. 216.

(The metre is defective by one syllable in the second half unless we take \"mleccha\" to be \"maleccha\"). 9. cathurthe tu yuge svante dharmocchede samagate | mleccharajyekachatre ca bhunjate prthivimahan || ravanasyavatare tu simdhos tire XXXX || (MBT(Y), fl. 91b). There appears to be another possible reference to an invasion in the SatSS. Here it is described as one of the many horrors of the Kali Age. It says: ksatriya ahave bhagnah karisyanti prabhutvatam | (3/79b). 10. MBT(Y), fl. 70a. 11. Colophon of the Kumahkakhanda of the MBT NA, no. 1/241; BSP, vol. II, p. 59. APPENDIX C 1.

See also Bagchi pp. 110-1) where this passage is quoted. The JY also accepts the standard division of the sastras found in the Agamas into five groups, viz., Laukika, Vaidika, Adhyatmika, Atimarga and Anava which stands for Mantratantra (see above p. 49). This division of the sastras into five corresponds to five fruits they are supposed to yield (JY, fl. 166a). 5. The Vaimala along with the Lakula, Mausula and Karuka is one of a standard group of four Pasupata sects mentioned in the Agamas and elsewhere. See SvT, 11/69-74 and Ksemaraja's commentary. Also Jayaratha on TA, 1/33. There are eight Pramanas according to SvT, 10 1134-35. They correspond to eight Rudras that have incarnated as Pasupata teachers who founded the following eight Pasupata schools: Pancartha, Guhya, Rudrarikusa, Hrdaya, Laksana, Vyuha, Akarsa and Adarsa. (Ibid., 10/ 1134-5; cf. also TA, 8/ 328-9). 6. The text (fl. 166a) simply reads Guhyadi which I have taken to be a reference to the Guhyasamajatantra. It is interesting that the JY classifies the Vajrayana sastras as belonging to this group, thus distinguishing them from other Buddhist scriptures which are assigned to the previous one. We should not, however, understand this to mean that the Buddhist Tantras are aligned with the Bhairava and other similar Saivatantras on an equal footing. 7. This account largely agrees with the way the genesis of scripture is generally described in the Agamas. According to the Kulamulavatara, out of Siva, who is the supreme cause, tranquil and transcendent, emerges the power of will, followed by those of knowledge and action. Through them, the worlds are created, as is speech in all its expressions (MM, p. 39). Similarly, according to the Svacchanclabhairavti (quoted in YHr, p. 153) a pure and subtle resonance (dhvani) emerges out of Siva, the cause of all things. This is Speech which is the power beyond mind (unmanasakti) that goes on to assume the form of scripture and the spoken word. 8. The Agamas regularly refer to the types of relationship that form between the teacher and his disciple through which the meaning of the scripture and the realization it conveys are transmitted. The basic pattern is the same although , it may vary in individual cases. Abhinava records that according to the Kula-ratnamala, there are five relationships: great (mahat), intermediate (avantara), divine (divya), divine-cum-nondivine (divyadivya) and mutual (itaretara) (TA, 1/273-4). Bhagavatotpala also refers to five; these are supreme (para), great (mahat), divine (divya), other than divine (divyetara) and mutual (itaretara). (Sp.Pra., p. 84). Through these relationships formed between the teacher and disciple and taught at different levels, scripture and its meaning are transmitted from and through the divine consciousness which is its source and basis: \"The Lord, Sadasiva, establishing himself on the plane of master and disciple, brought the Tantra into the world through a series of questions and answers.\" (SvT quoted in VB, p. 7). There is, as Abhinava explains, an essential identity between the disciple who inquires and the teacher who instructs, as both are embodiments of the one consciousness. The disciple represents the aspect of consciousness which"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"196 NOTES questions (prastrsamvit) and the teacher the aspect which responds (TA, l/ 252-5). Thus as Abhinava says \"relationship (sambandha) is the identity (that is established) between the two subjects who question and reply. Its supreme aspect consists of the revelation of identity in all its fullness. The other relationships mentioned in the scriptures must also be considered in the light of this principle in order that the results one desires etc. may manifest in all their fullness\" (TA, 1/275-6). 9. Similarly the Svacchandasamgraha says \"this is the Lord Anasrita who has five faces each of which bears three eyes and who has one, two, four or ten arms. He is Sadasiva, the God of the gods who utters the worldly and other scripture. [It is He who] has spoken the countless Agamas divided into superior and inferior\" (quoted in Y.Hr., p. 271). 10. Mahakarunika is probably a Pasupata sect. The four instruments could also possibly be Pure Knowledge, Sound, the Drop and the metres. 11. See chapter 45 of this section of the JY. 12. We are reminded of Sumati who was Abhinava's grand teacher of Trika Saivism. He was reputed to have known all five currents of scripture (see commentary on TA. 1/213). 13. vamadaksinamisresu bhinnapithacatustayam | vyapadisyate mukhyavac cchakha sakhantare sthitam ║ (JY, fl. 168a).

Ibid., fl. 182b. 21. It is worth noting that the Lakulisapasupata, or at least the branch of it associated with Musalendra, is linked with the Mantrapitha. Interesting also is their association with the Rsi Gautama because in the Puranas he is portrayed as being indirectly responsible for the origin of the 'unorthodox' Tantras. The story is told in the Kurmapurana (1/15/95 fl.) and the Varaha (chapters 70 and 71). Once, the story goes, a long drought devastated the country and afflicted the inhabitants with severe famine. Amongst the victims was a group of ascetics who, to save themselves, sought Gautama's hospitality in his hermitage in Daruvana. Gautama enjoyed their company and so after the famine was over he insisted that they continue to stay with him. Although they did not wish to do so, they felt obliged to accept the invitation and so stayed. Once, when Gautama happened to go away for a few days, they found their opportunity to leave. They created a magic cow which they substituted for a real one in the hermitage. When Gautama returned, the illusory cow died and the ascetics charged him with its death and so, on the pretext that he had committed a sin, left. After the ascetics had gone, Gautama realized that he had been tricked and cursed them to be outside the Vedic fold (vedabahya). The fallen sages, worried by the consequences of the curse, invoked Visnu and Siva with hymns in Sanskrit (laukikastotra) entreating them to free them from their sins. Out of compassion, the two gods revealed the heretical (pasanda) and deluding scriptures (mohana-sastra) of the Kapala, Nakula, Varna, Bhairava, Purvapascima, Pancaratra and Pasupata. 22. Asitanga is fifth in the Daksinaiantra list of the PLSS. It is also fifth in the list of the sixty-four Bhairavatantras in the SKS. Ekapada is the twenty-fifth Daksinatantra in the PLSS. An Ekapadapurana is listed as the sixth upagama of the Cintyagama. Sekhara is the twenty-first in the Daksinalantra list. A Sivasekhara is the thirteenth upagama of the Cintyagama. Amria is the name of the sixth upagama of the Cintyagama; this may be the Mahamrta. Bhima is the sixteenth Daksnatantra. The Bijabheda which is the twenty-fourth Tantra amongst the Vamatantras may be the Bijatantra. 23. The Viratantra may be the fifth Ructragama or the eleventh upagama of the Viragama. The Candasidhara is the ninth Bhulatantra. A Bhutatantra is listed as the fifth upagama of the Amsumadagama; this may be either the Bhutogra or Bhutanigraha. Vijaya is the name of the first Rudragama and the eighth upagama of the Vijaya. The ninth Vamatantra in the PLSS list is called Vijaya while the Vijaya is the twenty-ninth Tantra in the SKS list. Damaratantras are said to deal with magic and are often regarded as a group on their own. Damara is the sixty-first Tantra listed in the SKS. 24. moksavarodhakam yad yat tasya tasya hi vastutah | nigrahaikaparam yena tena krodham udahrtam || (JY, fl. 172a)."},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"198 NOTES (The word \"krodha\"'\\s a masculine noun; here it is treated as if it were neuter). 25. An Anantatantra is listed as the first upagama of the Vimaldgama. Anantavijaya is listed as the twenty-first Vamaiantra. Para is the name of the eighteenth Rudragama while Amrta is the sixth upagama of the Cintyagama. Ananda is listed as the seventeenth Vamatantra; it is also the name of the sixth upagama of the Diptagama. 26. For the Sarvavira and SYM see index. A Visvadyamata is the twenty-fourth in the Bhairavatantra list of the SKS. Visvavikantha is thirtieth in the Daksinatantra list while the Yoginijalasambara is the twenty-ninth. 27. The JY says: savyasrotasi siddhani sira(s)chidrabhayatmakam || nayottaram maharaudram mahasammohanam tatha | trikam etat mahadevi vamasrotasi nirgatam || We have translated this verse above (p. 36) as follows: \"Belonging to the Current of the Left are the perfect [Agamas including] the frightening Sirascheda. The three: Nayottara, Mahdraudra and Mahasammohana have, O goddess, emerged in the Current of the Left.\" Although this is certainly a possible translation of these lines, the JY does not in fact reckon itself to be exclusively amongst the Vamatantras but prefers to classify itself amongst the Daksinatantras. It does, however, also say that it belongs to both Currents (see above p. 113). although in the detailed description of the contents of these Currents it is amongst those of the Middle Current and so we have listed it there accordingly. 28. The Ucchusmatantra is eighteenth in the Daksinatantra list, thirty-fourth in the NSA list and seventh in that of the SKS. The Sarvatobhadratantra is mentioned in VST, v. 317 along with the Mahasammohana. It is therefore probably a Vamatantra. 29. These are listed further ahead as the eight Tantras which constitute the Cakrabheda of the sixty-four Bhairavatantras. 30. A Bhimasamhita is listed as the fifth upagama of the Karanagama and as the sixteenth Daksinatantra. Tilaka may be the Tilakodydnabhairava which is the thirty-second Daksinatantra. 31. Siddhdrtha, the first Tantra in this list, may be the Siddhagama which is the sixteenth Rudragama; if so this confirms the JY's statement that the six remaining Tantras are still ideal rather than actual. 32. These gods and goddesses are frequently portrayed as given to orgiastic revelry or other chaotic behaviour which threatens to disrupt the cosmic, ethical and divine order. Goudriaan (Vinasikhatantra, introduction p. 19) refers us to another example found in the Yogavasistha (the first half of the nirvanaprakarana 18/24 ff.). Here Tumburu and Bhairava are described as enthroned together and surrounded by eight Mothers (matrka) said to belong to the Left Current and to be associated with Tumburu. Their appearance and activity is intense. Their revelry and drunkenness breaks all limits of cultured behaviour but they are put in their place by Siva."},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"Notes to Appendix C 199 33. nilarudrodbhavanyadyah sisyas te astastakasritah | (JY, fl. 177b). 34. Troitala is the twenty-seventh Garudatantra in the PLSS list, and the forty-sixth in the NSA list. The Bimlusara is the third in the Garudatantra list while the Bindutantra is no. 37 in the SKS's list of Bhairavatantras. Possibly the Mahodayatantra corresponds to the Cintamanimahodaya which is the fourth Vamatantra in the PLSS list. The Bhutadamara listed here may be the well-known Tantra concerned wth magic of this name. For the Vijayatantra see fn. 23 above. Nilaketu may be the Nilatantra which is the third upagama of the Kiranagama or Nilarudraka which is the eighth upagama of the Cintyagama. Mohana is the fourth Vamatantra in the PLSS's list. The Sikhatantra may be the Sikhamrta, Sikhayoga or Sikhasara which are, respectively, the twelfth, tenth and eleventh in the PLSS's list of Garudatantras. Karkota may be the third Bhutatamra. The Daurvasamrta may correspond to the Daurvasa listed as the twenty-third Vamatantra. Lalitah the name of the twelfth Rudragama and also that of its first upagama. Bhogineya may be Bhoga, the first upagama of the Vimalagama. 35. The JY defines \"yamala\"as the worship which takes place through the union of husband and wife: dampatyayogatah puja yamaleti nigadyate | (Ibid., fl. 169a). Abhinava refers to a ritual type in the TA which he says is found in a number of Tantras. This involves the projection of Vidya liturgical formulas on the body of the Tantric consort and Mantric formulas on the body of the Tantric master as a preiude to ritual intercourse. In this way the female partner becomes the embodiment of the brilliant 'Lunar' energy of the sphere of objectivity and the male, the 'Solar' energy of the sphere of cognitive consciousness. These two represent the Vidya and Manlra-pithas respectively which fuse when the couple unite (TA, 29/166b-8a). In short \"Mantra\" can also denote the male Tantric partner and \"Vidya\" the female, while \"yamala\" is the ritual union of the two. 36. yamalam yugalam nama mantravidyaikagocaram | jnanakriyatmakam tac ca anyonyapeskaya sthitam || (JY, fl. 182b). 37.

The similarities between this system and that of the modern ascetic, orders (particularly those of the Dasanami sannyasins) suggests that they were influenced in their formation by it. Thus each Dasanami order has its own internal subdivisions called madhis, a word which is clearly derived from the word \"malha\" of which \"mathika\" is the diminutive. A variant, although not common, form of the word mathika is madhika (see, for example, ibid., fl. 188b) from which we get the word \"madhi.\" Sinha and Sarasvati writing about the central organisation (i.e., the Akhara system) of the Dasanami orders say \"all the Dasanami ascetics, excepting the Dandis, admitted that they are divided into fifty-two Madhis - also known as Dhunis . . , Excepting Ashrama and Tirtha all others in the Ten Names are connected with the Madhi organiza­tion.\" This has also been noted by Ghurye. The term \"Madhi\"does not signify a recruiting or initiating centre. Etymologically it is a vernacular diminutive of the Sanskrit word \"matha,\" and in usage it stands for a lineage in spiritual kinship or what is called \"nada vansa. \"as the ascetics call it. The names of the Madhis indicate persons. The consideration of Madhi for inheritance also indicates its kinship significance.\" Asceties of Kashi by Surajit Sinha and Baidyanath"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"Notes to Appendix C 201 Saraswati, N.
