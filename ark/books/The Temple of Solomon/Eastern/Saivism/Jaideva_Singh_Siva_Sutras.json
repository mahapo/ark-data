PRATYABHIJNAHRDAYAM The Secret of Self-recognition This work is a digest of the Pratyabhijna system of Kashmir Saiva philosophy prepared by Ksemaraja, avoiding all polemics. Pratyabhijna means recognition. Jiva is Siva; by identifying himself with his body, Jiva has forgotten his real nature. This teaching is meant to enable Jiva to recognise his own real self, i.e. Siva and to attain 'at-one-ment' with SIVA. VIJNANABHAIRAVA OR Divine Consciousness A classical treatise of yoga practices and philosophy according to the Kashmir tradition of Saivism. Vijnanabhairava is a very ancient book on Yoga. It studiously eschews mechanical worship, external rites and ceremonies and goes directly to the heart of the problem of the union of human consciousness with the Divine. It describes 112 types of yoga. For this purpose, it makes full use of all the aspects of human life - prana, manas, imagination and intuition. MOTILAL BANARSIDASS PUBLISHERS PVT. LTD.

The experience of Sadasiva is 'I am this' and that of Iswara is 'This am I' and Sadvidya or Suddhavidya Tattva, where 'I' and 'This' side of experience are equally balanced.

Gopinath Kaviraja called me and said, \"Recently one translation of Siva-Sutras into Hindi and another into English have been brought to my notice. I have been both pained and shocked by the flagrant errors committed by these translators. It is my earnest wish that you prepare another translation of this great book into English.\" My Guru's wish was more than a command to me. I looked into the translations referred to. A new interpretation should always be welcome, but when it goes against the very spirit and tradition of the system, it becomes a pernicious procedure. To cite one instance, the 5th sutra of the first section is worded as 'udyamo Bhairavah'. The word udyama has been translated as 'exertion'. The first section deals with Sambliava-upaya, Even the veriest tyro of Saivagarna knows that Sambhava upaya has nothing to do with exertion, and so 'udyama' does not and cannot mean exertion in this context. Even the struc-ture and grammar of the Sanskrit language have been twisted and tortured to yield certain pre-conceived meanings. Such preposterous translation is, to say the least, a literary crime. I had made a promise to carry out the commands of my Guru, but when I tried to understand the text, I found myself at sea. I was afraid of setting pen to paper lest I should do injustice to this great scripture. Kaviraja ji was too ill to teach. So I studied the text word by word with the help of Acarya Rameshvara Jha who is a great Sanskrit scholar and fully conversant with Saivagarna. I am very grateful to him for his help. I felt, however, that I should study it further with the help of one who has been brought up in the Saivagarna tradition. So I approached my old Guru, Svami Laksrnana Joo of Kashmir who, in spite of his old age and a heavy schedule of engagements with a number of scholars who had gathered round him, kindly agreed to help. He taught me the sutras together with the commentary of Ksemaraja and gave luminous exposition of"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"( viii ) some very knotty problems, I am deeply beholden to him for unravelling the meaning of this difficult text. Ksemaraja, in the introductory portion of his commentary, says that since many incongruous expositions had been given by the commentaries extant in his time, he undertook to write a new commentary in due conformity with the old tradition. I have, therefore, translated the sutras along with the Vimarsini commentary of Ksemaraja. The style of Ksemaraja is some-what involved, and so it has been an uphill task to translate his commentary into English. I have tried my best to make the translation as clear and readable as possible. Four commentaries on Siva-sutras are available at present, the Vimarsinl commentary of Ksemaraja in prose, the Siva-sutra-vrtti by some anonymous author in prose, the Siva-sutra-varttikam by Bhaskara in verse, and the Siva-sutra-varttikam by Varadaraja in verse. The Siva-sutra-vrtti is so close to Vimarsinl that it appears to be either a preliminary draft or a later abstract of the Vimarsinl. There is a strong presumption that the author of the Vrtti was Ksemaraja himself. The Varttikam by Varadaraja is only a rehash of the Vimarsinl in Verse. The Varttikam by Bhaskara is an independent commentary. He differs at places from Ksemaraja. I have indicated this in my notes or exposition wherever necessary. Ksemaraja's commentary is so detailed and scholarly that it has practically elbowed every other commen-tary out of existence. I have, therefore, duly followed Ksemaraja in my exposition. I have adopted the following plan in the book. Each sutra is given both in Devanagari and Roman script. Then the meaning of every word of the sutra is given in English followed by a translation of the whole sutra. This is followed by the Vimarsini commentary in Sanskrit. The commentary is then, translated into English. After this, copious notes are added on important and technical words.

The word Agama means a traditional doctrine or system which commands faith. The Saiva system,, in general, is known as Siva-sasana or Sivagama, The non-dualistic Saiva system of Kashmir is known as Trika-Sasana or Trika-sastra or Rahasya-sarnpradaya. The words sasana and sastra are very significant. Both contain the root sasa which means discipline. Sasana or Sastra means teaching containing rules for discipline. A Sastra or Sasana in India never meant merely an intellectual exposition of a particular system. It certainly expounded the fundamental principles of reality but at the same time laid down on the basis of the principles certain rules, certain norms of conduct which had to be observed by those who studied the particular Sastra. A Sastra was not simply a way of thought but also a way of life. The Saiva philosophy of Kashmir is generally called 'Trika Sastra, because it is philosophy of the triad - (1) Siva (2) Sakti (3) Nara -the bound soul or (1) para - the highest (2) parapara - identity in difference and (3) apara - difference. The literature of the Trika system of Kashmir falls into three categories, viz., (1) the Agama Sastra, (2) the Spanda .Sastra and (3) the Pratyabhijna Sastra. Agama Sastra: Agama Sastra is considered to be revelation by Siva. It lays down both the principles and practices of the system. Among the works belonging to the Agama category may be mentioned the following Tantras. Malinivijaya or Malinivijayottara, Svacchanda, Vijnana Bhairava, Mrgendra, Netra, Rudra-Yamala, Siva-Sutras, etc. Most of these taught generally the dualistic doctrine. The most important Agama of the Trika system was known as the Siva-Sutras."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"( xvi ) Siva-Sutras: The importance of this work consists in the fact that it was revealed to counter the effects of dualism.1 It is generally known as Sivopanisat-sangraha - a compendium containing the secret doctrine revealed by Siva. This was revealed to Vasugupta. There are three theories regarding the revelation of the Siva-Sntras to Vasugupta. 1. Kallata in the Spanda-vrtti says that Siva taught the Siva-Sntras in a dream to Vasugupta who was living on Mahadeva mountain in the valley of the Harvan stream behind the Shalimar garden near Srinagara. 2. Bhaskara says in his Varttika on the Siva-Sutras that they were revealed to Vasugupta in a dream by a Siddha - a perfected semi-divine being. 3. Ksemaraja, in his commentary Vimarsini, maintains that Siva appeared to Vasugupta in a dream and said, \"On the Mahadeva mountain, the secret doctrines are inscribed on a piece of stone. Collecting the doctrines from there, teach them to those who deserve grace.\" On waking up, Vasugupta went to the place and by a mere touch the particular stone turned up and he found the Siva-Sutras inscribed on it. The particular rock is still called Samkaropala, and it is said that the Sutras were inscribed on it. (See the plate No. 1). The rock is there, but there is no trace of the sutras. The following are the common points in all the theories regarding the discovery of the Siva-Sutras. 1. There was no human author of the Sutras. They origi-nated from Siva. 2. They were revealed to Vasugupta. Whether they were revealed to him by Siva in a dream or by a Siddha or they were found on a rock at the instance of Siva are matters which are irrelevant to the main issue of the revela-tion. S.S.V.P.5."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"xvii Date of the Discovery of the Sutras: We know from Rajatarangini that Kallata flourished in the reign of king Avanti-Varman of Kashmir, Avanti-Varman reigned in the 9th Century A.D. Vasugupta who had discovered the Siva-Sutras was the guru (teacher) of Kallata. He must have flourished either in the last part of the 8th Century or the beginning of the 9th Century A.D. This must have been therefore, the date of the discovery of the Sutras. Commentaries on the Siva-Sutras: Ksemaraja says in his commentary Vimarsini that he noticed discrepancies in the various commentaries prevalent in his time. Therefore, he undertook to write a new commentary. He has not named the commentaries in which he noticed discrepancies. Only four commentaries have survived. 1. The Vrtti. 2. The Varttika by Bhaskara. 3. The Vimarsini by Ksemaraja. 4. The Siva-Sutra-varttikam by Varadaraja alias Krsnadasa. The author of the Vrtti is not known. The commentary vrtti tallies with Vimarsini not only in interpretation but also mostly in words. It appears that either the Vrtti was written at first and was used by Ksemaraja as a framework for elaboration or that Vimarsini was written at first and either Ksemaraja himself or some one else prepared an abstract of it in the Vrtti. Bhaskara says in the introductory portion of his Varttika that Vasugupta taught the Siva-Sutras to Kallata who taught them to Pradyumnabhatta, the son of his maternal uncle. Pradyumnabhatta taught them to his son Prajnarjuna. Prajnar-juna taught them to a pupil, Mahadevabhatta who in turn taught them to his son, Srikanthabhatta. Bhaskara himself learned the sutras from Srikanthabhatta. Bhaskara flourished in the 11th century A.D. So his Varttika was written during that period. The Vrtti gives the main ideas of the Sutras in a very succinct form in prose. Bhaskara in his Varttika interprets each sutra in verse. The Vimarsini commentary of Ksemaraja gives a lucid and detailed exposition of each sutra in prose. He substantiates his"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"xviii interpretation by giving parallel and valuable quotations from other books some of which are now completely lost to us. It is well-known that Ksemaraja was a pupil of Abhinavagupta who flourished in the 10th Century. The Vimarsini Commen-tary must have been written by Ksemaraja in the 10th Century. Ksemaraja was a prolific writer. He wrote the following works: Pratyabhijnahrdayam, Spandasandoha, Spandanirnaya, Svac-chandoddyota, Netroddyota, Vijnanabhairavoddyota, Siva-sutra-vimarsini, Stavacintamanitika, Parapravesika, Tattvasan-doha, Utpala's Stotravalitika. The fourth commentary on the Siva-Sutras is the Siva-Sutra-varttikam by Varadaraja alias Krsnadasa. The Varttika of Varadaraja is only a rehash of the Vimarsini in Verse. Varada-raja has no interpretation of his own to give. He lived towards the end of the 15th Century A.D. Of all the commentaries that have survived, Vimarsini by Ksemaraja is the oldest and the most learned. 2. Spanda Sastra This elaborates the principles laid down in the Siva-Sutras. It works out the details of the Siva-Sutras mainly from the point of view of Sakti. The main work of this Sastra is the Spanda-sutras or Spanda Karika as generally known. On this, there are the following commentaries: Pradipa by Utpala Vaisnava, Vivrti by Ramakantha, Spanda-sandoha and Spandanirnaya by Ksemaraja. Spandasandoha contains a commentary only on the first Karika. Ksemaraja thinks that the Spanda-Sutras were written by Vasugupta. Others maintain that they were written by Kallata, the pupil of Vasugupta. 3. The Pratyabhijha Sastra: This contains the philosophy proper of the system. It ex-pounds the Trika philosophy by arguments and discussions. The first philosophical work was Siva-drsti composed by Somananda. He was the pupil of Vasugupta. He flourished in the 9th Century A.D. Siva-drsti is a very important philo-sophical work. Unfortunately the full text is not yet available."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"xix Somananda composed a vrtti on Siva-drsti, but it has not been traced as yet. The most important available work of this Sastra is the Pratyabhijna-sutras or Isvara-pratyabhijna by Utpala who was a pupil of Somananda. The Pratyabhijna-sutras acquired so much importance that the whole philosophy of Kashmir is generally known as Pratyabhijna-darsana. There are the follow-ing commentaries on the Pratyabhijna-sutras. 1. The Vrtti by Utpala himself available only in an incomplete form. 2. The Pratyabhijnavimarsini by Abhinavagupta. 3. The Pratyabhijna-vivrti-vimarsini by Abhinavagupta. This is a commentary on the lost tika known as Vivrti by Utpala himself. Besides the above, there is the great work known as Tantraloka by Abhinavagupta. It is in 12 volumes and contains the Saiva philosophy and practice in all their aspects. There is also the digest of the twelve volumes known as Tantrasara. Jayaratha has written the commentary Viveka on Tantraloka. The Philosophical Background of the Siva-Sutras: Siva-sutras are a treatise on Yoga, but this Yoga is based on a definite system of Philosophy. It will not be possible to understand this yoga unless there is a clear grasp of the philo-sophy on which it is based. We may consider the philosophical background of this Yoga under the following heads: 1. Ultimate Reality. 2. Manifesta-tion or the world-process. 3. Bondage. 4. Liberation. 1. Ultimate Reality: Ultimate Reality is cit or Parasamvit. It is non-relational consciousness. It is the changeless principle of all changes. In it, there is no distinction of subject and object, of I and This. It is the Supreme Self surveying Itself. In the words of Pratya-bhijna Sastra, it is prakasa-vimarsamaya. Prakasa is the Eternal Light without which nothing can appear. It is Siva. Vimarsa is Sakti, the svabhava of Siva. It is, so to speak, the mirror in which Siva realizes His own grandeur, power and beauty. Vimarsa is the Kartrtva Sakti (the power of doership) of Siva."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"XX Mere Prakasa cannot be the nature of Reality. Even diamond is prakasa, but the diamond does not know itself as prakasa. Vimarsa is that aspect of prakasa by which it knows itself. That self-knowledge is an activity. Vimarsa betokens that activity. As Ksemaraja says in his Parapravesika (p. 2), Vimarsa is \"akrtrimaham iti visphuranarn.\" It is the non-relational, immediate awareness of I. Ksemaraja rightly says, \"Yadi nirvimarsah syat anisvaro jadasca prasajyeta\" (Parapravesika, p. 2) i.e. \"If Ultimate Reality were merely prakasa and not also vimarsa, it would be entirely powerless and inert.\" It is this I-consciousness of Ultimate Reality that is responsible for the manifestation, maintenance, and re-absorption of the universe. Cit is conscious of itself as Cidrupini sakti. This conscious-ness of itself as Cidrupini sakti is Vimarsa. Vimarsa has been named variously as parasakti, svatantrya, aisvarya, Kartrtva, sphuratta, sara, hrdaya, spanda. (Parapravesika, p. 2). It is because Sankara Vedanta considers Brahman to be only prakasa or jnana (light or illumination) without any vimarsa or activity that it has to invoke the help of Maya for the manifesta-tion of the universe. Brahman is devoid of any activity; it is, therefore, impotent to create. It is, only Isvara or mayopahita caitanya that can manifest the universe. But whence does this Maya drop in? If it is some power extraneous to Brahman or Isvara, then Sankara Vedanta is reduced to dualism. If Maya is only an expression of the power of Brahman, then Brahman cannot be divested of activity. Both Sankhya and Vedanta consider the Purusa or Atma to be niskriya or inactive, because they take the word 'activity' in a very crude sense. Surely, Brahman or Atma does not work like a potter or watch-maker. The very Vimarsa, the very Iccha (will) of the Divine is spiritual energy of incalculable force that can proliferate into any form from the subtlest to the grossest. Svatantrya or unimpeded Sovereignty is the characteristic par excellence of Siva. It expresses itself into Ichha (will) which immediately translates itself into jnana (knowledge) and kriya (action). Ultimate Reality is not only Universal Consciousness but also Supreme spiritual energy or Power. This All-inclusive"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"xxi Universal Consciousness is also called Anuttara, the Highest Reality, the Absolute. It is both transcendental (visvottirna) and immanent (visvamaya). 2. Manifestation or the World Process: It is the svabhava or very nature of Ultimate Reality to mani-fest. Creativity is of the very essence of Divinity. If Ultimate Reality did not manifest, it would not be Self or consciousness, but not-Self, something like a jar. As Abhinavagupta puts it: Tantraloka, III, 100. \"If the Highest Reality did not manifest in infinite variety, but remained cooped up within its solid, singleness, it would neither be the Highest Power nor Consciousness, but something like a jar.\" Ultimate Reality or Parama Siva is prakasavimarsamaya. In that state, the 'I' and the 'This' are in an undivided unity. The 'I' is the prakasa aspect. 'This' or its consciousness of itself is the vimarsa aspect. This Vimarsa is svatantrya or unimpeded sovereign power or Sakti. This Vimarsa is not contentless. It contains all that is to be. Paratnmsika, 34. \"As the great banyan tree lies only in the form of potency in the seed, even so the entire universe with all the mobile and immobile beings lies as a potency in the heart of the Supreme.\" The Sakti of the Supreme is called Citi or parasakti or paravak. We shall see in the sequel what part parasakti or paravak plays in the manifestation of word and its object. Parama Siva has infinite powers, but the following may be considered to be the main ones: 1. Cit - the power of Self-revelation, the changeless prin-ciple of all changes. In this aspect, the Supreme is known as Siva."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"xxii 2. Ananda or Absolute bliss. This is also called svatantrya, In this aspect, the Supreme is known as Sakti. Cit and ananda are the very svarupa or nature of Pararna Siva. The rest may be considered to be His Saktis. 3. Iccha or Will. In this aspect, He is known as Sadasiva or Sadakhya. 4. Jnana or knowledge. In this aspect, He is known as Isvara. 5. Kriya - the power of assuming any and every form. In this aspect, He is known as Sadvidya or Suddha Vidya. The Universe is simply an opening out (unmesa) or expansion (prasara) of the Supreme as Sakti. The following appear in the course of manifestation. I. THE TATTVAS OF THE UNIVERSAL EXPERIENCE 1-5 As has already been said Parama Siva has two aspects, viz., transcendental (visvottirna) and immanent or creative. This creative aspect of Parama Siva is known as Siva tattva. 1. Siva tattva is the initial creative movement (prathama spanda) of Parama Siva. 2. Sakti tattva is the Energy of Siva. She polarizes Con-sciousness into Aham and ldam (I and This) - Subject and object. Sakti, however, is nothing separate from Siva. Siva in his creative aspect is known as Sakti. She is His ahamvimarsa (I-consciousness), His unmukhata or intentness to create. Just as an artist cannot contain his delight within himself, but pours it out into a song, or a poem, even so Parama Siva pours out the delightful wonder of His splendour into manifestation. In .Sakti tattva, ananda aspect of the Supreme is predominant. Siva and .Sakti tattvas can never be separated. 3. Sadasiva or Sadakhya Tattva: The will (Iccha) to affirm the 'This' side of the Universal Experience is known as sadasiva or Sadakhya tattva. In Sadasiva, Iccha (Will) is predominant. The experience of this stage is 'I am this', but the 'this' is only a hazy (asphuta) experience. The predominant side is still 'I'. The Ideal Universe is experienced as an indistinct something in the depth of consciousness."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"xxiii Sadasiva tattva is the first manifestation (abhasa). In this Uni-versal Experience, both the subject and object are consciousness. Consciousness in this aspect becomes perceptible to Itself; hence a subject and an object. 4. Isvara or Aisvarya Tattva The next stage of the Divine experience is that where Idam or the This side of the total experience becomes a little more defined (sphuta). This is known as Isvara tattva. It is unmesa or dis-tinct blossoming of the Universe. At this stage, jnana or knowledge is predominant. The experience of Sadasiva is 'I am this'. The experience of Isvara is: 'This am I.' 5. Sadvidya or Suddhavidya Tattva: In the Sadvidya tattva, the 'I' and the 'This' side of experience are equally balanced like the two pans of an evenly held balance (samadhrtatulaputanyayena). At this stage, kriya sakti is pre-dominant. The 'I' and 'This' are recognized in this state with such equal clarity that while both 'I' and 'This' are still identified, they can be clearly distinguished in thought. The experience of this stage may be called diversity-in-unity (bhedabheda-vimarsa-natma) i.e. while the 'This' is clearly distinguished from 'I', it is still felt to be a part of the 'I' or Self. What is 'I' is This', what is 'This' is 'I' i.e. they have samanadhikarana. The experience of this stage is known as parapara dasa. It is intermediate between the para or higher and apara or the lower. Upto this stage, all experience is ideal i.e. in the form of an idea. Hence it is called the perfect or pure order (Suddhddhva) i.e. a manifestation in which the svarupa or the real nature of the Divine is not yet veiled. II. THE TATTVAS (PRINCIPLES) OF THE LIMITED INDIVIDUAL EXPERIENCE 6-11 Maya and the Five Kancukas Now begins the play of Maya tattva. From this stage onward, there is Asuddhddhva or impure order in which the higher, ideal nature of the Divine is veiled. All this happens because of"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"xxiv Maya and her kancukas, Maya is derived from the root 'ma', to measure out. That which makes experience measurable i.e. limited, and severs the 'This' from 'I' and 'I' from 'This' and excludes things from one another is Maya. Upto Sadvidya, the experience is universal; the 'This means 'all this', the total universe. Under the operation of Maya, 'this' means merely 'this', different from every thing else. From now on starts sahkoca or contraction, limitation. Maya draws a veil (avarana) on the Self owing to which he forgets his real nature, and thus Maya generates a sense of difference. The products of Maya are the five Kancukas or coverings. Their functions are given below: (i) Kala. This reduces the sarvakartratva (universal author-ship) of the universal Consciousness and brings about limitation in respect of authorship or efficacy. (ii) Vidya. This reduces the omniscience (sarvajnatva) of the Universal Consciousness and brings about limitation in respect of knowledge. (iii) Raga. This reduces the all-satisfaction (purnatva) of the Universal Consciousness and brings about desire for parti-cular things. (iv) Kala. This reduces the eternity (nityatva) of the Uni-versal Consciousness and brings about limitation in respect of time i.e. division of past, present and future. (v) Niyati. This reduces the freedom and pervasiveness (svatantrata and vyapakatva) of the Universal consciousness and brings about limitation in respect of cause, space, and form. It is interesting to note that the Trika Philosophy of Kashmir had anticipated the German philosopher Kant a thousand years before in the analysis of experience. Hume had reduced experience to a passing phantasmagoria of ideas among which there was no binding principle whatsoever. Kant brought about a Copernican revolution in Philosophy by proving that real experience consists of synthetic judgements which are characterized by necessity and universality. Neces-sity and Universality are not products of experience. They are a priori i.e. prior to experience. Senses only provide the data of experience, but Understanding imposes its own laws on the data of experience to transform them into synthetic, harmonious"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"XXV whole of knowledge. Kant called these laws categories. These are inherent in the very constitution of mind. Trika or Pratyabhijna philosophy maintains that the expe-rience of the empirical individual is constituted by Maya together with her Kancukas of Kala, vidya, raga, kala and niyati. Kant takes time and space to be forms of intuition. All our experiences are delimited by space and time - Pratyabhijna philosophy also teaches that all our experiences are delimited by Kala and Niyati. Kant believes that man's experience occurs only in a spatio-temporal frame. Pratyabhijna philosophy also believes that man is so constituted by Maya that his experiences are bound to be circumscribed by Kala and Niyati. The very word Maya means that power by which experience is measured in a particular way (miyate anaya iti Maya. In Pratyabhijna philosophy, maya-pramata, citta-pramata, sakala, anu and jiva are all synonyms for the empirical individual. There are three functions of Niyati in Pratyabhijna - limita-tion in space, causality and the measure of a form of things. The first two are covered by Kant's idea of space and the category of causality. There is nothing in Kant's philosophy similar to the third function of Niyati. Kant's category of relation is included in Niyati. His categories of quantity, quality and moda-lity come under the Kancuka Vidya. Kant's theory is confined only to episternology. Kant has formulated his theory only with reference to knowledge. Pratya-bhijna has formulated its theory both with referene to knowledge and activity. In Pratyabhijna philosophy, there are two Kancukas, viz., Kala and Raga which have no parallel in Kant's system. Both of these are connected with activity. Man is not only a bundle of knowledge. He is also an active being. Kala denotes limitation in respect of action. No man is all-powerful like Siva. Raga denotes his valuation, his crav-ing for various things. Just as Kala expresses loss of full sove-reignty in the case of the maya-pramata, the empirical individual, even so Raga expresses loss of perfection. Kant maintained that there are two sources of knowledge -matter and form. Matter is provided by Nature and form is imposed on it by mind. Thus there is dualism in Kant's philosophy. According to Pratyabhijna philosophy, both"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"xxvi matter and form are provided by Maya. Form is provided by Vidya, Kala and Niyati and matter is provided by Kala. Maya gives rise to Pradhana or Prakrti by her power of Kala.* From Prakrti are derived buddhi, ahathkara and manas. From aham-kdra arise five sense-organs, and five organs of action and the five tanmatras, and from the five tanmatras arise the five gross elements. So both matter and form of knowledge arise from Maya and Maya arises from Siva-Sakti. Thus there is unmitigated non-dualism in Pratyabhijna. Kant says that we cannot know the world, Self, and God by the understanding and the categories. Pratyabhijna philosophy also maintains that Maya and the phenomena built by her are in asuddha adhva and the knowledge derived in asuddha adhva is through vikalpas or distinction-making mental constructs whereas knowledge of the cosmos, Self and God is nirvikalpa - non-distinctive, non-discursive. Kant maintains that the knowledge of the cosmos, self and God can be obtained only through moral and spiritual discipline. Pratyabhijna philosophy also maintains that the knowledge of the highest Reality can be obtained only through sadhana (spiri-tual praxis) - through anava, sakta and sambhava upaya. III. THE TATTVAS OF THE LIMITED INDIVIDUAL 12 Purusa Siva through Mayasakti which limits His universal knowledge and power becomes Purusa or the individual subject. Purusa in this context means every sentient being. Purusa is also known as anu in this system. The word anu is used in the sense of limitation of the divine perfection. 13 Prakrti While Purusa is the subjective manifestation of Siva, Prakrti is the objective manifestation. There is a difference between the Sankhya conception of Prakrti and that of Trika. Sankhya believes that Prakrti is (Tantraloka, 2)"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"xxvii one and universal for all the Purusas. Trika believes that each Purusa has a different Prakrti. Prakrti is the matrix of all Objectivity. Prakrti has three gunas or genetic constituents, viz., sattva, rajas and tamas. In her unmanifested state Prakrti holds these gunas in perfect equipoise. In the order of being, sattva is characterized by brightness and lightness, in the psychological order, it is characterized by transparency, joy and peace; in the ethical order, it is the principle of goodness. In the order of being, tamas is the principle of darkness, inertness; in the psy-chological order, it is characterized by dullness, delusion and dejection, and in the ethical order, it is the principle of degrada-tion, debasement. In the order of being, rajas is characterized by activity; in the psychological order, it is characterized by craving and passion; in the ethical order, it is the principle of ambition and avarice. According to Pratyabhijna, Prakrti is the Santa Sakti of Siva, and the gunas sattva, rajas and tamas are only the polarization of His saktis of jnana, iccha and kriya respectively. Thus in the Pratyabhijna system, there is perfect non-dualism, not dualism of Prakrti and Purusa, as in Sankhya. Purusa is the experient (bhokta) and Prakrti is the experienced (bhogya). IV. THE TATTVAS OF MENTAL OPERATION 14-16 Buddhi, Ahamkara, and Manas Prakrti differentiates into antahkarana (the psychic apparatus), indriyas (senses) and bhutas (matter). Antahkarana means the inner instrument, the psychic appa-ratus of the individual. It consists of the tattvas - buddhi, ahamkara, and manas. 1. Buddhi is the ascertaining intelligence (vyavasayatmika). The objects that are reflected in buddhi are of two kinds -(a) external, e.g., a jar which is perceived through the eye, (b) internal - the images built out of the samskaras (the impres-sions left behind on the mind). 2. Ahamkara. This is the product of buddhi. It is the I-making principle and the power of self-appropriation."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"xxviii 3. Manas. It is the product of aharhkara. It co-operates with the senses in building up perceptions, and by itself, it builds images and concepts. V-VII. THE TATTVAS OF SENSIBLE EXPERIENCE 17-31 1. The five powers of sense-perception. Jnanendriyas or Buddhindriyas which are products of aharhkara are the tattvas of sensible experience. The five powers are those of (i) smelling (ghranendriya), (ii) tasting (rasanendriya), (iii) seeing (caksur-indriya), (iv) feeling by touch (sparsendriya), (v) hearing (sravanen-driya). 2. The five Karmendriyas or powers of action. These are also products of ahamkara. These are powers of (i) speaking (vagindriya), (ii) handling (hastendriya), (iii) locomotion (paden-driya), (iv) excreting (payvindriya), (v) sexual action and restful-ness (upasthendriya). The indriyas are not sense-organs but powers which operate through the sense-organs. 3. The five tanmatras or primary elements of perception. These are also products of ahamkara. Literally tanmatra means 'that only'. These are the general elements of the par-ticulars of sense-perception. They are: (i) sound-as-such (sabda-tanmatra) (ii) touch-as-such (sparsa-tanmatra), (iii) colour-as-such (rupa-tanmatra), (iv) flavour-as-such (rasa-tanmatra), (v) odour-as-such (gandha-tanmatra). VIII. THE TATTVAS OF MATERIALITY 32-36 The Five Bhutas The five gross elements or the panca-mahabhutas are the products of the five tanmatras. (i) Akasa is produced from sabda-tanmatra. (ii) Vayu is produced from sparsa-tanmatra. (iii) Teja (Agni) is produced from rupa-tanmatra. (iv) Apas is produced from rasatanmatra. (v) Prthivi is produced from gandnatanmatra."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"xxix The Individual Self or Jiva Caitanya or Siva forms the very core of the being of every individual. It is his real Self. The physical aspect of the individual Self consists of the panca mahabhutas, the five gross elements highly organized, known as sthula sarira or the physical body. There is also prana sakti working in him. It is by this prana sakti - that he is sustained and maintained. His psychic apparatus is known as antahkarana (the inner apparatus) consisting of manas, buddhi and ahamkara. These three together with the five tanmatras form a group of eight known as puryastaka. This, according to Trika, forms the subtle body (suksma-sarira) in which the soul leaves the body at the time of death. In each individual, there is Kundalini which is a form of Sakti and lies dormant at the base of the spine. Each individual has normally an experience of three states of consciousness waking, dream and deep sleep. There is, however, a fourth state of consciousness, known as turiya. This is the consciousness of the central Self or Siva in each individual, This is a witnessing consciousness of which the individual is normally not aware. The turiya is pure cidaananda-conscious-ness and bliss. The individual's mind is conditioned by habit energy (Vasana) of previous lives. When by yogic practices, his mind becomes deconditioned, then he attains the turiya cons-ciousness, and becomes a jivan-mukta i.e. liberated while still alive. 3. Bondage The bondage of the individual is due to innate ignorance or anava mala. It is this primary limiting condition which reduces the universal consciousness to an anu or a limited creature. It comes about by the limitation of the lccha Sakti of the Supreme. It is owing to this that the jiva considers himself to be a separate entity cut off from the universal stream of consciousness. It is consciousness of self-limitation and imperfection. Coming in association with asuddhaadhva, he becomes further limited by mayiya mala and karma mala. Mayiya mala is the limited condition brought about by maya. It is bhinna vedya"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"XXX pratha - that which brings about the consciousness of difference owing to the differing limiting adjuncts of the body etc. This comes about by the limitation of the jnana sakti of the Supreme. Karma mala is the limiting condition brought about by the vasanas or residual traces of actions done under the influence of desire. It is the force of these vasanas that carries the jiva from one life to another. 4. Liberation: Liberation, according to the system, means the recognition (pratyabhijna) of one's true nature which means akrtrima-aham-vimarsa - the original, innate, pure I-consciousness. The normal psychological I-consciousness is relational i.e. the Self-consciousness is in contrast with the not-Self. The pure I-consciousness is immediate awareness. When one has this consciousness, one knows one's real nature. This is what is meant by liberation. As Abhinavagupta puts it: Tantra I, p. 192. Moksa or liberation is nothing else but the awareness of one's true nature. The highest attainment, however, is that of Siva-consciousness in which the entire universe appears as I or Siva and this comes by Saktipata - the descent of Divine Sakti or anugraha (Divine grace). Upayas: In order to earn grace, one has to undergo spiritual discipline. This is known as upaya or yoga. The upayas are divided under four broad heads, viz., (1) Anupaya, (2) Sambhavopaya (3) Saktopaya and (4) Anavopaya. The prefix 'an' in anupaya in this context means 'little'. When through extreme Saktipata, only by once hearing a word from the guru (the spiritual director), the aspirant realizes the real Self and gets absorbed in the divine consciousness without any particular effort, one is said to have attained Self-realization through anupaya."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"xxxi Siva-sutra is a text on Yoga. It leaves anupaya, for it refers to a stage in which Self-realization is achieved without any speci-fic Yoga. It has been rightly said by Abhinavagupta: \"Even innumerable means cannot reveal Siva. Can a jar reveal the Sun? Pondering thus, one with a lofty vision gets absorbed immediately in Siva who is Self-luminous.\" Since this stage transcends all yogic activity, no description of it can be given. The book has three sections - In the first Section, it gives a description of Sarnbhavopaya, in the second of Saktopaya, and in the third of Anavopaya. We shall now consider these upayas in detail in the following pages. Siva-Siitras: FIRST SECTION The first sutra of this section gives the philosophical back-ground of this system as well as the experience of Sambhava Yoga. It says that caitanya or consciousness is Self or nature of reality. Caitanya in this system does not mean merely con-sciousness. It means consciousness which has the absolute free-dom of will, knowledge and action. Its essential nature is cit (consciousness) and ananda (bliss). It expresses itself in iccha (will), jnana (knowledge) and kriya (action). The question arises 'If the essential nature of jiva and jagat, of all experients and the world is Siva, how is it then that all beings in the world do not enjoy the bliss of Siva, but experience bondage - limitation in respect of willing, knowledge, and action? The answer is that the bondage of the empirical individual is due to anava, mayiya, and karma malas or limiting conditions. Anava mala is an innate, limiting condition which is the primal ignorance of our essential nature as Siva. Mayiya mala is due to"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"xxxii Maya which gives to the soul its gross and subtle body, and brings about sense of difference and karma Mala is due to vasanas or impressions left behind on the mind due to karma or motivated action. The primal ignorance which brings about anava mala is described in sutra 2, and the mayiya and karma mala have been described in sutra 3. Sutra 1 says that the bondage of the jiva or the empirical indi-vidual is due to sankucita jnana or limited knowledge. Ajnana or primal ignorance does not mean total absence of knowledge but limited and vitiated knowledge. Siva has svatantrya sakti, unimpeded power of bringing into being the cosmic drama. Through this, he brings into play His Mahamaya-sakti by means of which he veils his essential nature (sva-svatantrya-saktyabhasita-svarupa-gopana-rupaya mahamaya-saktya) and assumes limited knowledge and limited forms. Thus begins the world drama. The first stage is svarupa-nimesa or svarupa-gopana or veiling of His essential nature. This is the stage of the involution of the Divine into inconscient gross matter. This is the arc of descent. After that starts the slow and gradual process of svarupa-unmesa or svarupa prakasana or gradual revelation of His essential nature. This is the arc of ascent. Now begins the process of evolution, of the play of life and mind. It is only at the stage of man that the question of recognizing one's essential Divine nature arises. And it is for this recogni-tion (pratyabhijna) that there is provision for yoga or spiritual praxis. Ajnana or anava mala is only vitiated knowledge by which one considers the vehicles - gross, subtle bodies etc. as the Self. The three kinds of malas or limited, vitiated knowledge are rooted in words which have a tremendous influence on our lives. These are formed of letters which are known as Matrka. The Matrka becomes the basis of all limited knowledge. This is explained in Sutra 4. Matrka means unknown, unrealized mother. So long as the mystery of Matrka is not realized, she is a source of bondage or limitation. When her mystery is realized, she becomes the source of liberation."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"xxxiii Sambhava Yoga: Sutra 5. Udyamo Bhairavah gives in a nut-shell the des-cription of Sambhava yoga. Udyamah in this context does not mean exertion. There can be no question of exertion in Sambhava Yoga. It is known as icchopaya or iccha-yoga. It occurs by a mere orientation of the Will. It is also known as abhedopaya, a yoga in which there is complete identification of 'I' and Siva, in which the idea of the so-called 'I' which is only a psycho-physical complex, a mere nama-rupa disappears and Siva alone is experienced as the real I, as the real Self. It is also known as avikalpaka or nirvikalpaka yoga or upaya, for this experience occurs when there is complete cessation of all thought-constructs. This is a yoga in which there is no active process either of body or prana or manas or buddhi. Obviously udyama cannot mean exertion or discipline in this context. Ksemaraja rightly inter-prets udyama here as unmajjanarupah - as a form of emergence of Siva-consciousness. Sambhava Yoga is that (1) in which there is a sudden flash of the I-consciousness of Siva (2) in which all ideation ceases completely (sakala-kalpanakulalankavalana) (3) which occurs to those whose entire consciousness is absorbed in the inner Bhairava principle (antarmukha-etat-tattvavadhana-dhananam jayate). Malinivijaya puts Sambhava upaya in the following words: \"That is said to be Sambhava-samavesa (absorption in Siva-consciousness) which occurs to one who has freed himself of all ideation by an awakening imparted by the guru (the spiritual director) or by an intensive awakening (of his own).\" When there is identification with Siva without any mentation or thought-process, merely by an intensive orientation of Will power (iccha Sakti) towards the inner Reality, then is there Sambhava-Yoga or Sambhava Samavesa. In the jiva or empirical individual, Reality or Siva or the Divine transcendental Self is Light - Bliss that is ever shining within in its glory but is hidden from our gaze on account of our thought-constructs. Reality is an Eternal Presence within"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"xxxiv ourselves. It is Siddha, an everpresent Fact, not sadhya, not something to be brought into being by our efforts. It cannot be caught by our vikalpa-jala, by the net of our thought constructs, however cleverly we may cast it. The more we try to catch it, the more we try to grasp it, the more does it recede from us. We are prisoners of our own mind. Thought has to commit suicide in order to know our real Self, the Siva within ourselves. Vikalpa, the dichotomizing activity of our mind has to cease, the wheel of imagination has to stop. The ghost of our discur-sive intellect has to be laid to rest, before we are allowed to rea-lize our essential Self. Vikalpa 'like a dome of coloured class stains the white radiance of eternity'. When vikalpa ceases, the transcendental Self within us shines of itself. It is an Ex-perience in which the distinction of seer, seen and sight is com-pletely annulled. That is why it is called abhedopaya, a yoga in which the above distinction has disappeared. Thus when the mind neither accepts nor rejectes any idea, its activity ceases and one abides in one's essential Reality. As Abhinavagupta puts it beautifully: (Anuttarastika, 2) \"Neither reject anything, nor accept, abide in your essential Self which is an Eternal presence.\" Mr. J. Krishnamurti, a modern Yogi uses these very words (neither accept, nor reject) and calls it choiceless awareness, an awareness which is not of thought. Awareness is not thought. Awareness is not discipline, not habit. It cannot be practised. It is alertness from moment to moment. There is an inner dimension of Reality in which we are always living but which we do not know. Sambhava Yoga exhorts us to rediscover and realize it. This comes about, not by seeking, not by choice, not by discipline, but spontaneously when the mind has ceased cogitating and surrenders itself completely to the effulgence of the Divine Presence within. We find parallel attitudes to Sambhava Yoga in 'wu-wei (non-interference) of Taoism, 'let-go' of Zen, and choiceless awareness of Krishnamurti."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"xxxv In the third section of his Tantrasara, Abhinavagupta says that in Sambhavopaya, iccha sakti may be re-infoced by jnanasakti, by realizing that the entire universe of objective and subjective entities abides in the essential Self as its reflection. My own Saktis (powers) being reflected within me appear as the thirty-six tattvas. The saktis appear as Matrka, i.e. group of letter-sounds from 'ka' to 'ha' whose reflection appears in the form of the tattvas (constitutive principles) from Siva to earth. (For details, see the exposition of the 7th Sutra of the 2nd section). Ksemaraja adds at the end of his commentary on the 5th sutra of the first section that Sambhavopaya may be helped by the following Saktopdva: (III, 9) \"While one is engaged in one thought, and another arises, the junction-point between the two is the unmesa, i.e. revelation of the true nature of the Self which is the background of both the two thoughts. This may be experienced by every one for oneself.\" Krishnamurti, a modern mystic who has not read any Sanskrit book speaks of this experience in almost these very words on page 211 of his book, \"The First and Last Freedom.\" He calls unmesa the creative moment. It is not thought, but a flash of Understanding. Unmesa literally means opening of the eye-lid i.e. uncovering, Self-revelation. The sixth sutra says that when the experience of the essential Self, of Siva-consciousness continues in the normal course of life, then the entire universe appears only as an expansion of the collection of the Saktis (powers) of the Self and by an intensive awareness of this collective whole of saktis, the universe as some-thing separate from Siva or the divine Self disappears. There is complete unity-consciousness. Sutra 7 says that the experience of the inner Divine Self is the experience of the fourth (turiya) or transcendental consciousness and its bliss continues even when there is appearance of difference in the three states of waking, dream and deep sleep conscious-ness. Sutras 8, 9 and 10 tell us that from the spiritual point of view, he alone should be called awake who has realized Self. He who"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"xxxvi is subject to all kinds of uncontrolled fancies and thoughts is really in the state of dream although apparently he may be wide awake. He who has not obtained the discerning insight into Reality is in the state of deep sleep. The activities of those who have not awakened to the transcendental consciousness within are like those of a somnambulist, a sleep-walker. Sutra 11 tells us that he who retains the experience of the 4th or transcendental consciousness even in the other three states of deep sleep, dream and waking is alone the real bhokta or enjoyer and is the perfect master of his senses. Sutra 12 says in a general way that the Yogi who realizes his essential Self develops wonderful supernormal powers. Sutra 13 says that he develops Iccha sakti, the divine Will power and through this, he can bring about many marvellous changes. Sutras 14 and 15 maintain that to such a yogi, every objective observable phenomenon, whether external or internal appears as a form of his own consciousness. Sutra 16 says that he is now able to trace the origin of everything to Parama Siva and is completely absolved of all limiting conditions. Sutra 17 says that he is now fully convinced that his Self is none else but Siva, the Self of the universe. Sutra 18 tells us that the awareness of the Yogi that he is the subject of every expe-rience continues unabated. Sutra 19 says that by being united with Iccha sakti, the yogi can create any sort of body according to his desire. Sutra 20 tells us that such a yogi develops the power of joining the elements of all existence, the power of separating elements and the power of bringing together every-thing removed by space and time. Sutra 21 says that such a yogi, however, does not desire limited powers. Through the appearance of Suddha Vidya i.e. Unmana sakti in this context, he acquires cosmic consciousness and lord-ship over all the saktis. His highest experience is not simply self-realization (atmavyapti) but sivatva-yojana complete identi-fication with Siva (Siva-vyapti) - a state in which the universe is experienced as the Self-expression of Siva. Sutra 22 says that such a yogi being united with the infinite reservoir of Divine Power (mahahrada) has the experience of the Supreme I-consciousness which is the generative source of all the mantras."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"xxxvii Concluding Remarks: We have seen that Sambhava upaya does not advocate any particular effort or discipline for Self-realization. When we neither accept, nor reject, when there is simple awareness freed of all ideation, then there is a sudden, sponta-neous flash of experience of our essential Self: This is Sambhava Samavesa. This is direct, immediate realization. Anava and Sakta upayas are only paramparika i.e. leading to realization through successive stages - anava upaya leading to Sakta and Sakta leading to Sambhava upaya. The ultimate goal is Sambhava Samavesa - a spontaneous flash of Under-standing. Anava and Sakta upayas are only intermediate means to Sambhava Yoga. As has already been said, help in Sambhava Yoga may be taken from a proper understanding of Matrka. We shall discuss in detail about the proper application of Matrka in connection with Sakta upaya. Sambhava upaya is a special feature of Saivagama. There is no such yoga either in Vedanta or Patanjala yoga. The jnana-yoga of Vedanta corresponds somewhat to Sakta upaya and Patanjala yoga corresponds to a part of anava-upaya. Sambhava yoga is unknown to these systems. Anupaya is, really speaking, Sambhava yoga itself in its highest maturity (Ta.Kl-142).\" The Sambhava upaya itself, in its highest maturity is known as anupaya. \"Later on, the word Sahasa was employed by Vatulanatha of Kashmir to express the idea of Sambhava yoga and anupaya. The word Sahasa means sudden, unexpected happening. It beautifully expresses the idea of sudden sponta-neous flash of the Experience of the Divine Self. The ultimate aim of both Samkhya-yoga and Vedanta is mukti (liberation). By mukti, both of them understand Kai-valya, perfect isolation or Soleness, the only difference being that Samkhya-yoga aims at isolation from Prakrti while Vedanta aims at isolation from Maya. There is, however, one difference between the two in the concept of Self. According to Samkhya-Yoga, Self or Purusa is saccit (existence-consciousness) and there is nothing higher than Purusa. According to Vedanta, Self or Atma is Saccidananda (existence-consciousness-bliss) and is identical with Brahman."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"XXXVIII The ultimate aim of Saivagama is not simply mukti or Self-realization but Sivatva-yojana acquiring the status of Siva. In the words of Saivagama, the ultimate ideal is not merely Atma-vyapti but Siva-vyapti. In Atma-vyapti, there is Self-realization, but the concept of Self-realization in Saivagama is different from that of Vedanta. In Vedanta, Self is merely jnana devoid of any activity whatsoever. In Saivagama, Self is characterized by both jnana and kriya. But Atma-vyapti in Saivagama is a lower ideal. The highest ideal is Siva-vyapti. In Siva-vyapti, there is Siva-Sakti-samarasya, fusion and union of Siva-sakti. In Atma-vyapti, there is limited jnana-kriya (knowledge and activity); in Siva-vyapti, there is universal, all-pervasive jnana-kriyd. This Siva-vyapti is the status of Parama Siva who is simultaneously transcendent to and immanent in the universe. This comes about only when unmana sakti is developed. In Vedantic liberation, Maya disappears and along with it goes the wretched universe which was only a fiction conjured up by her. In Siva-vyapti, the universe appears as a magnificent expression of Siva's - one's own - Sakti. The liberated Self in Samkhya-yoga is only Saccit (existence-consciousness). The Self or Purusa is freed of all pain and suffer-ing, but he has no positive bliss. In Vedanta, the characteristic of Self is saccidananda (existence-consciousness-bliss). There is positive bliss in liberation. But it is only atmananda, the delight of Self. In Siva-vyapti, the entire universe gleams as the won-drous delight of I-consciousness. Both in Samkhya-Yoga and Vedanta, the citta or mind reverts to its causal matrix, the Prakrti at the time of liberation. Patan-jala yoga has a special word for this reversion, viz; pratiprasava which means reabsorption, remergence (into Prakrti). The defiling buddhi or citta has to withdraw into its primal cause. It is only then that Purusa can shine in his pristine, inherent glory. The citta can never be allowed to enter the sacred pre-cincts of Purusa. It is an alien and has to be repatriated to its original home. Saivagama which is undiluted advaita (non-dualism) has, however, a word of cheer even for the poor citta. According to it, the citta of the self-realized person becomes regenerated, transformed, transfigured into Cit (the Universal Divine"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"xxxix Consciousness). Sutra 13 of Pratyabhijnahrdayam announces the reassuring tidings of its higher destiny in unmistakable terms: On the realization of the five-fold act of the Self citta (the in-dividual consciousness), by inward movement becomes citi (universal consciousness) by rising to the status of cetana (the knowing subject). The following lucid commentary of Ksemaraja on this sutra deserves to be carefully pondered over: \"The citta giving up the limiting tendency of extroversion, becoming introverted, rises to the status of cetana i.e. to the status of the knowing subject, when by the dissolution of the aspect of limitation and attaining its real nature, it becomes citi. That is to say, it now enters its highest stage of cit.\" Citta is not an alien in this system. Sutra 5 of Pratyabhi-jnahrdayam says clearly: \"Citi (universal consciousness) itself, descending from the stage of Cetana (knower) becomes citta (individual conscious-ness), inasmuch as it becomes contracted in conformity with the objects of consciousness.\" In involution (avaroha, nimesa) citi becomes citta; in the highest stage of evolution (adhyaroha, unmesa) citta attains its real nature and becomes citi again. Section II. In section I, Sambhava upaya has been explained. It has been pointed out that the essential Self within is the Divine Self or Siva, but mind whose main characteristic is vikalpa (thought-construct) acts as a barrier and does not allow us to have a view of the Reality shining within ourselves. It is only when there is laya or dissolution of vikalpa that the screen that hides the essential Reality, the essential Divine Self from our-selves is removed and we have a view of that Reality which has"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"xl always been scintillating within in all its glory. That Reality is not something to be achieved, but uncovered. But the crux of the problem is how to make the vikalpaful mind retire. Abhinava-gupta says, \"When there is vikalpa, neither accept, nor reject, it will retire of itself and you will find yourself to be what you are.\" This is an artless art. It is effortless, spontaneous. This Sambhava upaya is, in one sense, the simplest, in another, the most difficult. It is simplest, because no particular effort or discipline is needed for it. It is most difficult, because vikalpa-making is the habit, the very life of citta or mind. In attempting to be vikalpa-free, the mind begins to make all kinds of Vikalpa. To try to become vikalpa-or thought-free is like trying to jump out of our own skin. It is given to very few mortals to be vikalpa-free. The second section, therefore, recommends another upaya, viz., Saktopaya. The last i.e. the 22nd sutra of the first section serves as a propaedeutic to the second section. It has three important words, viz., mahahrada, anusandhana and mantravir-yanubhavah. Mahahrada denotes mahasakti, anusandhana means close (mental) examination with a view to union, mantraviryanubhavah. means experience of the virility of mantra. One has to resort to mahasakti mentally in order to have an experience of the potency of mantra that will prove to be his saviour. In Sambhava upaya, one has to resort to Siva or Sambhu as prakasa. That is why it is called Sambhavopaya. In Saktopaya, one has to resort to cit-iakti or Vimarsa-sakti (the Divine I-consciousness) for realization. Therefore, this is called Saktopaya. Saktopaya is also known as Sakta yoga, jnanopaya, jnanayoga, bhavanopaya, mantroadya. It is not possible for most people to become vikalpafree. Is there no way out for them? There is, says Saktopaya. Catch hold of one suddha vikalpa. That will prove to be a veritable boat by which we can cross the turbulent waters of phenomenal existence and safely land on the certain ground of our noumenal Reality. In the following passages, Abhinavagupta clearly explains the nature of asuddha and suddha vikalpa. Regarding asuddha vikalpa, he says:"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"xli (Tantrasara, p. 21) \"People consider themselves bound on account of (asuddha) vikalpa. This wrong conception of theirs about themselves becomes the cause of their being bound in transmigratory existence. Therefore when an opposite vikalpa arises, it dispels the vikalpa that is the cause of transmigratory existence and thus becomes the cause of their elevation.\" Asuddha (vitiated, wrong) vikalpas are those ideas and beliefs on account of which one considers his psycho-physical organism, his mind-body complex to be the Self. \"I am thin, weak, ignorant etc.\" are examples of asuddha vikalpas. Asuddha vikalpa means the idea about the usual, psychological, empirical self. What then is suddha vikalpa (correct mental attitude and belief)? This is what Abhinavagupta has to say about it. (Tantrasara, p. 21) \"That which is unlimited consciousness transcending all limited expressions of Reality from earth right up to Siva, that alone is the highest Reality; that am I. Therefore I am both trans-cendent to and immanent in the universe.\" The suddha vikalpa is the idea and belief that I am the met-empirical, transcendental Self; that the universe is an expression of my power, etc. The practice of this suddha vikalpa is Saktopaya, A question that arises here is \"Can the highest Reality or parama Siva be ever brought within the range of vikalpa? If one enters it (the highest Reality) by means of vikalpa, however well-refined and purified, that would mean that the highest Reality can be brought within the province of thought. If not, what is the utility of even this suddha vikalpa? With regard to the first question, Saiva philosophy says cate-gorically that the highest Reality cannot be brought within the province of vikalpa. Says Abhinavagupta:"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"xlii (Tantrasara, p. 23) \"The highest reality is everywhere and in every way Self-luminous. Vikalpa can neither help nor hinder it.\" In fact the highest reality cannot be brought under any practice or dis-cipline. (Tantrasara, p. 24) \"No discipline or practice can be possible with regard to the highest Realuy or Siva that is also one's essential nature. Nothing can be added to or removed from the highest Reality; of what avail can practice be here'.?\" What then is the utility even of suddha vikalpa? The utility of suddha vikalpa is in removing the sense of duality. What is this sense of duality? Abhinavagupta says, (Tantrasara p. 24)\" The sense of duality is nothing else. It is only the ignorance of one's essential nature. Therefore, this sense of duality is annulled by suddha vikalpa. This is the nega-tive function of suddha vikalpa. There is also a positiye function of Suddha vikalpa. It works in three ways (1) by mantra-sakti (2) by sat-tarka leading to bhavana and finally by (3) suddha vidya. These are distinct but not different. All these are inter-connected. We may consider each of these separately for the convenience of expo-sition. 1. Mantra-Sakti: As has already been said the last sutra of the first section leads to Saktopaya. In the introductory portion to the first sutra of the second section, Ksemaraja says: Sakti signifies the expansion of the potency of mantra. Therefore the nature of mantra is being examined first.\" So the first sutra of Saktopaya is Cittam mantrah. Cittam in this sutra does not mean any and every mind. In this context, cittam"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"xliii means the mind that is seriously bent on reflecting over and finding out the highest reality. That which ponders over the highest Reality is cittam. And what is mantra? The word mantra consists of two syllables - man and tra. The syllable man means to reflect, to be aware; the syllable tra means that which saves. \"Mantra means that mental awareness by which one feels one's identity with the highest Reality enshrined in a mantra and thus saves oneself from a sense of separateness and difference charac-teristic of the world.\" It has already been said that saktopaya is that in which consciousness as sakti or power is the guiding principle. Sakti assumes the form of mantra or mystic syllable or syllables. The mind of the aspirant is so intensely identified with the deity of the mantra that it becomes that mantra itself. Citta in this context means the condensed aspect of Self as consciousness. In the first sutra of the first section Self was described as pure universal consciousness having svatantrya sakti and jnana and kriya as its characteristics. Here citta is that condensed aspect of Self in which mantra is realized. Every mantra consists of certain syllables. Muttering of the syllables mechanically is of no avail. The aspirant must identify himself with the deity invoked in the mantra. Purnahanta or the full I-consciousness of Siva which is His Vimarsa sakti - the creative pulsation of the Divine is the source of all the mantras. Every mantra leads back to that divine I-consciousness which is the creative sakti of the Supreme. That I-consciousness is no speech, but the source of all speech and thought and objectivity. Suddha vikalpa means pondering over that full, divine I-cons-ciousness as our real Self. Since that I-consciousness is the Sakti of Siva, pondering over that sakti is saktopaya which brings about the absorption of the individual self in the divine Self of Siva. This is why Malimvijaya gives the following definition of Saktopaya."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"XLIV \"When an aspirant with one-pointedness of mind, apprehends that Reality which is not within the range of utterance (gross or subtle), and thus obtains samavesa (absorption in divine cons-ciousness), then that samavesa is known as sakta. (i.e. obtained through sakti).\" What is that uccara-rahitam vastu, the Reality Which is not within the range of utterance? It is paravak also known as parasakti, parahanta, vimarsa-sakti, purnaham-vimarsatmika-samvit-sakti, matrka etc. It is the I-consciousness of the Divine which is above all thought and speech, which is the primal crea-tive pulsation that brings the universe into being, the origin of all words and objects and yet above words. In the order of manifestation the next stage after paravak is that of pasyantl. At this stage, word and object are an undivided, indistinguish-able whole. The next stage is that of madhyama. Though the division between word and object has started, at this stage it is not pronounced yet. It is implicit. The division is only at the level of thought. This is an intermediate stage between pas-yanti and vaikhari. There is a sort of subtle speech only at this level. It has not taken shape into words yet. At the Vaikhari stage, there is gross speech, The word and the object are completely divided. The word vikhara means body. So vaikhari is the stage when the bodily organs are employed in utterance. Thus there are three stages in the manifestation of the universe para, suksma and sthula, higher, subtle, and gross. The paravak or the I-consciousness of the Supreme is the raison d'etre of all the mantras. As Tantrasadbhava puts it: She who is considered to be imperishable sakti is the soul of all the mantras. Without her, O fair one, all the mantras are as useless as autumnal clouds.\" This imperishable Sakti is the sakti of the supreme I-consciousness. This idea is further re-inforced by the third sutra of this section. which means \"the luminous being of the perfect I-consciousness inherent in the multitude of words whose essence consists in the knowledge of the highest non-dualism is the secret of the mantras\"."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"xlv Mantras consist of letters. These letters are not meaningless jargon. They are symbols of the creative saktis of the Divine. These saktis inherent in the letters are collectively known as Matrka. This Matrka is the secret of all the mantras. As has been said in Tantrasadbhava: \"O dear one, mantras consist of letters. These are a form of sakti. Sakti as such should be known as Matrka and Matrka should be known as the nature of Siva\". The same book says further on: \"O goddess, the universe right from Brahma down to earth is pervaded by Matrka who is full of the lustre of parahanta - the I-consciousness of the Supreme\". This parahanta or I-conscious-ness is the creative power of Parama Siva. Parahanta is also known as parasakti or paravak or para or mahamatrka or simply matrka. In order to acquire mantra-sakti, one has to approach a guru or spiritual director who imparts a mantra with his grace and instils caitanya sakti or power of consciousness into it, and teaches him the mystery of Matrka. As has already been said Matrka means the collective whole of all letters and also the I-consciousness which is the fons et origo of all letters and thus of the entire universe of subjects and objects. The word for 'I' in Sanskrit is (aham). 'A' and 'ha' between themselves include all the letters of the Sanskrit language. As each one of these letters is symbolic of the creation of either an objective or subjective element, this means that aham or consciousness of Parama Siva is creative of the entire universe of subjects and objects. Sutra seven of this section says that the disciple gets enlightenment from the guru regarding Matrka. The translation of this sutra together with the detailed note on it should be carefully read in order to understand the creativity of Matrka. The I-consciousness of the Supreme holds within itself the entire universe in an ideal state. As Ksemaraja puts it in Pratyabhijnahrdayam:"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"xlvi (pp. 108-190) Therefore the extended universe beginning with the letter 'a' which is of the nature of the body of anuttara or the highest Reality and upto the letter 'ha' ) indicative of the expansion of Sakti, flashing forth by virtue of the combination of 'a' and 'ha' and being accepted inwardly in the manner of pratyahara rests in the Highest Reality in the form of bindu indicative of the consciousness of non-differentiation. Thus this natural vimarsa or I-consciousness is of the nature of the congregation of words.\" 'A' represents prakasa or Siva; 'ha' represents vimarsa or Sakti; the bindu or dot on 'ha' represents the fact that though Siva is manifested right up to the earth through Sakti, he is not divided thereby; he remains integrally the same. Matrka when unknown or unrealized leads to all kinds of worldly experience. When she is realized, she leads to libera-tion. When the aspirant through suddha vikalpa reflects over a mantra and feels his identity with Siva, the Matrka which is the mantra-sakti inherent in the mantra transforms the citta or mind of the aspirant; his suddha vikalpa which was only an ideation is dissolved; his citta is transformed into citi (divine consciousness); he now feels the throb of the true I-consciousness of the Supreme, and he realizes that the entire universe is only a proliferation of Matrka sakti or the divine I-consciousness. This aspect of I-consciousness which reveals the universe as only an expression of the Self is brought about finally by unmana or unmani sakti which is the highest development of the mantra sakti inherent in Matrka. Unmana is also known as para vidya, the highest gnosis. Ksemaraja refers to it in sutra 21 of the first section where it has been called suddha vidya and sutra 5 of the second section where it has been called khecari Sivavastha. 2. Sat-tarka helps the aspirant in his onward march. The aspirant learns from a great guru or from the agama (the tradi-tional text-book of the system) that his essential Self is Siva"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"xlvii and not the physico-bio. psychical complex. Abhinvagupta says: (Tantrasara p. 3) \"The function of the agama is to awaken in the mind suddha vikalpa i.e. pure and correct thought about Self.\" Regarding sat-tarka, he says, (ibid, p. 23) \"Sat-tarka is the reflection that re-inforces continuity of ideas similar to the suddha vikalpa. This leads to bhavana. Bhavana is a word well-nigh untranslatable in English. 'Creative contemplation' is the best word for bhavana.\"' It is a power of spiritual attention. Abhinavagupta defines bhavana in the following words (ibjd, p.23) \"Bhavana is that contemplation by which a thing which though real and existent appeared as non-existent and unreal previously owing to obscurity reappears as manifest reality by sheer clarity\". Constructive imagination plays an important role in bhavana. It is a sort of auto-suggestion which sinks into the unconscious and fishes out surprizing reality from its mysterious depth. It leads to (3) Suddha vidya which slowly and gradually makes manifest the light of I-consciousness. Through the influence of suddha vidya, jneya, the knowable appears as a form of jnana or knowledge. Then the jnana terminates in the jnata, the knower. Finally this is displaced by the transcendental I-consciousness in which the distinction between the jnata, jnana and jneya totally disappears. There is another saktopaya by spanda principle. By means of this, vikalpas or thoughts can be liquidated if one can develop the art of grasping mentally the spanda or dynamic reality which reveals itself in the interval of two thoughts. This revelation is known as unmesa. The total life of the aspirant who has received full enlighten-ment about matrka-cakra is changed. He is oriented God-ward. His whole life becomes yoga. His formal rituals are changed into spiritual practices. Sutra 8 of this section says that instead of pouring oblation of clarified butter, barley etc. into fire, he pours his thought of the gross and subtle bodies as the self into the fires of cit. (universal consciousness) by means of bhavana. Sutra 9 says that instead of rice, wheat etc. being his food,"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"xlviii his thought of the essential Self becomes the food that nourishes and satisfies him. Abhinavagupta adds a few more examples of this kind. \"All objects actually abide in God\" - with this purifying thought such an aspirant offers everything unto God by bhavana. This is his yaga or sacrifice. \"The perfect, infinite God is my real Self\" - constant repetition of this idea is his japa. Viewing objects like the body, jar etc. as simply an aspect of God is his vrata (vowed observance). The quest of the Divine that is not an object of thought is his yoga. The main Sakta-upaya, however, consists in mantra sakti which is inherent in Matrka and arises out of the contemplation of the Divine I-consciousness. A door gently swings open; a force arises from within which embraces our so-called 'I' to death. The limited 'I' dies to live in the universal 'I'. SECTION III Anavopaya The third section of the Siva-sutras deals with anavopaya. The word upaya connotes 'means of approach'. In Sambha-vopaya, the means of approach to the Divine is, if it can be called means at all, alert passivity or choiceless awareness. In this, there is no object or support on which the citta is to be steadied or fixed. Rather, the citta has to withdraw, to cease playing an active role. Therefore, this is also known as nira-lamba yoga (supportless yoga). In Saktopaya, citta is the means of approach to the Divine. Here again the citta is not fixed or steadied on any object; there is no concentration or meditation on any thing. In this, the citta is used for seeking the source of its being, for seriously thinking out what exactly is meant by 'I' or Self. It is used to understand the deeper significance of mantra and the supreme I-consciousness which is the source of all mantras. By constantly dwelling on the significance of the real 'I', the citta gets sancti-fied and is ultimately transformed by the Sakti of the mantra and the aspirant has thus pratibha jnana or intuitive realization of the real divine Self. The Citta is lifted up by bhavana and suddha vidya, and as pointed out above, is ultimately trans-"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"xlix formed. It should be borne in mind that Saktopaya is also not possible for every individual. It is meant for those whose citta is already oriented spiritually. As Ksemaraja says in his com-mentary on the first sutra of the second section cetyate vimrs-yate anena param tattvam iti cittam - Citta (in this context) is that which earnestly seeks to apprehend the highest Reality. Sakta-yoga is a process of self-inquiry. Of modern yogis, Ramana Maharsi may be said to have set the best example of Sakta yoga. The alambana or support of the citta in Sakta yoga is the essential Self. In anavopaya, the case is different. Here anu, the limited, conditioned individual takes up same limited aspect as buddhi, prana, body, some object in space from which he starts his yogic practice. In Sambhavopaya, the first sutra is caitanyam atma. It is the universal consciousness characterized by absolute freedom, jnana (knowledge) and kriya (activity) which is the Self. In Saktopaya, the first sutra is cittam mantrah. It is the spiri-tually oriented citta which by mantra sakti realizes the essential divine Self. In anavopaya, the first sutra is cittam atma. In this, it is the citta (the complex of buddhi, ahatmkara and manas) that moves about from one form of existence to another which is the atma (atati-sawcarati iti atma - that which moves about is atma). Here the word atma is used in the sense of the psy-chological complex that is mostly considered to be the Self. This psychological or empirical self is known as anu. It is be-cause this yoga starts from the standpoint of anu or the limited psychological, empirical self that it is called anava yoga. In this, the citta has to fix itself on something different from the essential Self. Therefore, it is called bhedopaya i.e. a technique of approach by means of something different from the essential Self. In Saktopaya, it is jnana which is most predominant. In anavopaya, it is kriya (activity) which is most predominant. Even meditation which this technique uses is also kriya (manasi kriya). It also uses kriya (activity) in a grosser form, e.g. repetition of a mantra, worship of a chosen deity, an idol etc. Therefore, this is called Kriyopaya. It should be carefully borne in mind that the three upayas are not water-tight compartments. Anavopaya has to lead"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"l to saktopaya and finally to sambhavopaya. The realization of sambhavopaya is the highest, and that is the goal of all the upayas. One upaya passes into another. Even when something different from Self is worshipped as an aspect or expression of the divine, it finally terminates into Saktopaya. The practice of saktopaya in which I-consciousness is considered to be the fons et origo of everything terminates in sambhavopaya in which the I-consciousness is not simply an expression of Siva but is also inclusive of the. universe, which is simply an expansion of His Sakti. That is why the Siva-Sutras in describing each upaya or technique do not confine themselves solely to that upaya but also refer to other upayas as aids. Special Features of Anavopaya: Malinivijaya thus describes anavopaya: \"A perfect absorption into the essential divine Self that is achieved through uccara, karana, dhyana, varna, and sthana-kalpana is known as anava.\" As said above, the support of the citta of the aspirant following anavopaya is something different from his essential divine Self. Either it is his (1) buddhi (2) gross prana (3) subtle prana known as varna (4) the body and the disposition of its organs in parti-cular ways, known as karana (5) some external object known as sthana-kalpana. Malinivijaya has summed these up in the above verse. We shall now take these up in detail. 1: Dhyana: Abhinavagupta says in his Tantrasara (p. 36) that in this, the aspirant should meditate on the pramata (knower or subject), pramana (knowledge) and prameya (known or object) in a unified way (devoid of these distinctions). In consequence, the fire of the deeper, inner consciousness will be sharply lit up. Then grasping all external objects through the collective whole of the powers (saktis) moving out through his sense-organs, he should, by bhavana, pour them into the fire of inner consciousness that has already been lit up. Then the difference between the inner and outer, between consciousness and its object will disappear"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Ii and there will be unity-consciousness. Thus one will have anava samavesa in the divine. Another way of dhyana (meditation) has been described in Sutra 4 of the third section of Siva-Sutras. The tattvas from earth right up to Siva should be considered by bhavana to be dissolved in the gross, then in the subtle, and finally in the causal body by the aspirant. This is known as layabhavana. Or one should think that Kalagni Rudra is arising from the toe of the right foot and burning the whole body. This is known as dahabhavana. This is really a kind of Sakta technique. By these means, the citta (mind) of the aspirant acquires samavesa or absorption into the divine consciousness. The exposition of the 4th sutra should be read for details. 2. Uccara: Uccara is connected with prana which means life-energy or bioplasma. Its main characteristic is uccara which means 'rising upward and appearing as sound'. The word prana is used in two senses - general or subtle and specific. In general sense, it is simply known as pranana. In the specific sense it acquires different names as prana, apana, samana, udana, vyana according to the various functions of the prana sakti. The characteristic of the specific pranas is uccara. The subtle prana is characterized as varna which will be considered separately. The technique of uccara is concerned with prana-dharana or fixing the attention on the various aspects of prana in the specific sense. Various kinds of ananda or delight are experienced by fixing the attention on the various pranas. When the mind rests only on the pramata or the subject of experience, then the ananda expe-rienced is known as (1) nijananda. When the mind contemplates over the absence of all objects of experience, then the delight experienced is known as (2) nirananda. When there is contem-plation on prana and apana jointly, then the delight experienced is known as (3) parananda. When the mind rests on samana which unifies the various objects of experience, then the delight experienced is known as (4) brahmananda. When the mind of the aspirant rests on udana after dissolving all knowledge and objects of knowledge in the Self, then the delight experienced is"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"lii known as (5) mahananda. When the mind rests on vyana, then the ananda experienced is known as (6) cidananda. After the experience of these six kinds of ananda, when the as-pirant realizes his prana-sakti in its fulness, he has the experience of (7) jagadananda in which there is no division or limitation, for it flashes forth all round, in which it is consciousness alone which expresses itself as knower, means of knowledge or known, which expands by the nectar of divine joy of absolute sovereignty, in which there is no need for contemplation. This entire practice is briefly known as uccara yoga or prana yoga. When it is fully developed, the following characteristics appear as a consequence: (1) Experience of delight (2) Udbhava -a kind of inner leap (3) Kampa or tremour (4) Nidra in which the aspirant is asleep to all outward objects (5) Ghurni or reeling with delight. It will be seen that this prana yoga is entirely different from pranayama which is only an exercise of breath control. 3. Varna: It has already been mentioned that the word prana is used in two senses, viz., (1) general or subtle (2) specific. We have seen that uccara is the natural characteristic of prana. We have also seen how anava yoga is practised by fixing the mind on the various specific pranas. We have now to see what anava yoga is to be practised in connexion with the uccara of the general prana. Abhinavagupta says: (Tantraloka V. 131) From the uccara of this general prana, there vibrates an imperceptible, inarticulate sound which is known as varna.\" This goes on naturally and continuously in every living creature. Svacchanda Tantra says: \"No one sounds it voluntarily, nor can any one prevent its"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"liii being sounded. The deity abiding in the heart of living creatures sounds it himself.\" Abhinavagupta says about it : (Tan. 61216) \"There is one varna in the form of nada in which lie all the varnas (letters) latently in an undivided form. As it is ceaseless, it is called anahata, i.e. unstruck, natural, uncaused. Jayaratha's commentary on this runs as follows: \"In this imperceptible, inarticulate anahata nada, all the varnas (letters) lie latently in an undivided way. As all the varnas (letters) originate from this nada, therefore, is it called varna proleptically.\" The anusandhana or intensive awareness of this nada is called varna yoga or dhvani yoga. It is a very ancient form of yoga. Sankaracarya in his yoga-taravall calls it nadanusandhana. It goes by this name in some of the tantras and in the yoga tradition of Gorakhanatha. Among the mediaeval saints of north India, such as Kabir and others, it is called surati-sabda yoga. In Radhasvaml sect also, it is known as surati-sabda yoga. How are we to know about this nadatmaka varna? Abhi-navagupta points out in the following verse how we can form an idea of it. (Tantr. V, 132) The srsti bija and the samhara bija are its main forms. Jayaratha explains the main forms in the following words. The srsti bija and samhara bija are the main spots of its revelation. What is meant by srsti bija and samhara bija? Sa is srsti bija or the mystic letter denoting expiration and ha is samhara bija or the mystic letter denoting inspiration. In the following verse, quoted by Ksemaraja in his com-mentary on the 27th sutra of the third section is given the process by which this nada expresses itself in the breath of every living creature:"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"liv \"The breath is exhaled with the sound sa and inhaled with the sound ha. Therefore the empirical individual always repeats the mantra hamsah. Throughout the day and night, he repeats this mantra 21,600 times, Such a japa (repetition of the mantra) of the goddess (Gayatri) has been prescribed which is quite easy for the wise, and difficult for the ignorant.\" The mantra hamsah is repeated by every jiva (living being) automatically in every round of expiration-inspiration. Normally it is repeated 21,600 times a day. Since the outgoing and in-coming breaths repeat this naturally, automatically without any effort on any body's part, it is known as ajapa-japa i.e. a repeti-tion of the mantra that is going on naturally without any body's repeating it. Since the sounds of expiration and inspiration resemble ham and sah, therefore it is called hamsa mantra. It is also known as ajapa gayatri. By anusandhana or mental observation or awareness of this automatic process, prana (exhalation) and apana (inhalation) become equilibrated and then the dormant kundalini that lies in three and a half folds at the base of the spine rises upwards. At that time, a number of pleasant sounds is heard. But the aspirant should not dwell on these sounds. He should neglect these and dwell on the para nada which is anahata nada in the strictest sense of the word. By dwelling on this nada, the citia gets dissolved and then one can have the experience of visuddha caitanya - the highest aspect of consciousness. The awakened Kundalini pierces the brahmagranthi. Then she pierces the muladhara cakra. Rising further, she pierces the svadhisthana and manipura cakras. Then she pierces the visnugranthi and the anahata and visuddha cakras. Now she pierces the rudragranthi and then ajnacakra, and finally enters the sahasrara. The aspirant can now experience the ambrosia raining down from sahasrara. (Vide plates 2 and 3). The nadis and cakras are not physical constituents. They are in the pranamaya kosa, the vital sheath in the subtle body."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"KUNDALINl Plate 2"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"CAKRAS Plate 3"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"lv Only their impact is felt through the nerves and the ganglia. The cakras are the seats of vital energy. They are called cakras because they are like a wheel in appearance, They absorb and distribute prana to the pranamaya kosa and through it to the physical body. The nada is subtle in madhyama stage and finally when it rea-ches the pasyanti stage, it is no longer audible. The aspirant has now an experience of jyoti (light). All the vikalpas are now calmed and one can have the experience of purndhanta or the supreme I-consciousness. Harhsah is that manifestation of nada which is symbolic of life. The anahata nada in its inner significance is symbolic of pranava (Ova). By the intensive awareness of this pranava there arise nine stages of yoga which are subtle forms of nada, known as nine nadas. The first stage is (1) bindu which is known as ardha matra. The next stage is (2) ardha candra which is subtler than the previous. Each succeeding stage goes on getting subtler than the preceding (3) rodhini (4) nada (5) nadanta (6) sakti (7) vyapini (8) samana and (9) unmana or unmani are the other stages that follow. Unmana is the highest aspect of consciousness. Upto samana, there can be only atma-vyapti, realization of the essential Self. It is only at the stage of unmana that there can be Siva-vyapti which includes not only the realization of the metaphysical Self but also the realization of the world as an aspect of the Self. In sutra seven of the third section of the Siva-Sutras Ksemaraja refers to unmana. He says that upto samana, there is the play of maya. It is only at the stage of unmana that maya ceases completely. Another name of unmana is sahaja vidya. Ksemaraja makes the following remark: Svacchanda Tantra speaks of the achievement of Sahaja vidya which is unmana enabling one to gain Siva-consciousness after the conquest of moha (maya) which lasts till the realization of the essential Self. Ksemaraja adds that though the process of reaching the unmana stage is saktopaya, yet it has been included in anavopaya,"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"lvi because the anavopaya has to lead to saktopaya. Of this section. the sutras 15, 21, 26, 44 and 45 also refer to saktopaya. 4. Karana: We have seen how anavopaya utilizes (1) buddhi, (2) gross prana and (3) subtle prana (varna). Karana is the technique which utilizes the body (deha). By body is here meant all the bodies - gross, subtle and causal. In Karana, mudras (dis-positions of certain parts of the body in particular ways) are also utilized. There are seven varieties of karana technique, viz. (1) grahya (2) grahaka (3) cit or samvitti (4) nivesa or sannivesa (5) vyapti (6) tyaga and (7) aksepa. (Tantr. V, 129). Jayaratha in his commentary gives the main purpose of these karanas in the following words: \"Here the seven varieties of karana, viz. grahya etc. are meant to subordinate and ultimately assimilate all objective phenomena to the consciousness of the essential Self\". The first four varieties come purely under anavopaya. Assi-milating the entire world of objects first into the empirical self and then all these into samvitti or cit, the highest consciousness, and finally establishing them into the essential divine conscious-ness constitute the first four karanas. The first practice consists of assimilating grahya or all objects of perception into grahaka or the sense organs; the next practice consists of assimilating all these into cit or samvitti; the third practice consists of being completely established in cit or samvitti. Being completely established in samvitti is known as sannivesa. In sannivesa, there is no trace of the object as something extraneous. When the aspirant pervades every object with universal cons-ciousness, he is said to have achieved vyapti, Vyapti is achieved by means of bhavana. Tyaga is the stage where all effort is abandoned. The universal consciousness now abides sponta-neously. Vyapti and tyaga reach the stage of saktopaya. Aksepa means projection of the universal consciousness in the entire universe. This is the stage of sambhava yoga."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"lvii The sutras 16 and 25 also of this section refer to sambhava yoga. Sthana-kalpana: For those who cannot fix their citta even on buddhi, the inner prana or nada, there are other anavopayas which deal with the fixing of the mind on externals. These are known as sthana-kalpana. As Abhinavagupta puts it : (Tantrasara, p. 45) The external process (of anava upaya) is known as sthana-prakalpana. There are three sthanas or places on which mind can be fixed, viz., pranavayu, body, and something outside the body. The pranavayu in this context is used in a sense different from that in which it is used in connexion with uccara. In uccara, one has to fix the mind on prana, apana, samana, udana and vyana which are internal aspects of prana sakti. In sthana kalpana, one has to fix the mind on prana in the sense of exhalation and inhalation through the nose. From the centre of the body prana (exhalation) covers a distance of twelve fingers in the outer space and again from that point apana (inhalation) covers the same distance up to the centre. These two points or places are known as external dvadasanta and internal dvadasanta. By the practice of fixing the mind on these two points, the vikalpas of the mind begin to dissolve, and finally one has anava samavesa, or absorption in the essential Self through the anava technique. By body in this context is meant the gross body. The things external to the body include idol, picture etc. Those who are unable to fix the mind even on prana may fix it on these external things. As has been said above, the ultimate goal is the attainment of Siva-consciousness which includes the world as its aspect. Anava yoga has to lead to sakta yoga and sakta yoga has to lead finally to sambhava yoga."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"A SUMMARY OF THE CONTENTS OF THE SUTRAS I SECTION: SAMBHAVOPAYA Sutras 1. Characteristic of Atman; Atma is foundational conscious-ness characterized by absolute freedom of knowledge and action. 2. The bondage of the empirical individual is due to an innate limiting condition, known as anavamala which, in fact, is the ignorance of our essential nature. 3. There are two other limiting conditions, viz., Mayiya and karma mala which contribute to the bondage of the indivi-dual. 4. The three limiting conditions are a kind of limited, vitiated knowledge rooted in words which have a tremendous in-fluence on our lives. These words are formed of letters known as Matrka. The Matrka, therefore, forms the basis of all limited knowledge. 5. Sambhava-upaya or emergence of the Bhairava or transcen-dental consciousness shatters the shackles of ignorance and sets the individual free. 6. When Bhairava-consciousness arises, the entire universe appears as an expression of Siva's Sakti and when the mind of the aspirant is united with that Sakti with intensive aware-ness, the world as something separate from consciousness disappears. The sixth sutra shows both the effect of Sambhava consciousness and a re-inforcement of that consciousness by Saktopaya. 7. When through grace there is the emergence of Bhairava-consciousness and through Sakti-Sandhana, it is re-inforced then the rapturous delight of the fourth or transcendental consciousness becomes a constant feature even of the three states of waking, dream and profound sleep. It is not only in meditation but also in the usual, normal course of"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Iix life that one experiences the delight of the transcendental consciousness. 8. Waking state consists of knowledge gained by the external senses and common to all subjects. 9. The dream state consists of experience generated only by the mind in the form of fancies and reveries which are con-fined only to the dreamer. 10. Deep sleep is a state of complete unawareness. It is a state of delusion brought about by Maya. All the above three states may be considered both from the point of view of the common man and the yogi. 11. One who experiences the delight of Supreme I-consciousness in all the states of consciousness becomes the master of his senses. 12. Such a yogi, in his ascent to the Highest Reality passes through many stations of experience which are full of pleasant surprises. 13. The Iccha or Will of a Yogi who has realized Bhairava-consciousness is Svatantrya-Sakti (Absolute Will power of Siva) that can manifest and withdraw the world. 14. To such a Yogi, all that is observed as an object - whether externally or internally, is an expression of consciousness. 15. Such experience is possible by the absorption of the indi-vidual mind into the Universal Consciousness which is the centre and foundation of all reality. 16. When one is mentally united with the pure Siva-principle, he becomes, like Sadasiva, completely free from the limita-tions of the empirical individual. 17. Full conviction of one's identity with Siva is what is meant by knowledge of Self. 18. In every bit of knowledge, the Yogi feels the delight of I-consciousness. There is the transmission of this delight among those who come in contact with him. 19. Being united with Iccha-Sakti (the Divine Will power) the Yogi can create any kind of body that he desires. 20. By uniting his consciousness with Sakti, the yogi can acquire the power of joining together components in a whole or separating components or joining together events, etc. far removed in space and time."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"Ix 21. Being united with Iccha Sakti, when the Yogi desires to acquire universal consciousness, he gets established in Suddha vidya, i.e. unmana sakti, and feels as if he is the lord of the whole universe. 22. The Highest Sakti (Para Sakti) is, on account of its depth, transparency etc, like a lake. When an aspirant is united with it, i.e., when he is constantly aware of his identity with it, he has an experience of the potency of the great mantra. Having an experience of it means the feeling of the throb of the supreme I-consciousness as his own inmost Self. This I-consciousness is the generative source of all the mantras i.e., all mantras derive their power from it. II SECTION SAKTOPAYA Sutras 1. When the mind broods constantly over the mantra of the Highest Reality i.e., over the Supreme-I consciousness, it gets identified with it. Thus the mind itself becomes the mantra. There is no longer any difference between the practiser of the mantra and the mantra itself. Saktopaya is the technique of jnana. By constant awareness of the .jnana of the real I-consciousness, the mind (Cittam) of the aspirant is transformed into that Supreme I-consciousness itself. Thus he has full realization. 2. It is zealous, spontaneous effort on the part of the aspirant that brings about the communion of his mind with the deity inherent in the mantra. 3. Vidyasarlra is a compound word, meaning sabda-rasi - a mul-titude of words or mantra. The satta or luminous being of the multitude of words consists in supreme I-consciousness which is non-different from the world. So the secret of all mantras is the communion of the individual mind with the Supreme divine I-consciousness that includes within itself the universe. If the aspirant's mind is satisfied with mayic limited powers, he has fallen from the high ideal of mantra, for these mayic limited powers are only a form"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"lxi of common inferior knowledge and are illusory like a dream. The ideal of mantra and therefore of Saktopaya is not the acquisition of inferior power, but rather of the Supreme I-consciousness of Siva - a consciousness which includes the universe within itself. 5. On the emergence of spontaneous Supreme knowledge, the aspirant acquires Khecari Mudra which is the state of Siva. 6. Guru is a help in attaining the potency of mudra and mantra, for he expounds the means to the goal. Or the divine grace acts as a guru in affording a favourable opportunity (in acquiring the potency of mantra). 7. All words (vdcaka) and objects (vacya) are the outcome of words which consist of letters (matrka). The collective whole of Matrka arises in the last analysis from the Supreme I-consciousness of Siva. This is the secret of Mdtrka-cakra. Knowing that this Supreme I-consciousness is our real Self, one is liberated. 8. All the bodies, gross, subtle etc. which were previously identified with faked I-consciousness are now thrown into the fire of real I-consciousness as oblation. 9. If jnana is interpreted as limited knowledge, then the sutra would mean 'limited knowledge is annam i.e. is devoured by the Yogi.' If jnana is interpreted as svarupa-jnana or knowledge of Self, then annam would mean food that gives satisfaction, and the whole sutra would mean \"Self-realization becomes his food i.e. fills him with the highest satisfaction.\" Bhaskara also gives the above interpretation in his varttikas. 10. On the submergence of suddha vidya, all kinds of vikalpas (thought-constructs) full of a sense of difference arise in the mind. According to Bhaskara, this sutra means to say that when the knowledge common to the ordinary folk of the world dissolves on the realization of one's real Self, the previously apprehended delusive knowledge of the objects of the world is remembered only like a dream."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"III SECTION ANAVOPAYA Sutras 1. That which is deeply affected with desire for objects of sense is citta. The constituents of citta are buddhi, ahamkara and manas. In the context of the individuals, it is this citta or the conditioned mind that is knower or atma. The citta is called atma, because by means of sattva, rajas and tamas, it moves on from one form of existence to another. (Atati iti atma, that which moves on is atma). 2. The knowledge of this anu or limited individual self is con-fined to the modes of his psychic apparatus, and his desires are associated with the pleasure of sense objects. Under their influence, he wanders about from one form of existence to another. 3. Man's bondage is due mainly to maya. Maya, in this con-text, means non-discrimination between the real Self and the pseudo-self constituted by the kancukas like kala (limited efficiency), Vidya (limited knowledge), raga (egoistic desires) etc. and subtle and gross body. 4. One should meditate on the dissolution of all the tattvas successively in their preceding source right up to Siva, i.e. of the gross body into the subtle, and of the subtle into the causal and thus realize the highest tattva, Viz., Siva. 5. By means of pranayama, pratyahara, dharana etc. one can acquire the power of dissolving prana and apana in susumna. control over the elements like earth, water etc. withdrawal of the mind from the elements, and isolation from the elements. 6. By pranayama, dharana etc. one acquires Supernormal powers over the elements, but such powers are the outcome of moha (delusion about the essential nature of the self) which draws a veil over the Highest Reality. By these means, one cannot realize the Highest Reality. 7. When there is complete conquest of maya, there is acquisition of Sahaja Vidya which makes for complete identification with Siva."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"lxiii 8. In one who is at-onement with unmana, the world appears only as a ray of his light. Dualism has completely dis-appeared in his case. 9. The essential Self is like an actor on the world-stage. He is unaffected by the parts he plays. 10. The inner self i.e. the subtle body, constitutes the stage of the actor of the world-drama. 11. The senses of the yogi are introverted and thus behold the drama of the inmost Self who delights in exhibiting the world drama. 12. Just as an actor can act out the sattva - the inner mental state only through great talent, even so the yogi can give expression to sattva (inner Light) only through the higher spiritual intelligence. 13. Such a yogi attains full freedom to know and control the whole universe. 14. As the Yogi can manifest Freedom in his own body, so can he manifest it elsewhere also. 15. The Yogi should constantly direct his attention to para sakti (the primal power of the Divine) which is the source of the universe. 16. If the Yogi is firmly established in parasakti, he will be easily steeped in the highest bliss of Self without any practice of concentration, meditation, etc. 17. Being established in Suddha vidya, the Yogi can create forms in accordance with the measure of the creative power of his consciousness. 18. SO long as Suddha vidya is emergent, there is no further birth of the yogi. 19. The yogi who has attained Sahaja Vidya (Suddha Vidya) should not become heedless. If he is not on the alert, he may be deluded by the deities presiding over letters like other ordinary folk. 20. The Yogi should take care that the fourth state permeates the three states of waking, dream and deep sleep and not only at their initial and even final stage even as oil permeates its receptacle completely. 21. Rejecting the notion of body, etc. as the Self, one should plunge into the fourth state without any thought-construct."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"lxiv 22. When the prana of the yogi who is united with the fourth, i.e. the transcendental consciousness, spreads outside, i.e. when he is actively aware of external objects, he (the yogi) experiences everything as identical with cidananda, with the bliss of Siva-consciousness. 23. In the case of the Yogi experiencing the delight of the fourth state at the initial and final stages of waking, etc. inferior states of mind may arise in the intervening stage. He should, therefore, be on guard and see to it that the interven-ing stages are also permeated by the transcendental cons-ciousness. 24. When the Yogi joins his real I-consciousness to everything, i.e. when everything appears to him as the expression of Siva, then the transcendental consciousness which had been obscured is revived. 25. When by the continuous practice of the turya state (the fourth state) the Yogi attains the turyatlta state, he becomes similar to Siva. 26. Remaining in the body till the prarabdha karma is exhausted is all the pious act (vrata) that such a yogi observes. 27. Since the I-consciousness of the Yogi is the awareness of the pure, spiritual I, every speech of the yogi amounts to a japa of the divine I. 28. He disseminates knowledge of Self all round. This is his danam or gift. 29. Such a Yogi acquiring mastery over the sakti-cakra that controls the limited empirical individuals is alone competent to enlighten others regarding Reality. 30. Because this Yogi is similar to Siva, so the universe is the unfoldment of his consciousness-power just as it is the expression of the Sakti of Siva. 31. The maintenance and reabsorption of the universe are also an unfoldment of his consciousness-power. 32. Even when there is change in the objective appearance, there is no change in the subject of experiences, for even the experience of change requires an experient. 33. Such a yogi considers pleasure and pain as something ex-ternal like blue jar, etc., not as an aspect of his I-conscious-ness. So he is not affected by them."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"lxv 34. The Yogi that is untouched by any trace of pleasure and pain is known as Kevaii i.e. one who is a knower only as pure consciousness. 35. When, however, an aspirant is under the influence of primal ignorance and does not know his real Self, he is subject to karma and is thus bound to samsara. 36. When the Yogi discards all difference due to the identifica-tion of Self with body, prana etc. and there emerges in him the realization of Self as pure consciousness, he can create another form of world according to his desire. 37. The Yogi's power of creativity can be inferred from one's own experience of imaginative creation in dream, etc. 38. In all the three states of waking, dreaming, and deep sleep, one should enliven oneself with the creative bliss of the transcendental consciousness which is the primal condition of all the three states. 39. Just as the internal mental states should be vitalized with the bliss of the fourth or transcendental consciousness, even so the external objects also should be vitalized with the bliss of the transcendental consciousness. 40. Those ordinary empirical individuals whose Self is not iden-tified with the fourth or transcendental consciousness but is rather identified with the subtle and gross bodies, are, on account of anavamala, prompted by desire for various objects. They are extroverted and carried from one form of existence to another. 41. Of the yogi, however, who is established in the fourth or transcendental consciousness, all egoistic desires disappear and then ends his state of a limited empirical individual tied down to the subtle and gross bodies and he now becomes a citpramata, a knower as pure consciousness. 42. With the disappearance of desire, his life of a limited, empi-rical individual identified with his subtle body comes to an end. He retains the gross body only as an outer covering with which he is not identified in the least. Being completely possessed of the divine I-consciousness he is now like Siva. 43. Even after Self-realization, the yogi has to retain his gross body, because the body is linked with prana, the universal Life Force which is generated from Svatantrya Sakti - the"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"lxvi Absolute Free Will of the Divine. So long as this natural link of prana with the body lasts, the Yogi cannot dispense with the body. 44. Nasika or prana-sakti flows in the right, (pingala), left (ida) and middle (susumna) nadis. The internal aspect of prana sakti is samvid (or consciousness), the madhya or the central aspect of this consciousness is the awareness of the divine, transcendental T. By constant mindfulness of this I-cons-ciousness, there is nirvyutthana samadhi in all conditions. 45. The soul that had forgotten its essential nature now recog-nizes its divine nature again. The Yogi who has realized his essential, divine nature, shedding all sense of difference, inwardly feels the universe as dissolved in Siva and out-wardly experiences it only as an expression of I-conscious-ness which is identified with Siva."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"FIRST SECTION The first verse Prayer to Samkara, the Supreme Awareness.

Siva is the highest (anuttara) Spanda (cosmic creative pulsation) of Parama Siva. This comes into being on account of ananda (supernal creative joy) that wells up (ucchalat) from Parama Siva or the Absolute.

It is the cosmic creative pulsation of the Absolute, throbbing with life, quickening to manifest. EXPOSITION This verse is a prayer to the foundational Divine Conscious-ness.

Vimarsini means a commentary based -on sound investigation and critical examination. It is not clear which Siva sutra vrttis Ksemaraja is referring to. In his introductory verse, Ksemaraja says that the interpre-tation of the sutras given by the prevalent vrttis is, at places, in-consistent inasmuch as it is opposed to the traditional teaching of the great teachers of the system (gurvamnaya- viganatah); hence he is writing a commentary on the sutras in order to dispel the wrong notion caused by the vrttis written on the Siva-sutras. Ksemaraja belonged to the tradition of Abhinavagupta who was his teacher. There is a double entendre in the word viganatah. The prefix vi in the word may mean virodhena (virodhena ganatah) i.e., as opposed to the original meaning of the sutras or it may mean visesena (visesena ganatah) i.e., with a definite, clear under-standing of the sutras.

Caitanya or consciousness is the state of one who is cetana or conscious. (The syan-suffix in) caitanya shows rela-tionship. Caitanya4, therefore, connotes absolute freedom in respect of all knowledge and activity (paripumam svatantryam).5 The great Lord, Highest Siva alone has that (absolute freedom). Others (i.e., from the sakalas or individual souls) up to anasrita-siva6 depending as they do on Highest Siva (tat paratantravrttitvat), do not have this absolute freedom. Though Highest Siva has infinite number of other attributes, such as eternity,7 all-pervasiveness, formlessness etc., yet because eternity etc. are possible elsewhere also, here it is intended to show the predominance of absolute freedom which is not possible in any other being. Thus his (highest Siva's) characteristic has been indicated in the form of an abstract noun, viz., caitanya (the state of being conscious) by excluding other attributes (inasmuch as an abstract noun excludes all other attributes). Therefore this (i.e., caitanya or consciousness which is Absolute Freedom) is Atma or Self, not anything else of varied nature as assumed by pluralists (those who propound the doctrine of bheda or difference among Selves) (Are these different Selves conscious beings or non-conscious beings?) If Atma or varied nature is assumed to be non-conscious, then it would be incons-cient matter and thus not Self. If it be considered to be of the very essence of consciousness, then there can be no valid reason for considering one atman or Self as different from another Self. Difference in the case of cit or consciousness cannot be estab-lished either by means of space or time or form, for if these (space, time and form) are different from cit or consciousness, then being deprived of the light of consciousness, they cannot appear at all and thus are unreal; if they appear, then they are consciousness itself (for it is only consciousness that can appear). Thus it is not possible to attribute difference to consciousness (i.e., Self) on the basis of difference in space, time and form. As it is now clear that Selves are only consciousness (and nothing else), then difference8 in the nature of the various selves cannot be established (since consciousness is the only nature of all"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"8    Siva Sutram Selves, therefore they are the same); nor can difference be main-tained on account of their contact with ma/a9 or limiting condi-tion, since the limiting condition is not something outside cons-ciousness as will be explained in the sequel. Even though mala-or limiting condition may exist before (liberation), (it will be ad-mitted on all hands that) it ceases to exist in the state of libera-tions. It is, therefore, impossible to maintain the theory of the plurality of Self. If it be maintained (that even in the state of liberation), there is a possibility of the residual traces of the limiting condition remaining behind or one is even then far below the beginningless Siva, (anadi Siva)10 then those (so-called) liberated souls would still be in the state of transmigratory exist-ence (and not really liberated). As has been said, \"Conscious-ness (as consciousness) is only one Self\". Thus is indicated the invalidity of the theory of plurality of Self. NOTES 1. Sutra: Lit., 'thread', hence, it has come to mean that which like a thread holds together certain ideas, a rule, a for-mula, Cf. Latin, sutura, English suture. A sutra must contain the fewest possible words, must be free from ambiguity, must be meaningful and comprehensive, must not contain useless words and pauses and must be faultless. 2. The word 'atma' in the sutra means both Self and svabhava or nature of Reality. Hence the sutra is interpreted in two ways - (1) Being-Awareness (Sat-cit) is Self. (2) Being-Awareness is the nature of Reality i.e., Reality is nothing but Awareness. There is no word for caitanya in English. The word 'cons-ciousness' has a relational colour, (of subject-object duality), but caitanya is non-relational. Perhaps the word awareness or Being-Awareness may be better. With this caution, the word 'consciousness' may be used. Our discursive mind, inse-parable from the conditioned, relational state cannot conceive of mere caitanya - a self, without a predicate relation between it and its attribute or nature, but all the major systems of Indian Philosophy maintain that the Self is pure awareness, non-rela-tional (i.e. without subject-object relation) and without a predi-cate relation in its essential form. 3. Acctitasya: means aprakasitasya (not appearing by the light which is consciousness). Prakasa in Indian Philosophy"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"1.1.     9     is a most significant word which is not translatable into English, The word prakasa 'means 'light', but it is not in the sense of physical light in which this word is used in Indian Philosophy. Prakasa is the light of consciousness by which even physical light is visible. Hence wherever there is any appearance, there is prakasa or presence of consciousness. Without prakasa or light of consciousness, nothing can appear, just as without phy-sical light, nothing is visible. Every appearance is nothing but expression of consciousness. Cf. Katha Upanisad, II 2, 15. \"Consciousness is the supreme light. No physical light such as the sun, moon or stars or lightning shines there, to say nothing of fire. Consciousness is its own light. It shining, everything else shines in its wake. It is by its light alone that every thing else appears.\" Every appearance bespeaks consciousness. 4. Caitanya: This is grammatically formed from cetana (conscious being) by the taddhita affix 'syan' which indicates sambandha or relationship. Caitanya, therefore, means the state of consciousness and being formed by a taddhita affix points out its relationship to one who has absolute freedom of all knowledge and activity. That is why Ksemaraja qualifies caitanyam with the expression sarvajnanakriyasambandha-mayam, and adds paripurnam - svatantryam ucyate i.e., caitanya indicates absolute freedom of all knowledge and activity. 5. Svatantrya: This word literally means self-dependence. It is a technical word of this system. It includes three impor-tant ideas - (1) absolute freedom to create, complete autonomy of Will, not depending on any external material or means for its activity, absolute sovereignty or lordship (aisvarya), (2) Vimarsa or ever present Self-consciousness, a Self which is all-inclusive (knower, known and means of knowing) (3) Jnana and kriya. The absolute freedom to create includes jnana and kriya (knowledge and activity). Siva in this system is not like the inactive Brahman of Samkara Vedanta. He has svatantrya, unimpeded Will, absolute know-ledge, absolute power of creativity, and absolute Self-consciousness. 6. Anasrita Siva: This is a state below Sakti tattva and above Sadasiva tattva. This is only an avastha or state, not a tattva. This refers to that phase of reality where Sakti begins"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"10    Siva Sutrant temporarily to veil the Self and thus to isolate the universe from itself, producing akhyati or ignorance of its real nature. 7. Eternity, all-pervasiveness etc. are possible in the case of akasa (ether), paramanus (atoms) also according to certain schools, but svatantrya or absolute freedom is possible only in the case of Parama Siva or Absolute Reality whose nature is Caitanya (consciousness). 8. Consciousness qua consciousness is one and the same. So there cannot be difference in its essential state. Since all Selves are only consciousness, there cannot be any difference among them. 9. Mala: This literally means dross, taint or impurity. Mala is what covers and conceals the pure gold of divine consciousness. It is a limiting condition which hampers the free expression of the spirit. It is of three forms, anava mala, mayiya mala and karma mala. Anava mala: It is the primal limiting condition which reduces the universal consciousness to that of an empirical being. It is a cosmic limiting condition over which the individual has no control. It is owing to this that the jiva or individual soul considers itself apurna or imperfect, a separate entity cut off from the universal consciousness. The greatness of Siva in this condition is concealed, and the individual forgets his real nature. The anava mala is brought about in two ways. There may be bodha or knowledge, but the perfect I-consciousness whose nature is freedom of all cognition and activity may be missing (as in Vijnanakala) or there may be I-consciousness with abodha or ignorance (as in common folk). Mayiya mala is the limiting condition brought about by Maya that gives to the soul its gross and subtle body. It is also cosmic. It is bhinna-vedya-pratha - that which brings about the conscious-ness of difference owing to the differing limiting adjuncts of the bodies. Karma mala. It is the vasanas or impressions of actions done by the jnanendriyas and Karmendriyas under the influence of antah-karana. It is a limiting condition brought about by the individual by his karma and its vasanas. 10. Anadisiva: Some theorists hold that there are two kinds of Siva - one, Anadisiva who never assumes mala and thus never"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"1.1     11     descends into bondage; the other kind of Siva assumes mala and descends into bondage. Hence, Sivas when liberated are after all inferior to Anadisiva. Ksemaraja controverts this view and says that such so-called liberated Sivas are no better than transmigratory souls, as is the case of the empirical self who considers the body etc. (not-Self) to be the Self. TEXT TRANSLATION And so in order to explain to the inquisitive disciples 'what is Self, the author says, \"It is not the body, as maintained by the common folk and the materialists (Carvaka), not the vital principle (prana) as maintained by the followers of the Vedas, not the ascertaining power of the mind as maintained by the Yogacara Buddhists, nor the Void as maintained by the Madhya-mika Buddhists, but as has already been said, it is the foundational consciousness (absolute Will characterized by knowledge and activity). Even in the case of those subjects who imagine the body etc. to be the Self, the caitanya (foundational, pure cons-ciousness) shines forth as the true subject or Self characterized by natural original I-consciousness. As has been said in Mrtyunjit.1 ''Consciousness is the nature of Self which verily is the Divine Self freed of all limiting conditions. This is what"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"12    Siva Sutram has been described in all the Sastras (Sacred Texts)\" (VIII, 28). It has been said in Vijnana-bhairava also \"The same Self characterized by consciousness is present in all the bodies; there is no difference in it anywhere. Therefore, a person contemplat-ing on every thing as full of that (consciousness) can conquer transmigratory existence.\" (Verse 100). The same idea has been summarized in the following two Karikas in the Spandakarikas and explained to the disciples with an illustration by the great teacher (Vasugupta).2 \"The principle (i.e. the divine autonomy) of that source should be investigated with persevering effort, zeal and faith from which the group of outer senses together with the inner Karanesvari cakra,3 though apparently inconscient, acting like a conscious being, acquires the power to move forward towards an object (pravrtti), to take pleasure in maintaining it after having obtained it (sthiti), and to withdraw within the peace of oneself (Samhrti).4 The absolute freedom of that source is natural and spontaneous5 in all beings and conditions\". (sp. k.I. 6,7). NOTES 1. Mrtyunjit: This is only another name of Netra Tantra which has been published in the Kashmir Saiva Text Series. 2. Vasugupta was the teacher who for the first time expounded the Saiva philosophy in a systematic form. He lived towards the end of the 8th or beginning of the 9th century A.D. 3. The senses are the five organs of sense, and the five organs of action. The Karanesvari Cakra is the group of divine powers functioning in the various senses. 4. The powers of pravrtti, sthiti, and samhrti of the empirical selves are derived from those of the absolute Self or Siva. 5. The Freedom of the Absolute Self to do any thing and everything is spontaneous i.e., it does not depend on any extraneous material or instrumental cause. TEXT"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"1.l.     13     TRANSLATION Moreover the aforesaid consciousness is the atma or nature of the entire universe consisting of both existent objects (like 'jar' or cloth) or non-existent but imagined objects (like sky-flower). This interpretation is possible, because there is no mention in the sutra of the self of any particular being. Every appearance owes its existence to the light of conscious-ness. Nothing can ever have its own being without the light of consciousness. Being experienced, it is of the nature of cons-ciousness itself, because of its being identical with that light. The same idea has been expressed in Ucchusmabhairava in the following way. \"Oh dear one, so long as there are no knowers, how can there be anything known. The knower and the known are really the same principle. Therefore, there is nothing which is inherently impure.\""},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"14    Siva Sutram The same idea has been expressed succinctly in the following two verses in Spandakarika. \"The Self is the whole of reality, because all existents derive their existence from the Self, and because in the process of knowing, the known gets identified with the Self.\"29 Hence whether in the world or object or mental apprehension of it, there is no state which is not Siva. It is only the experient who always and everywhere exists in the form of the experienced.\" (11, 3,4). Since consciousness is the nature of the universe, therefore in order to prove it, the means of right knowledge etc. (pramanas) are inadequate, for these means of right knowledge are themselves dependent for their proof on the Self-luminous consciousness, and consciousness being ever luminous, it is impossible for anything whatever to veil it, as it is ever luminously present. AS has been said in Sri Trikahrdaya \"Just as (when) one tries to jump over the shadow of one's head with one's own feet, the head will never be at the place of one's feet, so also is it with Baindavi kala.\" Just as the head is never at the place of the feet of one who attempts to jump over (the shadow of one's head), so is this (viz. baimdavi Kala), this is the syntactical con-nexion here. With this intent, it has been authoritatively proved by a great many verses (in the Spandakarika) that caitanya or consciousness is Divine (Samkaratmaka) and the principle of spanda (the creative pulsation of delight) and that caitanya is ever self-luminous and the highest reality in the verse beginning with, \"That from which everything arises, because it is already existing in it (and arising still exists in it), can never be veiled by anything, there is no check to it anywhere\"' (1, 2) and ending with, \"That in which there is neither pain nor pleasure, nor object, nor subject (empirical subject), nor is it insensible (i.e. incapable of experiencing any thing), that indeed abides as Absolute Reality.\" NOTES Baindavi or Vaindavi Kala Baindavi Kala: means the sakti of para-pramata or highest knower.

Baindavi means pertaining to Bindu. Kala means sakti. Baindavi Kala, therefore, means 'the power of knowership of the Highest Self or consciousness'. Here it means the power of the Self by which it is always the knower and never the known. EXPOSITION The most important point to note in the first Sutra is that caitanyam in this system does not mean merely consciousness. Since it is the abstract noun derived from cetana i.e. one who conscires, one who cognizes, it connotes the idea of both know-ledge and activity. Caitanyam, therefore, in this system means Sarvajnanakriyamayam paripurnam svatantryam, the perfect, absolute freedom of cognizing and doing everything. The next important point to note is that atma may mean not simply Self but also svabhava (nature). From this point of view, the sutra means that caitanya or consciousness is the nature of Reality. The knower, knowledge, and known are all various forms of consciousness. The third important point to note is that caitanya is not simply prakasa but is also imbued with Universal I-consciousness which is the source of all manifestation. The fourth important point is that caitanya cannot be proved by any logical means, for all means of proof owe their existence to it, and so cannot prove their own source. Lastly this system is against the theory of the plurality of Self. The nature of all Selves is consciousness. Consciousness qua consciousness is the same in all Selves. Therefore the theory of the plurality of Self is not satisfactory. INTRODUCTION TO THE 2nd SUTRA TEXT TRANSLATION If the nature of the entire universe consisting of empirical"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"16    Siva Sutram selves and inert matter is only consciousness or in other words Parama Siva (Highest Siva), then how is this (apparent) bondage to be explained. In order to remove this doubt, the second sutra has been formulated. Ksemaraja cautions - that this sutra is to be read in two ways (1) according to the rules of Sandhi (euphonic coalescence of the final and initial letters) with the coalescence of the final and initial letters in which case this sutra combined with the previous one would stand thus: (Caitanyamatmajnanam bandhah) i.e. the form of the sutra would be caitanyamatma + ajhanam bandhah, (2) without the coalescence of the final letter of the previous sutra and the initial letter of the second sutra in which case the second sutra would stand separately simply as jnanam bandhah. Sutra-2 Jnanam Bandhah. vitiated or limited knowledge; bondage; Sutra - Ajnana or ignorance of one's real nature which is a kind of shrunken or limited knowledge is the cause of bondage (of the empirical Self). COMMENTARY TEXT TRANSLATION By the argument advanced before, it has been established that there can be nothing which can be proved to be separate from the light of consciousness."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"1.2     17     The dualists maintain that there are two separate realities,, viz. Siva and mala. (Since it has already been proved that there is nothing separate from consciousness), how can there be separate existence of mala and how can this mala veil consciousness of a Self? Therefore, Malinivijaya by rejecting the way of the dualists says. \"Mala, it is said, is nothing but ajnana or ignorance of one's real nature. This ajnana is the anava mala1 which is the cause of samsara or mayiya mala which again serves as the cause of Karmamala\". According to Sarvacara also -\"People are bound by ajnana and on account of this (ajnana) they undergo birth and death.\" A limitation is made to appear by the Highest Lord in His own being which is pure like the sky in the form of anasrita siva etc. down to mayapramata.2 This limitation is due to His power of Mahamaya3 which is simply a form of Self-veiling brought about by His power of absolute freedom. That limitation alone is bondage which is (1) of the nature of ajnana (ignorance) i.e. non-awareness of one's non-difference from Siva and (2) of the nature of limited knowledge in the form of anavamala which makes one consider oneself as thoroughly reduced in respect of knowledge and action and thus imperfect. NOTES 1. Anava mala is of two kinds - (1) Paurusa - ignorance innate in the very being of the individual Self, and bauddha -ignorance inherent in the buddhi. Here the ajnana referred to is the paurusa ajnana i.e. ignorance of his real nature innate in the individual. 2. Mayapramata is the self under the influence of maya. This includes the pralayakalas and the sakalas. 3. Mahamaya. There are two states of mahamaya - apara and para. Apara is that which flourishes below Suddhavidya and above maya. In this are stationed the Vijinanakalas. It also denotes that mentality of the experients by which they have suddha prakasa or clear knowledge but are devoid of pure, full I-consciousness. Para mahamaya is that lower level of Suddha Vidya in which are stationed the Vidyesvaras who, though they consider them-"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"18    Siva Sutram selves to be pure consciousness, still consider the objects to be different from themselves. TEXT TRANSLATION I have shown at great length while discussing diksa (initiation) in my commentary Udyota on Svacchanda Tantra at the end of the 5th patala that mala as something separate from conscious-ness cannot be proved logically. The same purport of the above sutra has been epitomised in the following verse (in Spandakarika). \"The empirical self is reduced to inefficiency on account of his innate impure limiting conditions (anava, mayiya and karma mala) He is driven to desire various objects, but owing to his inefficiency is never fully satisfied. When the restless condition of his mind brought about by his identification of himself with his conditioned selfhood fully ceases, then he experiences the highest state\" (sp. k. 1.9) Thus it is not only the limited knowledge due to that ignorance on account of which the conditioned self considers his real Self as not-Self which is the cause of bondage but also the limited knowledge due to that ignorance on account of which the condi-tioned self considers the not-Self i.e., the body etc. to be his Self. This idea has been expressed in the following verse of Span-dakarika: \"The pasu (conditioned individual) has all his knowledge born of sense and ideation. It is because of this sense and ideation-born knowledge that he loses the enjoyment of the ambrosia of the Highest Self and his innate freedom, Such sense and"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"1.2     19     ideation-born knowledge is confined to the sphere of the tanma-tras i.e. sound, colour and form, taste, touch, and odour and the pleasures derived from them\". (Sp. K. HI, 14) NOTES 1. Ajnana or primal ignorance appears in two forms -(1) atmani anatmabhimana i.e. considering the real Self as not Self (not knowing the real Self as Self), and (2) anatmani atmabhimana i.e. considering the not-Self i.e. body etc. as the Self. Ajnana in this system does not mean complete absence of knowledge, but sankucitajnana. i.e. imperfect knowledge, limited knowledge, incomplete knowledge, not knowledge in its whole-ness. TEXT TRANSLATION It has been indicated in the previous sutra i.e. the first sutra that the word caitanya connotes svatantrya i.e. absolute freedom to know everything and absolute freedom to do everything (jnana-kriya-svatantrya). Now in respect of this (double-faced) svatantrya, even if there be only prakasa or jnana (cidatmani api), but without kartrtva-svatantrya, in other words, without I-consciousness, which leads one to consider onself incomplete or deficient as in the case of Vijtianakala1, there is anava mala; or even if there is svatantrya in the form of kartrtva (doership indicating I-consciousness) but full of abodha or ignorance lead-ing to consider the not-Self like the body etc. as the Self (as in the case of sakala), then again there is anava mala. Thus this sutra points out that there is anava mala in two ways. As has been said in Isvara-pratyabhijna. There may be bodha or jnana"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"20    Siva Sutnun without the sense of doership or I-consciousness (which is the loss of kartrtva-svatantrya); or there maybe the sense of doer-ship without bodha or jnana (which is the loss of jnana-svatantrya). So there is anava mala in two ways both of which are due to one's loss of the grip of one's essential nature\"2 (III, 2,4) NOTES 1. Vijnanakala: the experient below suddhavidya but above Maya. He has pure awareness but no agency. He is free of karma and mayiya mala, but is not yet free of anava mala. 2. Essential nature: The essential nature of Self consists in full freedom of both jnana and kriya. EXPOSITION The first Sutra says that Self is pure consciousness. The question arises that if Self is pure consciousness, how is it that it is in bondage? The second Sutra provides the answer to this question. It says that the bondage of the individual is due to his so-called jnana (limited knowledge) which really speaking is ajnana or ignorance. Ignorance or ajnana is not negative; it is positive, a kind of positive jnana, a shrunken, vitiated knowledge. It is this shrunken, vitiated jnana which is responsible for the indivi-dual's bondage. But this kind of jnana or knowledge is, truly speaking, ajnana or ignorance. This ignorance is of two forms (1) not knowing the real Self to be Self at all, completely with-drawn from one's real Self and (2) knowing the not-Self i.e. the body etc. to be the Self. This ajnana is known as anava mala, a limitation innate in the individual. What is this anava mala due to? It is due to a wonderful power of Siva (the Supreme). A person may conceal everything, but he cannot conceal his own nature. But Siva has this wonder-ful power of veiling his real nature. This Self-veiling power of Siva is known as Mahamaya. In the anu, (the limited individual), that Self-veiling works as mala. This Self-veiling is His technique or stratagem for the play of life in varied, multiple forms. Man is bound to transmigratory existence, to sense-life, to the life of his own vehicles or bodies only so long as heallows himself to"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"1.3     21     be confined to the limited knowledge of his senses and mentation. When he recognises his real nature, he is free. INTRODUCTION TO THE 3rd SUTRA TEXT TRANSLATION Is anavamala as described the only cause of bondage? The next sutra says, No. (There are other causes also, viz. mayiya and karma mala). Sutra - 3 Yonivargah kalasariram the source (of the objective world) i.e. maya. class of tattvas (principles and elements). Yonivargah, therefore,; means maya and her brood i.e. the class of elements to which she gives rise and which thus constitute the source of this world activity; form = whose form is activity i.e. activity through which worldly life is carried out. So yonivargah is mayiya mala and kalasariram is karma mala. The word bandhah (bondage) is understood in this sutra also. Therefore the sutra means \"Mayiya mala and karma mala are also the cause of bondage.\" This sutra has been slightly differently interpreted by Bhaskara in Siva-sutra-varitikam. According to him Yoni means the four Saktis of Amba, Jyestha, Raudrl and Varna. Kala means letters from 'a' to 'ksa' which bring about words. The above saktis through the influence of words bring about thought-constructs owing to which the Self is reduced to an empirical being and thus surfers bondage. Ksemaraja's interpretation is better. COMMENTARY TEXT"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"22  Siva  Sutram  TRANSLATION The word bandhah or bondage follows from the previous sutra. (The meaning of yonivargah is the following). Yoni means the source of this world i.e. Maya. Vargah means (tattva-samuhah) the class of elements associated with Maya directly or through successive stages. This brings about body, worlds, kala (limited agency) etc.1 down upto earth. So Yoni-vargah means Mayiya mala.2 Kala is that which divides the world of entities into separate things as this or that by mental impenetration, in other words, 'activity'. Sarira means form. Kalasariram, therefore, means 'that whose form is activity', that is to say, Karma mala.1 (Like the Mayiya mala), this karma mala is also the cause of bondage. This is the meaning. NOTES 1. Etc indicates the other four kancukas or coverings of maya, viz., Vidya, Raga, Kala and Niyati. (1) Kala brings about limitation in respect of agency or efficacy. (2) Vidya brings about limitation in respect of knowledge. (3) Raga brings about desire for this or that. (4) Kala brings about limitation in respect of time, viz., past, present, future etc. (5) Niyati brings about limitation in respect of cause, space and form. 2. Mayiyamala is the mala or limitation due to maya which gives to the soul its gross and subtle body and brings about sense of difference. Karma mala is mala due to vasanas or impressions left behind on the mind due to karma or action.

When this restless condition of his mind brought about by his identification of himself with his conditioned selfhood fully ceases, then he experiences the highest state.\" (1,9) That this is so may be understood from my (Ksemaraja's) commentary Spandnirnaya on Spandakarika. These kala etc. whose characteristic is limited agency etc. are attached to anava mala as their base and veil the essential nature of jivas (empirical selves). Thus it is fully established that they are malas or limiting conditions. As has been said in Svacchanda. \"Caitanya (Freedom of the Self to know and do every thing) is suppressed by mala (i.e., anava ma/a) and provided with kala and vidya, is tainted by raga, limited in respect of kala (time), restrained by niyati. magnified by the sense of being a Purusa (an empirical self), furnished with the disposition of Prakrti, endowed with the three gunas (rajas, tamas and sattva), buddhi, ahamkara, and manas, jnanendriyas (organs of sense) and kar-"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"24    Siva Sutram mendriyas (organs of action), tanmatras, and the gross elements.\"1 (II, 39-41). Malini-vijaya shows in the following line that Karma mala also veils the essential nature of the empirical self. \"He (the jiva) does good and bad deeds which bring about pleasure and pain.2 (I, 24). In Isvara-pratyabhijna also, it has been said in the following verse that Mayiya and karma mala are particular kinds of limited knowledge with anava mala as their base. \"When there is ignorance of real Self, then Anava mala being present, there arise mayiya mala bringing about a sense of difference in respect of every object, and karma mala which brings about birth and experience of pleasure and pain (bhoga). All the three malas are brought about by the Maya Sakti of Siva.\" (III.2.5) NOTES 1. This gives the details of mayiya mala. 2. This indicates karma mala 3. Maya Sakti is the inherent power of Siva by which He appears in different forms. Maya Sakti is different from Maya tattva (the material origin of the various objects in the universe).

The third sutra says that it is not only the anava mala which is responsible for the individual's bondage. Attached to anava mala as a base, there are two more malas, mayiya and karma. They also bring about the bondage of the individual. Mayiya mala provides the individual with the physical and psychic vehicles in which he is 'cabined, caged and confined', and Karma mala makes him commit motivated actions. These and their residual traces are not airy nothing. They are karmika forces that drag the individual to earth-life again and again.

Of this threefold limited knowledge, matrka,1 or alphabet from a to ksa the mother of the entire universe is the presiding deity. She is called matrka, because she is unknown, ununderstood."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"26    Siva Sutram NOTES 1. Matrka: The 'ka' suffix in Samskrta denotes the idea that the thing to which this suffix is added is unknown or un-understood. Hence Matrka means the mother who is not properly known or understood. Matrka is the subtle form of gross speech. The letters and their ultimate essential nature are known as Matrka. When unknown, the Matrka impels people towards all kinds of worldly activities and feelings. When the Matrka is known i.e. when her saving power is realized, she leads one to liberation. TEXT TRANSLATION She (Matrka) brings about knowledge in a limited form, e.g. \"I am imperfect\" (anavama/a) \"I am thin or fat.\" (mayiya mala), \"I am a performer of agnistoma sacrifice\" (karma mala). Such knowledge is subtle or in a concretely expressed form (avikalpakasavikalpaka - paramaria - mayasya), and by the pene-tration of different communicative words in the minds of the listener brings about a feeling of sorrow, pride, joy, and passion. TEXT TRANSLATION Matrka is the presiding Power in the form of various deities (Saktir adhisthatri), as, for instance, is described by Timirod-ghata in the following verse: \"The Mahaghora1 Saktis who are the deities of the pithas.2"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"1.4     27     who hover about the consciousness in Karandhra3 i.e. Brahmaran-dhra with a terrible noose delude people constantly\". She (Matrka) shines in the line of Saktis presiding over varga (classes of letters)4, kald5 (the subtlest aspect of the objective world) etc.6 in the form of Brahmi and other Saktis; she rouses people to ail kinds of activity and feeling by means of the arrange-ment of a succession of letters of a script - a fact which is very well made clear in the Sarvavira and other agamas; she is closely united with the group of Saktis known as Arnba,7 Jyestlia, Raudri and Varna. NOTES 1. There are three Saktis, Ghora, Ghoratari or Mahaghora and Aghori. The Ghora (terrible) are the innumerable Saktis (powers) who provide worldly pleasures to men and put obstacles in their path of spiritual progress. The Ghoratari or Mahaghora are those innumerable saktis who delude the worldly-minded people and drive them more and more towards worldliness. The Aghora are those saktis who inspire the jivas (empirical selves) towards the path of liberation. 2. Pithas - Seats i.e. the sense-organs which are the seats of these Saktis. 3. 'Ka' in the context means Brahman. Karandhra, there-fore, means Brahmarandhra. This is a psychic centre above the head. 4. The presiding deities over the various classes of letters are the following: Class of letters. 1. A varga; (the class of vowels) 2. Ka varga (ka, kha, ga, gha. na) 3. Cavarga (Ca, cha, ja, jha, na) 4. Tavarga (ta, tha, da, dha, na) 5. Tavarga (ta, tha, da, dha, na) 6. Pavarga (pa, pha, ba, bha, ma) 7. Yavarga (ya, ra, la, va) 8. Savarga (sa, sa, sa, ha, ksa) Presiding deities. Yogisvari or Mahalaksmi. Brahmi. Mahesvari. Kaurnari. Vaisnavi. Varahi. Aindri or Indrani. Camunda. 5. Kalas are the specific modes of Sakti. They are the subt-lest aspects of the objective world. There are five kalas, viz."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"28    Siva Sutram Nivrtti, Pratistha, Vidya, Santi, Santyatita. Nivrtti kala is so called because here the manifesting energy is stopped and is turned upwards. It is the essential working force in Prthivi tattva (solidity). There are 16 bhuvanas in this. Pratistha Kala is the subtle force of the tattvas from ap (fluidity) to Prakrti (in all 23 tattvas). It has 56 bhuvanas. Vidya is the kala working in the tattvas from Purusa upto Maya. It contains seven tattvas and 28 bhuvanas. The Santi or Santa kala is domi-nant in the tattvas Sadvidya, Isvara and Sada Siva and contains 18 bhuvanas. The Santyatita kala is the characteristic of Sakti and Siva tattvas. It has no bhuvana. 6. Etc. includes Sadadhva (Varna, pada, mantra, kala, tattva and bhuvana). 7. Arnba, Jyestha, Raudri and Vama: Amba is the Sakti that puts obstacles in all the actions. Jyestha is Sivamayi the Sakti who leads to liberation. Varna is the Sakti who is active in the manifestation of the world. Raudri is the Sakti who brings about obstacles for the wicked and destroys them for elevated souls. TEXT TRANSLATION Because that (Matrka) is the basis (of all limited knowledge), therefore, one is deprived of the investigation of the inner non-difference (from the fullest I-consciousness of Siva) and all one's knowledge is outward - turned without ceasing for a moment. Therefore, it is rightly maintained that all such knowledge is the cause of bondage. This idea is also expressed in the following verses in Spanda-karika: \"He (the limited, empirical self) being deprived of the know-ledge of his essential Self by the Kaliis i.e. the letters 'ka' etc. falls a victim to the group of Saktis like Brahmi etc. arising from"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"1.5     29     a multitude of words. Therefore he is known as pasu.\" (HI, 13) \"His Saktis (inherent in letters described before) are always in readiness in veiling his essential real Self, because all his ideas cannot arise without the use of words.\" (III,15) EXPOSITION The basis of all the three males is word-bound ideas. The words are a reflex of the letters and their sound known as Matrka, so, ultimately it is Matrka which is responsible for the limited knowledge i.e., the three malas. Words have a tremendous in-fluence in shaping our ideas which do not allow us to realize the splendour of Siva-consciousness imprisoned within ourselves. INTRODUCTION TO THE 5th SUTRA TEXT TRANSLATION Now the next sutra teaches that the quintessence of the means for the cessation of the bondage brought about by the limited knowledge consists in resting in .Bhairara-consciousness. Sutra-5 Udyamao Bliairavah. in this context means, as Ksemaraja rightly suggests, sudden emergence of (divine) consciousness; it is an opening out, an efflorescence of consciousness. Udyamah in this sutra does not mean exertion or effort. The word is formed from ut + yam. Ut means 'up', 'upwards' and yam means to raise, to hold, (vide Monier-Williarn's Sans-English Dy.) Udyamah, therefore, means 'raising up','elevation of cons-ciousness'. Since this sutra teaches Sambhavopaya, udyamah can never mean exertion in this context."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"30    Siva Sutram The Sutra, therefore, means that a sudden flash or opening out of transcendental consciousness is Bhairava or Siva.

That udyama in itself is Bhairava inasmuch as Bhairava holds within Himself the entire universe by reducing all the saktis to sameness with Himself and inasmuch as He completely devours within Himself the entire mass of ideation (which is responsible for sense of difference). That udyama may in itself be called Bhairava inasmuch as it is the means for revealing Bhairava who is one's own essential Self. That udyama appears in those who are devoted to Him because of their whole attention being concentrated on that inner Bhairava principle. This is what has been taught in this sutra.

(II, 23). This samavesa is called Sambhava. Another meaning of guruna pratibodhatah has also been taught by the great teachers, viz. (guru = great; pratibodha = awakening) i.e. 'by one''s own great awakening'. In Svacchanda Tantra also, it has been said, 'Oh beautiful one (i.e. Parvati, consort of Siva), of the man who realizes his Bhairava nature by an apprehension of an inner emergent divine nature and is thus united with the Eternal, all the mantras become effective, being charged with power.\" The word bhavana occurring in the above verse means 'an apprehension of an inner emergent divine consciousness' (not meditation or contemplation). This idea has also been expressed in the following verse of Spandakarika. 'While one is engaged in one thought, and another arises, the junction-point between the two is the unmesa3-a. revelation of the true nature of the Self which is the background of both the two thoughts. This may be experienced by every one for one-self.'' (1ll, 9) NOTES 1. Pratibha is a technical term of this system. It means the Paravaka, the absolutely free creative divine consciousness (vide Paratrimsika, p. 102). 2. Bhairava is an anacrostic word. The letter bha of this word indicates bharana or maintenance of the world, ra indi-cates ravana or withdrawal of the world, and va indicates vamana projection of the world. Thus Bhairava is one who brings about the srsti, sthiti and samhara of the universe. 3. Uninesa means opening out, emergence, revelation of the true nature of Self."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"32    Siva Sutram EXPOSITION This sutra gives in a nutshell Sambhavopaya - the Sambhava Yoga. This immersion in divine consciousness occurs to one who is a very advanced aspirant. It is a sudden flash of divine consciousness by an orientation of the will towards the inner creative consciousness which is always present within oneself. It requires no discipline of meditation, japa etc. INTRODUCTION TO THE 6th SUTRA TEXT TRANSLATION Thus after showing that Bhairava-consciousness comes about by taking hold of the emergence of the highest pratibha (sudden flash of the divine I-consciousness) which is the one sure means of putting a stop to bondage that arises on account of spiritual ignorance, the sutrakara (the formulator of the surras) now says that when this Siva-consciousness is completely established, there continues the awareness of the cessation of all difference even in the usual normal course of life (when one's attention is not neces-sarily turned inward).

This Sakti though fully aware of its inner nature is outwardly engaged in activity and thus seizing the entire host of its S~aktis appears in the form of succession (krama), non-succession (i.e. simultaneity) (akrama)1, in the transcendence of both succession and simultaneity, in the form of being greatly empty (atirikta or krsa, greatly emaciated), of being not empty at all (arikta or purna - always full) or in the form of both empty and non-empty.2 Though she (Sakti) is described in the various detailed forms as above, she is not any of these forms.

This exhausts all the four alternatives, viz., (1) empty (2) non-empty (3) both empty and non-empty (4) neither empty nor non-empty.

In this sutra, the attention of the aspirant has been drawn to five important points. (1) The fourth state of consciousness is the everpresent witnessing consciousness of all the three. Even the three states of waking, dreaming, and profound sleep could not be experienced as three different states without a consciousness, a knower that knows all the three. That fourth state is, then, our real Self. It is the everpresent, immortal atman, the death-less, ceaseless consciousness that witnesses all that we feel, think, and do. It is the changeless permanent I that witnesses all our changing I's. (2) Our states of waking, dream, and profound sleep are interrupted. When we are in the waking state, there is no dream state; when we are in the dream state, there is no aware-ness in that state of our waking, and when we are in the state of profound sleep, there is no awareness in that state of our waking and dreaming state. Further, each state is due to certain conditions which are not present in the other state. In the waking state, the body, prana, senses, and manas are active. In the dream state, the eye, ear, touch etc. do not work. In one word, the function of the senses stops. Their function is taken up by the mind, by imagination. In dream, we see, hear, run, eat etc. - all mentally In it only prana and manas are active. In profound sleep, even the function of manas stops; only prana functions. So, that is also a separate state altogether. Is there then nothing that remains the same in all these differ-ing states? There is, declares the Saiva philosophy. It is the fourth state (turya or turiya) of consciousness which is not involved in all the three states, which stands as witnessing consciousness to all the three. It should be borne in mind that it is called the fourth with reference to the other three. The word fourth is applied to it relatively owing to the limitation of language. In reality,"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"40    Siva Sutram any numerical term cannot be applied to it. It is ever present reality. (3) Turya consciousness always remains as the background of all we feel, think, and do, but we are unaware of it in our normal consciousness. It is always there. It is siddha i.e. eter-nally present, not sadhya i.e. it is not reality that can be produced by our effort, by any Yogic discipline or technique. If it were to be produced, it would no longer be eternal. It cannot be ordered about. Then why all this pother about gaining the turya consciousness? What is the value of the upayas or Yogic disciplines mentioned in the Siva-Sutras? The answer is that though it remains as the background of all we are and do, we are unaware of it. It is not a feature of our normal consciousness. The upayas are mentioned so that we may prepare ourselves for its reception. The Sambhavopaya is for very advanced souls whose mind is already prepared for its reception. In them, there is ut+yama (udyama). In this context udyama does not mean exertion as some have unfortunately interpreted it, but as Ksemaraja points out, it means unmajjana, udyantrta - emergence. When we are prepared by righteous living and by deconditioning our habitual consciousness, the turya emerges from its cryptic cell, so to speak, takes possession of our normal consciousness and becomes its active feature. (4) In the words of Kathopanisad, it is a prabhava or in the words of Siva-Sutra (7), it is a sambhava, the birth of a new awareness for ourselves. In that condition, even though states of waking, dream, and deep sleep differ, it abides as a constant active awareness in all of them. It brings about a transformation of our normal consciousness. In all the differing states, there is an integral awareness. We then live sub specie aeterniiatis. (5) Turya consciousness in Saiva philosophy is not merely prakasa, not merely Saksi caitanya, witnessing consciousness as in Samkara Vedanta, but it is also vimarsa, full of turyabhoga, i.e. of rapturous experience of the perfect consciousness of Siva."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"1.8-10.    41    INTRODUCTION TO THE 8th, 9th AND 10th SUTRAS TRANSLATION The sutrakara defines the waking state etc. by means of the next three sutras. 8.

So the sutra means \"Lack of awareness on any plane is the profound sleep of delusion.\" COMMENTARY TEXT"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"42    Siva Sutram TRANSLATION (Ksemaraja at first gives the usual, conventional sense of the three states of consciousness, viz., waking, dreaming, and dreamless sleep). The waking state of consciousness is that in which knowledge of objects is produced in people by means of the external senses and the objects have a common connotation for all. The dream state of consciousness is that in which knowledge is produced only by the mind (without contact with the external world), which is merely a thought-construct (vikalpah) and which has an uncommon object (i.e. which is a particular kind of know-ledge for each individual). It is called dream because it is charac-terized by such uncommon ideation. That which is a state of aviveka i.e. complete lack of awareness is delusive deep sleep. While defining susupta state, the sutra incidentally describes also the nature of Maya which is to be eliminated.

In deep sleep, though there is no mental activity as such, yet just when one is about to enter the state of deep sleep, there is a slightly vague awareness characteristic of the state of deep sleep which may be likened to the awareness of waking state. After that there is dreaming state also inasmuch as there are vikalpas (reveries) in the form of their residual traces. (Ksemaraja now describes the three states with reference to the Yogi). TEXT TRANSLATION With reference to the Yogi, at first his knowledge in the form of dharana or fixing the mind on particular object is his waking state, then his vikalpas (reverie) in the form of a continuous flow of the idea of that object of his concentration is his dream state; (finally) Samadhi in the form of absence of difference bet-ween the thinker and the thought is his state of deep sleep. This has been shown by an appropriate application of words. Therefore in Purvasasira (i.e. Malinivijaya tantra) the varieties of waking state etc. (i.e. dreaming and deep sleep) have been expounded by means of the transmission of one state into the other with reference to yogi in the following verse: (Malini Vijaya, II, 43)."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"44    Siva Sutram The experience of one staying in the objective consciousness is of four kinds, viz; abuddha i e. unawakened, buddha i.e. awakened, prabuddha i.e. well awakened, and suprabuddha i.e. perfectly well-awakened. So also there are four kinds of ex-perience of those who are staying in pada, (and also of those who are staying in rupa). EXPOSITION The wider sense of dreaming, deep sleep as given in the text is quite clear, But Malinivijaya quoted by Ksemaraja gives certain other details which require clarification. According to Malinivijaya, the various states of waking, dream etc. are to be ascertained with reference to the pramata, the knower or the subject. Whenever an object is known only as an external object, (prameya) i.e. when it is the objective side that is mostly prominent, we have the state of waking consciousness. It may be called jagrat-jagrat state, since it is a waking condition in an actual waking state. From the stand-point of the Yogi, it is an abuddha or unawakened state. When in the waking state, it is not so much the external object but the knowledge (pramana) of the object which is prominent in consciousness, it is the jagrat-svapna state i.e. it is a kind of dream during the waking state. From the stand-point of the Yogi, it is the buddha or awakened state. When in the waking state, it is the pramata. the knower or the subject who is prominent in consciousness, then it is a state of jagrat-susupti i.e. the knower is awake with regard to the subject, but asleep with regard to the object. From the yogic stand-point, it is prabuddha or well-awakened state. When in the waking state, there is predominance only of consciousness as such (pramiti) it is known as the jagrat-turya state. From the yogic standpoint, it is called suprabuddha state i.e. perfectly awakened state. From the standpoint of the common man, all these pertain to jagrat-avastha. The Yogis call all these states as pindastha, i.e. states referring to the objective side. The jnanis (those who have complete Siva -consciousness) call this state sarvatobhadra, because according to them, the entire objective world is full of"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"1.8-10.    45    the glory of divine existence; the entire manifestation is an expression of Siva, a play of samvid or consciousness. Now let us take up the four states in svapna (dream). The common characteristics of the dream state are that (1) it is a plane of vikalpas i.e. ideas, fancies, reveries and that (2) it is abahya i.e. independent of the external world, confined only to the dreamer. When the dream world fabricated by the vikalpas (ideation) appears in dream as very clear, precise and stationary, it is the state of svapna-jagrat (waking condition in dream). Malinivijaya calls it gatagata, because in this state the movement of prana and apana is very prominent on account of which the dream-world appears to be very clear. When in the dream state, the entire dream-phenomena appear to be hazy, vague, and disorderly, then it is known as svapna-svapna i.e. a dreamy condition within the dream state. Malini-vijaya calls this state suviksipta. because the dream-phenomena are in this state chaotic, disorderly. When in the dream state, the dreamer is able to establish a clear connexion between one dream object and another, then it is called svapna-susupti, because the dreamer enjoys full, peaceful sleep without feeling any incongruity among his dream-objects. The jnanins call this state samgata, because the dreamer feels in this kind of dream a congruity or consistency among his dream-objects. When during the entire phantasmagoria of his dream state, the dreamer does not lose hold of his self-consciousness, when he is fully aware of himself and knows that he is only dreaming, then this state is known as svapna-turya. This is also called susamahita state, because in this state the dreamer is a fully integrated individual. To the common man, the dream state is just a svapna or dream state in which he views the various vikalpas of his dream without any contact with the external world. The Yogi includes all these four states in one blanket term, called padastha, because by means of yoga, he abides in the pada or state of his own Self in all these conditions. Gatagata, suviksipta, samgata and susamahita are only phases of the padastha state."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"46    Siva Sutram As already said, from the point of view of the Yogis, this is a padastha state. From the point of view of the jnani, this is a state of vyapti or pervasion, for the jnani experiences the perva-sion of his own being in all these phases of the dream state. Let us now take up the susupti state, the state of profound sleep. There are four phases of this also. First of all, there is the susupti-jdgrat, waking in deep sleep. This is also called udita (risen), because in this there is the residual impression of the entire objective world in a latent form. The Susupti-svapna state is known as vipula in the tantras. The word vipula means thick, increased. This state is called vipula, because in this state the residual traces of the experience of the objective world are fostered so that they become stronger. The susupti-susupti of this state is known as santa in the tantras, because the residual traces of objective experience become sub-dued and tranquil. The susupti-turya state is known as suprasanna in the tantras, because in this state the yogi enters the full I-consciousness of Siva and is full of peace and joy. So there are four phases of the rupastha state of the Yogi, viz; udita, vipula, santa, and suprasanna. Briefly it may be said that the waking state is that in which the aspect of the known or the objective experience is prominent, the dream state is that in which knowledge or mentation is pro-minent, and susupti or dreamless state is that in which the knower or the subject aspect is prominent. In the turya state, there are only three phases, viz. turya-jagratt turya-svapna and turya-susupti. The turya-jagrat is that state in which mind as we know it retires completely. Its function ceases and the Super-mind becomes active. This is called manonmana. In this state, the activity of the normal mind stops, and unmand or Super-mind supervenes. Turya-svapna is that state in which the Yogi crosses the boun-dary of limitation (of knowledge) and enters the region of un-lirnitedness (of knowledge). Hence in the tantras, it is called ananta, i.e. unlimited."},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"1.11.     47     Turya-susupti is known as sarvartha in the tantras, because in this state every thing appears as a form of divine Sakti. There is no such phase as turya-turya. In turya state, the aspirant is identified with Siva-conscious-ness. The common man simply calls it the turya or fourth state, because it is beyond the three known states of waking, dream, and deep sleep. He has no experience of the turya state. The yogi calls it rupattta, because in this state, the common form of both the object and the subject is transcended. The jnani calls it pracaya which means collectivity, because in this condi-tion, the jnani sees everything steeped in the sap of divine delight. Turyatita is that state which is full of uninterrupted divine rapture of I-consciousness. There is no question of phases of this state. It is the state of fullest realization. There is no need of any Yogic practice now. The jnani calls this state maha-pracaya. In it even the distinction between the transcendent and the immanent disappears. To one who has entered this state, everything is Siva. INTRODUCTION TO THE 11th SUTRA TEXT TRANSLATION Thus the Yogi in whom the rapturous experience of I-cons-ciousness which is full of the consciousness of non-difference shines through the cancellation of the universe (as something separate from consciousness) by the process of uniting with the group of Saktis through constant awareness in all the three states of waking, dream, and deep sleep which have been ex-plained both from the point of view of the common folk and the yogi, enters the turyatita state (i.e. the state beyond the turya) which has been previously described as caitanya by following up the stream (of that rapturous experience of I-consciousness) (He is then)."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"48    Siva Sutram Sutra - 11 Tritayabhokta viresah triad; enjoyer; master of the senses.

COMMENTARY TRANSLATION Whoever observes this triad of waking etc. as steeped in the delight of the fourth state by means of the awareness of his union with the multitude of saktis, as full of the flow of the ex-perience of delight, as that in which all the residual traces of difference have been dissolved by the intensity of the joyous experience of the fourth state, he becomes the enjoyer of the rapture of the divine I-consciousness in all the three states. Therefore, \"He who (as witnessing consciousness) knows both what is said to be the object of experience and the subject of experience in all the three states is not tainted (with the condition of these) even while he is aware of both the subject and the object.\" In this way, he enjoys unrivalled Self-sovereignty, is full of the highest bliss, and becomes the master of his senses1 (viranarn) that are (now) intent upon dissolving all worldly differences."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"1.11.     49     In the mahamnayas2 (great scriptures), he is said to have entered the being of Manthana Bhairava.3 One who is not of this sort becomes an object of enjoyment of the forces of the waking and other states, and remains simply the usual empirical subject. Even a yogi who has not risen up along this stream cannot be the master of his senses; he will remain only a confounded being. This is what is meant to be said. NOTES 1. Viranam: of the senses. When the senses function ordinarily in common life, they are merely vrttis i.e. modes of acquiring objective (in the case of the outer senses) and sub-jective (in the case of the manas) experience. When, however, the subject consciously acquires the experience of the fourth state, then his senses become saktis i.e. divine powers intent on abolishing all sense of difference. They are not merely indriyas, but viras now. The experient now becomes their master. He uses them for the higher purpose of life, and is no longer used by them. 2. Mahamnayas: Saiva Philosophy has been expounded from three standpoints viz. (l) from the predominantly abheda or non-difference point of view.

The yogi has this experience in himself that is full of uninterrupted joy - a joy with which he never feels satiated. This facinating wonder betokens the various stations and stages of yoga which means communion with the Highest Reality. These are definite stations indicative of the repose of the yogi in the higher consciousness during the powers of his ascent to the Highest Reality, not experiences which one may notice in muladhara1 or the psychic centre2 between the eye-brows. The same idea has been expressed in Kulayukti (in the following verse): \"When aspirants realize the Self by themselves, then the Self experiences a pleasant surprise within itself.\" The same idea has also been expressed in the following verse in Spandakarika: \"How can there be the wretched transmigratory existence for him who observing his Self as the presiding power over every thing abides (in that consciousness) full of pleasant surprise.\" (1,11) NOTES 1.

Thus the desire of such a yogi is not coarse like that of the common folk, but it is like parasakti itself, unimpeded everywhere. The same idea has been express-ed in the following verse in Svacchanda Tantra also: \"That highest Divine Sakti abides in all the goddesses in different names and forms, remains concealed by the yogamaya2, is a virgin, and fulfils the desire of all people (X, Verse 727). In Mrtyunjaya3 also, it has been said, \"That Highest Sakti is only my Will power, inseparable from me. She should be considered as natural to me. She is to be known (in the same relation to me), as heat to the fire and rays to the sun. That Sakti is the cause of the entire world.\" (I, 25-26) The same idea has been expressed in another way in the fol-lowing verse of Spandakarika. \"A person cannot become the impeller of the goad of desire by himself.

From the standpoint of (1) abheda (non-difference) he interprets Iccha (of the great Yogi) as identical (abhinna) with the svatantrya sakti of Siva, and Kumari as that svatantrya sakti engaged in the play of bringing about the manifestation and withdrawal of the universe. This explanation is in accordance with Sambhavopaya. From the standpoint of (2) bhedabheda, he shows that the Iccha is designated as Kumari, because the consciousness of difference (bheda) brought about by Maya (ku) is destroyed by her (man). So this shows the abheda of Iccha with Siva in the midst of the difference brought about by Maya. This explanation is in accordance with Saktopaya. From the standpoint of bheda, he shows that just as Kumari Uma was always intent on being united with Siva, so the Iccha of the Yogi is always intent on being united with Siva. This explanation is in accordance with anavopaya. In the concluding portion of his commentary on this sutra, Ksemaraja shows his preference for its interpretation from the abheda standpoint.

COMMENTARY TEXT TRANSLATION (Ksemaraja interprets this sutra in two ways. The first interpretation is based on drsyam sariram). \"Whatever is perceptible whether inwardly or outwardly, all that appears to this Yogi like his own body, i.e. identical with himself and not as something different from him. This is so because of his great accomplishment (of identity with the Uni-versal consciousness). His feeling is 'I am this', just as the feeling of Sadasiva with regard to the entire universe is 'I am this'. (Now Ksemaraja's interpretation of this sutra is based on Sariram drsyam). To the Yogi, the body appears as an objective perceptible phenomenon like blue etc, and not like a perceiver as in the case of the ignorant empirical beings, whether that body is in the form of delta or the physical body (as in waking consciousness), or in the form of dhi or the mind (as in dream) or prana (as in deep sleep) or as sunya ox mere void (as in the case of the sunya-pramdta)."},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"58    Siva Sutram So, in the body and in everything external, his awareness is one of undifferentiated consciousness as the plasma of the peacock's egg is undifferentiated plasma.

Svapasya1 means of the void i.e. of the absence of every objective phenomenon. Darsanam means the appearance of everything as it is in its essential reality devoid of the distinction between subject and object like a component of oneself.2 (The sum and substance of the whole sutra is): -The individual mind intently entering into the universal light of foundational consciousness sees the entire universe as satu-rated with that consciousness. The same thing has been said in Vijnanabhairava:"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"60    Siva Sutram \"He whose mind together with the other senses is merged in the ether of the heart, who has entered mentally into the centre of the two bowls of the heart-lotus3, who has excluded everything else from consciousness acquires the highest fortune, O beautiful one.\" (Verse 49) Here the highest fortune refers to the acquisition of the lord-ship of the universe. Svacchanda Tantra also referring to the great Yogi who has attained to the state of highest Reality says: \"He who has realized his identity with the Highest Reality pervading the two aspects (adhva) (of Varna, pada, and mantra, and kala, tattva and bhuvana) manifest in the unconscious enti-ties like the unmoving ones and conscious beings like the moving ones abides as identical with Bhairava in all beings, objects, tattvas like earth etc. and the senses.\" (IV, verse 310). The same idea has been expressed in the following verse in Spandakarika: \"As when the Spanda principle pervades the body then all knowledge and action appropriate to that condition are possible, even so if he abides in his Real Self, his omniscience and omnipotence can function everywhere.\" (Ill, 7). NOTES 1. Ksemaraja has taken the word svapa in the sense of the void. Svapa, according to him, is complete absence of objectivity. 2. Ksemaraja has interpreted the word darsanam in the sense of abhedadarsanam i.e. by concentrating on Central Reality one sees all phenomena as non-different from the Universal cons-ciousness. 3. Padmasamputamadhyagah: In his commentary on Vijnana-bhairava, Sivopadhyaya says that one bowl of the heart lotus is pramana (knowledge), the other bowl is prameya (objects), madhya or centre of this heart lotus is pramata (the knower i.e. the Self). It is in this centre i.e. the Self into which one has to plunge mentally. 'This is Saktopaya.'

If the individual mind is united with the Central, foundational consciousness, if the citta (the individual mind) is brought into communion with Cit (the Universal conscious-ness) which is the core of Reality, one can find for oneself that the objective world is only an expression of that Consciousness. Then the consciousness of the individual is steeped in the universal consciousness and the sense of difference disappears. This describes a Saktopaya for being established in the Universal Consciousness. Just as in the plasma of the peacock's egg, there is one uniform liquid without any differentiation, even so for the realization of universal Consciousness, the differentiation between subject and object, object and object disappears.

The same idea has been expressed in Laksmikaularnava in the following verse: \"O goddess, all the religious disciplines together with joyful exclamations of praise which are prescribed for the success of initiation are not worth even the sixteenth part of that awareness which is centred on you.\" In Vijnana-bhairava also, it is said: \"One should consider the entire body or the entire world simultaneously without thought-construct as a form of cons-"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"1.16.     63     ciousness, then he will experience the emergence of the highest consciousness.\" (Verse 63).

(This again is Saktopaya). NOTES The Varttika of Bhaskara splits this sutra into two different ones, viz., Suddha-tattva-sandhanat va (16) and svapada-saktih (17). The first means \"By intensive awareness of the pure principle i.e. Siva, one acquires Siva-consciousness.\" The second means \"Svapada=Siva; his Sakti is jnana and kriya\". The first refers to Siva-caitanya; the second refers to Sakti-caitanya. There is no special point in splitting the 16th sutra into two different ones.

(This is Saktopaya). The same idea has been expressed in Vijnana-bhairava in the following Verse: \"The Highest Lord is omniscient, omnipotent and omnipresent. As I have the characteristic of Siva, I am that very Siva. With this strong conviction, one becomes Siva Himself.\" (Verse, 102) (This is also Saktopaya). The same thing has also been said in the following verse in Spandakarika; The realization of oneself as Siva is the acquisition of ambrosia. This is verily the veritable seizure of the Self. This constitutes the diksa2 for Nirvana and this confers on one self the realization of one's identity with Siva.\" (11, 7).

Nirvana: nirvanam nirvrtir-dvaitapratyayalaksanaksobha-pariksayad atyantiki prasantih samvidah svasvabhavavyavasthitih (Ramakantha) i.e. Nirvana is beatitude which means absolute peace resulting from the destruciton of the mental disturbance caused by harbouring belief in dualism; it is the establishment of consciousness in its natural state. EXPOSITION The 16th sutra exhorts the aspirant to trace back the universe to its ultimate source, viz., Siva and regard it as His epiphany, nay, as Siva Himself. The present sutra now calls upon the aspirant to regard his Self as that very Siva. The 16th Sutra teaches that the objective world is in essence Siva; the 17th teaches that the Subject is also Siva. This is to be realized not by tarka or logical reasoning, not by vikalpa or thought-construct, but by vitarka or an awareness in which all tarka has disappeared by an indomitable, irresistible conviction of the Self being Siva.

This is his samadhi-sukha1 i.e. this is his delight of continuous awareness of knowership. This has been referred to in the following verse in Vijnanabhattaraka:2 \"The consciousness of object and subject is common to all the embodied ones. The Yogis have, however, this distinction that they are mindful of this relation.\"3 (verse 106). In the same book, it has also been said \"One should regard the whole world or his own body as full of the delight inherent in his Self. Simultaneously (with this world-view), he will find himself full of the highest delight which is simply due to the ambrosia (i.e. the spiritual delight) welling up in his Self.\" (Verse 65)4 The same idea has been brought out in the following verse in Spandakarika. \"This is the acquisition of ambrosia (i.e. immortality). This is the veritable seizure of the Self. This constitutes the diksa for Nirvana, and this confers on oneself the realization of one's identity with Siva.\" (ii, 7) (Now Ksemaraja gives a further interpretation of the sutra by arranging it as Samadhisukham lokanandah i.e. the continuous delight of knowership of the yogi infuses delight into the people also). \"Moreover, the delight of knowership which the yogi expe-riences by continuous repose and delight within himself ends in making his delight manifest among those people also who carefully observe him in that state (tat tadrsam). This happens by the process of transmission of delight. This is quite in agree-ment with the quotation given before from Candrajnana.5 NOTES 1.

Vijnanabhattaraka is the same as Vijnanabhairava. The word bhattaraka is a term of respect. 3. The verse means to say that for all embodied beings, there is always subject-object relationship in every bit of knowledge, but the common man is only mindful of the object, not of the subject. The yogi, however, is always mindful of the relation of the object to the subject without which relation the object could not be known at all. 4. The Self is not only cit (consciousness), but cidananda (consciousness-bliss). The surface-view of things denotes distress, disharmony, but there is wonderful harmony at the heart of the universe. That harmony, delight, bliss is the charac-teristic of consciousness which forms the warp and woof of the universe. The yogi who can penetrate beneath the surface and realize the underlying bliss will always be full of the highest delight, for his own Self is nothing but that blissful consciousness. 5. The quotation referred to is given in Sutra. 7. EXPOSITION The present sutra says that it is not necessary for the aspirant to lock himself up in a room and plunge into trance in order to realize the delight of Self. He can find this delight in the ordinary, normal course of life if he is mindful of the subject-object relation which is involved in every bit of knowledge. When a person knows a thing, he is extroverted, wholly involved in the external environment but if on the occasion of every bit of knowledge, he looks within, he will have a feel of the Self which alone makes that knowledge possible. In that feel of the Self, he will expe-rience the perennial joy of I-consciousness. This is the ever-present joy of samadhi. Further, this delight is not confined to the Yogi. He radiates it all round among the people who care to observe him in that state. His delight is infectious.

When with one-pointedness the yogi is fully united with Iccha Sakti, then he can acquire the power of creating any kind of body according to his desire.\" COMMENTARY TEXT"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"70    Siva Sutram TRANSLATION When the Yogi is united with the Will Power indicated in the 13th Sutra i.e. when he is firmly and completely at-one-ment with that (dardhyena tanmayibhavati), then through it, he can bring into being (any kind of) body according to his desire. The same fact has been indicated in Mrtyunjaya bhattaraka (i.e. Netra Tantra) in the verse, beginning with \"Thence proceeds that Power which has been indicated, as Iccha which is beyond purview and beyond the province of Maya (lit. beyond any disease, or distemper) and which expresses itself in the form of knowledge and activity\" and ending with. \"She (i.e. Para sakti) is the source (yoni) of all the gods, and of all the Saktis. She is of the nature of agni and soma1. Every thing proceeds from her.\" (VII, Verse 36-40)* The greatness and power of the intensity and fixedness of awareness of Sakti (Sakti-sandhana) has been described in Laksmikaularnava in the following and other verses. \"Without sandhana (union with intensity and fixedness of awareness), no initiation ceremony is effective, nor can there be successful completion of supernormal powers, nor can mantra, nor any stratagem of mantra succeed nor application of yoga.\"* The same point has also been made out in the following verse in Spandakarika: \"As the supporter of the universe (i.e. Siva) when eagerly entreated with desire accomplishes all the desires existing in the heart of the embodied yogi who is awake after causing the rise of the moon and the sun.2 (III. 1) * The above translation is according to the interpretation of Ksemaraja. Svami Laksmana joo interprets Yoni in the sense of indispensable means. Through her the devas (gods) realize their non-difference from Siva (Sambhavopaya). Through her the Saktis acquire spiritual realization by means of Saktopaya, and it is through her that empirical beings realize their spiritual goal by anavopaya."},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"1.19.     71     The meaning of this verse is that the supporter of the universe or the great lord (Siva) accomplishes (i.e. brings into existence) outwardly the desires (e.g. the desires of various kinds of unique creation etc.) existing in the heart of the yogi who has not yet abandoned the desire of remaining in the body. He does this by inducing in him (the yogi) the feeling of prakasa and ananda, by opening out the flow of the apana (soma i.e. moon) and prana (surya i.e. sun) currents and by arousing the sakti (i.e. samana sakti) which brings about equilibrium between apana (soma) and prana (surya). As has been shown by me in spandanirnaya, the matter ex-plained in the above verse has been used as an example to show the yogi's freedom in dream also, (as will be clear from the follow-ing verse of Spandakarika). \"So also in dream, Siva, by appearing in the central nadi (madhya) always clearly reveals the desired objects to the yogi in accordance with his entreaty.\" (111.2) NOTES 1. Agni and Soma - literally fire and moon do not mean the obvious fire and moon that we see every day. Agni and soma are symbolic terms. Agni symbolizes the prana sakti and soma symbolizes the apana sakti. The prana and apana saktis are associated with the prana and apana breaths. Prana is the breath of expiration and apana is the breath of inspiration. 2. Soma-surya (moon and sun): Here again these are symbolic words. Moon or soma symbolizes the apana sakti and sun or surya symbolizes the prana sakti. This is so in connexion with anavopaya. In connexion with Saktopaya, soma or moon symbolizes jhana sakti (knowledge) and surya or sun symbolizes Kriyasakti (activity). In connexion with Sambhavopaya, soma symbolizes Vimarsa and surya symbolizes prakasa. 3. Madhya or Central nadi (channel, nerve) is the susumna in the spinal column. EXPOSITION This sutra says that the yogi who is united with Iccha Sakti can develop certain vibhutis or supernormal powers. He can,"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"72    Siva Sutram for instance, create any kind of body that he desires. It should be borne in mind that he can do so only by being in contact with the Divine Will Power (Iccha or Para Sakti). Quoting a verse from Spandakarika, Ksemaraja describes how he can do so. In his waking condition, he has to pray to the Divine for the accomplishment of a certain desired object. Afterwards when he goes into samadhi (complete mental absorption), his prana and apana functions stop, but when he rises from the Samadhi and is in the waking condition again, the functions of his prana and apana are re-established, and he finds that his desired object has been fulfilled by the Divine Power to which he prayed and with which he was united. If the Yogi wants to experience certain supernormal objects in dream, that again is fulfilled by the Divine Power with which he is in contact. INTRODUCTION TO THE 20th SUTRA TEXT TRANSLATION Through the pre-eminence of the union with this Icchasakti other supernormal powers as desired (by him) accrue to the Yogi. This is what the next sutra says.

COMMENTARY TEXT TRANSLATION Bhuta means all existents like body, prana, objects etc. Sandhana means their addition or putting together for promoting growth etc. So bhutasamdhana means the power of joining elements of existence for augmentation or promotion of growth in some cases. Bhutaprthaktva means the power of separating of elements from body etc. for curing physical ailments, etc. Visvasanghattdh means the power of bringing together all (visva) things removed by space and time, etc. by making them objects of his own knowledge. All these powers accrue to him when he is able to unite his consciousness with Iccha Sakti as said before. This has been given in all the agamas in the chapter on Sadhana (the means of accomplishing, mastering, overpowering)."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"74    Siva Sutram In the Spandakarika such powers have been described in a well-reasoned manner in the chapter dealing with supernormal powers (vibhuti), e.g., \"Just as even a weak person proceeds to do his work by taking hold of that power (of spanda)1, so even he who is exceedingly hungry can subdue his hunger..,2 (111, 6). \"Just as a thief carries away the valuables of the house, even so depression saps away the vitality of the body. This depres-sion proceeds from ignorance. If that ignorance disappears by unmesa3, how can that depression last in the absence of its cause.4 (111, 8) \"As a thing which was dimly perceived at first in spite of the attentiveness of mind becomes clearer when observed again with all the exertion of the Will, even so that thing which existed in reality (yat paramarthena) in whichever form (yena), in which-ever place or time (yatra), in whichever way (yatha) becomes manifest immediately again (in the same form, place or time and way) to one who takes resort to the power of spanda.\"5 (111, 4 and 5). NOTES 1.1. Spanda=the Divine creative pulsation; the creative power inherent in I-consciousness. 2. The yogi acquires control over hunger, thirst etc. by spandasakti. This describes the power of controlling physical instincts. 3. Unmesa - In Saiva Yoga, unmesa means the unfoldment of spiritual consciousness by concentrating on the inner conscious-ness which is the background of all thought-process. 4. This verse describes the power of controlling all emotions. 5. This describes the power of bringing back to consciousness all past objects and events which are unknown. EXPOSITION The 19th Sutra says that the Yogi who can unite his conscious-ness with the Divine Icchasakti can acquire the power of creating any kind of body according to his desire.

Sutra - 21 Suddhavidyodayaccakresatva-siddhih. through the appearance of Suddhavidya; full acquisition of mastery over the collective whole of the Saktis. \"Full acquisition of mastery over the collective whole of the Saktis through the appearance of Suddhavidya.\" COMMENTARY TEXT"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"76    Siva Sutram TRANSLATION When he (the yogi) unites his consciousness with Sakti through intensive awareness with a desire to gain universal conscious-ness, then through the appearance of Suddhavidya, he succeeds in acquiring the supreme power of Siva in the form of complete mastery over His universal collective whole of saktis. The same has been said in Svacchanda Tantra in the following verses: \"Therefore, as there is no other Vidya (power of supreme knowledge) like her, she is the highest vidya. In this (i.e. on the appearance of this vidya) the yogi acquires the greatest qualities like omniscience, etc. all at once. She is designated Vidya, because she brings about investiga-tion of the beginningless characteristic of Siva, viz; Svatantrya Sakti, because she brings about the knowledge of the Highest Self and because she dispels all that is not that Highest Self. Established in that (i.e. the Unmana state), one can manifest the highest light3, the highest cause. If one is established in that manifest highest Light, he can attain to the state of Siva.\" (IV, verses 396, 397). The same idea has been expressed in the following verse in Spandakarika: \"When the Yogi desirous of seeing stands fixed (in concentra-tion) covering all objects with the light of his consciousness, (then he will experience the entire objective world in one sweep in himself), then what is the use of talking much, he will have the experience (of universal knowership) for himself.\" (111,11)"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"1.22.     77     NOTES 1. Suddhavidya - This Suddha vidya is not the Suddha Vidya tattva which is above the Maya tattva. Suddha vidya in this-context means that supreme consciousness in which every thing appears as Self. It is the unmana avastha. 2. Vidya - This word is derived from the root vid - which means both 'to deliberate' and 'to know'. The meaning of deliberation is brought out in and the meaning of knowledge is brought out in 3. This light is the light of the primal cit. 4. The highest light is also the highest cause, i.e. Siva. EXPOSITION 14th to 20th sutras describe limited supernormal powers acquired by the yogi who is united with Ichha Sakti. The 21st sutra describes the power of universal consciousness or cosmic consciousness acquired by the Yogi. After acquiring this power, the Yogi realizes the entire universe as his Self in one sweep, not in bits. In sutra 14, it has been shown that the Yogi feels his identity with every object. His consciousness is of the form 'Ahmidam' or 'I am this' with regard to every object separately. The 21st Sutra says that when the Yogi acquires universal consciousness, his consciousness is of the form Ahameva Sarvam i.e. 'I myself am all.' INTRODUCTION TO THE 22nd SUTRA TEXT TRANSLATION When, however, he desires only the delight of repose within himself (and not any supernormal power), then he has: Sutra - -22 Mahahradanusandhananmantraviryanubhavah."},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"78  Siva  Sutram  the great lake, the infinite reservoir of Divine Power. by mental union experience of the Supreme I-consciousness which is the generative source virya) of all mantras. \"By uniting with the great lake (the infinite reservoir of Divine Power), (he has) the experience of the Supreme I-consciousness which is the generative source (virya) of all mantras.\" COMMENTARY TEXT TRANSLATION The most venerable supreme Consciousness (para-samvit)1 positing Ichha Sakti as the primary Sakti, projecting the universe (from the most subtle) upto gross objects, is a great lake. It is so-called, because it sets in motion the entire group of khecari2 and other currents, because it is limpid (inasmuch as it reflects the entire universe in it), because it is not shrouded (i.e. though it reflects the universe, the universe is unable to cast a pall over it), because it is deep (inasmuch as it is not easily understandable)."},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"1.22.     79     It is because of its association with such and other characteristics that it is rightly called the great lake. By being mentally united with it (anusandhanat) i.e. by being inwardly aware of ceaseless identity with it, there is the expe-rience of the mantra of the supreme I-consciousness which is the generative source of all other mantras and which expands in the form of a multitude of words to be described in the sequel. This experience gleams forth as a form of one's own Self. Therefore Malinivijaya beginning with: \"She is the Sakti of the creator of the world and is said to be in constant and intimate union with Him, and becomes, O goddess, Iccha (desire) of that lord desirous to create\" (III, 5) And after showing that this Sakti appears as the entire uni-verse in the form of Matrka and Malini with a variety of fifty letters with Ichha Sakti (Divine Will Power) taking the leading part, it has described the emergence of the mantra of I-conscious-ness through that Sakti (tata eva). Thus the highest Sakti herself is the great lake. Therefore, it has been rightly said that by uniting the mind with her, the Yogi has the experience of the potency of the mantra of the nature of Matrka and Malini. This very point has been explained in another way in the following verse in Spandakarika; \"The mantras resorting to that power of Spanda (by identify-ing themselves with that power) proceed to perform their res-pective functions even as the senses of the embodied ones do.\"3 (II, 1) NOTES 1. Para samvit, parasakti, parahanta, paravak, and svatantrya are synonymous terms denoting the Supreme I-consciousness of Siva. 2. Khecari cakra and other currents - The group of power-currents referred to here are - Khecari, gocari, dikcari and bhucari. Khecari is connected with the pramata, the experient; gocari is connected with his antahkarana or the inner psychic apparatus; dikcari is connected with the bahiskarana i.e. the outer senses; bhucari is connected with the bhavas, existents or the outer objects."},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"80    Siva Sutram The sakti cakras indicate the processes of the objectificatioii of the universal consciousness. By Khecarl Cakra, one is reduced from the position of an all-knowing consciousness to that of a limited experient; by gocari cakra, he becomes endowed with an inner psychic apparatus; by dikcari cakra, he is endowed with outer senses; by bhucarl cakra, be becomes confined to bhavas or external objects. Khecarl is one that moves in kha or akasa. Kha or akasa is here a symbol of consciousness. This Sakti is called Khecari, because her sphere is kha or consciousness. Gocari is so-called, because her sphere is the inner psychic apparatus. The Sams-krta word 'go' indicates movement. The antahkarana is the seat of the senses, and sets them in motion; it is the dynamic apparatus of the spirit par excellence. Hence it is said to be the sphere of gocari. Dikcarl is the Sakti that moves in dik or space. The outer senses are concerned with space; hence they are said to be the sphere of Dikcarl. The word bhu in Bhucarl means existence. Hence existent objects are the sphere of bhucari Sakti. 3. Matrka-Malini: Matrka connotes the fifty letters of the Samskrta alphabet in the regular order. Matrka means the un-known mother i.e. the mother whose mystery is not realized. The etymology of Malini is \"malate, visvam antah dhatte\" i.e. Malini is one who holds the universe within herself. Malini connotes the fifty letters of the Samskrta alphabet in an irregular order as given below: Conclusion of the First Section COMMENTARY TEXT"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"1.22.     81     TRANSLATION This first section has been designated as the display of Sam-bhavopaya1, for the acquisition of Bhairava-consciousness which, as has been already described (in Sutra 5), is sudden emergence of the Supreme I-consciousness, which sets at naught all bondage (anava, mayiya and karma) which is of the nature of ignorance brought about by the absolute freedom of conscious-ness (the characteristic of atma expounded in Sutra 1) which makes the universe full of ambrosia through its own bliss, and which secures all the supernormal powers right up to one's establishment into that mantra1 of Supreme I-consciousness which is the generative source of all other mantras. In between, the nature of Sakti has also been described. That is with purpose of showing the power of Sambhava conscious-ness. May there be prosperity for all. Here ends the first Section of the Vimarsini Commentary on the Siva Sutras pertaining to Sambhavopaya by K$emaraja dependent on the lotus feet of the glorious Abhinavagupta, the best among the venerable great Saiva teachers.

Sambhavopaya connotes the means of spiritual realization of which the source is Sambhu (Siva) Himself and which hasbeen handed down by Him. For further details, see the Introduction. 2.

SUTRA - 1 Cittam mantrah. in this context means that by which the Highest Reality is cognised. a formula consisting of a word or a set of words address-ed to a deity. In this context, mantra means that mental awareness by which one feels one's identity with the Highest Reality enshrined in a mantra and thus saves oneself from a sense of separateness and difference. \"By intensive awareness of one's identity with the Highest Reality enshrined in a mantra and thus becoming identical with that Reality the mind itself becomes mantra.\" COMMENTARY TEXT"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"11.1.     83     TRANSLATION Citta is that which ponders over the Highest Reality.

That by which one deliberates secretly i.e. ponders inwardly as being non-different from the Highest Lord is Mantra.4 Thus that citta itself (tadeva) is mantra. The etymological interpre-tation of mantra points to its characteristic of manana i.e. ponder-ing over the highest light of I-consciousness and the other charac-teristic of trana i.e. protection by terminating the transrnigratory existence full of difference. The mind of the devotee intent on intensive awareness of the deity inherent in the mantra acquires identity with that deity and thus becomes that mantra itself. It is this mind itself which is mantra, not a mere conglomeration of various letters.

Elated with the pride of false knowledge, even devas and Gandharvas are deluded in this matter.\" (Verse 16-17).

O fair one, without her, (i.e. the sakti), they (mantras) are useless like autumnal clouds.\" In Srikanthi-Samhita, it has been said: \"If the practiser of the mantra is different from the mantra, then his mantra will never be successful. Knowledge (of the divine I-consciousness) alone is the root of all this. Without it, a mantra will never be successful\".6 In Spandakarika also the same idea has been explained in the following verse in another way: \"Not knowable as objective existents (niranjanah)7 and full of peace (santarupah)8 they (i.e. the mantras) together with the mind of their devoted practisers get absorbed in that very Spanda.9 Therefore, mantras have the characteristic of Siva10 (Sivadharminah)\" (II. 2). NOTES 1. Citta in this context is not used in the usual sense of mind, but in the sense of aspiring mind, mind aspiring for communion with the Supreme I-consciousness of Siva. 2. Prasada is a technical word of this system which will not be found in any dictionary. It is the name of the mantra sauh . It contains within itself the entire panorama of mani-festation. The mantra is formed by  The first letter represents or existence from the earth upto maya (the 31 tattvas of Saiva philosophy). is formed from the root + the suffix According to the rule of Sanskrit Grammar, the of is dropped and i.e. is formed which means 'existence.'

It refers to Parama Siva who is the fons et origo of the entire world-process. This mantra is known as hrdaya-bija the heart-seed of Siva. He who can enter into the spirit of this mantra will be identified with the Supreme I-consciousness and will be liberated. 3. Pranava is the mystic sacred syllable. According to Saivagama, there are four kinds of pranava, (1) the Saiva Pranava which is (2) the Sakta pranava which is (3) the maya pranava which is and (4) the Vedic pranava which is The pranava referred to in this sutra is the Saiva-pranava. 4. Mantra - This word is formed from the roots √ man + trai - man means to ponder over, to ruminate mentally, and trai means to protect. Mananat trayate iti mantra h i.e. mantra is that which by pondering over the Supreme I-consciousness protects or saves one from transmigratory existence. 5. This saktiravyaya or imperishable Sakti is the Sakti of Supreme I-consciousness. 6. The meaning is that the performer of the mantra should identify himself with the deity invoked in the mantra, if it is to succeed. 7. Niranjanah - According to Abhinavagupta, this means na anjyante prakatikriyante (prameya-rupena) iti niranjanah - those which can never be known as objects are niranjanah. The mantras are full of I-consciousness; therefore they are always subjects and can never be reduced to the category of objects. 8. Santarupah here means 'which remain only as pure cons­ciousness, which have negated all difference.' 9. The Spanda referred to is the power of the Supreme I-consciousness. 10. Siva-dharminah or have the characteristic of Siva means that the mantras are endowed with the qualities of Siva like omniscience, etc. EXPOSITION The main technique of Saktopaya is mantra, but mantra in this context does not mean incantation or muttering of some sacred formula.

That which saves one by pondering over the light of Supreme I-consciousness is mantra. The divine Supreme I-consciousness is the dynamo of all the mantras. What is that which ponders over the central significance of every mantra? It is Citta. But it is not any and every China. It is the Citta (the individual mind) that is oriented towards the Divine, that is intent on seeking its own source. This citta itself is mantra. The key of Saktopaya is jnana.

It is this close application which becomes effective in fulfilment i.e. in bringing about identity of the conternplator of the mantra with the deity inherent in it. The same point has been made out in the following verses in Tantrasadbhava: \"As a kite in the sky seeing a piece of meat, flying back with a spring draws it immediately towards itself with natural onset, O dear one, even so the great yogi should draw forth his mind to the light of the Self. As an arrow placed on a bow runs after its target, if the bow is stretched with intensive effort, even so, O fair one, the know-ledge of the Self expands through intensive awareness.\" Elsewhere also it has been said. \"Apprehension of the Self constitutes the real being of the mantra.\" In the above verse, the word manah should be treated as an objective case, and the expression tadvat (even so) means to say that the great yogi, by means of spontaneous effort, draws the mind to bindu. i.e. should make the mind attain to the highest light (the light of Supreme I-consciousness). The meaning of the last line of the verse is, \"Even so, bindu i.e. the highest light (of Self) runs i.e. expands by uccara (maintenance of full awareness) resulting from spontaneous emergence of quest.

She (Para sakti or Paravak) characterized by nine classes12 of letters is known in nine ways. O goddess, she pervades the five mantras13 like Sadyojata etc. successively. Therefore, O leadress of all the gods, she is described in five ways. She appears in the twelve vowels14, therefore is she said to be existing in twelve. From 'a' to 'ksa', she exists in fifty varieties.15 In the heart, she is said to be of one atom. In throat, she is of two atoms; always, situated in the root of the tongue, she is to be known as having three atoms.16 In the front of the tongue, there is successful production of letters. There is no doubt about this. In this way is the produc-tion of words. All existents moving and unmoving, are per-vaded by words.\""},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"11.3.     93     By all these statements the particular chapter in Tantrasad-bhava intends to show that Matrka is a manifestation of Paravak who is only a sakti of the highest Bhairava. Therefore as it has been said that all letters come into being because of the varieties brought about by the conjunction of the extension of Jyestha, Raudri and Amba saktis, it is the Supreme I-conscious-ness (vidyasarira-satta), as already explained, which is the secret of all the mantras which are embodied in the conjunction of letters. In every Agama, this is the intention of the statement that mantras arise by means of the extension of Matrka and Malini. As the Siva-sutras are a sort of compendium of the essentials of the occult Agamas, therefore have I undertaken all this labour to show their agreement with the Agamas. So none need criticise me (for being prolix). If even in spite of all the agree-ment with the Agamas that I have shown, the occult meaning is not understood, one should betake oneself to the reverential service of a good spiritual director. This purport of the Sutra has been shown in the following two verses of Spandakarika. \"Resorting to the power of Spanda, mantras become endued with the power of omniscience and perform their functions just as the senses of the embodied ones do. Not knowable as objective existents (niranjandh) and full of peace, they together with the mind of their devoted performers get absorbed in that very spanda. Therefore, they have the characteristic of Siva. (II, 1 and 2). NOTES 1. The letter 'a' ( ) representing anuttara, the highest Sakti. That is the origin of all letters. 2.

The vindus or points of iccha, jnana and kriya now form a straight line. This is known as Rekhini (one having a rekha or straight line). There are two vindus or points, one below and one at the top of this straight line. The lower vindu is that of Sakti, the higher one is that of Siva. 8.

Pasyanti is that where the word and the object are identical. The division bet-ween word and object has not yet arisen. In this, there is only the light of consciousness. Therefore, this is the stage of vision, and that is why this sakti is known as pasyanti. She consists of one anu. She is said to be existing in the heart. In the Madhyama stage, though the division between the word and object has started, it is not fully pronounced yet. Madhyama occupies an intermediate stage between Pasyanti and Vaikhari. That is why she is called Madhyama. She is of two anus and resides in the throat. In the Vaikhari stage, the object is com-pletely separated from the word. The word Vikhara means body. The body is the seat of gross speech. Therefore, gross speech is known as Vaikhari. She is said to exist in the root of the tongue and consists of three anus.

In a general way, it has been said that mantra is the chief Saktopaya for self-realization."},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"96    Siva Sutram The first Sutra tells us what mantra really means. \"That by which one recognises one's identity with Siva\" is what is meant by mantra. It is not the letters which constitute mantra, but the realization of oneself as identical with the deity invoked in the mantra and finally with the supreme I-consciousness which is the core of all mantras. The purpose of mantra is to make the mind God-oriented. Indeed such a mind itself is mantra. The third sutra corroborates the main idea of the first sutra with an amazing wealth of details. It begins by saying that Vidyasarirasatta constitutes the secret of mantra. This vidyasarirasatta is the awareness of that supreme I-consciousness of Siva which is identical with the universe. The origin of all mantras is this divine I-consciousness and it is to this divine I-consciousness that all mantras have to be directed. The mantras consist of letters. Reproducing a long quotation from Tantrasadbhava, the commentary on this sutra goes on to say that the supreme I-consciousness in its creative aspect is known as Parasakti or Paravak. This Para-sakti is the sakti-kundalini which goes into cosmic sleep after the dissolution of the manifested world. Then there is churning process between Siva and Sakti; in consequence the first letter 'a' comes into being. This' a' is the origin of all the lettters. So the letters of the mantra are not merely dead symbols, they point to the I-consciousness of Siva which is their origin. It is, therefore to this I-consciousness that the mind should be directed in each mantra.

This point has also been made out in the following verse in Spandakarika: \"From this (i.e. unmesa) there appears in a short time vindu i.e. light (between the eye-brows), nada i.e. unstruck sound of various kinds, rupa, i.e. different kinds of forms even in darkness, rasa, i.e. pleasant taste in the mouth even in the absence of any thing edible. To the Yogi whose sense of identification with the body has not yet disappeared, these (supernormal experiences) act at once only as disturbance (in his progress of Yoga)\" (111,10). EXPOSITION Bhaskara has given this sutra differently in his Varttika. He reads it thus -He inter-prets it thus - Garbhe i.e. in the bliss of the light of Supreme consciousness. When the mind is turned towards this light, then there is the highest development of the mind i.e. the mind is full of bliss. This being so, there is disappearance (svapnah i.e. disappearance like a dream) of avidya or primal ignorance.

What kind of Khecari? It is a state of Siva who as the pos-sessor of that state is the lord of consciousness. It is Self's delight welling up from within. This Khecari is not of the usual sort which is merely a disposition of certain parts of the body in a particular form as described in the following verse: \"A Yogi should be seated in a Padmasana posture erect like a stick and should then fix his mind (lit. the chief of the senses) on the navel and should lead the mind upto khatraya or the three saktis situated in the space in the head. Holding the mind in that state, he should move it forward immediately with the above. Disposed in this psycho-physical posture the great Yogi acquires the supernormal power of moving (flying) in the sky. Khecari is rather as described in the following verse: \" he (the yogi) reaches the highest state in actuality always by the Sakta process (by following the occult process of Matrka from 'a' to 'ksa'). Only when his consciousness moves in all beings, only then is it genuine Khecari.'\" Thus Khecari as defined in Tantrasadbhava is the highest form of consciousness. Accordingly in this Yoga, it is only the emer-gence of the essential nature of the divine consciousness by sett-ing at naught all disturbances caused by maya that has the nature of creating difference. It is this alone which constitutes the potency of mantras and the potency of mudra. The same thing has been said in Kulacudamani in the follow-ing verse: \"There is only one seed-mantra (of Supreme I-consciousness) which pervades the entire manifestation; there is only one"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"11.5.     101     mudra, viz, Khecari which pertains to highest Bhairava. He in whom these two appear is established in that state which transcends the merely immobile condition (i.e. he is established in Spanda which is the creative pulsation\"). In Spandakarika the potency of mudra has been hinted at only in the exposition of the nature of the potency of mantra. In the following half verse, however, Spandakarika indirectly indicates the nature of Khecari mudra described in Cudamani, though there it has been described from another point of view. \"When his agitation ceases then will accrue to him the highest state.\" (1,9) NOTES 1. Khecari: This literally means that which moves in the sky or empty space. Kha or empty space is a symbol of conscious-ness. One of the meanings of Khecara is Siva. Khecari mudra, therefore, means a mudra pertaining to Siva or Sivavastha as the above sutra puts it. Mudra: Lit, means a seal, a token of divine attribute impress-ed on the body; intertwining of the fingers in a particular way; a disposition of certain parts of the body in a particular shape. Khecari Mudra is that particular disposition of the psycho-physical posture which enables the experient to move freely in the expanse of consciousness. Khecari mudra is of various sorts. Saiva agama does not set any store by mudra in the sense of disposition of certain parts of the physical body. It interprets mudra in a higher sense in three ways, viz. (1) mudam (harsam) rati (dadati) - that which gives muda or joy, (2) mum dravayati - that which dissolves mu or bondage (3) mudrayati iti - that which seals up (the universe into turiya). The ideal of mudra is expressed in the following verse by Abhinavagupta: (Tantraloka-32nd ahnika) That which enables living beings to acquire Self-realization in all the states of the embodied ones is Mudra. By dehadvarena"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"102    Siva Sutram is meant all the bodily states - waking (physical body) dreaming (subtle body) deep sleep (paradeha or the causal body). So Khecari mudra in Saiva agama means a state of universal consciousness which is the state of Siva. 2. Khatrayam - Lit, it means the triad of space or void. The triad referred to is Sakti, Vyapini, and Samana, extending from the middle of the eyebrows up to Brahmarandhra. EXPOSITION This sutra says that the potency of mantra or of mudra con-sists in enabling the aspirant to aquire Khecarl which is Siva -consciousness. This is possible only when one realizes the secret of mantra which is the Supreme I-consciousness of Siva, the I-conscious-ness that is also the world-consciousness.

In Spandakarika, such matters being well known have not been treated. But in a way this matter has also been treated there in the last verse which is as follows: \"I offer my homage to that wonderful teaching of my guru, serving as a boat in crossing the fathomless ocean of doubts and full of such words as express wonderful, uncommon ideas.\" (IV 1).

According to the process described in Paratrimsaka etc. the first aspect (spanda) of anuttarasakti is the Supreme I-Cons-ciousness which assumes the form of akula1 i.e. that of which the body (kula) is 'a' (the letter ). (This 'a' is the expression of Cit-sakti of Siva). As there is further expansion of the world-manifesting-power of aham or I-consciousness, ananda sakti (bliss) comes into play which assumes the form of the letter 'a' , then bringing forward iccha sakti (will power), that I-consciousness displays 'i' in the aksubdha2 state of iccha and i in its ksubdha state which is an expression of isana or isitri (the power of mastery); then with jhana sakti in its aksubdha state, she displays unmesa (knowledge) which is represented by the letter 'u' i i and in the ksubdha state of jnana sakti displays unata (deficiency in jnana as mere jnana) which becomes the cause of objective appearance. This is represented by the letter 'u' ,. (After this there is a slight reverse movement in the progressive manifestation of the universe). Just as in the flash of lightning there is at first merely a faint glimmer, and then there is more bright light, so 'i' of aksubdha icchasakti combining with 'r' becomes (r); and 'i' of Ksubdha iccha combining more firmly with 'r' becomes ; 'r' is the seed letter of 'fire'. So also 'i' of aksubdha iccha sakti combining with 'l' becomes 'l' and 'i' of ksubdha iccha sakti combining more firmly with 'l' (becomes ,;'r' is the seed letter of 'earth' (fixity, steadiness). The letters 'r' and 'l' are only implicitly heard sounds (they are not actually produced letters). Inasmuch as they i.e. 'r' and 'l', the seed letters of fire and earth are mere subtle objects of iccha sakti and are imposed on it merely by the sound3 of 'r' and 'l' and inasmuch as these four letters ' are assimilated to their own light (i.e. they rest only in themselves), they are said to be amrta (imperishable) letters (i.e. they are not subject to any change; they do not give rise to other letters). As they are coloured merely by semblance of objectivity,"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"11.7.     107     so they are unable to produce any other letter. These four arc therefore, designated eunuch vowels4. The previously mentioned anuttara i.e. the letter 'a' . and ananda i.e. the letter 'a' combining with 'i' of iccha form the triangular6 e vowel. With the combination of anuttara (i.e. the letter .) ananda (i.e. the letter ) and unmesa (i.e. the letter there is the for-mation of the letter 'o' which denotes the inclusion of kriya sakti. With the combination of the previously mentioned two letters (i.e. with or + there is the formation of the hexagonal letter6 - and with the combination of 'a' or 'a' and 'o' there is the formation of the trident7 'au' In the formation of the letter there is the union of all the three saktis viz, iccha, jnana and kriya with the predominance of kriya in its clearest form. Then the Supreme I-consciousness expresses the undivided knowledge of the universe in the form of a dot (yindu) in the letter 'am' 8. It shows further the visarga stage in the form of two (perpendicular) dots indicating simultaneously inner and outer manifestation.9 Thus the creative I in its inner awareness shows the entire panorama of manifestation only as resting within the anuttara state and from the standpoint of outer awareness exhibits the expansion of a group of five tattvas in each group of five letters, through a, i, u, r, 1, i l Saktis. Each group of five letters from ka to ma expresses tattvav from prthivi upto purusa.10 Each of these (a, i, etc.) has five Saktis.11 Therefore from each of these there arises a group of five (letters). With these very saktis together with the niyati and other coverings of maya which are located within the Purusa or the limited experient, the I-consciousness displays those letters which are known as antahstha.12 (i.e. ya, ra, la, va) in Siksa.13 Their names as antahstha (i.e. located within) are justified because they are the products of the mayic forces located within man (pumbhumau)"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"108    Siva Sutram They are known as dharana in the agama scriptures (amnayesu), because they hold the universe by seizing the consciousness of the subjects (knowers). Above Maya (tadupari) with the disappearance of difference and the appearance of non-difference with her essential nature, the I-consciousness (with the zealous heat of this identity-cons-ciousness) displays the four usma letters (viz., Sa, Sa, Sa, and ha)14 [The word usma means heat, passion, eagerness]. In these usma letters she (I-consciousness) shows perfect amrta letter15 (sa) occurring as the penultimate one of the entire manifestation of letters and after that at the end she displays the prana bija (ha letter) in order to make one realize the fact that this universe consisting of words (vacaka) and their objects (vacya) and of the form of expansion of sadadhva16 is brought to its completion in the letter ha (andhata-maya17) by the anuttara sakti. Therefore the essence of the supreme virility of the great mantra in the form of the Supreme I-consciousness consists in showing by means of pratydhdra18 that the universe lies in the womb of 'a' and 'ha' (aham or I) which are symbolic of anuttara (a) and anahata (ha) or in other words of Siva and Sakti19. As has been said by Utpaladeva, our great grand teacher. \"The I-concept connotes resting of the light of consciousness within itself. Inasmuch as it excludes all (external) expectancy, it is known as Repose (within itself) or Composure. It is also absolute freedom, main doership and sovereign power.\" (Ajada-pramatr-siddhi, 22-23). Thus so far what has been described as the essence of Matrka that very thing has been shown at the end by the Kutabija20 (ksa letter) which is a combination of ka and sa and which results by the combination of the essence of anuttara (i.e. 'ka'21) and the essence of visarga (i.e. sa). So enough of expressing the mysterious. Thus sarnbodha means full enlightenment consisting of communion with one's Self which is of the nature of conscious-ness-bliss. Matrka-cakra means the collective whole (cakra) of the previously described anuttara, ananda, iccha and other saktis connected with the Matrka the efficacy of which has been described in the scriptures in the following words \"There is no knowledge higher than that of Matrka.\""},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"11.7.     109     This matter has been dealt with here merely by way of brief indication. It has been expressed in detail by my teacher (Abhinavagupta) in his commentary on Paratrinisaka, Tantraloka etc. It has been said in Siddhamrta also: \"That divine consciousness in its form as creative energy is known as Kundalinl. She is the seed and life of22 all . From her is produced the group of three letters, viz; dhruva i.e. anuttara indicating 'a' iccha (indicating 'i') and unmesa, (indicat-ing 'u'). From this triad are produced the various letters, e.g. a' from 'a' , 'I' from 'i', u from 'u' etc. right up-to the visarga aspect (i.e. ). The letters from Ka ( to sa are produced by the crea-tive energy (visarga)23 of Siva. That visarga is manifested in five ways, one outside (in the form of the expansion of the uni-verse), and four inside (1) in the heart (2) in nada i.e. in the throat (3) in the great stage (parame pade) i.e. between the two eye-brows and (4) in Brahrnarandhra Thus it pervades from the heart up to the top of the skull. Mantras devoid of the initial letter 'a' and the final letter 'ma' (i.e. (aham) or I) are like autumnal clouds (i.e. just as autumnal clouds do not rain and so are useless, even so such mantras are useless). The essential characteristic of a real spiritual director is that he should explain (to his disciples) the mantra beginning with 'a' and ending with 'ma' (aham). That sage, Bhairava-like, god-like guru deserves worship like myself (this is addressed to Parvati by Siva). As he (the guru) feels even a hymn of praise (sloka) or a laudatory song (gatha) or any thing else as connected with the Supreme I-consciousness, therefore, knowing everything in that way (i.e. as connected with I-consciousness), he perceives everything as a mantra. The same idea has been expressed in another way in Spanda karika: \"That operative energy of Siva (i.e. the divine spanda) existing in the limited experient (i.e. the empirical individual) binds the individual (when unrealized). When, however, it is realized as"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"110    Siva Sutram forming a path to Siva who is one's own Self, it secures supreme power.\" (111,16). NOTES 1. Akula: Kula is the state in which Siva and Sakti remain in indistinguishable unity. Akula is a state different from it i.e. it is a state of Siva. This is one meaning of akula, Secon-dly, kula means body. . Akula means that of which the body is the letter 'a\\(which is the expression of Cit-Sakti). So there is a double entendre in the word akula. It is impossible to bring this out in the translation. 2. Aksubdha and Ksubdha: Aksubdha (lit, unagitated) is the state in which Iccha Sakti has simply decided to manifest exter-nally, but is still unaffected by objectivity. Ksubdha (i.e. agitated) is the state when Iccha Sakti is coloured by objectivity. The same holds true of the aksubdha and ksubdha states of unmesa. 3. merely by the sound of V, ')'. These letters are only heard as sound, they are not actually produced. 4. They are said to be Sandha or eunuch, because they are neither purely vowels nor purely consonants; they have a sem-blance of both, just as a eunuch has the semlance of both male and female. Secondly they are called eunuch because they are unable to produce any other letter. 5. This is called triangular vowel  because firstly the letter 'e' is written in Sarada Script as N (indicating three angles) and secondly because all the three Saktis cit', ananda and iccha operate in its formation. 6. 'ai' is called or hexagonal, because as written in Sarada script, it forms six angles. 7. is called or i.e. trident, because all the three Saktis, iccha, jhana and kriya are present in this in the clearest form. 8. The idea is that the dot or vindu indicates that in spite of all these projections or emanations in the form of a, a, i. i, etc. the anuttarasakti remains the highest knower or subject. The Sanskrit word vindu means both 'dot' and knower. Vetti iti vinduh i.e. Vindu means one who knows.

The two dots of visarga (:) indicate the truth that from the point of view of Sakti symbolized by the lower dot there is an expansion of an outer world, but at the same time from the point of view of Siva symbolized by the upper dot, the entire universe rests in the 1-Consciousness of Siva. 10. Each group of five letters as vacaka (i.e. names) has a corresponding group of tattvas as vacya (i.e. objects of those names). This will be clear from the following table: Sl. No. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5.

A doubt may arise as to how from each Sakti, say from only one 'a' of anuttara, there arises a group of five letters, viz, ka, kha, ga, gha, ha, similarly how from 'i' of iccha, there arises a group of five letters, viz, ca, cha, ja, jha, na and so on. To remove this doubt, Ksemaraja says that each of these i.e. 'a' of"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"112    Siva Sutram anuttara, 'i' of iccha etc. has all the five Saktis, e.g., the 'a' of anuttara has all the five saktis of cit, ananda, iccha, jnana, and kriya; similarly 'i' of iccha has iccha, cit, ananda, jnana and kriya and so on. Inasmuch as each of these has the power of five saktis, therefore from each of these, there arises a group of five letters as vacaka (indicator) and a corresponding group of five tattvas asvacya (indicated or objects). 12. Antahstha varnas are ya, ra, la, va. Ksemaraja thinks that they are known as antahstha because they are determined by maya and her Kancukas (coverings) which operate from within the mind of man. Thus 'ya' is determined by niyati; 'ra' is determined by kala, 'la' by raga and viaya, and 'va' by Maya and Kala. Abhinavagupta, however, says in Tantraloka 3rd Ahnika, (verses 154 to 156) that when ksubdha and aksubdha Iccha sakti is oriented towards anuttara (which is cit), then it produces 'ya'. When which is identified with Iccha sakti is oriented towards anuttara, then ra appears, and when which is identified with Iccha Sakti is oriented towards anuttara then la appears. Simi-larly when unmesa is oriented towards anuttara, va appears. In the same Ahnika in verse 158 Abhinavagupta says that since the formation of these antahstha letters (ya, ra, la, va) is due to iccha and unmesa saktis, and since these are inner (antah) forces and are identified with the pramata (the subject), the letters ya, ra, la, va are rightly called antahstha. The Siksa works, however, call them antahstha, because they lie in between vowel and consonant i.e. they are neither purely vowel nor purely consonant. 13. Siksa - the science of phonetics. 14. Abhinavagupta says that Iccha Sakti appears in three forms, viz., 'i', V and '}' and these inspired by the inner light of Self appear outwardly as sa, sa, and sa. 'Ha' is only a gross form of visarga. Sa, sa, sa, represent Suddha vidya, Isvara, and Sadd-siva respectively. 15.

According to Saiva Philosophy, the manifestation of the universe by Siva is not a derognation from His essential"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"11.7.     113     nature, but a fulfilment of it. The four letters are called simply amrta without any adjective, because they only rest within themselves and do not produce anything. Besides 'sa' represents the state of Sadasiva. Hence its importance. 16. Sadadhva: The universe may be said summarily to consist of varna, mantra and paaa on the vacaka or the subjective side and (1) kala (2) tattva (3) and bhuvana on the vacya or objective side. Sat means six and adhva means course or path. 17. 'Ha' is a form of Siva's visarga sakti. So 'ha' in its subtle form is constantly being sounded inside each creature without any effort on its part. It is called by Abhinavagupta (T. III.. verse 146). Jayaratha comments on this as follows: (pp. 142-148) This visarga pertaining to is only a vibration inside, not uttered in the form of a distinct letter. Again on p. 149. Jayaratha quotes the following verse: No one (deliberately) pronounces it, nor can any body prevent its being sounded (as an inner vibration). This is self -sounded in the breast of beings. It is spontaneous, ceaseless sound going on inside without utterance, without effort on the part of any one. Hence it is called anahatamaya i.e. not struck or uttered by the vocal organs. 'Ha' indicates sakti. As such, it is the source of all prana 18. Pratyahara: This word has been used here in the technical sense of Sanskrit Grammar. It means the 'comprehension of several letters or affixes into one syllable, effected by combining the first letter of a sutra with the final indicatory letter'. The pratyahara of 'a' the first letter and 'ha' the final letter is 'aha' which suggests 'aham', meaning 'I' or Self. 'Aha' includes all"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"114    Siva Sutram the letters of the Sanskrit alphabet, and since each letter is in-dicative of an object, 'aha' suggests the sum total of all objects i.e. the universe. The Philosophical truth that is pointed out is that the entire universe lies in Siva or Highest Reality in an undifferentiated state. The full word for I in Sanskrit is 'aham' written as with a vindu or dot on the letter 'ha'. This vindu or dot is full of high philosophical significance. In the definite calm of anuttara or Highest Reality, there arises a metaphysical Point of Stress. This is known as vindu. In this, the universe to be is gathered up into a Point. This vindu is ghanibhuta sakti, the creative force compacted into a Point. It is as yet undifferentiated into subjects and objects. It is the cidghana or massive consciousness in which lie potentially in an undifferentiated mass all the worlds and beings to be manifested. The dot or vindu on 'ha' joins 'a' and 'ha' into oneness and shows that all manifestation though appearing emanated and different is actually resting in siva and is not different from Him. 'A' represents Siva and 'ha' represents Sakti, the vindu on 'ha' represents the fact that though Siva is manifested right up to the earth through Sakti he is not divided thereby, he remains undivided whole. Vindu means that which knows. It is derived from the root 'vid' which means 'to know'. Vetti iti vinduh. Vindu is that which knows. That is why Abhina-vagupta calls it avibhagah prakaso yah. Avibhagah prakaso yah sa vinduh paramo hi nah (1. Ill A, verse III). \"That which is undivided light, that which in spite of all differentiation does not change, remains unaffected and does not deviate from its inherent oneness is for us Vindu.\" 19. of represents Siva and 'ha' of this word represents Sakti. 20. Kutabija - The word kuta means highest, most excellent, mysterious. Kutabija is a mystical name of the letter ksa . Kuta is a technical name for a letter which results from the combination of two halanta letters. Here the two halanta letters are 'k' and 's' . Their combination results in ksa . , Therefore 'ksa' is called a Kuta letter. 21. Anuttara is said to be the essence of ka class of tetters,"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"11.7.     115     because as described before, 'ka' is formed by the vowel 'a' which is the symbol of anuttara. 22. In the unmanifest state, Kundalini is bija i.e. the seed of all manifestation; in the manifest state she is jiva i.e. the life of all. The word Kundalini means the divine creative Energy - Visarga-Sakti of Siva's I-consciousness. It is coiled in three and a half folds. One fold represents the objective aspect (prameya) of the Supreme I-Consciousness, another fold represents the pramana or knowledge aspect, the third fold represents the pramata or the subjective aspect; the remaining half represents prama aspect which contains within itself both the subjective and the objective aspect in indistinguishable unity. When the para-sakti (the Highest creative Sakti of Siva) though creative, is not yet functioning but lies like a sleeping serpent coiled in three and a half folds, she is known as Sakti Kundalini. When she is oriented externally to manifest life, she is known as Prana Kundalini. At this stage, Samvit or consciousness is trans-ferred into prana or life. This Prana Kundalini is present in every living being. In the reverse movement back from life to consciousness when she assumes her original form of conscious-ness, she is known as Para Kundalini. At this stage, there is the delightful unity-consciousness of I and the world, of Self and not-Self. Everything appears as a form of T. In the long verse quoted from Siddhamrta, the author shows how the creative Sakti-Kundalini passes into the stage of Prana-Kundalini by manifesting both vacaka (words) and Vacya (their objects) and how her Visarga Sakti (creative energy) manifests itself in human life, and finally exhorts all aspirants to recapture their original divine I-consciousness from which alone the visarga sakti in the form of Kundalini started the play of life. Thus it gives all the three aspects of Kundalini - (1) Sakti, (2) Prana and (3) Para Kundalini. 23. Visarga: It literally means emanation, manifestation, projection. The verse says: In this context visarga means visarga sakti, the projecting mani-festing, creative energy of the Divine, the supreme Creative energy of anuttara (the Highest Reality)."},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"116  Siva  Sutram  There are three aspects of this visarga. (1) (para-visarga) is (a) It is known as anandavisarga, It is sambhava visarga showing abheda or non-difference. (2) (parapara-visarga) is : It is sakta visarga showing bhedabheda i.e. identity in the midst of difference. The lower dot of : denotes the expansion of the creative energy into the universe, indicating a difference from Siva; the upper dot points to the identity of the universe with Siva. Hence it is parapara. The pharse signifies this parapara aspect of visarga. (3) (apara visarga) is (ha). This is also known as bheda visarga, showing bheda or difference. It is also known as anava visarga. It only refers to the manifestation of the uni-verse without making any reference to its source. EXPOSITION Manifestation consists of vacaka and vacya or nama and rupa, words and objects. At the highest level of Reality they are one. In manifestation, they bifurcate into vacaka and vacya. In manifestation, the vacaka is the subjective side and the vacya is the objective side. All human activities are carried on through vacaka or words. Vacaka consists of Matrka. Matrka means letters or lettered sound. It is through matrka, therefore, that all human activi-ties are carried on. So long as the mystery of the matrka is not understood, we are only involved in the 'fret and fever' of life. \"We nod and hurry and pass by, and do not for once possess our soul.\" If a man wants to understand the mystery of life, if he wants to turn to the source of his being, he will have to understand the mystery of Matrka. Matrka not properly understood only confines us to the feverish activities of life, and thus becomes a source of bondage. If properly understood, she becomes our saviour. The realization of the mysteries of Matrka is most important for the aspirant who is in quest of the source of his being. The Saktopaya deals primarily with mantra. Mantra consists of words or letters, in other words, Matrka. It is, therefore, of utmost importance for the aspirant to understand Matrka and her host of saktis."},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"11.7.     117     This sutra, therefore, exhorts the aspirant to have sambodha -full realization, perfect enlightenment of Matrka Cakra, of the occult meaning of lettered sound which is the warp and woof of mantra. The Sutra tells us that all letters are only an expression of Paravak or Parasakti or Parahanta or Anuttara sakti - the Cosmic Creative Stress, the Spanda or pulsation of Supreme Creative Consciousness known as Siva, This Creative Power of Siva in its cosmic aspect is also known as Sakti Kundalini. There are five main Saktis of Siva, viz., Cit or ANUTTARA Sakti, Ananda, Iccha, Jnana and Kriya. The anuttara sakti expresses itself in the vowel 'a' ; the ananda sakti expresses itself in the vowel 'a' . Iccha Sakti expresses itself in two ways, viz. 'i' and 'i' ) and and the jnana Sakti expresses itself in V and 'u' | and with the permutation and combination of 'a', 'i', 'u' in various ways, the Kriya Sakti expresses itself in V, 'ai', 'o', 'au' i . The dot expresses the unification of all manifestation into one conscious-ness of Siva and the visarga (two dots one above the other) points to Siva's inner rest and the external expansion of His Sakti in the form of the universe. These vowels represent the inner life of Siva. Of all the vowels, a the representative of anuttara sakti is the most important. As Jayaratha puts it in his commentary on Tantraloka (Ahnika III, p. 120) \"A ) resides in all the letters as their inner controller.\" The vowels  give rise to the various consonants which symbolize the various tattvas from earth to Sadasiva. It is Siva, therefore, who dwells in the heart of all the letters and all the creatures and expresses all manifestation as identical with Himself. Niskala or Parama Siva is the transcendent Siva, above all manifestation: Siva is His first creative pulsation in whom arises I-Consciousness-(aham). This aham or I-consciousness known as vimarsa is like a mirror of rays of light which contains all the varnas or letters (vacakas) and vacya (objects) in a latent, incipient form just as the plasma of a peacock's egg contains the variegated plumage of the peacock in a latent form."},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"118    Siva Sutram The 'a' of aham symbolizes anuttara (the Highest Reality) and the ha of this 'aham' symbolizes Visarga Sakti. Thus 'aham' is the matrix of fifty letters from 'a' to 'h'. This 'aham' is the para matrka sakti which contains within itself iccha, jnana and kriya. From this arise icchatmaka pasyanti matrka, jnanatmaka madhyama matrka and kriyatmaka vaikhari matrka. This 'aham' contains the entire vacaka and vacya universe in a latent form. A knowledge of the Matrka cakra shows how all letters and all tattvas from earth upto Sadasiva have evolved simultaneously from aham. The collective whole of saktis (cakra) of Matrka pertains to iccha, jnana and kriya saktis of Siva which evolve the world of words and objects. The sambodha or clear realization of the significance of Matrka cakra leads the aspirant to realize that his real I is the blissful I-consciousness of Siva. This real I-consciousness is the secret of mantra. It liberates the aspirant from his pseudo I-consciousness, from his psycho-somatic self, and he now knows himself as identical both with Siva and His manifestation in the form of the universe.

As has been said in Vijnana-bhairava, \"One should pour into the fire of the Highest Consciousness all the elements, senses, and the objects of sense together with mind (that creates all these divisions). This is real homa (obla-tion). The (Self-inquiring) consciousness is the ladle (with which this oblation is to be performed).\" (Verse 149). In Timirodghata also it is said, \"By the extinction of attachment in one who is dear, who is a friend, who is a relation, a donor, or who is greatly beloved, the Sakti of cidakasa rises higher.\" Here the main purport is the extinction of the sense of the body as the Self. In the Bhagavadgita also, it has been said,"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"120    Siva Sutram \"In the deep fire of yoga pertaining to self-control lighted with clear perception of reality do the yogis offer as oblation all the activities of the senses, and prana.\" (IV, 27). (Apara in this verse has been explained as agadha (deep) by Abhinavagupta). in the Spandakarika also the same idea has been expressed in the following verse: \"When the disturbed condition of his mind in considering the Self as not-self and the not-Self as Self disappears, then will accrue to him the highest state (i.e. the realization of the Spanda principle\". (1, 9) Here Ksobha means the idea of the body etc as the Self. This is how Bhatta Kallata has explained it in his commentary. INTRODUCTION TO THE 9th SUTRA TEXT TRANSLATION And of such a yogi, SUTRA - 9 Jnanam annam. limited knowledge which is the cause of bondage; food to be devoured. \"The limited, vitiated knowledge which is the cause of bondage is the food to be devoured.\" COMMENTARY TEXT"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"11.9.    121    TRANSLATION \"Limited knowledge is the cause of bondage\" which has been mentioned previously (under 1,2) becomes his food, because such limited knowledge is devoured by the Yogi. This is in full conformity with what has been adduced earlier as testimony in the following verse of Bhargasikha. \"When he (the yogi) realizes his real Self, then he devours death, (death of the gross body), kala - the presiding Spirit of death, the multitude of activities, all changes for the worse, identification with the knowledge of objects, all thought-cons-tructs of non-difference, and difference.\" (The Sutra may be explained in another way) or his knowledge of the realization of Self is food inasmuch as by affording full satisfaction it becomes the means of rest in one's own Self. It has been said in Vijnanabliairava: \"By adopting any one of the means for Self-realization, the sense of fulfilment that occurs from day to day is, in this matter, a satisfaction denoting highest perfection.\" (Verse 148). The word yukti or means indicates here the knowledge of hundred and twelve kinds of yoga.

He should consider everything as non-different from Siva. Then he will not be afflicted with anything.\" (Ill, 12). EXPOSITION Ksemaraja interprets this sutra in two ways. In the first interpretation, he takes jnana in the sense of 'limited knowledge', and annam in the sense of 'being devoured' and says that all limited knowledge should be devoured by the yogi i.e. all limited knowledge should be reduced to sameness with the Self. In the second interpretation, he takes jnanam in the sense of svarupa-jnana (knowledge of Self), and annam in the sense of 'food that gives satisfaction' and interprets the sutra as saying that Self-knowledge is the food that gives highest satisfaction. Bhaskara in his Varttika interprets jnana as svarupa-jnana (knowledge of Self), and so his interpretation of this satra agrees with the second interpretation given above. INTRODUCTION TO THE 10th SUTRA TEXT TRANSLATION When the yogi is not always on the alert, then even in the case of one who has acquired knowledge of the Self, there is, on the flagging of attention.

Bhaskara, in his Varttika, interprets this sutra differently. According to Ksemaraja, Vidya here means suddha vidya, but according to Bhaskara, vidya here means knowledge, common to the ordinary folk of the world. So Bhaskara interprets the sutra thus: \"When the knowledge common to the ordinary folk of the world dissolves (on the realization of one's true Self) then the previously apprehended delusive knowledge of the objects of the world is remembered only like a dream.\" COMMENTARY TEXT"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"124    Siva Sutram TRANSLATION On the samhara i.e. on the submergence of the previously mentioned Suddha Vidya which cannotes expansion of spiritual wisdom there is appearance of all kinds of pluralistic thought-constructs which arise from the gradual disappearance of the impressions of Suddha-Vidya. Darsanam means 'there occurs clear emergence (of such thought-constructs). It has been said in Malini-vijaya: \"This is instructed by Sankara (in the form of a guru) when he is fully pleased. But even when somehow the instruction is imparted, the impression of such knowledge does not remain.\" Beginning with the above, Malinivijaya says further, \"Even when one has obtained merely limited powers (vasanamatra labhe-pi) but is not mindful, tempters who put obstacles in the progress of yoga egg him on to transient pleasures.\" The same idea has been well set forth in Spandakarika in the following verse; \"Otherwise (i.e. if he is not established in his real nature), Nature as is characteristic of her is quite free in presenting objects to him both in waking and dreaming states in the same way as she does in the case of ordinary worldly persons (i.e. like ordinary worldly people, he will be the plaything of the ordinary course of Nature)\" (III, 3). Therefore it is taught that the yogi should always be intent on the awareness of Suddha Vidya. In Malini-vijaya, it has been said, \"Therefore, one who desires to realize the higher Self should not be attached to objects of pleasure.\" In Spandakarika also, it has been said \"Hence one who is always intent on having a clear vision of the spanda principle realizes very soon his real nature even in the waking state.\" (I, 21) CONCLUSION OF THE SECOND SECTION TEXT"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"11.10.     125     TRANSLATION Thus the second section beginning with the sutra: Cittam mantrah, and showing that in Saktopaya, the main emphasis is on the intensive awareness of the transforming power of mantra and mudra, gives a clear conception of saktopaya, accord-ing to the agama scriptures in the following verse of Malini-vijaya. \"That communion (with Siva) which is obtained only by mental reflection on the reality which is beyond the process of enuncia-tion is designated in this tradition as Sakta.\" (II, 22).

These activities are carried on respectively by buddhi, ahamkara and manas. It is these that constitute citta It is this citta which is the individual atma or anu. It is called atma, because the word atman is derived from the root at which means to move constantly'. Atati iti atmd - that which moves on constantly is atma. Owing to primal ignorance of its real nature which is pure foundational consciousness, it moves on to various forms of existence by clinging to sattva, rajas and tamas.1 That is why it is known as atma or anu.2 Really speaking, there is no wandering of atma which is purely consciousness. Therefore in the first Sutra of the first section, viz., 'Caitanyam Atma' i.e. atma is consciousness', atma has been, at first, so defined with the intention of expounding its inherent, essential nature. Now, however, the definition is being given mainly from the standpoint of its appearance in limitation. This definition is suitable to its condition of limita-tion (anava dasa). Therefore, there is no inconsistency between the previous and the later definition. NOTES 1. Sattva: is prakasa, visibility or manifestation. This is predominantly the attribute of buddhi; rajas is cancalya - un-steadiness. This is predominantly the attribute of manas; tamas is avarana covering, concealing. This is the attribute of ahamkara inasmuch as it conceals the nature of the real Self. Therefore the statement that atma dings to sattva, rajas and tamas signifies the fact that it uses buddhi, manas and ahamkara for its expression in the lower planes. 2. Anu: minute, atomic, a mere point, The universal cons-ciousness limits itself to a Point. Hence the individual self is known as anu.

The citta becomes conditioned by its desire for the pleasure of the objects of sense. The constituent of buddhi is primarily sattva. that of manas is rajas and that of aharhkara is tamas. It is this citta which is anu. This citta or anu is called atma in this context. Using buddhi, manas and aharhkara it moves about (atati) from one form of existence to another. Citta is anu or atrna i.e. the individual self in this context. Therefore, anavopaya is concerned with buddhi, manas and ahamkara. Bhaskara gives a different interpretation of this Sutra. According to him, citta and manas are synonymous, when manas is extroverted, then mentation is called samkalpa; when manas is introverted and it reflects on the Self, its reflection is known as mantra. When manas is turned inward, it can grasp the real nature of Self. This interpretation does not seem to be borne out by the wordings of the Sutra.

It has been said in Tantrasadbhava. \"Confined to sattva, rajas, and tamas and knowing only what the senses can inform, the embodied one wanders about in exis-tence, moving from one station to another.\" The same idea has been repeated in the following verses of Spandakarika. \"Being bound up by the Puryastaka that arises from tanmatras and by the modes of mind, the I-making principle and the deter-minative faculty, the empirical self experiences as a subservient creature pleasure and pain that result from the ideas which origi-nate from the puryastaka and so he becomes subject to transmi-gratory existence because of the existence of that puryastaka.

The word pratyaya also means vikalpa - thought-construct, fancy. It is impossible to find one word in English which can do justice to such a rich connotation. EXPOSITION The second sulra says that the lower, limited knowledge of the embodied individual becomes the cause of his bondage. This lower, limited knowledge becomes the cause of the indi-vidual's bondage in many ways. Firstly, in practical life we have to do with particulars. There-fore, the empirical individual thinks that particulars are the sole truth of life. He is confined to differences and distinctions and is unable to grasp the Universal of which the particulars are only a limited expression. He misses the wood for the trees. He is unable to see 'the life that vibrates in every atom, the light that shines in every creature, the love that embraces all in oneness.' He is 'cabined, caged and confined' within his parti-cular self and its needs and desires. Because he is unable to flow with the current of life, he remains bound, chained to transient pleasures."},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"111.2.    131    Secondly, all the ideas of the individual are derived from sensori-motor perceptions, their images, and thought-constructs, imagination, and fancies of the mind and Sabda-rasi - the stock of words that he has gathered by experience and study. He becomes a play-thing of the Matrka-cakra. He is unable to believe that there can be any supersensuous reality. So he builds a prison for himself in which he takes the utmost delight to live. Thirdly he considers his mind-body complex, his psycho-physical organism to be his Self. He does not care to know that these are only instruments for the life of the Atma - his real Self on the material plane. So he indulges in gross physical pleasures. The desire for them becomes so strong that he becomes their victim. He does not enjoy them; they enjoy him. As Bhagavadgita puts it; \"Pleasures born of contact are only sources of pain. O son of Kunti, they have a beginning and an end (i.e. they are transient). The wise man does not indulge in them.\" He does not realize that the residual traces (vasanis) of all his strong desires and cravings are deposited in his puryastaka, his subtle body and by the law of forces of desire they drag him down again in the next life to a body in which those desires and cravings can be satisfied. As Ksemaraja puts it in his commentary on the 1st verse of the 3rd Nisyanda in Spandakarika: \"The various desires of such a person are awakened by the force of his subtle body, and he wanders from life to life by acquiring suitable bodies in which these desires can be suitably satisfied.\" So the lower, limited knowledge of the individuals becomes a source of bondage in many ways."},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"132    Siva Sutram INTRODUCTION TO THE 3rd SUTRA TEXT TRANSLATION A doubt may arise regarding jnana.

As both jnana (knowledge) and Atrna are light and there is no difference between them, it is the knower himself that is revealed in knowledge.\" In view of this statement of Vijnanabhairava, even limited knowledge is light itself, then how can limited knowledge be said to be the cause of bondage. This is true if through God's grace one could really realize its significance, but if through God's maya sakti there is no realization like this, then: SUTRA - 3 Kaladlnam tattvanam aviveko maya. of kala etc; of constitutive principles; non-discrimination The non-discrimination of the tattvas like kala etc. is maya.

In other words, Maya is only an extension of the primal ignorance of Reality. The same thing has been said in Tantrasadbhava: -\"The consciousness of the empirical individual is reduced to limited efficacy by kala (limited doership), the objects of sense are exhibited to him in attractive light by vidya (limited knowledge), he is emotionally affected by raga (desire for parti-cular things); he is endowed with organs of sense-perception and organs of action.

The third sutra elaborates the idea contained in the second. Limited knowledge is due to Maya. The word Maya is used in three senses in this system - Maya sakti, Maya tattva and Maya granthi. Maya sakti is an aspect of Siva's Svatantrya (absolute freedom); it is His power of manifestation in different ways. Maya tattva is the constitutive principle which gives rise to limited objective experience. It is the material cause of Prakrti and insentiency. Maya-granthi is the knot of insentiency and sentiency into oneness brought about by Maya. Due to this, the constitutive elements of the psycho-physical organism are taken to be the Self; the kala, vidya, raga etc. the kancukas of Maya, the puryas-taka (the subtle body), and the physical body which are prthak -separate from the Self are considered to be aprthak i.e. identical with the Self. It is in the sense of Maya-granthi that the word Maya has been used in this Sutra. The knowledge (jnana) brought about by Maya granthi is the cause of bondage and mayagranthi means taking kala etc. which are not-self as Self.

As has been said in Vijnanabhairava: \"One should contemplate successively by means of Bhuvana adhva etc. from gross to subtle and subtle to para or causal till at last the mind is completely dissolved.\"3 (Verse 56)"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"136  Siva  Sutram  Also: '\"One should think of one's body being burnt by kalagni4 arising from the toe of the right foot. At last there is the realiza-tion of light which is santa, i.e. in which there is not the slightest trace of difference.5 (Verse 52) In this way, there is the description of dissolution in all the agamas. Therefore: \"The full samdvesa which occurs by means of uccara6 karana1 dhyana8 varna9, and sthana-kalpana10 is known as anava samavesa\". (Malini-Vijaya II, 21). Thus dhyana (meditation) etc. has been described in Malini-vijaya as anava upaya. This upaya being gross has not been adopted in Spanda-sastra because it deals mainly with Saktopaya. Whatever of Saklopaya has been used here as a concluding means has been supported by me by quoting parallel ideas from Spanda-sastra and shall be supported further also. NOTES 1. Samana: When the unmana sakti of Siva displays herself in the form of the universe from sunya upto the earth as thought, she is known as Samana. 2. Bhavana: directing one's thought in a particular way, imagining oneself to be in a particular mode 3. Dissolution of the mind is known as layibhavana - the technique of dissolution which is a kind of Sakta technique. 4. Kalagni Rudra is the deity full of tejas i.e. burning light. In the human body, his place is supposed to be the toe of the right foot. One has to meditate that Kalagni is arising from that place and burning the entire body. 5. This is daha-bhdvand which is again a kind of Sakta technique. 6. Uccara: holding the mind at rest on prana. 7. Karana: This is a technical practice of this yoga. The word Karana does not mean sense in this context. It has been used in an abstract sense. Krtih iti karanam-bhavarthe. Karanam here means doing, operation. It has been used here in the sense of 'Yogic or mystic operation or practice.' In anavopaya, this"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"111.4.     137     practice is used in a technical sense. It is the body which is made the object of the meditative practice. The aspirant ima-gines the body as the representative of the entire universe, then admires the glory of the divine in this universe, and finally con-siders it all as the divine Self within. The word 'body' in this context has to be taken in the sense of the physical gross body, the subtle and also the causal body. Mudra which means cer-tain postures of the body indicative of certain inward states is also used in karana-yoga. 8. Dhyana - meditation, what has to be meditated on is the foundational divine light of consciousness inherent in all the tattvas or constitutive principles. This dhyana is the same as defined by Patanjali, viz. pratyaikatanata dhydnam i.e. the continuous uninterrupted flow of the mental mode. 9. Varna - The word varna literally means letter or sound of a letter. Here it is the unification or assimilation of all the sounds which is known as nada. In the subtle prana inside the body, there is always an unstruck vibration (anahata nada) which is the seed of creativity and dissolution (Srsti-samhara bija). Concentration on the nada is another variety of anava yoga. This kind of yoga is also known as nadanusandhana in other systems of yoga. Abhinavagupta says: \"There is one varna in the form of nada which pervades all the varnas. It never ceases i.e. is eternal and is called anahata i.e. unstruck, natural, uncaused. The aim in varna prakalpana is to concentrate finally on this inner nada. 10. Sthana-Kalpana. The word sthana means station, i.e. place of concentration in this context, The stations of concen-tration are mainly three, viz; (1) the body (2) the prana-vayu (the breath) and (3) anything external i.e. outside the body. 1. The following are the stations or the places in the body on which concentration is to be made. (1) Trikona or mula-dhara (ii) navel (iii) the heart (iv) throat (v) the central place between the two eye-brows. This is what is called dharana in a limited sense in Patanjali's yoga."},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"138  Siva  Sutram  Desabandhas-cittasya dharana - fixing of the mind on a parti-cular spot is dharana. 2. Pranavayu - sthana-kalpana. This refers to concentration on prana i.e. on the expiration and inspiration of breath from the centre of the body up to a distance of twelve fingrs in the external space. The mind has to be concentrated on the starting point of the breath from the centre and the ending point at a distance of twelve fingers from the centre which is known as (the end of dvadasanta the distance of twelve fingers). The external distance is known as bahya dvadasanta, and the internal (the starting point) is known as antar dvadasanta.

As has been said in Svacchanda."},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"140    Siva Sutram \"One should breathe in through the left (nose) and breathe out through the right.3 This brings about cleansing of the nadis (channels) and of the middle nadi which is the path to liberation. By breathing out, by breathing in, and by restraining or stopping the breath, there are said to be three types of pranayama.4 They are all common and external. There are also three types of internal pranayama. By the internal one has to perform the recaka, by the internal one has to perform the puraka and by the internal one has to perform tremorless kumbhaka. Thus the three internal pranayamas should be performed.\" (VII, Verse 294-296) The conquest of the elements like earth, etc. means control over them by means of dharana5 As has been said in the same book: \"Concentration on air at the place of the toe of the left foot, on fire in the middle of the navel, on earth in the throat, on water in the uvula, on akasa (ether) on the top of the head brings about all supernormal powers\" (VII 299-300) Bhuta-kaivalya means pratyahara or the withdrawal of the mind from the elements.6 As has been said in the same book: \"The transition of prana from the heart to the navel, and checking it there, the withdrawal of the mind from sense-objects and its transition to the navel (by the device of pratyahara) this is the fourth pranayama'' known as the calm or tranquil one\" (suprasanta)\" (VII, 297) The meaning of the verse is that there should be transition of prana from the heart to the navel, and withdrawal of the mind from objects and its transition also to the navel. Bhutaprthakatva means detachment of the mind from the elements and thus its assuming the nature of pure and free Self. As has been said there itself (i.e. Svacchanda Tantra itself) \"O goddess having pierced through all the knots, such as the heart, the throat etc. right up to unmana by the aforesaid means, and abandoning them altogether, one can attain to the state of the highest freedom of spirit, i.e. Bhairava aspect\" (VII, 327) Bhuta-sandhana-bhuta-prhaktva-visva-samghattah which has been mentioned before (in I, 20) happens effortlessly as it has been included in sambhavopaya. This coming under anavopaya has to be acquired with effort. This is the difference."},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"111.5     141     1. Nadi-samhara or dissolution of the prana and apana into susumna is brought about by Pranayama. 2. Udana-fire - Uddna is also a kind of prana. It is called fire figuratively, because prana and apana are dissolved in it. 3. Usually apasavya means right and savya means left, but when apasavya is used as an indeclinable i.e. as apasavyam or apasavyena, it means 'to or on the left', and so also savyam or savyena means 'to or on the right'. This is how Ksemardja interprets it in his commentary on Svacchanda Tantra. This interpretation is confirm-ed by Svami Laksamana Joo also 4. Pranayama means breath control. Puraka means inhaling the breath, recaka means exhaling it, and kwnbhaka means retaining it. 5. The word dharana has been used here in the same sense in which it is used in Patanjali's yoga, viz., Desabandhascittasya dharana i.e. fixing of the mind on a particular spot is known as dharana. Bhuta-jaya or control over the elements is brought about by dharana. 6. Bhuta-kaivalya is brought about by pratyahara which means both withdrawal of the mind from its object and with-drawal of the senses from their objects. 7. This is how Ksemaraja has interpreted the verse \"By the internal means 'through the middle nadi' i.e. susumna, the recana (exhalation) has to be done up to dvadasanta (a dis-tance of 12 fingers) and the inhalation has to be done towards the heart i.e. the centre of the body. Niskampa means effortless or calm, free from agitation.\" This is a pratyahara pranayama. This is called the fourth pranayama in relation to the earlier one which has three aspects, viz., puraka, recaka, and kumbhaka. 8. Unmana When the supreme Siva who is of the nature of changeless light moves forth by His Will, such Sakti, inseparable from Him, is called Unmana, Literally the word means above the mind."},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"142    Siva Sutram It is a supramental power. How the various granthis have to be crossed through has been described under Pranavadhikdra in Svacchanda Tantra. Svacchanda Tantra saya that after unmana sakti has been acquired, one develops the power of entering another body. (VII, 329) EXPOSITION Pranayama, Dharana, Pratyahara and Samadhi come, accord-ing to this system, under anavopaya. This sutra says how by using these techniques of anavopaya certain, supernormal powers (siddhis) are obtained. By pranayama, there can be dissolution of prana and apana in Susumna. By dharana, the yogi can acquire control over the elements; by pratyahara, he can withdraw his mind from the elements. Cases have been known of yogis undergoing opera-tion of certain parts of the body without chloroform. They withdraw their consciousness from the particular part and hence do not feel any pain. By perfection in Samadhi, the yogi can detach himself completely from his body and enter another body if he so desires. INTRODUCTION TO THE 6th SUTRA TEXT TRANSLATION Thus the various supernormal powers accrue to the yogi by means of purification of the body, purification of the elements, pranayama, pratyahara, dharana, dhyana and samadhi. All such powers are due to a veil drawn by ignorance, and not to the highest knowledge of reality. Therefoe, the next sutra says:"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"111.6.    143    SUTRA - 6 Mohavaranat siddhih due to a veil of ignorance; supernormal power. \"Supernormal power is due to a veil drawn by ignornce.\" COMMENTARY TEXT"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"144    Siva Sutram TRANSLATION That which deludes is moha; in other words it is Maya. There occurs supernormal power in the form of control and enjoyment of the various things brought about by dharana, etc - in succession which have been mentioned above owing to the veil drawn by maya.1 This power does not denote the manifestation of the highest reality. As has been said in Laksmi-Kaularnava: \"The Lord, the divine who is self-existent, and without the residual effect of any previous life, being deluded (by His own Maya sakti) does not perceive Siva who is beyond all thought-constructs, who is the highest abode (of all), who is without beginning and without end and who is obvious to all beings (as their innermost Self) What follows applies to the person whose delusion has melted away: \"One should resort to the middle prana (udana in susumna) in between the passages of prana and apana, and resorting to jnanasakti,2 and having established himself there (i.e. in jnana-sakti), he should take his asana (seat) there. Inasmuch as the highest pulsation (of consciousness) is obtain-ed beyond the subtle pranayama after abandoning the gross pranayama (consisting of puraka, recaka, kumbhaka), and also the subtle one that is carried on inside the susumna, therefore this is the pranayama prescribed as the best from which there is no fall of the aspirant any more.3 Leaving aside even subtle supernormal sound etc which are modes of sensation caused by the gunas of Prakrti and are ex-perienced by the mind, one should enter the highest state with full I-consciousness (without any thought-construct). This is said to be (real) pratyahara.4 This cuts away the noose of transmigratory existence. The highest Reality is all-pervasive and cannot be meditated on5 in any objective form. Transcending the attributes of the mind, one should meditate on the universal consciousness as the Light experienced within oneself as the pramata or knower. This is what the wise know as meditation. When the Highest Self is always held in consciousness by the aspirant, that is denned as the dharana which sets at naught the fetter of transmigratory existence."},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"111.6.     145     In this world, whether in oneself or in other creatures, if one maintains the idea of sameness i.e. if one experiences in every-thing the same secondless Siva as I, that is known as Samadhi.''6 (VIII, 11-18) Therefore as defined by Mrtyujit (Netratantra), there can be samavesa in the highest Reality, also by Dharana, etc., in a higher sense, not merely the attian-ment of limited supernormal powers. NOTES 1. The word 'Maya' has been used here in the sense of illusory or deceptive power. 2. The prana in the middle path (susumna) is udana. Udana-sakti, developed at its highest turns into jnana-sakti, or error-less prajna or knowledge. Ksemaraja in his commentary on this verse says. i.e. when prana and apana are submerged in the middle channel i.e. susumna, then udana begins to function within it. With the submergence of the function of prana and the emergence of cit, the function of jnanasakti emerges which is the manifestation of higher consciousness, the yogi should then resort to this jnana-sakti. Therefore, the word jnana-sakti has been used here. 3. 'There is no fall' means that he no more loses the sense of being the Cit-pramdtd i.e. the central consciousness being the subject in him. 4. Pratyahara is prati+ahara. Prati means pratipa i.e. in a reverse direction, ahara = taking away. So pratyahara is taking away the senses or the mind in a reverse (inverted) direction. In the present context, it is taking the individual mind in a reverse direction. Ksemaraja rightly says in his commentary i.e. Pratyahara is turning back the individual mind to the universal consciousness from which it has wandered away. 5. Unmeditable or nirdhyeyam (not an object of meditation) has been used for the highest Reality, because what any one meditates on is an object, but the highest Reality can never be reduced to the position of an object. It is the eternal subject, and it is present in every body as the metaphysical subject apart"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"146    Siva Sutram from the psychological subject. Therefore, the next line adds i.e. what one should meditate on can be experienced within oneself (as the ever-present Subject). 6. The verse says that real is i.e. the idea of sameness in all, the idea that everything is Siva or I. It is impossible to bring out this significant play on the word in the translation. EXPOSITION The fifth sutra says that pranayama, dharana, pratyahara and samadhi are all anavopaya, all kriya-yoga, disciplinary practices which the anu or the individual can adopt and by means of these disciplinary practices certain supernormal powers are obtained. The sixth sutra warns that the individual should not aim at the attainment of such limited, inferior powers. His aim should be genuine Self-realization which is ,Siva-realization It then points out that asana, pranayama, dharana, dhyana and samadhi which are the usual techniques of yoga can all be taken in a higher mystic sense and not simply in the usual sense of mechanical, disciplinary practices which they are at the level of anavopaya. The higher senses of these practices pertain to Saktopaya and the sutra hints that anavopaya should lead to Saktopaya. Bhaskara in his Varttika interprets this sutra differently. He says that moha etc. only veil the essential nature of Self, it is only by concentrating on the Highest that one acquires Supernormal powers like omniscience and omnipotence. In this interpreta-tion, there does not seem to be any connexion between moha-varanat and siddhih. Ksemaraja's interpretation appears to be better. INTRODUCTION TO THE 7th SUTRA TEXT TRANSLATION The sutrakara says this (i.e. what happens by conquering moha):"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"111.7.     147     SUTRA - 7 Mohajayad anantabhogat sahajavidyajayah. delusive Maya; conquest of delusive Maya; boundless, infinite; - expansion, extension whose extension is boundless i.e. which pervades to an unlimited extent; natural inherent knowledge; -=mastery of natural, inherent knowledge. By an all pervasive conquest of delusive Maya is there mastery of the natural, inherent knowledge of Reality.\" COMMENTARY TEXT"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"148  Siva  Sutram  TRANSLATION By conquest means by subjugation of moha (delusion) i.e. of Maya which is a bond extending up to samana, a bond of the nature of primal ignorance. By what kind of conquest? Of that kind of conquest which is boundless i.e. which extends up to the annulment of even the residual traces of ignorance. By such conquest is there mastery i.e. acquisition of inherent knowledge defined in the verse \"Because she brings about the investigation of the beginningless characteristic of Siva etc.\" The mastery of sahaja Vidya or inherent knowledge has been spoken of in the context of anavopaya because even anavopaya must terminate in Saktopaya. So in Svacchanda Tantra, beginning with 'O fair one, there is an endless network of bonds stretching up to samana' and ending with the following verses, the acquisition of sahaja vidya has been spoken of - sahajavidya which is of the nature of unmana inhering in Siva and which comes about by the conquest of delusion that extends up to the final inherence in Self. \"Abandoning identification of Self with bonds existing up to samana one views the essential nature of oneself as pure con-sciousness. This, however, only amounts to inherence in Self (atmavyapti).1 Inherence in Siva2 (Siva-vyapti) is different from this. When desired objects like omniscience etc. are contemplated upon within oneself as pervading everything, there is inherence in Siva. This becomes an effective means for the deve-lopment of caitanya or consciousness as Svatantrya (absolute freedom)\" (IV, 434-435). As has been said in Svacchanda itself, \"Therefore abandoning merely pure consciousness or merely inherence in Self (atma-vyapti) (as the aim), one should attach oneself to vidya tattva. This vidya tattva should be known as unmana. Manas is only a notion in the heart. Such"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"111.7.     149     a kind of knowledge is only gradual, proceeding step by step, by degrees while unmana is knowledge in one sweep and perennial. Because there is no other vidya (knowledge) like this, therefore is it the highest vidya3. By this knowledge one attains the highest qualities like omniscience, etc. simultaneously. It is called Vidya, because it brings about the investigation of the beginning-less characteristic of Siva, viz., Svatantrya-Sakti, because it brings about the knowledge of the Highest Self and because it dispels all that is not the Highest Self. Established in that (unmana), one can manifest the highest light (light of conscious-ness-cit-jyoti) the highestcause (i.e. Highest Siva the source of all manifestation) (IV, 393-397). NOTES 1. Pervasion of inherence in Self or atma-vyapti (also called atma-tattva in this context) is a technical term. When atma (Self) is established in itself as pure consciousness, this state of being confined only to its being pure consciousness is termed atma-vyapti. This is considered to be an inferior state of realization in this system, because in this realization the Self is isolated from everything else and because the Self is considered to be only consciousness without Kriya-sakti (the power of acti-vity). When atma enters the state of Siva, then only is it considered to be the highest realization, because there is no sense of bheda or difference now inasmuch as those things from which the Self was isolated are also now known as Siva and because there is svatantrya sakti in Siva. 2. Pervasion or inherence in Siva or Siva-vyapti is another technical term. As Ksemaraja puts it (Svacchanda Tantra IV, p. 246) When atma by rising to unmana enters the state of the highest consciousness-bliss of Siva, that state is known as Siva-Vyapti . 3. Ksemaraja in his commentary on this vidya in Svacchanda Tantra warns that this vidya tattva should not be confused with the vidya tattva which includes the experients from Vijnanakala, upto Mantramahesvara. This vidya tattva is different. It is unmana identified with Siva-consciousness."},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"150    Siva Sutram EXPOSITION The seventh sutra says that moha has to be conquered to such an extent that even its residual traces (samskara) are completely annulled. It is only then that one acquires Sahaja vidya -knowledge inherent in Reality. Sahaja vidya is only another name of unmana. There are many stages between anu (the limited empirical individual) and Siva. Upto Samana, there is the reign of manas or mind. By conquering moha upto samana, one may be able to acquire atma-vyapti, the stage of pure consciousness. But this is the aim of Sdmkhya and Veddnta. According to Saiva philosophy, one should not rest content with atma-vyapti. The aim of this system is not only atma-vyapti, but Siva-vyapti or Sivatva-yojand. This is possible only when the aspirant crosses the boundary of Samana. Samana is the highest expres-sion of mind, but upto samana, there is still the reign of mind, of samkalpa-vikalpa, of thought-construct and desire. The as-pirant has to mount to the stage of Sahaja vidya or unmana where mental consciousness ceases and pure divine consciousness begins. It is only at this stage that one can experience cidananda ghana massive consciousness bliss, and svatantrya sakti and thus Sivavyapti or Siva's inherent state of being. Such a high state of realization is not possible by anavopaya. It is possible only by Saktopaya. But anavopaya is only a stepp-ing stone to Saktopaya. It is not an end in itself. It has to end in Saktopaya. INTRODUCTION TO THE 8th SUTRA TEXT TRANSLATION Thus this one who has attained to Sahaja vidya.

Realizing this, one is dissolved in cit or consciousness (which is the substratum of the universe) and thus, experiences the entire fulness of being i.e. there is full aspect of bhairava in him\".

It is not only the I-consciousness which is divine. The world in his case is not a mere this - something separate from him, but a ray of his inward light. Dualism in his case has disappeared.-Bhaskara interprets this sutra differently. According to him, jagrat here means jnana-sakti - the power of knowledge.

In Isvara-pratyabhijna also which contains the secret of all agamas, it has been said, \"When the whole world is asleep only the highest Lord, the producer of the world-drama is awake.\" NOTES 1.

Bija in the case of a drama is the source of the plot; bija in the case of the world-drama is Maya. In the drama, the source of the plot is the seed out of which all the events in the drama grow. In the world-drama, it is Maya that is the origin of all the events of the world. A drama has its prologue or introductory portion known as Prastava and its concluding portion known as samhara. The poec says \"You have presented the prastava or prologue of the drama, who else excepting yourself can bring about its samhara i.e. who else can bring about the liberation of the characters that are involved in it. Again there is a play on the word kah which means both 'who' and 'prajapati', the creator of beings. The poet says \"Where is the Prajapati other than yourself who can bring about the conclusion i.e. the dissolution of the plot of the drama?\" EXPOSITION One who has attained to sahaja vidya and has risen to the iinmana level does not retire to a forest or a cave, but accepts his role in the cosmic drama and carries on the duties of life. Just as an actor in a drama plays the part of a certain character but is neither affected nor deluded by the assumption of a par-ticular role, so the Self on the world-stage is not affected by the events in which he participates in life. Inwardly, he is always detached.

The word inner i.e. jiva is used relatively to the external body. Having planted his feet on that stage of the inner soul, this actor (Self) displays the world drama by means of the active movements of his inner sense1\" (Karana). It has been said in Svacchanda Tantra also \"Entering into the puryastaka and moving about in all forms of existence2, he (the self) is to be known as antaratma (the inner soul), bound by the residual traces of good and evil deeds\" (XI, 85)"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"156  Siva  Sutram  NOTES 1.

As the Upanisad says: \"Some wise man, wishing to taste immortality with reverted eyes (i.e. introspectively) beholds the immanent Self\" (Katha II, 4, 1). EXPOSITION The senses of the ordinary person are extroverted and drag down the person towards the pleasures of worldly objects. The senses of the accomplished yogi who has attained unmana do not lead him to worldly pleasures; they become introverted, and present to the yogi only the glory, the beauty and the delight of the cosmic actor.

NOTES 1. Para is derived from the root of the 9th conjugation which means 'to nourish' and 'to fill'. Because Kali nourishes and fills the universe both internally a-nd externally, therefore, she is called para. She is called Kala because she projects the universe (the root 'kala' means 'to project' - kala ksepe), because she knows the universe in its different aspects, ('Kala' also means 'to know', kala Samkhyane), because she makes a reckoning of the world ('kala', means also 'to count, kala, ganane) because, she knows the universe as herself (paramrsati, kala sabde)."},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"160    Siva Sutram 2.

'He sits there' means 'leaving all kinds of higher and lower practices involving effort like meditation, concentration etc., he is always mindful of that Power in an introverted way'. Such a one is with ease (sukham) steeped (nimajjati) (i.e. is identified with the ocean of immortality) by drowning all im-pressions of the limitation of the body etc. in the most exquisite limpid ocean of immortality (hrade) which has the characteristic of springing up (ucchalatta yogini) and is the source of the expansion of the world-process. As has been said in Mrtyujit (Netra Tantra). \"Neither meditate on something above2, nor on the middle., nor on something down below, neither in front, nor at the back, nor at both the sides, neither on something within the body, nor should one meditate on something outside. Neither one should fix one's gaze on the sky, nor on something down below. Neither one should close one's eyes nor should one keep the eyes open without blinking. Neither one should meditate on something as a support (avalambam) (like image, picture etc.) nor on a negation of support [niralambam) nor on a support over and over again (salambam)3 nor on the senses, nor beings, nor on sense-perceptions like sound, touch, taste etc. Thus leaving aside every support, established in samadhi,4one should only abide identified with the Highest. That has been said to be the highest state of Siva, that verily is the seat of the Highest Atrna which is without any external appearance. If one attains this state, he does not return any more (i.e. he is freed of transmi-gratory existence).\" (VIII, 41-45). NOTES 1. Asana here is not physical seat, but mental. So asana-sthah means 'one who is mentally established in parasakti, one who is always mindful of her'. 2. High and lower (parapara dhyana) refers to Sakta and anava practices. 3. Avalambam is a support like an image, an idol, a portrait etc. Niralambam - negation of support. When the mind thinks of negation of support, the idea of support crops up within it. The difference between avalamba and salamba is that in avalamba,"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"111.17.     165     the mind lays hold of a support to start with and it continues, in salamba, the support slips and the mind has to seize it over and over again. 4. Samadhi in this context has been thus interpreted by Ksemaraja in his commentary - Udyota: i.e. not thinking of any thing, only being mindful of one's essen-tial nature and thus being identified with it. EXPOSITION The 15th Sutra says that the Yogi should constantly maintain awareness of Para Sakti, the primal cause and source of the world process. The 16th Sutra says that if he is fully established in the awareness of para Sakti, then he need not go through any formal process of concentration or meditation anymore. By completely setting aside all notion of the body etc. being identified with the Self, he will be steeped in the bliss of immor-tality. INTRODUCTION TO THE 17th SUTRA TEXT TRANSLATION There comes about the conquest of delusion by means of anava technique such as dissolution of the flow of prana (in the susunma) etc. Through that emerges the power of Sakti in the form of Suddha Vidya.

The object has no separate existence of its own. If He were to depend upon an object2 (something outside Himself) for creation, His absolute freedom would be violated.\" (I, 5, 15). In the agama also, the following has been said with the same purport in view: \"O dear one, one who knows from the mouth of his spiritual director that water and ice are (essentially) the same (is liberated). He has no further obligation to discharge. He will have no further birth.\" The same point of view has been expounded in the following verse of Spandakarika -\"He who knows thus (viz., that there is nothing which is not Siva), regarding the whole world as the play (of the Divine), is ever united (with the universal consciousness), and is, without doubt, liberated even while alive.\" (II, 5). NOTES 1. 'That' refers to prakasa or Caitanya - the Light of Cons-ciousness having absolute freedom. 2. Objects are determined by Consciousness, not vice versa. If consciousness were to be determined by the objects, the absolute freedom of the Lord cannot be maintained. There would be a break in His absoluteness of freedom so far as objects are concerned. EXPOSITION When the Yogi acquires the power of Suddha Vidya, he is established in Creative Consciousness, and in accordance with the measure of that Consciousness, he can create creatures and objects (vedaka and vedya).

It posits abheda or identity in difference. It is cognitive. Siva tattva is abheda-pradhana, predominantly concerned with non-difference. These tattvas are only aspects of temporal manifestation; they do not belong to eternity. 3. The divine Yoga is avikalpa vimarsa i.e. awareness without thought-construct.

When Iccha Sakti appears in the form 'well, let this thing now become' and then making that thing like that (i.e. according to the deci-sion), she is said to be kriya-Sakti (the Power of execution). Thus being of two kinds, she undergoes innumerable changes according to the desired objects. This goddess becomes like Cintamani1 (a thought-gem). Then when she assumes the aspect of mother2, she is divided in two ways, nine ways, and becomes a wearer of a garland of fifty letters. With the division of bija and yoni, she is of two kinds. The vowels are considered to be the bija (seed). With ka and other letters she is said to be yoni (consonants). According to the divi-sion of the groups of the consonants, she is of nine kinds. In this context bija (the vowel) is called Siva and yoni (the consonant) is called Sakti. According to the division of eight groups of letters, there is a group of eight deities3, such as Mahesvari and others. According to letter by letter division, she shines with the rays of fifty (letters), Being the indicator of Rudras, she is established in the same number as Rudras (i.e. fifty) (Malini-Vijaya III, 5-13).

In the seventh Sutra under the first Section, only the existence of the fourth state was stated whose elixir spreads in the waking condition etc. in the case of those in whom it occurs either as spontaneous emergence or by a firm grip of the awareness of the collective whole of Saktis. In sutra 11 under the 1st section, the dissolution of the waking and other states was shown by the device of hathapaka1 in accordance with Sambhava technique. By means of the present sutra, it has been stated that by the technique of firm hold appropriate to anava yoga, the three states of waking etc. should become like the sheath of a sword which may be saturated with the elixir of turya.9 This is the difference between these sutras.

What usually happens in the case of the acquisition of the fourth state by anava means is that the awareness of the fourth state occurs only at the initial and final stages of waking, dreaming and deep sleep, but is missed in the intervening condition. The present satra exhorts the Yogi to be on the alert and not lose his hold on the 4th state so that it may permeate the three states in all the stages - initial, intervening and final.

The same idea has been emphasized in the following laudatory verse Cf Jnanagarbha: \"When, O Mother, men renounce all mental activities and are poised in a pure state, being free from the bondage of the pursuit of sense activities,6 then by thy grace is that supreme state realized at once which rains down the nectar of unlimited and unparalleled happiness.

Sama in samacara means Samyak i.e. by the force of a firm hold on the inner nature whose all the complexes have become evolved i.e. have been brought fully under control.

This is what he experiences in all conditions2. It has been said in Anandabhairava: \"Giving up customary practices, one should resort to non-dualism which brings about liberation. Then his attitude towards all the gods becomes the same, and also towards all the castes and asramas. He looks upon all things as the same. He is free from all bonds.\" Therefore, it has been said in the commentary on Isvara-pratyabhijna: \"In the case of those who are free from the limitations caused by the assumption of external space, time and form; even when buddhi and prana are active (i.e. in the normal course of life), they have the experience of the entire universe as the Self.\"3 NOTES 1. When the Yogi is fully plunged in the fourth state, his vital breaths - prana and apana i.e. exhaling and inhaling breaths are dissolved in the middle nadi i.e. the susumna. When he wakes up to the usual, normal consciousness, his prana and apana breaths resume their usual course of breathing out and breathing in. This is what is meant by pranasamacara. 2. The experience of the delight and unity consciousness of the 4th State does not vanish when the Yogi wakes up to normal consciousness. It persists even in the normal consciousness and the Yogi feels that he and everything else in the universe are the expression of the same universal consciousness. 3. They experience jagadananda - the bliss of the Divine made visible in the form of the world. EXPOSITION The 21st Sutra suggests that when an aspirant has advanced far enough in Yoga by anavopaya, he is led into saktopaya and enters the transcendental consciousness.

INTRODUCTION TO THE 23rd SUTRA TEXT TRANSLATION When, however, he (the Yogi) does not enter the turyatita state which is attainable by the intensity of the awareness of the inner turya, but is rather content only with the delight of the fourth state experienced at the initial and final point of the waking, dreaming state etc. then his (i.e. in his case) SUTRA - 23 Madhye'vara-prasavah in the intervening stage, inferior; generation or arising (of states). 'In the intervening stage, there arise inferior states of mind.' COMMENTARY TEXT"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"111.23.     183     TRANSLATION In the case of the Yogi who has enjoyed the delight of the transcendental consciousness at the initial and final stages of waking, dream etc., inferior stages of mind characteristic of the normal course of life arise in the intervening stage. As is the case of the Yogi described in Sutra ten of the 2nd section, he is not permanently deluded: It has been said in Malinivijaya: \"Even when one has obtained some impression of the trans-cendental state, if one is not on the alert, then the vinayakas induce him to transient pleasures. Therefore one who desires to obtain the highest state should not have any attachment for these (transient pleasures).\" This I have quoted as an authority previously also. INTRODUCTION TO THE 24th SUTRA TEXT TRANSLATION Even when inferior states arise, if the Yogi sprinkles the inter-vening stage with the elixir of the tightly-gripped fourth state, then: SUTRA - 24 Matra-svapratyaya-sandhane nastasya punarutthanam. objects; on the union of the real I-cons-of the lost; rising again. \"When the real I-consciousness is joined to the objects, the transcendental state of consciousness which had disappeared appears again\"."},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"184    SivaSutram    COMMENTARY TEXT TRANSLATION Matrasu means 'in objects'; joining of the real I-consciousness. \"Whatever is perceived through the eye, whatever becomes an object of consciousness through word, whatever the mind thinks of (viz., pleaure, gain etc.), whatever the intellect ascer-tains, whatever is appropriated to the empirical 1-consciousness, whatever exists as an object of consciousness, even what does not exist (and is only a matter of imagination or fancy), the Light of Consciousness or Siva should be assiduously investigated in all these.\" (XII, 163-164). Thus in accordance with what has been pointed out in Svacchanda-tantra, in the case of the Yogi who over and over"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"111.25     185     again thinks of his compact consciousness in every case in the form \"I am this universe\", there is again reappearance or emer-gence of the delight of the fourth state of consciousness which had disappeared on account of the appearance of inferior states of mind mentioned before. In other words the Yogi experiences complete fulfilment in his identification with that fourth state of consciousness. It has been said in Svacchanda-tantra, beginn-ing with, \"As the mind even of Yogis forcibly runs (after, objects of enjoyment)\" and ending with, \"Whose mind is chock-full of the highest reality (that being the sole object of knowledge), steady, fully contented (i.e., without any desire) in all cases, his mind does not deviate (from its fixed aim), even when he passes through all sorts of circums-tances. Wherever his mind moves, he should think of Siva (the object of his knowledge) there itself. As everything is Siva, where else shall his mind go to? In the apprehension of all objects, in all sense-enjoyments -in whichever condition the Yogi may happen to be placed, wher-ever he may investigate, there is no place where Siva does not exist.\" (IV, 311-314).

So long as the body-aspect1 does not vanish, he is like Siva. When the body perishes, he is veritable Siva. In Kalika-krama, it has been said similarly: \"Therefore, having understood always and without doubt from the mouth of the spiritual director the means of union with Siva, one should contemplate over Him without any thought-construct, with unshakable zeal and with a sense of identification with Him till one becomes identified with Him.2 This is what Lord Bhairava has said. NOTES 1. So long as he is a jiva, so long as there is the flow of prana and apana in him. 2. The identification with Siva is, to start with, only mental. Finally, it is actual.

Therefore, its continuance should not be neglected. This is what the next sutra says. SUTRA - 26 Sariravrttir Vratam remaining in the body, retaining the body; - observance of pious act Remaining in the body is all his observance of a pious act (vratam). COMMENTARY TEXT"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"188    Siva Sutram TRANSLATION As described before 'of the Yogi who is like Siva i.e. who exists with the consciousness that I am Siva', remaining in the body is his observance of a pious act. In other words, the regular observance of a pious act in the case of this Yogi consists in his being engaged in the worship of the ever-present Supreme in the form of the awareness of one's essential nature. It has been said in Svacchanda-tantra. \"As in a well-kindled fire, the flame is seen in the sky: so like that the Self (atma) though existing in the body and prana is merged in the state of Siva.\"1 (IV, 398). In accordance with this, it has been declared that though the Yogi is still existing in the body, prana etc. his self is immersed in the state of Siva. No other observance of a pious act apart from the main-tenance of the body is appropriate for him. As has been said in Trikasara: \"The wise man is always marked with higher modes of yogic poses that arise from the body (i.e., while the body is retained). He alone is the (real) holder of yogic poses; the rest who only maintain certain gross poses of hands and the body are only holders of bones.\" In Kulapancasika also, it has been said -\"The (higher) powers2 (lit., rays of light) converse only with those who do not put on any perceptible (religious) mark. They do not come near those who put on visible marks of piety, for they are very occult beings.\" NOTES 1. In this verse, deha or body has been compared to wood, mantra has been compared to arani - a piece of wood used for kindling fire by friction; prana has been compared to fire. sikha or flame has been compared to atma (Self); ambara or sky has been compared to Siva. When prana is kindled by means of mantra used as arani, fire in the form of udana arises in susumna, and then just as flame arises out of kindled fire and gets dissolved in the sky, so also"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"111.27.    189    atma (Self) like a flame having burnt down the fuel of the body, gets absorbed in Siva. 2. When there is realization of Reality, Sakti-cakra (host of powers) according to Saivagama, appears to the Yogi. The verse says that these powers never appear to one who believes only in outward marks of piety but is spiritually bankrupt. They appear only to one who has inward realization and does not believe in a show of piety by putting on an outward mark. INTRODUCTION TO THE 27th SUTRA TEXT Translation Of this sort of Yogi. SUTRA - 27 Katha japah. conversation; muttering prayer or sacred formula. ('His) conversation constitues muttering of prayer. COMMENTARY TEXT"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"190    Siva Sutram TRANSLATION As he is always full of the Supreme I-consciousness, as indi-cated in the following verse of Svacchanda-tantra, \"I am the highest atma; I am Siva, the highest cause\", even an ordinary conversation of his amounts to the muttering of a prayer. As expounded in the following verse of Kalikakrama: \"Of that God who is greater than all the gods and who is supreme consciousness itself, the highest Sakti is I-consciousness which is omniscient, full of wisdom.\" I-consciousness is the highest Sakti of this Yogi. Whatever conversation etc. there may be of the Yogi who has attained to the natural I-conscious-ness which is of the nature of the highest mantra, all that amounts to japa (utterance of a prayer) whose essential characteristic is ceaseless repetition of the awareness of the deity which is one's own Self.1 As has been said in Vijnanabhairava: \"That contemplation which is made over and over again on the highest state (i.e. on the Supreme I-consciousness) is in this subtle teaching a japa. Such an inner automatic Sound (of I) which is of the nature of a mantra should be pondered over again and again. This is the kind of subtle japa that the yogi should perform.\" (Verse 145). Again it has been said: \"The breath is exhaled with the sound sa and inhaled again with the sound ha. Therefore, the empirical individual always repeats the mantra Hamsah.2 Throughout the day and night, he repeats this mantra 21,600 times.3 Such a. japa of the goddess (Gayatrl) has been prescribed which is quite easy for the wise, but difficult for the ignorant.\""},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"111.27    191    NOTES 1. Awareness of I which is being sounded inwardly automa-tically without anybody's utterance is the occult japa. Since the Yogi never loses his hold on this I-consciousness even while he is chatting with others, therefore even ordinary conversation is a japa on his part. The word japa is here taken as an anacrostic word - 'ja' standing for jani meaning birth, creation, and pa standing for palana meaning protection. Japa, therefore, means that which protects created beings. 2. The mantra hamsah is repeated automatically by the jiva in every round of expiration - inspiration. It is known as hamsa mantra. This is also known as ajapajapa i.e. automatic japa. The ha of this mantra represents Sakti and sah represents Siva. Am in hamsah represents the jiva. The apana or incoming breath represents Sakti and prana, the outgoing breath represents Siva. This is known as trika-mantra also as it includes in itself the three realities of Siva, Sakti and nara (jiva). The aspirant has to concentrate on am which is the junction point of ha and sah. 3. One round of inspiration-expiration takes 4 seconds. So there is automatic japa of hamsah (I am He) 15 times in a minute. In one hour, there would be (15x60) 900 repetitions of this japa. In a full day and night, there would be (900x24) 21,600 repetitions of this japa. INTRODUCTION TO THE 28th SUTRA TEXT TRANSLATION The next sutra describes the daily life and conduct of the Yogi who practices this kind of japa and vrata. SUTRA - 28 Danam atmajnanam."},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"192    Siva Sutram charity; gift; knowledge of Self. 'Knowledge of Self is the gift that he disseminates (all round)' COMMENTARY TEXT TRANSLATION As described before, atma is universal consciousness. Its jnana means its realization. Danam1 means gift derived from the root da of the 3rd conjugation, the meaning accordingly would be - the perfect essential mature is given as a gift. The word danam can also be derived from the root do of the 2nd conjugation which means 'to cut, to divide'. In this sense, danam indicates that the difference of the universe (from Siva) is cut asunder. The word danam can be derived also from the root 'dai' of the 1st conjugation; meaning 'to purify', to cleanse'. This would indicate that Maya is cleansed, purified by knowledge of the Self. The word danam may also be derived from the root 'di' of the 2nd conjugation which means 'to preserve', suggesting that the Siva-nature acquired by him is well preserved. The main meaning of the Sutra is that Self-knowledge is dis-seminated by him among his pupils. It has been rightly said: \"The great Yogis who are well-established in kulacara will enable people to cross the extensive ocean of worldly existence by their sight or touch.\""},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"111.29.    193    NOTES 1. The word danam is derived in various ways in Sanskrit. Each derivation suggests a certain aspect of the Yogi's self-rea-lization. 2. Kulacara means trikacara - the unity of nara (jiva) Sakti and Siva. EXPOSITION Vrata - observance of a pious act like fasting on a particular sacred day, japa - recitation of a mantra, dana, giving alms in charity may well begin as anavopaya, as kriya-yoga, but the Sutras 26, 27, and 28 say that when the anu or empirical self is advanced in yoga and has realized Self, then vrata, japa, and dana are converted into Saktopaya, then they are lifted from ordinary, routine rituals to the status of mystic practices where they are not merely external routine observances but expres-sions of jnana or Self-realization. INTRODUCTION TO THE 29th SUTRA TEXT TRANSLATION In accordance with what has been described, he becomes similar to Siva. As he is always devoted to vrata, japa and religious practice and has acquired mastery over his group of saktis, he alone is competent to enlighten the seekers about Reality. Therefore, the next sutra says: SUTRA - 29 Yo'vipastho jnahetusca."},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"194    Siva Sutram who; is established in Sakti Cakra; (he) is the means, agency of wisdom; indeed, surely.

How can any body else who is under the sway of sakti-cakra and is thus incompetent to awaken himself enlighten others? With reference to yah (who) in the sutra, sah (he) should be supplied (to complete the sense). The word ca in this sutra has been used in the sense of 'indeed'. Since he has acquired control over the group of saktis and is thus an instrument in enligntenment, it has been rightly said in the 28th Sutra that he disseminates knowledge of Self. Others from the point of view of hermenia which maintains that interpretation should be made in accordance with every letter interpret this sutra thus: Yo suggests Yogindra - a yogi par excellence, vi suggests vijnana - special knowledge, pa suggests pada or state. So pa and sthah which is the final word together make up padasthah which means 'establish-ed in the state'. Jna suggests jnata or knower; he suggests heya - reject-able: tu suggests tucchata - worthlessness; the visarga suggests visarga-sakti - creative energy; the word ca which should not be taken in the sense of 'and' refers to the agent (since an agent is needed). So they interpret the whole sutra thus: 'The great Yogi through the power of Self-awareness is estab-lished in the state of the wisdom of his essential nature. He should be considered to be both knower and doer; 'hetu' stands for the rejectibility and worthlessness or unacceptibility of this world. This interpretation does not appeal to us, for it is not very agreeable from the point of view of consistency of the words of the sutra. Such an interpretation of every sutra can be given in a thousand ways.

Therefore, the world is simply a form of consciousness. Objects are not known by anybody without consciousness. It is cons-ciousness that has assumed the forms of objects. It is through consciousness that objects are ascertained. Through the appli-cation of affirmation and negation, there is division of existents either as positive or negative. The objectivity of existents through the operation of consciousness is only a form of consciousness itself. As knowledge and the known i.e. its objects are apprehended together, therefore are they (knowledge and its object) one and the same.\"5 NOTES 1. Jnanamaya here means, as Ksemaraja in his commentary on Netratantra says, Cinmatra-paramarthah - sheer conscious-ness as the highest Reality. 2. It exists in multitudinous forms through contraction or compression. 3. Netra in its nairuktic or etymological interpretation means niyantritanam tranam - the saviour of the restrained or limited beings. The letter na of netra stands for and the letter tra stands tor It is impossible to bring this out in translation. Siva is called netra (lit. eye), not because He is the physical eye, but because it is He who through His grace reveais His concealed being to them who turn towards Him. It is He alone who both conceals and reveals Himself. 4. Consciousness appears in the external form as a jar or blue, etc., and in its internal form as pleasure, pain, thought, emotion etc."},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"198    Siva Sutram 5. The world, according to this philosophy, is only a congealed form of consciousness. EXPOSITION The advanced Yogi becomes like Siva. His consciousness is now the consciousness of Siva.

INTRODUCTION TO THE 31st SUTRA TEXT TRANSLATION Not only is the universe an unfoldment of his power in the state of its creation, but also in the states following it.

Sthiti or maintenance (of the manifested world) means external appear-ance for some time, with reference to the various experients, of the universe which has come into appearance in consequence of kriya-sakti (creative power). Laya means resting in the experient who is sheer consciousness. These two (sthiti and laya) are only an unfoldment of his (yogi's) sakti or creative power. The various knowable objects which appear and finally revert to their potential state are only a form of his (yogi's) consciousness-power, otherwise (i.e. without assuming cons-ciousness-power), the apprehension of the world would be impossible. Therefore in Kalikakrama 'through the division of existence and nonexistence' has been spoken of only with re-ference to sthiti and laya. So, \"He who experiences that consciousness which is entirely pure, not depending on any support (i.e. object) and is of the same form as one's deeper I-consciousness is liberated while alive; there is no doubt about it.\" INTRODUCTION TO THE 32nd SUTRA TEXT TRANSLATION A doubt arises here, viz., the awareness of the Yogi which is oriented towards objects would suffer a break in the states of manifestation, maintenance of manifestation and dissolution."},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"200    Siva Sutram which differ from one another in the matter of appearance.

As consciousness or awareness is free of appearance or disappearance, there cannot be a real disappearance of knowership. Since it is avidya itself which is spoken of as appearing or disappearing figuratively, how can that (i.e. samvit or conscious-ness or knowership) be said to disappear which by nature never disappears.\"2 The same point has been made out in the following verses of Spandakarika: \"In the highest reality known as Atma (the transcendental Self), there are two aspects called karta3 (subject) and karya4 (object). Of these two, the object is perishable, the subject is imperishable. Only the effort directed towards an object ceases. On its cessation, only an ignorant chap thinks \"I am ruined\".5 Because of the disappearance of another (the object) there can never be the disappearance of the inner nature (subject) which is the substratum of omniscience.\" (I, 14-16). NOTES 1. With the change in manifestation, there is no change in Consciousness, or the Experient, for even change cannot be experienced without an unchanging principle. 2. There can be appearance or disappearance of avidya -the primal ignorance only, not of foundational Consciousness which is indispensable for an awareness of both appearance and disappearance. With the appearance or disappearance of objects, there cannot be any change in the nature of Reality which is ever present and changeless."},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"202    Siva Sutram 3. Karta means the Subject, experient, knower, doer, inde-pendent conscious I. 4. Karya means the object, experienced, knowable, incons-cient, dependent on something else. 5.

Even cessation of effort only means resting of the effort in the subject. EXPOSITION In spite of changes in the form of appearance and disappea-rance of manifestated objects, there is no change in the nature of Reality which is Experience, Awareness, Eternal Subject. As the Yogi's consciousness is that central Awareness, he abides as the Eternal changeless subject. INTRODUCTION TO THE 33rd SUTRA TEXT Of this yogi.

COMMENTARY TEXT"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"111.33.     203     TRANSLATION This yogi considers pleasure and pain born of contact with objects as a mere this - as something external to himself like blue etc. not like the common folk as something pertaining to the I. When the sutra 30 under the 3rd section says that the universe is an unfoldrnent of his sakti (creative power), it means that the whole universe appears as pervaded by his I-consciousness. It does not mean that particular experiences like pleasure and pain are identified with his I-consciousness. This is what this sutra means to suggest. How can the yogi, whose identification with the subtle body as the subject has already been annulled, be affected with pleasure and pain?1 The same has been said in the following commentary of Pratyabhijna-sutra-vimarsini. \"Those who have transcended the state of the limited subject-and entered the stage of a real subject3 do not experience plea-sure and pain even when they are presented by their respective causes. Rather pleasure and pain are not produced in their cases, for the causes of pleasure and pain are absent so far as they are concerned.4 They have only the experience of the natural bliss of divine consciousness.\" This truth has been clearly expounded in the following verse of Spandakarika: \"When there is neither pleasure nor pain5, nor object,6 nor (limited) subject,7 nor state of stupefaction or insentiency8 -that is the state of Absolute Reality.\" (I, 5)."},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"204    Siva Sutram NOTES 1. Pleasure and pain are experiences of antahkarana, the inner psychic apparatus. One who is identified with the psychic apparatus is bound to feel pleasure and pain. But the yogi who is completely detached not only from antahkarana but also from the entire subtle mechanism of puryastaka (the five tanmatras, manas, buddhi and ahamkara) has risen to a state of conscious-ness where he cannot be affected by pleasure and pain. He has transcended the stage of the psychological individual. 2. Limited subject or grahaka refers to Maya-pramata, the subject that is under the sway of Maya. 3. The real subject is Siva-pramata - one who has acquired Siva-Consciousness. 4. Pleasure is caused by raga or attraction, personal interest in something; pain is caused by dvesa or repulsion from something. The yogi has risen above raga and dvesa. So the causes of pleasure and pain are absent in his case. 5. Pleasure and pain are internal objects of experience. 6. Nor object refers to external object of experience like a colour, sound, jar etc. 7. Grahaka or limited subject refers to Maya-pramata, not to the meternpirical subject. 8. If there is no pleasure or pain etc. in that Reality, it does not mean that it is devoid of sentiency. It is the Absolute consciousness in itself. EXPOSITION The consciousness of the psychological individual is relational i.e. there is always relation of a subject to an object, a grahaka grahya-bhumi - a subject-object duality. The transcendental consciousness is non-relational free from the duality of subject and object. The Yogi who has acquired transcendental cons-ciousness is not affected by the psychological states of relational consciousness."},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"111.34    205    INTRODUCTION TO THE 34th SUTRA TEXT TRANSLATION Since the yogi has transcended that stage in which the subject is identified with the subtle body and is unaffected by inner pleasure and pains, therefore he -SUTRA - 34 Tadvimuktastu kevali Free from the influence of pleasure and pain; then, rather; established in his real Self. \"Being completely free from the influence of pleasure and pain, he is rather Alone - fully established in his real Self as sheer consciousness\".

Such being the possibility, if he (the Yogi) is oriented towards creation with strong will, he can, according to his wish also create something common to all people. This has been said in Tattvagarbha: \"When the Yogis shine forth with manifest power of creativity, their want of firmness for creativity is firmly and imme-diately shattered, and then their Will power becomes a Kalpa-taru\".3 NOTES 1.

INTRODUCTION TO THE 38th SUTRA TEXT TRANSLATION Since the use of the word Karana-sakti - the power of creating points to the fact that svatantrya-sakti (absolutic Will power) in the form of turya (the fourth state of consciousness) is the quintessence of the experient who is awareness personified, therefore in order to whet the nature of that turya which is suppressed by mayasakti, the next sutra says: SUTRA - 38 Tripad ady anuprananam. of the three states; principal, pre-eminent, - enlivening,"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"212    Siva Sutram \"Of the three states, there should be enlivening by the main one (which is svatantrya sakti full of creative bliss)\".

This transcendental bliss though veiled by Maya-sakti appears (for an instant) like a flash of lightning on the occasion of the enjoyment of various objects of pleasure. Therefore though that bliss appears only for an instant on the various occasions, one should enliven oneself with it. Anuprananam or enlivening oneself means vitalizing oneself by following more and more the awareness of that bliss which exists within. That is to say one should animate oneself with that vitality. The same has been said in Vijnanabhairava. \"She (parasakti) is bliss that can be experienced within oneself, she can be known only when one is freed of all thought-constructs. She is a state of one's own Self that is Bhairava, hence she is known as Bhairavi, the Sakti of Bhairava. She is one whose essential nature is full of the delight of the unity of the entire universe. She is to be known essentially as the pure form filling (pervading) the entire universe.\" (Verse 15) and then elaborating with the following verses as a means of approach to her, it is said \"At the time of sexual intercourse with a woman, an absorption into her is brought about by excitement, and the final delight that ensues at orgasm betokens the delight of Brahman. This delight is that of one's own Self. (It has not come from anything external. The woman is only an occasion for the manifestation of that delight). O goddess, even in the absence of a woman, there is a flood of delight, simply on account of memory1 in full measure of sexual pleasure in the form of kissing, embracing, pressing etc. On the occasion of a great delight being obtained,"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"214    Siva Sutram or on the occasion of delight arising from seeing a friend or relative after a long time, one should meditate on the delight that has arisen and become absorbed in it, and identified with it. When one experiences the expansion of the joy, delight and rapture of savour arising from the pleasure of eating and drinking, one should meditate on the perfect condition of this joy, and then one would become full of great bliss. When a Yogi mentally becomes one with the incomparable joy of song and other objects, then of such a yogi, there is because of the exaltation of his mind identity with that (i.e. with the in-comparable joy), because he becomes one with it.\"2 (Verses 69-73). The same point has been made out in Spandakarika, beginning with, \"The Spanda3 principle is established in that state in which is placed a man who is extremely exasperated or exceedingly delighted or is utterly bewildered, considering 'What am I to do' or runs to and fro (for the safety of his life)\"4 (I, 22) and end-ing with \"One who is awake is unenveloped (in avidyay (I, 25) This has been conclusively discussed by me in Spandanirnaya beyond the possibility of a doubt. In the sutra Trisu caturtham (III, 20), it has been said that the three viz., waking, dream and deep sleep states should be vitalized with the fourth state; in the present sutra, it has been said that in all conditions in the initial, intervening and the final states, in manifestation, maintenance of manifestation, and dis-solution, there should be a vitalization of awareness with the elixir of the fourth state in the manner described above. This is the special point about this sutra. NOTES 1. Since the sexual pleasure is obtained only by memory even in the absence of a woman, it is evident that the delight is inherent within. It is this delight apart from any woman that one should meditate on in order to realize the bliss of the trans-cendental consciousness. 2. One can turn even a sensuous joy into a means of Yoga.

Spanda=Cosmic pulsation - throb of the divine conscious-ness. 4. Whenever there is intensity of awareness, one should look for the divine principle of activity.

Of such a being, as described by Svacchanda-tantra in the words, 'in such a case, desire is the limiting, taint-ing condition', there is extroversion on account of anavamala known as avidyd or primal ignorance consisting in the feeling of imperfection. Bahirgatih or extroversion means that in him there is always an inclination towards and interest in exter-nal objects, and never an attentiveness to the inner nature.

That is to say, he shines forth in the form of the foundational consciousness as the subject, It is said there itself (i.e. in Kalika-Krama). \"As one who sees certain objects in dream, but does not see them when awake, so the Yogi contemplating over Atma as the sole reality does not see the world (as world)''1 Similarly: \"Rejecting mental modes like existents and non-existents,2 by resorting to the middle position between the two, renouncing the fabrications of imagination such as different and non-diffe-rent by means of the ascertainment of non-dualism, he - the yogi who is always devoted to his essential Self and is intent on destroying Death itself, and is devoted to the state of isolation, can acquire the state of Nirvana\". Kaivalyapadabhag (devoted to the state of isolation) means One who cannot be carried by his senses and tanmatras.\" NOTES 1. After realization, the previous experience of the world appears to the yogi as the experience of a dream. Now he sees the world in a different light - as the glory and splendour of Siva. 2. The concepts of existence and non-existence, different and non-different are the products of the dichotomising activity of the mind, the fabrication of vikalpa.' Freed of this limitation, the yogi sees reality as the background of all mind-made distincts, as lying in the middle of \"either-or\"."},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"111.42    221    EXPOSITION The 40th sutra says that if the aspirant is attached to desires, he becomes extroverted and by the force of the residual traces of his desires inhering in his subtle body is carried forward from one form of existence to another. Attachment to objects of pleasure becomes an obstacle in the path of the aspirant who seeks liberation. The 41st sutra says that the aspirant is not doomed to be shuttle-cocked from one life to another. If he renounces desire and is rooted in the awareness of the transcendental state, he rises above the state of the limited empirical individual and becomes entitled to Nirvana. Nirvana in this system means Siva-sakti-samarasya; the undifferentiated state of consciousness in which subject-object duality ceases for ever. INTRODUCTION TO THE 42nd SUTRA TEXT TRANSLATION A doubt arises here. The ending of the state of the empirical individual connotes the dissolution of the body. But this dissolution of the body is not noticed immediately even in the case of the perfectly awakened (enlightened) yogi. Then how can he be said to be rooted in the awareness of the transcendental state? In order to remove this doubt, the next sutra says: SUTRA - 42 Bhuta-Kancukl tada vimukto bhuyah patisamah parah One who uses the body of the gross elements as a mere covering; then: liberated: abun-dantly - pre-eminently; like Siva: - perfect"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"222    Siva Sutram \"Then i.e. on the ending of desire, he uses the body of gross elements merely as covering and being liberated is pre-eminently like Siva, the perfect reality.

In accordance with the sutra Sarira-vrttirvratam. (111, 26), though hes till exists in the body which is to him like a mere sheath,1 he is not touched even by a trace of the feeling of the body being the subject. It has been said in Kularatnamala, \"When the excellent guru (spiritual director) reveals to the disciple that mystery (of God-Conscious-ness) in its wholeness, then he (the disciple) is undoubtedly liberat-ed at that very moment and afterwards remains in the body only like a machine.2 How much more then the yogi of supreme understanding! If he is established in the highest Brahman with one-pointedness even for a moment, he is liberated himself and liberates other people.\" In Mrtyujit also it has been said, \"If one realizes Reality even for the moment of a blink, he is verily liberated immediately and does not acquire another birth.\" (VIII, 8). In Kulasara also, the same idea has been expressed in the following verse: \"What a glorious eminence of this truth O fair one, if one has even intellectually assimilated it and imparts it to another (lit: to another ear), even that one is liberated instantly.\" NOTES 1. Just as the sword is entirely separate from the sheath which is only a cover for it, even so the liberated one is entirely separate from the body. The body is only a physical covering for the spirit to carry on its function on the physical plane. The consciousness of the liberated one is not at all identified with the sensation of the body. 2. He is no more interested in the body. He lives only mechanically in it. INTRODUCTION TO THE 43rd SUTRA TEXT"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"224    Siva Sutram TRANSLATION A doubt arises here. Why does not even his covering of the gross body fall away when he (the yogi) is liberated? In answer to this question, the next sutra says: SUTRA - 43 Naisargikah pranasambandhah. natural; the link or association of prana -the universal life force, the universal vital principle. \"The link of the universal Life force (with the body) is natural\". COMMENTARY TEXT"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"111.43     225     TRANSLATION Naisargika means that which has come from nisarga i.e. from nature, in other words from the power of Absolute Free Will of the Lord (Svatantrya Sakti). (The link of prana with the body is, therefore, unavoidable). The divine consciousness, with a desire to display the variegated panorama of the universe, at first adopts the principle of contraction, assumes the state of limited experients (jivas) who are a form of pranana - the uni-versal life force which brings about the manifestation of the entire universe in a limited form and also appears in the form of the world as grahya or object.1 This link of prana, therefore, has been initially brought into manifestation by the Absolute, Free Will of the Lord (svatantryat). We find the same idea expressed in Vajasaneya, \"That Sakti (Divine Power) who is the highest, subtle, .all-pervading, absolutely pure, auspicious, mother of the collective whole of saktis, the highest bliss of the nature of immortality, mahaghoresvari2 Canda3 (terrible) brings about both manifesta-tion and withdrawal (of the world process), and she forcibly makes manifest and finally withdraws (prakarsati) Time that expresses itself in the form of the three breath-channels4, (trivaham) in three forms5, (trividham) and in three aspects6, (tristham). Thus it is of the divine consciousness that the func-tion of external manifestation and internal withdrawal has been described in the form of the flow of breath in the three channels, the states of moon, sun and fire and the past, future, and present aspects of external time. The same has been said in Svacchanda-tantra also; \"The life-force appears in the individual as prana and apana with the function of exhalation and inhalation. Always impart-ing life, it exists within one's breast. Since it imparts life, there-fore, is it known as prana.\" (VII, 25)."},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"226    Siva Sutram In accordance with what Svacchanda-tamtra says in the follow-ing verse: \"Ha is said to be prana which functions by itself (i.e. is automatic) and is of the form of a plough\"7 (halakritih) (IV, 257). It is of prana that the function of manifestation (srsti) and withdrawal (samhara) has been described because of its being of the form of the Highest, Absolutely Free Bhairava and because of its out-going and incoming. Therefore, it has been rightly said that the link of prana is natural. So Bhattakallata, in order to confirm the causality of prana has said in Tattvartha-cintamani -\"Consciousness is, at first, transformed into prana.\" NOTES 1. For manifestation, the divine consciousness at first trans-forms itself into prana. This prana is universal Life-force which brings about both subject (grahaka) and object (grahya). 2. Mahaghoresvari is here only another name of Kalasankar-sini Sakti. 3. Canda is another name of the same sakti, She is called Canda (terrible), because she conceals the essential nature of the experient. 4. Trivaham - 'flow of life-breath in the form of three chan-nels' refers to ida (the breath channel on the left of the spinal column), pingala (the breath channel on the right of the spinal column), susumna (the breath channel in the middle of the spinal column). 5. Trividham refers to soma (moon), surya (sun), and agni (fire) symbolic respectively of prameya (object), pramana (knowledge) and pramata (subject). 6. Tristham - three aspects of time, viz., past, present, future. 7. The letter ha is indicative of visarga sakti (Creative power). In Sarada script, the letter ha is of the form of a polugh the upper part of which symbolizes exhalation and the lower part symbolizes inhalation. It is constantly and automatically being sounded inwardly in everyone in an anacka (vowel-less) and andhata form (i.e. in the form of unstruck sound)."},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"111.44    227    EXPOSITION It is samvit or consciousness which is transformed into prana. Prana in this context does not mean life-breath. It means the universal Life-force which brings about both subject and object. It is the connecting link between consciousness and the various vehicles (sthula, suksma, etc) of man. This link is natural. It is this link which maintains the body even when a yogi has acquired Self-realization and has constant awareness of the transcendental consciousness. So the question - 'Why the body does not fall away when the yogi is poised in the transcendental consciousness is meaningless. The body cannot perish so long as the link of prana remains. The yogi cannot commit suicide. The universal Life-force assumes mainly two forms in the individual, viz., prana-exhalation, and apana-inhalation. Prana, the outgoing breath is indicative of srsti-manifestation of the world process, and apana is indicative of samhara - withdrawal of objective manifestation. It is prana, the universal life-force that has dual aspect and thus brings about both the manifesta-tion (srsti) of the objective world and its withdrawal (samhara) back to its source. INTRODUCTION TO THE 44th SUTRA TEXT TRANSLATION So even while the natural association of prana lasts, the yogi who is poised in the fourth i.e. the transcendental consciousness being constantly aware of the inward Supreme I-consciousness abides as a transcendental person (lit., beyond the common).

Madhya means the centre of this inner consciousness i.e. vimarsa or I-consciousness. Being the inner-most of all, that is the main or central Reality, viz., the Supreme I-consciousness. According to the following verse of Kalika-krama, the central I-consciousness is the highest sakti. \"Of that God who is greater than all the gods, and who is supreme consciousness itself i.e prakasa, the highest sakti is vimarsa or I-consciousness, which is omniscient, full of wisdom.\" By the samyama1 or intensity of repeated inward awareness of that supreme I-consciousness, there is (what is to be said in this matter2) in all conditions, radiant, highest nirvyutthana-samadhi3. The same idea has been expressed in the following verse in Vijhana-bhairava: \"The consciousness of subject-object relationship is common to all embodied beings. The Yogis have, however, this distinc-tion that they are ever mindful of this relation\" (i.e., they are always mindful of the para-pramata, the metaphysical subject without which there can be no such thing as an object\", (verse-106). NOTES 1. Samyama here is not to be taken in the technical sense of Patanjali's Yoga which means the threefold practice of dharana, dhyana and samadhi. Here samyama means the intensity of repeated inward awareness. 2. Kimatra or what is to be said in this matter? This is an exclamation, an expression of delight. 3.

In saying bhuyah syat (is again) the intention of the sutra-kara (composer of the sutras) is this - that the Divinity (Siva-hood) of this yogi is not any thing new. It is the very nature of Reality. Only on account of the perversity of one's own thought-constructs brought about by Maya-sakti, the aspirant was not able to recognize it which was there all the while. It is only manifested now by adopting the various means described in this book. May there be welfare (for all)! NOTES 1. Pratimilana - Nimilana - unmilana - pratimilana. Nimilana is that samadhi in which the yogi is completely absorbed inwardly in the supreme I-consciousness.

This commentary on the Siva-sutras beautified by its harmony with the Saiva agamas, and by its consistency with the Spanda-karika has been written to expound the secret of Saiva yoga.(\\) May the pious ones enjoy fully well, for cutting out the shackles that bind them to worldly existence, the commentary on the Siva Sutras named Vimarsini full of everfresh elixir of immortality trickling down from the teaching about the secret doctrine of Siva. (2). This commentary would stimulate the interest of those who are not interested in the doctrine of Siva, would bring about the most excellent transformation of understanding and remove fear of death, old age, birth etc. like a flood of nectar by mere taste of it. (3) Environed by the body, prana, pleasure etc. due to the limited sense of I-ness, man does not realize the doctrine about one's magnificent divine Self. But he who, owing to this teaching, beholds in the midst of the ocean of (spiritual) awareness the universe as a mass of its foam on all sides is said to be Siva Himself in sooth. (4) May you all cross quickly the ocean of transmigratory existence and be established firmly in the highest state full of eternal light and delight.
