Mt Kailasa is the sacred place where wonderful objects such as anjana, paduka, cintamani and others get originated, where untimely death does not occur, where the beings which are mutually opposed (right from their birth) become friendly and affectionate even at the very instant of seeing that peak, approaching which even those persons who have not observed the austere vows and conducts prescribed in the Scriptures become equal to those holy persons who have diligently observed and practised all those vows and conducts, nearing which the persons afflicted with fear and the causes thereof are relieved from such worried and afflicted state and where there is no entry for misfortunes and distress. In that most supreme peak is always present Lord Paramesvra. In the same peak(called Jyotishkampa or Kailasa), was a great Sage who was considered as the Lion among the seers, who was endowed with divine and vibrant form brightened and strengthened by constant penance.

The exposition of this category includes in itself the concepts about the three principles known as laya, bhoga and adhikara. The relation between the enjoyment and the state of being the enjoyer, the principle known as maya-tattva which exists as the supreme source for the provision of enjoyments and the fitting bodies of the enjoying souls, the array and assemblage of bodies and worlds pertaining to suddha-vidya realm, its principal cause known as suddhavidya- tattva, the nature of 41 bhuvanas existing in the maya-tattva and the suddha-vidya tattva, Lord`s Kriya Sakti, His JnanaSakti and the group of 81 padas starting with ‘vyoma vyapi’ for which the abode is in the suddhavidya-tattva – all these are explained in the category known as Sakti.

In its limited state, the soul is dependent, being veiled by anava mala; it is the enjoyer; it is associated with a fitting body. The category known as ‘pasu’, meaning the bound self, is the fourth one in this Agama.

They are the real causes for happiness and misery. The karmic effects are generally known as bhoga.

He is present there, being absolutely free from the state of becoming or evolving. His form is of the nature of the power of knowledge and action(jnana kriyatmaka). It is the ultimate limit of all other forms; highly supreme; capable of pervading even the interior of minute atom(paramanu); capable of pervading the relevant deeds performed in various planes of existence; completely free from the cosmic functions; not affected by desire and aversion; simply known as 'existence' alone; capable of protecting the souls according to their maturity and fitness; free from the beginning and the end; benign and compassionate. Only in a figurative sense, the Lord is said to be the possessor of form.

They cannot produce knowledge related to those things which lie beyond direct perception. Since the form which is of the nature of knowledge and action (jnanakriyatmaka) cannot exist, it cannot be known through these organs. Even inferential knowledge and scriptural knowledge is valid as related to the existing objects only. It cannot reveal the knowledge of a non-existent object.

Their existence is inferred through their qualities(dharmas). This has been declared and ascertained by the statements enshrined in the Agamas which have been revealed by the Lord Himself. Just as the existence of fire is established through the appearance of smoke, even so the existence of Pati is established through His own Saktis.   \u001a\u0014\u0013N &\bS< \u001a\u0014c d\r\u000fR\b\u0004\u0013N \u0012\b\u0010\u0013\u0014#\u0015   \u0012\b\u0010\u0013\u001c< d\r\u000fR\b\u0004e d\r\u000f%\bf\b\u0004 % \u001c\b,.\u0015  g   I\u000e\u0014>\u0006> &\b\u001a^. \u000e0\u001a^\u0013N \r\u000e\r\u001cF\u0004\b#\u0015   \u0018\u0019\u001a\u0014\bA\u001d. . !\u00045\u001d \bF &\u000e7. \r\u001cA&3\bA, /h"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"   \bi<+\r?>\r!A\u001d \r&a\b \u0003j6< \r7k\u000e\r=\bA#   \u0018 l \u0018\b P<\u001d \u0005\u0006\u0007P<\u001d \u000e< \r7\u0004\u001e \u0018\u001cA,\u001d  //   &\u0004\u0006\u0007\bm\r\u0018nO\u001e\u001e \u001c \u000f o\rp\u001d\u001e d\r\u000f#\u0015   \u0011\u000e+\u001fq;\b%\u000f\u001c\u0004\b.<< \u0017\b,  /8   \u0016\u0014;\br- . s\u0014 \u0006 \u0004\u0017\u0006\rtC\bA \u0018\u0010u\u0010\u0014#\u0015   O5\b\u001c\b\u001e !\u0004< \u000e!\u001d\u001e \u001c \u0012%\b\r\u000fvw\u0018\u0012\u0014,\u0015 /\u0001   x\u0018\b\u0004\u0006+\r\u0018 \rK a\u0014>\b\u0004\u001c.< &\u0014\u000e\r=A#   dharmeṇa sādhyate dharmī kvacitkāryeṇa kāraṇam|   kāraṇena kvacitkāryaṁ kvacidāmnāya darśanāt||  9   evamanyonya sādharmya vaidharmyeṇa viniścayāt|   patyurdharmāḥ śaktayastu tāśca sarvatra niḥsṛtāḥ|| 10   śāstre'sminyuktitaḥ siddhā lakṣyante triṣvavasthitāḥ|   paśau pāśeṣu bhogeṣu tateva tritayaṁ punaḥ||  11   saṁyogātpratipattvyaṁ na ca śaktyujjhitaṁ kvacit|   pravartate'svatantratvādacetanatayā tathā||  12   amūrtatvācca kramaśo yathoddiṣṭāḥ parasparam|   vyastānāṁ śaktaye vaktuṁ na kadācitsvarūpakam||  13   upāyo'pi hi taddharmanyāyena samavasthitaḥ| On some occasions, 'dharmi'(the one which possesses qualities) is established through 'dharmas'(qualities); on some other occasions, the cause is established though its effects; sometimes, the effect is established through the cause. The existence of some objects is established by the statements of the agamas. In this way, the existence of so many objects is established through the sameness of nature and dissimilarity present in them. The Saktis are considered to be the qualities of Pati and they always evolve out everywhere from the Lord for the sake of cosmic functions. In this Agama, their existence is established through inference. They are observed to be in three states - as related to pasu, as related to pasa and as related to bhoga. Again, they become threefold, as related to enjoyments(bhoga), ability to enjoy the bhogas(bhoktrutva) and the actual experience(bhogya). Without being impelled and directed by the Saktis, they never become active. Because, they are dependent on intelligent power for their function; they are without consciousness; and they are formless. Therefore, they have been explained as mutually related to each other, in the due order. Never would it be possible to explain their essential nature, treating each one of them as a separate and singular entity. Even in the effective means such as diksha and others, this nature of relatedness between the three(Pati, pasu and pasa) does exist, according to the settled process.   \r\u0012\u001e \u001d &\b\u001a^. \u000e0\u001a^. \r\u000e\u000f\b\u0010\u0006o\b \u00183\u0017\u0012\u0015 \u00183\u0017\u0012,\u0015 /H   \u000ej6+\u0014'< \u0018%\b\u0017\b5.< &&\u00183!\bA\u001d\u001e &\r\u000e5\u0010#\u001d<   &&\b\u0010\u001e < \u0007K\u001c< \u0018\u0019- \u0010\ry\u0014\r\u0005A \u0011\u0012z'\u00123\bA, /Q   \r!@A \r!\u0014\b\r{aA |\u0017\u000e\b \u0014\r\u001c\u0018}\u000e#\u001d \u001d   \u0016\\\b\r\u0013 \u0011\r \u0011\u0019\\\u001e \u0014\u001cF\b\\\u0014\u001c[\u0014\u0014,\u001d\u0015  /X"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"   &\u0012~\r\u000eP\u0004\u001e\u001e \r&a\u001e &\u0012~\b%\u000e\u001e < \u0012\u000e\u0003\b#<\u0015   \u0011\u0018[O\u001e \u0014\r\u001cO\b\u001d \r\u0012\u0014>\u0015 \u0018\r\u0010\u00183\r&, /]   kiṁ tu sādharmya vaidharmya vicāroktyā pṛthak pṛthak|| 14   vakṣyante'mī padārthāste susaṁpṛktāḥ suvistare|   saṁsāre gahane patyū raśmibhiḥ prakaṭīkṛtāḥ||  15   śaktibhyaḥ śaktimānsiddhaḥ hyathavā munipuṅgava|   akṣāṇi prati pratyakṣaṁ manaścākṣamanuttamam||  16   saṁkalpaviṣayaṁ siddhaṁ saṁkalpādeva kevalāt|   prapattavyaṁ munivyāghra kimanyat paripṛcchasi|| 17 These three Realities, namely Pati, pasu and pasa have been told elaborately through the statements formed of deep deliberation and reflections and each of these has been dealt with separately in the concerned chapter considering the common and dissimilar qualities observable between them. They have been explained as closely related to each other, with elaborate details. In view of the cycle of transmigration which is as mysterious as the dense forest, some qualities which are considered as eternal are manifested by the Lord. Some other qualities which are ephemeral are brought out by the Saktis. From the existence of Saktis, the existence of Pati, the possessor of Saktis, is established. O, the foremost sage!, the existence of Pati is established in another way also. The five organs generate the knowledge through direct perception. These organs are external. There is an internal organ known as the mind(manas) which is pre-eminently superior to the external organs. The object recognizable through reflection and ideation alone and not through direct perception is known by the mind when it contemplates with one-pointed attention and when it remains in its own state, being dissociated from the external organs. So the existence of formless Lord could be known by such mind.

It is the primary tattva. It is free from modifications and it pervades everywhere constantly through its inexhaustible energies(Saktis). To a sadhaka who is united with this supreme tattva through relevant diksha, birth does not take place even contemplatively. From the laya-tattva which is associated with such supreme qualities, bhoga-tattva emerges. Being with supreme state of auspiciousness, it is ever free from defilements. Being associated with thousands of luminous rays, it is with exceeding luminosity. Being with innumerable Saktis which promote necessary transformations, it pervades the worlds which are evolved below in the succeeding pure tattvas. Since it undergoes only a partial transformation, it always remains inexhaustible(mahat). Even though it is not differentiated from laya-tattva, it has been mentioned as a separate tattva in the name of bindu. It is with the power of propelling the tattvas and bhuvanas in the lower plane. It exists as differentiated into four planes of existence. Even though differentiated in this way, it is imperishable.   \b\r6 \u0005%A< \r=A \u0018\u000e-e \u00047\b&l \u0018\u0010\u0014D\u0010A,<  8\u0001   \b6\u0014\r\r\u0010\r- . \t\b\u0006 \u000e3A \b60\u0014K\b\"\r\u0005A#.   &K\b\r%\u0019 &\u0012\b 0\r\u000eV\u0010\rWA\u001e.\u001d &\u00146A,  8H   \u0012\u0006z' &K05\u001d \u001f\u000e'\u0004. \u0007\u0013 \b\r\u0003\r\u0005A#\u001d   śānti bhedaḥ sthitaḥ pūrvaṁ yatrāsau parameśvaraḥ|| 23   śāntamūrtiriti khyāto vṛtaḥ śāntairmahātmabhiḥ|   sahasrāditya saṁkāśairvisphuradbhiḥ samantataḥ||  24   koṭīśatasahasraistu svavīrya guṇaśālibhiḥ| First, there is the 'santi bhuvana'.

In the same way He , being with effulgent form, withdraws into Himself pratishtha-bhuvana and all the souls including Amrutamurti. Then He reaches Vidya-bhuvana and withdraws into Himself that bhuvana and all the perfect souls there, including Tejomurti. Next, he reaches santi-bhuvana and performs the dissolution of santi-bhuvana by withdrawing that bhuvana and the souls and Santamuti into Himself. Above these four bhuvanas is 'santyatita bhuvana' which is imperishable and free from modifications. It is in the laya-tattva. The souls whose siva-centered consciousness has been perfectly unfolded by Sadasiva reach this supreme abode and attain the qualities of Siva.

It is occupied by the prominent anga-mantras and brahma-mantras; it is the material cause for the emergence of letters which are of the nature of pure vidya-tattva; not even slightly impaired by false notions; incomparable; filled up with primary saktis which are promoting the evolutions taking place in the pure realm of suddha-tattva. It is the abode of the Lord who is protecting the pure realm of suddha-tattva for the sake of befitting enjoyments to be experienced by the highly perfect souls. Being the material cause for pure vidya-tattva and others, it never goes out of existence and therefore it is endless. It was explained earlier that laya-tattva is not associated with any world.

Since he effortlessly leaves out of state of laya and assumes another state, such effortless activity is figuratively termed as 'play'. He assumes the state of being with a body instantaneously at the very moment He wills to create. Therefore, His form is considered to be constituted of Sadyojata-mantra.

'Seizing'(haranam) here denotes the dissolving of the enjoyments meted out to the 'sakalas'(souls bound with three bonds). Patiently expecting the time of dissolution, Harini takes hold of the subtle body of the sakala-souls and at the time of dissolution this Sakti dissolves the enjoyments very swiftly and is capable of keeping the souls at rest in the field of maya.

The soul, being a dependent one , is experiencing the enjoyments, being caught in the snares of pasa until such bhogas get arrested by Harini.

Strengthened by the vigor (power of knowing and doing) of Sadasiva, this Sakti proceeds to do its work related to the souls and the worlds. Just like the rain water reaches the ground and produces sprouts, even so this Sakti descends in the filed of maya, produces the enjoyments which hitherto were in the form of lingering impressions(vasanas) and nourishes the power of the souls enabling them enjoy the bhogas. Just like the working of father and mother is seen in bringing up the child, even so the working of Janani and Sadasiva whose body is formed of five mantras is seen in the progress of the soul. The subtle deeds of Janani, who is skilful in producing the enjoyments, are well observed in the host of souls. In each birth of the soul, this Sakti functions as its mother.   \b!\u0005\u0004#\\\u0015 9 #\u0007 \u0011\u0012\u0004\u001d,1\t\u001c\u0007\u0004\r\t\u0007>0\u0010\u0019\u0013(   :v\t. \u0011',j\u001c\u0013\u0017 \u00040#\r\u0004o\u0004\t \u0018\u0007\u0004#\u0006\u0007$  \u0001%   #\u0007 ,\r\u000f\u0007( \u0004\u001d\u0005+ \b!/\u0013\u0017 @CU!C\u0004 \t\r\u0019.\u0013\u000e   '\u0004\u001e\u0010 ,\u0007 \b!\u0005\u0004#\u001e\u0007\u0013 #\t! \b!\u0005\u0004#\t\u0007 \u000b \u0010$\u0013  \u00013   rodhayitrī ca yā patyurvisṛtasyāmitātmanaḥ |   lakṣyate paśusaṁghasya niyamasthiti dāyikā ||  41   yā samarthā vidhau roddhuṁ jagadbhogeṣvabhiplutam |   śaktiḥ sā rodhayitryuktā yato rodhayitā prabhuḥ ||  42 The Sakti of Sadasiva which proceeds to stabilize and to obstruct is known as Rodhayitri.
