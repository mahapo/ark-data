It is not one among the 28 Primary Agamas from the Kamika to Vatula. Sarva means all. Jnana means the Agamas. Uttara means beyond, superior . The Agama which is beyond the list of 28 Agamas and which is superior to all other Agams is significantly called Sravajnanottara Agama. Whereas all other Agamas have been revealed to the Supreme Souls of the Pure Realm, Sarvajnanottara Agama has been directly revealed by Lord Siva to Lord Skanda from whom the transmissiom of this Agama has been coming down from time immemorial. Traditionally it is held in the lineage of Gurus that all the concepts of the Agamas are to be understood from the standpoint of Sarvajnanottara Agama. This is the methodology of the Saivagamic studies. The jnana pada of the Savajnanottara Agama is the treasure trove of the philosophical doctrines of Saivism. In this section, Saiva Siddhanta has been presented in its entirety in terms of bhutatma, antaratma, tattvatma, jivatma mantratma and paramatma. Perfectly tuned to the higher principles of the jnana section of this Agama, its yoga section has been formulated. The efficacy of sagarbha pranayama, agarbha pranayama, employment of siva-astra mantra and kshurika-astra mantra in pranayama, the technique of perceiving all the tattvas from pruthivi tattva to sadasiva tattva and that of cutting asunder the limiting bonds born of these tattvas, installing one`s own self eternally in the highest plane of siva tattva and attainment of oneness with Lord Siva – these are the important matters dealt with in this chapter on yoga. The Matanga Paramesvara, Mrugendra, Sivadharmottara and many other texts evidently reflect the yoga principles enshrined in this chapter. Highlighting such reflections, Aghora Sivacharya has written a brief commentary on this chapter. I am thankful to H.H.Bodhinatha Veylan Swamy for providing me with the divine opportunity for translating this important chapter on Sivayoga.

Listen to my instructions on yoga. The term eka’kinah denotes an ascetic who has his mind completely detached from the worldly activities. S’a’ntah means one who is not  harmful , who is with composed and calm mind. Vira’gin.ah denotes  a person who has controlled his mind and senses , on whom Siva`s  Grace has descended and as a result who is deeply intent in the attainment  0f s’ivatva. Yatacitta means the mind which remains effortlessly settled  through breath control and withdrawal of senses.  Two basic disciplines of perfect yoga, yama and niyama, have been indicated  in this verse; The foundation of Yoga as Gurudeva identifies them.

The individual self is the meditator. Mind is meditation. The Great Lord S’iva is the One to be meditated. The attainment of the supreme qualities of S’iva, superior to which there is nothing, is the fruit of meditation. By nature, mind is very powerful in deeply and repeatedly contemplating the one and the same thing. So it is identified with meditation itself – mano dhya’nam. This verse suggests that the disciplines of yoga set forth in this chapter are meant only for those who have already attained sufficient knowledge of the constituent disciplines of yoga such as yama, niyama, pran.a’ya’ma and so forth. The yoga disciplines explained in this chapter are highly advanced and hence the beginners will find it very difficult to understand and to practice them. The term parama ais’varyam denotes the essential attributes of S’iva, which are eight in number, as told in the jn”a’na pa’da of the Savajn”a’nottara Agama.  1. sarvjn”ata’ 2. nitya tr’pti 3.ana’di bodha 4.svatantrata’  5. alupta s’akti 6. ananta s’akti 7. nira’mayata’ 8. vis’uddha deha By dhya’ta and dhya’na, the third one dhyeya, the one to be meditated, is also suggested. _mZm_mZm¡ g_m¡ H¥$Ëdm gwIXw:Io g_o VWmŸ&& 4 hfª ^`§ {dfmX§ M g§Ë`Á` `moJ_ä`goV²Ÿ&"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" ma’na’ma’nau samau kr’tva’ sukha duhkhe same tatha’&& 4 hars”am bhayam vis”a’dam ca samtyajya yogamabhyaset& Keeping the mind balanced well when honored or abused, and in the same way when delighted or distressed and having completely freed himself from being subject to excessive delight, fearfulness and despondency, the sa’dhaka should repeatedly practice the disciplines of yoga. eyÝ`mJmao _R>o aå`o XodVm`VZo ew^oŸ&& 5 ZXrVrao {d{dºo$ dm J¥ho KmoadZo@{n dmŸ& àÀN>Þo M [d{dºo$ M {Z:eãXo OZd{O©VoŸ&& 6 `moJXmof {d{Z_w©ºo$ {Z{d©H$ëno {ZamVnoŸ& s’u’nya’ga’re mat’he ramye devata’yane s’ubhe&& 5 nadi’ti’re vivikte va’ gr’he ghora vane pi va’& pracchanne ca vivikte ca nihs’abde janavarjite&& 6 yogados”a vinirmukte nirvikalpe nir’tape& In the places such as a solitary house, charming monastery, auspicious temple charged with divinity, bank of river not frequented by the people, one`s own house, unapproachable dense forest, sequestered place hidden by the trees, places free from the disturbing sounds and the quite place free from the presence of humans, animals, insects and so forth, in the places free from those which cause hindrances and disturbances to yoga-practice, in the places which are not owned by others and in the places well protected from the scorching heat of the sun, the sadhaka should commence the yoga-practice.

As held in this Agama, the primary bonds are of two kinds – dharma and adharma. They are the innate bonds of all kinds of souls. They exist in the souls as verdigris is present in the copper as its co-born impurity. The words dharma and adharma have not been used here in the normal sense of virtue and non-virtue. Dharma here means the veiling and non-veiling energy known as tirodha’yi s’akti and Adharma denotes the veiling and limiting fetters. Tirodha’yi s’akti veils the souls for some time directing them towards enjoyment and at a particular state of maturity of the souls it turns into guiding and grace-bestowing energy. So it is a veiling and non-veiling bond. This tirodha’yi s’akti, not different from S’ivas’akti, is figuratively called bond(pa’s’a). The adharma bond is of the nature of always veiling and limiting. Both dharma and adharma are co-born with the souls.

For  an individual self, the physical or the gross body (sthu’la s’ari’ra) varies  according to its nature of birth. But its subtle body always remains the  same.
