Although the areas have been examined in Westerntradition also, but the main problem of Western tradition is its approach of behaviorism.Behaviorism, materialism and so on are the fundamental approaches of this tradition,which keep restricted the vision at the surface reality. That’s why in the study ofconsciousness, consciousness is nothing more than mind in West. Consciousness isunderstood as epiphenomenon of material process in psychology and in philosophyalso. But in Indian tradition, the canonical texts interpret disciplines with differentapproach in compare to Western tradition. Unfortunately this tradition has beenpresented with biased view under the colonial effects. Now, to remove thismisinterpretation, there is a new trend of reinterpretation of Indian tradition. Indianphilosophical tradition has been attacked for impoverishing effect through denial ofphysical reality. But this allegation does not fit on the tantric tradition, which is theparallel stream to the Vedas. The tantric schools accept reality of the physicalphenomenon also. Even, in the contemporary Indian philosophy, Aurbindo encompassesboth materialism and spirituality. That’s why he is very close to the tantric tradition.There are so many allegations of the occidental tradition against the oriental tradition,which may be answered through the Tantras, like Tantra possesses same ultimategoal of liberation, but it does not support abandoning the world like the Advaita Vedanta,Buddhist philosophy and Jaina philosophy. Liberation is not a real element; it is thepresence of complete knowledge, so there is no need of abandoning the world. Thisarticle is an attempt to expound the peculiarities of the tantric tradition, particularly theKashmir Shaiva Tantra and philosophy. Kashmir Shaiva Tantra is the rich source forso many research areas. Abhinavagupta (10th century), the most versatile philosopherof Kashmir Shaiva, did rigorous works which throw light into different problems.Kashmir Shaiva tantric school did not get proper attention till some years before. Inthe 19th century, study of Tantras and their philosophy have been started. There arethe sets of facts which are the hurdle for studying the tantras, are to be analyzed.Certainly understanding theories of Abhinavagupta theories is not an easy task due tohis eclectic teaching.The chief characteristic of Indian knowledge tradition is that the schools ofdifferent disciplines do not keep restricted themselves with the certain field. That’swhy a poetician examines his literary theory on the basis of philosophical fundamentals.And a philosopher examines theories on the basis of analyzing grammatical tools.Abhinavagupta is personage who is the philosopher, poetician as well as the tantric.Thus, the impact of his traits is reflected in his texts either NŒ ya§Œstra,DhvanyŒlokalocana, I§varapratyabhij–Œvimra§ini, TantrŒloka and so on."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCHISSN : 2277-7881VOLUME 1, ISSUE 1, APRIL 2012187Abhinavagupta holds command on many disciplines simultaneously. The influence ofthese disciplines is seen easily in his works, like the theory of dhvani is directly relatedto the aesthetics, literary theory or sahitya shastra. He puts the essence of this theoryin his philosophical and tantric arguments.Kashmir Shaiva is philosophical as well as tantric school, so, it keeps so manydivergent ideas together. It reveals open-ended questions on ·adŒºga yoga, aesthetics,cognitive science, feminism, psychology, philosophy of language, poetics and so on.Particularly, the texts of Abhinavagupta throw light into these issues in a deeper way.His texts AbhinavabhŒrat ́, DhvanyŒlokalocana are related to the domain ofaesthetics and poetics. DhvanyŒlokalocana is explained under the shadow of parâvâk, pa§yant ́, madhyamŒ, vaikhar ́. In the last of each chapter, essence of theseelements is exclusively elaborated. The Vij–Œnabhairava examines the yoga andopens the door for the study of mind as well as AbhinavabhŒrat ́ dwells with thecognitive science. In the tantric and philosophical texts, vimar§ana, ŒbhŒsana,h ̈daya, svarasodita parâ vâk, camatkŒra, dhvani- all of these nomenclaturesthrow light into the aesthetics aspect of this school. Even, the structure is explainedunder the frame of aesthetic methodology. The text êivasètra is abound with theaesthetic description, like- nartaka ŒtmŒ (III.9), raºgo’ntarŒtmŒ (III.10). It isthe valuable source for the philosophy of language also since the metaphysicalconstituents prakâúa and vimarœa open the door for such types of research. Anoverall assessment of the position of Abhinavagupta on the §abda in Indian traditionhas not yet been attempted. There is no research work either in the form of scholarlymonograph or thesis or dissertation or edited volume, which presents the philosophy oflanguage of Kashmir Shaiva. Only references are mentioned for the further study inKashmir Shaiva philosophy of language, like the T.V.R. Murti gives a glimpse on thisimportant problem in his paper of The Philosophy of Language in the Indian Contextin this way- The Vedanta, Mimamsa, the Sankhya-Yoga and the school of Grammarand Kashmir Shaiva, among others, are loyal to this tradition”1. In the whole article,he mentions to the Kashmir Shaiva only once.The concept of mantra is taken in different manner. Mantra as the mainproblem in terms of religious and philosophical studies is pursued with threeperspectives- social, cultural and historical. The investigation of mantra is confinedto the limits of lingual parameter, like its phonetic structure, semantic problem and soon. From the semantic point of view, some questions like, ‘are mantras meaningful?’‘If yes, what sort of meaning they have?’ Answer of the former question is somehowknowable on the basis of mantra either vedic or tantric, but the complex aspect isdefining the latter question i.e. sort of meaning, which applies equally well to allpossible cases. One can apply the same reasoning, on one hand, to a mantra thatappears, when one reads or hears it, to have some more or less obvious meaning,1 Murti, T.V.R., “The Philosophy of Language in the Indian Context” in ‘Studies in IndianThought’, p. 362"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCHISSN : 2277-7881VOLUME 1, ISSUE 1, APRIL 2012188and, on other hand, to a series of vedic stobhas or to a tantric mantra made up of asyllable or a group of syllables, forming neither a sentence nor a word? Moreover,sometimes, meaning of tantric mantras can be somehow understood by the interpretedmeaning in the text, like the aham mantra, while the essence of some mantras canbe known only by practice of yoga. Thus, there is a problem of getting the propermeaning of mantras. Another open-ended problem is the layers of meaning ofmantras. Harvey P. Alpher points out toward the problem of the linguistic utteranceof mantra. He raises this problem-I believe that one could frame an argument to demonstrate the linguistic natureof mantra, but I do no attempt to do so here. Another possibility might be to argue thatostensibly non-linguistic mantras must be understood analogically with those that arelinguistics, rather than vice versa. Or one might argue that the utterance of mantra isa linguistic act in that it functions linguistically2.In the same article, he focuses into some new perceptive of tantric mantrascomparing with the Game theory of Wittgenstein. In his words-I draw upon the Wittgensteinian tradition because I believe that it provides a usefulpoint of departure for the description of the mantra. Wittgenstein’s late works-posthumously published ‘Philosophic Investigations (1953)’, On Certainty (1972) andZettle (1967b)-may be read as sketching out the grounds for a typology of linguisticuses. They suggest a strategy for discriminating among the different ways in whichwords are used that can help establish whether a peculiar sort of utterance, such asa mantra, makes sense or is merely gobbledygook. In other words, Wittgensteiniancategories may provide a philosophical vocabulary in whose terms one can establishwhether a linguistic, whether it has a meaning, reference, and point, and, if so, whatare the meaning, reference and point3.In the same direction of linguistic domain, one of the relevant issues concerningmantra is its intentionality (vivak·Œ), since Mimamsa school stands with theintentionality of language. It often means more than what is actually said. So, doesmantric utterance possess any intentionality? Stall brings out comments on Vedicrituals regarding the intentionality of mantra4 and denies its participation. Unlike tothis, Padoux does support intention of tantric ritual, but the intention of the user ofmantra is accepted rather than mantra’s intention. Accordingly, how a mantra canbe used without some reason? It is not uttered as an involuntary noise but for apurpose: an intention is surely is always there. More specifically, tantric texts onmantra§Œstra always assign a use (viniyoga), and thus a purpose to mantra. Clearlysuch an intention is not that of the mantra but of its user. It can be attributed onlymetaphorically to the mantra itself. An ambiguity as to where the intentionality lies,however, is kept up in such systems as the Shaiva non-dualist ones, which treats2 Alper, Harvey P., “The Cosmos as Œiva’s Language Game” in ‘Understandingmantras,’ p. 285, end note num: 9.3 Alper, Harvey P., “The Cosmos as Œiva’s Language Game” in ‘Understandingmantras’, p. 252.4 Staal, Frist, “Vedic Mantras” in ‘Understanding Mantras’, p. 119."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCHISSN : 2277-7881VOLUME 1, ISSUE 1, APRIL 2012189consciousness and mantras as identical at their highest levels.’ According toOberhammer-By means of wish to contemplate or experience—effects in the meditating subject—an intentionality that opens him radically for encountering the reality of Œiva5.The mantra appears as strengthening this intentionality. According toOberhamer, it is a means for the contemplation of the godhead. The characteristics,mantras possess, differ from ordinary language as they do not abide entirely by itsrules, sometimes as to their forms, always as to their use. Mantra can be understoodas a tool of action and thought-producing or thought sustaining devices. The innerorganization of mantras and especially, their phonetic structure are more importantthan their obvious meaning. They are the part of ritual performances outside of whichthey cannot really be understood. There are cases where mantras are the deity’svâcaka in Vedic performances. All these peculiarities inspire to call it as magicalformula by and large. But the term magical formula misrepresents the concept sincethe magic word signifies the art of producing illusion. Although, magic indicates intothe art of producing a desired effect or result through the use of incantation or variousother techniques that presumably assure human control of supernatural agencies orthe forces of nature. The term like supernatural or natural is an ambiguous term asthese Western terminologies are not able to connote the South Asian concepts fully.Andre Padoux strictly refuses using this inappropriate translation since mantra is notrelated to such a limited area of magic, but how? The answer is found in the statementof Padoux-One might be tempted simply to consider mantras as examples of the magicaluse of language. But, the explanation by magic alone, though useful, seems inadequate.First, because the uses of mantras are not restricted to what may legitimately becalled magic, which, even in Tantrism, is only a limited part of a vast amount ofpractice and speculation on the holy or sacred, of which magic is but a profane orprofanatory handling. Second, and even more important, because, the distinctionbetween magic and religion, always a difficult one, is practically impossible in thecase of Tantrism, where one can seldom know where the domain of the holy ends orwhat exactly is profane6.The word magical always restricts the power of mantra. It is the misinterpretationof the term mantra. Same way, the term linguistic formula restricts it with so muchlimited sense. Fundamentally, mantra is very powerful concept which cannot beunderstood as a simple magical formula or linguistic formula. Even, in Kashmir Shaivaphilosophy, mantra is established as an essential characteristic of the consciousness.That essential characteristic of consciousness becomes the potency of mantras whichis practiced at lower level. The potency of mantra is called mantrav ́rya technically.In this way, mantra can be examined under the domain of metaphysics, ontology,5 Padoux, Andre, “ Mantras-What are They?” in ‘Understanding Mantras’, p. 307.6 Ibid, p. 303"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY EDUCATIONAL RESEARCHISSN : 2277-7881VOLUME 1, ISSUE 1, APRIL 2012190epistemology, rituals and meditations in this school.In addition, the historical development is itself a relevant area. In this context,first part of late K.C. Pandey’s work, Abhinavagupta: An Historical andPhilosophical Studies and recently published Kashmir Ki Shaiva Sanskriti mainKula and Krama Mat of the contemporary scholar Navjivan Rastogi and Sandersons’sworks are helpful to understand the foreground for the research study. The works ofGopinath Kaviraj is also significant from the point of view of historical, sociologicaland theoretical. The perspective of the interrelation of Kashmir Shaiva with theBuddhist school, Nyaya Vaisheshika, Mimamsa in respect of the development ofthought and place of origination is another problem. Interpretation of theories fromritual approach of Kashmir Shaiva, interrelation between Pancaratra Agama andKashmir Shaivagama, ontological study in terms of comparing the Vedanta andSankhya yoga, Bhartrihari’s impact on Trika system, study of vyakarana in relation tothe Abhinavagupta, ontological status of upŒyas, relationship of Pratyabhij–Œ withthe Nyaya school, ontic status of padŒrtha, study of v ́rya in terms of aesthetics,importance of pratibhŒ in aesthetic and philosophy are problems which are stilluntouched.In this way, the monistic Kashmir Shaiva philosophy and Tantra is significant tothe indological research. The materials which are available in the texts of the KashmirShaiva are able to answer to many allegations against Indian knowledge tradition aswell as it provides new dimensions to the Indian philosophy.REFERENCES-•Abhinavagupta, Bodhapa–cŒda§ika, (Eng. tran.)
