These restrictions are meant to carefully filter the lis-tening public in the case of oral transmission, and to impose limits oncopying and circulation, and later on the printing, of the written word.As a result of these restrictions, complex strategies of encoding and dou-ble speech and writing were developed, which enabled the transmissionof secret information to the worthy elect, without preliminary filtering ofthe congregation of listeners or readers. Esotericism as a general attitude,in distinction from actual esoteric practice, is a tendency to view canoni-cal texts, social phenomena, or even individual behavior as a form ofcoded manifestation that intentionally conceals something deeper andmore meaningful that only the few can decipher. In that respect esoteri-cism as an interpretative outlook reflects a consciousness of the existenceof something concealed and hidden, whose knowledge or experience is of decisive or even redemptive import; this consciousness is expressedthrough a wide variety of conceptions. What the variations of esotericconsciousness have in common is the assumption that, behind what is re-vealed, there exists a purer, deeper, and truer level of meaning. Conse-quently, esoteric teachings express varying levels of alienation from thesurface of existence, from revealed religion or from the external aspectsof human behavior. At the most alienated pole of the esoteric conceptionstands the Gnostic position, which sees human beings as hostages of anevil, scheming demiurge; it offers esoteric knowledge of the existence of aforeign and pure god, external to the universe. This knowledge liberateshumans from their bondage. While not all esoteric structures create such a severe tension between the revealed and the hidden, the basic po-sition of distance and alienation is common to all of them. Opposed tothe alienated, Gnostic esotericism, we find positions that view the eso-teric not as a substitute for the domain of the revealed, but as a kind of deeper understructure for it, which endows the revealed surface withmeaning. In these conceptions, the revealed surface of existence, the sa-cred scriptures, and, sometimes, human behavior as well become sym-bolic structures that designate and signify something concealed that liesbeneath them.The esoteric mentality is embodied in various forms of thought. It ap-pears in theological and magical contexts, in which hidden knowledge of the godhead and the universe are transmitted, or else as a method"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"of exegesis of canonical works disclosing an encoded level of meaning.Esotericism also has a secular form, in which it serves as the basis for so-ciopolitical explanations, which assume that nothing is as it appears, andthat society is, in fact, governed by secret organizations pulling on hiddenstrings. In its political contexts, the esoteric mentality is a breedingground for a multitude of conspiracy theories, which assume hidden cen-ters of power behind what appear to be individual, unrelated actions.The psychoanalytic conception, which maintains that a repressed, guardedregion of consciousness guides people’s actions, is also a complex instance of the esoteric conception.The remarkably varied structure of esoteric knowledge includes multi-ple complex techniques for approaching the hidden: the adoption of aprecise and strict method of thought in order to penetrate the deep meta-physical structure of being, entering alternative states of consciousness to facilitate insights from other planes, the use of various magical tech-niques, the interpretation of dreams and their analysis for the purpose ofrevealing the repressed level of the self in order to overcome internal cen-sorship, and many, many others.Some theories on the universe or on society are extremely remote fromthe revealed surface of things. Examples include modern physics, whichpostulates the existence of particles which have never been observed, orMarxism, which maintains that the ideological and economic structureof society is determined by the level of development of the means of pro-duction. Yet the enormous gap between these theories and what is re-vealed on the surface is not sufficient for them to be considered esotericteachings. In addition to the existence of such gaps, esoteric conceptionsclaim that the existence of the esoteric is dependent on intentional con-cealment and camouflage (which does not hold true, for example, in thecase of modern physics), or that essentially the esoteric may only be ex-pressed through indirect symbols. We might say that what is common toall types of esotericists is the metaphor of the key. Esotericists do not understand, interpret, and explain; rather, they open, decipher, liberate or expose.1Naturally, strictly esoteric traditions were not written down at all. Oraltransmission enables control over the identity of the receivers and con-stant supervision over what is revealed and clarified through the mediumof conversation. Writing, even if in veiled form, is a relaxation of thestrictest restrictions of esotericism. One who writes down his words seeksto transcend the gaps of space and time between himself and his readers,who are not his immediate conversational partners. Once the words havebeen committed to writing, he may no longer restrict access to them, unless he took care to write in a veiled or hidden fashion.2The Midrashutilizes the distinction between the written and the spoken in the context2•Introduction"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"of the anti-Christian polemic, in order to explain the existence of theOral Law:Rabbi Yehuda bar Shalom said: Moses requested that the Mishna toobe given in writing, but the Holy One, blessed be He, foresaw that the nations would translate the Torah and read it in Greek and say,“We are Israel.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses, “I shallwrite him most of my Torah,” and thus “they shall be considered asstrangers” (Hosea 8:12). Why should He do this? Because the Mishnais the mysterionof the Holy One, blessed be He, and the Holy One,blessed be He, divulges his mysterionto the righteous alone, as it iswritten (Psalms 25:14), “The secret of God is for those who fear Him.”(Midrash Tanhuma, Vayera, 5)The translation of the Written Torah is described in this passage as anact of usurpation of an exclusive relationship—a kind of theological andliterary theft committed by Christianity. Avoidance of writing down theMishna, which is called “The Holy One, blessed be He’s mysterion,” en-sures the exclusivity of Israel as God’s chosen ones and confidants. Besidesthe link forged by the Midrash, between esotericism and oral transmis-sion, this passage illustrates another important element of esotericism—the link between esotericism and status.3The restrictions on the dissemi-nation of knowledge, and the relation between knowledge, status, andpower give esotericism an important role in determining social stratifica-tion.4Esotericism is, among other things, a means of protecting the priv-ileged position of a group in the society by limiting the dissemination ofthe knowledge that endows it with its status.5For many of its devotees, esotericism is as well a way of protecting themultitude or the uninitiated from the destructive power of truth. At theroot of the elitist political esoteric outlook, as Leo Strauss developed it, is the idea that social order will collapse under complete conditions oftransparency.6Plato’s Seventh Letter is the foundational text of the eso-teric obligation on the philosophers. The letter represents an argumentagainst the explicit and clear writing of philosophical matters whichought to be restricted only to the initiates. If philosophy is the love oftruth as a way of life, it must go underground since it poses a seriousthreat to the social order which is inherently established on myth. Theharsh lesson that was drawn from the fate of Socrates is that the Poliswould not tolerate public undermining of its accepted myths, and thephilosopher is advised to carve a hidden space in which he can pursuetruth without undermining the social structure and without endangeringhimself. The problem of transparency extends beyond the political structureand institutions to the self. It might be argued that not only social orderand institutions will collapse under complete conditions of transparency,Introduction•3"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"but the self will be undermined if it becomes completely transparent to itself. After all, repression and its relative self-deception are necessary formsof self-maintenance. It is no wonder that Freud draws on the analogy be-tween censorship in the social and political context, and the workings ofthe internal censor who blocks from consciousness distressful mental ma-terial. After explicating the function of the internal censor in distortingthe wishful contents of dreams, Freud makes the following claim:A similar difficulty confronts the political writer who has disagreeabletruths to tell to those in authority....A writer must beware of the cen-sorship, and on its account he must soften and distort the expression ofhis opinion. According to the strength and sensitivity of the censorshiphe finds himself compelled either merely to refrain from certain formsof attack, or to speak in allusions in place of direct references, or hemust conceal his objectionable pronouncement beneath some appar-ently innocent disguise; for instance, he may describe the dispute between two Mandarins in the Middle Kingdom, when the people hereally had in mind are officials in his own country.7Veiling is therefore a constant, necessary feature of our limited and im-perfect social and psychological condition. It is no wonder that in the his-tory of esoterically minded ideologies, redemption is conceived to be theachievement of transparency, both within mystical tradition, but alsowithin psychoanalytic conception of health and harmony. (It is worth-while noting that the word apocalypsemeansunveiledorrevelation.)This book seeks to achieve a dual aim: the first is historical and cul-tural, and the second conceptual and philosophical. The historical andcultural focus aims to examine the phenomenon of esoteric teaching inJewish medieval tradition in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries in itscultural and social contexts. The attention devoted to this particular pe-riod through the prism of esotericism is no accident, since the idea of theesoteric in Jewish tradition blossomed in this period. The main streams inJewish thought in this period—philosophy, Kabbalah, astrology, andmagic—presented their positions as the expression of the authentic Jew-ish esoteric tradition. The major writings of this period were consecratedto expounding the esoteric level of Jewish tradition; as such, they toowere written as texts of an esoteric nature, and so concealed, to some ex-tent, their internal meaning. The second focus of this book, the conceptualand philosophical, aims to extrapolate from the wealth of the historicalmaterial a taxonomy of the esoteric phenomena, and structural featuresand paradoxes that are implicit in it. Disclosing these features will help to illuminate esotericism as a general philosophical concern as it stands at an interesting intersection of hermeneutics and political theory. Therelevance of esotericism to hermeneutics and political theory stems from4•Introduction"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"both its presumed role in reading and interpreting texts, and from its reflecting a basic mode of power and its relationship to truth.In line with these dual aims, the first (and larger) portion of the bookis devoted to a detailed analysis of the medieval Jewish case of esoteri-cism, while the latter portion deals with the conceptual structures thatcan be drawn from the historical case. The historical analysis is guided bythe following questions: What are the internal justifications that esoterictraditions provide for their own existence, especially in the Jewish world,in which, apparently, the democratization of knowledge was of great im-portance? How do esoteric teachings co-exist with the revealed tradition,and what is the relationship between the various esoteric teachings thatcompete with that revealed tradition? How does the idea of esotericisminfluence the development of elites and secondary elites and the categoryof the masses? How does the disclosure of esoteric teachings take place,and what happens once those teachings are revealed? Is there any commonground between the esoteric traditions that claim that revealed religionhas a deep structure, which constitutes the climax of religious drama?Answers to these questions will enable a closer examination of the con-ceptual and philosophical concerns of esotericism.We may rightly call the twelfth and thirteenth centuries the age of eso-tericism and its disclosure. The rise of esotericism in the twelfth centuryis not restricted to any single movement within the Jewish world. Esoteri-cism appeared as a central element in works of different and sometimesopposing orientations—in Sefer Habahir, in Rabbi Abraham Ibn Ezra’scommentary on the Torah, and in Maimonides’ Guide of the Perplexed.This tendency continued throughout the thirteenth century, for examplein the early compositions of the Hasidim of Ashkenaz and in the writingsof Nahmanides. In that century, however, and especially in the fourteenthcentury, the boundaries of the esoteric began to be tested and cracked,partially as a result of the composition of dozens of commentaries on thehidden levels of the esoteric canon in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.The rise of esotericism in these centuries is a phenomenon that demandsexplanation. Why did esoteric teachings flower in this period, and whatis the dynamic that led to their disclosure?The history of esotericism in these centuries embodies the tension be-tween concealment and disclosure intrinsic to the esoteric idea. We maystate at the outset that the act of announcing the existence of the esotericis the beginning of its disclosure. A guarded secret, by its very nature, isone whose very existence, and not just content, remains unknown to allbut those directly concerned. But, as we shall see, the esotericists of theMiddle Ages felt it important to guard the esoteric while at the same timeannouncing its existence. Consequently, in this period, esoteric teachingis marked by an unresolved tension between concealment and exposure.Introduction•5"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"The analysis of the various positions of Jewish esoteric teaching com-prises the majority of research into medieval Jewish thought, both inquantity and in quality. The major movements in this thought presentedthemselves as the esoteric core of Jewish tradition and as its internal, deepmeaning. Nonetheless, the phenomenon of esotericism—independent of itsparticular content—has been little discussed. The pioneering work of LeoStrauss dealt with esotericism as a substantive element in the relation be-tween philosophy and society; recently, Sarah Klein-Breslavy systemati-cally analyzed the concept of esotericism in Maimonides.8Several scholarshave dealt with this concept in the kabbalistic tradition: Gershom Scholem has published and analyzed, among other texts, the importantepistle of Isaac the Blind on the dissemination of the Kabbalah. YosefDan has described and analyzed the esoteric tradition in Ashkenaz and its dissemination by Rabbi Eleazar of Worms. Moshe Idel has identifiedimportant elements of esotericism in the Kabbalah in general, and in theKabbalah of Nahmanides in opposition to the kabbalists of Gerona.Yehuda Liebes and Elliot Wolfson have analyzed the doctrine of esoteri-cism in the Zohar. My own study of the medieval Jewish sources will beconducted in a dialogue with the previous scholarship.My initial focus on the medieval history of the phenomenon of esoteri-cism as such, rather than on the particular doctrines of the esotericist,serves the dual aim of this book. It is probably right to claim that everysystematic picture of the world is created by elites, yet in most cases suchelites address the community as a whole. With esotericism, which pro-hibits dissemination of its material and transmits its knowledge throughhints only to the initiates, a completely new dimension emerged in whichdoctrines were not only created by the elites, they were also addressedonly to the elites. It might be the case that capable readers of revealedteachings form an elite as well, since they have been selected by virtue oftheir knowledge and education. Even when the revealed teachings werealready aimed to the elite, esoteric teachings were addressed to an elitewithin the elite. Nahmanides’ commentary on the Torah, for example,has been widely available from the end of the thirteenth century onward.In this popular text, Nahmanides inserted cryptic comments concerningconcealed layers of the Torah, introducing them with the formula “byway of truth.” Many of his readers, even the immensely learned amongthem, have no way to understand such hints, and so skip these lines. LikeNahmanides’ esoteric commentary, the great corpuses of medieval Jewishthought, such as Maimonides’ Guide of the Perplexedand the esotericlayers of Ibn Ezra’s commentary on the Torah, were created by the elitesfor a narrow group of elites. The actual doctrines produced by these eliteswere completely different from one another. The relationships betweenphilosophers, kabbalists, and astrologists were complex and sometimes6•Introduction"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"full of rivalry and tension. Yet the unity of their esoteric structure pointsto something deep which they shared in facing the community at large.Exploring and uncovering the reason why in the medieval period the Jew-ish elites did not address the community regarding major dimensions oftheir doctrines, but rather limited their doctrines to a narrow circle of ini-tiates, contributes to a deeper understanding of medieval Jewish thoughtand its crisis.Exploring the full scope of the medieval obsession with the concealedexposes the paradoxical features of the esoteric phenomena. Amongother things, the uncovering of the presence of esotericism within a rangeof contradictory movements and teachings such as philosophy, Kab-balah, and astrology reveals a far more complex and subtle phenomenol-ogy of esotericism than what Leo Strauss understood. The rich historicalmaterial therefore enables a closer examination of the structural and phenomenological dimensions of esotericism. These phenomenologicalfeatures will be developed as our inquiry proceeds with the historical material, and they will become sharper and clearer in the last, concep-tual section of the book. Since the book aims to achieve a dual goal, itmay also have a dual readership. The reader who is interested in the gen-eral problem of concealment and transparency in philosophy and politi-cal theory but is not particularly interested in medieval Jewish thoughtwill naturally shift his focus to the last section of the book, which can beread independently. Yet since I take the historical material as an enlarged,complex experiment in esotericism that highlights many of its structuralfeatures, such a reader may want to join me and other readers through adetailed journey through the history of medieval esotericism. The journeyinto the depth of the esoteric imagination has to begin with the examina-tion of the early features of the esoteric idea in Jewish tradition, as foundin talmudic sources and in the earliest layer of esoteric writings—theHekhalot literature.9Introduction•7"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1The Paradox of Esotericism: “And Not on the Chariot Alone”The classical foundationaltext for the existence of a realm of secret knowledge within Jewish tradition is the Mishna in the tractateHagiga 2:1:The [subject of] forbidden sexual relations may not be expounded be-fore three persons, nor the work of creation before two, nor [the workof] the chariot before one alone, unless he is a sage and understands ofhis own knowledge. (p. 59)More than any other source, this Mishna—which dates to the secondcentury, though it might reflect earlier traditions—granted legal authorityto the claim that there is a secret dimension to the Jewish tradition. It issmall wonder that many esotericists called their teachings ma’ase merk-abah(the work/vision of the chariot). An analysis of this Mishna yieldsseveral important insights. The area of knowledge for which the group ofstudents must be filtered and access restricted is related to certain speci-fied portions of Scripture. “The work [vision] of the chariot” and “thework [narrative] of creation” deal with the opening chapters of Genesisand Ezekiel, respectively, as is evidenced in another passage of theMishna.1The exposition of these passages is proscribed outside closed,restricted contexts. The secret whose dissemination is prohibited by theMishna is not located in the hidden exegetical level of the biblical text asa whole, but in certain specified chapters.2At this point, we may alreadystate that the idea that all of Scripture has a hidden esoteric level, whichruns parallel to its external meaning—an idea of profound import in theMiddle Ages—finds no expression in talmudic literature. Moreover, itseems that the exegesis of passages of Genesis and Ezekiel is not under-stood as the employment of a unique technique of interpretation, reveal-ing esoteric levels of these passages. The Mishna mentions a dispute as towhether the chapters of Ezekiel dealing with the chariot may be read inpublic, but according to all opinions, they may not be expounded, even ifthe method of exposition is the same as that used for other chapters ofScripture.3Thus, the Bible has no esoteric meaning which must be re-stricted to those with occult wisdom; rather, Scripture possesses certainpassages which may not be expounded, even before a limited audience.4"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Whereas the Talmud formulates esotericism as a restriction on the studyof certain texts, the medieval concept treats esotericism as an exegeticallevel of Scripture in its entirety; this distinction demonstrates the ex-tremely innovative character of the medieval concept as an approach thatis hermeneutic in nature.The idea that the text possesses a level of hidden meaning, and the de-velopment of ramified exegetical techniques for exposing it, radicallychanged the concept of Torah. This idea first appears in a magical textcalledMa’ayanHokhmah, which is a kind of introduction to a work en-titledShimushei Torah. This source, discussed by Idel and dated to theeighth or ninth centuries,5is an expansion of the aggadahin the tractateShabbat (88b) that describes the ascent of Moses to the heavens to re-ceive the Torah. There follows a dispute before God between the angelsand Moses over his right to receive the Torah, which is designated as “ahidden treasure.” Moses overcomes the angels and receives the Torah,and they, according to the aggadah, become his admirers: “Immediately,each and every one became his admirer and gave him something, as it iswritten, ‘You went up to the heights, you took captives, to take tributefor men’ ” (Psalms 68:19). The anonymous author of the introduction toShimushei Torahspecifies what the angels gave him: ‘and all the minister-ing angels became his lovers, and each and every one gave him a tech-nique of healing and a secret of the names which are contained withineach and every passage and all their uses, as it is written, ‘you went up tothe heights, you took captives, to take tribute for men.’ ”6Thus, withineach and every passage lies concealed an esoteric level containing namesof God which can be used in magic, and these secrets were transmitted toMoses by the angels. The secret of God’s essence is encrypted in the HolyScriptures, and the knowledge of these secrets grants man possession ofmagical powers.The idea that Scripture contains meanings that can be unveiled throughunconventional means of exegesis is already present in pre-medievalmidrashic literature. According to certain midrashic conceptions, Scrip-ture encrypts meanings that are not apparent in its direct reading. Theseconceptions, however, do not assert that Scripture possesses an esotericlevel dealing with the godhead’s internal life and essence, alongside the primary layer of textual meaning. The Torah, according to certainmidrashic conceptions, has a semantic fullness; thus it must be treated asa text that has no lacunae or superfluities, and which does not speak inthe language of humans. Exposition of prepositions and conjunctionssuch as etandgam, which are attributed to Rabbi Akiba and his school,are an expression of the semantic fullness of the text. The matters derivedfrom these exegetical techniques, however, are on the same level of mean-ing as those derived from the revealed levels. For example, let us analyzeThe Paradox of Esotericism•9"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"the following expository passage, in which etis an untranslatable prepo-sition marking the relationship between a verb and its direct object, andv’is a conjunctive prefix meaning “and”: “ ‘Honor (et) thy father and(v’et) thy mother.’ ‘(et) thy father’—that is your father’s wife. ‘(et) thymother’—that is your mother’s husband. The extra letter vav[inv’et]comes to include your older brother” (Ketubot 103a). From the preposi-tionetthat precedes the honor of the mother, the rabbis derive that a sonis obligated to honor his mother’s husband even if he is not his own fa-ther. Honoring the husband of the mother is an extension of the honorgranted to the mother, and it is accordingly derived from the etthat isjuxtaposed to the mother. The same technique is applied by the Talmudto extend the obligation to the father’s wife. The exegesis of the words etand the additional letter vavis based on the conception that nonconven-tional exegetical criteria must be applied to the sacred scriptures, sincethe text possesses absolute semantic fullness. The meanings derived fromsuch exegesis, however, have no special relation to the realm of the secretor the sublime, the magic or the divine. The laws derived from these typesof exposition are of the same status as other laws; in our example, theydeal with the organization of authority relations within the family. Themost appropriate metaphor for this midrashic conception of Scripture isnot the multileveled text of the esoteric conception, but rather the full,dense text. The exposition of etdoes not reveal an accompanying deeperlevel, but rather fills out all possible gaps within the text itself.We have thus identified two concepts of esotericism—passages thatmay not be interpreted and a hidden exegetical level. This distinction iscrucial for the history of the esoteric idea. The passage in Mishna Hagiga2:1, however, contains a linguistic ambiguity that opens possibilities toan entirely different understanding of the text. Whether this understand-ing is true or not, the very raising of the possibility points to an internaltension within the esoteric idea, a tension that will break forth at laterstages in its development. The accepted reading of the Mishna is that itsets maximal conditions for the exegesis of certain passages. One may teachthe passages on incest only among two people and no more, the work ofcreation to no more than one student, while the work of the chariot maynot be taught even to a single student, unless the student is of exceptionalcapacities. According to this reading, the verb dorshin(to expound) means“to teach,” whereas the expressions bishlosha,bishnayim, and b’yahidmean “before three,” “before two,” and “before one.” The title “a sage andunderstands of his own knowledge” applies to the qualities of the indi-vidual student, before whom one may expound the work of the chariot.There is, however, an opposing way of reading the Mishna. In thisreading, the Mishna establishes minimal rather than maximal criteria: itis prohibited to investigate the work of the chariot alone. It must be studied10•Chapter One"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"with another person unless the learner is a sage who understands of hisown knowledge. Thus, we should read the Mishna as follows: “Nor thework of the chariot alone”—but two may do so. The verb lidrosh(to ex-pound) in rabbinic language does not require that there be an audience;rather, it refers to investigation and commentary which may take placebefore students or in public, but not necessarily so.7Thus, the Mishnadoes not direct its rules to the teacher, but to the learner. If the Mishna es-tablished mimimal criteria, we should not understand the word beyahidas meaning in front of a single person, and the word dorshinis not toteach but rather to interpret. Furthermore, hakham umevin mida’ato—“a sage who understands of his own knowledge”—is not a title ascribedto the student, but to the learner/interpreter.8According to this reading,study of the work of the chariot requires at least two, but if a person is asage and understands of his own knowledge, he may study this topic alone.This reading of the Mishna is rejected, however, by the text of the Tosefta:“The [passage on] forbidden relations may not be expounded (dorshin)before three, but it may be expounded before two; the work of creationmay not be expounded before two, but it may be expounded before a sin-gle person; the chariot may not be expounded even before one, unless heis a sage and understands on his own” (Tosefta Hagiga 2:1, p. 380).9Itmay be that the Tosefta’s additions to the words of the Mishna—“but it maybe expounded before two. . . but it may be expounded before a singleperson”—were designed to alter its meaning. Indeed, some scholars viewour second suggested reading as the original meaning of the Mishna.10The reason for such a minimal requirement is explained in the passagecited by Rabbi Yehuda of Barcelona, at the beginning of the twelfth cen-tury, in his commentary on Sefer Yetzira:We have found in a text of the early scholars as follows: When ourforefather Abraham was born the ministering angels said before the[Holy One] blessed be He: Creator of the universe, you have a belovedone in the world, and yet you conceal something from him? Immedi-ately, the Holy One, blessed be He, said: would I conceal somethingfrom Abraham? He consulted the Torah and said to her: my daughter,come and let us betroth you unto my beloved Abraham. She replied tohim: no, not until the humble one [Moses] comes and will betroth humil-ity. Immediately, the Holy One, blessed be He, consulted Sefer Yetzirawho said: yes. He transmitted it to Abraham who sat alone and stud-ied it, but he could not understand a thing. Finally, a voice (bat kol)came from heaven and said to him: do you wish to compare yourself tome? I am One and I created the Sefer Yetziraand studied it, and youcannot understand it alone; choose a friend and investigate it togetherand you shall understand it. Immediately, Abraham went to Shem hisThe Paradox of Esotericism•11"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"teacher, and sat and studied with him three years, and they investigatedand knew how to create the world. And to this day there is no manwho can understand it alone, only two wise men [together]; and theycannot comprehend it in less than three years, and when they compre-hend it, they can do anything their heart desires. When Abraham under-stood it, he acquired great wisdom and apprehended the entire Torah.Rabba also wanted to comprehend it on his own and Rabbi Ze’ira saidto him: behold it is written, “A sword is upon the boasters, and theyshall become fools”—a sword upon the enemies of the scholars, who sitand study the Torah alone. If so, let us go and study Sefer Yetzira. Theysat together and studied it for three years and understood it, and theycreated a calf and slaughtered it, and feasted with it at the termination ofa tractate. And when they slaughtered the calf, they forgot it all. They sattogether for an additional three years and recovered their knowledge.11This passage is of great importance for understanding the history ofthe magical use of Sefer Yetzira.12In addition, it raises an interestingquestion relating to esoteric teaching. As Yehuda Liebes has noted,13thispassage teaches us that the Scriptures on creation may only be studied bya certain minimum number of people, because of the presumptuousnessand the dangers of solitary study.14As I make clear below, the realm ofmagic is esoteric because of the danger of transmitting creative powers tothose unworthy of them. Consequently, there are severe restrictions on itsteaching, which restrict the number of learners in order to prevent uncon-trolled dissemination of magical knowledge. This passage teaches us,however, that overly strict esotericism can achieve the opposite result.Solitary study carries with it risks no less severe than irresponsible dis-semination of esoteric ideas. In both cases, there is no control over thelearning process. The double reading of the Mishna, as a rule regulatingeither minimal or maximal requirements, exposes the tension that wemay designate as the esoteric paradox, a tension that will surface repeat-edly in the history of esotericism. The justification for esotericism reflectsan attempt to preserve particular knowledge in a state of purity, withoutfault or distortion, as a protected, well-guarded realm. Because, however,the esoteric realm is a closed one, it cannot be effectively controlled. Anesotericist may claim that a new body of knowledge is actually the trans-mission of an ur-ancient esoteric Jewish tradition. In response to thosewho dispute him, claiming that they had never heard of such a teachingin Jewish tradition, he will claim: “This knowledge was kept secret; con-sequently, it left no trace in the traditions known to you.” Thus the mostguarded realm is also the least restricted. This paradox leaves its surpris-ing marks at the stage at which the esoteric idea reaches its peak of devel-opment—in the Jewish works of the Middle Ages.12•Chapter One"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2The Hidden and the Sublime: Vision and Restriction in the Bible and in Talmudic LiteratureThe mishna inHagiga that we have studied does not tell us why there isa need to restrict the number of students. With respect to the restrictionson exegesis of matters of incest, many suggestions have been raised andthe issue is still a mystery. The restriction on the study of the chariot is ex-plained by the Jerusalem Talmud as follows: “ ‘Nor the chariot beforeone alone’—is this also according to Rabbi Akiba? It is the opinion of all.So that one will know how to render proper respect to the honor of hisCreator” (JT Hagiga 2:1, 77a). Public exposition of the passages dealingwith the chariot constitute a violation of the honor of God, and, as such,according to the Jerusalem Talmud, it is forbidden even in the opinion ofRabbi Ishmael, who permits public exposition of the passages on the workof creation and incest. This explanation, which links secrecy to honor,has a basis in tannaitic literature. Rabbi Yohanan ben Zakkai praises hisstudent Rabbi Elazar ben Arakh for proper exegesis of the work of thechariot: “He stood up and kissed him upon his head, and said, blessed bethe Lord, God of Israel, who granted to our father Abraham a son whoknows how to understand and expound on the honor of his father inheaven” (Tosefta Hagiga 2:1, p. 380). It is possible to explain the offenseto the honor of God as a result of a metaphysical error which may becommitted by those who are unworthy. Since the interpretation of thechariot vision deals with speculation on the essence of God, distortionsand errors in these matters by such people are an offense to His honor.This explanation was popular in the Middle Ages, and this motive is ap-parently present in talmudic literature on the exegesis of the work of cre-ation and the work of the chariot, especially in sources that link the investigation of certain questions with Gnostic matters.1I would like tofocus on another, more direct explanation, linked to the particular natureof the vision of the chariot in talmudic sources.Exposition of the chariot includes an attempt at visual representationof God and His chariot throne, through explanation of the chariot visionin Ezekiel, a vision with explicit plastic properties. The state of con-sciousness of one who exposits the chariot, who deals with an internal"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"visual image, is explained in the Tosefta: “A blind person may say theblessings before and after the Shemaand may serve as translator. RabbiYehuda said, ‘Whoever has never seen the lights of the firmament in hislifetime, should not recite the blessings before and after the Shema.’ Theysaid to him: ‘Many have expounded the chariot, though they have neverseen it’ ” (Tosefta Megilla 3:28). In their reply to Rabbi Yehuda, the Sagessay: just as one who interprets the chariot can provide himself with an in-ternal image of the chariot, even though he never saw it, so too the blindman with respect to the lights of the firmament.2Furthermore, we find intalmudic literature descriptions of direct visions of God and His chariotthrone that are not restricted to the internal image of the mind’s eye, asSaul Lieberman has described.3The fear of violating the honor of God islinked to internal or actual vision that arises from examination of the details of the chariot and the God who rides upon it. Such observation results in violation and offense to the honor of God if done in a disre-spectful manner or by one who is unworthy. The core of the requirementof esotericism in dealing with the chariot vision is not the fear of error,but reticence toward the exposure inherent in the visual image. Seeing isa kind of intimacy restricted to the elect few who know how to peek witha cautious, fleeting glance.The image of “visual trespass” linked to the chariot appears in thestory of entering pardes. This story, in its many details, has engenderedmountains of commentary, and I have no desire to add my own explana-tion to the ever-growing collection of interpretations. I will focus on thelink between esotericism and looking, by examining the verbs dealingwith vision in the passage and in related sources: “Four entered the gar-den (pardes): Ben Azzai, Ben Zoma, the Other, and Akiba. One peekedand perished, one peeked and was smitten, one peeked and cut downsprouts, and one ascended in peace and descended in peace” (ToseftaHagiga 2:3; p. 381). Peeking is a fleeting and modest look, which is thegoal of those entering pardes, even if it involves substantial risk. Noteveryone is worthy of a peek at the face of the King, and certainly not ofseeing Him.4The parallel passage in the Tosefta brings a parable from therealm of the ethics of vision: “Rabbi Akiba ascended in peace and de-scended in peace. About him, the Scripture says, ‘Draw me after you, letus make haste (the king has brought me into his chambers).’ To whatshould we compare this? To a royal garden with an upper room builtover it. What is the (guard’s) duty? To look, but not feast his eyes uponit” (Tosefta Hagiga 2:5; p. 381). The lingering of the gaze to the point ofpleasure and satiation is opposed to the glance, and is a desecration andviolation of the holy.We could dismiss the focus on the various forms of looking as merelyan overly literal reading of a metaphor, for we are dealing here, after all,14•Chapter Two"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"with a parable.5In talmudic literature, however, we find the expressionhazanat ha’ayin—the nourishment of the eye—in the exposition of a di-rect experience of the vision of God. This exegesis deals with the visionof God by the elders of Israel at Mount Sinai:“And Moses and Aaron and Nadav and Abihu and seventy of the eld-ers of Israel went up. And they saw the God of Israel and under his feetwas like a paved work of sapphire stone and like the very heaven forclearness. And upon the nobles of the children of Israel He laid not Hishand, and they beheld God and did eat and drink” (Exodus 24:9–11).From this, said R. Pinhas, it may be inferred that they deserved to havea hand laid upon them. For R. Hoshaya said: Did provisions go upwith them to Sinai, that you should be able to say “and they beheldGod and did eat and drink” (Exodus 24:10)? No, but it teaches youthat they fed their eyes upon the Shekhinaas a man looks upon hisneighbor while in the act of eating and drinking. R. Yohanan says:They derived actual nourishment; as is proved by the citation, “In lightof the king’s countenance is life” (Proverbs 16:15). The text, said R. Tanhuma, teaches us that they uncovered their heads, became pre-sumptuous and fed their eyes on the Shekhina. R. Yehoshua of Sikhninin the name of R. Levi observed: Moses did not feed his eyes on theShekhinaand derived benefit from the Shekhina. He did not feed his eyesupon the Shekhina, as it says, “And Moses hid his face” (Exodus 3:6).And he derived benefit from the Shekhina, as it says, “Moses knew notthat the skin of his face sent forth beams” (Exodus 34:29). As a rewardfor “And Moses hid his face” he attained to the privilege of “And theLord spoke unto Moses face to face” (Exodus 33:11). As a reward for“He was afraid” (Exodus 3:6) he attained to the privilege of “Theywere afraid to approach him” (Exodus 34:30). As a reward for “afraidto look” (Exodus 34:30) he attained to the privilege of “and the simil-itude of the Lord he beholds” (Numbers 12:8). Nadav and Abihu,however, fed their eyes on the Shekhinaand did not derive benefit fromtheShekhina, as may be inferred from the following: “And Nadav andAbihu died before the Lord” (Leviticus 3:4). (Leviticus Rabbah 20:10,pp. 465–467; Midrash Rabbah4:261–262)The elders of Israel ascended Mount Sinai in peace and descended in peace, but deserved to die for having nourished their eyes. Indeed,Nadav and Abihu were punished for that reason. A presumptuous andpleasurable look, to the point of satiating the eye, is a terrible sin and aviolation of the honor of God. The expressions hetzitz(peeked) and hezinet ‘enav(nourished his eyes) are not metaphors but verbs of actual vision,which designate the poles of looking—from the modest peek to the vora-cious gaze.6The Hidden and the Sublime•15"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Esotericism thus depends on the relation between honor and conceal-ment, rather than on the relation between dissemination and error, as ismentioned in the famous passage cited in the Jerusalem Talmud as justi-fication for esotericism: “It is the glory of God to conceal a thing.”7Thelink between esotericism and God’s glory is also conveyed by an addi-tional midrash on the secrets of the Torah, whose content is linked not tovision, but to public dissemination:R. Huna quoted in Bar Kappara’s name (an exegesis of Psalms 31:19):“Let the lying lips be dumb”: this means, let them be bound, madedumb, and silenced. . . . “Which speak arrogantly (‘atak) against therighteous,” meaning, against the Righteous One, who is the Life of allworlds, on matters which he has withheld (he’etik) from His creatures.“With pride”—in order to boast and say, “I discourse on the creationnarrative!” (ma’asei Bereishit). “And contempt”: to think that he dis-graces My Honor! For R. Yosi beRabbi Hanina said: Whoever elevateshimself at the cost of his fellow man’s degradation has no share in theWorld to Come. How much more then [when it is done at the expenseof] the honor of God! . . . In human practice, when an earthly monarchbuilds a palace on a site of sewers, dunghills, and garbage, if one says,“This palace is built on a site of sewers, dunghills and garbage,” doeshe not discredit it? Thus, whoever comes to say that this world wascreated out of tohuandbohuand darkness, does he not impair [God’shonor]? R. Huna said in Bar Kappara’s name: If the matter were notwritten, it would be impossible to say it: “God created Heaven andearth”; out of what? Out of “now the earth was tohuandbohu”(Genesis 1:2). (Bereshit Rabbah 1:1, pp. 2–3 [trans. modified])One who expounds the creation narrative in public does not causeerror or heresy; rather, he reveals things that the Holy One, blessed beHe, has hidden because of their defects, such as the creation of the worldfromtohuandbohu. The King has indeed built His palace upon the sew-ers and garbage, but this matter should not be made public.8The first motive of esotericism is thus related to the relationship be-tween concealment and honor, and, in the case of the restrictions onviewing the chariot—the ethics of vision.Asymmetry in the possibilitiesof vision give rise to a relation of authority and sublimity. The more pow-erful partner may survey the one standing opposite him from head to toe,whereas the weaker one averts his glance, hesitating to create eye contact.The more a person may see others, without being seen by them, the furtherhis status is elevated; the inverse is also true. Social status is expressedthrough varying degrees of privacy, for example, through the expanse ofspace surrounding a person, in which access to others is restricted. A per-son’s status rises in direct proportion to the size of the personal space 16•Chapter Two"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"allotted him. This conception, which links secrecy with sublimity, foundits most radical political expression in the Persian kings’ custom of cov-ering their faces, even in their portraits on coins. This is the basic biblicalintuition behind the distinction between hearing God and seeing Him.God’s invisibility from human eyes does not derive from His essentialformlessness, but rather results from the fact that the exposure of God’sform to the human eye blemishes his sublimity. The tension betweennearness and distance, which typifies the Scriptural personality of God, isexpressed through the possibility of speech and description of God, on the one hand, combined with the restriction on seeing, sculpting, ordrawing Him on the other. This primary motive of concealment places asevere limitation on the attempt to bridge the fundamental biblical gapbetween the heard deity and the visible deity. The esoteric is not a bodyof knowledge that may not be diffused. It is, first and foremost, the cre-ation of a realm that no eye may behold, neither in actuality nor in itsimagination. It is the hidden realm in the most literal sense of the word.The Hidden and the Sublime•17"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 3The Ethics of Gazing: The Attitude of Early JewishMysticism Toward Seeing the ChariotThe relation thatwe find in talmudic literature between the vision ofthe deity and the restriction of looking at Him is linked to the nature ofearly Jewish mysticism in general. It is reflected in the Hekhalot litera-ture, whose epitome is the crossing of the border of heaven and the visionof God in all his beauty and splendor. We do not know the identity of thecircles in which this early level of Jewish mysticism originated; the dateand place of composition, as well as the degree of unity of the works ofHekhalot literature, are also disputed among scholars. It seems clear thatthis mystical literature is connected to the broader phenomenon of Gnos-ticism, and it might represent a particular strand of Jewish Gnosticism.1Some date these writings as early as the second or third centuries C.E.,whereas others place them as late as the seventh or eighth centuries. Theaffinity of the Hekhalot literature to the world of the talmudic Sages isalso a matter of dispute.2In spite of these substantial problems, we maydiscern a link and a tension between talmudic literature and the Hekhalotliterature, with respect to esotericism and its nature. We will now turn toHekhalot literature, where scholarly research has identified two distinctloci of activity, each with its own logic of esotericism.3The first locus is the mysticism of ascending and vision. One who ascends to the chariot embarks on a dangerous voyage in the upperHekhalot (palaces). On his way, he encounters angels who guard each ofthe gates of the Hekhalot; if he is deemed worthy and passes these fear-some guards, he arrives at the peak of his journey—the seventh hekhal,where he views the Throne of Glory and the Lord enthroned upon it. The voyage is accompanied by descriptions of divine sublimity, of the immense, terrifying dimensions of the angels, the seraphs and the holybeasts who stand before the Lord to serve Him, and especially the songsand praises to the high and mighty God. This focus of the Hekhalot liter-ature is the most impressive source of descriptions of divine sublimityand hymns of angels glorifying God and His chariot to be found in all ofJewish literature.The second focus of Hekhalot literature deals with the names of Godrather than His image. The heroes of this literature are Rabbi Akiba,Rabbi Ishmael, and Rabbi Nehunya ben Hakanah. They obtain knowledge"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"of the names of God that bear His essence and strength, and throughwhich they can perform magical actions, especially in the area of attain-ment of Torah insights. In the compositions of the Hekhalot literature inwhich this motive is prominent, as in Hekhalot Zutarti, and in the pas-sage entitled Sar HatorahinHekhalot Rabbati, we find a list of thenames of God and His angels, whose use enables almost unlimited actionin the world. The question of the relation between these two foci ofHekhalot literature, the mystic and the magic, both as concerns the tex-tual redaction of the works of Hekhalot literature, whether it be theirdate of composition or their significance within the overall corpus ofHekhalot literature, is a matter of dispute among scholars. The two fociare, however, intertwined on many levels. Part of the technique for as-cending to the seventh hekhal requires a certain magical knowledge.Those who descend to the chariot pass the gates of each hekhal by utter-ing the proper formula at the appropriate place and after showing theguard seals with names—a kind of laissez-passer to the interior of thehekhal. In addition, an important part of the viewing of God’s image, es-pecially in the Shi’ur Komahliterature, is the vision of the names writtenon the various parts of God’s body; sometimes the revealed nature ofGod consists of names alone. These names, which designate the essenceof God and His bodily parts, are powerful magical tools.4Mystical ascen-sion and magic are inextricably bound up with each other. Whatever therelationship between these two foci in Hekhalot literature, each reflects adifferent logic of esotericism, as we will proceed to demonstrate.Let us begin with the ethics of vision. In the mystical approach of theHekhalot literature, the impulse to see God is dominant.5The goal of theperilous heavenly journey is the view of God. Thus, the Hekhalot litera-ture fixes as its peak religious goal the crossing of the boundary betweenthe heard and the seen divinity. In one of the tendencies in biblical tradi-tion, all vision of God is completely obscured. This approach places thisboundary as the outer limitbetween humans and God, and, consequently,prohibits the making of sculptures and images. God preserves His sub-limity and separateness, not because He has no image, but because it hasnever been seen. The realm of contact between humans and God is hear-ing rather than vision. Moses, who yearns to see the Glory of God, istold, “For no man may see Me and live” (Exodus 33:20). The cost of vision is life itself. The esoteric, in this sense, is reflected not only throughthe precise characteristics of God’s nature, but also through piercing thefearsome veils in order to arrive at the experience of the vision of the hid-den God. The desire for vision dominates the Hekhalot literature, whichis interested in making the speaking and heard God into the visible andviewed one. If our claim is correct, that in their writings, restricting theexpounding of the chariot and guarding God’s honor, the talmudic SagesThe Ethics of Gazing•19"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"understood esotericism as the placement of limitations on the encounterwith God and His visible image, then the Hekhalot literature constantlyseeks to test and perhaps even contest the limits set by talmudic litera-ture. The desire to see and view dominated the religious imagination andtraversed the restrictions that limited peeking to the one who under-stands of his own knowledge.Nonetheless, Hekhalot literature established severe restrictions on whowas worthy of ascending to the chariot. The restrictions demand, firstand foremost, strict observance of the requirements of institutional re-vealed religion:To what can we compare this measurement? To a person who has aladder in his house. To anyone who descends to the chariot, who isclean and free of idolatry and incest and bloodshed and evil talk andfalse oaths and rudeness and gratuitous hatred and observes all positiveand negative commandments. Rabbi Ishmael said in the name of RabbiNehunya: “Son of haughty ones! Blessed be he and blessed be the soul ofone who is clean and free of these eight measures, for ShTWTRKhY’L,God, and SWRYA, His privy servant detest them. He descends and seesthe amazing pride and the extraordinary majesty, the pride of theheights and the majesty of grandeur.” (Schäfer, sec. 199, p. 86)At the entrance to the sixth hekhal, the guardian warns the one whodescends to the chariot:And Dumiel would say to him: “I attest and warn you about two thingsthat are before you. Whoever descends to the chariot only descendsthere if he possesses the following two attributes: he has read the Torah,the Prophets, and the Writings, has learned Mishna, midrash, halakhotand aggadot, and has understood the meaning of the positive and neg-ative laws. He has fulfilled all that is written in the Torah, and has keptall the warnings of the laws and ordinances and judgments which weretransmitted to Moses on Mount Sinai.” (Schäfer, sec. 234, p. 102)The requirement to fulfill perfectly the standards of the revealed reli-gion, as a preliminary condition for entering the concealed, esotericrealm, may be well understood against the background of the deviance ofthis action from the values of the revealed tradition. Similarly, in theirown consciousness, the esotericists see themselves as a select group,whose traits and authority far surpass that of the institutional religiouscharisma. The self-consciousness of the descenders to the chariot is de-scribed in the opening passage of Hekhalot Rabbati:His exceeding greatness is in that he sees all the deeds of mankind thatthey do even in their innermost chambers, whether they be worthy or20•Chapter Three"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"dishonorable deeds. If a man fornicates, he knows it and discerns it. Ifa man kills another, he knows it and discerns it. If a man is suspectedof having sexual relations with a menstruating woman, he knows itand discerns it. His exceeding greatness is in that he knows and dis-cerns all those who know sorcery. His exceeding greatness is in thatanyone who raises a hand against him is clothed with leprosy and be-decked with macula. His exceeding greatness is in that anyone whospeaks evil of him, he is cast down and afflicted with all types ofwounds, injuries, and running sores from which pustulent boils de-velop. His exceeding greatness is in that he stands apart from all men,and because of all his attributes, he is feared and respected by all, highand low. And to all who cause him to stumble, great, evil, difficult af-flictions are cast upon him from heaven, and to all who stretch outtheir hand toward him to do evil, the heavenly court of justice takeshold of him and annihilates him from the world.. . . His exceedinggreatness is in that all who treat him rudely, the light of their eyes isdimmed. His exceeding greatness is in that all who mock him, leave be-hind neither root nor branch, and have no descendants. (Schäfer, secs.83–91, pp. 40–44).Those who descend to the chariot are a distinct sect, who, after fulfill-ing all the requirements of institutional religion, have acquired titles,powers, and attributes, which distinguish them from the routine author-ity of the Sages.Beyond the preliminary conditions for entering the sect, the esotericcomponent is strengthened through the oft-repeated description of theterrifying perils that await those who ascend before the proper time aswell as the dangers linked to the vision of the face of God:A measure of bravery, a measure of holiness, a measure of terror andpanic. A measure of trembling. A measure of sweat. A measure of trep-idation. A measure of division. Of ZHRRY’L YHW-H of Hosts God ofIsrael, who is crowned and comes to His holy throne and (the crown)is everywhere engraved inside and out with the name YHW-H YHW-H, and the eyes of all creatures cannot look upon Him, neither the eyesof flesh and blood, nor the eyes of His servants. And one who looksupon Him or peeks at Him and sees, visions take hold of him and (aretransmitted) to the pupils of his eyes, and the pupils of his eyes emittorches of flame and they scorch him and burn him up. (Schäfer, sec.102, p. 48)The passage continues:Whoever looks upon Him, is immediately torn to bits, and whoeverpeeks at His beauty is poured out like a jug. Those who serve Him today,The Ethics of Gazing•21"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"shall not serve Him tomorrow. Those who serve Him tomorrow shallnot serve Him again, for their strength is exhausted and their faces havedarkened, their hearts go astray, their eyes grow dim from the majestyof the splendor of the beauty of their King. (Schäfer, sec. 159, p. 70).These sections, which are but a few of many, strengthen the barriers im-peding the vision of God. The angels, seraphs, and holy creatures, whichare close to God and bear His throne, are not permitted to see Him. Godis surrounded by an immense and fearsome bureaucracy, who are at Hisservice, even though they never see His face:Immediately, they all stand in fear and trepidation and trembling, inholiness and truth and humility, and they cover their faces with theirwings so that they do not discern the image of God who dwells in thechariot. (Schäfer, sec. 183, p. 80)6This conception meshes well with the sublime nature of God the King as it is formulated in the Hekhalot literature. More than in any other literature, the God of the chariot lacks any dimension of immanence, andthe fearsome sense of sublimity accompanies each and every line of thisliterature.The nature of Hekhalot literature cannot, however, be entirely sub-sumed under its esoteric dimension. Paradoxically, the very corpus whichextols the infinite majesty of God contests the absoluteness of the limitsof the esoteric, as fixed by the talmudic literature. After Rabbi Nehunyaben Hakanah specifies the attributes that prepare a person to descend tothe chariot, Rabbi Ishmael complains to him:Rabbi Ishmael said: “When my ears hear this warning, my strengthfails.” I said to him: “Rabbi, if so, there is no end to it, for you cannotfind any person whose soul dwells within him, who is clean and free ofthese eight measures.” He answered me: “Son of the haughty, if that bethe case, stand up and bring before me all the mighty ones of the circleand all the great ones of the academy, and I will speak before them the secrets and concealed and hidden things.” . . . Rabbi Ishmael said:“Immediately, I arose and gathered all the scholars of the Great andSmall Sanhedrins to the third entrance of the House of God.. . . Therecame Rabbi Shimon ben Gamliel, Rabbi Eliezer Hagadol, Rabbi Elazarben Dama, Rabbi Eliezer ben Shamua, Yohanan ben Dahavai, Hananyaben Hakhinai, Yonatan ben Uzi’el, Rabbi Akiba ben Yosef, and RabbiYehuda ben Bava. We all came and sat before him, and many studentsstood on their feet.. . . Rabbi Nehunya ben Hakanah sat and set outbefore them all the things that deal with the chariot, the descent to itand the ascent from it, how the descender descends and how the ascen-der ascends” (Schäfer, secs. 201–203, pp. 86, 88).22•Chapter Three"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"The description of the Sages and the multitude of scholars who assem-ble to hear in public the secrets of the chariot from Rabbi Nehunya com-pletely shatters the limits of esotericism as set in talmudic literature.Rabbi Nehunya ben Hakanah, faced with a lack of adept people, in-creases their number through widespread dissemination of the techniqueof ascending and descending, to enable protection from the dangersawaiting those who are not entirely worthy. Thus the Hekhalot literaturebecomes a kind of mystical guide even for those who are not exceptionaland who are not sages who understand of their own knowledge.Hekhalot Rabbatisupports the contestation of the esoteric limits witha daring theological idea, which may well be the most astonishing andunique idea in this entire literature. In addition to the desire of the mys-tic to cross over into the realm of the hidden and see God, there is the de-sire of God to be seen:All those who descended to the chariot ascended unharmed. Theywould see the entire portion and descend in peace and return and standand testify and tell of the fearsome and terrifying vision, somethingthat does not exist in any palace of kings of flesh and blood. Theybless, praise, laud, adorn, extol, glorify and give honor, glory, andgreatness to TWTRWSY’Y, God the Lord of Israel, who rejoices inthose who descend to the chariot, and He would sit and await each andevery person in Israel, when shall he descend in awesome glory and exceptional majesty, in the glory of the exalted and the majesty ofgrandeur. (Schäfer, sec. 216, p. 92)The sublime God sits and awaits those who descend to the chariot; notonly the select few, but each and every one of Israel. The longing of Godto make Himself seen appears in other sources as well:TWTRWSY’Y, God, the Lord of Israel desires and waits in the measurethat He awaits the redemption and the time of salvation which is pre-pared for Israel for the day of vengeance after the destruction of the lastTemple: when will the descender descend to the chariot, when shall hesee the pride of the heavens, when shall he hear of the end-time of salva-tion,when shall he see what no eye has seen, when shall he ascend andspeak of it to the seed of Abraham, my beloved? (Schäfer, sec. 218, p. 94).Furthermore, God adjures those who descend to the chariot to publi-cize what they have seen:The punishment of heaven is upon them (=you) descenders to the chariot, if you do not remember and tell what you have heard, and ifyou do not testify to what you have seen before the face of exaltationand might and pride and grandeur.

Teach them, that I have no pleasure in all the world I have created,except for that hour when your eyes are raised to Mine, and my eyelooks into your eyes at the time when you say “Holy” before Me.(Schäfer, secs. 163–164, p. 72)The God of the Bible longs to escape His sublime loneliness and beheard. But the distance between Him and mankind is zealously guardedin the Bible, so that He is rarely seen, though He may be heard. It is onlyin the Hekhalot literature, which created the most intense image of sub-limity, that God’s desire to be seen is expressed in a unique manner. Thisliterature, which is interested in eliminating the distance created by thedistinction between hearing and vision, adds to the human motivation topeek at the mysteries, the desire of God to be revealed and be seen. TheHoly One, blessed be He, has, so to speak, a “sight deficiency,” and his de-sire for contact with mankind pushes Him to a contact more all-embracingthan speech. God wishes to be liberated from His invisibility, and he sitsand awaits the time when each and every one of Israel will see Him.The most fascinating text on the new relation to vision in the Hekhalotcircles appears in another midrash, Midrash Mishlei, which manifests in-fluences of Hekhalot literature. This passage is an expansion of the talmu-dic saying that in the heavenly court, a person is asked if he studied Torah:One who possesses Talmud learning comes, and they ask him: “Sinceyou occupied yourself with Talmud study, did you see the chariot, didyou see the glory?” For there is no pleasure in My world other than thehour when the learned Sages sit and study Torah, and they peek andlook and glance and meditate much over this teaching: how does Mythrone of glory stand? . . . How does the hashmal stand....Greatestof all, how am I from my toenails to the top of my head. What is thedimension of my palm, and how large are my toes?...This is mygreatness, this is the majesty of my beauty, that my children discern myglory by this measure. (Midrash Mishlei, pp. 66–67)724•Chapter Three"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"The Holy One, blessed be He, has pleasure in His world only when Heis seen, and not with a fleeting glance. The midrash increases the experienceof vision through a series of verbs of seeing that steadily widen in scopeand duration: “They peek and look and glance.” Beyond the desire to beseen and the satisfaction that results from it, this passage clearly expressesthe reversal of values—from respect and concealment to vision and great-ness. The esotericism of vision claims that the glory of God is his invisi-bility, whereas the midrash proclaims: “This is My greatness, this is themajesty of My beauty, that My children discern my glory by this measure.”We should mention that in this matter, God and the angels have conflict-ing interests. God is trapped in the fearsome bureaucracy of angels whoguard his distance from mankind. The angels do not see God Himself andrefuse to permit this to their human competitors. They zealously guard thedistance of the King, even if He Himself wants His admirers to see Him:For the guardians of the gateway to the sixth hekhal would destroythose who descended to the chariot; not [only] those who descended tothe chariot without permission. They would command them harshlyand beat them and burn them, and put others in their place. And eventhe other (guardians) who remained in their places would act in thesame way. They do not fear and dare to say, why are we burning?What pleasure do we have from destroying those who descend to thechariot, other than those who descend to the chariot without permis-sion? Nevertheless, such is the behavior of the guardians of the gate-way to the sixth hekhal. (Schäfer, sec. 224, pp. 96–98)In their extreme care for the glory of God, and in their jealousy towardmen who might succeed in seeing Him, the guardians of the hekhal injureeven those descenders to the chariot who are worthy of God’s proximity,although they may be punished for this act. Rabbi Akiba describes theHoly One, blessed be He, as the one who saved him from the angels whowished to prevent him from seeing the chariot: “Rabbi Akiba said: ‘WhenI ascended to the heavens, I gave more signs at the entrance of the rakiathan at the entrance to my own house. And when I reached the veil, theangels of destruction came out to destroy me. The Holy One, blessed beHe, said unto them: “Let this elder be, for he is worthy to look upon Myglory’ ” (Schäfer, sec. 673, p. 248).8Those who descend to the chariot attain a degree of intimacy that even God’s close servants cannot attain. InPirkei deRabbi Eliezer, a composition that displays influences of Hekhalotliterature, this tension is described as a violent altercation between theangels and Moses that took place when Moses requested to see God:The ministering angels said to the Holy One, blessed be He, behold, weserve before you day and night and we may not see your glory; yet thisThe Ethics of Gazing•25"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"creature, born of a woman, wishes to see your glory?! And they stoodin anger and panic, ready to kill him, and his soul reached the point ofdeath. What did the Holy One, blessed be He, do? He revealed Him-self to him in a cloud, as it is written, “And God came down in thecloud”. . . and the Holy One, blessed be He, covered him with Hispalm so that he not die, as it is written, “and when my glory passes, I shall place you in the cleft of the rock and cover you with my hand.”(Pirkei deRabbi Eliezer, chap. 46)This gap between those who descend to the chariot and the angels is revealed at the peak of the mystical voyage, when God appears in his full beauty before the mystic: “and the holy beasts cover their faces, andthe cherubim and wheels turn their faces away, and he enters and standsbefore the throne of His Glory” (Schäfer, sec. 250, p. 110).The literature of the most pronounced sublimity and loftiness in all ofJewish tradition created the idea of the traversing of the final barrier ofintimacy of vision. This is remarkable, even if it does possess its own in-terior logic. This literature formulated its concept of vision, not only asthe aim of a selected religious elite, but also as the desire of God to beseen; thus, the clear limits of the esoteric, which it established for itself,were traversed time and time again. According to this tendency in theHekhalot literature, the guarding of the honor of God, which is ex-pressed in talmudic literature through the restriction of vision, enshrinesa distance that God wishes to annul. This is esoteric literature, and yet itseeks to contest the mystery that it posited. As if the idea of the sublimeleads to its own dissolution by imposing on God an isolation and solitudethat in turn gives rise to His urge to be seen. It is of no wonder, then, thatin the heart of the most sublime literature, the deep hunger for intimacyemerges.The ambivalence of Hekhalot literature toward the limits of the eso-teric is clearly expressed in the opening portion to the work HekhalotZutarti:If you wish to distinguish yourself in the world, so that the secret of the world and the hidden wisdom will be revealed to you, learn thisMishna, and be careful with it until the day of your departure. Do nottry to understand what is behind you, and do not research the wordsof your lips. Understand what is in your heart and be silent, so that youbecome worthy of the beauty of the chariot. Take heed of the glory of your Creator, do not go down toward Him, and if you go down toward Him, do not take pleasure from Him. And if you did takepleasure, you will be driven out of the world. “It is the glory of God toconceal a thing,” so that you not be driven from the world. (Schäfer,sec. 335, p. 142)26•Chapter Three"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"This passage is an adaptation of the warnings on esotericism mentionedin the Talmud. The warning “Take heed of the honor of your Creator” is,of course, the text of the Mishna (Hagiga 2:1). The restriction “Do notseek to understand what is behind you” is a repetition of the prohibitionto look “at what is before you and what is behind you,” which is in thesame Mishna. The command “Understand what is in your heart and besilent” is, in fact, a reconstruction of the saying in the Jerusalem Talmud,“If [you are investigating what happened] before the world was created,learn and contemplate it in your heart. If [you study what happened]after the world was created, you may go and your voice may resoundfrom one end of the world to the other” (Hagiga 2:1, 77c). The sequenceof warnings, “Do not go down toward Him, and if you go down towardHim, do not take pleasure from Him. And if you did take pleasure, youwill be driven out of the world,” is related to the eye’s nourishment fromtheShekhina. It reminds us of the sequence found in a parable in Avot de-Rabbi Natan, “He [Ben Zoma] would say: ‘Do not peek into a man’svineyard, and if you peeked, do not go down into it; and if you wentdown into it, do not look; and if you looked, do not touch; and if youtouched, do not eat; and if a man eat from it, he will have destroyed his soul both from the life of this world and from that of the World toCome.”9This redaction of the classic collection of warnings from talmudic liter-ature, as they appear in Hekhalot Zutarti, is preceded by a sentencewhich alters the tenor of the esoteric approach: “If you wish to distin-guish yourself in the world, so that the secret of the world and the hiddenwisdom will be revealed to you, learn this Mishna.” This formula intro-duces other texts in Hekhalot literature as well, and determines that allpersons in Israel should repeat this Mishna until it becomes a daily litur-gical reading.10This esoteric Mishna is not destined for those individualswho understand of their own knowledge. The opposite is the case—it isthe constant repetition of this Mishna which transforms the reader intoan exceptional individual.The Ethics of Gazing•27"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4Concealment and Power: Magic and Esotericism in the Hekhalot LiteratureIn the hekhalot literature, as we mentioned earlier, there is one focusthat deals not with the image of God, but with His names; this theme hasits own esoteric logic. The esotericist transmits the names designating theessence of God and His powers. Through the proper enunciation or writingof these names, one may activate the creative power of the godhead or of theangels. These names were transmitted to Rabbi Akiba: “This is the namethat was revealed unto Rabbi Akiba, as he was gazing at the vision of thechariot, and Rabbi Akiba descended and taught it to his disciples. He saidto them, ‘My sons, take heed of this name, for it is a great name, a holyname, a pure name, and all who employ it with awe, with fear, with purity,with holiness and with humility, his seed will be multiplied and he shallsucceed in all his ways’ ” (Schäfer, sec. 337, p. 144). The dissemination of thismagical knowledge is accompanied by severe warnings of esotericism:Rabbi Akiba said: “Anyone who wishes to learn this Mishna, and toexpound the Name as it is, should sit and fast for forty days, and placehis head between his knees until the fast dominates him, and whisperto the earth and not to the heavens, that the earth may hear and not theheavens. . . and if he tell it to his fellow, he should tell him one letter ofthe first name and one letter of the last name, and not pair the two [letters],lest he err and destroy the world, the world of the Holy One, blessedbe He. And if he wish to test him, he should test him but once, and nottwice, and be scrupulous when he tests him, so that he not err and destroythe world of the Holy One, blessed be He” (Schäfer, sec. 424, p. 180).Later in the text, we find a severe warning against the dissemination ofsuch knowledge: “Rabbi Ishmael said, SWRYA, the privy servant spoketo me saying that I had revealed all to you, and anyone who reveals thisto one who is unworthy, is banished from this world and relegated to thelowest rank of Gehenna” (Schäfer, sec. 425, p. 182).Magic is a kind of power that may not be entrusted to one who is un-worthy, and as such, it is transmitted esoterically. There is a parallel pas-sage on the esotericism of magic in the Talmud:Raba bar bar Khannah said in the name of Rabbi Yohanan: “The four-letter Name, the sages confide to their students once in seven years.”"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Some say, twice in seven years. Rabbi Nahman bar Yitzhak said: “Rea-son supports the view that it was once in seven years, as it is written:‘This is my name forever’ (le’olam). It is written le’alem(to keep se-cret).” Raba intended to lecture on it in public, but a certain old mansaid to him: “It is written le’alem(to keep secret).” Rabbi Abina op-posed [two verses]: It is written “this is my name”; but it is also writ-ten, “And this is my memorial”! The Holy One, blessed be He, said: “I am not called as I am written: I am written with yod he, but I amreadalef, daled.” Our rabbis taught: “At first, the twelve-letter namewould be entrusted to all people. When unruly men increased, it wasconfided to the pious of the priesthood, and these ‘swallowed it’ dur-ing the chanting of their brother priests.” It was taught: Rabbi Tarfonsaid: “I once ascended the dais after my mother’s brother, and I in-clined my ear to the High Priest, and heard him swallowing the Nameduring the chanting of his brother priests.” Rav Yehuda said in thename of Rav: “The forty-two lettered Name is entrusted only to himwho is pious, meek, middle-aged, free from anger, sober and not insis-tent on his rights. And he who knows it is heedful thereof and observesit in purity, is beloved above and envied below, his fear lies uponmankind, and he inherits two worlds, this world and the next world”(Kiddushin 71a, pp. 361–362 [trans. modified])1Similar restrictions and warnings are frequently repeated in magical lit-erature. This esotericism is designed to establish a relation between eso-tericism and power.2These traditions of esotericism, at least in the viewof their transmitters, contain divine powers, and the gap between thepower given to man and his personal stature threatens the existence ofthe world. In the modern context, we may compare this to knowledge ofnuclear secrets. The attempt to control their dissemination, if it bears amoral meaning and not merely a political one, is linked to this fear. An in-teresting analogy between nuclear secrets and magical secrets can befound in the restriction on magical experiments, lest they go out of con-trol: “If he seeks to experiment with [the Name], he may do so once, butnot twice. And he should be very scrupulous with it when he experimentswith it, lest he err and destroy the world of the Holy One, blessed be He”(Schäfer, sec. 424, p. 180). The esotericism of power is common to talmu-dic writings and to magical literature in general. There is, however, in theHekhalot literature one composition that demonstrates a fascinating ex-ception to these esoteric conventions.This composition is part of Hekhalot Rabbati, and some scholars, whosee this section as an independent literary unit, have designated it as SarHatorah. The literary framework for this unit is the story of the buildersof the Second Temple. The builders wish to learn Torah as they toil, butConcealment and Power•29"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"request a technique that will enable them to perform their study withoutthe usual toil and effort that it normally demands. They claim that theydo not possess sufficient strength for both tasks at once. In the storehouseof the Holy One, blessed be He, there is a secret that was not revealed toMoses and has been kept for this generation, which ensures that the Tem-ple builders will be able to know the entire Torah without effort, and willeven enjoy the superior status that ensues from this knowledge:You are happy, but my servants are sad, for this secret, one of the se-crets, has departed from my storehouse. From now on the sound ofyour sitting and learning will be contented as grazing calves; you shallno longer learn by struggle and effort, but by the Name of this seal andthe mention of My crown. . . . Riches and money will come mightilyover you, the great ones of the world will cleave to you, the familiesyou marry into will be surrounded with lofty lineage on all sides, willbe blessed by you and will be exalted through you; you will be calledvindicators of the many,you will be called the benefactor of creatures,you will determine the new moons and the intercalation of the yearsfrom the shrewdness of your wisdom. (Schäfer, secs. 289–290, p. 128).The sad angels in this passage are opposed to the transfer of the seal, justas they were opposed to the giving of the Torah to Moses. The reason fortheir opposition is directly related to the relation of esotericism to status:This secret must not leave your storehouse, and the secret wisdom notleave your treasure house. Do not make flesh and blood like unto us,and do not equate us to mankind through our Torah. Let them strug-gle with the Torah in the way that they struggled throughout all thegenerations until now; let them fulfill it with great effort and muchpain. For it is your glory and it is your splendor. When they praise andpray repeatedly before you, they will call with all their hearts and en-treat you with longing souls: let what we have acquired remain withus, let what we have learned endure in our hands, let what our earshave heard abide, let our hearts retain the paths of the teaching that wehave heard from the mouths of our masters, and they will honor eachother. If this secret be revealed unto your children, they will equatelarge and small, the fool and the wise, this is the answer of His ser-vants. (Schäfer, sec. 292, pp. 128–130)This passage is fascinating because of the reversal of the esoteric struc-tures in it. The angels entreat God not to reveal the secrets of the Torah,because the Torah is to be acquired through struggle and effort. The dis-closure of the secret will blur the differences between the wise and thefool, as the seal promises total equality of knowledge: “And if you areworthy of this great seal, to utilize the fearsome crown, there shall be no30•Chapter Four"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"ignorant ones among you ever, neither will there be any fool or unwiseones among you” (Schäfer, sec. 288, pp. 126–128). The angels view thissituation, in which “the little shall be equal to the great, and the fool to thewise” as a threat to the hierarchical structure of the status of the Sages.The transfer of a means for understanding the Torah without effort willtotally undermine their status and honor. In spite of the opposition of theangels, the magical tool was placed in the hands of the Temple builders.The anonymous author of these passages describes a social utopia, inwhich an esoteric magical tool given to all eliminates the existing gaps inthe distribution of knowledge and the hierarchy that results from suchgaps. In a society in which the dominant good is the knowledge of theTorah, and social status in many realms derives from the possession ofsuch a good, the equal distribution of knowledge has radical conse-quences. The author of Sar Hatorahamplifies the revolutionary nature ofthe disclosure of the secret by describing in full, colorful detail the gloryand splendor of the scholars, which will then become the lot of all. Esotericism changes its nature completely. Under normal conditions ofesotericism, magical knowledge is the most extreme instrument of strati-fication. The status of the esotericists who know the Names is far beyondthat of the scholars who struggle in the study of Torah. The Sar Hatorahcomposition, however, eliminates the stratification whose source is re-vealed knowledge, with the aid of magical knowledge that becomes com-mon property. Although we do not know the identity of the circles thatauthored this utopian idea of the distribution of knowledge, it seems ev-ident that these circles were never assimilated into the establishment ofTorah scholars. Halperin, in his interesting analysis of this passage, sug-gested that it derives from circles of unlettered magicians.3Yosef Danidentified the source of this work among the scholars of the Land of Is-rael, who attempted to foresee the end of Babylonian hegemony.4Thegreat difference between these two identificationsdemonstrates just howlittle we know about the social context of the passage. In any case, it re-mains a fascinating, singular example of the complex relationship be-tween esotericism and status.Early sources of esotericism outline two concepts of esotericism, whichderive from disparate areas of religious activity. The first concept dwelton the link between sublimity and esotericism and tests the boundary be-tween vision and desecration. The second concept, which concerns mag-ical knowledge, sees esotericism as a kind of regulation of power. Bothconcepts of esotericism may be found in the variant manuscripts of a sin-gle talmudic text describing the attempt of the angels to harm RabbiAkiba: “And Rabbi Akiba too the ministering angels sought to thrustaway. The Holy one, blessed be He, said to them: ‘Let this elder be, for heis worthy to make use of (l’hishtamesh) my glory’ ” (Hagiga 15b). The verbConcealment and Power•31"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"l’hishtameshin this context has a clear magical significance. Thus the re-strictions determine who is worthy of magical power. Rabbenu Hananel,on the other hand, preserves a variant of this passage that reads, “Let thiselder be, for he is worthy to look upon(l’histakel) my glory.”5This read-ing deals with the restrictions on disclosure and vision and is tied to vi-sual mysticism. The alternative readings l’hishtamesh/l’histakel(to makeuse of/to look at) present the two foci of esotericism whose boundariesare tested in the Hekhalot literature.The phenomenon of the transgression of the boundaries of the esotericand the dissemination of its traditions accompanies the esoteric ideathroughout the course of its development. The very proclamation thatthere exists a realm of knowledge whose dissemination is restricted in-vites the transgression of those limits. Absolute esotericism can only beachieved, as we mentioned earlier, when no one hears of the existence ofthe secret, other than those who guard it. The concealment of esotericcontent, when not accompanied by the concealment of the very fact of itsexistence, is a breach in the armor of secrecy. The violation of the frame-work of esotericism which we exposed in our discussion of Hekhalot literature typifies a model that surfaces repeatedly in cases of the trans-gression of the esoteric code; it is linked to the consciousness of a crisis,or else of redemption. The passage describing how Rabbi Nehunya benHakanah expounded his chariot teachings before the Sages, without re-stricting it to those individuals who understand of their own knowledge,is preceded by the following description: “Rabbi Ishmael said: ‘WhenRabbi Nehunya ben Hakanah saw that evil Rome had taken counsel todestroy completely the mighty ones of Israel, he stood up and revealedthe secret of the world’ ” (Schäfer, sec. 198, p. 86). A severe historical cri-sis threatening the continued existence of the circle of esotericists led tothe decision to diffuse the secrets. In such a situation, the esotericist mustdecide between the extinction of the esoteric tradition and the certaintyof its preservation through forbidden dissemination of its contents.The consciousness of a crisis resulting from the inability to continue totransmit the esoteric tradition under its normally restrictive conditionscharacterizes various occasions of disclosure; one possible consequencemay be the committing of esoteric oral traditions to writing. Hundreds of years after the composition of the Hekhalot literature, in the early thir-teenth century, Rabbi Eleazar of Worms acted under similar perceptionsof crisis. He justified the writing down of the esoteric traditions of theHasidim of Ashkenaz, contrary to the custom of his teacher Rabbi YehudaHehasid:I was not fortunate with my only son, who received all the secrets, forhe departed this world at half the normal life-span . . . and I did not32•Chapter Four"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"merit to teach the chapters to others, for the men of deeds are no more,and the hearts have become too narrow to comprehend how the Tal-mud is derived from the Books of the Pentateuch, as I will explain indetail in the following chapters. And I shall write them down, and re-veal a drop of the sea, and write adjacent passages in brief, as one whogleans stalks. Perhaps they shall increase their learning and will under-stand from the force of their own intelligence.6The fundamental unit for the transmission of esoteric oral knowledgeis the family. According to the testimony of Rabbi Eleazar of Worms, thetermination of his family line, as a result of the early death of his son andcombined with the diminution of his students, moved him to commit thesecrets of the Torah to writing. The fear of the loss of the secret as a re-sult of the diminution of the line of transmission justified the writingdown of the secret; thus, the knowledge could be passed on without rely-ing on the continuous chain of oral transmission.7The opposite circumstance, the messianic, could also lead to the break-ing of the esoteric codes. The desire to remove the veil of secrecy at theend of days is expressed in Hekhalot literature, in the mouth of God whoawaits the coming of the age of redemption: “TWTRWS’Y, God, theLord of Israel, awaits and desires in the measure that He longs for the re-demption and the time of salvation which is prepared for Israel. . . .When shall He who descends to the Merkabah descend? When shall hesee the Glory of the Most High? When shall he hear of the end time ofsalvation? When shall the eye see what no eye has seen? When shall he as-cend and tell it to the seed of his beloved Abraham?” (Schäfer, sec. 218,p. 94). The messianic age is one of complete transparency, in which thegap between the concealed and the revealed shall disappear.8Messianicrevivals are often accompanied by the opening of the gates of secrecy. Aninteresting case of this is the messianic justification for the disseminationof the Zohar, which was raised during the dispute over its printing in thesixteenth century.9In the Hekhalot literature, we thus find a link betweenthe weakening of the limits of secrecy and the two opposing poles of his-torical consciousness—severe crisis and redemption. This relationship isa first expression of a commonly recurring theme in the history of esoteri-cism, as we shall explain further below.Concealment and Power•33"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 5Esotericism and Commentary: Ibn Ezra and the Exegetical LayerThe earliest sourcedealing with the attitude of rabbinic authorities tothe Hekhalot literature is the discussion in the tenth century between RavShrira Gaon and his son Rav Hai Gaon and the community of Fez on thenature of the composition Shi’ur Komah. Rav Shrira Gaon and Rav HaiGaon were the heads of the academy in Pumpedita in Babylonia at thetenth and the beginning of the eleventh centuries. In their capacity as theauthoritative rabbinic leaders of the era they corresponded with the vastJewish diaspora concerning legal and theological matters. In a questionaddressed to Rav Shrira and Rav Hai, the people of Fez expressed theirconfusion over the status of the work: “We need to know if Rabbi Ish-mael transmits what he heard from his teacher, and that his teacher re-ceived from his teacher, going back to the law transmitted to Moses onMount Sinai, or whether he said this of his own authority. And if it be thecase that he spoke this of his own authority, is it not written: “Whoeverdoes not take care to preserve the honor of his Maker, it were better thathe had never come into the world? May our master please clarify this mat-ter to us with perfect clarity” (Otzar Hageonim, Hagiga11). The respon-sum of the geonimis a crucial turning point in the history of esotericism:We cannot explain this matter with perfect clarity, but only along gen-eral lines. God forbid that Rabbi Ishmael say these things of his ownauthority! How could a man conceive such things of his own mind?Furthermore, our Maker is too lofty and exalted to have bodily partsand dimensions as [might be understood] from the literal understand-ing of the words, for who can be compared unto God, and what imagecan resemble Him? Yet, these are indeed words of wisdom (that con-ceal understandings greater and higher than the highest of mountains,and very wondrous indeed, and these wordsare their hints, and theirsecrets and their concealed, hidden things), which may not be transmit-ted unto every man, but only unto those who possess the proper attrib-utes that have been transmitted to us. . . . And we tell you this, for youare very dear to us, but we cannot discuss such matters in writing, andnot even orally, except to those who are worthy. (Otzar Hageonim,Hagiga, p. 12)"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Rav Shrira and Rav Hai do not deny the sacred status of the Shi’urKomah. Nevertheless, the great distance between their view and theworldview of the book gives rise to a paradoxical claim that the book isa tradition obtained by Rabbi Ishmael, rather than something transmit-ted of his own authority. They argue that the apparent, indecipherablemeaning of the book and its bizarre nature prove that Rabbi Ishmaelcould not have transmitted it of his own authority: “From whence shalla man speak of such matters on his own authority? Furthermore, ourMaker is too lofty and exalted to have bodily parts and dimensions in theliteral sense of those words.” Rav Shrira and Rav Hai reject the anthro-pomorphic religious position, and consequently attribute a secret, hiddenmeaning to the book: “Yet, these are indeed words of wisdom that con-ceal understandings greater and higher than the highest of mountains,and are very wondrous indeed, and these words are their hints, and theirsecrets and their concealed, hidden things.” According to Rav Shrira andRav Hai, the mystical vision of the dimensions (shi’ur Komah) of God,including His bodily parts and His names, is but the symbol of deepermatters, secrets which may not be revealed in public. The compositionShi’ur Komahis esoteric because on the surface level it is meaningless,but it contains a hidden layer of meaning. The responding rabbis focusedon the esoteric level of meaning, because the plain meaning of the wordsraises a severe problem of anthropomorphism. Rav Shrira and Rav Haithus transformed the Shi’ur Komah from an esoteric work into a workthat contains a layer of esoteric meaning. Through this change, they neu-tralized the anthropomorphic nature of the book. This responsum of thegeonimis the earliest example of a new idea of esoteric exegesis. The es-oteric text is no longer a text that may not be studied and disseminated,but rather a text containing an encrypted layer of meaning.The concept of the esoteric as the hidden layer of meaning of a sacredwork became a central idea in medieval Jewish thought. Rabbi AbrahamIbn Ezra, in the first half of the twelfth century, was the first medievalcommentator and thinker to make extensive use of this conception. Bornin Toledo in 1089, Ibn Ezra was one of the greatest products of Judeo-Arabic culture. He was a poet, astronomer, and physician who had animmense impact on Jewish culture, mainly through his magnificent com-mentary on the Bible. Among other achievements, by inserting into hisbiblical commentary a layer of hints relating to a concealed meaning ofthe text, he created a work that marks a turning point in the esoteric ideawithin Jewish tradition. An examination of the esoteric idea in the writ-ings of Ibn Ezra lays bare the major features that exemplify the greatblossoming of esotericism in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. A strik-ing expression of the esoteric concept that the text bears a double mean-ing may be found in Ibn Ezra’s commentary on the plural form in the Esotericism and Commentary•35"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"expression “my commandments (mitzvotai) and my teachings (torotai)”:“The reason for the plural form in mitzvotaiandtorotaiis that all thecommandments and teachings are undoubtedly true in their apparentmeaning, yet they contain secrets concerning matters of the soul, whichonly the instructed may understand; thus each commandment is double”(Exodus 16:28; Weiser 2:107). The esoteric is thus a level of meaning thattransforms the basic structure of the text to one bearing a double mean-ing. The idea of the esoteric, which accompanies substantial portions ofthe text, endows the concept of esotericism with an entirely new mean-ing. According to the previous understanding of esotericism, that of theHekhalot and tannaitic literature, the vision of the chariot which mightnot be expounded was an extremely marginal case, which remained ad-junct to the tradition and which must be approached with care. In tan-naitic and talmudic literature, the esoteric did not influence the largerstructure of the tradition, nor did it change its meaning or essential na-ture. In a striking contrast to the medieval esotericism, scriptural inter-pretations which reveal encoded meanings in the sacred text are absentfrom the Hekhalot literature. Esotericism became a hermeneutical proj-ect from the twelfth century onward and ushered in a major transforma-tion of Jewish tradition as a whole. In the Middle Ages, the esoteric realmacquired its exclusive significance, as a deep-structural layer that ran par-allel to many of the revealed portions of the canon; this layer endowed allof religious activity with a new meaning—from basic principles of faith tothe performance of the commandments. From Ibn Ezra’s day on, the eso-teric realm serves as an answer for a basic, fundamental question relatingto the wider meaning of Jewish tradition, and became a level of meaningcasting its influence over the entire surface of the religious framework.This concept, that esotericism separates the meaning of the text intoseveral levels, created an important new dimension in the esoteric idea inthe Middle Ages—the stratification of the learning public. The esotericlevels could be understood only by the instructed, while the other learnerswould have to suffice with the revealed levels of the text. The medievalesotericist is not one who knows how to expound Ezekiel or Genesis;rather, he reads the very same text in an entirely different manner thanthe other learners. The stratification of the learning public into an en-lightened community and one that is unenlightened is no less significantthan the splitting of the meaning of the text. From this point on, thelearning public is no longer seen as a single organic unit, as opposed tothe unlettered (amei ha’aretz); rather, that public is itself divided into theinstructed and the uninstructed.Ibn Ezra expresses the idea of addressing two separate publics by splitting a verse in two: “I am the Lord your God, who took you out of the land of Egypt” (Exodus 20:2): “for [Scripture] tells the instructed 36•Chapter Five"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"‘I am the Lord,’ and adds ‘who took you out,’ so that both the instructedand the uninstructed shall understand” (Exodus 20:1; Weiser 2:132). Thewords of Ibn Ezra are given as in response to the question of RabbiYehuda Halevi, who asked, “Why is it not written, ‘I am the Lord yourGod, who created the heavens and the earth’?” According to Ibn Ezra,for the instructed, the words “I am the Lord your God” suffice, for hisfaith is based on knowledge of nature and the structure of the universe:He whose heart leads him to acquire wisdom . . . will recognize theworks of God in metals and plants, in animals and in the very body ofman . . . and will raise his heart to know the matters of the celestialspheres. . . and he will know all of these with completely discernment,that knows of no doubt, and through the ways of God, the instructedshall know God. For behold, the glorious God mentions in the FirstCommandment, “I am the Lord your God.” And this can only be un-derstood by one who is exceedingly wise. (Exodus 20:1; Weiser 2:132)The historical level of religion, as expressed in the second part of theverse, is directed toward those who are uninstructed, that is, the believerwho lacks the ability to base his faith upon investigation of creation, andrequires miracles to uphold his faith. For this uninstructed reader, onemust add to the words “I am the Lord” the visible miracle: “who tookyou out of the land of Egypt.” According to the commentary of Ibn Ezra,the division of the verse indicates that the esoteric level of the text hintsat the causal and fixed aspects of the universe, as opposed to the revealedlevel, which deals with the historical miraculous dimension. This positionis a hallmark of the esoteric conception throughout the Middle Ages, aswill become clearer when the full scope of the esoteric medieval projectwill be unraveled.This passage may serve as a starting point for our investigation as towho is an instructed one, how a selected public of readers is formedwithin the larger community, and what characterizes this privileged com-munity. Ibn Ezra describes the instructed in other contexts as well: “Forif I desired to reveal this secret, I could not write it in the same manner I write throughout my commentary on this book, for he who has notlearned geometry and the secrets of astronomy will not understand” (Exodus 28:6; Weiser 2:187). In still another place, he writes: “And themen endowed with the knowledge of geometry understood these secrets”(Genesis 1:1; Weiser 1:13). The determination of who is instructed is ofcentral importance in our understanding of the role of the esoteric idea in the Middle Ages. The instructed person is acquainted with scientificdiscourse—in the case of Ibn Ezra, Greek and Arabic geometry and astrology—and through this scientific discourse he comes to understandthe secrets of the Torah.1Ibn Ezra is aware that this knowledge is not Esotericism and Commentary•37"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"derived directly from the study of the Torah, but is acquired from the surrounding culture. Indeed, the astrological hermetic picture was trans-mitted to Ibn Ezra through a long Arabic tradition. Astrological teach-ings began to enter the Islamic world in the ninth century and they lefttheir deep impression upon authors and groups such as al-Kindi and hisstudent, the greatest of Arabic astrologers, Abu Ma’shar al-Balkhi, theBrethrens of Purity, al-Biruni, and others.2Ibn Ezra expressed the exter-nal source of such knowledge in his commentary: “There are great sages,steeped in the two Torahs, who have not delved into the wisdom of nature. Thus, I cannot explain these blessings, unless I mention some of these teachings” (Exodus 23:25; Weiser 2:163).3The public that is acquainted only with the surface level of the text is not made up only ofthe unlettered. The public of listeners or readers is divided between sagesproficient in the Written and Oral Law, and those who have delved into the study of nature and other forms of wisdom. The internal stratifi-cation is determined by the differing contexts of knowledge brought tothe text by the reader and the understandings facilitated by these formsof knowledge.4The gap between the two parts of the public is formed not only as a result of the question of interpretation. According to Ibn Ezra, the com-munity of esotericists is a religious elite that realizes the supreme telos ofreligious existence. The stratification runs so deep that it creates an essen-tially separate religious elite. This is stated forcefully by Ibn Ezra in hisresponse to the question as to why the Torah does not mention the rewards of the World to Come:In my opinion, the Torah was given to all, not to one alone. Mattersconcerning the World to Come can be understood only by one in athousand, for they are deep. The reward in the World to Come dependson matters of the soul. For it is reward for the service of the heart,whose work is the contemplation of the deeds of God, for they are theladder by which one may ascend to attain the degree of the knowledgeof God, which is the essence. For the Torah also explained to the in-structed person the matter of the tree of life. For there is a power thatcan defeat the cherubim [guarding the entrance to the Garden ofEden]. For he who eats of the tree of life lives forever like the minister-ing angels, as we find in the Psalm to the sons of Korah: “Hear this allnations” (Psalms 49:2), for the secret is “for the Lord shall redeem mysoul from She’ol, for He shall take me, Selah” (49:16). Furthermore,“after honor, shall He take me” (73:24). For the verb “to take” (lekiha)is mentioned in both verses, just as it is mentioned in the cases ofEnoch and Elijah. . . and the instructed person (maskil) shall under-stand. (Deuteronomy 32:39; Weiser 3:318).38•Chapter Five"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"The instructed esotericists are those who understand what the Worldto Come is. Furthermore, they are the only ones to merit the World toCome. As Ibn Ezra says in his commentary on the verse “that a man dothem and live with them”: “To explain that they [the commandments]provide for those who observe them in both worlds. For he who under-stands their secret, the Life of the World shall sustain him so that he neverdie, as it is written, ‘I am the Lord your God,’ as I explained” (Leviticus18:4; Weiser 3:54). In a more extreme formulation, we may say that theonly ones who acquire eternal life as individuals are those who cleave toGod through their knowledge, whereas all others, excepting the instructedperson, may achieve eternal life as part of the human species, as thisspecies will never die out. The instructed person maintains an unmedi-ated, direct relationship with God as an individual, unlike other humanbeings: “Since Adam saw that he was to die, he gave birth to a son so thatthe species might be preserved; thus, he received a special status through thecollective. Consequently, Eve said: ‘For I have purchased the Lord througha man’ (Genesis 4:1). But the sons of the prophets would isolate them-selves, in the hopes that each would receive according to his own capaci-ties” (Exodus 3:15; Weiser 2:34–35). This idea appears in an extremelyabbreviated form in Ibn Ezra’s words on the promise of long life: “Forthe days shall be lengthened for all upon the earth, and for the individualin the World to Come” (Deuteronomy 6:30; Weiser 3:234).5The two lev-els of reading of the text reflect far more than different exegetical possi-bilities. They present the internal religious life and the possibility of theexistence of a religious elite of a status fundamentally different from thatof other readers. It is they who realize the inner telos of religion.Even before we deal with the unique elements in Ibn Ezra’s concept ofesotericism, his definition of the instructed esotericist may teach us a fun-damental principle of the function of esotericism in the Middle Ages. Theinstructed person is, as we mentioned, one who bears a particular scien-tific knowledge, which is the key to the internal understanding of thetext, which, in the case of Ibn Ezra, deals with the astrological-hermeticworldview, which then becomes the inner meaning of Judaism. Conse-quently, the esoteric idea becomes a powerful tool for the integration andinternalization of external cosmological and theological views into thetradition. Thus, in the Middle Ages, under the cloak of esotericism, astro-logical, hermetic, Aristotelian, Neoplatonic, Gnostic, and other positionsfound their way into the heart of Judaism. Through the realm of the eso-teric, an encounter took place between the particularistic Jewish traditionand its surroundings, and doctrines of high cultural status were incorpo-rated into the Jewish tradition.This phenomenon, which was vigorously expounded during the Mid-dle Ages, became possible as a result of two fixed structural elementsEsotericism and Commentary•39"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"within esoteric teaching. The first and simpler element was the exegeticalrange that the esoteric idea grants to the canon of sacred scripture. Theaddition of an esoteric level expands the text’s “receptive capacity tomeaning” to almost infinite dimensions. What can be read into it be-comes far more varied and extreme. The esoteric idea provides a new andpowerful tool to exegesis as a means of receiving ideas and transformingthem into an integral part of the tradition. Thus, Ibn Ezra could claimthat the astrological worldview, which is apparently completely alien to thesurface meaning of the text, is in fact the internal meaning of that text.Ibn Ezra was of course not the only one to make such radical use of theexegetical opportunities offered by the idea of the existence of an esotericlevel; he did, however, clear new paths by making the esoteric realm intoa systematic method for absorbing the scientific worldview from thebroader surrounding culture.The second element of esoteric teaching is far more complicated andmore significant; it derives from the unregulated nature of the esotericrealm. The presentation of radical views as traditional Jewish esotericteachings became possible because, in esotericism, there is no revealedtradition that may be employed to critique the suggested esoteric teach-ing. A possible critic of the hermetic-astrological esoteric teaching of IbnEzra cannot employ the argument that these elements are not part of thetradition. To this argument, the esotericist may respond that the surfacelevel of the tradition cannot serve to contradict his claims, for after all,the entire realm was hidden and secretive. Small wonder, then, that dur-ing the Middle Ages, various thinkers proposed esoteric teachings thatwere radically opposed to one another, and the contents of the esotericrealms became widely varied and unregulated. Could there be, in the en-tire history of Jewish thought, two writings that differ from each othermore than the ZoharandGuide of the Perplexed? Yet both are canonicalworks, and both claim to be revelations of Jewish esoteric teachings. Esotericism is thus a powerful tool for the reception of a variety of teach-ings, none of which can claim priority through reference to other writtentexts or to the revealed tradition. Here we see the paradox of esotericismthat we discussed above cast in sharp relief: the esoteric realm, which wasdefined as esoteric to enable close guard, regulation, and the continuity ofa fixed and pure tradition, became the most unregulated and diverse fieldof all for those very reasons!It may be worthwhile to mention that the absorption of widely variedteachings into Jewish tradition through the medium of esotericism lentthem not only legitimacy, as part of the canonical text, but also primacy.When such doctrines are understood as esoteric and enshrouded with theaura of secrecy, they become accepted as the inner meaning of Judaism, sothat they penetrate to the most influential levels of meaning of the tradition.40•Chapter Five"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Medieval Jewry was characterized by a tradition of unusual intellectualflexibility, as a result of the medium of esotericism. Through this medium,it could digest the worldviews surrounding it, and these worldviews, withall their resultant ramifications, became the inner and deepest meaning ofJudaism in the eyes of its defenders.A telling example of the paradox of esotericism discussed here is the at-titude expressed by Ibn Ezra in his commentary on the verse “which theLord your God divided among all the nations” (Deuteronomy 4:19). Thisverse that refers to the heavenly bodies seems to imply that while Israel iscontrolled by God, the stars were allotted to the nations as forces thatwill control their fate. In order to avoid such a possible recognition of thedivine power of the stars, the Septuagint translation of the text changesthe meaning of the verse by adding that God divided the stars in order togive light to the nations. The stars accordingly do not have a power ofcontrol; they just provide light. Ibn Ezra, following his basic belief in theastrological power of the planets, affirms the direct and simple meaningof the verse: “Know that all the plants and living things in the land, andall the birds and cattle, wild animals and creeping things and all humansare linked to the forty-eight forms of the spheres, and this is what theLord your God divided among all the nations. And those who add thewordl’ha’ir(to give light to) are mistaken. Perhaps they knew this anddid not wish to reveal the secret and the evidence to Ptolemy and did notshare it with them” (long commentary to Exodus 33:21).6As Shlomo Selahas shown, this obscure passage is based on the tradition in the Talmuddealing with the Septuagint translation of the Pentateuch into Greek:It happened that King Ptolemy gathered seventy-two wise men andplaced them in seventy-two houses and did not reveal to them why hegathered them. He then came to each one of them individually and said to them, write me the Law of your teacher Moses. The Holy One,blessed be He, placed His counsel in the hearts of every one of themand they all were of exactly the same mind. And they wrote him . . .“that the Lord your God divided to give light to all the nations.”(Megilla 9b)The translators of the Pentateuch added the word l’ha’ir(to give light to);this addition, as many commentators have explained, was made in orderto avoid the erroneous understanding that the heavenly hosts have powerand mastery. The word l’ha’irdiminishes the importance of the stars andconstellations and demotes them from lords to servants. Ibn Ezra, on theother hand, maintained that the change introduced in translation was notto avoid possible error, but rather to conceal an important fact—the in-fluence of the stars upon the nations. As he writes in his commentary inDeuteronomy: “ ‘for he divided’: it is a known thing, that each and everyEsotericism and Commentary•41"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"nation has its star and constellation, and that each and every town has itsown constellation.” According to the astrological conception of Ibn Ezra,stars dominate the political fate of nations, and even influence the condi-tion of towns and states. It was this very fact that the translators at-tempted to conceal from Ptolemy; thus, they added the word l’ha’ir. Thesecret is the astrological structure of reality. Shlomo Sela identified thescientific-astrological context of this concealment. King Ptolemy, who inthe Arabic tradition—and, consequently, in the Jewish tradition as well—was seen as one of the founders of the science of astrology, recognizedthat the sages of Israel possessed incredibly accurate astrological knowl-edge. The translation of the Pentateuch was one of Ptolemy’s attempts toget a hold of these secrets. According to Ibn Ezra, the wise men changedthe meaning of the text in order to hide from Ptolemy the existence ofJewish astrological positions, and thus the astrological knowledge pos-sessed by the sages of Israel.Ibn Ezra’s claim, that the earlier wise men of Israel possessed astrolog-ical knowledge, was linked to the concept sod ha’ibur(the secret of inter-calation) mentioned in the Talmud, and the understanding that took root in the tenth century, that there is a secret tradition for calculating thecalendar, called “the calculation of Rav Ada bar Abba,” which differsfrom the revealed tradition, “the calculation of Shmuel,” mentioned inthe Talmud.7This concept is also expressed by Abraham bar Hiyya, acontemporary of Ibn Ezra who wrote at the beginning of the twelfth cen-tury, and another thinker who internalized the astrological worldviewand planted in the heart of Judaism:I read in one of the ancient books as follows: “I asked, my teachers,why was the calculation of Rav Ada done in private?” They told me,“Because all that happens in the world, famine or plenty, death or life,depends on the moon’s renewal and the season, and the sages fearedthat an immoral man might arise and destroy the world; and I acceptthis with all my heart, and know that this matter is true.”8Ibn Ezra, who, contrary to the view of Abraham bar Hiyya, did not be-lieve that Rav Ada’s calculation is based on magical knowledge, believedthat Rav Ada’s calculation aids in knowing the future, and consequentlymust be kept secret: “In my opinion, [Rav Ada’s calculation] was trans-mitted in private lest anyone who wished to know would know all thatwould come to pass in the land through the sages’ knowledge of the lawsof the zodiac.”9The esoteric conception in astrological matters of Abraham bar Hiyyaand Ibn Ezra continues the esoteric tradition dealing with the magicalnames in Hekhalot literature, and essentially creates a controlled distri-bution of power.42•Chapter Five"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"The accepted position in the twelfth century on ancient astrologicalknowledge possessed by the sages of Israel demonstrates the flexibility ofthe esoteric idea. Since, a priori, we cannot know what the secret of inter-calation or the secret of Rav Ada were, all of astrological knowledge canbe linked to it. The esoteric realm is, by its very nature, sealed; thus a va-riety of teachings, including the science of astrology, with its Greek, her-metic, and Arabic contents, may be projected onto it. Moreover, the issueof translation raised by Ibn Ezra in his comments on the concealment of knowledge from Ptolemy raises the issue of what might be called theambivalence of influence. Translation is a medium of cultural influence,and this is certainly the view that Ibn Ezra had of the Septuagint. Influ-ence and recognition are signs of the success of a tradition, and Ptolemyshowed interest in the Torah of Israel and recognized its importance andsupremacy. Too much and too wide success, however, poses a threat to the uniqueness of the tradition. The secret that is not transmitted in translation is what preserves the unique status of the tradition, evenunder extreme conditions of intercultural transmission and influence. Ina reality characterized by such widespread cultural links, secrecy has adouble function: it facilitates integration on a tremendous scale, whilealso creating consciousness of separation and isolation.Esotericism and Commentary•43"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 6Concealment and Heresy: Astrology and the Secret of the TorahA more detailedexamination of the concept of esotericism in the writingsof Ibn Ezra can illuminate another essential element of the esoteric ideain the Middle Ages. In Ibn Ezra’s commentaries, as we have seen, the esoteric refers to astrological and magic knowledge that elucidates theinner level of the text. This knowledge is the key to understanding vari-ous aspects of the commandments and of ritual, and also helps us com-prehend miracles. This layer, does not, however, merely exist alongsidethe revealed level of meaning. This deeper layer is in profound tensionwith the revealed level; the crux of the tension is the magical explanationsof Torah passages, whose plain meaning expresses the voluntary actionof a personal deity. The astral explanations impinge upon the meaning ofritual and the essence of miracles, and Ibn Ezra himself is aware that theyare in tension with the understandings of the larger body of the faithfulof Israel. This awareness is made explicit when Ibn Ezra provides a talis-manic explanation for the Temple. According to this explanation, the location and structure of the Temple were determined by the positions of the stars, so that the Temple is an instrument for attracting forces, according to the magic astral conception:We know that the glorious Name has informed us that His glory fills the entire world, yet there are places where the power of God ismade more manifest than in others, depending on two factors: The firstis the qualities of the nature of the receiver. The second is the extent ofheavenly powers which are (bestowed) upon the head of the receiver.Based on these, a place was chosen for the Temple. If the Lord hasplaced wisdom in your heart, you will understand the secret of the ark and the mercy-cover and the cherubim which spread their wings;and outside the veil, the candelabrum and the altar of incense and thetable [of the shew-bread]; and outside the entrance to the sanctuary,the altar of sacrifice and all its vessels, and the laver and its base—allthese things are the glory of God. Thus, I have only hinted of thesethings to you, for there are in our generation men who are wise intheir own eyes, who may otherwise mock my words. (Exodus 28:40;Weiser 2:177)"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"The fear of those who are “wise in their own eyes” is a reason for con-cealment. By contrast, the instructed person understands the profundityof the matter: “This is the rule: each cherub was made to receive heavenlypowers, in order that the instructed person may learn, and there is noneed to discuss this at length” (Exodus 28:40; Weiser 2:177). Further-more, Ibn Ezra employs the hierarchy of space to explain other Torahmatters, such as the Land of Israel or the concept of holy place in gen-eral.1The astrological position is accompanied by a hermetic magicalidea of the attraction and reception of divine power, a position clearlydemonstrated through the research on Ibn Ezra and his followers under-taken by Moshe Idel and Dov Schwartz.2The talismanic conception ex-plains the breastplate, the bronze serpent, the sin of the golden calf, thesacrifices,3and many other issues in Scripture. Ibn Ezra clearly reveals hisastrological views, although in places where he employs this view as akey to understanding ritual, he does so in hints; this later posed no smalldifficulty for his exegetes.The realm of the esoteric is not only a means for internalizing widercultural contexts, but also a shelter for positions that appear unorthodoxor heretical. We may say of all medieval esoteric doctrines that, as a rule,each one of them deeply undermines the structure of revealed faith as itappears in Scripture and in the Midrash. The esoteric has a subversive as-pect, which effectively precludes any decisive formulation of principles offaith, which might serve as a kind of Jewish dogma. The multiplicity ofcontradictory esoteric positions makes the formulation of Jewish theol-ogy an impossible mission. The esoteric is a wide field, which enables apparently heretical positions to thrive. Through the esoteric, questionsarise with respect to the basic concepts of revealed religion. We should bereminded that, because of the preferential status of the esoteric, hereticalpositions acquire a status as the inner core of religion and even as theloftiest pinnacle of religious life. As in the example of Ibn Ezra, the pen-etration of astrology and magic is not merely the incursion of “foreign”sources at the boundary of tradition; esotericism transforms these ele-ments into the holy of holies of the Jewish experience.Another area that Ibn Ezra considered as esoteric dealt with the secretof the Name and the concept of miracle. Here too, as in the concept ofritual, esotericism was linked to a causal magical conception, which pre-cipitates changes in the theology of will and personality. Ibn Ezra ex-plains his doctrine of names in his extensive commentary on the expres-sion “I am what I am” (Exodus 3:14). The name of God (YHWH) is thepersonal name of God, which refers to His essence, whereas the namesadonaiandelohimare adjectives, describing powers dependent on God;thus they are expressed in plural form. These names refer to the angelsthat establish the astrological order of the universe. Humans, whose sourceConcealment and Heresy•45"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"is in the upper worlds, may transcend the astrological constellation andperform miracles through his relation to the glorious Name of YHWH:“For the soul of man is of their type, and it receives heavenly powerthrough the constellation of the servants, and each servant stands oppo-sitethe great [heavenly] host at the hour of his creation. And if the soulbecomes wise, it may receive the secret of the angels and receive greatpower from the heavenly powers that it receives through the light of theangels. Then it shall cleave unto (davek) the glorious Name.” Later on in his commentary, Ibn Ezra describes two reactions to death: “WhenAdam saw that he was to die, he gave birth to a son so that the speciesmight be preserved, and so he received power and privilege as part of thecollective. . . but the sons of the prophets would isolate themselves, inthe hopes that each would receive [power], each according to his own ca-pacities. Thus, through this Name, signs and wonders could be intro-duced into the world, as it was said to him (Moses), ‘This is the gloriousName, ask for signs and wonders’ ” (Exodus 3:15; Weiser 2:34–35).The natural astrological constellation guarantees the existence of speciesin the world. Among the human species, the few instructed persons transcend the limits of the causal astrological framework by cleaving(d’vekut) to the Name, through which signs and wonders are performedin the world. In his commentary on the verse “And I appeared unto Abra-ham, Isaac, and Jacob through El Shaddai, and my name, YHWH, I didnot make known to them” (Exodus 6:3), Ibn Ezra describes his concep-tion of the names and the miraculous powers linked to knowing them asthe inner core of the entire Torah: “For this is the secret of the entireTorah” (Exodus 3:15; Weiser 2:47). The differences in the capacities ofmembers of the elect to liberate themselves from the astrological constel-lation and perform changes is a function of the level of their cleaving toGod (d’vekut): “For the forefathers did not reach the same level of cleav-ing to the Name (d’vekut) as Moses, whom God knew face to face. Thus,Moses could change the nature of the inferior world and effect signs andwonders, which the forefathers could not achieve” (Exodus 3:15; Weiser2:47). The miracle is no longer a free expression of God’s will. It takesplace through the human ability to transcend the astral system and receive power from the name YHWH Himself.Ibn Ezra frequently repeats that the comprehension of miracles is anesoteric matter—for example, in his commentary on the sin of Moses andAaron at the waters of Meribah: “The correct explanation, I will revealin hints. Know that when the part knows the all, it will cleave unto theall, and renew in the all signs and wonders. For in truth, God said toMoses ‘and you shall speak,’ yet they did not speak as a result of the peo-ple’s argument with Moses. And thus the part remains part. So, he hit therock and no water emerged until he hit it a second time” (Numbers 20:8;46•Chapter Six"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Weiser 3:171). The miracle depends upon the “part” knowing the “all”and cleaving unto it. The expression “the all” (hakol) in Ibn Ezra refersto God and the name YHWH: “For God is one and He is the creator of all and He is the all, and I may explain no further” (Genesis 1:26;Weiser 2:19).4Moses, who is the “part,” was to perform the miraclethrough his cleaving (d’vekut) to the glorious Name, but in the heat ofthe dispute with the people, he was obliged to hit the rock. The secret ofthe Name, which is part of astrological-magical knowledge, explains themiracle in the framework of a causal conception; as such it is similar tothe esoteric teaching on the understanding of law and ritual in Ibn Ezra’swritings.5Ibn Ezra, in one of his general comments about his esoteric teachings,identified these two areas—the concept of ritual and the concept of miracle—as the realms of the esoteric: “For in truth, within the words ofthe Torah, we must investigate the names of the glorious and awesomeGod, and profound secrets in the commandments and laws as well, whichno fool’s eye has beheld, and which are known only to the instructed.And if God help me that I may accomplish my vows, I shall explain someof them” (alternate interpretation to Genesis, Weiser 1:139). There aretwo esoteric matters common to the esoteric level of ritual and the secretof the Name. In both of them, the understanding of this level is reservedfor the instructed alone, as it is dependent on the internalization of awider scientific astrological-magical understanding. Thus, the public ofreaders is divided in two—the ignorant and the instructed. This stratifica-tion is typical of the esoteric teaching of Ibn Ezra in particular and me-dieval scholars in general. Furthermore, the esoteric level provides acausal picture underlying the revealed level of the text. Deep beneath thesurface of the biblical text lies a systematic natural picture which only theinstructed can identify, as only he can integrate the biblical words into aGreek and Arabic scientific worldview. This esoteric picture claims thatGod and the world are linked in a causal system, and ritual activates thiscausal framework. Regardless of its particular standpoint, the very ideaof a full causal translation stands in opposition to the biblical heritagethat assumes an interpersonal will that acts in the world within a covenan-tal relational framework. In such traditional understanding, ritual is notdesigned to activate God, but to please Him.6The esoteric level is thusnot merely an addition of depth to the surface level. In its bold transfor-mation of the basic understanding of God and the world the esoteric is infact an actual reversal of the surface level. In the writings of Ibn Ezra, thefirst commentator to make systematic use of the idea of an esoteric levelof Scripture, we find the basic traits that characterize medieval esotericism:the double text, the stratification of the reading public, the transforma-tion of the esoteric realm into a medium for integrating central positionsConcealment and Heresy•47"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"of the wider cultural context; finally, the possibility that the esoteric realmoffers for the penetration of positions that might be considered as border-ing on heresy into the holy of holies of the Jewish tradition. Consequently,the esoteric realm, which was designed to be sealed and guarded, became,for this very reason, unguarded and threatening.48•Chapter Six"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 7Double Language and the Divided Public in Guide of the PerplexedThe basic elementsof the esoteric structure in the conception of IbnEzra are found in the writings of Maimonides as well. Maimonides’ worksare the most important esoteric teachings of the philosophical movementin the Middle Ages. He was born in approximately 1135 and grew up inCordova before being forced to immigrate to North Africa, and wasthirty years old when Ibn Ezra died. He was the crown of the last gener-ation of the great Jewish Andalusian tradition, which produced Ibn Ezraas well. As one of the most renowned legal authorities in the Jewish medieval world, Maimonides’ authority as a towering talmudist gavegreat weight as well to his philosophical achievements. His stature as aphilosopher and talmudist and the centrality of his esoteric themes in his writings made concealment a vital cultural concern and a conflictingsource of identification, suspicion, and upheaval. Maimonides, like IbnEzra, was of the opinion that the elite that held the keys to the esoteric werethemaskilim, the instructed, the possessors of broad cultural knowledge.Maimonides, however, rejected completely the astrological-magical con-ception of Ibn Ezra, and belonged to a completely different philosophicalmovement in the Greek and Arabic world. The instructed, according toMaimonides, belonged to the Aristotelian movement, especially as un-derstood through the writings of al-Farabi. For both Ibn Ezra and Mai-monides, the esoteric facilitated broad cultural integration, by absorbinga metaphysical-scientific worldview, and defining it as the esoteric mean-ing of the Torah. The particular worldview that Maimonides absorbedthrough the esoteric and expressed through his teaching was completelydifferent, however, and relied on opposing metaphysical-scientific para-digms current in the medieval world. Although there is a huge differencein their metaphysical and scientific worldviews, the division of the learn-ing public into the instructed and the multitude is even more pronouncedfor Maimonides, as is the idea that the instructed form a distinguished religious elite, who are able to realize the loftiest elements of religious existence.1His treatise, Guide of the Perplexed, whose aim is the explication ofthe secrets of the Torah, is designated for the instructed alone: “My speechin the present Treatise is directed, as I have mentioned, to one who has"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"philosophized and has knowledge of the true sciences. . . . As for thosewho never even once see a light, but grope about in their night...thetruth. . . is entirely hidden from them. . . . They are the vulgar amongthe people. There is no occasion to mention them here in this treatise”(Introduction to Guide, pp. 10, 7–8). The group of the instructed doesnot include scholars competent in the matters of the Talmud and its laws,as Maimonides makes perfectly clear at the outset: “It is not the purposeof this Treatise to make its totality understandable to the vulgar or to be-ginners in speculation, nor to teach those who have not engaged in anystudy other than the science of the Law—I mean the legalistic study of theLaw. For the purpose of this Treatise and all those like it is the science ofLaw in its true sense” (5). According to Maimonides, one must distin-guish between the halakhic knowledge of the Talmud scholars and thetrue knowledge of the Torah. Thus, Maimonides sets up a tension, notonly between the ignorant multitudes and the instructed, but also be-tween the traditional scholarly elite and the esotericists.2The concept that the learning public is divided by a great gap betweenthe instructed and the uninstructed is accompanied, as in Ibn Ezra, by theconcept of a double language, which Maimonides develops in his intro-duction to Guide of the Perplexed. Maimonides links the esoteric to hisconcept of language in general; thus, he raises the issue of esotericism toa higher level of sophistication. Maimonides defines the content of Guide ofthe Perplexedas the explanation of equivocal names and the parables of Scripture: “The first purpose of the Treatise is to explain the meaningsof certain terms occurring in books of prophecy. Some of these terms areequivocal; hence the ignorant attribute to them only one or some of themeanings in which the term in question is used” (Introduction to Guide,p. 5). Further on he states: “This treatise also has a second purpose:namely, the explanation of very obscure parables occurring in the booksof the prophets, but not explicitly identified there as such. Hence an igno-rant or heedless individual might think that they possess only an externalsense, but no internal one” (6). An equivocal term is one that designatestwo different objects or refers to two disparate meanings. Maimonides isaware that there is no one-to-one correspondence between an expressionin language and an object or the content that it is supposed to refer to. Hesees this as a significant source of metaphysical error. For example, verbslikealah(“to ascend”) or yarad(“to descend”) refer to movements inspace, but they also have a borrowed meaning referring to social status,as in alah b’dargah (“ascended in rank”) or yarad min’khasav (“de-scended from [=lost] his worldly goods”), which refer to social spacerather than to change of position in physical space. The inability to distinguish which meaning is used in expressing movement in biblical language and the confusion between literal and borrowed meanings give50•Chapter Seven"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"rise to profound errors, which distort the understanding of reality, astransmitted by language. It is, however, this very element of language, its fundamental opacity, which facilitates its use as a political tool. Theequivocal word, like the parable, can be directed toward two publics simultaneously.The nontransparent nature of language is a source for great metaphys-ical errors but an opportunity as well for concealment and camouflage.This essential feature of language as an esoteric medium was highlightedin a completely different esoteric outlook—that of psychoanalysis. Freudpointed out the effective nature of the linguistic medium as a means forconcealment, in which unconscious mental material in disguise passes theinner censorship and appears camouflaged to the conscious mind:There is no need to be astonished at the part played by words indream-formation. Words, since they are the nodal points of numerousideas, may be regarded as predestined to ambiguity; and the neuroses(e.g., in framing obsessions and phobias), no less than dreams, makeunashamed use of the advantages thus offered by words for purposesof condensation and disguise. (Interpretation of Dreams, p. 456)In Maimonides’ words the ambiguous nature of language is of great po-litical value: “That which is said about all this is in equivocal terms sothat the multitude might comprehend them in accord with the capacity oftheir understanding and the weakness of their representation, whereasthe perfect man, who is already informed, will comprehend them other-wise” (Introduction to Guide, p. 9). The parable and the equivocal wordenable the prophet, who is the political leader, to address diverse strata ofthe public with the same linguistic expressions. The concept that the Torahhas an esoteric level of exegesis is linked to a much wider conception—both of human language and of the divided nature of the political public.In his esoteric conception, Maimonides continued tendencies in theGreek and Muslim world that viewed the realm of metaphysical and scientific knowledge as a realm that must be hidden.3InGuide of the PerplexedMaimonides himself explicates the link between the esotericphilosophical tradition and the secrets of the Torah:Do not think that only the divine science should be withheld from themultitude. This holds good also for the greater part of natural science.In fact we have repeatedly set down for you our dictum: “The Accountof the Beginning ought not to be taught in the presence of two men.”This is not only the case with regard to people adhering to the Law, butalso with regard to the philosophers and learned men of the variouscommunities in ancient times. For they concealed what they said aboutthe first principles and presented it in riddles. (I:17, pp. 42–43)Double Language and Divided Public•51"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Esotericism is, as we have discussed, a powerful tool for integratingworldviews into the heart of the Jewish tradition. Moreover, investiga-tion of the esoteric conception of Maimonides reveals that the very con-cepts of esotericism, as well as its limits and supporting arguments, aredrawn from the very same cultural background that Maimonides inte-grates into his esoteric teaching. That is, Maimonides sees esoteric doc-trine as an instrument bridging tradition and the Arabic Aristotelian sur-roundings; furthermore, his entire esoteric idea and its justification inJewish tradition are understood in terms of the philosophic tradition.The supporting arguments for esotericism in the Arabic philosophicaltradition, as expressed in the writings of al-Farabi, Ibn Bajja, Ibn Sina,and Ibn Rushd, are fundamentally linked to the tension between truthand society, as expressed with varying emphasis in the writings of thesephilosophers. The esoteric concept of Maimonides and its relation tophilosophical esotericism has been discussed by Leo Strauss, and at lengthrecently in Sarah Klein-Breslavy’s book, which deals with philosophicalesotericism in Maimonides’ writings.4Based on these studies, I analyzethe main justifications for esotericism as found in the thought of Mai-monides, and the various components of the tension between truth andsociety. Aside from guarding and justifying the boundaries of secrecy,Maimonides’ works repeatedly test the limits of esotericism. Maimonidesbuilds and breaches the walls of secrecy simultaneously. I believe that thediscussion of this tension, which is typical of the esoteric tradition of theMiddle Ages, can fundamentally change the conception of esotericism, asunderstood by Strauss. This is the focus of our discussion in the follow-ing chapter.Esotericism is intended, first and foremost, to protect the philosopherand philosophy from the mockery of the multitudes that cannot fathomit. More important, it protects the philosopher from the iron fist of the re-ligious or political authorities, who see the philosopher as a dangeroussubversive, seeking to undermine the political order or religious doctrine.Thus, Maimonides justifies the esoteric nature of Guide of the Perplexed,which is made up of fragments and chapter headings, as follows:A sensible man thus should not demand of me or hope that when wemention a subject, we shall make a complete exposition of it, or thatwhen we engage in the explanation of the meaning of one of the para-bles, we shall set forth exhaustively all that is expressed in that para-ble. An intelligent man would be unable to do so even by speaking directly to an interlocutor. How then could he put it down in writingwithout becoming a butt for every ignoramus who, thinking that hehas the necessary knowledge, would let fly at him the shafts of his ignorance? (Introduction to Guide, p. 6)52•Chapter Seven"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"Esotericism is thus a precondition for the existence of philosophy as anindependent and unrestricted domain. The philosopher protects his free-dom of thought through concealment, and in order to transmit his viewsto those who are worthy of receiving them, he develops sophisticated in-struments of writing and speaking in double language. Furthermore, eso-tericism is not only designed to protect the philosopher and philosophiz-ing, but the multitudes as well. The exposure of the multitudes, or anyonewho has not yet undergone the scientific educational process, to philo-sophical content will lead him to a loss of faith, since he will be incapableof understanding the truth and consequently will distort it: “If, however,he begins with the divine science, it will not be a mere confusion in his be-liefs that will befall him, but rather absolute negation” (GuideI:33, p. 71).He continues: “These true opinions were not hidden, enclosed in riddles,and treated by all men of knowledge with all sorts of artifice throughwhich they could teach them without expounding them explicitly, be-cause of something bad being hidden in them, or because they underminethe foundations of the Law, as is thought by ignorant people who deemthat they have attained a rank suitable for speculation. Rather have theybeen hidden because at the outset the intellect is incapable of receivingthem” (GuideI:33, p. 71).5For example, the argument that attributes ofquantity and quality do not apply to the deity will lead to denial of thevery existence of God, as the multitudes are dominated by the imagina-tive faculty, and cannot conceive of the existence of an abstract entity.The exposure of philosophical contents like these before the multitudeswill lead to the undermining of the very belief in God’s existence.Aside from the threat posed by the truth to the faith of the multitudes,the philosopher is aware that truth also undermines the social order andthe authority of law. The philosophical conception rejects the under-standing of God as a personality, and thus endangers the multitude’sfaithfulness to the law. Philosophical doctrines that describe prophecy as a process of apprehension based also on the imaginative faculty of theprophet—as opposed to the traditional anthropomorphic image, inwhich the sovereign God commands the law to his prophet—subvert theauthority of the law as the command of a sovereign God. Moreover, theMaimonidean conception of providence holds that the evildoer is aban-doned to the vagaries of chance and is not supervised at all, and that pun-ishment results from the destructive forces intrinsic to a life of sin. Thisconception threatens the multitude’s loyalty to the law, as this loyalty isbased on fear of punishment and expectation of rewards. The subvertingof the anthropomorphic conception of God, as a commanding sovereignwho supervises, punishes, and rewards, endangers the very existence of so-ciety as it enfeebles discipline and obedience to the law, which depends onthe belief that there is a judge and a higher judgment and that the evildoerDouble Language and Divided Public•53"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"will get his just deserts, even if he evades the ever-watchful eye of theworldly sovereign at the time that he commits the sin. Thus, Maimonidesincludes under the secrets of the Torah not only the creation narrativeand the chariot vision, in their restricted sense, but also prophecy, provi-dence, and knowledge dealing with the relationship of God to the world:And as for the . . . discussion concerning His creation of that which Hecreated, the character of His governance of the worlds, the “how” ofHis providence with respect of what is other than He, the notion of Hiswill, His apprehension, and His knowledge of all that He knows; andlikewise for the notion of prophecy and the “how” of its various de-grees,6and the notion of His names, though they are being indicativeof one and the same thing—it should be considered that these are ob-scure matters. In fact these are truly the mysteries of the Torah and thesecrets constantly mentioned in the books of the prophets and in thedicta of the Sages, may their memory be blessed. They are the mattersthat ought not to be spoken of except in chapter headings, as we havementioned, and only with an individual such as has been described.(GuideI:35, pp. 80–81)In his aim of guarding the structure of social authority, Maimonidesexpresses concern not only for the integrity of society, but also for the existence of philosophy itself. The philosopher requires an orderly soci-ety and a division of labor as is practiced in states, for the existence ofphilosophy as the highest human endeavor depends on its being hiddenfrom the multitudes. The philosopher’s dependence on society is describedin stark terms in Maimonides’ introduction to his commentary on theMishna:For if all humankind were learned philosophers, the world would bedestroyed, and man would be wiped out within a short time. For manis in need of many things, and he would have to learn to plow and reapand thresh and grind and cook, to make vessels and so on, before hecould get his food . . . and the lifetime of Methuselah would not sufficeto learn all the trades that man necessarily requires in order to exist.And, if so, when shall he learn wisdom and understand science? Thus,all these things are necessary to do the work that the world needs,whereas the learned man learns for his own sake.7Maimonides was of the opinion that the existence of the multitude wasan unalterable fact. Among other limitations, such as lack of time andtraining, there exists also a natural limitation of ability, which will alwaysexist. Consequently, esotericism becomes a permanent political fact. Thispassage demonstrates, however, a convergence of interests between theinterests of the philosopher and the apparently unfortunate situation of54•Chapter Seven"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"the existence of the multitude. Esotericism facilitates a division of labor,which is a prerequisite for the activity of the philosopher. The democrati-zation of knowledge or the universalization of the philosophical ethoswould bring destruction on the world; thus, to ensure the continued existence of the philosopher and philosophy, this ethos ought to remainrestricted to esotericists alone.In addition to the tension between truth and society in the Greek andArabic tradition, we find the idea that the social order is based on the dis-semination of myths, which are called necessary and useful beliefs. Thisidea, which played an important role in Plato’s Republic, in the works ofal-Farabi, and in Maimonides’ thought, exercised decisive influence inmedieval political thought on the relation between philosophy on the onehand and religion and politics on the other. According to this approach,the legislator or ruler should instill in his subjects a worldview beneficialto the existence of the state, without regard for the question as to whetherit is true or false. In his comments on the views that the Torah imparts tothe community, Maimonides distinguishes between true views, which aredesigned to bring man to utmost perfection, and necessary beliefs, whichcontribute toward the proper functioning of society:Among the things to which your attention ought to be directed is thatyou should know that in regard to the correct opinions through whichthe ultimate perfection may be obtained, the Law has communicatedonly their end. . . . In the same way the Law also makes a call to adoptcertain beliefs, belief in which is necessary for the sake of political wel-fare. Such, for instance, is our belief that He, may He be exalted, is violently angry with those who disobey Him and that it is thereforenecessary to fear Him and to dread Him and to take care not to disobey.(GuideIII:28, p. 512)At the end of that chapter, he writes:Sum up what we have said concerning beliefs as follows: In some casesa commandment communicates a correct belief, which is the one andonly thing it aims at—as for instance the belief in the unity and eternityof the deity and in His not being a body. In other cases, the belief is nec-essary for the abolition of reciprocal wrongdoing or for the acquisitionof a noble moral quality, as for instance, the belief that He, may He beexalted, has a violent anger against those who do injustice, accordingto what is said: “And my wrath shall wax hot, and I will kill” and soon, and the belief that He, may He be exalted, responds instantaneouslyto the prayer of someone wronged or deceived: “And it shall come to pass, when he crieth unto Me, that I will hear; for I am gracious.”8(GuideIII:28, pp. 513–514)Double Language and Divided Public•55"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"The true views were presented in abbreviated form and in chapterheadings, because broad scientific knowledge and natural intellectual ca-pabilities are necessary for their comprehension. By contrast, the usefulviews on providence and divine recompense appear in the Bible at lengthand in their entirety, as they are useful tools for the foundation of the social order, and are, as such, intended for the multitude.Myth functions not only to strengthen the political structure of society,but also to uproot contrary myths. Maimonides was of the opinion thatthe rule of idolatry over the multitude was linked to promises and threatsaddressed to man’s primal fears. Rational arguments, which prove thatpagan myth consists of idle threats and vain promises, cannot suffice touproot pagan practices. In order to displace a myth, a contrary mythmust be presented. Thus Maimonides argues, for example, that in orderto combat the threat made by the pagan priesthood, that whoever doesnot make his children pass through the fires of Moloch, his children willbe harmed, the Torah poses a contrary threat: namely, that whoever doesmake his children pass through the fires of Moloch, his family would beexterminated.Now it is known that it is in the nature of men in general to be mostafraid and most wary of losing their property and their children.Therefore the worshippers of fire spread abroad the opinion that thechildren of everyone who would not make his son or daughter to passthrough the fire would die. And there is no doubt that because of thisabsurd belief everybody hastened to perform this action because of thestrong pity and apprehension felt with regard to children.. . . Thereforethe Law is strongly opposed to this action, an opposition that is af-firmed in such terms as are not used with regards to other kinds of idol-atrous practices. . . .

(GuideIII:37, p. 546)Myth, in the sense of fabrication, is a necessary element of the politicalorder.In addition to political esotericism, we find in Maimonides’ writings aposition that sees esotericism as an essential characteristic of metaphysicallanguage. In this conception, metaphysical matters cannot be expressedthrough language, so that all we can do is hint at them through symbols:Know that whenever one of the perfect wishes to mention, either orallyor in writing, something that he understands of these secrets, according56•Chapter Seven"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"to the degree of his perfection, he is unable to explain with completeclarity and coherence even the portion that he has apprehended, as hecould do with the other sciences whose teaching is generally recog-nized. Rather there will befall him when teaching another that whichhe had undergone when learning himself. I mean to say that the subjectmatter will appear, flash, and then be hidden again, as though this were the nature of this subject matter, be there much or little of it. Forthis reason, all the Sages possessing the knowledge of God the Lord,knowers of the truth, when they aimed at teaching something of thissubject matter, spoke of it only in parables and riddles. (IntroductiontoGuide, p. 8)9The distinction between political esotericism and essential esotericismengenders different understandings of the biblical text. Political-social esotericism understands Scriptural parables as allegory, whose hiddencontents may be expressed in direct conceptual language. Essential eso-tericism sees the Scriptural parable as symbol rather than allegory. Thesymbol does not hide contents that could otherwise be expressed directlythrough concepts, but points and directs us to what cannot be expresseddirectly. Under this conception, the esoteric structure of language is notthe result of a strategy adopted by philosophy in its relation toward soci-ety, but is part of the essence of the philosophical realm.10The explanation for essential esotericism is formulated differently inthe introduction to Guide of the Perplexedthan in the chapters dealingwith the negative attributes. In the introduction to his book, Maimonidesargues that the understanding of truth in the area of the divine sciencescannot be replicated and repeated at will: “Sometimes truth flashes out tous so that we think it is day, and then matter and habit in their variousforms conceal it so that we find ourselves again in an obscure night, almost as we were at first” (7). According to Maimonides, proper under-standing in abstract metaphysical matters depends on liberation frommatter and habit; consequently, the ability to remain in this state dependson man’s degree of perfection. The writing or teaching of metaphysicalmatters is actually the attempt to reconstruct a particular state of con-sciousness in order to transmit it to someone else. Because of the elusivenature of truth, however, the writer cannot successfully duplicate thestate of consciousness entirely, so that he must resort to parable in orderto point to and hint at it.Unlike this approach, which focuses on restrictions arising from theexistential nature of man as a bodily creature, in his doctrine of negativeattributes Maimonides focuses on the limitations of language itself as asuitable vehicle of expression. The predicative structure of propositionsin human language cannot provide a suitable characterization of divineDouble Language and Divided Public•57"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"unity, which has neither subject nor object. Similarly, the understandingof attributes like “existing” or “wise” depends on there being a sharedcharacteristic of a common group of objects or persons which bear thoseattributes. Otherwise, these attributes would become proper names. Theassignment of attributes to God bridges between Him and other objectsin the world. Thus, the use of language to refer to God not only blemishesthe purity of the concept of unity, but also the complete otherness of Godfrom the world. These two limitations of religious language are definedby Maimonides in the following way: “Know that when you make an af-firmation ascribing another thing to Him, you become more remote fromHim in two respects: one of them is that everything you affirm is a per-fection only with reference to us, and the other is that He does not pos-sess a thing other than His essence, which, as we have made clear, is iden-tical with His perfections” (GuideI:59, p. 139). As language is limited byits very nature, any verbal expression attempting to describe God is nec-essarily blemished. Consequently, the instructed one does not employsymbols or hints but instead obliges himself to remain silent: “For ofwhatever we say intending to magnify and exalt, on the one hand we findthat it can have some application to Him, may He be exalted, and on theother we perceive in it some deficiency. Accordingly, silence and limitingoneself to the apprehensions of the intellects are more appropriate—justas the perfect ones have enjoined when they said: ‘Commune with yourown heart upon your bed, and be still. Selah’ ” (I:59, pp. 139–140).The question as to what the secret of Guide of the Perplexedis, whichhas troubled generations of exegetes and scholars of Maimonides,11is notcentral to our discussion. We seek to clarify what justifications esoteri-cism provided for itself and how the boundaries of esotericism are defined.We cannot, however, separate the two questions entirely. If the secret ofMaimonides in Guide of the Perplexedis, as some of his present and pastreaders claim, that the world is eternal and not created, and, conse-quently, that the concepts of providence, miracle, prophecy, revelation,and the World to Come must be reinterpreted, than the main focus of theesotericism issue is political.12According to this understanding of the secretofGuide of the Perplexed, esotericism is motivated by the need to protectsociety from the philosophical view of the eternal existence of the world,which denies that God has a will through whose power he created theworld at a particular point in time. The concept of eternity denies Godany component of personality. Without this, the essential beliefs on prov-idence and divine reward and punishment crumble, and consequently theauthority of the law as the expression of the sovereign will of God.In contrast to political esotericism and its inner connection to the con-cept of eternity, the concept of essential esotericism leads to an alternateunderstanding of the secret of Guide of the Perplexed, one advocated by58•Chapter Seven"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Shlomo Pines in one of his later articles.13In this conception, the structurallimitations of language at the root of essential esotericism lead to a skep-tical position with respect to the possibilities of cognition of God, andthis is the true secret of Guide of the Perplexed. The secret is, one mightsay, that there is no secret. The secret which may not be diffused is thathuman cognition does not have the capacity to formulate truths aboutGod, and, consequently, that there is no immortality of the soul, since im-mortality of the soul, in the Aristotelian tradition, depends on the level ofmetaphysical cognition it has attained. In the Middle Ages, this positionis attributed to al-Farabi. If this motif of esotericism is indeed to be foundin the writings of Maimonides, than al-Farabi and Maimonides raisedearly on an idea that manifests deep presence in modern literature—inKafka and Borges, for example. This is, then, once-removed esotericism,whose meaning is not the protection of certain secret contents, but ratherthe fact that in reality such contents do not exist. Esotericism is thus abarrier against demystification, since the very existence of the esotericidea is important and must be defended. The esotericists know that thedomain of the esoteric is the null and void.Double Language and Divided Public•59"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 8The Breaching of the Limits of the Esoteric: Concealment and Disclosure in Maimonidean EsotericismMaimonides invested significant efforts not only in expounding the secrets of the Torah, but also in order to explain, from various angles,why the category of concealment was necessary. Among all the medievalscholars who dealt with the secrets of the Torah, Maimonides dealt mostsystematically with the esoteric idea, as well as with the method of writ-ing his own esoteric teachings. Maimonides’ extensive attempt in clarify-ing why esotericism was needed was an integral part of his exegeticalstrategy. He explained to the perplexed person that the Scriptures containa concealed layer of meaning that can resolve his perplexity; in doing so,he must explain to his reader the reasons for the existence of such a level.Without a sufficient and satisfying explanation for the need for esoteri-cism, especially as it pertains to certain matters that Maimonides definesas the secrets of the Torah, his exegetical method loses its credibility. Inhis broad development of the need for esotericism, he prepares the heartsof the perplexed to accept the claim that the true meaning of Jewish tra-dition must be sought beyond the revealed and inflexible layer of theHoly Scriptures. The various explanations for the existence of esotericJewish teachings were derived, as we have seen, from the Greco-Arabicphilosophical tradition. Thus, Maimonides employs a path of double in-tegration: not only did he integrate metaphysical contents and theologi-cal conceptions of the cultural milieu around him through the medium ofesoteric teaching, but the very concept of esotericism was borrowed fromthe philosophical culture and incorporated into Jewish tradition. Mai-monides’ ability to interpret the limitations of esotericism in the talmudictradition in philosophical terms enabled him to interpret the very con-tents of esotericism as linked to philosophical concepts. On the otherhand, the assumption that the secrets of the Torah were linked to thephilosophical tradition lent greater force to the idea that esotericism isdependent on considerations raised by the philosophical tradition. Thuswe have a closed, perfect circle of content and framework arguments,which mutually support one another.Maimonides’ conscious and extensive discussion of the esoteric and its justifications testifies to a certain loosening of the limits of secrecy."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"The esotericist who reveals the existence of a secret and speaks of the jus-tifications for its concealment treads the line between disclosure and con-cealment, for the total protection of the esoteric is rendered impossible bythe very mention of its existence.

Theharsh attention of the censor would have been drawn to his work evenmore if, following the practice of Maimonides, he had also explained atlength the need for such concealment and the literary techniques that hewas employing in the process. It is clear that Maimonides was interestedin revealing that he is hiding no less than in concealing.At this point, it is important to shift the focus of our discussion fromthe research dealing primarily with esotericism and its justifications tothe question of the testing of the boundaries of the esoteric. How didMaimonides tread the thin line between concealment and disclosure, andhow did he relate to his own position in the history of esotericism?Maimonides was aware that his book Guide of the Perplexed was un-precedented in the history of Jewish esoteric teaching. From his point ofview, before his day no composition had ever been addressed to esoteri-cists alone. While the Bible and the agaddah undoubtedly contain an es-oteric layer, they are addressed to two different communities at the sametime.Guide of the Perplexed, on the other hand, is addressed to a singlecommunity alone—the reader who can, of his own understanding, fathomthe secrets of the Torah. Consequently, as Maimonides himself proclaimed,Guide of the Perplexedfundamentally changed the nature of esotericwriting. If the esoteric writing of the Bible and the Midrash were charac-terized by parables and equivocal words, Maimonides eschewed the useof parables for the transmission of concealed messages. If the purpose ofGuide of the Perplexedwas the explanation of the secrets of the Torah,the addition of parable upon parable would be counterproductive. Mai-monidesdescribes a previous attempt of his in esoteric writing, an attemptthat remained incomplete:We had already promised in the commentary on the Mishna that wewould explain [strange subjects in the Book of Prophecy and in theBook of Correspondence—the latter being a book in which we prom-ised to explain] all the difficult passages in the Midrashim where theexternal sense manifestly contradicts the truth and departs from the in-telligible. They are all parables. However, when, many years ago, webegan these books and composed a part of them, our beginning to ex-plain matters in this way did not commend itself to us. For we saw thatif we should adhere to parables and to concealment of what ought toThe Limits of the Esoteric•61"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"be concealed, we would not be deviating from the primary purpose.We would, as it were, have replaced one individual by another of thesame species. (Introduction to Guide, p. 9)Maimonides abandoned the strategy of employing parables in esotericwriting, as he chose not to address his words to two communities simul-taneously. Guide of the Perplexed is addressed to those who can under-stand the inner content of the parable without harm. In his words, “Myspeech in the present Treatise is directed, as I have mentioned, to one whohas philosophized and has knowledge of the true sciences” (IntroductiontoGuide, p. 10). He switches from the use of parallels to an alternativetechnique of esoteric writing, that of chapter headings. Thus, in Guide ofthe Perplexed, the secrets of the Torah are transmitted a bit here and a bitthere, scattered among other teachings. The instructed one knows how toconnect them and develop them into a unified system:Hence you should not ask of me here anything beyond the chapterheadings. And even those are not set down in order or arranged in co-herent fashion in this Treatise, but rather are scattered and entangledwith other subjects that are to be clarified. For my purpose is that thetruths be glimpsed and then again be concealed, so as not to opposethat divine purpose which one cannot possibly oppose and which hasconcealed from the vulgar among the people those truths especiallyrequisite for His apprehension. As He has said: “The secret of the Lordis with them that fear Him.” (Introduction to Guide, pp. 6–7)This esoteric style is based on a talmudic source that states that to onewho is a sage and understands of his own knowledge one may transmitchapter headings alone. But although Maimonides, in his writing, baseshimself on a traditional esoteric technique, he made a substantial breachin its boundaries. The transmission of chapter headings is a technique oforal transmission to individuals. Writing, on the other hand, even if it islimited to chapter headings, is by nature not restricted to the sage whounderstands of his own knowledge. This breaking of the esoteric codewas of concern to Maimonides as well:They have already made it clear how secret the account of the chariotwas and how foreign to the mind of the multitude. And it has beenmade clear that even that portion of it that becomes clear to him whohas been given access to the understanding of it, is subject to a legalprohibition against its being taught and explained except orally to oneman having certain stated qualities, and even to that one only the chap-ter headings may be mentioned. This is the reason why the knowledgeof the matter has ceased to exist in the entire religious community, sothat nothing great or small remains of it. And it had to happen like this,62•Chapter Eight"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"for this knowledge was only transmitted from one chief to another andhas never been set down in writing. If this is so, what stratagem can I use to draw attention toward that which may have appeared to me as indubitably clear, manifest, and evident in my opinion, according to what I have understood in these matters? (Guide, Introduction toPart 3, p. 415)Maimonides thus clearly identifies two different techniques of trans-mission of esoteric knowledge. The first is the simultaneous address totwo separate publics by means of parables and equivocal words. This isa technique of esoteric writing, as he describes explicitly: “Know thatwith regard to natural matters as well, it is impossible to give a clear ex-position when teaching some of their principles as they are. For youknow the saying of [the Sages], may their memory be blessed: ‘The Ac-count of the Beginning ought not to be taught in the presence of twomen.’ Now if someone explained all those matters in a book, he in effectwould be teaching them to thousands of men. Hence these matters toooccur in parables in the books of prophecy” (Introduction to Guide, p. 7).The other technique—transmission of chapter headings to one who un-derstands of his own knowledge—is exclusively a method of oral trans-mission. Maimonides breaches the barriers of secrecy by eschewing theuse of parables and by committing chapter headings to writing. The para-ble is a more guarded degree of esoteric writing, for it does not reveal,even in part, esoteric contents, and especially because it does not claim tobe esoteric. The proclamation of esotericism is the first step toward itsdisclosure, as the history of Guide of the Perplexed proves. Beginningwith the second half of the thirteenth century, its secrets were the subjectof widespread commentary. The writing of a composition that declares it-self to be an esoteric composition on the secrets of the Torah, even if onlythrough chapter headings, is a quantum leap in the treatment of esotericmatters.1Consequently, Maimonides attempted to narrow the breach by meansof a literary device identified by Strauss.2The “narrative frame” thatMaimonides supplies for the writing of Guide of the Perplexeddescribesits genesis as a collection of letters, sent chapter by chapter to a studentwho departed for a faraway land. A letter is the form of writing closest tooral transmission, as it is destined to one sole addressee. In the case ofGuide of the Perplexed, the letter is intended for all those addressees whopossess qualities similar to the original recipient of the letter, that is, thosewho are sages and understand of their own knowledge. By employing theliterary device of the letter, Maimonides attempted to create a genre ofwriting that would be extremely close to direct restricted transmission. Inaddition, Maimonides adjures the understanding reader not to reveal theThe Limits of the Esoteric•63"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"secrets of Guide of the Perplexedto others. Guide of the Perplexedre-mains, however, an open public letter; thus, all these devices did not suc-ceed in calming Maimonides’ own conscience over the breaching of thebarriers of esotericism.Maimonides’ hesitations and his justifications for violating the tradi-tions of esotericism are evident in his words in the introduction to Guideof the Perplexed and in the introduction to the third part of the compo-sition. Maimonides provides a justification for the disclosure of secrets byauthoring a sophisticated reconstruction for the history of esotericism,and by defining his own unique place in that tradition. In his opinion, theesoteric tradition in Israel died out because (among other reasons) the re-strictions on esotericism were strictly enforced:They have already made it clear how secret the Account of the Chariotwas and how foreign to the mind of the multitude. And it has beenmade clear that even that portion of it that becomes clear to him whohas been given access to the understanding of it, is subject to a legalprohibition against its being taught and explained except orally to oneman having certain stated qualities, and even to that one only the chap-ter headings may be mentioned. This is the reason why the knowledgeof the matter has ceased to exist in the entire religious community, sothat nothing great or small remains of it. And it had to happen likethis, for this knowledge was only transmitted from one chief to an-other and has never been set down in writing. (Guide, Introduction toPart III, p. 415)3The continuity of the esoteric tradition as strictly regulated oral trans-mission depends on territorial and institutional continuity, which is im-possible given the situation of Israel in exile. Moreover, the influence ofChristian philosophy and the Kalam on Jewish thinkers resulted in thecorruption of the correct scientific tradition that was employed by thesages before the period of exile: “Know that the many sciences devotedto establishing the truth regarding these matters that have existed in ourreligious community have perished because of the length of time that haspassed, because of our being dominated by the pagan nations, and be-cause, as we have made clear, it is not permitted to divulge these mattersto all people. For the only thing it is permitted to divulge to all people arethe texts of the books” (GuideI:71, p. 175). According to Maimonides,the internal and deep meaning of Jewish tradition was lost; he believesthat he too possesses no esoteric tradition: “Nor did I receive what I believe in this matter from a teacher” (Guide, Introduction to Part III,p. 416). This claim is of utmost importance, if we compare it to some ofthe kabbalistic conceptions, which present Torah secrets as traditionsdating from time immemorial.464•Chapter Eight"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"The esoteric world that was forgotten and lost was reconstructed byMaimonides, as he writes, through his own intellect. In the continuationof his introduction to Part III of Guide of the Perplexed, he presents the crisis situation as the reason for its commission to writing: “On theother hand, if I had omitted setting down something of that which hasappeared to me as clear, so that knowledge will perish when I perish, asis inevitable, I should have considered that conduct as extremely cow-ardly with regard to you and everyone who is perplexed. It would havebeen, as it were, robbing one who deserves the truth of the truth, or begrudging an heir his inheritance” (Guide, Introduction to Part III, pp. 415–416). Maimonides described himself as a sudden manifestationof a Jewish esoteric doctrine that has no continuous past and which willhave no continuation once he leaves this world. His life was a moment ofgrace which, in the future, may be hidden and vanished, becoming partof the history of an extinct tradition. The survival of the internal mean-ing of the Jewish tradition thus depends on Maimonides’ readiness tobreak the bounds of willful silence, and disseminate esoteric teachings.The historical picture of the genealogy of Jewish esoteric doctrine, aspainted by Maimonides, as well as the singular, incomparable status enjoyed by Maimonides within this picture (based on his own self-consciousness), legitimize the breaching of esoteric boundaries in Guideof the Perplexed.Moreover, the defining of the addressee of esotericism as perplexed in-tensifies the crisis that serves as justification for the weakening of esotericrestrictions. This perplexed person is described as one faithful to the reli-gion of Israel, bearing a scientific and philosophical education, and asone unaware of the esoteric layer of Scripture. He is troubled in his rela-tionship to the revealed layer of religion:Hence he would remain in a state of perplexity and confusion as towhether he should follow his intellect, renounce what he knew con-cerning the terms in question, and consequently consider that he hasrenounced the foundations of the Law. Or he should hold fast to hisunderstanding of these terms and not let himself be drawn on togetherwith his intellect, rather turning his back on it and moving away from it, while at the same time perceiving that he had brought loss tohimself and harm to his religion. He would be left with those imagi-nary beliefs to which he owes his fear and difficulty and would notcease to suffer from heartache and great perplexity. (Introduction toGuide, pp. 5–6)Consequently, the disclosure of secrets through hints and through writ-ing is a necessary means of preserving the instructed Jewish elite from the crisis it is undergoing. Maimonides writes this explicitly as part of hisThe Limits of the Esoteric•65"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"testament at the opening of Guide of the Perplexed, after describing hishesitations over the writing of the secrets of the Torah:God (may He be exalted) knows that I have never ceased to be exceed-ingly apprehensive about setting down the things that I wish to setdown in this Treatise. . . . However, I relied on two premises, the onebeing [the Sages] saying in a similar case, “It is time to do somethingfor the Lord [they may violate Your Law]” and so on; the second beingtheir saying, “Let all thy acts be for the sake of Heaven.” Upon thesetwo premises have I relied when setting down what I have composed insome of the chapters of this Treatise.To sum up: I am the man who when the concern pressed him and hisway was straitened and he could find no other device by which to teachdemonstrated truth other than by giving satisfaction to a single virtu-ous man while displeasing ten thousand ignoramuses—I am he whoprefers to address that single man by himself, and I do not heed theblame of many creatures. For I claim to liberate that virtuous manfrom that into which he has sunk, and I shall guide him in his perplex-ity until he becomes perfect and he finds rest. (Introduction to Guide,pp. 16–17)The breach of esoteric barriers, which is akin to the violation of theLaw, is done for the sake of Heaven, for the spiritual state of the Jewishelite is endangered. The characterization of the esoteric community asperplexed and the description of its distress magnify the sense of crisis,which serves as the justification for writing. In addition to the descriptionthat the secrets of the Torah were forgotten and have disappeared, andthatGuide of the Perplexedpresents the only possibility for reconstruct-ing them, Maimonides presents an additional claim: that the loss of theesoteric tradition results in confusion and crisis among the elite. Mai-monides thus preferred to consecrate his efforts to saving the elite, whilepaying the social and political price that resulted from the emergence ofphilosophy from underground.5The fate of the instructed Jewish elite depends on the breaching of the barriers of secrecy; in his own self-consciousness, Maimonides was convinced that his teaching was the soleand final opportunity to save this group.The claim that a severe crisis was taking place in the esoteric tradition,as justification for the breaching of the boundaries of esotericism fromthe inside, that is, on the part of those who declare their faithfulness tothat tradition, is a standard device in esoteric literature. We have alreadydiscussed the consciousness of crisis as justification for the disclosure ofsecrets in the Hekhalot literature, and this claim will continue to surfacein various contexts. But Maimonides lent this form a unique tinge. Theparticular crisis designated by Maimonides, that is, the perplexity of the66•Chapter Eight"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"instructed persons, is tied to the particular function of the esoteric idea inmedieval philosophical tradition. In his description of the perplexed oneand his confusion, Maimonides clearly delineated the function of esotericdoctrine, as we described earlier. The esoteric realm enables the inte-gration of two apparently contradictory worlds—the plain meaning ofScripture and the philosophical and scientific context in which the per-plexed person is immersed. This contradiction is resolved through a sys-tematic understanding of the hidden layer of the text, which integratesphilosophical and scientific matters.Leo Strauss claimed that Maimonidean esotericism was linked to thetension between truth and society as well as to the survival of philosophyas an unrestricted occupation. In his opinion, Maimonides belonged to amovement that saw philosophy as an esoteric occupation, and treated itesoterically in his own writings. While those elements are indeed presentin Maimonides’ thought, it would seem that the esoteric idea has an additional, more central role in his conception. Maimonides details hisstruggle with the need for secrecy; he frequently repeats his claim for theexistence of Torah secrets, while focusing explicitly and consciously onthe nature of his own writings and the fact that they breach the bound-aries of secrecy. These factors demonstrate that more important thanMaimonides’ interest in preserving secrecy was his interest in utilizing theesoteric idea. Moreover, the presence of apparently esoteric philosophicalideas in Maimonides’ public halakhic writings, in his Commentary on theMishna, and in his Mishneh Torah, as demonstrated by David Hartman,6blurs the distinction between the revealed and the concealed as a distinc-tion between halakha and philosophy. If Leo Strauss were correct in hisunderstanding of the meaning of esotericism in the writings of Mai-monides, then Maimonides’ systematic preoccupation with the existenceof the esoteric, with the need for secrecy, and with esoteric writing wouldbe out of place, as one who wishes to preserve secrecy should avoid men-tion of secrets. Thus, Maimonides is not a direct successor to the esotericphilosophical tradition; rather, he added an additional claim to it. Thenature of his claim is that once the philosophers have determined thatphilosophy is an esoteric science, and once Maimonides had identifiedphysics and metaphysics with the work of creation and the vision of thechariot, and thus linked the esoteric philosophical tradition to the talmu-dic one, he could now convince the instructed person that an esotericlevel existed in Scripture itself, and that the recognition of the existenceof this level could redeem him from his confusion.Strauss remarked that the reading of Guide of the Perplexeddrew hisattention to the sociology of philosophy and to its esoteric side, and fromGuide of the Perplexed he turned to an analysis of the more ancientsources of this phenomenon. But Guide of the Perplexed enables us toThe Limits of the Esoteric•67"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"identify clearly the place of the esoteric phenomenon in the history of phi-losophy, specifically because Maimonides deviated from previous prac-tice, while claiming for himself a unique and separate place in the historyof the esoteric tradition.7This deviation is already explicit, as we haveshown, in the conscious and reflexive discussion of the phenomenon ofesotericism, and is linked to the fact that Maimonides employed the esoteric idea for the purpose of effecting a revolutionary integration be-tween apparently contradictory cultural traditions. To the traditional position with respect to the esoteric conception of Maimonides, whichclaims that secrecy is a way of protecting philosophy’s position as a sep-arate autonomous realm, we must add the conception that esotericism isa means of incorporating philosophy into the interior of the tradition.These opposing poles define the fragile tension between concealment anddisclosure in the new molds created by Maimonides in his transmissionof the esoteric.68•Chapter Eight"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 9From Transmission to Writing: Hinting, Leaking,and Orthodoxy in Early KabbalahIn the twelfth and thirteenthcenturies, while Ibn Ezra’s and Mai-monides’esoteric projects were flourishing, a parallel yet strikingly differentesoteric option emerged through the various traditions of the Kabbalah.This form of Jewish mysticism, quite distinct from its earlier tradition of theHekhalot, constructed divinity as a living organism emanating from thedepth of God’s infinite essence into his revealed and complex dimensions—thesefirot. The first text that testified to this form of esoteric knowledgewas the book of Bahir, which surfaced in Provence in the middle of thetwelfth century. The earlier kabbalistic centers known to us in Provence andsubsequently at the beginning of the thirteenth century in Gerona per-ceived the Torah as a forest of symbols for God’s inner life, mirroring thecomplex and fragile balance between the sefirot. These esoteric traditionswere geared toward postulating the role of humans as maintaining theproper harmony and flow of God’s inner being through the practice of thecommandments. The specific content of the various esoteric doctrines de-veloped in the early Kabbalah will not concern us here. Rather, I wish tofocus on the concept of esotericism itself, on its justifications, and its so-cial and cultural functions, as well as the varied and contradictory waysin which kabbalists and kabbalistic streams throughout the twelfth andthirteenth centuries tested the boundaries of esotericism and the means ofits transmission. This period opens with Sefer Habahirin the second halfof the twelfth century and ends about a hundred years later with the com-position of the Zohar. The kabbalistic literature created during this periodincludes the traditions and writings of the kabbalists of Provence, the writ-ings of the kabbalists of Gerona, the Kabbalah of Nahmanides, the HugHa’iyun(Circle of Contemplation), and the writings of the Cohen broth-ers and those of Meir Ibn Sahula and Moses of Burgos. Notwithstandingthe tremendous differences between the thought of Ibn Ezra and Mai-monides and that of the early kabbalists, they do share an important com-mon feature: their consciousness of explaining the hidden layer of the sa-cred scriptures and the encoding of their own explanations in one formor another. This is a thought-provoking fact. Why did esotericism flourishspecifically during this period, in which every one of the major streams of Jewish thought presented their teachings as esoteric explanations of"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"esoteric layers? Did esotericism serve similar functions in widely differingcontexts? After discussing in detail the conceptions of esotericism and itslimits in the early Kabbalah, we will focus our attention on the significanceof the simultaneous flourishing of this wide variety of esoteric traditions.Beyond the astounding structural parallels among the different esoterictraditions, the means of transmission of esoteric teachings and the testingof the limits of esotericism are constantly nourished by the mutual rela-tions among the various movements. As we will see, the guarding of eso-tericism fosters the coexistence of radically differing worldviews. In theesoteric situation, the revealed level is the common unifying platform,while differing and contradictory positions develop beneath the surface;these differing positions may coexist only as long as they remain secret.Once, however, the boundaries of secrecy in any one movement are burst,this fragile coexistence is destabilized; this in turn sets off a kind of chainreaction, which results in significant changes in the definition of theboundaries of esotericism of the other movements and in its means oftransmission and writing.1Before we investigate this dynamic in detail,we should examine the different ways in which esotericism was formu-lated in the writings of the early kabbalists.The earliest discussion of esotericism and the paths of transmission ofkabbalistic knowledge is found in a letter of Rabbi Isaac the Blind toNahmanides and Rabbi Yonah Gerondi. Isaac the Blind, the first knownauthor of a kabbalistic text, wrote a highly esoteric commentary on SeferYetzira. A descendent of the aristocracy of Jewish learning and scholar-ship in Provence—his father was Ravad (Avraham ben David), the greattalmudist from Posquières, and his grandfather was Avraham ben Yitzhak,author of Sefer Ha’eshkol—Isaac the Blind became the dominant figureof the kabbalistic center in Provence and attributed his kabbalistic tradi-tions to his great aristocratic ancestry. He was called “Hehasid” (the piousone) by his revering students, two of whom, Ezra and Azriel, carried histeaching from Provence to Catalonia and established a kabbalistic schoolin Gerona. Given the decisive role of Isaac the Blind in the emergence ofKabbalah, such a letter, which was published and discussed by GershomScholem, is a precious document that reveals the shape of the esoteric tra-dition and its inner logic. The letter raises the issue of the internal ten-sions relating to esotericism in the early Kabbalah, and describes essentialchanges in the patterns of esotericism in kabbalistic knowledge that occurred during the initial decades of the thirteenth century. Rabbi Isaacthe Blind rails against the dissemination of the Kabbalah, and contrastsits dissemination with the deeds of his forefathers:And I come neither in rebellion nor in betrayal, and until now I havenot spoken; I do so now only out of my great fear and trepidation; for70•Chapter Nine"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"I have seen the sage and wise and pious who wagged their tongues andstretched out their hands to write of great and awesome things in theirbooks and letters. But what is written abides in no cabinet; for often, itmay be lost or its owner may die, and the books thus come into thehands of fools and mockers, and consequently, the Name of Heaven isdesecrated. And so it happened through them. While I was with them,I warned them in person many times. But once I departed from them,a mishap occurred at their hands. For I was not accustomed to this, formy fathers were the nobles of the land and disseminators of the Torahamong many, and no such thing ever departed from their lips. For theywould act toward others as if they were not versed in wisdom, and I observed them and took heed. I have also heard from the landsaround you and from the people of the city of Burgos that they speakopenly in marketplaces and in the streets as agitated and confused peo-ple, and from their words it is clear that their hearts have turned awayfrom the divine and they have cut down the shoots. For the matters areunited as a flame to its blazing coal, for there is but one Lord and thereis none other beside Him.2Rabbi Isaac the Blind describes his father and grandfather, early kab-balists who lived in the second half of the twelfth century, as strict esoteri-cists. Not only did they not commit hinted disclosures of Torah secrets towriting, but they even presented themselves to their surroundings as ifthey were completely unaware of esoteric knowledge. This esoteric moldwas soon broken by none other than Rabbi Isaac the Blind himself, whowrote an enigmatic commentary on Sefer Yetzira,3and especially by hisdisciples, Rabbi Ezra and Rabbi Azriel. As Gershom Scholem surmised,the main thrust of Rabbi Isaac the Blind’s criticism is directed towardthem. Rabbi Isaac the Blind briefly presents the conditions leading to thisdissemination: “And once I departed from them, a mishap occurred attheir hands.” The unraveling of the organic ties of transmission, con-trolled by the transmitter, and the need of his students to establish theirown center created the conditions in which the barriers of esotericismwere breached. Rabbi Isaac the Blind publicly opposes the writing ofTorah secrets because such literature may fall into the hands of those whodo not understand it correctly, or into the hands of those who seek tomock it; thus its dissemination results in a desecration of the name ofGod. Scholem advanced the hypothesis that these words were written inresponse to the polemic letter of Rabbi Meir ben Shimon against the Kab-balah, in which he argued that the Kabbalah is a heresy which under-mines the unity of God. Aside from its sharp criticism, the letter describesthe destruction of books of Kabbalah, which were carried out around the fourth decade of the thirteenth century, with the approval of RabbiFrom Transmission to Writing•71"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"Meir’s uncle, Rabbi Meshulam ben Moshe, the author of the Hashlamah.According to Scholem, Rabbi Isaac the Blind accused his disciples of alack of discretion leading to desecration of the name of God.Isaac the Blind showed esteem toward the kabbalists of Gerona, call-ing them “sage and wise and pious, by whose hands a mishap occurred.”His attitude toward the kabbalists of Burgos was totally hostile. Whereasthe former erred in diffusing their knowledge though their Kabbalah wastrue, the kabbalists of Burgos, in his estimation, spread heresy: “Theyspeak openly in marketplaces and in the streets as agitated and confusedpeople, and from their words it is clear that their hearts have turned awayfrom the divine and they have cut down the shoots. For the matters areunited as a flame to its blazing coal.” Whatever the exact circumstancessurrounding the writing of the letter may be, it indicates that the conceal-ment of the kabbalistic conception stems from the fact that the doctrineof the sefirotcreates a theosophy that treads the thin and dangerous linebetween the unity and the plurality of the godhead. The exposure of thisposition may influence fools to believe in a plurality of gods, as a resultof their erroneous understanding of the authoritative sources of esotericdoctrine. In the less harmful case, this dissemination can provide the kab-balists’ opponents with ammunition for their accusations of heresy. Eso-teric doctrine lies on the border of heresy; thus it must be restricted to theelite. The esotericists must therefore see to the initiation of individualswho are able to walk at the edge of the yawning abyss of plurality withoutstumbling, and to distinguish the fine, fine line between faith and heresy.Echoes of the letter rebuking the disseminators of esotericism may beheard in the writings of Asher ben David, the nephew of Isaac the Blind.In his letter, Rabbi Isaac stated that Asher ben David is his faithfulspokesman. In Asher ben David’s writings, however, we find a dramaticchange that pushes the frontiers of esotericism a step further. The writ-ings of Asher ben David reveal far more than what was breached byRabbi Ezra and Rabbi Azriel; in their explicit, didactic nature, they arequite distant from the strict esotericism of the kabbalists of Provence,among them the Ravad, the grandfather of Rabbi Asher ben David. Atthe conclusion of Sefer Hayihud, which repeatedly and extensively em-phasize the nature and unity of the sefirot, Rabbi Asher addresses himselfand clarifies his orientation toward the question of esotericism:And in all these matters I have wrote and rewrote again and again, andmentioned each and every time the reason for the matter....Thus,I came to speak at length in several areas where I should have beenmore brief; I would not have done so, if not for those who speak boast-fully, with haughtiness and mockery; they opened wide their mouthsand wagged their tongues and spoke things untrue of the agreeable and72•Chapter Nine"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"delightful disciples, who received their teachings from the instructed ofIsrael, seekers of the Lord, pious of the Most High, who cry out to Himand are answered, who take pain in all the troubles of their fellows,and seek the visage of their Creator on their behalf and receive His re-sponse. Their prayers are accepted and several miracles have been per-formed by them, both for individuals and for the public. For againstthe students who studied before them and received the tradition fromtheir mouths, the slanderers have spoken evil, things that were not so,and they nearly stretched their hands out against their teachers!” (SeferHayihud, p. 120)As heresy and denial of God was wrongly imputed to the kabbalists,both to the disciples and to their masters, Rabbi Asher ben David saw aneed to set things straight, even at the cost of violating the restrictions ofsecrecy. His words were apparently written in defense of Rabbi Isaac theBlind, whose great piety is described in the passage, as well as his stu-dents Rabbi Ezra and Rabbi Azriel. In spite of this, Rabbi Asher does notspare the rod from Rabbi Ezra and Rabbi Azriel. He describes the chainreaction in which he finds himself, which pushes, in an almost uncon-trolled manner, toward publication of the esoteric:For it may be that they brought this upon themselves, by not being suf-ficiently discreet before all persons in their language, whether in writ-ing or in speech. Even if their intentions were good, their lips stam-mered and their wisdom was shunned; for they have not the ability tospeak or write in a way that satiates the instructed, while satisfying theneeds of the fool, so that one not mislead the other with words thathave two faces, by making their words obscure in places where theyshould not have, or by explaining too much in places where they woulddo better to conceal their secrets. He who read their books or heardtheir words did not fathom their meaning and stumbled in their pur-poses, and imagined in their hearts that they believed in two divinerealms, and they became in their eyes apostates of the true religion,that they corporealize the Primum Mobile through skillful stratagems,and they plotted against them and spoke against them and said thatthey place hornets (intermediaries)4between themselves and their Cre-ator. (Sefer Hayihud, p. 120)The criticism of the kabbalists was engendered by disciples who scat-tered kabbalistic hints before everyone, both orally and in writing. Theseintimations, which were supposed to filter the reading public faced withesotericism—to draw those with understanding closer while repelling thefools—created erroneous understandings and confusion. They were insuf-ficient to dispel the doubts of the instructed, or to teach the uninstructedFrom Transmission to Writing•73"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"what the subject matter was, and they were better left entirely unsaid. Atthis point, Rabbi Asher ben David raised a profound argument concern-ing the essential nature of the medium of hinting. This medium, by na-ture, suffers from an internal problematic: if the hint is too transparent,it betrays its function as a medium of concealment. On the other hand, if itis too opaque, it does not add to the knowledge of the instructed one, orelse it leads to erroneous understandings and false explanations. The hintseems to be fundamentally invalid, and it was better not to hint in writ-ing at all. This incisive short passage points to the inherent self-defeatingattempt at proper calibration of the hint as a medium of esotericism, afeature that will haunt the esoteric project as a whole. Once matters havebeen made public, however, Rabbi Asher had no choice but to unveil theentire picture and to shatter the barriers of writing entirely: “Thus, I al-lowed my tongue to wag, and my lips to speak, to make the knowledgeof our masters known to the many, for they taught us the paths of life, theways of God, so that I may be innocent in the eyes of God and man”(Sefer Hayihud, p. 120).A deeper look at the letter of Rabbi Isaac the Blind and the words ofhis nephew Asher ben David reveals the marked and decisive change thattook place in the kabbalistic corpus over a period of only several decades—from the end of the twelfth century to the thirties of the thirteenth cen-tury, from the severe esotericism of the Ravad, who concealed the very factof his being an esotericist, to the systematic and exoteric exposition of es-oteric doctrine by his grandson, Rabbi Asher. Between these two poles,the turning point that effected this amazing change was the failed attemptat writing esoteric intimations by the disciples of Isaac the Blind. Althoughearlier, Rabbi Abraham ben Yitzhak, the author of Sefer Ha’eshkol, wascredited with kabbalistic writing, there we find only a listing of names ofsymbolic significance, which may be interpreted only by one who is privyto the secrets of the kabbalists.5To the outside observer, this work seemsmeaningless, a sort of agglomeration of meaningless names. Hinting, as opposed to this type of writing, is explicable; thus it is an unsuitablemedium, since intimations, by their very nature, may be falsely inter-preted, and a false interpretation on matters related to the esoteric is al-ways heretical. Following the hinting, there had to be further clarifica-tion, and consequently the barriers of secrecy were ruptured completely.Besides Rabbi Asher’s criticism of the worthy disciples who spoke andwrote improperly, and thus were misunderstood, Rabbi Asher, like hisuncle Isaac the Blind, also mentioned another group of Kabbalah schol-ars who committed the sin of heresy:And although those disciples served their masters properly, they causedthis (mishap) by their own superfluity. For they were not reticent in74•Chapter Nine"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"their words and expounded publicly. But some did not serve their mas-ters properly, and did not fill their bellies (with the revealed Torah) suf-ficiently; thus, they knew not God and did not discern His handiwork.They hastened and sought to quickly climb the ladder to the upper stories, yet they did not even attain the lower rungs of the ladder, andmany opened their mouths against them and mocked them. (SeferHayihud, p. 120)This argument raises another dimension of the dynamics of disclosure:the attempt to establish, through open dissemination, a kind of canonicaltext, which attempts to expulse from the camp deviations which mayarise as a result of the cloak of secrecy. The faithfulness of the esotericiststo the limitations of esotericism leaves the public arena open to thosewhom the kabbalists consider as charlatans, pretenders, and heretics.While the kabbalists are bound by the fetters of secrecy, those othersspeak in the name of the revealed mystery. As such phenomena appearprimarily in relatively peripheral areas such as Burgos, the aristocracy ofesotericists—in this case, a member of the family of the Ravad—mustcrush such phenomena by publishing a transparent, authoritative text ofesoteric doctrine that would fix its legitimate contents. Such a composi-tion is meant to create an orthodox corpus of the movement, which couldserve as an external, public standard for distinguishing between truth andheresy. The lack of such a work, as a consequence of the tight guardingof esotericism, facilitated the development of less restricted positions thatdared to speak in the name of esotericism and adopted the esotericists’authority. This resulted in slanders against the kabbalists. It is this tightguard around the esoteric that created a sharp change from complete si-lence to total exposure; consequently, over the course of two generations,the nature of kabbalistic transmission changed completely.Although Rabbi Asher emphasizes the revealed nature of his composi-tion,6he immediately retreats within a cloak of secrecy, in the fear thatsome may attribute other meanings to his work:For I beg and implore all the sages of the exile of Ariel, those instructedwith wisdom, that if they see in my book an error and misdoing . . .that they will point out to me my errors, and if I can, I shall fix them orsupport my words, or else erase them from my book. And if, God for-bid, their hearts be haughty so that they do not inform me and they opentheir mouths to accuse me, perhaps their limited understanding ledthem astray and they failed to discern their meaning in my words. . . .For the noble shepherds have warned us, saying that there are thingsthat may be transmitted orally which one may not commit to writing,as no man is permitted to explain all of them, or even some of them entirely; even if he devote his heart to explain and write, he will not beFrom Transmission to Writing•75"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"able to write them accurately or plumb the depths of their concealedsecrets. (Sefer Hayihud, p. 120)This passage ends with a proclamation returning us to the level of hint-ing. Rabbi Asher’s sudden return to secrecy is provoked by the fear thathis disclosure and explication may be misunderstood, and is not a resultof an intentional desire to conceal. After all, Rabbi Asher ben David wasof the opinion that the attempt at hinting and concealment in writing wasat the root of all the troubles. The esoteric cannot be completely revealed,even by those who desire to expose it; thus speech about it, even if trans-parent and direct, always bears the danger of misinterpretation. In hiswords: “Even if they devote their hearts to explain and write, they are notable to write precisely and to plumb the depths of their concealed secretsand not reveal them.” The ineffable, inexplicable nature of the mysterycasts doubts on the attempt to expose it and guard it from all error. As weknow, additional explication also opens new possibilities for the genera-tion of errors, especially when dealing with an area whose essence cannotbe spoken of. The ambivalence that resulted from the fear of revealingthe secrets led Rabbi Asher to cast doubts upon the role he attributed tohis very own text.76•Chapter Nine"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 10Open Knowledge and Closed Knowledge: The Kabbalists of Gerona—Rabbi Azriel and Rabbi Ya’akov bar SheshetThe works ofthe kabbalists of Gerona, all of them active at the first halfof the thirteenth century—Rabbi Ezra, Rabbi Azriel, and, subsequently,Rabbi Ya’akov bar Sheshet—induced the dramatic change in the meansof transmission of kabbalistic knowledge, as we discussed above. RabbiAsher ben David explained the change effected by these kabbalists as theproduct of an uncontrollable desire for publicity. A closer look at theirwords and their styles of writing, however, discloses their underlying positions with respect to the nature of kabbalistic knowledge, which re-sulted in these changes in the means of its transmission. A detailed exam-ination of the ways in which Rabbi Azriel and Rabbi Ya’akov bar Sheshettested the boundaries of esotericism exposes important patterns in thehistory of esotericism.One of the most exoteric writings of this circle is the Perush Eser Se-firot(Explanation of the Ten Sefirot) of Rabbi Azriel.1This compositiondeviates entirely from the norm in kabbalistic writing, as it contains noexegetical elements; rather, it is a systematic exposition, clearly philo-sophically Neoplatonic, of the nature of the sefirot. The lack of any ex-egetical element in the work is not merely a question of style of presenta-tion; it is an expression of a fundamental position. According to RabbiAzriel, the sefirotmay be deduced by reason alone, without reference tothe sacred scriptures. At the outset of his work, the sefirotare presentedas something that may be deduced by reason. Only subsequently does thediscussion turn to the examination of the evidence for this doctrine in theBible and in talmudic literature: “And if the inquirer continue to ask evenafter I have demonstrated to him by reasoning that these things are trueand clear, if I have any evidence from Scripture or from the words of ourSages of blessed memory . . .” (Perush Eser Sefirot, p. 4). The doctrine ofthesefirotis not presented as a secret tradition transmitted from Sinai oras the symbolic dictionary of the sacred scriptures. In this short composi-tion, it is derived from introspection into the complex relations betweenthe infinite and the finite. In general, the exegetical nature of kabbalistictexts, even the exoteric ones, hide and conceal the gap between contents"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"and language, as the kabbalist constantly employs the forest of symbolsoffered him by sacred scripture. In the Perush Eser Sefirotof Rabbi Azriel,the translation of a system of symbols into conceptual language creates arare and clear transparency. The act of disclosure is thus linked to thetransition from a symbolic language to a conceptual one; this transitionstems from the strictly Neoplatonic tendencies of Rabbi Azriel.The breaching of the restrictions of secrecy in Rabbi Azriel was ef-fected, among other means, through a new explanation of the traditionallimits of esotericism; this explanation would later be repeated in otherkabbalistic texts that sought to breach the barriers of secrecy. Accordingto Rabbi Azriel, the normative limits of secrecy in talmudic literature re-late to the essential hidden dimension in the godhead itself. That is, what-ever was forbidden to reveal became the realm that is impossible to re-veal. The traditional categories of the esoteric are no longer understoodas rules limiting what is permissible to say, but as rules reflecting the limitsof what can be said in words. In Rabbi Azriel’s understanding, there is anintimate relation between the limits of thought and the limits of speech:Know that the infinite cannot be contained in thought, much less inspeech. For even if it is intimated in (the words) that there is nothingoutside of Him, that is, that there is no sign or name or writing or thingthat may limit Him.. . . Thus it is written “unto you silence [is praise],”and our Sages explained that “the cure for all is silence,” and they saidthat “the fence of wisdom is silence,” and they said, “Do not expoundwhat is concealed from you and do not investigate what is hidden fromyou.” For it is written, “Is anything conveyed to Him when I speak?Can a man say anything that be not swallowed up?” which means thatif what has no end is contained in speech and narrative, even if he“swallows” it, by including one thing in another and one saying in an-other, can he capture it in words? (Perush Eser Sefirot, p. 4)The secrecy restrictions in Scripture and in talmudic literature aretaken in this passage to refer to the impossibility of conceptualizing andexpressing the infinite. According to Rabbi Azriel, these limitations donot refer to the realm that may not be spoken of, but the realm that cannotbe spoken of; thus he is free of all prohibitions of disclosure.Whatever can be said may be said, and whatever may neither be spokenof nor thought about may, in any case, be only referred to in intimations.2The diversion of the limits of secrecy to the ineffable dimension, inorder to free oneself from the obligation of concealment, is a model fre-quently suggested in exoteric writing on hidden matters. This conceptionappears in the writings of one of the kabbalists of the Gerona circle,Rabbi Ya’akov bar Sheshet. If, however, the context of disclosure in thewritings of Rabbi Azriel was the conceptual translation of kabbalistic78•Chapter Ten"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"teaching into Neoplatonic terms, in the writings of Rabbi Ya’akov barSheshet, the background for his disclosure is the concept that kabbalisticknowledge is knowledge open to all, subject to the same forms of inno-vation and argumentation as we might find in talmudic dialectics. Thecomposition parallel to Rabbi Azriel’s work in the writings of RabbiYa’akov bar Sheshet is the book Sha’ar Hashamayim (Gate to Heaven),an explanation of the Ten sefirot, one by one. Although the nature of thiswork is far less abstract and systematic than that of Rabbi Azriel, it tooserves as a kind of introduction to the Kabbalah. The aim of disseminat-ing kabbalistic matters beyond the circle of esotericists is mentioned atthe beginning of the composition:For the secret of the ten utterances shall be explained forever in truthand uprightness. I shall explain each matter according to my ability,and what I received, what I acquired through effort and reasoning, I added to and expanded; I shall not let the words of holiness be cut offfrom their hearers, so that the last generation of children that be bornmay know and tell it to their children, and I shall bring evidence fromthe Law of Moses and from the words of our rabbis that I know, andof that of the nations there be none with me. I shall not remove mywords from a mistaken person or a foolish one. And I shall include sev-eral other matters as you shall see, in conjunction with similar matters.And I shall explain some of the commandments and their principles,and I shall repair their torn fences, and I shall render accessible someof the sweet matters of truth, and rebuild its ruins, so that there mywords may enlighten those to whom I leave it. I shall open doors and break the locks and the gates shall no (longer) be closed. (Sha’arHashamayim, pp. 154–155)This passage, which precedes the detailed explanation of the system ofsefirot, is laden with metaphors and verbs of disclosure and opening. Therealm that Rabbi Ya’akov seeks to expose he describes as follows: “WhatI received, what I acquired through effort and reasoning, I added to andexpanded.” In his understanding, Kabbalah consists of two dimensionsof knowledge—that transmitted through the tradition of esotericism andthat which the kabbalist innovates through his deductions. Kabbalisticteaching is an open teaching, which may be added to and supports inno-vation. Later in his composition, Rabbi Ya’akov presents his words asknowledge of an open nature, which the reader may expand throughanalogies and reasoning, just as Torah scholars do with revealed matters:“I shall provide for each and every utterance some of the things that re-semble it, and that adjoin it. And the matters that are omitted will beavailable to all those who desire them, so that they may understand anddeduce from what there is to what there is not. Let your wellsprings flowOpen and Closed Knowledge•79"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"forth!” (Sha’ar Hashamayim, p. 155). The study of the Kabbalah is not aprocess of strict transmission of sealed, closed knowledge, but rather aprocess of discovery and innovation. The expanding nature of kabbalis-tic knowledge, which results from his learning process and gives rise tocreativity and innovation, also influences the extent of its dissemination.The relation between his conception of learning and the breadth of itsdissemination, which is based upon the ambiguity of the concept of dis-closure itself, is especially marked in Rabbi Ya’akov’s words: “May yourwellsprings flow forth.”3By means of this verse, Rabbi Ya’akov encour-ages his reader to expand his kabbalistic knowledge through innovative,creative learning while at the same time diffusing that knowledge.4Rabbi Ya’akov bar Sheshet’s approach to kabbalistic knowledge asopen knowledge is manifested in various places throughout his writings,and, as we stated, it profoundly influenced the question of esotericism. Inhis book Ha’emunah vehabitahon(Faith and Trust), he wrote as follows:“Know that the words of our Sages of blessed memory are the words ofthe living God and may not be contradicted, but it is a commandment forevery person to innovate in the Torah according to his ability” (KitveiHaRamban2:264). In the same composition he writes: “Let this not bedifficult in your eyes, for had I not innovated this of my own heart, I would have said that it was a law given to Moses on Mount Sinai”(Kitvei HaRamban 2:310). One of the most interesting expressions ofthis conception is that Rabbi Ya’akov bar Sheshet grants kabbalisticknowledge the qualities of variety and plurality, by translating the con-cept of disputation from the field of halakha to the theosophical ques-tions of esoteric teaching. Since some of the matters of the Kabbalah aredependent on the opinions of those who innovate them, they are open tothe same process of give and take that is widely accepted in questions oflegal reasoning.5Similarly, since kabbalistic knowledge is being updatedand expanded all the time, and is not sealed in the secret traditions ofthose who transmit what they have heard, the disputations that arise insuch matters are not necessarily the result of mishaps in transmission orthe expression of different traditions; rather, they are differences thatarise from the natural process of creation and the exegetical developmentof the Kabbalah. These differences of opinion may be accounted for bythe same understanding of plurality that accounts for differences in halakhic matters. In the words of Rabbi Ya’akov:Even if there be differences between explanations, neither should be re-jected. Perhaps one of them was chosen by Heaven, and we cannotknow which is correct, whether it be this one or that one, or if both arecorrect, for there are seventy facets to the Law. For they said explicitly:“Lest one say, because these prohibit and those permit, because these80•Chapter Ten"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"invalidate and those accept, because these render impure and those ren-der pure, how then should I learn the Law?” Thus: all were given by asingle shepherd, both these and those are the words of the living God,all were uttered by one God. (Kitvei HaRamban 2:445)6The presentation of kabbalistic knowledge as open knowledge towhich innovative interpretations of the Law are being added all the time,and which is characterized by disputations that depend on judgment andexegetical techniques, undermines the esoteric conception in the eyes oftheosophists. Esotericists seal the realm of knowledge they study, in partin conscious opposition to the way that revealed open knowledge circu-lates. Disclosure and dissemination necessarily engender plurality, differ-ences of opinion, and incessant addition of traits to the revealed core. Esotericists seek to isolate a closed, guarded realm of Torah from thischaos, a realm immune to the disorder of widespread knowledge. The in-novative analogy that Rabbi Ya’akov bar Sheshet draws between the tworealms—the theosophical and the halakhic—in fact undermines the basicmotivation of esotericism. Kabbalah, like other revealed halakhic mat-ters, is open knowledge, subject to innovation, plurality, and variety. Theesoteric is not a realm that must be guarded, but one that must be re-vealed and exposed, with the awareness of the ever-increasing plurality ofthe secret contents that are revealed.7The decisive turning point in the means of transmission of kabbalisticknowledge, which took place in the first half of the thirteenth century,was described by Rabbi Asher ben David as an unwanted chain reactionto a series of leaks, intimations, and forgeries that obliged the aristocracyof esotericists to create a canonical and revealed orthodoxy of the eso-teric. By contrast, in the writings of Rabbi Azriel and Rabbi Ya’akov barSheshet, the first creators of the written kabbalistic corpus, we find a new conception of the essence and nature of kabbalistic knowledge, andthe question of disclosure is formulated in a far broader context. RabbiAzriel translates the concepts of the doctrine of the sefirotinto the Neo-platonic world, whereas Rabbi Ya’akov bar Sheshet understands kabbal-istic knowledge as knowledge of an open nature, paralleling that found inthe Oral Law in general.8Moshe Idel has argued that Nahmanides wasopposed to the exoteric tendency of Rabbi Azriel and Rabbi Ya’akov barSheshet.9This view of Nahmanides, the greatest talmudic scholar of thethirteenth century and one of its most important kabbalists, as a counter-weight to the kabbalists of Gerona enables us to examine the question ofesotericism as a particular conception of the essence of knowledge. In-deed, Nahmanides’ attitude toward the esoteric posture of kabbalists de-serves special attention. Unlike Ezra and Azriel, who were known onlyfor their contributions to Kabbalah, Nahmanides’ authority and breadthOpen and Closed Knowledge•81"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"of achievements are of a far deeper and broader scope. Nahmanides(1195–1270) would still be considered the greatest Jewish scholar of thethirteenth century even if he had not dealt with Kabbalah at all. Hiswidely read commentary on the Torah is path-breaking in its originalityand subtlety. His teachings led to a flourishing talmudic school in Catalo-nia and inspired a generation of scholars. His halakhic stature was centralto the reception of Kabbalah as an authentic Jewish esoteric tradition,providing the shield of institutional rabbinic endorsement. By dispers-ing dozens of short esoteric kabbalistic hints in his popular commentaryon the Torah, he lent authority and prestige to the Kabbalah even for the vast majority of his readers who could not decipher a word of thesecoded hints. Thus any conception of Nahmanides as representing an op-posing view on esotericism must take into consideration his central rolein the history of Kabbalah.82•Chapter Ten"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 11Tradition, Closed Knowledge, and the Esoteric: Secrecy and Hinting in Nahmanides’ KabbalahIn the introductionto his commentary on the Penateuch, Nahmanidesspecifies his position with respect to the question of the esoteric nature ofthe Kabbalah:Now behold I bring into a faithful covenant and give proper counsel toall who look into this book not to reason or entertain any thought con-cerning any of the hints which I write regarding the hidden matters ofthe Torah, for I do hereby firmly make known to him [the reader] thatmy words will not be comprehended nor known at all by any reason-ing or contemplation, excepting from the mouth of a wise Kabbalistspeaking into the ear of an understanding recipient. Reasoning aboutthem is foolishness; any unrelated thought brings much damage andwithholds the benefit. “Let him not trust in vanity, deceiving himself,”for these reasonings will bring him nothing but evil as if they spokefalsely against God, which cannot be forgiven, as it is said, “The manthat strayeth out of understanding shall rest in the congregation of theshades.” . . . Let them take moral instruction from the mouths of ourholy Rabbis: “Into that which is beyond you, do not seek; into thatwhich is more powerful than you, do not inquire; about that which isconcealed from you, do not desire to know; about that which is hiddenfrom you, do not ask. Contemplate that which is permitted to you, andengage not yourself in hidden things.” (Chavel 1:15–16)Unlike Rabbi Ya’akov bar Sheshet’s conception of the nature of theKabbalah, Nahmanides presents the Kabbalah as a realm of closed knowl-edge.Whereas Rabbi Ya’akov bar Sheshet encourages the learner to de-duce one thing from another and to expand and innovate in the knowl-edge of Kabbalah, Nahmanides warns him not to make any attempt atdeduction or commentary based on the power of reasoning. For him, thecreation of kabbalistic teaching without the sanction of tradition leads tothe irreparable danger of heresy. In Nahmanides’ introduction, he repeat-edly emphasizes the nature of Kabbalah as tradition. The mysteries of theTorah were revealed to Moses on Mount Sinai: “God informed Mosesfirst of the manner of the creation of heaven and earth and all their hosts,that is, the creation of all things, high and low. Likewise, [He informed"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"him of] everything that had been said by prophecy concerning the secretsof the divine Chariot [in the vision of Ezekiel] and the process of Creation,and what has been transmitted about them to the Sages” (Chavel 1:9).Further on in his introduction, Nahmanides describes the possibility of adifferent reading of the Torah based on another division of the sequenceof letters, which will result in a continuous series of names of God. Ofsuch a radical reading of the sacred scriptures, he says that it was givenunto Moses: “It was given to Moses our teacher using the division ofwords which express the commandment, and orally it was transmitted tohim in the rendition which consists of the Divine Names” (Chavel 1:15).1The concept of the Kabbalah as an esoteric tradition transmitted fromgeneration to generation is in tension with another motif in Nahmanides’introduction to the Torah: the totalistic nature of the biblical text, a textthat contains everything and whose revealed level is only one interpretivepossibility, the tip of the iceberg of the entire text. In his words, “all of itwas written in the Torah, explicitly or by implication” (Chavel 1:9). Fur-ther on, he writes: “[All] was written in the Torah explicitly or by impli-cation in words, in the numerical value of the letters or in the form of theletters, that is, whether written normally or with some change in formsuch as bent or crooked letters and other deviations, or in the tips of theletters and their crownlets” (Chavel 1:10). The concept of the completesemantic fullness of the Torah seemingly enables an approach to the eso-teric which depends not on tradition, but on the use of an exegetical tech-nique. Nahmanides, however, blocks the infinite exegetical breadth whichwould result from his exegetical approach by determining that not onlyis the knowledge transmitted from generation to generation, but the ex-egetical hints are part of that tradition: “For these hints cannot be under-stood except from mouth to mouth [through an oral tradition which canbe traced] to Moses, who received it on Sinai” (Chavel 1:11).2Nahmanides is one of the important halakhic scholars who consciouslyformulated his conception of halakha as open knowledge, in which inno-vations arise through the power of reasoning. He was apparently the firstto call his work of halakhic exegesis hidushim(innovations).3Moreover,his approach to Torah innovations accords with his position with respectto the fundamental variety of halakhic knowledge and his understandingof disputation as the multifaceted nature of the text, whose meaning isdetermined by the Sages. This understanding of Nahmanides is opposedto other concepts in the history of halakha, from the schools of thegeonimand Maimonides, in its emphasis on the understanding of ha-lakhah as open knowledge.4The well-formulated concept of Nahmanideson the nature of talmudic disputations sharpens the contrast he createdbetween exoteric and esoteric knowledge. According to Nahmanides, un-like the approach of Rabbi Ya’akov bar Sheshet, the esoteric limitations84•Chapter Eleven"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"placed on the secrets of the Torah are linked organically to its nature asthe closed realm.5The distinction between tradition and reasoning dic-tated by Nahmanides also reflects a fundamental position invalidatingthe reliance on reason in all that concerns theosophy; it is also in sharpcontrast to the way that Rabbi Azriel presented the esoteric realm. Thesecrets of the godhead can only be known through tradition, and any at-tempt to discuss them through reasoning will result in heresy and destruc-tion. Thus, Nahmanides does not apply the esoteric instructions in talmu-dic literature with which he closes his introduction to the realm of theineffable, as the kabbalists of Gerona did. Instead, Nahmanides appliesthese instructions toward the free study of guarded knowledge that istransmitted through tradition. Let no man reveal the hints of Nahmanides,neither to himself and certainly not to others, if he does not possess a tra-dition orally transmitted from one Sage to another.The conception of the Kabbalah as a fixed tradition, into which no in-novations may be introduced, serves Nahmanides himself in situations inwhich he objects to alternative kabbalistic interpretations which are op-posed to his own traditions, as well as in places where he chooses to re-main silent, since he has no traditions from his rabbis to enlighten him inthe matter.6The concept of kabbalistic knowledge as closed knowledgedetermines Nahmanides’ strategy in writing hints. He writes of the se-crets of the Torah in hints, in order to make it difficult for the reader tomake inductions or even find an initial thread that would enable him toexpand the idea further. To the short, hermetic notes on esoteric mattersin Nahmanides, it is difficult to assign any interpretation whatsoever,even a misguided one. When viewed against the background of his atti-tude toward the Kabbalah, Nahmanides’ consistent stance as an esoteri-cist, as opposed to the tendency of his predecessors in Gerona, raises thefollowing question: If knowledge of the Kabbalah is entirely dependenton oral transmission from rabbi to disciple, and may not be derived fromhints, why should it be written down? Why does Nahmanides scatter somany enigmatic hints to esoteric doctrines in his commentaries on thePentateuch? In other words, why did Nahmanides not employ a more se-vere strategy, like that of the Ravad or Nahmanides’ relative, Rabbi YonahGirondi, who concealed the very fact that they possessed secrets, that is,that they were possessors of kabbalistic doctrine? After all, in spite ofNahmanides’ warnings not to systematically expand his words, or per-haps because of them, not a few writings were consecrated to the deci-phering of the secrets of Nahmanides. Any thinker who announces theexistence of a secret and hints at its content, notwithstanding the enig-matic nature of his sayings and the severe warnings he issues, inevitablytests the limits of secrecy. He wants to tell and not tell at the same time,even if he formulates his esoteric position in opposition to more blatantTradition and the Esoteric•85"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"attempts at disclosure of secrets. What were the limits of secrecy of thegreatest esotericist of the thirteenth century?At the beginning of his commentary on the Pentateuch, Nahmanidesdeals with the famous question quoted by Rashi: Why did the Torahbegin with Genesis and not with the first commandment given to the Is-raelites, “This month shall be unto you”? Nahmanides applies this ques-tion to the need for the inclusion of the creation narrative in the Penta-teuch. For Nahmanides, it is clear that this question cannot be directedtoward the very mention of the principle of creation in the Pentateuch,for without this principle the whole idea of revelation is undermined.Thus, Nahmanides is of the opinion that Rabbi Yitzhak’s question con-cerned the specification of the detailed account of creation in the Torah.He writes:The process of creation is a deep mystery not to be understood fromthe verses, and it cannot truly be known except through the traditiongoing back to Moses our teacher who received it from the mouth of theAlmighty, and those who know it are obliged to conceal it. It is for thisreason that Rabbi Yitzhak said that it was not necessary for the Torahto begin with the chapter of “In the beginning God created” and thenarration of what was created on the first day, what was done on thesecond and other days, as well as a prolonged account of the creationof Adam and Eve, their sin and punishment, and the story of the Gardenof Eden and the expulsion of Adam from it. (Genesis 1:1; Chavel 1:18)Nahmanides repeats his concept that the Kabbalah is closed knowl-edge,and claims that this position was meant to prevent the writing down,even in hints, of anything relating to Torah secrets. This dictum, however,is especially applicable to the hints about Torah secrets in Nahmanides’own commentary.A preliminary answer to the question of the limits of esotericism wasprovided by Nahmanides in his transgressions of his self-determined lim-its. The urge to reveal secrets in those cases is grounded in his disputewith other esoteric traditions—those of Maimonides and especially IbnEzra. Ibn Ezra was the first to integrate esoteric matters into a popularcommentary on the Pentateuch; in doing so, he sought to demarcate theesoteric realm and define the body of the instructed (maskilim). Through-out his commentary, Nahmanides conducts a complex and ambivalentdialogue with Ibn Ezra; consequently, he must propose an alternativefrom the esoteric realm, employing the same medium as Ibn Ezra—namely,a commentary on the Pentateuch.7Beyond the many exegetical questionsin which Nahmanides takes issue with Ibn Ezra, he also disputes IbnEzra’s positions on the dissemination of Torah secrets, on the intricaciesof the Torah, and on the definition of the composition and nature of the86•Chapter Eleven"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"religious aristocracy. This dispute is expressed, among other ways, throughNahmanides’ somewhat ironic employment of Ibn Ezra’s common formula“and the instructed (maskil) shall understand.” The instructed person re-ferred to by Nahmanides is not one versed in the hermetic-astrologicalcultural milieu, but one familiar with the kabbalistic traditions thatNahmanides transmits from his rabbis.The processes of disclosure related to the struggle over publication ofTorah secrets became most evident in two places that also deal with therelation of the instructed one (maskil) to the writings of the Sages. IbnEzra mockingly criticized Rashi’s tendency to integrate midrashic teach-ings in his commentary, especially if Ibn Ezra saw them as teachings of ahomlietic didactic nature and devoid of exegetical intentions: “For this isthe way of the Sages in the lands of the Greeks and the Edomites [Chris-tians], that they do not sufficiently weigh up matters, but trust in the wayof the midrash as good instruction and illumination. But since thesemidrashim are to be found in the ancient books, why should the laterscholars fatigue us by writing them over?” (introduction to the Penta-teuch; Weiser 1:7). Ibn Ezra brings an example from the midrashim quotedby Rashi on the first word of the Torah, Bereshit(In the beginning), as referring to the Torah, the fear of God, the first fruits, and more. Afterquoting Rashi’s words, Nahmanides refers to this group of midrashim:Rashi wrote: “This verse calls aloud for elucidation, as our Rabbishave explained it: ‘For the sake of the Torah which is called reshit, asit is said, “The Eternal made me as reshit(the beginning) of His way,”and for the sake of Israel who is called reshit, as it is said, “Israel is theEternal’s hallowed portion, the reshit(first fruits) of His increase.”This Midrash of our Rabbis is very hidden and secret, for there aremany things the Rabbis found that are called reshitand concerningwhich they give midrashic interpretations, and those wanting in faithcount their multitude. (Genesis 1:1; Chavel 1:20–21)As part of his dispute with Ibn Ezra, who Nahmanides refers to as“wanting in faith,” he turns to an exegesis of the esoteric dimension inthe explication of the word bereshit: “Their intent in the above texts is asfollows: the word bereshitalludes to the creation of the world by Ten Se-firot, and hints in particular to the emanation called Wisdom, in which isthe foundation of everything” (Genesis 1:1; Chavel 1:21). In a relativelylong passage on esoteric matters, Nahmanides continues to explain thesymbolic meaning of these teachings, some of which are directed towardthe emanation of Hokhmah(wisdom) and others toward the last of thesefirot, Shekhina. Both of them are of the dimension of reshit(beginning)—Hokhmahas the beginning of the world of the sefirotand the Shekhinaas the beginning of the universe. Nahmanides concludes the passage withTradition and the Esoteric•87"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"the following words: “Now it is impossible to discuss this explanation atlength in writing, and even a hint is dangerous since people might havethoughts concerning it which are untrue. But I have mentioned this in order to close the mouths of those wanting in faith and of little wis-dom, who scoff at the words of our Rabbis” (Genesis 1:1; Chavel 1:22).Nahmanides is forced to explain Torah secrets, he tells us, as a result ofhis dispute with Ibn Ezra.8The disclosure of a single Torah secret, evenby hinting, forces even strict esotericists of the opposing camp to revealmore than they would care to.Nahmanides’ apology for the traversing of the boundaries of secrecy asa result of this dispute brings the problematic nature of his position as anesotericist into sharp relief. Nahmanides is of the opinion that the secretsof the Torah cannot be deduced by reason, but must be received by tradi-tion. Thus, he is of the opinion that the transmission of hints is a com-pletely invalid form of transmission: “Great is the damage of the hint, formany will deduce ideas from them which are devoid of truth.” The essen-tial purpose of the hint is to invite the wise reader to arrive at conclusionsby his deductive capacities, relying on his faith in them. Consequently, anesotericist who understands the secrets of the Torah as closed knowledgemust choose between two possibilities. Either he may transmit the secretsof the Torah in their entirety, without resorting to hints (but the writingof such secrets in explicit form is undoubtedly forbidden); or else he mayremain completely silent. Providing oral hints is another possibility, asthe teacher may follow the process and see what conclusions are deducedby the disciple. But the writing of hints is problematic in either case. HadNahmanides shared the opinion of Rabbi Ya’akov bar Sheshet, that thestudent should be encouraged to complete the teaching through his ownlearning and innovate, he would undoubtedly agree that hinting was theproper medium for the transmission of knowledge. This, however, wasnot his way. Nahmanides maintained that whoever knew of Torah secretsfrom an instructed rabbi had no need of hints, whereas for those who didnot receive such a tradition, such hints were of no use, and perhaps evendamaging, since they invited the reader to deduce one thing from another.In his composition dedicated to matters of reward and punishment,Sha’ar Hagemul(The Gate of Retribution), Nahmanides claims that theresolution of the problem of evil is related to the secret of intercalation,of which he says: “But this is one of the secrets of the Torah which is hid-den from all but those who are worthy of receiving them through theKabbalah; it is prohibited to explain them in writing, and hints are useless”(Kitvei HaRamban2:279). Since the hint is an invalid means of transmis-sion of secrets, Nahmanides presents the reader with two possibilities:“But this doubt [the sufferings of the righteous] . . . [may be resolved]through the secret mentioned in the mystery of intercalation, if God be88•Chapter Eleven"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"favorable toward him so that he may know from the true Kabbalah, aftertaking guard from all stumbling blocks and errors, for there be not manywise. But if he has not heard of it, let him entrust the matter to those whoknow” (Kitvei HaRamban2:281). The reader is presented with two op-tions: either he has heard the secret through a trustworthy oral traditionor else he should rely upon those who know it. Hinting, as an intermedi-ate option, is ruled out in principle. Nahmanides is not only forced to reveal what should not be revealed, he must also use a means of trans-mission of Torah secrets that is opposed to his own principles: hinting.Nahmanides does not deny that the technique of hinting is based onthe instructed one’s (maskil’s) ability to supply the missing informationfrom his own knowledge. In his commentary on the Pentateuch, he di-rects the instructed to derive certain conclusions by means of repeatedformulae, such as “But if you will merit and understand the secret of thewordbereshitand why Scripture does not begin by saying, ‘God createdin the beginning,’ you will know that, in the way of truth, Scripture tellsabout the lower creations and alludes to the higher ones” (Genesis 1:3;Chavel 1:27). Elsewhere, he writes: “The truth is that the blessing on theSabbath day is the fountain of blessings and constitutes the foundation ofthe world. ‘And He sanctified it’ that it draw its sanctity from the Sanc-tuary on high. If you will understand this comment of mine you willgrasp what the Rabbis have said in Bereshit Rabbah concerning the Sab-bath: ‘[Why did He bless the Sabbath? It is] because it has no partner’and that which they have further related [that God said to the Sabbath]:‘The congregation of Israel will be thy partner.’ And then you will com-prehend that on the Sabbath there is truly an extra soul” (Genesis 2:3;Chavel 1:60). In his explanation on the sabbatical year and the jubilee,Nahmanides says: “Now here [in the Torat Kohanim mentioned above,the Rabbis] have roused our attention to one of the great secrets of theTorah.. . . Bend now your ear to understand that which I am permittedto inform you about it in the words that I will cause you to hear, and ifyou will be worthy you will contemplate them and understand them”(Leviticus 25:2; Chavel 4:415–416). Such guiding formulas are intendedonly for one who understands his own knowledge. They appear in many places in which Nahmanides mentions Torah secrets.9AlthoughNahmanides was obliged to write down his hints, he encouraged the in-structed one to complete the hint through his own wisdom and reason-ing, even in areas where reasoning is useless or even dangerous.Nahmanides minimizes the internal difficulty inherent in the act ofhinting through his particular use of the medium of hinting. While thehint is designed to increase the knowledge of the instructed, Nahmanidesformulates his hints in a manner so enigmatic that it requires an excep-tionally wide common background and knowledge. This, in turn, assuresTradition and the Esoteric•89"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"that any deductions made will be based on this common background. Forsomeone not completely familiar with these assumptions, the hint will re-main completely opaque, obviating any deduction whatsoever, even mis-taken ones. Indeed, without the voluminous literature explaining the se-crets of Nahmanides, composed by the school of the students of Rashba,which was based on oral traditions handed down from Nahmanides tohis students, it would be difficult to decipher Nahmanides’ hints. Thehint is formulated in a way that enables its understanding only on thebasis of a wide background and previous knowledge, which ensures thatthe deduction will be made in the appropriate direction. But beyond theenigmatic formulation of the hint, which filters out those who approachthe text in order to understand it of their own knowledge, the unique useof hints by Nahmanides enabled him to determine the direction of futuredeductions from it.In order to clarify the issue, we should distinguish between two direc-tions of hints, the horizontal and the vertical. The vertical hint designateshidden contents, which refer to the godhead itself. In this case, the secretof the verse is the reflection of the divine life, the relations between the se-firot, the order of their emanation and the complex, intricate balance be-tween them. From Scripture, man can learn what is in front and what isbehind, what is below and what is above. The horizontal hint, on theother hand, refers to the network of symbols themselves. The function ofthe hint is to thicken the significance of the symbol and to join distant ex-pressions or similar expressions from apparently different contexts into asingle unity. Nahmanides’ hints are usually of the horizontal sort, linkingtogether an entire network of expressions and symbols and giving them akabbalistic significance. A typical example of horizontal hinting may befound in Nahmanides’ commentary on the verse “and God blessed Abra-ham in all (bakol)” (Genesis 24:1). Nahmanides explains the relation be-tween the word koland the Shekhinaand then says: “And if you under-stand what I wrote, know that the saying of the cursed women who said‘since we ceased to offer incense to the queen of heaven we are lacking all(kol)’ and why the word was written without the letter alephand you willunderstand many enigmatic matters in the Pentateuch and the Scrip-tures” (Genesis 24:1). Nahmanides directs the instructed one’s attentionto an additional explanation of kolin Scripture, which is relevant to thesymbolic meaning of the expression kolin the blessing of Abraham. Thehint, in the words of Nahmanides, directs attention to “the enigmatic mat-ters in the Pentateuch and the Scriptures.” We may say that the functionof the system of sefirotin Nahmanides’ exegetical framework is to explainthe links between biblical meanings and not the other way around. Thehint directs the instructed one to delve into the depths of additional scrip-tural verses and midrashim, and thus to understand each through the other.90•Chapter Eleven"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"The horizontal nature of the majority of Nahmanides’ hints demonstratesthat the main thrust of his hinting is not theosophical but exegetical.Of course, Nahmanides was also aware of the vertical aspect of esotericism, or, as he says elsewhere, the tziyurand the mashal(bothterms synonymous with parables of symbols). A clear example of this ap-pears in his description of the Garden of Eden and the Tabernacle. In Nahmanides’ opinion, both reality in general and humans in particularhave an isomorphic structure, which reflects the system of sefirotand thesecret of the godhead. The Garden of Eden and the Tabernacle are, in hisopinion, spaces whose isomorphic-symbolic nature is more transparentlyclear, so that investigation of them enables a clearer and sharper view ofthe system of the godhead itself:For the Garden of Eden and the four rivers, the tree of life and the treeof wisdom which God planted there...all of these should be under-stood in their literal meaning, the words are faithful and true, and yetthey are a concealed secret, for they are like designs which enable us tounderstand a deep secret through a parable . . . for so is the sacred de-sign of the Tabernacle . . . and everything related to each and every po-sition of the vessels and the form of the cherubim, they all enable us tounderstand secrets of matters in the world above and in the intermedi-ate and lower worlds and all the hints referring to the chariot are there.(Kitvei HaRamban2:296)10Nahmanides himself, however, never reveals or directs his hints and secrets to the vertical dimension. Such references remain opaque and ob-scure: “for their secret is deep and reserved for those who receive thetransmitted faith” (Kitvei HaRamban2:297). Nahmanides does not pro-vide, even through hints, the map for the understanding of the system ofsefirotand the isomorphic structure of reality, as we find, for example, inRabbi Ya’akov bar Sheshet’s composition Sha’ar Hashamayim. Accordingto Nahmanides, such secrets are to be transmitted orally. The horizontal-exegetical nature of the hint in Nahmanides’ writings restricts the rangeof possible error. The instructed person who errs through improper use ofreason may risk falsely attributing kabbalistic significance to a difficultscriptural passage. He may, for example, interpret an instance of thewordkolin Scripture as part of the symbolic system of the Shekhina,even though, in that context, the word is void of any esoteric significance.By contrast, a mistake on the vertical level, which relates to the natureand qualities of the system of sefirot, is a flaw in the conception of the divinity, and has elements of denial and heresy. The enigmatic and hori-zontal nature of the hint is the way Nahmanides chose to deal with thedifficulties of esoteric hints, as part of his worldview that the Kabbalah isclosed knowledge.11Tradition and the Esoteric•91"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"In his writings, Nahmanides shaped his esoteric conception and themeans of its transmission of secrets in reaction to two different chal-lenges, which pull his esoteric molds in opposing directions. The firstchallenge, posed by the exoteric kabbalists of Gerona, resulted in thereestablishment of the limits of secrecy. Nahmanides’ position was an at-tempt to stand in the breach and essentially refute the previous positions,which viewed Kabbalah as open knowledge. In opposition to them, Nahmanides presented an entirely different approach, based on the con-ception of the Kabbalah as closed knowledge. On this front, Nahmanidessought to restore the barriers of esotericism that had been breached, asNahmanides recognized only one appropriate medium for the transmis-sion of the Kabbalah—oral transmission from a knowledgeable rabbi toan understanding disciple. On the other front, Nahmanides struggledwith Ibn Ezra, who, in his commentary on the Pentateuch, defined therealm of esotericism and the class of the instructed as a function of thecultural relation to hermetic and astrological traditions. Nahmanidessaw his commentary on the Pentateuch as a means of establishing abroad alternative to the world of Ibn Ezra, with which he was in constantdialogue. This alternative related, among other things, to the question ofwhich esoteric trend represents the hidden meaning of Torah, and howthe religious elite is defined. Ibn Ezra’s hints forced Nahmanides to re-veal, even if only through hints, things he would rather not have exposed.As a result of the tension between these two struggles, Nahmanidescreated his unique form of hinting.92•Chapter Eleven"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 12From Tradition to Literature: Shem Tov Ibn Gaonand the Critique of Kabbalistic LiteratureThe attempts ofNahmanides to restore the limits of secrecy, and sub-sequently the attempts of the Rashba (Shlomo ibn Adret), Namanides’great student and his heir as the main talmudic authority of Spanish Jewry,and the Rashba’s own students, do not reflect the state of esotericism inthe thirteenth century. The conception of the Kabbalah as a traditiongiven to Moses on Mount Sinai, which Nahmanides attempted to marshalin order to grant his kabbalistic position absolute authority, disintegratedwhen faced with alternative formulations of kabbalistic knowledge. Thewritings of the kabbalists of Castile, who were active in the mid-thirteenthcentury, are in part of a markedly exoteric nature. Isaac the Blind describedthe situation in Castile in extremely acerbic language: “For I have heardof the lands around you and of the people of the town of Burgos that theyspeak openly in the marketplaces and streets as frightened and confusedpeople.” It may be that his words were directed against the kabbalists oftheHug Ha’iyun, the most exoteric circle in the early Kabbalah.1Thiscircle has bequeathed us a large number of creative and daring pseudepi-graphic works, which neither display any unity of thought nor rely onany clear and recognized line of transmission. This obscure circle did notattempt to preserve a relation of familial tradition or careful transmissionfrom teacher to disciple; rather, these writings derive their authority froma mythical figure in whose name they speak and through which they attempt to break through the closed circle of tradition.Meir Ibn Sahula, a Castilean kabbalist of the thirteenth century, described his kabbalistic learning as acquired from books rather than authors.2According to his testimony, he was already in possession of asort of kabbalistic library of writings from Provence and Gerona, and hisknowledge was not based on a continuous oral transmission but on crit-ical synthesis of differing textual traditions. In his commentary on SeferYetzira, he writes:For several years already, I have been studying these things relating toall secrets, starting with the Sefer Habahir, which explains some mat-ters, and the writings of Rabbi Asher, who wrote the Perush ShloshEsreh Middot and the Perush Hashevu’ah, and Rabbi Ezra, Rabbi"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"Azariel, and Rabbi Moshe ben Nahman, all of blessed memory. Also, I studied those chapters. And I acquired some of the commentary onSefer Yetziraattributed to Rabbi Moshe bar Nahman of blessedmemory, but I was unable to acquire all of it. (MS Rome Angelika1/145, p. 2b)The existence of a kabbalistic library, whose items are enumerated byIbn Sahula, and which serve as the basis for his kabbalistic knowledge,teaches us about the rapid shift from oral tradition to an independent lit-erary corpus. Along with his understanding of the Kabbalah as a literarycorpus, Rabbi Meir promotes the value of independent inquiry, as hewrites at the opening of his commentary: “We must investigate the wordsaccording to our understanding, and walk in them in the paths walked bythe prophets in their generation and in the generations before us, duringthe two hundred years of kabbalists to date, and they call the wisdom of the ten sefirotand some of the reasons for the commandments Kab-balah” (Sefer Yetzira,p. 2b). Rabbi Meir relies on the historical traditionshe possesses relating to the kabbalistic tradition. Unlike Nahmanides,Rabbi Meir grounds the roots of this tradition not in Sinai, but in the pre-vious two hundred years of Kabbalah. The restriction of the scope of thetradition empowers the investigative position and his reliance on reason-ing.3Furthermore, later in his composition he undermines the conceptionof authority that Nahmanides claimed for his own kabbalistic position:“At each point, I shall mention the position of Nahmanides of blessedmemory, in his own name, and then try as best I can to contradict or sup-port it.” Ibn Sahula also presents an attitude toward esoteric questionsdifferent from that of Nahmanides. In the context of an exegetical argu-ment with Nahmanides over the issue of keteranden sof, he raises an ar-gument reminiscent of the words of Rabbi Asher against the writing ofhints: “It seems to me that he should not have revealed it here in this waybut through more expansive language and a lengthier introduction, thathe build a more sturdy fence so that others may not stumble over it, as it is written, ‘What is amazing to you, do not expound’ ” (Sefer Yetzira,p. 108b).The transformation of the Kabbalah into a literary corpus intensifiedin the last third of the thirteenth century through the writings of YosefGikatila, Moshe de Leon, and others. These kabbalists created a volumi-nous kabbalistic literature, whose epitome was the Zohar. The Zoharpresents a perfect alternative to the concept that the Kabbalah is closedknowledge. The esoteric conception of the Zoharis a broad issue, whichgoes beyond the frame of this work. Based on the works of YehudaLiebes and Elliot Wolfson, however, we may dwell on several points ofthis matter.4First, the Zohardescribes itself as an exegetical mystical94•Chapter Twelve"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"work, which embodies in its essence a process of disclosure and innova-tion.5Furthermore, not only do the boundaries of esotericism change intheZohar, but the very concept of esotericism acquires new meaning. In the Zohar, esotericism applies not only to a body of knowledge whichmay not be transmitted, but to a hidden dimension of the godhead—thesefiraofyesod, which is depicted as opposed to the revealed side of the godhead, the Shekhina. The sefiraofyesod, which is described in theZoharthrough phallic images, is a being that must remain hidden, and itsdisclosure is compared to exposure of nakedness. In the words of theZohar(1:236b): “And what is the highest secret of the Law? We shouldsay, it is the sign of the holy covenant [circumcision], which is called ‘thesecret of the Lord, the holy covenant.’ ” The erotic analogy between thedisclosure of the secret and the exposure of nakedness conceptualizes the esoteric as a realm which ought to remain hidden, not because disclo-sure can lead to severe mishaps, but because the very disclosure of thosesecrets is an act of desecration. The norms of concealment are linked toconcepts of shame and intimacy. The link between secrecy and eros cre-ated by the Zoharencompasses as well the urge to reveal, for the tensionbetween concealment and disclosure is contained within the godhead’sessential nature, as an overflowing and blessing entity. Disclosure andconcealment are two aspects of courtship and modesty, impulse andshame. As in sexuality, the person, the time, and the gesture make the dif-ference between pleasurable desire and terrible violation.6The link created by the Zoharbetween the disclosure of secrets and theexposure of nakedness makes esotericism a non-instrumental internal restriction. The instrumental esoteric conception prohibits disclosure, be-cause it may engender unwanted results, like heresy resulting from im-proper understanding, or harm befalling the esotericists. By contrast, theZohar’sapproach to the question of disclosure of secrets returns to themost fundamental conception of concealment, which sees the very fact ofdisclosure as an act of harm and desecration. A similar non-instrumentalconception exists in the Hekhalot literature in which the very act of disclo-sure entails desecration. In the Hekhalot literature, however, the conscious-ness of desecration inherent in divulgence of secrets is expressed througha political analogy. In this analogy, with its complicated bureaucraticstructure, inaccessibility and secrecy establish the conception of sublim-ity; thus inappropriate vision is an offense against the sovereign and hispower. The Zoharevokes another background as its non-instrumentalmodel for concealment—the erotic analogy. What these two conceptshave in common is that the esoteric is not the ineffable or knowledge thatmay not be diffused. In both cases, esotericism reflects a fundamental intuition linking exposure to desecration. This distinction between inter-nal and instrumental arguments for esotericism will be central to the From Tradition to Literature•95"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"phenomenological analysis as we proceed. For the time being it is impor-tant to draw the attention to the particular form of esoteric argumentpresented in the Zoharand the Hekhalot literature. The positing of creativ-ity as an essential element of the hermeneutic and mystical experienceand the reinterpretation of the concept of esotericism with internal tensionarising between concealment and disclosure are a defiant challenge to theconcept of Kabbalah as a closed corpus of knowledge.A critical, sharp, and perspicacious look at the process of transformationof the Kabbalah into a literary corpus in the thirteenth century, as well asone of the richest discussions of the question of esotericism I know, maybe found in the work Badei Ha’aronof Shem Tov Ibn Gaon. Shem TovIbn Gaon, one of the students of the Rashba and a distinguished followerof Nahmanides’ Kabbalah in the early fourteenth century,7sought to re-vive the concept of the Kabbalah as a primarily oral tradition and counterthe widespread transgressions of the limits of secrecy of the second halfof the thirteenth century. As a member of this circle, and as a proponentof the closed nature of kabbalistic knowledge, he attempted to found theauthority and power of Nahmanides’ Kabbalah on a continuous tradi-tion whose sources were at Sinai:For no sage can know of them through his own sagacity, and no wiseman may understand through his own wisdom, and no researcherthrough his research, and no expositor through his exposition; only thekabbalist may know based on the Kabbalah that he received, passeddown orally from one man to another, going back to the chain of thegreats of the renowned generation, who received it form their masters,and the fathers of their fathers, going back to Moses, may peace beupon him, who received it as Law from Sinai. And they are listed in myKeter Shem Tov, just as I received them from my masters, the greatRabbi Shlomo ben Rabbi Avraham ben Aderet, of blessed memory,and Rabbi Yitzhak ben Rabbi Todros, may his soul rest, who receivedit from the mouth of Rabbi Moshe ben Rabbi Nahman (Nahmanides)of blessed memory, and the pious Rabbi Isaac the Blind of blessedmemory, son of the great master, Rabbi Avraham ben Rabbi David, therighteous one of blessed memory, whose wisdom was known andwhose nature was exemplary. (Badei Ha’aron, p. 27)At the beginning of the fourteenth century, this tradition was in conflictwith the concept of the Kabbalah as literature. Shem Tov begins his dis-course with the following warning:For I have found something of which every man whom the spirit ofGod is within must take heed. This is the saying of our Sages, “ ‘fromthe mouths of authors and not from books”; lest he find books written96•Chapter Twelve"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"with this wisdom, for perhaps the whole of what he received is butchapter headings; then he may come to study such books and fall in thedeep pit as a result of the sweet words he finds there; for he may rejoicein them, or desire their secrets or the sweetness of the lofty language hefinds there. Bur perhaps their author has not received the Kabbalahproperly, passed down orally from one to another; he may only havebeen intelligent or skilled in poetry or and rhetoric . . . and have left thetrue path, as our Sages of blessed memory warned, “in the measure ofhis sharpness, so is his error.” Perhaps he also came across other booksthat the instructed kabbalists referred to merely in passing, and he doesnot know why or in what measure. (Badei Ha’aron, pp. 25–26)Shem Tov Ibn Gaon is aware that kabbalistic knowledge has becomeliterature and is no longer an oral tradition. Consequently, he emphasizesone of the essential distinctions between the transmission of closed knowl-edge and the rise of literature. The controlled transmission of chapterheadings avoids the use of rhetorical literary devices, because the tradi-tion derives its reliability from its spare and precise formulation. The cre-ative and rhetorical nature of kabbalistic literature, on the other hand,has an anti-traditional dimension. A text of poetic character is not merelya conduit for the transmission of traditions. Such a text establishes itselfas an object worthy of regard in its poetic dimensions, which are notstrictly means for transmission of knowledge. Consequently, from thepoint of view of the kabbalist, who sees the Kabbalah as closed knowl-edge, reliability and art are contradictory. It may very well be that ShemTov Ibn Gaon was warning his readers against the Zohar, which is theepitome of the development of the Kabbalah as literature, as its mar-velous literary qualities are powerfully seductive. Indeed, the tremendousdifference between the Kabbalah as literature and the Kabbalah as tradi-tion may be witnessed in the gap between the Zoharand Nahmanides’writings. Nahmanides’ writings are devoid of any literary quality. Theyhave no narrative frames or mythic characters, nor do they display com-plex weaves of midrashim and explanations, whereas in the Zoharwefind these elements in abundance. The seductive appeal of the literarykabbalistic works threaten its status as a precise tradition handed downby Moses on Mount Sinai; it is this threat that Shem Tov struggled with.Another element undermining the structure of closed knowledge is thepseudepigraphical nature of this literature. Shem Tov relates to this di-mension later on in his writings: “God forbid, for the earlier instructedones and the bearers of tradition have already proclaimed against this,saying that the wise man should not read any book unless he knows thename of its author. And this is just, for when he knows who its author is,he will understand its path and intention, [transmitted] from one man toFrom Tradition to Literature•97"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"another until the members of his generation. Thus, he may know if its author was a legitimate authority, and from whom he received it andwhether his wisdom is renowned” (Badei Ha’aron, p. 26). The pseudepi-graphic literature, like the writings of the Hug Ha’iyun, which was attrib-uted to the enigmatic image of Rabbi Hamai, claimed for itself the statusof independent canonical literature. The nature of its author, his place inthe kabbalistic tradition, and his reliability as a transmitter of oral tradi-tion all vanish in this type of literature. Consequently, Shem Tov Ibn Gaonwarns his readers against such literature. Later on in his writings, ShemTov contrasts the ways of his masters with those of the pseudepigraphicliterature: “For all of them [Shem Tov’s masters] were careful not to com-pose unattributed literature, writing only in their own names. Further-more, they never explained anything based on their own knowledge, unlessthey made public to all readers how they arrived at such knowledgethrough their own reasoning. They publicized their names in their worksso that all who come after them may know what guarded measure and inwhich paths light may be found” (Badei Ha’aron, p. 29). The transmissionof tradition entails the keeping of genealogies. The name of the authorand his place in the authoritative line of transmission is the source of hisstrength and the authority of his knowledge. Similarly, whoever writesdown the secrets of the Torah transmitted from Mount Sinai must care-fully distinguish between what was transmitted to him and what he saysof his own knowledge, as practiced by Shem Tov’s masters, according tohis testimony.As a consequence of his approach to the oral nature of Kabbalah, ShemTov Ibn Gaon came to see even the canonical works of the Kabbalah—Sefer Yetzira, Sefer Habahir, and Sefer Shi’ur Komah—as a function oforal transmission:And now I shall return to the warnings and reminders that I mentionedand say that in our day there are no well-known works of Kabbalahthat rest on firm foundation except for those I mentioned. In any case,if a person receive from the mouth of a well-known kabbalist the trans-mission of the Sefer Yetzira,Sefer Habahir, or the chapter ofShi’urKomah. . . these may serve as supplementary knowledge for him, andit is worthy for the instructed one to cleave unto them, to memorize theprinciples until the words and chapters he received from his master beetched upon the tablet of his heart with a pen of iron and lead, so thathe may not need any book, when he reads it in a chant or repeats it intune. (Badei Ha’aron, p. 32)The preceding canonical kabbalistic works, which risked becoming literature, derive their authority, according to Shem Tov, from the frame-work of oral tansmission: “if he receive them from the mouth of a 98•Chapter Twelve"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"well-known kabbalist.” Even after these works have been transmitted tothe disciple, Shem Tov places restrictions on their function as written lit-erature. The student must repeat the chapters and sayings and learn themby heart, through chanting and song.Aside from the essential distinctions that Shem Tov Ibn Gaon makesbetween the secrets of the Torah as tradition and as closed knowledge andthe secrets of the Torah as literature, he also describes the kinds of writingand esoteric transmission practiced in the esoteric tradition of Nahmanides.This testimony, written down in order to revive Nahmanides’ concept ofkabbalistic knowledge and restore its authority, is of exceptional quality.In one passage the Ravad and the Rashba are described as the strictest ofkabbalists in esoteric matters:My master, the Rashba of blessed memory, also composed a specialprayer for himself, in which he hinted at the correct chapter headings,and composed a commentary based on some of the sayings of the Talmud, which may be understood on an explicit level, and may serveto refute the claims of heretics; but he inserted in hints one or twowords which reveal some of the secrets to the ear of the kabbalist. Yethe did not explain all of them, nor did he hint at all of them, as thepious sages Rabbi Ezra and Rabbi Azariel of Gerona, of blessed mem-ory, had already done so earlier, in their compositions explaining thehaggadot. (Badei Ha’aron, p. 28)In the Rashba’s commentary on the haggadot, unlike those of RabbiEzra and Rabbi Azriel, except for rare places, there are no esoteric hints.Thus, the reader of the extant commentary on the haggadotof theRashba will find difficulty identifying him as an esotericist. The Rashba’sstyle of writing contains a concealed criticism of the exegetical path chosenby Rabbi Ezra and Rabbi Azriel in their commentaries on the haggadot.Those commentaries were designed to explain the esoteric level of the ag-gadah. The Rashba advocated restricting, rather than expanding thosecommentaries. Shem Tov describes the path taken by the Ravad in termsclose to the strict approach of the Rashba: “And the Ravad, of blessedmemory, provided hints only at places where he saw it absolutely neces-sary and no more, and he had enough in what his son the master [Isaacthe Blind] revealed, as he was known for this wisdom which he receivedfrom [the Ravad’s] mouth” (Badei Ha’aron, p. 28). In contrast to theRavad and the Rashba, the path of Nahmanides was seen as more gener-ous and methodical in its providing of enigmatic hints:The great master Rabbi Moses ben Nahman of blessed memory alsowrote his book and his commentary on Job, and in each and everyplace hinted at hidden things, in order to properly awaken the reader,From Tradition to Literature•99"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"based on what he had received. Nevertheless, he made his words veryenigmatic, for it is written, “Honey and milk are under your tongue,”etc.. . . He also commented only on the first chapter of Sefer Yetzira,for he received no more from other kabbalists. But the great piousRabbi Isaac the Blind of blessed memory explained it in its entirety, ashe received it. (Badei Ha’aron, p. 29)Nahmanides hinted everywhere at what he received, but his words areenigmatic and his commentary on Sefer Yetziracovers only the sectionfor which he had received an esoteric tradition.In his description of a no longer extant kabbalistic text—which, according to Shem Tov, was composed by Rabbi Avraham ben Yitzhak,the Ravad’s father-in-law—Shem Tov describes a style of writing differ-ent from the enigmatic hints of Nahmanides or the almost total silence ofthe Rashba and the Ravad: “For Rabbi Avraham, Head of the Court, ofblessed memory, wrote down chapter headings alone. And I saw thempublicizing wonderful words to awaken all kabbalists; wherever they mayfind a word of them in Scripture, it may awaken them” (Badei Ha’aron,p. 29). This minimalistic text, which Shem Tov viewed as the pole dia-metrically opposed to kabbalistic “literature,” is made up of a mere listof words and lacks all rhetoric or poetic dimension. This list contains nohint, reference, or instruction, and is nothing more than a set of reminders,in Shem Tov’s words “mere chapter headings.” This may be the primaryand pure form of the transmission of chapter headings—a list of keywords. In the esoteric tradition described by Shem Tov, we find a complexvariety of approaches to the hidden. But what all the works to whichShem Tov is faithful have in common is the assumption that writing inhints is a conduit for transmission of secret traditions, and not an attemptat creating a kabbalistic literature.In addition to the description of the different levels of esoteric writing,Shem Tov also documented the process of oral transmission, as it took placein the academies of his masters, the Rashba and Rabbi Yitzhak ben Todros:And I saw some of the students who received some of the esoteric mat-ters and began with the chapter headings, received from the mouths ofour masters, may their souls repose. But they were not diligent in theirstudies as befit their capacities, and left the eternal life to repose in theways of the world, so that my masters regretted what they had trans-mitted to them, and did not add to their teaching. When they transmit-ted [this knowledge] to me, they did so on condition that I not transmitit to others except under three conditions that must be fulfilled by any-one who comes to receive matters of the initiates: the first is that he bea talmudic scholar, the second that he be forty years old or more, andthe third that he be pious and humble in spirit. (Badei Ha’aron, p. 30)100•Chapter Twelve"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"The expression “to receive the matters of haverut(membership)” is atechnical term for initiation. In the passage above, one such process ofinitiation is described. A great deal can be learned from this passage,specifically because it describes a case in which the process failed. Ac-cording to this rare description, oral transmission is not the organized,systematic transmission of Torah secrets. As in written transmission, itwas also done through hints and a little at a time. The student receivedthe chapter headings and his masters examined how he developed andunderstood them on his own; only when he was found worthy did theyexpand the range of hints and transmit additional chapter headings andso on. This method of transmission provides the masters with long-termcontrol over the learning process, and enables the process to be halted atvarious points. Furthermore, this method attempts to put into practicethe conditions prescribed in the Mishna for entry into esotericism,namely, that the student must be wise and understand his own knowl-edge. According to this condition, one who is worthy of secrets alreadyknows them on his own—that is, the previous knowledge of the Torah secrets transmitted to the student is what prepares him to be worthy ofreceiving them.The paradoxical sense of this mishnaic condition is further reinforcedby the text of the more reliable Mishna manuscripts. In the Kaufmannand Parma manuscripts the text reads hakham vehevin mida’ato (“wiseand understood of his own knowledge”). The reading mevin mida’ato(“wise and understands of his own knowledge”) refers to the student’scapabilities, whereas the reading vehevin mida’atois a statement of fact.One may only transmit to one who knows the secret on his own, who al-ready understood of his own knowledge. The transmission of the secretthus becomes a problem, for if the student fulfilled the conditions for ini-tiation and understood of his own knowledge there is no need to instructhim, whereas if he does not understand of his own knowledge, he is un-worthy of receiving the secret. The transmission through hinting, which isgradually amplified in accordance with the student’s own progress, re-flects the circular nature of the condition. Consequently, even teaching toselected individuals through oral transmission must be based on hints, bymeans of which the student can prove that he knows the matters of hisown knowledge and capacities. The circular conditions of entry are theprofoundest expression of the elitism of the esoteric. One may not join theesoteric circle, as it is based on a tautology—whoever knows the secret isworthy of receiving it. Esotericism thus entails a strong sense of privacy:only those who already understand me can understand me.It is striking how prevalent such a circularity of initiation exists in a variety of esoteric modes; among other texts this condition is mentionedin the primary philosophical credo of esotericism, Plato’s Seventh Letter.From Tradition to Literature•101"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"I found such an esoteric declaration in a text much later than the Mishna,namely, Wittgenstein’s Tractatus. In the first sentence of the introductionof this elusive, esoteric, and intriguing text, Wittgenstein states: “Perhapsthis book will be understood only by someone who has himself alreadyhad the thoughts that are expressed in it, or at least similar thoughts; soit is not a text book its purpose will be achieved if it gave pleasure to oneperson who read and understood it.” If having Wittgenstein’s thoughts isa condition for understanding him, what is the point of writing? Thosewho do not have his thoughts will not understand him in any event, andthose who have them through their own reasoning do not need Wittgen-stein to enlighten them. (And how would someone know that he had theright thoughts, if the text does not independently direct the reader tothem?) Wittgenstein comes up with an interesting answer to the problemof writing within this circular condition. He wrote his book for the sakeof the pleasure of the one initiate, who will be redeemed out of his soli-tude by meeting another member of the elect group, a philosophical soulmate. Such a mode of esotericism is echoed as well in people with an ex-treme sense of privacy. When it comes to self-disclosure they claim thatonly those who already understand me are worthy of my revelation, or in a more extreme fashion only those who already know are capable ofknowing what I think or feel. And yet if they already understand, there isno need for me to tell them. Since the person who is worthy of the secretis the one who already understood it, hinting is a way of identifying theone who is already a member of the elect group, rather than a form of indirect disclosure. Under the strict circular condition for entry to the esoteric circle the procedure of initiation blurs the distinction betweenteaching and identifying.There is something else we may learn from Shem Tov’s testimony onthe initiation proceedings. The hinted and gradual transmission of knowl-edge was accompanied by a commitment on the part of the student to ac-cept the restrictions on further transmission of that knowledge.8ShemTov describes this commitment as an integral part of the process of trans-mission: “When they transmitted [this knowledge] to me, they did so oncondition that I not transmit it to others except under three conditions,to anyone who comes to receive the matters of the initiates: the first isthat he be a talmudic scholar, the second that he be forty years old or more,and the third that he be pious and humble in spirit” (Badei Ha’aron,p. 30). This passage is one of the first mentions of the restriction of trans-mission to those under forty; if indeed this was practiced in the school ofthe Rashba, it designates a severely restrictive tendency in instruction.9An additional restriction mentioned by Shem Tov, “that he be a talmu-dic scholar,” was designed to create a situation in which the realm ofclosed knowledge would remain the sole property of the Torah scholars.102•Chapter Twelve"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"This restriction had institutional and social significance that far surpassedthe question of the student’s aptitude for receiving Torah secrets. Esotericteachings might pose a threat to authority structures and halakhic frame-works, because they present themselves as the inner meaning of religion.The attempt to restrict the Kabbalah to traditions transmitted amongstTorah scholars is a means of preventing its becoming a body of knowledgeand authority that could compete with the halakhic world. This restric-tion creates an identity between the esotericists and the Torah scholars,so that the threatening force of esotericism might be harnessed to increasethe power of the Torah sages. Esotericism thus draws its authority fromits transmission through the institutional frameworks of the halakhic mas-ters and receives legitimacy, as an integral part of the tradition, becausethe halakhic masters take it under their auspices. Undoubtedly, strict es-oteric concepts of the Kabbalah were common among halakhic masters,as claimed by Moshe Idel.10The personalities whose esoteric practiceswere described by Shem Tov were outstanding halakhic scholars: RabbiAvraham, head of the Rabbinical Court, the Ravad, Nahmanides, theRashba, Rabbi Yitzhak ben Todros; to this list we may add Rabbi YonahGirondi. By contrast, Rabbi Ezra, Rabbi Azriel, and the kabbalists ofCastile, who slackened the reins of esotericism, did not belong to the rab-binical elite.Shem Tov’s composition touches directly on the relation between thehalakhic scholars and esotericism. Shem Tov usually avoids mentioningthe names of the kabbalists and compositions that are the targets of hiscriticism. Aside from the kabbalists of Provence and Gerona, on whomShem Tov bases what he considers the proper tradition, the only onesmentioned among the kabbalists of Castile are the Cohen brothers andRabbi Moshe of Burgos:For I have heard it said, two seeds at the summit of a tall tree, that theymade themselves stronger than rock and emery, to receive from themouths of holy ones, the heads of the academies, and the seed of greatmen; they moved their legs and toiled all their days and nights to fas-tidiously study their chapters. Verily, they are the sages, the piousbrothers Rabbi Yitzhak and Rabbi Ya’akov Cohen, the sons of RabbiYa’akov Hacohen of blessed memory, whose birthplace is the town ofSuraya, which is also my birthplace, for their family is related to mine.They died without leaving male issue, and they left their riches and thegreatness of their wisdom in the hands of their student the sage RabbiMoshe of blessed memory, the son of Shim’on from the town of Bur-gos. But because they were not of my time, and I did not walk in theirpath, I avoided speaking of them; I only knew their aforementionedstudent, whom I met in the days of my youth, and I saw that it was aFrom Tradition to Literature•103"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"straight and suitable way that he chose for himself, for he was piousand humble and decent in all his ways. But as I did not test his wisdom,I have remained silent and avoided following his way as one who shel-ters me in his tent. I only know that they were not great teachers of theTalmud, which is the pillar of learning of what is above and below andfor the four winds of the world in its length and breadth, for the truthshall be taught through its ways. (Badei Ha’aron, p. 33)Although the Cohen brothers and Rabbi Moshe of Burgos are notlinked directly to the chain of tradition of the Kabbalah of Nahmanides,as constructed by Shem Tov, his evaluation of their trustworthiness isquite restrained. The Cohen brothers are described as bearers of traditionthat they learned from holy ones, while their disciple, Rabbi Moshe ofBurgos, with whom he was well acquainted in his youth, is described asa man of stature. The Kabbalah of the Cohen brothers and Rabbi Mosheof Burgos is indeed of an esoteric character in comparison with the HugHa’iyunand the kabbalists of Castile who followed them. In the writingsof the Cohen brothers, and especially in the case of Rabbi Moshe of Burgos, who transmit traditions from the school of Nahmanides, theKabbalah is perceived as closed knowledge.11In spite of this, Shem Tovrefused to include them in the kabbalistic canon he created because theywere not halakhic scholars: “I only know this, that they were not greatteachers of the Talmud.”12The esotericists of Nahmanides’ circle derivetheir credibility and authority from their being talmudic scholars. Therabbinical elite attempts to keep the esoteric tradition within its own do-main, so that it not becomes a competing institution of authority and in-spiration.13Shem Tov Ibn Gaon presents us with a polemical picture, fulland rare, of an esoteric tradition that has lost its power. He describes thefeatures of this tradition, drawing a profound distinction between tradi-tion and literature, by providing a sharp and vivid description of the eso-teric practices of writing and of oral transmission.104•Chapter Twelve"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 13“The Widening of the Apertures of the Showpiece”:Shmuel Ibn Tibon and the End of the Era of EsotericismThe tension betweenconcealment and disclosure in the kabbalistic tradition of the thirteenth century, the process of erosion of the bound-aries of secrecy and the attempt to re-erect them later on in that century,find a parallel in a similar process within the Maimonidean tradition inthat century. The height of this process is the dispute over the teaching ofphilosophy in the early fourteenth century, in which the question of thestatus of philosophy as an esoteric realm of knowledge broke forth in fullforce. The great change in the molds of esoteric writing in the philosoph-ical tradition took place at the beginning of the thirteenth century, in thewritings of Shmuel Ibn Tibon. Shmuel Ibn Tibon, born in Lunel in themiddle of the twelfth century, belonged to a great family of translatorsand philosophers who emigrated from Andalusia and settled in Provence.This line of translators and scholars, which started with Shmuel’s father,Yehuda ibn Tibon, had an immense role in spreading Arabic philosophyand science to the west and in transmitting Jewish Arabic culture to theJewish communities across the Pyrenees. As an agent of cultural transfor-mation and change, Shmuel is known to us mainly as the first translatorofGuide of the Perplexedfrom Arabic to Hebrew. His fragile and complexstatus as a descendent of Andalusian culture planted in a foreign milieuin Provence, as well as his daring in promoting the Andalusian ethos inthe most exoteric fashion, situated him in the middle of the culture clashbetween the philosophers and their opponents in the thirteenth century.Among other concerns, his position on esotericism was a major compo-nent in his influential role in medieval Jewish culture. He played a centralrole in the history of the esoteric idea, in philosophy and in Kabbalah,both through the way that he tested the boundaries of the esoteric, aswell as through his immediate influence on the writing of the secret. In histwo compositions, Perush Lekohelet (Commentary on Ecclesiastes) andMa’amar Yikavu Hamayim (Treatise on the Gathering of the Waters), es-oteric matters are revealed at length and with a clarity that is unprece-dented. Ibn Tibon himself was aware that he was initiating a revolutionin the history of esotericism; thus, he consecrated the last chapter of"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"Ma’amar Yikavu Hamayim to “apologize for having revealed too muchof the matters which our sages, of blessed memory, commanded be con-cealed” (173). His commentary on Ecclesiastes contains many mattersdealing with Torah secrets. It is also written in overt and clear language.This commentary contains, among other things, introductions to Aris-totelian epistemology and to the question of the immortality of the soulin Arabic philosophy. If the way of the esotericists was to abridge mattersand to disperse their hints in chapter headings, Shmuel Ibn Tibon said ofhimself, than he tended to expound at length:For the reason why each commentator attempts to abridge his wordsin his commentary—that is, so that the teacher or the student shall notlose too much time from his reading because of the lengthiness of hiswords—does not apply to my commentary here. For I did not write itto interest students or instructors of children, but only for those whopreviously have learned and known the great treatise, the treatise ofGuide of the Perplexed, and has scented some of the wisdoms and de-sires to know the words of the parables of the prophets and the sagesand their riddles. . . . Similarly, if one wishes to know the matter of aparticular verse in this book, he will undoubtedly rejoice if he finds init an extensive explanation, and his spirit will not become impatient atits length; perhaps in several places of [the commentary], he will say, ifonly the explanations were still longer and broader than this! (PerushLekohelet11b)Ibn Tibon’s exoteric tendencies in his philosophical works are, obvi-ously, inseparable from his central role as translator of the Judeo-Arabiccorpus into Hebrew. The language barrier is the first and most blatantobstacle in approaching a text, so that translation is an act of enlarge-ment and exposure. Ibn Tibon’s translations to Guide of the Perplexedand various parts of the Arabic commentary to Aristotle are part of awider cultural move, in which Andalusian Jewish culture was transferredto Christian Spain, especially to Provence. Like Maimonides, Shmuel IbnTibon justified the revolution he initiated in the disclosure of Torah secretsby sketching the history of esotericism in Jewish tradition. But, whileMaimonides places himself at a crisis, a breaking point in history, IbnTibon paints the history of disclosure of Torah secrets in Jewish traditionas a continuous process of revelation of mysteries, which reached its pinna-cle in his day and age. This continuous process, which finally emptied theconcept of esotericism of all its content, is described in Ma’amar YikavuHamayim, and at greater length in his commentary on the book of Eccle-siastes. I examine in detail a passage in his commentary on Ecclesiastes,which is based on the exegesis of the verses “The fruit of the righteous isa tree of life” (Proverbs 11:30) and “The labor of righteous man makes106•Chapter Thirteen"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"for life” (Proverbs 10:16). Ibn Tibon explains that the word “fruit” refersto oral transmission, whereas the word “labor” (peulot) refers to writing.In this section, which deals with the history of secrecy, Ibn Tibon openswith an interesting distinction between oral tradition and writing, whichserves as part of the backdrop for the claim that the origin of esoterictransmission is oral teaching:For the great benefit that derives from them [the Sages] is in his tongue[and not in his books]; this was especially true in those days and in ournation. For this wisdom, which, it is hinted, is life, no one of our nationwas allowed to expound in public; rather, he would transmit chapterheadings to those who understood and were worthy of receiving it in away that would enable them to understand the entire matter based onthe first hints. This may be done in person, face to face, mouth to mouth.There the wise teacher may employ many ruses and tricks and permu-tations of words, in order that the right students understand their in-tention, even if he does not explain and make it explicit—which can-not be done through writing in a book. It is like a man who tells hisfellow that he did well when he did a particular thing, and yet the hearermay understand that indeed the speaker thought badly of it, for he dis-cerns this not from the thing said in itself, for what was meant was theopposite of what was said to him. But the listener may understand themeaning from other occurrences that accompany those words, whetherit be through the facial appearance of the speaker, whose face may red-den or turn green as one angered, or perhaps through his voice, that is,that it may not have been said pleasantly, as a man speaks when hemeans exactly what he says....All this is extremely difficult to do ina book, as some of the meanings transmitted through the facial appear-ance and the qualities of voice are obscured. (Perush Lekohelet9a)Already in the introduction, which formulates the restrictions on pub-lic exposition in the past tense, certain questions are raised: “No man inour nation was permitted to expound it”; that is, in Ibn Tibon’s time, thereins were slackened. At that stage, however, Ibn Tibon does not yet re-veal the significance of his use of the past tense in referring to the restric-tions of secrecy. He determines that oral transmission is preferable towriting, for in conversation the significance of what is said is understoodin accordance with gestures and vocal inflections, which accompany thespoken words. Writing is a kind of freezing of the spoken word. Theword loses the subtleties of meaning of ironic or bitter speech, because itis bereft of the living link of gesture or tonal expression.Later on in the passage, Ibn Tibon repeats Maimonides’ argument, thatthe paucity of writing on matters of wisdom is related to another advan-tage of oral transmission over writing. According to Maimonides, theThe End of Esotericism•107"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"written text may be interpreted in different directions and enshrines a sit-uation of dispute, in contrast to the oral tradition, which is preserved ina state of purity. In spite of all this, Ibn Tibon determines: “Nevertheless,all those who felt empowered to do so did not hesitate to transmit chapterheadings in writing without revealing secrets to write and compile inmatters of wisdom what the wise would understand from their reading”(Perush Lekohelet9a).At this point, Ibn Tibon begins to describe the history of hinting:Our master Moses, may peace be upon him, was the founder of whatwe have found. For he employed the two channels we mentioned [speechand writing]. For all his predecessors among the prophets and sages,and Shem and Ever, [among them] we never find that they composed abook. Rather, they would teach and expound face to face until the master of prophets came and composed, by the will of God, a book, andexplained in it what ought to be explained and transmitted in chapterheadings whatever was not fit to be revealed before all....Thus hetaught to his people, by the command of God and by speaking mouthto mouth, the commandments, ordinances and laws, and wisdom anddeep sciences” (Perush Lekohelet9a).Moses was not the first source of wisdom, for it existed as oral traditionamong the sages of old, like Shem and Ever. Moses was, however, the firstto write down chapter headings of the secrets of the Torah, alongside theoral tradition that he continued to transmit. Following Moses, Ibn Tibonmentions David, who further developed the hints of Moses in the Psalms;Solomon, whose books the Song of Songs, Proverbs, and Ecclesiastes dealwith the secrets of the Torah; Isaiah, who describes the chariot; Ezekiel,who expands the description of the chariot mentioned in Isaiah; the Sagesof the Mishna and the Talmud, who scattered hints of the secrets of theTorah in their midrashim. At the end of the chain of esotericism, Ibn Tibonplaces Maimonides, describing him in terms of a dramatic revelation inthe history of esotericism.In this construction of the history of esotericism, Ibn Tibon skips overthe entire tradition of thought and mysticism from the Talmud until Mai-monides. This lapse accords with Maimonides’ self-understanding, whosaw his project as a unique moment in the history of esotericism, whichhad no immediate precedent. The corpus that Maimonides related to isnot the Jewish philosophy that preceded it, but rather to the canonicaltexts of Jewish tradition—Scripture, the Mishna, and the Talmud. IbnTibon characterized Maimonides’ project in writing secrets with the fol-lowing metaphor: “He widened the apertures of the showpiece.” Thismetaphor is based in the verse that Maimonides, in his introduction toGuide of the Perplexed, sees as the embodiment of the teaching through108•Chapter Thirteen"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"parables: “Like golden apples in silver showpieces is a phrase well turned”(Proverbs 25:11). The inner, hidden kernel of the parable is the goldenapple, which is kept in a lattice of silver. This lattice represents both therevealed meaning of the proverb, which has intrinsic value, and the factthat through its narrow apertures one may recognize the inner content ofthe secret. According to Ibn Tibon, each and every historical stage of theesoteric is an additional widening of the apertures of the lattice:And I would like to say that [Maimonides] provided an explanationthrough hints and his ordering of things and separation of items, sothat he widened the apertures of the showpiece that enclosed the hid-den things that Moses, may peace be upon him, wrote about such mat-ters, in addition to what Solomon, may peace be upon him, and theSages already widened, so that one who was not aware of them mightnow recognize them thanks to those additions. . . . Thus [Maimonides]followed the path in which the wise Solomon trod through hisproverbs and the other things found in his books, for he continued toprovide explanations for the secrets he found in the Torah and in itsconcealed parts, for he saw that those who understood had dimin-ished.. . . And that wise man of blessed memory, when he saw that thewidening of the apertures of the showpiece enclosing the secrets of theTorah by Solomon, of blessed memory, was insufficient, and the widen-ing of the Sages, of blessed memory, was insufficient for the limitedwisdom and insufficient effort in attainment of wisdom of the peopleof our generation, he added explanation upon explanation andwidened them further. (Perush Lekohelet10b)1Ibn Tibon, in his commentary on Ecclesiastes and in Ma’amar YikavuHamayim, applied the exegetical principle that the parables and hints inthe biblical text become progressively more transparent. The words ofSolomon in Ecclesiastes facilitate a clearer understanding of the words of Moses, and the Psalms dealing with creation are the key to under-standing the creation narrative in Genesis, as described in Ma’amarYikavu Hamayim. Ibn Tibon describes Solomon’s project relating toTorah secrets as follows: “Thus [Solomon] did in the deepest matters: heapplied them to other simpler matters, so that they could be understoodby those who could not understand [those other matters]. Thus, allSolomon’s efforts were directed to widening the apertures of the show-piece covering the golden apple until the wise man could see what was in-side it” (Perush Lekohelet151b). Ibn Tibon, who focused on the Psalmsand Ecclesiastes as the key to the narrative of creation, wove an intricatenetwork of hints and parables, which explain earlier, more opaque hintsand parables. In doing so, Shmuel Ibn Tibon employed the formula ofThe End of Esotericism•109"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"“widening the apertures of the showpiece” several times—that is, that eso-tericPentateuchal expressions become clearer in Psalms and Ecclesiastes.2In his comments on the verse “a time for silence and a time for speak-ing” (Ecclesiastes 3:7), Ibn Tibon explains the factor that facilitates thegradual process of the “widening the apertures of the showpiece,” evencontrary to the way of the Torah and the prohibitions of the Sages. Heplaces his conception in the mouth of Solomon, who apologizes for re-vealing the secrets of the Torah pertaining to the act of creation. In thecreation narrative in the Torah, God alone is mentioned as involved inthe creation. In the opinion of Ibn Tibon, Solomon revealed that creationwas not entirely a direct, willed act of God, but that intermediate powerswere involved in it from the very first day on, namely the separate intelli-gences and spheres:You may explain this pair [a time for silence and a time for speaking]as an apology on the part of Solomon, for his disclosure the matter ofthe times. For Moses hid it profoundly and did not mention it in thenarrative of creation of all beings except for the word elohim, and Heis known there as the primal cause. . . . But he intended to hide it sothat no man would know about the times, that is, so that the masseswill not become aware of any intermediary powers. . . . And [Solomon]offered apologies for this, in that he expanded the explanation of thesecrets of the Torah at a time when he, may peace be upon him, shouldhave remained silent—that is to say, as Moses, may peace be upon him,remained silent. But there is also a time for him, may peace be uponhim, to speak as well. That is to say, the speech of Solomon, but he saidno more. But what he meant to say in that place is that Moses, maypeace be upon him gave the Torah, which was destined for the entireworld, including the Sabean nation, who did not believe in the exis-tence of anything except for those things that could be apprehended bythe senses. . . . Thus, he wished to uproot the disease from the startand he mentioned God’s creation of the main things in the world, with-out mentioning the intermediary powers, in order to teach that thoseactions should not be attributed to them at all. . . . But in the time ofSolomon, may peace be upon him, the existence of God and His angelshad become accepted in the world . . . so that the need for concealingthis was no longer present. Thus, Solomon did not avoid mentioningthe existence of intermediary powers by way of a hint. . . . And hespoke of the matter of the times, that Moses, may peace be upon him,made great efforts to hide it completely from consciousness, for thehint he hinted at was extremely obscure. It is not that Solomon, maypeace be upon him, made it up or that he stood against the Torah and disagreed, for truly it was hinted at in many places; one of them is110•Chapter Thirteen"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"the mention of elohim, which is in the plural form. (Perush Lekohelet69b–70a)As Aviezer Ravitzky pointed out, according to Ibn Tibon, the gradualprocess of disclosure depends on the advancement of scientific metaphys-ical knowledge in the world.3Since, in Moses’ time, the belief in thepower of the heavenly bodies without a transcendental God was preva-lent, Scripture explicitly denied the function of the heavenly bodies in cre-ation. Solomon wrote his books at a time when the belief in God and Hisangels was prevalent; thus he did not hesitate to hint at the participationof the heavenly bodies in the process of creation. Solomon did not comeup with the idea on his own. He explained a hint well concealed withinthe Torah itself. Moses already hinted at the participation of intermedi-ary forces in creation, since the name of the godhead that appears in thedescription of creation, elohim, is common to God, angels, and powers,unlike the Tetragrammaton.4The progression of successively clearerhints in sacred scripture—from the spare and enigmatic hint of Moses tothe more transparent ones of Solomon—is linked to the historical progressof metaphysical knowledge in the surrounding environment of the hinter.Ibn Tibon employs the same concept that he uses in explaining internalScriptural changes from Moses to Solomon—of the progress of humanknowledge—with respect to his own works—the widening of the aperturesof the showpiece:I furthermore wish to apologize for having revealed more than I shouldhave on matters that our Sages of blessed memory ordered be hidden.For I bring heaven and earth as witnesses that I did so only for the sakeof Heaven, for “in a time to do for the Lord [they violated YourLaw]”—for I saw that the secrets that were hidden then by ourprophets and the sages of our Torah, are today all well known amongthe nations of the world, and the secrets of the Torah and in the wordsof the prophets and those who speak by the Holy Spirit in many placesare interpreted according to those truths. For our nation has becomemore foolish than them to the point that we have become a mockery intheir eyes because of our foolishness. . . . So I said that at the timewhen the greatest of the prophets hid what he hid, these true matterswere not known or widespread among the nations, based on what wasknown to them, through their unfounded beliefs. (Ma’amar YikavuHamayim, p. 173)After he repeats his account of the historical process of the disclosureof secrets from Moses to Maimonides, he writes:And I, the youth who came after him [Maimonides] saw that the num-ber of those who understood his [Maimonides’] hints had declinedThe End of Esotericism•111"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"greatly, how much more so those who understood the hints in Scrip-ture. For I saw that true wisdom had become extremely widespreadamong the nations under whose rule and in whose land I live, far morethan it had been in the lands of the Ishmaelites. Thus, I saw the greatneed to enlighten the eyes of the instructed with what God, may Hisname be exalted, enabled me by His grace to understand in His wordand how he widened the apertures of the showpiece covering the applesof the parables of the prophets and those who speak by the Holy Spiritand the Sages of blessed memory....Consequently, I revealed what I have revealed in this composition and in my commentary on Ecclesi-astes, things that other men would not have revealed previously, so thatwe do not become a disgrace to our neighbors, a mockery and a derisionin our surroundings. (Ma’amar Yikavu Hamayim, pp. 174–175)The transfer of the Muslim philosophical culture to Christian Europetook place openly and with great vigor in the early thirteenth century. According to Shmuel Ibn Tibon, science and wisdom were more wide-spread in his time in the Christian world than in the Muslim world. Theprogress in knowledge had reached a level such that Torah secrets hadbeen exposed in any case, including the exegesis of Scripture according toa philosophical glossary, which began to develop in the Christian world.Based on this new historical reality, Ibn Tibon derived the permissibilityof unprecedented disclosure of Torah secrets. This argument, however,did not suffice for Ibn Tibon, even if it was a sufficient explanation for thechanges in disclosure of secrets in the course of their transmission fromMoses to David and Solomon. Ibn Tibon employed an additional argu-ment in relation to his own writings, which increased the sense of urgencyin breaking the frameworks of secrecy. He claimed that the number ofthose who understood wisdom among the Jews had diminished, and theirsages had become an object of mockery and derision to their surround-ing, while the sciences proliferated in the Christian world. The oppressiveasymmetry between the expansion of the sciences among the nations ofthe world and the decrease of wisdom in Israel created the consciousnessof a crisis. In such a situation, disclosure of secrets became justified evenat the expense of breaking the law: “In the time to do for the Lord [theyviolated your Torah].” These words of Ibn Tibon are the epitome of theprocess of the transformation of the esoteric into a tool of cultural inte-gration. Not only had the esoteric realm become the means that enabledthe absorption of Aristotelian culture into the heart of Judaism, but nowthe esoteric must be revealed for two reasons: first of all, because it hadbeen revealed anyway, and second, in order to withstand the pressuresbrought to bear on Judaism by that very culture. The esoteric goldenapple was now exposed before all, without any showpiece whatsoever.112•Chapter Thirteen"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"The relationship created by Ibn Tibon between his exoteric policy andthe dissemination of philosophical knowledge in Christian Europe wasnot accidental. Unlike Muslim culture, in which esotericism was legiti-mate and common, medieval Christianity saw esotericism as a realm sus-pect of heresy. The doctrinal centralization of the church created a situa-tion in which a thinker or movement that announced the existence of asecret thus testified that he had something to hide, and was automaticallysuspect of deviance and endangerment.5The entry of Aristotelianism intoChristian theology was open and public, and did not take place throughthe medium of esoteric doctrine, as in the Muslim and Christian worlds.The lack of a centralized church in the Jewish world enabled, of course,the freer development of esoteric tendencies. The transfer of the Jewishphilosophical tradition from the Muslim surroundings to the Christianone changed, among other things, Ibn Tibon’s esoteric molds. We maysurmise that it was not only the dissemination of knowledge in the Chris-tian world that influenced the disclosure, but also the influence of the opposition to concealment in principle, which lent a different mold tophilosophical writing.In his book Meshiv Devarim Nekhonim, Ya’akov bar Sheshet sharplycriticized Ibn Tibon’s book and his conception of esotericism. It wouldseem that the abandonment of the limits of esotericism by Ibn Tibon servedto provoke the kabbalists of Gerona to reveal their opposing secret. Theysaw themselves obligated to present their alternative understanding ofthe inner meaning of Jewish tradition, once Ibn Tibon had adopted thattradition as a kind of crownto be displayed in public. Small wonder,then, that Ya’akov bar Sheshet’s composition, Sha’ar Hashamayim, whichis a kind of introduction to the Kabbalah and the system of sefirot, con-cluded with a fierce attack on philosophical positions.The End of Esotericism•113"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 14Esotericism, Sermons, and Curricula: Ya’akov Anatoli and the Dissemination of the SecretThe process ofthe transformation of philosophy into an exoteric culturein the thirteenth century, which was vigorously launched in the writingsof Shmuel Ibn Tibon, continued on two levels: the first, the developmentof a literature of philosophical homilies, and the other, an attempt at an-choring the philosophical educational program as the central element ofthe Jewish curriculum. The process of expansion and dissemination ofphilosophical Torah secrets took place mainly in Provence, where Mai-monidean culture gained the upper hand. This process, however, did notcome about without struggle, a struggle that also touched upon the deter-mination of the boundaries of secrecy. The tension between the secret andthe revealed that marked thirteenth century esotericism reached a seethingpoint in the dispute over philosophical sermons and the teaching of phi-losophy in the early fourteenth century. In this dispute, the esoteric prob-lem became a political-communitarian problem of the first order, as it ex-panded beyond the question of the forms of writing and hinting andengaged far deeper and more fundamental questions, such as the canon ofstudy and the public exposure of esoteric doctrines through the genre ofphilosophical sermons. An investigation of this process and the disputesit engendered bring to light profound aspects of the esoteric problem.One of the key figures in this process was Ya’akov Anatoli, the son-in-law of Shmuel Ibn Tibon. In line with the cultural mission of his family,Anatoli (1194–1256) contributed as well to the translation and dissemi-nation of Arabic learning in the West. His peculiar and fascinating placein this process is manifested in his work in Naples under the royal invita-tion and patronage of Frederick II in association with Michael Scot.Ya’akov Anatoli wrote Malmad Hatalmidim, the first book of philosoph-ical sermons arranged according to the order of the weekly liturgicalreadings. The author of this book viewed it as a tool for public dissemina-tion of philosophicalideas, and used it in order to increase public sympa-thy for the philosophical ethos. Ya’akov Anatoli himself is witness to thetension engendered by the appearance of this literary genre:As this book [Guide of the Perplexed] removed some of the blindsfrom my eyes, I devoted my heart to study and investigate some of the"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"writings of the Torah and the other holy books, and when I wouldstudy them I would sometimes expound on them at weddings. But as a result of my preoccupation with the vanities of this world that I ac-quired, I did not write even a single line of all the new insights thatcame to me through expounding those verses. And as I became accus-tomed to the matter, I agreed to expound publicly, a bit at a time, everyShabbat. But I left that path, as it met with the disapproval of some ofmy friends. (Introduction to Malmad Hatalmidim)The book began as a series of public sermons at weddings and in syn-agogues, and Anatoli testifies that the criticism of this custom led him tochange his custom of preaching philosophical sermons in public. The exoteric writing employed by Shmuel Ibn Tibon was intended, he says,for Torah scholars. Anatoly’s turning to a wider audience, through themedium of public sermons, was another step in philosophy’s departurefrom the esoteric realm. Ya’akov Anatoli uses the same reasoning asShmuel Ibn Tibon in justifying the transgression of the boundaries of esotericism, but adds an interesting comment later in the introduction:For we have reached the point where we have become a mockeryamong the nations because of our wisdom and the commandments ofthe Torah, for we no longer devote ourselves to learning how to re-spond to the heretic, as our masters warned us. For the heretics slanderus and say that we eat the peelings, while they consume the fruit. Forthey make efforts to study and expound the Torah according to theirfaith, and preach it publicly at all times, to the point where falsehoodhas long overcome truth, and we have almost abandoned the path oftruth transmitted us by God.To Shmuel Ibn Tibon’s words on the dissemination of wisdom in Chris-tian lands, Ya’akov Anatoli adds that the public sermons of the Christians—“for they preach on matters of wisdom”—serves as preparation for therenewed exoteric level he creates. According to Ya’akov Anatoli, the de-velopment of philosophical sermons among the nations of the world callsforth, in response, a wider exposure of the philosophical exegesis of Scrip-ture, through sermons in synagogues and at marriage ceremonies.In addition to the development of a genre of public philosophical ser-mons, Ya’akov Anatoli also vehemently expressed his stand on the ques-tion of curriculum. He supported the making of the narrative of creationand the vision of the chariot into a central element of the education of theelite, while displacing the talmudic give-and-take from the core of thecurriculum. Indeed, the esoteric realm is a threat to the talmudic curricu-lum, whose ideal type is, first and foremost, the Talmud sage and teacher.As we have seen, this dilemma was solved in the schools of NahmanidesSermons and Curricula•115"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"and the Rashba through a restrictive concept of esotericism that confinedesoteric teachings to the Torah scholars alone. Ya’akov Anatoli formu-lated an opposing view, in which physics and metaphysics replace theTalmud in the traditional curriculum. Thus, the question of the limits ofsecrecy has ramifications for the formation of the cultural elite of the con-gregation. In his introduction to Malmad Hatalmidim, Ya’akov Anatolioutlines his position on the question of the place of the Talmud in thecanon of learning:For we find explicitly that our rabbis were accustomed to study wis-dom, for they said that the smallest among Hillel’s eighty students leftnot a single type of wisdom unlearned, they praised him and said that heleft neither small not great thing unlearned. For they of blessed mem-ory explained that the vision of the chariot is the very great thing, andall wisdoms are directed toward it and are aids to it, for it alone has thegreat and perfect purpose, for with it man may approach the King. Thedoings of Abbaye and Rava [talmudic dialectics], on the other hand,they called a small thing, for the Mishnayot and other set legal com-pendia are sufficient material for those who seek wisdom. This is theopinion of our Rabbis of blessed memory. But today, the great thing inthe eyes of the teachers of the Talmud is the preoccupation with the tal-mudic passages, not only with the legal decisions deriving from thembut with the business of questions and answers. Whereas the smallthing has become the vision of the chariot, which is the divine wisdom.In this dispute, we may discern four assumptions:1. The value of talmudic study lies strictly in clarifying the halakha, andnot “the business of questions and answers.” That is, the new insights,which arise in the course of the discussion and in its subsequent devel-opment.2. The study of halakha is a means of achieving the highest wisdom, thatis, the divine wisdom, metaphysics.3. The Talmud scholars of his generation commit a great spiritual errorin placing talmudic learning (the doings of Abbaye and Rava) at theheart of the curriculum.4. Since the clarification of the halakha is the heart and purpose of thetalmudic discussion, this work has already been accomplishedthrough the major halakhic compendia of the Rif and Maimonides, sothat there is no longer any need to deal with the world of talmudic di-alectics, “for the Mishnayot and other set legal decisions are sufficientmaterial for those who study wisdom.”Anatoli vehemently disputed the rabbinic position with respect to thespiritual importance of intensive talmudic study. If physics and metaphysics116•Chapter Fourteen"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"are the subjects that enable man to fulfill his spiritual destiny and actualizehis potential perfection, the value of investigation of talmudic discussionsis marginal. According to him, this activity serves only for clarification ofthe halakhah. Furthermore, Anatoli claims that even for knowledge ofthe halakhah itself, one need not study the talmudic passages directly, as wepossess purely halakhic writings such as Maimonides’ code. The learnershould concentrate on the Mishna and other halakhic compendia, whichare legal texts without give-and-take, and focus on the vision of the char-iot, which is knowledge of nature—physics—and what is beyond nature—metaphysics. In the opinion of Ya’akov Anatoli, the Talmud is undoubt-edly an authoritative text, for the binding norms of halakha are derivedfrom it. But as a result of Maimonides’ codification of the Mishneh Torah,combined with the concept that only intensive study of wisdom has in-trinsic value, the Talmud becomes a marginal text in the curriculum. Theesoteric mechanism, which was designed to base traditional education onits talmudic ideals, may lose its force entirely once the distinction be-tween the secret and the revealed is blurred, and the narrative of creationand the vision of the chariot become defined as broad realms of knowl-edge which make up the canon of learning.This position, as formulated by Anatoli, typified the non-talmudicalbranch of Jewish intellectual elite. Rabbi Shem Tov Falkeria adopts asimilar position, both with respect to the value of Talmud study, as wellas with respect to the central position of the Mishneh Torahas a replace-ment for the prevailing halakhic curriculum:In the beginning, he should study the Written Law, and afterward theOral Law which is its explanation. At that time, it is sufficient that he read the laws of Rav Alfasi of blessed memory, and that he read thebooks of Rabbi Moshe [Maimonides] of blessed memory, which arecalled the Mishneh Torah, for they are true words. His commentary onthe Mishna is also a very useful book, and for whoever would learnlegal decisions, this is sufficient. And if he desires, it is good that hestudy Mishnayot and the Talmud, which is the commentary to them, inorder to exercise his mind and sharpen it, for this is necessary in study,for the effort in it will make knowledge and understanding easier, andwill aid in remembering these matters. But I will tell you something: It is unfitting to spend all one’s days in questions and responses asmany do, for they tire themselves all night in the reading of halakhahand in the morning, if someone asks of one of its matters, they have noanswer. (Sefer Hamevakesh[Warsaw, 1884], p. 102)According to Falkeria, the study of legal decisions is the main thing,while the study of the Talmud becomes marginal, and its purpose ismerely the sharpening of the mind. Like Ya’akov Anatoli, he saw theSermons and Curricula•117"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"compendia of halakhic decisions—the Rif and the Mishneh Torah—asreplacements for the talmudic curriculum.A similar, and even more extreme position, is found in the writings of Rabbi Yosef Ibn Kaspi. In his Sefer Hamusar, which is his testament to his son, he describes the Torah curriculum: “For today you are twelveyears old. Thus, study the Torah and Scripture and the Talmud for twomore years.” After two years of study of mathematics, geometry, astron-omy, and ethics, the Torah curriculum changes: “Fix times for study of the Torah and Scripture and the books of Rav Alfasi and Rabbi Mosheof Coucy and the Mishneh Torahof the perfect master” (Sefer Hamusar,p. 66).The curriculum that Kaspi does recommend consists of logic, science,and metaphysics, and in it Talmud study ceases at age fourteen and is replaced by halakhic texts and Sefer Mitzvot Gadolof Rabbi Moshe ofCoucy. Later on he describes a certain event, adopting a sarcastic andcritical tone toward the devoted students and rabbis:One day....I set my table and called to my beloved to eat and drinkwithme, for I had a family offering to bring; but the cursed maidservantwentand put a milkmaid’s spoon into the pot and the law escaped me. . . . So I went in a foul, angry mood to one of the respected rabbisamong the people. . . . and he taught me and told me that the law wassuch and such. So I returned to my home and the guests and the poorwere sitting and waiting for me, and I told them the entire story, for Iam not embarrassed to say that I am unfamiliar with a certain halaka-hah or a certain trade, but I am familiar with another trade. For whyshould a legal decision or a teaching on the knowledge of the Creatoror His great unity not be as important as the spoon of a little milk-maid? (Sefer Hamusar, p. 69)1We should not be surprised that we do not find a single new insightinto questions of talmudic give-and-take from these circles. These circlesdeveloped the study of wisdom in its broadest sense as the central elementof Jewish education, and thus they defiantly opposed the tendency withinesotericism that saw the talmudic sage as the superior esotericist.2Philosophical culture created alternative understandings toward talmu-dic study and the role of Maimonides’ Mishneh Torah. According to thisposition, it was, paradoxically, the codification of the Talmud, which wasdesigned to increase its authority and normative canonicity, which madeit a marginal text in the learned canon.3Philosophers like Ya’akov Anatoli were of the opinion that Maimonides attempted to introduce amajor change in the Jewish curriculum through the Mishneh Torah, inorder to remove the “small thing” from the way, and enable devotion to the “big thing.” The traditional curriculum, as molded by Anatoli, 118•Chapter Fourteen"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"created a separation between esotericists and Talmud scholars, as opposedto the attempt made by the school of the Rashba, to prevent the develop-ment of a competing elite. Thus, another important element of esoteri-cism was eroded, that which attempted to keep the tradition of the secretwithin the circle of halakhic authorities.Sermons and Curricula•119"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 15The Ambivalence of Secrecy: The Dispute over Philosophy in the Early Fourteenth CenturyAt the coreof the dispute over the study of philosophy that raged inProvence in the early fourteenth century was the rise of the philosophicalsermons and the transformation of the curriculum, the two elements em-phasized in Anatoli’s writings, whose influence on the esoteric structurewas far-reaching. This dispute deserves to be examined in detail, as itdeals entirely with the problem of secrecy. Here, the tensions between dis-closure and concealment, which developed in the thirteenth century,erupted into a fierce dispute transcending communal borders.1Accordingto the testimony of the instigator of this dispute, Abba Mari, the eventthat set off the dispute was a public sermon in which the preacher com-pared Abraham and Sarah to matter and form, in accordance with thecommonly accepted dictionary of philosophical allegory.2Abba Mari,who was at the time a rabbi in Montpelier, left a detailed and impressiveaccount of the dispute in the text Minhat Kna’ot (Offering of Zeal),which includes a handful of letters that were exchanged between the par-ties and their allies in the dispute. This collection of letters is an invalu-able resource for the understanding of the politics of esotericism and itsbasic structures. In 1303, Abba Mari attempted to mobilize the Rashbato battle against the philosophical circles in Provence and against publicphilosophical sermons. In this request, which in fact was the opening salvoof the struggle, Abba Mari did not limit himself to the internal debate inProvence, but enlarged its boundaries by seeking support in Barcelona,among the greatest halakhic authorities of the generation. Shlomo ibnAdret, known as the Rashba, was the greatest of Nahmanides’ students.He continued the kabbalistic tradition of his teacher and became his heiras the leader of the Jewish community in Barcelona. His vast legal re-sponsa, written to communities across Spain, serve as testimony to his wide-spread authority. Yet interfering with a cultural debate across the borderin Provence was a completely different matter. It engaged Rashba in adrama that he at first hesitated to join. Abba Mari and the Rashba accusedthe allegorists of turning the historical forefathers of the nation into ab-stract concepts of Aristotelian physics.3According to the Rashba, the allegorical tendency of the preachers would quickly spread to the com-mandments themselves, turn the practical commandments to symbols of"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"Aristotelian typology, and even lead to their abolition.4Abba Mari andthe Rashba also repeated the accusation that these circles uncritically ac-cept the Aristotelian-Averroesean tradition, and as such, they deny the be-lief in creation ex nihiloand divine providence, which is a form of heresythreatening the very existence of the Jewish religion.The Rashba fiercely attacked the philosophical tradition and allegoricalsermonizing. He was aware that the Provencal elite would interpret hisentry into the dispute as illegitimate, external meddling in internal culturalquestions. Thus he was hesitant to get involved and urged Abba Mariand other Provencal figures to act on their own against the philosophicalculture that was spreading in their region. After the Rashba failed to con-vince his supporters in Perpignan to do so, and after a failed attempt byAbba Mari and his faction to institute a ban in Montpelier, the Rashbaconsented. After lengthy negotiations, he accepted Abba Mari’s sugges-tion that the Barcelona community place a ban on philosophy and, fol-lowing the Barcelona precedent, which would bear the seal of the Rashba,the Provencal communities could then proclaim a ban of their own. Onthe ninth of Av in the year 5265 (1305),5the Barcelona congregation de-clared a ban on the study of the books of the non-Jewish philosophersdealing with physics and metaphysics for all those under the age of twenty-five. However, before Abba Mari and his supporters could declare a sim-ilar ban in Provence, his opponents hastened to declare a counter-bancontending that, since those who declared the ban in Barcelona did so un-lawfully, they should be banned. Moreover, all who accepted the authorityof the Barcelona ban and followed it would also come under this ban.Abba Mari attempted to marshal the support of as many halakhic mas-ters as possible in order to annul the ban of his opponents, and pronounceda ban of his own on those who proclaimed the counter-ban. Bans andcounter-bans did not lead to a solution. The entire struggle ceased as a re-sult of the tragic circumstances of the expulsion of the Jews from France,including the Jews of Montpelier, among them Abba Mari, on the tenthof Av, 5266 (1306).The complex structure of the ban, the alliances it created, and the con-fusion it generated are linked to a phenomenon that I would call the am-bivalence of the esoteric. The attempt to reclaim a body of knowledge forthe esoteric realm may be interpreted in two opposing ways. On the onehand, the renewed tightening of the restrictions of secrecy may be moti-vated by the desire to guard that knowledge as a preferred and valuedrealm, whose transmission must be strictly regulated. On the other hand,the restrictions on dissemination and teaching may be directed by the op-posite desire to prevent the cumulative influence of such knowledge, asfar as possible. Relegating a particular body of knowledge to the con-cealed is rooted in the traditional attempt to keep this body of knowledgeThe Ambivalence of Secrecy•121"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"privileged and precious. Yet concealment might serve to the contrary as atechnique of repression and marginalization. The phenomenon of am-bivalence with regard to esoteric doctrines was reflected in the allianceforged between Abba Mari and the Rashba, in spite of the profound dif-ferences between their worldviews. In order to appreciate these differ-ences and their reflection in what I have called the ambivalence of the esoteric, I describe, at some length, the difference in their views.The world of Abba Mari was shaped by the Maimonidean tradition. Inhis composition Sefer Hayare’ah, Abba Mari again confirmed the Mai-monidean identification of physics and metaphysics with Jewish esotericdoctrines—the narration of creation and the vision of the chariot:It is known and evident to the sages that there are two kinds of wis-dom, the first—the knowledge of nature, which is the wisdom of thework of creation, and the second, the knowledge of the Godhead,which is the vision of the chariot. . . . For there is great benefit to thesages who fear the Lord in each of the two purposes, for through thema person may discern the design of existence and may know and com-prehend some of the wonders of God, may He be blessed. And he mayproceed through those levels until he attains the two superior wisdoms,the work of creation and the vision of the chariot. Through them hemay know and comprehend He who spoke and the world came intobeing. (Minhat Kna’ot, pp. 648–649)6According to Abba Mari, such wisdom was transmitted by an internaltradition among the sages of Israel, and preserved as an esoteric tradi-tion: “It is evidently clear that those matters of wisdom were receivedfrom the pairs [of Sages mentioned in Tractate Avot 1 :1] and the pairsfrom the prophets.” In exile, this wisdom was lost, and some of it waspreserved in the Greek philosophical literature:Because our sins have increased, from the day we were exiled from ourland, the wisdom of our sages was lost when the books written on hid-den matters were lost, for they are the secrets of creation. But an ex-tremely small portion of those words, which are like mountains hangingby a hair, were copied from them in the books of the nations, and weredisseminated among the Gentiles, and they are the works of investigationwritten by the wise men of Greece, for there may be found there someof the honey that Solomon hinted at when he said, “For I have foundhoney, etc.” And from there we may derive the complete proof of theexistence of God, may he be blessed, and His unity and his noncorpo-reality. For this is the explanation of the first two of the Ten Command-ments, “I am the Lord” and “Thou shalt have no other gods.” . . . Thisis the honey and the incense and the good that is hidden in those122•Chapter Fifteen"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"books. But what shall we do, and how shall we approach these things?It is like a jar of honey with a dragon entwined around it.” (MinhatKna’ot, p. 653)The source of Greek wisdom is thus to be found in Jewish esoteric teach-ingswhich have become lost and have found their way, in part, to the na-tions. In the opinion of Abba Mari, selective study of the philosophicalliterature enables one in practice to reconstitute the esoteric teachings ofthe work of creation and the vision of the chariot, and this literature, according to the Maimonidean tradition, has religious value. But intothis corpus crept many errors pertaining to the eternity of the world andthe denial of divine providence, which are dangerous for the believer.As Abba Mari belonged to the rabbinic-Maimonidean world, an under-standing of his struggle is quite complex. He argued that the spread ofpublic philosophical sermons that employ an extreme allegorical approachto Scripture, like the allegory that Abraham and Sarah are matter andform, is what moved him to proclaim battle. Abba Mari truly believedthat his efforts were aimed at reinstating the boundaries of esotericismthat Maimonides himself fixed with respect to the study of philosophyand its dissemination. It is because philosophical wisdom is the Jewish esoteric teaching that its uncontrolled dissemination must be prohibited.He repeatedly explains that he is not out to attack the philosophical culturein Provence as a whole, but rather to reestablish it within the limits set byMaimonides. A programatic formulation of his point of view appears inthe third chapter of Sefer Hayare’ah. In this chapter, he claims that suchwisdom was part of the Jewish esoteric tradition, and it is clear to himthat in earlier periods they were free of the dross of heresy that now ad-heres to it. Yet the Sages nevertheless regarded them as totally esoteric:It is evidently clear that such knowledge was received in transmissionfrom the pairs and the prophets. As that is so, we are certain that theirstudy did not contain anything contradicting the foundations of theTorah or departure from the principles of religion. Nevertheless, ourSages of blessed memory said that one may not expound the vision ofthe chariot alone, nor the work of creation with fewer than two, unlesshe was a sage and understands of his own knowledge. Furthermore,they said that the secrets of the Torah may only be transmitted to thehead of a rabbinic court, and then only if his heart fears within him.Moreover, it says that with respect to the learning of the forty-two-letter Name, a matter which is known through divine wisdom, as waswritten in the commentary of Rabbi Moses of blessed memory [Mai-monides]. And, in general, those letters are an instruction and hint tothat teaching. And [Maimonides] of blessed memory warned that it be taught only to humble individuals, as it is written, “and that only ifThe Ambivalence of Secrecy•123"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"he be humble and has lived out half his days.” And the rabbi, theteacher of righteousness, wrote in Sefer Hamadathat it is not fitting fora man to walk in the pardesuntil he has filled his belly with meat andwine, which is the interpretation of the Torah and the commandments.(Minhat Kna’ot, pp. 650–651)The restriction of the study of philosophy to those advanced in age isbased, in his understanding, on the words of Maimonides himself, andaccords with his Maimonidean worldview:For this is what our rabbi, the teacher of righteousness, intended in hisgreat book, Guide of the Perplexed, in Part 1, Chapter 34, and theseare his words: “Consider how, by means of a text of a book, they laiddown as conditions of the perfection of the individual, his being perfectin the varieties of political regimes as well as in the speculative sciencesand withal his possessing natural perspicacity and understanding andthe gift of finely expressing himself in communicating notions in hints.And yet, the mysteries of the Torah may not be transmitted to him”[Guide, p. 78, modified]. Until this point, these are the words of ourgreat master, of blessed memory, and it is fitting that we take heed ofthem. (Minhat Kna’ot, p. 652)In order to support his claim, Abba Mari cites one of the outstandingrepresentatives of the Maimonidean tradition, Rabbi David Kimhi:For I saw that the sage, Rabbi David Kimhi of blessed memory, followedin the footsteps of our great master. For he wrote in his commentary onthe verse “The beginning of wisdom [is the fear of the Lord]” as fol-lows: “for if a person learn the wisdom of philosophy first, his spiritmay falter, and he may become brazen and deny the great signs andwonders in the sacred scriptures. Thus, one must first study the Torah,which is the fear of the Lord. And he must place it in his heart to be-lieve all that is written in it, from the creationex nihiloof the world tothe possibility of change in nature through signs and wonders. . . .Only then should he study the wisdom of philosophy, so that his mindnot becomes confused through his learning of wisdom, thanks to theTorah that he learned previously. For he has planted his stake uponsolid ground; thus he may use all his strength to draw the ways of wis-dom closer to the Torah. (Minhat Kna’ot, pp. 656–657)Abba Mari thus concludes that one must reinstate the earlier restric-tions on the study of wisdom:Henceforth, we may not learn from their books not hear wisdom fromtheir mouths, and even if they speak truth, we should not listen to them.124•Chapter Fifteen"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"But for the great sages, the gate to the inner courts [of the sanctuary] isnever locked, for they remove the coarse flour and take the fine meal. . . .But for other people, who have not perfected themselves in Torah andhave not yet reached the requisite age for dealing with such wisdom,and do not know how to take heed, they should avoidthis food, lest theychoke on its shell. (Minhat Kna’ot, pp. 659–660)7By tightening the restrictions on esotericism, Abba Mari hopes to defend the moderate Maimonidean tradition against its more radical version. The postponement of study until a more advanced age, and its restriction to individuals, will prevent the questioning of faith in creationex nihiloand providence. Consequently, these beliefs would be implantedas a solid basis preceding the student’s exposure to philosophical texts.Furthermore, Abba Mari understands that the elite’s continued preoccu-pation with talmudic dialectics, alongside the philosophical vision of thechariot, is largely dependent on postponing philosophical training untilafter the intensive study of Talmud. He expresses, in blatant language, his doubt in the success of the talmudic curriculum in successfully com-peting with the early study of philosophy: “Among them are those whochoose to have their houses orphaned of all study of the books of the Talmud. And if one but approaches the books of Debei Rav[Talmud], itwill seem as if a scorpion has bitten him. And to learn of the On thingsHeard(of Aristotle), he will hasten as an eagle to eat, but if they removefrom him the book of Sense and Sensibilia (of Aristotle) it will seem as if a serpent has bitten him” (Minhat Kna’ot, p. 652). He formulates his struggle as an internal Maimonidean struggle within the Provencaltradition, but this struggle reveals a violent outbreak of the tension be-tween differing tendencies in the understanding of Maimonides’ legacy.Abba Mari wrote to his internal opponents as follows: “For we have notcome, God prevent us, to denounce wisdom. This never crossed ourminds. But rather, to establish your words, and to fix a proper time forthem, for they are no better than the vision of the chariot” (MinhatKna’ot, p. 447).We may understand the change that takes place in this struggle by ex-amining the motivations and intentions of the Rashba, Abba Mari’s mainally; here, the ambivalence of the esoteric becomes evident. The Rashbawas interested in setting limitations on the study of philosophy, but notbecause it dealt with the vision of the chariot, which demanded cautionand esotericism. The Rashba, the prominent successor to the kabbalistictradition of the school of Nahmanides, maintained an entirely differentposition with respect to Jewish esoteric teachings. For him, the imposi-tion of limits on the study of philosophy was a first step toward its even-tual total eradication. In one of the first letters sent by the Rashba toThe Ambivalence of Secrecy•125"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"Abba Mari, the profound difference between the two allies is evident.The Rashba himself comments on this:For those incurable people whom you spoke of, who preach on the vision of the chariot before the multitudes in the synagogues, mayheaven reveal their sin, for they preach foolish words and make publictheir madness. But in the matter of which you have accused them of re-vealing what the ancient One of the world has concealed, my heart tellsme that they have revealed nothing of what is hidden. They are notguilty of the sin of disclosure, and their foolishness, and their lack ofknowledge saves them from that sin. (Minhat Kna’ot, p. 345)Abba Mari accuses those who preach philosophical sermons of reveal-ing the secrets of the vision of the chariot, whereas the Rashba, ironically,pardons them from this sin for, according to him, they revealed nothingof what was concealed.8From the point of view of the Rashba, thosepreachers preaching dangerous foolish words are not among those whoenteredpardesbefore their time, and consequently reveal secrets in pub-lic; rather they are among those who exchanged pardesfor heresy.In many of his letters, the Rashba attacked his opponents using theimage of philosophy as the foreign woman who attempts to displace theTorah-queen in her own house. The comparison of the Torah to the child-hood wife of Israel or to the woman betrothed to Israel is a well-knownimage in talmudic literature. Parallel to it, we find the image of Greekwisdom as the forbidden, alluring foreign woman. In one of the moreblatant passages of the ban formulated by the Rashba and the notables ofBarcelona, it is written:The voice of God calls to the city, the voice of God spews forth flames,the voice says “Read.” Read in the ears of the people, who wreakeddevastation in the land, who trampled the fence, who mock the disci-pline of the mother, and remove her from authority, who fornicatedwith the daughter of a foreign god and by every crossroads revealedher nakedness. (Minhat Kna’ot, pp. 409–410)The ban proposal was discussed in Montpelier and, of course, arousedtremendous opposition among the supporters of wisdom. Based on thewords of the Rashba, they concluded that the struggle far surpassed the internal Maimonidean discussion, as Abba Mari sought to present it.For the supporters of wisdom, the ban was a direct attack on the entireProvencal culture. Their position was based, among other things, on thewidespread reference to wisdom using metaphors of the daughter of aforeign god or as a foreign, forbidden woman. In order to refute theirclaims, Abba Mari asked for a clarification from the Rashba. This requestreveals the yawning chasm between the two allies, as well as Abba Mari’s126•Chapter Fifteen"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"approach, requesting that their differences be obscured, so that the strug-gle could be formulated as an internal Maimonidean dispute:In order to put into practice the validity of the epistle to seek the Lordwithout error, I the young one [Abba Mari] come and humbly supplicatebefore saint and angel [Rashba] that he lend me an ear. It is written inthe epistle, “fornicated with the daughter of a foreign god and embrac-ing a strange woman in his bosom.” To our understanding, this speaksof those who deal in heresies, who preach false words which lead wis-dom astray. For some people say that the letter intended to call theteachings of astronomy and the wisdom of philosophy “the daughterof a strange god.” For the vision of their eyes was obscured, for thestudy of wisdom was prohibited only for those under thirty years old.For when the word of our master, well-explained, will arrive, thosewho understand your true words will be joyful and glad. (MinhatKna’ot, p. 444)In this appeal, which was never answered, Abba Mari requests that theRashba clarify his words on the daughter of the foreign god. Abba Mariquotes the Rashba’s words and implores him to restrict them to the strug-gle against the denial of the belief in creation ex nihiloand the public ser-mons, and to clarify to his opponents that the metaphor of “the daughterof a foreign god” does not apply to the wisdom of nature and philosophyas a whole. As evidence for the interpretation he provides for theRashba’s words, Abba Mari states that the nature of the ban is unclear tohis opponents: “For the vision of their eyes was obscured, for the studyof wisdom was prohibited only for those under thirty years old.” He claimsthat were the Rashba of the opinion that philosophy and the teachings ofastronomy were daughters of a foreign god, and those who study it betraythe wives of their youth, namely the Torah, why did the text of the banpermit the study of philosophy for those over thirty years of age? AbbaMari attempts to prove that, contrary to the interpretation given by hisopponents to the initiative of the Rashba and the notables of Barcelona,the ban indeed accords with the internal limits that Maimonides himselfwould have set. He does not reject philosophy as something completelyprohibited, but sees it as an esoteric realm, which must be studied cau-tiously, and only upon maturity. Similarly, the only study of wisdom thatwas prohibited by the ban were physics and metaphysics, but not logic,astronomy, and mathematics.Among the figures who were enlisted to support the ban on philosophywas a great talmudic authority, Asher ben Yehiel, known as the Rosh.The Rosh resided at the time in Toledo, where he was the rabbi of thecity, yet his origins were in Worms, Germany, where he had been the heirto Meir ben Barukh of Rothenburg. He was forced to move to Spain afterThe Ambivalence of Secrecy•127"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"the imprisonment of his teacher, and as a recognized rabbinic authority hewas welcomed by the Rashba and his circles. Being educated in Ashkenazhe had no sympathy for the Jewish Arabic culture of Andalusia and itsimpact in Provence. In Toldeo he was engaged in a fierce struggle with therepresentative of the Andalusian cultures, who saw him as an alien figurewho managed to marginalize the old Spanish Jewish elite. His reaction tothe ban reveals a similar understanding to that of Abba Mari: he took ex-ception to the ban for the same reasons that Abba Mari favored it. In hisletter dealing with Abba Mari’s attempt at acquiring the Rosh’s support,he argues:For your honor knows that I signed your request against my betterjudgment and under duress. For how should I sign that one should notstudy [philosophy] before twenty-five years of age? It would result thatI give permission [to study it] after twenty-five. In my opinion, it shouldbe prohibited for his entire lifetime, but in order not to discourage others [from signing], I signed. (Minhat Kna’ot, pp. 834–835)If the ban were formulated to the Rosh’s satisfaction, without the constraints of the Maimonidean-rabbinic movement in Provence, thestudy of philosophy would have been prohibited after the age of twenty-five as well! The Rosh testifies that he supported the ban under duress,and signed it only in order not to weaken the resolve of the other signa-tories.9Small wonder, then, that the request for clarification addressed to the Rashba by Abba Mari, in a tone that comes close to begging anddisplays a sense of urgency, was never answered. While the Rashba didformulate the ban in terms that were acceptable to the supporters of phi-losophy, he was not prepared to lend the ban the interpretation that AbbaMari lent it. The Rashba’s rhetoric, in several of his letters, teaches usthat he did not try to restrict the philosophical vision of the chariot to itsdesired boundaries as an esoteric doctrine, but rather saw the ban as a firststep toward the expulsion of this daughter of the foreign god from the con-gregation of Israel.10The difference between Abba Mari and the Rashbain defining the purposes of the ban, on the one hand, and their coopera-tion, on the other, reveal a fundamental and essential tension within esotericism, which endows the entire esoteric idea with an ambivalent di-mension: on the one hand, esotericism can preserve knowledge and lendit an exclusive status; on the other, esotericism is a means of making thatvery knowledge ineffectual and immaterial. Abba Mari sees esotericismas a safeguard, whereas the Rashba sees it as a means of suppression.The ambivalent attitude toward the esoteric finds expression not onlyin the alliance between Abba Mari and the Rashba, but also in the shiftingloyalties of another halakhic master who was involved in this dispute—Rabbi Menahem HaMeiri from Perpignan, the author of the great 128•Chapter Fifteen"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"talmudic commentary Beit Habehiraand a scholar with strong adherenceto the Maimonidean philosophical culture. Abba Mari did not includeHaMeiri’s letter to him in his book Minhat Kna’ot. This letter was pre-served along with a critical comment of one of Abba Mari’s students,Rabbi Shimon ben Yosef. Apparently, Abba Mari thought it best to suppress HaMeiri’s response, because of his high status among AbbaMari’s opponents.11HaMeiri’s words and the response of Rabbi Shimonben Yosef apparently deal with the relation between esotericism and autonomy.According to the witness of HaMeiri himself, the mobilization of theRashba, the kabbalist of Barcelona, in the struggle, completely reversed hisposition toward Abba Mari and his initiative. HaMeiri was opposed tothe dissemination of Torah secrets, contrary to the position of Shmuel IbnTibon. He wrote Abba Mari that when he heard that he was declaringwar on the public philosophical sermons, he identified with him com-pletely and wanted to restrict the dissemination of Torah secrets:Before many days the rumor reached us, that you began to show yourgreatness and your mighty hand, and to cancel the matter of the ser-mons, both through agreements and through bans and oaths, to cancelthem entirely, so that in the sermons they would speak only of theTorah, the Talmud, and the Midrash, and sometimes explain the versesthrough aggadot and wisdom, but in things that are not destructiveand do not reveal secrets of the secrets of the Torah or of prophecy. Werejoiced over your sayings as one who finds a great treasure, we praisedit and exalted it and we approved of it as we saw fit. We said thatthrough your deed, God will grant us respite from our anger and oursadness. (Hoshen Mishpat, p. 150; Letter of Shimon ben Yosef, pub-lished by D. Kaufmann in Jubelchrift zum neunzigsten Geburtstag des L.Zunz[Berlin, 1884], Hebrew section, p. 147)HaMeiri, however, completely reversed his position when Abba Mariturned to the Rashba, after his original failure, and asked him to join thestruggle against the sermons: “For while we were still conversing, an-other came and said that when your advice was not immediately put inpractice, you shook the earth, and before the master the Rabbi [Rashba]you sought to prove the well-foundedness of your case, thus casting wis-dom before mockers and its students to perdition” (Hoshen Mishpat,p. 150). HaMeiri saw this appeal to the Rashba as a fundamental changein the struggle of Abba Mari. Once the Rashba became involved in thestruggle, it was no longer, in his opinion, an internal philosophical strug-gle over the limits of dissemination of Torah secrets, but an all-out attackon philosophical culture. The dispute was transformed from an internalstruggle within the camp of the masters of wisdom to a total struggleThe Ambivalence of Secrecy•129"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"against wisdom. As HaMeiri writes: “Although our master the Rabbi isthe father of us all and no one strays or opens his mouth to dispute theperfection of his greatness, you already know that in such matters, not allopinions are the same. They chose as their lot the wisdom of the Kab-balah, and most philosophical matters are for them devils and angels ofdestruction” (Hoshen Mishpat, pp. 150–151).In his letter to Abba Mari, HaMeiri claimed that the Rashba was akabbalist known for his opposition to philosophical wisdom, and throughhis involvement the dispute became an all-out clash between two cultures—Kabbalah and philosophy. HaMeiri deduces from the case of the Rashbato that of Abba Mari: “It is evident to me [HaMeiri] that many wereawakened the spear of your [Abba Mari] wisdom, and mobilized your in-tention in conjunction with that of our master the rabbi [Rashba], toannul all matters of wisdom and to drive it out so that it has no inheri-tance in our land” (156). HaMeiri belongs to the camp of philosophicalwisdom that fought an internal battle against philosophical sermons, sothat his heart was with Abba Mari for as long as he waged an internalbattle in Provence on the question of the exoteric nature of philosophy.Once the picture changed, and the Rashba joined the struggle, HaMeiribegan to support the opponents of Abba Mari. The alliance betweenAbba Mari and the Rashba, which was constructed upon differing con-ceptions and an ambivalent approach to esotericism, resulted in HaMeiri’sreversing his position completely.12An interesting aspect of the exoteric question is revealed by one of themost interesting and sharpest criticisms levied by HaMeiri against theban proclaimed in Barcelona. According to the text of the ban, it wasprohibited for students under the age of twenty-five to learn the Greekbooks on nature and metaphysics, although they were permitted to studythe books of the Jewish authors, including the writings of Maimonides.To this, HaMeiri poses the following question: If the ban had been de-signed to fight against the uncontrolled dissemination of philosophicalideas and philosophical sermons, it would have been preferable to fightthe popular compositions and sermons of the Jewish authors, rather thanprohibit Aristotelian metaphysics and physics—works that are difficultand esoteric by nature. In HaMeiri’s opinion, the ban should have beenformulated in an opposite way, as he writes Abba Mari:And in this our decrees have been of no use, for the preacher does notpreach on [the Aristotelian books] On Things Heard, On the Heavens,On the Universe, Meteorology, On Generation and Corruption, OnSense and Sensibilia, On the Soul, and Metaphsyics. Some of themhave never read a page of these books, only whatever they read in the130•Chapter Fifteen"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"honorable book [Guide of the Perplexed], in Sefer Hamalmad and inthe Commentary on Ecclesiastes, in Ma’amar Yikavu Hamayim, andin other books both old and new. For they see there certain allegoriesand they too work skillfully, they try their hand at all that their soul de-sires, for there is no height too lofty for them, and they conjoin oneword to another. The result is that you our champion [Abba Mari]“blesses the main thing and exempts the negligible”; this is not the wayto remove them from sin, and as a result it misses your desired, honor-able and necessary intention. For the matter of the learning of [thoseAristotelian] books, involve many difficulties. . . . Therefore, we ig-nore the corruption which is current and the evil that spreads each dayamong thousands of people. For now among the preachers a new sectsprings up each day, and they recite their songs and go on their way.And instead we have latched on to the uncommon thing, in which cor-ruption is rare. (Hoshen Mishpat, pp. 166–167)Study of the philosophical books is possible only for individuals, be-cause of the great difficulty in their comprehension. These compositionsdo not serve the preachers, who for the most part have no understandingwhatsoever of the philosophical sources. Guide of the Perplexed, thebooks written by the Tibon family, and the work of Ya’akov Anatoli werethe true sources of inspiration for the preachers. If the struggle of AbbaMari had focused on opposition of exotericism, a problem that also con-cerned HaMeiri, then he should have directed the ban against philosoph-ical sermons and not against philosophy itself.There was an additional dispute between HaMeiri and Abba Mari,which indicates differences of emphasis and sensitivity within the Mai-monidean rabbinic movement, and which resulted in a deep cleavagewithin the group during the struggle over the ban. HaMeiri, as we haveseen, was partner to the criticism of exotericism and philosophical ser-mons and even fought against them, “whether through agreement orthrough bans and oaths.” He opposed, however, the additional and cen-tral element of the ban: age restrictions on the study of philosophicaltexts. From his point of view, such study is restricted to the elite anywayand does not constitute a breaking of the esoteric code. HaMeiri was pre-pared to take the risk inherent in early exposure to philosophical culture,the denial of creation ex nihiloand divine providence, for without suchexposure, knowledge would die out: “For if one stumbles in his studyonce or twice, then he, by his sins, will be cut off and uprooted. But whythen should wisdom die out? Were the gates of pardeslocked when Elishaben Abuya left them, breaching, deserting, and destroying?” (HoshenMishpat, p. 162).

Third, one cannotmerit learning from all, and those who know the secrets of wisdom arebut the few among the few—one from a town and two from a family, andif there be no time restrictions, they will learn whatever they find. . . .And if there be time restrictions, when he reaches that time, a bettertime may have already passed. (Hoshen Mishpat, pp. 165–166)The difficult circumstances of life and the scarcity of worthy teachersrequire that philosophy be studied whenever it can, even at an early age.In spite of the accusation brought by opponents of the ban againstAbba Mari and his circle, that they deviated from the Provencal rabbinictradition, the members of the circle of Abba Mari saw themselves as thefaithful successors to the Maimonidean esoteric conception.13Their self-understanding, which their struggle accorded with the terms of this tradi-tion, is formulated most explicitly in Rabbi Shimon ben Yosef’s responseto the letter of HaMeiri. This response expresses the deep disappoint-ment of Abba Mari and his circle from HaMeiri’s response, since they,the followers of the rabbinic Maimonidean tradition in Provence, sawHaMeiri as a natural ally. They claimed that HaMeiri was incited by theiropponents and distorted their intention.14The esoteric conception of AbbaMari and his circle is clearly emphasized in one of the most illuminatingpassages of Rabbi Shimon’s response to HaMeiri’s arguments againstAbba Mari: “And before the master the Rabbi [Rashba] you sought toprove the well-foundedness of your case, thus casting wisdom beforemockers and its students to perdition.” He responded to this argument asfollows:For our brother [Abba Mari] has a portion and inheritance with you in wisdom, and let your ears hear his love and compassion for her [wis-dom]. Lest improper persons attack and reveal her nakedness he joinedthe opinion of the Rabbi [Rashba] and ordered the youths not to ap-proach her until they grow up and see her glory and the glory of God,in whose service are peace and tranquility. They shall behave with heras is customary among ladies, to take her and betroth her. No cries ofdesperation shall be heard in her borders. Who then has cast wisdomto perdition and its learners to the mockers, if not the youth who learns132•Chapter Fifteen"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"not, who makes his way in the Greek sea and sails unknown courses instormy waters? Our brother [Abba Mari] did not shake the earth toannul wisdom, and did not trample its border. He did not think of ren-dering the pure impure or declaring the creeping thing pure. Foramong the heads of the people who had unnatural relations with her[wisdom], their sin and the guilt testify that she fabricated lies. . . .What shall we do for our sister on the day that one speaks of her? Forthey tell tales about her, both her servants and her hirelings? Blessed bethose people who take pity upon her honor, and keep guard over herand do not allow the evil one to become privy to her secrets. Blessed bethe man whose Torah study teaches him to close the gate behind her.(Hoshen Mishpat, p. 150)The metaphor of wisdom as a woman in Rabbi Shimon’s writing re-flects another fascinating development. The Rashba, Abba Mari’s ally,calls wisdom the daughter of a foreign god, whereas Rabbi Shimon turnswisdom into a lady, a princess whose glory is on the interior. In his words,Abba Mari does not cast out wisdom, but rather is her lover, contrary toHaMeiri’s accusation. Through the prohibition of early and public studyof philosophy, he protects her from those who would expose her beforethe eyes of all and thus defile her. In his words: “Those who have unnat-ural relations with her.” The return to esotericism is not an attempt tomarginalize philosophy, but rather to strengthen it by claiming that ladywisdom is worthy only of the king: “Her face shall not be seen except byhe whose soul has been purified.” The dissemination of wisdom is de-picted in vivid colors as the violation and humiliation of the princesswhom all may abuse.15The ability to turn the metaphor on its head—from daughter of a foreign god to princess—demonstrates the ambiguityinherent in esotericism. The ban on early study and uncontrolled expo-sure of philosophy might be seen as a first step in the expulsion of wis-dom, or else as a desperate attempt to preserve her honor. The complexweb of alliances, like that between the Rashba and Abba Mari, of shift-ing loyalties and accusations, of varying and sometimes contradictory in-terpretations given to those very alliances—this entire network is basedon the double meaning inherent in the guarding and concealment of abody of knowledge.The central figures active in the dispute over philosophy and esoteri-cism were halakhic masters, and they confronted each other over the def-inition of the limits of the transmission and dissemination of philosophi-cal knowledge. This phenomenon parallels the attempt of kabbalists whowere halakhic scholars and rabbinic authorities to define the Kabbalah asan esoteric realm, among other reasons in order to keep it within theirprovince, as an area that would not compete with the structure of studyThe Ambivalence of Secrecy•133"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"and the traditional principles of authority. The halakhic masters we dis-cussed above attempted to hedge in and confine philosophical activitywithin differing strictures of esotericism: Abba Mari through his struggleagainst philosophical sermons and the philosophical curriculum, andHaMeiri by taking exception to philosophical sermons. The dispute overphilosophy and esotericism were a political and communal expression ofthe tension between esotericism and exotericism. This tension increasedsteadily throughout the thirteenth century and reached a boiling point inthe early fourteenth century.134•Chapter Fifteen"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 16Esotericism, Discontent, and Co-ExistenceEsoteric doctrine, as we have seen, was the most unguarded area ofthe tradition, precisely because it was the most guarded and protected ofall. Secrecy is the medium that enables integration of different culturalcontexts into the tradition. Under the cloak of esotericism, radically con-flicting positions were integrated into the heart of Judaism. Each of thesepositions granted totally different significance to the meaning of halakhahand the system of Jewish beliefs. But as long as each side guarded itsTorah secrets in secret, the radical multiplicity of competing and conflict-ing positions could be tolerated. The open and revealed level enabled aco-existence based on mutual respect for secrecy. Within the same con-gregation and in the same synagogue, people who completely rejectedeach other’s views might be found together; but this, on condition thatthe conflicting sides preserved their esoteric doctrines at a proper distancefrom the revealed side of their worldviews.This imposed tolerance of the esoteric was made possible in part by itsambivalent structure. Esotericism supports two interpretations: on the onehand, the esoteric contents are accorded superior status, and thus mustbe protected; on the other hand, they seem to be foolishness or even heresy,so that if they cannot be uprooted from the world completely, at leastthey should remain closed and enigmatic. Thus, the Rashba was preparedto support philosophy, as long as it remained a hidden subject whosefaithful would not try to disseminate it among the larger Jewish public. It would seem that this co-existence could be preserved, since the bearersof the philosophical tradition also agreed that this realm should beguarded in secret, although for entirely different reasons. This fragile struc-ture of co-existence collapsed, however, once the esoteric tradition tra-versed the boundaries of secrecy and leaked out onto the surface. This leak-ing had several expressions: differing degrees of transparency in writing,public sermons, and the creation of a basic curriculum based on the prin-ciples of Torah secrets.The history of Jewish culture in the thirteenth century and in the earlyfourteenth century manifests a strong link between disclosure and dispute.Great and violent struggles took place when the concealed traditionsceased guarding the esoteric code in one measure or another. When theesotericists turned outward, they set in motion a chain reaction that led"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"to severe confrontation. The Rashba, who was a devout esotericist inkabbalistic matters, sought to establish co-existence by reversing theprocess of disclosure. But after a lengthy process of widening the aper-tures of the showpiece, as Ibn Tibon called it, the attempt to reestablishthe borders of secrecy proved to be anachronistic. The devotees of philo-sophical culture were not prepared to compromise their accomplishments.They interpreted what was offered them, under the guise of guardingTorah secrets, as an attempt to marginalize their culture, and to relegateit to the status of a sectarian, marginal, and closed culture. The exact sameprocess took place in the third and fourth decades of the thirteenth cen-tury, with the writing down of the kabbalistic tradition. This writing ledto a severe struggle, culminating in the burning of kabbalistic manu-scripts by Rabbi Meshulam ben Moshe and his nephew, Rabbi Meir benShimon. Isaac the Blind’s attempt at restoring the crown to its previousglory, as well as the esoteric position of Nahmanides and his disciples,could not close the breach. The bursting open of the boundaries of secrecy is fueled by an internal dynamic that brought the esotericists toalmost total disclosure. Indeed, in Gerona and in Castile, an entirely dif-ferent approach to the esoteric question transformed the tradition intoliterature.Not only did the attempt to reinstate the previous boundaries of se-crecy fail, but the attempt itself resulted in excessive dissemination ofTorah secrets. This was one of the points raised by HaMeiri against AbbaMari’s appeal to the Rashba. HaMeiri heard a rumor that Abba Marihad revealed to the Rashba hidden things from the manuscripts of one ofthe sages of Provence. In his opinion, had Abba Mari merely reportedabout the public philosophical sermons, which would have been badenough. But Abba Mari compounded his sin by exposing the esoteric tra-dition of philosophy in Provence:It was told in our ears that you [Abba Mari] wrote in your letter to ourmaster, the Rabbi [Rashba], that after the death of one of the sages,who is one of the best-known among us during his life in good deedsand piety and fear of sin, it was found among his books and the trea-sures of his writings that Abraham and Sarah are hints of matter andspirit, and that the tribes hint at the twelve signs of the zodiac. Weheard as well that our master, the Rabbi [Rashba], publicized this in aletter he sent out. And you [Abba Mari], the man who is perched upona lofty cedar of Lebanon, diverted from your goal and intention to in-form our master, the Rabbi, of the content of the sermons, and insteadhad told him of the content of the books and hidden scrolls which mayonly be read by select individuals. And in your great intelligence youshowed him what may be seen from the inside, rather than informing136•Chapter Sixteen"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"him only what can be seen from the outside and may be heard by allwhether wise or foolish. (Hoshen Mishpat, pp. 153–155)The careful guarding of esotericism expresses preservation of culturalautonomy in the face of external criticism; according to HaMeiri, the rev-elation of secret scrolls damages the communal autonomy of Provence.We may call the twelfth and thirteenth centuries “the centuries of con-cealment and revelation of Jewish creativity.” The writings of the centralthinkers of this period, Ibn Ezra, Maimonides, and Nahmanides, whichreflect the important movements in medieval Judaism, are all esotericcommentaries of the hidden layer of the Jewish canon. The expansion ofthe esoteric idea was accompanied by constant testing of its boundariesand by tension between the concealed and the revealed. In the midst ofthis tension, several fundamental problems arose within the various eso-teric traditions: the nature of knowledge—is it open or closed? The man-ner of transmission of knowledge—from controlled oral transmission tohinting, to the creation of a literature and sermons; the depth of stratifi-cation of the learning public; the competition of esoteric circles with halakhic masters and the traditional curriculum; and, finally, the mutualrelationships between the different secret traditions that co-existed along-side each other.We may now return to the question we raised at the beginning of thebook: Why did the esoteric idea become such an important phenomenonin the major trends of Jewish thought in the Middle Ages? Leo Strauss,who devoted his attention to the existence of the esoteric phenomenon,attempted to explain the esoteric phenomenon in terms of the tension be-tween philosophy and society. The philosopher protects himself and thesociety by going underground. Certainly this is one of the elements of the medieval esoteric phenomenon, but it is a limited explanation of thephenomenon both in terms of its scope and in terms of its subtlety andcomplexity. Strauss, who began his investigation through the reading ofGuide of the Perplexed, placed Maimonides within a tradition of philo-sophical esotericism, a tradition ushered in by Plato and continued untilSpinoza and the unfortunate decline in modern philosophy. Yet the me-dieval esoteric project, of which Maimonides was a part, encompassed avariety of trends in which the philosophical pursuit of rational inquiry isjust one among many. Nahmanides and Ibn Ezra, representing Kabbalahand astrology, were also deeply immersed in the esoteric project. The es-otericism of Guide of the Perplexedhas to be examined as well throughthat prism of a major cultural and religious occupation with the hidden,which cut across various theological points of view. What they all sharein developing and expanding the concealed realm, as I explain below, is asense of acute crisis.Esotericism, Discontent, and Co-Existence•137"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"The focus on the self-preservation of the philosopher fails to addressnot only the scope of the phenomenon but its ambiguity and subtlety.Maimonides’ constant preoccupation with his own esotericism, declaringthat he conceals a hidden doctrine for his own protection and the protec-tion of the masses, and his enumeration of the techniques of his conceal-ment, is a rather suicidal policy if what motivates him is self-preservation.This problem is magnified when we discover his constant preoccupationwith the limits of secrecy, which accompanies the esoteric idea itself. Theincredible speed with which revealed esoteric traditions became the ethosof entire communities demands explanation. If the question of the protec-tion of the freedom of knowledge was at the center of the esoteric realm,why then were the esotericists themselves so publicly preoccupied withthe idea of concealment and its existence time and time again? Why didan entire literature arise in the thirteenth century around esoteric tradi-tions that were to be transmitted orally or written down in fuzzy chapterheadings? Furthermore, during the fourteenth century, dozens of compo-sitions were written solely with the sole purpose of explaining the esoterichints in the writings of Ibn Ezra, Guide of the Perplexed, and Nahmanides’commentaries. It is true that it is difficult to keep secrets, but we must remember that this difficulty largely depends on the desire of the secretkeeper to expose more than a small portion of it. Thus, the esoteric, whichwas to represent the internal meaning of the tradition, expanded steadilyand expropriated more and more of the surface or revealed tradition. In the fourteenth century, only a thin shell remained of the revealed layer.The core of the secret doctrine in these centuries was not the survival ofthe esotericists by going underground, as Strauss supposed, but rather theuse of the medium of secrecy in order to absorb and introduce new the-ologies into the heart of Judaism.The rise of esoteric teachings is linked to a crisis, to discontent with therevealed layer of the Torah. Secrecy enables the absorption and integra-tion of new elements, because its very existence expands the receptivity of authoritative texts to new meanings by an immeasurable quotient.Furthermore, as a result of what was called above the paradox of esoteri-cism, it is precisely becausethe secret is guarded that one may attributeto it layers substantially different from the revealed layer of the tradition.The power of the esoteric as a medium of absorption is increased becausean idea that penetrates the secret realm enjoys the privileged status of theinternal foundation of religion. In spite of the tremendous differences be-tween different conceptions of secrecy, all of them share a discontent withthe worldview that medieval Jews inherited from the biblical and talmu-dic traditions. Astrology, philosophy, and Kabbalah all confronted bibli-cal and talmudic anthropomorphism—in Ibn Ezra by emphasizing thehermetic and astrological elements of a causal nature; in Maimonides by138•Chapter Sixteen"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"establishing the Aristotelian concept of nature and creating a constanttension between wisdom and will; and in Kabbalah through the complexorganic structure of the godhead, whose balance is causally dependent onman’s theurgic actions. Each movement presented an entirely differentconcept of the causal mechanism, but all of them confront the concept ofGod as a personality, in one way or another, with a deep level of causality.Being, we might say, combats personality. The deeper we penetrate the esoteric layers, it becomes apparent that the search for casual explana-tion is at the heart of the esoteric project. The biblical and rabbinic under-standing that history, law, and nature are expressions of the covenantalrelationship between two personalities, God and Israel, became an inad-equate picture for the medieval Jewish esoteric elites. The world of Athens,mediated through Arabic philosophy and science, which posited causalityand being as the ultimate explanation, penetrated to the heart of Judaism.Despite all the deep differences between kabbalists and philosophers,they share a weighty cultural fact: the dominance given to nature as thecentral explanatory category. The religious activity in which this raptureis most manifested is the revolution in the understanding of prayer. In itsessence, prayer is an act of appeasing and convincing, which in its detailsis based on the interpersonal relationship that exists between humansand God, like a slave appeasing his master or a child attempting to con-vince a parent. In the medieval period, the status of prayer as an expres-sion of an interpersonal relationship begins to disappear. From an activ-ity of convincing and appeasing it became a complex causal activation inthe kabbalistic tradition, or a meditative contemplative exercise reflectingphilosophical trends. Those medieval movements upon which the eso-teric concept left no mark teach us much about the other movements. Inthe commentaries on Scripture of Rashi or the Rashbam, there is no eso-teric level,1primarily because they were devoid of the consciousness ofcrisis and confusion when faced with the revealed layer of the text.2Rashidid have an esoteric tradition, which was restricted to the creation storyand the chapters on the chariot in Ezekiel. In many ways, his esotericconception was similar to the Hekhalot literature. But the idea of the es-oteric as an accompanying level of meaning, which runs parallel to thesurface of the text and which transforms the very meaning of tradition, iscompletely absent from Rashi’s writings. Such an understanding of theesoteric project was limited to the medieval elites who were strugglingwith an urgent sense of crisis.This composition dealt with the esoteric idea and its development untilthe early fourteenth century. The termination of the discussion at this pointin time is not entirely arbitrary, since in the twelfth and thirteenth centuriesthe question of concealment and revelation was at the center of Jewishthought. A systematic consideration of this question in the fourteenthEsotericism, Discontent, and Co-Existence•139"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"century and afterward is beyond the scope of the current discussion. It is,however, worthwhile to raise several general points, which have wider con-ceptualramifications for the problem of esotericism, and which concernmainly the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and the modern period.The phenomenon that characterizes medieval Jewish thought—the pre-occupation with Torah secrets and the use of the idea of the esoteric as abasic hermeneutic position—is completely absent from Jewish thought inthe modern period. Moses Mendelssohn, Hermann Cohen, Martin Buber,Franz Rosenzweig, Abraham Joshua Heschel, Joseph Dov Soloveitchik,and others never claimed they were attempting to clarify Torah secrets,that the community they addressed was divided, or that they themselvesemployed techniques of concealment. While we may characterize the dif-ference between medieval thought and modern thought in many ways,the discussion of esotericism focuses our attention on one essential differ-ence: the absence of the idea of secrecy in modern Jewish thought, as op-posed to its centrality in the Middle Ages. The absence of an element ofsecrecy from modern Jewish thought deprives this thought of a powerfulhermeneutic tool, which endowed medieval thought with extraordinaryflexibility. Medieval thought had a far more radical character than mod-ern thought, since through the esoteric idea it transformed the astrologi-cal, Gnostic, Aristotelian, or Neoplatonic cultural contexts into the innerand deep meaning of Judaism. Furthermore, medieval thought presenteda far larger variety of essentially conflicting positions in comparison withthe modern period, as a result of what we have described as the paradoxof esotericism, that is, the unguarded nature of the esoteric realm. Theabsence of the esoteric idea in the modern period thus has a restrictive effect, and we must raise the question: why did such a central elementvanish in the modern period?One answer is linked to the change in the dissemination of knowledge,which took place as a result of the invention of print, from the sixteenthcentury on. Print undermined the closed frameworks of teaching and ini-tiation and the local nature of tradition. In the early fourteenth century,Shem Tov Ibn Gaon defined the esoteric ethic as involving teaching “fromauthors and not from books,” even though this ethos had already beenweakened during the second half of the thirteenth century. The relianceon oral initiation became almost meaningless in the age of print, in whichthe book became an item of mass production, so that from the sixteenthcentury on, the structure of transmission of knowledge in traditionalJewish society changed completely.3Another answer goes beyond the revolutionary changes in the possibil-ities of dissemination of knowledge from the sixteenth century onwardand is related to the Enlightenment movement of the modern period, whichmade the idea of transparency a central element of their worldview.140•Chapter Sixteen"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"Knowledge was supposed to be based on solid foundations, clear to anyknowledgeable person. This would enable the construction of a frame-work that would uproot ignorance and enlighten the furthest corners ofsociety with the light of knowledge. In the modern ideology of the enlight-enment, the very existence of the masses is seen as the essential problem,and not the guarding of knowledge from the masses. Even if not all thestreams of modern Jewish thought are committed to the ideals of enlight-enment, the absence of the esoteric as a legitimate philosophical categoryinfluenced Jewish thought. This category is not at the service of modernJewish thinkers, as it was in the Middle Ages, and they cannot divide the community of their readers into an elite and the masses. The assump-tion of esotericism of the Middle Ages, which enabled the flourishing ofthe idea of secrecy, was that, under conditions of total transparency, so-ciety would disintegrate. This assumption is in fundamental contradictionwith the idea of the enlightenment, and particularly in opposition to thepolitical ethos of democratic societies which promote transparency. It isat this point of departure entering the modern condition that I wish toturn my gaze from the historical analysis to the conceptual and philo-sophical concerns.Esotericism, Discontent, and Co-Existence•141"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 17Taxonomy and Paradoxes of Esotericism: Conceptual ConclusionIThe historical material examined thus far gives rise to three kinds of eso-tericism which will guide the taxonomy of the hidden and concealed—theinternal, the instrumental, and the essential. The primary motivatingforce for the existence of an esoteric hidden domain is based on an inter-nal non-instrumental motivation that establishes a connection between thetranscendence and the hidden, or in reverse between exposure and viola-tion. Unlike internal non-instrumental arguments, instrumental reasons foresotericism argue for the problematic consequences of revealing knowl-edge. The procedure of producing nuclear bombs, for example, shouldnot be disclosed since it will fall in the hands of irresponsible, cruel leaders.The internal non-instrumental argument advances a more fundamental,stronger claim, asserting that the body of knowledge itself will be trans-formed and diminished by its disclosure. Two different motivations forprotecting privacy shed light on this distinction. Privacy might be pro-tected for instrumental reasons, when betrayal of trust will cause futureharm to someone. It might as well be protected because exposure itselfdiminishes the value of the subject or the relationships at stake. Theremight be an essential difference for securing privacy in lawyer-client rela-tionship, and securing privacy in the context of a therapist and a patient.This internal motivation is attached to complex relations between thehidden and the surface that are expressed in the most fundamental struc-ture of the self. In a situation of total transparency, without any conceal-ment, it would be impossible to maintain a bounded self, since the self asa bounded entity exists because it is concealed. If a person’s thoughtswere written on his forehead, exposed before all, the distinction betweeninterior and exterior would vanish, and with it also individuation. Pri-vacy, expressed through the possibility of concealment, thus protects thevery ability of a person to define himself as an individual. Furthermore,the self may create special relationships by displaying differential mea-sures of exposure and intimacy. He moves through social space by allot-ting revelation and concealment and establishing differential measures ofdistance and closeness. Thus, the self defines himself and distinguishes"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"between friends and others and between intimates and strangers, throughthe privileged position he has to his interiority.Improper exposure, contrary to a person’s will, results in shame, andevery moment of shame, even the slightest, is a profound wound to one’sconsciousness of boundedness, a sort of death blow. The possibility of experiencing shame is a self-protective emotion in its most basic form. In this sense, it was pointed out that shame is to be differentiated fromguilt. Guilt is expressed in the desire to clean a stain that sticks to a per-son, and expresses the need to reinstate the self that has been sullied.Shame, by contrast, colors the entire self. Shame does not stain, but de-files the entire surface. It arouses the desire to disappear and be effaced,because it results from an injury to the tissues that constitute the self andits boundaries.Philosophers who have dealt with shame argue about the degree towhich an outside perspective is constitutive of the emotion of shame.Some phenomenological accounts argue that such perspective is not con-stitutive to shame since it can be internalized by the agent, looking athimself as if from the outside. Yet there are cases which constitute thecore of shame where the outside gaze is essential to the emotion of shame.A distinction between primary and secondary shame might shed light onthis problem. Primary shame which has its roots in the experience of ex-posure concerns a state or an event that is not inherently wrong as suchso long as it is not observed in the improper context. The covering ofnakedness is the archetypal example of primary shame. There is nothingwrong with nakedness as such; rather, the emotion of shame is created bycondition of improper exposure. Similarly, there is nothing wrong withsinging aloud in the shower or posing before a mirror, although somemight feel shame or embarrassment when they have been perceived doingeither. Secondary shame is a case in which something is wrong in the actor the person as such, even when not being observed, and the exposure ofsuch events or deficiencies causes that added pain of shame.To further clarify the distinction, we can refer to Sartre’s example ofsomeone who peeks through a keyhole and thus transgresses the limits ofprivacy while at the same time someone else passes by and sees him com-mitting this act.1Let us expand the story and imagine that the door sud-denly opens and that the person inside, who had been naked, realizes thathe had been watched. There are two people here who experience shame,the one in the room who was watched while naked, and the person whowas observed watching. Each of them experiences a different kind ofshame, which is manifested in the different role that the observer has inconstituting the shame. The person who was observed peeking internalizesthe observer’s point of view concerning him. In such a case the outsideeye does not play a constitutive role in shame; it is triggering a shift inParadoxes of Esotericism•143"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"self-perception, which the person who is watched is experiencing. He hasbeen made to perceive himself watching. He was shaken from his immer-sion in the act into a position of realization that is caused by looking athimself from the outside. We can imagine that such person might be at-tacked by an emotion of shame, even without an outside observer, in acase in which he found himself observing his own actions as if from a dis-tance. Such a change of self-perception might occur without the trigger ofan outside eye.In the case of the person who was naked inside the room the role of theoutside eye is far more constitutive. In such a case of what I called primaryshame, the observer is constitutive in a stronger sense, since he causes atransformation in the description of the thing exposed, which is not thecase in secondary shame. Nudity becomes a concern when it is improp-erly observed; it is the contact with the eye that makes it shameful. Theoutside eye does not have the mere role triggering a transformation ofself-perception; in such a case it is perception that counts rather than self-perception. In that respect, because of the constitutive role of the observer,shame and guilt are clearly distinguishable in cases of primary shame butnot in secondary shame.There could be delicate and nuanced shifts from primary shame to sec-ondary and vice versa. In certain cultures nakedness might become asource for secondary shame, viewing the body itself as the source of sin.Augustine’s reading of the passages in Genesis of the original sin and thefall is such an example. According to his interpretation, the fall causedthe erotic drive to become independent of our will. While before the orig-inal sin Adam had erection at will in the same way that he could move hishand at will, after the fall the sexual drive became a force inhabiting theperson independent of his direct will. The body therefore turned into ashameful object onto itself, reminding ourselves that we are at the mercyof a blind force that emerges regardless of our will. According to Augus-tine, the source of shame of nakedness lies in the fact that the erotic drivecaptures our mental field and controls our actions, a paradigm for ourloss of control. This is the reason why humans cover their sexual organsand why humans have intercourse only in private. Augustine turns whatseems to be a primary shame, in which nakedness is a source of shameonly when perceived by an undesired eye, into a secondary shame in whichnakedness, regardless of the observer, is shameful. In radical shame cul-tures, if they exist altogether, the opposite shift happens. Every secondaryshame is a case of a primary one. There is nothing wrong in doing a par-ticular act, but in being observed and exposed concerning doing it.Improper exposure and shame are connected to the self experiencing a loss of his capacity to control the basic most rudimentary forms of hisappearance. Ongoing forced exposure transforms shame into humiliation144•Chapter Seventeen"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"since it touches upon a primary sense of helplessness; the inability to de-cide upon when and how to appear.2The practice of forced nakedness asa form of humiliation robs the person of the primary space and power toform a “persona.” While secondary shame is about a loss of self-esteem,primary shame is not concerned with such a loss because there was noth-ing wrong to begin with in the practice of behavior that was exposed,only the exposure itself. We might say that primary shame harms our ca-pacity for any esteem, since self-esteem depends upon our capability ofpresenting ourselves.Rousseau mourned the gap between reality and appearance as the es-sential condition of the human fall. Lack of transparency is the source ofmistrust, misunderstanding, and alienation. In the attempt to appear dif-ferent from who we are and emerge as properly socialized creatures, wepay the price of estrangement from ourselves as from others. The veil be-tween reality and appearance is not only constructed by the self. Costumesare forced on us from the outside as well when we are misinterpreted,and intentions and motivations are attributed falsely to us. It is for thisreason that Rousseau yearns for the childlike natural state of transparency,before self-awareness forces upon us the burden of appearance and shame.HisConfessionsserve a redemptive purpose; they are postulated by himas a heroic exemplar of an attempt to bridge the hidden with the revealed.3Yet Rousseau’s utopia of a community where we are all transparent toone another appears to be a rather harsh, intolerable, and self-defeatingstate of affairs. Lack of transparency is indeed a source of mistrust and itunravels bonds of friendship, yet the value of trust and friendship woulddisappear altogether in conditions of full transparency. If there was no in-teriority and our thoughts, intentions, and desires would emerge writtenon our forehead, trust would not be a virtue, and intimacy would evapo-rate altogether. Needless to say our sense of wonder, surprise, and revela-tion will be diminished, as well as the possibility to indulge privately inwhat is publicly burdensome and inappropriate.4The concept of internal esotericism enables a deeper grasp of the urgeto revelation that is inherent in concealment, a feature that appeared atdifferent moments in the historical material that has been examined. Thisdialectic of concealment and revelation is connected to the phenomeno-logical juxtaposition of intimacy and shame. Intimacy is reached at thepoint in which ordinary barriers of shame are shed; it emerges in the do-mains that are protected by the mechanism of shame. It is therefore im-possible to achieve intimacy when such areas do not exist to begin with,as in the case of a shameless person. The connection of intimacy to thedomain which is ordinarily protected by shame makes past intimacy sus-ceptible to retroactive shame, when what seems to be at the time a properdisclosure, given a change in perspective or conditions, looks retroactivelyParadoxes of Esotericism•145"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"as a cause for shame. The genuine opposite of shame is not shamelessnessbut intimacy.The reversal of shame in intimacy is manifested both in primary andsecondary shame. An exposure that might be perceived in relation to another subject as the violation of individuation and transgression ofboundaries is experienced in a proper intimate context as an evocation ofpresence, a way out of isolation. The desire to disappear which accompa-nies that sense of violation of boundaries is replaced by an acute sense ofbeing, though hesitant. It is for that reason that intimacy cannot beforced since the intimate context is an exposure that does not undermineour capacity to have a persona. In cases of secondary shame as was ana-lyzed above, the observer does not occupy a constitutive role. He is a trig-ger for a change in self-perception, a transformation that might be achievedwithout the observer as well. In secondary shame the situation perceivedis itself problematic; it is not made as such by the fact of it being per-ceived. Intimacy, when it relates to the realm of secondary shame, is thecapacity to expose a wrong to another person without it causing a harm-ful change in self-esteem. It is in some circumstances the opposite: self-revelation is done with the expectation of affirmation and trust. The observer, in an intimate circumstance, is supposed to support a change in the opposite direction which is triggered by the shaming eye; his eyemight reconstitute a broken self. The quest for affirmation and comfort inareas that might in fact be prone to potential shame is what bonds conceal-ment to revelation.It is no wonder that concealment and revelation are attached in theirprimary mode to this non-instrumental internal form, in which improperexposure is onto itself a kind of violation. The internal conception of eso-tericism which is motivated by the relationship between exposure and violation emerged within the early mystical corpus of the Hekhalot litera-ture, and within the Zohar’s conception of the hidden and concealed. IntheZoharthis internal esoteric conception is developed within the eroticanalogy, and in the Hekhalot literature it emerges within the politicalframework. The Zoharperceives the deeper layers of Torah as God’s ownbody uncovered in the interpretative act. The multilayered text that bothrevealsand conceals is conceived in terms of the erotic subtle movement of intimacyand alienation. In such an outlook the problem of exposureand dissemination of knowledge is not focused on some grave dangersthat might result from such acts. The very act of improper exposure is itself a violation and diminishment of the subject and the relationships involved, in similar ways that pornography might be a diminishment ofhonor and love.This primary non-instrumental conception of restricting disclosure isenlarged as well into the political realm of authority and power within146•Chapter Seventeen"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"the Hekhalot structure of concealment. In this body of literature, expo-sure is diminishment of transcendence and status. In the ethics of vision,which is shaped by the idea of the God who is hidden from the eye, asym-metry in the possibilities of vision gives rise to a relation of authority andsublimity. The more powerful partner may survey the one standing oppo-site him from head to toe, whereas the weaker one averts his glance, hes-itating to create eye contact. The fear of being noticed is immanent to theorganization of sight and the hierarchy of power. One of the rules soldierslearn in basic training is to avoid eye contact with their superiors. Beingnoticed through such eye contact might put the fresh soldier at risk ofbeing picked on, examined, and used as an example for disciplining. It isindeed the case that the awful fate of Job began with one sentence thatGod uttered to the Satan: “Have you noticed my servant Job, for there isno one like him on earth” (Job 1:8). At the moment Satan was drawn tonotice him, Job had been trapped in the net of disaster.The more a person may see others, without being seen by them, the fur-ther his status is elevated; the inverse is also true. Social status is expressedthrough varying degrees of privacy, for example, through the expanse ofspace surrounding a person, in which access to others is restricted. A per-son’s status rises in direct proportion to the size of the personal space al-lotted him. Overrepresentation is therefore a way of dispelling the auraof a subject or object. Walter Benjamin’s insight concerning the fate ofartistic objects in an age of reproduction applies to political authority aswell. Gossip of lower classes serves such a compensatory humanizingrole, and malicious exposure of the ruler’s embarrassing moments fromslipping to mispronouncing might become a real step in lightening his potential gravitas.It is interesting to note that there are cases in which the opposite struc-ture is manifested. Servants are allowed to observe and listen to extremelyintimate matters, and they are not seen at all by their surroundings. Insuch a case the inferior status of someone is manifested by the fact thathis perspective does not make any difference. Losing status as a subjectmeans that in such a case someone is marginalized to a degree that hedoes not cause another person before him to internalize his perspective,and to become self-aware. It might be said that servants see everythingbecause they are not seen, or more precisely because they are not noticed.Someone’s value might be completely diminished when he is no longer apotential source for causing shame, like a piece of furniture in the room.Such a process, of the erasure of the subjectivity of the other as a sourceof his capacity to observe without causing shame, takes a similar but sub-tler form in cases in which an exposure is legitimated given the particularrole that the observer is occupying. Physicians who examine an undressedpatient, artists who paint a nude model, or therapists who deal with theParadoxes of Esotericism•147"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"most intimate details of their patients’ lives serve as examples of an expo-sure that will normally cause shame and yet is legitimated without any re-course to intimacy. In all these cases the full subjectivity of the person whois observing is bracketed by a particular setup. The particular context ofrole playing defines the observer as “observing as” a physician, painter, ortherapist rather than merely observing. (Complete estrangement of theobserver might serve the same function as in a confession in front of arandom anonymous person, which is so powerfully described in Camus’snovelThe Fall.) Since the exposure was legitimated within the strictbounds of a particular role, a slight shift of perspective and a nuancedchange of role might cause shame and humiliation. Imagine the awkward-ness of the patient who meets his therapist at a dinner table, or even moreso the model who realizes by a shift in the painter’s gaze that he does notperceive her any more as a model but rather as a delightful object for hisviewing. Encounters that entail exposure that is commonly a source ofshame might therefore mistakenly be perceived by one of the parties to bean expression of intimacy, while the exposure is actually legitimated onlygiven a certain bracketing of the subject or even its complete erasure.Within the political and religious sphere one of the main functions of rit-ual is to serve as a protocol of access that protects such a moment of appeal and encounter from trespassing into violation of exposure. Whentranscendence and power is connected to concealment in this internalconception of esotericism, there is no wonder that a minute divergencefrom the protective canopy of the protocol might become dangerouslylethal.The relationship between representation and power are based on twoopposing strategies. The one is that nobody has seen the powerful, andthe other is that power is seen everywhere. Within segments of the biblicaltradition, God’s invisibility from human eyes does not derive from His essential formlessness, but rather results from the fact that the exposureof God’s form to the human eye blemishes his sublimity. This primarymotive of concealment places a severe limitation on the attempt to bridgethe fundamental biblical gap between the heard deity and the visibledeity. The esoteric is not a body of knowledge that may not be diffused.It is, first and foremost, the creation of a realm that no eye may behold,either in actuality or in its imagination. It is the hidden realm in the mostliteral sense of the word.This form of esotericism is vulnerable to a certain inner contradictionsince power, in order to exist, has to be made visible. As we shall see, sucha tension is just one manifestation of an internal problematic with thewhole esoteric project. The inner tension breaks open in the Hekhhalotliterature devoted to the attempt of the esoteric elite to transgress theboundaries of vision. The daring of this mystical journey is accompanied148•Chapter Seventeen"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"by an actual desire of the divine to emerge and appear from his isolation.Revelation is forced from that same reason that motivated concealment.One possible implication for this mode of internal esotericism is con-nected to democratic politics and its understanding of power. In moderndemocratic society, the ruler is approachable and visible, and he often ap-pears in the media. The authority of power, according to the concept oftransparency, is not supposed to be based on mystery and sublimity, butfrom argument, conviction, and consent. Every frontal appearance ofbearers of power in modern media, however, is a staged and planned per-formance, and the bearer of power is never seen as he is. The challengeposed by medieval political thought in its conception of esotericism is therelation between truth and society: Can the basic social institutions sur-vive under conditions of transparency? The modern solution presents aprofoundly ambiguous approach to the heart of that very question. Onthe one hand, enlightenment and transparency liberate us from depen-dence on the esoteric; on the other hand, that very value may create a better-camouflaged and complex secret, in which concealment hides the veryfact of its being concealed. I return to this problem below while investi-gating other modes of esotericism, but it is worthwhile here to point tothe problem of exposure and visibility.IIThe second mode of esotericism is the instrumental. It focuses on theharmful results of dissemination of knowledge and developed in part asa technique of writing and interpreting authoritative texts in a codedfashion. Leo Strauss focused on this kind of esotericism as an interpretivekey to the great texts of the philosophical tradition. Instrumental esoteri-cism has its roots in two different motivations, both problematic from ademocratic point of view. It may appear in a totalitarian oppressive situ-ation in which an author has to protect himself, and yet he wishes tocommunicate a subversive message to the initiate whom he trusts. Codedcommunication might be supported by another problematic source, thistime initiated by the author himself because of elitist considerations. Theauthor adopting esoteric strategy appeals to a divided audience: the initi-ated enlightened and the masses. By hinting and hiding his genuine inten-tion, he wishes to protect the reader who belongs to the multitude frompossibly harmful ideas rather than to protect himself.Both motivations appear in Maimonides’ Guide of the Perplexed, whichis of great value in understanding interpretative esotericism. Maimo-nides’ esotericism was rooted in an Islamic tradition inspired by Plato,which shared the conviction that myth is a necessity for social order.Paradoxes of Esotericism•149"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"Since philosophy is a systematic attempt to examine and criticize myth,the philosopher is in imminent tension with the Polis. For al-Farabi, Mai-monides, and ibn Rushed, the main source of such tension lay in the meta-physical attack on the anthropomorphic conception of God, as marshaledboth by the Aristotelians and Neoplatonists.These philosophical doctrines rejected the understanding of God as apersonality, and replaced personal attributes of God with attributes ofbeing such as “the unmoved mover,” “the necessary being,” or “the One.”The subverting of the anthropomorphic conception of God as a com-manding sovereign who supervises, punishes, and rewards endangers thevery existence of society. It enfeebles discipline and obedience to the law,which depends on the belief that there is a judge and a higher judgment,and that the evildoer will get his just deserts, even if he evades the ever-watchful eye of the worldly sovereign at the time that he commits the sin.Such a firm view, that society will collapse under conditions of epistemictransparency, especially in matters of religious beliefs, was common muchlater than the early medieval period and shared even by Spinoza andLocke. The first thinker to challenge this assumption was Paolo Sapri atthe beginning of the seventeenth century, and at his time he was a lonely,original voice that anticipated the claims of later enlightenment figuressuch as Pierre Bayle, David Hume, and Bernard Mandeville.5These fig-ures parted with the previous tradition of instrumental esotericism byclaiming that a society of moral atheists is possible, and that a belief in di-vine providence and retribution is not needed for the sake of social ordereven in regard to the multitude. The sacred authoritative texts, accordingto this prior Islamic and Jewish philosophical tradition, address thereforetwo audiences. The surface anthropomorphic level, which contains nec-essary beliefs, is directed to the masses; the inner esoteric meaning is directed to the elite. The practice of instrumentalesotericism gives rise to three internal tensions that put the esoteric project under a constantshadow of self-defeat. These tensions were implicitly articulated in theprevious chapters while discussing the historical material, and I wouldlike to bring them into clearer and sharper focus.The first paradoxical feature of esotericism emerges within medievalschools that claim that Scripture has a hidden coded meaning, whichthese schools reveal, though secretively. The first commentator to promotesuch a view was Abraham Ibn Ezra, and it was practiced in various writings, both philosophical and mystical, in the twelfth and thirteenthcenturies. According to the esoteric approach, the one who bears a par-ticular scientific knowledge can uncover the hidden meaning of the text. Toput it in Mainmonides’ terms, the perplexed student who is torn by the con-flict between the surface level of the tradition and his philosophical (Aris-totelian) convictions will find the harmony in the hidden layer of scripture.150•Chapter Seventeen"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"The esoteric realm became a powerful medium of integration of dominat-ing cultural paradigms into the heart of Judaism. It served as well as thebreeding ground for the most radical and diverse worldview that Judaismever produced. In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries the canopy of the concealed shieldeda astonishing diversity of astrologists, hermetics,Aristotelians, Neoplatonists, Gnostics, and others. The entry of these ap-proaches into the sacred and precious realm of the secret transformed Judaism from within. The canon of secrecy included the great texts of me-dieval Jewish thought—Maimonides’ Guide of Perplexedand Nahmanides’esoteric hints in his commentary on the Torah, each of them presenting acompletely different account of what it is to be a Jew. In that respect theesoteric medium was a mechanism of disintegration as well. These world-views, essentially hostile to one another, consumed more and more fromthe surface-shared meaning that kept the community intact.The addition of an esoteric level expands the text’s “receptive capacityto meaning” to almost infinite dimensions. What can be read into it be-comes far more varied and extreme. The esoteric idea provides a new andpowerful tool for exegesis as a means of receiving ideas and transformingthem into an integral part of the tradition. Thus, Maimonides could claimthat the Aristotelian worldview, which is, apparently, completely alien tothe surface meaning of the text, is in fact the internal meaning of that text.Esotericism is thus a powerful tool for the reception of a variety ofteachings, none of which can claim priority through reference to otherwritten texts or to the revealed tradition. At this point the paradox of es-otericism becomes apparent. The initial motivation for esotericism reflectsan attempt to preserve particular knowledge in a state of purity, withoutfault or distortion, as a protected, well-guarded realm not disseminatedto the uninitiated. Because, however, the esoteric realm is a closed one, it cannot be effectively controlled. An esotericist may claim that a newbody of knowledge is actually the transmission of an ur-ancient esotericJewish tradition. In response to those who dispute him, arguing that theyhad never heard of such a teaching in Jewish tradition, he would claim:“This knowledge was kept secret; consequently, it left no trace in the tra-ditions known to you.” Thus, the most guarded realm is also the least re-stricted. This paradox leaves its surprising marks at the stage at whichthe esoteric idea reaches its peak of development—in the Jewish works ofthe Middle Ages.Indeed, the absorption of widely varied teachings into Jewish traditionthrough the medium of esotericism lent them not only legitimacy as partof the canonical text, but also primacy. When such doctrines are under-stood as esoteric and enshrouded with the aura of secrecy, they becomeaccepted as the inner meaning of Judaism, so that they penetrate to themost influential levels of meaning of the tradition. Medieval Jewry wasParadoxes of Esotericism•151"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"characterized by a tradition of unusual intellectual flexibility as a resultof the medium of esotericism. Through this medium, it could digest theworldviews surrounding it, and these worldviews, with all their resultantramifications, became the inner and deepest meaning of Judaism in theeyes of its defenders.The paradox of esotericism, in which the most guarded aspect of a tra-dition or a text becomes the most open-ended (because it was guarded),is thus of enormous importance in understanding a central cultural dy-namic concerning the function of secrecy as a powerful uncontrolledmedium of integration.6This dynamic has important implications con-cerning the problem of concealment and interpretation at large, and ithighlights the second paradoxical aspect of the esoteric project.The second inherent tension in the esoteric project is connected to aself-defeating feature of the main medium of esoteric transmission—thehint or the sign. The coded sign or hint has to be opaque in order to hidethe message from the uninitiated. Yet it has to reveal enough so that itwould be noticed by the initiated and properly understood. If it is tooopaque, it has no interpretative weight. After all, the hidden layer in theinterpretive tradition of the Middle Ages became a placeholder for every-thing because it is hidden. To hide a secret too well or to bury it too deeplyin a text is therefore equivalent to the argument that it does not impactthe meaning of the text altogether. If it has no restrictive features on pos-sible meanings, it means nothing. The challenge of coded and concealedtexts is therefore to calibrate the hint to such a nuanced degree that it willhide enough from the uninitiated and reveal enough to the initiate.This fine line is in some ways the deepest problem of such a project al-together. If we take Leo Strauss as our example of the esoteric mode ofreading texts, the following example is enlightening. Strauss’s claim thatHobbes concealed his atheism is rather plausible and apparent. After all,he was a materialist. Yet Strauss’s argument that Locke concealed hisHobbesianism is far more problematic. If it is the case that no reader ofLocke realized this until Strauss discovered it, then what does it mean toargue that the secret of Locke’s argument is a Hobbesian outlook? Thesecret is either too apparent or too deeply buried.This inherent instability of the medium of the hint is manifested in another great historical transformation of an esoteric tradition of Kab-balah. The earliest kabbalists known to us in the middle of the twelfthcentury in Provence—Avraham ben Yitzhak and his son-in-law Avrahamben David—were great talmudic scholars but who in relation to theirmystical teachings were strict esotericists. The son of Avraham benDavid, Isaac the Blind, who wrote an important letter against the dissem-ination of Kabbalah in books, testified concerning his forefathers: “Formy forefathers were the nobles of the land and disseminators of the152•Chapter Seventeen"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"Torah among many, and no such thing [secrets of Kabbalah] ever departedfrom their lips. For they would act toward others as if they were notversed in wisdom [of the Kabbalah].” This tradition of strict esotericismwas soon relaxed by the students of Isaac the Blind—Ezra and Azriel ofGerona, who wrote some kabbalistic texts and letters at the beginning ofthe thirteenth century. The writings of these two mystics outraged theirmaster Isaac the Blind, and he wrote against such practices: “For I haveseen the sage and wise and pious who wagged their tongues and stretchedout their hands to write of great and awesome things in their books andletters.But what is written abides in no cabinet;and the books thus comeinto the hands of fools and mockers . . . and so it happened throughthem.” These opaque texts which were full of allusions and hints fell inthe hands of two groups: the opponents of Kabbalah that blamed thekabbalists for heresy and began a campaign against them, and the sup-porters and admirers of the kabbalists who were not trained enough andbegan independently to misinterpret and to expound falsely the meaningof these hints. As a result of this chain of events, the kabbalists wereforced to come up with a rather transparent text to clarify their positions.Within the time span of three generations, the esoteric tradition was un-covered by what might be called the dynamics of leaking; Kabbalah wastransformed from a well-guarded secret to a literary-exposed corpus. Thekabbalist Asher ben David, who was forced to explicate the tradition,blamed the previous authors for beginning to disseminate coded texts. Inhis bitter words he gave a beautiful formulation of the instability of sucha medium of coded text:For they have not the ability to speak or write in a way that satiates theinstructed while satisfying the needs of the fool, so that one not mis-lead the other with words that have two faces, by making their wordsobscure in places where they should not have, or by explaining toomuch in places where they would do better to conceal their secrets.Asher ben David raised a profound argument concerning the essential na-ture of the medium of hinting. This medium, by nature, suffers from aninternal problematic: if the hint is too transparent, it betrays its functionas a medium of concealment, and if it is too opaque, it does not add to theknowledge of the instructed one, or else it leads to erroneous understand-ings and false explanations. The hint seems to be fundamentally invalid,and it was better not to hint in writing at all. Once matters had beenmade public, however, Asher ben David had no choice but to unveil theentire picture and to shatter the barriers of writing entirely: “Thus, I al-lowed my tongue to wag, and my lips to speak, to make the knowledgeof our masters known to the many, for they taught us the paths of life, theParadoxes of Esotericism•153"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"ways of God, so that I may be innocent in the eyes of God and man”(Sefer Hayihud, p. 120).This inherent instability of the medium of the hint might seem to us tobe a problem confined to completely different modes of reading textswithin elitist or totalitarian contexts. It might be an intriguing concernfor the historians of philosophy or religion, but not for any of us. Yet weare engaged in a daily practice of this mode of interpretation when itcomes to psychological explanations. A great deal of the political dramaof esotericism as an interpretative strategy is internalized by psychoanaly-sis toward the self. The interpretative force of the analysis of dreams andsymptoms is dependent upon walking this fine line of concealment andrevelation. It is no wonder that Freud when seeking an analogue to histechnique of dream interpretation points to political censorship: “Whereshall we find a parallel to such an event? You need not look far in thesedays. Take up any political newspaper and you will find that here andthere the text is absent.”7Symbols in dreams, or behavioral symptoms,have to stand in complex relationship to what they represent. They haveto be attached enough to make sense, and detached enough to be camou-flaged. The failure of some such explanation is often rooted in the lack ofcapacity to calibrate this fine line.The instability of the hint points to a larger issue than interpretation,which leads us to the third paradoxical feature of esotericism that emergedfrom the historical material. In the complicated history of esotericism,transforming something into a secret is not necessarily endowing it withthe aura of the more real and precious. This inherent tension in esoteri-cism emerged in the chapter that dealt with the campaign against thespread of philosophy. The Rashba made use of the self-imposed esotericrestrictions on the teaching of philosophy as a tool in his fierce attempt toput it to oblivion. The concealed is also the repressed and the marginal-ized. It was therefore possible for both the defenders of philosophy as thehidden truth and its opponents who considered it a heresy to agree uponmeasures for restricting its teaching though from completely differentreasons. For the opponents, concealment was at least a way to marginal-ize its public force and to delay its exposure to the youth until an agewhen they would be more completely formed and thus protected from itspossible poisonous effects. For its supporters, it was the way of maintain-ing its priviledged position as the core truth of the tradition that only theinitiate are allowed to access.This ambiguity of the concealed between the repressed and the privi-leged had as well a very constructive role in what I called the coexistenceof secrecy in the medieval Jewish world. What was perceived by a certaingroup as a heretical doctrine was tolerated as long as it was shrouded in secrecy. In concealment, the impact of such doctrine was restricted,154•Chapter Seventeen"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"with the additional hope that with minimizing its exposure it would makeit difficult for this worldview to be sustained indefinitely, that having beenrepressed and marginalized, it will eventually disappear altogether. Forits supporters it was kept in its proper place—the hidden and most ex-alted. This form of coexistence is rather fragile as we saw, since the firststep in the direction of exposure forces other elites of secrecy to asserttheir position in the public sphere. The fragility of this paradoxical featureof the concealed manifested itself in the cultural war that erupted be-tween the esoteric elites in the thirteenth century, when the coexistence ofsecrecy fell apart.Our study of instrumental esotericismraised three paradoxical ten-sions in the medieval esoteric project—the unguarded nature of the mostguarded, the inability to properly calibrate the hint between revealingand concealing, and the ambiguity of the esoteric between the culturallyrepressed or the culturally privileged. These tensions that emerged fromthe inquiry into a particular historical moment are to my opinion struc-tural to the esoteric project. By structural I mean that the esoteric projectas such, even in completely different historical settings, is vulnerable tothese tensions. The tensions are structural since they arise from a deeperlevel than the merely accidental features of medieval Jewish history—they arise from the ontology of the secret.IIIOur ontology and epistemology is, so to speak, in a grip of the “depthmetaphor.” We distinguish between the apparent and the real, the internaland the merely external. Our epistemology is grounded in such a picture.We “discover” or “uncover” the “underlying” assumption, the depth ofthe matter and so on. Esotericism is a radical version of such a picture,and it privileges existentially and ontologically the secret and the hidden.8Heidegger’s conception of truth is an exemplary case of the centralityof disclosure and the privileged position of the hidden: “To say that anassertion ‘is true’ signifies that it uncovers the entity as it is in itself. Suchan assertion asserts, points out, ‘lets’ the entity ‘be seen’ (apophansis) in itsuncoveredness. The Being-true (truth) of the assertion must be under-stood as Being-uncovering.”9In his attempt to explicate the notion oftruth, Heidegger relies on his understanding of aletheia, the Greek wordfor unconcealment. The function of an assertion is not merely an attemptto represent things in their correctness, as the concept of truth was tradi-tionally understood in correspondence theories of truth. Assertions aimat lightening up a hidden aspect of reality: they uncover being, they makean aspect of it visible.Paradoxes of Esotericism•155"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"The equation of truth and uncovering in Heidegger’s thought assumestwo concepts of hiddenness.10The first hidden aspect to be systematicallyuncovered is reality in its everydayness that lies open before us, and yetwe avoid it because we dwell in it, as the fish is unaware of being in water.This notion of hiddenness has little to do with esotericism and conceal-ment in the way in which this work is interested. Uncovering here meansattentiveness, turning toward what is wide open or, to be more precise,too wide open to be noticed. Yet Heidegger points throughout his workto a second sense of concealment that privileges the realm which is struc-turally concealed. This second sense of concealment relates to the way inwhich humans conceal their own authentic being from themselves. Ourauthentic way of being in its unsettledness and void is covered by whatHeidegger calls the state of fallenness. The primordial concept of anxiety,guilt, and death has to be rescued from its disguised manifestation in thecondition in which we find ourselves. In one of the most striking formu-lations of this notion of concealment and uncovering, Heidegger puts thematter in the following way: “The entity which is in every case we our-selves are, is ontologically that which is farthest....The laying-bare ofDasein’s primordial Being must rather be wrestedfrom Dasein by follow-ing the opposite course from that taken by the falling ontico-ontologicaltendency of interpretation.” Following this formulation Heidegger claims:“Dasein’s kind of Beingthus demands that any ontological Interpretationwhich sets itself the goal of exhibiting the phenomena in their primodial-ity, should capture the Being of this entity, in spite of this entity’s owntendency to cover things up. Existential analysis, therefore, constantly hasthe character of doing violence, whether to the claims of everyday inter-pretation of its complacency and its traquillized obviousness” (359). Theproject of truth as uncovering, which privileges the concealed and hid-den, is in a constant struggle with the ongoing tendency to disguise andmask our genuine reality.Yet privileging the underlying and the hidden is complicated, especiallywhen the hidden is so deeply buried that it leaves feeble marks. What is not apparent is not real and thus it might literally disappear. In reject-ing the ontological privilege of the hidden, it is understood that to be isto be visible, to emerge. This sense of being is at the root of the anxietyof secrecy in which the holder of the secret loses his own sense of reality.It is for this reason that self-disclosure threatens spies, for example, whoseek to validate who they “really” are by leaving outward signs of theirconcealed identity. Or secret lovers will seek the space in which they can appear in public as lovers anonymously, just for the sake of attract-ing simple recognition, and validating the fact that their relationship isnot a mere dream. Gamblers, as we know from the technical term “tell,”are always at risk of disclosing through subtle body movements some 156•Chapter Seventeen"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"important information concerning their cards, as if their cards do notexist if they are not seen.The ambiguous ontological position of the concealed, between theprivileged and the vanishing, is magnified in another version of esoteri-cism. This magnified version of esotericism is neither internalnorinstru-mental, but can be named as essential esotericism. This form of esoteri-cism, which has a long history from medieval philosophy and mysticismto modern romanticism, claims that truth is ineffable. Transparency is es-sentially blocked; we can only intimate the truth by way of symbols andhints. Maimonides, for example, besides his political instrumental eso-tericism, argues that his text is abrupt, partial, and misleading becausethe subject matter essentially does not allow full exposure. Matters relat-ing to God are essentially concealed since using language to express suchknowledge is a violation of His unity and transcendence. Being impris-oned within the limited medium of language we can only gesture towardthe truth rather than fully expose it. The romantics made the distinctionbetween allegory and symbol. Allegory is a mode of representing some-thing that can be articulated in a straightforward, conceptual manner.The symbol is a representation of something which cannot be expresseddirectly, but only via the symbol. Allegory is the medium for instrumen-talesotericism; the symbol is the medium for essentialesotericism.Essen-tial esotericism, that elevates the concealed sphere to ineffability, is al-ways at risk of vanishing it. As a form of esoteric doctrine it puts intosharp focus the tension inherent in the concealed between privilege andmarginality. What cannot be spoken about cannot be thought about andhence might as well vanish altogether. It is no wonder that some scholarsinterpreted Maimonides’ negative theology, which denies the possibil-ity of linguistic articulations of faith, as skepticism about metaphysics altogether.The ambiguous place of the ineffable appears in Wittgenstein’s earlyphilosophy, one of the most complex and bold exercises in essential eso-tericism in its attempt at carving up the domain of what can be expressedin language and what is beyond such expression. Delimiting this domainis the main aim of the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, as declared in theintroduction: “Thus the aim of the book is to draw a limit to thought, orrather-not to thought, but to the expression of thought: for in order to beable to draw a limit to thought, we should have to find both sides of thelimit thinkable (i.e., we should have to be able to think what cannot bethought).” This philosophical work of setting the limit of linguistic ex-pression has to be done from the inside of language, pushing its envelopetill one meets the abyss of what cannot be spoken about: “It will there-fore only be in language that the limit can be drawn, and what lies on theother side of the limit will simply be nonsense.” The Tractatus’s mainParadoxes of Esotericism•157"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"dazzling and disturbing claim is the immense scope of the ineffable whichit carves out. It includes propositions not only concerning the transcen-dental God, as for example was claimed by Maimonidean negative theol-ogy, but sentences that seem to be saying something such as “there areobjects in the world” or “ murder is evil.” Even more so, the readers ofthe work have to struggle with the following problem: in the bold nar-rowing of what can be said, the claims of the Tractatusitself are desig-nated by Wittgenstein as nonsensical.And yet Wittgenstein’s interpreters are puzzled by the followingdilemma. Does the limit of expression designate as well the limit ofthought, and exhausts for us our experience of the horizon of being?What is beyond linguistic expression has been described as nonsense,though in another paragraph Wittgenstein defined such a realm as themystical: “There are, indeed, things that cannot be put into words. Theymake themselves manifest. They are what is mystical” (6.522). What isthe ontological status of the mystical? In the last sentence of the Tracta-tusWittgenstein proclaims the famous call for silence: “What we cannotspeak about we must pass over in silence.” Is there really something to besilent about; is that silence a pregnant silence? Is Wittgenstein’s work themost dramatic case of what we named essential esotericism, extendingthe ineffable to a far larger domain than in its previous formulations innegative theology? Or is the Tractatusactually the first grand formula-tion of logical positivism that empties the domain of the inexpressible altogether? One of the earlier readers of the Tractatus, Wittgenstein’sfriend Paul Engelmann, challenges the positivist reading:A whole generation of disciples was able to take Wittgenstein for apositivist because he had something of enormous importance in com-mon with the positivists: he draws the line between what we can speakabout and what we must be silent about just as they do. The differenceis only that they have nothing to be silent about. Positivism holds—andthis is its essence—that what we can speak about is all that really mat-ters in life. Whereas Wittgenstein passionately believes that all that re-ally matters in human life is precisely what, in his view, we must besilent about. When he nevertheless takes immense pain to delimit theunimportant, it is not the coastline of that island which is bent on sur-veying with such meticulous accuracy but the boundary of the ocean.11Regardless of such rejection of the logical positivist reading, amongerudite contemporary readers of the Tractatuswe find a persistent voicethat claims that there is nothing to be silent about, and indeed Wittgen-stein is not delimiting the boundary of the ocean but rather points towhere the void begins. The nonsense which is beyond language is likemere gibberish, plain nonsense.12Given the inherently ambiguous nature158•Chapter Seventeen"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"of the concealed, the debate as to whether there resides outside of lan-guage in the ineffable something meaningful or sheer emptiness is notsurprising. Wittgenstein left us with ambiguous formulations concerningthe question of whether he is the most exalted and daring essential eso-tericist, or the forerunner of logical positivism. The question of whetherthe ineffable is the most privileged or the empty is the sort of questionthat we cannot answer within a discourse of our language.The position of the concealed at the twilight point between the privi-leged and the marginal is part of its deep attraction and defeat. The hiddensphere allows a great degree of freedom, being unrestricted by constraintsand friction of the outside rigid world. Concealed from the gaze, control,and restraints of what is “out there,” the esoteric becomes the realm ofthe fantastic. It is no wonder that this realm operated as the breedingground for the most daring modes of thought that medieval Jews everproduced. Yet such space and freedom is purchased at the price of theethereal nature of the esoteric and its marginality. It is always under twokinds of pressure: either it evaporates, or if it becomes the focal point oflife and consciousness it moves the subject toward estrangement andalienation. When these speculations, fantasies, or actions become increas-ingly anchored in the visible and the real, they meet the harsh constraintsof communal and personal life.This complex dynamic is present not only in the cultural and personalfunction of the concealed; it operates in the political sphere as well. Withall its efforts of propaganda, oppression cannot fully invade the realm ofinteriority; the slave is always free to have inner contempt for his master.The oppressed can whisper to himself his loathing of his oppressor. Thesafety and seclusion of the interior is the root of the Stoic conception ofinner freedom. Since such freedom is enclosed within the inner realm ofthe imagination, it seeks to have some visible resonance through a codedcommon language developed among the oppressed.13Yet such freedom,even if it is shared unseen by the oppressed, is still locked in the realm ofthe imagined and the esoteric, and it serves as a poor comfort to thosewho are bonded and humiliated. When the concealed contempt and re-sistance moves to anchor the inner in the real, it might meet the harshnessof conflict and brutality. At its best, the esoteric realm is supposed to actas a point of mediation between the mere empty fantasy and the nar-rowly constrained realm of the tangible and visible, and because of this itis always under the threat of slipping into either of these zones.The greatest of all modern esoteric projects, psychoanalysis—which as-sumes a hidden, censored layer in the self and explains symptoms, dreams,and everyday failures as coded, displaced transformations of unconsciousmental activity—rests upon such ambiguity of the concealed. The de-structive effectiveness of a symptom is predicated on the fact that itsParadoxes of Esotericism•159"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"meaning is concealed from the patient. When the symbolic meaning of asymptom is uncovered by the therapist and internalized by the patient,the spell of the symptom evaporates. This therapeutic technique is basedupon a firm belief in the redeeming nature of self-transparency. The ex-posure of the event which is repeated in a camouflaged fashion in com-pulsive behavior is the key for undermining its grip and power. By break-ing the resistance of censorship and shedding light on the unconscioushidden root of the symptom, its power over the patient weakens and dis-appears. In condition of full repression and concealment, in which uncon-scious activity would not leave a trace, such exposure would never happenbut it is as well unnecessary. Unconscious mental activity in such a case iscompletely marginalized. Its feeble appearance in the fantasy life of a per-son such as in dreams is not harmful and even welcome, since it is a wayof letting out steam and achieving satisfaction without impacting the realwaking life of the patient. In order to achieve efficacy, the mental uncon-scious material has to leave marks and traces in guiding action and be-havior. Yet at that very moment it opens the door to its exposure and an-nihilation. The possible success of the therapist in his battle with the innercensor is based on the ambiguous ontology of the concealed. When un-conscious activity is fully concealed, it is marginalized and therefore hasshadowy reality altogether. Its emergence and reality in the life of the pa-tient entails the beginning of disclosure, because what leaves no markmight as well be completely disregarded.The prevalence of secrecy as a basic mode of operation in totalitarianregimes serves as a fascinating example of the uses of concealment and se-crecy in order to diminish the very sense of reality. In her insightful analy-sis of totalitarianism, Hannah Arendt defines its ultimate goal as obliter-ating the distinction between truth and falsity altogether, creating at theend a completely fictitious world enclosed within itself.14The concept oftruth in its direct and raw meaning posits the claim that there is a realityout there, independent of our will. This independent realm threatens theaspiration of complete control. The very idea of reality limits the will,and in some cases it sets a possible independent standard that severs toassess and falsify the regime itself. In order to abolish what seems to bethe ultimate obstacle, the totalitarian regime aims at erasing the very dis-tinction between falsity and truth. Such an attempt might be directed atthe party’s own ideological convictions that are supposedly the objectivemoral and political basis of its policy, and yet this ideology is a target for obliteration since it might serve as an outside anchor of critique and assessment of the regime itself. Hence the thorough suspicion of suchregimes toward the true believers of its own doctrines. The totalitarianproject does not stop at propagating a lie; it aims at undermining the verydistinction between falsity and truth. Concealment is one among other160•Chapter Seventeen"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"devices for such a project, and examining its role can teach us a great dealabout the connection between isolation and concealment.In the totalitarian regime there is an inverse relationship between pub-licity, visibility, and power; the more visible a branch of government, theless powerful it is. Such a mechanism creates an ongoing dependency onthe will of the leader, with no capacity to predict it or to ascribe to thatwill some stable meaning. Yet it aims at something deeper. Our sense ofreality depends to a large degree on our capacity to share points of view,to form communal and public experiences and understandings. In a con-dition of mistrust and suspicion, where everybody is potentially spyingon everybody, such public discourse is undermined. The capacity of peo-ple to form a shared assessment and understanding of political matters isweakened when they live amidst a power structure that intentionally pro-duces duplications, in which whenever power finds a stable center it is re-placed by another inner circle. In a regime that controls public evidenceand its manifestations, the private certainty of reality is thoroughly dam-aged. An innocent prisoner might make the true claim that his past his-tory took a certain course, but if the regime controls and manipulates allthe past traces by fabricating and changing documents, by terrorizingwitnesses and family members, the innocent prisoner might lose his senseof reality altogether. Such an individual is transposed to a world beyondtruth and falseness; he inhabits the realm of madness.That the possibility of an outward, independent perspective which af-firms inner conviction is undermined is rather devastating; only uniqueindividuals can hold on to their version and sustain sanity in such condi-tions of isolation. Systematic concealment isolates the subject and erodeshis sense of reality as well. This is true not only in regard to the personwhose information is concealed; it applies as well to the one who is con-cealing. The concealing party that isolates itself more and more by narrow-ing the cycle of secrecy causes the shrinking of the horizons of the sharedoutward world that are constitutive to a sense of reality. The utter condi-tion of isolation in secrecy is the point in which the privileged position ofthe concealed might turn into a vehicle that undermines the very sense oftruth that its privilege rests upon.The ontological ambiguity of the concealed and the hidden betweenprivilege and marginality is at the core of the inherent tensions we uncov-ered in the esoteric project. The first tension discussed above revealedthat what is most guarded is the most open ended. This paradoxical fea-ture that dominates the history of esotericism is related to the lack of anyreality constraints on what is not apparent; since the secret does not ap-pear, there is no way to define it; hence what was supposed to be the mostguarded and individuating of all aspects becomes the most open endedand disruptive. The second tension that emerged is the instability of theParadoxes of Esotericism•161"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"main medium of esoteric interaction and hermeneutics—the coded hint.The inability to properly calibrate the hint is the reason why esotericismbreaks open or banishes. The hidden layer is either too transparent or toodeeply buried; it is an immense challenge to achieve the proper balancebetween depth and oblivion. The fine unstable ontological status of theconcealed between what is real and what disappears is at the root as wellof the precarious position of the esoteric between privilege and marginal-ity. The esoteric project is inherently paradoxical and its structural ten-sions are related to the complex ontological status of the concealed.15IVThe inherent contradictions in the esoteric project reveal a far more com-plex picture of this phenomenon, both historically and conceptually, thanwhat Leo Strauss had in mind when he initiated the study of esotericism.Strauss, who discovered the prevalence of esotericism, began to use it asan interpretative key for understanding the great philosophical texts ofthe past. Yet for Strauss, the study of esotericism did not limit itself to thepurpose of presenting a better understanding of past philosophical texts;esotericism for him was a normatively recommended position. The ni-hilistic and brutal politics of modernity was, according to Strauss, an out-come of the way in which philosophy lost its esoteric constraints andopenly advocated atheism and relativistic views challenging the nature of truth as such, and undermining public morality. Philosophy, whichconcerns itself with the love of truth, should have been an undergroundoccupation since society cannot survive under complete conditions oftransparency. Any political life needs necessary beliefs or noble myths.Pointing to the tensions and self-defeating potential of the esotericism asa whole does not disqualify the project altogether. In order to achieve afull account of the problem there is a need to address the political agendaof esotericism in a more direct fashion.Liberal democrats tend to two opposing directions in their attitude to-ward concealment. They aim at protecting concealment in matters relat-ing to the private realm, and they attempt to maximize transparency inrelations to the public and political realm. Both tendencies are based onthe same impulse of enhancing freedom and autonomy. The protection ofthe private realm from nonconsensual exposure rests upon the recognitionof the privilege and autonomy that individuals have in defining degrees ofself-revelation and intimacy. This policy has to be defended indepen-dently of instrumental arguments. Sects or other tight groups, who exertsocial pressure for mutual confession before the community, seem to liber-als as intrusive and domineering. Transparency in such occasions works162•Chapter Seventeen"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"usually to the benefit of the powerful, establishing dependencies and ex-ploiting weaknesses that are based upon information that was innocentlyrevealed. From the liberal perspective, political and social intrusion intothe private realm damages our vital concern for individuation and auton-omy. On the other hand, the demand for transparency in the politicalsphere, which rejects the medieval and Straussian picture of the necessaryrole of myth in politics, is as well an attempt to protect freedom and self-government. Without proper information we are deprived of the capacityto make serious choices, and the manipulation of public opinion throughsecrecy diminishes our autonomy and self-respect, especially when it ispracticed in a paternalistic mode. Public deliberation is perverted in con-ditions of concealment, and accountability is abolished by secrecy. Trans-parency is therefore as central to liberal democratic values as equality,freedom, or representation.The Enlightenment’s quest for transparency is based, among otherthings, upon rejecting the medieval idea of the masses or the multitudes.Truth is accessible in clear and distinct fashion to every thinking humanbeing. Its basic foundation according to the empiricist is in raw sensedata, or according to the Cartesians in mental states of self-consciousnessthat are immediately present to those who are willing to enter the philo-sophical journey. Political authority ought to be grounded by rationalself-interest, manifested in the imagined social contract in which rationalhuman beings move from the state of nature to the political order as a result of a well-calculated reasoned agreement. The capacity to pursuemoral obligation is not dependent upon the fear of future punishment inthe afterlife, but in internalizing the intrinsic wrong or merit of normsand actions.It may very well be that Enlightenment and liberal theory is rather naïvein abolishing the political category of the masses. Yet the Straussians areas naïve in believing that genuine elites can be trusted. Trusting the exis-tence of a selected group of wise men who are devoted to the collectivegood, and who are freed from ambition and self-interest because of theirpursuit of truth, is as crude as the belief in a society where masses disap-pear and deliberation and reason control human’s political choices. Therejection of the Platonic noble myth is based upon the suspicion towardthe category of the elite rather than the belief in the rationality of societyas a whole. The demand of transparency opposes the Platonic faith in theredemptive power of philosophy. Humans, even those who devote them-selves to the pursuit of truth, are always embedded within the boundariesof the human condition. The judgment of the most lofty and noble of hu-mans is vulnerable to their quest of power, to their fantasy of glory, totheir deepest fears, to their personal hatreds, and to the obstructionsstemming from their idiosyncratic love relationships. Over time the elitesParadoxes of Esotericism•163"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"themselves will believe the noble myth that they spread for the purpose ofsocial stability and political order. Kant expressed this point in his de-fense of the Enlightenment: “It is very harmful to propagate prejudices,because they finally avenge themselves on the very people who first en-couraged them.”16The permanency of the assumed constrains of human-ity is not dependent upon accepting Nietzsche’s reductive interpretationof the quest for truth as a manifestation of the will to power. It is enoughto view the Platonic claim that the only worthy ruler is the philosopher asa testimony to the vulnerability of the philosopher to the quest for power.Transparency is therefore the only device to avoid false paternalism. Notbecause none of us adult humans is a child, but because none of us humanscan locate himself in the position of the ultimate parent.Yet, unlike other democratic values, transparency is not shared or inter-nalized by the political elite. Politicians in western democracies do notwant to challenge systematically individual rights or freedoms, nor dothey aspire to change the electoral system of representation. We can evendare say that most of them actually believe in these values. But manypoliticians do not believe in transparency, since they ordinarily came topower by ongoing manipulation of public opinion. Even more so, mostof them exploit the very means that democracies have to guarantee trans-parency in order to manipulate and conceal. I am referring to the media,election campaigns, debates, and so on, all of them orchestrated by pub-lic relations advisors who make a living out of manipulating public opin-ion. Successful ongoing manipulation of public opinion through the verymeans of transparency is the reason for the common contempt thatpoliticians have for their constituencies. (Such contempt is naturally hid-den.) The best of them develop self-contempt as well. The struggle fortransparency is thus an uphill battle, with no real support from the rulers.It is the most Sisyphean of democratic tasks.Unlike equality, freedom, or representation, the achievement of trans-parency is entangled in another particular difficulty. It is clear that a de-gree of legitimate concealment is necessary to maintain the state and itsdemocratic institutions. Military secrets, techniques for fighting crime,intelligence gathering, and even diplomatic negotiations that will fallapart if they become exposed—all these domains have to stay shroudedin secrecy in order to allow the functioning of ordinary transparency inthe other institutions of the state. Our transparent open conversationrests upon a rather extensive dark and hidden domain that insures itsflourishing. Democratic theorists insist that there should be at least a sec-ond order transparency considering concealment.17Secrecy ought to begranted to certain domains only in the context of open deliberation andthrough the democratic process. Yet even with this second order mecha-nism, the very existence of a legitimate covert realm creates an ongoing164•Chapter Seventeen"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"problem to democratic regimes. This most guarded realm becomes themost unguarded and subversive domain, because it is so guarded. Free ofthe control of public opinion and the political process, the agencies of se-crecy gain immense freedom not allowed to any other institution. Thetemptation to lead a political double life is immense, relegating to theseunaccountable domains the dirty work that the public does not want toknow about.There is another important reason for this Sisyphean condition. If wefulfill or approximate the virtues of equality and freedom in our politicallife, we will know the degree to which we achieved them; it can be mea-sured. We will never know whether we achieved transparency; this is con-ceptually true. Transparency itself is never transparent. (This intolerablecondition is a reason for some psychotic breakdowns.) The proposition“All your secrets are known to me” is an oxymoron. This irresolvabledifficulty in transparency is manifested when government officials arguein court against a demand of disclosure in the name of protection of se-crecy for the sake of national security. When such an argument is raised,the court itself is prevented from viewing the material in order to rendera decision of whether there is a genuine problem of national security in-volved in disclosure. The best the court can do is to infer from circumstan-tial evidence whether to force disclosure or to protect secrecy. If the courtviews the material itself, it is no longer a secret, given the fact that thejudges are not part of the agency initiated into secrecy. (Presumably thereis a way out of the problem by allowing the court itself to view the mate-rial, assuming that the judges themselves are restricted by a commitmentto secrecy. Even that solution is vulnerable; after all, serious evidenceought to be disclosed to cross-examination by the defender’s lawyers. Thecycle of secrecy might be enlarged to include the lawyer as well; in thatcase he will become mistrusted by his client who cannot view the infor-mation himself.)We can put the matter in the following abstract way. How can the se-cret life of the state be controlled? If it is controlled by the public, it is nolonger a secret, and if it is controlled by another agent who himself isunder constraints of secrecy, he is then part of the cycle of secrecy itself.The problem lies in the difficult task of finding the proper calibration of the inside and outside. It is not an easy task to properly design an in-stitutional arrangement of a body or an individual who is both inside thesecret domain to have access to the concealed, and is also outside that do-main to be trusted by the public as a genuine independent voice. If wecome back to psychoanalysis and its political analogy, we are faced withthe puzzle that Sartre raised concerning the censor. The censor presum-ably is an all-knowing element in the economy of psyche. He is bothaware of the unconscious material and aware of the conscious potentialParadoxes of Esotericism•165"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"pain that will be caused if such material eventually emerges into the conscious life of the psyche. As an institution located at the threshold be-tween the conscious and the unconscious, screening what is allowed outand under what proper degree of disclosure, the censor has the privilegedposition of being omniscience. If this is not the case it would not be ableto properly function. But where does the censor belong, inside or outside?And who hides the censor from consciousness? As Sartre was concernedin his argument against the Freudian picture of the psyche, we are in dan-ger of entering into an infinite regression of concealment and censors,where there is a need to censor the censor.It is important to note that an open-eye recognition, and even anxietyconcerning the difficult task of transparency due to the nontransparentnature of transparency, is by no means a collapse into the paranoid con-spiratorial worldview. For this shift, from a healthy suspicion of the con-cealed to the conspiratorial mindset, to occur, other crucial componentshave to be added. The main one is the search for a kind of providentialorder that is a constitutive feature of conspiracy theories, in which its be-lievers do not accept the possibility of chance and mere failure. They tendto interpret discrete accidental features as a result of an intentional secrethand. Ordinary failures in planning and execution become signs of mali-cious intentional plots of the enemy within.This religious-like quest for order is coupled with a kind of dualisticManichean division of good and evil in which paranoia and megalomaniawork in close proximity.18The propagator of the claim of the conspirato-rial plot endows a certain group—the conspirators—with omnipotent ca-pacities, while placing his own group as the ultimate target that at theend will heroically overcome by disclosing the conspiracy. Groups likeJews or Freemasons were traditionally accused of conspiracies, since theyto a certain degree were insular from the rest of society, and yet they werepresent in it, in a peculiar simultaneous mix of insiders and outsiders.Their dual loyalty to the state and to their own group, a group that usuallycrosses boarders and is thus universal in scope, makes them the ultimateenemy from within. The presumed disparity between their actual successand status, and their lack of a real power base as foreigners, is filled byprojecting onto the Jews a diabolical plot that transcends the recognizedand visible seats of power.Besides these added elements that make the conspiratorial mind, con-spiracy theories do not aim at the achievements of transparency; they ordi-narilyseek to undermine its value and institutions altogether. The preva-lence of such modes of thinking (and acting) in both the radical left andright is very revealing. Both camps share a revolutionary ethos claimingthat the present state of affairs in its totality is evil and wrong, and it canbe cured by a radical political action. Postulating an intentional hidden166•Chapter Seventeen"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"enemy as responsible for the present calamity becomes necessary for theradical groups who do not accept the inherent limitations and the com-promises of actual political life. The illusion of a grand, intentionallyplanned solution held by radical political groups is thus dependent onconstructing the mirror image for the radical action—the diabolicalenemy that has to be countered and uprooted. There is yet a more impor-tant component of the denial of transparency by conspiratorial modes ofthinking. The radical left and right claim that the ordinary democraticmeans of political deliberation, which they resent, are mere façades of hid-den powers who dominate the situation. If so, these groups opt out of theregular deliberative political process, acting as if on a deeper level inorder to solve once and for all what they consider the underlying hiddenroot of the problem. Through propagating a conspiracy theory, they avoidthe give and take of the transparent political process and so underminethe institutions of transparency altogether. The conspiratorial mind setmust be distinguished from the search for transparency, which is con-cerned with the Sisyphean qualities of such noble goals.Yet the obstruction to transparency lies in a deeper aspect of modernpolitics than the general conceptual problem of the nontransparency oftransparency. It is rooted in the complex duality of the function and pur-pose of the modern centralized state. In its first function the state is ded-icated to preserve and ensure the rights of individuals, a function thatserves as its main source of legitimation. Individuals, in this picture of thestate, are willing to grant the state the right to judge, punish, and even taxin exchange for the security, stability, justice, and freedom that the stateensures. In its second function, the state became a meaning-endowingbody, which shapes and structures an all-encompassing identity of its cit-izens. It achieves this purpose through its public rituals and symbols, butmainly with the aid of a powerful educational system that ensures loyaltyand identification to the nation or the state. As a meaning-endowing proj-ect its ultimate claim and sovereignty is manifested in the right to con-script. By sending its citizens to war, the state expects self-sacrifice, thusendowing meaning to their deaths.War as a matter between states shatters the rationality, presumed in thesocial contract, of moving from the natural state to the political state. Thesovereign that was supposed to protect individuals one from the otherbrought them to a far more problematic position. In the political statethere are sovereign, organized bodies that are propagating violence onetoward the other without renouncing their right to violence to one sharedglobal sovereign. This sort of violence is far more lethal than the one thatHobbes described in the natural pre-political state. In this political statethe means of violence that are recruited through the immense joint effortsof organized states have a far greater destructive power. The shift fromParadoxes of Esotericism•167"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"the natural to the political state is practically a movement toward agraver and riskier situation, in which the competition between states de-vours the citizens that they were supposed to protect.In its attempt to close the gap between its function as the protector ofindividual rights and its function as the hungriest and most demandingaltar of human sacrifice ever created by humans, the state always needsto access myth-making. It appeals to the founding sacrificial act thatbinds the group together rather than to the social contract that endowedit with legitimacy. It burdens its youth with a heavy sense of betrayal ofthis primary sacrifice if they do not march forward, and with a greatpromise of eternal memory if they do. Very few soldiers would show upto the front if the decision-making process that might lead to their deathshad been fully transparent to them. There are exceptions to this, but onlyexceptions. Could a political body survive under complete transparency?It depends upon the sort of role and function it ascribes to itself. As apseudo-religious, meaning-endowing project, it will necessarily have amyth. But given the fact that such a function coexists with the social con-tract function of the state, with its clear demand and assumption of trans-parency, we might find ourselves in worse conditions than our medievalancestors. Our myth might be that we do not have a myth.168•Chapter Seventeen"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"NotesIntroduction1. “Because of his sins, man is unable to know what is the image of what isabove; for were it not so, the keys would have been given unto him, and he wouldknow how heaven and earth were created” (Avot deRabbi Natan, Version A,chap. 39; Shechter edition, p. 116).2.

The first to remark and comment extensively on the phenomenon of eso-tericism from a social point of view was Georg Simmel. On this, see The So-ciology of Georg Simmel, ed. and trans. K. H. Wolff (New York: Free Press, 1964). For further development of Simmel’s ideas, see B.

The Paradox of Esotericism: “And Not on the Chariot Alone”1. See Mishna Megilla 4:10.2. The Talmud defines “the work of creation” as the passages of the creationnarrative in the book of Genesis. On the various disputes over which passages are defined as ma’asei breishit(the work of creation), see B. Lifshitz, “Expound-ing the Work of Creation,” Jerusalem Studies in Jewish Thought, 3, 4 (1984):513–524 (Hebrew).3. The examples provided by the Talmud for exposition of matters of incest,which was permitted by Rabbi Ishmael, are entirely conventional. See TalmudYerushalmi, Hagiga 2:1 (77a).4. In addition to the passages dealing with the chariot and creation, which maynot be expounded publicly, there is a tradition that views the Song of Songs as an esoteric text, which may not be expounded in public. See Scholem, JewishGnosticism, pp. 38–42, and the comments of Saul Lieberman, “The Tractate of the Song of Songs,” Appendix D (Hebrew), in Scholem, Jewish Gnosticism,pp. 118–126.5.

In the Kaufmann and Parma manuscripts, the text reads hakham v’hevin mida’ato—a sage who understood of his own knowledge. The title mevinrefersto a quality of the learner, whereas the expression hevinrefers to an event. If theMishna provides instructions for the learner rather than the teacher, the questionarises: how does the learner know if he understood on his own if this is a precondi-tionfor allowing him to learn? This implies that the knowledge of esotericism beginswith the violation of a restriction. The learner knows if he is worthy of learningesoteric teachings only if he attempted to expound them and succeeded; yet theunderstanding itself is a precondition for being worthy of access to the esotericteaching. This is what the Sefer Habahirmeans in saying: “Things one cannot discernunless one stumbles over them.” For a discussion of this theme, see below, chap. 12.9.

This reading is supported by other sources hinted at in the passage in SeferYetzira. Liebes, Elisha’s Sin, discusses them at length. See for example Avot Derabbi Natan: “ ‘And acquire for yourself a friend.’ How? This teaches us that a man should acquire for himself a friend and eat with him, drink with him, readwith him, study with him, sleep with him, and reveal to him all his secrets, the secrets of the Torah and the secrets of sexual behavior” (Avot Derabbi Natan,Version A, Shechter edition, p. 36).Chapter2. The Hidden and the Sublime: Vision and Restriction in the Bible and Talmudic Literature1. See Lieberman in Tosefta Ki-feshuta, pp. 1292–1295, on the exchange between Rabbi Yehoshua and Ben Zoma. Apparently, this was the BabylonianTalmud’s understanding of the concept katzatz ban’ti’ot(cut down the sprouts).2. See also Babylonian Talmud Megilla 24b, on the internal image created bythe blind man: “There it all depends on the discernment of the heart, and the expounder, by concentrating his mind can know.”3.

For a more extensive discussion of the role of vision in earlyand medieval mysticism, see E. Wolfson, Through a Speculum That Shines(Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1997).4. It is possible that Rabbi Akiba did not peek, since with respect to him alone,we do not find the word hetzitz(peeked), but only ’alah(arose); consequently, he “left in peace.” So explains Rashi on Hagiga 16a, mai darash. See also E. E.Urbach, “The Tradition on the Secret Teaching in the Tannaitic Period,” Studiesin the Kabbalah and the History of Religions Presented to Gershom Scholem(Jerusalem: Magnes Press, 1968), p. 13 (Hebrew); Liebes, Elisha’s Sin, p. 90.5. On the nature of the passage as a parable see Liebes, Elisha’s Sin, pp. 6–9.6. The Babylonian Talmud intensifies the focus on vision in its commentary onthe mishnaic saying, “ ‘Whoever is inconsiderate of the honor of his Creator, it isfitting that he had never come into the world’: What is this? R. Abba says, this isone who looks at a rainbow” (Hagiga 16a). Further on in the text, vision of therainbow is equated with looking at the Shekhina, based on the verse (Ezekiel 1:28)“as the appearance of the rainbow in the clouds on a rainy day, so is the appear-ance of the image of the glory of God” (Hagiga 16a). See also the variant readingon the ascent of Rabbi Akiba: “Rabbi Akiba went up unhurt and went down un-hurt; and of him Scripture says: ‘Draw me, we will run after thee.’ And RabbiAkiba too, the ministering angels sought to thrust away; but the Holy One,blessed be He, said to them: Let this elder be, for he is worthy to avail himself(l’hishtamesh) of my glory.” Rabbi Hananel cites the text version as “he is wor-thy to look upon (l’histakel) my glory” (Hagiga 15b). On this variant reading, seebelow, chap. 4.7. JT Hagiga 2:1, 77c.8. The greater importance assigned to the act of exposure, rather than the fearof error, is also manifest in the text of the Jerusalem Talmud. Rabbi Yehuda benNotes to Chapter 2•171"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"Pazi held that it was permissible to expound the creation narrative in public, andheld a long cosmogenic discourse, which began with the sentence: “In the begin-ning the world was all waters in water.” To this exposition, Rabbi Eliezer saidunto him, “Your master did not interpret this passage. You ought to compare itto a king who built a palace in a place of sewer pipes, dunghills, and garbage.Whoever comes and says, this palace is in a place of sewer pipes, dunghills andgarbage, does he not discredit it? So whoever says, in the beginning the worldconsisted of waters in water, he too discredits it” (JT Hagiga 2:1, 77c). The world,like the king’s palace, is built upon dunghills and garbage, but such things maynot be expounded in public.Chapter3. The Ethics of Gazing: The Attitude of Early JewishMysticism Toward Seeing the Chariot1. The Gnostic context has been explored by Gershom Scholem in JewishGnosticism, Merkabah Mysticism and Talmudic Tradition(New York: JewishTheological Seminary, 1965), pp. 1–8, 65–74.2. Scholem, Jewish Gnosticism,. and, subsequently, and in much greater detail,I. Grunewald, Apocalyptic and Merkabah Mysticism(Leiden-Köln: P. Lang,1980), claimed that there is a strong link between the esoteric tradition in the Talmud and Hekhalot literature. An opposite view was advanced by Urbach,“Tradition on the Secret Teaching.” This view was expanded in D. Halperin, TheMerkabah in Rabbinic Literature (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1980).3. On the difference between these two realms of activity, see I. Grunewald,“ ‘Knowledge and Vision,’ ” Israel Oriental Studies3 (1973): 63–107.4. For a summary and clarification of the various positions on this issue, see P. Schäfer, The Hidden and Manifest God: Some Major Themes in Early JewishMysticism, trans. A. Pomerance (Albany: State University of New York Press,1992), pp. 150–157. On the relation between these aspects in the Shi’ur Komahliterature, see the comprehensive article of A. Farber-Ginat, “Reflections on theBookShi’ur Komah,”Masu’ot: Studies in Kabbalistic Literature and in JewishThought in Memory of Prof. Efraim Gottlieb, ed. M. Oron and A. Goldreich(Jerusalem: Mossad Bialik, 1984), pp. 361–394 (Hebrew).5. For a broad analysis of the desire for vision and the internal structure of ex-perience linked to vision, see H. Pedaya, “Seeing, Falling, Song and Longing—Seeing God and the Spiritual Element in Early Jewish Mysticism,” Asufot9(1995): 237–277 (Hebrew).6. A common motive is the veil of fire stretching in front of the throne of Glory,whose blinding radiance makes even a quick glance impossible: “And if this didnot suffice, a pattern of a shining cloak shrouds Him like a radiant light whichhas no equal among all the luminary bodies in the heights of the aravot, such thateven the creatures of the Merkabaand the cherubim of the gevuraand the ofanimof the Shekhinacannot look upon the splendor of the Glory, because of the lightthat surrounds Him” (Ma’ase Merkaba, in Batei Midrashot, ed. Wertheimer, vol. 1 [Jerusalem: Mossad Harav Kook, 5712/1952], chap. 3, pp. 56–57). Also:“And if this did not suffice, He enveloped himself as in a pattern of a lamp of 172•Notes to Chapter 3"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"intensely shining splendor, a majesty that has no likeness among all the luminousbodies of aravot, so that even the holy creatures of the Merkabaand the cheru-bim of the gevuraand the ofanimof the Shekhinacannot look at the splendor ofthe glory, for it envelops Him. And the splendor of his throne surrounds a visionof brightness around the throne. Thus the Holy One, blessed be He, envelopedHimself in cloud and fog as it is written: ‘for he founded the darkness of conceal-ment around his tent,’ so that the ministering angels would not nourish them-selves from the splendor of the Shekhinaand the splendor of His throne and thesplendor of His glory and the splendor of His kingship” (I. D. Eisenstein, OtzarHamidrashim[New York: Eisenstein Press, 5675/1915], 1: 108).7.Midrash Mishlei, ed. M. Buber (Vilna, 1893).8. On the various traditions in the literature of the Sages on the angels’ strug-gle with God, against the transmission of secrets to men, see A. Marmorstein,“The Arguments of the Angels with the Creator,” Melila3–4 (1950): 93–102(Hebrew); J. P. Schultz, “Angelic Opposition to the Ascension of Moses and theRevelation of the Law,” Jewish Quarterly Review61 (1970–71): 283–307; P. Schäfer, Rivalität zwischen Engel und Menschen(Berlin and New York: deGruyter, 1975). We might mention that in the literature of the Sages, the angelsnot only block access to contact with God and understanding of His secrets, butalso leak His secrets. Bureaucracy, as we know, not only conceals but also leaksinformation. The midrash seeks to interpret the words of the angels to Lot, “forwe shall destroy this place,” as an instance of information leakage: “ ‘For we shalldestroy,’ Rabbi Levi in the name of Rabbi Nahman said, ‘because the ministeringangels revealed God’s mystery, they were ousted from their offices for one hundredthirty-eight years’ ” (Genesis Rabbah, pp. 524–525).9.

See also in Sefer HaKomah: “Rabbi Ishma’el said: ‘When I said this thingbefore Rabbi Akiba, he said to me: “Anyone who knows this dimension of hisCreator and this praise of the Holy One, blessed be He, is guaranteed (a portion)in this world and in the World to Come. He will live long in this world, and livelong and well in the World to Come, he will enjoy the good things of this worldand the good things of the World to Come.’”...Rabbi Ishma’el said: ‘I and RabbiAkiba are guarantors for this matter, that in this world one will enjoy a good lifeand in the next world a good name; as long as he repeats this Mishna each andevery day’ ” (M.

Concealment and Power: Magic and Esotericism in the Hekhalot Literature1. See also Avoda Zara 18a.2.

Halperin, The Faces of the Chariot(Tübingen: Coronet Books, 1988), p. 385. Moshe Idel does not believe that unschooled circles could create such so-phisticated texts. In his opinion, the Hekhalot literature arose among a groupthat he calls a “secondary elite,” which did not belong to the primary elite of theSages. See M. Idel, “Judaism, Jewish Mysticism and Magic,” Bulletin of theWorld Association of Jewish Studies36 (1996): 39–40 (Hebrew). See also M.

This passage is an extract from the Sefer Hahokhmaof Rabbi Eleazar ofWorms. See Y.

On the perception of crisis as justification for the disclosure of secrets in theconsciousness of Maimonides, see below, chap. 8.8. This idea appears in talmudic literature. See E. E. Urbach, E. E. Urbach,Haza”l, (Jerusalem: Magnes Press, 1969), pp. 276–277 (Hebrew). We might notethat the calculation of the end time is in itself restricted knowledge. See Tanhuma,Deuteronomy 4; Ketubot 111a; Genesis Rabbah 96. The revelation of the end timemay destabilize the social structure. If the end time is too far off, its disclosuremay lead to despair, whereas if it is too close it may lead to social ferment or—ifit is in error—to crisis. In medieval Jewish literature, this esoteric realm was oftenviolated by calculators of end times who came from the very heart of the halakhicestablishment. In his revelation of the end times in his book Emunot Vede’ot(Article 8, 3.4), Rabbi Sa’adia Gaon completely avoids mentioning this limita-tion; Avraham bar Hiyya, in his book Megillat Ham’galeh(ed. Poznansky [Berlin,1923], pp. 2, 12), denies it outright. For an attack on revealers of end times pre-ceding this composition, see Rabbi Abraham Ibn Ezra’s commentary on Daniel11:30.

See also his commentary on Genesis 3:24. For Ibn Ezra, the immortality ofthe soul depends on the idea of d’vekut(cleaving to God), as described in IbnEzra’s commentary with reference to esoteric knowledge: “If the soul becomewise, it will enter into the secrets of the angels and receive great power from aheavenly power that it may receive through the light of the angels. Then, it willNotes to Chapter 5•175"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"cleave to the glorious Name” (Weiser 2:34). See also Ibn Ezra’s commentary onEnoch (Genesis 5:24; Weiser 1:34, nn. 9, 10). For a similar description of the stateofd’vekut, see Weiser 2:342.6. Weiser’s edition presents an alternative reading: “Those who add ‘to illumi-nate their eyes,’ perhaps the reason is that they know it and do not wish to revealthe secret to their disciples” (Weiser 2:217). The version I cite has been extremelywell verified by Shlomo Sela, Astrology and Biblical Interpratation (Ramat Gan:Bar Ilan University Press, 1993), pp. 54–62 (Hebrew).7. On the secret of intercalation, see JT Rosh Hashana 2:5 (58b); Rosh Hashana20b; Ketubot 112a. In Pirkei deRabbi Eliezer, the issue of the secret of intercala-tion is developed and presented as a continuous tradition that began with God’sintercalation of the years. He then transmitted this information to Adam, and itwas transmitted continuously down to the High Court sages, who deal with in-tercalation of the year. See Pirkei deRabbi Eliezer, chap. 8.

See also Sela,Astrology and Biblical Interpretation, p. 367.4. The identification of the term kol(here translated as “the all”) in the thoughtof Ibn Ezra is a matter of dispute among his exegetes. Elliot Wolfson identifies thekolwith the first hypostasis of God, which is also identified as the Creator of theworld. See E. Wolfson, “God the Demiurge and the Intellect: On the Usage of the Word Kolin Abraham Ibn Ezra,” Revue des etudes juives 149 (1990): 77–111.Hayim Kreisel opposes this view and identifies the word kolwith the deity. See H. Kreisel, “On the Term Kolin Abraham Ibn Ezra: A Reappraisal,” Revue desetudes juives153 (1994): 29–66.5. See Ibn Ezra’s comments on Balaam: “For there is no power in creation thatcan change the deeds of the Creator or His decree. And the secret is that the partcannot change the part; only the decree of the all (hakol) can change the decreeof the part. But I may not reveal this secret, for it is very profound” (Numbers22:28; Weiser 3:181). On the talismanic context of the miracle, see the short com-mentary to Exodus 3:13: “For the triangle has the power to receive and does not176•Notes to Chapter 6"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"need two. Thus, Moses could demonstrate signs and wonders the like of whichhad never been created in all the earth, through the power of the Name. For thepower of the Name shows signs and creates in the bodies in accordance with thereceiver. And he who knows this secret knows the prophecies of ‘and He ap-peared unto him,’ and ‘A man struggled,’ as well as the wonder of the burningbush” (Weiser 2:246).6. Dov Schwartz clearly demonstrated how Ibn Ezra maintains that idolatry isbased on the foundations of the attraction of forces by means of statues. On this,see Schwartz, Astrology and Magic, pp. 68–72; also see 31–39, on idolatry andthe attraction of forces, and on the astral foundations in the conception of ritualin Rabbi Yehuda Halevi’s work.Chapter7. Double Language and the Divided Public in Guide of the Perplexed1. The idea of the divided public and the layered text first appeared in the period between Ibn Ezra and Maimonides in the writing of the first Jewish Aris-totelian thinker, Abraham Ibn Da’ud, in his book Ha’emunah Haramah: “It issaid that in the books of prophecy, what is achieved by the true philosophy is notstated explicitly, so as not to create difficulties for the understanding of the people,that is the multitudes. Yet, these truths are hinted at, and will awaken the chosenindividuals to understand the inner contents of those hints, and know that wis-dom is to be found in the books of prophecy, whereas the multitude will be con-tented with the revealed level in them” (Berlin, 1919, p. 12). See also Ha’emunahHaramah, p. 39.2. Another radical example of the gap between the traditional elite of Torahscholars and the esotericists can be found in Maimonides’ parable of the palaceinGuide of the Perplexed III:51.3. There is an extensive literature on esotericism in the Aristotelian tradition.For a concise and comprehensive summary, see the article by Robert Lamber-ton in the anthology Secrecy and Concealment(above, Introduction, note 5), pp. 139–152.

Many exegetes of Maimonides were of the opinion that, aside from hintingand scattering of material in the writing of Guide of the Perplexed, the contradic-tions in the book are part of Maimonides’ strategy of concealment. This under-standing is based on the exegesis of the seventh reason for contradictions enumer-ated by Maimonides in his introduction to Guide of the Perplexed. Recently, Yair Lorberbaum suggested an entirely different reading, which links the contra-dictions to essential esotericism. According to this reading, the contradictions arenot an intentional act of concealment, but stem from the very nature of the meta-physical realm. See Y. Lorberbaum, “The Seventh Reason: On The Contradic-tions in the Guide of the Perplexed—A Reevaluation,” Tarbiz69 (2000). On therole of essential esotericism in Maimonides’ understanding, see Y. Lorberbaum,“Maimonides’ Conception of Parable,” master’s thesis, Hebrew University ofJerusalem, 1991.11.

Davidson, Moses Mai-monides: The Man and His Works(Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005), pp. 387–402. If Davidson is correct in his arguments, we still need an explanationfor why Maimonides claims that he is hiding the meaning of his text, given thatsuch a statement would naturally draw much suspicion and misunderstanding.He should have put forward his rather conservative approach without such aclaim altogether.12. For examples of leading modern scholars who argue that eternity of theworld is Maimonides’ esoteric teaching, see A.

The Breaching of the Limits of the Esoteric: Concealment and Disclosure in Maimonidean Esotericism1. Sarah Klein-Breslavy and Leo Strauss disagree as to whether Maimonidesthought that the writing of chapter headings had already been done as part of the writings of the Sages. See Klein-Breslavy,King Solomon and Philosophical Esotericism, p.196n.18; Strauss, Persecution and the Art of Writing. Accordingto Klein-Breslavy, Maimonides was of the opinion that the writing of chapterheadings had a precedent in previous esoteric traditions. It seems to me that thesources cited in Klein-Breslavy’s book could be seen as referring to parablesrather than to chapter headings. Furthermore, Maimonides claims that such hintsare meager and few in number. On the question if, in Maimonides’ view, there ex-isted a written esoteric literature, see the contradiction noted by Klein-Breslavy,King Solomon and Philosophical Esotericism, p.196n.10.2. Strauss, Persecution and the Art of Writing, p. 49.3. See also Maimonides’ writings on the parallel between the Oral Torah andthe secrets of the Torah. Maimonides describes the prohibition against writingdown the Oral Torah in light of his conception that writing resulted in great lax-ity and negligence in the guarding of the reliability and nature of halakhic knowl-edge: “the multiplicity of opinions, the variety of schools, the confusions occurringin the expression of what is put down in writing, the negligence that accompanieswhat is written down, the divisions of the people who are separated into sects,and the production of confusion with regard to actions” (GuideI:71, p. 176).Later, Maimonides draws a parallel between the Oral Torah and the secrets of theTorah: “Now if there was insistence that the legalistic science of law should not,in view of the harm that would be caused by such a procedure, be perpetuated ina written compilation accessible to all the people, all the more could none of themysteries of the Torah have been set down in writing and be made accessible toall the people. On the contrary, they were transmitted by a few men belongingto the elite to a few of the same kind” (GuideI:71, p. 176).4. Maimonides thus undermines the basis for potential rivals in esoteric doc-trine, who may make claims against him based on the authority of a particulartradition. In his opinion, the transmission of esoteric tradition has ceased, and, assuch, he possesses no traditions either.5. For further writings on the consciousness of crisis, see GuideII:11, p. 276:“However, when the wicked from among the ignorant communities ruined ourgood qualities, destroyed our words of wisdom and our compilations, and causedour men of knowledge to perish, so that we again became ignorant, as we hadbeen threatened because of our sins . . . and their opinions were taken over by us,as were their morals and actions” (GuideII:11, p. 276). Another force motivatingthe disclosure of secrets is linked to the interior drive of the wise man to propa-gate his words. See GuideII:29, II:37.6. See David Hartman, Maimonides: Torah and Philosophical Quest(Phila-delphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1976).7. Maimonides created new literary molds in halakhic literature as well. In his Mishneh Torah, Maimonides justifies his deviation from previous forms oforganizing halakhic knowledge by means of an innovative concept of the historyNotes to Chapter 8•179"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"of halakhah. He sees his own position within that history as one responding to a deep prevailing crisis. Consequently, he created a work unprecedented in halakhic literature.Chapter9. From Transmission to Writing: Hinting, Leaking,and Orthodoxy in Early Kabbalah1. On the relation between philosophical literature and the disclosure of theKabbalah, see the final chapter of Moshe Idel’s book Kabbalah: New Perspectives(New Haven: Yale University Press, 1988). 2. The letter was published and discussed by Gershom Scholem in Studies in Kab-balah I, ed. Y. Ben-Shlomo and Moshe Idel (Tel Aviv: Am Oved, 1998), pp. 9–10.3. Idel is of the opinion that in this letter, Rabbi Isaac the Blind attempts to de-fend himself against Nahmanides’ criticism. Scholem, and, following him, YosefDan, maintained that the instructions of Isaac the Blind are what engendered theesoteric style of Nahmanides. See M. Idel, “Nahmanides: Kabbalah, Halakha andSpiritual Leadership,” in Moshe Idel and Mortimer Ostow, Jewish MysticalLeaders and Leadership in the Thirteenth Century(Northvale, N.J.: Jason Aron-son, 1998), pp. 15–96.4.

See also Sefer Hayihud, p. 118: “I have explained and clarified to every wiseman and instructed one each and every matter in all its aspects.”Chapter10. Open Knowledge and Closed Knowledge: The Kabbalistsof Gerona—Rabbi Azriel and Rabbi Ya’akov bar Sheshet1. The work was published as part of Derekh Emunah, by Rabbi Meir benGabbai (Berlin, 1850).2. See also the words of Rabbi Azriel in his letter to Burgos: “From the force ofthe hidden it emanated to the heard, and from the heard to the seen. And we haveno dealings with that which is hidden, but with that which was heard, with theten sayings which were seen in the splendor of the lights. For the force of theheard voice emerges from the thin voice of silence” (G. Scholem, “The Kabbalahof Rabbi Ya’akov and Rabbi Yitzhak, the Sons of Rabbi Ya’akov Hacohen:Sources for the History of the Kabbalah preceding the Revelation of the Zohar,”Jewish Studies 2 [Jerusalem, 1927]: 233). Although Scholem attributed the letterto the Cohen brothers, it was apparently written by Rabbi Azriel. See also RabbiAzriel’s words in his composition Derekh Ha’emunah V’derekh Hakfira(TheWay of Faith and the Way of Heresy): “For the language of faith does not applyto what is, that which is seen and conceived, nor to the nothingness that cannot180•Notes to Chapter 10"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"be seen or conceived, but rather to the place of juncture of nothingness and whatis. Being is not separated from nothingness, but being and nothingness together isbeing . . . and all is one in simple and total evenness. And of the investigation ofthis thing it was written ‘Do not make yourself too wise,’ for there is no power inour limited intelligence that can achieve the completeness of investigation whichreaches the infinite. And of this it is written ‘what is concealed from you do not investigate’ ” (Derekh Ha’emunah V’derekh Hakfirah LeRabbi Azriel, in G. Scholem, “New Fragments of the Writings of Rabbi Azriel of Gerona,” Memo-rial Volume Dedicated to Asher Gulak and Shmuel Klein[Jerusalem, 1942], p. 207).3. See Idel’s comments in his Kabbalah: New Perspectives, pp. 253–256, on thelink between creativity and disclosure.4. Like Rabbi Azriel, Rabbi Ya’akov bar Sheshet also diverts the restrictions ofesotericism to the ineffable domain. See his comments on sefirat keter, which heidentifies with will: “And it (Keter) is the beginning and head of all quantity andmeasures. Do not expound what is concealed from you, Let not your desire temptyou to come into its camp, for the matter is too difficult for you, you cannot doit; take heed and do not, for he who increases wisdom increases anger....Theglory of God is in hidden things. . . . The wonders of knowledge that are too profound for me, I cannot bear” (Sha’ar Hashamayim, p. 155).5. “He who reads in my book knows that everything that I did not write in thename of a Sage or that is not mentioned in two or three of the works of the com-mentators or mentioned explicitly in the midrashim, is my own opinion and rea-soning. I toiled and found in my heart, to drink water of my cistern and my well,liquids of what my hand has attained in each and every matter as is fitting, eachone by his own banner. I wrote them down in this composition, whether they bethin or fat. I thus inform all who investigate it that they not think in their heartsthat this is authorized by a rabbi or Sage and thus come to reject his own correctopinion in favor of my despised knowledge, or reject his own clear reasoning infavor of my obscure opinion. When he knows that this is a new thing, let him deliberate in private until he attains the depths of the matter with his own goodreasoning, and then he should consult his words in secret and what he chooses he should endear” (Meshiv Devarim Nekhohim, ed. Y. A. Vajda [Jerusalem:Ha’akademia Hale’umit Ha’yisraelit le’Mada’in, 1969], p. 69).6. See also his words: “It is true that there are seventy facets to the Law, andthese and those are both the words of the living God” (Kitvei HaRamban2:428).See also the disagreements between him and Rabbi Ezra and other kabbalists:“Even though the sages of the Kabbalah do not explain it thus . . .” (KitveiHaRamban2:358). Compare Meshiv Devarim Nekhonim, p. 115. On the vari-ous understandings of the expression elu va’elu (these and those) in halakhic discourse, see A. Sagi, Elu Va’elu(Tel Aviv: Hakibbutz Hameuhad, 1997).7. Maimonides presented an opposite model of comparison. He saw the writ-ing of the Oral Law as something forced upon it by reality, which led to the mul-tiplicity of disputations and commentaries. In his opinion, if not for the historicalconstraints that damaged the uninterrupted transmission, the Oral Law too couldbetter have been preserved as a closed tradition, just like the esoteric teachings.See his remarks in Guide of the PerplexedI:71 (pp. 175–176): “You alreadyknow that even the legalistic science of law was not put down in writing in theNotes to Chapter 10•181"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"olden times because of the precept, which is widely known in the nation: ‘Wordsthat I have communicated to you orally, you are not allowed to put down onwriting.’ This precept shows extreme wisdom with regard to the Law. For it wasmeant to prevent what has ultimately come about in this respect: I mean the multiplicity of opinions, the variety of schools, the confusions occurring in the ex-pression of what is put down in writing, the negligence that accompanies what iswritten down, the divisions of the people who are separated into sects, and theproduction of confusion with regard to actions.” It is interesting to note that insixteenth-century Ashkenaz, the opposition to the writing of systematic halakhicworks stemmed from a diametrically opposite reason. Halakha was to be preservedas an esoteric occupation, transmitted live from teacher to disciple, in order to en-able its local and varied character. The writing of the halakha entailed standard-ization of norms, the undermining of custom, the changing of its nature as a livingtradition, and the weakening of the authority of the rabbi. See the words of RabbiHaim ben Bezalel in his introduction to the Rama’s book Torat Hahatat, whosetitle is Viku’ahMayimHayim(The Dispute of Living Water), on the halakhic lit-erature in Ashkenaz and especially on the composition Sha’arei Doraas a text of an esoteric nature. For the introduction, see H. T chernowitz, The History ofHalakhaists(New York: Va’ad Hayovel, 1948), pp. 93–100 (Hebrew).8. Among the kabbalists of Gerona, Rabbi Ezra did not provide a fundamentalreason for disclosure. In the introduction to his commentary on the Song of Songs,he justified the writing of Torah secrets in terms akin to the consciousness of cri-sis in the esoteric tradition of Maimonides. See Perush Shir Hashirim (Commentaryon the Song of Songs), Kitvei HaRamban2:479. His words also indicate that thephilosophical exegesis of the Song of Songs provoked the writing of kabbalisticexegesis. See Kitvei HaRamban2:480.9. Idel, Kabbalah: New Perspectives, pp. 253–254.Chapter11. Tradition, Closed Knowledge, and the Esoteric: Secrecy and Hinting in the NaHmanides’ Kabbalah1. Nahmanides sees the answer to Job’s complaint in the response of Elihu,which hints at the secrets of intercalation. In speaking of the inner layer of thebook, Nahmanides says: “But in truth there is a great secret in this, one of thegreatest of the mysteries of the Torah. A thinking man cannot attain them, onlyone who is worthy to learn them from a master [who heard it from other masters]going back to our master Moses, of blessed memory, who heard it from the mouthof the Almighty, may He be blessed, and that is what is hinted at in the words ofElihu” (Commentary on the Book of Job, Kitvei HaRamban1:23; see also1:115). The question that arises from this conception is the following: How is itpossible that a kabbalistic secret transmitted only through tradition from onegeneration to another is brought by Elihu, a character that is difficult to link tothe known chain of transmission of the Kabbalah? Nahmanides himself was trou-bled by this question, and in his exposition of Ecclesiastes he added Elihu to thechain of transmission of the Kabbalah: “For in truth, the words of Elihu arewords received from people of the Torah; thus, I say that he is of the family of182•Notes to Chapter 11"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"Ram—Abraham” (Kitvei HaRamban1:199). See also his remarks in his com-mentary on Job, Kitvei HaRamban1:28. Nahmanides sees the Kabbalah as an internal Jewish tradition, as he writes in his homily on the passage “The Law ofthe Lord is perfect”: “As it is written, ‘He tells His words to Jacob, etc....Hedid not do so for other nations, etc.’ For this is the truth, because the Torah con-tains mysteries like the work of creation, as mentioned by Onkelos, and the secret of the vision of the chariot, and many other secrets that were transmittedfrom mouth to mouth and are only given unto the pious ones of Israel” (KitveiHaRamban1:145).2. An interesting question on the connection between exegesis and tradition is the case of King Solomon. According to Nahmanides, Solomon acquired hiswisdom by expounding Scripture: “[For] everything can be learned from theTorah, and King Solomon, peace upon him, whom God had given wisdom andknowledge, derived it all from the Torah, and from it he studied until he knew thesecret of all things created” (Perush HaRamban; Chavel 1:12). By contrast, seeNahmanides’ comments in his homily on “the Law of the Lord is perfect”: “Andfrom the Torah that he received, King Solomon learned that there was written init, etc.” (162).3. See I. M. Ta-Shma, The Revealed in the Hidden(Tel Aviv: HakibbutzHameuhad, 1995), p. 38 (Hebrew).4. On the conception of Nahmanides and his attitude toward the positions ofMaimonides and the geonim on the question of disputation, see M. Halbertal,People of the Book: Canon Meaning and Authority(Cambridge, Mass.: HarvardUniversity Press, 1997), pp. 54–71.5. Nahmanides’ attitude toward the place of reasoning in his discussion of kab-balistic explanations becomes clear through the long quote he brings from thewritings of Rabbi Ezra in his explanation of Song of Songs. Rabbi Ezra explaineda passage of the Book of Job as dealing with the mysteries of the Torah, and onthis Nahmanides testifies: “This is the way [of the kabbalists in their explanationof] these verses; the words themselves should be praised and lauded, but we donot know if the matter supports this explanation. But if it is a kabbalistic tradi-tion, we accept it” (Commentary on the Book of Job, Kitvei HaRamban 1:90).Nahmanides casts doubts on the power of the explanation to withstand the testof reason, but unlike his method in his talmudic innovations, here he is preparedto subordinate reasoning to the dictum of tradition: “But if it is a kabbalistic tradition, we accept it.”6. This issue was discussed at length by Moshe Idel. See M. Idel, “We Have NoKabbalistic Tradition on This,” in Rabbi Moses Nahmanides (Ramban): Explo-rations in His Religious and Literary Virtuosity, ed. I. Twersky (Cambridge,Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1983), pp. 31–81.7. On Nahmanides’ complex relation to Ibn Ezra, see B. Septimus, “Open Re-buke and Concealed Love: Nachmanides and the Andalusian Tradition,” inRabbi Moses Nahmanides, pp. 11–34.8. The disclosure of Torah secrets as a consequence of the dispute with the es-oteric conceptions of Ibn Ezra is evident in Nahmanides’ explanations (followingSefer Habahir) to the Sages’ saying “and the Lord blessed Abraham in all (bakol)—Abraham had a daughter whose name was Bakol.” At the end of a long passageNotes to Chapter 11•183"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"Nahmanides says: “Now, had the commentator who prides himself on his knowl-edge of the Torah’s secrets known this, his lips would be dumb and not deride the words of our Rabbis. Therefore, I have written this in order to silence thosewho speak arrogantly against the righteous ones” (Perush HaRamban1:134;Chavel 1:293).9. Such instructions may be found in other hints of Nahmanides as well. SeePerush HaRambanon the Pentateuch, pp. 23, 30, 33, 50, 68, 71, 99, 112, 134,391, and 434–435.10. On the hermeneutic and kabbalistic conception reflected in this position,see E. Wolfson, “By Way of Truth: Aspects of Nahmanides’ Kabbalistic Hermeneu-tic,”AJS Review14 (1989): 103–178.11. A prominent exception to the general tenor of Nahmanides’ esotericism isSefer Hage’ulah, in which Nahmanides reveals the end time and fixes its date as1358. According to Nahmanides, the immanent messianic age justifies the revela-tion of end times: “And it has also been made possible since we are close to it, be-cause of the great length of time that has already transpired. Perhaps the decreethat demanded that we conceal it (the date of the end time) is annulled, since thereason for its declaration is no longer valid. For it was written that it shall be aftermany days, then, ‘many will run to and fro and knowledge shall increase.’ Thus,it was hinted to us that we are permitted to search for the end-time in this bookand increase our knowledge. For its meaning, as the instructed will understand,is that when the end-time approaches the instructed shall understand these hints”(Sefer Hage’ulah, Kitvei HaRamban1:290). The coming approach of the end-time enables its precise revelation. See his writings on the study of gematriaandthe end-time in Sefer Hage’ulah1:262–263.Chapter12.

I am thankful to Yoni Garb for pointing to the references from this manu-script of Meir Ibn Sahula, MS Rome Angelika 45/1.3. In another context, he refers to the relation between Kabbalah and logicalreasoning: “I did not receive this from tradition, but I say ‘Open my eyes that I may gaze on the wonders of your Law’ ” (Sefer Yetzira100b).4.

Abrams, “The Book of the Orah of Rabbi Ya’akov ha-Cohen” (Ph.D. diss., New York University,1993), p. 215; see also p. 236. On the Cohen brothers and Moshe of Burgos, see Gershom Scholem, “The Kabbalah of R. Yitzhak ben Ya’akov ha-Cohen—R. Moshe of Burgos the Disciple of R. Yitzhak,”Tarbiz Supplement4 (1933)(Hebrew), including, for example, the words of Moshe of Burgos on the Kab-balah: “Far and strange from the eyes of all, without deliberation or reasoning, it is the faithful Kabbalah which is transmitted to all bearers of hidden wisdom”(p. 208).12. It is of interest to note that the expression “two seeds at the summit of a tall tree,” with which Shem Tov describes the Cohen brothers, appears in thewritings of Rabbi Yitzhak Cohen on those who know the secrets of the sefirotofthe left side: “For this is a path in which, aside from myself, only two or threehave trodden. They are seeds at the summit of a tall tree, the ancient wise men,the sages of Sepharad who made used of the palace of Samael” (see Scholem,“Kabbalah of R. Yitzhak ben Ya’akov ha-Cohen,” p. 224). It seems that there isa direct reference, perhaps even ironic, of Shem Tov to the writings of the Cohenbrothers themselves.13. The tension erupted into a full-scale confrontation between Shem Tov’smaster, the Rashba and Avraham Abulafia. Among other subjects characterizingthis tension, we may mention Abulafia’s complete liberation from the bonds of esotericism, to the dismay of other kabbalists, as Abulafia himself describes: “Although I know that among the kabbalists are many who did not reach perfec-tion, and thought they had perfected themselves by not revealing esoteric matters,I do not heed their thoughts, even when they condemn me for disclosing things,for in this matter, my opinion is much different from or opposite to theirs” (OtzarEden Ganuz, Oxford manuscript 1580).

It is of interest to note that Ibn Tibon is precise in his description of the different stages in the chain of widening, as opposed to the description of Mai-monides. Solomon adds parable to parable, and his parables are a more transpar-ent description of the parables of the Pentateuch and its hints. Maimonides, bycontrast, combines chapter headings to each other, and, as we saw above, he re-jects the possibility of esoteric writing by means of parables.2. The formula “widening the apertures of the showpiece” appears frequentlyin the writings of Ibn Tibon. See Ma’amar Yikavu Hamayim, pp. 40, 141, 146,164. See also his words at the top of p. 123 and on pp. 142–143.3. The conception of progress in the disclosure of the secrets of the Torah in thethought of Ibn Tibon was pointed out by Avi Ravitzky, “Samuel Ibn Tibon andthe Secret of the Guide of the Perplexed,” Da’at10 (1983): 19–46 (Hebrew).4. Ibn Tibon derived his idea of progress from the understanding of the reasonsfor the commandments in Maimonides’ thought. There, Maimonides used themyth of the nations of the Sabeans in order to explain the need to uproot idola-trous beliefs and practices. Maimonides did not, however, use the concept ofprogress in order to permit the disclosure of Torah secrets.5.

Esotericism, Sermons, and Curricula: Ya’akov Anatoli and the Dissemination of the Secret1. Later in his book Sefer Hamusar(chap. 15), Ibn Kaspi levies a more severecriticism of talmudic culture, based on Maimonides’ words. On the question ofthe formulation of the curriculum in the Middle Ages and on the different com-peting elements, see J.

The various formulations of Maimonides concerning the Mishneh Torahgive rise to an ambiguous position, although, in my opinion the weight of evidencesupports the more radical approach. In response to the criticism of Rabbi PinhasHadayan on the Mishneh Torah, Maimonides claimed that he never attempted to precipitate change in the curriculum. See Igrot HaRambam, ed. Y. Shilat(Jerusalem: Ma’aliyot Press, 1988), 2:439. In other places, however, he claimedthat the Mishneh Torahbears the role of replacing the talmudic curriculum,186•Notes to Chapter 14"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"based on the estimation that the value of talmudic study lies only in its halakhicconclusions.

Stern, “Menachem Ha-Meiri and the SecondControversy over Philosophy” (Ph.D. diss., Harvard University, 1995). I havedealt extensively with this dispute in my book Between Torah and Wisdom, chap. 5. This section is a summary of the discussion, focusing on the question ofesotericism within the dispute.2. “For upon that day there was a wedding of one of the renowned, and one ofthe notables of the land spoke harshly with us; in the presence of the masses, hesaid of Abraham and Sarah of Scripture that they were matter and form”(Hoshen Mishpat, p. 174). See there also for a vivid description of the feast inwhich the sermon was preached and for other philosophical allegories currentamong the preachers of Provence. See also Minhat Kna’ot, ed. Haim ZalmanDimitrovsky (Jerusalem: Mossad Harav Kook, 1990), p. 316.3. According to the Rashba, the Christians too would have punished those ex-pounding such allegories, for they threatened the historical existence of the fore-fathers: “For the islands of the Cutheans, who are Canaanites, and all the nationswould have punished them as heretics, even for one of their words and iniquitouslaws that they have inscribed in books. For one who says that Abraham andSarah are matter and form, they would surround him with faggots and burn himto lime, for all the nations derive their lineage from them. Yet they say that theywere naught but parables, they and their sons” (Minhat Kna’ot, pp. 412–413).4. The accusation that the allegorists intended to empty the commandments oftheir binding content appears in the letters of the Rashba and the notables ofBarcelona: “And their intent is transparent to say that the commandments are notto be understood according to their simple meaning. . . . All is but parable andhigh words, and they uphold the falsehood to mislead the fools. And through ser-pentine ways they tend” (Minhat Kna’ot, pp. 411–412).5.Minhat Kna’ot,p. 724.6. In chapter 9 of Minhat Kna’ot, Abba Mari identifies himself with the con-ception that contemplation is the supreme religious goal, and its accomplishmentassures divine providence and eternal life: “And for this reason, it was hinted atin the mezuzah,as it is written, ‘The Lord our God, the Lord is One,’ so that onemake the effort to know wisdom until he apprehend the existence of the Lord,may He be praised, and his oneness with a proof, and then he should take heednot to serve anyone but Him. Then the providence of God shall cleave unto himso that he may be protected from evil forces, and it shall be more precious to himthan all the pearls of the world . . . for the attainment of Him, may He be blessed,Notes to Chapter 15•187"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"is the true success and salvation and the eternal life, and it is the purpose of theintentions of the Torah” (Minhat Kna’ot, pp. 246–247).7. For similar formulations, see Minhat Kna’ot, pp. 426–427, ll. 10–15.8. See also the Rashba’s derision of the definition of wisdom as the vision of thechariot: “to the jiggling chariot” (Minhat Kna’ot, p. 378).9. The tension between the Rashba’s attack on wisdom and the formulation ofthe ban emerged in the comments of Rabbi Ya’akov ben Makhir addressed to theRashba; see Minhat Kna’ot, p. 507.10. The Rashba himself changed his tone when addressing his opponents inProvence. In those passages he sounded very close to the position of Abba Mari.See the words addressed to Rabbi Shlomo of Lunel (Minhat Kna’ot, pp. 470–471),to Rabbi Ya’akov ben Makhir (p. 516), to Rabbi Shmuel ben Reuven (pp. 542–543),and to Rabbi Yitzhak De-Lates (p. 550).11. Abba Mari sought to suppress HaMeiri’s letter to him and not publish it.To his dismay, HaMeiri preceded him and sent the letter to his opponents. Theopponents of Abba Mari in Montpelier found in HaMeiri’s authority an impor-tant source of support, and did all they could to diffuse the letter and utilize it fortheir own purposes. Hoshen Mishpat, p. 151.12. The shifts in loyalty resulting from the ambivalence of the ban is character-istic not only of HaMeiri, but of other persons involved in the dispute as well. SeemyBetween Torah and Wisdom, p. 174.13. Abba Mari truly attempted to anchor his struggle in terms of the ProvencalMaimonidean culture, whereas his opponents saw the struggle, especially in re-sponse to the Rashba, as a slander against the Provencal tradition and as a question-ing of the status of Maimonides himself. Consequently, Abba Mari’s opponentssaw the dispute as a repetition of the dispute against the writings of Maimonides,which took place in the fourth decade of the thirteenth century in Provence. Thisdispute, whose violent end left scars on the community, and which resulted in theascendancy of the supporters of Maimonides, remained as a traumatic memory inthe minds of all involved in it: “For it is fitting that we remember the form of thefirst dispute that we knew and heard of when the books of our master, the teacherof righteousness, arrived here. For who could have predicted the extent of dam-age, pain, and humiliation which resulted from it” (Hoshen Mishpat, p. 153).14. Later on in his writing, Rabbi Shimon ben Yosef disputed the comparisondrawn by HaMeiri between the opponents of Maimonides in the dispute over hiswritings and the faction of Abba Mari, and firmly rejected the comparison:“What is this conjoining that you joined the matter of fury. Reminding us of thesin of the previous dispute. You have compared our deeds to those who spokeagainst God and Moses. . . . What fault have you found in us and in our deeds?Who envied the revelers who attacked our prince, our lord, the wise RabbiMoshe and his books? Who gathered this wind of envy in his fist and trampledhis enemies underfoot? Who was his aide against his enemies, if not our fatherswho came to his assistance? . . . What relevance does that dispute have that yousummon up its presence?” (Hoshen Mishpat, p. 153). According to Rabbi Shimon ben Yosef, Abba Mari and his circle belong to the same tradition that rejected the opponents of Maimonides in Provence, so that no one should attachto them the guilt for “the first dispute.”188•Notes to Chapter 15"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"15. For a fascinating parallel to the metaphor of the uncovering of secrets asthe sexual abuse of a maiden in the Neoplatonic literature, see the material ana-lyzed by P. Hadot, The Veil of Isis: An Essay on the History of the Idea of Nature,trans. M. Chase (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 2006), pp. 61–62.Chapter16. Esotericism, Discontent, and Co-Existence1. In his commentary on the Pentateuch, the Rashbam uses the term maskilormaskilim, and also singles out certain groups among his readers. But the maskildoes not expose a hidden theological layer of the text. On the contrary, he is ori-ented toward the surface meaning and deviated from the traditional-authoritativereading of the text. According to Elazar Tuito, the maskilis familiar with thereadings of the surface meaning developing in the Christian world. See E. Tuito,“The Rashbam’s Approach in His Interpretation to the Legal Parts of Torah,”Milet2 (1984): 275–288 (Hebrew); on the maskil, see n. 4.2. It is no wonder that Rabbi Moshe Takku, the great polemic defender of talmudic-midrashic faith, attacked the idea that there was a deep allegoricalhermeneutic layer to the sacred scriptures or the Talmud. Furthermore, he sawthe esoteric canon as an act of deception and trickery.3. On this broader question, see Z. Griss, “The Copying and Printing of Kabbalistic Books as Source for the Study of Kabbalah,” Mahanaim6 (1992):204–211.Chapter17.

The open-ended nature of the concealed appears in completely different cul-tural settings.

In his essay “Removing Knowledge” in CriticalInquiry(2003), Peter Galison argues that the secret classified material sometimesbecomes obsolete because it is not examined by the rest of the scientific commu-nity and therefore it might be false and fantastic. Among other problems, thepressure to uncover the secrets comes from the desire for a fuller and enriched useof them in, for example, industry technology. The secret material is thus under adouble pressure: if it is effective, it will come out; if it stays concealed, it might becompletely nonsensical.16.Kant’s Political Writings, ed.
