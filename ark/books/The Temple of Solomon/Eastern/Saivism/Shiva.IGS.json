[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Shiva Mahimna1SHIVA MAHIMNA STOTRAM: HYMN ON THE GREATNESS OF SIVAThe Shiva Mahimna Stotra is very popular among the devotees of Lord Shiva and isconsidered one of the best among all Stotras (or Stutis) offered to Lord Shiva. The legendabout the circumstances leading to the composition of this Stotra is as follows.A king named Chitraratha had constructed a nice garden. There were beautiful flowers inthis garden. These flowers were used every day by the king in worshipping Lord Shiva.One day a Gandharva (Singer in the court of Indra, the Lord of the Heaven) namedPushhpadanta being fascinated by the beautiful flowers, began to steal them, as aconsequence of which king Chitraratha could not offer flowers to Lord Shiva. He triedvery hard to capture the thief, but in vain, because the Gandharvas have divine power toremain invisible.Finally the king spread the Shiva Nirmaalya in his garden. Shiva Nirmaalya consists ofthe Bilva leaves, flowers, etc. which have been used in worshipping Lord Shiva. TheShiva Nirmaalya is considered holy. The thief Pushhpadanta, not knowing this, walkedon the Shiva Nirmaalya, and by that he incurred the wrath of Lord Shiva and lost thedivine power of invisibility. He then designed a prayer to Lord Shiva for forgiveness. Inthis prayer he sung the greatness of the Lord. This very prayer became well known as the'Shiva Mahimna Stotra'. Lord Shiva became pleased by this Stotram, and returnedPushhpadanta's divine powers. The recital of this stotra is very beneficial, and ShriRamakrishna, one of the famous saints of the nineteenth century, went into samadhi justby reciting a few verses from this hymn.1.If the praise of Thee by one who is ignorant of the extent of Thy greatness beunbecoming, then the praises of even Brahma and others are inadequate for Thee. And ifall remain unblamable by praising Thee according to their intellectual powers, then eventhis attempt on my part to compose a hymn is free from any blemish.2.Thy greatness is beyond the reach of mind and speech. Who will praise That whicheven the Vedas describe with trepidation by the method of 'not this, not this'? - how manyqualities does That possess? and can be perceived by whom? Yet to the form taken later,whose mind and speech do not turn?3.O Brahman! Does the praise of even Brihaspati cause any wonderment to Thee who artthe author of the nectar like sweet Vedas? O Destroyer of Tripura, the thought that bypraising Thy glories I shall purify my speech has prompted me to undertake this work.4.O Giver of boons, in refutation of Thy Divinity which is described by the three Vedas,which creates, preserves and destroys the world, and which is divided into three bodiesaccording to the different qualities, some thick headed persons offer arguments, whichare pleasing to the ignorant but in reality hateful.5.To fulfil what desire, having what body with what instruments, support, and materialsdoes that creator indeed create the three worlds? - this kind of vain argumentation withregard to Thee whose Divine nature is beyond vociferous to the delusion of mankind.6.O Lord of gods, can the worlds be without origin though they have parts? Is creation ofthe worlds possible without a creator? Who else but God can begin the creation of theworlds? Because they are fools, they raise doubts as regards Thy existence.7.There are different paths of realization as enjoined by the three Vedas, Samkhya, Yogaand Pasupata doctrine and Vaishnava Sastras. Persons following different paths - straightor crooked according as they consider that this path is best or that one is proper due to thedifference in temperaments, reach Thee alone just as rivers enter the ocean."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"2Shiva Mahimna8.O Giver of boons, a great bull, a wooden club, an axe, a tiger skin, ashes, a human skulland the like - these are Thy sole possessions, though by the mere casting of eyes Thougave the gods great treasures which they enjoy. Indeed, the mirage of sense - objectscannot delude one whose delight is in the Self.9.O Destroyer of Pura some say that the whole universe is eternal, while others say thatall is transitory. Yet others maintain that all these are eternal and non-eternal - havingdifferent characteristics. Bewildered, as it were by them I do not feel ashamed to praiseThee. Indeed this garrulity indicates my audacity.10.O Girisha, Brahma trying above and, Vishnu trying below failed to measure Thee whotook the form of a pillar of fire. Afterwards when they praised Thee with great devotionand faith, Thou revealed Thyself to them of thy own accord, indicating whether Thyworship can go without bearing result.11.O Destroyer of Tripura, that the ten-headed Ravana, after riding the three worlds ofany trace of enemies, remained with arms eager for fresh war is due to the fact of hishaving great devotion to Thee devotion which prompted him to offer his heads as lotusesto Thy feet.12.When Ravana extended the valour of his arms whose strength was obtained byworshipping Thee - to Kailasa, Thy abode, Thou moved the tip of Thy toe, and he did notget a resting place even in the nether world. Verily, when affluent the wicked becomesdeluded.13.O Giver of boons, that Bana, who had the three worlds at his command, put to shadethe wealth of Indra is not to be wondered at - he being the worshipper of Thy feet. Whatprosperity does not result from bowing down the head to Thee?14.O Three eyed one, it is not that the dark stain on the throat of Thee who drank poisonas an act of favor to gods and demons at their being panicky at the threatened destructionof the universe all on a sudden, has not beautified Thee. Even deformity is admirable inone who is given to freeing the worlds of fear.15.O Lord, the god of love whose arrows do not fail anywhere in the world of gods,demons and men but are always successful became simply an object of memory bylooking upon Thee as an ordinary god. For an insult to the self controlled does notconduce to good.16.In order to save the world when Thou danced, the earth wondered at the striking ofThy feet, whether it would not come to sudden end; so felt the spatial region along withthe planets, oppressed by the movement of Thy iron-cube like arms; and the heavenbecame then miserable - its side being struck by Thy waving matted hair. Ah, Thy verymightiness is the cause of trouble.17.The river which pervades the sky and whose foams look all the more beautifulbecause of stars and planets, seems no more than a drop of water when on Thy head. Thatagain has turned the world into islands surrounded by waters. And by this should beinferred how vast is Thy divine body.18.When Thou wanted to burn the three cities which were but a piece of straw, the earthwas Thy chariot, Brahma Thy charioteer, the great mountain Meru Thy bow, the sun andthe moon the wheels of Thy chariot, Vishnu Thy arrow why this paraphernalia? The Lordis not dependent on others - He was playing with things at his command."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Shiva Mahimna319.O Destroyer of Tripura, Hari rooted out his lotus eye to make deficiency when oneflower was missing in his offering of a thousand lotuses to Thy feet; this great devotiontransformed into a discus is alert in protecting the three worlds.20.The sacrifice being destroyed Thou ever remainest the connecting link between thesacrificers and the fruit of the sacrifice. When does the destroyed sacrifice bear fruit, ifnot accompanied by the worship of the Lord? Therefore knowing Thee to be the giver offruits and putting faith in the Vedas, people become resolute about the performance ofsacrifical rites.21.Thou Giver of refuge, even the sacrifice where Daksha, the Lord of creation expert insacrifices was the sacrificer, Rishis were priests, gods were supervisors, was destroyed byThee though Thou art bent upon giving fruits of the sacrifices. Surely the sacrifices causeinjury to the sacrificers in the absence of devotion.22.O Lord, the fury of Thee who became a hunter with a bow in hand has not as yet leftBrahma though, keenly pierced by Thy arrow and terror stricken, he has fled to the sky.23.O Destroyer of Tripura, O Giver of boons even on seeing in front the god of love, bowin hand burnt like a sraw in a trice by Thee, if Parvati proud of her beauty thinks thatThou art under her fascination, because she was allowed to occupy half of Thy body onaccount of austerities, ah, surely the young women are under delusion.24.O Destroyer of the god of love, O Giver of boons, Thy play is in cremation grounds,Thy companions are the ghosts, Thou besmearest Thy body with the ashes of burntbodies and human skulls are Thy garlands all Thy conduct indeed is thus full of evil. ButThou conduces to the great good of those who remember Thee.25.Thou art indeed that unspeakable truth which the Yogis realize through meditation onthe Self, on controlling the breath according to the scriptural directions, and realize whichthey shed tears of thrilling joy and swimming as it were in a pool of nectar, enjoy innerbliss.26.The wise hold this limiting opinion about Thee - Thou art the Sun, Thou art the Moon,Thou art the Fire, Thou art the Air, Thou art the Water, Thou art the space, thou art theEarth and Thou art the Self. But we do not know that thing which Thou art not.27.O Giver of refuge, with the three letters A,U,M indicating the three Vedas, the threestates, the three worlds and the three gods, the word OM mentions Thee separately.United by the subtle sound the word OM collectively mentions Thee - Thy AbsoluteTrancendent State.28.O Lord, Bhava, Sarva, Rudra, Pasupati, Ugra, Mahadeva, Bhima, and Isana - theseeight names are mentioned even in the Vedas. To Thee who art beloved and effulgent Ibow down.29.O Lover of solitude, my salutations to Thee who are very near as also very far, faraway. O Destroyer of the god of love my salutations to Thee who art the minutest as alsothe largest. O Three eyed One, my salutations to Thee who art the oldest as also theyoungest. This is my salutations to thee who art all as also transcending all.30.Salutations to Brahma in whom Rajas preponderates for the creation of the universe,salutation to Rudra in whom Tamas preponderates for the destruction of the same.Salutation to Vishnu in whom Sattva preponderates for giving happiness to the people,Salutation to Siva who is effulgent and beyond the three attributes."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"4Shiva Mahimna31.O Giver of boons, why is my ill-developed mind subject to misery and where is ThyDivinity - eternal and possessing infinite virtues? Though terror stricken because of this,I am forced by my devotion to offer this hymn at Thy feet.32.O Lord if the blue mountain be the ink, the ocean the ink-pot, the branch of theheavenly tree be pen, the earth the writing leaf, and by taking these if the Goddess ofLearning writes for eternity, even then the limit of Thy virtues will not be reached.33.The best of the demi-gods, Pushpadanta by name, composed in great devotion thisbeautiful hymn of the Lord, who is worshipped by demons, gods and the best of sages,whose praises have been sung who has got the moon on His forehead and who isattributeless.34.The person who with purified heart and in great devotion always reads this beautifulhymn to Siva becomes like Siva after death in the abode of Siva, and while in this worldgets much wealth, long life, many children as also fame.35.There is no God better than Siva, there is no hymn better than the Hymn on TheGreatness of Siva, there is no sacred word better than the name of Siva, there is nothingbetter to be known than the real nature of spiritual teacher.36.Getting initiation into the spiritual life, charity, austerity, pilgrimage, knowledge of thescriptures the performance of sacrificial rites - these do not give one-sixteenth part of themerit that is got by reciting the Hymn on the Greatness Of Siva.37.The Lord of Gandharvas, Pushpadanta by name is the servant of the great God whohas the crescent moon on His forehead. Fallen from his glory due to the anger of theLord, he composed this very beautiful Hymn on the Greatness Of Siva to regain Hisfavor.38.After worshipping Siva, who is adored by gods and who grants heaven and liberation,if one with single minded devotion and folded palms reads the unfailing hymn composedby Pushpadanta, one goes to Siva, being worshipped by Kinnaras.39.This unparalleled, sacred hymn composed by Pushpadanta and describing the glory ofGod is all very fascinating from start to finish.40.This hymnal worship is offered to the feet of Siva. May the ever - propitious Lord ofgods be pleased with me at this.41.O Lord, I do not know the true nature of Thy being - of what kind Thou art. Ofwhatever nature Thou mayest be, O Great God to That my salutation again and again.42.The person who reads this hymn once, twice or thrice is glorified in the abode of Siva,being freed from all sins.43.If a person learns by heart, reads or keeps in the home this hymn, which came out ofthe lips of Pushpadanta and which destroys sins and is dear to Siva, Siva the Lord ofcreation becomes very pleased.Here ends the Hymn on the Greatness of Siva composed by Pushpadanta.I.SADSIVA1.Origin of Linga Image, The Linga of Siva2.Narration of Siva Temples3.Description of Fire – sacrifices.4.Bestower of salvation, Sivalingas, their types and forms5.The glorification of the syllable Om, Pranava and the five-syllabled mantra6.

He can be realized by supreme devotion andnot by other means. Rudra, Hari, Hara and other lords of Devas are ever desirous ofseeing him moved by a great devotion.”One is liberated by devotion unto Siva, devotion to Siva is due to his grace and his graceis due to devotion, just as seed gives rise to the sprout and the sprout produces the seed. Itis by the grace of Siva alone, the means of achievement of the achievable can be realizedand that is the essence of the Vidya, mystic learning, mentioned in the Vedas.Listening to the glory of Siva, glorifying him by means of words and deliberation withinthe mind, constitute the greatest of the means of achievement. Sadasiva is to be heardglorified and meditated upon.Siva alone is glorified as Niskala, nameless and formless, since he is identical withsupreme Brahman. He is also Sakala as he has an embodied form. He is both Sakala andNiskala. It is in his Niskala aspect that the Linga, the linga image is appropriate and in theSakala aspect, the worship of his embodied form is appropriate. Other deities, not beingBrahmin, have no Niskala aspect anywhere. In view of other deities being embodiedalone, are worshipped solely in the bodily form while Siva has Brahmatva and otherJivatva.1.Origin of Linga Image, The Linga of SivaOnce, the noble souls Brahma and Visnu fought with each other, to establish theirSupremacy. In order to eradicate their arrogance, lord Paramesvara, the great lord Siva,showed his unembodied Niskala form in the form of a column in their midst. He showedhis phallus emblem separate, evolved out of the column with a desire to bless the threeworlds. The embodied forms of different Devas yield only enjoyment whilst Siva, thelinga emblem and the embodied form together bestow auspicious enjoyment andsalvation.Once, long ago, foremost among Yogins, Visnu, was having a nap on his serpant – couch,surrounded by the goddess of fortune and his attendants when Brahma, the foremostamong the Vedic Scholars happened to come there and asked the lotus-eyed Visnu tostand as a mark of respect for him. Brahma even told Visnu that expiatory rights wereordained for that spiteful wretch who behaved like a haughty fool at the site of ahonourable elderly person.Visnu did not loose his cool and asked Brahma to sit on the couch. Brahma told Visnuthat he was the protector of the world. On this Visnu told Brahma that the whole universe"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"6Shiva Mahimnawas situated within him and that Brahma’s thinking was that of a thief. He further toldBrahma that he was born of the lotus from his naval-region and that he was his son.Arguing with each other, claiming that each was better than the other, they got ready tofight like two foolish goats desirous of killing each other. The two heroic deities, seatedon their respective vehicles, namely the Swan and the Garuda, fought together along withtheir attendants.The scene was witnessed by different groups of Devas moving about in aerial chariotsand scattered flowers everywhere. The Garuda vehicle deity, Visnu became infuriatedand discharged unbearable arrows and many kinds of weapons on Brahma’s chest.Brahma too hurled many arrows of fiery fury with different kinds of weapons on Visnu.The Devas commented on the wondrous fight and were agitated, Visnu in his great furyand mental agitation breathed hard and discharged the Maheswara weapon over Brahma.Annoyed at this, Brahma aimed the terrible Pasupata weapon at the chest of Visnu. Thesetwo weapons of Brahma and Visnu faced each other in terrible clash. Devas in theirhelpless agitation and vexation talked among themselves as people do at the time of warbetween the monarchs.The three pointed trident bearing deity, the supreme Brahma; Siva was the cause ofcreation, maintenance, annihilation, concealment and blessing. Without His corroborationeven any individual anywhere cannot split a blade of grass. Devas, thus desired to go toSiva’s abode and accordingly came to the summit of Kailasa, where the moon crestedgod rested. On seeing that region of Paramesvara in the shape of Omkara, they bent theirheads down in reverence and entered the palace. Siva, the supreme leader of the Devaswas brilliantly shining on the gem-set seat in the company of Uma on an altar in themiddle of the council-chamber. His right leg was kept on the knee of the left, his lotuslike hands were placed over the legs with his attendants all round him.Devas were happy to see the lords. The lord on seeing the Devas beckoned them to himthrough his attendants and addressed them gravely with sweet auspicious words.Iswara asked them of their well being saying that if they were happy under his suzerainty.He told them that he was aware of the fight between Brahma and Visnu and agitation intheir part was like a redundant speech. In that very assembly the lord announced hisdesire to go to the battlefield of Hari and Brahma and accordingly issued His directive toa hundred of the commanders of his attendants.2.Narration of Siva TemplesSiva’s all temples accord salvation. The Earth, fifty crores of yojanas in extent,abounding in mountains and forests, supports the people at the bidding of Siva. The lordhas himself raised up these temples and holy centres in different places for the liberationof the residents of these localities. These temples whether self-risen or not, in view oftheir being accepted (as their frequent resort) by the sages and Devas are intended for theredemption of the people.An intelligent man shall resort to Ganga or the Kaveri River; certainly the sins will bequelled thereby. There are many holy centres yielding Rudraloka. Only by good conduct,good predilections and good concepts as well as by being sympathetic can the devoteederive the benefit, not otherwise. Meritorious actions performed in a holy centre flourishin many ways. Sinful acts committed in a holy centre, though slight, become manifold.If the sin committed in a holy centre is only for livelihood, the merit will destroy that sin.Merit accords prosperity and quells physical, verbal and mental sins. The mental sin is"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Shiva Mahimna7adamantine in sticking to the sinner and it continues for many Kalpas. The mental sin canbe wiped off only by meditation and not otherwise. Japas and the physical sin wipe offthe verbal sin by forcefully causing the emaciation of the body. Sins committed by meansof wealth can be wiped off by making charitable gifts and not otherwise, though crores ofKalpas (aeons) may elapse.Hence those who wish for happiness must refrain from committing sins.3.Description of Fire – sacrifices.Householders who have started their Aupasana rite shall maintain the rite in thesacrificial fire kept in a vessel or pit always. The offering in the fire in the evening for thefire-god is the bestower of prosperity. The offering in the morning for the sun god isconducive to longevity. This is called Agniyajna in as much as it enters the sun during theday.The different sacrifices Sthalipaka etc. for the propitiation of Indra and other gods byofferings in the fire are called Devayajna. The rites of Caula (ceremony of tonsure) etc.are performed in the ordinary fire.The regular study of the Vedas is called Brahmayajna. A Brahmin shall perform thisconstantly for the propitiation of gods. This is to be practiced by all and hence no specialrules are prescribed.At the beginning of the first creation, the omniscient, merciful lord Mahadeva created thedifferent weekdays for the benefit of the entire world. Lord Mahadeva, the globalphysician, the omniscient, the panacea of all panaceas, made the first day his own daythat bestows good health.Next he created the day of Maya, Illusion, the bestower of prosperity. Afterwards whenthe birth of Kumara was attended with some mishaps, he created the day for the sake ofsurmounting mishaps and idleness. With a desire to bless the worlds and for their nurtureand protection, he created the next day dedicated to Visnu, the protector of the worlds.The next day created by the lord is for the sake of longevity of the worlds dedicated to thecreator of the three worlds, Brahma, called also Paramesthin, who is the bestower oflongevity too. Hence this day too bestows longevity.The last two days are the bestowers of worldly enjoyments and removers of prematuredeath respectively. The world made the sun etc. is His own manifestations and is firmlyestablished in solar cycle, Jyotiscakra, the lords of different days. Their worship in theirrespective days accord the respective benefits viz: - health, riches, removal of sickness,nourishment, longevity, enjoyment of pleasures and prevention of death respectively. It issaid that respective merits of the different days are secured through the gratification ofthe gods. Siva is the ultimate bestower of the fruits accruing from the worship of othergods as well.In the ailments, of the eyes or head or for quelling leprosy, the sun shall be worshippedand the Brahmins fed for a day, a month, a year or three years. If the action meritoriousor otherwise that has begun to fructify is sufficiently strong, the ailment, old age etc. arealleviated. The repetition of the mantras of the favourite deity accords the respectivebenefits of the day of the week. The first day of the week dedicated to the sun has thespecial merit of the removal of sin, especially for Brahmins.For the sake of riches, the intelligent devotee shall worship Lakshmi etc. on Monday withcooked rice soaked in ghee and shall feed Brahmin couples.For alleviating ailments, the devotee shall worship Kali and others on Tuesday."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"8Shiva MahimnaHe shall feed Brahmins with an Adhaka a measure of cooked rice, the pulse, black gramand green gram. The scholarly devotee shall worship Visnu with curd-rice onWednesday. Sons, friends, women folk etc. will always be well nourished forever.A person who seeks longevity shall worship the deities for their gratification, with sacredthreads, cloth, milk and ghee on Thursday. On Friday for the sake of enjoyment ofworldly pleasures, the devotee shall worship devas with concentration. Brahmins shouldbe propitiated with the cooked food consisting of six flavours. Good cloth should bepresented to women to gladden them. The wise devotee shall worship Rudra and otherson Saturday that wards off premature death, by performing Homa with gingerly seeds. Heshall make gifts to the Brahmins and feed them with cooked rice and gingerly seeds. Thusworshipping the deities he shall derive the fruit of good health etc.4.Bestower of salvation, Sivalingas, their types and formsSiva gets delighted by the dedication of selves and bestows the salvation of completeidentity. This lifetime offering shall be made only to Siva. Siva exemplifies birth in asmuch as He has the form of both Yoni (vaginal passage) and Linga (Penis). Hence inorder to ward off births, the Janmapuja is of Siva alone.The entire universe consisting to the movable and the immovable is of the nature ofBindu (dot) and Nada (sound). Bindu is Sakti (Power) and Siva is Nada. Hence Siva andSakti pervade the universe. Bindu is the support of Nada. The universe has the support ofBindu. Both Bindu and Nada together support the entire universe. The unification of theBindua and the Nada is called Sakalikarana and the universe takes its birth as a result ofthis Sakalikarana.The Linga emblem is the fusion of Bindu and the Nada (sound) and is the cause of theuniverse. Bindu is the goddess and Siva is the Nada and the fusion of the two is the lingaemblem of Siva. Hence to ward off future births, the devotee shall worship the lingaemblem of Siva. Goddess of the form of Bindu is the mother and Siva of the form ofNada is the father. Great bliss is the result of the worship of the parents. The devoteeshall worship the linga emblem for the acquisition of the Great Bliss.The lord delighted at the worship of His symbol, wards off the function of the symbol,that function being birth etc. cease.The worship should be performed on Sundays, which wards off births. The devotee shallworship the great linga emblem on Sundays with the syllable Om. The syllable Om(a+u+m) is Dhvani Linga.The svayambhu linga is Nada Linga; the Yantra, diagrammatic contrivance, isBindulinga. “M syllable is the installed, Pratisthita, linga. “U” syllable is mobile, Cara,Linga and the “A” syllable is a Linga of huge form Guruvigraha. A person who worshipsthe lingas perpetually becomes liberated soul undoubtedly.A devout worship of Siva liberated man from the bondage of births. A fourth benefit isachieved by wearing Rudraksa beads sacred to Siva and a moiety is achieved by smearingthe holy ashes over the forehead. Three-fourths can be achieved by the recital of mantrasand a man becomes full-fledged devotee by means of worship. A man who worships boththe linga emblem of Siva and the devotees of Siva attains salvation. Stable devotion canbe found firmly established and flourishing only in that person who reads or listens to itattentively.5.The glorification of the syllable Om, Pranava and the five-syllabled mantraThe syllable Om means an excellent boat to cross the ocean of worldly existence."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Shiva Mahimna9Pra = of the Prakriti i.e. the world evolved out of it. Navam – Navam Varam – anexcellent boat, Pranava, Om, is that which leads to salvation. Or it may mean that whichleads to new knowledge. After annihilating all actions it gives the persons who repeat themantra or worship, a fresh knowledge of the pure soul. This Pranava is two-fold (1) thesubtle (2) the gross.The subtle one is of a single syllable where the constituent five syllables are notdifferentiated clearly. The gross one is of five syllables where all the constituent syllablesare manifest.The subtle one is for the liberated living soul, jivanmukta. The need for the contemplationof the meaning through the mantra is only up to the destruction of the physical body.When the body is destroyed, he completely merges in Siva undoubtedly. The mererepeater of the mantra attains the yogic communion with Siva certainly.A person who repeats the mantra thirty-six crores of times, certainly attains the yogiccommunion. The subtle Pranava is again two fold – the short and the long.The long one is present in the heart of the Yogins alone – separately in the form of “A”syllable, “U” syllable, “M” syllable, Bindu and Nada. It is endowed with all the digits ofthe time sound. Siva. Sakti and their union are indicated by “M” syllable ramified intothree and this is called the short subtle Pranava (OM). The short Pranava shall be recitedand repeated by those who desire their all sins annihilated.The devotee who practices the Japa of Pranava (Om) with due ritualistic placing offingers on the parts of his body becomes a sage. He shall attain all the benefits of theritualistic Nyasa such as the blessings of ten mothers and the (attainment of) sixpathways.As for those who are devoted to activities and those who both refrain from and indulge inactivities, the gross Pranava is recommended. Sivayogins are of three types being devotedto Rites, Austerities and Japas.The Kriyayogin is the one who engages him in sacred rites and worship spending money,using limbs of the body and uttering words Namah (obeisance) etc.Tapoyogin is the one who desists from injuring others, restrains all external sense organs,take limited quantities of food and performs worships.Japayogin is the one who is quiet, performs Japa always, is free from all sorts of desiresand maintains all observances.A five-syllabled mantra of Siva is the Gross Pranava. The name Siva is used in the dativecase with Namah prefixed. (Namah Sivaya – Homage to Siva). It implies the fiveprinciples. The Japa of the five-syllabled manta shall always be performed along withPranava i.e. OM NAMAH SIVAYA.

With Sakti seated on his left thigh, He shines withHis great concourse of attendants around Him.He bears the moon on his forehead. He shows the gestures of bestowing boon andoffering freedom from fear. He is the cause of perpetual blessing. He is Sadasiva. Heshall be mentally worshipped at first or stationed in the heart or in the solar zone. Whileperforming the Japa of the five syllabled mantra, he shall sit facing the east."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"10Shiva Mahimna6. The nature of bondage and liberation and Glorification of linga emblem of SivaA Jiva is said to be bondage if the noose of eight fold primary essences, Prakriti etc, tieshim up. When freed from them, he is called liberated. Perfect control and subjugation ofPrakriti and its offshoots is Salvation. A Jiva in bondage when freed from it is called aliberated soul. The set of eight that binds is – Prakriti, Buddhi (cosmic intellect),Ahamkara (cosmic ego) of the nature of attributes, and the five Tanmatras (cosmicprinciples of Ether etc.) The body is evolved out of these eight. The body carries onactivities. The activities generate the body. Thus birth and activities continue in a series.The body is of three types: the gross, the subtle and the casual. The gross body isresponsible for all activities; the subtle body yields the enjoyment of pleasures throughthe senses. The casual body is for the sake of experiencing the good and the bad results ofthe activities of the Jiva.The Jiva experiences happiness as a result of virtue and misery as a result of sin. The Jivabound by the rope of activities revolves round and round for ever like a wheel by meansof the three types of body and their activities.The creator of the wheel must be worshipped for the cessation of the revolution of thewheel. The Prakriti etc. constitute the great wheel and Siva is beyond the Prakriti. Thecreator of the wheel is Lord Siva. He is beyond the Prakriti. Just as a boy drinks or spitsout water as he pleases so also Siva keeps Prakriti etc. just as he pleases. He is called Sivabecause he has brought it under his control (Vasikrta). Siva alone is omniscient, perfectand free from desire.The mental prowess of Mahesvara which Vedas alone can comprehend consists ofomniscience, satiety, beginning less understanding, independence, never failing andinfinite power. Hence Prakriti etc. come under control due to Siva’s grace. One shallworship Siva alone for the acquisition of Siva’s grace. The result of self-less worship of aperfect being is an activity done with dedication to Siva causes pleasure to a being.Keeping Siva in view, the devotee has to worship the linga or the embodied image ofSiva. He has to worship his devotee by means of the body, mind, speech and moneyspent.Siva, the great lord, who is beyond Prakriti is delighted at the worship and speciallyblesses the worshipper. The Karma etc. come under control gradually due to Siva’s grace.Beginning with Karma and ending with Prakriti when everything comes under control,the Jiva is called liberated and he shines as a self-realised person.By the grace of Siva, when his body that is resultant from activities (Karmadeha) comesunder control, the devotee attains residence in Sivaloka. This is called Saloka form ofliberation. When the subtle elements come under control, the devotee attains nearness toSiva. Then he attains similarity with Siva by means of weapons and activities. This iscalled Sarupya. When the devotee acquires the great favour, the cosmic intellect toocomes under control.The mental prowess of Siva becomes his without any difficulty. On acquiring theomniscience and prosperity of Siva, the devotee becomes resplendent in his soul; this iscalled Sayujya, complete identity by persons well versed in the Vedas and Agamas,sacred texts. It is in this order that one gets salvation by the worship of the linga image ofSiva.Hence the devotee shall worship Siva by performing sacred rites etc. for the acquisitionof Siva’s favour, Siva’s sacred rites, Siva’s penance, and the Japas of Siva mantras"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Shiva Mahimna11always.

The rules governing worship of Siva in the linga and other formsThe first linga form is the Pranava that confers all desires. It is called Suksma Pranava(the subtle one) if it is Niskala. The Sthula (gross one) is Sakala and it consists of fiveconstituent syllables. The worship of these two is called a penance. Both of them accordsalvation. There are many linga emblems of Paurusa PrakritiThese are of five types: Svayambhu, Bindu, Pratisthita, Cara and Guru Linga.When he is gladdened by the austerities of devas and sages, Siva in the form of Nadaassumes the form of a seed under the ground and suddenly piercing the ground above likea germinating sprout manifests Himself outside and makes His presence felt. Since thisemblem is self-raised, it is called Svayambhu.The Bindu and Nada forms, the stationary or mobile ones are conceptual but belong toSiva.If the image is installed with pure mind in pure altar either by the Gods Or the sages forthe realisation of the soul, it is either called Paurusa and it comes under the category ofthe installed linga image of Siva. By a regular worship of this linga image, the devoteewill obtain all Paurusa Aisvaryas (human riches). If great Brahmins or rich kings installlinga prepared by the artisans, it is called Pratisthita and Prakrta. That which is forcefuland permanent is called Paurusa. That which is week and temporary is called Prakrta. Themountain comes under the Paurusa class and the surface of the world under the Prakrtaclass. Trees etc. are Paurusa and creepers etc. are Prakrta.Rasalinga as fore most among mobile lingas belonging to Caralingas is a bestower of allwishes to the Brahmins. The auspicious Banalinga is a bestower of vast kingdoms to theKsatruyas.A gold linga bestows the ownership of vast wealth on the Vaisyas. A Silalinga (a lingamade of rock) bestows great purity on the Sudras. A crystal linga and a Banalinga bestowall sorts of wishes on all. If a devotee does not possess a linga of his own, there is noharm in using another’s linga for the purpose of worship.A ritualistic shall perform all the worship in a Vessel. At the conclusion of Abhiseka(ceremonial bath) the Naivedya consisting of cooked rice of the Sali variety shall beoffered.When the worship is over, the linga shall be kept in a casket and placed separately in thehouse. Persons who worship their own lingas shall, after the worship is over, offer asfood those articles of diet to which they are accustomed. All non-ritualistic shall worshipthe subtle linga. In the place of floral offerings, they shall use sacred ashes for adorationand food. They shall keep the linga after worship on their head forever.The ash is of three types, derived from ordinary fire, Vedic fire and Siva fire. The ashderived from ordinary fire shall be used for the purification of articles of mud, wood ormetals and even for grains. The ashes resulting from Vedic rites in fire shall be smearedover the forehead at the end of the rites.Bilva twigs shall be burnt repeating the Atma mantra of Aghora. This fire is calledSivagni. The ashes resulting there from are called Sivagnija. The dung of cow, preferably"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"12Shiva Mahimnaof Kapila cow, shall be burnt first and then the twigs of Sami, Asvattha, Palasa, Vata,Aragvadha or Bilva shall be burnt. The ash resulting there from is also Sivagnija.The word Bhasma (Ash) means that which is honoured and adored. Siva formerly did so.The gastric fire burns different kinds of foodstuffs and with their essence nourishes thebody. Similarly the great lord Siva, the creator of the universe presided over by Him andtakes the essence out of the same. After burning the universe He applies the ashes overhis body. Under the pretext of annihilation He has taken the essence of the same. Heassigned the essence of His own body. The essence Akasa (the Ether) constitutes Hishair. The essence of the wind principle constitutes His faceThe essence of the Fire principle constitutes His heart that of the principles of waters thehip and that of the principle of the Earth the knees. Thus the other limbs too. TheTripundraka (the three parallel lines of ash marks over the forehead) is the essence ofTrinity: Brahma, Visnu and Rudra. Similarly Mahesvara has retained the essence ofeverything in the form of Tilaka (the small circular mark) on the foreheadThe word Siva signifies him who controls everything and whom none can control, (SivaVasi) just as Simha signifies the creature that attacks other animals and whom otheranimals cannot attack. The word Siva is another interpretation. The syllable S meansPermanent Bliss. The letter “I” means Purusa (the primordial male energy), the syllable“Va” means Sakti (the primordial female energy). A harmonious compound of thesesyllables is Siva.Ashes must first be smeared in the dust form and then in Tripundraka form. At the timeof worship, water is added to the ashes. For mere sanctification, the ashes are usedwithout water. The devotee, whether it is day or night, whether it is man or a woman shalluse water with the ashes and wear Tripundra at the time of adoration.The one who has Tripundra made of ashes with water and performs worship derives theentire benefit of the same, no one else. Wearing the ashes with Siva’s mantra, he comesout of the limitations of the Asramas. He is called Sivasrami for he is solely devoted toSiva.Being the devotee of Siva and devoted to his sacred rites, he need not observe impurityaccruing from death or birth in the family. The characteristic sign of Siva’s devotee isthat he has a circular dot of white ashes or mud put by himself or by his preceptor on thetop of his forehead. The word Guru (Preceptor) signifies a person who wards off badqualities.Hence the intelligent devotee shall know that the physical body of the preceptor is knownas Gurulinga the worship of which is service rendered to the preceptor.The pair of births and deaths originates from the Maya of Siva. After such a dedication,the devotee is not born again. As long as the body exists, the Jiva is dependent onactivities and he is spoken of as being in bondage. But when the three forms of thephysical body are under control, the scholars call it “Salvation”.Siva, the primary cause of the causes, is the Creator of Mayacakra. He wipes off theDvandva birth and death – which originates from His Maya. The Dvandva is conceivedand created by Siva. It shall be dedicated to Him. A person observing worship of Sivashall observe silence and perform one of these – a sacred rite, penance, Japa, maintenanceof the knowledge or meditation. He shall observe truthfulness etc. The devotee of Sivashall always resort to the linga emblem of Siva. One becomes Siva by resorting tostationary linga emblem."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Shiva Mahimna138.Glorification of the worship of Siva’s earthen linga imageThe linga emblem of Siva made of precious gems was considered the best in the Krtaage; of pure gold in the Dvapara; of mercury in the Treta and of earth in the Kali age.Among the eight cosmic bodies of Siva, the earthen body is the best. Since it is notworshipped by anyone else, it yields great benefit.Just as Siva is the oldest and most excellent of all deities, so also his earthly linga imageis the most excellent of all. Just as the celestial river, Ganga is the oldest and the mostexcellent of all the rivers, so also is the earthen linga image of Siva, the most excellent ofall. Just as the Pranava is considered as the greatest of all mantras, so also the earthenlinga image of Siva that is worthy to be worshipped, is the most excellent of all.Just as Kasi is considered the most excellent of all the holy cities, so also the earthenlinga image of Siva is spoken of as the most excellent of all other linga images. Just asthe rite of Sivaratri is the greatest of all sacred rites, so also the earthly linga image ofSiva is the most excellent of all other linga images. Just as Siva’s energy is considered asgreatest of all goddesses so also the earthen linga emblem of Siva is spoken of as themost excellent of all.The propitiation of the earthen linga image is sanctifying, bestower of bliss, Longevity,satiety, nourishment and fortune and it must be observed by all good aspirants. He whoworships the earthen linga image in the three junctures of the three-fold division of theday every day gains the bliss for twenty-one future births.He who worships the earthen linga emblem of Siva every day stays in Sivaloka for somany years of Siva, as he had been visiting Siva’s temple in his life. If he had any wish,he would be reborn in the land of Bharata as a sovereign monarch. If a man without anydesire worship every day the earthen linga image, would stay in Siva’s region forever.All mobile linga emblems shall be single whole, Stationary linga images shall be made oftwo pieces. This is the rule about broken and unbroken linga images both immobile andmobile.The pedestal is the great Maya; the linga image is lord Siva. Hence in immobile image,two-piece construction is recommended; those who know the principles of Saiva Cult thata stationary linga image shall be made of two pieces have mentioned this. Those whomake a stationary linga image as a single whole and a mobile one pieced are fools. Theynever reap the benefit of worship.9.The number of linga images of Siva used in worship for fulfillment of desiresIn the four Vedas, nothing else is mentioned so holy as the worship of the linga image.This is the conclusion arrived at in all sacred lores. All other rites can entirely beabandoned. A really learned man shall worship only the linga image with great devotion.If the linga image is worshipped, it means that the entire universe consisting of themobile and immobile has been worshipped. There is no other means to save personssubmerged in the ocean of worldly existence.Men of the world are blind due to ignorance. Their minds are sullied by worldly desires.Except for the worship of the linga image, there is no other raft to save them fromdestruction. Hari, Brahma and other devas, sages, Yaksas, Raksasas, Gandharvas,Caranas, Siddhas, Daityas, Danavas, Sesa and other serpents, Garuda, and other birds, allthe Manus, Prajapati, Kinnaras, men etc. have worshipped the wealth-yielding lingaimage with great devotion and have achieved their desires surging in their heart of hearts."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"14Shiva MahimnaBrahmins, Ksatriyas, Vaisyas, Sudras, persons born of inter-caste marriages and othersshall worship the linga icon with great devotion with their respective mantras. The truedevotee after performing worship in the prescribed manner shall worship the eight cosmicbodies (of Siva) consisting of three worlds. The Earth, the waters, the fire, the wind, theEther, the sun, the moon and the sacrificer – these are the eight cosmic bodies. Sarva,Bhava, Rudra, Ugra, Bhima, Isvara, Mahadeva and Pasupati are the manifestations ofSiva who shall be worshipped with these cosmic bodies respectively.Siva’s worship shall always be performed facing the north, not the east. Siva shall not beworshipped without Tripundara, Rudraksa and Bilvapatra.10. Partaking of the Naivedya of Siva by others and the greatness of BilvapatraA devotee of Siva who is pure and clean, devoutly performing good rites and of fixedresolve shall partake of Siva’s Naivedya. He shall abandon all thoughts, which are notworthy of being entertained. Even at the sight of the Naivedya of Siva, all sins disappear.When it is taken in, crores of merits flock in, no moment, a thousand sacrifices are of noavail, hundred million of sacrifices are useless. When Siva Naivedya becomes popularwith the members, that house becomes sacred and it can make others also sacred. WhenSiva’s Naivedya is offered it shall be accepted with pleasure and humility. It shall beeaten eagerly while remembering Siva. After initiation in Saiva cult, the devotee shallpartake of the offerings of eatables made to the linga image whether conceived in theheart or made of moon-slab, silver, gold etc. The Naivedya of all linga icons is called agreat favour and is auspicious.A devotee after initiation into Saiva cult shall eat it. With regard to the following lingaimages viz: that which is obtains from Salagrama stone, Rasalinga, lingas made of rock,silver, gold, crystals and gems, lingas installed by devas and siddhas, Kasmira lingas andJyotirlingas, the partaking of the Naivedya of Siva is on a par with the rite of Candrayana.Even the slayer of a Brahmin if he partakes of the remains of the food offered to the Godquells all the sins immediately.After performing the ceremonial ablution duly if any one drinks the water three times, allthe three types of sins committed by him are quickly destroyed. If at all anything fromSiva naivedya is not to be taken it is that article which is actually put on the linga. Thatwhat is not in contact with the linga is pure and as such, it can be partaken of. When it isin contact with Salagrama Sila, it is pure and can be taken whether it is food –offering,leaf, flower, fruit or water.11.The greatness of BilvaOne who worships Mahadeva in the form Linga at the root of Bilva becomes a purifiedsoul, shall certainly attain Siva.One who pours water over his head at the root of the Bilva can be considered to havetaken his bath in all sacred waters in the earth verily he is holy. Seeing the water basinround the foot of the Bilva tree full of water, Siva becomes greatly pleased. The man whoworships the root of a Bilva tree offering scents and flowers attains the region of Siva.His happiness increases, his family flourishes.He who places a row of lighted lamps at the root of Bilva tree with reverence becomesendowed with the knowledge of truth and merges into Siva. He who worships the Bilvatree abounding in fresh tender sprouts becomes free from sins. If a man piously feeds adevotee of Siva at the end of the root of Bilva tree, he reaps the fruits thereof, ten milliontimes more than in the usual course."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Shiva Mahimna15One who makes a gift of rice cooked in milk and ghee to a devotee of Siva, at the root ofa Bilva tree, will never become poor.12.The glorification of the Rudraksa and of the names of SivaThose who adore Siva are blessed and content. Their birth is fruitful and their family iselevated. Sins never touch those from whose mouth the names Sadasiva, Siva etc. comeout for ever, as they do not touch the burning charcoal of the khadira wood.When a mouth utters “Obeisance to Thee, holy Siva” that mouth (face) is on par withholy centres destroying all sins.Siva’s name, the ashes and the Rudraksa beads – the three are very holy and are on parwith Triveni, the confluence of the three holy rivers.The sight of the persons who have these three in their bodies is a rare occurrence. Butwhen obtained it removes all sins. There is no difference at all between these two – asight of the holy man and a bath in the Triveni. One who does not realise this isundoubtedly a sinner. The man who has no ashes on his forehead, has not worn Rudraksaon his body and does not utter names of Siva shall be shunned as one does a baseman.Brahma wishing to bestow beneficence weighed one against the other. He put on onesside the benefit achieved by a person in whose body the three things were present. On theother side he put the blessedness achieved by those who took their bath in the holyTriveni. Both were found equal. Form that time onwards, Brahma, Visnu and other Devaswear these three. Their very sight dispels sins.Mountainous heaps of great sins are destroyed as in blazing forest fire when the names ofSiva are repeated. They are reduces to ashes without any difficulty. Those who aredrenched by the nectarine downpour of Siva’s names never feel ill at ease even in themiddle of the conflagration of worldly existence. The noble souls, who have acquiredgreat devotion to the names of Siva, and those like them, attain perfect liberationinstantaneously.Only he who has performed penances in the course of many births can acquire devotionto the names of Siva that destroys all sins. Salvation is easy of access only to him whohas extraordinary and unbroken devotion for the names of Siva.Even if a person has committed many sins, a person who has reverence for the Japa ofSiva names, becomes certainly free from all sins. Just as the trees in forest are burnt andreduced to ashes by the forest fire, so also are the sins destroyed by Siva’s names.After going through all the Vedas it has been decided by our ancestors that the noblestmeans of crossing the ocean of worldly existence is the performance of the Japa of Siva’snames. The power of the names of Siva in destroying sins is more than the ability of mento commit them.13.The greatness of holy ashesOne is known as Mahabhasma, the great ashes and the second are known as Svalpa, thelittle. The Mahabhasma is of various types: Srauta (Vedic), Smarta (resulting from smritirites) and Laukika (prepared from ordinary fire). The Svalpa is the ordinary ash, which isof various forms. The Srauta and the Smarta ashes are to be used only by the twice born.Every one can use the Laukika.When dry cow dung is reduced to ashes, it is called Agneya (fiery). Men seeking intellectshall use the ashes resulting from Agnihotra and other sacrificial rites for the Tripundra.When the ashes are put on the forehead or smeared with water, the seven mantras “Agni”etc, mentioned in the Jabalopanisad, shall be recited."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"16Shiva MahimnaSiva, Visnu, Uma, Lakshmi, goddess of speech and other gods and goddesses, Brahmins,ksatriyas, vaisyas and persons of mixed castes and hill tribes have observed Tripundraand dusting always.Even after hundreds of crores of kalpas, Siva knowledge will not dawn upon, those whodo not observe with faith Tripundra and Uddhulana. One who makes the Tripundra on theforehead with white ashes shall attain, on death, the primordial worlds.All the holy centres and sacred rivers go ever to the place, which a person who isendowed with Siva Jnana (knowledge of Siva) and has put on ashes casually visits.Neither Brahma, nor Visnu, nor Rudra, nor sages, nor the other devas can explainadequately the greatness of the application of the ashes. Those men who exclude a manwearing Tripundra and perform holy rites are not liberated from worldly bondage evenafter crores of births.A person who has applied ashes on his body actually wears, as many lingas as there areparticles of the ash that remain on his body. Just as the fire when touched with or withoutknowledge burns the body so does the ash worn consciously or unconsciously sanctifythe man.Those who censure Tripundra actually censure Siva. Thos who wear it with devotionactually wear Siva. Fie upon the forehead that is devoid of ash. Fie upon the village thathas no Siva temple. Fie upon that life that does not worship Siva. Fie upon the lore thatdoes not refer to Siva.He who makes Tripundra duly with the ash is freed from groups of great as well as smallsins.He who wears the Tripundra on his forehead gains the same merit as one who takes hisbath in the sacred rivers like Ganga and whatever other sacred ponds, lakes and holycentres there are in the world.The five syllabled mantra which grants Siva Kaivalya is on a par with seven crores ofgreat and many crores of other mantras.Mantras of other deities bestowing all blessedness are easily accessible to the devoteewho wears the Tripundra. One who wears Tripundra raises a thousand predecessors and athousand successors in his family.In this life he will enjoy all worldly pleasures and live long without any disease. At theend of he span of his life, he will have a peaceful death.He will assume then a divine auspicious body endowed with eight accomplishments. Hewill travel by a divine aerial chariot attended by celestial gods. He will enjoy thepleasures of Vidyadharas, powerful Gandharvas, in the worlds of Indra and otherguardians of the quarters and those of Prajapatis and finally reach Brahma’s region wherehe will sport with a hundred virgins. He will enjoy different kinds of pleasures there forthe full period of the span of life of Brahma. He will then enjoy the pleasures in theVisnuloka till hundred Brahma’s die. Thereafter he will attain Sivaloka and enjoyeverlasting bliss there. Finally he will attain Sivasayujya. No suspicion need beentertained in this matter. After going through the essence of all Upanishads again andagain, Tripundara is conducive to great excellence. A man who wears the Tripundarawhile performing Sraddha, Yajna, Japa, Homa, Vaisvadeva and the worship of the deitiesis a purified soul and he conquers even death.Bath with the ash is a holy centre where Ganga Snana is possible every day. Siva isrepresented by the ash, which directly sanctifies the three worlds. In fructuous is the"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Shiva Mahimna17knowledge, meditation, gift and japa if these are performed by a Brahmana withoutwearing Tripundraka. In the different parts of the body as the forehead etc. three linesconstitute the Tripundara.The Tripundara on the forehead extends from the middle of the eyebrows to the tips ofthe brows on either side. With the middle and the ring fingers a line drawn in the oppositedirection is called Tripundara. With the three middle fingers, ashes are applied in theTripundara on the forehead. It would give worldly pleasures and salvation. For each ofthe three lines, there are nine deities everywhere in the body.The nine deities of the first line are: The syllable “A”, Garhapatya fire (sacrificial fire),Earth, Dharma, the attribute Rajas, Rgveda, Kriyasakti (the power to do), Pratahsavana(morning rituals) and Mahadeva.The nine deities of the second line are: The syllable “U”, Daksina fire (sacrificial fire),the principle of Ether, Attribute Sattva, Yajurveda, Madhyandina Savana (middayrituals), Icchasakti (the will power), the Antaratman (the immanent soul) and Mahesvara.The nine deities of the third line are: The syllable “M”, Ahavaniya (sacrificial) fire, thesupreme soul, the attribute Tamas, heaven, Jnana Sakti, Samaveda, the third Savana(evening rituals) and Siva.Thus making obeisance to the deities of the different parts with devotion, one shall applythe Tripundara. One becomes pure and derives worldly pleasures and salvation.14. The greatness of RudraksaRudraksa is a favourite bead of Siva. It is highly sanctifying. It removes all the sins bysight, contact and Japas. Formerly Siva, the supreme soul, for rendering help to theworlds, declared the greatness of Rudraksa to the Goddess.Once Siva had been performing penance for thousands of divine years. Although it wascontrolled rigorously, his mind was in flutter. Out of sport, he happened to open his eyesfrom a desire of helping the worlds. Drops of tears fell from his beautiful half closedeyes. From those teardrops, there cropped up the Rudraksa plants. They becameimmobile.In order to bless the devotees, they were given to the four Varanas devoted to the worshipof Visnu. They were classified into Brahmins, Ksatriyas, Vaisyas and Sudras. TheseRudraksas are of auspicious nature. The colours of the four types of Rudraksas arerespectively white, red, yellow and black. All people shall wear the Rudraksa of theirown Varna. If they desire their benefit, namely worldly pleasures and salvation and if thedevotees of Siva wish to gratify Siva, they must wear the Rudraksa.A Rudraksa is the size of an Emblic myrbalan (Dhatriphala) is mentioned as the mostexcellent; one of the sizes of the fruit of the jujube tree (Badariphala) is spoken of as themiddling.The meanest of Rudraksa is of the size of a gram according to his excellent classification.The wearing of Rudraksa is recommended for the sake of destroying sins. Hence thatwhich is conducive to the achievement of every object has to be worn certainly. Rudraksaof even size, glossy, firm, thick and having thorn like protrusions yield desires andbestow worldly pleasures and salvation forever.Six types of Rudraksas shall be discarded: -that, which is defiled by worms, is cut andbroken, has no thorn like protrusions, has cracks and is not circular. That which has anatural hole from end to end is the most excellent, that which is bored through by humaneffort is the middling one."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"18Shiva MahimnaThe wearing of Rudraksa is spoken of as conducive to the destruction of great sins. Ifeleven hundred Rudraksas are worn on the person, the man assumes the form of Rudra.Even in hundreds of years, it is impossible to describe adequately the benefit derived bywearing eleven hundred and fifty Rudraksas. A devout man shall make a coronetconsisting of five hundred and fifty Rudraksas.Hundred and one Rudraksas should be worn round the neck; eleven Rudraksas should beworn round each of the arms, elbows and wrists. Devotees of Siva should have threeRudraksas in the sacred thread and round the hips five Rudraksas should be tied. Theperson who wears so many Rudraksas is worthy of being bowed to and adored by all likeMahesa. Such a person, while in contemplation should be duly seated and addressed.Seeing him everyone is freed from sins. A devotee of Siva should refrain from eatingmeat, garlic, onion, red garlic, potherb, Slesmataka, pig of rubbish and liquors.Rudraksa is an auspicious complement to His linga image. The small one is alwayspraiseworthy. If anyone wears it during the day, he is freed from sins committed duringthe night; if it is worn during the night, one is freed from sins committed during the day.Similar is the result with its wearing during morning, midday or evening. Those whowear Tripundra, the matted hair and the Rudraksa do not go to Yama’s abode.Yama’s directives to his attendants:All shall honour those who wear atleast one Rudraksa on their heads, Tripundra on theforehead and repeat the five syllabled mantras. They are indeed saintly men.One can bring the man who has no Rudraksa on his person, and no Tripundra on hisforehead and who does not utter the five-syllabled mantra. All those who have the ashand Rudraksa are honoured always after knowing their power.Rudraksa as well as the person who wears it, is Yama’s favourite. Even if has committedsins, he becomes pure. One who wears the Rudraksa round the hands and arms and overthe head cannot be killed by any living being. He can roam in the world in the form of aRudra; and is respected by the gods and Asuras always. He is honoured like Siva. Heremoves the sins of anyone seen by him. If a person is not liberated after meditation andacquisition of knowledge, he should wear Rudraksa. He is freed from all sins and attainsthe highest goal.A mantra repeated with Rudraksa is a crore times more efficacious. A man wearingRudraksa derives a hundred million times more merit.As long as Rudraksa is on the person of a living soul, he is least affected by prematuredeath. One shall attain Rudra on seeing a person with Tripundra, his limbs covered withRudraksa and repeating the Mrtyunjaya mantra. He is the favourite of the five deities anda favourite of all gods. A devotee has to repeat all mantras while wearing a garland ofRudraksa (or counting on the beads). Even the devotees of Visnu and other deitiesunhesitatingly wear the Rudraksa. Especially the devotee of Rudra wears Rudraksasalways.15.Maha Sivaratri\"Maha-Sivaratri\" is a Hindu festival observed on the night of the fourteenth day of thedark half in the month of 'Magha', in Tamil 'Masi', corresponding to the English months'February-March', in honour of Siva, one of the Hindu Trinity, representing thedestructive aspect in the universe. Though generally, the night time is considered sacredand suitable for the worship of the feminine aspect of' the deity and the day time for thatof' the masculine, yet on this particular occasion Siva is worshipped during the night"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Shiva Mahimna19time, and as a matter of fact, it is specially enjoined to be observed then. The observanceof the Vratha is believed to secure for the devotee immunity from the eftects of sincommitted either wittingly or unwittingly. The night is divided into four quarters, eachquarter going by the name of a Jama called also Yama and pious people keep awakeduring every one of it, worshipping Iswara.It is said that the whole world was under destruction once and the Goddess Parvatiworshipped her husband Siva then and prayed to him that the Jivas (living souls)remaining in space like particles of gold dust in a lump of wax during that long period ofpralaya (deluge) night, should, when they became active once again and are in theenjoyment of their short day and night, have his blessings if they but worshipped him justas she did then, and her prayer was accordingly granted. The night fixed for the worshipof Iswara by mortals by Parvati was named Maha-Sivaratri or the great night of Siva,since pralaya is brought about by him and hence the period is really his night from thegreat night or pralaya which was the cause for the origin of this Sivaratri.The people who observe this Sivaratri- Vratha take only single meal during the dayprevious to the Vratha day and sleep in clean place during the night. In the morning of theVratha day they take a bath in the waters of a sacred river, and then go to witness thedivine worship in a Siva temple, and at night offer worship to Siva during every one ofthe four Yamams. Night long vigil on Sivaratri day, watching the sacred ablutions of SivaLinga at the temple, is the core of the Sivaratri festival.The Rudra Japa Abhisheka of SivaLinga resounds the multifacted glory of Lord Siva,who is also called Asutosh or One whois easily pleased by copius ablutions with water, the cheapest available commodity. Weshould remember that water in essence is Prana Sakti or life force. Such an observance ofSivaratri will really bestow on the devotee the greatest grace of Lord Siva, the auspiciousknowledge of Atma Jnana. Besides the devotee is also blessed with material prosperitythe items of which are beautifully listed in the Chamaka Mantra uttered on this occasion.There is also a myth emphasizing the importance of the worship of Siva during theSivaratri night and it is in brief as follows:Once there was a hunter, and he one day went into the forest to procure meat for hisfamily by hunting some animal. He wandered up and down in the forest from morning tillnight in search of game but was unable to shoot any. At last, when night overtook him, heclimbed up a Bael tree to escape from a wild animal that was pursuing him, being rousedfrom its lair by the hunter. The animal was lying down at the foot of the tree quite certainthat the man would fall down either from sleep or from exhaustion, and that he might eathim. The hunter, exhausted as he was from his exertions and hunger, wished to scareaway the animal by throwing handful of bael leaves. These leaves dripping with water onaccount of the recent shower, fell on a Siva-Lingam that was near. The night happened tobe the Maha-Sivaratri night. He had fasted during the whole day since he could not findanything to eat. The drenching rain constituted a bath and his action of throwing the baelleaves on the Siva-Lingam, the worship of Siva on the Sivaratri night. Though his actionswere not intentional to worship Siva, yet he is said to have gained heaven as he hadobserved the Sivaratri - Vratha unwittingly.The basic principle underlying the observance of the Maha-Sivaratri Vratha appears to beto emphasize the fact that death is sure to follow birth, night is sure to follow day,Pralaya, active cosmic life and so on, and consequently people should always bear inmind while enjoying the one its opposite and regulate their life accordingly. They should"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"20Shiva Mahimnanot be elated at success nor should they allow themselves to be carried away by despair atfailures but always have trust in God and worship him.II.RUDRA SAMHITA1.Creation2.Kamadeva to disturb the penance of Narada3.Illusion of Narada4.Narada Curses Visnu5.

There is a beautiful cave in the Himalayan Mountain near which thecelestial river flows rapidly. There was a great hermitage of divine splendour, which wasresplendent in many ways. Narada endowed with divine vision went there to perform thepenance. The sage performed meditation and contemplation wherein the realisation wasgenerated. When Narada performed the penance, the mind of Indra became excessivelyagitated and got trembled, since he wanted to spoil the penance. The King of devas,endowed with crooked intelligence to achieve his interests, saw Kama.Narada was performing a penance in the Himalayan Mountain directing his mind towardsthe Lord of the universe with great mental control and firm resolve. Indra was scared thatNarada may beg Brahma for his kingdom and so he decided to go there and causehindrances to the penance. Being thus commanded by Indra, Kamadeva, accompanied byhis wife Rati and Madhu, his friend, went haughtily to that place and prepared their ownmeans of attack.Indra applied all his arts there immediately. Spring too haughtily spread his prowess ofdiverse nature. Narada’s mind still did not waver. Only their arrogance suffered a setbackand that too by the favour of Mahesa.By the controlling power of the lord, Kama could not exercise any influence. It was atthat very place, that Siva, the indefatigable enemy of Kama, had formerly performed agreat penance. It was there that Kama was reduced to ashes – Kama who used to spoil the"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Shiva Mahimna21penances of sages. Siva said that whatever place all around that spot was visible topersons there, will be out of the influence of Kama forever. It was due to this statement ofSiva that Kama’s viles did not prevail upon Narada. From Siva’s abode he went to Indra.Kama then narrated everything about the sage and commended his power. At Indra’sbidding, Kama returned to his own place. Deluded by Siva’s Maya (power of illusion)Indra was unaware of the true facts and was greatly surprised and admired Narada.Siva’s Maya is incomprehensible to all. The whole universe is deluded by it. Only thetrue devotees of dedicated souls escape. Backed by Siva’s blessings, Narada stayed in thehermitage for a long time. Then realising that his penance was complete, the sage Naradaconcluded the same. Thinking that he had conquered Kama, he was puffed with pride. Hewas devoid of true knowledge and deluded by Siva’s Maya.Blessed and very blessed is Siva’s Maya. Even Visnu, Brahma and others did not knowthe turn it would take. In the state of delusion and puffed up arrogance, the great sageNarada went to Kailasa to expatiate on his own achievement. Bowing down to Rudra, thesage arrogantly spoke of his exploits with the conviction that he was equal to the noble –souled lord, the conqueror of Kama, i.e. Siva.Siva, who is favourable, disposed to his devotees, advised Narada who was ignorant ofthe real case, whose mind had strayed and whom His Maya had deluded.Rudra told Narada that he was blessed and told him to not to speak like that anywhereelse, especially in the presence of Visnu. He further told him that even if he was asked, heshould not mention his achievements. These should be guarded as close secrets andshould never be expressed. Rudra told this Narada since he was a great devotee of Visnuas well as his follower.Lord Rudra, the cause of creation advised him in many ways. But Narada who was underthe influence of Siva’s Maya did not take up the wholesome advice. Then the great sagewent to Brahma’s world. After saluting Brahma, he told him about his conquest of Kamaas a result of his penance.On hearing that Brahma remembered the lotus like feet of Siva and knew thereby the truecause, he then forbade his son.Although, foremost among the wise, Narada did not take up the advise of Brahma as hehad been deluded by Siva’s Maya. The sprout of arrogance had been so fixed in his mind.Everything takes place in the world in the manner Siva wills. It is true that the entireuniverse is dependent on His wills. Narada hastened to Visnuloka in the same state ofsenseless arrogance, to boast of his exploits in the presence of Visnu. When Visnu sawNarada approaching, he could guess the purpose of his visit. He stood up and receivedhim cordially and walked forward and embraced him lovingly. He made Narada sitcomfortably. After remembering the lotus-like feet of Siva.Visnu told Narada that he was foremost among all the sages and was blessed. Visnu wassanctified by his visit and asked him the reasons of his visit. On this, Narada narrated thestory in the same haughty manner. On hearing the arrogant words of the sage Narada,Visnu remembered the lotus like feet of Siva again and understood the true cause. Visnu,a leading devotee of Siva, with his soul dedicated to Siva, bowed his head and eulogisedParamesvara, the lord of the holy mountain, with his palms joined in reverence.Visnu requested the Lord Mahadeva to be pleased and enchant everyone. Having thuschanted the prayer to Siva, the supreme Atman, he closed his eyes and meditated on Hislotus-like feet and stopped."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"22Shiva MahimnaVisnu tried to explain Narada about his success in penance; Narada replied what couldKama do to me if you remain favourable to me. After having made this statement Naradawho had paid a casual visit bowed to Visnu and left.3.Illusion of NaradaWhen Narada left who had come casually, Visnu skilful in wielding his Maya, spread hisMaya on Siva’s will. On the path of Narada a big city was created, which wassurprisingly more beautiful than the Heaven. The king named Silanidhi was preparing forthe gorgeous celebration of the voluntary wooing, Svayamvara, of his daughter.On seeing such a splendid city Narada was enchanted and he eagerly went to the palacethreshold with his kindled love. King offered Narada a seat on the splendid thronestudded with precious gems and asked her daughter Srimati to kneel down at the feet ofsage.4.Narada Curses VisnuAfter cursing the two attendants of Siva suitably, the sage still under the earlier delusionlooked into the water and saw that his face was quite normal. It was also due to Siva’swill. Thereupon recollecting that it might have been a deception of Hari, he becameunbearably infuriated and went to Visnuloka. There he angrily poured abusive wordsblazing like kindled fire since his wisdom had vanished due to Siva’s will.Narada accused Visnu, of being extremely wicked and a deceptive enchanter of theworld. He also said that he was unable to brook others enthusiastic success and that hedabbles in illusory tactics and his intentions were always dirty. He also said that formerlyhe assumed the form of an enchantress and showed his deceptive power and he made thedemons drink liquor and not the nectar.Narada said to Visnu-If out of pity Siva had not drunk poison, all your illusory tacticswould have been quelled since you take pleasure only in deception.O Visnu, a deceptive path is extremely attractive to you. You had never been of saintlynature, but the lord made you free from control.What is done by Siva the supreme Atman does not seem proper. Thinking of yourinfluence and strength when you act independently and seeing the way you go He hasnow repented. He has announced that a Brahmin is superior to all, thereby making theVedas pronounced by Him authoritative.O Visnu, knowing that, I shall now teach you through that power so that hereafter youwill never do such things.You are fearless because till now you have not come into clash with an equally powerfulperson. Now you will derive the fruit of your own deeds.After saying this, the sage still under the influence of Maya furiously cursed Visnu,thereby exhibiting the superiority of his brahminical power.O Visnu, the enchanter that you are, you made me distressed for the sake of woman. OHari, you shall experience misery in that human form which you imitated whileproceeding with your deceptive tactics. Your allies will be those whose face you assignedto me.O inflictor of miseries upon others, you shall get the misery of separation from a woman.You shall have the travails of a human being deluded by ignorance.”Thus Narada, deluded himself by ignorance, cursed Hari. Visnu quietly accepted thecause praising the Maya of Sambhu."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Shiva Mahimna23Thereafter Siva, of great divine sport withdrew his enchanting Maya whereby Naradabecame wise and free from delusion.When the Maya vanished he became as intelligent as before, regaining perfect knowledgeand becoming free from distress. He was surprised. He cursed himself after repentingagain and again. He praised the Maya of Siva, which could enchant even wise people.On realizing his mistakes due to illusion, Narada, the most excellent of the devotees ofVisnu, fell at his feet.Consoled by Hari and freed from wicked ideas he apologized to Visnu that being deludedand evil-minded he had spoken many wicked words to him and he pleaded to make themineffective. He realized that he had committed a great sin and for that he would certainlybe falling into a hell.He asked Hari to direct him what to do whereby he would destroy his sins and prevent hisdownfall into hell.Saying thus, the excellent sage once again fell at Visnu’s feet and withthe mind purified repented sincerely.Thereupon Visnu lifted him up and spoke affablyand courteously.Visnu said-Do not be sorry too much. Undoubtedly you are my truedevotee. Dear sage, now listen. I shall tell you what is certainly beneficial to you. Youwill not fall into hell. Siva will make you happy.Deluded by your haughtiness youdisobeyed the instructions of Siva. The true bestower of fruits according to the actions.He has given you this result.Be sure in your mind that everything has happened in accordance with Siva’s wish. Thatlord Siva, the supreme lord, removes haughtiness.He is the supreme Brahman; thesupreme Atman, Existence, Knowledge and Bliss. He is free from the three Gunas,changes and deviations. He is beyond Rajas, Sattva and Tamas.He is both Saguna andNirguna. He Himself availing of his own Maya manifests into three forms- Brahma,Visnu and Mahesa.In his attributeless pure form He is glorified as Siva, the supreme Atman, Mahesara, thesupreme Brahman, the undecaying, the endless, and Mahadeva.Serving him, Brahmabecomes the creator and I the sustainer of the worlds. He himself in the manifestation asRudra is the annihilator always. Different from Maya, the pure Being in the form of Sivais the Saksin and moving about according to his will and indulging in divine sport Heblesses his devotees.O sage Narada please listens to a good remedy that bestowshappiness removes all sins and yields worldly pleasures and salvation.Cast off all your doubts. Sing the songs of noble glory of Siva. With your mind notturning to anything else, always repeat the hundred names of Siva and his hymns. By thisJapa all of your sins will perish instantaneously. After saying this to Narada, Visnucontinued mercifully.“O\" sage, do not be grief-stricken. Nothing has been perpetrated byyou. It was Siva who did everything. There is no doubt in this. It was lord Mahesvarawho deluded your splendid intellect and made you suffer on account of love. It was hewho made you His mouthpiece and cursed me.In this manner the great Conqueror of Death, Kala of Kala, always devoted to the upliftof his devotees, made His own conduct of life manifest in the world. There is no otherlord and master so loving and pleasure inspiring unto me as Siva. The same Paramesvarabestows all power on me. O sage, perform His adoration. Worship him always. Hear andsing his glory. Perpetually pay him homage.He who approaches Siva by means of his body, mind and speech is a great scholar. He iscalled a living liberated soul. The name Siva blazing like the forest conflagration reduces"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"24Shiva Mahimnamountainous heaps of great sins to ashes without any difficulty. The different kinds ofmiseries arising from sins shall be destroyed only through the worship of Siva, and notthrough other means. He who always seeks refuge in Siva, O sage, is the real follower ofthe Vedas, a meritorious soul and a blessed scholar. He must resort to Him by means ofhis body, speech and mind forever.The different sacred rites of those who have full faith in the worship of Siva, thedestroyer of Tripura become fruitful instantaneously. O great sage, there are not so manysins in the world as the worship of Siva is capable of destroying. The sins relating topersons who cross the ocean of worldly existence in the raft of Siva’s names, perishundoubtedly. The sins that are at the root of worldly existence are destroyed certainly bythe axe of Siva’s name.Persons scorched and distressed by the conflagration of sins must drink the nectar ofSiva’s names. Without that there is no peace and tranquility to those who are scorchedand distressed by the sins’ wild fire. Those who are drenched by the downpour of thenectarine names of Siva are not distressed in the midst of the conflagration of worldlyexistence. There is no doubt in this. Immediate salvation can be achieved only by thepeople who have performed penance in various lives. They alone will have devotion forSiva the cherished consort of Parvati. Men who frequently indulge in passions of loveand hatred will never have devotion for Siva.The devotion for Siva that extends to other deities is futile. It is necessary to beexclusively devoted to Siva. It is my conviction that salvation is easy of access only tothe person who has exclusive and unflinching devotion for Siva and not for any other.Even if he commits endless sins, he will be freed from them all, if he has true devotionfor Siva. There is no doubt about it. Just as trees in the forest are reduced to ashes in thewild fire so also the sins of the devotees of Siva are burnt away in the fire of Siva’s name.He who is ever devoted to the worship of Siva with his body purified by the ash,definitely crosses the terrible and endless expanse of the ocean of worldly existence. Aman serving the three-eyed Siva is never sullied by sins even if he misappropriates abrahmin’s wealth or kills many Brahmins. After going through all the Vedas this hasbeen definitely concluded by ancestors that the sole means of destroying worldlyexistence is the worship of Siva.From now onwards you shall always worship lord Siva who is Samba and Sadasiva, withcare, effort and due observance of the rules of procedure. Dusting profusely and carefullyyour body from head to foot with the particles of ashes, you shall perform the Japa of thesix-syllabled mantra,Om Namaha Shivaya, of Siva, well known in all the Vedas. Youshall wear on the different parts of your body Rudraksa beads pleasing to Siva, repeatingthe respective mantras with devotion and observing the rules of procedure.Listen to Siva’s anecdotes forever. Narrate the stories of Siva always. Strenuouslyworship the devotees of Siva again and again. Without blundering ever seek refuge inSiva, because a perpetual worship of Siva bestows bliss.Bearing the lotus like feet of Siva within your pure heart, carry on at first the pilgrimageto various holy centers of Siva, O excellent sage. Observing the unrivalled greatness ofSiva, the supreme Atman, O sage, you must next go to Anandavana, which is a greatfavorite of Siva. Seeing Siva, the lord of the universe there, worship him with devotion.After bowing to him and eulogizing Him you will become free from all doubts."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Shiva Mahimna25Thereafter you must go to Brahmaloka, to achieve your wishes. That is my command toyou out of love. After bowing to and specifically eulogizing your father Brahma, youshall ask him many points regarding Siva’s greatness with an endearing mind.

From now onwards become a devotee ofSiva, solely devoted to Siva. You will be liberated. Siva will grant you his specialblessings. After advising the sage thus, Visnu was pleased. Remembering, saluting andeulogizing Siva he vanished from that place.5. Narada goes to KasiSuta said-O Brahmins, when Visnu vanished, the excellent sage Narada roamed over the Earthseeing Siva lingas with piety.In the course of his wanderings over the Earth, O Brahmins, with his mind full ofdevotional pleasure he saw many forms of Siva that confer worldly pleasures andsalvation on the devotees.On knowing that Narada of divine vision was wandering over the Earth, the twoattendants of Siva approaching him who by that time had become pure in mind.They bowed to him and touched his feet. With a desire to secure release from the cursethey spoke to him respectfully.The attendants of Siva said-O celestial sage, son of Brahma, please hear our words. We who formerly offended youare really not Brahmins.O brahminical sage, we, your former offenders, are the attendants of Siva. Induced bySiva you had cursed us when your mind was deluded by the illusory infatuation for theprincess at the Svayamvara. Realizing that the occasion was inopportune we kept quietthen.We reaped the fruit of our own action. No one is to be blamed for it. O lord, be pleased.Bless us now.Suta said-On hearing the words of the attendants uttered with devotion and respect, the sage repliedlovingly, repenting.Narada said-O attendants of lord Siva, most worthy of the respect of good people, please listen to mywords now free from delusion. They are true and shall make you happy.Formerly my mind had been depraved. Certainly it was Siva’s will. In that state ofdelusion and crookedness of the mind I had unfortunately cursed both of you.What I have said is bound to happen. Still, O Ganas listen. I shall tell you the way ofredemption from the curse. Please forgive my sin now.You will be born as demons from the semen virile of a great sage and due to his poweryou will secure the commanding position of the king of demons endowed with prosperity,strength and valorous exploits. You will rule over whole of the universe as devotees ofSiva with your sense conquered.

Meditating exclusively on Siva he continued his wanderingsover the earth seeing the various holy centers of Siva personally.Reaching Kasi that excelled all other cities in holiness, which is favourite resort of Siva,which easily bestows the favour of Siva and which is identical with Siva the sage becamecontended. He saw Siva, the lord of Kasi and worshipped Him with great pleasure andlove.Narada then went to the region of Brahma with devotion and eulogized him with differentprayers. With his mind being highly purified by remembering Siva. He was eager toknow further the principles of Siva.There he bowed to Brahma with devotion and eulogized him with various prayers. Withhis mind riveted to Siva he asked him the good principles of Siva.6. Principles of SadaSivaBrahma said-Neither the principles of Siva nor His supreme wonderful forms have been understood byme or by Visnu or by any one else.At the time of great Dissolution when all the mobile and immobile objects of the worldare dissolved everything gets enveloped in darkness, without the sun, planets and stars.There is no moon. The day and the night are not demarcated. There is no fire, no wind, noearth and no water. There is no unmanifest primordial being. The whole firmament is onecomplete void, devoid of all Tejas elements.There is no Dharma or Adharma, no sound, no touch. Smell and color are not manifest.There is no taste. The face of the quarters is not demarcated.Thus when there is pitch darkness that cannot be pierced with a needle and what ismentioned in the Vedas as “The existent and the Brahman” is alone present.When the present visible world is not in existence, the Sat Brahman alone is presentwhich Yogins observe perpetually in the inner soul, the inner firmament.It is incomprehensible to the mind. It cannot at all be expressed by words. It has neithername nor color. It is neither thick nor thin.It is neither short nor long. It is neither light nor heavy. There is neither increase nordecrease in it.The Veda says that it envelops whatever is in a surprising way. It is the splendor, thetruth, the knowledge, the eternal and the great Bliss.It is immeasurable, propless, changeless, formless, attributeless, and perceptible to theYogins, all pervasive and the sole cause of the universe.It is free from alternatives. It has no beginning. It is free from illusion and its harassment.It has no second. It has neither beginning nor end. It has no development. It is in the formof pure knowledge.People have doubts about giving it a name. That Being, then after sometime, it is said,wished for a second.The Being, having no form of its own, wished to create, in the course of its own sport, anauspicious form of its own endowed with all power, qualities and knowledge.A form that goes everywhere, that has all forms, that sees all, that is the cause of all, thatshould be respected by all, that is at the beginning of all, that bestows everything, andthat sanctifies everything should be created and hence created that form of Isvara of purenature.

The manifest form of theformless Being is Sadasiva. Scholars of the ancient and succeeding ages have sung of itas Isvara.7.Creation of Visnu and Brahma by SivaIsvara though alone, then created the physical form sakti from his body. This Sakti didnot affect his body in anyway.This Sakti is called by various names. Pradhana, Prakrti, Maya, Gunavati, Para. Themother of Buddhi Tattva, Vikrtivarjita.That Sakti is Ambika, Prakrti and the goddess of all. She is the prime cause and themother of the three deities.She has eight arms. Her face wears a peculiar splendor, the splendor of a thousandmoons. Thousands of stars perpetually sparkle round her face.She is bedecked in various ornaments. She has various weapons. She is capable ofvarious movements. Her eyes beam like a full blown lotus.She has a brilliance, which could hardly be conceived. She is the generating cause of all.She sprang up singly as Maya. In her union she manifested in various forms.The supreme Purusa is Siva. He is called Sambhu. He has no other lord over Him. Heholds the Mandakini (Ganga) on his head, and the crescent moon on his forehead. He hasthree eyes.He has five faces. He is always joyful. He has ten arms. He holds the trident. He is aspure and white as camphor. His body is entirely dusted with the ash.That Brahman of the form of Kala together with Sakti, simultaneously create the holycenter called Sivaloka.The same is called Kasika, the excellent holy center. It is the seat of salvation shiningover and above everything.The holy center is of the nature of extreme Bliss in as much as the primordial lovers,supremely Blissful, made that beautiful holy center their perpetual abode.O sage, that holy center is never, even at the time of great Dissolution, free from Siva andSakti Hence it is called Avimukta.Since the holy center is the cause of Bliss, the Pinaka bearing lord, Siva, called it “theblissful forest” and later “Avimukta”.O celestial sage, the blissful, two deities thus sporting in the forest wished, it is said, foranother being to be created.Siva thought within himself like this-“Another being shall be created by me. Let himcreate everything, protect it and in the end let him dissolve it with my blessing. Havingentrusted everything to him we two, remaining in Kasi shall roam as we please keepingonly the prerogative of conferring salvation.We can stay happily in this blissful forest being free from worries. With the consent ofSiva the supreme lord spread the liquorine essence of nectar on his left side, on the tenthlimb, nectar that was the outcome of churning the ocean of his mind wherein thoughtswere the waves, the Sattva Guna was precious gem, Rajas being coral and Tamas-crocodile. Thereupon a person came into being who was the most charming one in thethree worlds, who was calm with Sattva Guna being prominent, and who appeared to bethe ocean of immeasurable majesty.O sage, he was endowed with patience.

You will have manyother names conferring happiness on devotees.Perform penance highly conducive to the achievement of the matter in hand, Be firm init.” Saying so, the lord bestowed on him the Vedas through his nostrils.Siva vanished accompanied by Sakti and his attendants. After due obeisance to Siva,Visnu began his great penance.Even after performing the penance for twelve thousand divine years, Visnu could notachieve his desire, the vision of Siva that confers everything.He became suspicious and respectfully meditating on Siva pondered “What shall I donow?”In the meantime the auspicious voice of Siva was heard. “Perform penance again forremoving your doubts.On hearing it Visnu performed a terrible penance, for along time, following the path ofmeditation.That Being Visnu became enlightened, following the path of meditation. He wasdelightfully surprised. “O what is that True entity?”From the body of Visnu who thus exerted himself, water currents of various sorts beganto flow as a result of Siva’s Maya.O great sage, the supreme Brahman in the form of divine waters pervaded the entire void.A mere contact with the same is destructive of sins.Visnu, the weary person went to sleep amidst the waters. He was in that blissful state ofdelusion for a long time.As approved in the Vedas, his name came to be established as Narayana. Excepting forthat Primordial Being there was nothing then.In the meantime, the Principles too were evolved out of evolved out of the Great soul. Owise one of great intellect, listen to my enumeration of the same.From Prakrti came into being the Mahat (cosmic intellect) and from Mahat the threeGunas. Ahamkara the cosmic ego arose there from in three forms according to the threeGunas.The Essences, the five elements, the senses of knowledge and action too came into beingthen.O most excellent of sages, I have thus enumerated the principles. All these principlesoriginating from Prakrti are insentient, but not the Purusa. These principles are twentyfour in number. Visnu, the Purusa, accepted all these, as was the will of Siva, and beganhis sleep in the Brahman.8. The description of the body of SabdabrahmanBrahma said:Siva, the protector of the distressed, remover of the haughtiness of the haughty and theundecaying lord of every thing took mercy on us.

O’ foremost among alldeities, whenever any misery befalls you, it shall be destroyed when my Linga isworshipped.O’ strong ones, you two are born of my own Prakriti, out of my left and right sides,Brahma from my right and Visnu from my left side. I am the supreme Atman. I am thelord of every thing.Although Nirguna, I am Saguna too and the author of dissolution, maintenance andcreation. I am the supreme Brahman without decay and change. Existence, Knowledgeand Bliss are my characteristics. Truly, I am Niskala, Nirguna, and forever. For theactivities of creations and maintenance and dissolution I manifest my self in the threeforms of Brahma, Visnu and Hara.A great form similar to this shall become manifest in the world through your body. Hewill be called Rudra. His capacity will never be less, since He will be my own part andparcel. He is I. I am he. In the mode worship too there is no difference. Hence Siva andRudra shall not be considered different.Siva said you two are born of Prakrti but not Rudra. My command is carried to that placethrough Brahma’s eyebrows. I am therefore spoken of as Tamasa and Prakrta, Hara inrespect to the Gunas alone and shall be known as Vaikarika too, which is actually theAhamkara, the Ego. That is called Tamasa only in name and not in reality. For this reasonBrahma shall be the creator and Hari the protector.My would-be part shall be the cause of dissolution. This goddess Uma, Paramesvari is thePrakriti. Her Sakti, the goddess of speech shall resort to Brahma. Another Sakti arisingout of the Prakriti will resort to Visnu in the form of Laksmi. Another Sakti Kali willsurely share my part.Visnu be the bestower of salvation too at my bidding. The benefit accruing from yourvision will be same as that from mine. This boon is given to you now.

He is the protector of the three worlds.Hara who causes dissolution of three worlds has Sattava within but Tamas out side.Brahma who creates the three worlds has Rajas both within and without. This is theposition of the Gunas in three deities. Siva is spoken of as different from the Gunas.You and Brahma shall worship Rudra. The author of dissolution of the three worlds is thecomplete incarnation of Siva.Siva said o Visnu you are to be meditated upon by Rudra and Rudra is to be meditatedupon by you.

One year of Visnu constitute one day of Rudra. When a hundredyear passes, Rudra assumes the form of Nara (supreme man). He stays like that as long asSadasiva retains the breath. When He exhales he merges into Sakti.Visnu said o Sankara, the ocean of mercy, the lord of the universe, be pleased to hear. Ishall do all these things strictly adhering at your behests.I shall always meditate upon you. I would not act otherwise. I have already experiencedyou omni potency. O lord if any one of my devotees were to censure you, you will pleaseassign perpetual residence in hell to him.O lord, who ever be your devotee shall also be my favourite. He who knows and realizesthis shall not find salvation inaccessible to him.The rite of the worship of the Linga is instituted ever since in world. Siva installed in theLinga bestows worldly pleasures and salvation. The great goddess is the pedestal for theLinga. The Linga is Lord Siva Himself. Since the whole universe finally merges into in, itis called Linga.III.MARRIAGE OF SIVA1.Parvati’s Birth2.Birth of Planet Mars3.The Birth of Taraka and Vajranga and their Penance4.Kama’s Destruction5.Penance of Parvati and Marriage with Siva6.

Theywere delighted and happy.Mena said “Great favour has been shown by you, O Goddess, O mother of the universe,in as much as you have manifested yourself in front of me brilliantly.You are the primordial one among all Energies. O Goddess Siva, you are the mother ofthe three worlds. O Goddess you are the beloved of Siva, you are great goddess eulogizedby the gods.O great goddess be pleased. Remain in my meditation in this form, but have the form ofmy daughter in public view.”The Goddess Siva of great brilliance assumed the form of her baby child in front of Menaand began to cry in accordance with the ways of the world.Accompanied by the chief priest and learned Brahmins, the lord of mountains came thereand saw the child who shone in her lovely clothes. The lord of mountains rejoiced onseeing the child shining in dark splendour like that of the blue lotus.All the citizens there, both men and women, rejoiced much. There were great festivities.Different sorts of musical instruments were played. Auspicious songs were sung. Thelord of mountains performed postnatal sacred rites and made charitable gifts to theBrahmins.In an auspicious hour, in the company of the sages, Himavat named his daughter Kali andassigned other pleasing names to her. There in the place of the lord of mountains theGoddess Siva grew up like Ganga in the rainy season and like the moon light in theautumn.The child was fondly attached to every member of the family, hence the kinsmen calledher Parvati, a name befitting her family. The girl had all the qualities of good conduct andbehaviour.The Goddess Siva when the suitable time for her education arrived learnt all the loresfrom a good preceptor, with concentrated mind and great pleasure.Himavat asked sage Narada about the horoscope of his daughter. Narada told Himavatthat his daughter has all the auspicious signs. Like the first digit of the moon she willincrease day by day. She will delight her husband, and heighten the glory of her parents.She will be a great chaste lady. She will grant bliss to everyone always. Her husband will"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Shiva Mahimna33be naked Yogin, without any qualities. He will be free from lust. He will have neithermother nor father. He will be indifferent to honours. His dress and manners will beinauspicious.Convinced that Narada's words could not be false, Goddess Siva turned her mind andlove to Siva's feet.Narada continued that there is only one bridegroom like that. He is lord Siva who hassupportively assumed a physical form. In Him all bad characteristics are equal to goodcharacteristics. Hence you give your daughter in marriage to Siva. That will be a wisestep. Lord Siva who is the sole lord, unchanging and without any aberration is worthy ofbeing resorted to. A love akin to this pair will not be found anywhere. Never in the pastwas it seen nor will it occur in future. Nor it is current now.Siva will become Ardhanarisvara (half male and half female), with your daughterforming half the part of his body. By propitiating Siva with her penance she will acquirethe lustre of gold and will be known as Swarnagauri. Your daughter will be as faircomplexioned as lightening. This girl will be famous in the name of Gauri. She willdeserve the respect of Vishnu, Brahma and the other Gods.Himavat said that it is heard that the great God abhors all attachments. He has perfectself-control. He is ever busy in penance and is out of the reach of even the Gods. Thesupreme Brahman is great and imperishable. It is like the streak of a lamp. It is termedSadasiva. It is without aberration. It is beyond Brahma. It is both full and devoid ofqualities. It has no special traits, no desires. It sees within and not without.Narada enlightened Himavat, Parvati, was formerly the daughter of Daksa. Sati was herauspicious name. Sati who was Daksa's daughter became Rudra's wife. Beingdishonoured at the sacrifice of her father, and being the witness of Siva's dishonour shewas furious and she cast off her body. She herself is born in your house as Parvati. Thereis no doubt that she will become Siva's wife.\"All inauspicious things are auspicious in Sadasiva.The omniscient supreme Goddess Parvati told her mother that at night she had a dream inwhich a Brahmin sage advised her to perform the penance of Siva.2.Birth of Planet MarsReturning to His Mountain, Siva in his excitement caused by his separation from hisbeloved, remembered Sati, who was dearer to Him than his very life. Not seeing heranywhere, the pangs of his separation from Sati increasing, Siva, the benefactor of Hisdevotees, returned to His mountain and entered into trance for the destruction of misery.Thereupon He saw His imperishable real form. Thus Siva remained for a long timeeliminating the three attributes, and unaffected by aberrations. The lord Himself, thecontroller of illusion remained in the state of Supreme Brahmin.The drops of sweat caused by exhaustion fell on the Earth from the lord's forehead andtook the shape of a child immediately.Parvati, along with her maids, continued her daily service to the moon-crested lord,coming and going without any hindrance. She washed Siva's feet and drank that holywater. With a cloth heated in fire she wiped his body. After worshipping Him withsixteen types of offerings duly, and bowing to Him repeatedly she used to return to herfather's abode."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"34Shiva MahimnaSiva on seeing her with perfect control over her sense organs and engrossed in servingHim always, thought that he would take her only when the last seed of ego goes awayfrom her; when she herself performs a penance.\"3.The Birth of Taraka and Vajranga and their PenanceSaint Kasyapa married Diti, the eldest daughter of Daksa. A Son was born of Diti andwas named Vajranga (of adamantine limbs) who was on a par with the Gods. Befittinghis name, his body was strong and powerful even from his very birth.Brahma created an exquisite lady named Varangi and offered her to Vajranga, the son ofDiti. Varangi told her husband to grant her a powerful son who will conquer three worldsand cause misery to Visnu.Varangi devoted to Vajranga conceived. The child within her body developed in manyyears with its brilliance. Varangi, when the time was complete, delivered of a son of hugebody and great strength dazzling the ten quarters. Then Kasyapa Prajapati thought welland named the powerful demon Taraka.That heroic demon, with his manliness and valour manifesting quickly grew anddeveloped with his steely frame like the lord of mountains. Then the demon Taraka, ofgreat strength and exploit, endowed with a lofty mind, requested permission of hismother for performing penance.For a hundred years he performed penance with his hands lifted up, standing on only oneleg and gazing at the sun, with his mind steady and firm he observed all sacred rites.Then for a hundred years, the lord and king of Asuras, Taraka performed the penance:stood steady touching the ground with the single big toe.For hundred years he performed penance by drinking only water; another hundred yearsby sustaining himself on air alone, another hundred years standing in water and anotherhundred years standing on dry land. A hundred years he performed the penance amidstfires, a hundred years in a topsy-turvy position and a hundred years supported on theground by the palms of his hands. Another hundred years he remained with his headdown and feet up clinging fast to the branch of a tree and inhaling the pure smoke of thesacrificial fire.After going there, the haughty Kama, deluded by Siva's magic power, stationed himself,after first spreading the enchanting power of spring all around. The fragrant flowers ofMango and Asoka trees shone heightening feelings of love.Diverse sounds of the humming of the bees rang sweet in the ears of everyoneheightening temptations of love. The bright light of the moon scattered all aroundappeared to be the emissary of lovers and their beloveds.On seeing the untimely display of spring, Siva the lord, who had assumed a physicalbody indulging in divine sports, thought it surprising. But He, the chief of the self-controlled and the remover of man's misery continued his severe penance. Kama usuallystationed within the mind manifested himself outside. But he could not find anyvulnerable loophole in Siva whereby he could enter him.In assistance to Kama, Parvati reached the place near Siva with emotions of love andaccompanied by spring. In order to make the trident-bearing lord take interest in her,Kama drew his bow very carefully and discharged his flowery arrow on Him. As was herusual practice she approached Siva, bowed to Him, worshipped Him and stood in front ofHim (awaiting further instructions)."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Shiva Mahimna35Then, Lord Siva began to describe her limbs joyfully. Siva said that Parvati is blessed ofmysteriously wonderful features. There is no other woman equal to her in beauty in threeworlds. She is the storehouse of finest beauty. She has wondrous beautiful limbs. She isan enchantress of even sages. She increases great happiness.Parvati smilingly laid bare some parts of her body and cast graceful glances at Him withgreat pleasure. On seeing these movements and gestures Siva became fascinated. LordSiva indulging in great divine sports spoke that he felt great pleasure on merely seeingher and what pleasure would he derive by embracing her?\" Lord Siva realized that Howwonderful and mysterious is the situation that has arisen! How is that he has beendeluded and fascinated? Though he was the lord and master, Kama has perturbed him.4.Kama’s DestructionHe saw Kama stationed on His left side with his bow fully drawn and ready to dischargethe arrow, Kama was haughty and so was very senseless. On seeing Kama in that attitude,instantaneously anger was aroused in lord Siva, the supreme soul. Standing high up in theair, holding the arrow and the bow, Kama discharged his arrow, usually unerring on Siva.The infallible weapon became futile on the great lord. The furious weapon calmed downin regard to the great soul, Siva.A great flame of fire sprang up from the third eye of the infuriated Siva. That fireoriginating instantaneously from the eye in the middle of His forehead blazed with flamesshooting up and resembling the fire of final dissolution in refulgence. After shooting upin the sky, it fell on the ground and rolled over the earth all round.Even before the Gods had the time to say \"Let him be forgiven, let him be excused\" itreduced Kama to ashes. With pallid face and limbs, the extremely agitated daughter ofthe king of mountains returned to her palace taking the maids along with her. Due to themisery on account of the death of her husband, Rati fell down unconscious, as if dead.Indra and other Gods came there and told Rati to take some ashes and preserve them. Thelord will resuscitate your lover and you will regain your lover again.The Gods requested Siva to ponder over the action of Kama, as there was no tinge ofselfishness in what he has done. The chaste Rati is lonely and miserable now. She is ingreat lamentation, O bestower of everything, please console her.Siva told Gods that what has happened, thanks to my fury, cannot be altered. The lordKama, the husband of Rati, shall remain bodiless till Visnu, incarnates as Krsna on theearth and marries Rukmini. Krsna will beget Kama in Rukmini when he goes to Dwarkaand begins to procreate children. His name will certainly be Pradyumna.The demon Sambara will abduct the boy at the time of his very birth. After abducting theboy, the great demon, Sambara, will throw him in the sea. Rati shall stay in his city tillthen. There alone you will get back to your husband Pradyumna. Kama in the name ofPradyumna will regain his wife after killing Sambara in a battle.Meanwhile Parvati told her mother that she would be performing penance to achieveSiva. Parvati was prevented from going to forest and forbidden to perform penance sinceshe was prevented from going to forest and forbidden to perform penance by Mena andhence she acquired the name Uma.5.Penance of Parvati and Marriage with SivaParvati eschewed necklace and wore the pure deerskin. She arrived at Gangavatarana forperforming penance. The Gangavatarana was in the Himalayas ridge where Siva who wasperforming meditation burned Kama."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"36Shiva MahimnaShe performed penance in the excellent holy centre Srngitirtha, which (later) acquired thetitle \"GauriSikhara\" due to her performance of penance thereon.Suppressing her sense organs with her mind, she started the great penance in a placewithin the proximity.In the summer she kept a perpetually blazing fire all round and remaining withincontinued muttering the mantra. In the rainy season she continuously remained sitting onthe bare ground on the rock and got her drenched by the downpour of rain. During thewinter, with great devotion she remained in water throughout. During snowfall and in thenights too she performed her penance observing fast.6. The Dalliance of SivaWhen Siva returned to Kailasa, the joyful Ganas made all arrangements for Hishappiness.Then taking Parvati the daughter of the mountain, with Him, Siva, the great Lord, went toa delightful brilliant isolated place.Making a wonderful bed conducive to good sexual pleasure, rendered smooth andfragrant with flowers and sandal paste and auspiciously supplemented with objects ofenjoyment, lord “Siva” the bestower of honour, indulged in dalliance with Parvati for athousand years of god.In that divine sport at the mere contact with Parvati, Siva elapsed in unconsciousness. Shetoo lapsed into unconsciousness due to the contact with Siva. She neither knew the daynor the night.When Siva was indulged in dalliance, along with Brahma and the Gods, Visnu, thefavourite deity of the gods came to him. Visnu said O great lord, what are you doinginside? Save us from the distress of Taraka. Being disturbed Siva’s semen wasdischarged.Siva asked the Gods that who would take his discharged semen. After saying this He let itfall on the ground. Urged by the gods Agni became a dove and swallowed it with hisbeak.When Siva took a long time to return, Parvati hastened there and saw the gods. Oncoming to know of the incident she became very furious.The goddess told the Gods that you are wicked and particularly selfish and for thatpurpose they give pain to others. And for the sake of realizing their self-interests youhave propitiated the lord and spoilt her dalliance. She had become a barren womantherefore. Parvati cursed them that from now onwards the wives of the gods would bebarren and the gods who offended her be unhappy, Parvati, the daughter of the mountain,immediately returned to her apartment along with Siva. Unable to endure the force of thesemen lord Agni became afflicted. Visnu and other gods had already lost their sense atthe curse of Parvati.Siva told god to vomit his semen. The semen of Siva lustrous and golden in color fallingon the ground seemed to touch the heaven, as it was as huge as a mountain.Agni dev asked for forgiveness from Siva and he was directed by the lord to deposit thesemen in womb of some good woman. Brahma said there is no woman in three worldsexcept Parvati to hold it in her womb. Then Narada suggested depositing the semen ofSiva in bodies of the ladies who take their morning bath in the month of Magha.Meanwhile the wives of the seven celestial sages came there desirous of taking their earlymorning bath in the month of Magha with other observances of rites."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Shiva Mahimna37After the bath, six of them were distressed by the chillness and were desirous of goingnear the flame of fire. Arundhati of good conduct and perfect knowledge saw themdeluded and dissuaded them at the behest of Siva.The particles of the semen entered their bodies through the pores of hairs.Vanishing immediately from the scene, Agni in the form of a flame, went back happily tohis region, mentally remembering Siva.The women became pregnant and were distressed by the burning sensation.The wives of the sages cast off their semen in the form of a foetus at the top of Himavat.They felt then relieved of their burning sensation.Unable to bear that semen of Siva and trembling much, Himavat became scorched by itand hurled it in the Ganga.The intolerable semen of lord Siva was deposited by Ganga in the forest of Sara grass bymeans of its waves.The semen that fell was turned in a handsome good-featured boy, full of glory andsplendour. He increased everyone’s pleasure.On the sixth day of the bright half of the lunar month of Margasirsa, the son of Siva wasborn in the world.At that time, on their mountain, Parvati the daughter of Himavat and Siva became veryhappy.Out of joy, milk exuded from the breasts of Parvati.7. Birth of GanesaOnce when Parvati was taking her bath, Sadasiva rebuked Nandin and came into theinner apartment. The mother of the universe, seeing the untimely arrival of Siva in themidst of her bath and toilet stood up. Parvati thought that there must be a servant of herown who will be expert in his duties. He must not stray from my behest even a speck.The friends Jaya and Vijaya discussed with Parvati that Pramathas are numerous. Butnone of them can be called our own.Thinking thus the goddess created a person with all the characteristics, out of the dirtfrom her body. He was known as Ganesa. He was spotless and handsome in every part ofhis body. He was huge in size and had all brilliance, strength and valour. She gave himvarious clothes and ornaments. Parvati told him to work as her gatekeeper from today.She told him that he was her son and without her permission, no one, by any means, shallintrude her apartment.Thus placing her son at the doorway, Parvati began to take bath with her friends,unworried. At this very moment Siva, came near the door. Not knowing that he was lordSiva, Ganesa told him that without her mother’s permission no one could go in. Onseeing him Siva replied that he does not know who he was. He told him that he is Sivaand none else. When lord Siva tried to enter the house, Ganesa became infuriated andstruck him with his staff.Then Siva too became furious. He commanded his own Ganas. The infuriated Ganas ofSiva questioned the son of Parvati who stood at the gate of his whereabouts. They toldhim they considered him as one of the Ganas and would not kill him. Otherwise he wouldhave been killed.Though warned thus, Ganesa, the son of Parvati, stood fearless. He did not leave his postat the door. After hearing his words, the Ganas of Siva went back and informed Sivaabout his stand. Siva asked them to beat him."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"38Shiva MahimnaWhen rebuked thus by lord Siva, the excellent Ganas went back. Girting up his loins,tying his turban firmly and clapping his calves and thighs, he spoke fearlessly to all theGanas. He told them that he was the son of Parvati. They are the Ganas of Siva. Both ofus are thus equal. They cannot enter the apartment either forcibly or humbly.The fight between the parties of Parvati and Siva is the one between a strong army and aboy. When thus taunted and rebuked they rushed towards Ganesa with big batons,decorating their arms and taking up different kinds of weapons. Gnashing their teeth,grunting and bellowing the Ganas rushed at him.Nandin came first and caught hold of his leg. He pulled at it. Bhringin then rushed at himand caught hold of his other leg. Before the Ganas of Siva had time to pull his legsGanesa struck a blow at their hands and got his legs free. Then seizing a big iron club andstanding at the doorway he smashed the Ganas.Now none among them stood face to face. Just as deer flee to any direction on seeing alion, the Ganas who were thousands in number fled in that manner. At this time, urged byNarada, all the gods including Visnu and Indra came there. Brahma went to pacifyGanesa. On seeing him approaching, the powerful Ganesa came to him very furiouslyand plucked his moustache and beard.Brahma told him that he has not come for fighting and that he was a Brahmin. He saidthat he has come to make peace and would cause no harm. On seeing the powerfulGanesa seizing the iron club he began to run away immediately. On seeing them in thatplight and on hearing the news, Siva, an adept in sports became very angry. He issueddirectives to Indra and other gods, to the Ganas led by the six-faced Kumara and togoblins, ghosts and spirits. At the bidding of Siva they all desired to kill Ganesa.Whatever weapon they had was hurled on Ganesa with force. In the meantime, goddess,the mother of the universe, of special knowledge, came to know of the entire incident andwas very furious. The goddess created two Saktis then and there for the assistance of herown Gana.One Sakti assumed a very fierce form and stood there opening her mouth as wide as thecavern of a dark mountain. The other assumed the form of lighting. She wore many arms.She was a huge and terrible goddess ready to punish the wicked. The weapons hurled bythe gods and the Ganas were caught in the mouth and hurled back at them.The earth with all the oceans quaked. As a result of violent battle even mountains felldown. The sky whirled with the planets and the stars. Everything was agitated. The godsfled. The Ganas too did likewise. But the Ganas fought in vain with the two Saktis. Theweapons of the gods and the Ganas were broken and hence withdrawn by them. Then thefurious Rudra became more furious and went there along with his Ganas.The entire army of the gods along with the discus bearing Visnu shouted in jubilation andfollowed Siva. Visnu of great strength, valour and skill and possessing great divineweapons and Siva’s form fought with him. Ganesa hit all the chief gods with his staff. Hehit Visnu too, all of a sudden; the hero had been conferred great strength by the saktis.Parvati’s son of great strength and heroism saw Siva arrived there with desire to fight himto a finish, the great lord with the trident in his hand.Ganesa felled that to the ground by means of his iron club. The hero had been conferredgreat strength by the saktis. Ganesa, son of the Saktis whirled the iron club and hurled itat Visnu. After remembering the lotus-like feet of Siva, Visnu took up his discus and splitthe iron club by means of discus. Securing this opportunity, the trident bearing deity"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Shiva Mahimna39came there and cut off his head with his trident. When the head of Ganesa was cut off, thearmies of the gods and the Ganas stood still.After cutting off the head of Ganesa even as Siva became sorry, goddess Parvati becamefurious. Lamenting thus, the great goddess of all the worlds angrily created in a momenthundreds and thousands of Saktis. On being commanded by her, the infuriated Saktis gotready to destroy the gods and others. Just as the fire consumes dry grass so also thesesaktis attempted to destroy. Leaders of Ganas or Visnu, Brahma or Siva, Indra or Kubera,Skanda or the Sun, Saktis began to destroy them.Narada and other sages went to Parvati in order to appease her anger. They thenpropitiated her. They bowed to her again and again. They eulogized her with manyhymns. They tried to please her with devotion and at the behest of the gods and Ganasspoke thus. On hearing their words Parvati was pleased and she replied to the sages withher mind full of compassion. If her son regains life there may not be further annihilation.If they can arrange for him a honourable status and position among them as the chiefpresiding officer, there may be peace in the world.Siva hearing this sends Gods to the northern direction and told them to bring head ofwhatever person they meet and fit it to Ganesa. Gods paid homage to it and startedtowards the north. It was a single tusked elephant that they met. They took the head andfitted it to the body of Ganesa.Then Brahma, Visnu and other gods jointly sprinkled the holy water invoked by themantras, on that body after remembering Siva. Immediately after the contact of the holywater the boy was resuscitated to life and joined with consciousness. He was handsome,extremely comely. He had the face of an elephant. He was red-complexioned. He wasdelighted with face beaming. He was brilliant and had fine features.They showed him delightfully to the goddess. On seeing her restored to life, the goddesswas greatly delighted. Siva, Visnu and Brahma told the gods with pleasure that just asthey were worshipped in all the three worlds, so also all shall worship Ganesa. He shallbe worshipped first and they shall be worshipped afterwards. If he is not worshipped,they too are not worshipped. If the other deities are worshipped when he is notworshipped, the fruit of that rite will be lost. Siva told him to be the presiding officer ofall his Ganas and worthy of worship, another boon was granted to Ganesa by thedelighted Siva of great soulGanesa, born in the first Prahara on the fourth day in the dark half of the Bhadra mouth atthe auspicious hour of the moonrise, since his form manifested itself from the good mindof Parvati, his excellent Vrata shall be performed on that Tithi itself or beginning fromthat day. It will be very auspicious and conducive to the achievement of all Siddhis. TheVrata shall be performed till the fourth day at the end of a year. Ganesa shall be adoredwith incense, lamps and different kinds of food-offerings.8.Ganesa’s MarriageThe love and affection of the parents towards the six-faced lord and Ganesa increased toa great extent like the moon in the bright half of the month. Parvati and Siva thought thatthe two sons had attained to marriageable age and how best their marriage should becelebrated. Both quarreled with each other.Siva and Parvati told them that the auspicious marriage would be celebrated of that boywho comes here first after going round the entire earth. Kumara started immediately fromthe fixed point in order to go round the earth. Ganesa worshipped Siva and Parvati and"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"40Shiva Mahimnacircumambulated seven times and bowed too seven times. Then Ganesa told them that hisauspicious marriage should be celebrated quickly. Siva and Parvati told him that heshould circumambulate the earth with all its forests. Kumara has already gone. He tooshould start and return first. Ganesa replied that I have circumambulated the earthfrequently, for seven times.Parents asked him when was the great earth circumambulated by him, the earth consistingof seven continents extending to the oceans and consisting of vast jungle. Ganesa repliedthat by worshipping his parents, Parvati and Siva, he has intelligently circumambulatedthe earth extending to the oceans. The holy center of a son consists of the lotus like feetof his parents. This holy center is near at hand, easily accessible and a means of virtue.For a son and wife, the auspicious holy center is in the house itself. These things arementioned frequently in the Sastras and the Vedas. Ganesa said that his auspiciousmarriage be celebrated and that too very quickly. Otherwise the Vedas and Sastras aredeclared false. Then, Siva and Parvati praised their son who was clever and intelligent.Appeasing Ganesa, the ocean of intelligence, they resolved to perform his marriage.In the meantime Prajapati Visvarupa became delighted and happy on knowing theirintention. Prajapati Visvarupa had two daughters of divine features. They were famous asSiddhi and Buddhi.The lord Siva and Parvati jubilantly celebrated the marriage of Ganesa with them. Thedelighted gods attended their marriage as desired by Siva and Parvati. Visvakarman madeall arrangements for the marriage.After sometime, the noble Ganesa begot two sons, one each of his wives. They wereendowed with divine features. The son Ksema was born to Siddhi. The highly brilliantson Labha was born to Buddhi. While Ganesa was enjoying the inconceivable happiness,the second son returned after circumambulating the earth.Thereupon Narada addressed him.After driving you out under the pretext of circumambulating the earth, Parvati and Sivahave celebrated the excellent and auspicious marriage of Ganesa, the entire earthconsisting of oceans and jungles has been traversed by you due to their deceptive behest.This is the result of that.Narada told Kumara that your parents have not done well. Just ponder over it. I do notthink their has been good.After bowing to his father, the infuriated Kumara went to the Kraunca Mountain thoughforbidden by his parents.Ever since that day, the son of Siva, Karttikeya remains a bachelor. His name bestowsauspiciousness in the world. It is famous in the three worlds. It dispels all sins, ismeritorious and confers the sanctity of celibacy.In the month of Karttika, the gods, the holy sages and great ascetics go there to seeKumara. Parvati became grief stricken by separation from Skanda. She piteouslyrequested Siva to take her to him. Goddess Siva went to that mountain partially for herhappiness. They assumed the pleasing form of Jyotirlinga known as MalikaArjuna.On the full and new moon days, Parvati and Siva are excited by love towards their son.On new moon days, Siva himself goes there. On full moon days, Parvati goes therecertainly.9. The Tripuras"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Shiva Mahimna41When Skanda, the son of Siva, killed the Asura Taraka his three sons performedausterities. The eldest of them was Tarakaksa, the middle one Vidyunmali and theyoungest Kamalaksa.Eschewing all enjoyments captivating the mind, they went to the cavern of the mountainMeru and performed a wonderful penance.They were not at all vexed or distressed thereby. They gradually increased the severity oftheir austerities. Thus the three excellent sons of Taraka performed penance with Brahmaas the object of their worship. Maintaining strict severity in their austerities, the excellentAsuras made their bodies emaciated by their penance.Satisfied by their penance, Brahma the supreme lord of the gods and Asuras, of greatglory, appeared in front of them in order to grant them boons. The Asuras requested himto grant them indestructibility at the hands of everyone, every living being.Brahma told them that there couldn’t be invariable indestructibility. They would have toseek some other boon. Except Siva the destroyer of Death, and Visnu all else are mortals.Immortality is impossible for the gods and the Asuras. The Asuras then requested him tobuild and give them three wonderful cities richly endowed with wealth and unassailableeven to the gods. Tarakaksa then said that Visvakarma should make a city, which cannotbe broken even by the gods, and that golden city would be his. Kamalaksa requested for agreat silver city. The delighted Vidyunmali requested for steel-set magnetic city.They continued that they would join together during midday at the time of Abhijit, at theend of a thousand years; these cities shall never join otherwise. When these cities arejoined together, the lord who embodies all the gods sitting in a wonderful chariotcontaining all necessary adjuncts, may, in his distorted sport, discharge a wonderfulsingle arrow and pierce our cities.On hearing their words, Brahma, the grandfather and creator of the worlds rememberedSiva and granted them the boon.He ordered Maya to build three cities, one of gold, another of silver and a third one ofsteel. The three fort-like excellent cities were in order in heaven, sky and on the earth.Entering the three cities thus, the sons of Taraka, of great strengthen and valourexperienced all enjoyments.Thus the Asuras, sons of Taraka, after acquiring the boons, lived there subservient toMaya, a great devotee of Siva. Abandoning the other parts in the three worlds theyentered the cities and ruled the kingdom following the principles of Siva.The distressed gods including Indra went to the place where the bull-bannered god Sivawas staying. Eulogizing thus the bull-bannered, the trident bearing lord Siva with variouskinds of divine hymns. The gods said that the Asura accompanied by his brothers hasdefeated Indra; the sons of Taraka have defeated all the gods.Siva said that a meritorious person is the presiding ruler of the Tripuras now. A sensibleperson should not kill him who practices meritorious deeds.Those Asuras are my devotees and are very strong. The gods or demons cannot kill them.They should not be slain as long as they continue their devotion to me. This reason mayvery well be intimated to Visnu.When the three cities came to a unified whole, a tumultuous shout of joy rose up amongthe noble Gods and others. Then stringing the bow tight and fixing the arrow Pasupataworthy of worship, he thought of the Tripuras."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"42Shiva MahimnaIn the auspicious moment called Abhilasa he drew the bow and made a wonderful andunbearable twanging sound. He addressed the great Asuras and proclaimed his ownname. Siva discharged an arrow that had the refulgence of countless suns.The arrow which was constituted by Visnu and whose steel head was fire god blazedforth and burnt the three Asuras who lived in the three cities. It thereby removed theirsins. The three cities reduced to ashes fell on the earth girt by the four oceans.Just as the universe is burnt at the end of a Kalpa so also every thing and every one there,whether woman or man or vehicles, was reduced to ashes by that fire.Those who were not opposed to the gods were saved by Siva’s brilliance, those whodevoutly sought refuge in lord Siva at the time of adversity.On merely seeing the terrible form of Siva, dazzling the ten quarters, resemblingcountless suns in refulgence and on a par with the fire at the hour of dissolution, and alsothe goddess Parvati, the daughter of Himavat, the illustrious gods stood humbly in theirfight.In the meantime the Asura Maya, who was not burnt due to the strength of grace, camethere on seeing Siva delighted. Maya the foremost among the Asuras, with his mind fullof devotion and voice choked with emotions of love eulogized facing Siva. He requestedSiva to grant permanent devotion to him.Then the lord, after completing the tasks of gods, vanished from the scene accompaniedby his Ganas, goddess Parvati and the sons. Then Brahma, Visnu, the gods, sages,Gandharva, Kinnaras, Nagas, serpents, celestial damsels and the delighted men went totheir abodes praising the glory of Siva.10.The Birth of Jalandhara and his MarriageOnce Brahspati and Indra went to Kailasa with great devotion, to see lord Siva. Lord Sivawished to test their knowledge. Accordingly, the lord, the excellent goal of good, stoodblocking their path in the naked form with matted hair and beaming face.Indra asked the Brahmin his whereabouts and asked whether Siva was in his apartment orhas gone anywhere. The naked lord, though asked repeatedly by Indra, did not sayanything, for he wanted to test the knowledge of Indrra. Looking at him ferociously Indraraised his thunderbolt in order to kill him. On seeing Indra lifting up his thunderbolt, Sivaprevented the fall of the thunderbolt by making his hand benumbed.Then Siva became furious. His eyes became terrible. He blazed with his burningsplendour. On seeing him resplendent, Brahspati realized immediately that he was lordSiva himself and bowed to him.Then the noble minded Brhaspati joined his palms in reverence. He prostrated before himand began to eulogise the lord. Brahspati requested him to quieten the anger rising fromhis eyes. He requested him to protect Indra who has sought refuge in him.Siva told him that he has to cast off this fire born of his eye in the forehead intended tokill Indra lest it should afflict him. On saying this he held that wonderful brilliance bornof the eye in the forehead and cast it off in the briny ocean.The brilliance of Siva born of the eye in the forehead and cast off into the briny seaimmediately assumed the form of a boy. At the confluence of the river Ganga and theocean, the boy of terrific features cried loudly.Brahma descended from Satyaloka to the earth along with the gods. Then he went to theoceans desirous of knowing what it was. The son of the ocean caught hold of the neck of"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Shiva Mahimna43Brahma and shook it several times. In due course tears came out of the eyes of Brahma,the creator of all the worlds.Since he was able to make Brahma’s eyes water he was famous in the name ofJalandhara. He became a youth at that moment. Brahma said that He will become amaster of all sacred lores, very valorous, courageous, heroic, invincible and majestic.This boy will become the emperor of Asuras. He will conquer even Visnu. He cannot beslain by anyone except Siva.With a joyous heart ocean nurtured the boy with diverse great means. The boy grew intoa beautiful youth of exquisite limbs and wonderful splendour. Then the ocean invited thegreat Asura Kalanemi and requested him to give his daughter named Vrnda in marriageto his son.He gave his beloved daughter to Jalandhara, the brave son of the ocean, in marriageperforming the nuptial rites according to the Brahma style. The heroic son of the ocean,Jalandhara, foremost among the Asura warriors, received a very beautiful lady as his wifeand he ruled over the kingdom with the support of Sukra.Once the son of the ocean, the noble hearted husband of Vrnda, was seated along with hiswife and the Asuras. The brilliant Bhargava came there joyously illuminating the tenquarters as the embodied brilliance.Bhargava told them that all the gods, the assistants of Visnu churned the ocean eagerlyfor the gain of nectar, along with the Asuras. The enemies of the Asuras extracted jewelsfrom the ocean. The gods seized the nectar and drank it deceitfully. Then the godsincluding Indra increased in strength and prowess by the drinking of the nectar andharassed the Asuras with the assistance of Visnu. This Visnu who is always a partisan ofIndra, cut off the head of Rahu as he was drinking the nectar along with the gods. Thenon hearing about the churning of his father, the heroic son of the ocean, the valorousJalandhara became furious and his eyes turned red with anger. Jalandhara called hisexcellent emissary Ghasmara and sent him to Indra as his messenger. Ghasmara, theintelligent emissary of Jalandhara, hastened to heaven where all gods were present.Ghamsara told the Gods that Jalandhara, the son of the ocean, is the lord and emperor ofall the Asuras. He is excessively heroic and valorous. He has the support and assistanceof Bhargava. Jalandhara has asked Gods why was his father, the ocean, churned by themwith the mountain? Why were all the jewels of his father taken away?. They shouldreturn all of them to him immediately and Gods should seek refuge in him.On hearing the words of the messenger, Indra, the lord of the gods, was bewildered. Indratold him that those who oppose him can never remain happy.Dismissed thus by Indra, the intelligent emissary Ghasmara hastened to the place wherethe heroic Jalandhara was present. On hearing it, the lips of the Asura throbbed withanger. Desirous of conquering the gods he exerted himself immediately. Very soon, hereached the heaven along with his force.After going to heaven he stationed himself in Nandana. In the midst of all his forces heroared like a lion. Then a battle between the armies of the gods and Asuras ensued. Theyrushed against one another with iron clubs, arrows, maces, axes and spears. They hit oneanother. Within short time both the armies began to wade through streams of blood.Bhargava resuscitated the Asuras killed in the battle with the Vidya of Amrtajivini anddrops of water infused with mantras. The sage Angiras too resuscitated the gods in thebattle with the divine herbs frequently brought from the mountain Drona."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"44Shiva MahimnaBhargava told Jalandhar that if he wishes for victory she should immediately uproot themountain Drona and hurl it into the ocean. With his powerful arms, the Asura brought themountain Drona and hurled it immediately into the ocean. All the gods including Indra,struck by the king of the Asuras all a round, lost courage and fled in all directions. Onseeing the gods routed, the Asura, Jalandhara, the son of the ocean, entered Amravatiwith sounds of victory from the conches and drums.All the Gods including Prajapati eulogized Visnu after bowing down to him. The godstold him that all the gods have been driven out of heaven by Jalandhara.Visnu then came to the battlefield on his vehicle Garuda. Roaring like a lion andaccompanied by the gods who blazed with Visnu’s splendour, he reached the place whereJalandhara was waiting.Then on seeing the Asuras afflicted by the gusts of wind, Jalandhara rushed against Visnushouting out cries of bravery angrily.Thus the Asuras clever and efficient in battle, commanded by Jalandhara on the one handand gods equipped with the four sorts of fighting groups on the other fought one anotherwith maces, arrows, javelins, spears etc. They hit one another with axes and spears. Thusthe fight between the gods and the Asuras was terrific.Striking with a single arrow, Visnu smote the heart of the Asura. With innumerablearrows he cut off the umbrella, banner, bow and arrows of thedemon. The infuriatedAsura with throbbing lips hit Visnu in his heart with his sharp spear diffusing itssplendour.Then the infuriated Jalandhara, invincible in war, terrifying to the Asura hurled a trident,resembling fire, at Visnu. Immediately Visnu remembered the lotus like feet of Siva andcut the trident with his sword Nandaka.When the trident was split, the lord of the Asuras leapt and rushed against Visnu and hithim in the chest with his fist. Without minding the pain in the least, the heroic Visnu hitJalandhara in the chest with his firm fist.Both of them equally powerful had hand-to-hand fight hitting each other with arms, fistsand knees. They filled the earth with reverberating sounds.Fighting with the Asura thus, for a long time, Visnu was surprised. He felt dejected in theheart.Then he the foremost among the magic-wielders assumed a delightful aspect. Visnu toldJalandhara that he was blessed. He was invincible in war and was not at all afraid of evengreat weapons. Visnu asked him to choose a boon.On hearing these words of Visnu, skilled in magic, the intelligent king of the Asurarequested Visnu to stay in his house with all his followers and his wife, Jalandhara’ssister. Then Visnu came to the city called Jalandhara along with his followers, the godsand Laksmi.The son of the ocean confiscated whatever gem or jewels the gods, Gandharva or Siddhashad hoarded. Making gods, Gandharvas, Siddhas, Serpents, Raksasas and human beings,the denizens of his capital, he ruled over the three worlds.When he was ruling the kingdom virtuously, none in his realm was sick or miserable orlean and emaciated or indigent. The distressed gods mentally sought refuge in Siva thebenefactor, lord of gods and of everyone.The great lord Siva, the bestower of all desires to his devotees called Narada andcommissioned him with a desire to carry out the tasks of the gods."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Shiva Mahimna45Then the celestial sage, the wise devotee of Siva, went to the gods in the city of theAsuras at the bidding of Siva. On seeing the sage Narada coming, the distressed gods,Indra and others, stood up.The gods said that the Asura Jalandhara from their abodes and positions of controllingauthority has routed them. Hence they are miserable and distressed. The great AsuraJalandhara who has suppressed the gods and who is very powerful has made Visnusubservient to him in the battle.Narada consoled them and went to the assembly chamber of Jalandhara to see thefavourite Asura. Narada told him that he had been to the summit of Kailasa casually. It isten thousand Yojanas wide. It has a grove of Kalpa trees.Hundreds of Kamadhenus are found there. Cintamani gems illuminate it. It abounds ingold. It is divine and wonderfully brilliant. There I saw Siva seated along with Parvati.He has three eyes and the moon for his crest.Narada continued that an idea of his prosperity struck into his mind. He said thatJalandhara deserves the most excellent of all the ladies. Jalandhara asked him wherecould he find such a lady. And even if the lady exists anywhere in the whole of thisuniverse he would bring her here.Narada said that Kailasa is very beautiful and it possesses all sorts of things conducive toprosperity. Siva lives there assuming the form of a naked Yogin. His wife Parvati isexquisitely beautiful in every limb. She is charming and has all the characteristics of abeautiful lady.The prosperity that Siva enjoys in as much as he indulges in dalliance with the mostexcellent of all ladies has not come to Jalandhara.After saying this, the world-renowned celestial sage Narada, pursuing his attempt to helpthe gods departed from there by the aerial path.The king of Daityas who had heard of the exquisite beauty of Parvati became harassedwith pangs of love. The deluded Daitya, Jalandhara, who had lost clear thinking, beingswayed by Time called his messenger Rahu. Jalandhara told Rahu to go to the mountainKailasa.Rahu went to Kailasa and was allowed to enter by Nandin. The emissary named Rahubowed to Siva. His haughtiness subsided by the brilliance of his body. He went near Siva.Rahu was desirous of speaking to him. Urged by his gesture Rahu spoke to the three-eyedgod Siva.The son of the ocean Jalandhara became the lord of all Daityas and now he is the lord ofthree worlds. The exquisitely beautiful wife is of no avail to you as you stay in the jungleattended by ghosts, goblins, spirits and other beings.All excellent things shine in Jalandhara’s possession, and Parvati is the most excellent ofall ladies. She deserves him better than you who live on alms. Hence he too shouldsurrender his wife the most excellent of all ladies to him.When Rahu spoke thus, a terrific being resonant like the thunder came out from the spacebetween the eyebrows of the trident-bearing deity.He had a leonine mouth with a moving tongue; his eyes shed fiery flames; his hair stoodat its end; his body was dry and rough. He appeared to be the man lion incarnation ofVisnu. He was huge in size. He had long arms. His calves were as stout and huge as thePalmyra tree. He was very terrible. He immediately rushed at Rahu."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"46Shiva MahimnaOn seeing him rushing to devour, Rahu was terrified. Rahu pleaded to Siva that he was aBrahmin and these Ganas want to swallow a Brahmin.The great lord told Ganas to leave the Brahmin Rahu, the emissary who has soughtrefuge. Commanded thus by the lord of Parvati, the Gana set Rahu free, on hearing theword Brahmin. After approaching Jalandhara the lord of Daityas, Rahu explainedeverything concerning Siva in detail.On hearing it the powerful son of the ocean, the excellent lord of Daityas, Jalandharabecame furious from head to foot.The lord of the Asuras the valorous son of the ocean set out quickly accompanied bycrores of Daityas.On seeing his enterprise, the gods including Indra went to Kailasa, the abode of Sivawithout being observed. After going there and seeing Siva, the gods including Indra,bowed to him with stooping shoulders.The gods told Siva that they were very much distressed by Jalandhara's harassment. Allincluding Indra are deposed and compelled to stay on the earth. Visnu who was assignedthe task of protection by Siva was unable to protect them. They told him that thepowerful son of the ocean is coming to fight with him.He should kill Jalandhara in battle without delay and save them as they have soughtrefuge in him.On hearing the words of the gods the bull-bannered deity laughed. He called Visnuimmediately and asked him why he did not kill Jalandhara in battle. Visnu replied that hedid not kill Jalandhara in war because he was born of a part of Siva. Moreover he isLaksmi's brother. Then Visnu requested Siva to kill Jalandhara.Siva told them to go back to their abodes fearlessly, considering the ruler of the Asurasalready killed.In the meantime, that valorous king of the Daityas went along with the well-equippedAsuras to the outskirts of the mountain. Accompanied by a vast army he laid siege toKailasa. He stood there like the God of death roaring like a lion.On hearing the tumultuous roar of the Daityas, lord Siva of great sports, the destroyer ofthe wicked, became very furious. Nandin, Vighnesvara, Kumara and all other Ganas, atthe bidding of Siva hurriedly got ready for the battle.Then at the ridges, valleys and sides of Kailasa, a terrible battle was fought between theleaders of the Pramathas and the Daityas. The whole earth shook resonant with thesounds of Great War drums, Mrdangas and conches that inspired the heroes as well as thesounds of elephants, horses and chariots.The whole atmosphere was filled with javelin, iron clubs, arrows, great pestles, iron rods,pikes etc. as if strewn with pearls.With the power of Sanjivani, Bhargava resuscitated the forces of the Daityas killed by thePramathas in the battle again and again.On hearing it lord Siva became terribly furious.A terrible Krtya came out of Rudra's mouth. Her calves were as stout as Palmyra trees.Her mouth was huge and deep like mountain caverns. With her breasts she crushed hugetrees. Fearlessly she rushed amid the battlefield where Bhargava was stationedsurrounded by the leading Daityas.She enveloped the whole sky with her terrible brilliance. She split the ground she trod;she stuffed Bhargava into her vaginal passage and vanished in the sky."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"Shiva Mahimna47On seeing Bhargava seized, the invincible armies of the Daityas became dejected andfaded in their faces. They fled from the battleground.On seeing the army destroyed, the powerful son of the ocean rushed at the Ganas in hischariot of waving and wafting colours. The many arrows discharged by Jalandhara as ifby floating masses of mist enveloped the space between heaven and the earth.Hitting Nandin and Ganesa with five arrows each and Virabhadra with twenty he roaredlike thunder.Karttikeya the heroic son of Siva then swiftly hit the Daitya Jalandhara with his spear androared. Then Jalandhara the infuriated leader of the Daitya hit Karttikeya in his chest withhis mace.Exhibiting the successful efficiency of the Mace secured as a favour from BrahmaKarttikeya fell on the ground suddenly.Similarly, struck by the mace Nandin too fell on the ground.Then the infuriated hero Ganesa came there after remembering the lotus like feet of Sivaand split the mace of the Daitya with his axe.Virabhadra then hit the Danava in his chest with these arrows. He cut off the banner,umbrella, bow and the horses of the Daitya with seven arrows.Then the infuriated leader of the Daitya lifted up his terrible Sakti and felled Ganesa.Jalandhara, the heroic king of Daityas, hit Virabhadra with a fierce arrow and roared.Then both of them, the most excellent of heroes refulgent like the sun, fought each otherwith different kinds of weapons and missiles.The heroic and powerful son of the ocean hit Virabhadra on his head with his great ironclub.Virabhadra, the leader of the Ganas, fell on the ground with his head shattered by the ironclub and shed much blood. On seeing Virabhadra fallen, the terrified Ganas abandonedthe battleground shrieking and fled to Lord Siva.Then the great lord Siva assuming a terrible form went laughingly to the battlefield andsat on his bull, accompanied by his heroic Ganas. On seeing Siva the terrible, all theDaityas returning from the battlefield, Jalandhara rushed at Siva discharging thousands ofarrows.On seeing his army of Ganas enveloped in darkness by the volley of arrows, Siva split thenet of their arrows and encompassed the sky with his own. He afflicted the Daityas withthe gusts of wind raised by the arrows. He felled them to the ground with fierce volley ofarrows.Then the great Asura Jalandhara became infuriated and rebuked the Daityas in the battle.Jalandhara the great Daitya hit the bull-bannered Siva of indefatigable endeavour, with anincessant volley of arrows.Laughingly, lord Siva split all the arrows of Jalandhara by discharging his own sharparrows even before his arrows reached him. Then with seven arrows he split the horses,banner, umbrella and the bow of Daitya Jalandhara.The infuriated Asura the son of the ocean, devoid of a chariot and with bow split uprushed at Siva lifting his mace vigorously. Lord Siva of great sports immediately split asunder the mace hurled by him, by means of his arrows.Then, considering Siva more powerful, Jalandhara the Daitya created the illusion ofGandharva that mysteriously fascinated even Siva. By the power of his Maya, hosts of"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"48Shiva MahimnaGandharvas and the celestial damsels came into view for fascinating Siva. On seeing thatwonderful feat, Siva was fascinated by the Ganas.On seeing Siva concentrated in the dance Jalandhara urged by lust immediately went tothe place where Gauri stood. He entrusted the powerful Sumbha and Nisumbha with theconduct of war. With his demoniac Maya he assumed the form of Siva with ten brawnyarms, five faces, three eyes, and matted hair. He was seated on the great bull. In everyrespect, Jalandhara appeared like Siva.When the lord of Asura saw the beautiful Parvati, he let drops of semen fall and his limbsbecame benumbed. On realizing that he was the demon, the terrified Gauri vanishedimmediately to the northern shore of the Manasa Lake.Parvati remembered lord Visnu mentally and told him that at her bidding, he shouldviolate chastity of Jalandhara's wife. That great Daitya cannot be killed otherwise. In theearth there is no other virtue equal to chastity.After going to the city of Jalandhara, Visnu thought of violating the chastity of Vrnda.The gentle lady Vrnda, the wife of Jalandhara, though of pure rites, had a very bad dreamat night on account of Visnu's power of illusion. On realizing that it was a bad portent,the terrified lady began to cry, then she, the dejected gloomy wife of Jalandhara,wandered from forest to forest. The wandering lady saw two demons of terrible leoninefaces with shining curved fanglike teeth.Seeing the agitated lady followed by the demons the sage drove them back with a loudbellowing sound of \"Hum\". Vrnda said that he has saved her from the terrible danger, thewicked demons.Vrnda asked the sage who would Jalandhara her husband fare in the war.In the meantime two lordly monkeys came there and stood bowing down in front of him.At a significant gesture from his eyebrows, the monkeys rose into the sky again. Within atrice, they came back taking with them his head, body and limbs and stood in front of thesage.On seeing the head, body and limbs of her husband, Vrnda fell unconscious, extremelypained at the misery of her lord.Then steadying herself a little, and heaving deep sighs of grief she bowed to the excellentsage with palms joined in reverence and requested him to resuscitate her husband,Jalandhara was reviewed to life by the sage.Delighted in mind he embraced Vrnda and kissed her face. Delighted in the heart andwith all the dormant passions kindled up, she sported with him for many days in themiddle of that forest.Once at the end of the sexual intercourse she realized that it was Visnu. Vrnda rebukedhim and cursed him that the two persons who appeared in front of her would becomeRaksasas and abducts his wife.She continued that he would be distressed on account of separation from his wife andwould roam about with Sesa \"lord of snakes\" who posed as his disciples. He would seekthe help of monkeys in the forest.After saying this, Vrnda entered fire though prevented by Visnu who was fascinated byher charms. Then the brilliance of the wife of Jalandhara immediately went to Sivaloka.Unable to see Parvati, the king of Daityas returned to the battleground. The groups ofdeceptive Gandharvas vanished. It was only then that the bull-bannered deity regainedawareness of the surroundings."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Shiva Mahimna49Then Siva was a bit surprised in the mind. He approached Jalandhara angrily in order tofight with him. On seeing Siva approaching again, the Aasura showered him with arrows.Lord Siva immediately split the cluster of arrows discharged by the powerful Jalandharaby means of his own excellent arrows.Seeing Siva exhibiting wonderful feats of valour, Jalandhara created Parvati by means ofhis illusion in order to delude Siva. He saw Parvati tied to the chariot and crying, she wasbeing harassed by Nisumbha, Sumbha and other Daityas.On seeing that in her plight, Siva became dispirited and dejected in the mind like anordinary man pursuing the way of the world.Then Jalandhara hurriedly hit Siva in his chest, and the head with three arrows that wentdeep down as far as the feathered tail.Then within a trice, lord Siva, the principle of perfect wisdom, expert in great sports,assumed a terrific form, dreadfully blazing. On seeing his excessively terrible form theDaityas fled to ten different quarters.Sumbha and Nisumbha who were renowned for their prowess could not stand in thebattleground.The illusion created by Jalandhara had vanished in an instant.On seeing Sumbha and Nisumbha fleeing, the infuriated Siva rebuked them and cursedthat since they have escaped from a fight with him they would be killed by Parvati.Then the infuriated Siva assuming a terrible form became as dreadful as the fire ofdissolution, all of a sudden.As desired by Brahma the lord protector of the worlds decided to kill Jalandhara, the lordSiva who had slain Daksa, Andhaka Aantaka and destroyed the three cities and thesacrifice of Daksa.Siva held in his hand the wheel Sudarsana that he had made with his toe and got ready tokill him. Lord Siva hurled the discus Sudarsana that resembled a crore of suns and thefire of dissolution.Blazing the heaven and the earth, the discus hit Jalandhara and severed his head withwide gaping eyes. The body of the son of the ocean fell on the ground from the chariotmaking the earth resonant. The head too fell. There was a great hue and cry.His body fell in two halves like the mountain of collyrium split by the thunderbolt andhurled in the ocean. The whole universe was filled with his terrible blood. His entireblood and flesh, at the bidding of Siva was taken to the hell Maharaurva and became abig pit of blood there.On seeing Jalandhara killed, the gods, the Gandharvas and the serpents became highlydelighted.Thus the entire universe of the three worlds regained their earlier health and normalcymuch when Siva of infinite forms killed the son of the ocean.11.The Birth of SankhacudaAmong the wives of Kasyapa the excellent lady Danu was one. She was very beautiful,chaste and tenderly nurtured by her husband with all devotion and love.One of his sons was Vipracitti who was very powerful and valorous. His virtuous sonDambha of self-control was a great devotee of Visnu.No son was born to him. He performed a great penance in the holy center Puskara for ahundred thousand years. Seating himself in a stable pose he performed the Japa of Krsnamantra for a long time."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"50Shiva MahimnaVisnu was happy and asked his wish.Dambha requested him to give him a powerful and valorous son, invincible to the godsand would conquer the three worlds.The boy was born and on an auspicious day the father named him “Sankhacuda”.Sankhacuda performed a penance in Puskara for along time in order to propitiate Brahmawith devotion.He requested Brahma to grant him the power of being invincible to the gods.He gave Sankhacuda the divine amulet of Srikrsna the most auspicious things in theuniverse, that yielded victory everywhere.Brahma also told him to go to Badari and marry Tulasi, the daughter of Dharmadhvaja.The Danava went there and accepted her by means of Gandharva rite. After marrying herhe went to his father’s place.With the consent of the Asuras, the preceptor Sukra made him the emperor of Danavas,Asuras and others with jubilant festivities.Taking a vast army of Daityas, Danavas and Raksasas and seated in his chariot, hemarched quickly to the city of Indra with the intention to conquer it.The son of Dambha, the valorous leader of the Danavas, conquered all the worlds andtook up the powers of the gods.The great hero, the powerful Sankhacuda became overlord of the gods, Asuras, Danavas,Raksasas, Gandharvas, serpents, Kinnaras, Nagas and in fact all of the people of the threeworlds.When he ruled, none was miserable in the three worlds.Sankhacuda was a close friend of Krsna, the resident of Goloka. He was powerful, andalways engaged in devotion to Krsna.All the gods went to Visnu and requested him to protect them from Sankhacuda. Visnutold them about his previous birth. He was Sudhama and was fascinated by Radha, wifeof Krsna by Siva’s illusion.Cursed by Radha he is born as a Danava to his distress. Krsna has already ordained thatthe death of Sankhacuda will be by Rudra’s trident.Then lord Siva, Death to the wicked, goal of the good, decided in his mind to slaySankhacuda in accordance with the wishes of the gods.He made his friend Puspadanta the lord Gandharva his messenger and sent him in awonderful chariot hurriedly to Sankhacuda joyously.Puspadanta told Sankhacuda that he was the Emissary of Siva named Puspadanta. Sivahas asked to return back Gods kingdom and their authority to them. If not then he has tofight with Siva, the greatest of the good warriors.Sankhacuda told him that he would never return the kingdom to the gods and would fightwith Siva.Puspadanta told him that he should not regard Siva as an ordinary deity. He is indeed thegreat soul, the lord of lords of all. Indra and other gods abide by his commands. TheSiddhas, the patriarchs, the sages and the serpent lords all follow suit.He is the overlord of Visnu and Brahma. He is both possessed and devoid of attributes.By a mere twitch of his knitted eyebrow everything is dissolved.Siva is the perfect form of gods, the cause of the annihilation of the worlds, the goal ofthe good, the destroyer of the wicked.

In the meantime Karttikeya and Ganesa the overall generals of the army,came near Siva joyously, fully equipped with weapons and ready for war.The lord of Danavas sent a leading Danava of great knowledge as his emissary to Siva.The Emissary asked what does Siva desire?Siva asked him to return Gods kingdom to them and stay in their kingdom happily and letthe gods stay in their region. He told him not to offend people and not to be malicious tothe gods.On saying this, Siva the great god, stopped. The emissary stood up and returned toSankhacuda.The emissary returned and mentioned the words of Siva, in detail and truthfully.On hearing that, the valorous Danava Sankhacuda accepted lovingly the alternative of afight.The mutual fight between the gods and the Danavas ensued. Both the hosts of the godsand the Danavas fought righteously. Elephants, horses, chariots and foot soldiers alongwith their drivers and riders were hit and split up.The arms, thighs, hands, hips, ears and feet were cut off. The banners, arrows, swords,coats of mail and excellent ornaments were slit and split. The earth shone with headsdivested of coronets but with earrings retained, strewn about and with thighs resemblingtrunks of elephants broken off during the tussle.The soldiers running in the battlefield saw several headless bodies that jumped with manyweapons lifted in their hands. Then Danavas defeated the gods, weapons and missileswounded their bodies.Returning to Siva, they sought refuge in him.Commanded by Siva, the great hero Karttikeya, son of Siva fought fearlessly with thehosts of Danavas in the battle.Clipping off their heads, Kali with eyes like a red lotus drank off the blood and devouredthe flesh rapidly. Seizing ten million elephants and an equal number of men with a singlehand she playfully thrust them into her mouth.The Danavas wounded in their bodies by the numerous arrows of Karttikeya fled infright.On seeing the wonderfully terrible fight of Karttikeya that caused wastage in the rank andfile of the Danavas like natural disasters, as well as the harassment and havoc wrought byMahamari, Sankhacuda became furious and himself got ready for the battle.He got into his excellent aerial chariot that contained different weapons and missiles, thatwas set in diamond and that encouraged and emboldened the heroes. Sankhacuda drewthe string of the bow up to his ear and discharged volleys of arrows from his seat in themiddle of the chariot.The gods Nandisvara and others fled.

Not making that spear, a gift ofBrahma, futile, Karttikeya fell on the ground.Taking him on her lap Kali brought him near Siva. By his divine sport and perfectwisdom Siva enlivened him.In the meantime the heroic Virabhadra of great strength fought with the powerfulSankhacuda in the battle.Going to the battleground, the goddess Kali roared likes a lion. On seeing Kali,Sankhacuda hastened to the battleground. Immediately the goddess hurled the Narayanamissile at him.The Danava Sankhacuda fell flat on the ground and bowed again and again.

He hurled the Vaisnava missile on Kali. She blocked itwith the Mahesvara missile.Then the infuriated goddess Kali, as fierce as the god of death on the battleground, tookup angrily the Pasupata sanctified by mantras.In order to prevent it from being hurled, an unembodied celestial voice said-“O goddess,do not hurl this missile angrily at Sankhacuda.” On hearing this, Bhadrakali did not hurlthe missile. She devoured ten million Danavas as if in hunger.The lord of Danavas hurled many divine missiles but before they reached her she brokethem into hundreds of pieces. The goddess then hit him with her fist forcefully andangrily. The king of Danavas whirled round and fainted for a short while.Immediately the Danava regained consciousness and got up valorously. He did not fighther with his arms by the thought that she was a woman like his mother. The goddessseized the Danava, whirled him again and again and tossed him up with great anger andvelocity.He got up and bowed down to Bhadrakali.Highly delighted thereafter, he got into a beautiful aerial chariot of exquisiteworkmanship set with gems and did not lose the balance of his mind in the battlefield.Bhadrakali drank the blood and devoured the flesh of many Danavas and went near Siva.She then narrated to him the events of the war in the proper order."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Shiva Mahimna53Siva, an expert in the knowledge of principles, went himself to the battle along with hisGanas.

While sporting on the eastern ridges of theMandara Mountain, Parvati sportively and playfully closed the eyes of Siva of fierceexploit. She closed the eyes with her lotus like hands, which had the luster of coral andgolden lotus.By this contact with lord Siva the rapturous rutting juice exuded from her hands becamehot by the fire of the eye on his forehead and flowed out in copious drops.Conception took place and a terrible inhuman being manifested itself. It was furious,ungrateful, blind, deformed and black in colour. It sang, cried, laughed, danced, put outhis tongue like a serpent and thundered fiercely.Parvati was surprised to see him and asked Siva that from where this child has come.Lord Siva told Parvati that when she closed his eyes, this being of wonderfully fiercemight was born of his sweat. He shall be named Andhaka.Siva told her that she was the cause of his creation though not in the natural way, hewould be guarded by the Ganas lovingly as well as by her friends.At that time, the Asura Hiranyaksa desired to obtain a son at the pressure of his wife whowas envious at the sight of many sons of her husband’s elder brother.He resorted to forest and performed penance for obtaining son.The trident bearing lord was pleased at his penance.Hiranyaksa requested to Lord Siva to give him a powerful son as his brother has five sonsof infinite valour, Prahlada being the eldest.On hearing these words of the king, the kindhearted Siva was satisfied and told him thathe cannot have a son born of his semen. Siva said that his son Andhaka has a prowessequal to yours. He cannot be defeated by any.

When he wasperforming penance, the gods accompanied by their forces defeated the Daityas andregained their lost seats.Brahma went to the hermitage of the Daitya Hiranyakasipu and told him to choose aboon.Hiranyakasipu requested the boon to be “Never may I have the fear of death fromweapons, missiles, thunderbolts, dry trees, mountains, water, fire and onslaught ofenemies- gods, Daityas, sages, Siddhas or in fact from any living being created by you.Let there be no death for me in heaven, on earth, in the day time, at night, from above orbelow.”On hearing these words of the Asura, the merciful lotus-born deity bowed to Visnumentally and granted him the boon and told him to stop his penance, which lasted forninety six thousand years.After getting the boon, Hiranyakasipu became inclined to destroy the three worlds.

She should be the rare in theworld, unapproachable to all men, bodily, mentally or verbally.

Whatever isseen, described or remembered is Siva’s form. Nothing other than that has real existence.Siva is worshiped by the gods, Asuras and human beings. The three worlds earth, patalaand heaven consisting of the gods, Asuras and human beings are pervaded by Siva in theform of linga image for the welfare of the worlds.In order to bless the world, Lord Siva assumes different linga forms here in the holycentres as well as in other places.Lord Siva incarnates in those places wherever he is devoutly remembered by thedevotees. After carrying out their task he stations himself there.He has assigned his linga form for the benefit of the worlds. The devotee attainsperfection by worshipping that form.There is no limit to the number of his linga images on the earth.On hearing the tales of Siva’s linga forms, a man gets rid of his sins instantly. The mostimportant is of the Jyotirlingas on hearing that a person becomes sinless.One who reads or recites the twelve names early in the morning is freed from all the sinsand attains the fruits of all Siddhis.The twelve Jyotirlingas are – Somanatha in Saurashtra, Mallikarjuna in Srisaila,Mahakala in Ujjayini, Parameswara in Omkara, Kedara on the Himavat, BhimaSankarain Dakini, Visvesa in Varanasi, Tryambaka on the bank of the Gautami, Vaidyanatha inthe cremation ground, Nagesa in the Daruka forest, Ramesa at Setubandha andGhusamesa at Sivalaya.Such excellent men will attain those desires for which they recite the names.

On securing the moon as their lord,those daughters shone extraordinarily. The moon too, on securing them shoneincessantly. Out of these twenty- seven wives, he did not love any one so much at anytime as he loved Rohini. The others became distressed and sought refuge in their father.After going to him they mentioned their misery to him. On hearing this, Daksha too wasstruck with grief.After requesting the moon, his son in law, thus, Daksha returned to his abode fullyassured. He requested moon to take care of his wives. The moon did not act according tohis advice being deluded by Siva’s Maya, which deludes the universe. Being subjected tothe force of destiny the moon did not accept his advice. Infatuated of Rohini, heneglected others. On hearing it, the skilful Daksha returned to the moon excessivelydistressed. He politely asked the moon to mend his ways.After repeated requests, the moon still did not listen to Daksha, he was then forced tocurse moon. Just as he cursed him, the moon contracted consumption within a trice.When he was wasted away there was a great hue and cry. The gods and the sages became"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"Shiva Mahimna65extremely agitated and felt miserable. Informed and implored by the moon, Indra andother gods, Vasistha and other sages sought refuge in Brahma and mentioned everythingto him. On hearing their words, Brahma was much surprised. Brahma said moon wasalways wicked and defiled. The wicked moon had committed many unholy deeds.The wicked moon went to Brahspati’s house and abducted his wife Tara. He then alliedhimself with the Daityas. Having sought refuge in the Daityas he fought against the godthough forbidden by Brahma and Atri. Then the moon restored Tara to Brahspati. Seeingher pregnant, Brahspati refused to take her back. Induced by Brahma, he accepted herunwillingly on the condition that she would caste off the fetus. When she was asked,whose child she bore in the womb, she replied that the fetus grew out of the seed of themoon. Only after the fetus was removed by Brahma, that he accepted her. Brahma saidthat moon could never improve.He then suggested the ways and means to be adopted. Moon was made to go theauspicious shrine at Prabhasa along with the gods. He was to propitiate Siva according toMrtyunjaya rites. He was to perform the penance incessantly sitting before the lord. Sivacould only cure him.The gods and the sages consoled Daksha and took the moon to Prabhasa. They invokedthe sacred waters of Saraswati and other rivers and performed the worship of the earthenlinga image in accordance with the Mrtyunjaya rites.The gods and the sages of pious mind left the moon at Prabhasa and joyously returned totheir abodes. The moon performed the penance incessantly for six months. He worshipedthe bull-bannered deity with the Mrtyunjaya mantra.The moon repeated the Mrtyunjaya mantra a hundred million times. He meditated on theLord Mrtyunjaya with his mind unruffled. Lord Siva, who is favorably disposed towardshis devotees, was pleased by his devotion and manifestation himself there spoke to him.Siva talked of his welfare. He was told to choose his boon, whatever he desired in hismind, he shall be granted. Moon was delighted and said that he did not want his body todecay by consumption.He told Siva to pardon his faults and be benevolent to him always. On this, Lord said thathis digit would decline day by day in one fortnight and increase steadily in another. Moonwas thus offered benedictory blessings by all the gods and sages. Moon then praise thelord with good devotion first in the Nirguna and then in the Saguna form.Siva was delighted with the gods. For increasing the glory and greatness of the region andthe moon, Siva stayed there in the name of Someswara. He became famous in the threeworlds. A pond was established there itself by all the gods. Siva and Brahma shared thattogether. It is famous as the moon’s pond on the earth. It is destructive of sins.The man who takes the bath there get rids of his sins. A pious man attains the fruit ofcircumambulating the earth, if he circumambulates Prabhasa. After death he is honored inheaven by gods. On seeing a Somalinga, a person is relieved of all sins. After enjoyingthe fruits as desired, he attains heaven after death.One who makes pilgrimage of this place attains the fruits of whatever he might have hadin view. On seeing the fruits of that high order, the sages and the gods bowed to Siva andtook the moon, freed from wastage. Thus moon resumed his former activity.Somesvara was thus originated. He who listens to this origin or narrates it to othersattains all desires and becomes rid of all sins.2. The origin of second Jyotirlinga Mallikarjuna"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"66Shiva MahimnaOn hearing the story of Mallikarjuna, the devotees become intelligent and rid of all sins.It is the story of Kumara. Kumara, the son of Siva and the powerful enemy of Tarakareturned to Kailasa, the celestial sage Narada came there and told him all the news suchas the marriage of Ganesvara and corrupted his mind. On hearing it, Kumara bowed tohis parents and went to the mountain Kraunca, though forbidden by his parents.Due to separation from her son, Parvati was distressed. Then Siva enlightened her sayingthat their son would certainly return. When Parvati could not be consoled, Siva sent thecelestial sages to Karttika. The gods and the sages accompanied by their attendants wentthere joyously to bring back Kumara. They went there and bowed to Kumara and madeseveral humble requests. Kumar did not care for the importunities of the gods and sages,intermingled with Siva’s behest. They returned back to Siva after bowing to Kumara.When he did not return both Parvati and Siva felt extremely miserable. Grief-stricken anddistressed following the conventions of the world, out of affection they went to the placewhere their son was. When Kumara came to know of the arrival of his parents, from thetop of the mountain, Kumara went thirty- six kilometers further out of disregard for theirlove. When he went further on to the Kraunca hill, Siva and Parvati stayed behindassuming the fiery form. Out of filial affection they used to visit Kumara on theconcluding day of every fortnight. Siva goes there on the Amavasya day and Parvati onthe Full moon day.From that day onwards that linga image of Siva born on Mallikarjuna became famous inthe three worlds. He who sees that linga image becomes rid of all sins and attains alldesires. His misery disappears. He obtains supreme happiness. He never suffers from thedistress of rebirth in mother’s womb. There is no doubt that he attains flourishing wealth,food grains, fame, health and the fruits of cherished desires. Thus the second Jyotirlingais the bestowed of happiness and the welfare to the world.3. The greatness of Jyotirlinga MahakalaThere is a beautiful city Avanti now known as Ujjain, yielding liberation to all souls. It isa favourite of Siva, highly meritorious and sanctifying. An excellent Brahmin Vedapriyaengrossed in the performance of auspicious rites lived there. He studies the Vedas andperformed the Vedic rites. The Brahmin maintained sacrificial fires. He was the devoteeof Siva.Everyday he worshipped the idol of Siva. The Brahmin Vedapriya was always interestedin acquiring perfect knowledge. After securing the fruits of holy rites he attained the goalof good. He had four sons like him. They were not inferior to the parents and also wereever engaged in the worship of Siva. The eldest was Devapriya. The next wasPriyamedhas. The third was Sukrta and the fourth was Dharmavahin of good rites.Because of the power of their merit, happiness increased on the earthen as the moonwaxes incessantly in the bright half of the month. Their good qualities also flourisheddelighting and pleasing all.There was a great Asura Dusana on the Ratnamala hill. He was very powerful. He wasthe king of the Daityas incessantly engaged in hating virtue and virtuous rites. Because ofthe grant of boons by Brahma, he considered the whole universe insignificant. The godswere defeated by him and ousted from their places and positions. He stopped whateverVedic rites were there in the shrines and holy centres. Dharma was exiled to a distantplace."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Shiva Mahimna67Asura also heard of the beautiful city “Avanti”. Accompanied by vast army, the AsuraDusana went there desiring to harm the Brahmins staying in the city. After reaching theplace, the great knave, hater of Brahmins called four hefty Daityas and told them that theBrahmins engaged in Vedic rites and rituals are worthy of being punished by him. If hecould defeat the gods and the kings, he could bring Brahmins under his control as well. Ifthe Brahmins wanted to live peacefully, they had to abandon the rites of Siva and therituals of Vedas. Otherwise they would be killed. On hearing this, the Brahmins were notat all distressed because they were engaged in meditating on Siva.The Brahmins did not even move a line’s breadth, since Siva was with them. On the otherhand, they overran the whole of the city. The people were harassed and they rushedagainst the Brahmins. People were tortured. The Brahmins believed that the generaldishonor and insult reflects on Him who supported them. Moreover nothing could happento Siva who was omnipotent. They believed that Lord Siva would protect them from theterror of the Asuras. Except Siva there was no other refuge.They continued to perform the worship of Siva’s earthen idol. They became firm in theirmeditation. On seeing them, Dusana wanted to kill them, but the Brahmins, the sons ofVedapriya engrossed in meditation on Siva did not hear the shouts. When the wickedDaitya tried to kill the Brahmins, the spot near the Parthiva idol caved in with a loudreport. Siva rose up assuming a hideous form from the chasm. He became famous asMahakala, the slayer of the wicked and the goal of the good.Mahakala was the great god of death risen up against the wicked like Dusana. After this,Siva reduced Dusana and his army to ashes immediately with a mere sound of Hum.Siva, the great soul, too killed Dusana and a portion of his army. Just as darkness isdispelled on seeing the sun, so also the army was destroyed on seeing Siva.After bowing to the benefactor of the worlds, the Brahmins joined their palms inreverence and eulogized him with different hymns. After consoling the Brahmins thedelighted Siva asked the Brahmins to choose the boons they wished. Brahmins asked forthe liberation from the ocean of worldly existence. They wanted to Siva to stay there forthe protection of the people.The Brahmins attained Salvation. The supporting base of Siva in the form of Lingaextended to three kilometers in each of the four directions. Siva became famous asMahakaleswara. On seeing the image. No one would have misery even in the dreams.4. The greatness of Jyotirlinga OmkaresvaraThe linga image of lord Siva named Paramesa manifested from Omkara.Once, the holy sage, Narada served with great devotion the linga form of Siva namedGokarna came to Vindhya, the lord of Mountains, other mountains with great honourduely worshiped him.Vindhya thought, everything was present in him. On knowing his arrogance, Narada, thedispeller of pride heaved a sigh and stayed there. On hearing this, Vindhya asked Naradato point out any deficiency in him. Narada said, he had everything in him but Meru wasloftier. Meru was classified among gods and he was not. On hearing this Vindhya wasdistressed.He decided to propitiate Siva and perform penance and sought refuge in Siva. He went tothe place where Omkara himself was present and made an earthen idol of Siva. Hepropitiated Siva for six months continuously and never moved from the place of penance.On seeing the penance of Vindhya, Siva, the delighted consort of Parvati, revealed to him"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"68Shiva Mahimnahis real form inaccessible even to the Yogins. Siva asked Vindhya for any wish since hewas delighted by his penance. Siva fulfilled the desires of all his devotees.Vindhya asked for such intellect so that he may achieve his objectives. Siva thought thatVindhya of deluded intellect desired for a boon capable of harassing others. He decidedto grant him a boon which being auspicious for him may not harass others. Siva thereforegranted him an excellent boon. The gods and the sages then requested Siva to stay thereand Siva stayed back with pleasure for the happiness of the worlds.The phallus image of Siva known as Omkara is twofold. In the Pranava, Sadasiva cameto be known as Omkara. What came out of the earthen idol became Paramesvara. Thegods and the sages performed his worship then. After propitiating the bull-bannereddeity, they attained many boons. Vindhya was much delighted. He realized his object andeschewed his despair.The one who worships Siva in this manner will not stay in the mother’s womb. He shallobtain all the fruits as desired.5. The greatness of Jyotirlinga KedareswaraThe incarnations of Vishnu – Nara and Narayana performed their penance in the BharataKhanda in the hermitage of Badarikasrama. Siva, being subservient to the devotees cameevery day to that earthen linga image.A long time elapsed while these two incarnations of Vishnu, the spiritual sons of Siva,performed the worship of Siva. On one occasion the delighted Siva told them that sincehe was delighted, they could choose their boons from him. On hearing this Nara andNarayana requested Siva to stay there in his own form and accept the devotion of hisdevotees. Thus lord Siva himself stayed there in Kedara on the Himavat in the form ofJyotirlinga.He was worshipped by them for helping the world and for appearing in the presence ofthe devotees. He destroyed their miseries and terrors. Siva himself stayed there in thename of Kedareswara. By his sight and worship he bestows the desires of the devotees.Since the residents of Badarikasrama derive their desires every day by worshipping him,he is called the bestower of the desires of his devotees ever.From that day onwards anyone who worships Kedaresvara with devotion, he will notsuffer distress even in dreams. It was he on seeing the Pandavas assumed the form ofbuffalo, having recourse to his magical skill and began to run away.When the Pandavas caught him he stood with his face bent down. They held his tail andimplored him again and again. He remained in that form in the name Bhaktavatsala. Hishead portion went and remained fixed in the city of Nayapala, famous as Pashupati Nathtemple of Kathmandu. The lord stood in that form there.Siva asked Pandavas to worship him in that trunk less form. Worshipped by them, Sivaremained there and granted boons. The Pandavas went away with joy after worshippinghim.There is a shrine of Kedara; the Indian people directly worship Siva. He who makes a giftof a ring or a bracelet after going there becomes a beloved of Siva. He comes very near inthe form of Siva. He is endowed with the form of Siva. On seeing that form of Siva, aperson gets rid of his sins. By going to Badri forest he becomes a living liberated soul.On seeing the forms of Nara, Narayana and Kedaresa, undoubtedly he can achieveliberation. The devotees of Kedaresa who die on the way are released from rebirth."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"Shiva Mahimna69Going there, with pleasure, worshiping Kedaresa and drinking the water, a person isreleased from re-birth. Therefore people in this country should worship with devotionNara-Narayaneswara and Kedaresa. Although he is the lord of the universe, still he isparticularly the lord of Bharata. There is no doubt that Siva Kedara is the bestower of alldesires.On hearing this narrative, the sins disappear at once.6. The greatness of Jyotirlinga – BhimeswaraOn hearing the greatness of Bhimeswara, a man obtains all desires. With a desire to blessthe world, Siva himself, the receptacle of welfare and happiness, took his incarnation inKamarupa.There was once a Raksasa of great virility named Bhima who harassed all living beingsand who spoiled virtuous rites always. The powerful demon was born of Karkati fromKumbhakarna. He took up residence on the Sahya Mountain along with his mother.When Rama killed Kumbhakarna, the terror of the worlds, the ogress remained on theSahya alone in the company of her son.Once the boy asked his mother about his father and why did they live without his father.The mother replied that his father was Kumbhakarna, the younger brother of Ravana whowas killed by Rama along with his brother. She further said that Kumbhakarna caught herforcefully and enjoyed her and left for Lanka. She had not visited Lanka yet.She was the daughter of Karkata and Puskasi and her husband Viradha was killed byRama. When her husband was killed, she stayed with her parents who were also reducesto ashes by a certain sage. When the sages were there for food, the infuriated disciple ofAgastya, the noble Sutiksna of good penance reduced them to ashes. That was the reasonwhy she lived alone on the mountain, miserable and helpless.It was during this period that Kumbhakarna; the younger brother of Ravana came thereand had his sexual intercourse with her. He went away leaving her alone. She further toldher son that she was living only for him.On hearing this Bhima, was angry and did not know what to do against Vishnu. Hepledged, that if he were the true son of his mother, he would surely harass Vishnu.Thinking thus, Bhima went to perform a great penance. With Brahma as the goal of hismeditation, he performed great penance for a thousand years. He kept his arm lifted upand stood on a single foot.He fixed his vision at the sun. Bhima the son of Kumbhakarna remained in that position.A terrible fiery splendour arose from his head. Scorched by it the gods sought refuge inBrahma. The gods including Indra bowed to Brahma with devotion and eulogized himwith different hymns and mentioned their miserable plight. The demon had risen toharass the worlds. They wanted Brahma to grant the boon to the wicked Raksasa in orderto protect them from the fiery splendour of Bhima.On hearing their words, Brahma told Bhima that he was delighted with him and wouldgrant a boon to him. Bhima further said that he wanted to be granted with unequalledstrength. The Raksasa acquired great strength from Brahma and returned to his house,puffed up with pride.He bowed to his mother and said that he would create havoc among the gods includingtheir chief Indra and also Vishnu who goes to help them. After this Bhima conquered thegods including Indra at the outset and ousted them from the respective positions. Later heconquered Vishnu and continued to conquer the earth."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"70Shiva MahimnaAt first he conquered Sudaksina, the king of Kamarupa, fighting a terrible battle withhim. Because of the power of Brahma and that of the boon, the Asura Bhima conqueredthat great king though he was a great hero and had the support of Siva. After conqueringthe lord of Kamarupa, Bhima bound him and stuck him. Bhima seized all that belongedto that King who was a servant of Siva, including his kingdom and its adjuncts.The virtuous king, favourite of Siva, was bound with fetters was imprisoned in anisolated cell. There the captive monarch made an excellent earthen idol of Siva andstarted its worship of earthen idols. He performed meditation duly in accordance with therules prescribed for the worship of earthen idols. He joyously worshipped Siva afterperforming obeisance, prayers and the like with the mystic signs and poses.He repeated japas of the five-syllabled mantra with the Pranava prefixed. He did not getany leisure to do anything else. The king’s beloved wife, famous as Daksina, performedthe worship of the earthen idol with pleasure.The couple, devoutly engaged in the propitiation of Siva worshipped the deity, thebenefactor of the devotees with single-mindedness. But the Raksasa deluded by thearrogance due to the boon spoiled all sacrificial rites saying the offerings should be madeto him. With a huge army of Raksasa he put the entire earth under his control.Defiling the Vedic rites and sacred rituals of Sastras, Smritis and Puranas, the powerfuldemon enjoyed everything himself. He harassed the gods including Indra. The sages weresubjected to misery; Brahmins were ousted from the world. Then all the dejected godsand sages including Indra, sought refuge in Siva, with Brahma and Vishnu at their head.On the auspicious banks of Mahakosi, they delighted Siva, the benefactor of the worldsafter eulogizing him with various prayers. They made the earthen idol and performedworship in accordance with the rules and eulogized him with different prayers andobeisance duly.Thus, Siva was delighted and spoke to the gods and granted them with boons. On this thegods said that he was the creator of the universe and knew everything in the minds ofothers. They told Siva that he was the immanent soul and there was nothing unknown tohim. They further told Lord that Raksasa, the powerful son of Karkati, begot byKumbhakarna, harasses the gods always, with his strength enhanced by the boon grantedby Brahma. They wanted Siva to kill the Raksasa who was the root cause of misery. Theywanted lord to be merciful.Thus requested by the gods, Siva favourably disposed to his devotees and promised toslay him. Siva said that the king of Kamarupa, the great king Sudakshina was hisexcellent devotee and so their requests shall be taken care by him.Siva said that he would kill Bhima, who was wicked, whose power was enhanced by theboon granted by Brahma. After hearing this gods were highly delighted and the sagesreturned to their respective abodes.7. The greatness of Visveswara, the arrival of Rudra at KasiVisveswara was the destructive of all sins. That which is seen as the substantive, as anentity in the form of knowledge and bliss, eternal and free from aberrations, desired for asecond. That second, of the tree of salvation, was possessed of attributes. It is namedSiva. That split itself into two, the male and the female forms. The male is known as Sivaand the female Sakti."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"Shiva Mahimna71The unseen Cit and Ananda created Prakriti and Purusa. On seeing their parents, Prakritiand Purusa were plunged in doubt. Then a voice aroused from the great attribute lessAtman – “Penance shall be pursued by them for the generation of excellent creation.Prakriti and Purusa replied to Siva that there was no place to sit and perform penance atHis behest. Then a beautiful city endowed with the requisite articles, auspicious essenceof brilliance extending to five Krosas, appeared, which was created and established bySiva, devoid of attributes, in the firmament near the Purusa.Occupying it with a desire for creation and meditating, Vishnu performed the penance fora long time.Due to his exertion, various currents of water began to flow. Vishnu liked the wonderfulsight. Then a jewel fell in front from the ear of the lord. It became a great holy centernamed Manikarnika. When the holy center extending to five krosas began to float on thewaters, Siva supported it on Trident, devoid of attributes. Vishnu slept there itself alonghis consort Prakriti. At the behest of Siva, Brahma was born of his umbilical lotus.At the behest of Siva, he evolved a wonderful creation. The fourteen worlds were createdin the Cosmic Egg, the extension of Cosmic Egg was fifty crore of Yojanas as glorifiedby the sages.Siva released the holy center of Pancakrosi so that the beings in the cosmic egg, bound byaction attain him. This Kasi is the bestower of auspiciousness in the world. It isdestructive of action. It illuminates salvation. It is the bestower of knowledge.The great Siva himself installs the linga image Avimukta. That holy center could neverbe abandoned; this was the blessing of lord Siva. After saying this, Siva himself broughtKasika from his Trident and released it in the mortal world. At the close of the day ofBrahma (when all other objects perish) it certainly would not perish.Siva upholds it by means of his Trident. When Brahma resumed the creation again, itwould be replaced. It is called Kasi because it pulls out or destroys our actions. The lingaimage Avimuktesvara stays in Kasi always, yielding salvation to the people includingeven the great sinners. Sarupya and other types of salvations are attained elsewhere.The excellent type of salvation Sayujya is attained there itself. Of those who do not attainsalvation anywhere, the city of Varanasi is the resort. The meritous holy centerPancakrosi is destructive of sins of crores of slaughter. The immortal gods too desiredeath there. Thus this holy center yields worldly pleasures and salvation always. It is afavourite resort of Siva. Brahma has praised this city. So also do the Siddhas, yogins,sages and also the other people in the three worlds and Vishnu too.The greatness of Kasi cannot be described in hundred years. The lord of Kailasa, who isSattvaic within and Tamasaic without, who is famous in the name of Kalagni and who isthe Supreme Being with and without attributes spoke after making many obeisance.Rudras wanted god to stay there for the benefit of the worlds. Avimukta, of suppressedand controlled soul, shed tears from his eyes and imploring him again and again spoke toSiva. He told Siva that he was the lord of all gods and three worlds. He was worth ofbeing worshipped by Brahma, Vishnu and others. They wanted lord to establish hiscapital in the city of Kasi and decided to stay in meditation for the sake of inconceivablepleasure.Avimukta said Siva was alone the bestower of liberation and worldly desires.

Thus requested"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"72Shiva Mahimnaby Visvanatha, Siva the sovereign ruler of all, stayed there for rendering help to people.Kasi became the most excellent center for all since Siva came to Kasi.8. The greatness of Gautama in the context of the greatness of TrymbakesvaraThere was once an excellent sage named Gautama. His wife Ahalya was extremelyvirtuous. He performed a penance extending to ten thousand years on the BrahmagiriMountain in the southern quarter. Once also a terrible drought lasting for a hundred yearsoccurred there. All the people were put to great distress.The sages, and other men, the beasts, birds and the deer of the forest went to the differentquarters. The sages and the Brahmins spent horrible time in meditation and performingPranayamas. Gautama himself performed an auspicious penance of Varuna for sixmonths engrossed in Pranayama.The Varuna then came there to grant him the boon since he was delighted with Gautama.Gautama then requested him for Rain. Varuna said that he could not countermand thebehest of the gods and requested to ask for some other wish. On hearing this, Gautamasaid if Varuna was happy with him and a wish had to be granted, then it had to beaccording to his desire. Since Varuna was the god of water, he could give them water.Requested thus by Gautama, Varuna told him to dig a ditch there. When this was said, hedug a ditch of hand’s depth. Varuna filled it with Divine water. Varuna told Gautama thatthere would be a perennial supply of water in that ditch that became sacred. That wouldbecome famous on the earth in his name.The rites performed there, sacrifices done; Sraddha offered all would be imperishable.Thus man attains fruits in accordance with the nature of the man one serves. Loftiness isachieved by serving the great and meanness by serving the mean. Service in the abode ofa lion is sure to yield pearls. This is the nature of the excellent people that they cannotbear other’s misery. They consider other’s misery their own and try to eradicate it. A kindman, a man unpuffed by arrogance, a person habitually helping others and a person withperfect control over his sense organs, these are the four holy pillars that support the earth.Having secured rare water, Gautama performed his routine and ceremonial rites duly.Different food grains and barley were produced in plenty there. Many beasts, birds andother living beings flocked there. The forest became very beautiful, the most excellent onthe surface of the world. The sages in the forest got engaged in auspicious rites. Theystayed there along with their disciples, children and womenfolk. They sowed food grainsfor their livelihood. There was great joy and bliss in that forest, all because of the powerof Gautama.9. The glory of Jyotirlinga VaidyanathesvaraRavana, the arrogant and prestige-minded leader of Raksasas propitiated Siva on theexcellent Mountain Kailasa. Thought the worship continued for a long time, Siva was notdelighted. Then Ravana performed another penance to delight Siva. The glorious Ravanadug a deep ditch among the groves of trees on the southern side of Himavat, theMountain that is usually the site of Siddhi. He then kindled fire within it. Near it heinstalled the idol of Siva and performed the sacrifice.He performed three types of penance. During the summers, he stationed himself in themidst of five fires, during the rainy days he lay on the bare ground and in the winter hestood within water and performed his penance. Even then, Siva, the supreme soul,difficult to be propitiated by the wicked was not delighted."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Shiva Mahimna73Then the ambitious Ravana, lord of Daityas, began to worship Siva by cutting off hisheads. In the due performance of his worship, he cut off his head one by one. When hehad cut off his nine heads and one head remained, the delighted Siva favorably disposedtowards his devotees, appeared in front of him. The lord reinstated the severed headswithout causing pain and conferred on him his desire as well as unequalled excellentstrength.Raksasa then joined his palms in reverence and asked Siva that he wanted to take hisimage to his Lanka. He wanted this desire to be fulfilled. On hearing this Siva toldRavana that he could take the linga image and wherever the linga image would be placedon the ground, it will become stationary.Thus warned by Siva, Ravana was taking the image to Lanka, when he was desirous ofpassing urine, while yet on his way, because of Siva’s Maya. Lord Ravana, of the familyof Pulastya could not stop this urge. He saw a cowherd there and requested him to holdthe image. About an hour later when Ravana returned, the cowherd had left after placingit on the ground. The cowherd was Vishnu who wanted to prevent Ravana from takingthe linga image to lankan. The linga image made of the essence of diamond remainedfixed there. That linga image is known as Vaidyanathesvara.It yields all the desires and dispels the sins at its very sight. It is famous in the threeworlds. It grants worldly pleasure and salvation thereafter. This Jyotirlinga is the mostexcellent of all. The sight and worship of this Jyotirlinga, destroys sins. Lord Siva stoodthere for the benefit of the worlds.Ravana returned back after securing the blissful boon. Brahma and other gods arrivedthere and devotedly performed the worship of Siva. The gods saw the deity personallyand after consecrating the image, they called Vaidyanatha. They then bowed to the imageand eulogized it and returned to heaven.On the other hand, after securing the great and excellent boon, the great Asura Ravanareturned to his abode and mentioned everything to his beloved wife.Ravana has blessings of Siva, on hearing the same; Indra and other gods and sagesbecame extremely dejected. The gods and sages said that Ravana was a wicked knave.Ravana was evil-minded and hater of gods and they thought that after receiving a boonfrom Siva, he would make their life miserable. This was the subject of worry among allthe gods and sages.Thus distressed, Indra and other gods and sages invited Narada and requested him to findout the means to dispel the grief of the gods. Narada then told them to give up theirsorrow and decided to visit to Ravana. Narada went to Ravana and told him that he was ablessed sage, a great devotee of Siva and was delighted to see him. Narada asked Ravanato narrate the details as to how he propitiated Siva.Ravana said that he performed a severe penance at Kailasa for a long time. When Sivawas not pleased still, he returned from there to the grove and resumed penance. Standingin the midst of five fires during the summer, lying on the bare ground during rains andstaying inside water during the winter, he performed three-fold penance.Still Siva was not even slightly pleased with him. He then became angry and dug a ditchin the ground and kindled fire and made earthen idols of Siva. He worshipped Siva withscents, sandal paste, and incense and food offerings. He propitiated Siva by obeisance,eulogies, songs, dances, musical instruments and mystic gestures of faces and fingersaccording to the rules laid down in the Sastras."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"74Shiva MahimnaWhen lord Siva was still not pleased and did not appear, he was distressed and could notobtain the fruits of penance. Then he thought of casting off his body into fire. Thereafterhe cut off his head one by one, purified them and offered them to fire. Thus he offerednine heads to Siva. When he was about to cut off his tenth head, Siva appeared beforehim as a mass of splendor.Siva was then delighted and asked him to wish for a boon. On this Ravana asked forunequal strength. Ravana’s heads were reinstated like a physician.His body regained its former state and all benefits were derived by him.On hearing this, Narada told Ravana, that he should not take all that was blessed by Sivafor granted. He told Ravana to lift up Kailasa and everything would come out to befruitful only if he lifted up the Kailasa and replace it as before and return back. Ravana,deluded by fate, considered it a beneficial advice. Believing in the advice of sage, hewent to Kailasa and lifted up the mountain. Every thing on the mountain became topsy-turvy and mixed up with one another.On seeing this, Siva said laughingly, that he had got the return of favoring his disciple.Lord Siva therefore considered Ravana as ungrateful. He cursed him for being arrogant ofhis strength and cursed him saying that a destroyer of his arrogance would come soon.The mighty Ravana, deluded of his own strength, destroyed the arrogance of his enemiesand brought the whole universe under his control. Due to the divine weapons and greatstrength secured at the behest of Siva, there was none to counter challenge Ravana infight.By listening to this glory of lord Vaidyanatha, the sinners get their sins reduced to ashes.10. The existence of Nageswara, the extremely excellent JyotirlingaThere was once an ogress Daruka who became arrogant by the boon granted by Parvati.Her husband Daruka was also very powerful. Along with many Raksasa, he tormentedthe good. He destroyed their sacrifices and spoiled their rites. His fertile and flourishingforest was on the shores of the Western ocean. It extended to sixteen Yojanas in everydirection.Wherever Daruka went in that forest for her sportive pleasure, the land in that spotacquired all requisites and became full of trees. The goddess had entrusted Daruka withthe supervision of that forest. Staying there, the raksasa Daruka and his wife Darukaterrorized the people. The harassed people sought the refuge in Aurva the great son Urvaand grand son of the famous sage Bhrgu.They paid homage to him in reverence and with their head bent down with pleasure; theyrequested him to grant them shelter, lest Daruka would kill them. They believed that hewas competent and brilliant with his splendor. He was the one in whom; they could seekrefuge and stay happy.The Raksasa’s run off on seeing Aurva. The splendor of Siva always shined in him likefire. Aurva said, if the Raksasa tortured the living beings on the earth, they would diethemselves although they were powerful. The truth remained, that whenever the peopleare killed, Raksasa’s too die. After promising this to the people, Aurva continued with thevarious types of penance, conferring happiness on the people.Realizing the cause for the curse, the gods made attempts to fight with the demons. Withmultifarious efforts and weapons, Indra and the other gods arrived there for the battle. Onseeing them, the Raksasas began to ponder since it was a difficult situation for them. The"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"Shiva Mahimna75Raksasas were fighting and dying but the gods continued to fight. A great misery hadbefallen the Raksasas.Raksasas started thinking of the ways and means they could protect themselves. Thedemoness Daruka then spoke of the boon granted to her by Parvati. The demoness saidthat they could go to the forest along with their people and make use of the boon grantedby Parvati since she secured it. The demoness further stated that they could take theirpeople to the island and stay there happily.On hearing the words of Raksasi, the Raksasa’s were delighted. They bowed to herrespectfully and asked for her permission to leave. They decided to stay in the waterspermanently. In the meantime, the people who had been tortured by the Raksasa’sformerly came there for fighting, accompanied by the gods.In their dilemma, Raksasa’s resorted to the boon granted by Parvati. They took theirbelongings to the city in the ocean. The demoness shouted cries of victory to the goddessand flew like the winged king of Mountains. She then stayed fearlessly in the middle ofthe ocean. Staying in the city inside the ocean, the sportive Raksasa’s became happy andfearless. They moved about in the waters only.They abducted the travelers in the boats and imprisoned them in the city. They evenkilled some of them. Staying there fearlessly, because of the boon granted by Parvati,Raksasas continued their havoc as before. People had the terror in the water instead ofland. Sometimes the Raksasas came out of their city in the water and blocked the path tothe land in order to harass the people. In the meantime several beautiful boats arrivedthere, all full of people. On seeing this, the wicked Raksasas were delighted and boundthem forcefully and fettered them and put them in prisons. The people thus becameunhappy.Their leader was a certain Vaisya named Supriya. His conduct was auspicious andpleasing to Siva. He was a permanent devotee of Siva. He never remained without theworship of Siva. Bhasma and Rudraksha were his ornaments. If on any day he could notworship Siva, he would not take his food. The Vaisya performed the worship of Siva inthe prison also. He taught the mantra of Siva and the mode of worshipping the earthenlinga image to several of his fellow – prisoners.They performed there the worship of Siva duly in the manner they saw and heard. Someof them stayed in meditation taking up excellent postures. Some of them joyouslyperformed the mental worship of Siva. Those who did not know the great rite remainedmeditating on Siva with the five-syllable mantra “Namah Sivaya”. Vaisya Supriyacontinued the worship of Siva by mental meditation for six months without anyhindrance.11. The greatness of RamesvaraFormerly Vishnu, the favorite of the good, took his incarnation as Rama on the earth.Rama’s wife Sita, the daughter of Janaka, was kidnapped by Ravana the wielder of greatMaya and taken to his abode in Lanka.Searching for her, Rama went to the city called Kiskindha. Having alliance with Sugrivafor his benefit, he killed Bali. After staying there for sometime, Rama held consultationswith Laksmana, Sugriva and others to find out about Sita. The Prince Rama sentMonkeys, the chief of whom was Hanuman, to various directions in order to find out Sita.On getting the crest-jewel of Sita, Rama came to know from monkeys that Sita was inLanka. Accompanied by Hanuman, the chief of monkeys, Laksmana, Sugriva and other"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"76Shiva Mahimnamonkey chiefs of great might and a vast army of monkeys, eighteen thousand billion innumber, Rama reached the shores of the Southern salt ocean.Reaching there, Rama, the favorite of Siva, stationed himself on the shore, being servedby monkeys and his brother, Laksmana. They had to cross the ocean knowing the factthat Raksasa of great strength and valour Ravana, up lifter of the Mountain Kailasa hadresorted to his strong hold in Lanka. His son was Indrajeet, the conqueror of Indra.Rama then told his brother Laksmana that he was desirous of having water and told himto get some water quickly through some monkeys. Monkeys got sweet, cool andrefreshing water for Rama. Just as Rama was about to have water, he realized that he hadnot yet had the sight of Siva and drinking water without his sight was not possible forhim.He then drank water and performed the worship of Siva’s earthen image. He worshippedSiva performing all the sixteen ancillary services like invocation etc. with devotionaccording to the rules. After propitiating him with obeisance, divine eulogies etc.strenuously, Rama joyously prayed to Siva with great devotion. Addressing Siva asBhavaratna (one who takes devotees across the ocean of worldly existence), Ramaexpressed that ocean was very deep and Raksasa Ravana was heroic and mighty.The army of monkeys was a very fickle instrument of war. He believed that it wasdifficult for him to achieve his tasks resulting in pleasing acquisition. He admitted thatwithout Siva’s help, his purpose was difficult to be achieved. Ravana too was hisdevotee. Ravana was invincible in every respect to everyone. He was haughty due toboons granted by Siva. Ravana was a great hero and conquered the three worlds.He begged to Sadasiva that he too was Siva’s slave and considering this Siva would notbe partial to him. After praying and bowing to Siva again and again, Rama shoutedloudly of victory and continued to eulogise Siva. Repeating the mantras and performingthe worship again and again, he danced before the lord. With the heart drenched withdevotional love, he produced the throat-sound.Lord Siva was much delighted. Assuming his pure form, lord Siva of brilliant formappeared before him immediately. Satisfied in his heart with Rama’s devotion, lord Sivatalked of Rama’s welfare and decided to grant him a boon too. Rama became sanctifiedand interested in Siva’s cult, performed the worship. Eulogizing in diverse ways andbowing to Siva joyously, Rama requested for his victory in the imminent fight withRavana.Delighted in his heart at Rama’s devotion, lord Siva granted him the boon. Securing theblessing of victory granted by Siva and receiving the permission of the lord, he prayedagain with palms joined in reverence and head bent down. Rama told Siva that if he werepleased, he would stay there to sanctify the world and render help to others. Thusimplored, Siva took up the linga image named Ramesvara, which is now famous on thesurface of the world. It was by Siva’s favour that Rama crossed the ocean soon, killedRavana and other Raksasa and regained his beloved Sita.The greatness of Ramesvara became wonderful and unequalled in the world. It yieldsworldly pleasures and salvation and bestows all desires on the devotees always. One whoperforms the ablution of Siva with the waters of the Divine Ganga and worshipsRamesvara with great devotion becomes a living liberated soul.

Ramesvara is thus divine. It destroys the sins of the devoteeswho listen to it.12. The origin and glory of Jyotirlinga GhusmesvaraThere is an excellent mountain in the southern region, named Deva. It shines with greatsplendor and is very wonderful to view. A Brahmin Sudharma, who was the mostexcellent among the knower of Brahman and who was born of Bharadvaja family livednear it. His beloved Sudeha was interested in Saiva’s cult and sacred rites.She was skilful in all household activities and devotedly served her husband. Theexcellent Brahmin Sudharma worshipped gods and guests. He was devotedly attached tothe Vedic path and scrupulously maintained the sacrificial fires. He had the brilliance ofthe Sun and performed Sandhya prayers thrice a day. He taught disciples and was anexpert in the Vedas and Sastras both.He had the qualities of gentlemanliness. He was also a liberal donor, a devotee of Siva, afavorite of his followers and engaged himself in the sacred rites of Siva-cult. A longperiod thus passed when he continued his religious rites but no son was born to him. Hedid not grieve over this because he realized the reality of different things. He knew thatthe soul was the up lifter and sanctifier of the soul. Thinking thus he did not feelaggrieved even mentally but Sudeha was distressed for not having a son.Everyday she used to implore her husband to strive for the acquisition of a son. On thishe used to tell his wife that there was no son, no daughter, no father, no mother, no lover,everyone was selfishly inclined in the world. After enlightening her, he continued withhis worship of the lord. He was perfectly contented.Once Sudeha went to the neighbor’s house for a friendly chat but a quarrel arose there.The neighbour’s wife as natural to women reproached her. She was called a sonlesswomen and that she had no son to inherit her wealth and property. They also told her thatthe king would confiscate her property. She narrated the story to her husband, but theintelligent Brahmin was not grieved by hearing it since he believed in destiny.She was pacified and consoled by her husband. She then told her husband if he did notbeget a son, she would caste off her body. On this, Sudharma, harassed by herimportunities, mentally remembered Siva. The alert Brahmin offered two flowers to thesacrificial fire. He thought that the right side flower would yield a son. Making thiscondition, he told his wife that she would have to take one of the flowers to decide aboutthe acquisition of a son.She was definite to have a son and waited for the insignia flower to come to her. She thenbowed to Siva and the sacrificial fire. After praying again, she picked up one of theflowers.She missed the insignia flower due to delusion caused by Siva’s desire. On seeing this,the husband sighed deeply and spoke to his beloved again. He told her to cast off her vainhopes and render service to lord. After saying so and giving up hope himself, theBrahmin became engaged in sacred rites and meditation on Siva.Yearning for a son, Sudeha did not leave off her pleadings. She then pleaded her husbandto remarry. Sudharma then told her that their miseries had gone off and requested her notto put obstacles in his holy rites. She then bought her sister and offered her to Sudharma.Sudharma told Sudeha that if her sister gave birth to a son, Sudeha would feel jealous ofher. Sudeha folded her hands to her husband and told her that she would not feel jealousof her own sister and requested him to marry her sister."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"78Shiva MahimnaSudeha served her sister like a hired wench eschewing all oppositions and lovinglynurtures her. The junior wife with the consent of her sister would make hundred and oneearthen idols everyday. According to the sacred rules Ghusma the younger sister rendereddevotional services to these images and threw them in the neighboring lake. She thenperformed the wish yielding worship of Siva everyday leaving them off and invokingthem again in accordance with the rules of devotional service.Performing the worship of Siva thus regularly, she completed a hundred thousand imagesand their worship, which would yield the benefits of all desires. By the mercy of Siva, ason was born to her. He was beautiful, fortunate and endowed with all auspiciousqualities. Sudeha then grew fiercely jealous of her. Her heart was cool and quiet beforeand began to blaze like fire later.The Spiritual Importance of Lord Bhavanatha and the Tale of Mrugi-KundDevarshi, the divine hermit, ‘Narada’ has recited the spiritual importance of the sacredGirnar mount and the tale of how lord Siva appeared there in the form of lord Bhavnathaone of the‘Jyotirlingas.’Sage Narada Says, Saurashtra is the best of all places in India, Girnar is the best of allforests. And also, the sacred place of ‘RadhaDamodar’ and ‘Suvarnarekha’ area is theholy of holiest as the trinity, Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesha resides here. ‘RadhaDamodarji’ – The creator of universe has deified this place in the form of “Giri Narayana”.Various Deities like Sri Dattatreya, DeviKalikai, DeviSaraswati, ‘Yaksha’ and‘Gandharva’ (half god half humans) have also made this sacred place their favored home.Elephant Foot, Gaumukhi, Ganga in this holy place is believed to have been originatedfrom the ‘Pataala’ (From the depths of the earth). As a promise given to Kartikeya Swami(son of Siva), Goddess Parvati also stays here at the summit of the Girnar, in the form ofAmbe-Mataji.Lord Siva has declared this place as the holy of holiest, as its being the favored home ofall these deities. Any person who performs ‘Shraddha’ (ritual performed for dead people)after taking bath in holy water with presenting offerings and meals to the priest certainlyfinds place in ‘Vaikuntha’ (home of ‘Vishnu’) after death.He who worships the almighty Bhavnatha Mahadeva with divine flowers and withchanting of ‘Om Namah Sivay’ – incantation, finds place at ‘Kailasa’ the sacred home ofLord Siva.In ancient times, at the end of the Brahma’s day, (One day of Brahma equals to million ofcenturies of humans) whole world was swept by ‘Pralaya’ (Destruction of the world) andwhen again it was Brahma’s dawn, the trinity of Brahma (Sattvik) the creator, Vishnu(Rajasik) the controller and Rudra (Tamasik) the destroyer, emerged out and startedliving in the Aadi-Satya loka of the world.Once in the Devasabha (Meeting of deities), a discussion was held on the process ofcreation and destruction of the world.Brahma obviously had a proud of his importance as a creator, so he cleared his egoisticstand in the meet by saying, “I am the father of every mobile (Chara) and immobile(Achara) creature. The world exists due to me”.Vishnu could not tolerate this and challenged Brahma that “I am the greatest of them ofall whole world will get destroyed, if I stop nourishing and supporting the creatures ofthis world”."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"Shiva Mahimna79As the dispute between Brahma and Vishnu became increasingly serious all other deitiesstarted thinking of ways to settle down the dispute, as otherwise, the process of creationand destruction of the world will get disrupted. Finally they decided to seek the shelter ofLord Siva. They worshiped ‘Mahadeva, listening to their prayers Lord Siva, gave hisappearance immediately and calmly advised to both Brahma and Vishnu that“Maheshwara has given birth to Vishnu and gave him the responsibility of nourishingand controlling the world. Similarly Brahma was produced by the Maheshwara to bearthe responsibility of creating the world.”“Lord Mahesha is called as the ‘Adya Maheshwara’ – the inceptor of this universe – as heis omni-present in this universe, and remains neutral to all such processes of the world.So better, we forget all such fruitless issues and duly carry the responsibilities conferredto us by the Lord Mahesha.”Divine voice of Lord Siva led Brahma and Vishnu realizing their errors. Both of themrepented much and apologized to Lord Siva, for their mistakes.Pleased by their modesty Lord Siva asked them for a ‘boon’. Brahma requested, LordSiva to appear in form of ‘Bhavnatha, the lord of the world, and thus, to establish hisimage as the creator.Lord Siva kindly gave his consent to the request of Brahma and departed towards the‘prithvi-loka’. While travelling on the earth Lord Siva entered into the sacred zone ofSaurashtra and saw the divine mountain, the ‘Revatachal Girnar’ and was instantlyattracted by its natural abundance and serene atmosphere. Lord Mahesha decided to stayforever at the base of the Revatachal Girnar – and sat there meditating.When goddess Parvati did not find the Maheshwara at Kailasa, she got filled with rage onother deities, to prevent Brahma from her curse, Indra and all other deities went in searchof lord Siva. They searched in whole universe, but failed to find Maheshwara’s traces,finally they sought the advice of Vishnu, who suggested to search with the help of Parvatiin the direction of Mahesha’s travel.All deities with Parvati arrived at Girnar and started searching in different directions onthe sacred mount. Parvati remained on the Girnar, Vishnu resided at Revatachal in formof Damodar ji and Indra found place in Indrachal. Brahma ji made his home onMuchkund mount. All other deities selected their own appropriate places surrounding theGirnar. Holy River Ganga also started her sacred flow on Girnar. All these deities startedpraying to Lord Siva to give the sacred appearance for the well being of the world.Melted by their urgings Lord Siva appeared on ‘Baisakhi Poornima’ in the form ofBhavnatha’ at the base of the Girnar.Brahma and all gods requested Maheshwara to return to ‘Kailasa,’ Lord Siva told themthat he has decided to stay at Girnar in the form of ‘Bhavnatha’ jyotirlinga and advised allof them to live there as their virtual incarnation forever.Narada, Brahma and all other deities worshipped lord Bhavnatha with Vedic rituals andsince then lord Siva is there in the form of ‘Bhavnatha’ blessing all the creative of theworld for their well being.All the sins of people get cremated when they go to the sacred Girnar and worship lordBhavnatha. And they all find place at ‘Kailasa’ forever. By worshipping lord Bhavnathaon ‘Mahashivratri’ with ‘Bilvapatra’ (the triclustered leaves) people attain salvation.All holy rivers are accumulated in Suvarnarekha River. Hence, bathing in holySuvarnarekha River, all sins of mortals get vanished and they attain salvation."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"80Shiva MahimnaOne should first pray to the ‘Kapildeva’, who gives success and then should worship‘Vastrapatheshwar’, the sacred land deity after drinking ‘Siddha Jal’, the Holy water,then should offer prayers to the ‘Chavan’ the kshetrapal Bhairava, situated in the south oftheVastrapatheshwar.On the bank of Suvarnarekha, there are some holy step wells named Buddhida.

Embodiment as Lakuli9.The Rudras10.The Climb to Power11.Shiva Takes Over12.Congregation of Faithfuls13.The Triad Is Established -Shiva Has To MarryRudra stands alone, the Only One, none other stands, no Second One;The Maker he, of all these worlds, controlling all with powers great,He stands with each, Protector too, and in the end he stands, reducing all.Shvetashvattara Upanishad, Chapter III Verse 2.Rudra's appearances and births were, in the main, over. The ground pattern of his nativityhad been laid out on the looms of Vedic and post-Vedic myth but a few more birth motifswere to embellish it as legend seized upon the growing concept of Rudra in Epic andPuranic times. The god at first appeared- and reappeared- if one is to accept his pre-Aryan existence, then took birth in ways that advanced his image and status.Rudra also showed himself in two or three other ways. He chose to manifest, to incarnateand to reveal aspects of his divine personality while he indulged in leela, the traditionalsport and pastime of the Hindu gods. Leela shows the gods in a playful mood. They putthemselves and others in curious situations and as these unravel, the deity providestantalizing glimpses of his nature and qualities.1.Leela, Pastime of the GodsThere is an element of mystery in all divine leela which keeps us guessing even while wegrasp what the god is trying to convey. The veil lifts but only partially. Leela is maya, theillusory nature of the world at play, providing lightning flashes of insight while the showis on."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"Shiva Mahimna81Learning should be fun, or alternatively, spell-binding. The Hindu always knew this. Thestory is a powerful means of communicating the eternal verities and the story-play ofleela was an established practice of the sages and celestials in their dealings with theuniverse.Shiva's Puranic births are instances of his leela, a hint at his deepening mystery. TheSkanda Purana tells how he was born of a drop of blood which oozed from Brahma'sforehead as he wiped the sweat off his brow. The creator had been bending over asacrificial fire, fanned into a blaze by self-glorification. It was a case of pride generatingits own fall, for in a well-known myth, Brahma's fifth head is snipped off with the tip ofShiva's little finger.In the Linga Purana, Shiva and Brahma get involved in a mutual regeneration episode.Brahma had just created mind-born sons and was not too pleased with his work.They were ascetics by choice. One them, Sanatkumara, had even wanted to remain fiveyears old forever so that the sins of the world, particularly carnal ones, would never affecthim. There seemed no hope for the regeneration of the human race. So Brahmaperformed severe penance, dwelling on the thought of Shiva. Pleased with theseattentions, Shiva emerged from his forehead saying, 'I am your son'. He then assumed thehalf-female (Ardhanari) from and burnt up Brahma in order to make him start afresh.Uniting with his female half, he then created birth Brahma and Vishnu. The son nowbecame the father, just as in a much earlier birth, he was the grandchild because he arosefrom the combined regenerative powers of Prajapati's four children, Fire, Wind, Sun andMoon. Establishing direct descent from him in more ways than one and also by siring theCreator, he was preparing for the unique role he was to play in creation- that of renewalafter destruction. What he ended never finished. It was destined to begin all over again.The births of Rudra, Brahma and Vishnu begin to get mutually triggered in a dizzyingmerry-go-round of birth myths. Indra, chief of the Vedic gods, whose powers were beingseroded while the triad was establishing itself as prime movers, was a close and interestedobserver of the process. He recorded their creative exchanges very succinctly, 'LordVishnu split his body into two and then created Brahma, who in turn created Rudra inanother kalpa (aeon), Vishnu created Brahma, then Brahma created Vishnu, then the lord(Shiva) created Brahma'.That was a regular round-robin of births sending the triad into a spin that ceased onlywhen the three had presumably begun to grant one another equal status. The spin-off,when this wheel of fortune stopped turning, was one of Rudra's most charming births.2.Ashtamurti, the Eightfold ManifestationBrahma, in a fit of divine dissatisfaction, ceased to create and went into deep and steadycontemplation. He merged his individuality with the Supreme Brahman, the Absolute. Heheld all his vital breaths and sat rock-still, conserving his energies, brimful of quietecstasy. The divine lotus which hung head down, in the center of his heart, filled out withthe creator's rarefied inhalation, and stood erect, facing upwards. It opened out andexpanded in fragrant welcome, ready to receive a new birth. Brahma then installed Shivain its very center on a miniscule pinpoint of pure bliss.3.Shiva ManifestsBrahma held him close, wrapped in the soul-stirring hum of the mystic syllable Om, tillShiva, sensing the need of the hour, chose to come out of Brahma's forehead. Brahma"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"82Shiva Mahimnagave him eight names. These linked him with the five elements and their relatedsensations, to the sun, the moon and to the sacrificer or the individual soul, jiva.Shiva stood, displaying all his eight forms with their emanating powers as Ashtamurti(the eight-formed). And is personified in an obvious image. It has the heaven as head, thequarters as ears; the sun, moon and fire as eyes; the sky as umbilicus. The winds blownetherworlds are his feet. He is clothed in the oceans and ornamented with theconstellations. Shiva is now the whole universe-outspread, upstanding and colossal.4.Panchamukha -the Fivefold ManifestationIn another manifestation he assumes five major forms through five successive aeons,beginning with the Shveta (white) Kalpa.The first was Sadyojata (Sudden One. White haired, clothed in white and wearing whitegarlands, even the blood that coursed through his veins was white. Next came Vamadeva(Beautiful God), red, with the aeon also taking its name from the prevailing warmredness-Lohita (red). Then followed the Pita (yellow) Kalpa, yellow through and through,when Shiva appeared as Tatpurusha (That Male). He wore tranquil yellow. Yellow gaveplace to black in the Krishna (black) Kalpa and he assumed a terrible form as the deadlyKala (Time), black and forbidding (bhora); but to those who knew and recognized him,the terror ceased to be and he became Aghore (not terrible)- which was the name of themanifestation in that kalpa. The last was Vishvarupa (universal form), crystal clear andtransparent, presiding supreme over the other four.Shiva anchored the form, drew it together and brought it down to earth with a simpledevice. He pronounced the four (excluding the Vishvarupa) to be his sons, andsimultaneously established them as the basis for human life, since the social normsproceeded in sets of four. These were the four castes - brahmachari (student), grihasta(householder), vanaprastha (forest-dweller) and sannyasi (ascetic); the four goals -dharma(duty), artha (wealth) kama (desire), moksha (liberation); the four groups of beings -egg-born, womb-born, seed born and sweat-born (insects). It was a neat summation, aconstruct that led simply and directly to Shiva as the source of life, its wellsprings.5.The Colours of LifeIn the Shiva Purana, the manifestation is mounted as a tableau and a processional, withadditional figures who act as props, extending the powerful aura of the deity. Shiva goesthrough each aeon, colouring it with his chosen hue, with a retinue to match.Brahma is the bystander, a divine medium, a receiver. He first ushered in Shiva asSadyojata, white and resplendent. The effect on Brahma himself was immediate. Hegenerated four sons, all white, unblemished, full of wisdom and valour. Sadyojata,pleased with his induction, blessed Brahma with the power to create well and wisely.The next aeon, was coloured red with the flush of Brahma's passion and from that wasborn a son, Vamadeva. Four beings clad in red, sons of a great sage, stood by,heightening the moment and celebrating it. Brahma was blessed with the wisdom and thepower to create in that aeon as well. Red turned to yellow with the onset of the PitaKalpa. Bahma clad in yellow, in a yogic trance, received Shiva as Tatpurusha. As Before,Brahma had four sons, also yellow, to match the protagonist. They were all inclined tothe yogic way of life.Yellow gave way to the menace of black in the next kalpa, as Aghora arrived, terrible tobehold but not fearful to those who could face him. Brahma, on this ominous occasion,"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"Shiva Mahimna83had four sons fitted out in black to harmonise with the aura of lustrous black that Shivaemanated.The last to arrive was Ishana, clear and transcendent. He appeared with his shakti,Sarasvati, speech. They created four sons. Ishana is the all-prevading Unmanifest, theSupreme Brahman who in this form, provides a glimpse of himself to Brahma and achosen few. It was symbolic colour-trail of Nature's tendencies. The translucence of awhite beginning breaks out into the vibrancy of red in action. That in turn, levels out tothe equipoise of yellow, before we reach the deadweight of black. Its downward pull intodeep descent is countered by the sheer up thrust of Ishana in transparent light ascent. It ishere that the veil lifts to reveal the Unmanifest. He is the closest we can get the SupremeBrahman.The five-form concept later took shape as the five faced Shiva with each given adirection- the dimension of space had been added to the dimension of time. Sadyojatafaced East; Vamadeva, North; Tatpurusha, West; Aghora, South. Ishana, also known asSadashiva, (Eternal Shiva) was allocated an upward direction. He was above and beyondthe four cardinal points. He is very often not represented in images, his presence beingtaken for granted as the intangible but powerful fifth head.6.The Rising Pillar of ShivaThese five forms were also linked to the five element and their related sensation. Thisramified, outspread form mapped a varied spiritual terrain with more than adequate sign-posting. In one of Vishnu's visions of Sadashiva in the Linga Purana, he constructs amental icon that puts all five together vertically, identifying them with the body of Shiva.This helps to uplift the spiritual aspirant and direct him, form by rising form, to the higherrealms of contemplation. Vishnu recalls, 'Shiva had Ishana for his crown, Tatpurusha forhis face, Aghora for his heart, Vamadeva for his sex organs, Sadyojata for his feet. Themetaphor had been gathered in and compacted, pressed into service as a manageablesymbol. It was the classic transformation of sound as mantra into form as icon. Shiva wasfast gaining round as an essential part of the triad. He was not just necessary, he wasvital, he made a difference. And he was just necessary, he was vital, he made adifference. And he was different.7.Shiva IncarnatesShiva did not incarnate in the way that Vishnu did - as towering, monolithic figures whoeither dominated the scene or single-handedly extricated the universe from the clutches ofa particular person or situation. Vishnu was a rescure, a saviour, a preserver.Shiva entered the scene when things were beyond repair. He was a destroyer and hisfunction was to end an aeon when it wound down and, to keep the spiritual fires burningthrough the ages.For that, he needed to appear in the company of enlightened souls and gurus who would,by precept and example, spread knowledge, mainly of Shiva. Shiva incarnated twenty-eight times in succession along with illustrious sons, pupils, sages and seers. They wereall, adepts at yoga, specially the Maheshwara Yoga, one of the Shaivite cults. This cultcould be the Pashupata Yoga attributed to Lakuli, a teacher who lived probably aroundthe second century B.C. the twenty-eighth incarnation, as mentioned in the Puranas, wasLakuli, led up to by twenty-seven others, each with his own caucus of learned beings."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"84Shiva Mahimna8. Embodiment as LakuliShiva's embodiment as Lakuli was unorthodox to say the least. He found and abandonedcorpse and entering it, emerged as young celibate holding a Vatara club, a lakula - hencethe name, lakuli. The place where this happened is in Gujarat and is called Kayavarohanaor Kayavatara (literally, descent into a body). Karnataka too, has a Lakuli with fourpupils. The Pashupata cult survives as a strong tradition and is marked by heterodox ritesand practices.The Lakuli incarnation is worth nothing only because of its association with a majorShiva cult and mentions Krishna and Vyasa as part of the core group. It could have beena counter-thrust to Krishna and the Bhagavad Gita, a parting of the ways of Hara (Vishnuand Shiva), leading to two distinct devotional schools.9.The RudrasAnother tradition includes the eleven chief Rudras among the twenty-eight incarnationsof Shiva. The Rudras are a class of beings whom Shiva seems to have either created, orcaused to be created under varying and conflicting conditions. In one myth, he willedthem into existence just before he went into a state of utter quiescence as Sthanu (pillar).Brahma rejected these creations of Rudra-myriads of them, all equal to Rudra andresembling him, superhuman and supernatual. They had sublimated their sexuality andspread all over, becoming part of the universe, its living and supernatural. They hadsublimated their sexuality and spread all over, becoming part of the universe, its livingrhythms, invisible but ever active. They seem to reflect one of the etymologies of theword Rudra- 'ever-moving'. Then eleven chief Rudras are sometimes included among thetwenty-eight incarnations of Shiva, and according to one tradition, these eleven Rudraswere the sons of the sage Kashyapa and his wife Aditi, mother of the gods. The ShivaPurana mentions the eleven Rudras sired by Kashyapa, father of the gods, throughSurabhi, the divine cow in a roundabout manner. Kashyapa worshipped Shiva at Kashiwith penance and austerities. Shiva appeared and promised to enter Surabhi. The Rudraswere born as a result and fought for the gods in one of their eternal clashes with thedemons.Yet another myth shows Brahma in a fit of disgust scrutinising his own revoltingcreations-ghosts, goblins, snakes. He decided to end his life. The eleven Rudras, anexpression of Shiva's mercy, emerged from Brahma's mouth as his vital breaths andrevived the desperate Creator. The Rudras are really manifestations, powers, insights, notregular incarnations.The Rudras have been given names in separate and slightly inconsistent lists. They were,as their generic name indicates, parts or particles of Rudra, complementing rather thanimitating him, and assisting him in the intervals between world dissolutions in themiscellaneous activities he chose to engage in.These incarnations of Shiva were perhaps, an attempt to match the Vaishnavite system ofsaviours and messiahs, for the Shiva Purana mentions a series of ten incarnationsbeginning with Mahakala, accompanied by their respective energies or shaktis.10.The Climb to PowerShiva had gone through life and manifestation alone. Only once, in a revelatory visionhad he provided Brahman and Vishnu with glimpses of his primal, female energy, hisshakti. He had confined his activities to the higher reaches of the cosmos, concentratingon evolving into a full-fledged deity with far-reaching powers. He had been identified"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"Shiva Mahimna85forces-and deities Fire, Air, Wind, Water, the Sun, Moon and stars. He moved quick aslightning, struck like the thunderbolt, and stormed into situation like a cloudburst,cleansing the air and making a clean and total sweep. He was the gathering storm ofancient skies in the mind of early man, with its recurrent rumbling mystery, the soundand howling fury signifying something other-than and beyond. He had already, in one ofhis births, taken up the bow of Indra, making its his own, but the real turning point in hiscarrier can be seen in two other myths.11.Shiva Takes OverIndra, Vayu and Agni sat exchanging notes on their recent war against the gods. Theyhad an unqualified victory and were gloating over their success. They had managed tobeat back the demons with no help - or so they thought. It was time to remind them of theSupreme Power whose functonaries they really were.As they sat discussing their exploits, they noticed a towering figure in the distance. Ayaksha (a powerful spirit of nature), was moving towards them with the majestic gait of alion. They quailed at the sight of him and what kind of power he exercised and Vayureplied, 'I lift things, I blow them away'. The yaksha threw a blade of grass in front ofhim. Vayu tried to blow it away, but could not even shift it. He went back chastened, butfull of wonder and curiousity and told the others. Agni tried next. He blazed and crackledand roared with all his might. The tiny blade of grass remained unscathed. Agni gave upand sent Indra- surely, as chief of the gods, he should be able to do something. Indrastrode up, full of confidence and asked him who he was. The yaksha vanished. In hisplace stood a radiant woman. 'Who was he? Indra asked her. 'The yaksha is invisible',was her reply, and then explained. 'I am the Prakriti (Nature Manifest) of that Purusha(Cosmic male) who is Yaksha. From him all beings originate - even the Cosmic Egg.'The gods were thus made to realise the power behind the throne that was Indra- theSupreme Shiva, Unborn and Unmanifest.In an even more expressive myth, Shiva disguised as an avadhuta (a naked ascetic), stoodin indra's path as he was on his way to see Shiva. 'Who are you?' Indra asked, looking athim with inborn arrogance. He did not see the inner radiance of the ascetic, his air ofcontained fire. The avadhuta said nothing. 'Is Shiva at home? Do you know?' Indra saidirritably. Again, the silence. This time the insolence was unmistakable.Indra kept repeating his questions only to be met with stubborn silence. He lost histemper. Raising his vajra (thunderbolt), he threatened to kill him if he did not reply. Thehand with the weapon, poised to strike, froze like a charmed serpent as the avadhuta'seyes blazed like a forest fire.Brihaspati, guru of the gods, who was with Indra, recognised Shiva and fell at his feet,begging for Indra's life. The third eye had begun to spark and flame. 'Spare him, O lord,your third eye is open blazing'. He made Indra fall at his feet, this is fire that oncereleased, even I cannot withdraw.' Brihaspati continued to plead and Shiva relented. 'Ishall throw it into the sea, so that Indra and the gods are not destroyed.' And Shiva,vanished. He had established his supremacy.12.Congregation of FaithfulsShiva had also gathered his own band of unswerving devotees- a prerequisite for everyestablished god. Upamanyu was one such. As a child he had gone to his wealthy uncle'shouse and tasted milk for the first time. When he returned he cried for milk. His motherpowdered some grain and mixing it with water, gave it to Upamanyu. The child was not"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"86Shiva Mahimnafooled and demanded the real thing. His mother could only advise him to worship Shiva,which he did. Shiva, disguised as Indra, came to test him and tried to divert his loyaltiesby deriding Shiva. Upamanyu was prepared to give up his penance for milk, was evenready to kill Indra to defend the honor of his beloved god. Shiva was pleased and blessedhim with the sight of a thousand milk oceans and other delectable waters besides- seas ofcurd, ghee, honey, sugracane juice, sweet and salt water- the seven oceans of myth. It wasthis same Upamanyu who became a great sage, learned in the ways of Shiva. It was hewho advised Krishna to go to Shiva when his wife Jambavati wanted a son.His most beloved devotee was Vishnu himself. In a puranic story, Vishnu worshippedhim with a thousand lotuses, one for each of Shiva's thousand names. One day, Shivaremoved a lotus. While offering the flowers, Vishnu missed the thousandth and last lotus.Without a moment's hesitation, he plucked out one of his own lotus eyes to replace it andreceived his discus, Sudarshana, as a rewardMarkandeya, son of Rishi Mrikandu was an exceptional child, destined to die at sixteen.He was a great Shiva devotee. When the messengers of Yama, the god of death, arrivedto take him, he clasped the linga he was worshipping and Shiva appeared, defeating Kala,Death as the irrevocable march of Time.Brahma was no devotee but was forced to acknowledge Shiva's superior powers. Theyrepresented antagonistic urges, destruction and creation, but functioned in unison asequally indispensable forces.13.The Triad Is Established -Shiva Has To MarryBrahma and Vishnu, with Shiva as the odd god in, had set up a workable world-systemThe system and Shiva, as part of the governing triad, would have to conform. He wouldhave to marry. The others had already done so. The perfect yogi and the perfect husband-only he could be both, for he was a god in whom incompatibles came to rest and resolvedinto positive forces. The early avenging archer was also the healer and renewer. TheCosmic Male had manifested as half-female, Ardhanari; the destroyer had embraced thePreserver in the Harihara form- and now, the unrelenting yogi was about to accommodatethe householder. Shiva's marriage took much arranging and considerable manipulation. Awhole conglomerate of inimical forces were to impel the god towards his goddess. Hewas probably legend's most reluctant husband.Some of the Thousand Names of SivaVisnu eulogized Siva with the thousand names, which Siva was prayed to andworshipped with lotuses.Siva – Pure,Hara – Destroyer,Mrda – Gracious,Rudra – Terrible,Puskara – Nourisher,Puspalocana – Of flowery eyes,Arthigamya –Accessible to the suppliants,Sadacara – Of noble conduct,Sarva –All-in-all,Mahesvara –Great Lord,Candrapida –With moon for the diadem,Candramauli –With moon for its crest-jewel,"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"Shiva Mahimna87Visva – Universe,Visvambharesvara – Lord of the earth,Vedantasarasandoha – The essence of Vedanta philosophy,Kapalin – With a skull in the hand,Nilalohita –Blue-blooded,Dhyanadhara – Object of meditation,Aparicchedya – Inexplicable,Gauribhartr – Husband of Gauri,Ganesvara – Lord of Ganas,Astamurti – Having eight cosmic bodies,Visvamurti –Universe-bodied,Trivarga – Bestower of virtue, wealth, and love,Sargasadhana – Achiever of creation,Jnanagamya – Accessible to perfect knowledge,Drdhaprajna – Of steady intellect,Devadeva –Lord of gods,Trilocana –Three-eyed,Vamadeva –Lovely god,Mahadeva – Great god,Patu – Efficient,Parivrdha – Chief,Drdha – Firm,Visvarupa – Multiformed,Virupaksa – Odd-eyed,Vagisa – Lord of speech,Surassattama – The most excellent god,Sarvapramanasamvadin – In whom all authorities and proof agree,Vrsanka – Bull-bannered,Vrsavahana – Bull-vehicled,Isa –Lord,Pinakin – Holding bow,Khatvangin – Holding missile Khatvanga,Citravesa – Of variegated dress.Meditate upon Siva each dayHe is lustrous like the snowy mountain.He is adorned by the beautiful moon.As pure as jewels and fire.He has fearful weapons.He is pleasing to the eyes.Seated on a lotus.He is dressed in tiger skins.The first in the universe.He is saluted by the whole universe.He is the remover of fear."}]
