[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Tantra Tantra is derived from the two Sanskrit words – Tanoti, meaning to expand, & Trayate, meaning to liberate. It is the Hindu science of expanding and liberating the soul. It encompasses almost all the spiritual practices of the Hindus – like Pooja, Stotra, Mantra, Yantra, Yoga, Meditation etc. Unfortunately quite a few people have projected Tantra as some kind of a witchcraft & medieval sexual ritual. So strong is this myth that today a tantrik is looked upon as the practitioner of some gruesome rituals to hook people for his advantage. Nothing is farther than the truth. The same goes with their interpretation of the word “Kama”. In Sanskrit the word “Kama” means desire – desires of all kinds like, hunger, thirst... to sex. But once again it is sensationalized by playing to the gallery by mentioning only sex. What is even more gruesome is that the various names of the Divine mother are sexyfied. Kamakshi becomes the sexy eyed Goddess and Kamaroopini becomes sexy looking Goddess! Tantra aims at enhancing each and every aspect of human life, because to attain liberation, one must become perfect. First one must perfect ones physical & mental faculties, and then learn to control them and sublimate them, and then convert and divert them to rise the soul to higher levels of spiritual progress. It enables you to perfect and control anger, hunger, thirst, hatred, ego, concentration, psychic faculties etc. It also teaches you to perfect and control sex, which is a part of our daily natural life. But to pick on this three letter word only and to project tantra as a four letter practice is ludicrous jocundity. As one raises higher in the spiritual ladder, one gets various siddhis or what are being described as “powers” like intuition, mind reading, healing, future gazing, mesmarising etc. At this stage some people get carried away and forget the main goal and succumb to displaying and using these powers to gain money & fame. Fully self realised gurus like Sivananda, Satyananda, Chinmayananda rise their disciples to their level but these semi-elevated fake “Gurus” stoop down to the level of their hankering disciples and their crash is imminent. There are a lot of ancient tantrik texts which give details of various principles and practises of tantra. The Yogini Hridaya, Sri Tripura Rahasya, The Todala Tantra (which gives the dasa mahavidyas of Kali, Tara, Sodashi (Tripurasundari), Bhuvaneshvari, Cchinnamasta, Bhairavi, Dhumavati, Bagalamukhi, Matangi and Kamala), Matrikabheda tantra, Devi Rahasya tantra, Vamakeswari tantra, Gandharva tantra, Mahanirvana tantra, Mantra Mahodadhi, Mantra Yoga Samhita, Mantra Maharnava, Mantra Muktavalîi, Mantra Kaumudi, Tattvananda Tarangini, Yogini Tantra, Gupta Sadhana Tantra, Devirahasyam are just some of the important works in tantra. The Soundarya Lahari by Adi Shankara also has a special place in tantra.

Unfortunately many people think that Tantra is something negative – like witchcraft or black magic etc. That is not the case. Tantra is a great ancient science by which a Deity is ritualistically worshipped with Tantrik mantras and Havan to attain a specific goal for a specific person. In fact 95% of the time Tantra is used to ward off the negative influences and to get good results. The Atharva Veda is full of Tantric mantras and many Tantric texts like Mantra Mahodadhi give details of these practices. The Vedic Poojas are like a wonderful health tonic to improve your life; where as the Tantrik Poojas are like a powerful injection to remove a specific infection and to boost a desired objective. Not everyone can master Tantra. To get proper Siddhi of Tantrik Pujas one needs – firstly an expert Tantric Guru, secondly very rigorous training in the rituals and thirdly a strictly righteous life.

Tantrik practices for you Tantra originated from Shiva and Shakti, the two supreme cosmic forces of creation and dissolution. Tantrik practices give quick results and are highly effective. However they must be practiced under the guidance of an expert guru. If not performed properly without expert guidance, quite a few of them can have negative side effects. The repercussions of provoking and playing with the highest forces can be devastating at times. However all tantrik practices are not dangerous. There are several which are quite safe and can be practiced by the common man to get positive results. We are giving bellow a few which you can practice with out any fears. The minimum rules to be observed 1. Worship only after taking bath and wearing clean clothes. 2. Sit facing the East or North. 3. Sit on an asan of Deer Skin, Silk, Woolen or Cotton. Avoid synthetic material. 4. Light a lamp and offer some prasad – even milk or sugar will do. 5. Ladies must avoid the worship during the menstrual period. 6. Never do the worship with any negative sankalpa (purpose) like harming your enemies or to bewitch a woman etc."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"7. Before you start the worship, offer a prayer to Ganesha, Guru and Saraswati Vandana trayee in text In the orthodox Hindu tradition, before starting anything one salutes one’s Guru, Ganesha and Saraswati. These three salutations are called Vandana Trayee. The three short salutations with beeja mantras are as follows: For Guru: Om Gum Gurubhyo Namah For Ganesha: Om Gam Gloum Ganapataye Namah For Saraswati: Om Aim Kleeng Sauh Saraswatiyai Namaha The Vandana Trayee in verses form as follows: Guru: “Gurur Brahma gurur Vishnu gurur devo Maheswarah Gurur sakshat parambrahmah tasmi sri gurave namah” (For those who do not have a guru add the following verse for Guru Dakshinamoorti, i.e., Lord Shiva in his incarnation as the Guru of the world Nidhaye sarva vidyanam bhishaje bhava roginam Gurave sarvalokanam Dakshinamoortaye namah) Ganesha: “Om Gananam twa ganpati gum havamahe Kavimkavina mupamashravastarm Jyestharajam Brahmanam Brahmanaspata aanas-shrunvotibhi-seedhasadhanam Maha Ganapataye Namah” May we worship Ganapati, the Protector of Noble People The best Poet, the Most Honourable, The Greatest Ruler and the treasure of all knowledge O Ganapati, please listen to us and take your seat in our heart.

Salutations to the Goddess of speech.” As a guide for those who want to know the correct way of pronouncing and reciting these Vedic stotras, I have recorded MP3 stotras. For each stotra I have bought and listened to 3-4 versions available in the market and recorded the best as per my judgment. Khadgamala There are many types and levels of worship of the Devi(s) of the Sri Chakra. The Khadgamala is the simplest way. It is simply reciting the names of all the Devis of the Sri Chakra.

Mahashodha Nyasa Nyasa or touching the various parts of the body with mantras is an integral part of Tantra. Various types of worships have different nyasas & mantras. Apart from the Tantrik significance, the touching of the various parts of the body activates and purifies the various nadis or nerve centers of the body. The Maha-shodhanyasa is a highly effective one and it is said that if you perform it even without knowing the significance, it bestows a lot of spiritual benifits. The Sodha Nyasa (sixfold nyasa), which is part of the daily worship of Tripurasundari, is here for the first time translated into English, from the work called Nityotsava, itself a commentary on the famous Kalpasutras of Parashuram. Parashurama was a brahmana initiated by Lord Dattatreya into the worship of Shri Shri Mahatripurasundari Lalita Devi. The Kalpasutras provides a compendium for the worship of that Devi. Various forms of nyasa, which means ‘placing’, enter into this and all other forms of tantrika puja. The dialogue between Parashuram and Dattatreya is contained in the Tripura Rahasya, a wonderful work which is available in an English translation published by the Sri Ramana Ashram in Tiruvannamalai. The Sodha Nyasa in which Devi outspreads as Ganeshas, planets, 27 nakshatras (asterisms), yoginis of the seven dhatus or bodily elements of ayurveda, sidereal zodiac, and sacred sites (pithas) is described in very many agamas such as Vamakeshvara Tantra, Gandharva Tantra, Jnanarnava, The 1,000 Names of Lalita, etc.. It is described in detail in the Yogini Hridaya, itself said to form the latter part of the Vamakeshvara Tantra. The ritual centres the worshipper as one with She whose true nature is Chit or Consciousness Shakti. She is triple in Her manifestation as the three gunas — represented by Her three Saktis of Iccha (will), Jnana (knowledge), and Kriya (action) — and rays out as the 15 Nityas or Eternities who express the phases of the Moon or Candrakalas, and form the body of time. According to the tradition, Shiva, without characteristics is awareness. And Shiva is one with Shakti. Her parts as represented by the Shodha Nyasa amount to 156, and comprise all visible manifestation. She is Maya Shakti, the Matrika or letters of the alphabet Devi, the heap of words and letters which delude men and women, and also those letters transformed by awareness into mantra. Her yantra is the Shri Chakra, which contains all letters within its heap of petals, lotuses and lines. This yantra, which is a diagrammatic representation of the human body, is within the wheel of time. Worship via this ritual is intended to assist a sadhvini or sadhaka to realise her or his oneness with the Shakti, with the yantra, and with time itself in all its manifestations."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Mahashodha Nyasa In this wonderful abbreviated six way nyasa, obeisance to Dakshinamurti, the Rishi, on the head; to the metre Gayatri in the mouth; to the Devi Mahatripurasundari, to Ganeshas, Planets, (27) Sidereal Constellations, Yoginis, 12 Rashis, the Sacred Sites (pithas) in the heart; obeisance to the application of this Shri Vidya limb nyasa, in the palm of the hand.
