As always, when Swami Muktananda came in the room, every-body's foreheads immediately hit the floor, and that day was no exception. Mine was on the floor immediately. The first thing Muktananda did in looking around the room while I was on the floor was to note there was a book on the bed. He asked me what it was. I told him, and he said, '\"Don't read that; read Kashmir Saivism.\" And that began my decades-long interest in the study of what is now cal led Sakta-Saivism. One of the great deficiencies that those of us who have an inter-est in Saivism have suffered under is the absence of qualified scholars who are willing to engage in translation projects. The Buddhists are fortunate enough to have living traditions-esoteric Saivism lost its last living lineage holder with the passing of Swami Lakshman Joo-and a great deal of reserve of both cultural and financial capital in the organizations that promote Vajrayana Buddhism, and none of this has existed in support of those of us who have great interest in esoteric Saivism. Because of that, I have caused many different works to become translated. This particular project has been going on so long, I can't even remember when it started. After Swami Muktananda passed away, I began visiting Swami Lakshman Joo in Srinagar. I was never really able to stay there long enough to really study with him or to consider myself a student of his, hut I was and am a great admirer VII"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"VIII PREFACE of him. His blending of intellectual development and a uniquely human quality of compassion was really extraordinary. and he was an extremely beautiful person. Sometime in the early 1990s, how-ever, it became too difficult to go to Kashmir, because of the poli-tics of the place. Still intent on continuing my reading and study of Kashmir Saivism, and having met all the Kashmiri pandits, I went to Benares to meet Pandit H.N. Chakravarty. In doing so, I also met many of the people associated with him in Benares, such as Bettina Baumer and Pandit Kamalakar Mishra, whose work on Kashmir Saivism I published more than a decade ago. At the time I met Pandit Chakravarty, I requested him to translate the Tan-trasara into English, and he agreed. And so we launched on the project, and it was a couple of years later that he delivered a manu-script which, in fact, was absolutely unreadable. While his knowl-edge of Saivism was deep, his English was extremely limited, and there was really nothing I could do about the publication of the manuscript; it was just impossible. So it languished for years, until th~re was pressure from Chakravarty's side and from some of his fnends in Canada for us to do something about the manuscript. What eventually came about was that Boris Marjanovic took on the project, and it was really his effort to bring a readable English translation of the Tantrasara out that has given renewed 1 i fe to this pr?ject and ultimately brought it to the extremely fine state that it IS Ill. Boris Marjanovic deserves an enormous amount of credit for the existence of this manuscript in the quality that it is. I am grate-ful to Pandit H.N. Chakravarty and to all of his friends, including Bettina Baumer, for her support, and I am especially grateful to Boris Marjanovic.

The TA is Abhinavagupta's most extensive work on the principles of nondual Saiva doctrines written in verse, while the TS, which is its sum-mary, is significantly shorter and written in prose. It was the tradition of some of the ancient pandits belonging to different schools of Indian thought to write brief and simpli-fied versions of the main principles and doctrines of their schools. The purpose of this practice was to provide those interested in the subject but unable to devote years of study to Sanskrit grammar and logic, deemed prerequisites for the study of any other branch of learning, with a simplified and comprehensible overview of the main principles of their respective schools. Abhinavagupta and his disciple K~emaraja wholeheartedly embraced this practice. As early as the second benedictory verse of the TS, Abhinavagupta declares the complexity, vastness, and depth of the topics dis-cussed in the TA as the main reason for writing its short version. The primary aim of the TS is to make knowledge easily acces-sible; thus, Abhinavagupta avoids getting into complex and lengthy philosophical arguments and elaboration, and lays out the subject matter smoothly and concisely. For us, on the other hand, who are attempting to study and to understand this text a millennium later, the brevity of the style of the TS presents a significant chal-lenge. Furthermore, the Sanskrit used by Abhinavagupta in the TS is not easy, and the notions and practices found in it are obscure lX"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"x FOREWORD and sometimes incomprehensible. It is because of these difficulties that this text remains inaccessible not only to the general public but also to Sanskrit scholars and Indologists whose specialty is outside of Tantric studies. However, it should be pointed out here that a reader at the time of Abhinavagupta would have experi-enced significantly less difficulty in understanding this text than we are experiencing today, especially when it comes to ritual prac-tices and observances. The reason for this is that the tradition was alive and its teaching and practices were widespread and therefore understandable to those interested in learning them. For example, in Chapter Sixteen, Abhinavagupta speaks of the application of the net Ualaprayoga), the procedure by which the initiator catches the departed souls during the ritual of ini-tiation. There he explains that these departed souls, for one rea-son or another, hadn't received initiation before their death but deserved to be initiated because of their service to the teacher or some other devout activity. It is the command of Siva, Abhi-navagupta further clarifies, that the teacher, through the appl ica-tion of the net, should bring a departed soul to enter the figure of ku, a grass that represents a departed devotee, and then per-form the initiation procedure. This knowledge, according to Abhi-navagupta's own admission, was transmitted to him orally by his teacher Sambhunatha. It is difficult to fully comprehend from the available sources what the nature, method, and application of this practice were. It seems clear, however, that the power of the deep meditation of the teacher was believed to be the deciding factor for the success of the entire process. As already pointed out, the brevity of the style of the TS pre-sents a serious difficulty in understanding this text. Fortunately, these doctrines are often discussed at length by the same author in his TA as well as in his other works. The translator then is required to read the TA along with the TS if intent on grasping the meaning and wider context of topics discussed. Thus, the TA and the TS complement each other, although on rare occasions the translator is fortunate to find additional information or explana-"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"FOREWORD XI tions in the TS itself that were left out and not elaborated on in the TA. This conforms to the style of Abhinavagupa that he adopted from his teacher Sambhunatha, which was not to keep knowledge completely hidden but also not to reveal it all at one place or in a single book. This. of course, is meant to provide necessary prac-tice for students as well as to test their devotion to knowledge. Finally. Abhinavagupta refers to a number of Tantric and other texts that are now lost to us. including the Bhairavakulormi Tan-tra, Nityti Tantra, Paramesvaranuttara Tantra, Tantrasadbhtiva Tantra, Yogasmhctira, and other texts which have clearly influ-enced his thought. Fortunately, in recent years some of these texts, such as Tantrasadbhtiva Tantra.were edited and made available to scholars. My association with Pandit Chakravarty goes back to 1997. At that time I lived in Varanasi with the intention of reading Sanskrit texts with Prof. Shri Narayana Mishra. Shri Narayana Mishra was the first and the most important of my teachers during the time I worked on my Ph.D. thesis and other projects. It is because of his selfless teaching style that I learned how to read and understand stistric texts. As I was primarily interested in Kashmiri Saiva philosophy and practices, I began to visit the home of Pandit Chakravarty. a renowned Tantric scholar with profound understanding of Kash-miri Saivism. His recognition as a scholar was derived from his 1 i felong study of Sanskrit and its philosophy. but more than that, his recognition came from his close association with Mahamaho-padhyaya Gopinath Kaviraj. During one of many conversations that we had. I found out that in addition to already publishing his translation of the TS in Hindi, he had also completed the Eng-lish translation of the same text. Furthermore. he told me that he had suhm itted the manuscript for publication to Rud ra Press many years ago. However. for reasons unknown to him. the publication of his work had never taken place. It was only several years later when I met Sharon Ward. the head of Rudra Press at that time. that I learned the reason: She explained to me that they felt that"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"XII TANTRASARA the translation was in need of a good editor, which, because of the complexity of the text, they were unable to provide. It was then that she suggested that I work together with Pandit Chakravarty and help him put the translation of the TS into English that would be understandable to a wider audience. When we began to work together in the summer of 2004, I soon discovered that the problem with Pandit Chakravarty's English translation was not the lack of knowledge of the English language on his part but his desire and insistence on I iteral translations. Thus, his English translation preserved the syntax of Sanskrit sen-tences, which, combined with the obscurity of the text, resulted in English sentences that were incomprehensible. We spent the next two years going carefully through the text sentence by sen-tence. In addition to helping him to express the Sanskrit text in simple and easily understandable English sentences I have written explanatory note for Chapters Twelve through Twenty-Two as well as several notes for Chapter Nine. Generally speaking, the problem with reading translations of Sanskrit philosophical texts is that a reader is usually unfamil-iar with the style and technical terminology used by the ancient Sanskrit authors. Sanskrit philosophical literature is specialized literature, the understanding of which requires training. Thus, the readers of this translation might find it difficult to grasp the mean-ing of some parts of this text. In order to overcome this problem, Pandit Chakravarty conveniently summarized each chapter of TS and included it in his Introduction. I strongly recommend that any-one who makes the effort to study this text in depth first carefully read his Introduction. Boris Marjanovic Los Angeles December 18, 2011"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Introduction Chapter One The Tantrasara begins by stating that perfect knowledge (pflr~ia­pratha) is the cause of liberation. It is the revelation of Siva-nature in one's own Self. Siva, who by His power of freedom (svatantrya sakti) appears to be limited in knowledge and action, removes all veils by the same power. As a result of this, He shines in His pris-tine, self-refulgent, pure consciousness. On the dawn of supreme knowledge of the nature of light (prakasa), marked by reflective self-knowledge (vimarsa), everything shines nondifferently in the mirror of consciousness. While describing the nature of mok~a, Abhinavagupta writes in the Paramartha-sara that there is no separate region of it, nor is one to proceed toward it, but it is to be realized by piercing the knots of ignorance by virtue of the full development of one's own power of freedom. However. mok~a should not be taken as the effect of knowledge (j1za11a) and the lat-ter the cause of it, but as the manifestation of the real nature of the Self (atman). According to this Savadvaya system, ignorance is accepted as the cause of salizsara, yet the nature of ajiiana is known as a~wva ma/a, a limitation innate in the individual. It originates from the absolute freedom of the Lord. The a~zavamala operates in the indi-vidual soul in two ways: (i) the loss to consciousness of its free-dom, and (ii) the sense of agency without bodha. This limitation of j11a11a and kriya is known as spiritual (paun1~a) and intellectual/ scriptural (bauddha) ignorance (ajiiana). Ignorance, known as bauddha ajiiana. is of the nature of inde-termination (aniscayasvablzavam) and determination of contradic-"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"2 TANTRASARA tory nature (viparltanifraya). Because of the presence of the first, the individual soul in bondage fails to definitely know the real nature of the Self, and because of the second one, experiences and feels himself to be the experiencing subject of what is really non-self, such as: body, intellect, prarza, etc. Pauru~a ajiiana, characterized by limited knowledge brought into existence by til}avamala, is considered by Abhinavagupta and his tradition to be the cause of worldly existence. Pauru~a ajfiana can be removed by initiation (dlk~a), but a person cannot avail himself of it while the impurity known as bauddha ajfiana lying in his intellect remains. This is because initiation is necessarily preceded by the firm conviction regard-ing right knowledge of the things to be avoided, and right knowl-edge of the things to be accepted (heyopadeyaniscaya). Right knowledge can only be obtained from the sacred literature (sastra) taught by Paramesvara. He is the highest authority and origin of all sacred literatures. These revealed texts are the givers of release to the souls in bondage. The number of the revealed texts known as agamas are ten, eighteen, and sixty-four. For Abhinavagupta, the essence of them is the Trika system, and the most important of them is the Malinlvijaya Tantra. Abhinavagupta writes that he will give an exposition of the 1:f a!inlvijaya, for he argues that unless the real nature of things Is determined, one will be unable to attain liberation. It is pure knowled~e alone that possesses the quality of bestowing relea~e. The highest principle, which is of the nature of light, is Siva. He, the most desirable of all, is one's own unique nature (sva-~hava). Light (prakasa) is pure consciousness, which is the very hfe of everything; though shining in all, it shines as blue and jar distinctly, separate from each other. This notion of separateness, the knowledge of duality, is considered to be ajfiana, but pure consciousness (caitanya) is really knowledge (jnana). It is uni-versal (sarvasamanya). It is present everywhere, and possesses absolute freedom of wisdom and activity (jiianakriytivan). The non-shining of this universal light to the person who is limited is the primary ignorance of the Self."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 3 The light of which we have spoken above is independent. Its independence means that it depends on nothing. It is all-encom-passing, eternal, has the nature of assuming all forms, and at the same time it is without any form (sarvakaranirakara svabhava). Its absolute freedom is the \"power of bliss\" (ananda sakti), the relish of one's own bliss (ananda) is iccha sakti, its self-reflective light is j11anasakti, its unifying relation with all is kriyasakti. Siva, though associated with all His principal saktis, always remains free from limitations and rests in His blissful nature. When, by His absolute freedom of will, He manifests Himself as limited, He is then known as the bonded soul or limited know-ing subject (a~zu). Then, as a result of self-recognition, He again shines as Siva, marked by absolute freedom and unlimited light. By virtue of His absolute freedom, He either shines without any means (anupaya) or sometimes with means (upaya). These upayas, the ways of absorption of the individual consciousness into the divine, may be of the nature of iccha, jiiana, or kriya. These ice ha, jiia na, and kriya are the saktis of Siva. When a yo gin is able to grasp any of them, it becomes easy for him to attain Siva. As the means (upaya) are three, so the forms of absorption (samavesa) are also three; hence they are known as sambhava, sakta, and a~zava samavesas. This, in short, is the summary of the first chapter of the Tan-trasara. Chapter Two The second chapter begins with a brief presentation of anupaya. Anupaya is not counted under any upaya on account of its subtlety, and even more, because the person on whom the most intense descent of grace (saktipata) has fallen does not have any need for internal or external help in order to realize his identity with Siva. The word of the teacher, heard only once, places him on the tran-scendent path (anuttarapatha), the stable ground of the blissful nature of Sakti, upon which he at once realizes the self-manifest Lord as his own very Self."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"4 TANTRASARA Siva is eternal; therefore there is no possibility of realizing Him by any means (upaya). As He is self-manifest, the means can-not add anything to Him. If it is said that some means would assist in the removal of the veils, then this is untenable, for there is no ~ltimate existence of any of the veils. In the same way, the ques-tion of the merger of the one into the other cannot stand, for there is the total absence of two separate entities. This chain of reason-able arguments causes a firm conviction to manifest in the aspi-rant. As a result of this conviction, he realizes that the Absolute, ..tte mass .. o! bliss, is the single Truth, and that Siva is the UI~iversal am ~e m whom everything shines inseparably in the mirror of ~onsciousness. Thus, when firmly contemplated, he finds himself m absorption, in oneness, with the divine. , _ In the Tantraloka, Jayaratha comments that in the sa mblzava, sa~ta, and a~1ava upayas, there is a possibility that duality may anse because of the functioning of icclul, jiitina, and kriya saktis; for example, iccha becomes externally inclined because of the phresence of something desirable (esaniya) in the core of icclul.

This perception is direct and immediate."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 5 In this perception of light there is no separate entity to be reflected upon. It is of the nature of self-reflection and has the characteristic of vibration. Here the yogin resorts to icchti sakti as a means for realizing his identity with that light. The absolute freedom of the Lord (svatantrya sakti), men-tioned above, causes the images of entities (bhavas) to manifest in the clear mirror of pure consciousness. The bhtivas cannot shine by themselves; they shine in the void of consciousness as reflec-tions. For this reason, the Lord is said to be immanent. As this sakti is sentient, not inert, so too is its timarsa or cognition; that is, her self-reflection continues ceaselessly. Her self-reflective nature is known as paranada, which in the agama literature is repre-sented as a goddess called partivtik, the Supreme Sound. Speech (vak) is sakti and is not different from reflective aware-ness (vimarsa). The saktis which extend and assume the form of the universe are chiefly three: anuttara, iccha, and unme~a. Basi-cally, they are nothing but the nature of reflection (partlmarsa), assuming the syllabic form of the letters, such as: \"a,\" \"i,\" \"u.\" It is from them that all the saktis originate. The fifty syllables of the Sanskrit alphabet come broadly under two groups: the sixteen letters from a to visarga are known as vowels, and the rest, from ka to ha, are consonants. The vowels are the seeds (bijas) and the consonants are the receptacles (yonis) for receiving the seeds. Primarily, the Lord who is anuttara becomes ananda, which is the self-reflection of universal consciousness (cit). As cit in its slight vibration becomes intent on externality, it is known as ananda. Similarly, iccha becomes isana when it rests in icchti. In the same way, llrmi is the reflective unme~a. As syllables, these three are indicated by \"a,\" \"i,\" \"u.\" From u onward, kriya sakti begins to function. The former three paramarsas have the charac-teristics of praktisa. Hence, they are of the nature of the sun, and the latter para ma rs as. the long vowels \"tt,\" '' r.\" \"fl,\" are of the nature of soma or moon, with the characteristic of rest. When icchti and lsana become inclined toward activity, or, in other words, when activity enters them, disturbance sets in, which"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"6 TANTRASARA causes a break within that tranquility. Then iccha and I.Sana are known as i$yama!:za. In one, the light is predominant. while the other is of the nature of rest. They are known as \"r,\" \"\"r.\" \"I,\" \"!.\" They are the only semivowels, and are unlike the consonant sounds of ra and la; therefore they are not considered consonants as such. Since they retain both the vowel and consonant sounds, they are considered to be neuter. The creative movement which proceeds to flow from anuttara gives rise to different syllables. The impelling force of kriya sakti terminates after giving rise to the var~zas like \"e,\" ''ai,\" ··a,\" and \"au.\" After that, the inward movement begins to operate. As a result of this, the resultants are then put to rest in anuttara. It is to be noted here that this anuttara is different from anuttara known as akara, the supreme Bhairava. It manifests as a1.n, which is pure consciousness in essence. From that anuttara, visarga unfolds . . Visarga, better known as visarga sakti, is the creative force which manifests herself as the universe. She remains inseparably united with the Absolute before the rise of agitation in it. The uni-ve~se as we see it is the manifestation of light as indicated objects (vacya~, and in turn, the reflection of that light stands for each of th.e Indicative sounds as represented by \"a,\" \"a,\" \"i,\" etc. The ~a?ifestation that occurs in this twofold way (vclcya and vacaka) is, 10 reality, the manifestation of vak, the supreme speech. The s~pre~e, known as akula, is possessed of power (sakti) which give.s rise to th~ universe. This power is called kaulikl sakti. She retams the umverse within herself in a very subtle form. but because of the creative impulse expands herself in three stages. These stages of creation are internal but are projected externally by t?e Lord by means of His visarga sakti. Creation, as known to us. IS predominantly of the nature of difference or duality (bheda)~ this is the gross form of creation. In the language of the aga-mas, it is known as c7~wva visarga, creation on the objective level. The creation in which difference and nondifference (bhed{/bheda) shine is called sakta visarga; this is the subtle form of creation. The creation of nondual nature is known as sambhava visarga. the subtlest of all creations."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 7 A~wva visarga shines externally in a gross form. The entire creation consists of the instrument of knowledge and the object of knowledge (pram{u:za and pranzeya), and knowledge with its limited nature shines as mutually different and also different from the Self. In sakta visarga, however, the universe shines in a dual-nondual relation. In a~wva visarga, difference is predominant. It is of the characteristic of ha' while in sakta visarga, all that is experienced (seen, heard, touched, etc.) by the self is obliterated. The universe becomes perfectly intent on pure consciousness. It is the awakening of citta toward cit. Citta, though cit by nature, in its empirical consciousness becomes the experiencing subject, and in its view all objects shine as different from it. This occurs due to the subject-object relationship. Because of this relationship, the universe shines with a variety of objects. At this stage, cit, the experiencing subject of the world-picture, descends down to the level of citta by imposing upon itself the limitations of objects. In sakta visarga, citta is not shining as the subject and its objects with their mutual differences, but rather, it is shining as one with consciousness. In the former case, the resting and ter-minating of citta is in objects having limitations, while here it is submerging all sorts of limitations into all-inclusive pure con-sciousness. For this reason, it is known as citta sambodha, the awakening of citta; that is, in this stage, citta becomes intent on offering itself in the partless nature of Siva, who is characterized as integral Light. In sambhava visarga, however, there shines neither difference nor non-difference; even the universe is absent there; moreover, not even the slightest trace of citta is perceptible. It shines as uni-versal consciousness (cit), free from all limitations, and remains completely refulgent in its perfection. This is the highest visarga, characterized by ananda. The person who has realized his identity with that light experi-ences that everything from the earth to Siva shines in the mirror of consciousness. The very nature of sambhavopaya is this kind of comprehension. Abhinavagupta has presented this idea in the Tantrtiloka in this way: Bhairava, the clear void of consciousness,"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"8 TANTRASARA creates the picture of the universe in Himself. He manifests it and experiences: \"I am the universe.\" Thus, He assumes an immanent nature; this is His function of creation. Then, He maintains the six-fold paths and experiences them as being reflected in Himself. Thus, He is the one who manifests maintenance. Lastly, the entire universe is withdrawn and dissolved into the flame of all-consum-ing fire; this is His function of dissolution. The person who is able to realize the partless one as the single, integral unity of consciousness in which these three functions-creation, maintenance, and dissolution-have their rise and rest, is absorbed in the supreme by means of sambhavopaya. Chapter Four The highest end for human beings is to attain the very nature of Paramasiva, who is ever free from determinacy or \"thought con-structs\" (vikalpa). One is able to rid oneself of thought constructs by means of pure reasoning (sattarka), by listening to holy texts known as agamas, and by following the teachings of a spiritual teacher Th · · · h · · e practice of contemplating or v1ew111g everyt mg as the essential reality (Siva) is the means by which one is able to rise abov_e impure thought constructs (asuddha-vikalpas). The Tan-trasara states that one considers oneself bound because of vikal-pas. The wrong conception of one's true nature as body, etc., is the ca.use of mundane existence; however, when a vikalpa of the ?PP.OSite nature pure \"thought construct\" (suddha-vikalpa) is born, 1~ dispels the wrong kind of thought construct, places one on the right path, and enables one to attain the highest good. Though pure thought constructs are of no avail in revealing the natu~e of Paramasiva, the supreme reality, for it is everywhere and lil every way ever luminous, it is the considered opinion of the author that pure vikalpas remove the sense of duality from the Self. The sense of duality is not something positive, but is only ignorance (aklzyati) of one's essential nature. This sense of duality is removed by pure thought constructs (suddha-vikalpa). Pure knowledge (suddhavidya) leads to sattarka, or pure rea-"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 9 soning. One should bear in mind that sattarka is distinct from the form of gross reasoning as understood in the Nyaya system, for it is said that sattarka arises by itself in a person whom sakti has keenly touched. This tarka leads to the continuity of ideas similar to suddha-vikalpa. It is stated in the Tantrasara: The supreme reality is unlimited by nature and consists of an undivided singu-larity of consciousness. It transcends all the principles of limited nature which terminate in Siva. This renders stability to all and is the vitality of universe. Through it the universe \"throbs\" with life, and that is \"I\" (alzam). The continuous practice of sattarka regarding the nature of reality brings about the purity of \"thought constructs.\" The high-est excellence of sattarka terminates in blzavana, by which one is able to make manifest as distinct even the most indistinct. In some, sattarka may arise by itself, without the need for recourse to any spiritual guide or the reading of holy texts. When it is enlivened in a person, he is considered to have been initiated by the luminous goddesses of his own consciousness (smrzviddevis), the deities personifying consciousness itself. However. the person on whom the grace of the Lord has descended less keenly should be initiated by the spiritual teacher, after which he is able to secure the right of listening to agamas, which by their proper understanding help one to become free from doubts. Afterwards. the truth that is contained in the agama gives rise to sattarka in him. Sattarka is the light of '\"pure knowledge\" (suddlzavidya). It is considered to be the most excellent and direct limb of yoga. It is stated in the Tantrasa ra that yoga is also a kind of vikalpa, but that it is characterized by intensive awareness (anusandlzanatma) regarding essential reality. For the purpose of keeping the essen-tial reality ever luminous in his view, the _vogin takes recourse to this form of vikalpa for the maturity of his awareness.

Therefore, for the purification of vikalpas, and because he is limited himself, he resorts to means that are also Ii mired. Hence, the individual takes up practices of the intellect (buddlzi), vital energy (prru;a), or the body itself for this purpose. Among these kinds of aspirants, those more advanced proceed on the path of meditation (dhydna). The Tan trasti ra gives a brief account of how this contemplative meditation is to he performed.

This medita-tio · ' ~is to be performed in such a way that the three-namely, the s~bJect, the instrument of knowledge and the object, representing fire th ' d h ' e sun, and the moon respectively-have coalesce to get er and be co h · ' · TI · d . . met e unity of a single mass of consciousness. 11s me -ltat1on is t b h . \"d . . 0 e continued as long as they have t eir separate i en-tities, until they shine as one light and blaze up as the fire of the tgrealt Lord.

The upward movement of pra~za is commonly known as uccara; how-ever, ucctira has the characteristics of spanda, which is the very soul of it. Prti ~za is of two kinds, one general (samtinya) and the other specific (vise~a). In the former, difference of any sort is totally absent, while in the latter. because of distinct activities the same ' pra~w shows itself in five forms, known as pra~za, apana, samana, udllna, and vyclna. It is quite evident that these five have their base in the general prti ~za. Because of the vibrating movement of prti ~za, inarticulate sound. known as the '\"unstruck\" sound (antihatanada), becomes manifest. It sounds continuously, without any break, in the heart of every living being. This nada is associated with two bi}as, namely sr!jtiblja (sa) and salizharabi}a (ha). The activity of pra~za functions without any conscious effort on the part of the I iving being. Usually prd ~za moves along the chan-nels of ida and pingala. The middle path remains blocked for the ordinary human being. When, by the grace of the spiritual teacher. the middle path opens up, then the aspirant's journey toward the supreme begins. The aspirant realizes that the movement of pra~za is associated with Sak ti. It is she who, in the form of ha1J1sa, is moving forward and is the real mover of pra~w. At that time, the aspirant realizes that she gets the two bljas nourished in the two places of their origin, namely, the heart (11rdaya) and dvadasanta, the top of the head. Upon this realization, the yogin feels that the pra~za, before its rise, takes rest in the void of the hearc then, by its externaliza-tion as apana, the external objects not only shine forth but also get nourished by apana, the moon. The yogin then experiences the all-pervasive nature of pra~w.

These delights (llnanda) are named 11irtina11da and others. They are six in number.

In the preceding chapter, Abhi-navagupta describes a~wvopaya, which helps the aspirant attain absorption into the divine Self through the means of uccara, dhyana, var~w, and kara~za. The present section discusses how a yogin adopts pra~zavayu as the means for attaining his or her desired goal. From this chapter onward, whatever is described up to Chap-ter Twelve comes under the \"formation of the place\" (sthanapra-kalpana). The locations are three: the vital energy, the body, and other external objects. The six paths (adhvas) are immense. They have their base in general pra ~w, while the adhva known as time (kala) has its base in a specific pra~w. The objects shine in two ways, either with sequence or with-out any sequence. The act of confining anything within limits (kalana) is the function of time (kala). Although pure conscious-ness is free from all limiting adjuncts, the universe in the form of the knower and the known is made manifest by its freedom of will. As a result, they shine forth with their distinctive and limited character. The agency of the delimiting power of consciousness is known as kala sakti, which is power in the form of time. However, before the apparent externalization of objects, sequence and non-sequence remain latent in its pure nature. The entire universe not only remains inseparably one with the light (prakasa), but in order to show itself as limited, praktisa at first negates the universe and experiences '\"I am transcending the universe.'' Thus, the void (frinya) transcending everything is known as sanya pramtita, the knowing subject of the void. Because of its association with impurity (ti~wva mala), the knowing subject of the void (sunya pramatcl) becomes externally inclined. and the universe that was previously rejected or negated is now thought of as the most desirable object. Then a vibrating upsurge occurs in it, which shows itself as pra~za."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"14 TANTRASARA Pra~w is the first expansion of consciousness. It shows itself as spanda, the very nature of self-reflection. For this reason. pra ~za is said to be predominantly of the nature of the power of activity (kriya sakti). Therefore, though it is inert Ua(la), it is primarily of the nature of consciousness. For this reason, by resorting to pro ~za, the aspirant is able to attain the supreme reality. Pra(la is the very life of every living being. It is always on the move. Because of its activities in different locations of the body, the universal pra~w is known as pra~za, apana, samana, udana, and vyana. Of these five, pra~za and apana function as the activity of inhaling and exhaling. The incoming movement of the breath starts from the heart and ends \"twelve fingers above one ·s head,\" known as dvadasanta, while the outgoing movement of the breath starts from dvadasanta and ends at the heart. This movement con-tinues and goes on functioning 21,600 times in a single day. Pra~za is the manifest form of sakti, and al 1 the six adhvas -namely, var~za, mantra, and pada on the one hand, and kala, tat-tva, and bhuvana on the other-have their respective locations in it. ~tis to be noted here that adlzvas are generally known as paths which lead the aspirant in a sequence to the supreme. In the end, however, for the one in whom the right view of nonduality has developed, these adlzvas become absorbed in I-consciousness. For this :eason, adhvas are not simply paths but are also something that is absorbed. . Hence the yogin makes an effort to realize the supreme real-ity by resorting to pra~za, and thus puts an end to the mutations caused ?Y the impelling force of time . . By Its nature pra~za is constantly vibrating. This vibration anses spontaneously in the location of kanda (bulb) below the ~enerat~v~ organ. The spontaneous movement of pra ~w bestows IJttle sp1ntual result in comparison with the movement of the vital energy that is caused by the conscious effort of the yogin. Hence, by his deliberate effort in association withjyenha sakti, the yof!,ill tries to impel his prcl~za from the center of the heart along the path upward so that it may reach the dvadasanta, twelve fingers"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 15 above one's head. After letting it rest there, it is made to move again toward the heart. This ingoing and outgoing process is sim-ply known as inhaling and exhaling, but to the yogin it means something else. In the primary stage, the yogin with keen observa-tion watches each movement of pra~1a rising in the heart, proceed-ing upward and coming back into the heart again. He divides the whole course of pra~w into sixteen divisions. Each of these sixteen divisions is known as tufi, representing a day. Similarly, the exha-lation represents a night. When the yogin becomes sufficiently proficient, he then takes each movement of pra ~za and apana to represent a month. The course along which pra~w and apana move measures thirty-six digits (a1iguli). The yogin assumes that the hour, the tithi, and other long and short units of time get their rise in pra~za. It should be noted here that kriya sakti, which operates externally as kala sakti in pra~w, is without any definite form. For this rea-son, whatever shines in pra~w as measures of very small amounts of time, such as k~ana, lava, and so forth, may shine as a year or more than several years. Not only do they shine and rise in it, but they also terminate in the highest equilibrium. When pra~w runs the course of two and one-quarter digits, the duration is known as a tufi. Four of such tufis make a prahara, while half of a tufi is known as gap (sandhya). The exhaling and the inhaling represent the day and the night. In the same way, the yogin also conceives that a month, consist-ing of thirty lunar days (tithis) with broad divisions of two fort-nights, rises in pra~za. All the titlzis from the first day of the lunar fortnight (pratipad) to the night of new moon (amavasya), and then again from pratipad to the full moon day (par~1ima), lie along the course of the inhaling and exhaling movement of pra~w and apana. The sixteenth tithi, consisting of half a tu ti at the start and another half at the final resting place, is considered to be the san-dhya, the meeting point of the day and the night. These two halves of tufis are free from the influence of time, and for this reason sandhycls are considered to be very auspicious. Similarly. during"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"16 TANTRASARA the dark fortnight, the moon or the aptina offers its digits (kalti) one by one to pra~za, the sun, and the final one is offered near the dvadasanta at the fifteenth tu,ti, after which the moon itself gets dissolved into the sun. This is known as amtivasya, when the moon remains latent in the kalti known as ama. When the span of one half of the tufi occupied by amtivtisya gets into the portion of pratipad, the duration of the tithi is cut short and therefore a solar eclipse occurs. The eclipse obliterates the difference of the know-ing subject (pramata), the instrument of knowledge (prama ~za), and the objects known (prameya). Therefore, the occasion is con-sidered to be auspicious because it bestows otherworldly results. Similarly, a year is supposed to get its rise in a single move-ment of prcz~za. For this reason, the entire course of the movement of pra~za and apana corresponds with uttartiya~1a (the progress of the sun to the north) and daksinaya~w (the progress of the sun t~ the south). In this case, the tithis occupy only one-fifth of a digit and the \"sun's passage from one sign of the zodiac (rasi) to another'' (smizkranti) occurs every six digits. For the purpose of minimizing the influence of time, the yo gin fur_ther strives to get twelve years to rise in a single movement of prw:za and apana. He locates sixty tithis in a digit, and the passage of_ one ra~n to another is supposed to be the duration of a year. In this way, he is able to observe the duration of twelve yea rs in the singl~ movement of pra~za and apana. Like prafJa, time is thought to arise in aptina. It arises in the heart and goes down to muladhara. Just as Brahma and others are supposed to be the causal deities residing in different locations, namely, in the heart and other places as mentioned above, in the same way, they are said to have their locations in the heart and other places down to kanda, etc. The yogin meditates upon the dei-ties as the causal agents of the stages of childhood, youth, old age. death, rebirth, and liberation of the embodied soul. From Brahma to Anasrita, these six are considered to be the cause of different states through which a living being must pass. As they give rise to these stages of I ife, in the beginning they are accepted by the"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 17 yogin, but are ultimately rejected by him. To him, the most accept-able object is the supreme Goddess, the seventh, called unmana. Once the aspirant is united with unman a, it is possible for him to reach beyond these states. The movement of apana ends in the dvadasanta, otherwise known as the yoginivaktra. If the yo gin is able to find rest there, the distinctions of the upper and the lower will be put to rest forever. This method is followed similarly in samana. Samana arises in the navel, flows along the 72,000 nadis of the body, and becomes manifest in the heart. It flows along the ten principal nadis: i(l.a, pi~1gala, su~wnna, gandhari, !zastijilzva, alambusa, pusa, kuhu, and samkhini; but of these, the first three are the most important. The heart is like a lotus with eight petals pointing to eight direc-tions. Because of its association with eight directions, it imitates the activities of the Lord of directions, and appears to be cruel or placid. It is known as samana because it remains uniformly in the body. Just as an equinox (vi~uvat) occurs in pra~za, similarly, the yogin ascertains five passages (sanikrantis) and two equinoxes (vi~uvats) during one day. They also occur during the night in the same way. It is well known that vi~uvats are the equinoxes, when the day and night are of equal duration. This time is considered to be very auspicious. The movement of udana proceeds from the heart up to the dvadasanta, a center of pra~za twelve fingers above the head. The yogin tries to watch the entire measure of time from one tufi to sixty years in the single movement of udana. It is thought to have the characteristic of vibration (spandarapa). Vyana is all-perva-sive by nature, and so it is free from sequence; still, time arises there in the form of a subtle vibration. The subtle forms of the vowels of the Sanskrit alphabet (vanrns) arise without any effort, but in their gross forms, the var~zas rise through personal effort. The syllables are of three kinds: transcendent, subtle, and gross. The transcendent are of two kinds: paratama is the highest form that preserves a distinc-tion among the vowels, while nada is an uncreated sound, hence"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"18 TANTRASARA it is known as anahata, a sound that resounds ceaselessly without beginning or end. It is united with all the syllables as their source, and in this sense is the supreme transcendent form of sound with-out distinctions. Chapter Seven In the seventh chapter, the text presents destidhva, the path of space. It consists of objects of multifarious forms made manifest by the Lord by means of His power of activity. The form of any of these objects, such as house, courtyard, market, temple, garden, or forest, which are different from one another, shines to a limited subject only as being mutually distinct from one another, and also from the subject himself. To the Lord, who is perfect and there-fore free from all limitations, all subjects and objects shine as his very Self. In reality, these forms have their substratum in pure c~nsciousness, and so they shine nondifferently from it. In its free Will, consciousness (sarfzvid) veils its pure nature and manifests before the view of the limited subject as sanya, prti!Ja. and buddhi, and from this the embodied soul sees pictures of objects as distinct f~~m the experiencing subject. Thus, f!lnya, prti~rn, and buddhi s me externally as objects but really they are not different from the Self. ' _ ~he adhvas have their locations in sanya, pra ~za, in a II the n~dt cakras, and in the body itself. As they proceeded from con-s~wusness, they are to be dissolved into it by involutionary meth-o 5: As the adhvas are vast, it is practically impossible, even for a yogm, to do so in an eon of ages. Therefore, one should know, first of all, the real nature of these adhvas. They have their real resting place in consciousness, and. through it smnvid. the entire adhva (consisting of the void, ~he 111tellect, the vital energy, and everything), whether it abides 111 the body, the image of a deity, or the sacrificial altar, becomes comp~ete. When the aspirant is able to realize this, he dissolves them 111to Brahma, the Lord of Brahmaf)(la; then, the tattvas from"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 19 puru~a to kala are dissolved into Vi~I).u, who is their Lord; then, may a, the knot (grant hi) into Rudra, upon which maya is to be dissolved into Isvara, who is its Lord; then, suddhavidya should be dissolved in Sadasiva, and Anasrita Siva is to be dissolved in Sak ti and Siva; and finally all of them are dissolved into Parasiva, the all-pervading One. The Tantric text called Trisira Bhairava presents pure con-sciousness as if it were a tree, consisting of three portions. The extreme fringe, the root, is known as bodhamula, where \"this-ness\" is predominant; it is the gross form of bodha (conscious-ness). The middle portion of that tree is not predominantly dual in nature because, though it shines as \"this-ness\" here, it has merged with consciousness. The most perfect is bodha, the uppermost part of that tree, where there is no separate existence. This state is known as bodhagra, the highest consciousness, where everything has its existence without any separate distinction but shines non-differently from pure consciousness. From this, it is evident that all the adhvas, consisting of thirty-six tattvas, are not different from Parasiva, the Supreme. One who is able to realize the most delightful adhvas as nondifferent from his own consciousness can attain Sivahood without delay. This chapter gives a detailed account of all the tattvas from the earth onward, and the bhuvanas contained in each. Chapter Eight In the previous chapter we saw that worlds (bhuvanas) are the expansion of Sakti, which keep all the multifarious forms of sub-jects and their objects of experience within herself. Permeating them all is the highest universal. known as Paramasiva. who remains ever shining. That which is less pervasive than the high-est universal, present in some bhuvanas but absent in others. is defined as a tattva: for example. solidity, firmness, and grossness are all qualities found in Bralmzti~z(la alone. The next discussion in this chapter is the relationship of cause"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"20 TANTRASARA and effect (ktiryaktira!J.abhava). According to this system. the relation is of two kinds, namely, the transcendent (para ma rth i ka) and the artificial or fictional (kalpita). The transcendent relation is such that, because of the Lord's freedom of wi 11, because He is a free agent, everything beginning with Siva and ending in the earth shines nondifferently from Him and rests in Him. The artificial relation of the cause and the effect, however, is such that every-thing follows a regular sequence. The relation of cause and effect is created by His power of niyati. According to this system. the rod, the wheel, and clay, considered essential for producing a jar, are only expedients. The real cause is the Lord, for He remains associated with all of them as the cause and the effect. In order to support this view, it is stated that it is He who brings al 1 the causes together and sets them apart. The impelling force of universal consciousness is considered to be the real agent of everything. When the potter makes a jar, he himself is one with that universal consciousness who is the real doer. Parasiva is perfect and full with His five saktis. These .\\(aktis are inseparably united with their Lord and are manifested in five aspects by His free will. These five are: cit, ananda, iccha, }Flana, ~?d kriya. The five principles, namely siva, sakti, sculdsiva, z~vara, and Suddhavidya, are the manifestations of the .\\(aktis men-tioned above. It should be noted here that Sakti is one and affluent with all the Saktis, but due to the dominance of one over the other. distinctions are also observed among them. For example. in .Siva tattv~, con:ci.ousness (cit) is predominant~ when (111anda becomes d?mmant, ~tis called §akti tattva. The lords of the five pure prin-ciples are Siva, Sakti Sadasiva Isvara. and Ananta. These five beginning with Siva ~nd endin~ in Ananta have their respective ga~ws or hosts. They are named sambhava, sakta, mantrefvara, and mmz.tra. This is known as pure path or adhva. The impure adlzva is created by the wil I of the Lord for f u 1-fil ling the desires of limited souls. Aghora is the creator of the impure adhva by causing agitation (k~obha) in maya."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 21 The principle called mayo is the material cause of the insen-tient universe. It should be remembered in this context that the mayo. sakti, belonging to the Lord, is that which manifests mayo, the material cause, and is quite different from mayo, the principle or tattva. The entire universe is born of mayo tattva, from which kala is born. It, in turn, is responsible for the rise of limited power of action in the limited soul. Maya veils the pure conscious state of the self for which it loses its power of knowledge and activity. Ka lti, though born of may ti tattva and being impelled by its force, becomes attached to the limited soul. These two, that is, kalti and a~w, remain firmly attached to each other, so they cannot be easily differentiated. Those who remain under the influence of mayti tattva fail to get release so long as they do not receive grace from Ananta, the Lord of maya tattva. Only then can puru~as differentiate themselves from mayti, and as a result they become vzjFzanczkala souls. Similarly, when one realizes his distinction from prakrti, he never goes below prakrti; and when one realizes one's distinction from kala, one doesn't go beyond kala tattva. When the residual trace of the malas become totally absent from the soul, he becomes one with Siva. It is to be remembered in this connection that the kala tattva is the giver of limited activity to the limited soul. The impure vidyti bestows on the insentient subject a limited cognitive power. Only because of its presence is the limited subject able to see the real nature of the intellect, and distinguish happiness and others from the mass of objects which are reflected in the mirror of buddhi. \"I know something\" and \"I do something\" are the forms of judgment aroused by vidyti and kalti, respectively. These rczga, vidyti, kala, kala, and niyati are of two types; because of grace, they are considered pure and therefore function as means for the attainment of Sivahood. Kala tattva becomes pure when it consists of activities like worshipping, etc.; raga tat-tva becomes so when it gives rise to attachment to the Lord. Vidya becomes pure when it causes discernment regarding the Lord. In"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"22 TANTRASARA the same way, ktila provides potency to the teachings regarding the Lord (tadupadesadi vi$aymneva kalanam), while niyati sup-ports the soul in remaining steadfast in His worship. The group of kala and other tattvas are different according to the difference of the individual souls, for the activity in them is seen to rise differently in different limited subjects. It is noteworthy that the agenthood with the characteristic of limited nature gives rise to pradhana, the equilibrium of the three gw:zas, i.e., sattva, rajas, and tamas. The supreme Subject in the beginning is made limited by maya, which takes away all of His glory. He is bestowed again with a little of His glory by means of kala tattva and so on. Thus, He becomes a pasu, a limited subject, an.ct the maya, kala, raga, vidya, niyati, kala tattvas serve Him as veils (kafzcukas). . The author further points out that prakrti is of two kinds. One is ~he equilibrium of the gu~zas; the other is gw:w tattva itself which, being disturbed by the predominant Lord of the tattva, ca~se.s agitation (k$obha) in prakrti, which in turn gives rise .to the prmc1ple of buddhi. Prakrti should be accepted as the recipient of the agitation, otherwise it would not be possible for the 1 i berated soul ~o remain uninvolved in bondage. According to this system, the disturbance (k$obha) inprakrti is caused by the Lord Himself. ~h.O!.nkara arises from buddhi, which sees the 1 ight of pu ru~a as .1f m a mirror that has become slightly impure, and because of its contact with objects it makes one experience \"I know this\" an~ \"I do this.\" Thus it feels identity with the object and thinks of Itself as \"I.\" Buddhi receives the reflection of objects and at the same time, though insentient, manifests the light of puru~a. Fro~ ah.wnkara that is predominantly sattvika in nature come th~ five mner and external sense organs, from rajasa aha1J1ka ra anses manas, and from the tamasa nature of aha171kti ra the five tanmatras are born. Thus the tanmatras give rise to five gross elements: ether (nabhas), air (vayu), fire (tejas), water (apa>. and earth (prthvl). This chapter discusses all thirty-six principles, which are mutu-"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 23 ally related to one another. These are classified in a threefold divi-sion consisting of nara, Sakti, and Siva. Siva pervades all by His characteristic nature of luminous consciousness. The principle in which this characteristic of light is more prominent is considered more extensive than the other. For example, Siva is more extensive than Sakti, while the latter is more so than nara. Chapter Nine This chapter classifies all the tattvas grouped under fifteen aspects as viewed by the seven kinds of knowing subjects: siva, mantramahesvara, mantresvara, mantra, vijiianakala, pralaya-kala, and sakala. These subjects each possess one of seven saktis; thus counting the saktis and the possessors of these saktis, the number becomes fourteen. Including svarflpa, which refers to the \"object in itself,\" with these fourteen, each of the tattvas from prthvl to prakrti has fifteen aspects. The Lord possesses three saktis in the form of the goddesses as para, parapara, and apara para. The transcendent sakti func-tions as the subject (pramatti). She is para sakti, who is insep-arably united with the supreme Subject. The goddess paraparti sakti is the instrument (pramti~W), and tiparti sakti operates as the object of experience (prameya). The earth and other tattvas have their distinctive svarapa; that is, they are objects in themselves. In other words, the tattvas from prakrti down to the earth shine as objects without having the reflection of any of the limiting adjuncts of the subject and its instruments. This is said to be the pure nature of each object; its existence does not rest in the subject. The object has its rest in itself, meaning that it exists independently of the limits of ordi-nary sense perception. It should be noted in this context that the object as such shines in this distinctive way by the grace of tiparti sakti.

When saktis related to different subjects become predominant, however, and the object in its turn rests in them, this is known as its sakta form. It shines thus by the grace of parapara sakti. These sakta forms are seven, because the numbers of saktis related to the different subjects are seven in number; but when the subject possessing these saktis becomes predominant and the objects rest in the knowing subjects. it is known to be of the form of Siva, who is the possessor of the saktis (saktiman). They shine thus by the grace of para sakti. The subject characterized as possessing a particular sakti, that is, a saktiman, is of seven kinds. The first of these seven subjects, known as sakala, has vidyti and kala as its saktis, but they lie dormant in pralaytikala souls, and though they are abiding in vijFzanakala, it is as if they are disappearing.

The author shows, as an example, how the earth principle (prthvi tattva) shines in relation to pramata and prameyas. The light that shines nondifferently from the Earth (dhara) is Siva. He supports his view by quoting the fruti Dharamantramahesvara: being impelled by the will of Siva leads to dharamantre.frz for bestowing siddhis on those who are desirous of it, and who are connected with dhara. Mantras are the vacakas of the super-intending deities of different bhuvanas under prthivl tatti'a, in accordance with the procedure prescribed by the non-Saiva doc-trines. He remains as pralayakala knowing subject abiding in the earth principle (dharapralayakevali) and will have his egoism abide in dhara. Then, the author shows how all the tattvas abide as pra ~za .frzkti, r~l~ted to the knowing subject (pramata). One single pr[z~w, con-sistmg of sixteen tufis, extends until the emergence of the (vedya), the ~hing to be known. Among the sixteen tufis, the first is the undifferentiated one, the second is the one that manifests the gra-hak~, the last tufi is inseparable from the object, and the one pre-cedmg the last has the form of a fully manifest grahaka. Thus, twelve tu.tis out of sixteen are divided broadly into two divisions. The first six are of the nature of nirvikalpaka and the next six are the characteristic of parapara, from where vikalpa begins to rise. All the subjects from mantramahesvara down to sakala shine along the twelve tufis, two for each subject, while the first tu.ti. it should be remembered, is the location for sakti. The fifteen aspects with their varied distinctions are observed in two tu/is each. Just as in the cognition of a jar, the character-istics of the fifteen aspects can be watched, in the same way, this is observed in the vital energy when it is engaged in grasping any object. It has been hinted earlier that when a knowing subject. such as a sakala, does not participate as a subject-that is, when it is taken as a svarupa-the aspect of fifteen becomes thirteen."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 27 Thus, the number of aspects diminishes gradually by twos. Then finally, as distinction disappears, the number of tufis diminishes. At last, the yogin is able to attain absorption in Siva. Here, the time unit consists of two tufis-the first tufi is considered as being fulL and the other has the character of Siva-Sakti. It has been stated in the Tantraloka that one who is able to absorb oneself in the second tuf i is sure to attain the power of omniscience. Now the author explains the nature of states known as waking, dreaming, deep sleep, the fourth (turya), and beyond the fourth (turyatita). All subjects, along with their saktis, are knowers of the objects of all the tattvas. These states are the manifestations of consciousness conditioned by knowables (prameyas). The prameya state is said to be the chief characteristic of the waking state Uagrat), otherwise known as (addlzi~i;;fheya), the locus. In the Ma !in ivijaya it is known as pi~z(lastlza, for the yo gin, taking his stand on dhara and others as the base, is able to iden-tify himself with them. But to thej11a11i11 who is well advanced in meditation, it is known as sa rvatobhadra, for to him, the jag rat state is one which fully pervades the objects of experience. Tech-nically, the waking state is the object of experience (prameya) or adhi~'f lzeva, the base, while the dreaming state (svapna) is known as prama~w or adlzi~flzana. and adlzi~flzauz or the subject is the pramMd in deep sleep (su~upti). All the states have subdivisions of their own: (1) jagrat-jagrat, jagrat-svapna. jiigrat-su~upti, andjagrat-turya: (2) svapna-jagrat, svapna-.\\TO/J/la, svapna-su~rnpti, and svapna-turya; and (3) su~­upt i-jag rat, su ~i;;upti-svapna, su~upti-su~upti, and su~upt i-tu rya. Jagrat is known to have four portions. The object that is expe-rienced is ahuddlza. insentient, and the instrument of experience is called huddlw; right knowledge, born from instrumentality. is known as prabuddlza and suprabuddlza. Of these two, prabuddlza is of the nature of lmddhi, while suprabuddlza is free from impuri-ties of the object of experience and therefore is of the character-istic of resting in the self.

The abode of all paths (adhvas) is the vital energy (pra~za) and intention/thought (swizkalpa). Everything lies in the vital energy and sa1izkalpa, hence it is known as abiding there, and therefore it is also known as padastha. Rupayati is the one that gives form to the respective objects, and then withdraws them into the Self, which is none other than the atman. The Self, where they abide, is identical with the object. This identification and merger is known as rupastha, but the form which is beyond all these is cal led r~ipatlta. To the jifrinin, svapna, whose nature is vika lpika, is con-si.d~red to be vyapti, for his jizana is then free from external con-d1t10ns, and he is the active agent in changing and arranging the order of his thoughts.

The sphere or egg (a~1(ia) is a kind of covering which exists up to Sakti, and though the bhuvanas exist under the Siva tattva, they are said to be of the form of the void and there-fore do not serve as a covering. Chapter Eleven This chapter discusses saktipata, but before givmg a detailed account of it, the text deals with issues concerning the occurrence of the descent of grace in a particular individual. This has been dealt with in detail in our translation of the text and the additional notes. The author presents and critiques three standard views regarding saktipata: (1) bondage, or smhsara, has ignorance as its root. When the rise of right knowledge occurs, the descent of grace also comes into being. This view has been refuted by the author. (2) Next, the view known as karmasamya, that is, the bal-ance of two opposing actions, is summarized. According to this theory, when karmasamya occurs, saktipMa is sure to take place. The author does not accept this view either. (3) The third view considers the ripening of mala (mala paripaka) as the cause of saktipMa. which is also rejected by the author. According to Abhinavagupta, these views may be acceptable to the fol lowers of dualist philosophies, but according to the non-dual system known as Paramesvaradvayavtzda (known to modern scholarship as Kashmir Saivism), they are not tenable. According to this system. the Great Lord, in the course of His play, veils His true nature and assumes a limited nature. When the concealment of His pure nature disappears, the limited self becomes the recipi-ent of ,fo kt i p iU a and is ab 1 e to a tt a i n the pro x i rn it y of s var ii pa . the true form of the Lord, either by fol lowing a sequence or by attaining proximity to the Lord without sequence. The Great Lord (Malzesvara) is in essence free, and the causal agent of ,foktipata, for which he does not depend on anything or anyone. The person who is eager to have worldly and otherworldly enjoyment (bhoga)"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"32 TANTRASARA can also attain saktipata, but for the bhoga to be manifested, some actions must be performed. Likewise, the person who has the desire for both blzoga and mok~a is also required to perform cer-tain acts in order to attain them. It has been stated in the Tantraloka that saktipata is, in essence, the descent of the highest light on the limited soul. It is free from all limitations and is of the characteristic of pure con-sciousness. However, saktipata of a slightly lower nature, though shining with all the fullness of consciousness, is conditioned with the limitations of bhoga. It should be remembered in this context that saktipata is really the nature of the iccha or will of the Lord. It is He who, by His freedom of will veils Himself and manifests all subjects and objects as limited' entities. Due to His activity of conceal-menL known as tirodlzana, the objects to be enjoyed shine before t~e view of the limited subjects. Thus, He willfully and playfully bmds Himself, then removes these bonds, and finally shines in the fullness of j!lana and kriya. His play of freedom is such that. though He assumes limited forms in an outward journey of con-cealing Himself by manifesting and sustaining the universe, He makes a return journey to Himself through the descent of grace an? revelation of Himself to Himself, ultimately shining in His pristine pure nature. Grace is said to be of two types: the higher, that is, the more pure and potent form, is called para; and the less potent form is a~ara. The para form of saktipata is bestowed only by the Lord !-\"hmse~f, but the apara kind of grace is bestowed by the super-intending lords of the domain over which they have control. The forn: of_ Saktipata bestowed by them does not lead the sou 1 to attam Szva-hood, hence it is inferior to the one which flows from the Lord Himself. This apara grace is further divided into ma~z(la, less keen, and tivra, exceedingly keen. When apara sakrip(lfa is ma ~1 (/a, it gives bi rt h to right judgment in the sou L upon w h i ch the ability to distinguish between prakrti and puru~a occurs. The result of this type of discrimination is that the soul does not a hide"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 33 in the worlds below prakrti. When the descent is exceedingly keen (tivra), however, the soul by its merit is able to discriminate his own being from kala tattva, and as a result becomes one of the Vijiianakala souls. He even arises to the level of mantra when the Lord wills it so. After .foktipMa, the author explains the nature of concealment (tirobhavaa) as one of the five functions (paficakrtya) of the Lord. Tirobhava is of two types: niyati krama, when the Lord is seen as the one who ordains the law and the one who bestows the fruits of action in accordance with the merit and demerit of the soul. Here, He takes recourse to niyati, and therefore the functions of creation. maintenance. and dissolution flow from Him. But above ma_vcl ~1(/a' that is, at the level of sakti, which is beyond the sphere of karma, there continues creation of immense nature. This cre-ation is known as malzasr~fi. Similarly, the pralaya of greater nature. that is, the highest form of dissolution, is also performed at this stage. Creation and dissolution of this nature are performed by the Lord without taking recourse to niyati, but those which are performed from the level of mava downward are accomplished by his taking recourse to niyati. Therefore, at that stage, though He is, in essence, always prabuddlza, the enlightened one, he behaves in the worldly level as an unenlightened one. Chapter T·welve In th is chapter, the author presents and substantiates the rea-sons for the performance of initiations (dfk~a). In addressing the question of the necessity of drk~a, the author states that initia-tion alone is the means that leads the soul to enjoyment (bhoga) and finally helps one to attain liberation. Primarily, drk~ti sanc-tifies the soul and produces in it the competency for receiving knowledge (jiiana), yoga. etc., for without obtaining drk~ti fol-lowing the course of Saiva Yoga would not be possible. Therefore drk~\\'{[ is considered to be the preliminary step in the progression from sa1izskara. to the proper practice of yoga, to perfection in"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"34 TANTRASARA yoga, and finally to liberation; or, to put it another way: initiation sariiskara, perfection in mantra, worldly and otherworldly enjoy~ ment (bhoga), and finally, liberation. It should be remembered that the highest kind of knowledge is obtained from the holy texts (sastra). One who is uninitiated is not considered to be the right person to receive instruction in the sastras; therefore, dlksa is essential. On the other hand. those who have received the highest kind of grace, and thus earned compe-tence, do not require any formal dlk~a, for their innate knowledge serves as dlk~a for them. To those who are unable to fol low the path of knowledge, however, the easier path is rec om mended; it is predominantly of a ritualistic nature. S~ana, bathing, is the preliminary step to dlk~a. Ge.nerally, bathmg cleanses impurities of the body, but esoterica! ly 1t helps one to become absorbed into Paramesvara. Ordinarily, bathing is performed with water; according to this system it is a little bit dif-~~ren~: one who goes to take a bath should think of the presence of Siva h. · , m is eight forms. By uttering a mantra one should perform ones bath with the eight prescribed materials. Bathing is of two ~h~es, external and internal. The former is done by earth, water, sacred ashes, etc., but the internal one is performed by one's concentrat · · b · · h. ion m various locations of the body.

Nyasa is performed first in the fingers, which is followed by nyasa in the body. Malinl and matrka both are Siva and Sakti by nature. The supreme form of Siva in this tradition is Bhairava; the mass of phonemes (sabdarasi) is contained indivis-ibly and inseparably within Himself. This sabdarasi is also Sakti Herself, because it is she who, like a mother, gives birth to her creation in its differentiated forms; therefore, she is called matrka, the mother. Malilll is put on by the Rudras like a mala, or gar-land, by which they bestow enjoyment and liberation. In deriving the word mala, the author says that the phoneme \"ma\" represents salizhara; that is, withdrawal. The phoneme \"ra\" means granting, and since \"ra\" and \"la\" are identical. \"la\" means to receive. Nyasa should be performed in order to bring into predomi-nance the sakta body in the worshipper. It is done in the sacrifi-cial vessel (arghapatra). The teacher (acarya) then purifies all the articles of worship with a few drops of water from the arghapatra. After worshipping the external deities outside the door, the acarya enters within and watches the interior with the vision of the Lord. If the disciple is desirous of release, the acarya sits facing north; if otherwise, he sits facing east. The highest light of conscious-ness is the middle, from which the other directions proceed. Just as the Lord manifests the respective distinctions of directions, so does the sun. It is the sun which represents the Lord'sjiiana sakti. While deciding directions, one should think of the unity of the three-namely, the self, the sun, and the Lord-as coalesced into one. It is followed by the ritual practice of burning of the physical and the subtle bodies. and by this relinquishing I-consciousness in the physical body. However, it should be pointed out that the physical body is not actually burned: rather, offerings represent-ing the body, etc. are consigned to the fire.

This body is really the supreme form (para marti) of the Lord and is characterized by the mantra \"0171 ha17z.\" Other nyasas are performed so that all the tattvas may rise there. All the saktis associated with nine principles are to be worshipped, after which the sixfold nyasa follows. There are five states, namely, waking Uagrat), dream (svapna), deep sleep (SU$Upti), the fourth (turya), and beyond the fourth (turiyatlta); but anuttara is beyond them all. This is called the state or condition of one's own nature (svabhavadasa). These states have Brahma Visnu Rudra, Isvara, Sadasiva, and Siva as their lords, and a're th~s 'are associated with the real cause of thirty-six categories.

Above maya and below the trident, the silizlzasana is covered with two sheets of cloth: the lower one represents maya for veil-ing the real nature of manifestation, and the upper one is for the purpose of covering maya itself. The worshipper then meditates on the vidya lotus; that is, suddhavidya as a white lotus. Its pet-als are occupied by the saktis known as vama and others, with Brahma, Vi~~zu, and Rudra representing creation, maintenance, and dissolution. Object of knowledge (meya), knowledge (ma~a), and subject (matr) are superintending, seated on three ma~z(lalas, one above the other, from lambika onward.

Three lotuses have grown from his navel, consisting of a three-pronged trident, piercing three apertures of His head; the trident is of the nature of nadanta and made luminous by the three saktis, i.e., sakti, vyapinl, and samana.

It is to be noted here that both guru and the disciple pass the night in the place of adhivasana. If the disciple sees any inauspicious dream, he reports it to the teacher the next morning.

Then, meditating on the forty-eight sarhsktiras, rites are performed in the body of the '\"newly born child\"; that is, the disciple, through contact with Brahma, Vi~r:iu, Rudra, Isvara. Sadasiva, and Siva, located in the hrda)'a, kantlza, talu, ghrumadhya, lala,ta, and brahmarandhra, respectively. The eight rites of purification are meditated upon differently in each of the six centers. Thus the number becomes complete, and as a result the disciple becomes twice born (dvlja). Then, causing the pra7Ja of the disciple to rest in the respective places for a while, the teacher comes out and gives him the mantra along with flow-ers. Then he tells him the code of conduct (samaya) which he should follow as long as he lives. Chapter Fourteen This chapter describes the procedure of initiation called putraka. On the third day after anointment, a ma~ifi.ala or diagram con-sisting of three tridents with a lotus on each prong is drawn on the ground. All the rituals described in this chapter are to be performed in relation to it. Those groups of deities called the \"external retinues\" and the \"deities at the door\" are worshipped outside. Then, in front of the mandala, moving from northeast to southeast, Ganefa, one's teach~r· (guru), the teacher's teacher (paramagurus), the lineage of previous teachers, the yoginis. the Goddess of Speech (VagISvarI), and k!jetrapalas are worshipped. After receiving their permission, the teacher worships the nine paths (adhvas) in the tridents. On the middle prong of the middle-most trident, ,the Goddess Sripara and Bhai rava are worshipped: the Goddess Sriapara is worshipped on the left, and the Goddess Sriparapara on the right. On the trident to the right, Srlparapara is placed in the middle prong, while on the trident to the left Srrnpara is placed in the middle. Bhagavan is the supreme Goddess, and because of her presence everywhere, all activities become perfect."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 41 and therefore all the rituals should be performed in the middle-most prong of the middle trident. Then, the teacher meditates on the unification of the jar (kumbha), kalasa, ma~z(lala, agni, and the self as one. He cog-nizes the all-pervading aham as being present everywhere through the method known as mantranadi prayoga. He sees to it that all the articles for the ritual are not collected in a miserly way. If the person is poor, on the other hand, maha-ma~z(lala yaga is not recommended. Then, the author describes animal sacrifice (pasu homa). When it is complete, the teacher brings the disciple in front of him and performs al 1 the adlzvanyasas in his body, and purifies his inauspicious deeds, provided he is desirous of blzoga. In the case of the disciple who desires mok$a, both his auspicious and inaus-picious deeds should be purified. Then, the teacher, reflecting on the main mantra, purifies all the adhvas abiding in the disciple's body, meditating on the nondual nature of Siva. After attaining oneness of consciousness, the teacher abides in the body of the disciple from his toes to the top of his head, and having absorbed the consciousness of the disciple's body, the teacher rests, along with the disciple, in the ocean of bliss, which is in essence the wealth of freedom. The teacher merges along with him into the Lord, resplendent with icclza, jiiana. and kriya. Thus, the disciple becomes non-different from the Lord. If the disciple is desirous of blzoga, the teacher unites him with that par-ticular principle. Finally. the teacher bestows on him a pure body for performing deeds in mundane life. Chapter Fifteen This chapter describes the initiation given to a dying person. The recipient of such a dik$ti is a person who has been suffering from an incurable disease. The teacher, after making nyflsa of all the adlzvas in him and purifying them one after the other, performs a ny{/sa called marmakartanl, by which he severs all the delicate"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"42 TANTRASARA joints and brings his consciousness to brahmarandhra. For the purpose of unification (yojana), he then offers the final oblation into the fire. Thus, the disciple becomes one with Paramasiva. Chapter Sixteen In this chapter, the author describes the method of initiation that is given to those who are dead and who are not present during the procedure. For the purpose of bestowing it on the departed soul, the teacher brings nearby a device known as mahajala prayoga, the application of a large net. To the person who is absent but not dead, this procedure is not followed. Chapter Seventeen This chapter gives the procedure known as liligoddhdra: it simply means \"rescuing a person from a fallen state.\" It is performed for o_ne who has gone away from the right track by receiving i nitia-tion from persons belonging to other systems, such as Vai~1)ava, Bauddha, and other lower Saiva schools. However, the teacher will ~ran.t this type of initiation only when he becomes convinced that saktzpata ~as definitely occurred in a prospective disciple. Accord,1?g to the author, the Trika is the superior system, for all the oth~r sastras, as preached by Kapila and others, lead the seeker to attam release from prakrti, but they do not help him attain release fr.om n1llya. On the other hand, Saivcigamas. as expounded by the Tnka, lead everybody to the ultimate immediately. Chapter Eighteen In this chapter the method of abhiseka is described. Abhiseka is given both to putraka and accirya types of disciples, provided they have received the sablja form of initiation. The term sabzja means \"with seed,\" but it really signifies that this form of initiation is given to those who are competent enough to follow certain strict"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 43 rules of conduct during their lifetime. On the other hand, the nir-bija form of initiation is given to old and decrepit persons who are less assiduous and therefore unable to follow strict codes of con-duct as enjoined by the holy text. Ahhi~eka is restrictive in the sense that not everybody is con-sidered competent enough to receive it. In particular, acarytibhi-~eka is given to those who, after receiving initiation, have attained proficiency in tigamic knowledge; those who have restraint over their body, mind, and speech; those who follow the duties as enjoined by the scripture; those who have become proficient in unification of the adhvas in their respective order (adhvtinusan-dhana); those who have gained perfection in the highest knowl-edge by 1 istening to it from their teacher; and those who continue mental exertion for retaining it, followed by meditative thought (fruta, cinta, and bhavana) terminating in identity with Siva. The author categorically states that even after receiving abhi~eka, only one who has really attained perfection in the highest knowledge is worthy of bestowing grace to others. Chapter Nineteen The funeral sacrifice is the final rite for every human being. Ini-tiation is given during that period only to a person who, though he belonged to the highest Saiva order. on account of some unknown factor lost the tradition and expired without performing the rites of atonement before death. Such a person is given initiation when his body is placed on the funeral pyre. For the purpose of rescuing the deceased, all the rituals are performed upon the body. The final offering into the fire (pllr-nahuti) is performed by burning the body. In order to convince ignorant people, the person who initiates causes the dead body to shake. He does this by means of kriyll, j1hlna, and yoga. though it is not necessary for the release of the soul. If the deceased person cannot he given initiation during the burning of his corpse, he may be given initiation during his frad-"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"44 TANTRASARA dha rite. The teacher takes a ball of rice in his hand and meditates on it as the form of the energizing Sak ti, and by doing so, the soul of the dead person is possessed. This food is considered to be the portion of animal-like quality of the soul and is really the thing to be enjoyed. When both the bhogya and bhogya sakti become uni-fied by the meditation of the acarya, it becomes fit to be offered to the supreme enjoyer, the Lord. Thus, leaving the animalistic portion behind, which is the essence of the bhogya, the bhogya sakti, along with the self, is offered to the supreme bhokta, the Lord. In this way, the soul becomes identical with Him. It should be remembered that the final procedure is preceded by the homa sacrifice and other rituals. In this chapter, the author raises a relevant question: whether for the knower of reality (tattva jnanin), rituals such as sraddha and others are necessary or not. He answers saying that when, by the light of true knowledge, darkness has been totally removed from the enlightened one, there is no need of a final ritual like antye~ti fraddha, etc. But, for the people who had been closely associated with the departed one, the day of his unification with the Supreme is observed as a day of parva, the day which causes fullness of consciousness in him. Chapter Twenty ~he present section discusses the disciple's obligations, known as se~avartana, the duties that should be carried out unti 1 the end of h.is life. T~e~e ?uties are of three kinds: obligatory (nitya}, occa-s10nal (namzztttka), and krunya, those performed for the fulfill-ment of some desire. The nitya procedure is described in the following way: One should get up early in the morning and call to mind one's desired deity first. After completing his essential activities, 1 i ke wash-ing, etc., and cleansing himself, he should take his seat facing north. He then purifies his body, the place where he sits, and his mind. Then he performs nyasa upon the appropriate places with"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 45 the mantra, followed by displaying an appropriate mudrti. Then he performs dhyana in two ways: first, abiding in duality, and then in a mixed dual-nondual way. Next, mental worship of the deity is performed in the body, then in pra~w, in the intellect, and finally in the void (vyoma). This is followed by japa, and finally the completed sequence of worship is offered to the deity. All this is to be performed every day, in every sandhya, for the purpose of achieving identification with the deity. Four sandhyas have been mentioned in Chapter Six. According to the author, through medi-tation during sandhya, endless absorption (anantatanmayi bhava) in the Supreme comes about, which in turn gives birth to a lasting state. The worshipper should worship his deity in the altar (sthm:z-(1.ila). He should view it as a clear sky with the characteristics of consciousness, where all the deities are shining as reflected therein. Viewing bare open ground really signifies invocation (avahana). This practice ensures that the disciple identifies with the desired deity and the highest mantra. Invocation of the all-pervading Lord is not possible; only desire (vasana) for the Lord is invoked and drawn within, since the great Lord can neither be invoked or withdrawn. The person who is totally absorbed in the highest mantra in the way stated above becomes free from the stains of animal proclivi-ties and is finally able to put an end to all bonds by the blow of bhakti. After that, whatever remains is the most agreeable object for the worshipper. Then, the author describes the activities related to the parvas, which are performed occasionally by the disciple. Chapter Twenty-One This chapter presents the authority of agamas. In the Tantra/aka, agama has been defined as a well-known fact of old, as prasid-dhi. It also emphasizes the point that even agreement and contra-riety (anvaya and vyatireka), which are the very life of inference."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"46 TANTRASARA also depend on prasiddhi. Similarly, perception looks for prasid-dhi as its support; for without its help, which is thought to be of the nature of self-reflection (svtitmavimarsatmika prasiddhi), it would not be possible to consider anything as acceptable or avoid-able. Therefore, prasiddhi lies at the root of every worldly transac-tion. The great Lord, who is all-perfect, with the characteristic of I-consciousness, and who is omniscient, is the source of all pra-siddhis. He, the Lord is adorned with a multitude of prasiddlzis with the form of enjoy~ent (bhoga) and release (apava rga). The entire universe is of the nature of consciousness, which is nothing but reflective nature, and that again is, in essence. sound. The reflection (vimarfanam) of objects contained hy the univers_e. and of the diverse relations of past deeds and their result~. is known as holy texts (sastra). All the sastras are not really d1ffer-e~t from the nature of Paramesvara. The holy texts have a single aim; yet, because of the limiting condition of niyati, people are strongly attached to only a portion of them. Therefore, some fol-low the dual system and others are attached to the nondual. In the end, the author concludes that a particular agama should be resorted to only after it has been shown to produce excel Jent results. Chapter Twenty-Two This last ch . -l Id b apter explams the nature of Kulacara. It s 1ou e noted at the outset that this form of worship is not meant for every-body b · the.' ~t 1~ only for those who are well advanced, and in whom mchnat1on for performing such rituals has grown strong: only b~c.ause of this are they entitled to perform th is worship of the divme according to this method. .

One who has plunged into the secret of this ritual and follows its course is really endowed with the highest knowledge. Therefore, Jayaratha writes in his commentary on Tantraloka 29: 102 that those great souls who are really free from vikalpas take up this course, as pre-scribed by the Kula system. Particularly, they follow the course only to see if their mind, in the presence of allurements, is truly steady in pure consciousness (Sa!Jzvidadvaite) or not. For this rea-son, they do not think it immoral to practice in the company of female partners (duti). Kula ritual is performed in six different ways, namely: (1) externally, (2) in sakti, (3) in one's own body, (4) in the unity of both male and female, (5) in the vital energy, and (6) in conscious-ness. The worshippers are of two kinds: those who desire enjoy-ment (siddhis) and those desirous of liberation (mukti). Those desirous of siddhis should perform kulayaga according to the methods listed as second, fourth, and fifth, while those who desire liberation should perform the sixth. The author gives a short description of each of the methods in a cryptic way. In the past, the tradition was to be handed down orally, only to those qualified; therefore, many of the matters are not very clear to us. Therefore, we prefer to say little about this secret cult.

One of the pair is Vimalakala, the mother who has taken within herself a new creation (Abhi-nava) in the form of light, and the other is the father, Pancamukha Siri1hagupta, who is the embodiment of perfection and is intent on expressing himself in the fivefold activity. Exposition: The above benedictory verse hints at a number of technical terms or concepts commonly used in the doctrine of Trika Saivism. In this context, the word heart (lzrdaya) indicates universal hliss (jagadananda), which unifies everything into an undivided singularity of consciousness. Its form is an ever-shin-ing light, knowing neither rising nor setting. Restfulness is its very nature. The author as pi res to attain and realize that heart of C()nsciousness. Another technical term found in this verse is vamala, which is described as the highest equilibrium, [a union] .of both Siva and 51"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"52 TANTRASARA Sakti. This is a union in which Siva is neither Siva nor Sakti, and Sakti is neither Sakti nor Siva, but each is the combined union of both. This union is also known as coitus (salizgaf,fa). In the creative process, [expanding from] this union, all the principles, known as tattvas, emerge. Throughout this process of creation, the nondual nature of the absolute equilibrium remains tranquil, like a waveless ocean. This process of creation is the result of a slight impulse of creativity, an upsurge in the form of a vibrating agitation, causing the unity to break. This absolute union (yamala, smizgaffa) remains in its pristine state, even in the process of cre-a~~on. Dur!ng that process of creation, 'It' first shows itself as two [Siva and Sakti], expanding outward into three, and then many. The word kula ordinarily means 'body,' but in this context it refers to the seventeenth kala, the immortal phase of the moon. The word visarga is the 'emission of drops' emerging from perfect ~exual union. The drops reflect the colors of [Siva and Sakti]: one is white and the other red. It tends to move outside [into the mani-fested universe] and creates the bodies of all living beings. In the Tantric doctrine, visarga is stated to be hardhakala, one-half of t .. ~e sound 'ha.' The mother is none but the autonomous energy of Sr~'a, with whom she remains inseparably united. The nature of t?1s autonomous energy, which is beyond all limitations, is 'reflec-tive awareness' (vimarfa). This verse also indicates that Vima-lakala ;vas the name of Abhinava's mother. The father is the five-faced .Siva [with each face represented by one] of the five saktis: c_onsc10usness, bliss, will, knowledge, and action. They are the five .outlet~ through which everything becomes manifest, or in the lummo~s imagery Abhinavagupta often employs, through which the entire universe shines. Each of Siva's 'faces' is ever-engaged in performing one of his five functions through these .foktis. These five functions are: creation, maintenance, dissolution, veiling, and bestowing grace. ru C\"1 cHfF?l 1 Ml Cf.>1 ru J 11 f% cj) ~Cf ~ I Cf\\'Jl ci ~: I *IJj)cfcFi ru '<fa C\"1 f1\"l ci ~ a '01 f1 I;( (l<l:\" ~UJR I I ~ I I"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"TANTRASARA 53 As everyone is not capable of delving deep into the long text of the Tantrtiloka, this Tantrastira is composed in simple language.

Ignorance is twofold.1 One abides in the intellect (buddhigata), and the other lies in the self (paztru$a). The one which abides in the intellect is ignorance of the nature of real-ity (anifrayasvabhavam) and an erroneous conception of the Self as non-self (viparltanifraya). On the other hand, the ignorance lying in the self (pauru~a) is of the nature of thought-constructs (vikalpa), characterized by a limited form of the light of con-sciousness. This type of ignorance is the root cause of worldly existence. This topic will be discussed in the section dealing with the nature of impurity (mala). The ignorance abiding in the self (pauru~a) can be removed by means of initiation and other similar procedures. However, even initiation in the presence of the igno-:ance characterized by indeterminacy (anadhyavasaya) remains meffective. This is because initiation is preceded by a determinate conviction as to what is to be accepted and what is to be rejected, and is followed by the purification of the principles (tattvas) and unification with Siva. Thus, the attainment of that determinative k?owledge steadily abiding in the plane of the intellect is the prin-~ipal factor. Indeed, this practice uproots the ignorance abiding 1~ the self (pauru~a), because when consciousness in the form of vzkalpa is practiced, it ultimately terminates in consciousness free from vikalpa. 2 The Self (atma) is the light of consciousness (prakasa) free from the li}llitation of thought-constructs (vikalpa), and is the very nature of Siva. Therefore, the attainment of the 'right knowledge ?fa deter.minate nature' (samyannifrayatmaka171 jiianam) regard-mg all Objects in every respect is desirable. The attainment of this knowledge is preceded by study of the holy texts (fastras). The holy texts are authoritative, as they are revealed by the highest Lord (Paramesvara). The subject matter as enunciated by other scrip-tures is accepted as distinct, not directly related to the totality of know1edge, and is proved by arguments not directly related to that subject matter. Therefore, the knowledge taught in other holy texts (agamas) is said to grant liberation only up to a certain extent. but"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"TANTRASARA 55 not from all bondage. On the other hand, the holy texts revealed by the Lord Paramesvara bestow release from all sorts of bondage. The holy texts (taught by Paramesvara) come in a fivefold stream3 and are divided into groups of ten, eighteen, and sixty-four. The most perfect among them are the texts named Trika, the quintes-sence of which is the Malinlvijaya tantra. The subject matter con-tained therein is difficult to gather and properly elucidate. Without the proper ascertainment of the essence of reality, this knowledge neither possesses the property of liberation nor is instrumental in granting it. It is only unblemished knowledge that possesses such a nature. The highest human end has its root in knowledge, which should be practiced in one's own being.

C1?f ~ru~ ~~:mr3qfd:~;qci I Introduction In this world, 'innate nature' (svabhava)4 is the highest aim to be attained. This innate nature belonging to all entities is of the nature of 'light' (prakasa), 5 as that which is not 1 ight cannot be proved to be this innate nature. Furthermore, that 1 ight is only one [literally translated: 'it is not more than one'], for there is an absence of existence of any other innate nature in that light which is different from it. This is because of the non-existence of dif-ferentiation in that light. Time and space cannot bring or cause differentiation in it, for they possess that 1 ight as their innermost nature. Therefore, the light is indeed only one, and that 1 ight alone is consciousness. The nature of consciousness is to bring illumina-tion [manifestation] to all objects. In this regard there is no differ-ence of opinion among scholars. This shining of that light is not dependent on anything outside of itself. The state of being illuminated by another 1 ight should certainly be called dependence, as the state of being illuminated"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"TANTRASARA 57 depends on others for its illumination. However, in the absence of any other 1 ight, there is only this single and 'autonomous' (svatan-tra) light. It is precisely because of this independence that this light is not limited by time, space, or form. Therefore, it is all pervasive, eternal, and it has characteristics of being omniform, and at the same time it is devoid of any definite or specific form.6 The freedom belonging to that light is its energy of bliss (ananda), its relish of delight (camatkara) is its energy of will, its illumina-tion is its energy of consciousness, its cognizance is its energy of knowledge, and its association with all forms is its energy of activity. In this way, although associated with the above principal energies, this unlimited light of the nature of Siva remains resting in its own bliss. Being of this nature, he, in the process of unfold-ing or manifesting, takes on a limited form because of his freedom. Therefore, he is designated as atomic (a~rn). Then, he manifests himself as autonomous so that he again shines as that unlimited light of the nature of Siva.7 In this process, he manifests his own Self by the force of his own power of freedom either with or with-out 'means' (upaya). If he manifests himself with means, then the iccha, jiicl na, and kriyasaktis are used as the means. In this way, the means appear to be threefold and the [state of] absorption (sanulvesa)8 is then divided into sambhava, stikta. and ti~zava.

In this instance, reasonmg alone (tarka eva) is taken to be a limb of yoga. Other-wise, how could discernment be possible? If this is the question. we reply: What can be accomplished by ·means' (upaya) regard-ing the supreme Lord who is self-manifest and one's own self? This cannot be the attainment of 'innate nature'(svah/u/w1), as innate nature is eternally present; it cannot be the attainment of the recognition (jiiapti) of Paramesvara, as Paramesvara is self-iJJuminating; it cannot be the removal of the veils, as the existence of any veils [in that supreme reality] is impossible~ it cannot be the penetration of one into the other, as the one who is enter-"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"TANTRASARA 59 ing and the one who is entered into are not different from each other. Then, what could the role of upaya be, as the existence of anything separate from that reality cannot be proved? Therefore, the entire universe is a unique consciousness alone, beyond the mutation of time and limitation of space. Furthermore, this con-sciousness is unaffected by the \"accidental attributes\" (upadhi); it is not restricted by shape and form; it cannot be conveyed by words; nor be described by the instruments of knowledge. It is the cause (nimitta) of the very nature of time, down to the instruments of valid knowledge, manifested by his free will. In essence, it is an autonomous, condensed bliss, which is \"I\" myself (aham). In that innermost core of mine, the universe shines as a reflection. The absorption related to the supreme Lord, [attained by] one who discerns with firm conviction in this way, is not dependent on any means. This kind of person does not need to be restrained by dis-ciplines, such as taking recourse to sacred syllables, rituals, medi-tation, and observance of spiritual practices. 3q1lfoi1ri ;:i-rnct s:tct51~1il(\\ U\"t;:r RB mfu fH5 f.i ctl fUfu: I ru a -a~ rn <ta Jj)G: 1-<c;:~f;:i = ~s:tct51~i ~I It.. 11 The multitude of means (upaya) does not reveal Siva.

What follows are the instructions leading to this type of absorption. AIJ these multitudes of beings (bhtivas) are merely reflections in the void of consciousness 14 because they possess the charac-teristic marks of reflection. These are the characteristic marks of reflection. That which cannot shine separately, but shines when merged with others, is known as reflection; for example, the reflection of the shape or form of the face in a mirror, the reflec-tion of a taste in saliva, the reflection of a smell in the nose. the"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"TANTRASARA 61 reflection of sexual touch in the organ of pleasure, the reflection of a sensation of sharp contact by a spear or lance in the inner organ of touch, or the reflection of an echo in the void. However, this taste is not the original, 15 and being only the effect of that pri-mary principle. it is not known to cure diseases, etc. In the same way, smel I and touch are not considered original because in the absence of the principal subject (gu~zina~1), the existence of smell and touch cou Id not even be postulated, and more so because they do not set in motion any series of effects or results. On the other hand, we cannot say that these two are non-existent, as shaking of the limbs and emission of semen can be seen. Even a sound is not original because someone utters it and the approaching of its echo can be heard. Thus, just as an echo, etc., appears shining as a reflection, similarly the universe is reflected in the light of the Lord. Now, the question can be raised: What is the 'original image' (bimba) of this reflection? The answer is that there is none. Does this mean that the reflection of the universe is without cause? Alas! Your query is then aimed at finding a cause. In that case, what would be the purpose of verbal reasoning? The cause will indeed be the Sakti belonging to the Lord, whose other name is 'autonomy' (svatantrya). This Sakti is the immanence of the Lord because She is the bearer of the reflection of the universe. This universe is permeated with consciousness. and this universe is the locus of the manifestation of that consciousness. That consciousness indeed is this universe in which it is reflected in the reverse order. There-fore, the Lord is designated as the bearer of the reflection. Fur-thermore, the Lord's innate nature. which includes the totality of immanence. cannot be devoid of reflective awareness (amarsa), because the one who is consciousness cannot be devoid of reflec-tive awareness regarding his own Self. If. however, consciousness lacks self-awareness (awareness of its own innate nature), then it would condescend to the level of insentiency (ja{/a).16 Further-more. self-reflective awareness is not created by convention, but is experienced as being inseparable from the innate nature of"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"62 TANTRASARA consciousness, and impregnated with the 'supreme sound· (para-nada).17 This supreme sound reflects all the multitudes of energies belonging to the Lord, which determine this universe. \"ITTf ~'L~lffilqfl ~ ~~ ~lffi~:-~~-~-~lSf ~. ~4'<1JWf~lP=t Jr-~-3~ ~Cif+\"lltlCf Ga~1a ~= ~1f-m~qsa: ~. ~ FQ f%\" fu~~'<I~~=·, $m1~1ilcr fcrmf~ t~. ~lSf l!Cf IB fu~llf~{<)f#: ~ f~~l~I~'): ~. c=re:Cfq'<IA~f?t~~ 3-TT-t-JJ ~ I mf ~mm 4'<PWblct ~iJlllfll'<(\"Cll(\\ ~~f,i=tci'), ~ Y'<:IA~f~ fuf$l Ir~ ti:l mcrr-~t:rR:ml fl1 A I \\J:i Cf) A I ~ l'l I Cl (\"d) A f~ ~>mm ;rITttr 1 'llGJ C1 $~'~'tt ~m ~ CP-4 ~m~ ~elf( $G!:iJ=tlOl'\"\"l ~~~J=tlOl'\"\"l ~-:a-~.

This indeed is the play of the energy of activity (kriya §akti), which"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"64 TANTRASARA shines in the manifestation of the four syllables, that is, ''e,\" ''ai,\" \"o,\" and \"au. \"21 Then, at the end of the development of the power of action (kriya sakti), just before entering anuttara, all that which has been created up to this point takes repose and abides in the bindu22 (m,n), which is light alone and the very essence of knowledge. At that very place where bindu rests in unsurpassed (anuttara), the \"anuttara visarga\" is born, which is ''a~z.\" Thus, the aggregate of sixteen letters, which are seeds (blja). are said to be the very nature of all reflective awarenesses (para marsa). The recipients (yoni), which are consonants. are born from that vi+sarga. From anuttara emerges the \"ka\" group of letters; from 'will without an object' (iccha) the \"ca\" group of letters; from will with an object the \"ta\" and \"ta\" groups of letters: and from unme§a the \"pa\" group ·of letters is born. It is because of being united with five 5aktis that the five groups of letters are produced. It is from this threefold division of the will (icchti) that the semi-vowels \"ya,\" \"ra,\" and \"la\" are born, while the semivowel \"va\" is born from unmesa. The letters \"fa,\" \"sa \" and \"sa\" are created from the threefold division of will (iccha).' From visarga, \"ha\" is born, and the let-ter '·k~a\" arises from the union of two consonants: \"ha\" and \"'sa.\" Thus, the Lord who is supreme (anuttara) becomes the ·Lord of t_he ~~~up of letters' (Kule§vara). It is this single kaulikl visarga sakti -of the Lord, which as the flow of vibrating impulse in the form of reflective cognition (paramarsa) such as groups of letters, etc .. extends from ananda to external manifestation and assumes the f?rm_ of the external principles (tattvas).

When that reality is cognized as eightfold pararnarsa along with cakresvara (the letter k~a), then it is divided into nine groups. Furthermore, if one cognizes that same reality placing the emphasis on each and every individual paramarsa, then it is divided into fifty. Finally, when that real-ity is cognized as existing with possible subtle divisions, then the number becomes eighty-one. In reality, reflective cognitions (para ma rs as) are only six. 26 However, on account of expansion and contraction they become twelve and thus nourish the fullness of the Lord, as the possessor of all the saktis. All these saktis of the Lord, being of the nature of reflecting cognitions, are known as Kalikas, n divine goddesses.

They fail to understand the nature of the supreme reality only because they are devoid of knowledge emerging from omniscience. ~ °ffi~Cl1<t>~lfffiq1Cil~ 1!Q flC!llP=n~UT fckf5ctj fi'Ri1(:q ~ ~ mcrm~ 1 ~ ~ ~ c=rn:i fctdJCVlLi'{<)c:i ~ ? . ~ -f8ct5ftH~ ~~~·Al~ =aRa1~, ~ rrfci C1 \"flcf?r ~fiqft~I 'fq!'iffil~IACf ~ ;:i-ITTT fadSfll: ~~ 3°efct:>Cll4 xga5-=11~ err' a 34fci1<t>~1Risq 1a 1me&:ffl fd<Jiilcr \"fiifm~Cf)c=i Cl 1 ~ ~fu. msm ~cftf~ °filfa1c1 ~ ~ I 3F\"lH\"<:i 311lP1wiJUT ~ t1fcn:~{ m'mYlfl>ld51~12l Cf~ I f-cB C1 11~'1!:1l IA R'{<)qo1 C'Cl 1q I{:, c=rwfuofQ(f)(YY>l{Sl;:a l!Cf ~ ~ 3m:, ~ t!Cf -a-~ ~ 34 ~1G ('Cl I a, ~ 3-T~c=rfl:HH\"tj;1G (\"Cl I q I a2l ;:i-~ -am ~ I ;:i--a Wf flf1d5fct -~J~faW!>id51~1'{C)YICi ?f0\" ~ m11Tef marrc=r 3q1<Jl: -~~= R~ACllfflf, 3-Tf~-iu' Cil=J~Cf)l{ffl', ~~= ~ 1011~ IJ:fqlf~ aUJ=ITef~-;r Q5 ~ ~fqfu &:i I q I\"!:: I ~~I~ 1 '<l sfq Cf)\"{UT~flfBCf mfc=mti wm\"f(, mRUl{DllflAlu-msfq <::rm~ 3:r~lfi¢f5AUT f~l=fFIT m~altlk-~ ~: fcrc=r~~: I 31~.IU ~ ~ ft?1a1,AR ~~ -;r ~~Cf I ~fa~Gffl ~f~ef~Cf){Ul{()C n w 3-TmIB:-~g:~H~11f5l1tlmo-~mw1flaa,. ~f~ C1 ~ fun~ 311C!ICi~ -;r 34Yfl{DTI~A\" ~Cf)~ 3-Tmm: I ' ' Therefore, only those keenly touched hy the energy of Siva,"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"TANTRASARA 69 after following the path of right agama, etc., purify their vikalpas and enter the supreme reality. 36 Here a question can be asked: If this is so, shouldn't the supreme reality also be a form of deter-minate knowledge (vikalpa)? The answer to this question is, \"certainly not,\" because determinate knowledge fulfills its purpose simply by removing the impressions of duality. The supreme reality is everywhere; it is omniform and self-manifesting. The forms of determinate knowledge are not capable of either lending any support to it or refuting it. Right reasoning (sattarka) spontaneously arises in a person keenly touched by sakti. It is said that this kind of person is initiated by the Goddesses. In the case of others, the form of right reasoning arises by the study of scriptures, and so forth. This topic will be discussed at length in the section entitled Saktipataprakasana. However, at this point it will suffice to say that the role of the teacher is to select an appropriate agama text for a disciple to study. The role of agama, on the other hand, is to give rise to the proper type of vikalpa (suddha-vikalpa), which is instrumental in generating the series of homogeneous thoughts free from doubt. This series of homogeneous determinate thoughts is called right reasoning (sat-tarka), and this right reasoning is called meditation (bhavan~). Through bhavanti 37 past objects [objects that have gone to rest 111 the past] that were indistinct, are now made as if present by ren-dering them distinct. In this context we can say that no other direct means but reasoning, which is the light of pure knowledge, can serve as the limb of yoga. For example, tapas, etc., belonging to the niyama group, ahilizsa, etc., belonging to the yama group,38 various types of prti~1tiyama, etc., all are finally based in objec-tive existence. Therefore, what could be their role in regard to consciousness? Even pratytihti rti 39 only renders excellence on the level of senses, that is, the instruments of knowledge and action. In the same way, dhti ra~ul, dh.vana, and samtidhi, if practiced gradually and in th is particular order, could grant to the medita-tor the identification with the object of his meditation. However, meditation or practice on the supreme reality, which is identical"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"70 TANTRASARA with Siva and is one's own innate nature, is not at all possible. The practice of one who is established in consciousness is the process of steadily establishing pra~za, intellect, and body in it.

How-ever, it has already been explained that nothing can he taken away from the supreme reality. Even the impression of duality is not something different from consciousness. It is merely ignorance of one's own essential nature. Therefore, it was said that duality is removed by pure determinate thought (.foddha-vi ka !pa).

Thus, by manifesting [literally 'shin-ing'], following this sequential order, it manifests itself in its full-ness. This shining is the very nature of the Lord, and for that reason the limbs of yoga cannot be the direct means. However, reasoning (tarka) is of great importance here, and right reasoning (sattarka) alone is the direct means. This right reasoning is pure cognition (suddha-vikalpa), which gets purified through differ-ent means, such as through oblation (yoga), offering of food into the fire (homo), repetition of mantra Uapa), religious observances (vrata), yoga, etc. ~ ~ 1 a 1 .-i i ~m ~ ~ 1!Cr ft:vf-a:, .-i 1 ~a mfufttf51=f ' ' 3TIB\" ~ fctct>fY{C)fG;f'~ ~~ 1!Cr ~~ui ml!:, ~ u @~fQI(\\ ~ ~fuq~~ ~~iJCf ~ ~ ~~ ~9Q{ JiLfun:t ~ur @~1.-ii ~1=f(f(fUT1R.mfiaj m%{C)q~1n 3-m:I ~ mar: ~~JITBm ~ ~\"efcict>fYS'll~ ~~faa:.-iMaJff~ fi+:J«l'm Cl ~ I f\"l '<: f f\"l ct> <i I f ~ cn9-\"JIT q I ?I I Cl ~l ~ C\"\"Ci fi 6 fi +:J ta mcrfc:t fl q ;:i °ITT\"+:J: I ~W 3~ ~ 1,A ct> q { 1A~11G:m~ mtUTCJZi ~\"' 1fu>m~cm:r~1Cl1 .-i q amcr ~ -futi Clfl \"Cf{ ~ ~mer~ ~ ~ q{IA~f;:f Jrq:\" I ~?r ~~ F= 1{)41Ci4'<:A~~AHC'11~ ~~cHfi+:JcilftmR-;::r ~~ umefq 3-icffITep-;::j-~ 1 <:rmffi m-;::rf ..-a:~ 1 ~ 1 Ci 1 +:j , .. . • • • • • . . ~\"fITRi ~ ' ' wn=t 1 ' ~ 1 ~ fcrf~= ~~crm~= ruct5ftl: ~ ~f~ct5r-Y ~~crcf5 ~clc=rn:f >I ct5 I~ I a ~Cf f\"l ;:i I a ;:i a wfcrEJ >I ct5 I~ I+:!

This Sakti is expressed by these and other appellations based on various grammatical derivations, which are technical terms used in the agamas. Let this Sakti abide in any of these forms in the heart of a meditator. If this Sak ti is viewed collectively, as consisting of the totality of all saktis, the fullness of consciousness becomes mani-fest. The Lord possesses innumerable dynamic energies (saktis). What more can we say? The entire universe is his sakti. There-fore, it is impossible to enumerate all of them in this instruction. However, the whole universe can be summed up under three main saktis. The supreme energy (Sriparafakti) of the Lord is that sakti by means of which this universe, beginning with Siva and ending with earth principle (tattva), is born, seen, and manifested by the Lord in indeterminate consciousness. Sriparaparafakti of the Lord is that sakti by means of which he projects the universe just like the reflection of an elephant, etc., in a mirror: as different-cum-nondifferent.

After this, the portion of entity shining as doubt, which is going to be dissolved, is assimilated (kalayati) within the self th rough the process of withdrawal. 6. Then it creates (kalayati) the agent of withdrawal and realizes it as being his own Self. 7. In the process of creating (kalayati) the agent of with-drawal, it creates some entities as existing in the form of impressions (vtisantis) and some others as existing in the form of consciousness alone. 8. Then it creates the wheel of instruments (of knowledge and action), preceded by the process of the activity of manifesting its own nature. 9. Next it shapes (kalayati) the lords of the instruments. 10. Then it creates (kalayati) the limited subject belonging to the level of mtiyti. 11. After this it creates (kalayati) the knowing subject, who is intent on abandoning limitations and accepting the blissful state of consciousness. 12. Next it manifests (kalayati) the fully bloomed form of his own Self. Thus, the \"twelve divine Goddesses of consciousness' (dvadasa Bhagm·a tya ~1) manifest themselves, either to all subjects or only one, simultaneously or sequentially, either in two or three.

For this very purpose, Vidyadhipati has made great effort in his monograms entitled \"AnubhavaStotra. '' . Thus, in each of these five, beginning with ytiga and ending with yoga, there are different levels of steadiness to be attained.47 One should act in such a way that one may attain a steady convic-tion in them. This kind of yogin should not think, \"This food is sanctioned and th is food is prohibited, or this is pure and this is impure,\" and in this way cause suffering to his own self. Purity, impurity, etc., are not invariable properties belonging to the object, but in essence. products of the imagination. Thus, it is stated in the Srrpo rva :48 \"Purity is not the essential attribute of an object in the same way as the property of being blue. etc., is not the essential nature of an object, for it has been stated to be impure on other occasions.\" In (the case of) an offering of gifts to one who has been initiated, if it is argued that because of directive statement (codana), this offering of gifts is impure with refer~nce to that (directive statement), then it is similar to some other direc-tive statement (codantintara) which may contradict the former. ~ut such a contradictory directive statement is unreal because of [this] incongruity-if it is so argued, then we say, ··no,\" that is not right. The directive statement uttered by Lord Siva himself is sufficiently forceful to annul other directive precepts. It is well-supported by logical reasoning, and also [well-established] in numberless tiga-mas like the Sarvajllanottara and others. We shall speak of it lat.er in the sequel. Therefore, the rule which is enjoined, in the scrip-tures, as the precept to be followed and the thing that is to be prohibited, beginning from the Vedas down to the Tantras of the Lord as understood by the Siddhantins, such as Kulocclzu!jlllG and others, serves no purpose in this context: therefore the truth of the matter is established. In the Srrpo rva and other texts it has been so stated. One should seek a detailed account of it in the TantrMoka and other texts.

The perfect yogin should always be mindful that a firm conviction of the aforesaid nature should be attained.

This pro-cess was explained in the previous chapter. When, for the purification of discursive thought (vikalpa), one needs to rely on the ·means' (upaya), then he or she can take recourse in the intellect (buddlzi), pr{i~w. body, jar, and other external objects of a limited nature.50 By doing this, one descends to the level of an atom (a~1u) and causes the 'knowledge of limited nature' (cl~10va) to manifest in his soul. On that level the bud-dhi possesses a meditative nature, and prd~w is of two kinds:51 gross and subtle. The former is of the nature of moving upward"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"80 TANTRASARA (uccarm:w). This moving upward possesses five modalities: pra~za, apana, samana, udana, and vyana. The subtle form of pra~za is denoted by the syllabic sound (vanza), which will be explained later. The body, possessing a specific type of arrangement, is denoted by the word kara~za.52 Jars and so forth are external objects, which will be described as the means for the purpose of worshipping the altar and the phallic form (liliga). Among all of these means, it is appropriate to give instruc-tion regarding meditation first. It has already been pointed out that the self-shining supreme reality exists externally in all the principles (tattvas). Having meditated on that supreme reality in the heart of one's own consciousness, 53 one should then meditate on the close union of the three, which are fire, the sun. and the moon. In this context, fire stands for the knowing subject, the sun for the instrument of knowledge, and the moon for the knowable objects. One should meditate in this way as long as Bhairava's fire is not manifested by the fanning of the air in the form of meditation. This fire is to be conceived as being encompassed by the aforesaid twelve flames of energy, 54 assuming the form of the \"wheel,\" out of which these energies emerge th rough one of the outlets. such as the eyes, and take their repose on the objective level. .While it is resting [on the objective level], one should first conceive of it as being externally replenished by the moon in the order of creation. Then, it should be conceived of as being made manifest by the sun in the order of maintenance. Further. it should b.e conce~ved as being made to dissolve by the all-encompassing fire of withdrawal. 55 Finally, it should be conceived of as being merged into transcendence in order to become one with it. In this way. the \"wheel\" attains fullness with no difference from ohjective existence. Then, one should meditate by means of that \"\"wheel\" on the residual traces that remain from the entities, and should dis-solve them in a similar fashion. 56 The person who persists with this practice of meditation attains the firm conviction that the series of creation, maintenance, and dissolution are in essence nothing but his own consciousness, which in reality is freedom (sva tantr_va)."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"TANTRASARA 81 shining as creation belonging to one's own innate consciousness. In this way, one realizes the state of Bhairava without delay. However, it is only through practice that one attains all sorts of desired goals. One should meditate in the blissful and luminous abode of one's heart as the self-manifest, integral unity of the Self consisting of three, that is, knower, knowledge, and object of knowledge, having brought them into the core of his heart. One should meditate on the Lord, the all-pervading One, the Lord of the \"wheel\" presiding over those twelve powers of its rays, who is emerging outwardly through the outlets (voids, vyoma), and is the agent of creation, and so on. The yogin should meditate on the totality of entities, both external and internal, which have been dissolved into the Self and are going to take repose (vifranti) therein. Thus, the light of the Self shines forth. 3l~ 3iill'<: I c=r?r ~ 3Thcicil{~: ~cf ~ l!Cf ~~ fu~, C1ffi ~ mul~, c=rc=ITsfq we_ti >ffcl 3i q I Ti ci \"\"f'I ~~;:i-\"ffCTf~ ~, C1c1: ~{ct515~aTI ~. c=rc=r: flAHl~ ~~mf~ ~~, C1<1 JG: H Cl ttq)~ +:rrc=p~0flfuct5fH I ~ I c=f?\\~ I fl CBC! ~s:i ~I ii ~~ \"ffCTf ct m tl a :r:u:r: ~ I l!Cf\" ~~ \"s:l\"~fu ~HI Tfi m l!fIT fu~ I \"\"fl <:i: ill l!Cf RJ\"I HT\"G.l, R'<:H~:, q{H;:c\\l, ~6JH;:c\\l, A~H~:, f=aa:1+=a: ~ ~ ~~l=f(:f Nf~, l:i I fl I l=l l!aJ: ~~men JG: <Ji I 'ttl A <:if CfITT-;::r: ~ rfcfmf;;:aq{Jiltl~ JllltllTi~: I (f(l ~ 3WR~~ ~cj;) ~~ \"fl\"Cfm err fu WR:1 ~ Ci~ 6 s:i I a 11 fumf'c=rftfi') fu mf\"\"fl Ci~ J:L 3i I fl I G: <Ji fu I cracr ~f~~JIT1:1cil'<:Ol'<:6fflJ:L ~~Cft,Tf{ fcict>fci ~~~, ~ \"\"a\" fumf~ ~cB LfXT ~ ~~ ~~ICil'<:CilR\"'ilCi,I c=r?r s:i IJ I H ~: ~ufai~ I fq ~If~, c=ICl ~ a-TUi Fl:~ I {l wmi ~=, \"CiC1: C:5l=q:"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"82 TANTRASARA fefckilctJI~ aek11G:lc-Ri~1r~, CttJl Rw-~~M<Ql<\"t I ~ 3\"1'ilc-AR 3WB~ ffi~ 'tC!lc-A\"i: °ffcfJ:Jli(\"qlft ~ ~~ fuffi\"r«l ~, 31ffi -qf uf: A e: 1 Cll I LflY)~ 1 m 1!ill J1 1 ~ c: 1 ~~+:f(:1: f?ra5 'to1Cf);e:@tllfJ;pfg)105ffl;:f)actJ~d~l cmn~ I ~ 3L;a1\"1Ja$'11;:cti ~ q-{ ~ l I frkl I~~~ a ti I \"[.fW 3 f ;;q tj dci I <:i ~-CB f ;+ff'~ti I cracr fM ~f51 iq '\"\"t, -qrn feflcH1{ I ~ qT?r ffiW mD'Hl~C!:li'\"\"t I m ~~ ~~~{C)qa1 flCbl t:lrnctSl'<i lc-Rili I IQ IAC'1{ClYC\"1l G:~ \"i ru fPTCbfl I fd ~I f.;.:a fl Im $~fl A I ' ' 3\"I ~ ct5 I~ I : ~ 3\"1 'j)~ a ~I : I ~~u~wm fu~ \"4zj q Rcr'{~ a 1 ~S?rfu~ AIQil<:i-fumnm~ \"fl~ I I oq I l0Q I~ fu.smR:ffu ill ~ ~: ~-mc5~m<:r~I ~IOllCilQl --fffl\"\"i\"&J ~~ gqxr: I I 31~1*1Pl~'1s?r ~ ~Rcfi~'\\ -fcn:m~w:i~ruQ:ur ~ 1 ~ 3\"I Hi'<~ Ml CB I : I ~ 3 i::£ll '< o 1 '\"\"t I Now, the topic related to the 'upward movement' (uccara~w) of the vital energy (pra~w): One desirous of moving his vital energy upward (uccti ra) should first make it rest (vifranti) in the heart, 57 the void, and then through the rising of pra~za should have it rest in external ohjects. Pra~za should rise there while being replenished by the moon of apana, by means of which one experiences one's a 11-i nc I usive nature and becomes indifferent to everything disti net from the Self. With the rise of samana, balanced energy, one experiences the state of unification of all objects. which then rest in a state of repose. Then. with the rise of the fire of udana, the limit-"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"TANTRASARA 83 ing distinction between subjectivity and objectivity is dissolved. With this consuming fire, which devours objects, knower, and knowledge, and with the subsiding and rising of vytina, the high-est knower, free from limitation, becomes manifest. Thus, it is explained that all the 'stages of rest' (visrtinti) beginning with void (sunya) and ending with vytina, are all different stages of bliss. They are as follows: nijananda,58 nirtinanda, 59 partinanda, 60 brahrnananda, 61 mahananda, 62 and cidananda. 63 Universal bliss Uagadananda) is the one blissful state, which unifies all the other six states mentioned above. This universal bliss is free from rising and setting, and is repose in one's own Self. One should take rest, either in two [different] ways or in every respect, on one of the fiveprti~zas in any of the stages of uccara~za. By doing this, one is able to attain the reality of the 'truth of repose' (viirantitattvam), which is different from body, pra ~za, and so on. This is indeed the secret of pronouncing the seed mantras of creation \"sa\" and dis-solution '\"ha.\" By continued unification of these two syllables one should purify discursive thoughts (vikalpa). The above-mentioned 'stages of rest' have five stages, each of which depends on the comparative proficiency of the practitioner in absorption. However. if one is well practiced in the above means, then the 'bliss comes in the beginning' (pragtinanda)6.i because of the glimpse of the fullness of the Absolute. As a result of this, an 'upsurge' (udbhava) takes place for a moment as one gains the firm conviction that he is free from the body. After this, 'shaking' (kampa) fol lows because the conviction that the Self is identical to the body has been loosened by the overpowering nature of one's 'potentiality' (bala). This is followed by the 'void of sleep' (nidrtt) as the tendency toward externality disappears. In this way, the notion of the self dissolves in the nonself, and the notion of the nonself dissolves in the Self because the Self is of the nature of all. Then the yogin experiences 'great expansion' (malulvydpti), hav-ing 'firmly rooted himself in the truth' (satyapada), upon which a 'whirl' (ghlir~zi) takes place. All of these are the stages of the states of consciousness, which begin with the 'waking state' (jttgraf),65"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"84 TANTRASARA and end with the state 'beyond the fourth' (turyatlta). These stages become manifest when a yo gin enters the triangle, i.e., the 'bulb' (kanda), the heart, and the palate cakras, and the higher 'coiled state' of sakti (ardhvaku~z(ialinl). That state, where the 'moving upward' (uccara) of the vital energy has its repose (vifranti), where the entity of knowables has dissolved into a 'tran-scendent vibration' (para1J1spandam), where knowables appear in a budding state, and where they where they have fu I ly blossomed, [that state] is known as threefold li1iga. 66 The nature of this three-fold liliga will be described when the occasion for that arises. The highest liliga according to this system is cal led 'I-lea rt of Yoginf' (Yoginihrdaya). Of the above, the principal one is characterized by vibration. When this vibration expresses itself in the form of contraction and expansion with the nature of the 'unity of the two' (y~mala), it attains repose with the form of the 'subtle emission' (visargakalci). Here, I should stop revealing esoteric secrets. The entrance into it (samavesa), however, remains unrevealed. In the beginning, one remains steadily established in one's own innate consciousness; then by 'repose in the object' (prameye viframya), one fills the knowable. !hen he quickly dissolves the distinctions of subjectiv-ity and objectivity, and takes rest. Thro~gh expansion one experiences repose [(vi §ra 11 ti)] on different levels. These levels are six, along with the void (sllnya), and as such they serve as the means. Waking and other states remain merged in this fivefold pra~w, beginning withpra~za and ending with vyllna. One well established in the above is able to ascend to (~r become established in) the abode of the creation and dissolution of 'self-awareness' (vimar.fo). ~[f ~ a-i:rn Io 11 c-A I quf: I 3IT~ l!Cf mm ~ 3ieliffilicpf-c=rmm ~-;:r: cruf: I ~"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"TANTRASARA 85 ef~~:Tf ~-&:t ~, c=rcr~ 1fl1 fl q '<fi fct R=rcr=rrw, <=r~ -cnm ~ ~ ~ err 3-F=a '<\"n:>ci 1 R-R ~ err fl A fct ~ 1 tt;: fi fct RtFG:~ ~f:, flAlil\"\"\"P~f~ qf~uf:, flAlilqfeauTisfq ~ \"fl\"G:~mcrc:PT ~'<1~1fG:cR=( ~~fctrttl~lffl ~qx1@fd50~~~ mct~11Tf!tF:i ~ -a-~wm~ ~ cruf'<~ffl~ I 3iTf1:4.,'<f~;::i;::a{f!Jj)~ fffCiqla l~Tf!{ ~ 3C§'IO?O:n:i1;:j fifctct~ 3-9~1C1lifci ~ chf~:k\"l I Cil\"CAfct{~UI ~ -' ~.-c!:l~~cf.,J1f°aR'<.ltlT~ I ~C1~~a~11C\"=t ~ -fuIDJffY05qoffctur 11 ~ 3-ilTfl'<~fllW I ~ qoffctfu: I ClRUt C1 Jj)~l~CBl~lrt \"Ci\"~ I fct CB C'Q : CB ffl I fQ fCI li Ai q li ~a f+=t li <\"\"I I -\"Jj)q I li I R\"i 'Rf5 I { ~ ~ ~S?r %OT 1fufu mul\" ~ ~ 61f%Rflli101C1ali1 ~Pi offal ~m q{45Mfudr ~ 1%\" fCWJ\"l I ~ mBG.\"f~L(\"11\"<:Al4fcRf'~ <i'\"\"?lfll~ JilUlq~Cbl~H ;:rp:r qXlAAl~CB~ 11 Now on the topic of 'syllabic sound' (var~za), which is of the nature of subtle vital energy: In that 'upward movement' (uccara) of the vital energy, there is a sound (dhvani), which is continuously sounding as if it is imitating the unmanifest.67 This sound is called 'syllabic sound' (var~za). The most important characteristics of this syllable are the seed mantras of creation \"sa\" and dissolution \"ha.\" One can attain supreme consciousness by the practice of these man-tras. For example, when letters beginning with ''ka\" and ending with \"ma, \"68 either with or without vowels, are merged into the core of the vital energy or simply brought to memory, then one experiences a balanced state of vibration of consciousness. This"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"86 TANTRASARA is because the 'word,' that is, mantra, is free from conventional relations (samaya)69 and therefore is full in every respect. Even the words which depend on convention are also capable of con-veying their respective meanings according to the imagination of one's mind. After one has experienced supreme consciousness [in this way] he should bring together the heart, the throat. the lips, and the two 'ends of the twelve' (dvadasanta). Then, one should unify all of them in the 'core of consciousness' (hrdayam). This is the esoteric secret of this syllable (vanza). Some explain that from the 'reflective consciousness'vibrating in the 'core of the heart' e.merge white-and yellow-colored syllables. It is hy this medita-tion that a yo gin is able to realize consciousness. By the vibrating consciousness in absence of any object to be denoted, and by restraining the movement of both moon (indu, that is, apana) and sun (arka, that is, pra~za), a person, because of entering into the realm of ~onsciousness in a balanced way, becomes fully perfect In regard to cit, blja, and pi~1f]amantras . .

According to this system. the loca-tion (sthtina) is threefold. i.e., vital air (prti~za),70 the body, and external ohjects.71 The procedure (vidhi) with regard to vital air (prti~w)72 is as follows: The entire sixfold path. which will be elab-orated later, is conceived as abiding in the vital air. Time (kala) is the sequential and non-sequential unfoldment73 of 'mutative activity' (kalana). However, it should be understood that time also exists within the Lord. The manifestation of time is caused by that sakti belonging to God called KalI.74 On the other hand. the mani-"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"88 TANTRASARA festation of both sequence and non-sequence, which brings about external differentiation, is the modality of vital air (pra ~zmrtti). It is indeed consciousness alone which assumes th is nature by isolating itself from the knowable.75 As a result, consciousness assumes the form of void (nablza), which because of the associa-tion with limitation assumes the nature of 'knowable object' (ved-yatam). Then consciousness, being intent on accepting the objects of knowledge because of its freedom, is as if it were falling from its original state and becoming predominantly of the nature of the 'power of activity' (kriya sakti).76 Then the form of vital activ-ity, which is the very life of living beings, fills the body with five forms of pra~za. In this way it shines as a living being. The 'path of time' (kaladva) shines in the early portion of kriyasakti, while the 'path of space,' characterized by a diversity of forms, shines in the later portion of kriyasakti. The states of var~ia, mantra, and pada abide in the path of time because they are the supreme, subtle, and gross forms respectively. The state of the path of space (desadhva) that is 'principles' (tattvas), the 'w_orlds' (bhuvanas), and 'subtle elements of the universe· (kala) will be explained when the occasion for that arises. Although the vital air remains interwoven inside and outside of the body, pra~w moves from the heart by the perceptible effort of _the knowable objects; (that is, taking pra ~1a as the knowable Object). The three iaktis: 'belonging to the Lord' (prabhu sakti), 'one's own iakti' (atnul sakti), and 'effort' (yatna) are the causes of t?e movement of pra~w. This is accomplished through their rela-tive dominance and subordination.77 The length of the breath, both the inhalation and exhalation of all living beings, from Brahma to an insect, is thirty-six digits (wigulas) if measured by (the length of) their own fingers.78 This is ~ecause aJI living beings have the strength, effort, and body befit-ting them. The entirety of time, that is, the lunar days, months, years, and number of years, is contained in the movement of the vital air. One minute (ca~aka) is made up of one and one-fifth dig-"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"TANTRASARA 89 its (G1igula). Fol lowing this line of measurement, one hour (glzaf ika) arises.

However, the inter-mediate fifteen tufis make up one fortnight. There, in these tithis light and rest occur, which are known as day and night. Day is when the manifestation of the knowables takes place, and night is when they dissolve into the knowing subject. 81 Day and night have infinite divisions because of the variety of prolonged and temporary duration. The 'equinox' (vi~uvat) is the occurrence of the balance of both. During the dark fortnight. the moon, which stands for vital energy (apana), offers replenishing lunar phases (kala) one after the other to the sun (pra~za), until the fifteenth tufi is reached. This fifteenth tufi is adjacent to the 'end of twelve' (dvadasanta), the waning moon from which al 1 the phases have been separated and thus has become emaciated, i.e .. dissolved into pra~za. The tufi that follows is the conjunction of the half month (pakta). The first half of that tufi is related to the night of new moon (amavasya) and the latter half to the first day of the lunar fortnight (pratipad). When the portion related to (amtivasya) enters into the portion related to pratipad as a result of a conscious effort of expelling air, such as a cough, it causes a break in the l~ngth (that is, the flow) of the vital air, usually one titlzi in dura-tIOn. '!'his is known as an eclipse (specifically, a lunar eclipse). At that time, rahu, the knowing subject of mtiyd, who is insepara-?1Y associated with the object of knowledge and who is naturally mcapable of obliterating, but only of veiling f the moon]. drinks the nectar of the moon that abides in the sun (pra ~za). This is an auspicious time, capable of bestowing extraordinary results, because this is a moment in which indivisible unity of the knower, known, and knowledge takes place. When the prcl ~w enters the realm of apana, consciousness in the form of the sun fills up the apana gradually in the form of the moon (offering to it) one lunar phase after the other. This process continues until the full moon (ptirnima), which consists of fifteen tufis, develops. After this, the c?njunction of the half moon and an eel ipse takes place as described previously (solar eclipse). However, this eel ipse bestows only mundane results.

The 'dark fortnight' (kr~~w pak~a) is the passage of the sun to its 'northern course' (uttaraya~w). The passage of the sun from one side of the zodiac82 to the other (swhkranti), beginning with Capricorn (makara) and ending with Gemini (mithuna), is six digits (migula) in length. The five lunar phases (tithi) consist of one digit each. In these lunar phases there is also a division of days and nights. Thus, when inhalation occurs, that is known as the passage of the sun to its southern course (dak~inayana). The six changes found in living beings, i.e., the state called insemination, the will to become, the desire to be born, the state in which birth becomes imminent, starting to arise, and real appearance, are all included in the signs of the zodiac beginning with Capricorn and ending with Gemini. The other six human conditions, i.e., birth, length of life (stithi), transformation (pari~zati), growth (vrddhi), decay, and death, are included in the last six signs of the zodiac. For this reason rituals performed during this particular time (according to the zodiac) bestow the appropriate results. The rudras, beginning with Dak~a and ending with Pitamaha, together with their saktis are the superintending deities of the twelve signs of [the] zodiac. 83 Here ends the description of the arising of the year. \\;i~~fi ef~ fuw:r ~ ~UT ~~ crfl=( ~;:r ~UT ~m~~= mct~ll~l~, \\;i~~fi fumaj ~ICi?lld I ftJ:J5aims\"[A ~. <:l?f ~ d6id'5~ 3ml=( ~ llOITi\\'Jll ~~ Q\"xr Cfl5rlfuT, ~ 3-R\"m Qf{q1cu1 {!Q)f~ murf;:nf~~l(f)IM 6iteU&.l~, 3l?T"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"92 TANTRASARA eCBRi~1R1trn~1fUr ~ ~ICilA ffe fumaj ~~ I Ci 1acil 1!Cf 3\"1Bl{I~ >l I u I f1 'L~ I , ~ ;:r t5! tct:Hi~l ~ 3ITTm GfT ~ 3\"1 H \"\"fl'i I fl I \"Ci?f +i9~ ~ ~ fffiw, 3-Fl;:r ~UT fG:cx:rrR m G: ~I a bf fH:~ ~ I fOT ~1Tn=l I i:lfCllR ?ftfur ~ ~ ~ ~ ~cqfu mcIT~ ~: ~ ~~ I ~TTRP=l eCB'<\"1ca~1 Ji ;=a ;=a '<+\"l, Ara~~: ~cfffii:r: ~Teti f~, ~ 161 RH Hi CB I ft 1 f;;::i c: J ~ crfl Cf5?i ~ ~ -a-ffi~ ~A sn•i:n fq\"ff ~ 0FfT ctl\"TCfef~fu=rr JI ;::i C'il ch s:l fl~ I Cf5 C1l ~Z-1\" fc:rtsOf~ I ~~ '!?&\"ii 0 gg I Ga')~ 11 w +:rITTmct ~sR=r I <lfl1\" R ~ 11 fl A I L(\"11 ~rem ~re: I m l=fR;:r Qlfm<=f ~~= I Cl\\l fQIDIT: fG:;::f a I a cil q m?t: I ~ ~ ~= 1 <1<1 ITT ~w ~amm '<1¢0:~, a1aa1 m?t:, ~ ~, a ma l1 fq q-31cffu: 1 C1?f ~ (fG:\"Cff~ ~ 1 a fCI l I Fa = , ~ JTI5°fud51'<1Clftr:, ~~Ul'<Cf51uli ~ fG:;::f ~lci{C)~loli, \"Rm Ci ldCil, ~ q-~1Cil11~f I ~1Cifi¢t:I~ ~6\"1105fa;::i1~1: I t!cf J1C1Cifd1Cl 3iclfffil~Ji_ ~Cf ~ur {1¢0:1011+-t ~= I ~cf~'<ifHffl ~ ~ I oo.!U ~~lfi~.!U ~CB1Ro1: 3-Tcx:rffi IBtaPa ~ I $$f}(f)o~-;::i 1~9-tl (1GJ ~I ~Sdl~'<>lft~:, ~ ef\"'5G: I C1?f ~llf511~'<Jj)\"tf51 3lfLr ~Jl'1~ I~ sITTCBO~·-=tl~ ~ ~: ~ ~epqrfwrt '<1~101i ~. ~ ~, ~ ~= (1(\\ ~~, c=rrcrcTI-1!Cf a=JLIT, ~ -a fl A fa A a l1 I~ I~ i m ff1 ~a I -q;;:r: JI g ~~I : ~Jffu I ~ ~ 3\"1 clfrf)(f) I C1 : c=f ~~ WW lj)O I fu (\"Cl I l1 I~ I Fd;i Cf)~ I cncrffi ~ I \"fl\" 1!Cf ~ I q I <A I Ct.> I C'1: wclm\"R;:r W0Tc1 Q~ f~ 1 JJ?r mun JllTfl ~Jffu, a 1 a a1 ~, m >i1orn~1l1:, muT q-~(Jf'CSfffiwf8 ~sfq m ~~, Ci?lllZilffi=f ~ 1 Qm cnffi wtlffifl1tuIB m -ttxsm, C1fl ~~ f~, ~ Rm, ff \"QCf l161>lft~: I ~~ «idJlflqR~ f~~~ft.rcPT ~ ~ ffi<:Rl. ~ mr~, ClC1 am~, w -a-3-FITT~ 1 Wtt>CBIM;:oi w~.fq:rr~furR-;r ~~~ I 3Rlf~ fllAri~ tra, ~ oo '<\"1 IJ=H ffl t1fRt oo ~CJ I ~ fl I +Fi~ I a 3\"1 Cf5 f{:l I Ci d'5 I C1 I fl ' ' ' ' ' ' f~m~tS!JOll?iCi~I m~tS!Cf)IC'iSH\"Hs:lfafl~=c:A~trmG:<:1: I ~ G:m w '<\"16~Ji_ ~cl \"ffaf Rqc=f cffifc:: ~cf '!~ ~ ~ qzj ~ ~?:"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"TANTRASARA 93 ~ 1=1\"~ ~tl~ ~~UT G:~ll1f01a1R 346GIG:~I. ~ llf01afqfu: I t!CJl=( 3ffi\"&:fl: ~fte~Ml'il: l\"!CBf~ ~~ ~. \"ffisfq tifaffi, m 3LITW I \"ff f=a ~ I :;Q I f=a :;::J:j I ?I fil q 3flf ~ -~ cmffi-~ ~ I C1c1 l!Cf fqG••H=ict>fYIG.1 ~f\"ci?ClJi 3IB:f ~ fc:m\"~ I ~ \"l'i\"W ~ CblftlG:l'i: \"RW 3fqA5fq ~<i l'i I C1 ~\"fflf)-~~ I <::TW ~ ~(\"Cf)U ~·-\"fff<.1-~ -~ ~ mc:~11;:8~ ~6=f-~-mr-~1a1 .. =t1f-~m1xo..~ d'S1\"1.:01~cepi:f c=r~ ~ s-Rr ~ c=ct.>~ I \"i ~ -~C5T-:a -~ ct51 fl -g: 1c:~11 ;:fl~, ~-.Jr~~ crrtlCf5-RtFf -\"T1~ -'j)nx:i ~ ~ I If the sixty lunar phases (tithis) are conceived in the breadth of each finger (migula), then following this method of calcula-tion, one year is conceived in the passage of the sun from one sign of the zodiac to the other. Counting in this way, in the in-going and the outgoing breaths, the raising of twelve years takes place. 84 When in one digit (aJigula) the number of lunar phases is conceived to be three hundred, then one-fifth of a digit makes one year. 85 Following this method of calculation, what was previ-ously described as one casaka, i.e., one and one-fifth digits, then the period of five years ~ill place in one passage of the sun from one sign of the zodiac to another (sadzkrtmti). Following this pro-cedure, the rising of sixty years takes place in a single inhalation and exhalation of the breath. Therefore, the number of the lunar phases is 21,600, which is the number of inhalations and exhala-tions of the breath in the course of one day and night. A number higher than sixty has not been examined because it borders on infinity. Furthermore, one year for human beings is the lunar phase (tithi) of the gods. 86 Following this procedure, 12,000 heavenly years composes the four yugas. The duration of these four yugas is 4,000, 3,000, 2,000, and 1,000 years, beginning with krtayuga. There are eight junctions between them, which are 400, 300, 200, and 100 years in length. One manvantara81 consists of 71 cycles of these four yugas. Fourteen of these manvantaras make up one day of Brahma. At the end of this day of Brahma, the three worlds"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"94 TANTRASARA are burned up by the 'fire of time' (ktila agni). However, the upper three worlds88 are overpowered by sleep caused by smoke. The creatures living there are propelled by the rapidly burning [cos-mic] fire to a world called Jana and remain there as pralaydkala souls. But those creatures called Ku~maI)Qa. Hataka. and others who are properly enlightened souls continue to play in a world called Mahas. When the period of that night of Brahma is over, creation starts again. Following this system of measurement, the life span of Brahma is one hundred years. This is the duration of one day and night of Vi~I)U. His life span is also one hundred years. The life span of Vi~I)U is one day in the 1 i fe of Rud ra, the Lord of the Rudra world, which is above the world of Vi~IJU. The duration of his night is of the same length: one year is as described above. One hundred of these years is the 1 imit of the Ii fe of Rudra. At the end of one hundred years [of his 1 i fe] he attains identity with Siva. The functional period of Rudra is one day consisting of 'one hundred rudras' (satarudras), who support the sphere of Brahma. Their night is of the same length. Their life span is also one hundred years long. At the time of the death of the satarudras, the destruction of Brahma's reign takes place. Thus. the 1 i fe span of the rudras abiding in the water principle to the end of the pri-mord.ial nature principle (prakrti) is counted in the following way: !he life span of the rudras, abiding in the lower principle, is a day m the life of those who live in the higher principle. Then Brahma and Rudra (although their worlds are destroyed~ Brahma and Rudra are not), who are presiding over water, and the other tattvas, remain in an unmanifest (avvakta) state. At that time, Lord Srikal)tha becomes the agent of des~truction. This is the intermediate state of dissolution89 which ends in avvakta. When the time of destruction is over, a new creation hegi ns again. At that time, those who attained liberation by fol Iowi ng other .frlstras are also created.90 The span of life of Lord Srikat)tha is one day of those rudras who abide in the veils (kaiicukas).91 The length of their night is the same. One day of Gahanefa is the 1 ife span of Rudra. The length of his night is the same. During the night of"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"TANTRASARA 95 Gahanefa, everything that remains dissolves in mtiyti. After disso-lution, Gahanefa creates again. When the life span of the unmani-fest state (avyakta) is multiplied by ten parardhas (one parardha is 100,000 bill ion years), it is said to be the period of one day of mayii. The same is the case for the length of the night of maya. The night of maya is stated to be a dissolution (pralaya). The time span of maya, when multiplied by one hundred parardlza, is one day of Isvara. There, the vital energy (pra~za) creates the universe. The same is true for the length of one night, during which pra~za takes rest. In the cavity called bralzmabila, where the vital energy stops its function and although consciousness there remains in a tranquil state, even there this sequence persists. When the life span of Isvara is multiplied by one hundred parardhas, the number we arrive at amounts to one day of Sadasiva. The same occurs in the length of his night. Sadasiva's night is known as mahapra-laya. 92 After the end of his period, Sadasiva encloses bindu. ardlzrachandra, and nirodhika within himself and dissolves him-self into nada. Nada dissolves into sakti, sakti into vyapinl, and vyapinl into an(/Sritasiva. One day of anairitasiva is equal to one day of sakti when multiplied by 10 million parardhas. Anasri~a rests in the realm of samanti. This equilibrium of samana is known as Brahma. From this state of equilibrium (the most sub-tle state of mind), which is beyond mutation, all these aforesaid 'mutations of time' and their dissolutions arise like the cyclic motion of the 'wheel of time,' similar to the opening and closing of the eyelids. The procedure of counting is as follows: 1; 10; 10 x 10; 100 x 10: 1,000 x 10: 10,000 x 10: 100,000 x 10: 1,000,000 x IO: 10,000,000 x 10: 100,000,000 x 10: 1,000,000,000 x 10: 10,000,000,000 x 10: 100,000,000,000 x 10: L000,000.000,000 x 10: 10,000.000,000.000 x 10: 100.000.000,000.000 x 10: l ,000,000,000,000,000 x 10: 10,000,000,000,000,000 x 10.

Thus, numerous creations and dissolutions occur in one breath,93 having the characteristic of the great creation. That breath abides in consciousness, the consciousness in an acciden-tal attribute (upadhi) (with the characteristics of forms. features, etc.), which accidental attributes go to rest in the singularity of consciousness. The vibration (spanda) is nothing but the mani-festation of consciousness, which appears in the form of the emer-gence of time. Therefore, this diversity that occurs in dreams and imagination does not create any contradiction in regard to time. Just as the emergence of time occurs in the form of pra ~10, in the same way, it occurs even in apana, which proceeds from the heart to the end of muladhara. As the six causal agents. that is, Brahma, Vi~l).u, Rudra, Ifa, Sadasiva, and Anasritasiva, who appear in the heart, throat, palate, forehead, randhra, and in the 'end of twelve' (dvadasanta),94 operate in the upper region. in the same way in apana, these deities operate in the throat, valve, genera-tive organ, causing it to contract and expand, and in the \"end of twelve' (dvadasanta).

The samtina, while wandering along the eight different directions, causes the knowing subject to imitate the activities of the superintending deities of the quarters.97 While moving upward and downward, it (samana) goes on mov-ing along the three channels. 98 So it is that on the day of equinox (vi~uvat) it moves externally in the morning along the middle path for one and one-quarter ghafiktis. Then, the number of movements of the breath being nine hundred, it moves externally for a period of two and one-half ghafikas from left to right, again from left to right, and then from the left. Thus, five occurrences of the movement of the sun from one side of zodiac (salizkrtinti) to the other takes place. With the passage of the sun through five signs of the zodiac, and after a duration of thirteen and three-quarters ghafiktis, (its) being over the autumnal equinox takes place, and at mid-day, nine hundred movements of the breath occur. Then, from there the breath moves from the right to the left, then from the right to the left, and then right. In this way, the sun passes through (another) five signs of zodiac. Thus, the number ~f breaths is nine hundred for each passage of the sun (smizkrtintz). This also occurs during the night. Therefore, during the day and night of viJuvat (equinox), there are twelve smizkrtintis in each. With the increase and decrease of the duration of the day, the num-ber of smizkrtintis will increase or decrease. Thus, in one breath of sanuzna the passage of two years occurs because of the absence of the meeting of the inhaled and exhaled breath. In this manner, the passage of twelve years occurs as described before, while in the breath known as udclna, the movement of breaths occurs up to the 'end of twelve' (dvadastinta), where time is characterized as a vibration. Here again, the same method of calculation should be followed. On the other hand, in the type of breath (called) vyana, which is all-pervasive and free from sequence, the emergence of time is associated with a subtle surge."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"98 TANTRASARA 3f~ qoffe:a: I ITT 310~ 3fU~ cmTc:m-~cffi:r ~. ~ ~ [ ~ ~ \\;llOllTilA I~ ~vrc=r \"ci~ChlfUT \"$\"fu 3N:, ' ' ' 3fll1i 34 a C\"\"i aTI quff~ I lk\"i J1 f1 ~~ 3\"H: U g U cl <:i \"'\"'?!Cl I~ \"\"'I Ci C\"1 ' ' ~ fu?f 1=P5IT~ fG:cnf~ ~~\"Cruc=( ~CRfm \"fl6 ctlC::lc:-RiA ~ I ITT OOfG:R !J'ilUlcil{fl{..~ih~ 3G:<:if\"i~ C\\Ql{..c(;ilctl I ctff\\cP1f~ <1G:W:\\ ~TfcUf5AUI ~fH~lci ~ ~ ~. ~ ~ ~~ a-B \"ci I'< fQ {ti q fu~ I Tfl ~ , ~ I a I \"ci I { aftu) , Cf5 I Ci~ I \\Cl ~ ~11 ~a~ -&cf~ f:a ?I~ I R=Bf;:rtj\"{ ~ I CITTff~~ ga ~m:cn: Ti\" au~c;: fi I \\!51 '< ~ $11 ~Cl~ I $11 ~ ~ <:i I a Ii 3-fflf~ \"ff~ a:rur:, mun~ t.f wf~ ~CT ~I ~ ~ -~w Rid'5fG$1HA l!CB Ti\" fu;f~ ~ -m~~l&il{C)NCic=cf I~ Al?llaT 3IBr W~d'5~1a 1 ~ ·a~1raa ~a:1nAci~· 1 (mo ~o 9-~-~~) ~ I -'{\"tl~l;:a{ mcrc1 ~ 3-fcrc=f ~ ~CT ~ I 3-0 ~ Qd'5 I ~TI fa q G:~ '{U I ti ti~ fufu~wrt~~~~;:r lTcP l!Cf mft tR\"B~~ ~ d\"51M'/tl~~ 31fdCf5&qlc-l=ll 1!CI\" ~~ \"$\"fu I ~ ~ Q)IBT~ muTIG.Gf Q\"Q ~, ~Rc:fi g I'< i ~ fct f'a 5i 1 i ~~ <tlq 31 ld'5C1 <F( I 3-TTfJ=Fr l!Cf qK4~ ~ J1 Hi ~ \"(!Cl\" ircrfu ~ I I fl f8~4'fl1 lc:-A.-i: !l'i 10 l~lf#5 ~tj Cl?flt \"ci I fa d\"5 I Ci J:t I mci1 ~ RcJ ffi fi ~I'< \"ci ~1-f ;f f41~ml ikcTI~ ICIA ra I I ~ -~fh:ref~ca I \"ci 1 lffcH fo a C1 ;;;51 f1 I { q)ITTf~ ~Ch I~ I ;i ~ tj t5(3A I f€d'5'\"{ I I t..

This is the rising of the phoneme automatically, all by itself, without any effort. On the other hand, the rising of the mantra with effort is like applying the force of determination to a single effort. Then a teacher, while continuing to think a mantra day and night with the thought of unification, becomes identified with the deity of the mantra. The number of rising of mantras is interpreted by the rising of the movement of breath. When that breath is doubled, the rising becomes half. Therefore, following the same method, the rising occurs with reference to the wheel consisting of 108 divisions, and the rising of the breath becomes 200. According to this method, one who is able to rest in the movement of the breath, either gross or subtle, while the movement of breath becomes attenuated and when time is consumed in this manner, for that one everything is experienced as one consciousness which is perfectly full with the variegated saktis. The difference of time is the cause of a distinction of knowl-edge and not a distinction of a knowable object. It is like the knowledge of one standing on the mountaintop looking down-ward. This knowledge, as long as it is existent, is known as 'subtle moment' (k~ana). In the rising of one breath, one thought exists. This is correct. Otherwise, the knowledge of a thought-construct (vikalpa) cannot be considered to be one because of its gradual association with the element of a word.

Then it expands externally in the body and (al I the way) to the extent of the liliga, altar, and even the image of deity, etc. The knower of the truth of the real nature of the thirty-six tattvas first dissolves all these paths into the body, [then from] the body into prti ~w. pra ~za into intellect, intellect into void, ai~d finally void into consciousness. In this way, this kind of yoglll becomes permeated with consciousness not dependent on any-thing external. Then he experiences consciousness as Paramasiva, and transcending even that state, he experiences himself as being immanent as well. Hu However, in a lesser way (if one is unable to experience the fullness of consciousness], one may take up a portion of know-ables such as Brahma or Vi~I)U, the superintending deities of the sphere of maya, as the highest.

The causal relation (ktiryakara~wbhava) is twofold, i.e., 'absolute' (paramarthika) and 'created' (sr$!a).117 The causal relation of the absolute nature is of such extent that the Lord, as the ultimate causal agent, mani-fests in all forms, beginning with Siva and ending with earth, as nondifferent from his own Self while at the same time he remains resting in his own Self. The cr~ated or 'imagined' (kalpita) causal relation is created by the will of the Lord and brought to life by ~he restrictive power of niyati. The extent of this causal relation IS such that in spite of the presence of the manifestation of regular priority and posteriority,118 and even if some other features are present externally, the continuity of the innate nature (svarapa) remains invariably present.119 Therefore, a sprout is created by the will of a yogin as well as from a seed. In a dream one creates a jar, etc. Even there the agenthood of the Lord cannot be denied. Therefore, although the created or imagined causal relation is also present, the existence of the absolute causal relation is undeniable. All of this, which was described (potter, clay, which constitute supposed causal relation) becomes possible only if the Absolute, as the foundation, remains steadily established and not otherwise. Therefore, it is proper to say that the causal relation is the totality of all causes. This totality of causes consists of all beings having been woven together by the greatness of the knowing conscious-ness, which possesses absolute freedom.120 This power of the Lord assumes the nature of a particular"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"TANTRASARA 109 group of entities conditioned by space and time. Each individual, at the time of its creation, assumes such a nature. Although being of this nature, these entities assume distinctive forms; it is because they become associated with exterior factors that they change and attain comparative distinctions.121 Thus, the very nature of the great Lord is consciousness and independent freedom of will. This Lord, who possesses the entire universe consisting of the multitude of beings as his body, is the creator of the jar, etc. This is because the consciousness belonging to the potter is not differ-ent from that Lord: furthermore, the body of the potter is also included in the totality of objective existence. Then, how can it be possible for the potter to have any sense of egoism in this regard? The answer to th is question will be that the sense of egoism of the potter is also created by the Lord, just as is the pot, etc. Even the theory of the totality of causes to propel agenthood [to produce an effect] in reality belongs to the consciousness which is the imma-nence of the Lord. Though Mount Meru exists in some distinct place, it cannot be supposed to be the cause of this particular jar.122 Thus, on this topic of the created or imagined effects of the principle of causal relation in regard to the principles (tattvas), there are diverse views found in the sastras. All these different views are relevant: 123 as for example, the birth of a scorpion can take place from cow dung, worm, by the will of the yogin, by the application of mantras, and by the usage of various medicines. However, we will explain this created or imagined principle of causal relation according to the understanding of our scriptures. a ~ ~ qxrfw mf'mfw Rif\"{ ~~. ~ fQ 1a~ lfl mf'ffi film l=r'!:...~ a l:i 1 !,:i cnG l:i :r:t qxrm Fa~ Fa 1 ~~ ~ 1 ct a fCI A , ' ~~ ' ' 3\"l1+=~!,:i1~ mf'maf\"CIA, $mrn1~ ~1c:tc=tfCIA-$m1<:i1 -IB ~-, ' fIB<:i l:il: 'fl I R:l '{Clq l~qJ l'\"\"l lc-'\"\"ld5C\"\"Q lfl, $1 H~I f\"ffim~ ~~'<flfCIJ:t, fIB<:l I~ I fffim~ fq m Ci \"fCI '\"\"I ~ I 3-T?f q ~mi: fucr-mf'm-' ~\"'1~1a.9d-<:H.-a1=-~ Flc!·~l l!1SJi fi1+:J1~{<)q101i ru~1~1 ~J1furu~<:l1: ~. c:ruw -~-mm: '\"\"!~A~~~~~. -~ ~~~"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"110 TANTRASARA I ~ m~ Mer: epfil I ~~~~tel l'\"i+:J'\"i:r\"(i 1q\"!:'\"i IA I rn~~ ~Jffu-. $.9ci~a§ld~l'\"i ~~Wm\"ffffiff1d5HIJ1Ulaj mnf~~~ I c=I?f ffif~St io h:s•F<:fr1 I {Cl q : q R fq ~: 31cf5-4epaj'ii fl I ~A I ?I ii Cf ~ tX:'l ct cfcB ct l:ll J Cl a Fa I -;:r lWr: ~fltfi\"C\"Ql'\"\"C\"l-<:J:t 1 -<:1J1afei Q; CB11fafm~1sf~ 1 CBlf ~ ITT ctsi:h11?i, ef~~ ~ Cf5lf*ef~ ~ fucinm Cf~ I msti lWr: ~~ fd1c-irnmm2Jm1a: :r:ii~c=t fcBT~. ~ q-~ -~mm1c-J=J;Old om:efq dfCj)fdlfl I ~ q +iffi fa$1HChaM fa£A+:JH~ ~tfl 4'© ~ -;:r fd a:> I a Cf5lf 3\"11 lZi I IQ fu I ~fl Cl d? a fl f0i C1 J!~ FCf Wttr ~ +:rffimmff\"ff Cf5lf -tt~f~m\"l1 faj'~ -~ ~lldlf1'\"ilifqes'\\H1J=Jai;:rt mnf~ m\"JiFl 3-TUT~~ ~Jffu ~ ~~ffi. ~ q ~an'li $mm1C1M1acr J15'f\\Q ~ ¢~ 3ffill\"f~ 1 ~\"l\"f ~ foe\\fo~q1C1m l!Cf, ~ fa~qJ=l~. 31fu~q~a l:rfr:, C1ffl q ~ ~mm1Al;i.

The lord of nivrttikalti is indeed Brahma, etc. These lords are of the nature of universal, and indi-viduals [living beings in these worlds] closely follow these lords. They are also of five types, i.e., belonging to Siva (Sambhava), belonging to sakti (sakta), mantramahesvara, mantre5vara, and mantras.125 These five principles belong to the pure path (suddhadhva). Up to this extent, i.e., from Siva to suddhavidya, Siva is the direct creator.126 The impure path (asuddhtidhva) is created by Lord Ananta, whose other name is Aghorefa. This is the will of the Lord, and the creation is for the benefit of limited knowing subjects who are longing for the experience as they have been agitated in this way. Here, the word 'longing' (lolikti) stands for the vibrative longing that is of the nature of conceiving oneself as not being complete. This is only 'desiring' without any object in sight, that is to say, a feeling of the deservedness to remain limited in the future. This 'defilement' (ma/a) is not a separate category belonging to the sou 1 (puru~a). The raga principle, on the other hand, is desire conditioned by objectivity. However, here in mtiyti principle an object is merely an object [e.g., let me have something, without having any clear idea of what kind of object is desired]. On the other hand, the attachment (rciga) [that] is a property of buddhi is diversified into different kinds of objective aims. T.he difference between the two wi 11 be explained later.

The shining of sentiency and i nsentiency is only with regard to limited souls. The nature of sentiency or conscious-ness is indeed 'lordship' (aisvarya), while ahsence of conscious-ness, or insentiency, is its defilement. In the process of creating maya, both sentiency and insentiency turn out to be of the nature of the will of the Lord; therefore, it is also eternal. The nature of the substance to be created will be manifested to appear as insen-tient. Therefore it is created as such and as it has the characteristic of spreading through all the created objects.

Kala and the other kaiicukas are pure when they perform their own functions [which are] congenial to the great Lord, because their sole objective is the attainment of one's own nature as they stand as the opposite of duality. The kancukas assume that nature because of the force of the descent of power [(saktipata)]. How this takes place will be clarified when the topic of descent of power is discussed. However, the impure [form of five kaiicukas] is the opposite of this. Kala is born from maya, which unites the limited self, existing in a state similar to deep slumber, with limited doership (ki171citkartrtvam).129 This kala is, as it were, the swelling of the seed of the world. Although kala is born from the unity of mdycl and the Ii mi ted se 1 f (a ~zu), it causes maya to undergo change, but it does not create any change in the limited self (puru$a), which is changeless. Thus, the indis-cernible distinction between the limited self (puru~a) and kala cannot be easily noticed because of their mutual interpenetration. However, by the grace of a certain person endowed with lordship, ~biding as a superintending deity in the womb of ma ya, all the impurities of past deeds are destroyed and the discerning knowl-edge between maya and puru$a takes place. As a result. a dis-cerning soul exists as a vijFWnakalcl soul above mclycl and not in any way below mclya. One who attains discriminative knowledge bet~een kala and pttrU$G remains above kala. Similarly, one who attams perfection in this discriminative knowledge between purzt-JG and prakrti does not transmigrate in the worlds below prakrti. However, this discriminative knowledge between a~zm·amala and purtl$G leads to the state of resemblance of Siva. With full real-ization of the fullness of puru~rn one attains Sivahood. Thus, it is the kala principle which is the bestower of limited doership, but this doership is meaningless to a person who is devoid of k110wl-edge.

This raga principle has its function in regard to a particular object. It should not be under-stood that doership is due to the activity of non-attachment. Even a person who does not possess non-attachment is sometimes seen to be free from attachment. On the other hand. a person who possesses the quality of non-attachment is sometimes seen to be attached, as, for example, when performing meritorious deeds. Furthermore, a person who becomes fulfilled by eating good food, etc., might be free from attachment~ however, in th is instance, latent impressions of attachment cannot be denied. Otherwise. in the absence of this (a latent impression), the logical inconsistency of the rising of non-attachment could occur. The principle of time (ktilatattva), on the other hand, by causing limitation in regard to effect, imposes a I imitation on doersh ip as wel I. The Ii m itation of a particular object is common to both time (kala) and niyati. The function of the niyati principle is to restrict or limit doership only to an object at hand. The function of nivati is also present in regard to causal relation.130 In this way, the-group of four veils (km1cukas) has been created. Only th is much is the function of maya; limited doership is the function of kala; (governing) the present moment (adhuna) is the function of kala; knowing (jiiana) 1~ the function of vidya; being attached (abhi:;vakta) is the func-tion of raga; and \"I am doing\" (karomi) is the function of niyati. When consciousness functions in this way, abiding in a subtle body. then it is called a bound soul (pasu). This group of six, beginning with mtiyti, is also called six veils (kaiicukas). At this stage, the innate nature of consciousness has been pushed into the background and hidden, because k(lla, etc., become dominant and exist as veils, covering the innate nature of the Self. It has already been said that agency, capable of doing only little. is the result of maya. In this condition, the agency attributed to the limited (kilicit) [agent] is the qualified subject. Kala, which is fu net ion ing"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"TANTRASARA 117 there (kartrtvam), is the cause of emergence of vidya, etc. This has already been explained. Now the portion of the qualifying, which has been named 'lim-ited' (ki!lcit), becomes the object to be known and affected.131 That very kala which differentiates }iiana and kriya from itself is the creator of the principle prakrti. This prakrti, which is also called the state of equ i 1 ibrium of gu~zas characterized by pleasure, pain, and delusion, threads through specific types of objects and like universal abides in them all. In this way, the creation of both pairs, i.e., the enjoying subject (a~zu, puru:ja) and enjoyable objects, takes place under the control of kalcl. It has already been stated that their creation in reality occurs without any sequence. How-ever, it must be pointed out that (for all practical purposes) succes-sion exists here. The order of sequence regarding vidya and raga is seen differently~ for some, being attached, come to know, while others who know, become attached, etc. In the Tantras, such as Raurava, etc., the sequential order is different. However, it should not be understood that there is any contradiction between the two. Prakrti is the generic form of an object of enjoyme?t. .whi/3~ the gu~za principle is that which abides in the state of agitation. Pleasure (suklza) is sattva in nature, which is the illuminating light manifesting the enjoyable nature of an object. Pain is character-ized by the oscillation of I ight and absence of it. For this reason, rajas is of the nature of activity. Delusion or molza is total absence of light, that is to say, it is darkness (tamas). These three, sa~tv.a, rajas, and ta mas, make up the objects of enjoyment. Thus it .15 clear that the evolutes of prakrti come out of an agitated primodtal nature (pradlu:lna) and not from an unagitated one. It is necess.ary to admit the existence of agitation vibration as an intermediate state between primodial nature and gu~zas. In this way, the exis-tence of a separate principle unknown to the Sa1i1khya called gu~w has been proved .133 The agitation of prakrti takes place only as the result of the intervention of the superintending deity of prakrti.134 Otherwise, if this agitation in prakrti is not caused by intervention of the superintending deity. then it would be impossible for prakrti"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"118 TANTRASARA to be involved with each individual pu ru~a.

This takes place when the light of puru~a, which has become tainted by contact with a knowable object. reflects on the screen of the intellect (buddhi). This (notion of egoity as one's true nature) is the erroneous notion, just like mistaking mother-of-pearl for silver. Therefore, the word aha111 is suffixed with ka ra, the active agent. Th is suffix also indicates that some-thing has heen created. The followers of the Sa1i1khya school, on the other hand, do not accept the self-reflective nature of the Self. We, on the other hand, assign it the status of agent. Thus, the agency (kartrtvam) regarding aham is in essence pure reflective consciousness having none to oppose it (apratiyogi). It relishes its own bliss as 'I' (a/Janz). This is an aspect of instrumental-ity belonging to alzalizkara.135 But the other aspect belonging to"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"120 TANTRASARA ahadzkara is its being the originator of the ten sense organs, five tannuUras, and the mind, because it has a threefold nature, which is the result of its division into sattva, etc. While the mind is being created,136 it is conceived of as the originator and is endowed with the capacity of giving birth to five tanmdtras. In regard to the ear, the mind is endowed with the capacity of giving birth to the particular subtle element called sound. Furthermore, in regard to the olfactory sense organ, it is endowed with the capacity of giving birth to the subtle element called smell. It is not feasible to consider sense organs as being born of matter.137 This is because in concepts such as \"I hear,\" the sense of egoity still persists~ for this very rea-son it is said: the sense organs are born of egoity (ahalizkara)._ It (the sense organ) remains in contact with that portion of the egoity (ahG1izkara); otherwise, if use is made of other intermediate organs. the defect of infinite regress would take place. Egoity (ahwizkara) is indeed the subject portion of the agent. Therefore, purw;a possesses two main instruments. Limited ~nowledge (afoddhavidya) and limited agency (kala) serve as 1~struments of puru~a in regard to knowledge and action, respec-tively. It is for this reason that lame or bl ind persons experience no ~bsence of knowledge and activity which are characterized by egoity. It is from the sattvika aspect of aha1i1kll ra, attributed by the augmented portion of the subtle elements (udriktatanm{lfra-bhag~i). that five motor elements emerge. It is because of egoitY. (ah~mk.tira) that the organ of locomotion of a person possessed ot egoity IS capable of performing its function with a thought such as .\"I am going.\" The principal locus of locomotion, i.e., the foot. exists externally; however, locomotion ex is ts equally in other places as well. It is for this very reason that a person bereft of feet is not completely devoid of ability to move. Furthermore. the mix-ture of various actions performed by different motor organs should not be brought into doubt because of the reasons stated before, that is. because of the existence of a single cause in the form of aha lizka ra related to the subject. Action is performed by organs; e.g .. movement possesses activ-"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"TANTRASARA 121 ity as its principal nature. This, however, is not the case regard-ing the perception of color, form, etc. According to the Vaise~ika school, form, color, etc., is understood to be a property (gu~za); therefore, the group of motor organs is fivefold because it is aimed at that particular number. For example, for the ascertainment of activity, external Iy some motor organs exist for the purpose of giv-ing or excreting, and others for the purpose of accepting or taking in, or for both. Or, they may be free from both, or may be for the purpose of repose in one's own nature. These motor organs are in the following order: anus, hands, feet, and sexual organs. When the ascertainment of activity, which remains interwoven with the vital air (pra~za) takes place, then this is the function of the organ of speech. Therefore, it should be understood that the movement present in the hands, which is the locus of that particular motor organ, is the same movement present in the feet. It is for this very reason that an infinite number of activities does not lead to an infi-nite number of actions. Some argue that up to this extent the rajas portion of ahalizkara remains involved in the process of creation. Others say that the mind emerges from rajas; yet others maintain that mind is the product of the sattva aspect of alzmizkara, while the senses are said to be the product of rajas. The five subtle elements (tan-nultras) as well as five gross elements, which are nothing but the knowable objects, are born from the predominantly tamasic and delusive aspect of ahalizkara which veils the agency of the enjoy-ing [experiencing I subject. All individual sounds have in their background a single, unspe-cific and generic sound that precedes them, which is free from agitation (k~\"iobha). Th is form of sound is the subtle element of sound called .fobdatanmatra. The same holds true regarding smell. taste, touch, and sight. From the vibrating subtle element of sound ~ ~ emerges ether (d ka.fo), which provides space to all because it is capable of al Iott i ng space to the objects spoken of, so that they can occupy their particular places. Air emerges from the agitated subtle elements of sound, but air is not separate from the element"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"122 TANTRASARA of ether (tikasa). Fire emerges from the agitated subtle element form (riipa), while the properties of sound and touch remain pres-ent in it. From the agitated subtle element of taste water is born, while the three properties of sound, tactility, and form remain present there. The earth emerges from the agitated subtle element of smell, while the four previously mentioned properties remain in it. Others hold a view that from the agitated sound and touch air is born, and when all five subtle elements are agitated the earth is born. The earth is nothing but the aggregate of al I properties; however, there is nothing else that exists which is the substratum of all properties. In this collection of principles (tattva), the qual-ity (gw;a) [belonging to these principles] which is above the lower one is more pervasive, while the lower one is less pervasive than the upper one. The excellence of the quality (gu~za) can be defined as that without which other qualities cannot come into existence. Therefore, the principle of earth is pervaded by al I the principles beginning with Siva and ending with water. In the same way, the water principle is pervaded by the fire principle, etc. The same takes place up to and including the §akti principle. The gross elements, the host of subtle elements, the sense and motor organs, prakrti, puru~a veiled with sheaths, and also from vidycl to the sakti, all of these are nothing but the order of expansion of the waves in the form of one's own consciousness. 31~ ., a A A I mct5JOt I 31~ cfraHi ~ R{<llZlci 1 \"fl\" q ~w ~cl~ \"QCf ~ ~m;:r Jm: I Cl?f fmcrr: A~ A~~ 1r: ~ffi: ~ fu$1Hld5C11: s:iC1l:ildSC11: fl(f)fll ~ ~ Wn:>A:r:a: I ~ ~~, <i~G:l<i_ ef2:1C£ll~~Ul'i<ifQI~ ~m~~: ~cf5 ~ ~ qsqG:~IJi_ I ITT~~ ~~TI:f ~l,Af~ -31LRT~~~, >n=JTQ~ 3f~~ ~ fu~;n~ ~ ~q ~111\"1')~"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"TANTRASARA 123 sITTJ:J (\"q'( I q '{Ii~ I (fUl ~ti ~I ffil \"i i a I Cl \"fCI I C1 I efmJ:J ~q s:l uR Q; ~J:JlqCID ~ fu~ amfffiJ:Jfa:§q{C)tj ~J:Jc<H1~g1RCBli~g1a,, ~ flcarnti -s:ll=l1qo1i ~1cic=wqfu fict>Ml'\"\"dHi a1cia1s=t 3mfCllC11 Chapter Nine In this chapter, the distinct features of the principles (tattvas) are going to be examined.138 In the Trika doctrine, the supreme Lord himself has taught the existence of the sevenfold variation of the principles: sivas, mantramahesvaras, mantresas, mantras, vijntintikalas, pralayakalas, and sakalas.139 Thus, there are seven possessors of saktis (saktirntin). They possess only seven saktis. It is because of these variations of the principles, beginning with earth and ending in pradhtina, that there is a fourteenfold division of each.140 When 'unique nature' (svariipa) is added to this division, then the division becomes fifteenfold.141 Among them, the unique nature, which rests in itself, deserves to come under the purview of the knowable objects (prameyatayogya).142 This can only be cog-nized by the grace of the goddess A.para. On the other hand, the subject in whom the energies (saktis) are overflowing and who becomes the place of repose for the objects, is the very nature of that which belongs to sakti (stikta). This can only be known by the grace of the venerable goddess Parapara. The sakta form is sev-enfold because it was stated earlier that number of saktis is seven. When the subject possessing the saktis (saktiman) becomes pre-dominant with reference to the host of knowing subjects and [the objects] rest in the knowing subjects, then it [the knowing subject] is of the nature of Siva, the possessor of the saktis (saktiman).143 This becomes manifest by the grace of the venerable goddess Para. That also is sevenfold because the number of knowing subjects beginning with Siva and ending with sakala is stated to be seven.

In order to clarify this, it is stated in this particular order, i.e., sakala, etc. Saka/a subjects have vidya and kala as their saktis.144 The saktis that function in the inner senses and motor organs are only particular forms of these two: vidya and kola. In the case of pralayakala souls. vidya and kala remain indistinct145 because they are devoid of objects. In vijlianakala souls, vidya and kala are going to be dis-solved, but still persist aided by [their] residual traces. In mantra souls, iuddhavidya is in the process of awakening. In lords of the mantra (mantre§a) souls, suddhavidycl becomes fully awakened when the total absence of any residual trace occurs. In the case of mantramahefvara souls, foddhavidya is eager to assume the form of icchaiakti, whose innermost nature is svd ta 111 rva. With reference to Siva souls, §uddhavidya, which is of the ;1ature of wilL clearly assumes the manifest form of freedom (svtitantrya). Here ends the description of the seven principal variations of the saktiS.146 The knowing subjects possessed by these .<aktis are col-ored by them, and because of this a distinction among them arises. It is because of the difference of the instruments that a distinction"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"TANTRASARA 125 of agency is created.147 Sakti alone, which is inseparable from the agent, can be made an instrument and not anything else. Other-wise, the fallacy of infinite regress would occur. In reality, there is only one single knowing subject resting in bliss and freedom. When the earth is known in its own innate nature, at that time her innate nature alone shines; for example: \"I know the object that has been seen and experienced by Chaitra.\" In this experience, which is perceived by the powers of the sakala soul and by the one who is the possessor of all the saktis, another innate nature defi-nitely shines. This statement applies to all the knowing subjects up to Siva: \"I know the universe,\" which steadily abides in the unity of Siva and Sakti, when viewed with reference to both, and which later takes its repose in Siva because of the existence of a specific concept. ~ ~1ct~ ~ -a-\"{f(ff ~ ~= (iffiqf~ a~. attfqJ:Jfl.r aw=( $R\"'F1Ci'tm I Ci'm LT Jll ICilS~~ ~s:i(f.)l~liler, (17:fT q att(qla~ ~mTT ~ G:l\"~? 3Br ~ -~ c=rc=( ~ ~: '{=Q{C)qf<::i ttWltt>c=ct 11. fcf5 \"C1Tif \"C1Cl, ~WfITT s:i A 1 a R -:a-Uc=t fu.mf~~ Uc=t ~ ~ ~ \"Ci\"Cl· ~s:ict51~1iler ~ s:id51~1 ~ ~ fcffi'~ ~ ~ ~~~~Tf~~~{IYltti~ I 3\"f;oi~s:iAlqfia~ ~Cf \"C1Cl ~ ~ a1am H~CBT~lfi{C)4(ql(i, \"$\"fu ~ s:iAl~~'<:fiacr ~+:rRf'crtrr: ~. c=JW (1f<::f ~ fifl'l~ 31~fwli1d51f~ <liter, q '< 1~ li A I \"i i Cf) I ;'.(\"I i ~err ~ \"ti+TI\"tXffu I ~I Ci~~ fu mr~ <!')nt ~ ~crwfu f1Affll\"iT\"C1s:iAlqfu~ ~ ~ ~uffirq\"fu zjqft~ afU1cR1, a~ Ci 41 M ~ ~ s:i A 1 a R \"lT\"f( fu~ <l~ '{=Q s:i d51~1 f<:1 ~~~ -~ qs:ac;:~11c-Ad5c==ci gf~ ~~fu ~u1;:iat=aq4~ 1 Ci lcfr-qfum'<: ll 11 ~Cf5XJ)Cf5~ fi(f.)fi ~ s:iA lq(q IC1, fi(f.)flf<:1 IN \"(!Cf q IXlct~<i ~ a1aa~c=ctlc=t I ~ tl\"~ f;,uff°ff Ci'\"\"?llfllcEI 1~ ~~fu Cf5f11Cifdl:r::c=i ~~W-f1Cf5f1~ ~ s:iAlqCilliln~ ~~ffiAdlc-A\"il ~ a g: li ~ s:i fLi ff!

Then the universe, although fully manifest. would be blind and in deep slumber because it would involve the fallacy of association with two contradictory attributes: the capacity to be cognized and the quality opposite to it (viruddlzadharma~voga). That question is answered in the following way: the capacity to be cognized (vedyatvti) does not belong to the knowable object as its very self because the capacity to be cognized, belonging to the unique nature (svarllpa) [of an object], has been stated to be something different. That which first takes its repose in the energy (!fokti) of the subject, and then in the subject itself, is indeed the sharer of restfulness. That sharer of restfulness is indeed the innate nature [of any given object]. That innermost nature is indeed self-luminous and it shines with reference to none.149 Therefore, the question of omniscience, infinite regress, and con-tradiction between two opposing attributes has been refuted. That very innermost nature (svariipa) remains one, even when cognized by countless limited knowing subjects. Its character is of this singular nature because al 1 these cognitions are of the nature of manifestation (llbhtisa). Therefore, there is no hindrance regarding the rising of perceptions and inferences among dif-ferent subjects. Its character is real because it has the capacity to serve in worldly transactions~ for example, seeing a heautifUl woman watched by others, one experiences jealousy.150 Also, while"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"TANTRASARA 127 conceiving Siva as the abode of rest, one experiences absorption. Seeing an object in which a great number of subjects have been immersed, one experiences fullness. It is like watching the dance of a young woman, 151 or seeing 'blue' with its unique character-istics when it becomes merged with the subject. In this way, self-reflecting consciousness arises. Thus, everything beginning with earth and ending with prakrti is of the nature of fifteen. This is because of the fact that in sakala souls, raga and the other veils (kaiicukas) have become active, and because it is the sakala souls who are the experiencing subjects. A sakala soul has this form of fifteen characteristics because it also comes under the dominion of 'knowable [objects].' This topic has been dealt with at length in the Tantra/aka. From the puru~a152 to kala tattvas, these divisions are thirteen. Since a sakala soul is not associated with subjectivity, the two characteristics, .fokti and the possessor of sakti, do not arise. In this case, the sakala soul exists merely as the innermost nature (svarupa). When the pralayakala soul is the innermost nature and the remaining subjects are five [in number], then the distinctio~s become eleven. When, on the other hand, the vijlianakala [soul] is the innermost nature, and subjects are four, then the variations are nine. In the case when the mantra [soul] is the innermost nature, and the subjects are three, then the variations are seven. When the mantresa is the innermost nature, and the subjects are two, then the variations are five. When the mantramahefvara [soul] is the innermost nature, and the single Lord is subject, the variations become three, because of the distinction of sakti and the possessor of sakti. In the case of Siva, who is solely of the nature of light, consciousness, and freedom, there is no variation, because He is perfect in every aspect. These distinctive variations of the catego-ries were given in the text titled Para111e.~\\1ara11uttara11aya. These distinctive variations of the categories are responsible for the great variety of worlds (blwvanas). This is expressed only because the nether world, heaven, and those worlds belonging to rudras, though similar, being constituted of earth, yet have differences in"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"128 TANTRASARA their natures due to comparative remoteness.

That light which shines as nondifferent from the earth is Siva; as it is said in the Vedas: '\"The earth itself is Brah-man.\" He who is the Lord of the mantresvara [knowing subjects who represent the earth principle] sends those who are the givers of siddhis, and those who are thus sent are mantresvaras. The mantra [knowing subject] is one who is the embodiment of ego-ism. which assumes the form signified by the term mantra. The vijiianakala [knowing subject], related to the earth I principle], is one who has rid himself of sdli1khva, and other systems fol-lowed by bound souls, and practiced ptirthiva_voga hy means of saivavidyti, but was unable to attain the permanent state.154 How-ever, there are those who, at the end of the ka /pa or a ft er death, experience release from the earth as dlzartipralayakeva!as'55 by means of parthivayoga, described in the text of pafus.

The intermediate group consists of twelve tu/is; the first group of"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"130 TANTRASARA six is nirvikalpa by nature, which veils the vikalpa form of knowl-edge. Among these six tufis, one is innate nature in itself (svariipa), and the remaining five tufis are engaged in vei 1 i ng determinacy (vikalpa). The desire to open and the state of openness both consist of two tzqis because they are characterized by the wel I-manifested form of activity. This is because an action or [subtle] vibration [of an action] persists in the perceiver for more than one moment. The state of openness and the state of being an agent with regard to the objects of activity are thus established. Th us, because of the fivefold nature of determinacy (vikalpa), which is to be concealed, and because of nature in itself, the nirvikalpa state consists of six moments: the state of nirvikalpa in the process of being dissolved, the actual dissolution of vikalpa, the intention to open, the state of openness consisting of two moments, and the state of open-ness itself combined constitute the six tuf is. Its own functioning capacity is nothing but the form of being the nature of the knowing subject; therefore, it is not counted separately.

This is like the state of unhappiness resting in happiness, which begins to shine clearly only after grad-ual reduction of vikalpas. This is known as close attentiveness161 regarding relation between the perceiver and perceived. This is the view held by Abhinavagupta's teachers. When the differentiation in the form of clear manifestation of this-ness diminishes, and if it continues to diminish by twos, the aspirant attains full penetration into Siva (avesa) for the duration of two tufis. Of these two, the former is full in every respect while the second, being practiced by absorbing it into omniscience and omnipotence, rewards the aspirant with omniscience and omnipo-tence. The same is not the case with first tuf i, as stated by revered Kalla ta: '\"tuf ipata, 162 and so on.\" In this context, the word \"pa ta\" is understood to be the Devi, SrimatkalI, Matrsadbhava, Bhairava, Pratibha, etc. That is now enough of revealing what is an esoteric secret.

When knowl-edge shines as the governing agent in the form of seed alone, then this state is known as deep sleep. These three states, with refer-ence to the object of knowledge, the instrument, and the subject of right knowledge, are said to have a fourfold division each. When, however, in place of the rest of the subjects, the emergence of light occurs because of his inclination toward inwardly directed full-ness and awareness unfolds, then that state is known as the 'fourth state.' For example, the knowledge: \"I see the form by means of the instrumentality of knowledge\" transcends the knower, known, and knowledge.165 The knowledge \"I see\" rests in the subjectivity of the knower without any means and is in essence autonomy (svatantrya). This fourth state is the giver of roles such as subjectivity, instru-mentality, and objectivity, respectively, by means of proximity, middle range, and distance. It is because autonomy is the giver of the grace of these states that they are said to be threefold. The yogins acknowledge these states by the names pi~z(lastha, padastha, rapastha, and rapatita, respectively.

Now the path called kala, the subtle units of tattvas, etc., wi 11 be described. It has already been stated that the specific character which threads through all the worlds is called 'prin-ciple' (tattva). In the same way, that which invariably abides in the group of tattvas is named kala. This is because kalti is capable of fashioning or shaping (kalana) in a uniform way; for example, in regard to the principle earth, it is nivrtti because a process of the creation of the principles stops with it.166 The kala named prati~fha functions in the group of tat~v~s beginning with water and ending with pradlzana because It IS instrumental in nourishing and replenishing. The kalti named vidya functions in the group of tattvas beginning with puru~a and ending with 11u1ycl, be;ause of which knowahles begin to diminish and the ascension of consciousness occurs. From pure vidyti to the end of faktitattva the siinMkala operates. Due to its function, the activity of veils (kaiicukas) rest in tranquility. Therefore, there are four spheres167 (a~ujas): born of earth (p{/rtlziva), born of prakrti (prt1krw), horn of nuzva (mavtva), and born of sakti (saktti).

Furthermore, in the sivatattva, there is the concived kala called santatlta whose existence is created only for the purposes of instruction, meditation, and worship.169 The supreme reality possesses absolute freedom; however, even there, that which is beyond the scope of knowledge is also beyond kala (kalatita).110 Thus, the number of kalas is indeed five and the num-ber of tattvas is thirty-six. \"Rurf%\"-~~fci fum-~~a-~;:r ~ ~ I Cf)'{Ulc=ci fum -~;t crn{CTRQfm u Vc=r ~ 1 Cf5'<01cfl~~~1a~')c:C\"\"C11ct q-xr I ~}G\\Cf5~~ qxr I furrfc=rc=rfuci:i I l I (\"1 l'i I fa Cf) I ff! 4~ qxr I °ffQfq ma~&~ Tu I Cl a fci ~~mi:( I C1£1?J\" Nfu ~ l'i a mcx:rR err (,f({ a&fate14Mf, C1c1 ~Wi ffi~ ci:ild:lAl2J ~WB, ~ tJ ~-~ '~1CX:iA1Ti~· 3RCITm::ifC11f1T\"?l'imfTR1 crm~ fll(i~~l!Q\"4QCl'f1H1(1, ~R;d~j c=j fldC\"\"lfdl~Uff1l'ilf\"i~ICl:llci£8ctA efc=r q Sil Cf5M ifcrrtr: 1 ~ $1 H '1CfiM~4~ 3\"l k-A Chfl 1 , ~~ fa m Ch fl 1 , ~ ~ICICf5C1T ~ ~ac=qfufcr: I 1!cf ;::iq(\"lfdl~fq ~(1\" ~I ~m~llll4t ~a-14q{{Ciq(\"q1 ~ &furn ~ci Ti a fQ Cf)fl, c-A, ~*c;:. ~fu ~ \"C1\"2ta &futr: I ITT >Tli I a I a I ll i CfG:Tt'.EIT I s:l A I a I ~er an ci:i (\"1 '( ~(~ II l=<•ra I l'i i lF?TTtal I (\"J(W~I~ ~~:PilflCilllf QUTf~, \"ff l!Q q-3Rft f11cifa fu~ ~ ~ efc; ~Cb«1 Cf ~tT0i ~ I Qdl4;;;5iqUfAd') Y>'<~ls~1d') ITT-fu q-RqR1: 1 fffcU a f A fTTi Ti lFi '< fl ~ I '< Y)'< A f.51 A TO?i q a A ;:{;l I I I 9 I I ~Cifd 1of fuCf>qa-~ CffCff ar~cH A q '{ Cf)fl I I"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"TANTRASARA 137 34 l :r<:i a f Ci =c=q il d5 d5-q d:A ;::;i ~~cFl f1l fa ~ I I ~ I I ~~ qurf: AG:A~-Ci \"fa A ci') -a-~ 11 ~ Cil ci ~A I 3-ITT+•i cPJ)c:8 \"\"\"1 I ~ f -, ?I <:i lj)i=b f\"i Q t5 I~ ~'R:f: I I ~ I I The knowable is twofold; following its division into gross and subtle qualities, the total number of tattvas becomes ten. Instrumentality is also twofold: first, there is pure instrumentality, and second, instrumen-tality is connected with agenthood. Thus, the number of tattvas also becomes ten. Next to them are five tat-tvas where instrumentality has become subordinate and agenthood has become distinctly prominent. Next come five tattvas that are the result of the purity of agent-hood. The next five tattvas are those whose distinction from one another dissolves with the intention toward fullness. The thirty-sixth is the principle known as Siva, who is free from all Ii mitations. When this is taught or meditated upon, that in which the mind gets a solid base is called the thirty-seventh principle. When this princi-ple is also made an object of meditation, then the num-ber of principles becomes thirty-eight: this does not involve infinite regress, however. because when Siva, who is associated with unlimited freedom, is being meditated upon, it terminates in the thirty-seventh tat-tva. 171 However, the thirty-sixth principle has to be con-ceived of as beyond al 1 other principles.

On the other hand, the instruction given above can also lead others to initiation (dik~a), performance of the rituals, etc. Therefore, it is necessary to give an account of the nature of initiation (dlk~a), rituals, and so on. Here the question arises: Who is entitled to receive initia-tion? In order to answer this question, the topic of the \"descent of grace' (saktipata) is going to be discussed. Some are of the opin-ion that worldly existence, which is rooted in ignorance, occurs as a result of a lack of knowledge, but when ignorance is removed upon the rise of knowledge, 175 the descent of grace takes place. However, they should explain why and how this right knowledge develops. If it is the outcome of deeds, then it would not be dif-ferent from the results of actions; it would be a contingency of being an object of enjoyment. If the person who is the enjoyer (enjoying an object) is accepted as the recipient of grace, then the 'f~llacy of wideness' (atiprasa~1ga) occurs. If the wi 11 of the Lord is supposed to be the cause of saktipata, then the \"fallacy of mutual dependence' (anyonyafrayata) occurs and, moreover. it serves no purpose. This theory would also entail the question of the Lord's partiality. Furthermore, it is not tenable to assume that mutually opposed actions, having equal capacity to suppress each other, could balance (past) actions in order that the descent of grace might occur.176 This view is not tenable because actions are sequential and therefore are unable to oppose one another. Even if it is accepted that they might oppose each other. the ques-tion is raised as to how other actions, which are not opposing one another, bestow their results. If actions that are not contradictory to one another do not occur, then one would instantaneously drop one's body. It is not correct to say that only the actions bestow-ing the results of birth and life span are not suspended, and that only those acts that grant experiences of happiness and suffer-"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"TANTRASARA 141 ing remain suspended. This view is incorrect because it does not answer the question of why, even if it is assumed that the descent of grace occurs in the presence of such actions, grace is afraid of the deeds that bestow the results of experience. Furthermore, if the question of grace could be satisfactorily resolved by resorting to the theory of the ripening of impurities, 177 then the question of the nature of this theory needs to be answered, as well as the question of its cause. By this question, all possible causes, such as detachment, specific form of merit, service to righteous people, association with saintly persons, and the worship of deities stand refuted. Thus, arguments advanced by dualists are repudiated as incoherent. According to this nondual system of the autonomous Lord. we maintain the position that the great Lord, by way of sportful play, veils his innate nature and takes up the form of a bound being (pasu); however, there is no contradiction regarding the distinc-tion of space, time, and his innate nature.178 Similarly, the Lord, by removing (the freely chosen) limitations upon his innate nature, reveals himself either instantaneously179 or gradually180 to that recipient of grace cal led a limited knowing subject (a~w).181 Th~ great Lord is in essence autonomous, and it is He who causes saktz to descend; therefore, the descent of grace, which is dependent on nothing, becomes fruitful by the realization of one's innate nature. However, for one desirous of enjoyment (blzogotsuk~sya), the descent of grace depends on his deeds. Upon one desirous of otherworldly enjoyments (lokottaranipabhogotsukasya), grace descends through the agency of Rudra, Vi~t)U, and Brahma, the presiding authorities functioning in the sphere of maya, [who are] impelled only by the will of the supreme Lord. This kind of grace yields resu I ts such as the attainment of the status of mantra know-ing subject (mantrapram(zta). etc., and (the capacity for) discrimi-nation between [the principles of] mayti and puru~a, puru~a and kaUi, pun1~a and prakrti, and puru~a and buddhi, and thus bars that kind of person from enjoying those fruits belonging to the lower principles. For one desirous of enjoyment and liberation, the"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"142 TANTRASARA descent of grace has to depend on rituals when it comes to enjoy-ments and is dependent on nothing when it comes to liberation; therefore, the descent of grace is both dependent and non-depen-dent. It is not proper to ask why the descent of grace occurs only for that particular person. This is simply because the great Lord shines in that particular way. This being the case, then to which person might this kind of injunction related to (the enjoyment of) some object be directed?182 ~ m-ti mnsq1al ;:rcrm, -cft~-+:fa:f-A\"\"G:~ ~-m~­~: -g;~fu~, <l?r 3fe!')~a1 ~ ~ 11f51I=a14-;:rqfa-TUI: fCI ~ fli ~ «'1 mm~~ ~~ ~~ fcFtcr mJ11qqJf~ mm~ J1f1Rf<1t:ll a ~ w ;:r t11•:i <:zn fu Cf.)flFi 1 cnrf~. 3-T?ITfq-a 1 ~a RO:Hi 'id:I a= -$il§l~fo51q1a ~. ~ mfui:rc=a ~llf511W~a-TI ~ql~ll'l mf(r, ' ~ Rfmm=rf~~~ 3mmf~ mfc=ri:i~IJIA~ ~. ~w ~mm ~m;:r -c=rffiR-m ~~ ~ 1 ' ' ' ~~ ~ :wnfzj'~f;:rdt ~~ldHi eftC1C1l'llfucp~~ I ~~ ffimq1a1c=t ~{)ru~~1 f~~1f11 ~. ~~ ~~ ffimq1a1<lq-1 ~~ ~ am1f5la=c=a$1Hq_uf: mam=t 'l1JlqJ:{q~ l!Cf, mfTFJlsfq \"fef~ZH\"ci$1HCi~Cf +:JlaCf>c--8 W °l1fJlifcH~ m'l11JliMldU~lfuAfcH~~~~ I ~~ ~ \"ffCf l!Cfl l!ci ~: l1~= ~afDli cfta=ri ~fu ~ \"f1\"U ~ ~ irqfu Jft\"crnfr.r. 3l?r 31cff!T~ Cf.)~ ~11f5ltim~ ~~~ ' ' ' \"ci fltl I~ I C1 $ fli I tl lfl ~zy I 31~ I f1 d al CIT ~ \"f1\"U l!Cf \"ITTUTf~f Jf(f)f man r=riffi, m \"fl mUTfilOT gq Cf5mf ~ Cf~ ~I m~m 3fei')te1A~ ffimq1a1a, ~amnTsfq fCl1c-i:i;::i: ft?lqCill'li ~ c=rw 1<t>~faqr=rr irqfu, m(ll:ff~q1Cf.)ct\")~ur Q; ~~ r~ l!Cf, \"A\"m~ \"fl ~ldCil<ij)cnTSfq m\"Tffi~: irafu ~ c=r2tcr cftam:rf ~i\"J IJ1;:oiA_, \"ff u mm~ JR~q ~-g;:r mrt ~UQT ~~ fuq l!Cf I Rq')tC/A~ ~~ur mn ~UQT ~1ac=q~ ~. ~ +:r~ &mmm~CPffi ~ ~UR~ (ftll ~ -~,QcHA~idJmq1~Ci~I l'lCiffi~ 3-it~~'"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"TANTRASARA 143 ~~I A 01 <:fl~ &J ~ m a=rcr<:f Tf\"I C\"C1 i=l 3lC1: \"W'm41<\"1 {<)4 a I I ~ Cil'{ciRJilf( ~fu~, ~~ ~~ ~1fffiq1a: I ~wlalC:.l'ii ~ '{IJ11i~ ~ma=i1:r:aa1$IB~~rcra~1 fi1a~1ftll1f~i~~~. m ~ ~ t::OI ~ ~ 3lfq ~ uRT Ql'{fi'{I CIT,~~ ~1RP41Cil ftjfu3i1sftr Cil'{C\"1R=i~Rrx\"'i1Ci_ fcm:IB, ~ c?lru1a1ru~ tP=ta:nruwA01 ~-~ u ~ 1caqR:q Id): ~:ill\"uf~J ldC\"tll5U~l lf5i4'{AlfUct51R:a1J:t l!Rr, ~ 3CT1 ~fr:Ef)~ ur 3FR1~~~ I cmsfq 3\"Ef5A i=l ~ 3Rl 1!Cf 31tmtH~ 11 fH m ~sfq ~ AOsC'iAl?l~~f~sfq 3Rfuct51Ra1:, Jlcl~ W 31ITTTU'<~l lf\"t;:i ~f<Oj)a ~ 101~fa-~offC1lf( ~ ~~ I ~ u ~ftrcpl w 3\"11 a 1 ~1 en a1Q\"5: ~~, \"fl 7aTti ~uf~ '(!Cf \"fn:if~ -~ fcHr cft\"arruf:fqR: 1 mm~ 4iC1l«!>~ ~ -afu 3q1~1qa~ 3\"iOQaf%aAa tpff mc1 vrm: 3q1~1~~~ ~ ~ -eq ~ mfilsfq 31~trraffl ~a fa 1d5I5~ a-fl LT ~ 11~ g?~ f<.=t 1 sai:IT~-a·-~rr.=fll~ arm ~ ~ crffi1 I ~uf$1 HlJ){i~ Pl c=f._.}ITT:rf~Tfl\"Bq I ~ msftr ~\"CF( f°tjq•f)ci en ~~ fc5 ~ ~I~: I \"4Ci $fu ~11:\" I ~ IB ~Of$1 HC\"CI lfl gq WlTUmcf ~ 3\"i a i:F\"11 fG: d') Tu 6Q J I a \"4Ci ch ;:i Rm 3\"l ~1 J ~(\"Ci H 1-~cH=a (\"Ci I ra 'i I R fl:t ti \"i ~ ~. %q1f\"t2l ~a~1ti ~UT.'-;::r af\"l:ill'i 1~3q~~ Wn:>41ctT FR-qa:r l!Cf-d5Af~R~~LlafUTTC1 I The descent of grace is ninefold, with three variants: intense, moderate, and slow, combined with a further threefold division: supremely intense, moderately intense, and mildly intense. The occurrence of supremely intense descent of grace results in the fall of the body. whereupon the state of Paramesvara is attained. With the descent of moderately intense grace, the recipient is himself firmly convinced of the nature of reality and does not require any aid either from the scriptures or from a teacher. In him, intuitive knowledge opens automatically (prtitibha}Fzdnodaya~z), where-upon, without undergoing external forms of purificatory rites, he becomes the giver of enjoyment and liberation to others. This kind of recipient of grace is called a teacher of prtitiblza type. This person is not required to observe any customary behavior as used"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"144 TANTRASARA in society. Even among the prtitibha type there may be the pos~i­bility of comparative distinctions among recipients of grace. This is because of the diverse nature of the wi 11 of the Lord. Though being intuitive by nature, the person endowed with this type of grace may rely on the scriptures; this he does only for the verifica-tion of truth. Thus, some teachers belonging to the pr ti tiblu1 type may not be established in the sastras while others may be well established in scriptural knowledge. Therefore, they are of vari-ous types, but in all the cases the element of intuition (pratibha) reigns supreme. In the presence of the teachers of the prtitib/za t~pe, other teachers have no authority. Just as in dualist systems (Saiva Siddhanta), sivas who have attained I iberation are unable to perform the functions of creation, destruction, etc., in the pres-ence of the beginingless Siva. From the descent of mildly intense grace, a desire to approach a.righ~ kind of teacher183 develops, while one's leanings in the direction of incompetent teachers disappear. It is only because ?f grace that one goes toward the right kind of teacher from an mc?mpetent one. The true teacher is fully conversant with the entire truth contained in sastras. He is none other than the revered Lord Bhairava. Even a yo gin is the giver of release to others only through the knowledge gained by practice. In this regard, his com-pete~cy as teacher comes from his identity with Siva, while the ~ovelmess and charm that he might possess are not essential. The mcompetent teacher might possess all these other 4ual ities except union with Siva. Thus, the person who feels a desire to approach [such a] teacher receives initiation, characterized by knowledge, th rough which he immediately attains liberation while still living (jivanmukti). This initiation takes place in different ways: hy mere glance (avalo-kana), through discourse, by enlightening the disciple regard-ing fastras, by means of viewing external rites, or by offering semen and menstrual fluids. A person we! I practiced in meditation, etc., receives initiation at that time which severs the bond of vital energy (prti~za): however, this kind of initiation should be given"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"TANTRASARA 145 only at the time of death. This particular type of initiation will be explained later. Thus, the intense type of descent of grace is of a threefold nature. One who receives initiation as a result of supremely moder-ate grace does not feel a deep conviction regarding his identity with Siva. However, by gradual ripening of that realization, he becomes Siva after he drops his body. One upon whom grace descends in a moderately moderate manner, although eager to attain Sivahood, is overwhelmed by the desire for enjoyment. In spite of this, this kind of person is a recipient of the pure knowl-edge granted to him through initiation. He, in the present body, experiences enjoyments obtained by the practice of yoga and becomes Siva at the time of dropping his body. From the mildly moderate descent of grace one attains Sivahood only after experi-encing enjoyments in another body after dropping the present one. Thus, the moderate type of grace is also threefold. When a person's eagerness for the enjoyment of pleasures dom-inates, then the nature of grace is said to be slow. The recipient of this grace becomes eager to attain identity with supreme Lord through the means of yoga, such as repetition of mantra; beca~se mantras and the practice of yoga finally terminate in liberation, they are decidedly of the nature of grace. Here also, as a result of comparative distinction, the mild descent of grace is threefold. These are the main principles of the descent of grace. Regard-ing Vai~l)avas and other systems, the descent of grace is like _the grace of the king and therefore does not culminate in liberatwn; therefore, th is type is not going to be discussed here. It has already been stated that in every descent of grace, sakti abides as insepara-ble from Siva; however, this cannot be the 'supreme one' Uye~fha), but either fearsome ( f?/wrd) or dreadful (ghoratama).184 Although already diverse, the descent of grace becomes further differenti-ated by means of comparative gradation. A person belonging to the Vai~l)ava and other orders, who follows the method prescribed by the teacher but at the same time follows this sastra of the five-fold current, becomes in due order sufficiently mature and is able"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"146 TANTRASARA to gain the highest competency for receiving the Trika, the all-transcending and supreme sastra, which is revealed by the Lord. Others attain (the highest competency for receiving the Trika) by skipping some stages, thus creating indefinite divisions. Yet oth-ers may attain (the same competency) instantaneously, i.e., with-out any sequence (akrama). Thus, teachers belonging to the lower orders are not entitled even to see the sacred diagram (mm:ujala), while the teacher belonging to the higher orders is instrumental in enlivening the lower doctrines. He is able to do th is because, on account of his perfection, he is entitled to al 1 the sclstras. This kind of person is a teacher (daisika), a guide (guru~z), one who fol-lows the rules and teaches others to follow them (dcii rya), an ini-tiator (dik~aka~z), or a voracious reader (cumbakaM. Among them, the best one is that one in whom the fu 11 ness of know ledge has completely flourished, without which the fulfillment of initiation, etc., would be impossible. . A yo gin who is associated with a person desirous of attain-mg results is capable of granting him immediate results by instructing him to adopt a certain means (upaya) which will lead him to his goal. If that person, through the means taught to him, remains concentrated only on knowledge, then he may also attain liberation. A person desirous of having perfect knowl-edge should approach many teachers; he should remain close to them. hoping to attain ever more superior knowledge of different kinds. However, abandoning a teacher perfect in knowledge defi-nitely requires a need for expiation (prclva.fritta). The question might arise: What if the teacher does not~ give instruction, or he gives erroneous instruction~ shouldn't one aha ndon him? To that we reply, \"no,'' as that kind of teacher is free from attachment because he has attained perfect knowledge and therefore has no personal reasons for not revealing secrets. The teacher's silence might be the result of lack of merit on the side of disciple or for want of a surrendering spirit in the disciple. This disciple should continue to make an effort to serve this kind of teacher and should not abandon him.

The activity of an enlightened one, being blamed as a forbidden behavior, makes the unenlight-ened become doubtful of his potency. which is the functioning of the 'power of veiling' (tirobhavasakti). This causes an enlightened one to sink into the morass of delusion. This veiling has no effect on a person upon whom grace has fallen. In this instance, as in the previous example, it is not depen-dent on deeds. In all of the following cases, because of the diver-sity of the will of the Lord, tirobhava persists: it results in suffer-ing to be experienced only in this body; or in initiation followed by practice according to convention, such as serving a teacher, a deity, or sacrificial fire; or finding fault with them, like those engaged in service or blame; or like those who were engaged in a doctrinal order of Siva, and who later abandon it. Even in these examples of being influenced by tirobhava, one may himself receive the descent of grace as a result of the wonderful manifes-tation of Lord's will, or one may receive grace even after death through his teacher or relative. Thus, one is the sharer of the five functions of the Lord coherently united in one's own self. There-fore, he is none other but Paramesvara and should not think of himself as being separate from him. The Lord, who by nature is without any veil, covers his nature of light by his freedom of will; in the same way he unfolds it as well. In the domain of his non-enlight-ened state, he behaves 1 ike an enlightened one and later wakes up. The nature of the descent of grace is to be independent.

Therefore, for the purpose of determining the real character of initiation, the duties preliminary to it will be presented. Bathing (snclna) is said to be purity, and purity should be understood as absorption into the pure essence of the great Lord (Paramesvara). Removal of impurity is indeed purification. Although identical with the innermost nature, impurity is errone-ously regarded as being associated with characteristics extrane-ous to it. For example, the conviction that the innermost nature, although present in the Self as well as in the universe, which is in essence perfectly free, blissful, and is consciousness alone, is negated when it is associated with characteristics different from consciousness. This erroneous notion is called impurity, which is removed by means of absorption into the great Bhairava. In some, this absorption occurs instantaneously, while oth-ers require a means (upaya) for attaining it. This division of the means in regard to different people may vary as one, two, three, or they may be taken as a whole, or individually. This absorption can happen to any individual, anywhere and at any time. In this way. the division of the means becomes diversified based on the attain-ment of the firm conviction (tisvasa) in the nature of reality on the part of a practitioner. . Furthermore, this absorption is eightfold. By means of medita-tion on the very nature of Paramesvara, and by the power of the placement of the mantras (nytisa) in the eightfold form of Siva, i.e., the earth, water, air, fire, ether, moon, sun, and the self (titma), and in one's own body by gaining identity with it. one becomes firmly absorbed in Paramesvara. In this way, a 1 imited soul, which functions differently as a body, etc., attains absorp-tion in the Lord. But to some (for those whose conviction is not as firm) bathing and putting on fresh clothing cause satisfaction. Therefore, they are r;garded as the means for attaining Paramesvara.

The mantra as a unifying element assumes the form of this eightfold division mentioned before. However, in regard to the vlras, 185 they assume a specific nature; they are as follows: the dust emerging out of the union (ranare~zu), the water of the vira, the great air. the ashes of the vira, the sky above the funeral ground, the moon and the sun as connected with the previ-ous two, and the self free from thought constructs. This bathing, with variations of external and internal, is of two types.186 The external form is performed by attaining identity with the mantra, and when this is attained, one is to be dissolved into Siva.187 However, its particular form is carried out by means of looking at the delightful substance (wine) in a vessel used by viras and having made it of the nature of Siva, one should worship the host of mantras in that very vessel. Then the 'wheel of deities' who are abiding in both body and prti~za should be worshipped by that very substance. This is known as the principal bath. The inner bath is performed by means of concentration of the mind ?Y the respective forms of dlulra~zti in the center of the earth. etc., m order to become identical with that wheel of deities.

If any other characteristic is mentioned, it is given only because it is instrumental in granting identification with the object of meditation, which is attained because of mental tran-quility. Therefore, there is no place similar to a place of worship. The sacred spot (pifha), the mountaintop, etc., taught in the sastras as places of worship should be known as supporting this description. The energies (5aktis), possessing the state of absorp-tion into Paramesvara and in accordance with his restrictive energy (niyati). incarnate themselves at the various sacred places. like the regions inhabited by the Aryans190 of good moral conduct. and also the regions of barbarians prone to immorality. The moun-taintops and other similar places are conducive to concentration because of being isolated (solitary) and free from distraction.

If this 'placement of man-tras' (nyasa) is done with only one of these two, then it should first be performed with malinl, followed by matrka. If nyasa is done for the purpose of attaining mok:;a, then it should be done from the feet al I way to the top of the head. However, if enjoyment (blzoga) is the objective, then it should be done in reverse. The goddess malinl is the principal form of sakti which, because of the close union of vowels (bljas) and consonants (yonis), is capable of fulfilling all sorts of desires. Her name is aptly significant. She is adorned with a garland of rudrasaktis blossoming in fruits. She is the hum-ming bee of sound (nada), capable of dissolving the ice of worldly existence. She bears both spiritual perfection (siddlzi) and libera-tion (mok!fa). She is associated with both the saktis of offering and accepting, for the syllables \"ya\" and \"ra\" are identical, according to Par)ini. Therefore, even the application of the mantra, which has lost its traditional procedure, becomes perfect (comes to its fruition) by the power of placement of mtilinl.

The manifestation of conscious-ness itself is the center (madhya), because all the different mani-festations of directions make their appearance from that center. The direction of 'above' is the region which is appropriated by the light, but the direction which is not so (i.e., 'below') is the 'nether' region. The 'east' is that which remains in front of that I ight. The direction different from it is the 'west' because the 'east' receives the light facing it. The 'south' is the direction towards which the currents of light ascend. It is called 'south' (dak~i~w) because of its agreeableness. The direction facing it is the 'north' because it is the region to be illuminated. This is the description of the fourfold directions.

Thus, it is because of greatness of consciousness that the directions are mani-fested, which are caused by the forms.195 For this reason, direction is not a separate principle (tattva); just as when one wants to cross over one's own shadow, it (the shadow) always remains in front. In this same way, the Lord always remains in the center. It has been stated that superior to all is the state of being in the center. Thus, as the Lord is the agent causing the division of directions, so also is the sun. It has been stated in different texts that the sun indeed is the Lord's power of knowledge Uiitinasakti). The east is that where the manifestation of light first occurs. Where manifestation occurs, it (the east) is definitely there. Although the directions, such as east, etc., are dependent on the self, i.e., are subjective, the region that remains in the front of a person is (always) east. Thus, the determination of direction should be accomplished by bringing the self, the sun, and the L?rd into one single concept. This is the knowledge regarding direction as thought by Abhinavagupta's teachers. This being the case, one should sit facing north, and by aban-doning a sense of egoism (alza111blzava), one should burn ~he egoism of possessing a body in both the gross and subtle bodi.es. Though the body still exists, it should be looked at as the bodi.es of others, for the Self is without a body. Then one who is steadily es ta bl ished in the tranquil and unchanging abode has a natur~l inclination towards creativity. The first vibrative fractional umt of it is indeed the arising of form (miirti). Conceiving thus, one should install on that form (miirti) the host of divinities that are worshipped, as it was prescribed before. Principally, the saktis should he worshipped, for they are the seats of the nine-formed energy belonging to the Lord. This is the view of our teachers. There are five states beginning with waking, etc., but the sixth is called anuttara, the 'innate state' (svabhava da§a), which is to be conceived as uniting all. Therefore, placement (nyasa) should be sixfold (upon the six cakras). In these different cakras.

By the application of nyasa, one attains the fullness of Lord Bhairava, who transcends the phenomenal principles. In this way, the state of Bhairava becomes manifest. Therefore. in the case of those who have attained the state of identity with Bhairava, the performance of nyasa, etc., is meaningless. For those who are established in the tranquil state, what could be the utility of creat-ing principles, nyasa, etc.? In reply to this, we say that the tran-quil state of the body of Bhairava is so vast that he is the final terminating point in whose own nature the diversity of manifesta-tions, dissolution, and creation remains manifest.

One should make this differ-ence the seat of an all-pervasive superintending agent, so that it may become one's basis. Then the desired deity should be con-ceived as abiding there. The offering of the entire being to that, which is the very essence of all entities, is called worship (puja). That, which brings about absorption into it, is known as medita-tion (dhyti na). The inner reflection of that, of nature existing in the form of the primal sound (ntida), continuously oscillating, is the repetition of mantra Uapa). Following the order of cognition of this very type, by whose force the great fire has been awakened, and which has brought the entire universe to identity with one's own Self (visviitmikara~zam), is known as lzoma. After perform-ing that, one should meditate on all the attending deities as arising from the mass of fire as its ignited sparks, and one should worship them in the above manner. Meditating on the trident from the root extending up to the end of twelve and resting at the top of the wheel of the goddess (devicakra), one who becomes free from sequence attains the state of wandering in the void of consciousness. From the base to the end of twelve, passing like a staff, this consciousness wandering through the void is char-acterized hy its identification with the void beyond the void. This is indeed void because of wandering through the void, abiding in the void, and swallowing the nectar of the void. ~ 3•F-a l:l fl I li I ?I I a Cf Cl f(j)Ci : Cl') Ci CJ?

However, even for him, the inner form of ritual is essential for the removal of the state of the bonded soul (pa.fu). When the external form of ritual is not firmly estab-lished in his essence, then because of the strength of his desire it becomes the giver of purity.

The person who is related to him in connection with study of the text and the person who has been previously initiated should be looked upon with regard. For the purpose of paying rega~ds, one should not think of them as having been born of sexual union. It should be kept in mind that this does not come automatically. Barren women should not be looked down upon as the cause of hatred. The name of the deity, the name of the teacher, and the 1~antra should not be uttered except during performance of the ntuals. One should not make use of the bed, etc. which has been used by the teacher. Wordly sports. whatever they may be, should not be done before the teacher. One should not regard others as superior to one's own teacher. On occasions such as ceremonial rites observed for a deceased person, only the spiritual guide is to be worshipped. During occasional rites, one should not utter the w~rd sakinl, etc. One should perform worship on the days of festivals. One should not associate closely with Va i ~1)avas and others who hold a lower view of the truth. One should not look at those belonging to this doctrine as being members of their former castes, but as being identical to Siva. 201 When the members of the teacher's family come to the house, one should perform sacrifices a~cor~ing to one's ability.

Then, one should worship the milrti-cakra in the foregoing manner. In this way, the disciple becomes the follower of conventional rules which lead him to the ultimate. One earns competency in the practice of mantra, daily rituals, in listening to a holy text, and in its study. In regard to occasional worship, only the teacher is to be prayed to. This concludes the instruction on the subject of conventional rules. After meditating on all the paths abiding in one's own Self, one should conceive one's self as being full.

After this, in the small jar, in the big jar, in the sacred diagram, in the fire, and in one's own self, these five substratums are to be unified with nonduality. Then he should perform the specific worship with flowers, etc., which were nour-ished by the nectarine fluid of the supreme Lord's essence of non-duality. Furthermore, one should fill the ritual ground with liba-tions of water and materials for offering, free from any deceit regarding the spending of money. If the person lacks money, then the ritual called mahtima~z(lalayaga should not be performed. He should offer living animals. In this way, the animals also become recipients of grace.

Here the distinction in attainment lies in the nature of one's latent impressions (vasana), for mantras grant different results according to one's latent desires. Therefore, ascertaining the nature of the latent desires of the disciple, the teacher cogni~es the principal mantra internally and meditates on his identity wi~h nondual Siva, and by doing so he purifies all the paths abiding m the disciple's body. In this way, his body, from the small toe to the \"end of twelve' (dvadastinta), and his consciousness should be made one with the body and the consciousness of the disciple.

It is true to say that grace has unthinkably glorious capacity. Thus the soul, which is drawn by the application of the net, enters the figure made of kufa grass or the fruit of a jtiti (Jas-minum grandiflorum). However, it does not move because of the absence of the mind and the vital energy, or the totality of causes, but by the force of deep contemplation-it does indeed m~ve.

Thus rescued, the soul, by the final oblation, attains liberation, whether it was in hell, the world of the spirit, or in the world of lower animals. But if the soul is living as a man, then he obtains at that moment knowledge, yoga, initiation, or discernment, because the body of the teacher is a competent authority regarding this. This is the procedure for rescuing the dead. This is the method for a person who is alive but absent when the descent of grace occurs. Only the figure made of kusa gra~s and attraction are excluded. In this regard, the appearance of his thorough contemplation is sufficient for his purification. Initiation, again, is the bestower of both enjoyment and lib-eration, because latent traces of the impression of past deeds are strong and because it is impossible to root out all these desires. In initiation, the consecration performed according to the procedure of the higher doctrine is stronger, but that of the other inferio: doctrines requires further consecration for the purpose of puri-fication. Even the person who is initiated in absentia experiences manifestation of knowledge, and so on.

When a person remaining in the lower order, being keenly touched by the power of the Lord, becomes inclined to approach the true teacher, he should, after purification, be given initiation even though he was for-merly engaged with a false teacher. 3l~ I ti'.ll~~l'\"i l~Cb'\"\"t I 3lmF'~1 fa\"~ta$11R-i ffi~ ~ m m~sact -<:f(1: ~a:tu1~1;ITsfCr $1Hci1;:icr m~ ~~gffi'<u1 er~ ;:i-~. 3lfuf~sftr I ~(f)IH\"!AcfoT 11~ crranfG: ~~ Jrfq ;:i-~IB. ia ~ ~~qj~;:r ~ fcrU~IQG:G:lfu;n ~ 1!Cf ~ cfta:tltl(f)'{Dfl{,"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"TANTRASARA 181 msfiTI~ i:t T\"?I a a Ci I Ci I~ I c-R:'l ~ ~Io i:t I Ria') ~ J1q6l i:t f°tj ~l lSf1: iJ1 I £H: o'J-;:r fq 'a I ci a ~?~ f fl, Ci c;:;::i :r:a { ~cmcIT cft a-TI\"fil 31f~, ITT ~ w:ITR:TR cn-aTc=r, -;:r q mm q R ~Q:c=r, cm~ $1Ha:1 ~ GfT af<:r, (§C{1 lJ ~,a $1 H i:i ~ ~ ~ an=r, 3Bf ~ 3:rR4 ~Cf) ra ~ a a crJ11 ract5J:t 1 ~~fa $11 \"'i Ci~ I ~cltmmfuct51'<C\"li ~I mu a>lJ)'6Ci 1 ~~ l I-~ IB Cf514ttict~ I I ~ ml=fG:T~ca1a14fcHruci C\"1;;:;;51f\"tl{ 31f~ct5~Cf51~1.-f ~ 3\"ite.llG:~li:t l~d5\"{ I I 9 (,I I Chapter Eighteen The anointment (abhi~eka) The person in whom maturity of knowledge has developed should be given anointment in order to follow the course of a sadhaka, or to become a spiritual guide (guru) to others.

However, the former one, who possesses knowledge, incurs sin because he is duty-bound, for he is consid-ered to be the bes tower of the status of the lord of vidva.

However, he should not initiate an unworthy one, nor should he avoid one who is worthy. 223 Even the initiated one should be tested by a teacher while bestowing knowledge. The person who receives knowledge deceitfully should be looked at with indifference after this is known to be so. In this anointment. worship of the deities should be performed in accordance with the financial capacity of the person concerned. The person who himself is well practiced in knowledge and bears the authority in himself, and is able to trans-mit that knowledge to others, possesses the nature of a sadhaka on the way to becoming a spiritual guide. Such a person should be given anointment. 31[1 Cb l \"i fci ~ I J:il ~ ct5 'i I 31~ 31~ ~cfTfll\"ilJifq Ji{Olfi~~;:a{ ~~f~ Tf:mq1ali1ma-cr ~@l'<l'L~i cfta-Tt q)')<:lf<\"t, 3'~~ c:bL<\"H\"iJ\"lliHP=t ~cpCi>il<:i~:h1Hll=( -~ ~~ I ITT m ~~ fufw sm: ~ ~ ~ ~ Q1Cfcx:r:, ~rrrf~ ~ 1a~1 ;fl~, ~CITTi ~ >id)fci'<'ld>~ flSkli<:ilA~f~ fct'5<:11$1HWl161C\"\"11<\"1 q)')~fa, ITT ~ldfJl\"t'rt °ffe<l'<ct'Silur +:F?lli ~ J11Mct'Silur ~ ~~~;:i~g;:i1~ ~ ->i101fh011-<ctJila1 ~ ~ cvrrnt -a-~ ~1a~1'{17{ ~ 1 C1<1= q-<Af°??rn m~~ ~ ~ ~ ~urf~c:qr, ~~ ~~1~1i:t ~~ err ~an ~ ~-a ~ mm 1ilf'\"fl\" ~~ \"fl~ '1')01fc=t 1 (f?f 6TBRf fufti ~ ;:ta~~ ~ c=rcITm tlh:f~ m~ ml 011Cf)1~ ~TRlm~ma1~1,R:i~fciq~i tLrrnn ~m mmR ~~. ~ct mmma ~~ efc=Rcr 'mlfu' ~f~cn~~anuW{ 31 ~Ci ij-;:nfq ~ cpc=rrclc=rr c=rwftr ~~an: f~~~ q)(Vf~~ «d I 01\" ~ \"fl\"cf~~ , ~~a-nm c=R=lf'<:rmef~ 3m\"J:{ -JITcrc=r: ~ e:11 3ql50Frr'R:ilfld<\"l I Cifd$11~ ~ Cf>Ts~ ~~~CG.l;ffi"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"TANTRASARA 183 fcrfq: ~rIT-Ci;;::+:J'<oi c=rfutllflCilR~i qcffdA ~~1i-<011a CilciCi: fiCiH+<\"l ('.!Cf)flfd;;::+:J 1?1-lRBT~ J1lck1'i $\"1HMliJfiaHra<Hict~ I ~ q 3Br ~G:fum ~ra~ ~~ Wr .mr~C§,1Aai:t. c=rfufu~ q~ ~MR-lct5~ct51~1~ I 3\"1~~§q'<:: fuqT d~ICi<:ililJEOllf°a ti ~ \"L:!Cf ~ ~~ ~ fcf5 d 1Ci'1fl i:t I 3q1l'lqf{Cf)fY~I ~ CiG.l~HIAl?lch ra~rnm ~ ~ qRf1iascqq1~ ~u: 11 ~ .~th=ref~ L(i I a I <lfu'<:\"f-a-a-Ci~ f1 I { ~ea I~ Cf) I~ I ;i ;:rn=r ect>l ~ fCi ~I A I ~ct5J:t I I 9 ~ I I Chapter Nineteen People, and even teachers, who followed lower doctrines should be given an initiation called the 'final purificatory rite' or 'last sacra-ment' (antyasali1skara dik$a), 224 which should be performed fol-lowing the procedure of reclaiming the dead, provided the descent of grace has touched them. The same applies to those who had fol-lowed the order of the higher doctrines, but who have fallen from the right path and have not performed any rites of atonement. This is the command of the great Lord. All that was described as the procedure for the reclaiming of the dead should be performed on the corpse. The burning of the body is done as the final oblation. The teacher should perform the final rite for the dead person, for the confirmation of the faith (pratyaya) of the ignorant, 225 according to his power of activ-ity, knowledge, and yoga. Then, in the body of the deceased, the teacher should place the mantras (nyasa) from the feet to the head, and, drawing the departed soul near by the application of the net, he should arrest it, penetrate it, stir it, and enliven it with the transmission of the vital energy to the heart, the throat, and on the forehead. In this way, the corpse begins to shake. Then, the rite"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"184 TANTRASARA of the unification with the great Lord being performed, the body should be burnt as the final oblation. After this, the initiation called fraddhadlksa226 should be per-formed even for those who have been purified by means of th~ final rites of the dead, and also for those who have not been puri-fied in this manner. For them, this final rite should be performed on the third or fourth day, every month, or every year. . Then, completing the rite ending with oblation into the fire, one should take up a food offering in one of his hands and, con-ceiving his power as the virile energy of the Lord representing the enjoyable object, which has assumed the power abiding in the limited self and has made her identity with it, contemplating thus, the performer should offer it to the great Lord, the supreme agent of the enjoyable object. 227 In this manner, when enjoyment ceases, one becomes indeed the master. Although by means of initiations, such as the rite for t,h~ dead, the reclamation of the body, and initiation during t~e sraddha ceremony, one attains the fulfillment of one's aim in r~gar~ t? those who are desirous of enjoyment, an abundance 0! ntuahst1c activities are performed for the attainment of a plenI-tude of fruits.

But the knower of reality needs no procedure beginmng ~1th the final ritual for the dead (offering into the flame) and en~­mg with fraddha, etc. The death of such a person is a \"day of festi-val' (parvadinam) for the disciples, for it fulfills the shortcomings of consciousness of those who follow the lineage. The descendent of the teacher has a single end which, in essence. is nothing but the supreme reality. This day of ceremony is like the day of receiving the seed of the lineage from the teacher while he was alive. Everywhere in the ritualistic procedure of .fraddha, etc., the mlirtiyaga is the most important one. This is supported by the doc-trine called Sri Siddhamata.

That initiation, which is given to those worthy of knowledge for the purpose of steady attainment of purification, is also given to those unworthy of knowledge, but to them it is given for the purpose of attainment of liberation. This type of initiation is the ~ablja type. 228 Thus, having given initiation. the teacher should mstruct the disciple about the duty to be performed during the remaining period of his life. The duty for the rest of [the initiate'sJ life is threefold: indis-pensable observances (nitya), occasional observances (naimittika). and those performed with a particu Jar desire (kcl mya). The last one is only observed by those desiring enjoyments (sddlzaka) and therefore will not be described here. The nitya is the one which occurs regularly: the naimittika is the one by which one is able to attain oneness with the Lord. The auxiliaries to it are the prayers during the junctures (sandhya) of the day. which are to be per-formed on a daily basis, on the day of the festivals (parvadinam). and on the day of the offering of ku.<a grass (JWl'itrakam). etc."},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"TANTRASARA 187 They should also be considered daily observances, for they are reg-ulated by the time of their occurrences. This is the view of some. However, there are occasional (naimittika) observances that are not regular in regard to the followers of the lineage of the teacher, as, for example, the time of the arrival of the spiritual teacher and his relatives, the day of a festival related to him (tatparvadinam), the day on which he received knowledge, etc. This is also the view of some. In these instances regular worship, the prayers at the junctures of the day, worship of the spiritual teacher, worship during the day of a festival, and worship of the pavitrakam also need to be performed without fail. The occasional observances (naimittikas) are the days on which the disciple obtained knowledge, the day when he received the holy text (sastra), the arrival of the teacher and his relatives in his house, his birthday, the day of his initiation and the day of his departure from this world, secular festivals, the exposition of the scripture (i.e., the commencement of it, the intermediate [phase], and the completion of it), the day on which he perceived the desired deity, the day of union with the spiritual partner (melaka), a command received in a dream, and release from the observance of convention (samaya). All these are the conditions for perform-ing special kinds of worship as occasional rites. Then the disciple who has been initiated previously should be given the principal mantra, which possesses a potency of its own, which is in essence the pulsating consciousness of the mouth but without being written down. 229 Then the said disciple, for the pur-pose of being identified with God, should practice to attain one-ness with God during the junctures of the day. Then, by means of that, for the attainment of such a sort of impression, one should worship the great Lord every day on the altar or in the liliga · Regarding it, in a heautiful altar, one should contemplate one's own form as reflected in a mirror and it should be considered that one's own Self has become identical with the host of deities to be Worshipped there. He should perceive it to be the reflected image"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"188 TANTRASARA of the deity himself. Realizing thus, he should worship it with an offering of beautiful flowers, sandal paste, wine, propitiatory offerings of water, burning incense, lighting a lamp, presenting various materials, praising with songs, a recital of musical inst:u-ments, and then should recite hymns in order to obtain undeviat-ing identity with the desired deity.

This is the view of our teachers. The power of sight, composed of the highest nectar arising sportingly, basing itself on the light, extending as the supreme truth of entities, the knowers of the secret worship you with it.

The main food offering should be eaten by oneself or should be thrown into the water. The creatures born in water had formerly been given initiation by means of eat-ing caru (sacred boiled rice). If the caru is eaten by a cat, a mouse, or a dog, then, doubt having arisen, it becomes the cause of hell. The knower of the truth, with a desire of showing grace to the world, should not behave contrary to the social order or remain secluded from it. Thus, here ends the worship of the altar. Next is the instruction regarding the lhiga.230 The liliga should not be installed with the application of sacred mantras. This is particularly true for the vyakta form of liliga. One should wor-ship li1igas [that are] firmly established, following the order of invocation and withdrawal, because this is the basis of all worship. In th is regard, one should worship the body of the teacher. one's own body, the body of the sakti, the text in which sacred mantras exist, the vessel used by the heroes (vfrapatra), a rosary, a weapon (prahara~1a), a litiga collected from Narmada river (btil:zaliliga), a liliga made of pearl, made of gold, made of flowers, made of charming materials like sandal paste, etc., or a mirror as the lhiga. It is by the force of the substratum (maladlzara) that the excel-lence of the attainment of perfection in mantras occurs.

Therefore, they are similar. Mutual opposi-tion with a difference of subject matter is of no account. Killing a brahma!Ja and the prohibition of it are like the difference between purity and excel Jenee of the soul.

If the eternality of tigama be sup-posed, even then the logical arguments, i.e., anvaya and vyatireka, perception, etc., as well as their validity, are grounded in tradi-tion (prasiddhi). 241 A notion such as \"I see real silver\" depends on somebody else's knowledge, as in this case on a goldsmith's knowledge. Therefore, the tradition (prasiddlzi) is agama. To some, it gives a perceptible result, as, for example, one who is hungry eats. A child becomes engaged with each individual object only because of being impelled by prasiddlzi, and not by the logical connec-tion of cause and effect, and its negation. At that age, there is an absence of logic. etc. Furthermore, at that age, its presence is of little use. Inference of the logical connection of cause and effect, and its negation. taking recourse to prasiddhi, are required for the accomplishment of some action. Some prasiddlzis are the givers of unseen results, such as emancipation after death, dissolution in prakrti, and emancipation of the soul. Other prasiddhis bestow similarity with Siva, while others terminate in the oneness [with Siva]. These seen and unseen results are again manifold. There-fore, in this world full of different traditions (prasiddlzis), what: ever state a person wi 11 have in the future. he selects that kind of prasiddhi and is forced to accept it as something highly desirable (or undesirable). For this reason, what would be the purpose of verbal argument in regard to a person who is quite empty?

This is meant for those who have attained the proper confidence and in whom the engrained desire for Kula yaga is going to develop. Therefore, in texts such as the Yogasalizclira, etc., it has been stated: Bliss is Brahman which abides in the body. That bliss is established in a threefold way in the last syllable under pa-varga that is the labials. The person who is not a brahmacarin and abstains from the procedure of fol-lowing the three ma-karas (that is the ritual involving the three forbidden elements) is bereft of bliss. Bliss being bereft of wine, etc., and those who. forsaking it. engage themselves in worshipping in the cakra in both ways are cooked in a dreadful hell. Therefore, one should follow the prescribed procedure. The Kula form of ritual is to be performed in the following way. The ritual is sixfold: external, in the fakti, in one's own body. in the union of the two. in the vital air, and in consciousness."},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"206 TANTRASARA Among the six, each latter is more excellent than the former, but the performance of each former one is based on one's sweet will. One who is desirous of attaining enjoyment should select the second, fourth, and fifth; but the sixth is the principal ritual for the one who is desirous of liberation. Even this kind of person should perform the rituals beginning from the second. as far as is possible, during the occasional observances. for in that way the precept is fulfilled. Now, in regard to performance of the external ritual, there is the altar; the vessel full of wine, called the vessel of the vfra; the red cloth; and the Siva liliga, which was described earlier. In this ritual, without taking recourse to [the rituall bath, etc., one attains purity by simply taking repose in the perfect blissful state. Then, while meditating on the oneness of the vital energy, con-sciousness, and the body, and [with the awareness that this] con-sciousness is identical with great Lord, one should repeat the man-tra twenty-seven times. Then, one should place the mantra (nyasa) on the top of the head, the face, the heart, the secret part, and the murtis, first in the natural order, and then in reverse. In this way the fullness of identity with the great Lord in his apard. parapartL, and para forms is attained. The number of principles (tattvas) from mayo, puru~rn, gu~za. buddhi, to earth principle is twenty-seven. The principles kaltL' e~c., are included in it. The vidyafoktis possess the nature of the h1gher-~um-lower aspects. The five Brahmas (Brahma, Vigiu. Rudra, Isvara, and Sadasiva), Sadyajata, Bhavodbhavatva, and the others have twenty-seven aspects. This has been explained by the venerable, glorious Lakulefa as well as others. The great Lord (Paramesvara) possesses five .<aktis, even in its highest aspect, and each of these .<aktis possesses five aspects. Thus, the number of foktis is twenty-five. When these saktis are not shining distinctly as differentiated from each other. they are then said to be one; that is, a non-differentiated point (anud-bhinnaviblulgti).

It should be thought of as being bound so securely with great Lord that nothing extraneous can approach it. Then, all the articles for the ritual, the place of worship, and the guardian deities of the quarters, which are in front of him, should all be conceived as being of his essence because they have been permeated by the whole group of instruments of knowledge dominated by that sort of intellect [related to the supreme Lord]. Then, the vessel for the offering should be filled with the per-vasive thought of tying of the sacred hair on the head and should be worshipped. The altars also are to be worshipped by a few drops of the I iqu id uniting the tip of the thumb and the fourth fin-ger. One should worship the host of mantras located in the cakras of the body, and should offer oblations to them. The worshipper should perform this ritual in the vital energy. Then, on the altar one should draw a seat with the character of the trident ending in three saktis representing Para, Parapara. and A.para. All the principles from earth to the end of maya are included in the syllable \"sa, '' and the syllable \"au .. is to be c~n­ceived as the seat of three saktis. In the syllable '·sa, ··all the pnn-ciples ending in mtiyti, and in \"au,\" the threefold saktis ar.e ~o be worshipped and [over there] the sakti with the charactenstic of reflective consciousness (vimarsarzlpa sakti) should be wor~ shipped. Thus, uttering the mantra (saub) once, the placement of it as the base (adlza ra) and the one to be placed over it. (a~lzeya) should be done. Then, in the consciousness, which is mdeed cldheya, one should conceive this universe in it, which is also com-posed of consciousness. Thus, this universe is enclosed by means of consciousness, and by this universe consciousness comes into being, because th is universe has appeared from consciousness and terminates in it. From the knowable objects, consciousness arises and gets its rest therein. The reality of the nature of conscious-ness is arrived at only by means of mutual activity of enclosure (coitus). Therefore. it has been stated \"enclosing all the syllables.\""},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"208 TANTRASARA Then, one should offer sandal paste, incense. wine, flowers, and so on, as long as one does not become completely absorbed in the supreme.

Then, it is worshipped by means of the pervasive thought of sikhabandha; that is, the tying of the tuft of the hair on the head. Visarga sakti is to be conceived in the seat ending with three saktis, in three corners, and in the center. This is the specific feature of the concept of pervasion. The same procedure is to be done on the specific limb of one's body, in that very cakra; then it is done in the brahmarandhra and in other minor centers. 3-TV ~ ~a101il<ie=t ~il G:«i <\"1~ s;nl ~ oa: I Ji I 0Q I G.l~J I fl~· I Ci Ml d1<\"1 '<: qrrM\"Jf IB Ci I Ci 1 c-R:i A_ I I ~tiffi~~WI"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"TANTRASARA 209 ~-lcildcil fl:rws~ CiGQf\"i~IRid5C\"QCi: 11 d¢t>Atlfld.1ftk~ldi\"cici') \"Ci\"W ~ I ~ Y)Mllru\"\"\"f l.-:(4~ ~'lj)~l*1ct1fuf~ 11 l! d A I :r:F•G: fFG.l f% Ci fl ii) ~l 1:8C1 f ~ I 3'l ~d ¢t> l I o I &:l ¢t> Ci I a k·~ I a fii C'il l:l ci I I RJ1RJ1mmm-n -~ruas1*1i:tl:lfct~44Ri:t~1 1 ¢t>A~nsiawa~= firu=c:a~h m-l1an:T ~ 11 3\"1~awaaa k·J:ias-i:t .. n ruJ 101~{011ftn 1aa14+-t 1 Ci m Rb Ci g:a I c-J:i d)-A :r;q I :r;q *1 '14~ I I ~8~1fiftFdCilJ1fiaTI~ I a_x ~ I C\"\"'l'4 4)\"ci ¢t5 I o <:i fQ c=rrA c=raT CiT+il:llR ~ l!~ 11 ~ <:llAM~CiC\\ llff1aR-ia1fias2i ~ClcIT 1 ¢t>ACil'<Ci~l/1J11c=t ~ f%\" fifdfutnfti\"Ug: 11 ~UIAlifl'< -~~l:llc-Ad5J1Jl<1Cil'<Al+\"Ci'i I -:r:TI\" ~ \"i I L<j)fuc=i ~ 11 \"\"dl fua 'tj\\fa d5 I'< o i ~ ~ I I 3'lT1ctfao9:::tqa~-\"fCii fifdcti:tlc-Afilci~)Jl:lf(\\ I ~ 11 :r:a'i fu Ci I c-A d5 9'l:l -l1~ <il I 4 <1c{ fa -~ 1.+-'Rts ........ ~..,..,...I Rti~i:t......-a~~ : I I fq I c-A I :r:<:il :r:(:l Id~ 11 Ci, ~ 11 :r:a I~ c=d 9'l:ll dl:l I c-A C\"Q I a, I ~1f=nH=Cj) ag:~fuai ~ y:w11Fa ;TI~ 11 ~ \"\"ciT4 ~~ <1m ~ Ultt>li~llti'Ugl(\\ I 31~ ~ ma1 ~ sft+F( ~ 11 :r:a'l fua u@:;r ~S~ucl I I ~ l\"CLl i f\"d*ilffifl I-A\"ictfmfuci ~ ~ I 3fuc=f -a-mw ~ ~'!0-cl:l 1 g:~h ~ lJ ~a -a-~ 1 1 (!~~en~ fuf~$11Tilqqlfc; i:rcrfu I ~i<::rffi ~ ~fu ~ -aaa ldctiJ:\\ 1 1 ~ R'<1+=G:J4~"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"210 TANTRASARA The Procedure Regarding the Pair (Yamala) The characteristic feature of the sakti is [in its being] that by which perfect steadiness of nonduality is attained. Therefore, without considering age, caste, worldly and otherworldly spiritual relations, one attains supreme identity of nondual ity born of both [male and female] (1). The iaktis are of three types: the created, the caused, and the born of the union of both. They are conceived otherwise by subsidiary divisions. They are mutually worshipped and propitiated because bliss is adjacent there (2). The [principal] cakra should be properly worshipped. Other m.in~r cakras should be worshipped after that. The external worship is ~o be performed by the offering of flowers, sandal paste. etc., and m.wardly they are to be propitiated by means of offering food, wme, etc. (3). Thus, the upsurge of the mass of bliss becomes manifest by means of various activities and, as a result. all the minor cakras, being dissolved in the principal cakra, become identified with it (4). All of the minor cakras attain the fullness of enjoyment by means of enjoying their respective spheres [of enjoyment]. and as a result they relish their own nature. Thus, all the deities of minor ca~ras become centrally inclined to the principal cakra of con-sc10usness (5). When the fullness of the rays, characterized by the host of the deities of the minor cakras, bring about vigor to hoth the sakti and the possessor of sakti, they both become exceedingly inclined toward each other (6 ). fAt the time of unionl of the pair, while they enter the highest abode of bliss, the agitation born of its vibration agitates the minor cakras as well, and they should be conceived as identical with it because they are not distinct from it (7 )."},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"TANTRASARA 211 Thus when, by means of the comparative development of balance, this pair loses all distinctions, which is difficult to express in words, then that consciousness is known as the compact unity of the emission of both (8). That steady abode of anuttara, the beyond, is characteristic of both; that is, transcendent and immanent, which is otherwise designated as the lofty, all-inclusive universal bliss. This is neither the state of tranquility, or ever-restfulness, nor the state of rising, but is called the highest Kaula, the cause of the rest and the act of rising. The one who is desirous of the attainment of the non-limited nature of the Self should make himself identical with conscious-ness. It is true that both, with the characteristics of resting and rising regarding the sakti and the possessor of sakti, rise simulta-neously (9 -10). On account of the mutual absorption of both, the very nature of the Self, both are of the characteristics of resting and rising, because both have the characteristics of both. However, it is the sakti who bears the rising of creation in her womb, but not the one who is the possessor of the sakti (11). In this sakti, the Kula, which is embodied in the teacher. should be transmitted into the sakti, and through her, because of the close union which emanates by the mutual contact of both [should be collected] and distributed among the people (Ila). Therefore, in this twofold creation of rest and rising, those who concentrate on the former, the state of visarga and that it ~s the cause of both (that is, those who reflect that everything is the expansion of visa rga), they become steadily rested in the perfect state free from all limitations (llb-12a). That which rises from the mutual union of both should be col-lected externally from the principal mouth. Worship with it will satisfy the host of deities. and it will be the bestower of attain-ments and liberation (12b-13a)."},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"212 TANTRASARA By t~e practice of visarga with the nature of rest, the restful [st~te of] Sivahood is attained, and also the host of deities shines wi~h the same nature. At that very state, the rising of the absolute void occurs, which is devoid of bliss (niranandamaya). It is free from modality, not only of the abode, but also of others ( l 3b-14a). By the delightful tasting of the external object, by which one's ?wn blissful nature is filled, and not only by this. but also by the m~er organs which are taking delight from tasting the delight!ul obJ~ct, the nature of one's own and, by this process [of th~ tasung delight and experience of fullness one's own self], the perfect state of the inner search of this experience adds to the delightful nature of the minor cakras and, from there, to the main ones (15b-16a). This threefold visarga conforms to its meaning. It is full in ever~ respect, from where everything is created, from where this ma~i­fold remains present, and where creation is dissolved. In this de~cription of visarga above, which is threefold, mantravrrya bemg continuously reflected upon in its threefold form, the t~ue ?otency of mantra is then attained. Thus, in mantravlrya, which 15. the inner core of consciousness, the mantra [abiding there] gives birth to various results (16b-17). In.t?e middle of the triangle, there exists an ever-blooming lot~s vellmg the ma~z{lala. In its center is a stalk having a lotus with six-teen P.et~ls, with a root inseparably attached to it. In the course of the fnct10n of the two lotuses having a stalk attached to each .. the host of kalas lying within the moon, perfectly ful 1 and charnung. and those lying within the sun, and by the association with blood and semen related to the three-petal led lotus, the creation of the sprout representing fire occurs (18-20a). Thus, taking recourse to the mudrcl representing the moon, the sun, and fire (known as swi1gaffa mudra), one who has inter-nalized the sequence of creation, etc .. in his heart, regarding the sequence of creation, etc., quickly attains the fourth state (anakhya) (20b-2la)."},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"TANTRASARA 213 In consequence of the absorption in the klzecarl mudrti of both the sakti and the possessor of sakti, or, in other words, when perfect equilibrium of both occurs, whatever experience comes about in the enjoyment of drink, sport, and fun merges in vimarsa follow-ing the course of unmanifest (avyakta), dlzvani, rava, sphofa, fruti, ntida, nadanta; remains as antilzata without any break; and finally becomes the virile energy of the mantra (mantravlrya) (21b-23a). [The cakras are eight:] the outgoing and ingoing of the vital air at the ti me of their cessation; in the ear while hearing a sound; in the eye while perceiving an object; the coming in contact of both the sexual organs; during their union; at the end of twelve; and in the ytimala (23b-24a). From the middle of the breast to the end of the lips the unmanifest sound exists, abiding in the throat; one who listens to it inside both the cakras at the time of the cessation of agitation where all have their rest, that is, nadablzairava, the Absolute having eight-fold forms, that is, ardlzacandra, nada, sakti representingjyoti, dhvani, samaraftlzis is stated to be the absolute extension of the mantra (24b-26). Thus, calling up the above extension in the mind in every act, and in whatever it may be, one remains nonattached while living and becomes absolute Bhairava (27).

This is to be meditated upon in such a way as fluid that has gone to rest in the fluid (28). Remaining steady in firm conviction without allowing any doubt to rise, one should continue contemplating, \"I am not,'' and should get oneself free from the bondage of llclira, witnessing the host of divinities in the body, merging pleasure and worries in the mass of consciousness, and all the time viewing the recipient of them which abides in the centers of the ears, eyes, mouth, and nose and other centers.

This is the ritual regarding the vital air. The ritual in the form of sarhvid has been discussed earlier in regard to one who has attained steadiness in it. After performing one of the rituals among them, if the disciple becomes free from doubts and attains purity of the heart, then showing him the ritual without taking recourse to offering sesame and clarified butter into the fire, and so on, he should be given initiation only by mere glance while keeping in his heart the aforesaid permeating extension (vyapti).

That knowledge called pauru~a is free from thought constructs (vikalpa) and is of the nature of pure I-Consciousness. It shines in its fullness when complete identification with Siva occurs. That ignorance, which is also called pau ru~a, is composed of vikalpas, which are contrary to the perfect I ight of consciousness on account of their being lim-ited. This imperfect knowledge (apar~zaj11tina) is the root cause of worldly existence. When that ignorance called pauru~a disappears as a result of initiation, the impurity born of past deeds. which are the cause of the body. still persists. For this reason, the knowledge of the Self (puru~a) fails to shine forth. Defilement (mala) called karmamala is of the nature of prarabdha, the impressions of ~ast deeds that w i 11 be experienced in this body. On the complete extmc-tion of pra rabdha, the body falls off, after which the pauru~a t~pe of knowledge becomes manifest. The order is as follows: initiauon. destruction of the pauru$a form of ignorance. competency to ~tudy agama texts, emergence of the bauddlza form of knowledge, hbera-tion while living, destruction of prtirabdlza, the fall of the body. and the emergence of the pauru$a kind of knowledge and the attainment of one's own nature. 2 · Although apparently distinct from consciousness. thought ~on­structs (vikalpas) are not different from it. When. through nght reasoning (sattarka) the purification of vikalpas takes place, then one arrives at the state where vikalpas merge back into their source. which is indeterminate (avikalpa) by nature. This process of purifi-cation of vikalpas is described in Chapter Four. 215"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"216 NOTES 3. The descent of sacred texts (sastra) occurs through five currents, known as consciousness, bliss, will, knowledge, and action, repre-senting five faces of Siva. These are the five .foktis of the Lord and are connected with the faces of Ifana, Tatpuru$a, Sadyojata, Vamadeva, and Aghora, respectively. Among the holy texts (agamas), some are predominantly dualistic, some are dual-cum-nondual, and some are perfectly nondual. The number of dualistic aganzas is ten, while those which preach the doctrine of duality-cum-nonduality are eighteen in number, and those whose view is perfectly nondual are sixty-four in number. 4. The compound word svabhtiva~1 (svasya bluzvaM denotes the funda-mental reality of one's own nature which is identical with con-sciousness. 5. The undivided, eternal, and ever-present I ight (prakasa) is also re?resented by the technical term spanda or 'vibration,' a con-~c1ous throb that goes on vibrating, and illuminates everything else m this universe. 6· The word nirakara means 'without any form'~ however, in this con-text nirakara should be understood to mean 'that light is not of any specific form because it is of all forms.' 7. This is the reference to the descending and ascending arcs of con-sciousness. The descending arc is the ~nfoldment of consciousness which brings the universe, and all limited beings, into existence. !he ascending arc refers to the yogic process which brings a lim-~ted consciousness to its fullness; that is, a limited knowing subject is elevated to its original source. 8. The 'means' (updya) are a door which allows the practitioner to enter the inner sanctum of Siva. This entrance or absorption is technically called civefo. A bound being is limited and therefore devoid of freedom, thus a human being is i ncapahle of conceiving its own real nature. When this limitation disappears by the ·means' (updya), the state of identity with the Absolute that occurs is known ~s absorption (samtivefo). Th is absorption is fourfold: horn of Sambhu or Siva (!iambhava), born of Sakti (sdkta), and born of a~lll M~zava).

Some of the means help to obtain that end (upeya) directly. while others lead to increasingly subtle states of being unti I the aspirant is able to intuitively realize that the supreme is not merely attained by entering some mental state th rough upd_va. Al 1 the means serve some purpose: a~zava merges into fakta, and sakta merges into sambhava. Upon attaining the sambhava upiiya, one merges into the non-sequential 'intuitive knowledge· (pratibha) characterized by that self-effulgent light (prakasa). These means are relatively distinct because of grada-tions in the intensity of the 'descent of grace' (saktipata); that is, the intensity of contact with the grace of the Lord. The degree of grace one receives varies with the preparedness of the person. When the grace is supremely intense, the person does not take recourse to any sort of spiritual practice or meditation. He sees and realizes that the entire universe continuously emerges and dissolves within the core of his heart. 10. The whole text of the Tantrtiloka and its short version, the Tan-trasa ra, are elaborations on the subject of these four means. ~he exposition in the both texts begins with Chapter Two. in which Abhi navagupta describes the nature of anupaya. Chapter Two 11. The term anupliya refers to the attainment of identity with Siva without the application of any means. Chapter Three 12. The perfect Absolute is in reality partless and full~ it should be meditated upon as orbicular and without any parts. This reality shines to the _vogin who has attained 'absorption without taking recourse to any means' (anuplzya). as a mass of the fire of con-sciousness into which all beings enter to be consumed. The yogin experiences freedom from pleasure, pain. doubts. and determinate knowledge (vikalpa). and is finally absorbed in the highest 'indeter-minate state' (nirvikalpa)."},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"218 NOTES 13. The 'autonomous energy' of the Lord is known as icclzasakti, which is inseparable from the Lord. The essence of the Lord is light (prakafa), which by its free will manifests the multitude of cre-ations and dissolutions. The entire picture of the universe shines on the screen of one's own consciousness. inseparable from the Self. 14. The absolute light is known as the void of consciousness and likened to a mirror. By means of its freedom (svMantrya) the entire uni-verse manifests as a reflection in a mirror. The reflected objects are apprehended according to the cleanliness or purity of the mirr0:· All objects of the universe shine in it, along with all of their indi-vidual distinctions. The different sense organs and mind are also described as mirrors and their reflections possess specific charac-teristics which are perceived according to the comparative purity of their surface. For example, a mirror, clear water, or the retina of the eye can reflect a form or color, while the sexual organ is capa-ble of reflecting only touch, and so on. However, the light of con-sciousness is capable of displaying all sorts of reflections. 15· The principles of original taste, touch, etc., shine in the Lord and are inseparable from him. However, on the empirical level they become manifest as reflections. Even then, they remain in contact with the original (bimba). Otherwise, the chain reactions as referred to in the text would not he possible. 16· That power called cit§akti is of the nature of singular, self-con-scious light (praka§a).

In contrast, the knowing subject, although remaining limited, is aware that he or she exists, and is capahle of consciously reflecting on this self-aware existence. 17. This universe is perceived as possessing two aspects: first. its relation with speech, specifically the sounds that denote meaning; and sec-ond, the entity denoted by speech or sound. The former is known as partimar.fo and the latter paramanfonlva, literally 'that is denoted hy sound.' In addition, there is a sup1:eme form of speech that is inseparably associated with Lord called paranada or para viik."},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"NOTES 219 18. The Lord is associated with three principal energies (sakti) called anuttara, iccha, and unme$a, represented by the three phonemes \"a,\" '\"i,\" and \"u,\" respectively. Each phoneme has two aspects: a short and a long measure. The corresponding long forms are known as ananda, rsana, and iirmi. This tradition states that the short vowels are predominantly of the nature of light (prakasa), there-fore, they have the characteristic of the sun; the corresponding long vowels, having the nature of repose, are considered to be of the nature of the moon. 19. The syllable '\"'\"a\" has another \"a\" as its corresponding phoneme. The one represents Siva and the other Sakti. The vibrative union of both gives rise to bliss (ananda). representing the phoneme \"a.\" It is from the energy of ananda sakti that the universe comes into being, which in short are all the remaining phonemes beginning with iccha and ending in \"k$a.\" This union of \"a\" and \"a\" is character-ized by consciousness alone. while pratyavamarsa~za, the cognitive desire to create sisrk$afllul, is known as the energy of will. This desire representing will (iccha) is the desire to get back to bliss that has been as if lost. 20. Icchti, rsana, zmme$a, and iirmi represent the energy of will and the energy of knowledge. respectively. The energy of action does not_ exist in any form either manifest or unmanifest up to this level of unfoldment. When activity shows itself. only then four neuter pho-nemes, which are \"r, ·· \"rr. ·· \"/,\"and\".(, .. appear. They are similar in nature to that of .. r\" and .. !\" belonging to the group of consonants. 21. Four phonemes, namely \"e,\" \"ai,\" \"o,\" and \"'au,\" represent the energy of action. When the movement of the supreme vibration becomes completely externalized, then it is known as ··au, .. in which the flow of the unfoldment stops. Then all the divisions of the energy merge in the one which shows itself as the bindu or drop. 22. Bindu is the compact mass of consciousness assembled into an undif-ferentiated point from which the creation of the universe proceeds. 23. On its way of unfolding the universe, the ak11lafakti belonging to Siva first manifests bi11d11 represented by one dot. Further. out of hindu, the kaulikl visarga sakti emerges in the form of two dots,"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"220 NOTES one above the other. It is from this sakti that the creation of the entire universe takes place. 24. Emission (visarga) is threefold, i.e., a~rnva, Stikta, and Hzmbhava. They are characterized by difference, difference-cum-nondifference, and nondifference. The picture in the form of a~zavavisarga shines to the view of the limited subject as \"this.\" In this view, on the one end lies the limited subject and on the other lies the universe. These two get merged into the unity of limited knowledge and its object, which is nothing but the unity of knowingness (citi) and the object of knowledge (cetya). This is known as visarga, where repose occurs in the heart. In the second visarga, known as cittasam-bodha, the entire universe-while shining as one with conscious-ness with all the distinctions of subjects and their objects-yet also shines, transcending them al I. The third visa rga is known as the dissolution of citta (cittapralava) when al I the distinctions of know-ing subjects and objects are obliterated, and therefore shines as one with the subject of supreme consciousness. 25. The energy of emission (visarga) manifesting itself as individual cog-nitions appears as the universe. She, that is, Sakti, is the cause, or the mother, of all sorts of gross words and sentences. In agamas it has two appellations; the one is called mdtrkti and the other malinf. The former is the seed (blja) and the latter. is the recipient (yoni) of the seed. The one, when agitated, gives birth to diverse phonemes. All these phonemes. being the indicative sound. represent all thirty-six principles (tattva), beginning with Siva and ending with the earth. 26. In reality the number of cognitions is six. They are anuttara, icclza. unme~a, ananda, lsana, and firmi. However, because of expansion and reverse movement the number becomes twelve. When anuttara proceeds to expand it becomes \"a.'' Similarly, \"i\" becomes\"/'' and \"u\" becomes \"ii.\" This movement is called prasara~w. At the same time, mutual relation of \"a'' with \"i,\" \"a\" with \"u, ., \"i\" with \"a, .. \"u'' with \"a,'' \"a\" with bin du, and \"a\" with visarga occurs. It is then known as pratisamcara~za. Thus the phonemes which come into being following the above methods are of mixed character. They make the fullness of the Lord."},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"NOTES 221 27. The number of Kalikas is twelve. They are called Kalikas because they cause change through the process of mutation denoted by the word kalana. Cognition is nothing but the energy of the Lord on the pure level of consciousness. However, with emergence of mayti, differentiation sets in, with the result that reflective cognition (parii mar.Sa) descends down to the worldly level and assumes the character of syllables on the one hand and the principles (tattva) on the other. 28. There are four levels of speech. They are para, pasyantf, madlzy-ama, and vaikharl. For detailed account on the subject of four lev-els of speech see Abhinavagupta's Partitrisikti Vivara~w. See also Padoux's Vac: The Concept of the Word in Selected Hindu Tantras. 29. Even on the level mayti these phonemes can possibly be enlivened by contact with pure knowledge (suddlzavidyti) through which they can be utilized to serve the purpose of both enjoyment and liberation. 30. Pure absorption into Siva (samblzava samavesa) signifies pure con-sciousness. When a yogin attains it, he realizes that all the six patl~s (~a<;ladhvas) are not different from his own Self. They reflect in his own consciousness, rise in his very Self, and gain their rest in it. In the integrated unitary consciousness, creation, maintenance, and dissolution shine inseparably from one's own nature. 31. If one is capable of merging his consciousness into the pure light of absolute consciousness through stimblzava upaya, then assidu~us tasks, such as bathing, religious observances (vrata). purificat10n of the body, meditation, recitation of sacred syllables (mantras), sacrifice, or oblation into the fire are not required. Chapter Four 32. The thought constructs (vikalpa) are of two types, pure and impure. The pure vikalpa, though being a vikalpa, is an aid in achieving the highest aim of human life, liberation (mok$a). On the other hand, the impure vikalpa entices beings with worldly existence. It is because of its existence that the Self conceives itself as limited in knowledge and action."},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"222 NOTES 33. The imposition on the innate nature (svabhava) of different kind of pure properties is known as purification (smizskara). The very nature of consciousness is its freedom from thought constructs (vikalpa). This indeterminate nature of consciousness (nirvikalpa) is also the very nature of the Self. This is known as innate nature (svabhava). Listening to this nature of the Self repeatedly, thinking of it, and meditating on it continuously help the thought construct to become purified. In the beginning, the layers of pure thought (§uddha-vikalpa) remain as if indistinct. However, in the long run, through practice, the layers of pure thought become perfectly dis-tinct. It is important to emphasize here that the perfect purity of one's own innate nature (svabhava) is revealed by pure thought constructs (fuddha-vikalpa) when the latent impressions of duality are removed. At this stage the vikalpas do not stand as the cause of the duality. With the purification of vikalpas, in the right manner, consciousness shines forth with all its glory. 34. The erroneous conception latent in the soul, \"I am in bondage,\" is the root cause of worldly existence. 35. That deep-rooted impression of the soul, ··I am in bondage,\" is uprooted by the conviction contrary to it, i.e., the pure thought con-struct (iuddha-vikalpa). 36. The right form of reasoning (sattarka) does not arise in the soul on account of descent of grace in a lesser degree of intensity. The right ~orm of reasoning begins to show as a result of study of agamas and instruction by a teacher. 37. The study of agama gives rise to the series of thought constructs free from doubt, which in turn give rise to the series of pure thought constructs (iuddha-vikalpa). This is the characteristic of the right form of reasoning. This right reasoning is called bhavand. the layers of pure thought. It is like the wish-fulfilling cow which grants all desires. According to this system. intuitive reasoning (sattarka) is considered to be the most supreme limb of yoga. By the right application of it, one becomes the true knower of the nature of reality. It is by th is means alone that one is able to discern right from wrong."},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"NOTES 223 38. The five under the group of self-restraint (yama) are: nonviolence, truthfulness. not stealing, restraining one's sexual urge, and nonac-ceptance of gifts. They are not considered to be the direct aid in attainment of consciousness. This is because the real nature of con-sciousness which is Siva is not touched by any of these means. 39. Withdrawal of senses from the external objects and placing them in one's heart is known as pratyalulra. However, for the consciousness which is al I-pervasive, withdrawal is not possible. In the same way, concentration, meditation, and absorption (samadlzi) are related to something which is limited. Therefore, they do not serve any pur-pose in attainment of the vision of that which is by nature unlimited. 40. Practice is an activity which is performed consciously either in the vital energy, in the intellect, or in the body, etc. Lifting heavy loads, studying a text and continuous effort to understand its mean-ing, occupying oneself with dancing and music add confidence and later proficiency to the respective spheres. However. consciousness. having the nature of light, is ever shining and changeless. There-fore, practice does not add or take away anything from it. 41. The universe is the sportive play of three energies (saktis). The ~i.rst is the supreme energy in which all the principles (tattvas) from_ Siva to the earth shine as pure consciousness, free from all deternu~nat~ knowledge (nirvikalpa). The second, known as Sriparapara saktl, by which everything shines as different-cum-nondifferent li~e t~e reflection of the elephant in the mirror. Though the reflec~10~1 is one with the mirror, yet, as in the case of the elephant. it is ~t~trnct from the mirror itself. The third power. named Aparafakt1, is the_ one by which everything under the domain of the delusive po~er t~f mtiyti shines with difference. There is yet another energy (sakti) which abides in everything, permeating and threading through all, which is known as Matrsadbhava, Kalakar~i1)I, and other similar names. Each of the above-mentioned saktis. following the order of creation, maintenance. and dissolution, possesses three aspects. Therefore the number becomes twelve. 42. Knowingness (pramiti) which abides in all the knowers is the active principle. It is known as existing awareness (mMrsiidblzava)."},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"224 NOTES 43. By the power of Kalakar~il)I, complete shrinkage of time occurs. As a result, the sequence of time completely disappears, which reveals consciousness in its totality. 44. When supreme consciousness, which is the knowing subject. con-sumes all differences, it is known as fire. In reality, heing of the nature of I-Consciousness. it assumes by its power of autonomy the forms of intellect, the mind, and ten senses. Thus the number becomes twelve. The knowing subject (pramMli), who is of the nature of fire, assuming the nature of an instrument of knowledge, becomes known as the sun. At that state it is known as ego (ahmizkara). The state which is known to be the instrument of knowledge is in reality the eternal aspect of the knowing subject. Now the question regarding the creation of the knowahles arises. The instrument of knowledge cannot be designated as such without the existence of any knowable object. Therefore, the instrument of knowledge itself assumes the nature of the objective universe. From the level of the knowing subject (pramclta), down to the level of the object, they assume four aspects each. These four aspects are cre-ation, maintenance, dissolution, and the nameless (anciklzycl). The total number of the aspects is twelve. As these aspects are manifes-tation of consciousness, the yogin, while wandering along in the void of consciousness, can easily attain steadiness in any of these states and attain absorption by unifying these four states. 45. The term kalana has different meanings. Kall is the conscious agent who performs kalana, therefore she is known as Kall. The number ofKalis is twelve. They are as follows: (l) sr~tikalI, (2) Sthiti Kall, (3) SamharakalL (4) RaktakalI, (5) Svakall (sukalI), ( 6) Ya ma Kall. (7) MrtyukalI, (8) RudrakalI (BhadrakaiI), (9) Paramarkakali, (10) Martal)<)akalI, (11) KalagnirudrakalI, and (12) MahakalI (ParakalI. MahakalakalI, KalakalI). This kalana also occurs in relation to the knowable, the instrument of knowledge, and the knowing subject. As each state is of the characteristic of creation, maintenance, dis-solution, and the nameless one (anakhyll), the number of the divine energies also becomes twelve. 46. Here the word Mahesvara does not refer to the highest Lord of this system hut to one of the triad, Brahma, Vi?I)U, and Mahdvara."},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"NOTES 225 47. For example. while performing ytiga one can one day offer flowers to the Lord. Then. next day. the one may offer sandal paste, food, etc., until finally one is able to offer oneself. 48. Srrparva is another name for the Malinlvijayottara Tantra. Chapter Five 49. The term \"'bound soul\" (pasu), which literally means animal, is a technical term of this system. With the appearance of limitation, the soul, which is essentially composed of pure consciousness, finds itself limited in knowledge and action. Its innate nature becomes as if veiled, for which reason it becomes known as atomic (a~lU). At this level of existence the bonded souls are of great vari-ety because they receive the grace of the Lord, which is based on comparative distinctions of intensity. The right form of intuitive judgment does not arise in all. Therefore, they have to depend on (igama for the rise of that intuitive knowledge. At this stage. there is a need for a spiritual guide. A spiritual guide is a person meant to lead the seeker in selecting an appropriate agama for him to study. When the agama is studied properly, pure thought (suddlza-vikalpa) arises. However. in the case of those who lack right under-standing. purification of thoughts (vikalpas) in this particular way is not possible. Therefore, they need to rely on other means for tha~ purification of thoughts (vikalpas). In short, these means are.: medi-tation, taking recourse to the vital energy (pra~za). and makmg the body the instrument of knowledge as a means to attain one's e~ds. The body itself is a gross instrument for the attainment of the hig!1-est aim of 1 i fe. For those who are steadily convinced that a body 15 the Self. it becomes a suitable means. 50. Meditation is performed by the intellect (buddlzi). This kind of practice is fruitful for those who think that intellect is the Self. On the other hand. those who are convinced that the vital air (pra~za) is the Self make the pr([~za a means. In order to remove vikalpas, the as pi rant makes use of body (kara~za). mudra. and different sorts of (isanas. 51. Vital energy is of two types, one general and the other particular. The particular form of the vital air manifests itself in five different"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"226 NOTES ways. They are known as pra~za. apana, samana, ud(/na, and vyana. These particular forms of vital energy. although manifested distinctly in these five ways and functioning in different parts ~f the body, are basically resting in the general form of vital air. Their basic nature is to 'move forward' (ucc(zra~za). The general prti~za is known as vibration (spanda), pulsation, blossoming, etc. At the start of the creative impulse, after manifestation of void. the con-sciousness assumes the nature of vital energy. 52. Kara~w is a particular type of a ~rnva upa)~a which relates to the meditation on the body, etc. 53. The supreme consciousness is self-luminous by nature. It is only because of its autonomy that it takes on the nature of everything. In other words, we can say that it shines in multifarious forms. One should meditate in the core of one's heart because the heart is the essence of all the principles, which abide closest to the heart. First of all the aspirant should meditate with concentration on the uni-:1avoredness (sc1marasya) of prcl~w. apana, and udana, represent-ing the moon, the sun, and the fire. This meditation is to be per-~ormed by stopping the outgoing and ingoing movement of vital air m such a way that pra~za, apana, and udana, after giving up the functioning in their respective manners, become one, leaving out all distinctions. As fire blazes up with the churning process of ara~zi, in a similar way, the opposing movement of both pra~w and ap(ina, being stopped, enters into the current in the middle path. which transforms it into the fire of udana, known as the great ter-rible fire blazing upward. This fire is known as the great fire because it consumes the limitedness of the conscious subject. its object, and its instrument of knowledge. Thus, with attaining per-fection in such meditation, the meditator becomes free from all Ii m itations and then he makes an effort to attain oneness with the highest subject. 54. The highest subject is supposed to be encircled with twelve energies. They are associated with creation. maintenance, dissolution. and the fourth one designated as nameless (a11(ikllyc7). This nameless one. being without limitations. is associated with each of the other three. Therefore the number hecomes twelve. They are as follows:"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"NOTES 227 (a) srni-sr~fi, srni-sthiti, srni-smizlztira, srni-antikhyti (b) sthiti-sr~ f i, s th it i-s th i ti, s th i ti-smizlzara, stlziti-anakhya (c) salizhara-sr~fi, sa rizha ra-stlziti, salizhti ra-smizhara, smizhara-anakhya. 55. The transcendent wheel (anuttara cakra) consisting of twelvefold nature. going outside through the outlets of the eye, etc., assumes the nature of the object. This object is characterized by the moon; the sense organs, representing the sun, are the instrument of knowledge (pranuz~za); while the knowing subject is the fire. 56. After the destruction of all the objects, they remain existent in the form of residual traces. Therefore, they should also be placed into the flames of the fire of consciousness. 57. While giving exposition of the mystery of uccara related to the movement of the vital energy, the author states that due to this movement an unmanifest sound becomes manifest. This unmani-fest sound is called unstruck sound (analzata). Before the rise of pra~1a, the aspirant causes it for a moment to rest in his heart. 58. By the term void (iii nya) negation is meant. This is the state of dis-solution of all objects. The heart is known as the void where nonex-istence of any positive entity is possible. It is essentially of the nature of consciousness where bliss the essence of it, remains per-fectly blossoming. It is because of th,is nature that it is called innate blissfulness (nijananda). The experiencing subject feels it as tl~e very nature of the Self. With direct vision of one's own nature this blissfulness becomes manifest. 59. At this level, as there is no existence of objectivity in any way, the experience of the delight that occurs there is called .niran~nda. Then the energy of consciousness. after making the void manifest, assumes the nature of vital energy, which possesses dual form. On the one hand, prti~za is insentient, and on the other it is sentient. for the Lord has made it distinct from other insentient objects by bestowing sentiency on it and has made it the experiencing subject. It experiences the bliss of its own (11ij(l11a11da), however. as the experiencing subject proceeds along the knowable objects touching the instrument of knowledge. In other words, when it becomes slightly inclined toward externality, then the bliss which remains"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"228 NOTES associated with it is known as nirananda. Th is is because it loses the earlier nature of blissfulness belonging to the experiencing sub-ject alone. 60. Parcinanda literally means the bliss belonging to the other. With the rise of the knowable which occurs along with the rise of apa~za, distinction or otherne~s shows itself. Therefore, the bliss that becomes manifest, at this stage, does not belong to the Self but to something distinct from it. It is for this reason that it is called parananda. 61. On the level of samana all the knowables become intermixed with one another and show themselves as the unity of all. The delight that develops as a result of this is highly extensive and nourishing. It is for this reason that a yogin experiences this particular kind of bliss as brahmci nanda. 62. The number of the movements of the inhalation and exhalation is 21,600 during the period of 24 hours. When the yogin is able to dissolve the inhaling and exhaling breaths in the middle current (madhya marga), only then the vital air known as pra~w transforms itself and becomes udana. When one is able to rest there, one expe-r_iences bliss abiding in the experiencing subject, which is quite dis-tinct from nij[L!landa and other types of bliss. It is called rnahananda because of its greatness. 63. After one attains and experiences mahananda, one advances fur-ther and as a result of the rise of vyana, the great all-pervasive one. one experiences bliss free from all accidental attributes. This type of bliss is known as bliss of consciousness (cidlinanda). 64. Some technical terms connected with the concept of repose (vifrcintl) are known as pragiinada, udbhava, kampa, nidra, and ghf\"a~zi. Their meanings are as follows: when the yogin utilizes the means related to the body to attain the highest reality, he experi-ences a sort of delight which is the result of his intention toward fullness (pfir~wtii). The emergence of delight occurs only at his contact with fullness. When the yogin remains absorbed in that delightful state (even for moment), his firm conviction regarding his identity with body is severed as if with the flash of 1 ight of con-"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"NOTES 229 sciousness. Then he experiences a sudden '\"upward movement\" known as \"\"a jump upward\" (udblzava). This takes place because the pu 11 in the opposite direction becomes absent. As all the bonds functioning in the lower regions are cut off by the light, this upper pul 1 leads the aspirant to feel and attain his own innate potency, the energy of which cuts off all the bonds of ignorance. This state is technically known as kampa, which literally means shaking. Then the state that follows is called nidra. At this state all external sense organs cease to function, and even the internal ones stop to func-tion properly. Hence he feels a kind of slumber which is a tempo-rary state, for when he attains steadiness in pure consciousness, he experiences the immanence of consciousness and is able to realize that all, whatever that might be, is, in essence, consciousness. Wi~h this direct realization he wanders or whirls (ghanzate), that IS, arrives at the state of vibrate consciousness, until finally the state of great pervasiveness (malzavyapti) begins to shine forth. T~e effect of this is that his ignorance, which is his firm conviction 1Il the form of conceiving the nonself as the self, is destroyed first. This is followed by the destruction of the conviction of conceiving the self as nonself. Finally, the yogin directly realizes the true nature of the Self. 65. The five states like waking, etc., are related to the triangle centrally located in the 1111.lladlu1ra, where the delight is experienced. The bulb is the location of udblzava, kampa is experienced in the hear.t, the palate is the place of the sleep (nidra), while the whirl (glzfinu) is experienced at the ·end of twelve' (dvadasanta). 66. The absolute state of the heart of repose which is attained thro_ugh_ uccara is technically known as unmanifest [liliga]. This liliga ~~of three types, i.e., avyakta, vyaktavyakta, and vyakta. Avyakta lzn?a is characterized by absorption (/lnam) where everything loses .Its individuality. However, it is only experienced while one remams unified with it. It is this state from which the universe emerges and where it finally goes to rest. The manifested-unmanifested (vyakta-vyakta) form of liliga is of the nature of absorption with highest reality, which shines in the form. \"'I am This.\" Therefore, it is related to the pure level of dynamic energy on the one hand, and on"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"230 NOTES the other, to the objective world. The manifest (vyakta) li1iga is of the nature of cognition in which I-Consciousness becomes subordi-nated and manifests itself as if distinct from it and therefore shines as \"This.\" However, even at this level it does not lose its pure nature of consciousness. 67. The movement of vital energy is of two kinds. The first one is vibra-tive and natural, while the other is of the nature of activity and is born of effort. The dynamic movement of the vital energy is ever associated with a sound which is known as unstruck sound (anahata). It goes on sounding automatically in the heart of every living being. There is none to utter it or to stop it. All the phonemes abide inseparably in it. Furthermore, yogins experience two dis-tinct aspects of nada. The first is ever shining which does not have any rest. It only rises once and remains shining forever. Another aspect of ntida is one which rises but which also sets. However, the subtle nada where all the phonemes inseparably abide is known as the unmanifest sound. Two seed mantras (bljas) called srni and swizhara are its manifested forms. In other words, ntida is cog-nized by the help of these seed syllables. 68. These are the letters from \"ka\" varga to the end of \"pa\" varga. In this context they are used as mantras. 69. Samaya is known as convention, i.e., a supposed relation between words and their meanings. Chapter Six 70. The vital air is 'of the nature of universal vibration' (stimdnvaspan-dana), which assumes the form of 'individual vibration'. (vi§e~a spanda) known as pra~rn. apana, samtina, uddna, and vy{i!lG. These five prti~ws are locations that must he harnessed for the attainment of supreme reality. 71. The external objects to which one could take recourse for the attain-ment of the highest reality are: a sacred diagram (ma~1(/ala), an altar. vessels. rosary beads, scriptures. the symbolic form of Siva, a human skull (!lira), a form made of plaster or a painting, or an image or statue in the likeness of one's teacher, etc. They may be"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"NOTES 231 employed in any number and exhibit a wide variation in specific form. provided one recognizes the object's purpose is attaining the highest reality. 72. The procedure regarding the vital air (prti~za) is discussed first because in its creative upsurge, consciousness first assumes the nature of pril ~za. For this reason, one desirous of the attainment of supreme reality first takes recourse inpra~za. Furthermore, all the 'six paths' (~a(iadhvils) are supposed to abide inpra~za. In the Tan-tra loka. Abh i navagupta writes: \"The former of the sixfold paths, which again is threefold, is known as the path of time. Clearly this path is established in the vital energy (pra~za)\" (TA 6.37). 73. Manifestation or luminous shining forth of entities occurs in a two-fold way: either by following a sequential order or manifesting without any sequence. The former shines through the relation of cause and effect, i.e., the cause shines prior to the effect, which comes later. When it shines without any sequential order, for exam-ple, the knowledge arising from the perception of a painting appears as a unified whole in which priority and posteriority sh~ne at the same ti me. The author states elsewhere that the 'mutative activity' (kalana) is responsible for the manifestation of all si~ paths which are distinct from one another, and also for those enti-ties in their respective forms of limitations. Both sequence a.n~ non-sequence shine in the vital energy, which is one of the ac.tI~I­ties of time. As it causes mutations. divisions. and change. it is known as kclla. which is derived from the verbal root '\"kal, .. one of the meanings of which is to cause change. 74. Consciousness is eternal. It is free from the fetters of space and ti me. The Lord, who is in essence light, on account of his free will. creates the universe composed of sentient subjects and their objects. This is done hy the power of time called Kall, the dynamic energy which is the cause that creates change in external and internal enti-ties. However, it is relevant to note here that consciousness in its essence is entirely free from change. 75. The power of time. which is inseparably associated with conscious-ness (sa 111vit), causes everything to manifest externally. The result"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"232 NOTES of this mutation is that the very consciousness itself assumes the nature of vital energy, in which all forms hegin to shine forth. However, in this process of externalization, consciousness by its free will separates the universe from itself. At that time it cognizes, \"I transcend everything.\" This is the experience characteristic of the void (ffmya) of consciousness. This void of consciousness seems to be static. However, dynamism in the form of a slight vibrating pulsation begins to show itself. When this happens, the first creative flow begins to proceed outwardly into manifestation. This flow is not the flow of consciousness but of the vital energy. 76. When the power of activity becomes predominant, the entire cre-ation shines forth in a twofold way. First is the 'path of time' (kaladhva), and second is the 'path of space' (defridhva). The path of time consists of three forms known as varna, mantra, andpada. The path of space has also three divisions, i.e .. kala, tattva, and bhuvana. 77. Normally the movement of the vital air proceeds from the 'region of the bulb' located below the generative organ and the anus. However. no spiritual result can possibly be attained by the normal movement of the breath. Therefore, the vital breath should be made to flow from the heart by one's own effort. The 5aktis named vamti, }ye~! ha, and raudrl belong to the prahhu iakti and impel the movement of the breath, either singly or in combination. While the !§aktis related to the Lord, one's own power. and the vital energy jointly all cause the vital breath to move upwards, at different ti mes they assume the dominant and subordinate roles with respect to one another. When the vamafakti aspect of prabhu becomes predomi-nant, the person remains inclined toward the world and material objects; when the jye~flzasakti aspect of prabhu assumes domi-nance, it brings about the enlightenment of the aspiranc the raudrf aspect of prabhu keeps a person Ii nked to the world. but at the same time it helps him to attain identity with Siva. 78 · In the movement of the breath from the heart up to the ·end of twelve' (dvada5~linta), the vital air occupies the space of thirty-six digits in length. If the four quarters of the day are supposed to exist"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"NOTES 233 there, then nine digits is the length of one quarter. One half of a tufi is the time of the junction (sandhi). 79. The day is the period when the sun shines and the moon, in the form of apa na, declines. For this reason, the day is conceived to be the period of the dark fortnight. Similarly, during the night, apana, in the form of the moon, arises; therefore, the night is conceived as the bright fortnight. 80. There are two places of 'repose' (vifranti), composed of half of a tufi each. They are in the center of the heart and at the 'end of the twelve' (dvadasanta), free from the changing effects of time. Both locations are the junctions of prti~za and apana. The time unit for each of them is one tuf i. 81. Here the concept of day and night is explained in a different way. The day is the period when manifestation of objects occurs; the night is that period when blissfulness becomes predominant. 82. 'The passage of a planet from one sign of the zodiac to another' (salizkranti), occurs in six sections each along the path of the vit~l breath. They are: makara, kumbha, mfna, nze$a, vf$a, and nut-huna, while on the other half they are: karka, sitiz/za, kanya, tuld. vr~cika, and dhanu. Similarly, the sun's progress towards the north and towards the south, respectively, is also conceived of as occur-ring in the breath. The period during which the sun moves to the north is considered to be the bestower of good results in the other world, while the period during which the sun proceeds towards the south is considered to be the bestower of good results in this mate-rial world. 83. The twelve superintending deities, one for each month, are ca!led rudras and named Daksa Canda Hara, Candi, Pramatha, Blnma, Manmatha, Sakuni, Su~1~tL N~nda, Gopalak~, and Pitamaha. 84. If the movement of the vital breath covers one digit, only represent-ing a season (two months), then the sun's movement occupies only the span of three digits. As a result, the span of one year will be six digits and in one single movement of the outgoing and ingoing vital breaths twelve years can be conceived."},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"234 NOTES 85. The normal period of the year with reference to human beings and the supposed year of the vital breath are different. 86. The span of a divine year is said to to consist of 12,000 human years. This period is divided into four divisions known as: krta, consisting 4,000 years: treta, consisting of 3 ,000 years; dwzpara, consisting of 2,000 years; and kali, whose duration is 1,000 years. Thus, the total comes to 10,000 years, while the remaining 2 ,000 years are considered to be junctions. The span of these junctions is 400, 300, 200, 100 years and counted in the following way: the last 100 years of the kali are added to the first 400 years of the krta; thus the span of the first junction is 500 years. Similarly, the duration of the junc-ture of the krta and treta is 400 years plus 300, and thus 700 years; next, the duration of the juncture of the tre({l and dvapara is 300 years plus 200 and thus 500 years; finally, the juncture of dvapara and kali is 200 years plus 100, yielding 300 years. Therefore, the accumulated duration of all the junctions is 2000 years. 87. Different lndras are said to be the rulers in different cycles of Manu. During the period in which Brahma remains active, fourteen cycles of Manu pass on. This long period is said to be a span of one day of Brahma's life. His night is of the same span. 88. The term \"three worlds°' refers to the nether world along with the bhub. bhuvab, and svab. 89. The night in avyakta is said to be a kind of dissolution. However, this is a subsidiary dissolution (pralava) and not a principal one (mahapralaya). -90. According to the teachings of agamas, those who have attained lib-eration following the doctrine of Saq1khya and other systems are certain to be created again at the start of new creation. This is because their liberation is of limited nature and docs not elevate them above mli_wl. For details see Chapter Eight. 91. The sheaths (kaiicukas) are five or six. They are n iya ti, ka Id, raga, vidya, kalci, and maya. Maya is the all-pervading principle. The day of kalci is the duration of 100 years of those who 1 ive in the principle nivati. In the same way, 100 years of kala is the span of a day of thos~ who I ive in the principle raga. One hundred years of"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"NOTES 235 principle called raga are only one day of the principle ofvidya. In the same way the day of the principle kala comprises 100 years of the pri nc i pie vidyti. Similarly, one day of maya is made of 100 years of the principle kala. 92. The night related to the principle of Sadasiva is considered to be the great dissolution (mahtipralaya). During this period all the paths (adhvas) remain dissolved in the state of equilibrium. The super-intending deity known as Sadasiva is dissolved in the primal sound (nada). This primal sound is in turn dissolved into sakti, sakti into vyapini and vyapini into sama11a. In sa111a11a there is no trace of time. It is the everlasting state. It is from this state that time arises 1 ike the opening and closing of the eyelids. Though all the limit~d souls rest in this supreme state of equilibrium, they do not attam final liberation. 93. The creations and dissolutions are highly extensive and varied and abide in the vital energy. The vital energy is essentially of _the nature of vibrative energy (spa11da). This energy, from which time and its divisions emerge, is ever-pulsating. Time is not at all abso-lute but relative. and it has its base in the will of the Lord. On account of the vibration of consciousness, the minute moment becomes varied and it is experienced as highly extensive. 94. There are two 'ends of twelve' (dvadasanta). One is above brah-mtirandhra and the other is in miiladhara. The first is known ~s sivadvtidasdnta, the end of twelve related to Siva, and the other is known as the end of twelve related to sakti. 95. The six causal deities (kara~za$afka) each have six centers. They abide in those centers in the ascending and descending order. The superintending deities of the respecti~e centers function in differ-ent stages of 1 i fe and finally bestow release (mok$a). 96. The ten principal channels that pra~za circulates through are i(ia, piligala, su~·wwul, gandhtirl, !zastiyjihva, pzi$a. ya.(a, alamlzbusa, kuh a, and S(11ikhinl. Although all the channels have emerged from the navel. they become manifest in the heart. 97. The superintending deities of directions are ten. They are Indra, Vahni. Yama, and so on. They rotate in a cyclic order and as a"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"236 NOTES result, limited souls act in accordance with the nature of these dei-ties. Sometimes they are morbid, sometimes they are haughty, sad, elated, happy, unhappy, etc. 98 · The names of three principal channels are i(la, piligala, and su~ umna. They are supposed to be located inside the spinal cord. f~[J is placed at the left, pi1igala to the right, and su~unzna in the mid-dle of the spinal cord. I(fri represents the moon. pi1igalii the sun, and su~wnna the fire. While the vital air samana moves along these three principal channels up and down, they assume the nature of the sun, the moon, and fire. 99. All the Sanskrit syllables are divided into eight groups (varga). All the vowels come under \"a\" group (varga). The number of vowels is sixteen. Then come the group of \"ka,\" \"ca,\" \"ta,\" ''fa,\" \"pa,\" \"sa,\" and the group of semi-vowels. 100. The number of half mc1tras regarding \"ka\" and so on is thirty-three. Half nzatras of long vowels are thirty-two. Phonemes known as pluta have six half matras. Therefore, the total of half matras is 81. Chapter Seven 101. According to this system, the Lord's power of action (kriyasakti) manifests time and space as 'paths' (adhvas). The path of space is a means of unifying and traversing insubstantial and substantial forms such as the intellect, the altar or image, the void. Despite this diversity, all these forms abide in consciousness and have their place of repose (vifranti) in consciousness. 102. On the path, all forms shine internally and externally through the outlets of consciousness; this is how they are created and mani-fested. Consciousness, in its autonomy, shines as hoth the knowing subject and its object. The variety of objects, though not different from the knowing subject, appears as if different from it. 103. The aspirant attains the nature of Bhairava hy perceiving everything. from the all-consuming fire (kMagni) said to ahide at the bottom of the earth, to the highest principle, i.e., andfrita§iva, in ascending order and unifying them into the singularity of I-Consciousness."},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"NOTES 237 104. Worlds of a variegated nature are included under the principle of earth. The sphere under which they shine is called the sphere of Brahma. Similarly, other spheres, e.g., the sphere of prakrti, the sphere of maya, and the sphere of sakti, are wider than the preced-ing one. All the principles from water to prakrti come under the sphere of prakrti. All the principles from plirll$G to maya come under the sphere of maya. The extent of the sphere of sakti extends up to the Sadasiva principle. Thus, the number of spheres (a~ztjas) is four. The spheres are the masses of substance which have fallen from the state of energy. 105. According to this system, there are ten 'guardians of the quarters' in accordance with the number of directions. The guardians of each direction are composed of a group of ten, consisting of a superintending deity and nine subordinates. Taken as ten groups of ten guardians, the total number becomes 100 deities; therefore, they are known as the \"Hundred Rudras\" (Satarudras). 106. This system envisions a limitless number of 'worlds' made from and dominated by each principle. These worlds exist so that souls which have not received the Saiva form of initiation, but have attained a lower form of perfection through a continuous practice of concentration, receive a body and sense organs best suited for experiencing pleasure and pain in a particular world, an.d may finally attain identity with the Lord. Every world has supenntend-ing deities who are called the Lords of that world. 107. Located in the intellect principle (buddhi tattva) are eight ·wor~ds' (bhuvana), each dominated by a class of heavenly beings or -~eity_: pisacas, raksasas. yaksas, gandharvas, Indra, Soma, PraJapati, and Brahma. 108. According to the Svacclzanda Tantra, the names of the worlds under prakrti are: Akrta, Krta, Vaiblzava, Brahmd. Vaf $~zava, Kaumara, 'belonging to Uml'i' (Auma), and 'belonging to Srikat).t ha.' K~emaraja explains that those who have practiced yoga with renunciation attain the 'world' (blzuvana) named Akrta, while those who practiced karmayoga reach the blzuvana named Krta. Similarly, those who practiced nirmanayoga go to the world of"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"238 NOTES rbhus. The abode of Brahma is attainable to those who practice yoga with conviction that puru~a is one universal soul. The abode of Vi~IJU is the final resort for those who strictly practiced yoga according to Vai~IJava tradition. Those who practice yoga main-taining celibacy (brahmacarya) go to the abode of Kaumara world. The abodes above this named Au ma and Sraikantha, are the abodes of those who pra~tice yoga according to the Saiva doctrine. 109. There are seven groups of eight deities who preside over different principles. The first is called patyntaka, the group of eight Lor~s beginning with Lakuli§a and ending with Amare5a. The second ~s called Guhyti!jfaka who are the Lords of fire: the first of them 15 Bhairava. The third group is Atiguhyti~'ftaka, which rules over the principle named wind (vayu). The fourth group of eight is called Pavitrc1naka, with Sthanu, etc., who rule over the principle called akafo. The fifth group of eight, beginning with Stlz(i/a and ending with Clzagala~14,a, rules over ahc11i1ktira. The sixth group of eight divinities called Yonya!jfaka rules over the in tel leer.

The number of worlds in nirrttikala is sixteen~ in pratisthti the numher is fifty-six; in vidya the number is twenty-eight: in sanM the number is eighteen. There are no worlds in .frintcitrtti.

The generic attribute of all jars is jarness, i.e., that which perme-ates all jars. The highest Lord, Siva, is far more extensive than any other generic attribute; therefore, he is the greatest universal by whose 1 ight everything shines. 116. According to this system. where some specific characteristics such as, support, solidity. etc., are found, that is to be known as the earth principle. These characteristics of the earth are seen in the regions beginning with the all-consuming dreadful fire (kaMgni) and ending in the world of Virabhadra. 117. The theory of the nature of absolute causal relation states that even at the emergence of creation, the universe is nothing but an expan-sion, an 'opening up' (srni) of the light of the autonomous Lor~. The Lord is also the cause of 'maintenance' (stlziti). i.e., the um-verse remaining steadily present within the Self; and 'withdrawal' (sa!izhara), the state of rest in one's own Self. According to this theory, in reality no change has taken place in the Self, which is identical with consciousness. Furthermore, internality and exter-nal ity are not distinct from each other but two sides of the same reality. The artificial or fictional causa'l relation is not real. and is accepted only to help explain the state existing in mayti. The ~o~er of causal relation is limited and governed by the Lord's restncttve power (niyati). 118. For the creation of a particular object, some elements are ?resent in the beginning and others follow it in a regular order. This or~er of sequence, in the form of priority and posteriority, renrn11~s invariably presenc for example, the clay used in making a jar is always present before the jar itself comes into existence. 119. Every effect has in its background the sentient cause as its agent. If the conscious agent is absent, the aggregation of all the causes, either individually or collectively, cannot produce the intended object. For example, even if the stick for moving the potter's wheel. clay, and other necessary materials for making a jar are present. the jar cannot be produced if the potter himself is absent. There-fore, it is concluded that a conscious agent is required for produc-"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"240 NOTES ing an effect. However. all of the above-mentioned instruments, along with the sentient agent, are considered as the cause of any action which in reality terminates in consciousness. 120. It is generally accepted that the causal relation depends on or is controlled by the restrictive power of the Lord. Therefore, it is relative. but the absolute causal relation depends on none. Con-sciousness shines in the form of the universe. For instance, all the principles (tattvas) from earth to Siva are dependent on the one prior to it. The earth is supported by the water, the water helps the earth for its solidity. Furthermore. all the elements are unable to come into being without the existence of subtle elements. In the same way, these subtle elements cannot come into existence with-out the blossoming action of the sense organs. That again is impos-sible without determination regarding different sense organs. This also is not possible without the existence of the primary matter inseparably and equally linked with all. which is known as miilaprakrti. This primary matter, being an enjoyable object, is unable to exist without the subject that enjoys it. The subject that experiences it is the sharer of the experience of different objects of experience. It is for that reason that it is considered limited. Thus. the limitation that is seen in a conscious subject (pztru$a) is only imposed and not real. This imposed limitation is due to klila, ka/[l, niyati, raga, and vidya, which cannot be activated without con-sciousness (sa,,zvit). However, consciousness, being partless, can-not manifest without the existence of the delusive power called maya. Freedom, the cause of 1 imitation. has comparative distinc-tions of manifestation. These features are shining in the beginning as slightly unlimited, then unlimited, then slightly blossoming and finally are fully bloomed. However. these states of the manifesta-tions by the power of freedom could not be possible without that which is perfectly luminous by nature. which in this system is called Bhairava. 121. This remark explains the existence of differentiation or multiplicity in spite of the presence of the Ahsolute everywhere. 122. Mount Meru cannot be supposed to he the cause of the jar, because"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"NOTES 241 it exists in a distant place. The question implied here is, how could the universe be created by a Lord who remains distant? 123. This is to say that the effects can be produced in a variety of ways. 124. Siva is, in essence. consciousness. He is perfectly full and free from desire. In the state of maya, the limited soul feels a longing for an object in order to fulfill his desires. The desire arises in the 1 i m ited sou 1 because of some want in him. The Lord, on the other hand. does not lack anything. Therefore. there is no question of any desire in him. However, on account of his freedom, a sort of intention toward tasting of his delight continuously goes on. The pentad named siva' sakti, sadasiva, isvara, and suddlzavidyti, who abide in the pure path (adlzva), shine with comparative intensity from the relish of the taste of delight on account of his autonomy. It is because of the comparative intensity of this relish that con-sciousness manifests itself as \"I\" (aha111). This is known as the state of sakti. In other words, consciousness which is absolute (an utta ra) now sees (as if), on the mirror of consciousness, its own reflection and cognizes it to be its own, then the cognition that fol-lows is \"\"I am This\" (alzam idam). In this instance, the substratum where it shines is \"\"I\" and \"This\" shines as an indistinct outline of the picture. In the cognition, \"I am This,\" ''I\" is the principal and \"'Th is\" has the subordinate position. The principle known as sadasiva abides where the host of the subjects called mantre5vara cognizes the universal light of consciousness as ··1 am This:'' But on the level of the knowing subjects called mantrefrara, thi_s ~og­mtion assumes the form of \"This is L\" where .. This\"' is vividly prominent and ··I,. is subordinate. This principle is called isva:a, where \"This\" as the knowable shines with \"I,\" invariably one with it. In suddlzavidvti on the other hand, there is no distinction between princip~lit~ and subordinacy. There both .. I\" and ''This\" shine in a balanced way. 125. In this triadic system, subjects are of seven kinds. They are known as sakala, pralaytikala, vijl1tinakala, mantra, mantre.frara, mantramalzefvara, and Siva. Impurities are of three kinds. They are lz~zava, miiyfya, and karma. The a~zavamala is of two kinds."},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"242 NOTES First, it lacks right knowledge regarding the Self, which is of the nature of consciousness. The second is the wrong notion of con-ceiving non-self, that is, the body, the sense organs, pra~w. etc., as the Self. The impurity born of maya (maylya) causes the notion of difference. The impurity born of deeds (karma) appears to the soul to be of the nature of virtue and vice. Impurities are considered to be the bond by which souls remain bound to worldly existence. The knowing subjects who have all of the above three defilements (mala) are called sakala. The souls known as pralayakala have two such impurities, i.e., a~zava and karma. The vijllanakala souls have only one mala. They are of two kinds: (a) free vij1zanakala souls, in which all impurities have ended, and (b) vijllanakala souls, in which some trace of impurity still persists. From among the first group, eight vidyefvaras are selected, and from the second group seven million mantras serve the Lord to help the worldly people. 126. Siva is always perfectly full of His five powers. However, he mani-fests different principles in which a particular energy shines pre-dominantly while other energies remain subordinate. On account of this factor different principles, even in this pure path, and dis-tinct features like Siva, Sadasiva, etc., become manifest. 127. According to this system, defilement (mala) is not a distinct sub-stance as accepted by dualist Saiva thinkers. 128. It is comparable to a seed, which does not take root and blossom externally and is going to be destroyed. 129. The characteristic of kala is limited doership. 130. In some doctrines kala evolves after niyati, but in the present text niyati is mentioned after kala. The reason for this is that the causal relation cannot stand without time, for the regular order of the cause preceding the effect cannot take place without time. Priority and posteriority can exist only when time comes into heing. 131. Kala is the agent which creates the knowable object and the effect as separate from itself. I 32. Sukha is the state of agitation which is pleasant. raj as is the state of agitation which is painful, while tamas is the state of agitation which lacks awareness."},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"NOTES 243 133. Above intellect (buddlzi) and below the primordial matter (prakrti), a gwza principle (tattva) is supposed to exist. It is only an aspect of prakrti, the balanced state of three gu~zas. Therefore, the balanced state of gu~zas is called prakrti and its agitated aspect is known as gu~w tattva. However, gu~za is not counted as a distinct principle from prakrti. The impelling force that agitates or breaks the bal-ance of prakrti is the superintending deity of the tattva. The agita-tion in prakrti occurs in relation to those who desire enjoyment, but in those in whom these desires of enjoyment have disappeared, this agitation does not create any effect. According to the Trika system, agitation in prakrti is caused by the Lord SrikaIJ.thanatha. 134. According to Samkhya philosophy, prakrti is insentient, while puru~a is sentient but non-active either in bondage or in liberation. Therefore, some external agent of aaitation is required. According , b f !o Saiva philosophy, agitation is created by the intervention ° Isvara. 135 · As, for example, when one perceives an object, the cognition \"I see a tree\" arises. In this instance, \"I\" is a subject and a tree is an object. The relationship between the two, the experiencing subject and object is the result of alzalizktira. For seeing a tree, eyes are sufficient, but the sight of the tree is experienced by the instru-ment \"I\" ahmizkara. 136. When, by spiritual practice, the mind becomes subtle, it do~s n~t require any external instrument for perception. At that pomt, it can see through the sense of touch and experience touch through the sense of hearing, etc. 137. This is a reference to the Vaise~ika school of thought, according to which sense organs are born of matter. Chapter Nine 138. Here thirty-six principles (tattvas) are understood in terms of seven kinds of knowing subjects (pramtitti) residing on the seven spheres along thirty-six principles. 139. The plural ending attached to the names of these seven knowing subjects indicates the existence of a great number of knowing sub-jects belonging to each of these groups."},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"244 NOTES 140. In the lowest sphere, from earth to prakrti, reside the sakala know-ing subjects. The sakala knowing subjects are capable of perceiv-ing only the principles from earth to prakrti. The higher knowing subjects, who possess more extensive subjectivity and therefore possess qualitatively different energies (!foktis), are capable of per-ceiving the higher principles. 141. In TA 10:3-5, Abhinavagupta explains: The principles from earth to prakrti are divided into fifteen on the basis of the [seven] possessors of power (iaktirnan), their powers (iaktis). along with their ·unique nature' or \"thing in itself' (svarupa). There are thir-teen divisions from puru$a to kahl; eleven divisions [exist] when the pralayakala [group of knowing sub-jects] becomes the thing in itself; it is similar with mtiyti; [there are] nine divisions when the thing in itself becomes vijnlintikala; seven divisions [manifest] when the man-tra [knowing subjects] becomes the unique nature; a threefold division [arises] when the mantramahesvaras become the unique nature. Siva, whose nature is con-sciousness, which is dance of uninterrupted 1 ight, has no division. 142. The expression prameyarnyogya means: 'that which is worthy to be conceived as an object itself,' that is, as insentienc it is neither energy nor the possessor of energy. 143. According to this system, the universe is of a threefold nature. non-transcendent (apara), transcendent-non-transcendent (parti-para), and transcendent (para). In other words, reality is primarily conceived as possessing an objective side (nara). energy (sakti), and a possessor of the energy (saktiml1n). However, Abhi-navag up ta points out that the 'thing in i tse 1 f' (sm nlpa) is the sphere of objectivity, the .frlkta is the sphere of perception, and the possessor of power is the perceiver or knowing subject. Therefore. all seven knowing subjects are Siva, who possesses different ener-gies, that is. different powers in the different spheres in which they operate. The thing in itself is common to all of them, which pro-vides a degree of objectivity."},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"NOTES 245 144. Limited knowledge (vidya) and limited agency (kala) are consid-ered to be the energies of the sakala souls, who are defiled by all three impurities (malas). Although sakala souls are bound and limited by impurities, they possess the powers of knowledge and action. 145. The word asplzufa means indistinct or dormant. In pralayakala souls, vidya and kala are still present; however, they remain dor-mant because they rest in deep sleep (su~upti). 146. The sevenfold differentiation of the saktis is used for the purpose of elaboration and instruction. In reality, there is only one fakti belonging to the Lord; that is, His svatantryasakti, which is inseparably united with Him. This autonomy manifests itself as many saktis, but at the same time keeps all of them within and shines as one. 147. Distinctions among the instruments do not create distinction in the subject. The supreme subject, by means of its power of freedom, creates divisions in its own Self by causing some to shine as an object, and others as an instrument. 148. Here begins a long and complex argument in which Abhinavagupta attempts to refute 'doctrine of perceptibility' advocated by the Mimamsa school. According to the Mima1i1sa theory, in o~d~~ to be perceived, every object must possess a quality of percept1biltty.; any object devoid of this quality cannot be perceived. ~bhi­navagupta disagrees and attempts to prove that perceptibility is. not the quality of an object, but a power possessed by the perce~ver. All entities already exist within consciousness, and when a given entity appears within the organs of perception of a perceiver, then it becomes an object of perception. Everything is illuminated ~y consciousness, including defilement (mala), as well as non-exis-tence, because for a thing to be non-existent, it must be included in consciousness. Therefore, objective existence depends on con-sciousness, and is not perceptible independently from it. For Abhi-navagupta, it is important to establish this position. because he needs to argue that the knowing subject must develop a higher level of subjectivity to be able to perceive the larger and subtler spheres of reality."},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"246 NOTES 149. The one who is self-luminous does not need anyone to perceive this shining, because it is the very nature of the divine to shine. There-fore, He does not assume the nature of objectivity, and because of that the quality of being perceptible, which is distinct from its own Self, does not appear in Him. 150. The point here is that this feeling of jealousy does not abide in the beautiful woman, but in the person himself. 151. The act of watching this dance becomes complete when a person attains the state of aesthetic pleasure by becoming one with the unified light of awareness manifested through the watching audi-ence; thus, vidya and kala awaken subjectivity in sakala souls where objectivity is predominant. 152. The point here is that when objectivity in the principles frompuru~a to kala are conceived and the portions of the veils (km1rnkas) come into perception in the form of objects, then the subjectivity of puru~a is lost. 153. The distinctions have been ascertained. but the number of objects which possess multiple natures cannot be stated. Therefore, the author, taking a clay jar as an example, presents its varied nature. Its quality of being a knowable object is nothing but its identity with the knowing subject. Therefore. when the jar is known by all knowing subjects as a jar, then it comes under the sakala group. When. on the other hand. it is only perceived by Siva. it is none other than Siva Himself. 154. The seeker who apprehends the earth principle as Brahman, but who dies before becoming fully established in Siva, attains the state of vi}Fztin{ikala. 155. Those who practice the _voga of conceiving the earth principle as Brahman, by the end of the day of Brahma (kalpa), or at the time of death. attain the state of pralayakevala. 156. When the group of seven knowing subjects, from sakala to Siva, is agitated (prak\\wbha), they become intent on functioning in their respective fields. This agitation is known as a ·pulsation' or a 'change.' This brings about the appearance of the seven .<aktis: there-fore, the number of possessors of the .foktis (.foktiman) is also seven."},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"NOTES 247 157. The purity of pure knowable (suddlzaprameya) is a result of it not being touched by the knowing subject. This is the case with the earth principle as well as the thing in itself (svarzipas) of all the other principles as well. 158. When a person well-established in prti~za perceives an external object, his breath goes outside to a span of sixteen digits (migulas). When the final measure comes in contact with an object, the breath becomes identified with it. This is explained by the term tanmayr. 159. Those who are endowed with discerning capability are able to con-ceive fifteenfold nature to the end of pradlztina. 160. With the lessening of the number of thought constructs, the span of a tuf i also lessens. The lessening of the thought of this-ness (idanta) diminishes gradually, and it finally results in the form of absorption into Siva constituting two digits (migulas). l61. The word savadlztinata here means 'steadiness of consciousness of that is not to be diverted from here to there, or from this to that.' It means that the yogin remains attentive towards that one from which the knower of the object (gralzaka) arises. and from where the object gets its rise. It always remains steady in self-luminous consciousness alone. l62. According to early Saiva thinkers, such as Kalla.ta. the meani~g ~f the word piita is goddess Kall, Matrsadbhava. Bhairava, Prattb~a. However, the author himself is reluctant to go into depth explam-i ng the mystical meaning of this word. l63. When a yogin practices meditation in the tu.ti related either ~o mantramalzesvara, mantrefrara, or mantra, he is able to attam the siddlzis corresponding to these states. 164. The dream state is considered to be an instrument, or rather. a door, by the help of which one is able to arrive at the right form of knowledge. 165. The supreme consciousness externally assumes threefold nature. These are the object of knowledge (rlipam). the instrumentality indicated in the sentence a hove by the expression \"by means of sight.\" while the word alza111 indicates the subject of experience."},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"248 NOTES Therefore, the subject knows the object by means of the instru-ment, i.e., sight. However. the supreme subject (para) permeates and remains above these three. Chapter Ten 166. According to this system, there exists a subtle energy which func-tions to hold all the principles (tattvas) in their respective places. For example, the principle earth is held by the subtle energy called dharikcz. As the function of this energy is to contain or stop the earth, it is also called nivrtti. Similarly, the subtle energies called pratinha, vidya, and santa are active in other principles or in groups of them. 167. A~z(ia sphere, or egg, is that which serves as the wall separating one sphere from the other. They are also called coverings or veils (avara~za) which do not allow one sphere to penetrate another. 168. This is to say that the qualities, such as smell, taste, touch, etc .. belonging to earth and other tattvas exist also in the sakti tattva; however, their existence is not in the gross form but in the subtle. This is the reason why Siva is ritually worshipped in the phallic form made of five different elements. 169. The principle called Siva is free from any sorts of mutations, limi-tations, or thought constructs. 170. This is to say that transcendence cannot be an object of meditation. If an object of meditation were to exist in it, it would not be tran-scendent. Therefore, the kala that functions in the lower level, just below the highest, is known as stintti. However, Siva is beyond santcl; therefore, no name is suitable to describe the Immutable One. 171. Anything that shines as knowable remains existing for some time, but when the quality of being an object of knowledge disappears from the heart of the yogin, that which remains is known as thirty-si x principles. Even if, for the purpose of teaching, in that state, the divine is conceived as the thirty-seventh principle, then upon the disappearance of even this objectivity from it, the divine is conceived as the thirty-eighth principle."},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"NOTES 249 172. When the whole scheme of thirty-six tattvas is grouped into nine divisions, then their names are prakrti, puru~a, niyati, kala, maya, vidy{/, isvara, sadasiva, and Siva. 173. The worlds are perceived as objects of knowledge shining in three different forms of knowable objects. They are: kala, tattva, and blzuvana. In the same way, when they rest in the subject, they are also threefold, i.e., var~w, mantra, andpada. Chapter Eleven 174. Abh i navagupta 's thesis is, in essence, that consciousness (sa171vid) is a perfect unity, full and unchanging even when taking the forms of all manifestations and activities. What is contained in the first ten chapters of this work constitutes a short-cut for a small number of truth-seekers who, according to this system, have been pursui~g spiritual perfection over many lifetimes. The significance of this knowledge for others is made clear in this chapter. 175. It is stated in the Bhagavadgita that the fire of knowledge burns the karma of al 1 deeds. For one undergoing the experience of p~st deeds, it is necessary to remain involved in actions whose fruits are to he experienced in the future. The doer has to experience the results of past actions gradually, not all at once. There is no end to the cycle of deeds or their results, and for this reason the descen~ of grace (.<aktipdta) needs to be discussed. According to the posi-tion represented here, when Sakti 'opens up' in one's own selL right knowledge dawns spontaneously. 176. Ka rmasd mva occurs as a result of balance of two mutually oppo-site past actions. Both of these actions possess exactly equal power, and therefore restrict each other from producing any fruit. Accard-i ng to this theory, saktiptita takes place when these two deeds are ha lanced and their results neutralized. 177. According to the teacher Khetapala, that sakti whose nature is to restrain (n i rodlz i kti) arrests the ma/a. When impurities (ma/a) become perfectly ripened, the above sakti becomes inactive. and the proper manifestation of knowledge and action occurs. This cul-minates in the decent of grace (saktiptita) on a seeker."},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"250 NOTES 178. When the Lord assumes the form of bound being by accepting the limitations of time, space, etc., this does not entail any differentia-tion in His innermost nature. 179. The term jhafiti means 'without delay,' that is. taking recourse directly to anupaya. 180. The term 'by gradual process' (krame~w) refers to a method of ini-tiation, performance rituals, etc. 181. This is the Saiva explanation of the nature of the descent of grace. In the process of manifestation, the supreme Lord (Paramesvara) creates limited beings by concealing (tirohhava) His own Self through kancukas, tattvas, and the malas. He reveals his own Self by bestowing faktipata on limited souls. The entire process of con-cealment and revelation is the result of the autonomy (svatantrya) of the Lord. 182. This is to say that the autonomous and omnipresent Lord is impar-tial and therefore there is no object, activity, or person that He prefers over others. 183. As it is stated, the right kind of teacher (guru) is considered to be equal to Bhairava. This is because he possesses the fullness of self-realization as wel 1 as the right understanding of the meaning of the icistras. 184. Although sakti is present everywhere, it has different forms with different effects: asjye~thli-fakti, it leads one to the ultimate goal; on the other hand, the ghora and ghoratara-saktis, that is, the fearsome and the terrible, lead one toward worldly existence. Chapter Twelve 185. Vlras are Saiva practitioners deemed to have attained mastery over the senses and a high level of spiritual development. 186. The procedure of external bathing is as follows: keeping the mind steadily concentrated on the mantra given to him by the guru, one should follow the track of the cows while dust is still present in the air. One is supposed to enter. and should make three strides in the dust created by the cows. This is known as parthiva bath. In the"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"NOTES 251 same way, one should purify the whole body, beginning with head and ending with feet. by uttering the mantra of Siva with its five limbs (Ifana is the head, Tatpuru~a is the face, Aghora is the heart, Yamadeva is the hidden parts of the body, and Sadyojata is the whole body). Then, having cleansed the body with the mantra, one should plunge into the water repeating the mantra of Siva with its auxiliary parts. This is known as bathing with water. Taking ashes from the sacrificial fire. one should bur~ impurities present on the head, face, heart, genitals, and the feet with it while uttering the mantra \"'plza_t.\" When this is done one should throw a handful of these ashes on the head while repeating the mantra of Siva with its five 1 i mbs. This is known as bathing with ashes. One should n~ove back and forth in the pleasing air, remembering the mantra, giv~n to him by his guru, in his heart. This is known as bathing with air. One should bring the mantra into one's mind and should remain concentrated there fixing his concentration on the void (akaf~). This is known as bathing in the void. One who immerses on~self 1.n the 1 ight of the sun and the moon, identifying himself with Siva, is cleansed of all impurities. This type of bathing is called soma and a rka · The last type of bath is bathing in the Self (atma). In the Tan-tra loka. Abh i navagupta describes it in the following way: ... The very Self is the supreme Lord himself: it is free from dis~ipllnes es tab I ished in spiritual texts. It is like a great lake in exten~ion and depth: the universe should dissolve therein. upon which one becomes pure and the cause of purification for others.\" 187. The expression \"tatratatra\" refers to the five faces of Siva. i.e.· I fan a. Tatpurusa, etc. One is to first identify with these five faces of Siva, upon ~hich one attains full absorption into Siva. Chapter Thirteen 188. The author begins this chapter, which deals with initiation. by describing the procedure for selecting a suitable place for worship. mantra repetition, and practice of yoga. He discusses this topic in Chapter 15 of his TA, verses 80-115ab. At the very beginning, Abhinavagupta points out that only when one is serene and well-"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"252 NOTES disposed in his heart (blzava171 prasannam alocya) is he suitable to perform worship, and only then should he proceed to the place of worship. 189. In TA 15: 114a-115b, Abhinavagupta describes the place where the worship should take place: \"The suitable place-for either attaining perfection or liberation with regard to the practice of worship, mantra repetition, or attainment of samadhi-is the one where heart is inclined toward beauty and at peace.\" 190. The land of Aryans is between Himalaya and Yindhyacala. 191. Karaka is a term, used by Pal)ini in his A->fchlhyllyl, which denotes various participants in action presented by a sentence. The closest equivalent in other classical and some modern languages is a word 'case,' such as nominative, genitive, accusative, ablative, etc. 192. Abhinavagupta, who advocates the theory of the supreme nondual-ity, has to account for ritual action, which consists of factors or participants in action presented by a sentence (ktirakas), which because of their perceived distinction could he construed as con-tradicting nonduality. This was certainly the opinion of Samkara-carya and other Advaita Vedanta thinkers~ Abhinavagupta dis-agreed with this understanding and argues that action, distinction, change, etc., are also included within consciousness. To illustrate, we can take the example of the fol lowing sentence: I offer water from the sacrificial pot to Lord Siva with a spoon in the place of worship. The factors here are: the agent of acting, the object of the act, its instrument. its point of ablation, and the location of the act of worship. For Sarnkaracarya, the supreme reality cannot be of the same order as that of objective existence which is transient in nature. The Brahman is the transcendent, immutable, and partless reality, and all subjective and objective phenomena are only appearances possessing no real existence. The Brahman is without attributes and as immutable, it cannot he suhject to action. The attribute of changeability is the most important characteristic of objective existence, and therefore ever-changing empirical exis-tence must have a ground on which all these changes take place. The same. of course, applies to the ritual action. which. as we have"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"NOTES 253 seen, consists of the factors or the participants in action described by a sentence. For Abhinavagupta, on the other hand, the supreme reality, which consists of prakasa and vimaria, even in the process of externalization, remains established in its own Self, 'relishing' (camatka ra) the bliss of 'fullness' (pilnzatti), and 'independence' (svatantrya) of its own essential nature which is in no way over-shadowed by the external manifestatiod. The lower aspect of cre-ation is a contracted form of that supreme consciousness, which, through the activity of maya sakti, assumes limited forms, thus bringing into existence the notion of duality. Thus, the supre~e reality consists as much of differentiation as it does of unity. This differentiation always remains within that I-Consciousness and therefore is never separate from it. Thus, unlike Samkara _for whom action is always binding, Abhinavagupta accepts actwn, such as the ritual activity, as potentially liberating. 193 · In TA 15: 161, Abhinavagupta describes the role and the meaning of sacrificial vessel in Tantric ritual in the following way: \"All t~a~ which is touched by the drops of the water contained in the sacrifi-cial vessel becomes in fact pure. What other kind of purity ~?u1~,, there ever be but that of the touch of the rays of the sun of Siv~. Furthermore, \"As the Lord said in the Malinlvijayottara Tantra Ill the section dealing with the sacrificial vessel, it is necessary to be careful not to conceive anything as not being purified by it. E~ery­th i ng is purified by it and what is impure becomes pure\" (!A. 15: 162-163ab.) However, the impurity only belongs to the Itmited knowing subject abiding in maya and is not the essen_rial nature of things: \"Here we speak of impurity from the perspective of bo~ded souls and of their systems. The essential nature of all thmg_s remains in fact always the same, without changing from what it was earlier or what is conceived to be\" (TA 15: 163cd-164ab.) 194. All the various factors which constitute a ritual action attain iden-tity with Siva through the process of the placement of the syllables (nyasa). 195. This is to say that direction depends on how the forms are arranged in space."},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"254 NOTES 196. Here begins description of inner worship. In the course of this worship, one is expected to bring one's body, mind, void, and prat:ia into identity with Siva. See TA 15: 295b-3 l 2. 197. This is the reference to maladhclracakra, which, according to TA 15: 297cd, is located four fingers below the navel. 198. Here begins what Abhinavagupta calls 'the external sacrifice' because the disciple. after attaining identity with Siva through var-ious ritual acts, should project his consciousness externally in the vital breath, void, and up to the external plane. 199. There are eight purificatory rites and six deities. Therefore, the number becomes forty-eight. 200. For greater details in regard to the conventional rules and their detailed description, see TA 15: 521-611. 201. See TA 15: 576. Chapter Fourteen 202. Putraka or spiritual son is a type of initiation in which a disciple is adopted as a successor of a teacher. 203. Parivara or family refers to the group of subordinate deities cen-tered around the main deity. 204. This refers to the doors of the place where the rituals are per-formed. 205. For more details regarding the procedure of 'The Adoration of the Door' (dvtmlrcanam) see TA 15:184-190. 206. Abhinavagupta talks at length about the nature of animal sacrifice in TA 16:28-72. There, by quoting various scriptures, he points out that any type of animal killing, such as for profit. a wedding. or sport, is not al lowed except in the course of sacrifice (ydga). According to him, killing consists of separating an animal that still possesses each of the three impurities (malas) from the vital breath. On the other hand, the ritualistic sacrifice of an animal is not killing because, in the course of the ritual. the animal is first separated from three impurities, and thus it is separated from its body. Thus, for Ahhinavagupta. ritual sacrifice of an animal is a"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"NOTES 255 form of initiation which joins the animal with the higher principles and for the purpose of propitiating God. 207. The nirbfja type of initiation is given to those judged incapable of fol lowing the set of rules of post-initiatory conduct (samayapasa), as for example children, those who are dull, old people, women, those attached to their wealth, the sick, and so on. They attain lib-eration on account of their devotion to the teacher, deities, and scriptures. On the other hand, the sabija type of initiation is given to those who have the gift of reason, are capable of tolerating toils and difficulties, and are therefore capable of following the set of rules of pre-initiatory conduct. Chapter Fifteen 208. The initiation described in this chapter is given to a dying person. Ordinarily, the initiation is not given to all, and one desirous of initiation needs to show his devotion to teacher, deities, or scrip-tures. This devotion is in turn seen as an indication of the descent of grace (saktipti.ta), a'nd saktlpata is perceived as a definite sign that one is suitable for initiation. The conditions under which the teacher is expected to grant initiation to a dying person ~re described by Abhinavagupta in the TA 19: 4-6: When in a dyi~g person, the fall of even weak power is awakened-whether he is taken by devotion to a teacher and others: whether the fall of grace is through work of friends. relatives, etc.: whether he has. b~~n indeed regular (sa mayin) but has not obtained the supreme mitia-tion; whether, already having obtained it. he desi:es to leave as soon as possible his vital breaths, desirous of gorng ~way-the teacher shou Id provide for him the initiation of immediate depar-ture, free from impurities. However, the teacher must be caref~l not to give initiation to a person whose impurities (ma/as) haven t reach maturation or to one whose karma hasn't been exhausted (se~·aklirmikavigr;ihe). The commentator explains this compound to mean: one who is not about to die, that is, one whose prtirab-dhakarnza hasn't been fully exhausted. 209. Marnza is the place where the feeling of the connectedness with the body remains present."},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"256 NOTES 210. According to the Tantraloka, this is done by means of the nyasa, using the k~urika and other mantras. 211. That is, at the time of leaving one's body. 212. Abhinavagupta describes the nature of brahmavidya initiation and the qualifications a teacher needs to have to perform this kind of initiation in the following way: \"This initiation, which provides exit from the body, must be performed by a teacher who is experi-enced in yoga. How could one who has not practiced various pra~zayama exercises be in a position to affect it\" (TA 19:23cd-24ab). (The brahmavidya) is in a position of producing its effects automatically, such as the purification of the principles, etc. The teacher, thanks to the power of ritual action and mantras, can thus join the disciple with the supreme principle (tattva). Even if a teacher hasn't practiced yoga, he is nevertheless in a position to execute the initiation that provides immediate exit from the body, thanks to the power of ritual action, malltras, and meditation. 213. According to Abhinavagupta, both the samayill and purtka are entitled to recite brahmavidya. By this recitation, the dying person receives the samaya type of initiation. See TA 19 :31. 214. The meaning of the expression sapratyaya is 'with signs or with giving signs,' as, for example. a person's dead body is re-animated by the power of mantra and lifts itself, etc. 215. This is the type of initiation which, according to TA, gives hope to foolish individuals. It is described by Abhinavagupta in TA 20:2-7: The teacher, completely intent upon reciting appropriate mantras, must meditate on his right hand in the form of a triangle of fire, completely flaming, resplendent with the phoneme of fire, stirred by a wheel of winds. and must place there any seed and meditate on how it is burning, both in the hand and within his heart. In this way the seed, consumed by the heat of a multitude of \"pilaf\" mantras enlivened by the phonemes of fire \"ra,\" loses every seminal quality and is now incapable of germinating. At the same time, by virtue of this same procedure, based on the power of mantras. meditation. and rituals, the three ma/as (a~zaw1, mayiya, and karma) are also 'burned' in the sense that they are no longer in a position to furnish"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"NOTES 257 their products. This initiation, which has as its purpose the destruc-tion of the seed, was described to me by the venerable Sambhunatha in ~is benevolence. The teacher, out of mercy, can also join the seed to Siva. The initiation is, in fact, full of splendor (sudipta), and is in a position to grant liberation also to vegetable life. 216. This particular type of initiation, which reduces or eliminates the weight of a disciple, Abhinavagupta connects with the five stages of repose, that is, pragananda, udbhava, kampa, nidrti, and ghun.zi described in Chapter Five of Tantrasara. In TA 20: 14-15ab, he clarifies: \"The leap (udbhava) is due to relief, caused by an eclips-ing of the corporeal influence (dehagraha). The body is essentially constituted by the elements of earth. When the teacher, thanks to the mantra of lightness, which will be explained later, meditates on the disciple rising into the air, he loses his earthly qualities.\" Chapter Sixteen 217. As we have seen earlier, it is the aspirant's devotion to the teacher, deity, or sastras which would entitle him to receive initiation, as this devotion is perceived as a clear sign of saktipata. However, in the case of the deceased or the absent one, this is obviously impos-sible. Yet, the teacher would perform such an initiation if he could in some way infer that saktipata had descended on such a per.son. The signs of this type of saktiptita are, for example: strong feehngs that a teacher himself for some unknown reason, had for a deceased or absent soui, or the strong persistence of the family that advocated initiation. 218 · Abh i navagupta describes a procedure called 'appli~ation of the great net' (malzajjala prayoga) in some detail in TA 21: 25-45 · However, the intricacies of this procedure remain unknown because the ii ca rya would receive oral instruction from his own teacher. The purpose of this procedure was rescuing departed souls who, for one reason or another, did not received initiation during their lives. A teacher would first catch the desired soul, draw him into the net, then reinstate him into a figure made of kusa grass, which repre-sented his body, and then grant him liberation through initiation."},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"258 NOTES Chapter Seventeen 219. We have already seen that a disciple is joined to a different princi-ple in the course of initiation. To which principle one is joined will depend on the school of thought whose initiation one receives. However, according to the Trika school, other schools of thought do not possess the knowledge to enable a disciple to attain identity with Siva. Therefore, those who have received initiation into what the followers of Trika consider inferior sects should be first dis-joined or drawn away from the principles that they were joined to by the previous initiation, and then initiated again. The process of transcending the inferior doctrines is accomplished gradually through a succession of steps: the descent of grace, the removal of impurities, the desire to find the right teacher, initiation, knowl-edge, the abandonment of that which is to be avoided, immersion into that which is to be accepted, giving up the sphere of the enjoy-able, and the removal of the limitations created by a~zavamala. For details, see Chapter 22 of the Tantra/aka. 220. Abhinavagupta gives the names of the genetic mantras (sadhara~zab mantrab) in TA 22: 20. They are seven in number and their names are: pra~zava or mantra awn, mMrka, maya, vyo-mavyapl, ~a4ak~ara, bahurapa, and the eye mantra (netra). According to TA 22: 15-17a, this is what a teacher says to one who is about to embrace Saivism and receive initiation: \"This one was once a follower of other disciplines but is now inspired by your blessing; therefore bestow your grace (iaktipcita) upon him, so that this abandonment of other doctrines does not become a source of doubt for him. which will oblige him to practice rights of atone-ment. And having attained identity with you, may he quickly achieve perfection and 1 iberation.\" Chapter Eighteen 221. In TA23:3-4, Abhinavagupta explains that a spiritual guide should transmit his own power (svddhikara) to a disciple whom he thinks is at the point of being in possession of well-practiced knowledge. \"The one,'' continues Abhinavagupta, quoting Kami-kaf?ama, \"who does not possess this knowledge is not a teacher,"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"NOTES 259 even if he has been anointed and has passed through the various stages, such as samayin, etc.\" Furthermore, the only criterion for the selection of a new teacher is knowledge. Abhinavagupta writes, \"\"The teacher who creates a new teacher must therefore select an ind iv id u a I of fu 11 and perfect knowledge, without considering any other characteristic, such as place, family, conduct, and body.\" TA 23: 16b-17a. 222 · In TA 23: 31-32, Abhinavagupta describes the responsibilities of a newly consecrated teacher in the immediate period after his initia-tion. He writes: \"The new teacher, after having obtained consecra-tion, must meditate and recite the entire complex of mantras estab-1 i shed in the scriptures for a period of six months so that he becomes one with them. Having attained identity with the mantras, and having taken possession of the potency of mantra (mantra-vlrya), he finally becomes able to cut the bonds. Therefore, he should spare no effort to attain identity with the mantras.\" 223. In the Tantraloka, Abhinavagupta explains that Brahmai:is. K~atri­yas, Yaisyas, eunuchs. women, Sudras, and any other kinds of per-son desirous of initiation should be initiated without being asked their caste. However, the teacher should take this into consider-ation at the time when knowledge is imparted to them. Further-more, the teacher who is the basis of knowledge, should set seven sessions. These s~ssions are: initiation, explanation. compas~ion. friendliness, contemplation of the sastras, unification with Siva, and giving away of food, etc. See TA 23: 20b/23a. Chapter Nineteen 224. As for the purpose of this rite, Abhinavagupta writes: \"This type of initiation affects the purification of the subtle body (purya$f aka). If the purya~faka does not exist, then there is also no heaven or hell.\" TA 24:20-21. 225. The point here is that the entire procedure performed by teacher that w i 11 be described in the following I ines is performed to estab-1 ish firm conviction on the side of the ignorant ones. The entire performance by the teacher. according to Abhinavagupta. is not helpful in any way in attaining liberation. See TA 24: 15b-16a."},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"260 NOTES 226. Here begins description of fraddlzadlksti, or post-mortem initiation. Abhinavagupta discusses it in Chapter 25 of his TA based on the authority of the Siddhayogesvarlmata Tantra. This rite must be per-formed on the third, fourth, and tenth day after death, every month in the first year. After that, it should be performed once every year. 227. In TA 25: 4-6, Abhinavagupta clarifies: \"This done, the teacher must take in hand. first of all, the offering (naivedyam), and after having meditated that in this offering abides sakti of the nature of food in the form of potency instrumental in nourishing, he must conceive that the dead person for whose sake this rite is performed is penetrated by it. The bound part in the form of enjoyable of this dead disciple must then be offered by a teacher to the enjoying sub-ject in identity with him. In this way, the disciple becomes Siva.\" Chapter Twenty 228. This vague statement can only be understood if we read it along with its corresponding section of the TA, which is Chapter 26. In the beginning of this chapter, Abhinavagupta explains that all the types of initiation presented up to now, including the last sacra-ment, have as their goals purification, enjoyment. liberation. or both enjoyment and liberation. Jayaratha, in his commentary, clar-~fies that the initiation which has enjoyment (bubhuk~ub) as its aim is structured so that it is not in a position to directly grant 1 ibera-tion without first granting the fruition (of the desired enjoyments). On the other hand, the mumuk$u~1 type of initiation. such as that of a spiritual son, etc., grants liberation precisely because it is devoid of the necessity of prior fruition. Furthermore, this type of initia-tion can be either the sablja or the nirblja type. Only those who received the sablja type of initiation are expected to fol low acer-tain set of ru Jes for the rest of their Ii ves. On the other hand, those deemed incapahle of following these ru !es receive the ni rblja type of initiation, which in itself includes mantras capable of purifying the bonds of post-initiatory rules (samayaptisa). 229. Mantras should he received in the course of ritual and should be kept secret. The practitioner should attain identity with the potency of the mantra (mantravirya). without which mantras"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"NOTES 261 remain ineffective. Furthermore, mantras should be received directly from a teacher who has himself attained identity with the potency of the mantra, and not from some book. In TA26: 20-24ab, Abhinavagupta writes: \"The fundamental rule is the following: namely, the man-tric form is not to be revealed by the teacher to the dis-ciple in written form, especially in our system, which is superior to all. The mantras are of the nature of pho-nemes, and phonemes are of the nature of reflective con-sciousness. They can be transmitted to the disciple only if it is not separated from the consciousness of the teacher. Written mantras are, on the other hand, stripped of their potency and therefore unreal. Because of the conven-tional meaning which clouds them, their natural splendor doesn't manifest from books.\" However, it has been stated in the Siddlzayoge§varlrnata that those who, in spite of adopting mantras from books, attain identity with its potency, are purified by Bhairava and spontaneously initiated. \"Once mantras have been invoked,\" continues Abhinavagupta, \"it is necessary to satisfy them and propitiate them with flowers, liquor, offerings of food and incense, proportionately to the fate, devotion, and capabilities of the worshipper. The fakti, ntida, and other mantras, which are especially fer-vent, must be satisfied with liquor, meat, and blood at the beginning, and only afterwards with flowers, incense, etc.\" (TA 26:5lb-53a.) 230. The unmanifest or avyaktaliliga is one that has been spontaneously formed in nature. Among all the types of unmanifest liligas, those not made by human hand are considered to be the most excellent ones. Therefore, these types of liligas are highly recommended for the purpose of ritual worship. However, manifest, or vyakta litigas, can also be used in rituals, Abhinavagupta writes: \"The teacher can, if he wishes, install a manifest lifiga (vyakta) in the form of an image or painting found in a picture or book, made of wood, gold, or crafted by an expert and initiated artist\" (TA 27:19b-20a)."},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"262 NOTES Li1igas can be made of various materials. such as \"little stones, gems, pearls, flowers, food, clothes, and perfumed substances. Li1igas of stone created by artists, and so also those of metals, with the exception of gold ones, should be avoided\" (TA 27: 12-13). Abhinavagupta points out that various measures, given in various texts, regarding the size and shape of li1igas, and other concerns, are of little importance because: \"The li1iga which grants the desired fruit is in fact only the one that has been illuminated by mantra, animated by its noble potency\" (TA 27: 14b). 231. With the previous section, the instructions for the types of rituals that are indispensable observances (nitya) has been completed. In this section, the description of occasional observances (naimittika) begins. Abhinavagupta derives the word 'parva' from two roots: the first root, 'pr.' which means 'to fill,· is combined with the suf-fix ·van.' The other root is 'parv,' which also means 'to fill'; thus a celebration of a festival day is cal led 'parvadinam,' because on that day consciousness attains fulfillment. 232. According to the Siddhayogeivarlmata, the other name for the sacrifice of the wheel (cakraytiga) is miirtiytiga. The cakraytiga or miirtiytiga is of five types. Abhinavagupta writes: The sacrifice of the wheel is of five types, namely: soli-tary (kevala), coupled (_vamala). mixed (mi.fra), cou-pling of the wheel (cakrayuk), and mingling of heroes (vlrasalizkara). The solitary, in this context, is one in which only the teacher take part; the mixed is one in which disciples also take part. along with their wives; the coupled is of two kinds, based on whether the women who participated were wives or hired courtesans; the cou-pling of the wheel is so-called because this is the type of sacrifice associated with the wheel, which because of the unification of faktis grants all desired fruits; finally the sacrifice in which everybody participates is cal led min-gl i ng of the heroes. (TA 28: 78b-82a.) 233.

Abhinavagupta outlines the procedure applied when a teacher explains the meaning of scriptures to disciples according to Chap-ter 52 of the Devyayamala Tantra. 235. Abhinavagupta lists ten types of teachers capable of explaining the scriptures: \"'Each of these ten types of teachers has assumed a human body and possesses a particular mental disposition, but are all identical with Siva, although they are different from each other th rough knowledge and action. They are all dedicated to the scrip-tures, to worship, to the initiation rites, to sexual union, meat, and liquor. There are secondary divisions among these due to possess-ing different mental dispositions, such as tranquility (calmness), anger, or patience, etc.\" (TA 28: 391a-393.) 236. As we have seen, the spiritual teacher is worshipped in most of the other sacrifices, but in all of these instances this worship is an accessory part of the sacrifice. On the other hand, this ritual is primarily devoted to satisfying or pleasing the teacher. Chapter Twenty-One 237. In this chapter, Abhinavagupta gives a brief outline of his under-standing of the nature, meaning, and purpose of the dga~n~s or sastras. This summary is brief and cryptic, and therefore .difficult to comprehend without prior knowledge of the correspondm~ ,chap-ters of the Tantraloka, Isvarapratyablzijiiavimarsini. or Isvara-p ra tya biz ij Ii(/ vi vrtivi ma rs in i. 238. The entire universe is the expression of consciousness. ~hic.h con-sists of prak<l.fo or manifestation, and vimarsa, which is the knowledge of prakdsa in its collective and particular aspects. In a narrower sense, this vimarsa is language, which takes the form of the various ligamas. 239. In the last three chapters of his TA, Abhinavagupta discusses the nature of the sastras or agamas at length. The title of Chapter 35 is"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"264 NOTES 'The Union of all the Sastras.' In it, Abhinavagupta presents his vision that brings together the great variety of agamic texts. both Hindu and non-Hindu. In his analysis. he grants all of them the status of being authoritative or being a valid means of gaining knowledge (pramti!Ja). However, he arranges them in a hierarchi-cal order, placing the Trika sastras at the apex. 240. For Abhinavagupta, there is only one agama from which all the others emerge. This broad acceptance of all sastras requires him to attempt a reconciliation of their differences. In order to accom-plish this, he points out that all of them bring about the promised fruit. In this way, Sarhkhya gives to its follower the knowledge to discriminate between puru~a and prak[!i. Similarly. the follower of Buddhism attains the buddhi tattva, but only the Trika grants full and complete liberation to those who are entitled (adhikari). For Abhinavagupta. an adhikari is one who possesses firm faith in a given agama. Another question that arises here is: if it is true that all tigamas emerge from one and the same source. then why is it necessary to perform a ritual of conversion, such as 'reclamation of liliga' (lifigouddhtira)? Abhinavagupta explains: In the body of one single doctrine, as for example, in the Vedas, it happens that its followers, in order to attain to superior degrees or ranks. must submit to special rites of purification. The same thing can be said in regard to our tradition, as for example. in the case of the reclama-tion of the liliga, etc. In other words, in the way in which one belonging to a lower asrama cannot enjoy the fruits which come from the upper tisrama, in the same way. a follower of the Pancaratras, etc., cannot attain the iden-tity with Siva. (TA 35:28-29.) 241. In TA 35: lb-2a, Ahhinavagupta defines prasiddhi as a type of knowledge that is necessarily based in an omniscient knowing sub-ject and is the basis of all human activity."},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"Bibliography Original Sanskrit Texts Kamikagama, Piirvablzaga.

Abhinavagupta's Commentary on the Bhagavad Gita (Gitartha-samgraha) US Edition Translated with notes by Boris Marjanovic Abhinavagupta lived in Kashmir in northern India at the end of the 10(11 century and begin-ning of the 11th century. He was a brilliant scholar and is considered the greatest genius of India in the fields of philosophy, aesthetics, poetics and dramaturgy. He was also a profoundly accomplished Tantric practitioner and the most influential teacher of what is now called Kashmir Shaivism. Although he was a prolific writer, to date few of his surviving works have been made available in English. In this commentary, Abhinavagupta explains that he composed it because he felt that his predecessors had not understood the eso-teric or secret meaning of the Bhagavad Gita. In contrast, Abhina-vagupta's work explores the very essence of the teaching of the Gita. This unique interpretation of the Bhagavad Gita in the con-text of the non-dualistic philosophy of Kashmir Shaivism reveals a new dimension of the message of the Gita and describes the prac-tice of the secret yoga at its core. $24.95 us 378 pages ISBN 978-0-915801-93-0 www.rudrapress.com"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"KASH.),,.\\IR 9A1Vl5i\\·\\ !\"1-. ...... t~-·-··!\"\\--.. .. •-•••ld...1 H1..h• Kashmir Saivism: The Central Philosophy of Tantrism By Kamalakar Mishra Although the contribution of Tantra to Indian philosophy and culture is of immense signifi-cance, very little work has been done in the field to date.
