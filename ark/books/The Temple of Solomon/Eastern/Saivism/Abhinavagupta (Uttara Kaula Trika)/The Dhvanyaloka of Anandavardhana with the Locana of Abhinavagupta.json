The inception was an annotated translation by J. M. Masson of the First Chapter of the Dkvanyäloka and the Locano., a work carried out in the Department of Sanskrit and Indian Studies at Harvard University. As Chairman of the Department at that time, I read it and approved it as Masson’s doctoral thesis, Harvard, 1970. Later, Dr. Masson spent two years in India, much of it in study under Professor M. V. Patwardhan. With Patwardhan he completed a translation of the remaining chapters. Of that translation the brief Chapter Four was published in the Journal of the American Oriental Society 97 (1977), pp. 285-304, 423-440. The complete translation was offered for publication to the Harvard Oriental Series. As editor of the Series, I stated that two major alterations would Erst be necessary. The separate parts, Änanda’s and Abhinava’s, must be integrated; and the quotations of poetry in both parts must be rendered into verse, not prose. I was asked if I would be willing to make these alterations myself and any others that I saw Et.I accepted the request and have spent what my colleagues must have thought an unconscionable time in fulfilling it. I have altered the origi­nal considerably. What is wholly my responsibility is the Introduction, the verse translations, the indices, and large sections of the notes. In the notes when it seemed necessary, as in the expression of opinions, to make a distinction, the first personal pronoun singular is used to refer to Ingalls (for example, “I believe,” “It seems to me”); the plural pronoun refers to a consensus. In the notes on Chapter Three several long passages are given verbatim from the written communications of Patwardhan. They are indicated by his name in parentheses. As for the prose translations of the texts, while I have altered the wording throughout, the substance remains basically that of Masson and Pat­wardhan."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"ForewordAfter these changes had been made, preliminary drafts of Chapter One and portions of Chapter Two, and later the finished version of the Introduction were sent to Patwardhan. Several alterations have been made in Chapters One and Two as a result of Patwardhan’s comments. In the Introduction nothing has been changed, but I have added a long note (note 42) dealing with a matter which Patwardhan regarded as important. Shortly before going to press there came the sad news of Professor Patwardhan’s death, which will be felt by all Sanskritists as a major loss to their field of study.As the basis of our translation we have used the edition published as Volume 135 of the Kashi Sanskrit Series, The Dhvanyäloka of Sri Änandavardhanächarya with the Lochana and Bälapriyä Commentaries (Benares: Chowkhambâ Sanskrit Series Office, 1940). The edition is not without faults, as may be seen from the Corrections of the Kashi Text at the end of this book, but its text of the Locana is better than that of the NS edition and it is the only edition which contains the invaluable Bälapriyä commentary on the Locana.An effort has been made to explain technical terms the first time they occur. If we have delayed an explanation by inadvertence, or if the reader has forgotten it, he may consult the general index, where he will find a reference to the passage where the explanation occurs.In the translation, verse quotations from scientific works (éâstros) are usually rendered in prose; so also always the Kärikäs of the Dhvanyä­loka. Verse quotations from literature (kävya), on the other hand, are rendered, with a very few exceptions, into unrhymed verse.The breaking up of the commentarial matter on many Kärikäs into sections (for example, 1.13 a, b, c,) is in order to keep the two commen­taries ( Vrtti and Locana) close to each other and close to the footnotes for ease of cross-reference. Likewise for ease of cross-reference, quota­tions and pratikas of the Dhvanyäloka which occur in the Locana are printed in boldface.The process of production was more complicated than I had at first envisaged.

The first has been known for many centuries as the Dhvanyâloka, or “Light on [the Doctrine of] Suggestion,\" and has been ascribed to Räjänaka Änandavardhana, a Kashm iri author of the ninth century a.d. The fact that this was not the original title of the work and the fact that many scholars have recently claimed, I think wrongly, that Änanda wrote only the Vrtti or prose portion of it, are matters of which I shall speak later. The second text is a commentary on the first, called the Locano, or “The Eye,” composed in about A.D. 1000 by another Kashmiri, the critic, philosopher, and Saiva mystic, Abhi- navagupta. These two texts have proven over the centuries to be the most influential works of India on the theory and practice of literary criticism. For the last thousand years all Indian critics of Sanskrit, and many even of those who have written on the literatures of India’s mod­ern languages, have studied their doctrine, if not directly from the texts themselves, at least through the rendering of Mammata. Even when an author has disagreed with their pronouncements he has treated these works with honor and has taken pains to answer their point of view in establishing such other doctrines as he might favor.How did Änanda’s view of literature arise? I use this general phrase because, as will soon be clear, the doctrine of dhvani, of suggestion or suggestiveness in literature, forms only a part of it. And what is there about his view and about Abhinava’s commentary on it that placed these works in such a magisterial position? In this Introduction I shall try to answer these questions, steering a course between the generalities of brevity and a full-scale exposition, which would be nothing less than a history of Indian aesthetics.As both Änanda and Abhinava were Kashmiris and drew heavily on Kashmiri traditions of scholarship, it is to that northern province of India that we should look for the historical background of their works."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"2IntroductionKashmir in the narrow sense is a small valley ringed in by the immense ranges of the Himalaya and Karakoram mountains. The floor of the valley, some eighty by twenty miles in extent, lies a mile above sea level and is watered by the Jhelum River, which twists its way northwestward into the Wular Lake, issuing westward from which it breaks through the mountain barrier. The soil of the valley, helped by winter snows and spring rains, is fertile. In those brief periods when the valley was well governed and when measures were taken to prevent annual flooding, both produce and population rose to a high level, permitting the kings of Kashmir to extend their sway well beyond the narrow li its of their homeland.The first of our two authors lived toward the end of the longest period of strong government that Kashmir ever enjoyed, a period in which for once this little valley played a major role in the political history, of Asia. This strong Kashmir was the achievement of two long-reigning kings of the Karkota dynasty: Lalitäditya, “the World Conqueror”(reg. A.D. 725-761), and his grandson, JayäpTda, the great patron of lit­erature (reg. A.D. 776-807). Kalhana’s Râjataranginï gives a delightful account of their reigns, mixing history with the romantic adventures of folk tales. As the reader may follow the account in Sir Aurel Stein’s edition and translation of the Râjataranginï, I shall limit myself to selecting the few items which are strictly to my purpose.In A.D. 732 or 733 King Lalitäditya borrowed from the Bhütesa Tem­ple ten million dinnäras to finance an expedition to the south. The goal of his expedition was King Yasovarman of Kanauj, who controlled through feudatory rights the Punjab and most of the Ganges valley. In 733, the date perhaps being confirmed by a solar eclipse,1 at the confluence of the Jumna and the Ganges, 700 miles as the crow flies from where he had set forth, Lalitäditya met with and defeated his1 The Gaûdavaho, a Prakrit poem describing the victories of Yaiovarman, contains a passage (vss. 827-832) mentioning various portents, including a solar eclipse, which occurred just before Yaéovarman’s “[royal] position became suddenly weakened\" (khana-nivvadia-niyaya-paya-bhaiige = ksana-nirurtta-nijafkaj-pada-bhange). Such is the reading of three of the four manuscripts of the poem as edited in the Bombay Sanskrit and Prakrit Series, No. 34, second ed., 1927; see Introduction, p. cclvii. Hermann Jacobi took this weakening of the royal position to refer to Yasovarman's defeat at Prayäga by Lalitäditya ( Gott. Gel. Anz. 1888, II, pp. 67-68). A total eclipse of the sun would have been visible from Prayäga (Allahabad) in a.d. 733. But the reading of the latest edition of the Gaûdavaho (Prakrit Text Society, Ahmedabad, 1975), khana-nivadia-bhûlaà-bhanga-bhanguràpânge, eliminates the “weakening of the royal position.”"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Introduction3enemy. A temporary peace seems to have been arranged, for in 736 we find that Lalitäditya’s ambassador to the Chinese emperor apparently refers to Yasovarman as Lalitäditya's ally.2 Meanwhile Lalitäditya had advanced eastward to raid the former adherents of Yasovarman in Ma- gadha and Bengal. Before 740 the peace was broken, Yasovarman was rooted out of his kingdom, and the revenues of his capital city of Kanauj were given to a temple of the Sun in Kashmir.3 Lalitäditya, who was now the paramount ruler of northern India, repaid the Bhüteéa Temple 110,000,000 dinnâras for the 10,000.000 that he had borrowed.The World Conqueror spent the last twenty years of his reign found­ing cities and religious institutions in the valley of Kashmir and in expeditions against his northern neighbors, the Dards, Tibetans, and Turks. On the second day of Caitra (April/May) of an unspecified year he won a great victory over the Turks. Three centuries later the Arab traveler Alberimi reports that in Kashmir this victory was still the oc­casion of an annual celebration. The nationalist pride which Kashmiris felt in' the victories of their king is reflected in the boast of Kalhana:4The rulers of many lands to this very day wear symbols of their defeat, which the fierce king forced them to adopt. Clearly it is by his command that the Turks, to show that they had been enslaved, still walk with their hands held behind their backs and wear their heads half shaved, while he forced the rulers of the South, in token of their having been reduced to the state of beasts, to wear a tail to' their dhotis, which reach to the ground.The World Conqueror ended his days on an expedition across “the ocean of sand,” that is to say, in what is now either Russian or Chinese Turkestan, in quest of further glory. After the brief reign of his two sons, he was succeeded by a grandson, Jayâpïda, whom his tutors, following the dying instructions of the World Conqueror, had constantly urged to “be like your grandfather.”Jayâpïda, as soon as he reached the throne, attempted to follow their advice. He too gathered a force for a great southern conquest. Fate turned against him at Benares, where most of his troops deserted. But by reckless bravery the young king retrieved his fortune. He allied himself with the king of Bengal, whose daughter he married. In the3 Stein, R&j. T. I. p. 89, with reference to Chavannes and Lévy, JA 1895, p. 353.

Then at the entrance to his homeland he defeated a usurper who had arisen in his absence.We are told that after his return Jayäplda became a great patron of learning, attracting so many scholars to his court that there came to be a dearth of wise men in other kingdoms. Kalhana lists many of the scholars and poets whom the king brought into his service. Among them was the grammarian Kslra, from whom the king himself took lessons (Râj.T. 4.489). The person meant is doubtless Kslrasvämin, the well-known commentator on the Amarakosa and the Nirukta. “The king engaged Bhattodbhata as his sabhäpati at a salary of a lakh [of diiinâras] a day and made the poet Dämodaragupta, the author of the Kuttanimata, his chief minister” {Râj.T. 4.495-6). I shall have more to say below of Bhattodbhata, or Udbhata as he is now generally known, for his influence on Änanda and the Dhvanyäloka was great. The min­ister Dämodara was perhaps the most original of classical Sanskrit po­ets. That may be why his work later fell out of fashion. Fortunately nearly the whole of it has now been recovered.5 Among other minis­ters is mentioned Vämana, doubtless the poetician quoted in our texts, and among other poets is mentioned Manoratha {Râj.T. 4.497), whom Abhinava identifies as the author of a verse opposed to the doctrine of dhvani, quoted by Änanda (1.1 c A). Finally, we are told that the king, having dreamed that the sun was rising in the west, was happy to re­alize that the Buddhist scholar Dharmottara had entered his kingdom (4.498).6 This will explain how Ananda came to write a commen­tary, as Abhinava tells us (3.47 L and see note 6), on Dharmottara’s Pramânaviniscayatïkâ. The man had been the leading Buddhist scholar in the kingdom in the generation previous to Ànanda’s.’ The frame story, which gives the title to the work (‘The Bawd’s Advice”), can be likened to several other Sanskrit works, but the emboxed stories are su» generis. The combination of comic and tragic in the tale of Häralatä and Sundarasena is against all the classical conventions of rasa. The tale is told by the bawd with an explicitly cynical purpose, but i it the death of Häralatä will break the reader’s heart. D&modara’s is the only example I know of in Sanskrit of this double attack on the reader’s sensibilities.* The works of Dharmottara were not yet known to the West when Stein wrote his translation of the Râj.T. (1900). Stcherbatsky’s edition of the NyâyabinduSkâ was published only in 1909. This explains Stein's misunderstanding of the passage, where he failed to see that dharmottara was a proper name. As for the sun rising in the west, Dharmottara, like most visitors to Kashmir, would have entered the valley through one of the western passes of the Himalaya."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Introduction5It was under King Jayäplda that the school of literary criticism in Kashmir originated. The sabhä to which Udbhata was appointed as director (pati) was doubtless a panditasabhâ rather than a political body. One might therefore translate Udbhata’s title approximately as Director of the Royal Academy. His salary, by the way, was not so immense as it sounds. The dinnära (the word derives ultimately from the Roman denarius) had become by this time a money of account, of less worth than the smallest coin. A lakh of diiinäras in Jayâpïda’s reign would have equalled approximately twenty-five silver rupees of Akbar’s mintage (Stein, Vol. II, p. 323), a princely but not a fabulous daily retainer.It is pertinent to our understanding of Änanda and Abhinava to in­quire what materials were available for the teaching and research of such an academy, or to the individual scholars who might compose it. To judge from the quotations and references in the Dhvanyäloka and Locano, Kashmiri critics of their time had access to all the epic mate­rial and most of the early classical material that we now possess. A few works that are now standard in a library of classical authors are absent—those of Asvaghosa, as one might expect, and more surpris­ingly the Bhattikävya and the plays of Bhavabhüti—but not many. On the other hand, they had much that we have now lost.7 In addition they were acquainted with a substantial literature in Prakrit, most of which is now lost. The only two works in this category quoted by Änanda which have come down to us are the Sattasaï and the Gaûda- vaho. These account for only about a fourth of his quotations.8While the Kashmiri critic thus had access to a substantial library of Sanskrit and Prakrit literature, his library of literary criticism, in the early years of its development in Kashmir, was extremely modest. It consisted of little more than the eighth-century works of Bhämaha and Dandin. There existed also the ancient manual of the theater, the Bhâratïyanâtyasôstra (BhNÉ), but until Udbhata turned his attention to it, this work had played almost no part in general literary criticism.7 Of Änanda’s 131 Sanskrit literary quotations, we still possess the originals of 59, to which one may add 29 more that may still be found in anthologies of later date, in reworkings (the Hanumannâtaka), or in the work of later literary critics. This leaves 41 for which our only source is Änanda.' To be precise, 10 out of 39. Seven verses, not counted in the 10, may be found in the supplement to Weber’s edition of the Sattasaï, but they most probably found their way into the manuscript sources of the supplement from the Dhvanyäloka."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"IntroductionBhämaha and Dandin had spent most of their effort in defining and exemplifying the figures of speech, a science which they had developed to a point comparable to what the West has to offer in the Greek of Demetrius or the Latin of the Rhetorica ad Herennium. Beyond that, they had listed the faults and the good qualities (punas) of poetry and had spoken of its different styles (ritis). But what they had to say on these subjects suffers from two serious weaknesses. The qualities are so general that they offer no operable criteria of what is great or beautiful in poetry and what is not. The three primary qualities were given as sweetness (mädhurya). clarity (prasäda), and strength (ojas). How is one to say when a stanza, much less a whole poem, is sweet and when it is not, or how judge whether it has strength? In an effort to render the qualities more precise, Bhämaha and Dandin made the error of identifying them with measurable elements of phonetics and structure. Thus, a large number of retroflex consonants and consonant clusters and the use of many long compounds were said to exhibit strength. The modest use of compounds and the avoidance of harsh phonetic combinations gave sweetness. No better was the attempt to associate these qualities with regional differences. The sweet style was associated with Vidarbha in the Deccan, the harsh or strong style with Bengal. A third style, PäncälT. fell aesthetically and geographically somewhere in between.Such concepts and associations died hard. Not until Änanda was it pointed out that long compounds are not really necessary for strength (Dhv. 2.9). In fact Vämana, who belonged to the first generation of Kashmiri criticism, if anything exaggerated and worsened these early faults. He extended the number of qualities to ten and defined each as of two sorts, depending on whether it was viewed as a quality of sound or a quality of meaning. Unfortunately his new qualities, such as samatä (regularity), saukumärya (delicacy), and känti (brilliance), are as vague and as difficult to define as the original three. It is these qualities, he said, which give beauty to a poem, a beauty which may then be enhanced by the use of figures of speech (Vämana 3.1.1-2). He continued the old association of certain qualities with regional styles and so came to the dictum for which he is chiefly remembered, “Style is the soul of poetry” (rîtir ätmä kävyasya, Vämana 1.2.6).While Vämana, who may well have come from some older center of literary studies outside Kashmir, looked backward for his inspiration, Udbhata, whose name indicates that he was a native Kashmiri, may be said to have looked forward. We know that he wrote a commentary,"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Introduction7unfortunately now lost, on the BhNS. It was the first of a series of commentaries on that work that were to be written in Kashmir in the following two centuries, by Lollaia, by éankuka, and by Abhinavagupta. The importance of this new inter t is inestimable, for as we shall see, it was by bringing Bharata’s doctrine of the rasas, the flavors or moods of a theatrical piece, into a general theory of literature that Änanda arrived at a critique which finally could furnish workable criteria of literary excellence.9Fate has been unkind to the works of Udbhata. His other great com­mentary, the Bhamahavivarana, is also for all practical purposes lost to us. What appear to be minute fragments of it, written on birch- bark in a hand of the ninth to eleventh century, have been lovingly reconstructed by the Italian scholar Raniero Gnoli. But while Gnoli makes out a persuasive case for Udbhata’s authorship of these frag­ments, even if his case were fully proved none of them is of sufficient continuity to furnish evidence for the new ideas which Udbhata must have propounded in that work. We know that it did contain new ideas. Ananda and Abhinava ascribe to it, for example, the doctrine that the beauty of particular words depends on the rasa that the author wishes to achieve (see 3.16 m A and L). This would be a major step toward their critique. Jacobi goes so far as to say that “Udbhata was the first to designate rasa as the soul of poetry” (ZDMG 56, p. 396). But this is saying too much. The verse on which Jacobi based his statement is not by Udbhata at all, but by some unknown, and doubtless later, author quoted by Udbhata’s commentator Induraja.10 What is true, rather, is that Udbhata was the first of the literary critics to concern himself seriously with the concept of rasa. He was not prepared, however, to make it the chief goal of poetry, as Änanda was to do.The only book of Udbhata’s that we possess in readable form is the Kävyälankärasärasangraha, “A Compendium of the Most Important9 The older poeticians had been aware of rasa, but had not shown what I should call much interest in the subject. Both Bhämaha and Dandin relegated examples of it to the rasädi figures of speech (rasavadalankära, preyo 'lankära, ürjasvin), figures where they found the emotions (bhävas) to be strongly or strikingly expressed.10 The verse runs: rasâdyadhisthitam kâvyam jîvadrüpatayà yatah / kathyate tad rasädtnäm kävyätmatvam vyavasthitam / / It occurs in Induräja's commentary on Udbhata's definition of kävyahetu (6.7; in the numeration of the Viinti 6.14). That it is not by Udbhata is clearly indicated by the words with which Induraja introduces it: tad ähuk The error in identification originated with Col. Jacob, JA OS 1897, p. 847, and has been corrected by P. V. Kane, HSP, p. 128."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"IntroductionFigures of Speech in Poetry.” This little work furnishes definitions of forty-one figures, which are then illustrated in verses narrating the story of the Kumârasambhava up to the point reached by Kälidäsa in the fifth canto of his poem on the same subject. Many of the definitions are the same as those of Bhämaha. But we should not let that fact obscure Udbhata’s innovations. In the definition of the very first figure of sense, rüpaka (1.11 Induräja, 1.21 Vivrti), we meet with a distinction that was new to Sanskrit poetics and that was destined ultimately to transform the analysis of all the figures. This is the distinction between the furnishing of a meaning srutya, that is, explicitly, and furnishing it arthena, that is, by the power of the contexual facts, or implicitly. The same distinction appears in the analysis of simile (1.16 Induräja, 1.33 Vivrti). Thus rüpaka (metaphor)11 differs from simile by the fact that the similarity between the superimposed object and its real base is always given arthena, is “understood” from context, whereas in simile it is given by sruti, that is, usually by an explicit word (e.g., iva, yathä = “like,” “as”) expressing the fact that the similarity is shared.This concern with the implications of words appears in many of Udbhata’s definitions. In dïpaka (zeugma), for example, the paired properties are said to contain or imply a simile. Thus, where a poet writes that “the doom of autumn carried off the beauty of the kadamba flowers and all the joy of damsels separated from their lovers,” he is suggesting an implicit similarity between the beauty of the flowers and the joy of the damsels. To follow the concern for the implied or sug­gested sense through the whole of Udbhata’s book would require a more detailed exposition than is justified in this Introduction. It ap­pears in his definitions of paryäyokta, aprastutaprasamsâ, sandeha, and elsewhere.“ Rüpaka is not what a Greek would have called metaphor, but that translation has come to be used by every Sanskritist. Rüpaka is actually a simile in which the particle of assimilation has been omitted, e.g., “her moon face, her cherry lip.” In a Greek metaphor the object as well as the particle is missing: “her stars shone upon my face,\" meaning that her eyes looked at me. The distinction is noted by Gero Jenner, Die poetische Figuren der Inder, p. 68, Ludwig Apfel Verlag, Hamburg, 1968."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Pratïhâra Induräja, who commented on Udbhata’s book some time after Änanda’s Dhvanyäloka had become popular,12 concludes his com­mentary with a disquisition on why Udbhata had nothing to say of dhvani, \"which some connoisseurs [i.e., Änanda and his followers] con­sider to be the very life of poetry.” His answer, in brief, is that Udbhata included dhvani in his treatment of the figures of speech. The answer is not strictly true but it points the way to an important truth. Udbhata nowhere uses the word dhvani. He speaks of a meaning’s being un­derstood (pratïyamâna), or implied (gamyate), or of its being included (antargata) in another meaning, but he avoids using the more technical terms vyajyate or dhvanyate for “is suggested.” His avoidance cannot have been because he did not know the use of the words in this sense, for his contemporary Manoratha laughs at critics of the time “who will tell you with delight that a poem is full of dhvani but cannot tell you just what this dhvani is” (Dhv. 1.1c A). Perhaps Udbhata wished to dis­tance himself from the new enthusiasts and to keep as far as possible to the old terminology of criticism. But Induräja’s remark is justi­fied to this extent: Udbhata was fully aware of that type of semantic operation that Änanda was later to call suggestiveness (vyanjakatva, dhvani) and of the importance to poetry of the suggestions which it could bring about. One might fairly say that in Udbhata’s mind the two main building blocks of Änanda’s critique, rasa and dhvani, were present, the first consciously, the second perhaps only subconsciously. But the blocks had not yet been built into a system.It is said that in his old age King Jayäplda became ruthless in the exaction of taxes, oppressing both his peasants and the brahmins. He died after ruling for thirty-one years and was succeeded by a number of worthless descendants. For nearly fifty years Kashmir fell back into its habitual state of misrule. Then in a.d. 855/856 a strong-willed minister set up a young man of a collateral line, Avantivarman, who was to rule for nearly three decades. King Avantivarman was descended from Ut- pala, an uncle of Jayâpïda’s daughter-in-law, whence the new dynasty has come to be known as the Utpala Dynasty. Avantivarman and his minister Süra brought the treasury back to solvency. They installed major works of drainage and irrigation. Once more the king became resplendent through the poets who graced his court. Kalhana gives us the names of four of them (Räj.T. 5.34): Muktäkana, Sivasvämin,13 P. V.

Of Änandavardhana it is now time to speak.Of Änandavardhana’s life, beyond the fact that he was patronized by King Avantivarman, we know nothing except what can be inferred from his two extant works and their colophons. From these it appears that he was the son of Nona (Devisataka 101) and that he bore the title Räjänaka (Dhv. 4 Conclusion A and note 3). Nothing is known of Nona. The title denotes no political position and probably implies no more than that he was given a stipend by the king.Änanda was the author of many books. In the Dhvanyâloka he refers to two earlier works, which are now lost: the Arjunacarita, “The Adven­tures of Arjuna”; and the Visamabänaliiä, “The Sports of the Bowman Love.” The first of these was evidently a Sanskrit mahäkävya. Änanda tells us (3.10-14 e A) that he altered the traditional account of Arjuna’s life so as to include new material of his own invention on Arjuna’s ad­ventures in the underworld. Abhinava quotes one stanza (3.25 L) of the poem, written in an unpleasing meter of unrelieved iambs, but it would be unfair to judge the work as a whole from one accidental quotation.Of the Visamabänaliiä we can say somewhat more. We are given four quotations from it and several remarks about its subject matter. The quotations show that it was written in Mähärästrl Prakrit. It may have been in the form of a play (or a narrative work would be possible), for 3.15 A refers to “the scene where the God of Love meets with his friends [Youth and Springtime) in my Visamabänaliiä.\" The purpose of the work, however, was to give instruction in poetry. In speaking of the variety which may be achieved by handling an insentient object as if it were sentient, Änanda remarks, “This is a well-known proce­dure of great poets and has been described in detail for the instruction of poets in the Visamabänaliiä' (4.7 A). I believe we can be more specific. The quotations which we have from the work exhibit vari­ous types of suggestiveness. The stanza at 2.1 b .4 exemplifies arthän- tarasankramitaväcyadhvani-, that at 2.27 b A is of alankäradhvani. Con­cerning the verse quoted by Abhinava there may be some question as to the precise type of dhvani intended (see 3.15 L and notes), but it is certainly dhvani that is being illustrated. I would say, then, that the Visamabänaliiä was Änanda’s first work propounding the new doctrine of suggestiveness, in a play or narrative written quite appropriately in"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"IntroductionPrakrit, for Prakrit was the language in which this style of suggestive­ness first became popular and it may well have been from Prakrit that Änanda’s interest in dhvani was first stimulated. The work was most certainly not an anthology, as Sten Konow once suggested.13 14Änanda also wrote on philosophy. Abhinava twice refers (1.4 b L and4.5 L) to a work of Änanda’s called the Tattvâloka, which from the context of the references seems to have dealt with both metaphysics and literature. Again, Änanda himself speaks of his intention to write a book which would examine the doctrines of the Buddhists (3.47 A). Commenting on this passage, Abhinava tells us that the book to which Änanda refers was his Dharmottarivivrti,1* an “explanation” of Dhar- mottara’s commentary ( tïkâ) on the Pramânaviniscaya of DharmakTrti. Although the underlying texts here of DharmakTrti and Dharmottara are preserved, at least in Tibetan translations (see 3.47 L, note 6), Änanda’s Vivrti. .like the Tattvâloka, seems to be irretrievably lost.15 It is perhaps natural that Änanda should have chosen Dharmottara as representative of the Buddhist viewpoint, for Dharmottara had taught his doctrine in Kashmir under the recent reign of King JayäpTda. But it is unusual for a devout Hindu to have written on such abstruse points of Buddhist epistemology and metaphysics as Änanda must have found in the Pramânamniscayadharmottari.Änanda was indeed a devout Hindu, as appears from the stanza quoted at 3,43 b A and from the Devisataka, a poem that has been published in the KM Series (ninth gucchaka). The poem consists of 103 trick stanzas (yamakas and citrabandhas) in praise of the mother goddess. It culminates in a sort of crossword puzzle, a great wheel, the spokes of which are formed by sixteen stanzas, the outer rim by four other stanzas the syllables of which interlock with the spokes. The se­cret of the puzzle lies in an “inner rim\" which gives the message: “The son of Nona has thus performed his worship of the Goddess under the13 Räjasekhara's Karpüramanjan, HOS Voi. 4. p. 193.14 The statements of Kane (HSP, p. 194) and Jacobi (ZDMG 57, p. 328, note 9) axe based on the incorrect reading of the KM edition of the Locano. The correct reading is inmjcayatikäyäm dharmottaryäm, not dharmottamâyâm.15 Änanda seems to have written still other books which are now lost. At least, that is what I infer from the scatter verses of his own which he quotes in the Dhv. Some of these verses, like the courtly stanza on his mistress’s face (2.27a A) and the stanza on discouragement (3.40 a A), may be occasional verses (mttktakas) which never belonged to any larger collection. But others, such as the punning benedictions to Krishna and to the Sun God (2.21 f A), or to RukminI (2.21 b A), would seem by their nature to have introduced major works."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"12Introductiontitle of ‘The Goddess’s Century,’ as instructed in a dream, a worship unsurpassed by reason of her having been the instructress.”For suggestions as to why Änanda chose to write this citrakävya in praise of the Goddess when he casts such scorn on this type of composition in the Dhvanyâloka, I refer the reader to my forthcoming essay on the Devîsataka in the Ernest Bender felicitation volume. I shall here remark only on the fact that the yamakas of the poem are musical and the citrabandhas extremely clever. If one may speak of better or worse citrakävyas, the Devîsataka must rank with the better.In the Vrtti of the Dhvanyâloka Änanda proves himself one of the great prose stylists of Sanskrit literature. No matter how delicate or complex the subject, he is always clear. He varies his expression, so that no matter how often he comes back to the importance of rasa and dhvani he seems never to repeat himself or become tedious, while the rhythm of his sentences gives constant delight. In comparison with his prose, his verses for the most part are disappointing. They go against his own advice by being too consciously clever. But I make exception of the noble stanza which he gives us at 3.43 b A. I should like to think that it represents his view of his life and of his life’s work.I am weary from much painting of the world,for although I used the new and wondrous sight of poetswhich busies itself in giving taste to feelingand used the insight of philosopherswhich shows us objects as they really are,I never found, 0 God recumbent on the Ocean, a joy like that which comes from love of Thee.It is for the content of the so-called Dhvanyâloka. however, rather than as a poet or a master of prose style, that Änanda has become famous. As regards the original title of his great work, one should note that none of the manuscripts gives it the name of Dhvanyâloka.16 The colophons of the manuscripts refer to it usually as Sahrdayâloka, “A Light for Connoisseurs”; sometimes as Sahrdayahrdayäloka, “A Light for the Hearts of Connoisseurs” ; and rarely as Kävyäloka, “A Light on Poetry.” The oldest commentator on the text whose work has survived, Abhinavagupta, refers to his commentary as the Sahrdayälokalocana, “An Eye for the Sahrdayâloka,”17 and this is the title found in the colophons of the first three chapters of his commentary in the printed*\" See Kane, HSP, p. 181, and Krishnamoorthy’s edition, p. 36, note 4.17 The references are noted by Kane HSP, p. 170, note 1."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Introduction13editions. The colophon of the fourth chapter, which derives from a sep­arate manuscript tradition, gives the name of the work as Kävyäloka-18 In the absence of a critical edition of Ananda’s great work19 the colo­phon readings may not be decisive, but the weight of Abhinava’s tes­timony when added to their evidence seems to clinch the matter. The name which Ànanda gave to his work, I believe, was Sahrdayäloka.The Sahrdayäloka, then, to give it that title, opens with a spirited defense of suggestion as an independent semantic power. As I have indicated, the subject of suggestion was not a new one. It had occupied the thoughts of Udbhata. The term dhvani that Änanda uses had been laughed at by Manoratha. An important stimulus to discussion, it seems to me, must have been the Prakrit literature which formed an important part of Kashmiri critical studies. The Erst Eve quotations in Änanda’s opening defense cire all taken from Prakrit. The reason is not far to seek. If we look at the verses of the Sattasai, we see that it is suggestion upon which the effect of almost every stanza depends. The gäthä stanza, in which they are written, is so brief a poetic form that it could scarcely attain a powerful effect by any other means. Such verses lend themselves naturally to the thesis which Änanda set out to defend.To understand the argument we must cast a brief glance at the tra­ditional Indian theories of meaning into which the new doctrine was introduced. These theories had been developed over a long period of time by the grammarians and the ritualists (Mlmämsakas). The Buddhists too, in the writings of Dignäga and Dharmakïrti, had had their say. It was generally agreed that words had two sorts of seman­tic power: the power of direct denotation (abhidhä) and a secondary power of indirect indication (gunavrtti, bhakti, upacära, laksanä).20 By denotation, a particular group of phonemes in a particular order, say g-au-h, (“ox\"), denotes an animal with horns, hump and tail. But when one says gaur vähikah, “the Punjabi is an ox,” meaning that the man is stupid, it is the secondary power that is working in the word. The secondary power may be elicited by a common property of two objects, as in the example just quoted, or it may be elicited by some other relation\" for example that of possessor with the thing possessed, as in“ S. K. De, The Text of the Kävyälokalocana IV, p. 265.l® Krishnamoorthy’s edition is helpful, for he gives the variants of a South Indian MS from Moodabidre as well as of the NSP MSS and occasionally of other MSS from the BORI. But there exist many manuscripts about which he is silent.30 For the distinctive uses of the Sanskrit terms see 1.1 K. note 2."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"14Introductionnagaram pravisanti kuntâh, “the spears enter the city,\" meant is spearmen.21In addition to these two powers, the school of ritualists founded by Kumärila held that there existed a third power which furnished a “final meaning\" to the sentence as a whole. They called this the tätparyasakti, and defended its reality against their opponents, the Präbhäkara rit­ualists, who claimed that the denotative force in each word kept on operating until at the conclusion of the sentence it worked automati­cally in harmony with the other words.These three powers left no room for what Änanda considered to be of all semantic powers the most valuable for poetic expression, a power which in its most general aspect he calls vyanjakatva, the power of suggestion, or, more literally, the power of revelation (as of a lamp which reveals the objects upon which it casts its light). He cadis this power dhvani when it is in its purest form, that is, when it predominates over the other semantic powers in the sentence. He begins the proof of its existence by a number of humorous examples. The suggestion may be of an act that is the very opposite of what is denoted. One of his examples is this (1.4c A):Mother-in-law sleeps here, I there; look, traveler, while it is light.For at night when you cannot see, you must not fall into my bed.What is denoted here is a prohibition. There is obviously no secondary operation of metaphor or the like in the stanza. The tätparyasakti, if such there be, merely conveys the syntax of the sentence. The syntax is still impeccable if we take the statement as a prohibition. And yet we know, as the traveler must have known, that the prohibition is unintended and that the woman speaking is inviting him to sleep with her.By the use of examples Änanda builds up a typology of suggestion. The type to which the example just given belongs he calls avivaksita- väcya, suggestion “where the denoted sense is unintended.” The type has two varieties. In the variety just exemplified the denoted sense is atyantatiraskrta, “entirely set aside.” The second variety is where the31 In a rough way one may say that a secondary meaning in Sanskrit corresponds to the Greco-Latin •trope”; but only in a rough way, because several of the tra­ditional Greco-Latin tropes (e.g., hyperbole, allegory) are treated by the Sanskrit poeticians as figures of speech."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Introduction15denotation is not wholly abandoned but is “shifted to something else” (arthäntarasankramita). When we say, “The spears enter the city,” we are using the secondary power (we are using a trope). The literal meaning of “spears,” its denoted object, namely, weapons of a specific shape, has been replaced by men carrying spears. But why do we speak in this way? Why do we use such secondary or tropical expressions? Usually, say Änanda and Abhinava, in order to achieve some sugges­tion. In the case of the spears entering, one imagines a more compact and injurious force breaking into the city than would be expressed by the literal statement.The “first of poets,” Vâlmïki, wrote of the winter:The sun has stolen our affection for the moon, whose circle now is dull with frost and.like a mirror blinded by one’s breath shines no more.Änanda quotes this verse (2.1 c A) for its use of the word “blinded\" and Abhinava comments both on the secondary usage and the suggestion. The word “blinded,\" he says, is used in a secondary sense here, because only sentient creatures can be literally blind. The purpose, though, of using this trope is to suggest “numberless properties [of the winter moon] such as uselessness, an exceptional loss of beauty, and so on.” A point that is noticed often by both our authors is that suggestion vastly increases the scope of words. The denotation is extremely narrow; the secondary sense includes only things (objects, properties, acts) which are closely related. The suggestion opens up a new world.So much for suggestion of the first type. In one of its varieties it is poetically useful, but in neither does it yet reveal the ultimate purpose of literature. That revelation lies within a second type of suggestion, which Änanda calls vivaksitänyaparaväcya, “where the literal sense is intended but only as leading on to something further.” This type also Änanda divides into two varieties, depending on whether or not we are conscious of the succession from the literal to the “something further.” Much the more important of the two varieties is that where we are not conscious of any interval between the two senses (asamlaksitakrama). for in this variety the “something other” is a rasa or something closely allied to a rasa; and rasa in the critique of Änanda is the ultimate aim of literature.The word rasa in its most literal sense means juice, taste, flavor. In a technical sense the BhNS uses it to express the flavor or mood which"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"16Introductioncharacterizes a play if the author and actors sire successful in their work. According to BhNÉ 6.15 there are eight possible flavors which a play may exhibit: the erotic (srngâra), the comic (hâsya), the tragic (kanma), the furious or cruel (vaudra), the heroic (vira), the fearsome or timorous (bhayânaka), the gruesome or loathsome (bïbhatsâ), and the wondrous (adbhuta). To these Änanda adds a ninth, the rasa of peace (sänta). These flavors, as their names indicate, are based on var­ious human emotions, the sthâyibhâvas or “abiding emotions,” as they are called, which are listed in BhNS 6.17.22 Just how the rasas differ from the emotions was a question much argued in Änanda’s age and in the following two centuries. Curiously, Änanda has never a word to say on the subject; and unfortunately most students of the Dhvanyâloka have inconsiderately filled the gap by superimposing Abhinava’s expla­nation on the text of Änanda. I propose to come at an answer more cautiously by recalling the words of BhNÓ and its oldest commentators and then examining Änanda’s use of the term.BhNS 6.31 +3 (the famous rasasütra) tells us that “A rasa is pro­duced by the combining of the determinants (vibhävas), the conse­quents (anubhävas), and the temporary or transient states of mind (vyabhicärinah or vyabhicäribhävas).23 These technical terms require explanation. By determinants are meant those factors which make the realization of the emotion and the rosa possible. They are of two sorts, objective (âlambanavibhâva) and stimulative (uddïpanavibhâva). The objective determinants are the objects toward which the emotions are felt. In the erotic flavor they will be the lover and his beloved; in the tragic, the person or persons who suffer; in the loathsome, the object of disgust. The stimulative determinants in the erotic will be such factors as the springtime, gardens, or a bridal chamber; in tragedy, such fac­tors as separation from dear ones, death, or capture. The consequents of the emotions may be regarded by the audience as its symptoms; in” They are: sexual desire (rati), laughter (häsa), grief (soka), anger (krodha), heroic energy (vtsäha), fear (bhaya), disgust (Jugupsä), and wonder or amazement (vismaya).33 Vibhävänubhävavyabhicärisamyogäd rasanispattih. The commentator Lollata supplied a genitive, sthdyinah, to go with the ablative compound. That is, he interpreted the sûtra to say, “A rasa is produced by the combining of the abiding emotion with the determinants, the consequents, and the transient states of mind.” Later commentators found fault with this interpretation, for they restricted the rasa to the audience. In the case of the audience, the basic emotions cannot be observed without the previous presence of the determinants, etc. But as we shall see, Änanda did not restrict the rasa in this way."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Introductionthe erotic flavor, for example, they will include the sidelong glances, smiles, the graceful movements of the limbs. The temporary or tran­sient states of mind are listed as thirty-three in number. Among them are discouragement, apprehension, jealousy, embarrassment, intoxica­tion. Some are appropriate to only one basic emotion, some to several. To them are added eight involuntary states (sättmkabhävas), which a good actor, however, was trained to represent at will: perspiration, horripilation, trembling, fainting, and so on.An example will make these technical terms clearer. Änanda quotes (4.2 a A) the following stanza from the Amaru collection as an example of the erotic flavor (srngârarasa):Seeing that the attendant had left the bedroom,the young wife rose half upright from the bedand, gazing long upon her husband’s faceas he lay there feigning sleep, at last took courageand kissed him lightly, only to discoverhis feint from the rising flesh upon his cheek.When then she hung her head in shame, her dear one seized her, laughing, and kissed her in good earnest.Here the objective determinants are the husband and his bride. The stimulative determinant is the bedroom in which the lovers And them­selves alone. The consequents of the bride’s basic emotion are her gazing at her husband’s face and kissing him; the consequents of his, the laughter and kisses with which the stanza ends. Meanwhile we have the bride’s transient state of shame or embarrassment and the invol­untary state evident in the rising flesh on the husband’s cheek. It is by the combination of these factors that srngârarasa, here of the type “love-in-enjoyment” (sambhogasrngära), is suggested.Bhatta Lollata, the oldest commentator of the BhNS whose views are known to us,24 said that the rasa was simply an intensified form of the abiding emotion,25 which it assumed after being strengthened by the determinants and similar factors; and this is clearly the sense in which Dandin had taken the term many years earlier.26 Lollata also stated that the rasa had its place both in the character being portrayed’‘ They are known from three sources: the Locana on 2.4, ABh. on 6.31 +3, and Mammata 4.28.35 Tena sthâyy evo mbhävänubhävädibhir vpacito rasah.’• Dandin 2.275: yuktotkarsam ca tat trayam, where trayam refers to the three rasâdi figures of speech. Again, after giving an example of the figure ürjasvin. he explains (2.283): ity âruhya paräm kotim krodho raudrätmatäm gatah."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"18Introductionand in the actor.27 The most glaring fault of this interpretation, that it leaves out the audience, was partially addressed by Sankuka, the next commentator, who may have lived about Änanda’s time. He stated that the basic emotion ( bhäva), supposed to exist in the character being portrayed, was imitated by the actor for the delight of the audience and was given a different name, namely, rasa, because it was an imitation.28 This theory too has its drawbacks, which led to still further theories by Bhattanäyaka and Abbinava. But those lie beyond the time of Änanda, and I have shown enough now to take up Änanda’s use of the word.Änanda uses the word rasa of a basic emotion that has been height­ened,29 sometimes from whatever reason, but most specifically from the combination prescribed by BhNS. An example of his use of the term in the most general sense is Dhv. 3.26 a A:The peaceful is indeed apprehended as a rasa. It is characterized by the full development of the happiness that comes from the dying off of desire. As has been said, ‘T he joy of pleasure in the world / and the greater joy of pleasures found in heaven / are not worth a sixteenth of the joy / that comes from the dying of desire” (MBh. 12.186.36).Here rasa is simply a heightened form of peaceful happiness (sukha). Similarly, “For srngärarasa, as it is regularly the object of the experi­ence of humans and is therefore dear to them, is the most important (of the rasas]” (3.29 A). Here one cannot argue that the regular object of human experience is the aesthetic pleasure of love poetry. What he means is a heightened emotion of sexual love.Änanda conceives this rasa to abide in the character invented by the poet or in the poet himself, as well as in the audience. As for the first: “The speaker may be the poet or a character invented by the poet. If the latter, he may be devoid of rasa and bhäva, or he may be possessed of rasa and bhäva” (3.6 g A). As for the poet himself, it is when he is un­der such a heightened state of emotion as rasa that he becomes capable of writing the suggestive poetry that will transfer this rasa to his hear­ers. The process is illustrated by the story of the first poet, Vâlmîki,17 Sa cobhayor apy anukärye 'nukartary api.99 Sthäy» bhävo mvkhyarämädisthäyyanukaranarüpo ’nukaranarüpatväd eva ca nä- mäntarena vyapadisto rasah^ A BK. on BKNÉ 6.31 (Vol. I, p. 272, two lines from bottom of page; given also by Gnoli, The Aesthetic Experience, p. 4, lines 8-9).29 Even after the time of Änanda, Induräja considered a rasa to be simply the basic emotion which had undergone strengthening (Induräja on Udbhata 4.3-4). The Candrikäkära seems to have held this same view; see 3.4 a L. note 4."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Introduction19who was so saddened by the wailing of the curlew bird who had lost its mate that Valmlki’s grief (soka. the basic emotion) was transformed into the tragic rasa of the Rämäyana (Dhv. 1.5 K and A). The notion of Abhinava that Vâlmïki ruminated on the determinants and consequents of the bird’s bereavement and so developed his rasa in the scriptural way strikes me as an addition quite foreign to the view of Ananda.In most cases, of course, Änanda’s rasa is indeed produced in the scriptural way by the poetic use of determinants and consequents. The examples of this use, as in the verse of Amaru quoted above, are legion throughout the book. I wish to emphasize, however, that Änanda’s sense of rasa has none of the aesthetic removal, the impersonality and generalization, which we shall see Abhinava give to the term.Änanda was the first Indian critic to state that a rasa cannot be directly expressed. If we say, “A young man and his bride were very much in love,” we give the hearer no flavor at all of what the love was like. This can be done only by suggestion. Accordingly, rasa is as important in poetry and literary prose as it is in plays, for there is no other way of enlisting the sympathy of the reader. By suggestion the rasa arises without any conscious realization that our experience has been preceded by a perception of the determinants, consequents, and transitory states of mind. These have been denoted literally and are not unintended by the author. They are intended, however, only as being productive of the rasa.I shall not describe in this Introduction the second variety of vivaksi- täjiyaparaväcya, the variety where we are forced to think about the literal sense for a moment before we perceive the suggestion and are therefore conscious of the interval between the literal and the suggested sense. The reader may examine that variety with all its subvarieties in the translation which follows (2.20ff.). Here I wish to speak of matters more strictly pertinent to my purpose.Änanda tells us that dhvani, that is, suggestion, or more specifically suggestion acting as the primary sense of a passage, is the soul of poetry (1.1 K ). But that is only half the story, for his critique is one which explains the goal of poetry to be rasa, and dhvani to be its means. Now the concept of rasa, it seems to me, is more important than that of dhvani in furnishing a criterion of beauty. For not all dhvani leads to rasa, nor does all dhvani lead to beauty.30 And it is as the discoverer30 Only the most ardent enthusi ill find beauty in the punning suggestions of the verses quoted under 2.21 f."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"20Introductionof a workable critique of beauty in literature that Änanda merits the fame which has long been accorded him. The works of previous poet- icians in India, although of interest for their analysis of language, are almost useless for this, the chief goal of literary criticism. One might write a poem embodying all the figures of speech listed by Bhämaha and Dandin and compose it in a style calculated by its phonemic and word-joining form to produce sweetness or strength. With a modest amount of care in syntax one could add clarity. All this would not en­sure the poem’s being beautiful, delighting its hearers. Indeed, if one followed the definitions too closely, the composition would more likely bore them. One gets to the reader only through the flavors deriving from the basic emotions. To do that, suggestion is necessary, but the test lies in the flavor.It might be thought that for purposes of furnishing a criterion of beauty or of literary excellence the achieving of a rasa suffers from a touch of the vagueness and lack of precision of which we complained in speaking of the “qualities” of poetry. On what basis is one to say that one verse achieves rasa and another does not? Of course the final test will be the judgment of the heart. But to help the reader and the composer—for Änanda always writes with both types of student in mind—he speaks of several supplemental tests.The literary piece must exhibit appropriateness (aucitya). To begin with, the plot must be appropriate to the emotions, the determinants, and the consequents which are to produce the intended rasa. In ex­hibiting the heroism of a human king, for example, one should not engage him in adventures that could be accomplished only by a god (3.10-14 A). If a plot as given in the epics and Puränas contains a trait that is inappropriate to the character of the hero or to the intended rasa, one must either omit it or add some element to the plot to achieve the needed appropriateness (3.10-14e A). In this regard Änanda cites Kälidäsa as an example to be followed. His reference is in general terms only, but we might supply such a specific instance as the Éâkantala, where in the epic prototype the king abandons with needless cruelty the heroine whom he has seduced.1 Such action would be inappropriate to1 In the Critical Edition of the MBh., after being forced by a voice from heaven to recognize his son, the king says to Sakuntalä, “It was to purify you ii.e., to convince my people of your purity) that I did this\" (MBh. 1.69.40). The Southern version, however (MBh. 1.627* S), says that he had simply forgotten her."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Introduction21true love and to the noble character of King Dusyanta as Kälidäsa con­ceives it. So Kälidäsa invented the story of the ring of recognition,2 by losing which Sakuntalä unhappily brings upon the king his involuntary forgetfulness.All the sandhyangas, the plot-components which are prescribed act by act for a play in the BhNS, are to be employed only insofar as they are consistent with the rasa which the author intends to display. In this regard Änanda very justly praises the Ratnàvalï and reprehends the Ventsamh&ra. In the latter play Duryodhana suddenly exhibits amorousness (viläsa) in the second act, which is otherwise filled with preparations for war and vengeance, simply because Bharata prescribed viläsa as a sandhyanga of second acts. As Abhinava puts it, the au­thor should have taken the word viläsa in a wider meaning and have depicted in Duryodhana a yearning not for sex but for some goal more appropriate to the spirit of the play.The concept of appropriateness was further elaborated by later critics of the Kashmir school. Ksemendra in the generation following Abhi­nava wrote an entire treatise on the subject. What is characteristic of Änanda’s treatment, and what I would emphasize in taking a view of his work as a whole, is that he always associates his appropriateness closely with rasa. In great literature the words must be appropriate to the plot, the characters, the immediate situation, but they become appropriate Only through their enabling these factors to build up to the intended rasa.Änanda brings also other, older elements of the critical tradition i a subservience to the same final goal. He redefines the old qualiti of sweetness and strength by treating them as ornaments of partic­ular rasas. Sweetness is what ornaments srngära, whereas strength ornaments the rasa of fury (2.6 A to 2.9 A). Style (sanghatanä, riti) also is influenced by the rasa, as it is in intimate connection with the qualities, but a sparingness or frequency of compound word structure is no sure guide, in Änanda’s opinion, to the presence or absence of2 Winternitz and others supposed that Kälidäsa had taken the story of the ring from the Srstikhanda of the Padmapuräna. The Srstikhanda occurs only in the Bengali version of the Pad.P. and is a late Vaisnava reworking of an earlier text. The reworking is later even than the Muslim conquest of Benares. The Sakuntalä story occurs in chapters 1-6, which are part of the Vaisnava reworking. They are therefore likely to be a derivative of Kälidäsa’s play and are certainly not its source. See Asoke Chatterjee. Padma-Parana: A Study. Calcutta Sanskrit College Research Series LVIII (1967), pp. 104 ff., especially p. 114."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"22Introductionsweetness or strength. Furthermore style is influenced by genre. The single stanza (muktaka) offers less scope for a heavy style than linked stanzas (e.g., the kulaka). The heavily ornamented compound style is especially appropriate to the prose romance (3.8).Änanda’s critique with its emphasis on rasa offers for the first time a criterion for the figures of speech. A figure of speech is well constructed when it strengthens the rasa. To do this it must not be overworked. Änanda quotes a verse (2.18-19e A) which begins, “In anger she has bound him tightly in the noose of her soft arms.” Abhinava remarks that “were one to continue the metaphor furnished by the woman’s creeper-like arms acting as a noose for binding, the woman would be­come a huntress, the bedroom would become a prison or cage, and so on, all of which would be most inappropriate.” In general, figures should never be so elaborate as to take either the poet’s mind or the reader’s mind off the main goal, which is rasa. As Horace would say, there should be no purple patches.In several passages (e.g., 2.3ff. and 3.34ff.) Änanda distinguishes be­tween dhvani, as a suggestion which furnishes the predominant mean­ing of a sentence, and a subordinated form of suggestion which he calls gunïbhütavyangya. Among his examples of the latter type is a stanza which he quotes twice (at 3.34 A and 1.13 e A).The sunset is flushed with red; the day goes ever before.Ah, such is the way of fate that never the two shall meet.As the Sanskrit word for sunset is feminine (sandhyâ) and the word for day masculine (divasah), the suggestion arises of two lovers prevented by adverse fate from ever joining. But the stanza is obviously from a description of sunset. The literal sense remains predominant. The suggestion functions as a figure of speech.3This distinction has often been misunderstood by modern Sanskrit scholars and among them by some of the best. Jacobi, in the introduc­tion to his admirable translation of the Dhvanyäloka (ZDMG 56 [1902], p. 400), speaks of the poetry of subordinated suggestion as “eine Poe­sie zweiter Güte,” a phrase repeated by Winternitz twenty years later.4S. K. De, in his History of Sanskrit Poetics (II, p. 162), uses the same pejorative. “By the side of dhvani kävya,”5 he writes, “in which the3 There was argument over whether to call the figure samdsokti or dksepa. See notes on the passages where the stanza is quoted.* Geschichte der indischen Literatur III, p. 18.3 A phrase, by the way, which Änanda nowhere uses."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Introduction23suggested sense is predominant, we have poetry of second-rate excel­lence, designated gunï-bhûta-vyahgya kävya, in which the unexpressed plays a subordinate part.”This error should be corrected, for nowhere in the Dhvanyâloka does Änanda characterize the poetry of gunïbhûtavyangya as second-rate. That characterization appears first in Mammata (1.4-5), who speaks of madhyamam kävyam as opposed to uttamam. Mammata threw all cases where the suggestion was obvious (agûdha) or not beautiful (asun- dam) into the category of gunïbhûtavyangya. Änanda, on the other hand, refers to subordinated suggestion (3.36 b A) as having been used by the great poets and states that it can be extremely beautiful and should be studied by sensitive readers. The very examples which he gives of gunïbhûtavyangya (e.g., at 1.13 d, e, 3.39, 3.40) should inform the reader of his evaluation, for they are among the most beautiful stanzas in the. whole book. I shall not quote them here, as the reader, if curious, can look them up in the translation.What prompted Änanda to make this distinction between dhvani and subordinated suggestion was an historical fact, not an aesthetic judgment. Many cases of suggestion had been preempted by the older poeticians, especially Udbhata, under their definitions of the figures of speech. Thus, according to Udbhata, the figure samäsokti (compound statement) occurs where from a description of the object-in-hand (pra- stutârtha)j that is, the primary object of the sentence, one understands some other object (Induräja 2.10; Vivrti 2.21). An example would be t)ie little stanza which I have just quoted, “The sunset is flushed with red.” The figure aprastutaprasamsa (reference by means of the ex­traneous; in some instances equivalent to allegory) occurs where from an extraneous object (aprastutârtha) we understand the object that the poet really has in mind (Induräja 5.8; Vivrti 5.14). Now it was Änanda’s goal to break away from the tradition of figures of speech, to set up suggestion (dhvani) as an independent power of words, and to establish the suggested meaning as the soul of poetry. As the Sanskrit term for a figure of speech (alankâra) means literally an ornament, Änanda was also faced with the logical problem of how the soul could act as an ornament. One might conceive of the soul’s being orna­mented, say by its body or its virtues, but by what sort of logic could a primary element, the thing-to-be-ornamented (alankärya), itself act as an ornament?Änanda’s solution to the problem was to relegate all instances of suggestion which had been included in the figures of speech by the"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"24Introductionolder critics6 to a subordinate position. In that position they could very well serve as ornaments. An example will show the method which he followed and its success in achieving his goal.There is a famous stanza, written perhaps by Bäna but included in the collection of Amaru, which likens the purifying power of God to the fire by which he destroyed the triple citadel of the demons.7The women of the Triple City wept from lotus eyesas éambhu’s arrow-flame embraced them;but still, though shaken off, the fire caught their hands,though struck, did pluck their garments’ hem,denied, it seized their hair, and, scomedlike lover who has lately loved another, lay before their f t.May this same fire bum away your sins.In this stanza, as Änanda remarks, the description of the demon women suggests that unhappy variety of srngara which is so close to tragedy, namely love-in-separation, here brought about by jealous anger. But this flavor (îrsyâmpralambhasrngârarasa) is not the fi­nal aim or meaning of the stanza, which is rather the extraordinary power of God. As the suggested rasa of love is not the final aim, he characterizes it as subordinated suggestion, not dhvani in the strict sense. This subordinated element can logically act as an ornament. Bhämaha’s definition of rasavadalankâra is thereby maintained with­out injury to Änanda’s new doctrine of dhvani. But there is nothing second-rate about such instances of subordinated suggestion. He calls such instances “derivative of dhvani” (dhvaninisyanda, 3.36 b A and 3.41-42 b A) and remarks under 3.40 that such instances “may again turn into dhvani when regarded from the viewpoint of [the final] rasa.” In the stanza just quoted one may take the final meaning to be the rasa of God’s heroism or the rasa of the worshiper’s love of God. The historical reasons which prompted Änanda to make the distinction be­tween predominant and subordinated suggestion are no discovery of mine. They were noticed by both Jacobi and S. K. De.One final question must be raised and answered concerning Änanda before I move on to the period of his commentator Abhinava. This is the question whether he was the author of the whole of the Dhvanyäloka or of only a part of it."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Introduction25The text of the Dhvanyâloka consists of 138 Kärikäs,8 written in simple verses (almost all in sloka or äryä meter) and intended to be memorized. Expatiating on the verses is a prose commentary ( Vrtti), approximately twenty times their length. Within this prose commen­tary again are some twenty-nine simple verses, indistinguishable in style from the Kärikäs, but usually introduced with some such remark as “This is a supportive (parikara) stanza,\" or “Herewith a summariz­ing {sanksepa, saiigraha) stanza.\" These supportive and summarizing stanzas can also be distinguished from the Kärikäs by the fact that the prose Vrtti never comments on them. In the case of two of them (3.41-42 a A), which are not introduced by the usual remark but by the simple phrase, “it is stated,” Abhinava tells us specifically that the matter is stated by the author of the Vrtti.Until the mid-nineteenth century it was always supposed in India that all this material was the work of one man, Änandavardhana. And this is quite in keeping with the form in which other Sanskrit treatises on literary criticism have been handed down. Kuntaka’s Vakroktijivita, written in the age of Abhinava, comes to us in precisely the same combination of Kärikäs, prose commentary, and supplemental stanzas. Except for the absence of supplemental verses the same is true of the text of Mammata, Ruyyaka, Hemacandra, and Visvanâtha. Not only literary criticism but Sanskrit treatises on most scientific or philosoph­ical subjects tended to be composed in this form. One may instance the works of Bhartrhari the grammarian, Kumärila the ritualist, Dhar- maklrti the Buddhist.Then in the mid-nineteenth century a remark of Georg Bühler9 sug­gested that the Kärikäs of the Dhvanyâloka might be by an older au­thor and only the Vrtti by Änanda. Thirty years later Hermann Jacobi took up the question in earnest.10 He pointed out that the question of dhvani must have been discussed for many years prior to the time of Änanda. This follows from the variety of opinions on the subject of dhvani which Kärikä 1.1 ascribes to “others.” So far so good. But* In the Kashi Series text, upon which we have based our translation, the Kärikäs come to a total of 142. But three of them (4.4, 4.9, and 4.10) are almost surely not intended as Kärikäs but as summary or supportive stanzas, while 3.5 is a quotation from some other author. See notes to the translation of those passages.* “Detailed Report of a Tour in Search of Sanskrit MSS in Kashmir, Rajputana and Central India,” Journal of the Royal .Asiatic Society of Bombay, extra num­ber 1877, p. 69.10 See especially the i"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"26IntroductionJacobi went on to claim that Abhinava, the oldest commentator that we have on the text, furnishes evidence of a dual authorship.With the adherence of other Sanskritists to the theory of dual au­thorship, a vast amount of ink has flowed on the question. It was pointed out that the Abhidhävrttimätrkä, written in about A.D. 900- 925, attributed the doctrine of dhvani to sahrdayäh (“connoisseurs,” or possibly “the honorable connoisseur”), whereupon one misguided scholar claimed that the name of the author of the Kärikäs must have been Sahrdaya. On the other hand, it was established that Räjasekhara about the same time attributed one of the supplemental slokas of the Dhvanyäloka to Änanda and, in a verse preserved in the Süktimuk- tâvalî (4.78), attributed to Änanda the whole introduction of dhvani into poetics.The student who would examine all the arguments which can be ad­duced for dual authorship should consult Kane’s HSP, pp. 153-190, where that great scholar, like the lawyer that he was, gives a full-dress argument in its favor. Almost all of Kane’s arguments, like those of Jacobi, are based on the remarks of Abhinavagupta, who frequently supplements such a phrase of the Vrtti as idam pratipäditam (“this has been stated”) by some such addition as vrttikärena (“by the au­thor of the Vrtti” ) or by asmanmülagranthakärena ( “by the author of the basic text [i.e., of the Karikhs]\" ). From such passages Kane ar­gues that Abhinava regarded the two portions as written by different authors. Against his view, Dr. Satkari Mookerjee (B. C. Law Vol­umes, I, pp. 179-194), followed by Dr. K. Krishnamoorthy (IHQ 24, pp. 180-194 and 300-311), has argued that Abhinava is merely dis­tinguishing the different functions of one man. To me the arguments on both sides are inconclusive because Abhinava is so inconsistent. There is no doubt that he regarded Änanda as the author of the Vrtti. There are passages in the Locano, I admit, where he seems to regard the author of the Kärikäs as someone else. But then in his Abhinava- bhâratï (Vol. 2, pp. 299-300) he explicitly ascribes two of the Kärikäs of the Dhvanyäloka to Änanda.11 I am not at all confident that Abhinava had any historical knowledge on the matter. A man who could speak of Manoratha as a contemporary of Änanda (1.1 c L) and who confuses“ Kane tries to explain away this inconsistency by saying that Bhattatauta was Abhinava’s teacher in BhNS, whereas Bhattendurâja was his teacher in Dhv., and that in both cases Abhinava merely followed his teacher’s opinion. But that argu­ment is destructive of Kane’s goal. Bhattatauta's opinion would be more valuable than Abhinava’s and no less valuable than Bhattenduräja's."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Abhinanda with his father Jayantabhatta (3.7 L, but cf. note 3) is not to be much trusted in matters of history.Two considerations persuade me of the single authorship of the Dhva- nyäloka. First, there is not a single instance in the Vrtti of substantial disagreement with the Kärikäs. There is not even a case where the Vrtti interprets a Kärikä in a forced or unnatural manner. This is rarely the case where one Sanskrit critic comments on the work of smother. There is much matter and long arguments in the Vrtti which are not in the Kärikäs, it is true. If there were not, there would have been no purpose in writing the Vrtti. But these matters and arguments are auxiliary. They do not change the basic system.Second, if some earlier genius had established the system of dhvani and the general critique of literature in terms of dhvani and rasa which is found in the Kärikäs, I find it inconceivable that a later author should not have given some praise, some respect, to him, indeed that he should not even have mentioned his name. Important texts are never treated by the Sanskrit tradition as anonymous. They always carry the name of an author, even if modern scholarship may prove that the name is mistaken or fictitious. If the Kärikäs are not by Änanda, his silence regarding their authorship would be an instance of disrespect to an intellectual master without parallel in Sanskrit literature. 1212 Professor Patwardhan has called my attention to an article by Dr. Senarat Paranavitana, “The Dhvanyäloka in fifteenth century Ceylon,” JAOS 94 (1971), pp. 131-133. The article contains the text and translation of a Sanskrit inscrip­tion giving a thesis (sthäpana) upheld in debate by a scholar at the court of King Paräkramabähu VI (a.d. 1412-1467) to the effect that the Dhvanikärikäs were writ­ten by a Buddhist named Dharmadâsa. The debater’s evidence consists in his statement that a manuscript of the Dhvantkärikäs in the library of the King of SuvarnadvTpa (Sumatra) bore on its last page the statement “Dharmadäsa-pandita- viracitam.” The debater seems not to have seen this manuscript himself, but to have heard of it from a Rädhäkrsna-pandita, who gave the further information that the first twenty Kärikäs of the manuscript were not to be found in copies of the Dhvanikärikäs in India. In these verses the author divided semantic powers into arthaiakli and vyanjanasakti, from the latter of which springs dhvani. The debater argues that Änandavardhana left out these verses because they were too obviously connected with the tradition by which the Buddha is said to have taught särihah savyanjano dharmah.Professor Patwardhan, I think, gives more credence to this thesis than I do. If there was indeed such a manuscript in a royal library of Sumatra, I should think it must have been a Buddhist reworking of the Dhv. verses. The normal meaning of arthato vyanjanato dharmadesanä in Buddhist texts is “the leaching of the letter and spirit of the Law.” I much doubt that these terms would have been appliedIntroduction 27"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"IntroductionSoon after the death of King Avantivarman (a.d. 883) literature seems to have lost its royal patronage in Kashmir. We are told of one learned brahmin, Näyaka,13 who was given charge of a newly erected temple (R ä j.T5.159), but the court poets, such as Bhallata (5.204). fared badly. The favorites of the new king Sankaravarman (a.d. 883-902) were men of low birth. Kalhana speaks with scorn of Sankaravarman’s ignorance of Sanskrit, claiming that he spoke “an Apabhramsa dialect worthy of a drunkard” (5.206).With the death of Sankaravarman things went from bad to worse. The history of Kashmir in the tenth century falls roughly into two parts. The first half saw the breakdown of royal administration and power under the demands of the Tantrin footsoldiers who time and again sold the throne to the highest bidder. Then from about the middle of the century the guidance of political affairs passed into the hands of the terrible Diddä. Diddä was born a Khasa princess. Her father held the fortress of Lohara on the main route from Kashmir to the Punjab. On her mother’s side she was descended from the Shahi kings of Und and Kabul. Outliving her royal husband, Diddä governed for some years in the name of her child son, securing her own safety by fomenting discord among the military and political factions. When the son died not long after coming of age, she established a grandson in his place. There were three of these little grandsons whom the unnatural Diddä placed on the throne only to murder each child after his enjoying for a few years the titular sovereignty. Finally, from 980- 1003 she assumed the royal title in her own right, governing with the aid of her paramour Tunga whom she had elevated from the peasantry. In the end she left a strong kingdom to a nephew whom she had chosen by carefully testing him against other candidates. And so began the Lohara Dynasty with a return of prosperity under two long-reigning kings.Because of the withdrawal of court patronage, court literature vir­tually disappears from Kashmir during the tenth century. From this century in Kashmir we have no plays, no Sanskrit lyrics. The onlyto the technical study of semantics without a stimulus from non-Buddhist sources. And the total silence of India about Dharmadäsa’s authorship of the work strikes me as strong evidence against the thesis. Kashmiri brahmins of Änanda’s time, including Änanda himself, showed no prejudice against Buddhist authors nor any desire to hide Buddhist ideas.13 The name and the date suggest an identification with Bhattanäyaka, of whom I shall have more to say. But “Näyaka\" was not an uncommon name.28"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"mahäkävya that we have from this period is Abhinanda’s Kddambari- kathasara, a work which retells in verse what Bäna in a former century had told better in prose.14 The traditions of Sanskrit scholarship, how­ever, were not broken. The brahmins living in the capital or on their tax-free grants of land saw that their sons were taught Sanskrit gram­mar and the traditional Sanskrit sciences, in many cases teaching their sons themselves. The tradition was especially well maintained in 3 ai va philosophy and literary criticism.Saiva philosophy owes its origin in Kashmir to two sages of the ninth century, Somänanda and Vasugupta. The views of the former were developed by his son Utpala into the doctrine of recognition (praty- abhijnä); those of the latter, with the help of his disciple Kallata, into the doctrine of cosmic vibration (spanda). These two branches of philosophy were preserved during the difficult years of the tenth century, the former by Utpala’s son Laksmanagupta, who became one of Abhinava’s teachers. The school of vibration had a more checkered career, for Kallata’s son, Mukula, seems to have turned away from philosophy toward literary criticism. His one surviving work, the Abhi- dhävrttimätrkä, is concerned with the nature of denotation and the secondary use of words. His son, Pratlhära Induräja, followed in his steps and wrote a commentary on Udbhata. Meanwhile, the school of vibration was carried on in the family of a scholar named Bhötiräja, who also taught the Krama Tantras and, as an old man one presumes, taught tantrism to Abhinava. Bhütiräja’s son, Bhattenduräja,15 also taught Abhinava in other subjects, notably in the Bhagavadgitä and the Dhvanyäloka.16Among these brahmin scholars with their thoughts turned away from politics to mystic philosophy and literature the Dhvanyäloka was much studied. The first commentary on the Dhvanyäloka, now lost, was called the Candrikä. It was written by some member of Abhinava’s family, to whom Abhinava often refers but never by name. Sometimes he calls him “the author of the Candrikä” (3.26 b L), sometimes “aIntroduction 2914 At the end of the ninth century, Abhinanda’s father, Jayantabhatta, had writ­ten an admirable work, the Nyäyamanjari.

Always his references carry a criticism: “The author of the Candrikä who could easily fail to see an elephant in front of his eyes” (3.33 b L): “A certain commentator now enough of arguing with persons who think themselves wise but whose references are wrong\" (3.4 a L). If one glances through ail such passages, one will find that the author of the Candrikä usually chose the simple or natural meaning whereas Abhinava gives a more subtle interpretation. In several cases I think the Candrikä came closer to what Änanda actually meant (e.g., 3.33 b L and 1.1 b L).Another scholar before Abhinava’s time occupied himself with the Dhvanyäloka but for a different purpose. Bhattanâyaka’s intention was to demolish the concept of dhvani. He seems to have gone through the book systematically, examining Änanda's examples, showing how each one might be explained without reference to the new concept. Bhatta­näyaka’s work was called the Hrdayadarpana, and it too is now lost. But Abhinava describes for us, largely in his opponent’s own words, the theory which Bhattanäyaka hoped to substitute for that which he destroyed. I shall treat of it in dealing with Abhinava’s doctrine of rasa, for Abhinava, although he vigorously opposed Bhattanäyaka. borrowed from him not a little.Abhinavagupta was born about the middle of the tenth century into a learned family that descended from a brahmin named Atrigupta, who had been brought to Kashmir from Kanauj by King Lalitäditya after his conquest of that city.17 The king had given him a dwelling place in his capital of Pravarapura (the modern Srinagar) on the bank of the Jhelum river facing the Saiva temple of Sitämsumaulin.18 Prom his loving description of its environs one infers that Abhinava had lived in that ancestral mansion at least as a child. His father, whose proper name was Narasimha, but who was popularly known as Cukhalaka, was an ardent devotee of Siva.19 Becoming a vairägin by strenuous asceti­cism, he overcame the miseries of worldly existence. Before departing from the world, however, he introduced Abhinava, and presumably his younger brother also, to Sanskrit grammar. The brother, Manoratha, was to be the first of Abhinava’s disciples.70"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Introduction31The number of Abhinava’s works is large. Even the preserved works very nearly fill a half shelf in my library. To these must be added a considerable number of lost works, of which we know the title or subject matter from references in the works which are preserved. As a complete bibliography is available in V. Raghavan’s Catalogua Catalogorum, and as details on the subject matter of most of the works may be found in Pandey’s Abhinavagupta, I shall give only an outline.In general Abhinava’s oeuvre falls into three parts. (1) Commen­taries on the Tantras and surveys of their doctrines. The greatest of these works is the huge Tanträloka, published in twelve volumes in the Kashmir Series of Texts and Studies, and the summary, Tantrasâra, published in the same series and now available in an Italian translation by Raniero Gnoli.21 (2) Works on literary criticism. The first of these was a commentary on the Kävyakautuka of his teacher Bhattatauta. Both it and the \"work on which it commented are known only from ref­erences and quotations,22 chiefly from the Locana and the Abhinava- bhàratï. The Locana23 must have come second, for Abhinava refers to it in the Abhinavabhàratï. The latter work is Abhinava’s commen­tary on the BhNS. An almost complete, though sadly corrupt, text of the ABh. is now available in the GOS.2* (3) Commentaries of the Recognition (pratyabhijha) School of philosophy. There are three of these. On Somänanda’s Parätrimsikävivrti (the Parätrirnsikä, or verses on the ultimate, form the final portion of the Rudrayamalatantra), Abhinava wrote the Parätrimsikätattvavivarana, or Anuttaratrimsika- viOrrti (KSTS 7, 18). On Utpala’s ïsvarapratyabhijhâsütra he wrote the Isvarapratyabhijhävimarsini, also called “the Small Commentary” (Laghutnvrti), published as KSTS 22 and 32. On Utpala’s Isvara- pratyabhijnâtïkà he wrote the Isvarapratyabhijhâvivrtivimarsinï, called also “the Great Commentary” (brhatï mmarsinï), KSTS 60 and 62. 31 * 33 3431 “Essenza dei Tantra,” Encyclopedia de autori cl aid, No. 38, Boringhieri,Turin, 1960.33 Gathered by P.

He gives the dates of completion of only three of them. The Ksemastotra was completed in A.D. 990, the Bhairavastotra in 992, and the lévarapratyabhijnâvivrtivimarsinî in 1014. K. C. Pandey in his monograph on Abhinavagupta believed that a period of Tantric studies in Abhinava’s youth was followed by his work on literary criticism and this in turn by a final period of concern with Pratyabhijna philosophy. The linchpin of his belief was a reference in the Locano, which he be­lieved was to the Tanträloka. But this linchpin has now broken. The reference exists only in the false reading of the NS edition (p. 19) of that work.27 Furthermore, the hypothesis does not agree with the gen­eral order of Abhinava’s intellectual interests which seems to be given in the biographical information at the end of the Tanträloka:[The author] was introduced into the forest of grammar by his father, had his mind clarified by a few drops of the sea of logic, and, when intent on enjoying the full rasa of literature, was seized with an intoxicating devotion to liva. Being wholly filled with that, he no longer cared for any worldly pursuit, until, in order to increase his enjoyment of that devotion, he went to serve in the houses of [religious] masters. ( Tanträloka 37.58-59)There follow the names of a great many of his teachers, among which is the name Bhütiräjatanaya, “the son of Bhötiräja,” that is to say, Bhattenduräja, Abhinava’s master in the Dhvanyäloka, as also the name of Laksmanagupta,28 his teacher in Pratyabhijna philosophy.

The cor­rect reading, given by the Kashi edition, p. 67, carries a very different meaning: taduttîrnatve tu sarvam brahmety asmacchästrakärena na no viditam tattvaloka- grantham viracayatd. Thus the reference is to a work of Änanda called the Tattvâ- loka, not to the Tanträloka of Abhinava. The Kashi reading is substantiated by Abhinava’s later reference to this Tattväloka under Chapter 4, Kârikâ 5 of the Lo­cano (Kashi edition p. 533, line 5 of Locano): etac ca granthakärena tattvâloke vitatyoktam.” Laksmanagupta is also praised in TA 1.11.32"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Introduction33Tanträloka and Tantrasära should therefore be placed among the last of his works. His initiation into Kaula tantrism by Sambhunätha and his dûtï BhägavatT (see TA 1.13 and commentary) seems to have given the final spiritual increment to his life. By it he became a siddha and there was nothing more to learn.Whether the literary studies followed or, as I should think, preceded the works on the philosophy of recognition, is not certain. In the Loca- na he quotes one verse of Utpala’s ïsvarapratyabhijnâ (see 1.8 L and note 3), but this proves only that he was acquainted with the works of Utpala at that time, not that he had already commented on them. In the Locana he comments on a verse from the Gitä (Bh.G. 2.69), giving much the same interpretation as that given in his Bhagavadgïtàrtha- sangraha (see Dhv. 3.1b L and note 3). This likewise does not prove that he had already written that work.It would take more space than I propose to allow myself and more knowledge than I possess to give an account of Abhinava’s entire con­tribution to Indian thought. What I shall have to say in the following pages is limited to the contribution furnished by the Locana.Abhinava chose the title Locana for his commentary on the Sahrdayä- loka (Dhvanyäloka) because he intended it to serve as an “eye” by which one could see the “light for connoisseurs” which Ananda had furnished. If we are to be fair to him, it is by his achievement of that purpose .that we must judge him, not by modern standards of historical or philological accuracy, nor even by the criterion of originality.. Like all Sanskrit commentators Abhinava had no interest in history. I have already noticed two of his historical errors. Just how uninterested he was in history appears still more clearly from his comment on the first Kärikä. In order to justify the perfect tense of the verbs there used (tasyäbhävam jagadur apart, etc.) Abhinava says, “The author had not actually heard the alternative views of those who deny the existence of suggestion. Rather, he will imagine such ideas and then refute them. Hence his use of the perfect tense,” for Panini prescribes the perfect to be used in the Bhäsä only for that which occurred in the past outside the range of one’s experience. Abhinava would rather allow his author to have been obtuse than to have committed a grammatical error. Frequently throughout the Locana Abhinava will depart from a natural interpretation of Änanda’s words in order to save him from some inconsistency (see, for example, 1.13 i or 2.26 A, note 2). He will even exclude an example as being spurious if he believes it has been improperly adduced (see 2.27 a A, note 2 and 2.27 a L)."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"34IntroductionAs against such instances which are faults by a standard foreign to the Sanskrit tradition of scholarship, Abhinava exhibits a high degree of skill in those abilities which his own tradition sought to develop. He is an impeccable grammarian, possesses a sound knowledge of Nyäya and Mïmâmsâ, and has the works of the older poeticians by heart. He uses his formidable education not in order to show off but to give the reader an accurate understanding of Änanda’s critique. In example af­ter example he points out just where the suggestion lies, the range of its meaning, and often just what it is that gives to it its camatkrti, its sudden effect of delight. For examples see his comments on the stanza “White herons circle against dark clouds\" (snigdhasyâmalakântilipta- viyuti, 2.1a), “Why do you laugh” (kim häsyena, 2.5 b), “Say, happy friend, if all is well” (gopavadhüviläsasuhrdäm, 2.5 f). Such careful aes­thetic explications de texte had just come into vogue. We find the fash­ion also in Abhinava’s contemporary Kuntaka. I know of no examples in the older literature. But, once established, it became characteristic of Sanskrit literary criticism and is what gives to that tradition of crit­icism its great strength. In our Western classical tradition there is nothing to compare with it except pseudo-Longinus.This careful analysis of Änanda’s examples leads Abhinava at times to remarkable discoveries. I may here point out just one of these. In 2.9 Änanda cites two examples of the rasa of fury (raudrarasa), the first composed in the style of long compounds traditionally as­sociated with that rasa, the other in a non-compounded analytical style. The point that Änanda would make in the passage is that either style may serve the purpose of suggesting fury. He adduces the two stanzas as examples and leaves it to the reader to savor the effect. Abhinava analyses the examples. Both examples are taken from that drama of vengeance, the Venïsamhâra. In the first it is the hero Bhlma who speaks. He vows to crush the thighs of Suyodhana, who had dragged Queen DraupadT through the Kuru assembly. Then he will deck Draupadl’s hair with his “hands new-reddened in that fresh-congealing blood.” The stanza begins with an immense com­pound: cancadbhujabhramitacandagadäbkighätasancürnitoruyugalasya suyodhanasya (literally, “of the by-my-whirling-arm-held-brutal-war- club-stroke-crushed-thighed Suyodhana”). After commenting on the suggestions of the stanza, Abhinava remarks, “From the long com­pound, flowing in an uninterrupted stream and allowing the hearer no pause in all its course, there results an apprehension of the whole scene as a unity up to the representation of the broken-thighed Suyodhana."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Introduction35This serves to intensify the impression of BhTma's violence.”29 On the other hand, in the second, analytical, stanza adduced by Änanda, Abbi­nava sees the effect to lie in a protracted climax. He says, \"Here the anger of the speaker rises to the highest pitch by a progression from word to word through meanings which, being presented separately, are reflected upon by the hearer in succession. And so the very absence of compounds acts as a cause of rising excitement.” When one reads such verses over after reading Abhinava’s comments, one reads them with a new appreciation and with some degree of the excitement and delight that he found in them himself. This is the highest gift that a literary critic can possess in any tradition.In only one important respect did Abhinava change what he found in Ananda's text. I refer to the new explanation he gave of rasa and of the psychological process by which it appears in the heart of the reader or the poet, for with Abhinava rasa is sharply excluded from the character invented by the poet or portrayed on the stage by an actor. The experience of Rama on losing Sita is the emotion of grief (soka). If the hearer of a poem or play were to experience the same emotion, he would close his book or leave the theater. There must be a qualitative difference between the sthäyibhäva and the rasa to explain how we can relish the tragic or the rasa of fear.Most of the components of Abhinava’s new theory are borrowed, strange to say, from Änanda’s chief critic. Bhattanäyaka had insisted that we do not perceive rasa as belonging to someone else, for in that case we would remain indifferent. Nor do we perceive it as belong­ing to ourselves—here Abhinava was to disagree—for the factors which Bharata says are productive of rasa, the determinants, as for example Sita and the abduction of Sita, work on Rama, not on us. Indeed, said Bhattanäyaka, rasa is not perceived at all, it is simply enjoyed. What happens is that in a great poem a second semantic operation comes into play by which denotation assumes a new dimension. Bhattanäyaka gave this operation the name of bhävanä (aesthetic efficacy). He borrowed the term from the technical vocabulary of Mlmämsä. where it is used of the efficacy residing in the verb of a Vedic sentence, which explains how that verb can bring an actor to pursue a given aim. By bhävanä” Some years ago I made the following remarks on this stanza with reference to Abhinava’s interpretation in a paper published in The Harvard Advocate (CXV, No. 4, summer 1982, p. 126). T he whole scene is before our eyes as soon as we understand the words at all. We are not allowed to dilute the effect by relishing it bit by bit. It hits the aesthetic sense not like pebbles but like a rock.\""},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"36Introductionthe ritualists meant the efficacy of a Vedic command. Bhattanäyaka then applied the term to poetry as the aesthetic efficacy of a particular combination of determinants and consequents. This aesthetic bhävanä, he claimed, has the effect of universalizing the determinants and other factors, so that they may bring about or realize a rasa. Upon the real­ization of the rasa, a third stage of the aesthetic process begins, namely enjoyment (bhoga), which Bhattanäyaka regarded as springing from a third semantic power, bhogakrttva (enjoyment-efficacy). We enjoy the rasa in a manner different from our enjoyment of direct experience or of apprehensions derived from memory. This enjoyment takes the form of melting, expansion, and radiance, and is like the bliss that comes from realizing one’s identity with the highest Brahman. This is the purpose of poetry. Any instruction that poetry may furnish is incidental.One should bear in mind that we know of Bhattanäyaka’s theory only through the writings of his opponents, Abhinava and Abhinava’s follower Mammata. The questions that arise in one’s mind as to the exact nature of bhävanä and why it should work to the effect claimed for it are ones for which he may have given answers of which we are not told. Abhinava’s most telling criticisms are two. First, that the newly extended use of the word bhävanä refers to nothing other than the suggestion of rasa (rasadhvani) described by Ànanda. Second, that it cannot be that rasa is never perceived. We must perceive it, or we should be unable to discuss it. And granted that this perception may be of a different sort from sense perception, we perceive a rasa as belonging to us.Beyond these specific criticisms, however, the reader will be struck by how much of his rival’s theory Abhinava incorporates into his own. He too excludes the actor and the portrayed character from enjoyment of rasa. What the character experiences is the basic emotion. As for the actor, if he experienced either the emotion or the rasa, he would forget his lines. Then too, although Abhinava holds to Änanda’s term of suggestion or dhvani, he sees in rasadhvani a transforming power that bears a close resemblance toNäyaka’s bhävanä. The grief, for example, that the observer perceives in the poetic character or the actor, by the observer’s ruminating on its determinants and consequents, meets with a response from his heart in which he identifies that grief with the griefs in his own memory. Rasa is not simply the apprehension of another person’s mental state. It is rather a supernormal relishing based on"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Introduction37an involved sympathy.30 By this sympathy, one might say, the reader or audience loses his own grief in the larger dimensions of compassion. Abhinava, like his opponent, sees rasa not as an object to be enjoyed but as the ongoing process of enjoyment itself. He too uses the word “melting” as one of its characteristics (see 1.5 L, note 3). He too is struck by the similarity of rasa to the relishing of the ultimate Brahman (2.4 L). One might say in sum that Abhinava has taken over most of the new ideas of Bhattanäyaka but trimmed them here and there so that they may fit into the terminology and the general view of Änanda. He even agrees at one point with the statement that enjoyment (he calls it bliss) is the chief goal of poetry, in comparison with which instruction is a far lesser goal (1.1 e L). But later, in Chapter Three (3.10-14 f), he brings this admission into harmony with a more orthodox view by attempting to show that delight and instruction are not different in nature.Abhinava adds much that is not in Änanda. He adds arguments against all the opponents of dhvani. not only against Bhattanäyaka but against both schools of Mlmämsä. He gives numerous examples of varieties of dhvani and of subordinated suggestion which Änanda had passed over. Interesting are his remarks on rasäbhäsa, false or improper rasa. According to the tradition going back to BhNÉ, a love that is not mutual, a love implemented by violence such as Rävana’s love for Sita, or an adulterous love, is productive only of rasäbhäsa. If oqe guides one’s criticism strictly by the words of Bharata (BhNÉ I, p. 295) such false love should lead to comedy. In fact, says Abhinava, it may lead to comedy only at a time long after our experience. When we hear Rävana’s passionate words in the Rävanakävya (alas, now lost) there is no occasion for relishing comedy (2.3 L). This qualification opens up to favorable evaluation much that would have been rejected or reprehended by older standards.Since Sanskrit criticism has been accused of concentrating too much on the individual verse or stanza, one will take a special interest in Abhinava’s tracing of the predominant rasa throughout a whole play, as he does with the Täpasavatsaräja (3.10-14 g L). His survey should impress the Western reader with the basic difference of movement in Sanskrit works of literature from that in European works. This differ­ence, between a tortuous or cyclical movement, a periodic distancing from and return to the predominant theme, as against the climacticinava’s argument with the Mlmämsä at 1.18 L."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"38Introductionachievement of a final result,31 is found, I believe, in all the traditional Indian arts. The Indian style is found only rarely in the West, as in the music of César Franck or in Joyce’s Finnegans Wake.To continue with a listing of interesting or illuminating passages in Abhinava’s commentary would be otiose. The translation is here for the reader to find them on his own. I would sum up my opinion of Abhinava’s work in the Locana by saying that he accomplishes ad­mirably what he set out to do. He expresses Änanda’s views more logically than Änanda expressed them; he defends them against those who had opposed them. Under the provocation of Bhattanäyaka he develops the concept of rasa into something different from what I be­lieve Änanda envisaged, but the new concept is more consistent than Ananda’s and was to become, after Mammata’s incorporation of it in his Kävyaprakäsa, the leading view of rasa in Indian criticism. More than all this, Abhinava’s analysis of Änanda’s examples will give the sensitive reader a hundred new insights into the beauty of Sanskrit poetry.There is nothing in our Western classical (Greek and Latin) tradition of criticism that corresponds to rasa and nothing that corresponds to dhvani in the grand dimensions in which Änanda and Abhinava con­ceived it. Our classical rhetoricians, all but one of them, chose the path that Bhämaha and Dandin chose: they included such instances of sug­gestion as they recognized in the tropes and figures of speech.32 One man of this tradition, however, the author of the treatise On the Sub­lime, had an uncanny skill at recognizing passages of literature which excite the reader or, as he put it, drive him to ecstacy. I have noticed that almost every instance of what pseudo-Longinus33 cites of what he calls “the sublime” in literature, is actually an instance of suggestion.31 Sanskrit dramaturgy speaks of the achievement of a result (phalayoga), it istrue. But the phalayoga, for example in the Täpasavatsaräja, namely Udayana’s retrieval of VSsavadattâ and acquisition of universal sovereignty, is aesthetically far less important than the recurring manifestations of srngârarasa throughout the play.33 In the Greek tpipaotc, the significano of the Rhetorica ad Herennium and of Quintilian, it is the figure itself that is usually striking. Only under irony and allegory does Greco-Latin rhetoric come to what would qualify with Änanda as dhvani, and at that only as vastudhvani.33 Manuscript P of the fit pi i/xliov, from which apparently all our texts descend, refers to him as “either Dionysios or Longinos.” He appears to have been a Jew and perhaps for that reason had no following among the Greek and Roman rhetoricians. His fame began only with the rediscovery of his work in Renaissance times."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"I translate here from just one of his instances, the famous paii/erai pot Kfjvoç ïooç Oioiaiv.He seems to me the equal of the gods who sits beside you, listening to your sweet speech closelyand to your lovely laughter,which has quickened the heart in my breast.When I see you, Brochea, my voice leaves me,my tongue is broken, a thin fire runs over my flesh, my eyes have no stren my ears ring.Longinus, if that was his name, says that the beauty of Sappho’s poem comes from its arrangement and that the result is the sublime. Änanda would have said that the beauty comes from dhvani and that the re­sult is srngärarasa. If only Longinus had had followers, they might have worked out a critique of literature not unlike that of Änanda and Abhinava.Introduction 39"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"TRANSLATION AND NOTES"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"CHAPTER ONEA Of Madhu’s foeincarnate as a lion by his will,may the claws, which put the moon to shamein purity and shape,by cutting off his devotees’ distressgrant you protection.11. In this benedictory verse which introduces his work Änandavardhana takes as subject an attribute of his chosen divinity (istadevatâ) Nrsimha, the man-lion incarnation of Visnu (Madhu’s foe). Visnu became incarnate as a man-lion in order to destroy the demon Hiranyakasipu and thereby remove the distress of the Vaisnava devotee Prahräda. For the story, see Bhäg.Pvr. 7.2-8. Benedictory verses to Nrsimha usually take his claws as their subject; see SRK 116, 128, 141. As is appropriate to a verse introducing a work on 'suggestion (dhvani), the present verse contains numerous instances of dhvani.

To “protect” is to furnish help toward attainment of a desired goal and that help comes about by such means as the opposing of hindrances. Such is the protection that is here meant.The heroic flavor (virarasa)* is here suggested by our apprehension of energy (utsäha), an apprehension furnished by the association of God, who is constantly exerting himself [on behalf of mankind], with the characteristics of clarity of purpose and diligent resolve. Again, as claws are weapons and as protection requires a weapon for instru­ment, the extraordinary power of these claws, which are identical with instruments, is suggested by treating them as agents.5 Also suggested6 is the absence of dependence on extraneous instruments on the part of God. The word “Madhuripu” conveys the fact that he is always active in removing whatever is a menace to men.7What sort of Madhuripu (“Madhu’s foe”)? “Incarnate as a lion by his own will,” not because he is subject to his earlier deeds (karma), nor to the will of another; rather, he took the form of a lion in conformity with his entertaining a desire to do so, a desire8 which is appropriate to the killing of a particular demon.What sort of claws? Those which “cut off his devotees’ distress.” The power to cut is appropriate to claws and while it is impossible for [ordinary] claws to cut away mental anguish, it becomes possible in the case of these claws because God’s creations are conformable to his desires. Or [we may take it as follows]: Hiranyakasipu was the thorn of the three worlds, a torment to everyone, and so in reality he himself was pain in concrete form to those who come to God as their sole refuge. When these claws destroyed him, it was the very pain (of God’s devotees] that was rooted out; so this shows how God, even in such a state9 (i.e., even while engaged in an act of destruction], is still exceptionally compassionate.Furthermore, the claws by their svaccha, that is, their property of being pure, their purity—for words like svaccha and mrdu in their44 [ § 1.1 Introduction L"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"45primary sense refer to abstract properties10—and by their shape, which is curved and lovely, have “shamed,” that is, have distressed, the moon. It is here suggested by a suggestion based on the power of meaning11 that the moon is new. By the moon’s being afflicted, it is suggested that it appears pale and devoid of charm in the presence of the claws; and it is generally well known that claws can cause pain. But in the case of the man-lion this property of causing pain has been presented in superhuman form [viz., by saying that His claws are pure and lovely although causing pain]. And so, when the new moon looks at the pu­rity and curved shape of these claws, he feels an inner pain [as follows): “Although I may be equal so far as purity and my curved shape go, these claws are skillful in removing the distress of devotees, whereas I am not.” In this manner the figure of speech known as contrast (vyati- reka)12 is suggested. “Moreover, in the past I alone was desirable to all people because I was possessed of unequalled clarity and beautiful shape, but- now all these ten claws have the same shape as the new moon and in addition to that they are skillful in removing both mental and physical pain and so now people regard them and not me with the respect due to the new moon.” Thinking in this manner, the new moon experiences, as it were, continual torment and so the two fig­ures of speech, fancy (utpreksä)13 and denial (apahnuti),1* have been suggested. Thus in this verse the three varieties of suggestion, namely vastudhvani, alankäradhvani, and rasadhvani, have been explained by my teacher. 1 21. The inner glory of literature is here derived from its three characteristic abilities: to create (prathayitum) new worlds; to impart a relish (sârayüum) to even the dullest objects in the actual world, so that they may elicit aes­thetic response (rosa); and to render both these areas bright (udbhdsayitum) with a beauty constructed out of the poet’s genius and the words with which he communicates. This much is a fine characterization. What is even finer in my opinion is Abhinava’s realization that the beauty of poetry, or of art in general, depends upon the audience as much as on the artist. One may find echoes of this verse in the benedictions of later critics. Compare, in Mammata’s benedictory verse to his Kdvyaprakâéa, niyamarahitdm with vini kdranakaldm of our verse, or navarasarucirdm with nijarasabharät särayati.2. Here the name of Anandavardhana’s work is given as “The Light of Poetry\" (Kävyäloka). Elsewhere Abhinava refers to it as the Sahrdaydloka-, see Intro­duction, p. 12. Abhinava gives to his own commentary the title “The Eye,” (locano) and by his words here indicates, according to the Kaumudi, that he will comment on only parts of the text, the parts that are difficult or subj t§ 1.1 Introduction L ]"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"46to doubt. In the fourth line of the vene, janasya is proleptic genitive: I shall explain “to the world.” 3. Abhinava attributes the introductory stanza to the author of the Vrtti, not the author of the Kärikäs. That the two were the same man has been argued in the Introduction, pp. 25-27. 4. BP notes thatas Änandavardhana proposes to show that suggestion is the soul of poetry, his introductory verse might naturally be supposed to contain suggestions; accordingly, Abhinava points out the three types of suggestions which it con­tains, beginning with the most important type, rasadhvani. For the technical terms rosa, sthäyibhäva, vibhäva, anubhäva, and vyabhicänbhäva, see Intro­duction. Abhinava here discovers a suggestion of the heroic rasa. Of its com­ponents he points out the sthäyibhäva as the utsäha (energy) of Nrsimha. For utsäha as the sthäyibhäva of virarasa see BhNÉ 6.67. The älambana-vibhäva of course is Nrsimha himself. The vyabhicäribhävas are given by Abhinava as the god’s asammoha (clarity of purpose) and adhyavasäya (diligent re­solve). According to BP, God’s constantly exerting himself (nityodyogitva) is the anubhäva. 5. The point is this. Usually the karana (instrument) and the kartr (agent) are kept distinct and given different case endings. Nakha is usually a karana, the means of accomplishing something, and not a kartr. Now a kartr is the chief of all the kärakas-, all other kärakas are dependent (svatantrah kartä). Therefore by presenting the nakhas themselves as the agent, that is, by placing nakhäh in the nominative instead of the instru­mental case, the extraordinary power of these claws is suggested. This is an instance of vastudhvani. 6. Dhvanitas ca refers to a second vastudhvani. 7. Tasya sadaiva jagatträsa, etc., is the third vastudhvani. Abhinava has used the word ukta here to mean sücita. Kaumudï, p. 19: vyahjita iti vak- tavye sati ukta iti vacanam abhidhävyäpäragocaravat prakatapratipattikatvam vyahgyärthasya pradarsayitum-, that is, ukta has been used in order to show that the matter is as clear as if it were conveyed by abhidhä itself. 8. In the long compound visistadänava-... I have taken the word ucita to modify icchä; it might equally well modify parigraha. The point is that the form of a man-lion was required for the slaying of this particular demon, who could not be slain by a god, a man, or an animal. Had Visnu wished to slay an­other demon, he would have wished for some other form. 9. Tasyäm apy avasthäyäm means that he is compassionate even when he is engaged in the act of killing. This is Abhinava’s interesting explanation of the apparent con­tradiction in a verse like ksipto hastävalagnah (2.5 c A), where it would appear that Siva is being cruel. Abhinava would argue that he is really acting out of compassion since he is acting for the sake of the world, not for the sake of killing.10. It is a doctrine of the grammarians that adjectives (like éukla ‘‘white’’ ) denote primarily a quality (e.g., suklatä “whiteness”). Only secondarily do they come to denote a substance qualified by a quality (as in “a white horse”). See Pataiijali on Pan. 2.1.30. Accordingly, Abhinava is here analysing the[ § 1.1 Introduction L"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"47compound as “pained by their pure-ness and by their own (curved and lovely) shape,” rather than taking svaccila to modify svacchäyä. 11. This is an­other case of vastudhvani. The idea that the moon is new, i.e., at its most beautiful, on the first day of its appearance as a slender crescent, is not con­veyed by slesa and so is not an example of suggestion based on the power of a word. It is conveyed by the meaning of the words and so is an instance of arthasaktimüladhvani (suggestion based on the power of meaning). See 2.20 K. 12. This is the first of the three cases of alankäradhvani discov­ered by Abhinava in the verse. For definitions of vyatireka see Bhämaha 2.75, Dandin 2.180, Al.Sarv. p. 101. In vyatireka the upameya (the thing itself) is usually shown to be superior in some respect to the upamäna (the thing to which it is likened); for example, “her face by being spotless puts to shame the moon with its spot.\" 13. For utpreksä see Bhämaha 2.91, Dandin 2.221, Al.Sarv. p. 69. In utpreksä the possibility which one fancies is usually in cold fact an impossibility. It is of course impossible that anything should pain or shame the moqn, for the moon is an insentient obj t. 14. For apahnuti see Bhämaha 3.21, Dandin 2.304, Al.Sarv. p. 63. Bhämaha's example is: “The bee is not buzzing; this is the sound of Love’s bow.\" In Ananda’s verse the suggested apahnuti would take the form: “People deny me the status of new moon and look only on these claws in that way.” Note that all these figures in the present stanza are suggested, not directly conveyed. Thus they are examples of alankäradhvani.S 1-1 K]K Some have said that the soul of poetry, which has been handed down from the past by wise men as “suggestion” (dhvani),* 1 does not exist; others, that it is an associated meaning (bhâkta);2 while some have said that its nature lies outside the scope of speech: of this (sug­gestion] we shall here state the true nature in order to delight the hearts of sensitive readers.1. The key word of the book, dhvani, is used in many different senses. Of the senses used by literary critics, as opposed to the grammarians (for whom see 1.131 A and L) Abhinava specifies the following (1.13 L): (o) éabdah: a word which gives rise to a suggestion; (b) arthah: a meaning which gives rise to a suggestion; (c) vyäpärah: the operation, the suggesting of the implicit meaning; (d) vyahgyam: the suggested meaning itself; (e) samudäyah: the"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"48group; or a poem which embodies all the above factors. K and A restrict the senses of the word to (c), (<f), and (e) and, wherever they would be precise, specify that the suggestion involved must be the primary suggestion of the sentence. It is not immediately clear in which sense K is here using the word. The Vrtti in setting forth the first argument (1.1a A) seems to take it in sense (c) or (d). In the second argument (1.1 b A) it clearly takes it in sense (e). 2. Änanda uses the word bhâkta to cover both types ofsecondary or associated meaning: the metaphorical (which Abhinava calls gauna), as in ‘The boy is a lion,” where “lion” takes on secondary sense because of the boy’s similarity in some respects to a lion, and the relational (which Abhinava calls läksanika), as in “Bring in the spears,” where “spears” is used for “spearmen\" because of some relation other than similarity between the two objects. Ananda’s general words for secondary usage or the secondary operation of a word are bhakti and gunavrtti. In 3.33 h Änanda distinguishes the two types of gunavrtti as upacâra (metaphorical) and laksanä (relational). For making this distinction Abhinava prefers the terms gauni and läksanikC He uses the words laksanä often and gunavrtti occasionally in a very general sense for any sort of secondary operation.l § 1.1 *A By wise men, that is, by those who know the essence of poetry named “suggestion” (dhvani), which has been handed down from the past through a succession [of wise men], that is to say, has been made fully known far and wide:1 this [entity], in spite of its being clearly apparent to the hearts of sensitive readers, some have claimed to be non-existent.The following alternative ideas are possible for those who deny the existence of suggestion.1. In glossing samämnäta, A takes sam to mean samyak, “fully, thor­oughly”; and he takes ä to mean samantät, “far and wide.” One can harmo­nize this interpretation with the verse at the end of 3.33 p A by supposing that it had been long held by some critics that suggestion was the finest part of po­etry but that suggestion had nevertheless been aviditasattvah, “not precisely understood.”L [Commentary on the Kärikä:] Now the author states directly the nature of the subject matter [viz., suggestion, the soul of poetry], making it the predominant element of his sentence. Through a sub­ordinate element of the sentence [“to delight the hearts of sensitive readers”] he states directly the purpose of the purpose of the book [the"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"49purpose of the book is “knowledge of the nature of dhvani” ; the purpose of attaining this purpose is “to delight the hearts of sensitive readers”]. By implication he shows us the purpose of the book, that purpose being connected [with the second purpose].1 Thus he says, “(some have said that] the soul of poetry,” etc.[Commentary on the Vrtti:\\ In view of the proximity of the term “soul of poetry,” the term “wise men” in the verse must be taken in the sense of those who give instruction in the soul of poetry. With this in mind, he explains “wise men” by those w ho know th e essence of poetry. Explaining the meaning of the word “soul” by the word “essence,” he shows the prime importance of suggestion and the fact that what it produces lies far beyond the reach of other word-powers [namely, the literal and the secondary].It may be objected that the word iti refers to the phonetic form of the word dhvani,2 for the denotandum of the word cannot be the referent as this is still a matter of controversy and has not yet been decided. He explains away this difficulty by the word nam ed. In truth the word dhvani has not been used [in the Kärikä] as a mere name; rather there is a thing called by the name of dhvani and it is the essence of all poetry, for otherwise the wise would not have taken pains to hand down a mere name. Thus he will go on to explain, “in spite of its being clearly apparent to the minds of sensitive readers.” But the following is a better explanation. The word iti is used out of normal order. It must refer to the sense of the clause as a whole [and not to the word dhvani alone]. So we should construe the clause as follows: “The thing, namely dhvani, which has been traditionally called the soul of poetry.” For if the word iti referred only to the word dhvani, how could we reconcile this with the commentary’s speaking of a thing named dhvanil For if that were the case [i.e., if iti governed the word dhvani alone], we should have to understand that “the word dhvani is also the soul of poetry,” as when we say, “He says ‘ox’.”3 That which has no reality [viz., a mere name] cannot be a matter of controversy. Only when a thing (dharmin) exists [distinct from its name], do its properties become a matter of controversy. But now enough elaborating on an irrelevant topic that will only annoy sensitive readers.Should only one scholar have made such a statement [viz., that sug­gestion is the soul of poetry], it is possible that he could have been mistaken, but that is not likely where many have been involved. Ac­cordingly, [the Kärikä] uses the plural: “wise men.” [The commentator] expatiates on the matter: through a succession. That is, they have§ 1.1 L]"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"said this in an unbroken succession, without, however, putting it down in specific books. This is what he means. For many scholars could not teach, with great respect, something that really did not merit such respect. And this they did teach with respect. Therefore [the Kärikä] says “which has been handed down from the past,” for the phrase “from the past” shows that one should not imagine this to be the first mention of dhvani. And [the commentator] explains by saying: this [entity] has been m ade fully known far and wide.How can one entertain the thought that an entity which one should strive to understand can be non-existent? What can one say? The sense is that those who deny its existence exhibit an extraordinary stupidity. Also [it is implied by the author of the Kärikä that] he has not actually heard the alternative ideas of those who deny the existence of suggestion; rather he will imagine such ideas and then refute them. Hence [his use of the perfect tense (jagaduh.), which implies] absence of direct perception [by the subject of the verb].4 [He could not have used the future tense, as] it is not proper to re­fute something that is in the future, for the simple reason that it is not yet there. If it be argued that a hypothetical fact can be re­futed, we say that its futurity would be abrogated by its being [al­ready] hypothesized. Thus, because these views are imagined to be in the past, because they are beyond the range of direct perception, and because they have not been specifically characterized as belong­ing to present time, the perfect tense can be used. Accordingly, the alternative views will first be imagined and then refuted. But even in imagining something, it is improper to imagine an implausible thing; one should imagine only a plausible thing. Otherwise there would be no end to the products of imagination and their refutation. And so, in order to give substance to these hypotheses, to be stated presently, he has said in advance that they are possible. Had the term “are hypothesized” (sambhävyante) been used, there would be tautology [in the use of the optative of hypothesis in what follows]. And what is possible is not only hypothesized here but appears to him clearly as a present reality; hence his use of the present tense [in “they are possible”].Fearing that someone might object that it is impossible to criticize that which has been predicated by a hypothesis based on something impossible, he says, “ideas” ( vikalpäh). There is no real thing to which these hypotheses refer; they are merely ideas.5 Furthermore, they might have occurred through an ignorance of the true nature [of poetry]; and[ S 1-1 L"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"51so he uses optative forms like äcaksiran which refer to possibilities and here amount to a reference to past time [i.e., “'they might have said”]. The same usage can be instanced in the following verse:If what is within the body had been outside, people would need take sticks to drive off dogs and crows.®The meaning is that if the body had been visible in such a way, such [a result] would appear. The sense of past time is here implied. The same in the following [negative condition]:[But] if it were not thus, what would be the case?7The meaning is: what would be the case if there had been no hypothesis as above of [the body’s] being (inside out]? Here we have the same [preterite] sense. But now enough of dilating upon an irrelevant topic.Here in brief are the vikalpas, the alternative ideas, that might be put forward against the concept of dhvani. (1) Words transmit mean­ings because of the conventions (samaya) which we have assigned to them. Accordingly, there can be no suggested sense over and above the denoted senses [which we have assigned]. Or, (2) granted that there are extra senses, such a sense will be implied by the denotative opera­tion and will be merely an associated sense (bhäkta) since it has been drawn into our mind by force of the understood meaning of the word. Ór, (3) the suggested sense is not implied in this way, but is impossi­ble to describe, just as the happiness of having a husband cannot be described to virgins who have not experienced it. These are the three main varieties of disagreement [with our doctrine]. But of them, the argument that the suggested sense does not exist may be divided into three sub-arguments. The first of these may be put thus, (a) As it is the qualities (gunas)6 and figures of speech (alaiikäras) that impart beauty to words and their senses, and as a poem consists of words and senses which are more beautiful than those used in conversation or in scientific works, there can be no source of beauty of which we have not already taken account [in our definitions of the qualities and the figures of speech]. The second is this. (b) Whatever we have not taken into account is not a cause of beauty. [Now the third:] (c) If suggestion is a source of beauty, it must fall under either the qualities or the figures of speech, in which case it shows no great scholarship to give it another name; while if it is not actually included in the qualities or figures,§ 1.1 I ]"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"52still it will be only by reference to some minute differentiation that you give it another name, such differentiation being possible because of the endless varieties of loveliness in simile. The fact remains that suggestion is not really outside the area of the qualities and figures of speech. By giving it a new name what have you accomplished? It is always possible to imagine a new shade of beauty. For we see that the ancients, such as the sage Bharata, accepted only two figures of speech, the yamaka9 for sound and the simile for meaning. What later writ­ers on poetics have done is only to show the direction in which these figures are to be multiplied [by giving independent names to the differ­ent forms of strikingness which they possess). Suppose a man, familiar with the grammatical rule karmany an (Pan. 3.2.1) and hearing such examples as kumbhakâra “pot-maker,” were to invent such a word as nagarakära “city-maker,” would it not be foolish for him to feel proud on this account? The same principle applies to the topic under discus­sion. This then is the third subvariety. And so, the first view having three subvarieties and being joined to the other two [major views], we get five alternative views in all. Such is the overall meaning.I. Abhinava here examines 1.1 K for information on the anubandhas, those “pertinent points” concerning a work which commentators on Sanskrit philosophical texts always try to make clear, for it is by them that an intelli­gent man will decide whether or not to study the text; see also 1.1 e L, p. 69. The traditional anubandhas are four: abhidheya, prayojana, sambandha, and adhikâra. Abhinava finds the abhidheya “the subject to be treated” clearly expressed in the subject of the sentence, viz., “the soul of poetry called ‘sug­gestion’.” The prayojana “purpose” of the work, he states, is given only by implication. It is of course “knowledge of the nature of suggestion,” as implied by the statement, in a subordinate clause, of the purpose of the purpose, as this is “connected with the purpose.” We take the reading of both Chowkhamba and Kashi editions tatsambaddham prayojanam ca. The Kaumudî, wishing to bring in a third anubandha, reads tatsambandham pra­yojanam ca and supposes that sambandha refers to the connection between the subject and the purpose. One may add to Abhinava’s information that the adhikära “the qualification required of the reader” is that he be a “sen­sitive reader.” 2. The difficulty which Abhinava here discusses arises from the placement of the word iti in the verse and from the gloss sanjnita in the Vrtti. The word iti functions like quotation marks in English to shift the denotandum from thing to word. An ox (gauh) is an animal; “ox” (gaur iti) is a word, beginning with ‘o’ in English and with ‘g’ in Sanskrit. This shi ing power (viparyâsakarana) of the word iti is often noticed by the grammarians; cf. Nyàsa on Käi. 1.1.44 and on 1.1.66. Now if we take 1.1 K to mean that[ § 1.1 L"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"wise men have called the soul of poetry “suggestion,\" but some have said that it does not exist, we are in danger of making the verse say that “some have said that the word ‘suggestion’ does not exist,” which is nonsense. So Abhinava first claims that dhvanir iti means more than just the word. Next he gives a better explanation, namely that the word iti is out of place. It really goes with kävyasyätmä, the sense being, “wise men have said, ‘dhvani is the soul of poetry.’ \" A more radical solution of the difficulty would be to change the wording of the verse. Mahimabhatta suggests changing the first line to read: kävyasyätmety amalamatibhir yo dhvanir näma gitah ( Vyakti- viveka, p. 397). This would be in fact a considerable improvement. 3. See Mahäbhäsya 1.1.44, Vàri. 3. 4. The perfect tense is to be used for an actin past time which one has not directly perceived (parokse lit, Pan. 3.2.115). The remarks which follow are occasioned by Abhinava’s desire to reconcile the perfect tense (jagadvh) used by the Kärikä with the optative (âcaksïran) about to be used by the author of the Vrtti (beginning of 1.1 a .4). He claims that the perfect is used in strict accordance with Pânini’s prescription to re­fer to past time which has not been directly experienced and he will claim of the optative that it here refers to past time rather than present (“might have said\" rather than “might say”). Such an interpretation of the optative is grammatically justifiable, for Käs. on Pan. 3.3.154 states that in an hy­pothesis the optative shall take precedence over all other tenses and moods (sarvalakäränäm apavädah). If the author of the Kärikä actually had heard the criticisms of dhvani, he should have used the form agadan (imperfect) rather than jagadvh. Abhinava is so little interested in the historical data on which the Kärikä and the commentator based their criticism that he is willing for the sake of justifying a grammatical inflection to deny that such data ever existed. And yet later (1.1 c L) he will speak of Manoratha, who ridiculed the concept of dhvani, as having been a contemporary of Änandavardhana. It seems to me that Abhinava’s strict grammatical interpretation of the perfect tense is here quite misguided and that Kärikä and commentary are both refer­ring to views which their author had actually read or heard expressed. 5. If someone says “the flowers that grow in the sky are red,” an opponent cannot validly criticise him by saying that the flowers that grow in the sky are not red; but he can criticise the idea as a whole by saying that flowers do not grow in the sky. 6. The verse is a paraphrase of Brh.Ar.Up. 3.9.25. Sanskrit makes no formal distinction between past time and present in conditions expressed by the optative (see note 4 above). So Abhinava is grammatically justified in taking the optative inflection here to refer to past time. He has thus rec­onciled the tense used by the Kärikä with the mood used by the Vrttikära. 7. uYadi na syät tatah kim syät” forms another quarter-verse that follows the half-verse just quoted. Abhinava forces the same preterite interpretation upon the condition. The moral of the three quarter-verses taken together, according to BP, is this. If one were to imagine the body’s being constructed"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"54inside out, one would be disgusted by the thought of dogs and crows rushing toward such filth. But even without such a repulsive hypothesis “the body remains a disgusting collection useful only for the pursuit of worthless sense enjoyments.” 8. See below, 2.6. 9. See below, 2.15 K, note 1.[§ 1.1 iA Here some might contend1 that poetry is nothing more than what is embodied in word and meaning.2 The means of beautifying this pair that lie in sound, such as alliteration, and those that lie in meaning, such as simile, are well known. Also well known are [those qualities] such as sweetness, which possess certain properties of phoneme and arrangement.3 The vrttis* which have been described by some writers under such names as upanâgarikâ, and which are not different in func­tion from these [figures and qualities5] also have reached our ears. So also the styles (ritis) such as the Vaidarbhl.6 What is this thing called dhvani that it should differ from these?1. Abhinava interprets as referring to past time: “some might have con­tended”; see 1.1 L, note 4. 2. See Bhâmaha 1.16, Dandin 1.10, Vämana 1.1,and compare the opening of the Raghuvamsa: vägarthäv iva samprktau. 3 .1 follow the reading of the Kashi Sk. Ser. edition: varnasahghatanädharmäd co. Abhinava, the Kaumudi, and Krishnamoorthy’s MS MB drop the word varna. My preference is based on the following consideration. The old view of the qualities mädhurya, ojas, etc., was that they were based solely on the choice of certain phonemes [varna) and certain degrees of compounding (sanghatanä). Änanda will insist later in this book (2.7) that factors of meaning must also be taken into account. Here, however, where he is giving the obj tion of an old-fashioned opponent of dhvani, it is likely that he would give it in the old-fashioned terms. But Abhinava, noticing the discrepancy with Änanda’s later pronouncement, would have been glad to drop the word varna. By do­ing so he could supply uéabdârthayoh,” thus making the qualities depend on both sound and meaning. For the technical term sanghatanä (arrangement, texture), see 3.5 K and 3.5 A, note 1. 4. The word vrtti, literally mannerof employment or place of employment, bears two different technical mean­ings in this book, the one derived from Udbhata, the other from BhNÉ. The word is here used in Udbhata’s sense, who applies this term (Induraja 1.7) to the three varieties of simple alliteration, that is, to what later writers call"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"55vrttyanvpräsa. He calls the three types parusâ (harsh), vpanâgarikà (polite), and grämyä (rustic or vulgar). He calls the third type also komalä (soft). For further details see 1.1a L and note 4. On the other hand, BhNÉ applies the term vrtti to four modes of gesture and speech [BhNÉ 18.7 and 20.8ff.); see below, 3.6 g L, and note 1, as also 3.33 K and A. 5. As will be seen from L, the vrttts are not different from the figure alliteration, while the styles (rf/i) are not different from the qualities sweetness, etc. 6. Three styles [riti), to which are given the geographical names Vaidarbhï, Gaudi, and Pâncâlî, are described by Dandin 1.40ff. Dandin assigns all the good qualities of poetry to Vaidarbhï, which he further characterizes as employing few compounds and avoiding harsh sounds. In these last two respects the Gaud! style is its op­posite, while the Pâncâlî lies intermediate between the two. The differentia are similar to those used by Udbhata in distinguishing the three vrttis. But the evaluation was different. Udbhata regarded the intermediate vrtti as best, whereas Dandin chose as best the soft riti. The concept of riti was emphasized by Vämana to the'point of calling riti the soul of poetry (1.2.6ff.). On riti in general see P. C. Lahiri, Concepts of Riti and Guna in SaJiskrit Poetics.§ 1.1a L\\L He now describes these views in sequence. N othing m ore th an w hat is em bodied in sound and m eaning: By saying ilnoth- ing more” he shows that no one will object [to this definition]. Now this sound and meaning themselves cannot be dhvani, for what ad­vantage would arise merely from giving them an extra name? But perhaps you suppose that dhvani refers to some special beauty of the sound or meaning. Very well; we may speak of two sorts of beauty: the beauty of a thing in itself and the beauty that arises from its ar­rangement (saiighatanä). Of these sorts, the beauty that belongs to the sounds themselves derives from the figures of sound [such as allit­eration], while that which arises from their arrangement derives from the qualities [gunas) of words [when they are so juxtaposed as to pro­duce sweetness, harshness, etc.]. So also of the meanings: the beauty in themselves derives from such figures as simile, while the beauty that arises from their arrangement derives from the qualities of meanings. So there is no such thing as dhvani distinct from the figures and qualities.W hich possesses certain properties of arrangem ent:1 that is, arrangement of sound or meaning. The proof by negative probans will run thus: Whatever is other than the figures and qualities is not a cause of beauty, as for example the absolute faults such as solecism and the relative faults such as harshness;2 and dhvani [you say] is a source of beauty; therefore, dhvani is not other than the figures and qualities."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"56To this argument it might be replied: Just as the vrttis and the styles (rites) are distinct from the figures and qualities and at the same time are causes of beauty, so it may be that dhvani is distinct and is also a cause of beauty. It is with this reply in mind that he [who denies the existence of dhvani] continues: the vrttis also ... which are not different in function from these. It has not been proved that the vrttis and styles are distinct from the figures and qualities. For it is merely three types of alliteration that are called by the name vrtti in order to group these alliterations under three broad classes to be distin­guished as harsh (parasi), graceful (Ialiti), and intermediate, so called because of their utility in describing three types of subject matter, namely that which is fiery (dipta); smooth (masrna), or intermediate. [The literal sense of the word vrtti is that] the alliterations occur (vrt) in these forms. As has been said [by Udbhata, Indarija 1.7, Vivrti 1.12]: “The wise hold that alliteration (anuprisa) is the placing of homoge­neous consonants, separately for each separate class, in these three ways (vrtti).” “Separately for each separate class”: thus, harsh alliteration is the nigariki (citified) vrtti; smooth alliteration is the upanigariki (polite), so called on the analogy of a sophisticated lady of the city (ni- gariki)-,3 the intermediate variety is between gentle and harsh; such is the sense: it is called grim yi (rustic, vulgar) on the analogy of a coun­try woman, who lacks sophistication and is neither gentle nor harsh by nature. The third of these varieties is also called komalinuprisa.* Thus the vrttis are simply classes of alliteration. We are not using the word ■vrtti here in the sense in which the Vaisesika philosophers use it, for [by Vaisesika rules] there could be no occurrence (vartaminatva) of a member in its class;5 all that is meant is that the alliteration functions by means of such and such a vrtti. Just as it is said: “Kings function (variante) on a plane of insight above that of common mortals.”So the vrttis do not act as anything other than alliteration. They have no extra function; and as they have no separate function, they should not be counted separately. Thus we see that in the compound anatiriktavrttayah the meaning of the word vrtti is function (vyipira). It is because the vrttis are nothing other [than alliteration] thatJBhä- maha and others made no mention of them. Although Udbhata and others did mention them, they nevertheless convey no additional mean­ing (beyond that of alliteration] to our minds. It is with this thought that he says have reached o ur ears.®So also th e styles (riti): One is to construe these words (with the preceding sentence] thus: So also the styles, which are not different in[ § 1.1a L"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"57function from these, have reached our ears. The word “these” [as here supplied7] refers to the qualities. Now in giving the appropriate uriti to a passage8 these gunas may be combined, through their capability of mixing with one another, in the form of a texture (sahghatana), just as the tastes of sugar, pepper, and the like may be combined in a drink. Such a combination is called a riti. It is of three sorts, as it applies to a subject matter that is fiery, or delicate, or something intermediate, in accordance with what we see to be most eagerly sought in the country of Gauda, or Vidarbha, or Pancäla. The class is here not different from its members and the whole is not different from its components. So the vrttis and styles are not different from the figures and qualities; and the negative probans [which we just gave] is valid.So he says: w hat is this thing called dhvani th a t it should be different from these? It is not a substrate of beauty, as it is neither in the form of sóund or meaning. Nor is it a cause of beauty, as it is other than a figure of speech or a quality. If we examine poetry analytically, despite the fact that it should be appreciated synthetically,9 even so we find no distinct thing which can be called dhvani. He says as much by using the phrase “this thing called” dhvani. 11. Abhinava omits the term varna (phoneme) in the compound varna- sanghatanädharmäh. 2. The faults (dosas) have been treated by almost every Sanskrit literary critic. For accounts in English, see Raghavan, Bhoja's ÉP., pp. 203-243, and Krishnamoorthy, “Doctrine of Dosas,” IHQ 20.217-232. The distinction of nityä dosäh, usages which are always faulty, i.e., absolute faults, from anityä dosäh, usages which are faulty only in certain contexts,i.e., relative faults, is known to Änanda (see 2.11 below). An example of the latter type is harshness, which is reprehensible in a passage of love but may be praiseworthy in a passage of heroism or cruelty. 3. Abhinava takes the term (by Saunäga Värttikä 7, see Mahäbhäsya 2.2.18) as nägarikayä vidagdhayä upamitä: given its simile by, i.e., similar to, a nägarikä, that is, a sophisticated lady. The same explanation was given by Induraja on Udbhata 1.5 and is grammatically unexceptionable. But it leaves us wondering why the harsh variety of vrtti should be called nägarikä, a term not found in Udbhata and which seems to originate with Abhinava. To that the Kaumudi says that the harsh variety is like a city lady in brilliant costume. 4. It will be seen that Abhinava has changed the distribution as given by Udbhata. Udbhata gives three vrttis: (1) harsh, which alliterates by means of s, s, the retrofiexes, and certain harsh conjuncts; (2) upanägarikä, which alliterates by means of the stops other than the retrofiexes and by conjuncts of which the first member is a nasal; and (3) vulgar (grämyä) or soft (komalä), which alliterates by means of the remaining consonants, i.e., the semivowels and h. Obviously his vrttis are§ 1.1a L]"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"58ordered according to a decreasing degree of harshness. What is reprehensible in the third type is its excessive softness or liquidity. But Abhinava wants to harmonize the three vritis with the three ritis given by Dandin and Vämana. Accordingly, he keeps the first vrtti as harsh, makes the second vrtti soft, and makes the third vrtti a mixture of the two. He is left with the contradiction that the third, mixed, vrtti bears the traditional name of komalä (soft). The commentators (BP and Kaumudx) are forced to say that the term komalä is here rüdhä, i.e., used without regard to its etymological meaning. Such was Abhinava’s authority, however, that his scheme is followed by Mammata (9.80 and cf. 8.74-75) and other later authors. 5. Udbhata had said that alliteration occurs in three vrttis, to which Abhinava has added the statement that these three vrttis are classes (varga). Now in the Vaisesika system a member cannot occur (vartate) in its class; the class occurs in, or inheres in. its members. So it is necessary to specify that “alliteration occurs in a given vrtti” means simply that it functions in a certain way. 6. That is, these terms have reached our ears but not our minds. 7. When the compound tadanatiriktavrttayah explicity modifies the word vrttayah, one will take tad to refer to the figure anuprâsa. When the compound is supplied as a modifier of ritayah, the tad will refer to the gunas. 8. samucitavrttyarpane: Abhinava’s conception seems to be that a combination of gunas, say of mädhurya and prasäda, transfers to a particular vrtti. say the vpanägarikä vrtti, its ability to express an appropriate rasa, say, snigära. The word yad which follows in the sentence modifies sanghätarüpatägamanam. 9. The notion that the äsväda of poetry is akhanda belongs really to the siddhàntin, to Abhinava himself. The idea might have been borrowed from Bhartrhari, who says that we understand the sense of a phrase without analysing or dividing it, but as an indivisible whole. We achieve this by means of pratibhd. See Väkyapadiya, ed. Abhyankar and Limaye, 2.143-147 and Filliozat, p. xviii.[ § 1.1a LA Others might say: There is no such thing as dhvani.1 For a type of poetry that falls outside our well-known system would no longer be poetry. The correct definition of poetry is that which consists of sounds and meaning which delight the heart of a sensitive audience. To a method which differs from the system which has been laid down this [definition] is inapplicable. Moreover, if you were to confer the title of “sensitive audience” on some few persons who belong to your"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"59§ 1.1b I ]persuasion and on that basis assign to dhvani the title of poetry, you would not thereby gain the assent of the general body of educated men.1. Here used to mean a type of poetry; see 1.1 K. note 1.L Now it might be granted that dhvani does not consist of sound or meaning; furthermore that it is not a cause of their beauty; and yet it exists and for the aforesaid reason is different from the figures of speech and the qualities. In order to combat such a position the author introduces a second type of persons who deny the existence of dhvani: others.(Others might say:] It may well be (that such a thing as dhvani exists, distinct from the figures and qualities]. But this dhvani is not such as you would have it in your definition. For you were going to speak of something related to poetry; and this [dhvani] is no more related to poetry than are dancing and singing and instrumental music. Poetry must be spoken; therein lies its nature. One cannot claim that dancing and singing are spoken.W ell-known: The well-known system is one of sound and meaning and of the figures and qualities. ‘'System\" means the path which people follow in a continuous tradition. T ype of p oetry: this method of yours is intended by you to be a type of poetry, for you have called it “the soul of poetry.” Why is it not poetry? Because of the definition. ! of a sensitive audience.” To a m ethod: what he means is such a method as is used in dancing, singing, motion of the eyes, etc. This: supply “definition” [viz., that which consists of sounds and meanings which delight the heart] of a sensitive audience.Now it might be argued that the only sensitive auditors are those who recognize this novel form of poetry; and as that which lies outside [the well-known system] is approved by them, it may well serve as a definition of poetry. With this in mind he says, m oreover. The case is similar to a mam’s saying, “I will define a sword” and proceeding to do so as follows. “A sword has length and breadth, it can be worn, it covers the whole body, it is soft, it is woven of variegated threads, it can be spread out or rolled up. it cannot cut. but can itself be cut. This is the best kind of sword.” Then when someone objects that he has described a cloth, not a sword, he says. “This is what I consider to be a sword.” Just so is this [definition you are giving of dhvani]. What the author means is that what we define should be what it is known to"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"be, not a figment of the imagination. So he says, th e general body o f educated m en. As a few educated men might hold this strange opinion, he rules them out by saying “the general body.” For even should a few hold it, what difference does it make? It merely proclaims their insanity. This is his meaning.Another commentator has taken this passage otherwise. He would have the denier of dhvani to argue thus. “What you recognize is a dhvani that is the very life of poetry. Now such a life of poetry lies outside our well-known system because it has not been mentioned by the experts on the figures of speech. Furthermore, this word dhvani is not an accepted term for poetry in common usage.”1 This interpretation runs counter to everything the text has said. For if dhvani as a vivifying principle of poetry is admitted by the denier of dhvani, the fact that it has not been mentioned by the ancients should rather be a reason for now defining it. Therefore, the meaning should be taken as we have taken it above.1. This interpretation is simpler than Abhinava’s. It amounts to this. The first argument of the dAvam-deniers was against dhvani as the content of poetry or as the cause of the beauty in poetry. This second argument is against dhvani as the highest type of poetry itself. Dhvani is not that, because the ancients made no mention of it as such and because people do not commonly use the word dhvani in that sense. Such an interpretation is too simple for Abhinava, for it would leave the proponent of dhvani with the reply: “That the ancients failed to notice this type of poetry is all the more reason why it should now be defined.\"60 [ § 1.1 b £A Still others might argue for its non-existence in another way. Dhvani simply cannot be something entirely new because, being some­thing that falls within the area of beauty, it must be included in the means of beautifying poetry that have been mentioned [in earlier works on poetics). It is trivial to single out one of these means and merely give it a new name. Moreover, as the possibilities of speech are lim­itless, there may well be some small variety that has not been dealt ith by the well-known compilers of definitions for poetry.1 Even so,"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"61we cannot see any justification here [for the proponents of dhvani] to close their eyes in the fond imagination that they are sensitive critics and to dance about chanting udhvani, dhvani.” Others, great men too, have shown in the past different varieties of beauty in poetry2 by the thousand sind continue to do so.3 But we do not find them acting in this indecorous fashion. As a matter of fact, dhvani is mere prattle. It is simply not possible to put forward anything as a definition of dhvani that can bear critical examination. In this vein someone4 has written a verse on the matter:A fool will take a poem that has no contentto make the heart rejoice, no ornament,no words to show the author’s skill,no striking turn of speech:and tell you with delightthat this same poem is full of dhvani.If you who are wise should ask him, I am sure he could not tell you what this dhvani is.§ 1.1c L ]1. What are meant are those who have defined the figures of sound and meaning, the qualities and styles, e.g., Dandin, Bhämaha, and Vämana.2. Alankâra here does not mean specifically a figure of speech, but rather beauty of poetry in general. Ci. the opening of Vâmana’s KA: kävyam grähyam aîankârât, and the second sütra: saundaryam alankârah and its vrtti: karanavyutpattyà panar alankärasabdo 'yam upamädisu variate. 3. Cf.dandin 2.1: te cädyäpi vUcalpyante kas tän kärtsnyena vaksyati. 4. Ac­cording to Abhinava (see below) the author of the verse was Manoratha.L But suppose that dhvani is a cause of beauty and that it can be included under the figures or qualities either of sound or sense; still, this entity has not been spoken of as “dhvani,” nor has anyone heretofore spoken of it as the life (of poetry]. In order to combat such a position, the author now introduces a third variety of those who deny the existence of dhvani: still others.“Beauty” (kâmanïyaka) is the passive abstract of “beautiful” (kä- manïya),1 i.e., the source of our notion of cärutva (dearness, beauty).But now, as there is an endless number of charming things, [the pro­ponents of dhvani might argue that] they have discovered a certain charming thing that cannot be included under such [figures] as allit­eration, or under such [qualities] as sweetness, as defined by earlier"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"62writers. The opponent refutes this after first accepting it for the sake of argument: the possibilities of speech {vâc). Vâc can have any of three meanings: (1) that which expresses, namely a word; (2) that which is expressed, namely a meaning; or (3) that by which a meaning is expressed, namely the denotative function.2A sm all variety: for such a source of beauty will be either a quality or a figure of speech and so will be included under the general definition. As has been said: “The factors which make for beauty in poetry are the qualities. The figures are what add to this beauty.”3 Also: “An unusual or striking turn of word or meaning ( vakrokti) is considered an ornament of poetic utterances.”4Dhvani, dhvani: the repetition suggests the excitement [of the proponents of dhvani] and shows the awe [with which they regard their concept). D ance about: one may supply as subject “those who define dhvani, those who compose poems that use it, and those who experience a thrill on hearing it.”s Why, he means, should there be such reverence for this word “dhvani\"? D hvani is m ere p ra ttle: a general view, summing up all [three] positions of those who deny the existence of dhvani. It is mere prattle (1) because if it is a cause of beauty, it is not different from the figures and qualities; (2) because if it is different, it is not a cause of beauty; and (3) because even if it is a cause of beauty, it is not worthy of our serious attention [as it has already been included under the general definition of the figures and qualities). This is the meaning.Now this imagining of the position of those who deny dhvani cannot be charged with being [historically] baseless. Thus he says, in this vein som eone. The reference is to a poet named Manoratha who lived at the same time as the author of this book.6[To explain Manoratha’s verse:] As it has “no ornament,” therefore it does not “make the heart delight.” This shows that the poem lacks the figures of meaning [simile, etc.]. “No words to show the author’s skill”: this refers to the figures of sound [alliteration, yamaka]. “Striking turn of speech”: elevated style or arrangement (sanghatanâ). That it lacks this implies that it lacks the qualities of sound and meaning. Some have taken this phrase [viz., “no striking turn of speech”] to mean that since the poem lacks this general characteristic of the figures of speech, it must lack every figure.7 But by this interpretation one could not avoid involving the author in tautology. I shall not argue the point further. “With delight”- he means a passion for following by rote the example of others. “Who are wise”: for if a fool asked him,[ § 1.1c L"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"he could reply with such [silly gestures] as r rolling his eyes.8§ 1.1c L ]1. By Pan. 5.1.132 the suffix win (vrddhi + -aka) is added to certain noun stems in the sense of bhâva or karma. Such formations are nouns. Bhäva refers to a nominal abstract, the state of being beautiful; karma to a passive nominalisation, •‘that which has been beautified.” In English we may render both concepts as “beauty.” But note that in the phrase kätryasya kämaniyakam (the beauty of poetry) Abhinava takes vun specifically in the sense karmani. the whole word kämaniyakam denoting something that has been made beautiful. 2. Väc is here etymologized as the verbal root vac plus the null suffix kvip with irregular vrddhi by Unädisütra 225. Normally kvip is used actively, by Pan. 3.4.67: thus, vaktiti väk or ucyate ’nayeti väk. But by drawing down karmani from Pin. 3.2.1 it may be taken passively: uc- yata iti väk. 3. This is from Vimana’s Kävyälahkärasütra 3.1.1-2. Under guna Vamana includes the sabdagunas and the arthagunas, viz., ojas, prasäda. etc.: ye khalu sabdärthayor dharmäh kävyasobhäm kurvanti te gtinäh. Un­der alaiikära he includes the sabdälaiikäras and the arthälaiikäras: alankârâs ca yamakopamädayah. 4. Bhämaha 1.36. Vakrokti here has therefore a very general application, as it has in Dandin as well. See Dandin 2.363, Bhämaha 1.30. 1.34, and especially 2.85: saisi sarvaiva vakroktir anayär- tho vibhävyate / yatno ’syâm kavini kâryah ko ’lahkäro 'nayä vini. 5. It is not fully clear whether “it” (the tat in tac-chravana) refers to the po­em? that make use of dhvani or to the word udhvani\" itself. 6. Abhinava uses the term granthakrt (Kane, HSP, p. 156) as synonymous with vrttikära. He uses the term asmanmûlagmnthakrt for the author of the Kärikäs (ibid., p. 158). Thus, whether or not we suppose that he is following a tradition of dual authorship, we must charge him with here saying that Manoratha was a contemporary of Ànanda. For this error see Introduction, pp. 4, 9, 26-27. 7. This is certainly the more natural interpretation. 8. Cf. the similar pas­sage in Abhinava’s îévampmtyabhijhâwmarsinï, Vol. 2, 2.3, p. 91, where he refers to the Buddhist definition of pramäna: anyathä mukhabhaiigamürdha- kampängulimotanädimätratattvam tat."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"[ § l.ld AA “Others say that it is an associated meaning (bhäkta)” : others say that this soul of poetry which we call dhvani is [merely] secondary usage (gunavrtti).1 And although the authors of definitions for poetry have not given the specific name dhvani to secondary usage nor to any other sort of thing, still, in showing how secondary usage is employed in poetry, they have at least touched on the process of dhvani even if they have not actually defined it. It is with this in mind that [the Kärikä] states, \"Others say that it is an associated meaning.”1. See 1.1 K. note 2.L The [three] alternative views of the non-existence of dhvani were presented successively and not without connection of thought. That is why he used the phrase “still others” in introducing his de­scription of the third alternative; and [with this close connection] the unitary conclusion [viz., udhvani is mere prattle”] is in keeping. As the doctrine of the non-existence of dhvani is completely hypothetical, he used the perfect tense1 in reporting it. On the other hand, the view that dhvani is no more than an associated meaning can be found in written texts; and so he now employs a present tense: [others] say th a t it is an associated m eaning, using the present tense for the expression of that which takes place constantly.2[Abhinava now gives four different etymologies to explain the mean­ing of the word bhäkta.] (1) Bhakti (“association”) is a property that is associated (bhajyate), or is in company with,3 or is regarded [by the speaker] as commonly recognized in, a word-object [let us say, river-bank]—e.g., a property such as proximity to the direct object of the word [here, river]. Now the relational secondary sense (läksaniko ’rthah) that derives from [i.e., that is made possible by] this property is called the bhäkta (“associated”) meaning. [Thus, river-bank is an as­sociated or relational meaning of “river,” as may be seen in the phrase “a village on the river.”] As has been said,Laksanä (secondary usage) is held to be of five sorts, as it is based on the proximity of the secondary object to the direct object, on its similarity to it, its involvement i it, its opposition to it, or its being connected with the same tivity.4"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"§ 1.1 d L](2) Bhakti (“portion”) is a portion (bhäga) of the meaning of such a word as is used of a group of properties, e.g., the portion of the word “lion” that means fierceness. Now a metaphorical meaning (gauno 'rthah)5 that arises thus is called a bhâkta (“partial”) meaning. Such a meaning may be seen in the sentence “the boy is a lion,” meaning that the boy is fierce. (3) Bhakti (“attachment, love, affect”) is the intense desire one may have to express such a concept as proximity [to a holy river] or fierceness [in a young man]. The meaning that arises from such eagerness is called a bhâkta (“affective”) meaning and may be either a metaphorical (gauna) or a relational (läksanika) meaning. (4) Bhakti is the breaking or blocking (bhanga, from bhanju âmardane) of the primary meaning. Hence a meaning that arises from blocking of the primary sense is a bhâkta meaning.These etymologies will show that the presence of three factors forms the seed from which secondary usage (upacâra) arises. They are: the blocking of the primary meaning;6 a cause [e.g., proximity to or sim­ilarity to the primary object]; and a purpose [e.g., one’s eagerness to express forcefully this proximity or similarity].What lies back of the apposition between soul of p o etry and sec­ondary usage is this.7 Although secondary usage is [sometimes] found in that variety of dhvani where the literal meaning is not intended, as in “like a mirror blinded by breath,” nevertheless dhvani is not iden­tical with it, for we find dhvani without secondary usage in such a variety of dhvani as that where the literal meaning is subordinated to a second meaning.8 And we shall show9 that even where the literal meaning is not intended there may be secondary usage without dhvani So our author will say: “This dhvani is not identical with bhakti (sec­ondary operation), because it differs from it in form; nor is it defined by that, because the definition would be both too wide and too narrow.” (1.14 K) and “It might, however, be an adventitious mark (upalaksana) of a certain type of dhvani\"10 (1.19 K).[Abhinava now takes the part of the opponent, etymologizing the word gunavrtti to show that just like dhvani it may denote a word, a meaning, or an operation or usage.]11Gunas are properties such as proximity or fierceness. Gunavrtti (lit­erally, “of which, or in which, there is an occurrence because of prop­erties” ) may be either a word or a meaning [depending on whether we analyse the compound as a genitive or locative bahuvrihi], viz., “that"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"(word) of which there is an occurrence in (or, application to) a mean­ing other than the primary meaning because of these properties,” or “that (meaning) in which there is an occurrence of a word by these means.” Or: gvnavrtti may be the occurrence, that is, the operation, of the secondary power of meaning through these properties. This is as much as to say: in whatever sense we understand the word dhvani, viz., as that which suggests, or that which is suggested, or the oper­ation of suggesting, still it is nothing different from a word used in a secondary meaning, or the secondary meaning itself, or the secondary operation. For, as denotation is the only operation in conveying the primary sense, we are left with only one possibility: that dhvani is the secondary operation, as there is no third.But who ever said that dhvani was gunavrttil With this objection in mind, [the denier of dhvani] says, and although, etc. A ny o th er sort of thing: e.g., any sort of quality or figure of speech. In show ­ing: he is referring to such authors as Bhattodbhata and Vämana. For where Bhämaha says, “Words, meters, designations (abhidhdna), meanings,”12 Bhattodbhata explains the difference between words and designations as follows: “Designation means the denotative function of words, which may be primary or secondary (gunavrtti).”13 And Vämana has said, “ Vakrokti is secondary usage (laksanä) based on similarity.”14Have a t least touched on: that is, they showed the direction in which dhvani lies, but being men who read literally, they gave no defi­nition of its true nature, as they were unable to distinguish it. Indeed, they scorned it, merely taking up as they found them the words which contained it [without examining their precious inner meaning], as a man might take up a coconut [with no conception of the delicacy of its inner meat].15 Hence [the Vrtti] says that it is wich this in m indth at th e K ärikä s ta te s___If one fails to interpret the passage as wehave done, the statement of the dhvani-opponent that [former writers] have “at least touched on” the process of dhvani will be contradicted. 11. Viz., “jag a d u hcf. 1.1. L, note 4. 2. The word âhuh “they say,”although it carries a perfect suffix, is regarded by Panini as a present (Pân. 3.4.84). “The present tense for the expression of that which takes place con­stantly\" (nityapravrttavartamäne lat) is an expression taken from Värttika 1 on Pan. 3.2.123. It is given by Bhoja (ÉP 5, Josyer’s edition, p. 164) as one of the six uses of the present tense. 3.

But the variant is surely wrong. Abhinava is forced to use sevya- te in glossing bhajyate because that is its gloss in the DhP (1.1047 bhaja seväyäm). 4. The quotation is from a Mlmämsä author Bhartrmitra whose works are 1 t. See Kane, SD, p. 320, footnote. Abhinava uses a different version of it in commenting on 1.18. The word särüpyät is there replaced by samyogät, which would exclude the metaphorical variety of secondary usage from laksanä. The verse is quoted in the Abhidhävrttimätrkä on Kdrikds 9-10 in still a different version, but one that does include the metaphorical variety (abhidheyena sambandhdt sddriydt samavdyatah). The Abhidhävrttimätrkä is about a century older than the Locana. 5. For the distinction of gauna and läksanika see 1.1. K, note 2. 6. By blocking is meant that the context ren­ders the primary meaning impossible. Boys, for example, are not really lions. 7. Abhinava is here speaking in propria persona, not in the role of the de­nier of dhvani. He admits that there can be sämänyädhikaranya (apposition, syntopicity) between dhvani and gunavrtti. This is very different from saying that they are identical. “An oak is a tree” is a sentence which exhibits syn­topicity, but a tree is not an oak. For the distinction see NVTT 1.1.4 (Kashi ed., p. 110, lines 16ff.; Calc, ed., p. 96, lines 2ff.) 8.

Cf. 3.33j.10. An upalaksana is a characteristic that helps define a term only temporarily or under certain conditions. The laksana (definition proper) of the washerman’s house might be “the first house east of the lake.” An upalaksana of this house might be “the house on the roof of which a crow is sitting.” 11. Gunavrtti is actually used almost exclusively in the third of these senses. But the point of the etymologies is to show correspondence be­tween gunavrtti and dhvani which might be thought to support the opponent’s view. 12. Bhämaha 1.9. 13. See J.

See also Agnipuräna 346.22-23.§ l.le A ]A Finally some, whose minds have shied away from attempting a definition, have declared that the true nature of dhvani lies outside the"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"realm of speech, that it can only be felt and that only by a sensitive reader.1 Therefore, in view of such disagreements, we shall state its true nature in order to delight the hearts of sensitive readers. For the nature of this dhvani. which is the secret of all good poets’ poetry, which despite its extraordinary beauty has not been opened to view by the subtle minds of the ancient makers of definitions of poetry, which, moreover, is clearly seen to be at work in such great poems as the Rämäyana and the Mahäbhärata, will here be revealed so that the bliss [which arises] in the hearts of sensitive readers on their noticing it in [the poems that form] the object of their attention, may take firm hold in their hearts.21. One may note that the Kârikâs, while they refute both the abhâvavâda and the bhâktavâda, are silent about the anàkhyeyavâda. This may be, as the Vrtti claims at the end of the chapter, because the author felt that the very statement of his own theory was sufficient answer. 2. This is a difficult sentence to translate. If one breaks it up, one loses the tight connection that subsists between its parts. The bahvvrihi compound prasiddha-vyavahâram is in a double construction (käkäksigolakanyäyena). The nature of dhvani, which is clearly at work in all great poetry, will be revealed for the delight of those readers who notice that it is clearly at work in all great poetry. Their initial observation of dhvani has brought them bliss, but this bliss will take permanent hold on their hearts (or minds) only by the clear definitions of dhvani that the author is about to reveal. Abhinava gets earned away by the discovery of latent implications in the sentence. To him it suggests arguments against all the preceding wrong views of dhvani. In order to find an argument against the last of the wrong views, viz., that dhvani cannot be defined, he takes the word laksayatäm here to mean “who are defining\" rather than “who are noticing.” This seems to me (D.I.) to mistake entirely the intention of the sentence. If sensitive readers are already defining the nature of dhvani in the poems of their reading, what need would there be to write the Dhvanyäloka? Abhinava’s remark on the word ânanda should be accepted. The author is here playing on the proper name. The effect of his book will be to give firm footing in the hearts of sensitive readers not only to the bliss of understanding dhvani but to the fame of Änandavardhana.L W hose m inds have shied away: who were of ti id intel­lect. The three [sets of critics, viz., those who deny the existence of dhvani, those who say that it is merely an associated meaning, and those who say that it cannot be defined,] are such that each one later mentioned is of sounder judgment than the preceding. Those of the first"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"set are completely wrong; those of the second, while they recognize its nature, deny it [to be dhvani] because of indecision;1 those of the last set do not deny it but know not how to define it. So what characterizes the three groups is in turn error, indecision, and insufficient knowledge.Therefore (tena): He uses the singular (tena, lit., “because of this”) since any one of these [three] statements of divergent view might serve as justification for the following description [of dhvani].Such disagreem ents: locative of limitation; the sense is, because of any one type among these divergent opinions.2W e shall state its tru e nature: These words imply that the sub­ject matter of the book is the true nature of dhvani, that the relation of dhvani to the book is a relation of subject matter to speech, that the relation of speaker to hearer is a relation of instructor to instructed, that the purpose of the book is (to give] a knowledge of the true na­ture of dhvani by refuting wrong opi ions on the subject, and that the relation of the book to this purpose is a relation of means to goal.3Now in order to explain the portion “to delight the hearts of sensitive readers,” a portion which sets forth the purpose, resident within the hearer, of the purpose [of the book], he says: for th e n atu re of this, etc. The meaning of “this\" is “this dhvani which has become a matter of controversy.” The structure of the sentence is as follows. The nature of dhvani will be revealed in order to effect a purpose, namely, so that bliss (änanda), which is a sort of delight (nirvrti) also known as “rapture” (camatkära), may assume a firm stance—firm enough not to be shaken by other critics who suffer from error, (indecision, and ignorance]— within the minds of those who define (laksayatâm, see 1.1 e A, note 2 and remarks of L below) [this nature of dhvani]. As one understands the purpose [viz., the giving of delight to sensitive readers] to be that which ultimately prompts [the author to furnish] the matter [viz., the definition of dhvani] which achieves the purpose, this explanation takes the words [of the last line of the Kärikä, viz.,] pritaye tatsvarapam brämah as part of a single complex sentence.4In explaining the words “its true nature,” the Vrttikära indicates briefly his rebuttal of the five divergent views which he has mentioned above.5 All: By the word “all,” combined with good poets, he re­futes [the view that dhvani might consist] “in some small variety” [that has not been dealt with previously; cf. 1.1 c A]. By its extrao rd in ary b eau ty he shows its difference from associated usage [cf. 1.1 d A], for there is no particular beauty in such instances of associated meaning as “The boy is a lion,” or “A village on the Ganges.” By calling it the§ L i e i ] 69"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"70secret [of all good poets’ poetry], he refutes the view that it is merely a new name [for something already defined by earlier critics; cf 1.1 c A].6 By speaking of [dhvani as not having been opened to view] by th e sub­tle m inds [of the ancients], he shows that it cannot be included in the qualities or in the figures of speech [cf. 1.1 a A]. By the passage stating that m oreover [dhvani is clearly seen to be at work in great poems], he refutes the suspicion of cliquishness that [was brought against pro­ponents of dhvani when the objector] spoke of “some few persons of your persuasion” [cf. 1.1b A]\\ and by mentioning the Rämäyana and the Mahäbhärata he shows that dhvani has been revered by every one from the time of the very first poet.7By the participle laksayatäm [which in translating A we have ren­dered as noticing it] he sets aside the objection that dhvani Lies outside the realm of speech. The noun laksa means that by which something is recognized, that is, a definition (laksana). The denominative verb laksayati means to describe something by defining it. So the participle laksayatäm means “describing it by means of definitions.”Of sensitive readers (sahrdayänäm): The word sahrdaya (lit., “having their hearts with it” ) denotes persons who are capable of iden­tifying with the subject matter,8 as the mirror of their hearts has been polished9 by the constant study and practice of poetry, and who re­spond to it sympathetically in their own hearts. As has been said, “The realization (bhdva) of that object (e.g., vibhäva, etc.) which finds sympathy in the heart is the origin of rasa. The body is pervaded by it as dry wood by fire” (BhNÉ 7.7).10T he bliss: In showing the primary object to be bliss, which is noth­ing more than the relishing of rasa, he shows that [of the three types of dhvani] it is the suggestion of rasa that is the most important and is the real soul of poetry. Hereby the following verse [of Bhattanäyaka11] is given a mortal blow: “Supposing that one could prove dhvani to be a separate verbal operation, whose nature is suggestion, it would still form only a part of poetry, not its very self.”12 For you [i.e., Bhattanäyaka] have admitted that while poetry consists of the three parts, designation (abhidhä), aesthetic efficacy (bhävanä). and the rel­ishing of rasa (rasacarvanä), it is the relishing of rasa that gives it its life. As you yourself have said, “It is the man who relishes [what he reads], not he who learns it nor he who obeys it, [who is eligible] for [reading] poetry.” 13If your saying that dhvani is only a part of poetry is a statement made with reference to vastudhvani (the suggestion of a fact) or to[ § 1.1 e L"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"71alankäradhvani (the suggestion of a figure of speech), you are merely confirming what we regard as already confirmed;14 but if it is made with reference to rasadhvani, your statement stands in contradiction to the experience proclaimed in your own admission.15In this m atter16 (of the primary goal’s being bliss, one may make a distinction]: For the poet, delight is certainly his goal, but it may be achieved also by fame, as the verse proclaims: “for they say that fame has heavenly reward.”17 For the auditors (or readers), it is true that both instruction and delight are goals, for it has been said, “The study of good poetry imparts skill in dharma, artha, kâma, moksa, and the arts; it gives both fame and joy” [Bhämaha 1.2]. Nevertheless, of in­struction and joy, joy is the chief goal. Otherwise, what basic difference would there be between one means of instruction, viz., poetry, which instructs after the fashion of a wife, and other means of instruction, such as the Vedas which instruct after the fashion of a master, or his­tory which instructs after the fashion of a friend? That is why bliss is said to be the chief goal. In comparison with (poetry’s] instruction even in all four aims of human life, the bliss which it renders is a far more important goal.“Änanda” (“bliss”) is also the name of the author. Therefore [the concluding sentence of the Vrtti on l.le] also means: may the teacher Anandavardhana attain by means of this book an imperishable place in the hearts of sympathetic readers, as [the statue of a god, properly consecrated, attains such] a place in a temple. As has been said:The authors of great works, even after death, leave with us in their poems a body of undiminishable beauty.[Bhämaha 1.6]§ 1.1 e L ]From the place he attains in their hearts, one may judge the heart of the author himself: the sense is that he is a prince of connoisseurs. The same use of “place” is found in the line of verse: “In battle the highest place was Arj una’s.” The mention of his own name is simply to encourage his readers (to study the work] by arousing their respect and their trust, as we shall explain at the end of the book. Thus [the word “bliss” hints at] the primary goal of the author, of the poet, and of the reader."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"1. Sandeha (indecision) is that type of doubt which cannot decide which of two identifications is correct, e.g., “Is it a man or a tree? Is it a cloud or smoke?\" Here the sandeha would take the form “Is this an instance of dhvani or of associated meaning?\" 2. Abhinava does not take the locative evam- vidhäsv. vimatisu as a normal locative absolute (laksanä-saptami), as we have taken it. He assigns it rather to the locative of limitation (Pän. 2.3.41). So the literal sense by his interpretation would be: “because of this or that mis­understanding among [or, within the limit of) these divergent opinions, we f 1 compelled to set the matter straight.” One should place a danda after tenaiva hetunä. 3. This sentence elicits the anvbandhas essentially as Abhinava has already given them; see 1.1 L and note 1 thereon. 4. The first Kärikä says in essence: “Dhvani has been understood in various ways; therefore, we shall state its true nature for the joy (pritaye tatsvarüpam brümah) of sensitive readers.\" Other things being equal, two methods of interpreting the Kärikä would be possible: (1) by väkyabheda, as furnishing two parallel clauses, in which case the sense would be: “Because dhvani has been understood in var­ious ways we shall state its true nature and we shall state its true nature for the joy of sensitive readers\"; (2) by ekaväkyatä, as furnishing a single complex sentence, in which one clause is subordinated to another, viz., “Since dhvani has been understood in various ways, we shall state its true nature for the joy of sensitive readers.” Of these two possible interpretations, only the second is correct because the purpose of stating the nature of dhvani is to furnish delight to the readers; the need of refuting the various wrong opinions is sub­ordinate to this purpose. We have followed the preference of BP in taking vyäkhyeyam as vyäkhyä + iyam. It could of course be understood as a single word, a gerundive modifying the iit-clause pritaye tatsvarüpam brümah. One would then translate: “The words pritaye, etc., are to be interpreted as part of a complex sentence.” 5. What follows is an instance of Abhinava’s passion for discovering hidden indications and suggestions in Änanda’s text. He not only finds suggestions to refute the five arguments against dhvani, he assigns special suggestions to no less than nine words or phrases in the brief passage comprised by 1.1 e A. His enthusiasm pushes him into a false interpretation of the word laksayatäm, as it is only by this false interpretation that he can find in this passage a reference to the last anti-dhvani argument, viz., that dhvani cannot be described in words. Cf. 1.1 e A, note 2. 6. If dhvani isthe secret of all good poets’ poetry, it must be more important than any of the components of poetry mentioned by the older authors. We cannot call it merely a new name for one of those anciently defined components. 7. Väl- mlki was the first poet. The Rämäyana according to Indian tradition is older than the Mahäbhärata. 8. In ABh. Voi. 2, p. 339, Abhinava defines sahr- dayatva (literary sensitivity) as the faculty of entering into identity with the heart of the poet (kavihrdayatädätmyäpattiyogyatä). The passage has been pointed out by Gnoli, p. xliv. 9. The polished mirror is a favorite image[§ 1.1 e L"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"73of Abhinava. Cf. IPV, beginning of Vol. 2: mtatamsadasyâtmâdrée svaéakti- rasojjvalam, and Tantrâloka, Vol. 2, p. 4, vs. 4: nirmale mukule yadvad bhânti bhûmijalâdayah / amisräs tadvad ekasmimé cinnäthe viévavrttayah. Mirrors, which were of metal, were polished with ashes; cf. Vajjälagga 33.10. By this quotation Abhinava seems to indicate that it is only within the sahrdaya that rasa can arise. Unfortunately the MSS of ABh. break off just before this passage of the BhNS. In its place one may use the Kau- mudVs remarks, for its author had probably read an undefective MS of the ABh. and is most likely following it in commenting on this veise. “‘Whatever thing,’” he says, \"that is, whatever form of vibhäva, etc., occurs in a good poet’s description. ‘Finds sympathy in the heart,’ that is, is such as to become the object of the heart’s sympathy. The realization (bhäva) of that thing,’ in other words, its blossoming within the frame of the spotless mirror of the heart: that is, the origin, or more strictly, the cause of the rise of, rasa. ‘By it,' that is, by a vibhäva, etc., of such a sort, the heart is pervaded. For this sudden and. uniform pervasion he gives an example: ‘as dry wood by fire.’ It is dry wood that is so pervaded, not stone or some other substance. Accordingly, to speak of what is exemplified, Vedic scholars (srotriydh) and such like persons have no poetic sensitivity, for their hearts lack any proclivity (vâsanâ) toward such emotions as love. By the wood’s being ‘dry’ he indicates the purity of the heart achieved by its study of poetry, while by ‘fire’ he shows that the property of being a vibhäva depends on the beauty of the poetic qualities and figures of speech by which it is expressed.” 11. Abhinava later refers to the author of the verse by name (1.4a L). 12. Rüpatä is hereused, metri causa, for svarüpatä. K glosses it by svarüpatvam, ätmatvam. 13. To explain the verse Kau. supplies the words sarua eva kävye 'dhikriya- te. As Kau. elsewhere quotes Bhattanäyaka independently of Abhinava, its author must have known the text of the Hrdayadarpana at first hand. He is therefore a reliable guide in such instances as the present. Bhattanäyaka is here envisaging three types of reader to fit the three types of literature, viz., that which delights (poetry), that which instructs (history), and that which commands (the Veda). 14. In Abhinava’s system vastudhvani and alankära- dhvani are merely parts of poetry, being superior to direct designation but not being the real soul of poetry, which is rasadhvani. 15. We have taken the reading sväbhyupagama-prasiddha-samvedanä, preferred by Kau., rather than the reading with prasiddhi. The latter, given by both Chow, and Kashi, makes an awkward dvandva: ‘stands in contradiction to your admission, to what is well known, and to inner experience.” Furthermore, the point is that Bhattanäyaka has admitted rasacarvanä to be the essential delight of poetry, so how can he make rasadhvani a subordinate part? 16. Abhinava does not spell out the connection of his thoughts here. It seems to be this. Änanda has chosen the word bliss to express the final goal of his work: it will give bliss to his readers. His choice of words is appropriate because it hints at the thesis§ 1.1 e L ]"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"74that the primary purpose of poetry itself is the bliss that it gives, rather than any instruction one may gain by it. For the relative importance of enjoyment and instruction in the reading of poetry, see also 3.10-14 f L and Introduction, p. 36. 17. One may take svarga either literally, understanding that fameleads one to heaven, or metaphorically, understanding that fame gives to its possessor a delight equal to heaven.[ § 1.1 e £A At this point, although it is only dhvani that the author has undertaken to define, he states the following in order to lay a ground­work.L Now the reader might ask what the train of thought can be, for after promising to “state the true nature of dhvani,” the next Kârikà goes on to speak of the literal meaning, telling us that “there are two varieties of meaning, the literal and the implied.’’ To show what the trend of thought is, (the VHti] furnishes an introductory remark.A t th is point: that is, the subject matter [of the book] and its goal being as stated.1 G roundw ork: anything similar to a ground or basis. Just as when one wants to build something new, one first prepares the ground, so also when one is about to describe the true nature of dhvani, which is none other than implied meaning, one takes as groundwork the literal meaning, which is undeniable and known to everyone, because the implied meaning will be more clearly noticed when placed beside it. Its being placed here on the same level with the literal meaning is in order to convey the fact that it also is undeniable.1. The subject matter is dhvani and the goal is to give delight. Both factors seem to be inconsistent with a mention of the literal meaning.K Meaning, which has been praised by sensitive critics and de­termined to be the soul of poetry, is traditionally held to have two varieties, the literal and the implied.1"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"751. This is a badly constructed verse, as many Sanskrit critics have noted. Taken literally, the relative clause is restrictive, for the anaphoric pronoun tad must take both subject and predicate of the relative clause into its reference (tasyeti tatpadenoddesyavidheyasamuditàrthaviâesasyaiva tatra parämarsah). Accordingly, a literal translation would be: 'That meaning which has been called the soul of poetry is held to have two varieti This cannot be what the author intended, for it flies in the face of later statements by both the Kârikâs and the Vrtti. The soul of poetry is limited to the implied or sug­gested sense alone. It is meaning in a general sense that has two varieties. The contradiction is pointed out by Mahimabhatta (p. 89 Benares ed.), Visvanätha (Book I, p. 29, just before the first half of verse 3), and others. In our transla­tion we have given the sense that the author seems to have intended by mark­ing the relative clause off with commas as if it were descriptive. Abhinava, by the use of considerable ingenuity, arrives at much the same conclusion.§ 1.2 L }A Meaning, which is praised by sensitive critics as being essential to a poem and therefore what the soul is to a body already charming by the configuration of graceful and appropriate parts, has two varieties, the literal and the implied.11. This prose sentence suffers from the same fault as does the Kärikä: the relative clause is properly restrictive. \"Charming by the configuration of graceful and appropriate parts” goes with the word “poetry” as well as with “bddy.”L [Comment on the Kärikä:] Is traditionally held to have: this reinforces the statement [of 1.1 K] that the concept of dhvani has been handed down from the past.When it is said that “poetry is embodied in word and meaning” [see 1.1a i4], we infer from the reference to a body that poetry must also have something as a soul to give it life. Of the two elements [word and meaning], word falls wholly within the category of body, for it has properties sensible to everyone, just as fatness and leanness [are sensible in the human body]. Meaning, on the other hand, is not sensible to everyone, for we do not call something a poem solely from its having meaning. Both everyday sentences and Vedic sentences have meaning without being poems. So he specifies: which has been praised by"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"76sensitive critics. The one general concept “meaning” is distinguished in the mind of discri inating critics into two branches. Now, both of these being equally “meanings,” why should sensitive critics praise just the one? There must be something special about it. This special something is the part of meaning that is implied and that is determined by discriminating critics to be the soul of poetry because it is a cause of the special property [of poetry]. Other persons, however, whose minds are confused by the close connection [of the implied] with the literal meaning, dispute its separate existence, just as the Carväkas dispute the separate existence of the soul. Accordingly, while he begins with the word “meaning” in the singular, he goes on to say that there are two varieties or sorts of this meaning, giving the reason for this by mentioning the distinction [enjoyed by the implied meaning] of being “praised by sensitive critics.\" He does not mean that there are two souls of poetry.[Comment on the Vrtti:] To explain the word “poetry” as used in the Kärikä, the Vrtti says, to a poem , etc. By the word charm ing he indicates that the qualities and figures of speech impart this charm to it. By the word ap p ro p riate he hints at the fact that rasadhvani is the real life of a poem because he will show that propriety is always with respect to the rasa. For if the rasa is absent, with respect to what could one use this word “propriety” that has become so popular?M eaning, which is ... By the pronoun “which” (yad)1 he picks up as subject of the relative clause a fact already known. Thus he shows that this fact at least (viz., that artha, “meaning,\" is admired by connoisseurs) is accepted even by the opponent. By the main clause, viz., tasya, etc. (“of it there are two varieties,” etc.), he shows that this acceptance is possible only if there are two varieties [of meaning]. [Furthermore] he hereby demonstrates that the argument that “dhvani is not different from the gunas and alaiikàras because it is a cause of beauty” suffers from a falsely assigned reason, because dhvani [is not a cause of beauty but] is the soul itself of poetry. For we do not say that the soul is the cause of the body’s beauty. Or, even if we grant that we might say so, the objector’s reason becomes inconclusive when applied to the literal meaning, for at least that [portion of the literal meaning] which is to be ornamented cannot be itself an ornament (alankâra), nor can that (portion] which possesses a poetic quality be itself a quality. It is for this reason that the author has brought in the literal meaning.2 And that is why he will go on to say, “the literal meaning is well known,” etc.[ § 1.2 L"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"771. yadänuvadan: yadä is the instrumental of the word-stem yad. 2. The cause of the difficulty in this passage is that Abhinava is trying to justify a statement of Änanda’s that is really not justifiable. We have noted Änanda’s fault (1.2 K, note 1, and A, note 1), viz., the bringing in of the literal meaning to share in the designation “soul of poetry.” In the present passage, from yo ’rtha iti to väcyämsopaksepah, Abhinava seeks to justify what Änanda has done. It is necessary, Abhinava says, to bring in the literal meaning in order to exhibit a logical fault in an argument of the pürvapaksa. The pürvapaksa has argued that dhvani must be the same as the qualities (puna) or ornaments (alankära, figures of speech). The parts of the syllogism may be identified as follows.Paksa: dhvanih = pratiyamäno 'rthah (the implied meaning)Sädhya: gunälaiikäränatiriktah (is not different from the punas or alankdras) Hetu: cärutvahetutvät (because it is a cause of beauty).The first and most obvious fault of this syllogism is that it suffers from asid- dhahetutva, that is, its hetu is not true of the paksa. Dhvani is not a cause of beauty; it is the beauty of poetry. Now the pürvapaksin might reply that while this is strictly true, one might, by metonymy, speak of dhvani as a cause of beauty in poetry. A result may be referred to as a cause; we might allow that the soul is a cause of the beauty that is found in the complex of body and soul called man. Very well, says Abhinava, in that case your syllogism suffers from another fault. If we substitute väcyo 'rthah (the literal meaning) for pratityamäno 'rthah as the paksa, the hetu will be inconclusive (anaikäntika). The substitution is permissible because the väcyo 'rthah is inextricably bound up with the pratiyamäno 'rthah. But now the hetu will occur in the absence of the sädhya as well as i its presence. Being a cause of beauty will occur in that portion of the väcyo 'rthah which is to be ornamented (alankärya) as well as in that which is an ornament. And the alankärya cannot be an alankära. Similarly that which is a gunin cannot be a puna. Here is Abhinava's pièce de résistance. The väcyo 'rthah must be brought in in order to show the in­conclusiveness of the proving an artha to be a puna or an alankära from the fact of its being a cause of beauty.§ 1.3 K )K Of these [two varieties] the literal meaning is well known and has been analysed by others into many figures such as si ile.

It is that which is well-known to sensitive readers and is separate from the known, ornamented, elements [of poetry], after they have been examined, being thus like charm in women.

What he means is both “different from that” and at the same time “the very essence [of poetry].” The plural in great poets conveys the fact that this [suggested meaning] extends throughout their works. In fact, the title of “great poet” is used only of a poet who has the in­spiration needed to produce poetry which is enlivened with suggested meanings such as we shall explain in this work. It is because [a sug­gested meaning] of this sort exists that it is apprehended. For it does not stand to reason that something completely non-existent should be apprehended. Even the silver [for which we mistake the mother-of- pearl] is not wholly unreal.1 The apprehension of something is due to its actual existence; and so from apprehension we infer existence. This is as much as to say that what appears is such as it appears. For the purpose of syllogistic demonstration [one may say that] the well-known literal meaning is that which will be shown to have a property [i.e., is that which forms the paksa of the inference]. It has that property by its being accompanied by an implied meaning distinct [from the literal]. It is thus because it so appears, as do the limbs of a woman endowed with charm.'W ell-known: The word prasiddha has the two senses “well-known to all” and “ornamented.”2T h at which (yad tad): [By its indefiniteness]3 the double pronoun shows two characteristics of both the example [viz., charm in women] and that which the example illustrates [viz., the implied meaning]: namely, that neither can be precisely described—this serves to empha­size the aesthetic effect—and that each is readily mistaken for that with which it is intimately combined, [charm being confused with beauty of the limbs and the implied meaning being confused with the literal]. The Vrtti renders this by a certain som ething. For charm is revealed by the configuration of the limbs, but is a special property different from [that of] any particular part. Charm does not consist in the mere fault­lessness of the limbs or in their association with ornaments. For we find that discriminating critics will say of a woman, “She is not really beau­tiful,” even though the parts of her body on being examined are found to exhibit no fault, such as dullness of the eye, and even though her"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"80limbs be ornamented with jewels. On the other hand, of a woman who is not such, they may exclaim that she is the very paragon of ambrosial charm.4[ § 1.4 L1. Abhinava is here attributing to Änanda the anyathäkhyäti theory of error. In our errors we do not invent objects. The erroneously perceived object is not unreal, but is merely in a place or relation other than that in which it is perceived. This is the standard Nyàya-Vaüesika theory of error.2. For prasiddha in the sense of ornamented see Kvm.Sam. 5.9 and 7.16. on which Mallinâtha quotes Amarakosa: prasiddhau khyätabhüsitau-, so also Ragh. 18.41. 3. The basic difference between the single pronoun yad andthe compound yat tad is that the latter is indefinite whereas the former is definite. See Speyer 287c. Abhinava goes on to specify two ways in which the double pronoun is here indefinite. 4. The distinction is admirably put by an ancient Roman: non est formosa cuius crus laudatur aut bracchium sed ilia cuius universa facies admirationem partibus singulis abstulit (Seneca. Epist. 33.5): liShe is not formosa [= Sanskrit lâvanyavatî-, the word is opposed to bella or pulchra] whose thigh or whose arm is praised, but she whose whole configuration steals our admiration from the individual parts.”A For this meaning, implied by force of the literal sense, will be shown to be divisible into several categories: a simple thing (vastu- mâtra), a figure of speech, a rasa, etc.* 1 In each of these varieties what is suggested is different from the literal meaning. Thus, even the first variety [viz., vastudhvani] is totally different from the literal sense. For sometimes where the literal meaning is an injunction, the suggested meaning takes the form of a prohibition.1. Throughout the book reference will be made to “rasa, etc.” (rasädi). The term refers to all the elements that belong to rasadhvani: not only raso but bhäva, rasäbhäsa, bhäväbhäsa, bhävodaya, bhävasandhi, bhävasabala, and bhävaprasama. For definitions see 1.4 g L and for examples 2.3 L.L Now it may be objected that charm is widely recognized to be different [from beauty of the limbs], but we do not know what a"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"81suggested meaning is; much less is there any general recognition that it is different [from the literal]. So the hetu of the syllogism [viz., “because it so appears”) is untrue. Anticipating such an objection, [the Vrtti] states the nature [of this suggested meaning] in the words for this m eaning, etc.; and in the words in each of these vari­eties, etc., it will establish the fact that it is generally recognized as different.Here we may begin by distinguishing two varieties of suggested mean­ing, a workaday variety and a variety that is found to operate only in poetry.1 The workaday sort is that which may take the place of a literal form of expression;2 and its types, such as injunction, prohibition, etc., are designated by the term vastu (“things”). This workaday dkvani is in turn twofold. One type, a sense which enjoyed the nature of an alankâra, being in the form of a simile, etc., as it was exhibited in some previous [literal], sentence-meaning, is now [in the suggestive mode of speech] no longer an alankâra because there is no other factor to which it can be subordinated.3 But because of our recognition of it from the past, it is still called alankâradhvani, much as a sramana (Buddhist monk) who was once a brahmin is called a brahmin sramana.* On the other hand, what lacks this special form is called [suggestion of] a sim­ple thing (vastu-mätra). By the word simple (mâtra) the other form is excluded.On the other hand, rasa is something that one cannot dream of expressing by the literal sense. It does not fall within workaday ex­pression. It is, rather, of a form that must be tasted by an act of blissful relishing on the part of a delicate mind through the stimula­tion (anurâga) of previously deposited memory elements which are in keeping with the vibhävas and anubhâvas, beautiful because of their appeal to the heart, which are transmitted by [suggestive] words [of the poet].* The suggesting of such a sense is called rasadhvani and is found to operate only in poetry. This, in the strict sense of the word, is the soul of poetry.When Bhattanäyaka says that dhvani could form “only a part of po­etry, not the very self’ (cf. 1.1 e L), if by any stretch of the imagination this could be considered a valid reproach, it would be so only in respect to vastudhvani and alankâradhvani. He himself has (in effect] admitted that rasadhvani is the soul of poetry by his setting the third mode of speech, which he identifies as the relishing of roso, far beyond the mode of designation (abhidhä) and aesthetic efficacy (bhävanä). That vastudhvani and alankâradhvani lead to rasadhvani alone is a matter§ 1.4a L ]"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"that we shall illustrate from time to time in what follows.6 So we let the matter rest for now.Im plied by force of th e literal sense: this characterization holds for all three varieties of dhvani, for although suggestion is an operation of the word, the force of meaning never fails to act as an auxiliary cause; so we may speak of the suggestive operation as being implied by force of the literal sense. Even in that variety of dhvani called sabdasakti- mUldnurananavyangya (that form of suggestion which is similar to a reverberation and which is dependent on the suggestive power of words; for this type see 2.20-21 below), we shall show that our understanding of the implied meaning comes from the force of the literal sense, the power of words being only a subordinate auxiliary.Is totally different: no one will gainsay the fact that injunction and prohibition contradict one another. That is why he illustrates them first.82 [ § 1.4 a L1. The following remarks of Abhinava will be more easily understood if the reader will keep in mind the three traditional types of suggestion: (a) vastvdhvani: suggestion of a thing. What is covered by the term “thing” is extremely various: a prohibition may be suggested, or an injunction, or a fact, or a situation, (b) alankdradhvani: what is suggested seems to be a figure of speech, (c) rasadhvani: what is suggested is a rasa, bhäva, etc. Abhinava magnifies the value of the last type. To him it is vastly more beautiful than the other two and it alone forms the real soul of poetry. So he begins his analysis of suggested meaning by setting forth just two categories: poetic suggestion (= rasadhvani) and workaday suggestion (= all other forms of dhvani). All workaday suggestion, he says, is really the suggestion of things (vasta), but one particular type of thing occasions a special designation. When the thing suggested seems to be a figure of speech, we call it alankdradhvani 2. This is the essential characteristic of workaday dhvani. The sense given by po­etic dhvani (= rasadhvani) cannot be expressed by any other verbal means. On the other hand, prohibitions (cf. the suggested prohibition in the verse quoted under 1.4b), injunctions (cf. 1.4c), figures of speech—all these can be expressed by either a literal or a suggested mode of speech. 3. Alankâra­dhvani is discussed in Chapter Two of the present work, esp. 2.21 e, but some anticipation of what is there said is needed if the reader is to understand what Abhinava says here. Take the illustration of rüpaka-dhvani: atrântare ajrmbhata grismäbhidhänah phullamaUikädhavalättahäsa mahäkälah. Here the literal meaning, as demanded by the context (a description of the passage of time), is: “Then expanded the long season called Summer, in which there was a blossoming of the market stalls which were white with jasmine.” But the power of words suggests a non-contextual meaning, viz.. 'Then yawned"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"83the God of Destruction, whose terrible laughter is white as jasmine.\" The confrontation of the second meaning with the first suggests a figure of speech, viz., rüpaka: the long season of summer is a god of destruction. Now this figure of speech can perfectly well be furnished, and in another context might well have been furnished, by the literal sense of a sentence rather than by a suggestion. Note further that the suggestion is not, strictly speaking, an alaiikira, for Änanda will define an alankàra as something subordinate. Just as jewelry is subordinate to the limb or body on which it is worn, so a figure of speech is subordinate to a sentence meaning, a rasa, bhâva, etc. But in the rûpaka-dhvani just instanced there is nothing to which the dhvani is subordinated. It is itself the sentence meaning. Accordingly, it is only by a fashion of speech that this can be called alankàra-dhvani. 4. Strictlyspeaking, a sramana cannot be a brahmin, for his initiation will have forced him to give up all marks and distinctions of caste. 5. The long compound would be easier to understand if we read samudita in place of samucita, as does the KM edition. The more careful editions, though, give only samucita.6.

As regards the meaning of the verse, one may correct Abhinava’s comment by the remarks of Mammata p. 253 (5.139) and his commentators as well as those of Hemacandra (KA 1.19). A religious mendicant has hitherto been frightened away from a certain house by the family dog, but has wandered along the riverbank nearby, gathering flowers for püjä. Now. the young wife of the house has been accustomed to steal out and meet her lover in a grove by the riverbank. She fears interruption by the mendicant and furthermore begrudges him the loss of flowers from her trysting spot. So she tells him that the dog has been killed by a lion who lives in the thickets by the river. As Mammata puts it, the invitation to the mendicant, through the death of the dog, to make his rounds at the house suggests that he will no longer make visits to the riverbank when he hears of the lion.[ § 1.4b AL [Abhinava begins by translating the Prakrit verse into San­skrit. He renders the second half as godävafinadikülalatägahanaväsinä drptasimhena: “by a proud (or fierce) lion dwelling in the thicket of vines by the bank of the Godavari River.\" He then explains the mean­ing of the verse.]These are the words of a certain woman spoken in order to save a trysting place, close to her heart, from the intrusions of a mendicant and from his spoiling its beauty by plucking its leaves and flowers. His walking in that place1 is a natural activity that has been inhibited by fear of a dog; so the injunction here is merely the absence of preven­tion that arises from lifting of a ban and is not an original command; for the imperative inflection here conveys the sense [not of command but] of permission (atisarga) or of “the proper time to do something” (präptakäla) [Pan. 3.3.163]. As there is contradiction between an ac­tivity [e.g., walking] and its absence, both cannot be directly expressed [by the same word] simultaneously. Nor can they be expressed by this word successively, for the dictum, “Abhidhä cannot express the indi­vidual,” etc.,2 states that after the denotative function has once ceased to operate, it cannot operate again.[O bjections from th e A bhihitänvaya-väda and th eir rebuttal.]Now according to the view of the abhihitänvaya-väda, the expressive power of the sentence ( tätparya-sakti), without coming to rest [in a per­mission] , produces a notion of prohibition as the sense of the sentence.3"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"85It does this by the cooperation of the speaker’s intention (tnvaksä) with the secondary assignment of reversed sense (viparita-laksanä) to the words, brought about by a contradiction, that is, by the blocking of the primary sense [here in the form of “you may wander fearlessly”] which is not construable with the sense of the words “fierce [ lio n ] “pi­ous monk,” and “that [dog].” Thus the final meaning is entirely based on the [denotative] power of the words. And this is what we find in actual communication. People say, “This is what he said” [not “This is what he suggested”]. So there is no other sort of meaning here them the literal [i.e., there is no dhvani].But this is not true, for one can observe three semantic operations in this verse.4 The operation of denotation (abhidhä) conveys senses that are of a general nature, for denotation is a semantic power which depends on convention, and convention is tied to the general; it lacks reference to the specific individual, for otherwise there would be no end [to the conventions that would have to be made for each word] and there would be failure of a word connected with one [individual to refer to other individuals of the same class]. After abhidhä, the power of tâtparya conveys the sentence sense, in which [the general and unconnected] word senses are particularized and mutually connected according to the maxim, “The general senses [of the words] lead to a particularized sense, for if that were not the case, no effect could ensue.\" 5 Now in the example under discussion, in the second stage [i.e., in the moment when tätparya operates], nothing more is understood than the injunction “you may go,\" for this is what is furnished by the mere syntax of the words [i.e., by the syntax as opposed to the other semantic factors]. Such is not the case in the examples “There is a village on the Ganges,” or “The boy is a lion.” For in those examples, the syntax (i.e., the logical connection between the sense of the different words], while it is on the point of taking plaice, is thwarted because of the inherent absurdity.6 But in the case of the present stanza there is no such difficulty7 with regard to the logical connection between the senses of the different words: “That dog, which prevented you from going, has been killed by the lion and therefore, because of the absence of that which prevented your going, it is now proper for you to go.” Therefore no blocking of the primary sense can be suspected and accordingly there is no occasion for laksanä (secondary usage, metonymy) to give a reversed sense. (What we have here is rather suggestion (dhvani).}Or we may even admit [for the sake of argument] that there is laksa­nä here.8 Still, it cannot be said to occupy the second stage [i.e., to§ 1.4 b L]"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"operaie simultaneously with the force of tâtparya]. For laksanä takes place when there is a blocking of the primary sense. This blocking takes the form of an apprehension of inconsistency. In the case of the present stanza, there is no inconsistency in the sense of the words them­selves. Should you argue that they are inconsistent with each other, that must be understood as an inconsistency with regard to the syntax. Now there can be no apprehension of this inconsistency until the syn­tax is understood, and the understanding of the syntax does not come about through abhidhä, for abhidhä exhausts itself in conveying the [individual] word-meanings and has no power to function further. Our understanding of the syntax comes about only through tätparya-sakti.It has been objected that if that were the case, there would be an ap­prehension of syntax even in the phrase, “There are a hundred elephants on the tip of my finger.” 9 Well, we reply, is there not an apprehension of syntax in that phrase, as there is not in the phrase, “Ten pomegranates, six pancakes,\" etc.? 10 [Of course there is,] but this syntax, although it has been understood, is countered by other valid means of cognition, such as perception, as in the cognition “There is silver” in regard to mother-of-pearl. Hence, the sentence which conveys such a meaning is not valid. In the example “The boy is a lion,” on the other hand, there arises a third power called laksanä, which is different from both the power of abhidhä and the power of tâtparya. It arises immediately after the emergence of the factors repugnant to the syntactical connec­tion conveyed by the power of tâtparya belonging to the second stage and it is able to neutralize those repugnant factors.Our opponent may object: “If this were so, such examples as ‘The boy is a lion’ would be poetry, because, as you will shortly say, the soul of poetry, which you define as suggestion, is found in such examples as well [as in poems which exhibit rasa].” To which we answer no; one might as readily say that a clay pot is alive, because, as the soul is omnipresent, it must be in the pot as well. Should you try to reply to this answer by saying that it is only when the soul is present in a body that serves as basis for particular [sense faculties and the like], and not when the soul is present in any other sort of locus, that we speak of life, very well, we will employ the title “poetry” only when dhvani is embodied in a composition containing gunas, figures of speech, propriety, and beautiful words and meanings. But in neither case does the soul [or dhvani} lose its precious nature. 11One cannot say that dhvani is simply bhakti (associated usage) , 12 for bhakti is the same as the operation called laksanä and it belongs86 [ § 1.4 b L"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"87to the third stage (of verbal understanding], whereas the operation of suggestion belongs to the fourth stage. We may put the argument thus. You have agreed that laksanâ comes into play on the concurrence of three conditions. Of these the first, which is the blocking of the primary sense, is based on other means of cognition, such as perception. [The second,] which is known as the cause, i.e., such relations [between the primary and secondary objects] as proximity, etc., can also be under­stood from other means of cognition. But the purpose [for which the secondary sense has been employed] are notions such as the extreme holiness, coolness, fitness to be visited, etc., in the case of the village, or the extreme courage in the case of the boy, notions which cannot be expressed in other words and for which there is no other valid means of cognition. In our cognizing of these [notions] the process cannot be other than verbal, [as we shall now demonstrate.][The process cannot be inferential.) To infer the existence of qualities [like holiness in the village] from its proximity [to a holy river] would be to draw an inference faulty because of an ambivalent hetu.13 In the case of the boy, the fact that he is referred to by the word “lion” will constitute only an illusory (asiddha) hetu.14 Or, if the inference appears in the following form: “Wherever there is use of a word (e.g., ‘lion’] in such a way [viz., as in ‘the boy is a lion,’ where the word ‘lion’ is not used as denotation but by laksanâ], there is the existence of those qualities,” it will be necessary to furnish another supporting means of cognition [such as perception] at the time of comprehending the vyâpti.13 And there is no valid supporting cognition.Nor is this [knowledge of the purpose, viz., to furnish a suggestion of holiness, etc.] a case of remembrance, because it is not possible to remember something we have not experienced. And there is no rule of association by which we could determine what the speaker intended [namely, just this property and not some other]; so there would be no way of determining the meaning. Therefore, the operation [of under­standing] in these cases must be verbal.The verbal operation cannot be the operation of direct designation (abhidhä) because there is no conventional association here. 16 It cannot be the operation of sentence meaning ( tâtparya), because that opera­tion exhausts itself in giving us our apprehension of the syntax. It cannot be the operation of secondary usage or metonymy (laksanâ), because it lacks the stumbling gait (skhaladgati) that laksanâ assumes due to [the blocking of the direct object], a reason already mentioned. 17 For if this operation too ran a halting course, it could only be because its§ 1.4b L]"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"primary goal was blocked, which could only be because of some further purpose or intended goal (prayojana), so that an infinite series of in­tended goals would ensue. Accordingly, the name laksita-laksanä (sec­ondary operation arising from a secondary operation), given by a cer­tain author to this type of operation, is a piece of stubborn perversity. 18 We are thus forced to admit that this is a fourth type of operation, dis­tinct from abhidhä, tätparya, and laksanä, one which has been described by such closely related terms as suggesting (dhvanana), indicating (dyo- tana), hinting (vyanjana), giving a notion (pratyäyana), and giving to understand (avagama).19 As will be said:When a word abandons its primary operation and reveals an object by secondary usage, the purpose for which this is done is one to which the word moves without interruption (1.17 K).So then: the power of denotation is the power, regulated by conven­tion, to convey the literal sense [of the individual words); the power of sentence-operation is the power to convey a sense [of the whole], a power which is aided by the impossibility of the literal sense without it;20 the power of secondary usage is the power to reveal a sense as regulated by such cooperating factors as the blocking of the primary sense; the suggestive power is the power to suggest, a power which has its origin in one’s understanding of objects revealed by the first three powers, and which is then assisted by the imagination of the listener which has been prepared by these revelations.This suggestive power, this suggestive operation, overshadows the three operations which precede it and is the very soul of poetry. This is the author’s intention; and although this power has for its object in this verse the purpose [for which the metonymy was used, viz., the saving of the trysting place and the adulterous intentions of the speaker], still, as these notions are introduced by the notion of a prohibition, the author has spoken simply of its having a prohibition for its object.The preceding21 has been said merely for the sake of argument. In truth there is no secondary usage (laksanä) in the verse in question, for neither is the primary meaning entirely set aside here, nor is it shifted to another meaning.22 In fact there is never any operation of this (secondary power] in the type of suggestion which is based on the power of meaning.23 And it is obvious that from a difference in cooperating causes one may have a difference of power. One and the same word may operate, when aided by the memory of a concomitance (vyäpti), as an inferential mark for the apprehension of the speaker’s intention, and,"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"89when aided by sense perception, as that which renders the perception determinate.24 So much, then, is incontrovertible by those who hold to the abhihitânvaya-vâda.[O bjections of th e A nvitäbhidhäna-väda and th eir rebuttal.]Now the school of anvitäbhidhäna25 holds dearly to the doctrine that “the word’s meaning is that to which the word [finally] leads,” and would have it that the denotative operation continues longer and longer, like the course of an arrow.26 We ask them: if the operation continues so long, how can it be one, for its objects will be various? And if it is more than one, it stands to reason that it consists in heterogeneous elements, because both its objects and its cooperating causes are various.27 Fur­thermore, if its effects were homogeneous, it would have to pause at each object and then operate again. But such repeated operation of a word, an activity, or a cognition is ruled out by [all] metaphysicians,28 while if you admit that its effects are heterogeneous, why, this is our very position.But perhaps our opponent, in speaking of longer and longer opera­tion, means only that the meaning found in the last stage of apprehen­sion is expressed so rapidly by the sentence [that this final, suggested meaning appears to be furnished by the initial semantic operation]. But how can this meaning possibly be understood when there is no convention connecting it [with word or sentence]? Our opponent may apswer that conventions subsist between the causal factors [namely, the individual words and their meanings] and are therefore unnecessary be­tween the result and its meaning. Now, look at the skill of this Vedic scholar! Here he is saying that the later understanding of the individ­ual words—for according to his theory it does come later—becomes a cause of the meaning which occupies the final stage, a meaning which [according to his theory of semantics] enters the apprehension first. Why, this Mlmämsaka might claim to be the descendant of his own great-grandson!Our opponent might claim that such understanding [viz., of the final meaning] occurs only to one who has previously been initiated into the conventions [of the initial, denotative meanings]; and because the mat­ter stands thus, the [initial] meanings do act as a cause. But by recourse to this argument he would not be saying anything of use.29 Further­more, in our opponent’s theory there is no previous understanding of the individual word-meanings, for they are invariably used in sentences§ 1.4 b L ]"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"90[which are understood as wholes before the meaning of their compo­nents can be inferred). If he says that such understanding does in­deed come about by insertion and removal (äväpodväpäbhyäm) ,30 this is tantamount to saying that the convention applies to individual words [which are general] and that the understanding of the specific [sentence meaning) comes later.Now [the anvitäbhidhänavädin] may say, “The final sentence meaning occurs to us immediately; there is no way around it.” This is a fact that we too are not unwilling to accept. Our author will go on to say:Just so does the suggested sense flash forth in an instant in the minds of the intelligent auditors who are averse to the literal sense and in quest of the real meaning (1.12 K).But this is because the auditor has considered the subject so often that the succession, which must be hypothesized,31 is not felt, because there is no overt manifestation of succession among notions that belong to the same category, just as we are unaware of succession in our memory of concomitance and verbal convention.32 A relation of cause and effect [between the initial meaning and the final meaning] must be accepted if we are to keep the secondary sense, of either metaphorical (gauna) or relational (läksanika) type,33 distinct from the literal sense, or [if our opponent is] to avoid impugning the doctrine that “of the sue exeget- ical criteria—direct statement (sruti), implication (Unga), etc.—each that follows in the list is weaker than those which precede” (MïmâmsâS. 3.3.14), for this can only be justified by the causal efficacy [of dif­ferent sorts of meaning]. And if you accept a variety of causal efficacy, what point is there in your ill will toward us?[R em arks on th e Sphotavâda.]Those too who claim that both sentence and sentence meaning are an indivisible entity called the sphota, when they descend into the world of communication,34 follow our system in all respects. Above that world, of course, everything is brahma, which is identical with God Supreme: a point of view not unknown to our author, who also wrote a work called Tattväloka,35 So now enough.[B hattanäyaka’s in terp retatio n refuted.]Bhattanäyaka has said: “In this verse our understanding of the pro­hibition is brought about by the entrance of bhayänaka-rasa (the flavor[ § 1.4 b L"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"91of the timorous) through the use of the words ‘fierce lion,’ etc., with the use of the word ‘pious,’ for there would be no understanding of the prohibition in any other way if we lacked an understanding of the two characters [portrayed] here as fierce and as ti id respectively. So it is not simply the suggestive force of the situation that causes this understanding.” 36To this we reply [as follows]. Who ever said that without an under­standing of the particular speaker and the particular person addressed, and without the operation of suggestion that belongs to the words, there could be an understanding of the prohibition? We have said that it is essential to suggestion that it be helped out by the imagina­tion of the hearer. And we do not [even] rule out the entrance of the bhayânaka-rasa, for we admit that it may arise from a simple [emotion (bhäva) of] fear. And this rasa may enter the hearer37 if the rasa is manifested [in the verse]. But the rasa must be suggested. Its being directly denoted is not admitted even by Bhattanäyaka; so it must be suggested. Furthermore, this rasa does not necessarily enter the hearer, for the sensitive reader is not necessarily similar to the timid monk. Or, if Bhattanäyaka supposes a special nature of the reader (viz., that he must be aesthetically sensitive to fear] to be a cooperating cause [in producing rasa], why should he be so opposed to an operation of sug­gestion enlivened by the imagination of both speaker and hearer? What is more, by trying to deny vastudhvani in the verse, he has made out a case for rasadhvani. What a powerful critic of dhvani he turns out to bè! As has been said, “Even the anger of a god is like a gift.”If he should claim that all that has been shown [by this example] is the supremacy of rasadhvani, who would deny it? But then, he might say, it was not right to adduce this verse as an example of mere vastudhvani To this we reply that as this example is of poetry, let it exemplify two types of dhvani-, what harm is there?38 But if he insists on the mixture with rasa, know that a mixture with the bhayänakarasa does not sit well in the mirror of a connoisseur’s heart. Rather (the connoisseur will feel that] in this verse there is the erotic rasa, which arises in the manner we have described,39 from a mixture of vibhävas and anubhâvas: we have the trysting place serving as a vibhäva (stimulating determinant) of the [basic emotion which is] the desire for intercourse; and we have such anubhâvas (symptoms) as a specific tone of voice appropriate [to the mention of a trysting place].It is because rasa is unworldly and cannot be understood straight off that the author has begun with this example of vastudhvani, intending§ 1.4 b L }"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"92thereby to exhibit [an instance of literal and suggested meanings that are] indisputably distinct, (viz.,) injunction and prohibition.As for him who set himself up as an explainer of dhvani and said that it was nothing but the power of sentence-meaning ( tàtparya-éakti) or inference of intention (vivaksâ-sûcakatva) , 40 he does not appeal to us. As they say, “Each to his own taste.” 41 As we shall deal with this later in the book as occasion arises, let the matter rest for the present.[Glossing th e words of th e verse.)Go your rounds: you are permitted; it is time for you to wander. Pious monk: it is appropriate for you to wander about gathering flowers for püjä. Freely: because of the removal of the cause of your hesitation. T he little dog: viz., he who caused your slender little body to tremble with fear. Ju st today: the sense is that you have had a stroke of luck. Killed: so he will not appear again. Lion: that lion whom you heard about from hearsay and who lives in the thickets along the Godavari. For, to protect [her trysting place] she had already seen to it that he was told [of such a rumor].42 But now, because of his fierceness, he has emerged from the thickets. So the monk’s going anywhere near the bank of the Godavari is out of the question; how much more his entering the thickets. 11. The word tatra (“in that place”) is misleading. If the dog had fright­ened the mendicant from the trysting place, there would be no reason for the woman to invent a lion by which to terrify him further. We prefer the interpretation given above (1.4 b A, note 1). 2. The quotation is said to befrom Mandana Misra (so Jhalkikar on KP, p. 44). The full line is: xrisesyam näbhidhä gacchet ksinasaktir msesane, “as the power of direct designation is exhausted in [denoting] the classifying character, it cannot operate on the classified individual.” Mandana followed the Mïmâmsâ theory that words de­note class characters or universals. When we say gäm änaya, “bring ... cow” (Sanskrit lacks the definite article), the word gam refers directly to gotvam (bovinity). The sense of a particular cow, or the cow, characterized by bovin­ity, is given only by the sentence meaning, which depends on context. The verse here quoted is Mandana’s refutation of an opponent who argues that the word gäm might denote both the universal and the particular. It cannot do so, he says, because the abhidhà (power of direct designation) in a word dies after it has once operated. Abhinava in the present passage uses Mandana’s dictum to show that we cannot let bhama (“go” or “walk”) in the exem­plar verse designate directly two different things (“go your round” and “do not go into the thickets”). It can mean directly only one of these; the other( § 1.4 b L"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"93meaning must be furnished by a different semantic power, viz., suggestion.3. The abhihitänvaya doctrine, held by the BhättarMTmämsakas, or followers of Kumärila, holds that the final sentence meaning (tätparya) is furnished by the syntax (anvaya) of the directly expressed (abhihita) meanings of the individual words. The meanings of the individual words are universals; the tätparya is specific. The doctrine is directly opposed to the anvitäbhidhäna view of Prabhàkara, which argues that there is no need for two semantic pow­ers here. All meanings, according to Prabhàkara, are specific, the signification (abhidhäna) of words being understood only with reference to the specific acts and situations in which they are involved (anvita). 4. The three operationsthat Abhinava here points to are abhidhä, tätparya, and vyanjana (dhvanana). But he will go on to allow, for the sake of argument, the possible presence of another operation, laksanä. 5. If you tell a boy ugäm änaya,” he cannot direct his action to the class character bovinity. He can only act with regard to a particular cow. 6. Accordingly, we are forced to understand these sentences by the semantic power of laksanä (secondary usage or metonymy). They mean, respectively, “There is a village on the bank of the Ganges,” and “The boy is brave as a lion.” Note that the Sanskrit sentence gangäyäm ghosah, unlike the English translation, “a village on the Ganges,” is literally impossible. The locative case does not have as wide a span of meaning as the English preposition “on,” which may mean “by the side oP’ as well as physically “on top of.” The Sanskrit phrase means literally “a village situ­ated in the Ganges,” so if we take the phrase literally, we will suppose that the inhabitants are drowning. 7. The words na hi (Kashi ed. p. 57, line 2; Vidyäbhavana ed. p. 55, line 2) construe with käcit ksatih (Kashi 57.5; Vidy. 55.5). 8. If one admits that laksanä is at work in the verse *bhama dham-mia” the nature of the verse’s suggestion (dhvani) will differ from what it was taken to be when the operation of laksanä was denied. Without laksanä the suggestion in the verse is a vastudhvani that takes the form of a prohibition, viz., “you must not wander into the thickets by the river.” With laksanä, the prohibition is furnished by laksanä and the suggestion becomes a rasadhvani, viz., a suggestion of the love between the speaker of the verse and the man she hopes to meet at the tryst. 9. A standard example of absurdity; see Jacob’s Handfull of Maxims III. p. 4. It can become reasonable under cer­tain circumstances; see 3.331 L, note 9. But the point here is merely that an absurd sentence has syntax and is meaningful.10. Literally, “Why should there be no apprehension of syntax here, as in ‘ten pomegranates,’ etc.?\" BP says that Abhinava here furnishes an ex­ample by giving the opposite (vaidharmyena drstäntam äha). “Angulyagre,” etc., does have syntax; \"dosa dädimäni,” etc., does not. The latter quota­tion is from Mahäbhäsya on 1.1.3, Värt. 2 (repeated on 1.2.45). It became a standard example of word groups that are meaningless because of lack of syntax. The full quotation is: dosa dädimäni sad apüpäh kundam ajäjinam§ 1.4 b L ]"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"94palalapindah adharorukam etat kumäryäh sphäyakrtasya pitä pratisinah, “ten pomegranates six pancakes basin goatskin sesamum seed-cake petticoat this of a girl of sword-maker’s-son the father curdled.\" The individual words have meaning and one can even make sentence meanings out of some of the compo­nent parts by supplying the verb to be (e.g., “there are ten pomegranates\"), but there is still no syntax of the whole. The whole is not absurd but mean­ingless. 11. The fact that suggestion is found in many utterances—it is found in connection with all tropes and metonymies unless they have become frozen—does not cheapen it. It remains the central and most essential element in poetry. If one seeks a more precise nomenclature, one may call the unpo- etic uses of suggestion vastudhvani, saving the term rasadhvani for the type of suggestion that is poetically effective. 12. Abhinava here gives his clearest proof of the difference between dhvani and laksanä\\ the matter is not treated by Ànanda untii later on (1.14) and his distinction is not so clear. 13. The inference “That village possesses holiness because it is close to the Ganges” suffers from ambivalence because the hetu “proximity to the Ganges\" occurs in mpaksa objects (e.g., unholy objects such as filth and dead bodies) as well as sapaksa objects (holy objects such as temples or the village in question). For the fault of anaikäntikatva in inference, see N.S. 1.2.5 and the commen­taries thereon. 14. An illusory probans (asiddha-hetuh.) is one which does not really occur in the minor term (paJfcsa). For example, if we argue hrado vahnimän dhümät, ‘the lake contains fire because it has smoke,” the probans, smoke, is asiddha, for there really is no smoke on the lake. Now there may be mist or fog on the lake, but a probans in the specific form (rüpa) of smoke is absent. Hence the probans in such an example may be more precisely termed svarvpäsiddha: “not found in that specific form in the paksa.\" To come to the case at hand: the Mlmâmsaka wishes to argue that we arrive at the notion of the boy’s extraordinary courage by an inference: the boy has extraordinary courage because he is simhasabdaväcya, \"denoted in a primary sense by the word ‘lion’.” But that is just the point. The boy is not so denoted; he is denoted, that is, spoken of in a primary sense, by the word “boy.” So the Mlmâmsaka must substitute a different inference. 15. An inference must always be backed up by perception and memory. If someone says, ‘The boy is courageous (paräkmmavän mänavakah),\" we can infer courage to be a prop­erty of the boy, because we have perceived courage in a number of persons who were directly denoted to us as paräkramavän and we have a memory of those perceptions. But in the case of a metaphor no such background exists. We will have observed \"lion” used metaphorically of persons who are cruel, royal, proud, or courageous. Without any rule of association (niyama) we cannot determine by inference what the speaker’s intended meaning (vivaksita) may be. We can arrive at that knowledge not by inference, nor by the previously mentioned powers of the word and sentence, but only by a separate power, sug­gestion, as Abhinava proceeds to demonstrate. 16. The samaya is between[ § 1.4 b L"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"95the word ganga and a river, not between ganga and purity, etc. 17. The operation of abhidhä that runs from the word ganga to a river runs a direct course. The operation of laksanà starts out from ganga for a river but then shifts course to a river bank or some such nearby object. Accordingly, it runs an interrupted course. The course that runs from ganga to the suggested meaning of purity again runs a direct course, being in this respect like the denotative operation and unlike the operation of metonymy. 18. Abhinava means that the term has been used only in order to avoid using the correct term \"suggestion.” The term laksitalaksanä misrepresents the basic nature of the operation, which is not a laksanà at all because it lacks skhaladgatitva. 19. The substance and often the very words of the foregoing paragraph are repeated in Mammata’s Sabdavyäpäravicära, pages 5-6.20. The words tadanyathänupapattyä have given the commentators trou­ble. The Kaumudis explanation, which takes tad to refer to abhidhdsakti. seems the simplest. The power to convey a sentence meaning, a meaning which is of a specific situation that exists in the external world, is helped out by the fact that the individual word-meanings cannot be found in the world without it. In gäm änaya. “bring the cow,\" the väcyärtha, bovinity, cannot be found except as characterizing an individual cow such as we find in the sentence meaning. Hence we are forced to go on from the literal sense of the individual words to the specific sense of the sentence. 21. \"The preced­ing” (etad) refers to everything that has been said in the English translation from “Or, we may even admit,” page 85, up to the present point; in the San­skrit, from bhqvatu vdsau (Kashi ed. 57.7 to 63.2; Vidyäbhavana ed. 55.7 to 61.3). 2 2. The reference is to the two types of suggestion which are basedon Igksanä: atyantatiraskrtaväcya and arthäntarasaiikramitaväcya. They are described and identified later on (2.1 a-c). 23. Having given up the “admis­sion for the sake of argument,” Abhinava comes to what he believes the nature of the suggestion truly to be in the verse in question. It belongs to the second great class of suggestion, called vivaksitänyaparaväcya (2.1 Introduction and 2.2 .4. note 1). Within this class it belongs to the type samlaksyakramavyangya (2.2 K) and within that type to the sub-group arthasaktimüia (2.20 K). In other words, he has now given up the interpretation by which the object suggested was taken to be the saving of the trysting place and the adulterous intentions of the speaker. The object is now taken to be the prohibition of the monk from wandering into the thicket. This is vivaksitänyaparaväcya because the literal meaning (a permi ion) is subordinated to something else which is primarily intended. It is samlaksyakramavyangya because we are aware of an interval between our understanding of the literal meaning and our understand­ing of the suggestion, as is not the case in rasadhvani. It is arthasaktimüia because the suggestion is based on the force of the situation rather than on that of an ambiguous word. 24. A difficulty has arisen, which Abhinava seeks to solve by an analogy. The difficulty is this. How is it that the very§ 1.4 b L ]"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"same words, “go your rounds freely, pious monk,” may be said according to one theory to have the power and the operation of laksanà and according to another theory may be said to have the power and the operation of sugges­tion? This is possible, says Abhinava, by a change of cooperating causes. BP explains. If we suppose a blocking of the primary meaning to occur because that meaning is incompatible with “fearful lion,” etc., a power of laksanä will arise in the words “go your rounds”; and the laksita meaning will be “do not go your rounds.\" On the other hand, if we are not aware—as we ought not to be, according to Abhinava—of this blockage and if, instead, we are aware of some special characteristic of the speaker (an adulteress) or of what she seeks to convey, a power of suggestion will arise in the words. An analogy is furnished by the word “Devadatta,\" let us say, in the sentence “This is Deva- datta.” The word may operate in the realm of inference, if we are seeking to infer that the speaker has an intention to convey certain information. It may operate within the realm of perception if we are seeking to form a determinate perception of the indeterminate thatness in front of our eyes. The powers that arise in words depend on the causes that cooperate with words in giving us our cognitions. 25. That is, the followers of Prabhäkara; see note 3 above. 26. The Prabhäkara doctrine of word-meaning is brought up again at 3.33 d L (the long operation). The Kaumudi here gives the following explanation of the simile of the arrow. Just as a swift-handed bowman might shoot an ar­row that would pierce his enemy's armor, then take the man’s life and finally enter the earth, just so a single denotative operation may run on to the final stage of our comprehension, leaping through the intermediate stages. As so much of what Abhinava says in this section, this too has been taken over by Mammata (KP 5, Jhal. ed. p. 225, and Anand. ed. with Govinda and Nâgojï, p. 213). 27. Its objects: the literal meaning, the secondary meaning, thesuggested meaning. Its cooperating causes: the convention, the blocking of the literal meaning, the special properties of speaker or context. 28. Cf. Sahara 1.1.25: padani hi svam artham abhidhäya nivrttavyäpäräni and cf. note 2 above. But the doctrine extends farther than to words. A given action carries only one result. If we do one good deed, we reap the benefit of that good deed only once; we do not continue to enjoy the benefit time after time. We make a valid cognition only once; it is valid only for the time at which we make it. We may perceive smoke on the mountain and infer that there is fire there now. We may not, after perceiving smoke today, infer tomorrow that there is fire there. 29. BP: “Because the person who has learned the conventions would understand the meaning that is conventionally associated with the denotative meaning (i.e., the meaning of the first stage). How would he come to understand the meaning of the final stage, for which there is no convention?”30. Insertion and removal (äuäpa-vdväpa) is the method, according to the anvitäbhidhäna-väda and other schools, by which a child learns the meaning96 [ § 1.4 b L"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"of words; see KP ed. Jhalkikar, p. 2 2 1; ed. Anand. with Govinda and Nàgojl, p. 210. A child hears an older man say, “Devadatta, bring the cow,” and ob­serves a younger man go and bring a cow. Later the child hears such sentences as “Caitra, bring the cow,” “Devadatta, bring the horse.\" By the removal of words from, and the insertion of words in, the various slots of a sentence, the child gains a knowledge of the meaning of the individual words. 31. Becausecause must precede result. 32. “The same category\": verbal, inferential, etc. We jump from the notion of Ganges to purity and holiness without aware­ness of the succession of our ideas, just as on seeing smoke we almost instantly conceive of fire, without being conscious of the concomitance, “where there is smoke there is fire”; or just as, on hearing the word “cow,” we understand the object cow without consciously remembering the convention, “the sound 'c-o- w’ shall represent the class notion underlying an object with horns, hoofs, tail, etc.” 33. Cf. 1.1 K, note 2. 34. Abhinava is not fair here to the sphota-väda. The grammarians conceived of sphota in the world of ordinary commu­nication (vyavahära, avidyä) as well as in the rarified metaphysical world of param brahma. For sphota, see John Brough, ‘Theories of General Linguistics in the Sanskrit Grammarians,” Transactions of the Philological Society, 1951, and “Some Indian Theories of Meaning,” ibid., 1953; also K. A. Subrahma- nia Iyer, “The Doctrine of Sphota,” Journal of the Ganganatha Jha Research Inst., Voi. 5, Pt. 2. 35. Presumably, this lost work dealt with metaphysics.The only other reference to it, so far as we know, is again by Abhinava; see4.5 L and note 9. 36. See Corrections of the Kashi Text. Here, as elsewhere,Bhattanäyaka’s effort is to deny the need of positing dhvani in order to explain the verse. He supposes that a feeling of rasa is brought about by the verse’s bhävakatva, its possession of bhävanä or aesthetic efficacy. See Introduction, pp. 35-36 and 2.4 L. It here consists of the poet’s having so arranged the words as to impress on us the terror of the pious monk. Once we relish aes­thetically the monk’s emotion, we shall understand ipso facto that the words of the verse amount to a prohibition. The term artha-sämarthya (“suggestive force of the situation”) is approximately equal to vastudhvani. 37. It is a cause of some confusion in this passage that the same word, pratipattr, is used for the hearer in the verse, i.e., the pious monk, and the hearer of the verse, i.e., the reader or connoisseur. In the phrase tlaktrpratipattrvisesâvagama the former must be meant. In pratipattrpratibhä and in pratipattus ca rasävesah the latter is meant. 38. The point is this. In a work of philosophy it would be considered a fault to give an example that illustrates two principles at once when you are concerned oniy with one. But in poetry to do so is inevitable, since so many verses contain more than one excellence. So Kau- mudi, p. 129: bahuvisayatväd ekasyäpi kävyasya niyatagocaratvät. 39. By “the method we have mentioned” is meant the method of suggestion fol­lowing upon the literal sense. The thirty-nine syllable compound beginning sambhoga- is curiously compressed. Abhinava means that the srngârarasa§ 1.4 b L ]"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"arises from a combination of anubhävas appropriate to a iribhäva of the sthäyi- bhäva.40. None of the commentators has identified the person to whom Abhi- nava is referring in this passage. Tätparyasakti for dhvani would be a likely substitution for a MTmämsaka. The Kaumudi finds the substitution of vivaksä- sücakatva to be characteristic of a Buddhist. 41. Ragh. 6.30. If this was not a proverb before Kalidasa's time, it has become one since. 42. Abhinava's incorrect interpretation of the verse here leads him to a farfetched hypothesis.98 [ § 1.4b LA Sometimes when the literal meaning is a prohibition, this [sug­gested meaning] takes the form of an injunction (or invitation), as in: Mother-in-law sleeps here, I there: look, traveler, while it is light.For at night when you cannot see you must not fall into my bed. * 11. The verse is a variant of Sattasaï 7.67, which has been imitated by the Sanskrit verse SRK 812. As in the case of the verse in 1.4 b above, one may analyse in either of two ways. If one finds no laksanä in the verse, the suggestion will be simply an invitation to the traveler to come to the woman’s bed. Presumably this was Ananda’s understanding. If one takes the invitation to be conveyed by laksanä, the suggestion will be of the woman’s love of the traveler. Visvanätha gives this the title rasäbhäsa rather than rasa because the underlying love is adulterous; see SD, p. 26, prose following the 9th verse quoted after 1.2.L [After translating the Prakrit stanza into Sanskrit, Abhinava continues:] In the Prakrit, maha is an irregular form used in many senses. Here it has the sense of the genitive plural (“our”), not the genitive singular.1 Had she referred specifically to herself, she would have aroused suspicion2 and so have been unable [later] to receive him secretly.[The situation is this.] The sprout of love has suddenly arisen in a traveler as he looks at a young woman whose husband is away from"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"home. By means of this prohibition she gives him permission. So, what we have here is an injunction that consists in the absence of prohibition. It is not a command, setting someone to do that which he has not set about, for such would be insulting to her opinion of her own charms. In keeping herewith is her hint in the word Tätryandha ( “blind at night” ) that he will be out of his senses with the desire that will come over him at that opportune time. As an action and its absence are self- contradictory, it is clear that the suggested sense is here different from the denoted sense.Bhattanäyaka has said: “In this verse too, as in the preceding verse, the meaning is furnished verbally,1 * 3 by the woman’s conveying her state of desire by the use of the word T (in 'I sleep there’) accompanied by particular gestures.” We reply that the word “I” does not directly denote this sense (of sexual eagerness]; while if. in conjunction with a tremor of the voice, it may hint at this sense, that may count as a help to the theory of dhvani. not a hindrance.From the word \"mother-in-law” it follows that he must make love quietly so that it may not be known. And in speaking of \"this miserable day” (divasaka) 4 she suggests, “I know that your heart is being shot in pieces by volleys of Love’s arrows and that I should take heed of you, but what can I do? The contemptible daylight is still with us.” It is [called] contemptible because it is unsuitable for love. In Prakrit the distinction of masculine and neuter does not hold.s “Nor do I fail entirely to take heed of you, as I remain right here. So look at me. I am not leaving you. We can get through the day with the solace of looking at each other’s face.” Such is the meaning. And there is a suggestion that “you should not join me in bed, being blinded [by passion], the very minute it grows dark, but should be very secret and wait until you have discovered that sleep has overtaken this thorn in my flesh called a mother-in-law.”1. Maha, or, according to the Kaumudï reading, maham, is irregular and is used for v ious cases of the singular first person pronoun: accusative and genitive, the latter of which may also substitute for the dative. But it seems never to be used for the plural. The reason that prompts Abhinava to thisinterpretation is his overrefinement of the woman's character. 2. Abhinava supposes that the words are spoken in the presence of the mother-in-law.3. Änanda has quoted the verse as an example of vastudhvani, a sugges­tion which arises artha-sämarthyät (“from the capability of the situation”). Bhattanäyaka is saying that the suggestion here does not arise from the sit­uation; it arises from a skilful use of the word ''aham.\" 4. Abhinava is§ 1.4c £ ] 99"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"100interpreting the word diasaam of the Prakrit as though it formed an elliptical sentence, standing for divasako 'yam, “This is miserable daytime.” He takes the suffix to be the -Jfca of contempt given in Pan. 5.3.74. The interpretation is wrong on both counts and forces him to find a reason for the supposed neuter gender of the word. It is not neuter, of course, but accusative masculine: “during the daytime.” 5. This is to explain how diasaam has been used in the neuter (see preceding note). Actually, the grammarians permit divasa to be used as a neuter even in Sanskrit (Gana on Pan. 2.4.31 and AK 1.1.3.5), but we do not remember ever having seen it so used.[ § 1.4c LA Sometimes the literal meaning is in the form of an injunc­tion,while the suggested meaning takes a form that is neither [injunc­tion nor prohibition]. Thus,Go, and let the sighs and tearsbe mine; nor let them risefrom you as well, tortured,being without her, by your hateful courtesy. * 11. Found in a non-Vulgate version of the Sattasat (Weber 944). The literal sense of cd is probably “May they not arise from you, being without her, destroyed by your courtesy.” But dakkhinna-haassa could (it is just possible) stand for hata-dâksinyasya, “possessing hateful (damned) courtesy.” Weber’s suggestion that haasa may represent hrtasya is improbable. The point of the verse lies in the lady’s fury at her lover’s affectionless politeness. Whether she says that the politeness is damned or that he is damned is not important. But it would ruin the verse to say that he is “carried away (hrta) by politeness.”L Here the word “go” is an injunction. We understand from the verse the intention of a woman who has been slighted1 and whose pride has been deeply wounded. Her intent is: “Your union with this other mistress was not a careless adventure, but arose from the deepest love, as may be seen from your change of color and from your having inadvertently called me by her name. You remain here only out of the"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"101courtesy [of pretending] to maintain our former relationship. You are a complete hypocrite.” There is no [suggested] prohibition here in the form of not letting him go, nor is there a non-prohibition in the form of some other injunction.1. Khanditâ (“slighted”) has been defined by BhNÉ 22.217 as a woman whose lover fails to visit her at the accustomed time. What is there meant is probably a lady of the harem who misses out on her “tum.” SD defines the word as one whose lover arrives bearing signs of having enjoyed another. In the present instance the sign of the lover’s faithlessness seems to have been his calling the speaker by another woman’s name (gotraskhalana).§ 1.4e A ]A Sometimes the literal meaning is in the form of a prohibition, while the suggested meaning takes a form that is neither [prohibition nor injunction]. Thus,TVim back, I beg you. You are making trouble for other ladies stealing to their lovers.The moonlight of your countenance destroys their covering darkness, wretched woman. 11. Supplement to Sattasai (Weber, No. 968). Cf. also Hemacandra AC 1.22 (K.Anit. p. 55) and Mahimabhatta p. 747. The verse is addressed to an abhisärikä, a woman who steals forth at night to visit her lover. The simple explanation of the stanza is that it is merely complimentary. One may remark further that much of the charm of the verse comes from its having hatäse for the 1 t word, using it only after the pretty compliment has shown that the lady in fact is far from being what that term implies. Hatâée has much the same double sense that “wretched woman” has in English. It can be a term of compassion, if used of a woman who is truly wretched, or a term of reproach, if used of a woman who is vicious or cruel. The lady of our verse is shown, on the other hand, to be both beautiful and loving. But the simple explanation meets with a difficulty. In 2.4 and 2.5 our author will distinguish true dhvani, where the predominant meaning is a suggested rasa, from figures of speech like preyo'laiikära (“a figure of complimentary address”) which in­volve a subordinate use of dhvani. Now by the simple explanation the present"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"102verse would exemplify preyo'lankâra rather than true dhvani. I doubt that this would have troubled Änanda, who is not concerned at this point with whether dhvani is used for final meaning or as a subordinate element. But the difficulty did trouble Abhinava and is the cause of his whole comment.[ § 1.4e AL “De” is a particle used in making a request. “À” has the sense of “tavat”\\ so the meaning is: “Just turn back please,” etc. As we understand the stanza to say “turn back” from your intended going, the literal sense is a prohibition.[One might explain the suggested sense as follows:] A lady had come to her lover's house, where he had slighted her in some such way as addressing her by another’s name, whereupon she had started to go home. He now turns her back with this clever piece of flattery: “You are putting di culties in the way not only of your own pleasure and mine, but of those other ladies. You will never attain a drop of happiness. So you are a most ‘wretched woman.’” Here the suggested sense is a particular compliment that represents the true feeling of the lover [BP: viz., that no other woman is her equal].Or, [we might say that] a lady has been warned by her female friend not to go, but scorns the warning. Now the friend tells her, “Not only are you making difficulties for yourself, cheapening yourself by this light conduct, and so are a ‘wretched woman,’ but you are making difficulties for other women, stealing out to visit their lovers, by your lighting up the street with the moonlight of your countenance.\" Here the suggested sense is a particular compliment representing the feeling of the friend. 1But in both these explanations, [the suggestion] comes back to rest in the literal sense, namely, a request to desist: from the intention of going back home, or from her going to a lover’s house. And so this verse would be an example of a subordinated use of suggestion, that is of an alankära, either ■preyo’lankâra or rasavadalankära, and not of [what our author calls] dhvani. So let us explain as follows. A certain lady is hurrying to her lover at night, who in turn is on his way to her and meets with her on the way. Pretending not to recognize her, he addresses her with this stanza. That is why he adds “wretched woman” as a joke at the end, to let her know who he is: “You are causing difficulty for other women too, so how can you hope to receive your own desire? So either come to my house, or let us go back to yours.” So the suggested meaning is a clever compliment that represents an"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"103intention on the part of the lover, an intention that is in the form of neither [injunction nor prohibition] because the final sentence meaning allows of both.Others have explained the stanza as being the words of certain gen­tlemen of taste who happen to be present [as the lady passes by]. But I ask persons of taste whether it would be at all proper in such a case to use an expression like “wretched woman.”1. This is, essentially, the explanation that Mahi (p. 474).§ 1-4 f L ]A Sometimes the suggested meaning is made to be directed to a person (or persons) different from that (or those) to whom the literal meaning is directed. Thus:Who wouldn’t be angry to see his dear wife with her lower lip bitten?You scorned my warning to smell the bee-holding lotus. Now you must suffer.[Non-Vulgate Sattasai Weber No. 8 8 6 ]* 11. The stanza is quoted by Abhinava in Abh. on BhNÉ 18.123; by Mam- mata 5.135; by Hemacandra K.Anu. 1 vs. 25, who in his AC repeats the comments of the Locano.; and by SD on 5.2.L In the previous examples there has been shown to be a dif­ference between the literal and the suggested meanings even when the two meanings were addressed to the same person, viz., the monk, the traveler, the lover, or the abhisärikä. Now he shows that the suggested meaning may differ by its being addressed to a different person (or"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"persons) [from the person addressed by the literal): som etim es th e suggested m eaning, etc.W ho w ouldn’t: that is, even a man without jealousy would be angry if he even [thought that he) saw it, that is, if he noticed her lip as being wounded because it appeared different for some reason even if it had not been [wounded) . 1Is m ade to be directed: What he means is that although various persons lie in the direction of application, a sensitive reader can make out the correct direction. [Abhinava here gives a Sanskrit translation of the Prakrit verse, literally:] Who wouldn’t be angry on seeing his dear wife’s lower lip with a wound? O you whose habit it is to smell bee-concealing lotuses, you who are averse to being prevented, now you must suffer.O you whose habit it is to sm ell bee-concealing lotuses: be­cause a person’s habit cannot in any way be prevented. Averse: un­willing to accept. Being prevented: prevention. Now you m ust suffer: viz., a long and severe scolding.The meaning of the stanza is as follows. An unfaithful wife has had her lip bitten by a lover. To save her from her husband’s reproaches she is here addressed by a clever female friend, who knows that the husband is nearby but pretends not to see him. Now you m ust suf­fer: the literal sense is directed to the adulterous wife. The suggested sense, on the other hand, is directed to the husband and informs him that she is not guilty of offense.2 There is also a suggestion directed to the neighbors who, if they hear the wife being roundly abused by the husband, may suspect her of misconduct. The suggestion in this case is the assurance provided by this concealment of her adultery. There is a suggestion directed to her fellow wife, who would be delighted by the abuse of her rival and by [the news of) her adultery. The suggestion lies in the word d ear (“dear wife“ ) ,3 which shows that the wife addressed is the more attractive. There is a suggestion to the adulterous friend of the speaker, informing her, “You should not take on humiliation at the thought of being accused of bad character in front of your fellow wife; rather, you should take to yourself high esteem and now shine forth (so- hasva) .4 To the wife’s secret lover there is a suggestion, telling him that “Today I have thus saved your heart’s beloved who loves you in secret, but you must not bite her again in a place that is so obvious.” To any­one clever who is standing nearby the speaker’s cleverness is suggested, [as though she were to say,] “This is the way I have concealed things.” All of this is indicated by the expression is m ade to be directed.104 [ § 1.4 f L"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"1051. akrtvâ, even if it had not been wounded: this appears to be the inter­pretation of the Kaumudt and of BP. The grammatical interpretation, “see­ing her lip wounded even if he had not done it,\" makes no sense. Obvi­ously the husband would not be angry if he had bitten his wife’s lip himself.2. Most printed texts insert here the brief sentence: sahasvety api ca tad- visayam vyangyam, ‘There is also a suggestion that he must suffer.” The sentence is missing, however, from the MS used by the Nirnayasâgar edition. The trouble with it is that such a suggestion, if present, would be directed to the reader, not to the husband as portrayed by the poem. Päthak omits the sentence in his Hindi translation. 3. What I have translated as “dear wife\" is in Sanskrit a single word, priyâyâh, a word which has two meanings, “wife\" and “beloved.\" The literal meaning here is simply wife, but a sug­gestion arises sabdabalät, from the verbal force, to the effect that this wife is also her husband’s beloved, that is to say, the one of his wives that he finds most attractive. 4. In assigning the sense of sobhasva as a second meaning to sahgsva, Abhinava is probably following some Prakrit grammar. Hemacandra (8.)4.100 gives the root sah as a synonym of raj (ràjati). The Kavmvdi prefers the ancient Vedic meaning of sah, to win or overcome: “sa- hanam is here used in the sense of overcoming her fellow wife.” That any second meaning is intended in sahasva seems to me most unlikely.§ 1.4g A ]A Other differences of the suggested meaning from the literal meaning are possible along these lines. We have merely indicated the general direction. How the second variety of suggested meaning, viz., alankâradhvani, differs from the literal will be shown in detail in what follows. But the third variety, involving rasa, etc., which appears as something implied by the inherent capability of the literal sense but as an object on which no words can operate directly, must necessarily be different from the literal. This may be shown [more formally]. For if such states as raso are to be denoted, it must be either by reporting them under their own names, or through conveying them by means of the vibhävas, etc. 1 If the former were the case, it would follow that wherever the rasas, etc., were not reported by name there could be no apprehension of them. But it is not true that they are everywhere reported by name. Even where they are, our apprehension of them"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"106is through their being conveyed by means of particular vibhävas, etc. This apprehension, while it may later be referred to by name,2 is not produced by the naming, because in other cases we do not find it. For in a poem which merely uses such words as “erotic,” etc., but fails to convey the vibhävas, there is not even the slightest apprehension that the poem contains any rasa. And since there is the apprehension of rasas, etc., from particular vibhävas without any naming of these rasas and there is no apprehension of them from the mere naming of them, it follows by the application of positive and negative concomitance that the rasas, etc., are implied by the force of things that are literally denoted and are in no way denoted themselves. So it stands proven that the third variety [of suggested meaning] also is different from the literal meaning. That we apprehend it as though it were simultaneous with the literal meaning will be shown in what follows.1. This sentence lacks Änanda’s usual clarity, for the conveying of rasa by means of the vibhävas is not an instance of väcyatva (“being denoted”) at all. but of vyangyatva (“being suggested”). Abhinava tries to exculpate our author by supplying tätparyasaktyä. 2. This concession is worth remarking on. for it is generally overlooked by later älaiikärikas. Later authors were generally of the opinion that to use a word denoting the actual emotion ( bhäva) or rasa constituted a major fault, so much so that such cases could not be considered examples of dhvani. Änanda’s concession allows for such words if used as an anuväda (mere reference). The concession allows many fine poems to pass muster which are lowered in value by the later critics.[ § 1-4 g AL In w hat follows: viz., in Chapter Two, where suggestion in which the literal meaning is intended but is subordinated to a sec­ond meaning (vivaksitänyaparaväcya) is said to be of two types, “one where the suggestion is produced without apparent sequence [i.e., im­mediately, together with the primary meaning], the other where the sequence is apparent,” (2.2). There, in describing the second of these types, [the variety here referred to, namely alankära-dhvani, is dealt with in detail; see 2.20-21 and 25-26]. While it is easy to summarize vastu-dhvani under the heads of injunction, prohibition, and neither in­junction nor prohibition, it is not easy to summarize alankära-dhvani, because the figures of speech (alahkäras) are so numerous. And so he says: in detail.B ut th e th ird variety: the word “but” is used to point a contrast. In the first place, the property of being expressible by the denotative"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"107force of words [as well as by suggestion] attaches to a situation (vastu) or to a figure of speech (alankära). On the other hand, a rasa, an emotion (bhäva), an improper rasa or emotion, or the cessation of a rasa or emotion, are never directly denoted. They appear rather as matters that come to life in the process of being relished (àsvâdya- móna), and for this there is no explanation other than the operation of suggestion. For we cannot suspect as being here at work any of the conditions of laksanä, such as blocking of the primary meaning, because there is here no halting gait in the journey [from word to meaning; cf.1.4 b L, note 17].[D efinitions of rasa, rasäbhäsa, etc.]Rasa appears when a stable state of mind (cittavrtti), constantly di­rected toward 3 proper object, 1 is aesthetically relished. Bhäva appears when a transitory state is so relished. The improper variety (âbhâ- sa) of rasa or bhäva appears when either of them is directed toward an improper object, as when Râvana’s love is directed toward Sita.2 While that case really belongs to the comic flavor, in accordance with [Bharata's] dictum that “the erotic leads to the comic,'’3 that stage of realization overtakes the audience only later. Since the relish one ex­periences in the stage where one is identifying [the portrayed emotion with one’s own] is of love, the rasa will appear to be the erotic rasa as long as we overlook the broader context, as we do when hearing:I merely heard her nameand it acted as a magnet or a maddening charm.4 This is therefore a case of the improper or spurious erotic, [not of the comic]. An emotion (bhäva) which goes to form an improper rasa is an “improper emotion” (bhäväbhäsa). As the cessation or checking of an advanced emotion is especially delightful to the heart, it is separately mentioned [in the list that we just gave], although it is actually included [in the term bhäva].5 An example is:They lay upon the bed each turned asi and suffering in silence; though love still dwelt within their hearts each feared a loss of pride.But then from out the corner of their eyes the sidelong glances metand the quarrel broke in laughter they turned and clasped each other’s neck.8§ 1.4g L]"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"Here we have the cessation of a pride which has taken the form of jealous anger.7Now this suggested entity, rasa or the like, is not generated within us after the fashion that joy is generated from [the direct force of] the words “A son is born to you.” 8 Nor does it come from the sec­ondary power of the words. Rather, it makes itself felt (parisphurati) as something the whole life of which consists in the ongoing process of relishing and which thereby differs from something like joy or grief that is a finished or frozen state.9 This process of tasting arises in a sensitive person through his empathy upon apprehending the mbhävas and anubhävas, an empathy made possible by his heart’s being in tune with [the poetic message]. Our author states this: which appears as [something, etc.]. And so10 in these [instances of rasa, etc.] suggestion is an operation of a word as helped out by [that word’s literal] mean­ing. But this [literal] meaning, which will be a vibhäva or the like, does not generate an emotion like the joy generated by the birth of a son.

But although it is merely a reference to the anubhäva [which has been learned through non-direct means], the word is useful, as it is employed to draw together the stated anubhâvas [e.g., the sad song and tears of the heroine] with the word “yearning” [applied to the cry of the birds]. For if the poet had conveyed the whole set of anubhâvas all over again, the stanza would suffer from tautology and we should not empathize.Is n ot produced by th e m eaning:18 he gives the reason for this with the words, because in o th er cases, etc.; for example, in the stanza, “A tremulousness of the eyes,” (where there is no naming of the rasa or its components].

When the suggestion of rasa is ascribed to the directly denoted meaning—inasmuch as the suggestion of rasa is not a case of one thing’s begetting another, because of the different nature (yogaksema) of joy at the birth of a son; and not a case of one thing’s being inferred from another, because of the distinct nature of the inference of a man’s eating at night from the premise of his being fat compounded with his not eating in the daytime21—then the force (sâmartkya, sakti) of this meaning is the totality of denota­tive words arranged in their particular way.22 Thus the suggesting is an operation of both word and meaning. And so, in addressing the alter­natives [A, that rasa, etc., can be conveyed through the mere naming of a rasa, etc.; and B, that rasa, etc., are conveyed by one’s furnishing the vibhävas, etc.], the former has been refuted, while the latter has been partly refuted and partly accepted. If taken as meaning that the operation [by which the vibhävas lead to rasa, etc.] is a begetting or inferring, that is refuted; if taken as meaning that the operation is a suggesting, that is accepted.He who thinks that even here suggestion is nothing more than tätpar- yasakti (the power of the sentence meaning) does not know the truth of the matter. For in a sentence that conveys the vibhävas and anubhävas, the tätparyasakti exhausts itself in giving the syntax (samsarga) [of the sentence] or its difference [in meaning from that of other sentences];23 it does not concern rasa, the essence of which consists in the process of relishing.

The phrase avcityena pravrttau is taken from Udbhata (Induräja 4.5, Vivrti 4.9). 2. The rasa is improper because Sita is another’s wifeand because the emotion is not reciprocated. On the concept of rasâbhâsa see Sivaprasad Bhattacharya, Calc. Or. JL 2, pp. 237-247, and J. L. Masson and M. V. Patwardhan, Aesthetic Rapture I, p. 42 and II, pp. 57-58. The concept of rasâbhâsa is highly restrictive of literature. If we are to limit rasa, the sole aim of literature, to only such subjects as conform to propriety and even to the s ' tras, as Udbhata would have it, not a little of Sanskrit litera­ture and surely the greater part of Western literature will be judged to be of little worth. Abhinava seems to have been the first Indian critic to face this problem and find an answer: the âbhâsatva, the impropriety, of such experi­ences is something we realize only later; during the actual experience we are absorbed. 3. BhNÉ 6.39. The next verse specifies that it is when the erotic is parodied (srngârânukrti) that it becomes comic. 4. A larger fragment of this stanza is introduced at 2.3 L by the identification “Rävanakävye\" (see also Abh. 6.40), but whether this means “in a poem called the Râvanakâvya,” or merely “in a poem about Rävana” is not clear. The full stanza is given in Hemacandra’s AC on K.Anu. 2.55 as dürâkarsanamohamantra iva me tan- nâmni yâte srutim, cetahkâlakalâm api prasahate nâvasthitim tâm vinâ / etair âkulitasya viksatarater angair anangâtvraih sampadyeta katham tadâp- tisvkham ity etan na vedmi sphutam. 5. One might regard all the conditions of bhâva, such as bhâvodbhava, bhâvasandhi, bhâvasabalatâ, and bhâvapraâama (see 2.3 L) as being included in bhâva. 6. Amaru Éat. 23, quoted in nearly every anthology of Sanskrit, (a) vttottaram: probably, “without reply, in si­lence.\" BP’s interpretation “without any of the action that [normally] follows lying down in bed” seems to me farfetched. (6) The MS and anthologies vary between kanthagraham, adverb, and kanthagrahah, bahuvrihi. The for­mer makes for clearer syntax. 7. Whether one considers such verses as examples of bhâvapraâama or bhâvodaya depends on whether one finds more charm (camatkära) in the description of the ceasing emotion or the originating one. Mammata (4.51) quotes Amaru 22. a verse similar to the present one, as an example of bhâvodaya. 8. Abhinava would here make another, radical, distinction between suggestion and the other powers of words. The denotative and secondary powers (abhidhâ-sakti and laksanâ-sakti) are able to give us only cognitions or concepts. The joy that may follow from “You have a new§ 1.4g I ]"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"son,” or the grief that may follow from “Your unmarried daugher is.pregnant\" (KP ed. Jhalkikar, p. 229) is a subsequent development growing out of the word-meanings or concepts. In the case of suggestion, on the other hand, the meaning itself is the rasa, the flavor that we relish. Aesthetic pleasure is not the result of a meaning; it is the meaning itself. 9. Siddha-svabkâva: the comment ies, I think, fail to understand this term. BP's first explanation misunderstands the syntax, taking the whole compound as “different from sukha, etc., by being of a siddhasvabhäva,” as if it were sukha, etc., that were sädhya. Its second explanation agrees with the Kaumudi and supposes that sukhâdi stands for rati and the other sthäyibhävas. The correct interpreta­tion surely will connect sukhâdi with the put janmaharsa just referred to and shortly to be mentioned again. The contrast is between (a) the denota­tive force of words which produces a meaning, which in turn generates a fixed mental reaction, pleasure or grief, and (6) the suggestive force of words which produces an ongoing process of relishing or enjoyment.10. The Vrtti has stated that rasadhvani is vâcyasâmarthyâksipta. And so (fena) the suggestive power of the word must be helped out by a meaning, viz., the väcya meaning. 11. The literal meaning should not be said to help generate (janayati) the rosa; it should be said to help suggest (dhvanayati) the rasa. Abhinava is merely distinguishing the primary production of the rasas from the secondary production of pleasure and pain. Later, on 2.4, he will admit, even insist, that the rasas are produced (utpàdyante). 1 2. Ofthe ten words on the list, abhilâsa probably represents the sthäyibhäva, rati; the five words giant, srama, cintò, autsukya, and nidrâ axe listed by BhNi> 6.45 as denoting anubhâvas of vipralambhadrngâra; the three words älasya, smrti, and vitarka denote vyabhicäribhävas, listed in BhNÉ 7.47, 53, 91. Only of adhrti can I not furnish a technical assignment. 13. The negative con­comitance would be: “Where there are no words directly naming the rasa or its components, there is no rasa-experience.” 14. This would be in the form, “Wherever there are words directly naming the rasa or its components, there is a rasa-experience.” 15. The author of the stanza is unknown and the text of the first line is in question. All the printed texts write taddat- tajhampânatâm, “bent down by the leap which had been given by him.” It is certainly odd to speak of “giving one’s leap to a tree.” BP tries to make out that this was the tree from which Krishna leaped into the Kälindl. But the tradition is unanimous that that tree was a kadamba (Harivamsa 55.57, Visnu P. 5.7.10, Bhâg.P. 10.16.6), not a vanjula. Neither is it clear just what tree is here meant by vanjula, except that it cannot be a kadamba. The word is used for an asoka, or a syandana (=tinisa, the Anglo-Indian sissoo), or a reed. Whichever tree is meant, I prefer the reading of the Malayalam MS quoted by Kuppuswami Sastri in his edition of the Kaumudi, viz., taddattasampannatäm, and have translated accordingly. 16. The älambana-vibhävas are Krishna and Rädhä; the uddipana-vibhäva is the bank of the Kälindl; the anubhâvas[S 1.4g L"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"113axe embracing the vanjula, shedding tears, etc. 17. This is as much as to say that longing is thereby suggested. 18. One should place a danda after the words atanmayibhävo vä. In the text the words no tu tatkrta should be printed in boldface. 19. Viz., again by the use of positive and negative concomitance.20. The complicated and highly improbable interpretation which follows is occasioned by Abhinava’s desire to bring this statement, which ascribes the suggestion of rasa, etc., only to meanings (viz., to vibhävas, etc.), into line with the opinion elsewhere expressed by Änanda that the suggestion of rasa derives from both meaning and word. To accomplish this aim, Abhinava takes abhidheya-sàmarthya first as a karmadhäraya compound and next as a sasthi-tatpurusa. The meaning assigned to sämarthya differs in the one case from the other. 21. The stock example of the arihäpatti of the Mïmâmsâ. here reduced, as it is by the Nyäya, to an inference. 22. BP: put together with such punas and alankäras as are conducive to rasa. 23. That relating and differentiating are the two functions of the sentence is a notion first found in Itfahäbhäsya 2.1.1. Vàri. 2 (Kielhom ed., 1.364.24; S. D. Joshi, ed. and trans, of 2.1.1, para. 84). To explain: the sentence “Gâm ânaya” not only relates the object cow to the action of the addressed person; it differentiates the command from one concerning horses or concerning some other action.§ 1.5 K ]K It is just this meaning* 1 that is the soul of poetry. And so it was that, long ago, grief, arising in the first poet from the separation of the pair of curlews, became verse.1. In order to make sense of the Kârikâ, we must take “this meaning\" to refer not to the suggested meaning in general that was mentioned in 1.4 K, but specifically to rasa, etc., the third type of suggested meaning, which has been mentioned only by the Vrtti on 1.4. It was this element arising in Välmlki, whether one regard it with Änanda as the bhäva, soka, or with Abhinava as the karunarasa, that produced the first poem, for it is rasa, etc., that gives life to poetry as the soul gives life to the body. Note that Änanda’s concept of bhäva and rasa is much simpler than Abhinava’s. To Änanda rasa is no more than the sharpening of VälmTki’s emotion of grief. See Introduction, pp. 15-19. The quarter stanza élokah iokatvam ägatah is quoted from Ram. 1.2.39."},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"[ § 1.5 ilA It is just this [inner] meaning that is the essence of a poem, which has [outward] beauty in its wealth of direct meaning, word, and structure. 1 And so it was that the grief (soka) of the first poet, Vâlmïki, born of the wailing of the cock curlew desolated by loss of its slain mate,2 turned into verse (sloka). For grief is the basic emotion of the flavor of compassion (karunarasa) [which, as has been said, appears only as suggested].3 Although other types of suggested meaning may be found, they can all be supplied from the mention of rasa and bhâva because those are the most important.1. The phrase väcyaväcakaracanä recurs at 1.8A. What is here meant is the choice of word, direct meaning, and structure (degree of compounding and degree of phonetic harshness) appropriate to the rasa that is to be suggested and that forms the inner or essential meaning. Väcya is used in distinction from vyangya. 2. Both the reading and the sense of the passage have been questioned, wrongly. The reading nihatasahacari is found in the Kerala MS, in Krishnamoorthy’s MB MS (see p. 311 of his ed.), in the text of the Locana, and in the semi-quotations by Rajasekhara’s Käv.M. p. 7 and by Candidäsa’s Dipikä (see Krishnamoorthy loc. cit.). The reading sannihitasahacari occurs only in two of the Nirnaya Sagar MS (KM ed.). The difficulty with the sense is that in the form of the legend given in the Râmâyana, a form that every Indian schoolboy used to know, it is the male bird that was killed (Rdm. 1.2.10). It was the grief of the female bird that Vâlmïki transformed into verse. In order to reconcile these traditions the learned Kuppusväml Sâstrï ( Upalocana pp. 163-164) proposed an unnatural analysis of Änanda’s compound, taking nihata by a frog’s leap with kraunca instead of with sahacari. Pt. Badar! Näth Sarmä in his Dïdhiti emended the text. All needlessly. Änanda has altered the legend to suit his purposes. See J. L. Masson, “Who Killed Cock Kraunca,” J.O.I. Baroda 18 (3), March 1969. 3. The phrase pratïyamânarüpa evetipratipäditam, translated above by the words placed in brackets, appears in most of the MSS, but Abbinava makes no mention of it. One cannot say with certainty whether it has crept into the text from a marginal annotation or whether it has dropped out of an early copy of the text by haplography, the eye of the scribe having jumped from the initial word of pratïyamânarüpa to the pratïyamânasya of the next sentence. It is missing from the Kashi and Vidyäbhavan texts.L [C om m ent on th e Karikä:] So far, by stating that th e suggested, on th e o th er hand, is som ething different (1.4 K),"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"115the nature of suggestion has been explained. Now, by making use of a well-known legend, he will show that it is the soul of poetry: th e soul of poetry.It is ju s t this: while the antecedent is suggested meaning in general, what we are here to think of is the third variety, namely suggested rasa (rasadkvani), for that follows from the use of the legend and from the immediately preceding passage of the Vrtti So it is rasa that is the real soul of poetry. Vastudhvani and alaiikäradhvani, however, regularly end up in [producing] rasa, and it was in order to mark their superiority to the literal sense that he said [in 1 .1 K] that dhvani in general was the soul of poetry.Grief: That grief which arose from th e separation of th e pair of curlew s, that is, from the destruction of the mating arising from the killing of the bird’s mate, a grief which was a basic emotion differ­ent, because of its hopelessness, 1 from the basic emotion of love found in love-in-separation: that grief, by the poet’s ruminating upon its [d/am6ana-] vibhävas [i.e., the birds] in their [unhappy] state and on the anubhävas arising therefrom, such as the wailing [of the surviving bird], met with a response from his heart and with his identifying [of the bird’s grief with the grief in his own memory] and so transformed it­self into a process of relishing.2 It thus became the flavor of compassion (karunarasa), which differs from ordinary grief by its being experienced primarily as a melting of one’s thoughts.3 Then, like the spilling over of a jar filled with liquid, like the pouring forth of one’s emotion into a cry of lament, this [grief now transformed into the rasa of compassion] found its final form in a verse cast into fixed form of meter and into appropriate words, for cries of lament and the like are suggestive of a state of mind without the need of semantic convention; appropriate also because VälmTki was wholly engrossed and the words came from him naturally. His words were:May you never find honor, Nisâda, for everlasting years, who have shot the loving mate from this pair of curlew birds.4But we must not suppose that the sage experienced grief, for if that were the case there would be no occasion for calling rasa the soul [of poetry], as the poet would actually be in pain, pained by that grief.5 Nor does such a state [BP: the exalted state of being able to pronounce a curse, or to write a s7oA:a] belong to one who is afflicted with pain.§ 1.5 L)"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"116Thus, since it forms the nature of this overflow [viz., the verse just quoted] of the flavor of compassion, of which the abiding emotion is a grief amenable to relishing, this rasa is therefore the soul of poetry, that is, its essential nature, that which produces a result beyond the reach of any other word-powers [than suggestion]. It has been said [by Bhattanäyaka] in the Hrdayadarpana,Until he is filled with this rasa the poet does not spill it forth.[In the quotation given above from the Rämäyana] the form agamah shows Vedic retention of the augment.6It is ju st this: by the word “just” he would say that there is no other soul [of poetry]. Accordingly, Bhattanäyaka is wrong when he writes: “One may distinguish the éâstras by the prominence they give to the word. One knows that stories are wedded to meaning. One forms a just notion of a poem by subordinating these two, viz., word and meaning, and making the operation (vyâpâra) paramount.” For if the “operation” he speaks of is essentially suggestion and consists in relishing, he is saying nothing new, while if he means the operation to be denotation (abhidhä), we have already shown that it holds no prominence.7[ § 1.5 L[Com m ent on th e Vrtti.)The Vrtti comments on the [Aarifco’s] stanza.

That is to say, where we have the basic emotion grief, a thought-trend that fits with the vibhävas and anubhävas of this grief, if it is relished (literally, if it is chewed over and over), becomes a rasa and so from its aptitude [toward this end] one speaks of [any] basic emotion as becoming a rasa.10 For the basic emotion is put to use in the process of relishing: through a succession of memory-elements it adds together a thought-trend which one has already experienced in one’s own life to one which one infers in another’s life, and so establishes a correspondence in one’s heart. 11It may be objected that it is anything that takes the form of a sug­gested meaning that forms the soul [of poetry] and that three varieties of this [suggested meaning] have been stated, not simply that which takes the form of rasa, whereas the Välmlki legend seems to say that only rasa is the soul. Our author foresees this objection and accepts it, saying although o th er types o f suggested meaning: the other types are vastudhvani and alankäradhvani.The inclusion of the word bhâva indicates that even a transitory state (vyabhicäribhäva) may form the life of a verse although the rel­ishing of it is not complete in itself [but will go on to a relishing of a rasa] and although it never achieves the position of a rasa belong­ing to the final state of relishing a basic emotion.12 An example is the following:§ 1.5 L )Rubbing one nail with the tip of another, turning about her loose bracelet, slowly drawing a line on the earth, her anklet softly jingling ...Here we have [the transitory state of] shyness [forming the life of the [verse].Furthermore, by the words ra sa and bhäva there are included the improper varieties (äbhäsa) of these as well as the termination (pra- s'ama) of these, for although there are many sub-types, a single form runs through them all.Because these are th e m ost im p o rtan t: they are so because the other types end up in or lead to rasa. Vastudhvani and alankäradhvani, while they are not complete in themselves, can be called the soul of a verse from their aptitude, that is, because of their ability [also] to furnish [a delight] that lies beyond the reach of other word-powers."},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"1181. Grief characterizes not only karunarasa (the flavor of compassion or tragedy), but also that variety of the erotic flavor that is based on the sepa­ration of lovers (vipralambhasrngära). Between the two sorts of grief is this difference: the grief of tragedy, as in the present instance, expects no relief; the grief of separated lovers looks forward to reunion. The term nirapeksabhàva for the hopelessness of tragic grief is taken from BhNÓ 6.45, near end of prose. 2. The all-important transformation from the emotion, grief (bhâva, soka) of the character portrayed, to the relish ( äsväda) or flavor of compassion (karunarasa) of the poet or of his audience is here passed over very rapidly. Abhinava furnishes more detail at the end of his comment on the present pas­sage and in commenting on 1.18 and 2.4. The sympathetic response {hr daya- samväda) to the vibhävas and anubhävas is said to “transcend the experience of the workaday world\" (2.4 L). Where the Westerner may think of empathy as rendering Hamlet’s griefs and problems his own, Abhinava thinks of the process of empathy with, say, Rama, or with the grieving bird, as liberating one’s personal memory of grief into a universal, impersonal flavor. 3. This melting of the mind {druti) is one of the symptoms assigned to the relishing of rasa by Bhattanäyaka (2.4 L). The others are expansion (vistara) and ra­diance {vikäsa). At the end of 2.4 L, Abhinava somewhat grudgingly accepts these characterizations from his rival, but insists that they are not exhaustive.4. Ràmâyana 1.2.14. The pair of birds had been mating as the Nisäda shot, a fact that doubtless would have brought a curse upon him even if VälmJki had not been present to versify it; compare the curse of Pändu, MBh 1.109. The legend is built on a folk etymology deriving sloka from soka, and from the despised status of the Nisäda caste. As the incident is told at the beginning of the Ràmâyana, it has been taken as introducing the tragic flavor of that work. If we accept Änanda’s alteration of the story, one may take the hunter to foreshadow Rävana; the slain hen-bird, the kidnapped Sita; and the heart­broken survivor, Rama. 5. One must remember that Abhinava regards rosa as a form of bliss. Naturally it must be different from grief, which is a painful emotion. Here Abhinava is writing of the poet. On 2.4 he brings out the same contrast in the case of the audience: if they felt pain at a representation of the Ràmâyana story, for example, they would not return to the theater. Masson has written of the Indian recognition of the poet’s need to distance himself from his emotions before writing of them {Éàntarasa, p. 84). Ingalls would add that if we follow Abhinava’s account strictly, we must say that the poet in fact never writes of his griefs. He writes only of the griefs of others, which he has relished. By relishing them it is implied that he has lost his own griefs within them. This is a far more refined view than that of Änanda, who writes quite unconcernedly of the “grief of the first poet.” And Abhinava’s view, as Masson points out in the passage just referred to, differs from that of the Ràmâyana itself, which in narrating the incident speaks time after time of the poet’s grief and pity. 6. According to the Käsikä, such cases are covered by[ § 1.5 L"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"119the word bahulam in Pan. 6.4.75. They are noticed by Whitney, para. 579e.7. What Bhattanäyaka meant doubtless was neither. He must have meant the operations ( bhâvanâ, bhoga) of the word’s powers of bhâvakatva and bhogakrt- tva, these being the special terms by which he explained the nature of poetry; see Introduction, p. 36, and 2.4 L, near end. One may note that Vidyâdhara in his Ekävali (pp. 13-15) combines this triple distinction of Bhattanäyaka’s with Abhinava’s doctrine of the three vyutpattihetavah (means of instruction; see p. 71), but in doing so substitutes dhvanipradhäna for Bhattanäyaka’s vyäpärapradhäna. 8. Bhattanäyaka must have singled out 1.5 for criticism, saying that if suggestion in general is to be called the soul of poet , the title of poetry will be assigned to almost every sentence, as suggestion is found in every metaphor and trope. There are two ways to silence this objection: by showing that it is only rasadhvani that really qualifies as the soul of poetry; or by specifying other properties that poetry must have. Abhinava used the first way in commenting on the Kärikä. He now uses the second in commenting on the Vrtti. 9. Seer how subtly Abhinava alters the meaning of his text. We are not to think of the grief as belonging to Vâlmîki. The grief is the bird’s. It gives'birth in Välmiki not to grief but to a relishing of the bird’s grief.10. Note that this statement is metaphorical, not exact. It is one’s own cittavrtti (thought-trend, state of mind), not the basic emotion, that becomes the naso. How it does so is indicated in the next sentence. 11. It is this hrdayasamväda. (response of the heart) which permits the expansion and depersonalization of one’s own emotions. 1 2. It seems highly improbable that Änanda meant any such thing.

SarasvatT: He means that goddess in the form of speech. For the components of the compound arthavastu in the Kärikä, the Vrtti substitutes vastu for artha and tattva for vas tu. Pouring forth: giving forth from her very self the divine rasa of bliss. 1 As Bhattanäyaka puts it:Prompted by the thirst of these children,3 the cow of speech gives forth this rasa as her milk; to which the experience milked by yogis bears no comparison.For without the afflatus of this rasa,3 what the yogis milk they milk by force. [How different from the yogis are those who are found worthy to receive the gifts of a goddess will appear from the following lines:]The mountains made Himalaya their calf; then with Meni playing the skillful milkman and Prthu giving instruction to the mother, they caused to flow for him from Mother Earth her milk of mighty herbs and shining gems.4So runs the stanza [of Kälidäsa] which shows the worthiness of Himalaya to receive the most precious things.Reveals a v ibrant [genius]: The poet’s genius is not inferred by the audience, but shines forth with immediacy because of his inspiration with rasa.

As the sage [Bharata] has said: “[They transmit] the inner mental state of the poet.” 7 Thus it is: The sense is that the number of great poets is arrived at by counting those who reveal this special, vibrant genius.1. dnandarasam: that rasa which is bliss.

An extraordinary statement for Abhinava to quote with approval in view of the careful distinction which he makes elsewhere between the emotions of the hero and the aesthetic relish of the poet and audience. Of course the only point of the quotation here is to show a similarity of experience between poet and audience because of Sarasvatl’s gift of rasa. If only we could take nâyakasya as an objective genitive, all would be well; the poet’s and the audience’s experience of the hero is the same. 6.

The bhävas (the word is used in a very broad sense to include the vibhävas, anubhävas, and vyabhicäribhävas as well as the bhävas proper, all of which are to be described in BhNÓ 7) are so called because they transmit (bhävayan) to the audience the inner state (bhäva) of the poet. Here Abhinava takes the words to substantiate the statement of 1.6 that the words of great poets reveal their genius. The phrase is quoted again 3.41-42 a L.A Here is another proof of the existence of a suggested meaning:L H ere is: It is not only, as indicated in 1.4 K when it spoke of the suggested as something different, that literal and suggested sense may differ in nature and in the person to whom they are directed.

If this meaning were denotative, one would get to it by a knowledge of literal, denotative meanings and the words that convey them. But this meaning is beyond the range of those who have taken pains only on the definitions of words and who have paid no attention to the study of poetic meaning, just as the character of the notes (svaras) and srutis, etc., is beyond the range of those who know the definitions of music but are not good singers. 11. Text and meaning are doubtful. The reading iva pragitänäm (“just as of good singers”) is found in the KM ed. and in the three MSS on which it is based. All other MSS seem to read ivàpmgïtânâm (“just as ... of not good singers”). The Locano, says nothing of the negative, although the commentaries on the Locano infer or supply its presence: Kupp'isvämJ Sâstrî ad Kaumudï pp. 173-174, BP p. 95, and, most ingenious of all, Päthak (Vidyä- bhavana ed., foot of p. 95), who supposes that the Locana’s two explanations are furnished the one to fit apragita, the other to fit pragita. Despite all this ingenuity it is unparalleled for Abhinava to gloss the second half of a negative compound without mentioning the negative. Jacobi, who had only the KM ed. to work with, translated the passage: “wie solchen, welche nur die Theorie der Musik kennen, die individuelle ganze und Zwischentöne guter Sänger unkennbar sind.\" This destroys the parallelism of the sentence. We have chosen the reading with the negative and a translation essentially the same as Krishnamoorthy’s. If one accepts this reading of the text, one will explain the passage as follows.

A sruti is a change [of pitch] of such size as to make any alteration of a note. There are twenty-two of these srutis, formed of the notes, note-intervals, or both. 1 By the word “etc.” he would in­clude the [gramas or melody types] such as the jätyamsaka, grämaräga, bhâsâ, vibhäsä, antarabhäsä, desi, and mârga.2G ood singers (pragitäh): Those of whom the singing is good are called pragitäh. Or, those who have begun to sing are pragitäh, the past passive participial suffix being used in the sense of beginning an action (Pan. 3.4.71). By the beginning is here indicated everything up to the final result.1. [Note furnished by Dr. Gary Tubb.] What Abhinava is referring to is the classical system of twenty-two srutis, described by Nijenhuis, p. 10, as “micro-intervals used to describe interval arrangements” and by Capwell, p. 780, as “modally diagnostic microtones.” It is by the srutis, the minimum units of measure of pitch interval, that the basic notes (svara) of a melody type are defined. If any of the notes associated with the melody type is given a new assignment differing in pitch by a single sruti, the type will fall under a different designation. 2. [Dr. Tubb] Jätyamiaka is a term found frequently in BhNÉ (chapters 28-33 in the GOS edition), while the other terms are discussed in Matanga’s Brhaddesi, from which Abhinava most likely took them. Part Three of the Brhaddesi discusses the grämarägas. Bhäsä, vibhäsä, and antarabhäsä (so-called because these melodies were used in dialect songs) are discussed in Part Four. It is of interest to note that the Brhaddesi (p. 105 in Sämbasiva Sâstrï’s edition, near the beginning of Part Four) uses the term pragita exactly as Ànanda and Abhinava have used it: prakäiam na ca laksyate yatnahinais tu gäyakaih / pragitäs tu prasiddhyanti susvaränäm xnsesatah, “[The melody type called 6/iösd] is not manifested clearly by singers who have not practised hard.

Jacobi has taken mahäkaveh as possessive genitive. One will then supply some such word as sahrdayaih with pratyabhijneyau. But the Vrtti by rearranging the word order seems to take mahäkaveh as subjective genitive (Pan. 2.3.71) and Abhinava takes it definitely in that sense.A The suggested meaning and the particular word that has the capability of conveying it, not just any word: this word and meaning should be scrutinized (or recognized) by a great poet. It is by the proper use of the suggested sense and the word that suggests it that a great poet deserves his name, not by mere structuring of the denoting word and the denoting meaning.L Should be scrutinized (or recognized): the gerundive su x is here used in the sense of “should,” 1 for the fact that everyone strives"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"125in this way [viz., for the suggested word and meaning] in itself furnishes proof that they are well known to be more important [than the denota­tive word and sense]. And by the suffix’s use in this mandatory sense he indicates that this [seeking out of the suggestive word and sense] forms part of [a poet’s] education. By using the word pratyabhijneyau he would indicate that although poetry may flash forth (parisphurati) of its own accord in the way described [by Bhämaha 1.5], “Poetry comes to the man of genius, and at that only sometimes;” still, it increases in a thousand ways if that man will keep considering his poem carefully, thinking, “this should be like this,” i.e., “I should say such and such, not such and such.” in this way always seeking the suggestive word and sense.1 2 The matter was put as follows by my teacher’s teacher, the renowned Utpala:As some lover brought by many prayersto-a lady’s side, only to findthat she does not recognize him when he is comeand so all hope of making love to her is gone;just so is God, although he beour very soul, misprised within usand cannot share with us his glory.Therefore I have written this book called “Recognition.\"3One sees from this that pmtyabhijnä (recognition, scrutiny) is a care­ful inspection of and continuous reflection upon an object although that object is already [in some sense] known. This is what is meant by pmtyabhijnä and not the mere recognition that consists in noting that “this is the same thing I saw before.”A g reat poet: One hopes that one also may be a great poet.4By his speaking thus of the importance of the suggestive word and the suggested meaning he has implied an importance also of the relation between the suggestor and the suggested. Thus he has shown that the three [senses of dhvani] will fit: that which suggests, that which is suggested, and the operation of suggesting.51. More literally, ‘in the sense of the worthiness or desert of the subject” Pan. 3.3.169. The suggested word and its meaning deserve to be scrutinized.2.

He then steals to her garden some night only to find that she mistakes him for a stranger and will not come forth or allow him to enter. This simile of God’s lying unrecognized within us suggests to Abbinava another simile. Just as God, if unrecognized within us, cannot impart to us his glory, just so our poetic genius, if we do not recognize or scrutinize it—and he goes on to give a very special sense to this term—cannot produce the great poetry of which it is capable. 4. Thus the study of the suggestive word and its meaning will form part of the education of every poet. 5. These are the first three senses that we listed in 1.1 K, note 1.[ § 1.8 LA Now, although a correct choice of suggested meaning and sug­gestive word is more important, it is right that poets should first turn their attention to the correct choice of denoted meaning and denoted word.L The author anticipates that an inference might be drawn of the greater importance of the denotative word, meaning, and operation from the fact of their being taken up first for consideration. 1 So he shows, with now, etc., that as a reason (or middle term) this [fact of being taken up first] is contradictory to what is here sought to be proved, viz., greater importance, for he takes the view that it is the means that are first taken up, [not the all important goal].1.

See 1.1 Jf, note 1. Dhvani is here used in the fifth of the senses there listed, viz., of a type of poetry. But this sense is not sharply distinguished from the fourth sense, viz., the suggested meaning. The Vrtti on this verse slides very easily from the one sense to the other.A The type of poetry which the wise call dhvani is that in which sense, viz., a particular literal sense, or word, viz., a particular deno­tative word, suggests that meaning.L [Abhinava here comments only on the Kärikä.

And in the vivaksitänyaparaväcya type4 there must be the cooperation of words, because the meaning [which is there predominant] could not be suggested if the denoted sense were not furnished by a word or words. Accordingly, the operation of suggestion always belongs to both word and meaning. So when Bhattanäyaka"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"criticizes the dual here, he is overlooking the obvious facts.® But [we must remember that] in stating the alternative “word or sense” our author means [to include the notion of] predominance.6T he ty p e of poetry: One may analyse the compound (kävyavisesa) as a karmadhâraya or as a genitive tatpurusa.7 By using the word “po­etry” he shows that that soul which has been characterized as dhvani falls in the area of words and meanings embellished by the poetic qual­ities and figures of speech, so that there is no occasion for applying the word dhvani to the “material inference” (arthäpatti) [of the Mlmämsä].8As for what has been said that “then the apprehension of beauty (cârutvapratïti) will be the soul of poetry,” we are quite willing to accept it. The only dispute is about a name (viz., whether to call the soul of poetry cârutvapratïti or dhvani]. But when it is said that “If the soul of poetry is [nothing more than] the apprehension of beauty, the soul of poetry could arise from any means of cognition, such as visual perception and the like,” we reply that the statement is nonsense. The context is an effort to define the soul of poetry, which is an entity consisting of words and meanings. How would there be any occasion [for bringing in visual perception]?[The five m eanings of dhvani.]T h at in which: we may consider the reference to be to the sense, or the word, or to the operation [of word and sense]. And the sense may be either the literal sense, for it suggests (dhvanati), as does the word, or the suggested sense, for it is suggested (dhvanyate), [while] the operation is an alternative [because it is] the suggesting (dhvanana) of word and sense. But the Kärikä would convey by the word dhvani primarily the sum total of these elements in the form of poetry.9 1 21. The pronoun “that” (in “that meaning\") can refer to the suggested meaning because he has already established the existence of such a meaning.2. The reason for Abhinava’s odd analysis of the compound is that if we take it naturally, the element artha is meaningless; upasarjanïkrtasvau would have been sufficient. 3. In that type of dhvani '“where the literal meaning is un-~ intended,” what is important is the word. For example, in gangäyäm ghosah, “a village on the bank of the Ganges,” if we were to substitute the name of another river, the suggestion of holiness, etc., would disappear. 4. Many examples of this type, “where the literal meaning is intended but is subordi­nated to a second meaning,” will be given in what follows. It includes all cases of rasadhvani.

Gajanimüikä:literally, blinking at an elephant. The expression is used in Râj.Tar. 6.73, and frequently in modern Sanskrit (e.g., Abhyankar’s commentary on SDS, pp. 52, 8 6). BP gives an incorrect explanation, confusing the term with gajasnâna.6. By adding this sentence Abhinava justifies the use of the dual inflection. If the author had intended to speak of either word or sense acting as sole agent, he should have used the singular. But his intention was to speak of word and sense cooperating to suggest, with either word being predominant or sense being predominant. His intention therefore required the use of the dual. 7. BP explains the difference of meaning effected by these analyses as follows. In kävyam ca tad visesam cäsau it takes visesa in its normal sense (in + sis +ghan, Pan. 3.3.19), where the suffix gives the root passive sense: it is poetry and it is that which is distinguished [from éâstra, etc.]. One should then translate from the Kärikä: “Poetry as a distinctive type of literature is called dhvani by the wise.” In the tatpumsa analysis BP seems to take visesa as formed with the upapada suffix an (Pàn. 3.2.1), for it takes the verbal root in an active sense. One should then translate: “The distinguisher of poetry (namely, the soul, suggestion) is called dhvani by the wise.\" Neither of these analyses would permit a sentence lacking in dhvani to be called poetry. On the other hand, I prefer to take the compound as tatpumsa but to give visesa its normal sense, as formed by ghan: ‘That type, as distinguished from othertypes, of poetry is called dhvani__” This is because I suppose that Änandawould have considered poetry even not of the best to be still poetry. 8. See1.4 g L, note 21. 9. It may be found useful to memorize BP’s convenientsummary of the five meanings: tathâ ca tathàvidhah êabda-vâcya-vyahgya- vyahjana-samudäyätmakah kâvyaviseso dhvanir iti kathitah. For an English rendering, see 1.1 K, note 1.§ 1.13a A ]A This shows that the habitat of dhvani is different from that of causes of beauty in the denotative sense and word, such as simile and alliteration. 1 _The objection that “there is no such thing as dhvani because what falls outside our well known system would no longer be poetry” (1.1 b A) is injust, for it is only to the makers of definitions [of poetry] that dhvani is not well known.

Whatever differs from it is mere extra (display) , 1 2 as we shall in what follows.1. “Such as simile'' stands for all the figures of meaning; “such as allit­eration” for all the figures of sound. 2. Citra: lit., a bright picture, but in the technical sense, a display of mastery in poetic figures and meters. Citra verses are discussed in 3.41-42.[ § 1.13a AL Is different: dhvani cannot be included in them because the life of poetic qualities and figures lies in the nature of word and literal sense, whereas the essence of dhvani lies in the nature of the suggestor and the suggested, which are different from that. The word h ab itat (visaya) shows that it exists in no other place. In this way the deprecation is silenced that took the form of “What is this thing called dhvani that it should differ from these?” (1.1 a X).T he m akers of definitions: [In inferring the non-existence of dhvani] its being not well known to the makers of definitions is a reason contradictory to what is sought to be proved (viruddho hetuh).1 In fact this is all the more reason for trying to frame a definition. On the other hand, its not being well known in the poetry itself would be a “falsely assigned reason” (asiddho hetuh).2 And the suggestion that it might be something like dancing and singing (cf. 1.1b L) [is nonsense because that] would have nothing to do with poetry.C itra: it is called “display” because its use of meters and other [embellishments] causes admiration, while it lacks the exudation of that nectar of true beauty that is sought by the sensitive audience. Or it may be called citra in that word’s sense of “picture,” as an i itation of poetry, or because it is a mere written design,3 or because it is simply one of the arts.4In w hat follows: ., in Chapter Three [verse 41, which Abhinavahere quotes].1.

Perhaps Abhinava feels that any of the sixty-four arts may be called citra in the sense of bright, interesting, amusing."},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"§ 1.13c A )A The objection is also wrong which said that \"Dhvani cannot be something entirely new because, being something that falls within the area of beauty, it must be included in the types of figures of speech, etc., which have been recorded” (cf. 1.1c A). For how can dhvani, which is found to occur always in dependence on suggestive word and suggested meaning, be included in a system that depends on only the literal word and meaning? Furthermore, the causes of beauty in the literal word and meaning are subordinate to it whereas it is principal to them, as will be shown in what follows. The following couplet will give support (parikara) [to our position]: uAs dhvani depends on the relation of the suggestor and the suggested, how can it be included in the causes of beauty belonging to the denoter and the denoted?”L A supportive couplet is a verse (sloka) intended to supple­ment the Kärikäs in order to fortify (parikara) their argument.A Now an opponent of dhvani may allow that [a figure of speech] where a suggested meaning is not clearly apprehended falls outside the habitat of dhvani. But where it is perceived, as it is in such figures as samäsokti, äksepa, the type of visesokti where the reason is not given, paryäyokta, apahnuti, dipaka, sankara, and the like,1 he will say that dhvani must be included. It is in order to refute such a suggestion that it was specified [by the Kärikä] that “word and sense subordinate themselves.” It is where a sense by subordinating itself, or a word by subordinating its literal sense, reveals another [suggested] meaning, that we have dhvani. That is to say, since dhvani is found only where the suggested meaning is predominant, which it is not in samäsokti and the like, how can it be included in them?"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"136[ § 1.13c A1. For these figures of speech see the Index.L W here: viz., in a figure of speech. C learly: he means both with beauty and clarity. Specified: The Vrtti uses the past tense because it has already dealt with the word “suggest” [in 1.13 b] . 1 Sub­ordinating itself: the Vrtti explains the sense of ava (“own”) of the Kärikä by ätman (“itself\"). W hich it is not: this predominance of the suggested sense is not. That is to say, its predominance does not appear as we are understanding the verse, because we spend our enjoy­ment in an unbroken relishing [of both literal and suggested meanings] on the principle of [what was said in 1.12 K]: “in the minds of those in whom the real [meaning] appears.” 1 2 But [in a second stage], when a man of discri ination seeks the enlivening element, since it is the suggested meaning that gives life to the literal, he will decide that he is presented with a figure of speech, because the suggested is helping out that [literal sense]. And so he will say that he received his delight from the literal meaning as helped out by that [suggestion]. Although in a final [third] stage, there is indeed rasadhvani, nevertheless this suggested meaning in the second stage does not point to rasa; for its own part it simply hastens to ornament the literal meaning. And so the Vrtti speaks of the suggested meaning as being subordinated.31. The usual word for the Vrtti to use in such references is äha, which the Pämnians take to be a present tense (Pàn. 3.4.84). Abhinava feels that he must give a reason why abhihitam, a past tense, is here substituted. His reason is that the Vrttikära has already explained the word vyanktah, which occurs in the second half of the Kärikä. He now turns back to explain upasarjant- krtasvärthau, which occurred in the first half of the verse. So in referring back to it he uses a past tense. 2. Abhinava is quoting from memory. TheKärikä actually used the word tattvärthadarsinyäm, not tattvävabhäsinyäm.3. The complication of Abhinava’s thought in this passage is caused, it seems to me, by the fact that he is trying to reconcile matters that are irreconcilable. There is no doubt that the figure samäsokti involves suggestion, as the exam­ple about to be quoted in 1.13 d A will show. The old poeticians were aware of this fact and defined this sort of suggestion within their system of figures of speech. Änanda, seeking to make suggestion into a wholly new semantic cate­gory but unwilling to defy the definitions of the past, abandoned the group of suggestions that had already been categorized by the older writers under the figures of speech and tried to find an area where suggestion could form its own independent species. To do this he invented the distinction between predomi­nant and subordinate suggestion. Where it was predominant it could form its"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"137own species. All the cases of suggestion contained in the old, defined, figures of speech could be left out as instances of subordinate suggestion. See Intro­duction. pp. 22-24. There would still be room for an important new species: predominant suggestion. The only trouble with the innovation is that many of the old type, many instances of samäsokti, äksepa, etc., move us as deeply, both emotionally and aesthetically, as any new examples which he can adduce. How can one explain this fact, if true dhvani exists only where it is predomi­nant? So Abhinava, like Ptolomy inventing new pericycles to rectify a system that is basically wrong, invents still another distinction: the three stages in our response to these long-recognized instances of dhvani. In the first stage we respond automatically without distinguishing what is predominant and what is subordinate. In the second stage we realize upon reflection that the suggestion is helping out a defined figure of speech. Finally in a third stage we relish the rasadhvani despite our intellectual decision that it does not belong in the same category as that which is produced by a predominant suggestion.§ 1.13d A ]A Let us begin with the figure samäsokti (compound statement):The reddening moon has so seized the face of nightwith her trembling stars,that all her cloak of darkness in the eastfalls thus unnoticed by her in confusion.* 1In this, as in similar verses, the literal meaning, although it is accom­panied by a suggestion, is apprehended as the more important, for the main purport of the sentence concerns the moon and the night,2 on which have been superinposed the behaviors of a lover and his lady.1. In päda d I have taken the reading of the oldest version, mohäd, in place of rägäd, which avoids the awkward repetition of rapo. The words of the stanza have double meanings, which are immediately brought to our attention by the obvious pun in räga: redness, or love, and by the masculine gender of the word for moon in contrast with the feminine gender of the word for night. Proceeding from these hints, the mind soon finds a suggested meaning for"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"138each word (see Abhinava’s comment below). The suggested meanings, when combined, furnish a sense as follows: “The lover, with aroused passion, kisses the face of his beloved, whose eyes {tärakä = ‘pupil’ as well as ‘star’) tremble, so that she drops her robe entirely before him (purah = ‘in front of’ as well as ‘in the east’) without noticing what she has done in her confusion.” The tradi­tional interpretation of such verses insists on keeping the two versions distinct, allowing one message to suggest the other, but refusing to mix the images. Masson writes: “When I attempted to mix the two, speaking of the moon kissing the face of the night, which is after all rather poetic, Pandit Srinivasa Shastri of the Deccan College looked astonished: uKatham s Ï cetanavastu- van nis'äm cumben nanu? Tathä nästi, saruathä asambhavam.\" The verse is quoted in most of the anthologies, usually without variant, and invariably at­tributed to the poet Panini, for whom see Peterson, JRAS 1891, pp. 313-316. Thus it is in Éârrig. 3634, SüktiM. 72.5, Sadukti. 412 (where we find the bet­ter reading mohäd in d). The first word and last quarter of of the stanza are preserved among the fragments edited by G noli of Udbhata’s Commentary on the Kävyälankära of Bhämaha, fragment 37, pp. 34-35, where the reading of d appears as puro ’pi mohäd galitam na raksitam. The word mohäd has been changed in the later versions, presumably because of the difficulty of finding a pun in it. 2. It is context which tells us which of the two possible meanings is the main purport (väkyärtha). Even without other verses which may once have accompanied it, we may be sure that the context of the present stanza is a description of moonrise, that being one of the favorite topoi of Sanskrit poetry. The lover and his beloved are a secondary suggestion.[ § 1.13d AL Sam äsokti:Where in a statement a second meaning is understood because of epithets common [to both meanings]: the wise call that samäsokti, because the mean­ing is composite. (Bhämaha 2.79)In the four quarters of this verse the author has given successively the basic characterization of samäsokti, the reason for it, its name, and the explanation of the name.R eddening (literally, possessing redness): [in the case of the moon this means] assuming the red color of twilight; and [in the case of a lover it means] assuming the feelings of love.

T he face of night: the beginning [of the night] and the lotus"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"139face [of the woman). Thus: suddenly (of the night] and with a rush of love [of the woman). Cloak of darkness: Of the night timirämsukam means timiram (darkness) and süksmämsavah (feeble rays) , 1 i.e., her mass of darkness spangled with a few rays [of the stars); of the beloved timirämsuka means the dark veil appropriate to a newly wed bride who is shy.2 [In place of mohäd (in confusion) Abhinava reads rägäd, which he explains as follows:) Rägäd (in the case of the night] means “from redness,” that is, immediately following the redness produced by twilight;3 and [in the case of the woman) it means “from love,” that is, because of love. In th e east (in connection with night) and [in connection with the woman] in front of her. Fallen: vanished in the one case and fallen in the other. By her: by the night as instrument (Pan. 2.3.18) the mass of darkness is spangled [with starlight], or we may take the pronoun to be an instrumental of identification (Pan. 2.3.21).\"* U nnoticed: it was not realized that this was the beginning of night, for people recognize the face, or beginning, of night when they see a mass of darkness spangled with starlight, but not when a clear light [as of the moon] is present. In the case of the woman, on the other hand, “by her” will be an instrumental of agent (“unnoticed by her”). In the case of the night the word api [in puro ’pi = even in front of her] must be transposed to follow upalaksitam [i.e., “was not even noticed by people”). And here (in the case of the woman] the veil falls, or drops, in front, as the lover coming from behind begins to kiss her. Or, we may take the syntax to be that the lover [standing] in front seizes her face.So although we understand a suggested sense in this stanza, it is not predominant. That is to say, the [superimposed] behavior of lover and beloved in ornamenting the moon and night, which thus take the form of vibhävas of the erotic flavor, acts as an ornament or figure of speech. But then from the literal sense (of moon and night] which has been turned into a vibhäva, there issues forth a steam of rasa.Here someone has said, “The word ‘by her,’ viz., by the night, ex­presses agency, and since agency is impossible on the part of an insen­tient being, the behavior of lovers which we infer is given by the deno­tative force of ‘night’ and ‘moon’ and not by a suggestion. That is why the stanza forms a compouind utterance (samäsokti).~s This explicator has ignored the clear sense of the text with which we are concerned, [for the Vrtti has clearly said] “accompanied by a suggestion.” 6 At that rate the figure would be ekadeéavivarti rüpakam (a partial metaphor) like the couplet:§ 1.13d L ]"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"The pond kings were fanned by autumn with her wild geese.(Udbhata, l.*12 Induräja = 1.24 Vivrti)7It would not be a samäsokti because it would not contain epithets that apply [in each instance] equally to both [the denoted and the suggested sense]. Furthermore, the denotative function is ruled out [in Bhämaha’s definition of samäsokti just quoted] by the phrase “is understood” [rather than “is stated”]. But let us not run on at too great length on a subordinate matter.[Here it might be thought that Änanda should have written samä- ropitanäyaka-vyavahärayoh rather than samäropitanäyikä-näyakayoh.,8 However,] there is no need for an- ekasesa compound [viz., näyakayor] if we explain the meaning to be that the behavior of a lady toward her lover is superimposed on night and the behavior of a lover toward his lady is superimposed on the moon.1. He is taking the compound as a dvandva rather than as a karma- dhäraya. In amiaka he is taking the suffix as the diminutive -ka (Pan. 5.3.85) appended to the stem amiti-, “ray.” 2. Abhinava's interpretation of the second meaning of timiràmsukam seems to me as faulty as his explanation of the first. In his interpretation the word “all” (samasta) will have no force. Nor does the falling of a mere veil indicate much passion (riga). What is in fact suggested is the falling of her entire garment. It is a commonplace of Classical Sanskrit poetry that the knot of the beloved’s garment opens of itself and her dress falls as her lover embraces her; see Meghadüta 73, KumSam. 8.4, Óisupdla 10.45 and 50, Kirâta 9.47-48. 3. Abbinava takesthe ablative inflection of räga as denoting cause only in the suggested meaning, which concerns the woman. To explain the ablative in the first meaning concerning night, he supplies the word anantaram, \"immediately after.” This word governs an ablative on the analogy of Pan. 2.3.29. 4. This is the usagefound in such phrases as apt bhavän kamandalunä chätram adräksit, “Did you see the pupil with a water pitcher?” where “with a water pitcher” serves to identify the pupil who is intended. Here the mass of darkness spangled with stars that was “with the night,” i.e., that characterized or identified the night, was not noticed. Both interpretations are wildly improbable. Tayä must be taken as instrumental of agent with laksitam in the case of the night as well as in the case of the woman. If it is objected that an insentient thing like night cannot “notice\" anything (this difficulty doubtless led Abhinava to his interpretation), one may have recourse to the older reading raksitam."},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"1415. The anonymous opponent holds that words have only one operation, abhi- dhd (denotation). When context forbids our taking the usual meaning of the word, we choose a second meaning. But the opponent refuses to call this second meaning laksita, any more than he will call it vyangya. As night cannot be supposed to “notice” anything, we are forced to take “night” to mean a woman, whereupon we shall take “moon” to mean a lover. These meanings are denotative, just as night and moon are denotative. It is because of the double denotations in the verse that the figure is called samäsokti. 6. This is a sure refutation if the explicator was commenting on the Dhvanyäloka. But if he was attacking it, the statement of the Vrtti would carry no weight.7. Chowne-bearers fan kings and one can express ponds metaphorically as kings, but autumn does not perform the function of such intelligent beings as fan-bearers. The example is quoted again at 3.36 L. 8. If we take Änanda’s compound, as I have done, to mean “on which has been superimposed the behaviors of a lover and his lady,\" we make Änanda guilty of disregarding Pän. 1.2.67, which states that in such cases the feminine component of the pair is dropped and the masculine component, as an ekasesa compound, suffices for both. Abhinava exonerates Änanda by giving the compound a meaning other than “the behaviors of a lover and his lady.\"§ 1.13e A ]A In äksepa (a hint, often in the form of a denial) also, while it hints at a particular suggestion, the literal sense is charming. The literal sense1 is known to be predominant from the very fact that (the figure] is called äksepa. Thus, it is the hint itself, in the form of a denial explicitly stated with a view to expressing some particular,2 that forms the principal body of the poem, even though it hints at some particular suggestion. This is because the decision whether literal or suggested meaning is the more important depends on which is the more charming. An example is this couplet:The sunset is flushed with red, the day goes ever before,Ah, such is the way of fate that never the two shall meet.3Although we apprehend a suggestion in this verse, it is this [literal sense] that holds the greater charm. So [we should take it that] the literal is intended to be predominant."},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"1421. There is a problem of reading here. The Kaumudi, and presumably all but the two KM MSS which it mentions as being in disagreement, reads v&- cyàrtha for väkyärtha. The KM edition, however, chose the reading väkyärtha from those two MSS and has been followed by all the printed editions. If one accepts that reading, one must understand the word as a locative and take the whole passage from äksepe ’pi to jhäyate as a single sentence: “In äksepa also, while it hints at a particular suggestion, the fact that the beauty of the literal sense is predominant is obvious from the force of the expression of the hint in the final or sentence meaning.” This is awkward, to say the least. I prefer to read väcyärtha, which I take as a nominative, and to put a dando. after cärutvam. The sense, as I have given it in the translation, is then clear and to the point. 2. In the phrase visesäbhidhänecchatä one must not take abhidhäna too narrowly. BP glosses the word by vyahgyabhütavisesaprati- pädayisayä. 3. What is hinted at in this anonymous stanza is a pair of lovers who are prevented, by their parents or by social differences or by rea­sons of state, from ever uniting. Clearly Änanda considered this couplet to be an example of äksepa. Other Älankärikas who quote the verse consider it to exemplify samâsokti or visesokti or saiikara; see KP 9.382 (p. 526), SD 10.99 (Sanskrit p. 63 Kane), and the Locana in what follows. To explain this differ­ence of judgment some historical remarks will be helpful. The word äksepa is post-epic. Whether its earliest meaning was \"hint” or “denial” or “censure” I cannot say, for it bears all these senses in the later literature. As a technical name of a figure of speech it is defined by all the Älankärikas starting from Bhämaha and Dandin. Usually it is defined as a denial (pratisedha, nisedha) which hints at something unexpressed. The denial may be of a fact or of a word that has been spoken, or it may be mere reticence, the refusal to say something that would be painful. For examples, see Abhinava’s comment be­low and 2.27 c A with note 2. Vämana, however, has a definition of äksepa that differs from that of all other authors. The meaning of his laconic defini­tion: upamänäksepas cäksepah is shown by his examples to be “Äksepa is the censure of. or hint of, a simile.” His examples will be found quoted by Ab- hinava in his comment on this passage. It is the second half of the definition (hint of a simile) that Änanda must have in mind here. Neither Vämana nor Änanda tells us how to distinguish this second type of äksepa from samâsokti, so we are left to speculate. Presumably samâsokti was allowed to be the more general figure, äksepa preempting to itself only those instances where the hint was specifically of a simile (upamäna).L In äksepa: [The figure has been defined thus:]The denial (or holding back) of an intended [statement] out of a wish to convey some special [suggestion] is äksepa (denial, hint, censure), which is of two types depending on whether the statement was about to be spoken or has been made. (The first half of this verse is Bhämaha 2.68) 1[ § 1.13e A"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"§ 1.13e L ]An example of the first type is this:If in my longingI should lose sight of you but for a moment But I say no more.Why say that which would pain you?(Bhämaha 2.69)Here we have äksepa in the form of withholding the death that the lady was about to speak of. The words “But I say no more,\" while they sug­gest the statement “I will die,” are themselves the cause of the beauty in the verse. So [we must say that] the äksepa (the hinting reticence) as embellished by what it hints at is the predominant element. An example of [the second type, where] a statement that has been made (is denied or censured] is a verse of mine:“My dear traveler, what causes this sudden collapse?”“What else can I do who have such thirst, when the miserly road here hides its water?\"“Your thirst is mistimed, good sir, and misplaced.Vent your anger on it. The glory and greatness of the desert road are famous throughout the world.” 2In this verse a servitor is present. His heart is torn by desire and he asks why he receives nothing from his lord. Some one puts him to a right way of thinking by this censure. Here it is the literal meaning, expressing distress at the lack of recompense from service with a bad master, being transformed by a censure in the form of a denial into the vibhäva indifference (nirueda) which is the basic emotion of the flavor of peace (säntarasa), which gives beauty to the stanza.Vämana, in different fashion, defines äksepa as censure of the simile. It amounts to saying, “When this is present, of what account are you?” He gives an example:When we have the fair clarity of her face, who would care for the full-orbed moon; or who would care for water-lily flowers before the vast beauty of her eyes?What price would you pay for the tender, lovely opening of a leaf, when you see her lower lip?Ah me! but God shows a stubborn zeal for tautological creation.(Vämana 4.3.27.1)"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"144In this stanza the simile, although it is suggested, merely serves the literal sense. The expressed censure, in its casting away [of the simile] with a “who would care for it?” is the source of all the charm.Or again, äksepa [here simply hint, not censure] of the simile may be brought in by the inherent capability [of the literal sense], as in this example:[ § 1.13e LLady Autumn beautifies the moonalthough his face is made imperfect by its mark,and bearing on her cloud a rainbowlike a wound left by a lover’s nail,has made the sun grow hot.(Vämana, ibid. vs. 2) 3In this stanza, although a simile is hinted at, namely a lover who is pained by jealousy, it serves only to beautify the literal meaning.But the stanza [which Änanda] here [quotes, viz., ’T he sunset is flushed with red,\" etc.] is really an instance of samäsokti [if one follows the normal definition, as of Bhâmahaj.So he says: “[depends on] which is the more charming,” and apropos of this quotes a well-known example: T he sunset is flushed w ith red. Note that he has not yet finished his consideration of äksepa and that it is as an example of äksepa that he quotes this samäsokti couplet.Ah, b u t such is th e way of fate: The [suggested] sense is that there is no union [of the lovers] because of some such obstacle as their subjection to their parents. This: i.e., the literal sense.Realizing that the figure of speech here is äksepa according to Va- mana’s definition and samäsokti according to Bhämaha’s, our author by joining the two figures has given this single example. Let it be an example of samäsokti or of äksepa, what does it matter to us? All that we are trying to demonstrate is that in figures of speech the suggested sense is always subordinate to the literal. This is how my teacher [Bhattatauta] explained the intention of the present passage. 11. This is the definition that most later authors have followed. It is unfortunate that several of the best Indian scholars have adopted the term “paraleipsis” as a translation, for that is quite a different figure both in form and intent. An example from the Rhetorica ad Herennium is: “I would speak of your vices, had I time. But I pass over them and over the fact that you often left the army without leave” (4.27). Here one neither denies a statement made nor suppresses a statement about to be made. Rather, one passes over a fact (this is the literal meaning of paraieipsis) lightly in order by minimizing"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"145it to increase the effect of one’s major charge. If one wants a Greek or Latin translation for Bhämaha’s first type of äksepa, the Greek would be oposiopesis, which the author of the Rhetorica ad Herennium calls praecisio (ad Her. 4.30) and Cicero calls reticentia (de Or. 3.538). 2. What the verse suggests is aconversation between courtiers in which the first complains that his service is not rewarded and the second censures his complaint. Accordingly, most Älankärikas would take the figure of speech here to be aprastutaprasämsä. But Abhinava is thinkng of Bhämaha’s second type of äksepa and he is influenced by the sense of censure that Vämana, whom he is about to quote, attributes to the name. We have here clearly a censure of what has been said. In general, when we can assign a figure of speech to either of two defined types, we should assign it to the narrower type; see 1.13e A, note 3, end. There is room for aprastutaprasämsä where an allegory suggests the matter in hand without a censure of what has been said. One may add that to a tenth-century Kashmiri the desert road was still famous as a road to wealth; compare the expeditions across the northern desert of King Lalitäditya recorded in Räj. Tar. 4.172, 277 ff., and 337 ff. 3. The literal meaning describes the phenomena of autumn, when the moon appears at its loveliest (our “harvest moon”) despite the dark birthmark (kalaiika, our “man in the moon”) on his face. In an Indian a u tu m n , which comes directly after the cooling season of the monsoon, the sun again grows hot. Several of the words of the stanza are puns. Prasädayanti: making beautiful or granting favors to; payodhara: cloud or breast; tapah: heat or pain. Hence the suggestion of a courtesan favoring a lover of bad character and so making her noble lover jealous.§ 1.13 f L]A And as in dïpaka, apahnuti,l 1 and the like, although we appre­hend a simile as something suggested, we do not call these figures of speech by that name because the simile is not intended to be prominent, so the same applies here [viz., we do not call a figure of speech by the name of dhvani because the dhvani is not intended to be prominent].1. These figures of speech are defined below in L and the notes thereon.L Having thus provided an example of where [the literal] is in­tended to be predominant, he now gives an example, acceptable both to"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"146his followers and his opponents, of how the name [of a figure of speech] derives from its predominant element: and as in, etc. [A lthough we apprehend] a simile: he means that we apprehend a relation of subject and image. By th a t nam e: viz., \"simile.\" For example, in dipaka—of which the definition runs thus: “Dipaka is held to be three­fold, as it falls at the beginning, middle or end” 1 (Bhämaha 2.25)—the beauty of the verse is occasioned by the operation of the dipaka, [not by the suggested simile,] as in this example:A jewel placed against the whetstone, a victorious warrior wounded by the sword, the moon when left with its last digit a young woman thin from exercise of sex, an elephant in rut, a riverdrawn back from its lovely sandbanks in the autumn, and the rich who spend their wealth by giving to the poor: all these by lessening grow resplendent.(Bhartrhari, Nitis. 11)Apahnuti has been defined: \"The denial of what one really accepts, if it contains to some extent a simile, is apahnuti” (Bhämaha 3.21).2 In this figure it is the denial itself that is charming, as in:This is not the buzzing of a bee, busy in her drunken joy; it is the twanging of the string as Cupid pulls his bow.(Bhämaha 3.22) 31. Bhämaha's “definition” is in effect no definition at all. It merely di­vides the figure into three types. Dipaka, “the lamp,” is so called because a single verb or property serves to illuminate more than one object. Among early authors dipaka is the same as the Graeco-Latin zeugma. Mahäbhä- rata 2.52.21: Dhrtarästrena cähütah kälasya samayena ca, “challenged by Dhrtarästra and by the doom of fate.” Ovid, Met. 7.133: demisere .metu vultumque animumque Pelasgi, “the Greeks lowered their faces and spirits in fear/’ From the time of Udbhata the definition was further particularized. Udbhata (1.14 Induräja = 1.28 Vivrti) distinguished dipaka from tulyayogitä (originally quite a different figure, which had come to encroach on dipaka) by claiming that in dipaka the common verb or property must join the matter-in­hand (pradhäna, präkaranika, prastuta) with some extraneous matter (gauna, aprikaranika. aprastuta), whereas in tulyayogitä the combined items are all within the subject of discourse or all outside it. Thus, an example like the fol­lowing, which BhNS 16.55 gives of dipaka, becomes an instance of tulyayogitä[ § 1.13 f L"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"accordi to the new view: sarämsi hamsaih kusumais ca vrksaih ... tasmin na sünyäni sadä kriyante, “In autumn lakes are ever filled with geese, the trees with flowers, etc.” for all the objects joined by the verb are within the subject of discourse, autumn. Later authors usually follow Udbhata's distinc­tion. 2. The printed versions of Bhämaha all have the reading apahnutir abhîstâ ca. If we take Abhinava’s reading, we must use the technique of dvrtti, that is, we must read apahnutir twice. One might best render apahnuti in English as “feigned denial.” Its definition remains essentially the same in all Älankärikas except Dandin, whose view does not here concern us. 3. Note that there is an appropriateness to the simile based on sound. The bee is a sign of spring, when Cupid annually renews his archery.§ 1.13g A )A Also in that type of visesokti (here = cause without effect) where the reason is not expressed, as in such verses asAlthough his friends have waked him, although he answers, “yes,” although his mind tells him to go, the traveler does not uncurl his limbs.(Bharscu) 1we merely apprehend the suggestion from force of the context, but there arises no particular beauty from the apprehension; so the suggestion is not predominant.1. The verse is by a once famous poet, whose odd name Bharscu appears also as Bharvu, Bhascu, Bhatsu. A handful of his verses are preserved by the anthologists. What little is known of him may be found in V. Raghavan’s Bhoja’s ÉP, sec. ed., pp. 817-818. Bharscu served the Maukhari kings of Kanyâkubja, was Bäna’s teacher (see Kädamban, Introductory verse 4), and accordingly belongs to the early seventh century. The verse here quoted is found in the anthologies (Éàrhg. 3932, Sûkti.M. 63.23, Subh.Ä. 1838) under descriptions of winter, which shows that they followed the interpretation which Abhinava (see below) ascribes to Ubdhata, viz., that the unexpressed reason for the result not to occur is the fact that the traveler was cold. Abhinava’s Locana is the earli t of our preserved texts to mention a more romantic interpretation."},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"[§ 1.13g LL After considering äksepa in the above manner, he now speaks of the subject that immediately followed it in the order of his initial statement:1 and in th a t ty p e of viéeaokti. [The figure in general is thus defined:] “The praise of one quality in the absence of others, if made in order to reveal some excellence, is traditionally known as visesokti' (Bhämaha 3.23).2 An example is the following:Alone the god of the flowered bow conquers all three worlds, whose body Siva destroyed but left him still his strength.(Bhämaha 3.24)As the reason in this case [viz., the reason why incineration should not lead to impotence] is inconceivable, there is no suggestion [of a reason]. Even where the reason is explicitly stated, since the statement amounts to no more than giving the nature of the object, there is no question of a suggested sense. For example:I give my praise to himwho like camphor grows stronger with burning, against whom no man prevails, the god of the flowered bow.(Bälarämäyana 3.I l)3Accordingly, our author passes over these two varieties and examines only a third type [as a possible case of a predominant suggested sense]: w hen th e reason is not expressed.[We m erely apprehend] th e suggestion: viz., according to Bhat- todbhata,4 the discomfort caused by the cold, this being the reason [for the traveler’s remaining curled up in his bedding]. Comformably with this interpretation, our author says, th ere arises no particular beau ty here. Some men of taste have imagined a different reason here, namely that the traveler does not uncurl his limbs because he wishes to bring back sleep, thinking that a dream would be a quicker means of union with his beloved than setting forth [on his farther journey]. But the experts in figures of speech have not taken even that reason as a source of beauty here, but have taken the source of beauty to be the words “does not uncurl his limbs,” which form part of the visesokti itself, as embellished by the suggested reason. Otherwise this would not be an example of visesokti at all.5 So our author here accommodates"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"149both views by speaking generally [i.e., by not mentioning the precise nature of the suggested reason). It should not be thought that the text is based exclusively on the view of Udbhata.1. In the initial list (1.13c 4) anuktanimittâ viéesokti followed directly on äksepa. The subject of apahnuti and dipaka has intervened merely for the sake of an example. Änanda will come back to them again later in their proper sequence (1.13h A). 2. The name viéesokti (statement of the excellence)finds its explanation in the old concept of the figure as seen here and in Dandin, where a viéesokti was a statement of deficiency in certain respects, made in order to give special prominence or praise to an excellence or efficiency in some other respect. Thus, Dandin’s example (2.328): “He has a one­wheeled car, a crippled driver, an odd number of horses, and yet the sun in his glory travels the whole sky.” But Udbhata (5.4 Induräja = 5.5 Vivrti.) changed the definition to “A statement that the result fails to arise when all the causal factors are present, if made from a desire to point out a [particular] excellence.” He further divided the figure into two types, one where a reason is expressed for the failure of the result to occur, the other where it is not expressed. Later writers all follow Udbhata. In Bhämaha’s definition, here quoted, samstuti has its natural meaning “praise,” not the watered-down meaning of “mention” by which it is glossed by commentators seeking to broaden the definition. 3. The reason why Kama remains strong despite his incineration is here stated: because he grew stronger with being burned, as does camphor. We remain with a literal description of Kama’s nature. Liquified camphor gains not only in scent but in refrigerating power, a fact that is again used as a simile in Naisadhtya 7.25. 4. Presumably Udbhataquoted the verse in his commentary on Bhämaha. It is not found in his Kävyä- lankâTosùtrasangraha. 5. Obviously, if the suggestion were the chief cause of beauty, we should cease to have a figure of speech; we should have dhvani i tead.§ 1.13h A ]A In paryäyokta (statement of periphrasis),1 if the suggestion is predominant we may well include it in dhvani. But by no means may we include dhvani in it, for as we shall demonstrate, dhvani is of much wider range and is always the predominant element. Furthermore, in examples such as that adduced by Bhämaha, the suggestion is not"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"150predominant, because there is no intention there of subordinating2 the literal sense. In apahnuti and dipaka, on the other hand, the literal is [always] predominant and the suggested [simile] merely follows along with it, as is well known.1. See note 1 on the Locana on this passage. 2. Read upasarjanï- bhâvena.[ § 1.13h AL In paryäyokta: It has been defined thus: “Paryäyokta is when something is said in a different manner, namely through an under­standing that lacks the operation of denoter and denoted” (Udbhata,4.6 Induräja = 4.11 Vivrti).1 An example is this:The sage Rama, who had strayed iin his rage to cut down his foes,was instructed in the path of duty by this bow.In this stanza, although we understand [the suggestion] that the might of Bhïsma overcame the might of Parasu Rama, it is merely as helped out by this suggestion that the literally used phrase “was instructed in the path of duty” ornaments the final meaning of the verse.When what is said is distinguished by a paryäya (periphrasis), that is, speaking in a different manner, which consists in a giving to understand, [that is, when it is distinguished] by a suggestion, then the literally used words themselves form a paryäyokta (statement of periphrasis). Here “when something is said” forms the definition, “statement of periphra­sis” is the thing to be defined, and the general characteristic of this thing is as a figure of speech based on meaning (arthälankära). And so everything is here in order. On the other hand, if one forces on the phrase “when something is said” the unnatural interpretation that it means “when something is apprehended as the chief element,” and if one offers as am example such verses as “Go your rounds freely, pious monk” (cf. 1.4 b A), then the statement of periphrasis will cease to be a figure of speech at all, for it will end up as the soul [of poetry, namely dhvani]. In that case it should not be included in figures of speech. Furthermore, in that case we should have to list subvarieties of it [just as injunction, prohibition, etc., were listed as subvarities in1.4 b, c, d, e A]. Our author says this in the words if th e suggestion is predom inant. That is, by including it in dhvani, paryäyokta would be the soul of poetry, not one of the alaiikäras (ornaments, figures of speech). In it: dhvani cannot be included in that sort of statement"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"151which is intended as a figure of speech. We have not defined dhvani as something (subordinate) of that sort. For dhvani has a wide range. As it exists in all [sorts of statements], it is widely spread (vyäpaka), being the principal element on which all the [ÿunos and alankdras] are placed. A figure of speech is not widely spread any more than any other ornament, [e.g., a bracelet is worn only on the wrist, an anklet on the ankle). And it is not the principal, as it is subordinate to the object which it ornaments. Or, if you assume that the suggestion here is both of widely spread type and principal, and that there is no figure of speech here, why then you would be accepting our own position but out of mere spite continuing to call it a parydyokta.Our author now shows that even this much [viz., that the suggestion can sometimes be predominant] was not understood by the ancients but was first revealed by himself: furtherm ore. Bhämaha furnished his illustration of parydyokta in accordance with the nature he conceived the figure to have. Now in his illustration the suggested element is not predominant because it is not the source of any special beauty. Accordingly, we may agree that in such other illustrations as may be composed along the same lines, there is likewise no predominance of the suggested sense. If you disregard the illustration just given and give as an illustration some such verse as “Go your rounds freely, gentle monk,” you will have become our author’s pupil [for you will be talking about dhvani]. But one must say that you have behaved in an unmannerly fashion by éducating yourself in his doctrine with disregard of the rules and by an illicit hearing of it. The experts in sacred history say:He who shows no respect to the teacher but listens in hiding to his teaching goes straight to hell.2The illustration which Bhämaha gives is this:Neither at home nor when abroad do we eat food that is not eaten by learned brahmins.(Bhämaha 3.9)3This statement of the blessed Krishna by a periphrasis averts his being given poison. As Bhämaha says himself, “This is to avoid his being given poison.” Now there is nothing charming in this suggestion of the averting of poison by which we might suppose it to be predominant. Rather, the statement of periphrasis itself, viz., that he does not eat without the prior eating of brahmins, as embellished by this suggestion,§ 1.13 h L ]"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"152ornaments the matter under discussion, namely his eating of food. The intention of the statement is not to say “Give me unpoisoned food.” And so paryâyokta is simply a figure of speech according to the opinion of the ancients. This is what it all comes down to.In apahnuti and dtpaka: These are figures which he has already discussed; so he says, as is well known. He means the matter has already been proved with valid means of proof. Previously he brought up these figures to serve as illustration of how4 a figure does not take its name from the [subordinate] simile, etc., [which it might contain,] whereas now he mentions them in a different way to show that they are not dhvani because their suggestions are not prominent. This men­tioning of them a second time is to keep the order of his original list5 so that he may make his text all of one piece.6 But the matter on both occasions is basically the same, for one might suspect them of being dhvani from the fact that they suggest a simile.As for the statement of the author of the Vivarana,7 based on an examination of many instances, that a [suggestion of] simile does not always accompany a dtpaka, it is unhelpful, without merit, and can easily be refuted. In the stanza:Infatuation creates desire; and that, love with its loss of pride; that, a yearning to gain the beloved; and that, unbearable pain of heart.(Bhämaha 2.27)8one can easily imagine a relation of subject and simile between the terms even though the terms are produced successively. One cannot say that such a relation of similarity is impossible among successive objects, for we have the verse:Daiaratha was like Rama,Raghu like Dasaratha and Aja like Raghu and the whole race of DiGpa like Aja: marvellous is the glory of Rama,9where one cannot say that it does not exist. So why worry whether sequentiality or contemporaneity hinders the [suggestion of] simile? Enough of trying to milk a mule. 11. In defining paryâyokta Bhämaha merely says: “Paryâyokta is when something is said in a different way.\" (paryâyoktam yad anyena prakârtnâbhi- dhiyate, 3.8.) Udbhata here repeats the words of Bhämaha but adds a second[ § 1.13h L"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"153half verse, which for the first time introduces into the figure the notion of sug­gestion. His definition is followed by Mammata (10.175, p. 680) and Ruyyaka (p. 141). Only late in the history of alankâraéâstra does the restriction appear by which most present-day students recognize the figure. “In a different way\" is then taken to mean “by stating the result.\" So SD 10.61. Thus paryäyokta in the modern view is the sugestion of a cause by stating the result. 2. The quotation is presumably from some Puräna. It is not found in MBh. or Räm. One is supposed, of course, to bow down and touch the teacher’s feet before hearing his words; and the punishments of südras who overhear Vedic teaching are famous. But the quotation is here intended humorously. 3. The English reader may need more explanation than Abhinava furnishes. The words are supposed to be spoken by Krishna on his visit to Óisupàla, where he stands in danger of assassination. Without the hint of that possibility the words, taken literally, express the highly pious protocol that Krishna might be expected to follow. Out of respect he always has his priests fed before himself. The expression is enlivened, is given a twist of wïy humor, by the suggestion, but it is the expression itself that delights us. 4. amuyä cchäyayä: the same as amunâ prakârena. “of this sort, [namely, that a figure, etc.].” 5.

The term has an interesting development in later writers, where padasayyä, like päka, comes to mean the perfect choice of words; see Pratäparudrxya 2.34 (p. 49) and Tarala on Ekävalrl.13 (p. 22). 7. Kane (HSP p. 126) supposed that this was a ref­erence to Udbhata as the author of the Bhämahavivarana, a work specifically referred to by Abhinava at 3.16 m L. But Kane was forced to rely on the incor­rect text of the KM edition, where the negative is omitted from upamänvayo nâstxti. The supposition seems to me impossible. In Udbhata’s Kävyälan- kârasaiïgraha there is no mention of such a theory as is here attributed to the Vivaranakrt. In fact he there defines dîpaka as containing a simile (1.14 Induräja = 1.28 Vivrti). Furthermore, I cannot imagine Abhinava referring to Udbhata as a mule (see end of section) even if he disagreed with him.8. The verse is given by Bhämaha as an example of ädidxpaka, as the common verb (“creates\") is given in the first quarter. It is really a sorites (kâranamâlâ) sharing the pecularity of dîpaka that the common verb is bracketed after its first occurrence. Presumably in order to make it more clearly illustrate dx- paka, the Jayamangala commentary on Bhattikâvya 10.22 alters it drastically: mado janayati pritim änandam mänabhanguram / yat prxyäsangamotkanthäm asahyäm mänasah sucam. 9.

Where either of two figures is possible, there is equal prominence of the literal and the suggested. But if the suggested figure subordinates to itself the literal figure, then we may assign it to the area of dhvani. We cannot say, however, that dhvani is just that, because of the same reasons that we gave in speaking of paryäyokta (cf. 1.13 h A). Further­more, in all cases1 of sankara the very name “saiikara” will prevent us from thinking of dhvani.21. We have followed Abhinava’s interpretation of api ca sarikarälankäre 'pi ca kvadt... niräkaroti to mean saiikarälaiikäre ca kvacid api... nirâkaroti. The natural meaning of Änanda’s sentence would be, 'And sometimes in saiikara the very name ‘saiikara’ will prevent us from thinking of dhvani.” But the natural interpretation gives a less logical train of thought. 2. The name “saiikara” denotes a figure of speech. A figure of speech cannot be an instance of dhvani.L In the figure saiikara.1 One type of sankara is defined thus:When contradictory figures appear, when they cannot function together, and when there is neither right nor wrong in accepting just the one, we have sankara.(Udbhata, 5.11 Indurâja = 5.20 Viurti)2An example is a verse of mine:Moon-faced she is,dark water-lily-eyedand with teeth of white jasmine:God has given her forms of beauty from sky, river and earth.Either metaphor or simile may appear here, depending on whether we analyse “moon-faced” as “having a moon for her face” [by Pani"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"1552.1.72], or as “having a face like the moon” [by Panini 2.1.56]. As both figures cannot be entertained at the same time and as there is no compelling reason to accept or reject one of the other, we have here the figure sankara. As there is no evidence that one of the components is denoted and the other suggested, what possibility is there here of dhvanilAnd what chance is there in the second type, where a figure of sound and a figure of sense occur in one [sentence]? As iRemember as Kama your lover,in whose embrace you have found delight,3where we have the figure of sound yamaka4 and the figure of sense simile.In the third type too, where more than one figure of sense is found in a single portion of a sentence, inasmuch as both are equally presented literally], how can either be suggested? As in:They rise and sink together, so when the bright sun has set, the weary day for rest enters as it were the cave of night.(Bhämaha 3.48)sFor in this stanza the partial metaphor [viz., “the cave of night”] im­plies a full metaphor of a well-bred man eager to perform the appro- , priate duty [of self-immolation] on the fall of his master. [The partial metaphor is directly expressed] and poetic fancy is also directly ex­pressed, viz., by the term, “as it were.\" 6 These two types are embodied in the following definition: “When figures of sound and sense occur in one sentence or one portion of a sentence, we have the figure sankara” (Udbhata, 5.12 Induräja = 5.22 Vivrti).The fourth type is where there is a relation of assistance between the figures. As in this:These glances of the long-eyed maid that tremble like water-lilies in the wind: did she borrow them from the does of the wood, or did the does borrow them from her?(Kumärasambhava 1.46)Although a likening of Pârvatï’s glances to the glances of female deer is here suggested, the simile becomes subordinate from its role as as­sistant in giving rise to the figure sandeha (poetic doubt) ,7 for by its§ 1.13 i L]"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"assistance we end up with the figure sandeha. This [fourth type of sankara] is defined: “Where figures are placed in mutual assistance and lack independent being, that too is the figure sankara\" (Udbhata,5.13 Induräja = 5.25 Vivrti).This is what our author refers to in the words when a figure, etc. And so the existence of dhvani in the fourth type is ruled out. We have already stated that there is no possibility of dhvani in the second and third types. But in regard to the first type, exemplified in “Moon­faced she is,” etc., one might suspect the possibility. This he now rules out: where either of two figures. Equal: because our mind sways between the two.But now, when the suggested sense appears to be predominant, what are we to do? Take the example:The masses have no care of quality but easily fall for reputation.The moonstone sweats at sight of the moon but not at my true love’s face.8Here the figure arthäntaranyäsa (substantiation) appears, literally ex­pressed, but vyatireka (contrast) and apahnuti (feigned denial) appear by suggestion and are predominant. Having this in mind, he says, b u t if, etc. He answers the problem with th en we m ay assign it. That is to say, this is not sankara at all, but is the second type of dhvani called alankâradhvani (sugestion of a figure of speech) .9 What was said under the subject of paryäyokta [viz., that dhvani is of wider range than the figure and is always predominant] may be equally applied here.Now he gives a general means of denying the possibility of a (predomi­nant) suggested sense in any form of sankara: furtherm ore. One must construe by changing the position of the particle api. The sense is, “ev­erywhere in the figure sankara,” as distinguished from any particular variety. For fusion means a mingling, a complete commixture.10 How would one element predominate any more than in the mixture of milk and water? 11. Frequently more than one figure of speech is found in a sentence or stanza. Such cases are assigned to samsrsft (association) or to sankara (fu­sion). In samsrsti the figures are associated “like sesamum grains and rice grains” ; that is, they can be distinguished and separated. In sankara the mix­ture, “like milk and water,” is irresolvable. By Abhinava’s time sankara was divided into four types, which he will here define and illustrate, (a) alankâra- sandigdhatva, where there is doubt to which of two alankdras the case should[ § 1.13 i L"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"157be assigned; (b) alankäraikaväkyänvpravesa (also called alankâraikavâcakànv- pravesa), where two or more figures, with no doubt as to their identification, are combined in a single sentence; (c) alankâraikavàkyâméânupraveéa, the same as type two except that here the figures are combined in a single portion of a sentence; (d) alankärähgängitva (or alaiikäränugrähyänugrähakabhäva), where the two figures assist each other, where the charm of each depends on its involvement with the other. The whole scheme is often simplified by combining types two and three. Änanda shows a clear awareness of types one and four. Abhinava, in interpreting Ananda’s remarks to cover all four types, quotes ancient authors whose verses, as the footnotes will show, do not always fit exactly the later scheme which he has in mind. 2. The text of Udbhata reads anekälankriyä, “more than one figure,” rather than “con­tradictory figures.” 3. The better attested reading is priyam sma ramose (Kaumudi). If one takes priyam ramayase, the sense will be “whom you de­light with your embrace.” The line is in prthvi meter. 4. Yamaka is the repetition of two or more syllables of the same sound but in different mean­ing, e.g., smaram and sma ram(ase). 5. Abhinava is taking this verse as an example of the third type of sankara called ekavdkyämsänupraveäa. Bhämaha furnished it as an example of a figure which he called utpreksânvaya, a figure of far more restricted application than the type of sankara which Abhinava wishes to exemplify. Bhämaha requires for his figure an ambiguous expres­sion (slista), here instanced in udayâvasâna, which may mean the rising and setting of heavenly bodies, or the success and failure of humans. In addi­tion there must be utpreksâ (poetic fancy), here evidenced by the particle iva, “as it were,” and also “a sense of metaphor” (rüpakärtha). By the last stipulation I suppose he refers to the partial metaphor (ekadesavivartiräpaka) 'that is directly expressed in the stanza. It is partial because it encompasses only one element of the sentence, the darkness to which the day goes. The much larger, suggested metaphor, which involves all elements of the sentence, is another matter, which Abhinava will speak of and which we shall remark on in the following note. 6. We are left with the difficult problem of the implied metaphor. It is difficult to see how it can be regarded as other than suggested. Presumably Abhinava takes the suggestion as subordinate to, and merely embellishing, the literally expressed partial metaphor. By such a view he could claim that as none of the figures is predominant, there is no dhvani in the verse. But surely this is a perverse reading of the poem. The suggested metaphor, or aprastutaprasamsâ, forms its heart and its whole beauty. What we relish and remember is the suggestion of a faithful servant who begins to die a little when his beloved master dies. Abhinava’s rejection of dhvani in this case can be explained only by his wish to exclude all cases of suggestion that were involved in the old system of aiankdras. This is an old verse by an au­thor who did not recognize dhvani. 7. Our reading sandeha here and in the next line is preferable to the Kaumudî’s reading sasandeha. Udbhata, whose§ 1.13 i L ]"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"158remarks on this figure are referred to by Änanda later on (2.26 A), makes a distinction between sasandeha (embodiment of doubt) and sandeha (poetic doubt). The first figure he finds in those verses where the doubt is expressly corrected, e.g., “People wonder on seeing the conch in Visnu’s hand, 'Is this a wild goose that has come to the lotus growing from his navel?’ But no, it does not move.” In sandeha, on the other hand, the doubt is not removed. Rather, it gives rise to a suggestion of some other figure of speech. The ex­ample here quoted from Kalidasa is clearly of the latter type. Whether we regard the sandeha as giving rise to upamä or the suggested upamä as giving rise to sandeha is unimportant. The doubt is not resolved and there are two figures here assisting each other. In later authors the terminology is changed. Both of Udbhata’s figures are known by the same name (by Mammata as sa­sandeha, by most others as sandeha), but the former type is distinguished as “containing a resolution” (niscayagarbha or niscayänta) while the latter type is called “pure” (suddha). 8. We have taken the readings of the Kaumudi,pahnavaï (for the senseless pahinusat) and na before piämuhe. The point of the verse is that the poet would portray the face of his beloved as more beauti­ful than the moon. He arranges the stanza in such fashion that the suggestion of her beauty is expressed by an arthäntaranyäsa (substantiation) apparently intended for quite a different purpose. For definitions of substantiation see Dandin 2.169, Mammata 10.109. A general statement may be substantiated by a particular (as here), or a particular by a general. Moon-stones give off moisture (they are said to sweat or to weep) when exposed to the light of the moon. But, ignorant creatures that they are, they fail to sweat at the lady’s face, which is more beautiful. This instance substantiates the general rule that common people respect reputation rather than true quality. The figure substantiation is explicit. The vyatireka (see 1.1 Intro. L, note 12), in the form “My true love’s face is more beautiful than the moon,\" is merely suggested, as is also the apahnuti in the form “This is not the moon; the true moon is my beloved’s face.” 9. Änanda will treat alahkàradhvani under 2.21.10. We take this sense for lolïbhâva from the comment not found in PW.[ § 1.13 i LA So also in aprastutaprasamsä (reference by means of the ex­traneous, allegory) . 1 When, by a relation of general and particular, or cause and effect, there is a connection of a literally stated extraneous"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"159matter with the suggested subject in hand, then the literally stated and the suggested meanings are equally important. To begin with the case where there is a connection of a literally stated extraneous gen­erality with a suggested germane particular: although we apprehend the particular as important [for that is the final intention of the sen­tence], we must admit that the general statement is equally important because the particular cannot exist without the general. Again, when a [literally stated] particular ends up in a general suggestion, [although the general suggestion is important as being the final intention] the particular is also important because all particulars are included in the general. The same principle holds where the relation is one of cause and effect [viz., cause cannot exist without effect, nor effect without cause; so both are equally important]. But in an aprastutaprasamsä where the connection of extraneous and germane is based solely on similarity, there, if thé literally stated extraneous [member of the] similar [pairs] is not intended to be predominant, the case falls in the area of dhvani. Otherwise, it will just be one of the figures. 1§ 1.13j A )1. The literal meaning of the term aprastutaprasamsä is \"praise by means of the extraneous.” The extraneous is the matter not in hand. Bhämaha (3.29-30) and Dandin (2.340) take the name quite literally. To them aprastu­taprasamsä was simply a special type of samäsokti where the matter in hand (the prastuta or real subject intended) is praised by a statement of something extraneous (aprastuta). Thus in Bhämaha’s example we find praise of the magnanimity of trees, by which one understands the intended praise of good and generous men. Dandin’s example praises the simple life of deer in the forest, from which one is to understand his praise of a life away from court where one need not fawn upon kings. It is Udbhata (5.8 Induräja = 5.14 Virati) who dispenses with the notion of praise. Any mention of an extraneous matter, if it is so connected with the subject in hand as to suggest it, is called aprastutaprasamsä. Änanda accepted Udbhata’s definition and then divided the figure into three or five types. The five types are: where something general suggests the particular, where a particular suggests the general, where a cause suggests the result, where a result suggests the cause, and where like suggests like. The first and second, as also the third and fourth, may be taken together, giving only three types. The last type of all (also called anyokti) is essentially the Graeco-Latin allegory. Later writers went on to subdivide the last type also."},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"[ § 1.13 j LL The praise of something different,that is, other than the matter in hand, is called aprastutaprasamsä.It is threefold. 1What is meant is a description of extraneous matter which hints at the matter in hand. This hint is threefold, as it is based on a relation of general and particular, on a relation of cause and effect, or on similar­ity. In the sentence beginning W hen by a relation and ending with equally im p o rtan t our author sets forth the thesis that in the first two of these types the extraneous matter and the matter in hand are equally important.In the type based on a relation of general and particular there are two methods of procedure. One method is where a general statement which is extraneous is literally expressed and the particular, which is the matter in hand, is suggested; as in the following:Ah, the cruelty of worldly life, the malignity of misfortune!Ah, the tragic ways of fate deceptive in its very nature.Here the power of fate in its general form, which is extraneous to the poet’s real intention, and which is stated throughout the verse, ends up in [a suggestion of] the matter in hand, which is a particular disaster that has befallen someone. Here the general statement, which is lit­erally expressed, is as important as the particular, which is suggested, because the species is logically included in its genus; for there is no con­tradiction in the simultaneous importance of general and particular.When a particular which is extraneous suggests a general statement which is germane, we have the second type; as in the following:It is not so much that at first the fool imagined a drop of water upon a lotus leaf to be a pearl; but hear what happened next: as he tried to take it slowly on his finger tip with gentle motion, it melted at his touch.At this he cried, “Alas, it has flown away!” and now he cannot sleep from inner grief.(Bhallatasataka 94)2"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"In this stanza the matter intended by the poet is the general princi­ple that people imagine greatness in what is really nothing, while the extraneous subject is particular, that of imagining a pearl in a drop of water. Here too there is no contradiction in the simultaneous im­portance of the general and the particular, as has been said. In this way our author has dealt with the first type in its two varieties in the passage from “to begin w ith” to “all p articu lars are included in th e general.”Extending the same principle to the type based on a relation of cause and effect, our author shows that it too has two varieties: w here th e relation is one of cause and effect. Sometimes a cause, which is extraneous, is presented literally in order to suggest an effect, which is the matter in hand. For example:They who take joy in your success and stay with you in adversity are your true relatives and friends; other seek only their own benefit.Here the speaker states explicitly a cause which is extraneous to his real intent. The cause is that good men by their faithful attachment are friends and relatives to us. He states this in order to suggest what he really intends, namely that his own words should be trusted.3 Although we apprehend the effect here, our apprehension of the cause becomes important from its giving life to the effect; so both cause and effect are ilnportant.Sometimes an effect, which is extraneous, being literally presented suggests a cause which is the matter in hand. An example will be found in the Setubandha:I remember before the churning of the sea heaven without its pärijäta trees,Visnu without his LaksmI by his sideor the kaustvbha jewel upon his breast, and Sivawithout the lovely moon within his locks.(Setubandha 4.20) 4Here Jämbavän describes his memory of Visnu’s breast without the kaustubha jewel or LaksmI, and so on, which are matters extraneous to, and at the same time a cause of, what is his real intention. He does this in order to suggest the result, namely that his service of the elder gods, his longevity, and his skill in negotiations fit him to be accepted as an advisor. Here the suggested and the literal senses are equally§ 1*13 j L ]"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"162important, for although we apprehend the cause to be important, the effect, which is literally presented, raises itself [into importance] by its giving life to that cause.After dealing with these two types, each of which is twofold, he ex­amines the third type, which is based on similarity. Here too there axe two varieties. Sqmetiraes the charm [and therefore the importance] comes from the extraneous matter which is literally presented, while the suggested matter is subservient. An example is this verse by my teacher Bhattenduräja:He who brought you back to life and by his strength supported, who carried you upon his back and even gave you worship: that man you kill with but a smile.0 brother zombie, you show yourself to be the prince of gratitude.5Here, although some other ingrate is suggested by the power of simi­larity, the charm and interest of the stanza lie in the anecdote of the zombie (vetdla), which is extraneous. The sense is not impossible as would be a reproach against an insentient being, and the anecdote is not without attraction. So the predominance here lies in the literal sense.But if the matter in hand is charming and is suggested by a literal description of an extraneous subject possessing properties such as in- sentiency which render it impossible for the described purpose, then we have a case of vastudhvani. An example is a verse of my own:lYoop of delights, who storm the hearts of men and make them dance in many an antic step; concealing your own intention as you play; men call you brute and stupid, in their ignorance thinking themselves intelligent thereby.That title of stupidity, I think, if given to them would be honorific, for it would seem to liken them to you.Here the germane matter, which is revealed by suggestion, is the ex­traordinary way of life of a man while he is being despised by the world as a fool. What is meant is a great man, who has rolled back the curtains of darkness by an eye of deep penetration and who lives a worldly life on the principle of “unimpassioned yet as though with[ § 1.13j L"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"passion,” concealing his real self and accepting the reproaches of men as he causes their tongues to wag.[The literal meaning.] A delight, such as a garden or moonrise, is despised by men as being a brute thing, but it can make the heart of an absent lover grieve with yearning, or make the heart of another overflow with joy. Of what sort its own heart may be no one knows. In fact it is vastly deep and intelligent, utterly void of pride and skilful at play. Now if people for that reason call it brute and stupid when it stands rather in honor because of its implied intelligence, and for the same reason honor themselves as intelligent when they are, rather, worthy of being considered stupid, then the expression “you are brute and stupid,” being established as an epithet of the troop of delights, which we have seen are really intelligent, will, rather, be an honorific. What is hinted at is that men are worse than stupid.6 He indicates all this in the sentence b ut if.Otherw ise: otherwise it will just be another figure of speech, that is, the particular figure of speech [apTastutapTasamsä], but never when the suggested element is predominant.1. The definition is, basically, the one given by Bhämaha (3.29), but Abhinava has changed the last päda. The original says nothing of the figure’s being threefold. The second half reads aprastutaprasamseti sä coiva kathyate yathâ. The division into types is first found in Änanda. 2. I have fol­lowed the interpretation of both Kaumudï and BP. The point of the stanza is that it is not so egregious a folly to mistake a drop of water for a pearl; after all, they look alike. But to be so convinced of one’s error that one will attribute volitional flight to a pearl shows the overwhelming power of vain hope in humanity. Abhinava’s readings are superior to those of the printed text of Bhallata, which has srnvann akasmäd api in b and tatas in place of éanais in c. The alteration in b seems to have arisen from a reader who misunderstood tasya mukhdt to mean “from his mouth,” presumably from the mouth of someone playing a joke on the fool. The verse is quoted again by Mammata 10.441, p. 621. Bhallata’s Éataka comprises the work of vari­ous authors; see 1.14 A, note 6. 3. One could scarcely elicit this meaningwithout knowing the context in which the words were spoken. But Abhinava doubtless knew the context, as did Hemacandra who also quotes the verse (AC 559, p. 365), where he says that the words are spoken by Jarâsandha (the enemy of Krishna, soon to be slain by Bhlma). Presumably the quota­tion is taken from some lost play. 4. The stanza forms the opening lines in Jämbavän’s speech of advice to the leaders of the army about to attempt an assualt on Lanka. Jämbavän is the Methuselah of Indian legend. The trees, LaksmT, the kaustubha jewel, and the moon were all acquired from the§ 1.13 j L ] 163"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"164gods’ churning of the sea many thousand years ago. 5. The verse is ironic and is used allegorically. In the Vetâlapancaviméati the belief is found that a corpse can be brought to life as a vetâla (zombie). As first revived, the vetâla cannot walk but must be carried. If worshipped with Tantric rites he may give the practitioner magic powers. Perhaps one may infer from this stanza that if the vetâla smiles the practitioner will die. The translation of vetâla by ‘Vampire,” though sanctioned by long usage, is misleading. The vetâla does not suck blood; he is a revived corpse, a zombie. 6. What is one to make of Abhinava’s account of his own verse? The literal meaning of the stanza is not difficult. “Men who decry, as do the non-Tantric philosophers, the delights of love and of the senses, calling them brute pleasures, are really stupider than the pleasure they run down. So I will not copy them by calling names. To call them stupid would be to compliment them.” Now it is true that the literal sense is impossible from the realistic point of view in which the words “pos­sible” (sambhâvya) and “impossible” are used by the Älankärikas. Neither garden nor moonrise, being insentient, actuallly makes the heart dance, nor do they conceal their own heart, for they have none. So one is forced to look for a second meaning. To pass to that second meaning is more difficult. Abhi- nava has thrown what seems to me a needless stumbling block in our way by the discrepancy between the plurality of delights (or stimulants, bhâvavmta) and the singularity of the great man (mahâpurusa). But the great man does conceal his thoughts. His causing the tongues of men to wag, in the case of the Päiupatas and I dare say of many Tantrics, was a premeditated instigation of reproach; see D. H. H. Ingalls, “Cynics and Pääupatas: The Seeking of Dis­honor,” Harvard Theological Review 55.4 (1962). There is also an underlying compatibility of the Tantric adept, seeking molaa by the path of bhoga, and the worldly stimulants amidst which he lives.[§ 1*13j LA Here then is a summary of the matter:Where the suggested meaning does not predominate but merely accompanies the literal sense, there we clearly have ornaments of the literal [i.e., figures of speech] such as samäsokti and the rest.Where the suggested appears only faintly, or merely follows along with the literal, or is not felt to be the more important: in such places there is no dhvani."},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"Only where word and sense are subordi and directed toward the suggestion, and where there is no fusion (sankara), are we in the area of dhvani.Accordingly, dhvani cannot be included in any other category. And for this reason too it cannot be included: because it is a particular poetic whole (angin) that has been called dhvani. Its parts will be shown in the sequel to be the figures of speech, the qualities (punas) and the alliterations (vrttis).1 A part, if taken by itself, is never known as a whole, while if taken together with the whole, it is recognized as a part of it, not as the whole itself. Even where one of the elements [which are normally parts] does constitute a case of dhvani,2 dhvani because of its vast range is not li ited to it.1. For the punas and vrttis see 1.1 a A, notes 4 and 5. 2. As in certaincases of parydyokta (see 1.13 h .4) or sankara (see 1.13 i A).§ 1.13k L ]L In the list [of seven figures of speech] with which our author began [his discussion (1.13 c A)], the words “and the like\" refer to any other figure where a suggestion may be imagined, that is, to vydjastuti (trick praise) , 1 etc. Our author proceeds to give a general answer to all cases of that sort: H ere th en , etc. His feeling is that it is useless to write on each particular figure.Among such figures [we may give] an example of vyàjastuti:What good is done by telling on other wives?And yet, being a chatterbox by nature and a southerner as well,I can’t keep still.She's in everybody’s house,in the market, at the crossroads and at drinking bouts; she runs about like a drunkard, does your mistress.Oho, but her name is Fame.(Vidyâ?)1Here it is the literal meaning that is embellished by the suggestion in the form of praise. Another critic has offered the following as an example of the figure:"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"[ § 1.13k LThe great earth, lord, engirdled by the sea, was wedded to your grandsire; she next became your mother, while today to raise a family you keep her as your wife.After a full century, without reproach, she will be married to your son.Say is this decent in a line of kings who know the rules of proper conduct?This stanza strikes me as obscene, because it causes one to think of highly indecent things. And what does the praise amount to? That you are king by hereditary succession. What is so great about that? Trick praise of this sort will be reproved in any company of senstive critics and deserves to be ignored.(To explain the term “etc.” in his remark “vyäjostuti, etc.,” Abhinava takes up another figure of speech, bhäva (expression of inner feeling):]If an alteration [of a given state of mind], arising from an [apparently] un­connected cause, gives us to understand the intention and its connection with that cause, we have the figure bhäva. (Rudrata 7.38)3Here too if the literal sense is predominant, the case is one of a figure of speech, bhäva. That is to say, if an alteration of a state of mind appears, such as the speaking of certain words not normally connected (with their apparent cause], and gives us to understand for what reason the intention embodied in that state of mind [has arisen]—here the reason may be such as the aim of enjoying the pleasures of love without stint—we have the figure of speech, bhäva. For example:As I am a weak woman,young and left in the housewhile my husband has gone abroad,with no one here but my blind and deaf mother-ihow can you be so foolish, traveler,as to ask to spend the night?(Rudrata 7.41)*Here a suggestion embellishes the literal sense of each word and so the literal sense is predominant. On the other hand, if the suggested sense were predominant, we should not have a figure of speech at all, as we have shown before.5 So enough of many words.W here: i.e., in a poem. O rnam ents: it is because they are orna­ments that they act only to embellish the literal sense."},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"167A ppears only faintly: that is, where there is a vague impression, as in the simile, etc. [suggested by the figure dipaka, etc.]. Follows along w ith th e literal: the meaning of following along with the literal is the having of equal importance with it, as in aprastutaprasamsd. N ot felt to be: where its predominance does not appear clearly, but must be forced on it and so does not really enter the heart, as in the verse, “Turn back, I beg you,” as explained by other commentators.6 By these two verses he shows that in four cases we are not justified in speaking of dhvani: where the suggested sense, although it is present, is not pre­dominant [being a mere ornament], where it is faintly perceived, where it is equally important with the literal, and where its predominance is not clear. Where then are we justified? He tells us, only w here word and sense are subordinate. He adds, where th ere is no fusion. By “fusion” he means the possibility of inserting any figure of speech. It is wrong to interpret as “without the figure called saiikara (fusion),\" for then it would b'e difficult to take the proviso as prohibiting other figures.A nd for this reason too: not only by reference to the contradiction of denoter-denoted to suggestor-suggested can it be shown that the figures of speech and dhvani are not identical, but because there is a contradiction between the nature of a whole and of a part, as there is between that of master and servant. Its parts: that is, taken singly, as he goes on to say: if taken by itself. Very well, then, let us not take [a figure of speech] by itself but regard it in the context of the whole. In defense against this proposal he says, if taken together with the whole. It is then not the whole itself because other constituents are included in the whole; and among its constituents is the suggested sense which is not a figure of speech because of its predominance. He makes this point with the words: not th e whole itself.Now it may be objected against our author that he has consecrated an occasional instance [of what appears to be a figure of speech] with predominance and has recognized it as the soul of poetry, dhvani.7 With this in mind, he now says, even w here one of these, etc. He has not consecrated any one of the figures, such as samdsokti, as dhvani itself, because each figure may exist separately from dhvani and because dhvani is found in the absence of all figures of speech, samdsokti and the rest, as in the stanzas “Mother-in-law sleeps here” (1.4 c A) and “Who would not be angry” (1.4 f .4). He makes this point with the words, is not lim ited to it.1.

This is the old sense of the term, as defined and illustrated by Bhämaha (3.31), Dandin (2.343), Vämana (4.3.24) and Udbhata (Induräja 5.9 = Vivrti 5.16-17). There is no evidence that Abhinava recog­nized the extended definition which Mammata (10.112, p. 670) picked up from Rudrata’s vyäjaälesa (Rudrata 10.11) and which has been followed by all later Älankärikas. In the later view, vyäjastuti may be either trick praise or false praise (vyäjarüpä stutih), i.e., a sentence apparently offering praise, but as one thinks of the implications, expressing reproach. 2. The stanza is ascribed to Vidyä by the oldest of our preserved anthologies, SRK 996. The ascription has this in its favor, that Vidyä was a southerner and an admirable poetess. But other anthologies ascribe it to Mätahga-diväkara (Éârng. 1227, SubhÄ. 2544). The verse has given rise to much discussion; see Ruyyaka, p. 144, and Rasa- gangddhara, p. 418. 3. Abhinava here quotes Rudrata’s definition of thefirst type of bhäva. He goes on to interpret the definition so that it may fit Rudrata’s illustration of the second type of bhäva, which he quotes, omitting the illustration of the first type and the definition of the second type. I can­not say whether Abhinava does this advisedly, with the intention of reducing Rudrata’s two types to one, or by mistake. He may have read from a defec­tive copy of Rudrata, where the verses were omitted, or his memory may have played him false. At any rate, the original, as it stands in Rudrata, runs as follows: 7.38 (naturally interpreted): When an emotional alteration (tnJfcdro) of a person, arising from a cause which is not [normally] connected with it [i.e., productive of it], gives us to understand what that [cause] means to that person and that [in this case] it really is so connected, we have the figure bhäva. 7.39 (illustration): On seeing the village youth / with a vancula flower in his hand / the face of the young girl / changes color. The commentator Namisädhu explains. The girl would not normally be affected at sight of a van- cula flower, so we seek for an explanation. It lies in the suggestion that she has made a rendezvous with the youth in a vancula grove, which she was prevented from keeping. When she sees the youth with a vancula flower in his hand, she realizes that he kept the tryst and that she has missed the opportunity of love- making. 7.40: When a sentence, in denoting just this, gives us to understand something that differs from this in regard to good and bad, we have another type of bhäva. 7.41 (illustration): As I am a weak woman, etc., as quoted by Abhinava. 4. The verse has been a favorite and is quoted in virtually all the great anthologies: Éârng. 3773, SubhÄ. 2234, SûktiM. 87.11, Sadukti. 547. It portrays by innuendo an unchaste wife (osati) and has just as good a claim to be considered a case of vastudhvani as the verse ‘‘Go your rounds freely, pious monk” (1.4 b A). But see the following footnote. 5. Viz., 1.13 h L, com­menting on the remark of A: “if the suggestion is predominant.\" It is of course a matter of taste whether one regards the literal sense or the suggested sense as more important. But Abhinava takes the fact that the verse was quoted by Rudrata as illustrating a figure of speech to show that the literal sense must[ § 1.13k L"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"169predominate. On the other hand, the verse “Go your rounds freely, pious monk” was quoted by Änanda as an illustration of dhvani. A Sanskrit com­mentator, without strong provocation, will not argue with ancient authorities. The irreverent Westerner of course is free to do so. 6. See the interpreta­tion given in 1.4 e L of this verse, where it is shown that some critics took the verse to exemplify preyo’lankära or rasavadalankära. 7. See 1.13j A, end of passage, and the illustrative stanza “Troop of delights,” etc., in 1.13 j L§ 1.131 L]A When [Kärikä 1.13] says “which the wise call dhvani,” this means that the term was invented by men of knowledge and that it has not been put into use inadvisedly. The preeminent men of knowl­edge are the grammarians, for all the sciences rest upon grammar; and they gave the name dhvani to the sounds of speech that are heard. In the same manner other wise men, who knew the true essence of po­etry, have followed the example of the grammarians by giving the title dhvani to that verbal entity which contains a mixture of denotative and denoted elements and which is designated as “a poem.\" They did so because of the similarity [to acoustical dAvani] in its being a manifestor [of suggested meanings just as the heard sounds manifest words]. Now this being the nature of dhvani, the range of which is immense when one counts up all the types and subtypes which we shall soon describe, its illumination bears no comparison to a report on some mere individ­ual figure of speech that has hitherto remained unknown [cf. 1.1c A]. So the excitement of those whose m inds are saturated with dhvani is quite within reason, nor should others exhibit toward them an intel­lect stained by jealousy. And so by this, those at least who deny the existence of dhvani stand refuted.L W as invented by m en of knowledge. The compound vidvad-upajhä is a bahuvrihi modifying uktih, literally, “a term of which the upajnä or first use was by men of knowledge.” Accordingly, the neuter gender demanded by Pan. 2.421 when upajnä is used in a tatpurusa is here inapplicable.T he sounds of speech which are heard: According to the process [described in the Nyäya-Vaisesika] it is the last sound of a chain of sounds that enters the orifice of the ear. so the heard sounds are sounds born of sounds, [not the original sounds produced by the organs of"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"170speech] .1 These sounds in form are like the reverberations of a bell,2 and it is these sounds that are called dhvani. As the master Bhartrhari has said:Others have expressed the view that the sphota is bom from conjunction and disjunction with the organs of articulation; the dhvanayah (plural) are the sound-born sounds. ( Vâkyapadïya 1.102)3In the same way, the suggested meaning has been called dhvani,* as it too is often characterized5 by a reverberation analogous to the pulsa­tions of a bell. Again, the phonemes as heard, technically called näda- sabdas, manifest the semantic unit,® which we comprehend as soon as we cognize the final phoneme. These phoneme-manifestors are called dhvanis. As the same master says:The true form [i.e., the semantic content] in the word that is manifested by the dhvani is determined by a series of cognitions [viz., the cognitions of the successive phonemes], which are unnameable [that is to say, each phoneme- cognition in itself is unassignable to this word or that], but favorable to the final [word-identifying] cognition. ( Vâkyapadïya 1.83)So we too use the term dhvani for the word and the [literal] sense which manifest [the suggested meaning] .7Furthermore, it is in the varnas (the phonemes produced by the conjunction and disjunction of the vocal organs) that the differences of prosodical length (e.g., a and a, i and i) reside, as has been said: Either the mind does not perceive a sound if it is pronounced too softly, or it perceives clearly the whole phoneme, [e.g., we never hear half an d]. (Ruma­nia, Slokavärttika, Sphotaväda, vs. 10)As these same differences are heard in the secondary sound, [or dhvani, that reaches the ear], it is only such other elements of the speaker’s speech, such as its slow or rapid delivery, elements over and above the well-defined operations of articulation [e.g., prosodical length, as­piration, closure, etc.] that are more particularly called dhvani. As Bhartrhari® has said:The derivative\"dhvanis (i.e., the sounds which reach the ear) after they have manifested the word continue to carry in themselves the variations in speed of utterance, but the nature of the phonemes9 is not altered by them. ( Vâkya­padïya 1.77)In like manner we [poeticians] apply the word dhvani to an opera­tion over and above the well known operations of denotation, sentence­meaning and secondary usage. 10 Thus we have four senses of dhvani;[ § 1.131 L"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"171and by combining them we may speak of a whole poem as dhvani.11 It is for this reason that statements both of its difference [from poetry, as in “dhvani is the soul of poetry,” 1.1 A] and of its identity [as in 1.13 K, which Abhinava interprets as speaking of “poetry, as a distinctive type of literature, which the wise call dhvani”] are not improper.(Abhinava now gives a highly artificial analysis of the compounds väcya-väcaka-sammisTa and sabdätmä, which we translated as a m ix­tu re of denotative and denoted entities and as verbal entity respectively.] Väcya-väcaka-sammisra is a compound from which the penultimate member has been dropped. 12 It stands for väcya-väcaka- sahita-sammisra, “possessing mixtures as well as denotative and de­noted elements.” The sense of addition is given without the use of “and,” as in “ox, horse, man, beast.” By this analysis one can see that the denoted sense can be called dhvani and the denoted word can be called dhvani, for both of them are suggestive inasmuch as both hint at (dhvanati) the suggested sense. As they form a mixture when they axe combined with the vibhävas and anubhävas, the suggested sense also, [which consists of such a mixture,] can be called dhvani, for it is what is hinted at (dhvanyate). The word sabda in the compound sabdätma means sabdana, “a putting into words,” or verbal operation, and that not in the form of the denotative operation but in the form of the ätman, “the soul,” of poetry. This [suggestive operation] can also be called dhvani, for it is a hinting. Finally the object “which is des­ignated as a ‘poem’ ” can also be called dhvani because it is composed of the four other types of dhvani in the manner just described.And so he states the reason common [to both the grammatical and the poetical traditions for the use of the same term dhvani]: because of th e sim ilarity in its being a m anifestor. The relation of manifestor and manifested,13 present in general in all four senses [of poetic dhvani], is common (to the term as used by the grammarians]. This is the meaning.It was objected [in 1.1 c A] that because the possibilities of speech are endless, [there may well be some small variety which has hitherto re­mained unknown and which might be called dhvani]. He answers that objection with now this being th e n atu re of dhvani, etc. The types which we shall soon describe: there are two main types. T he subtypes: for example, the subtype “where the literal is shifted to another sense” (arthäntarasankramitaväcya) and that “where the literal is entirely set aside” (atyantatiraskrtaväcya), both of these be­longing to the main type “where the literal meaning is not intended”§ 1.131 L ]"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"172(avivaksitaväcya) ; 14 and the subtypes “where the suggested meaning is produced without apparent sequence” (asamlaksyakramavyangya) and that “where the sequence is apparent\" (samlaksyakramavyangya), these belonging to the type “where the literal is intended but is subordinated to a second meaning” ( mvaksitänyaparaväcya) . 15 And even among these subtypes there are further divisions. T he range of which is im ­m ense: the sense is that it covers the whole of poetry. By the word individual he indicates the restricted nature [of a figure of speech]; by the word m ere, its being subordinate. S atu rated (bhävita): that is, whose minds are intent on the nature of dhvani, or, it may mean, whose minds, by being perfumed with its charm, cause them to show such symptoms of emotions as closing their eyes (cf. 1.1c A). Those who deny th e existence of dhvani: that is, those divided into all three categories [described in 1 .1 a, b, c A].1. The Nyâya-Vaisesikas regard sound as a quality set up in the ether by the conjunction and disjunction of matter. This quality spreads from its place of origin through ether in all directions, as waves spread out from a stone dropped in a pond. Just as the wave which reaches the shore is wave-produced, not stone-produced, so the sounds of speech which reach the ear are sound-produced. 2. The basis for comparison is the succession of replicas through a span of time. 3. The view, although here ascribed to others, is close to Bhartrhari’s own. Note that the word sphota as used here is close to its etymological origin, “explosion.” But Bhartrhari regards the sphota not simply as an inferrable physical fact, viz., the sound-explosion that is the ultimate source of the derivative sound that one hears, but as the accompanying metaphysical explosion of a phonemic pattern, a pattern that is devoid of the speed or slurring or variations in pitch and volume of the heard sound (dhvani). Bhartrhari never took the further step, taken by his commentators, of identifying the sphota with the semantic content of the sounds. See S. D. Joshi, The Sphotanirnaya, pp. 33 and 54. 4. HereAbhinava justifies the use of “dhvani\" in sense d of 1.1 K, note 1, viz., as the vyahgya. 5. Note that Abhinava is careful to use the word upalaksita, not laksita. As will be shown in Chapter 2 (see 2.2 and 2.20), it is only the varieties of dhvani other than rasadhvani that give this impression of bell-like reverberation, for in them a sequence is perceived by the auditor between the literal and the suggested sense. In rasadhvani no such sequence appears. Accordingly, it would have been wrong, by using the word laksita, to characterize dhvani as a whole by an impression of reverberation.

The verse is also found in late versions of the Pancatantra: Bom­bay 1.45, Kosegarten 1.51. One may argue over the syntax of suvarnapuspäm. My strong feeling is that it is a kartnadhâmya, used karmany akathite (Pan. 1.4.51; the verb ci is listed in the pariganana). The learned Kuppusvâmï âastri was of the same opinion ( Upalocana, p. 254). The gender of puspä may have been influenced by that of lata or by its proximity to prthivi. Those who would make the Mahäbhärata agree with Classical syntax will of course take the compound as a bahvvrihi. Abhinava has a more improbable explanation. The “flower of gold” here does not mean what it says. It means success, worldly advancement. 2. Quoted also in SRK 439. Poetical use is often made of the belief that sensual pleasures are a reward for merit gained by ascetecism in past lives. See SRK, translation, note on vs. 408. According to Abhinava’s fust explanation, the stanza is an instance of rasadhvani.[ § 1.13m AL He states the result of refuting [the position of those who deny the existence of dhvani]: th ere is such a thing. Now, that dhvani should be no more than secondary usage (laksanä) [which was the fourth objection to the dhvanivâda set forth under 1.1 d A] can be easily explained and answered only after giving examples. So despite the fact that one would expect straightaway a refutation of the view that dhvani is secondary usage [the fourth objection], or that it is indescribable [the fifth objection, cf. 1 .1 e A), the author of the Vrtti here sets forth the two main varieties of dhvani in order to be able to give examples. In doing so he follows [the system set forth by the Kârikâs in] the next chapter:1 and it is To fit the five meanings of udhvani,” the grammatical agreement [of the compound avivaksita-väcya with dhvani] can be achieved by taking it as a bahuvrihi which has simultaneous instrumental, locative, abla­tive, dative, and genitive relations [to its exocentric member].2 When “dhvani” has the sense of väcya (the literal meaning), dhvani itself will be referred to by the element väcya in the compound. The avivaksita- väcyo [dhvanih] will be that type of dhvani (i.e., väcya, literal meaning) by which that literal meaning itself is not intended, that is, is not in­tended to predominate [in the final meaning]. Such a dhvani ill be a suggestor.3 The same sort of analysis can be made of vivaksitänyapara- väcya. Or, in the one option [of the five] where “dhvani” means artha (the literal meaning), we can analyse the compounds as karmadhärayas (simple adjective compounds). Avivaksitaväcyah. will then be an unin­tended literal meaning. Vivaksitänyaparaväcyah will be “a meaning which is literal and which is subordinated to something else which is"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"175intended (to predominate].\" In these two types, sometimes [viz., in avivaksitavâcya] the literal sense is not intended for such reasons as that it makes no sense in the context; sometimes [viz., in vivaksitânya- paravâcya] it is intended insofar as it does make sense in the context, but by the power of its beauty it extends our apprehension to a sug­gested sense. It is on this account that in the second type a meaning is primarily the suggestor, in the first type a word. But is it not a contradiction to say that a meaning is intended and then say that it is subordinated to something else? No, because what is meant is that it is intended only insofar as it is subordinated to a second meaning.In general of two sorts: His view is that although there are three kinds of dhvani—vastudhvani, alahkäradhvani, and rasadhvani—they are included in these two sorts. But we may ask what benefit accrues, after giving the name dhvani, from adding these [particular] names [for its two main varieties]. The benefit is this. The first name indicates the cooperation in the operation called dhvanana (suggestion) of the ap­prehension on the part of the auditor of meanings implied by the three other operations of denotation, sentence-meaning, and secondary us­age, while the second name indicates the cooperation of what is wished to be said, that is, of the intention on the part of the poet. In this way the true nature of dhvani is rendered more apparent.Flow er of gold: the compound suvarnapuspâm [is an upapada com­pound agreeing with prthivi; it]4 means “which flowers forth in gold pieces.” As the sentence thus embodies an impossible meaning, the liberal sense must be unintended. Accordingly, after setting forth the literal sense of the words by denotative power (abhidhä) and giving us the syntax by the power of sentence-meaning (tätparyasakti), the stanza, abandoning this sense because of the obstacle [of impossibil­ity], gives us by the power of secondary usage (laksanä) a meaning which is related by similarity, namely that the three men easily par­take of great wealth. The purpose of this secondary usage is that the praise of the warrior, man of knowledge and servant, which hides be­cause of its not being expressed literally, should rise to the highest value by being suggested, just as the breasts of a beautiful woman [are the more beautiful from being half hidden].5 The primary manifestor of the suggestion here is the word [suvarnapuspâm], but the literal meaning cooperates. All four semantic operations are in use.O n w hat m ountain: for not even such mountains as Srïparvata,6 which give unobstructed success of the highest order, furnish such suc­cess as this.

And no form of austerity, such as sitting amid five fires,7 has been recorded as being productive of such reward. The word tava has been given separately lest it be understood with weakened force, as it would be if placed in compound. His intention is to bring the action of biting into close relation with “you.” Accordingly, those who say that the author failed to use the expression tvad-adhara-pätalama simply because it would not fit into the meter are mistaken.Bite: [the suggestion is that] he tastes it in an unbroken continuity; [that] he does not eat it like a glutton, but rather acts like a connoisseur. Hence [it is suggested that] he has gained his refined taste, just like the other reward, from his austerity. L ittle parrot: From this indication of his youth, we see that he has gained his reward at the proper time. This also must derive from his austerity. We have in this stanza a suggestion made by a lover, which stimulates the [älambana-\\vibhäva [i.e., the lady who is the object of his love]. It takes the form of a clever compliment which transmits his own hidden desire [viz., to kiss the lady’s lip].In this stanza there are only three semantic operations, viz., de­notation, sentence-meaning, and suggestion, [as opposed to the four operations contained in the preceding stanza], for here the third, or middle-stage, operation of metonymy (laksanâ) is missing as there is no blocking of the primary meaning, etc. Or, by a different interpreta­tion, we may say that the third operation, laksanâ, does intervene.9 We may suppose that the primary meaning is blocked by the impossibil­ity of taking literally these improbable questions [directed to a parrot] and that a secondary meaning [of the lover as obtaining the chance to taste his lady’s lip], based on similarity, ensues. But the purpose of the laksanâ is still that which is being suggested, which enters in the fourth stage. There is this difference, however, that in the former verse (“Three men reap the earth”) laksanâ was the chief semantic power to cooperate with suggestion, while here the chief powers are denotation and the power of sentence-meaning, for it is because of the beauty of the literal sense that we apprehend the suggestion. This shows that the operation of laksanâ is helpful only to a very small ex­tent. In that variety of suggestion where the sequence is not noticed at all (asamlaksyakramavyangya) [= rasadhvani] there is no apprehen­sion of laksanâ at all, for the sequence [from the literal to suggested meaning] is not apparent, as we shall show. So we may take it that in the second type of dhvani also [at least as here exemplified] all forms of semantic operation are present.[ § 1.13 m L"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"1771. It has been argued that the present passage, taken in connection with 2.1 K and 2.2 K, shows that the author of the Vrtti and of the Kârikàs was one person. The argument takes the form of a question: “Why would the author of the Kärikäs define the subtypes of dhvani under 2.1 and 2 .2 if he had not already described the major types to which they belong?” But the argument is not conclusive, and I would base my belief in a single authorship on other grounds (see Introduction, pp. 25-27). 2. An English examplemay put the reader who is innocent of Sanskrit grammar on the right track. The phrase “cut-rate competition” can be glossed as “competition by which rates are cut.” Sanskrit grammar would regard “cut-rate” as a bahuvrihi com­pound. It agrees grammatically with the word “competition.” Its exocentric (unexpressed) member is “which.” Its relation to that member is instrumen­tal. 3. Vyanjaka here = vyanjako ’rthah. Abhinava does not trouble to give analyses of the other relations. The locative will apply when “dhvani” has the sense of kävya-, the ablative (“because of which\"), when “dhvani\" has the sense of vyahgya (the suggested meaning); the dative (“for the purpose of”), when “dhvani” has the sense of vyanjana (the suggestive operation); the genitive, when “dhvani” has the sense of väcaka (the denotative word). 4. Apparently Abhinava takes suvarnapuspäm as suvarna plus the root pusp (DhP 4.15, puspyati) plus suffix an (Pan. 3.2.1). 5.

Sitting witha fire on each side and the sun above. 8. It is normally considered inconect to use an expression in which a member outside a compound (here lava) must be construed with the subordinate member of the compound (here adhara in àdhara-pâtalam). Abhinava’s remarks are designed to clear the author of the verse from the charge of inconect usage. The meaning that Abhinava reads into the sentence would be rendered in English by emphasis: “that he bites a cheny as pink as your Up.” Accordingly, the commentaries Kaumudx and BP say that if the word for you were here placed in compound, the author would be guilty of avimrstavidheya, “not giving sufficient prominence to a predica­tive element.” 9. Abhinava’s reason for offering the second interpretation Ues in his general view of the pertinence of both stanzas quoted in this section by Änanda. He views them as introduced before the discussion of bhakti (= laksanä) in 1.14 in order to give examples where laksanä occurs but where it can be shown to be distinct from dhvani. It is true that avivaksitaväcya wiU always furnish such examples. But Abhinava wishes to show that there are cases even of vivaksitänyaparaväcya where a small degree of laksanä is possi­ble. Otherwise there would be no point in Änanda’s mentioning or iUustrating that type of dhvani at this point.§ 1.13m L ]"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"[ § 1.14 KK This dhvani is not indentical with bhakti (secondary opera­tion), because it differs from it in form; nor is it defined by that, because the definition would be both too wide and too narrow.A Here he refutes the objection that dhvani is nothing more than secondary operation (cf. 1.1 K, 1.1 d A). This dhvani, that is, dhvani of the sorts just mentioned, is not identical with bhakti, because it differs from it in form. Dhvani is where a meaning other than the literal is revealed by the literal word and meaning to be the final sense and in that sense a suggested meaning is predominant. A secondary operation is merely a subordinate one. The second half of the couplet shows that bhakti cannot define dhvani. Why cannot dhvani be defined by bhakti? Because the definition would be both too wide and too narrow. Too wide, because bhakti occurs in areas outside those of dhvani. Poets are often found to use words in an associated sense, being prompted by idiom or conformity (to convention] ,1 without any great beauty being generated by the suggestion.

Here “carry away\" is a trope for to charm or fascinate. I am not sure of the sense of ucchinta. Prakrit acchitta means “crazy” according to Pâïa-sadda- mahannavo. Abhinava renders it together with mahiläo as svairinyah, lit., women who disregard in the pursuit of their own inclinations the constraints of husbands or parents. The term is used as a synonym for abhisärikäh; see SRK 233. 5. According to Abhinava. “gives to” is here used in the sense of“rewards with.” 6.

But the verse is here quoted sim­ply for the secondary usage of “suffer.” Sugar cane cannot suffer, so “suffers pressure\" means no more than “is squeezed.\" The stanza is certainly not by Bhallata, who lived under Óarikaravarman (a.d. 883-902), that is, after the time of Änanda; see RâjTar. 5.204 and Jacobi, ZDMG 56, p. 405.

Are bhakti and dhvani identical, the two words being merely synonymns? Or does bhakti define dhvani, marking it off from what is other than dhvani as prthivitva (earthness) marks off from earth what is other than earth? 1 Or is it an upalaksana (occasional characteris­tic), as a crow may be of Devadatta’s house because a crow may be perched on it? (The Kärikä] begins by denying the first possibility: not identical w ith bhakti. The [Vrtti's] phrase, of th e sort ju st m entioned, should be referred to the five meanings of dhvani: word, literal meaning, operation, suggested meaning, and poem.2 To show the difference [of the two concepts] he begins by stating the nature of dhvani: [where a m eaning o th er than] th e literal, etc. To be th e final sense: i.e., the sense that permits our apprehension to come to rest, the sense which is the purpose [of the poet’s employing just those particular words]. Is revealed: he means, is suggested. M erely a su b o rd in ate operatio n (upacäTa): that is, secondary us­age (gunavrtti), metonomy (laksanä). To use an associated sense is to speak in transgression [of the literal sense). By the word “merely” he is referring to cases where a fourth semantic operation, of the nature of suggestion, may be inferred as possible from the mere fact that the third operation has been employed,3 but where this fourth operation, being neither useful nor important, is as good as absent. For the defi­nition of a [primary] purpose is “that with a view to [the acquiring or avoiding of] which one starts about an action.” 4 Inasmuch as secondary usage is found even in such cases, how can one say that the suggestive operation and the operation of dhvani are one and the same thing?[The Kärikä] then rules out the second possibility: because th e definition would be too w ide, etc. N or is it, viz., dhvani, defined by th a t, viz., by secondary operation. It may be objected that the"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"suggestive operation must take place [wherever a secondary operation is employed], so how can one distinguish the area [of dhvani from that of /afcsanä]? To provide against this, [the Vrtti] says: w ithout any g reat beauty. He means, for the reason that the purpose in question is of no importance and nothing is therefore accomplished by the suggestion of it. By the use of the word “great” [he admits that there is some beauty in such cases but that] there is only enough to qualify as a guna (poetic quality), as shown by the definition [of the quality, aptness (somâdAi)]: “the imposition of the property [of one thing] on some [other] thing should be called aptness.” 5But if there is no real purpose in using such expressions, how is it that an author uses them? He answers this objection: “because of prasiddhy- anurodha,” 6 for such has been the usage through a long succession [of writers]. But I would say that prasiddki implies [not that there is no purpose but] that the purpose is too obvious. Although the purpose appears in clear form, it stands in need of something hidden,7 like buried treasure [in order to be in the domain of dhvani}. For in the case of the secondary usage (upacâra) illustrated by “speaks” [in the first of Änanda’s illustrative verses] the purpose is the apprehension by the auditor of “making something quite clear.” If the author had used the obvious literal expression, would the verse lose an element of beauty? Or by his using this covert expression is any element of beauty added? With this in mind our author will say [that dhvani reveals] “a beauty which cannot be conveyed by any other form of expression” (1.15 K).[In the second verse quoted by Änanda] the Prakrit word avarun- dhijjaï means älihgate (there is embracing). “Tautology” is used in its secondary sense of something to be avoided, because the literal meaning [viz., repetition of words] is impossible in the context.[For the third of the quoted verses Abhinava furnishes a Sanskrit translation of the Prakrit and then adds:] In this verse “catch” is used in the secondary sense of receive, “carry away” in the sense of subjecting to their power.[The fourth verse:] Here a husband in the course of normal love-play gives a fight stroke of a fresh vine to the breast of his youngest wife. As this indicates the favor she has attained with him, it proves from its very softness hard to bear in the heart of her fellow wives, who no longer share in his love-play. That a fight stroke given to one person should have its effect on another and be hard to bear “even although so soft,” is startling. In this stanza giving is used in the secondary sense of rewarding.§ 1.14 L ]"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"182[The fifth verse:] Although the word \"suffers” is used in its primary sense with respect to the virtuous man, who is the subject really in­tended, still, with respect to the extraneous subject, sugar cane, which is being praised, as the “suffering” of pressure is impossible, the word is used in a secondary sense of undergoing pressure, so that the whole expression ends up meaning nothing more than “is squeezed.”Now in such cases of course there is some purpose, so how can we avoid saying that there is dhvani? It is in response to such an objection that our author says: Instances like those, etc.1. prthivt prthivïtvasambandhàt, Prasastapäda, Benares ed., p. 41. This so-called definition of earth is justified by Udayana in his Kiranàvalï. He points out that it is not intended to be definitive. We shall still require a definition of prihivitva, which he gives. But such definitions, he insists, do not lead to an infinite regress, in logic any more than in medicine or grammar. One goes on defining until the uneducated man is educated. Then one stops.2. This interpretation is historically impossible. Änanda never distinguishes the five senses in this way. Änanda’s phrase actually refers to the two major types of dhvani that he has just mentioned: avivaksitavâcya and vivaksitänya- paraväcya. 3. Every use of laksanä implies some purpose, for otherwise the speaker would not have departed from literal usage. Thus even in the first of Änanda’s quotations (the verse from the Ratnävali) one may say that the word vadati is used instead of gamayati in order to give the notion that the couch shows very clearly the lady’s suffering. But this is a secondary sort of purpose, not the main purpose of the sentence. It is not really useful to that purpose nor poetically important. 4. Nyâya S. 1.1.24.

Dhvani never occurs primarily because of such words.L Our author has already said that there is no operation of dhvani where the purpose [of choosing to employ a secondary sense] is unimportant. Where there is secondary usage without any basic purpose at all, there too there will naturally be no operation of dhvani. He states this by saying, fu rth erm o re, etc.Words like lâvanya, which means properly “possessing a salty taste,” but which is idiomatically used in such other senses as “charm, beauty,” by the very fact that they are used idiomatically lack that separation [from their proper meaning] which is occasioned by the presence of the triad1 [and so cannot give rise to dhvani}.

These suggestions spring from the primary sense of the word “Ganges,” not from the secondary, or shifted, sense of “bank,” which we need in order to make sense of the expres­sion. It is logic that demands the secondary sense (see 1.4 b L, note 6). The suggestion, the poetry, springs directly from the primary.L The foregoing argument has shown it wrong to say that wher­ever there is bhakti (associated usage) there is dhvani. And so, if we use bhr.kti to define dhvani, the definition will be too wide. But even if we were to grant, for the sake of argument, that bhakti occurs wherever there is dhvani, the object on which the bhakti operates will be different from the object on which dhvani operates. There can be no relation of substance and attribute between entities that occupy different areas; and a definition must be an attribute. 1 Laksanä (bhakti) operates on a secondary object. The operation of dhvani takes place in the area of the purpose. The second semantic operation, laksanä, does not take place in that area, because that area lacks the set of conditions (block­age, similarity, etc.) for secondary usage. It is with this in mind that our author says, and again, etc.[Comment on the Kärikä:] W hen a word abandons its pri­m ary operation, that is, after completing its denotative operation, and reveals, that is, brings to our apprehension, a secondary ob­jec t by secondary use (gunavrtti)—here gunavrtti is a synonym of laksanä—th e purpose, or goal, at which—accusative case—this il­lumination is aimed, is one where another operation comes into play. And this operation is not laksanä, because the laksanä of a word is an operation which moves haltingly, that is, the word’s power of giving information is disturbed by the working of some hindrance, whereas that word in giving us to understand the purpose does not meet with any hindrance. For if it did, we should have to discover a reason for it, [which could only be] some further purpose, which we should have"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"187to discover; and so we should be forced into an infinite regress. Ac­cordingly, there is no place here for laksita-laksanä (secondary usage growing out of secondary usage) .2 To reveal: the word darsanam is a form that includes the causative suffix [i.e., the meaning is “revelation,” not “sight”].[Comment on the Vrtti:] Accom plish here means “suggest.” T h rough a non-prim ary sense: i.e., as disturbed by some hin­drance. In using it, viz., the word. W ould be at fault: It is so that the purpose may be easily apprehended that a word is used in its secondary sense. In the expression “the boy is a lion,” where the notion of the boy’s unusual bravery is to be conveyed, if the word were to operate haltingly, it would not convey to us this notion; so why should it have been used? If you reply that it will convey that notion by a [further] secondary operation, then we shall have to discover a subsequent purpose and still another secondary operation to go with it. So we shall be led to an infinite regress. On the other hand, if you admit that there is no halting motion here, then there can be no sec­ondary operation prompted by the purpose to be conveyed, for the set of conditions for a secondary operation [hindrance, etc.,] will be absent. You cannot say that there is no operation [for conveying the purpose]; and that operation cannot be denotation, for the conventional agree­ment [between denoter and denoted] is absent. This operation, over and above the operations of denotation and secondary usage, can only be the operation of dhvani.' B ut th a t is not th e case: The author is not at fault, because the purpose is readily apprehended. So we see that the denotative power, wishing to pass to its primary meaning but being blocked by some hindrance, continues on because it has not fulfilled its aim. That is why, in speaking [of the associated sense which it does reach], we say, “This is the non-primary sense of the word.\" As there is an acceptance of convention even in the non-primary sense, [one may say that] secondary usage (laksanä) is simply an appendage to denotation (abhidhä).3 11. To define a substance is to furnish its peculiar attribute, that is, the attribute which rules out all other substances. If the attribute occurs in a different area from that of the substance, it obviously cannot serve as a definition. 2. Such is the correct reading furnished by the Kaumudi. The other printed texts read laksana- for laksita-. See 1.4 b L and note 18. BP gives an example to which the term laksita-laksanä may be properly applied: “How is this, slender maid! The month of ärävana is in your eyes, autumn in your cheeks, summer in your limbs and winter in your lotus face.” Here the month§ 1.17 L ]"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"188of Srävana' is used in the sense of the rainy season, which in turn gives rise to the second secondary sense of tears. See also 2.9 L and note 2. 3. Theserather odd remarks are occasioned by Abhinava’s effort to clarify the following Kärikä. Kärikä 1.18 will say that secondary usage (gunavrtti) depends on no more than väcakatva (the denotative power of words), a statement that seems at variance with the semantic system that has been described, where laksand (as likewise gunavrtti) is an independent semantic power which depends on a triad of conditions. Abhinava furnishes us here with two considerations which may explain the apparent change of viewpoint. Laksand arrives at its object, the secondary sense, only at the end of a journey which set out toward the denoted object. In that sense it occurs as an appendage to abhidhd. Then also, it shares in the peculiar property of abhidhd, the convention (samaya, sariketa) between word and meaning. Laksand does not veer aside from the primary sense to any meaning, but only to a secondary meaning that also attaches to the word by convention. One may find many of the secondary senses of a word in a dictionary. In this sense too laksand is closely related to abhidhd. Dhvani, on the other hand, although it requires denotative word and meaning as its trigger, is not dependent on, or closely related to, abhidhd in the two respects here brought to our notice.[ § 1.17 LK Secondary usage (gunavrtti) depends on no more than the denotative power of words. How can it be used to define dhvani, which is based wholly on suggestive power? 1 11. The distinction is expressed here unclearly. Both gunavrtti and dhvani depend to a greater or lesser extent on väcakatva. The distinction lies in the manner in which they depend on it. Abhinava does much to clarify the passage. See 1.17 L, last paragraph and note 3, and his comment below.A Therefore dhvani is one thing and secondary usage another. As a definition it would be too narrow too, because the type of dhvani where the literal is intended but is subordinated to a second meaning,"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"189and many other varieties, do not f 1 in the same area with associated meaning (bhakti). Therefore associated meaning furnishes no defini- tion.§ 1.18 L ]L He sums up: therefore. Since secondary usage (laksanâ) forms simply an appendage to denotation, for that reason; that is to say, since secondary usage (gunavrtti)—he means both its varieties gaum and lâksanikï—depends on denotative operation inasmuch as it arises from an obstruction to that operation and forms an appendage to it, how can secondary usage form a definition of dhvani, which is a suggestive operation? The two processes occur in different areas.[The Vrtti] sums up the matter: therefore. The author means because he has shown its forming too broad a definition and apropos of that discussion [has noted] that it occupies a different area. So, having explained the overextension referred to in the Kärikä which stated “it is not defined by that, because the definition would be both too wide and too narrow (1.14 K ),” he now explains the underextension: it would be too narrow .It would be: that is, secondary usage would be. The definition would be of sufficient extension only if bhakti (associated usage) oc­curred wherever dhvani occurs. And that is not the case, for while bhakti occurs in the presence of that type of dhvani where the literal sense is not intended, as in such verses as “Three men reap the earth” (1.13 m A), how shall we find it in such verses as “On what mountain” (ibid.)?[Objection from the Mlmämsä point of view:] But now, [let us exam­ine the concept of] laksanâ (secondary usage); it extends throughout the qualitative (gauna) as well [as the relational (lâksanika)}. The only difference1 between the qualitative and relational varieties is that in the qualitative the word which indicates an object by laksanâ enjoys grammatical agreement with the word [which denotes that object], as in “The boy is a lion.” 2 Or, we may say that one object [e.g., a lion], by indicating a second object [e.g., a boy who shares in the qualities of a lion], makes the word that denotes the second object agree with the word that denotes itself [i.e., makes the word “boy” agree gram­matically with the word “lion”]. Or, we may say that the word “lion” and the object lion cooperate in indicating; and so both of them fuse with the word denoting that thing and with the thing itself. It has"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"190been said that “the [denotative] word is used in the qualitative vari­ety, but is not used in the relational variety (Iaksanä). But secondary usage (Iaksanä)3 is present there too and so extends to all varieties. And this relational variety is of five sorts,4 as it is based on (a) a conjunction [of the secondary object] with the direct object: for exam­ple, a direct object of the word “dvirepha” (“possessing two r ’s”) is the word “bhramara”—now the word “bhramara” is connected [by the con­ventions of language] with the six-legged creature, a bee; that object may be indicated by the word “dvirepha” because of the bee’s connec­tion with a direct object [of the word “dvirepha'']; (6) the proxi ity (sämipya) of the secondary object [to the direct object], as in “a village on the Ganges” [where the bank of the river is close to the direct object, river]; (c) samaväya, that is, a connection:5 for example, “Bring in the spears,” meaning bring in the spearmen, [who are connected with the spears]; (d) opposition, as when one says with reference to an enemy, “In what has he not benefitted me?” ;6 (e) its being connected with the same activity, that is, when it is based on a relation of cause and effect: for example, “he takes away my life,” when the expression is used of one who takes away one’s food [here the direct object, life, is the effect of the secondary object, food]. In this way, Iaksanä occurs in all varieties.And thus, in your verse “On what mountain,” since an obstruction to the literal sense is introduced by the improbable questions [addressed to a parrot], Iaksanä, based on similarity, comes into play.[Abhinava:] But we admitted this, saying that Iaksanä occurred i the middle stage [between denotation and suggestion].[Mïmâmsaka:] Then how can your author say that “the type of dhvani where the literal is intended but is subordinated to a second meaning, [and many other varieties, do not fall in the area of Iaksanä]”?[Abhinava:] He was referring to the chief subtype [of this type of dhvani], viz., where a succession from literal to suggested meaning is not noticed. And by its many varieties he meant the suggestion of rusa, of bhäva, of improper rasa, of improper bhäva, or of the incipience or cessation of any of these;7 all this, as well as the subvarieties of each.8 And in every one of these, Iaksanä is impossible.9 The reason is that in a poem that sets forth the vibhävas and anubhävas there can be no hindrance to the primary meaning; so what chance is there for Iaksanä to arise?[M:] Let us forget about hindrance. The true definition of Iaksanä is this: “That is called Iaksanä where we have an apprehension of an[ § 1.18 L"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"191object invariably connected with the primary meaning.” 10 In the type of poetry here of which you are speaking, when the vibhävas, the anu- bhävas, etc., are the primary meanings [of the words], the rasas, etc., being invariably connected with them, will be indicated by laksanä, for the vibhävas and anvbhävas stand in a cause-effect relation to the rasas, while the vyabhicäribhävas stand in a relation of accompaniment. 11[A:] By no means. At this rate, whenever we apprehend the object smoke from the word “smoke,\" we would be reminded by laksanä of fire, and from that we would be reminded of the repelling of cold, and so on, until there would be no end to a word’s meanings.[M:] The word “smoke” finds a point of rest i its own literal so it will not go on operating any further.[A:] Here you have come around to our view, that it is a hindrance to the literal meaning that brings laksanä to life, for when such a hindrance occurs, the word does not rest in its literal meaning. And in the setting forth of the vibhävas, etc., there is no hindrance.[M:] Very well then, we may say that just as the memory of fire arises after one has understood the presence of smoke, so the apprehension of such mental states as sexual desire arises after the apprehension of the vibhävas, etc. There is no verbal operation here at all. 12[A:] This Mlmämsaka who knows so much about our apprehension13 should be asked this question. Do you suppose that the apprehension of rasa is nothing more than the apprehension of another person’s men­tal state? You should not make such an error. What aesthetic relish (rasatä) would there be in the mere inference of emotional states that are found in the everyday world? The relishing of rasa is a super­normal (alaukika) delight. It consists in savoring the vibhävas, etc., which are found in poetry, and it must not be degraded to the level of memory and inference, or the like. Rather, the connoisseur, whose mind has been trained by everyday inferences from effect to cause, when he apprehends the vibhävas, etc., does so not in an uninvolved manner (tätasthya) [in which everyday inferences eure achieved], but by bringing them into the power of his sensibility, or in other words, con­fronting them with sympathy, a process that forms the seedling for the full relishing of rasa about to ensue. The nature of his apprehension consists in a savoring of the vibhävas that springs from his identifying with them, a process that is entirely removed from the path of mem­ory and inference. This savoring has not been produced by some other means of knowledge in the past so that it might qualify as memory. 14 Nor is it produced now from any other means of knowledge, because§ 1.18 L ]"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"192perception and the other means do not operate in a super-normal ex­perience. That is why the terms vibhäva, [anub/iäva,] etc., are used, which are terms for the super-normal. 15 As [Bharata] says: “It is called a vibhäva because its purpose is to give understanding (vijnä) . ” 16 In dealing with normal experience we speak of a cause, not a vibhäva.17 Anubhäva also is a term for the super-normal. “The dramatic repre­sentation of voice, body, and emotional expression, since it per its us to experience (anubhävayati) [the represented mental states], is called anubhäva.\"18 By experiencing (anubhavana) is meant one’s identifica­tion with the mental states [so represented]. In dealing with normal experience we speak of an effect, not an anubhäva.19 And so, lest one suppose that [in the enjoyment of rasa] the mental state of another person is being inferred, Bharata omitted the word “basic emotion” (sthäyibhäva) from his definition: “Rasa is born from the combination of vibhävas, anubhävas, and vyabhicäribhävas.\"20 Had it been included it would have proved a stumbling block.The statement that a basic emotion turns into a rasa21 is based on suitability, that is, because the relishing of beauty arises in us from our memory bank (samskära) of mental states which are suitable to the vibhävas and anubhävas of those basic emotions [that are being portrayed in the characters of a literary work]; and because, while we are in the stage of understanding the mental state of another person, which may prove helpful to our sympathetic response, we understand such basic emotions as sexual desire from such [vibhävas] as a garden and such [anubhävas] as horripilation of the actor’s skin. The tran­sient emotion (ttyabhicäribhäva) is also a mental state [resident in the portrayed character], but since it is relished only as dependent on a principal mental state, [there is no danger in its being mentioned in the sûtra and so] it is listed along with the vibhävas and anubhävas.So what is born here is a rasyamänatä (a being tasted, a gustation, of beauty) , 22 that is, a savoring that eclipses such worldly mental states as the joy that might be produced by reunion with a constant stream of old friends. And for this reason, [viz., because of its super-normal character,] the savoring serves to manifest something, not to inform one of something, as might be done by an established means of knowledge (pramäna). It is not a production such as results from the working of a cause.[M:] But if it is not a cognition and is not produced, what is it?[A:] We have told you. It is the super-normal rasa.[ § 1.18 L"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"193[M:] But the vibhävas, etc.—axe they what inform us of it, or eure they productive of it?[A:] Neither informative nor productive; ing.[M:] Where else is such a thing found?[A:] The fact that there exists nothing else of this sort is why we have called it super-normal.[M:] But then roso will not be a valid means of knowledge.[A:] So be it. Since we receive pleasure and instruction from savori it, what else do you want?[M:] But still, there will be no way of knowing that it exists.[A:] Wrong. It is proved by our own self-awareness, because savoring is a form of knowledge.Enough arguing now. But one more reason why rasa is super-normal: namely, that soft and haxsh alliterations, while they have no effect on meaning, can be suggestive of rasa.23 What possibility of laksanâ can there be in such a case? One finds too that there can be relishing of the words of a poem by mulling them over, for we see a connoisseur reading the same poem over and over and savoring it. That the words of such a poem are unlike other words, which become useless after we have understood them according to the dictum, “One takes them up [as means] only to abandon them [after they have served their purpose],” 24 shows that such words must have a suggestive operation. And that is why the succession [of the suggestion to the primary meaning] passes unnoticed.It has been objected by a certain person that this theory of sugges­tion would result in väkyabheda (giving two different meanings to one sentence) , 25 but his objection is based on a misconception because [of the following consideration].A ritual text (sdstra) ,26 uttered once, conveys a meaning by means of semantic convention. As it is impossible for us to remember simul­taneously numerous contradictory conventions, the text cannot convey two meanings, while if the conventions are not contradictory, then ob­viously there will be just one sentence meaning. The sentence cannot convey contradictory meanings successively, because a semantic oper­ation cannot begin again after it has once ceased. If the sentence is uttered a second time, the meaning will be the same, because there has been no change in the semantic conventions or the context. If it could convey a second meaning, obliterating the meaning obtained by con­text and convention, there would be no semantic rules at all. At this§ 1.18 L )"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"194rate when we hear the words, “A man desirous of heaven must perform the fire oblation,” what assurance should we have that the meaning is not that a man must eat dog meat? 27 Nor would matters stop there. Language would become wholly unreliable. Accordingly, väkyabheda is there counted as a fault.But in poetry, the vibhâvas, etc., as they axe being conveyed to us, tend to become objects of our relish. There is no need then for semantic convention.28 There is nothing here comparable to the apprehensions we receive from a ritual text: “I am enjoined to do this; I will do it; I have accomplished my purpose,” since such a text, being on a normal plane,29 tends toward what one should do in the future. But in poetry, the savoring of the vibhâvas, etc., is essentially a matter of the present, arising like a magic flower, without reference to past or future. In this sense the relishing of rasa is different from normal relishing, as it is also different from a yogi’s meditation.And so it is that in the stanza \"On what mountain.” connoisseurs will sense the clever compliment which is the speaker’s intention without noticing the succession to a blocking of the primary meaning. That is the [true] reason why our author has stated as a general principle that there is no bhakti in that type of dhvani where the literal meaning is intended but is subordinated to a second meaning. It was we, seeking to persuade you when you were being obstinate, 30 who granted that laksanä might be found in the stanza, for it was our thought that no matter how angry you might be, you could say nothing against cases where no succession could be noticed. But if you will not be angry, we will point out that even in the stanza \"Three men reap the earth,” where the literal sense is not intended, regardless of the fact that all the conditions for laksanä, such as blocking of the primary meaning, are present, the sentence comes to rest in the suggested meaning. And so enough of this long discussion.Our author sums up: therefore associated m eaning [furnishes no definition). 11. In the text, kevalam construes with the words ity evam läksanikäd gunasya bhedah four lines below. 2. “Lion” is here used by secondary usage to mean a boy with the qualities of a lion. It is accompanied by the denotative word “boy,” with which it stands in grammatical agreement. In the relational variety, on the other hand, this accompanying use of the denotative word is not found. “A village on the Ganges” indicates a village on the river bank, but the denotative word “bank” is not used. 3. It is confusing to have the same word (laksanä) used in two different senses in the same sentence. To[ § 1.18 L"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"195make matters worse for the reader, the pronoun (aaj with which the next sentence begins must refer to the first, not the second sense. 4. Abhinava now specifies the five sorts, following the verse of Bhartrmitra which he quoted under 1.1 d L. But he here follows a different reading from that which he there gave: abhidheyena samyogât sâmïpyât samaväyatah in place of abhidheyena sàmîpyât särüpyät samaväyatah. See 1.1 d L, note 4. In effect the version given under 1.1 d L includes the gaunï variety, that being the variety based on särüpya, whereas the present version excludes it. The sense here given to samyoga is peculiar; in Nyäya a väcyaväcakasambandha is never referred to as samyoga. Furthermore, the illustration of the type based on samavâya implies a non-Nyâya sense of samavâya. But these facts cannot be used as arguments against the present version, for Bhartrmitra may have defined the words in other than their Nyäya-Vais ika senses. 5. Note that samavâya and samyoga are here glossed by the same general word. In its normal sense samavâya cannot be used of the relation between spears and the men who hold them. 6. This is a case of irony. The direct sense of the word “benefitted\" is the opposite of the secondary sense which the speaker intends. 7. For these varieties see 2.3 K and for examples, 2.3 L. 8. Rasadhvani may be divided into the eight, or according to some, nine, rasas. Even single rasas have their subvarieties; thus, sambhoga-srhgära and ripralambha-snïgâra. So also with the bhävas and rasäbhäsas, etc. 9. The text from this point, Kashi ed., p. 154, line 4. to p. 158, line 7, has been translated by Gnoli, Aesthetic Experience, pp. 102-106.10. The quotation, given inexactly, is from the Tantravârttika, p. 354. The original reads abhidheyavinäbhüte pravrttir laksanesyate, “the operation of a word on an object invariably connected with its direct meaning should be called laksanâ.' It is not a good definition, because the connection need ndt be invariable. 11. The vibhävas are the determinants of the rasas; they cause them to arise. The anvbhâvas result from the rasas (at least as rasa is understood by the Mîmâmsaka here speaking, viz., as a sharp­ened emotion). The vyabhicäribhävas accompany the rasas. 12. Here the Mîmâmsaka would reduce the achievement of rasa to an inference, the third valid means of knowledge. The fourth means, verbal apprehension, would play no part. 13. The words are ironic. Among poeticians the Vedic ritualists are stigmatized as the most insensitive of all men to poetic beauty and to the understanding of literature. 14. This is another distinction between rasa- pratiti and inference (anumäna). In inference the sight of smoke gives rise to a memory of fire which has been perceived in the past as accompanying smoke. 15. alaukika eva vyavahdra: that is, they refer to a super-normal means of apprehension. Abhinava returns to this idea in commenting on 2.4. The apprehension (pratiti) of rasa, he says there, is lokottararäpä; it tran­scends the experience of the workday world. The term alaukika had already been used by Nyäya and Buddhist epistemologists for types of perception that§ 1.18 L ]"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"196could not be explained by normal physical causes. 16. BhNÉ 7.3 (Vol. I, p. 346): atha vibhàva iti kasmät / ucyate, vibhävo vijnänärthah. 17. Here Abhinava is adding to the words of Bharata, who does not make this distinc­tion. He merely says, vibhävah käranam nimittam he tur iti paryäyäh (ibid.). 18. BhNÉ 7.4 (Vol. I, p. 347). Abhinava is following a Northern version of the text, closer to that given by MS 6a of the Gaekwad edition than to the text as it has been printed. 19. One may say that the determinant (vibhäva) is the cause of the mental state and the dramatic portrayal (anubhäva) is the result, so long as one remembers that these words are used not of an everyday mental state produced in the actor, but of the super-normal state produced in the audience.20. BhNÉ 6-31 (Vol. I, p. 272). 21. sthäyino bhävä rasatvam äpnxivanti,BhNÉ Vol. I, p. 288. 22. That is to say, the birth spoken of by Bharatais not of a physical thing called rasa, produced by everyday causes, but the birth of a super-normal enjoyment engendered by poetic means. Abhinava insists on the same distinction in his comment on 2.4. 23. Abhinava’s viewis more complex than this sentence seems to imply. See 3.33 b L, note 3. 24. Väkyapadiya 2.38. The dictum of course applies only to words that are denotative. That the words of poetry are different shows that they must have a different sort of power and operation. 25. The anonymous oppo­nent (Bhattanäyaka?) must have held MTmâmsâ views, for it is only in the MTmâmsâ that much is made of this fault. To the ritualists it was impor­tant to harmonize the many apparently discrepant statements in the Vedic texts. They did this by subordinating certain passages to others and so pro­ducing ekaväkyatä, “the state of a single sentence,” or, if many grammatically distinct sentences were involved, by forming a single mahäväkya, “great sen­tence,” i.e., a single consistent logical presentation. The grammarians, on the other hand, eager to make the text of Panini apply to as many linguis­tic situations as possible, often instruct us to make two statements out of his one (yogavibhäga or väkyabheda). One feels that Abhinava would have answered the present charge more simply and more truthfully by pointing out that in cases of dhvani the primary sense is always subordinate to the suggested sense, whereas in the alankäras, if there is a suggested sense, it is subordinated to the literal. In either case there is ekaväkyatä. Instead of this, he makes an elaborate distinction between sästra and poetry, which leads up to the claim that väkyabheda is a fault in the former but not in the latter. 26. The Kaumudï advises us to take éâstra in a broad sense, as referring to any text that is not literary. But the argument that follows, it seems to me, implies a very narrow sense. It is only a ritual or MTmâmsâ text that is “directed to what one should do in the future,” or that gives rise to such notions as “I am enjoined to do this,\" etc. 27. The words tenägnihotram kä pramä form a sloka. Gnoli (Udbhatas Vivarana, p. xxxi, note 1) has pointed out that it is a quotation from DharmakTrti’s Pramänavarttika, 1.318[ § 1.18 L"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"197(Manoratha ed. 3.318). 28. Kaumudi and BP make clear that the needfor semantic convention occurs in the stage of conveying the vibhävas, etc. In the next stage, where they suggest rasa, semantic convention plays no part. 29. As opposed to the supernormal plane of rasäsväda.30. Durdurütam: the word appears also in other forms in the MSS— dvandvarüdham, dadurutam, durdurabham. As I see no satisfactory etymol­ogy, I translate simply from context.§ 1.19 L ]K It might, however, be an adventitious mark (upalaksana) of a certain type .of dhvani. And if dhvani has been defined by others, our view would stand confirmed.A While bhakti might be considered an adventitious mark of one type out of the various types of dhvani that we shall describe, if one were to say that dhvani is fully characterized by secondary usage, one might say that all the figures of speech which differ from dhvani are characterized by the operation of denotation, a statement that would imply the futility of constructing definitions of the individual figures of speech.Even if dhvani had been defined by others previously, this would simply confirm our view, for our view is that there is such a thing as dhvani. If this has already been proved, we have gained our wish without effort.Those too who have said that the nature of dhvani is something sensed in the hearts of connoisseurs but incapable of being expressed, have spoken without reflection. For when the general definition has been given in the manner stated and the particular definitions in the manner about to be stated, if it were still held to be inexpressible, the same charge would apply to all things. On the other hand, if they mean this as a hyperbolical way of saying that its nature is superior to all other types of poetry, then they are speaking the truth.L Now our opponents may admit that dhvani and bhakti are not identical and also that bhakti does not fully define dhvani. But it"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"198does sometimes characterize it. As bhakti occurs in [some] areas where dhvani occurs, it serves as an upalaksana (adventitious characteristic) of dhvani. True enough, but it does not occur everywhere that dhvani occurs, so what do our opponents gain by this fact, or what do we lose? And so [the Kärikä] says, it m ight be of a certain type.And bhakti has been described by the ancient authors. Using it simply as an adventitious characteristic, we might be able to mark out dhvani and know it in all its varieties. What use is a [specific] definition? To dispel such a view, [the Vrtti] argues, if one were to say, etc. The relation of denoter and denoted is found in all areas where figures of speech are found. So, since the working of denotation has been described by the grammarians and the ritualists, where is there any need of work by definers of figures of speech? In the same way, by adopting the dictum of the logicians that the effect is born of the cause, we might ask what useful new accomplishment has ever been made by any creator or discoverer, beginning with God. 1 At this rate no one would ever undertake anything. Our author states this, saying [it] would im ply th e futility of co nstructing definitions.Let us suppose that we have not revealed anything new, that [the nature of dhvani] has already been revealed and we have merely de­scribed it correctly [by following precedent]. What harm would this do? With this in mind, our author says, even if, etc. Previously, that is, previous to our work.By thus refuting the three varieties of the view that dhvani does not exist, as also the view that it is included in bhakti, it follows that among false views the view that it is inexpressible has also been refuted.2 Accordingly, there is no Kärikä directly aimed at refuting this view. The author of the Vrtti, however, in order to make a neat presentation of the whole subject, brings up this implicitly refuted view and gives an explicit refutation: those too who have said, etc.Its general definition has been given in the manner stated, viz., “That [type of poetry] in which sense or word,\" etc. (1.13 K). The particular definitions will be given in the manner about to be stated, viz., “It may be shifted to a different meaning,” etc. (2.1 K). In regard to these [we may note that] in Chapter One the general definition of dhvani has been given by the author of the Kärikäs. In Chapter Two, the author of the Kärikäs gives definitions of the subtypes of dhvani and refers to the two main types as though they had already been given. In confor ity with this, the author of the Vrtti had stated the basic divisions already in this chapter, by saying, “and it is in general of two sorts” (1.13 m A).3[ § 1.19 L"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"199To all things: both everyday matters and scientific matters.

The argument of the Kärikä, explained in the preceding paragraph, was that bhakti cannot serve to define dhvani, that is, to rule out the application of the term udhvani\" from all instances of non-dhvani, because bhakti is present only in some instances of dhvani. The argument of the Vrtti, explained in this paragraph, is more general. Even if-a characteristic occurs throughout the area of the thing to be defined, it is of no use as a definition if it is too general. 2. The references are to the five false views set forth or implied in 1.1 K. 3. I suppose the reason for Abhinava’s again (see 1.13m L) bringing up this distinction between the exposition of the Kärikäs and the Vrtti at this point is to justify the curious discrepancy between the future tense of"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"200vaksyaminayi (“in the manner about to be stated”) and the past tense of pratipädite (“has been given”) in the present passage of the Vrtti. 4. The quotation forms the last line of the following stanza: nidrirdhanimilitadréo (or in some versions nidrinimïlitadrso) madamantharâyà nâpy arthavanti na ca yâni nirarthakäni / adyäpi me varatanor madhurini tasyäs täny aksarini hrdaye kim api dhvananti.With half closed eyes, lazy with wine, my lady spoke sweet syllables.They were neither meaningful nor yet unmeaning, but were such that even now they keep on sounding their ineffable message in my heart.Abhinava may well have taken the quotation from Kuntaka, who uses it in his Vakroktijwita (1.19, vs. 51) and says that the indefinite pronoun kim api conveys the fact that the excitement of the heart cannot be expressed but can only be experienced. The stanza is found as number 36 in the Kashmiri re­cension of Bilhana’s Caurapancisiki fed. W. Solf, Kiel, 1886) and is variously ascribed in anthologies to Bilhana (S irrig. 3468), Kalasa (SüktiM. 43.26), or Kalasaka (SubhÄ. 1280). As Bilhana was a contemporary of King Kalasa(ka) (regn. a.d. 1080-1088), the ascriptions must be wrong. Kuntaka lived a cen­tury or more earlier. 5. In the final slokas to the chapters of his Locana Abhinava renders homage to the powers or stages of Vic\\ at the end of the First Chapter, to the pari sakti-, of the Second, to the pasyanti sakti-, of the Third, to the madhyami sakti-, and of the Fourth, to the vaikhan sakti. That speech exists in four stages is a concept as old as Rigveda 1.164.45. We first meet with the traditional names of these stages in Bhartrhari; they are miss­ing in the Mahibhisya, although that work quotes the famous Rigvedic verse (Kielhorn ed. I, p. 3, lines 24-25). To Tantric authors like Abhinava the four saktis represent a double process of evolution: on the metaphysical plane, from undifferentiated unity through two intermediate stages to the sensible everyday world of diversity; on a linguistic plane, from the undifferentiated sabdabrahman, again through two intermediate stages, to the physically man­ifested speech by which worldly communication is carried on. For Abhinava’s description of these stages, see his Paryantapanciéiki, verses 41-48, or Jaya- ratha’s commentary on Tantriloka 1.18. Pratibhä (imagination, inspiration) is used, as well as cit (the self-conscious), as a name of Siva’s highest âakti in TA 1.2. It is a serviceable term in the present stanza, because the prati- bhi of a poet is the power which enables him to make use of dhvani for the achievement of rasa. Compare the verses with which Abhinava concludes the later chapters of the book. 6. Candriki: name of a commentary on the Dhvanyiloka that preceded Abhinava’s Locana.[ § 1.19 L"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"CHAPTER TW OA Thus it has been shown that dhvani is of two kinds:1 one where the literal meaning is not intended (avivaksitaväcya), the other where the literal meaning is subordinated to a second meaning (vivaksitänya- paraväcyay In this regard, the Kärikä makes a statement in order to show the subdivisions of the first kind.1. The word ''dhvani\" may be taken here in any of the last three senses listed in 1.1 K, note 1, viz., as suggestion, suggested meaning, or a suggestive type of poetry. Note that it is the Vrtti that has shown the distinction between the two main types of dhvani, not the Kârikàs. See 1.13 m A and 1.13 m L, note 1.L I praise the magic branch that bears the wished-for fruit,Sivä the generous;who, as we think of her, gives blessing and removes our grief.The author of the Vrtti, providing the logical connection between this (and the preceding] chapter, begins by saying thus, etc. Shown means: “by me, in my capacity as the author of the Vrtti. Nor in saying this1 did I depart from the intention2 of the basic text; rather, I followed the intention of the author of the Kärikäs.\" That is why he says what follows.3In this regard: that is, in regard to the statement of two kinds of suggestion made by the author of the Vrtti, this [Kärikä which now follows] is the seed (from which that statement sprang]. Or we may take tatra to mean “at that previous time.” The sense will then be: the author of the Vrtti showed previously, in the First Chapter, the201"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"202kind of suggestion where the literal sense is not intended.4 To show a difference (prabkeda), that is, a sub-type within that, the Kärikä now makes a statement. And by showing these sub-types it will be possible, by reference to them, to show [in the second Kärikä] the difference (prabheda) of [the first kind of suggestion] avivaksitaväcya, that is, the difference of its nature (prabhinnatva) from [the second type] vivaksitänyaparaväcya.5 Basically, the sense is that the author of the Kärikäs is in full agreement with the view that there are two kinds of suggestion.[ § 2.1 Introduction L1. “This” refers to the naming of the two varieties of dhvani in 1.13 m A.2. Utsütram means “beyond the scope or intention of the basic text,\" viz., the Kärikäs. The word is used in Sisupdla 2.112. 3. The meaning of Ânanda’ssecond sentence, on which Abhinava now comments, is perfectly clear. But Abhinava is not satisfied with the apparent sense, because the distinction of the two main types of suggestion has nowhere been stated in the Kärikäs, but only in the VrttL Accordingly, Abhinava tortures the sense in order to turn it into a statement by which the Vrttikära may justify himself. 4. We have emended the word prakäsitah to pra-kàsitasya. As the text stands, one can make sense of it only by the expedient of taking avivaksitaväcyasya yah prabhedah to mean avivaksitaväcyarüpo yah prabhedah, on the analogy of such phrases as rähoh sirah. 5. Thus Abhinava takes prabheda in two different senses. He thereby increases the implications of Ânanda’s statement.K In that type of suggestion where the literal meaning is not in­tended, it may be shifted (sankramita) to a different [associated] sense, or it may be entirely set aside (tiraskrta).A The suggested meaning likewise is distinguished (i.e., differ­entiated into two kinds) by virtue of the two mentioned varieties.1"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"2031. The point of this sentence is that one might question the propriety of the term väcya (literal sense) in a definition that should deal with the suggested sense (dhvani). The response is that the suggestion is also distin­guished by the very distinction that has been made in the väcya. The KM edition adds after the word visesa the following: iti vyangyaprakäsanaparasya dhvaner prakärah, apparently only in order to make clear what we have stated in this note. The extra words are not found in the recorded MSS and seem to have been missing from Abhinava’s text.§ 2.1 L)L The causative suffix in the past passive participle saiibramita1 denotes a group of conditions (sahakärivarga) ,2 and it is by their power that the sense is caused to shift in the suggestive operation. The word tiraskrta refers to the same agents. The connection is this: that literal meaning which, being unintended, gives to the form of suggestion called \"where the literal meaning is unintended-’ (avivaksitaväcya) its name, is twofold. (In the first variety,] that meaning which, although possible, is not as such of any use; which seems to have become something else because of its involvement with various properties; and which remains as an unnoticed3 property-possessor like the thread of a necklace, is said to be (shifted, i.e.,] developed into a different shape. That meaning, on the other hand, which is not possible in the context and which serves merely as a means to perceiving some other [suggested] sense, after which it runs away as it were, is said to be \"set aside.”Now it may be objected that we are supposed to be describing sub- varieties of dhvani. that is to say, the suggested sense. So surely it is inappropriate to speak of varieties of the literal sense. With this doubt in mind, our author says: th e suggested m eaning likewise. The word ca (likewise) is used in the sense of “because.” He means: Be­cause of variety in the suggestor [i.e., the vâcyârtha. the literal sense], we can appropriately speak of variety in the suggested sense [i.e., the distinctions of the suggested meaning depend on distinctions of the lit­eral meaning]. Or if we take the word dhvani to be used in the sense of suggestor [i.e., the literal sense, as explained in 1.1 K, note l],4 there will be no difficulty.Feeling that there is no need to give a definition since the defini­tion of this variety is furnished by its very name, the author [of the commentary] proceeds to give an example."},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"2041. saTikramita is the past passive particle of the causative verb: sam + kram + nie + it + kta. The suffix nie drops by Pan. 6.4.52, but not with­out denoting the causative agent. Abhinava identifies the agent, i.e., that which causes the shifting of the sense, as “the group of conditions” (saha- kârivarga). 2. The sahakärivarga is composed of the three conditions of laksanâ, namely mukhyârthabâdhâ, nimitta (i.e., sambandha), and prayojana- vattva. Both forms of avivaksitavâcya depend on laksanâ and thus on the conditions that bring laksanâ into play. Another name for avivaksitavâcya is laksanämüladhvani. 3. Against the interpretation of BP, I have taken laksyamânah to include a negative, i.e., as laksyamânah. Only thus does the passage make sense. Both the saiikramitavâcya and the thread of a necklace are unnoticed property-possessors. What are noticed are the meanings sug­gested by the vâcya and the flowers or gems strung on the necklace. 4. Abhi­nava has already explained several times in the first chapter, e.g., Text p. 31 (Translation 6 6), 99 (TV. 125), 105 (Tr. 132), 135 (Tr. 171), that one of the meanings of dhvani is vyanjaka, i.e., the vâcyârtha. The alternate interpreta­tion strikes me as impossible, for what is obviously at issue is the vyangyärtha. Moreover, the full name is avivaksitaväcyadhvani[ § 2.1 LA An example where the literal meaning is shifted (arthäntara- sankramitavâcya) is the following:White herons circle against dark clouds that paint the sky with their wet lustre.Winds carry the small rain.The peacocks, friends of the clouds, cry out with joy.Let all this be: my heart is hard;I am Rama and can bear it all.But Vaidehl, how will she live?Alas, my queen, alas, be brave!* 1In this verse the [suggestive] word [whose sense is shifted] is “Rama.” By this word we understand Rama as developed into various suggested qualities, not simply as the possessor of the name."},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"2051. The stanza is quoted anonymously by Mammata 4, vs. 112 (p. 188), Hemacandra AC, vs. 6 8, and SüktiM. 90.6. Jacobi pointed out (JRAS, 1898, p. 296) that it occurs as Mahänätaka 5.7 (the Eastern version of the Hanu- mannàtaka). The Western version lacks it. The quotation begins with a description of the rainy season, a time when lovers long to be together. The point in quoting the verse here is that the word Rama qualified by “hard­hearted” reminds one of, or rather suggests, many other qualities that are associated with Rima, namely his having undergone so many other hardships, such as the loss of his kingdom, his exile in the forest, etc. The beauties of the verse are explained by L below. One may point in addition, however, to the skill with which the stimulants of sight, touch, and hearing are combined in the first two lines (the first four lines of the translation).§ 2.1a L ]L Taking it for granted that the definitions are sufficiently indi­cated by the names of the types and their subtypes, our author proceeds to give an example. An exam ple w here th e literal m eaning is shifted: this phrase is syntactically joined with “As in this verse, the suggestive word is Rama.” Snigdha means “moist” because of its con­nection with water. Syâmala is the dark color commonly found among Southern women. Konti means brilliance. Lipta means covered; that is, the sky is covered by clouds of just such a brilliance. “Clouds that are vellad-baläkäk,\" that is, in which the herons, a species of white bird, are vellat: the word means “conspicuous” (vijrmbhamàna), sc., because of the contrast1 [of their white bodies with the black clouds], and “flying about” (calat), sc., because of their joy [at being with their friends, the clouds]. And so the sky is painful to look at [since it reminds one of days of love]. All the directions are also hard to bear. The use of the plural in “winds” shows that they blow from all directions; and by their releasing small drops of water it is sug­gested that they are blowing very gently [and thus linger over one’s body and make one all the more love-sick]. Well then, perhaps Rama should enter a cave somewhere and stay there for the duration of the rainy season. With this in mind, the poet says that the clouds have friends (or helpers) among whom are the peacocks2 who produce out of joy sweet sounds that resemble the sadja3 note and become reminders of that whole unbearable scene of the clouds. On their own as well, these sounds are quite unbearable. This is what is meant. In this way Rama, whose feeling of love in separation has been aroused by stim­ulating factors (uddïpanavibhàvas), knowing that these determinants of emotion (vibhävas) 4 will be shared [by Sita], since love is based on"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"206mutual feeling, from here on in the poem conjures up his beloved in his heart. First he reports on himself: “Let this be.” Drdham means “exceedingly.” The word “hard-hearted” (kathora-hrdaya) gives scope to the particular suggestion that is achieved through the word Rama and its literal sense,5 just as the word natabhitti in the verse that begins tad geham natabhitti (“That house with crumbling walls,” cf. 3.161 A). Otherwise how would the word Rama not suggest other mean­ings connected with other qualities, e.g., the fact that he was born in the family of Dasaratha, that he was the object of Kausalyä’s love, the deeds of his childhood, and the acquisition of Sita? Asmi means: “I am the self-same person [who has undergone all these sorrows].” Bhavisyati expresses action in general, so the meaning is: What will she do? It can also be taken in the sense that “her very being is im­possible\" [i.e., she will kill herself, or die of a broken heart]. In this way by a succession of memory, name [sc.. \"Vaidehf’], and specula­tion [sc., \"what will happen to her?”], he has conjured up his beloved from his heart into being present before him. To her, as her heart is about to break, he says with agitation, “Alas, my queen, alas, be brave!” The word “queen” suggests that fortitude will be the proper re­sponse.By this: that is, by the word Rama, the literal sense of which is not strictly useful here [to the idea intended). The suggestions of other properties, which suggestions form the purpose [for shifting from the literal to the secondary meaning] are endless; for example, his banish­ment from the kingdom, etc. And since these suggestions are countless, they cannot be conveyed [simultaneously] by means of the denotative function of words. Even if these innumerable suggested properties were to be conveyed (by denotation] one by one. since they will not be had in one single act of cognition, they will not be the source of a wondrous aesthetic experience and hence they will not give rise to great beauty. But if these properties are suggested, they will assume countless forms (him. kirn rûpam na sahate) because in the suggestion their separate­ness will not be clearly perceived. In this way they will become the source of a strikingly beautiful aesthetic pleasure that is analogous to the flavor of a wonderful drink, or cake, or sweet confection [where the individual ingredients cannot be separately tasted but yet add to the flavor of the final product]. For it has been said already that a word which is suggestive reveals a beauty “which cannot be conveyed by an­other form of expresion” (1.15 K). In all cases where the purpose [in a secondary usage] is to achieve a suggestion, this [viz., the simultaneity[ § 2.1a L"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"207of a number of suggestions] should be considered the cause of excel­lence. The word sim ply shows that the literal sense of the denoted object (sanjnin) is not wholly set aside.1. parabhâga: from the sense of emphasis, work done in relief, etc., pani- bhäga often comes to mean contrast, though that sense is not given by PW; cf. Ragh. 5.70, KirArj. 8.42. 2. Sobhanahrdaya is merely a literal glossof suhrd. 3. This is a poetic convention (cf. Ragh. 1.39 with Mallinätha thereon), just as the cuckoo is said to imitate the pancama. 4. Note that Abhinava mentions elements from rasadhvani, whereas Änanda has given the verse as an example of avivaksitaväcya. Abhinava mentions the terms vibhâva and vipralambha(srngâra). This is not, however, a departure from the view of the basic text. There is textual justification, but it will not come until Chapter Three. There, under 3.43, mention is made of all the possible com­binations of dhvani. gunibhûtavyangya, and vdcyâlankâras. In fact Änanda there mentions this verse as an example of the combination of different types of dhvani. 5. The idea is that “Rama” by itself might conjure up sugges­tions that are not meant. But the fact that the adjective kathorahrdaya is used lets us know that it is Rama’s character in the face of sufferings that is meant.§ 2.1b L]A Another example is found in my Visamabänalilä:Virtues blossomwhen admired by men of taste.When graced by the sun’s rays a lotus becomes a lotus.is example the suggestive word is “lotus” in its second occurrence. * 11. By “virtues” the verse no doubt refers to poetic beauties. They shine forth only under the eye of the connoisseur, just as the lotus opens its petals only in the sunlight. We have here a case of pure vastudhvani as opposed to the combination of vastudhvani and rasadhvani in the previous example.L A nother exam ple: tälä in Prakrit means “then,” and jälä “when.” 1 Gheppanti means “are taken [i.e., admired].” 2 He gives a cor­roborative statement in the line beginning with ravikirana."},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"T he suggestive word is “lotus” : he is speaking of the bearer of the name “lotus” as transformed into a hundred varieties by such properties as being the abode of the goddess of beauty, etc. [In both this and the previous example] there is blocking of the pure, literal sense [of the words “Rama” and “lotus”]. The cause [of adopting the secondary sense] is the inherence of those [secondary] qualities in the literal or primary sense. It is through this cause (viz., this connection or inherence) that the word “Rama” conveys by means of secondary usage (laksayati) a meaning that is transformed by other qualities. The sense that is suggested [and that forms the purpose of employ­ing the secondary usage] consists of still other qualities which are ex­traordinary and which are beyond the scope of words [i.e., beyond the scope of denotation]. The same holds true of the word “lotus.” 3 On the other hand, the word “virtues” (guna) denotes merely the bearer of its primary sense. The forced view taken by some that what we have here (sc., in “Rama” and “lotus”] is [simply] a metaphorical (or secondary) sense (äropita) is unconvincing, because wherever a pri­mary sense is blocked by its uselessness we are in the area of sug­gestion and the secondary sense is only that from which the sugges­tion arises.'*As for what the Hrdayadarpana says, that the aesthetic delight of the verse [of 2.1a] is occasioned by the distress (samrambha) that comes from the particles “alas, alas,” we must point out that even in this interpretation the suggestion of an aesthetic experience (rasadhvani) is admitted, because distress or agitation (ävega) is a transient emo­tion (vyabhicäribhäva) of the aesthetic experience of love in separation {vvpralambhaérngâTa). Furthermore, without the help of the meaning suggested by the word “Rama,” this distress would not blossom forth. For the emotion takes the form of “I can bear it, but what will happen to her?\" Moreover, in the case of the word “lotus” what agitation can there be? Enough arguing then.5As there is failure of the literal sense, that sense being useless,6 we have in these verses examples of something that is based on the sec­ondary meaning (laksanämüla) and that may rightly be called sugges­tion of the type where the literal sense is not intended (avivaksita- väcya), for in it there is no intention to express its direct meaning. But the literal sense in the form of property-possessor is not totally set aside, since it is carried along [in the sense of Rama, who is qualified by the loss of his kingdom, etc.]. Hence I have used the expression pannata. (developed or transformed)."},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"2091. See Hemacandra, Präkrtavyäkarana 8.3.65. 2. Ibid., 8.4.256.3. According to BP the laksyârtha of “Ràma” is Rama transformed by exile from his kingdom, etc. (räjyabhramsädiparinataräma) and the vyangyärthas are discouragement, weariness, etc. (nirvedaglänimohädi); of “lotus” the laks­yartha is laksmipätratvädiparinatakamala, the vyangyärthas are manoratha- tvädi. Abhinava is not so precise. 4. What Abhinava is objecting to is an interpretation that would rest satisfied with finding some single property of Rama or of the lotus as the final intention of the verses, this property be­ing arrived at by laksanä or äropa. Such an interpretation is far from being unreasonable and can be dismissed only by appeal to the general theory of suggestion. The theory demands that everywhere that we find mvkhyârtha- bädha together with a laksya sense that does not rest merely on rüdhi, there must be a suggestion. In the present examples the suggested sense, except that it is said to be multiple, does not differ very noticeably from the laksya sense. 5. Abhinava’s point is that the samrambha does not actually consist of the words ha hä hä. It consists in the fact that Rama thinks, “I can bear it, but she cannot.” Now this knowledge we cannot have without the use of the word “Rama” as a vyanjakasabda. He is not fair, however, in saying that Bhattanäyaka’s interpretation must admit rasadhvani in the stanza. Bhatta- näyaka admits that there is rasa in the stanza, but not dhvani. As though aware that he has pressed his criticism too far, Abhinava turns to an example where there is no rasa. And yet the process of our understanding “lotus” is the same as the process of our understanding “Rama.” 6. In the case of the first example “Rama” in its literal sense is useless to the idea of the capacity to endure those stimulating emotions (uddïpanavibhâvas) that are described in the stanza. In the case of the second example the second occurrence of the word “lotus” is useless in its literal sense, which would merely be a repetition Of the prior occurrence.§ 2.1 c A ]A An example of the second variety, where the primary meaning is entirely set aside (atyantatiraskrta) is a verse by the first of poets, Vâlmlki:The sun has stolen our affection for the moon, whose circle now is dull with frost and like a mirror blinded by breath shines no more. 1is example the suggestive word is “blinded.”"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"2101. The verse is Rämäyana 3.15.13, from Laksmana’s description of win­tertime. L is incorrect in assigning the words to Rama. Saubhägya means literally success in love. The moon, which is loved for its coolness in sum­mer. loses its hold on our affection in winter, when we turn to the sun for warmth. Compare Rämäyana 3.15.5 from the same description: subhago hatn/avähanah, “and fire has won our affection.” The point of quoting the verse is for its phrase “a blinded mirror,” which L will discuss in detail.[ § 2.1c AL By th e first of p o ets shows that [this kind of] suggestion is well known in literature. 1The sun has stolen: these are the words of Rama describing the winter when he was at Pancavatl. “Blind\" (andha) means one whose sight is destroyed, for even a person born blind has had his sight des stroyed in the womb. [When we say of someone:] “He is blind; he cannot see in front of him,” the meaning of the word “blind” is only partly set aside, not entirely. But to a mirror, such as we have here, blindness cannot be applied even by an imaginary superimposition of this literal sense [for a mirror, being insentient, has no sight which could be destroyed]. The word ‘‘blind” can apply to a mirror only in the secondary sense of “being incapable of making a clear representa­tion,” a sense occasioned by the presence of that incapability in a man who is literally blind. The purpose of using this word here is that it suggests numberless properties such as an exceptional loss of beauty, uselessness, etc.As for what Bhattanäyaka has said, that because of the use of the word “like” (iva) there is no secondary usage at all in this stanza,2 he said this without really thinking about the meaning of the stanza. For the word iva conveys the similarity between the moon and the mirror. The words “blinded by breath” qualify “mirror.” If, however, the word iva is connected with the literal sense of the word “blind” (andha), then we shall be left with the presentation (of an identity] “the moon a mirror.” This constuction of the word iva is harsh.3 To say that the word iva should be connected both with “blinded by breath” and with “mirror” 4 is not proper.

Abhinava’s argument is that we need the word iva to connect moon and mirror: candramâ àdarsa iva. If you borrow the word tua to express the fancy andha iva. you will be left with an awkward rùpaka: âdarsas candramâ. The only solution would be to take the word tua twice (ävrttyä), as the grammar­ians and the Mlmämsakas sometimes do; the exegetical technique is known as tantra; see 2.4 L, note 12. Abhinava then repels such a solution. 4. In nihévàsàndha iva, iva would serve as utpreksäväcaka (a word expressing the fancy). In àdarsa iva it would serve as aupamyaväcaka (a word expressing the simile).§ 2.1 d L]A In the following verse the suggestive words are “drunken” (matta) and “pride” (ahaiikära).Though the sky is filled with drunken clouds and the woods with arjvnas thrashing in the downpour, these black nights too when the moon has lost its pride cany off my heart. 11. This Prakrit verse is Gaudavaho 406. It describes a monsoon night, dear because of its associations of marital intimacy. The arjuna is a grey- barked tree with leaves of immense size. It is probably on their account that it is singled out for thrashing in the monsoon storm.L “T hough th e sky,” etc. [L follows this by a Sanskrit trans­lation of the Prakrit verse; then continues:] The word ca should be understood in the sense of api (even).1 Even when the sky is full of drunken clouds [it carries off my heart], not only when it is full of stars. So also the woods when their arjuna trees are thrashing in torrents of rain, not only when they are filled with mango blossoms shaken by the breeze from the Malaya moutains. Even these black nights when the moon has lost all pride carry off [my heart], not only nights that are whitened by the rays of the moon. “Carry off” means that they pro­duce longing. The word “drunken” in its primary sense is impossible in"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"212the context. As its sense of “a person who has become intoxicated by the use of wine” is blocked, it applies to the clouds through a metaphor­ical extension to other properties common [to an intoxicated man] and so suggests thousands of properties, such as irrational conduct, unruly behavior, etc. The phrase ‘without pride” is also applied by secondary usage. In applying to the moon it suggests the subservience, the lack of luster, the lack of will to rise up and overcome, etc., of one who has literally lost his pride.21. The literal rendering of the verse is: “And it be filled with drunken clouds,\" etc. This use of “and” for “although” is found in Latin and Shake­spearean English as well as Sanskrit. 2. The literal sense of “pride” can apply only to a sentient being. In the compound tatpäratantrya, tat refers to nirahahkära.[ § 2.1 d LK The soul of dhvani,l where the literal meaning is intended (vivaksitäbhidheya), has two varieties: one where the suggested mean­ing is produced without apparent sequence (alaksyakrama) [i.e., im­mediately, together with the primary meaning], the other where the sequence is apparent.1. Dhvaner ätmä is a somewhat ambiguous phrase. One might translate the present Kärikä as ‘The nature of dhvani has two varieties,” and this is the way Abhinava takes it. But in 2.3 K, A and in 2.11 A, 2.17 K, A, and 3.16 A, the term seems to mean dhvani par excellence, the very soul of dhvani. In all these passages the term refers to the suggested sense in vivaksi- tänyaparaväcyadhvani. For this eleven-syllable title, which will not fit into Moka meter, the Kärikä substitutes the abbreviation vivaksitäbhidheya. As L will point out, the portion anyapara (subordinate to another sense) can be supplied from the context.A The nature (or very self, ätman) of dhvani is a suggested sense which takes precedence over the literal sense. 1 It has been divided into two varieties: one where the suggestion appears without a perceived sequence between the literal and the suggested meanings, the other where a sequence is apparent.2"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"2131. That is to say, when the literal sense is subordinate to the suggested sense (anyapara = vyangyapara). 2. First we perceive the literal sense; then, after a momentary interval, the suggested sense dawns on us. There is of course a krama even in asamlaksyakrama, but it is so swift that we no more notice it than we notice the succession of punctures when a needle pierces a pile of lotus petals.§ 2.3 Introduction A ]L When the “different nature” (prabhinnatva; see 2.1 Intro. L) was mentioned of that type of suggestion where the literal meaning is unintended, from what was it meant to be different? For a thing cannot be different from itself. With this point in mind, he says that that type is different from the type where the literal sense is intended; for “in­tended” and “not intended” contradict one another. So the Kärikä says “imperceptible, etc.” The word asamlaksyakramoddyota is a bahuvrîhi compound and means “that of which the revelation, i.e., the process of revelation, is such that its sequence in time cannot be well perceived.” The fact that the literal sense is subordinated to something else ( anya­para), although not expressly stated [in the Kärikä], is implied by the expression vivaksitäbhidheya ( “where the literal meaning is intended” ) because of the proximity of this expression to the word dhvani.1O f dhvanii i.e., of the suggested sense. T h e n atu re (ä tm a n): In the previous Kärikä the varieties of suggested sense were distinguished on the basis of the literal sense. Now the present varieties are distin­guished solely within the suggested sense itself, the distinction being based on the process by which the suggestion operates.2 But what se­quence can there be within the process of suggestion itself? He tells us: a sequence with respect to the literal sense. The literal sense will here be the vibhävas, etc.1. The word dhvani used in the Kärikä implies that the väcyärtha leads up to the suggested sense; in other words, that it is anyapara. 2. The divi­sion in vivaksitänyaparaväcyadhvani is based on the iryanjanavyäpära, whereas in avivaksitaväcyadhvani the basis of division was the väcyärtha."},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"[ § 2.3 KK A rasa, bkâva, rasäbhäsa, bhäväbhäsa, bhävaprasänti,1 etc., appearing as a predominant element and [so] constituting the soul of dhvani, are assigned to the non-sequential type.21. For these technical terms see Introduction, pp. 17-20, 37, and Abhi- nava’s remarks on this section and on 2.4 and its various subdivisions. For bhävadhvani Abhinava invents a wholly new meaning. 2. This is the nat­ural interpretation, with ätman having its full value and vyavasthita having its normal meaning of “assigned, distributed.” L's interpretation is slightly different.A For the suggested sense, such as a rasa, etc., is apprehended nearly at the same time as we apprehend the literal meaning. When it predominates, that is the soul of suggestion.L O f these: among the two. Only that meaning which is of the form of rasa, etc., constitutes the variety of suggestion that is non­sequential. But this is not to say that such a meaning is always non­sequential. For sometimes we find that rasa does involve a sequence. When it does, we have a variety of arthasaktyudbhavänusvänarüpa- dhvani (suggestion similar to the resonance of a bell, a suggestion based on the power of meaning), as will be stated later in the text. The word ätmä, which means literally one’s own nature ( svabhävavacana), here conveys the idea of “variety” (prakära). Hence a [suggested] sense such as rasa, etc., is called the nonsequential variety of dhvani. What is meant is that i it the sequence [from the literal to the suggested sense] is not perceived.Are rasa, etc., invariably a variety of dhvani? He says no, only when they are revealed as the predominant element, that is, as of major imporance [in the poem]. Although at the time of giving the general definition [of dhvani in Chapter One, Kärikä 13], this was explained by using the phrase “to which all other elements are subordinated”(gunïkrtasvârthau), it is here repeated in order to give occasion for the"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"215discussion of rasavat (that which contains rasa in a subordinated po­sition) and other figures of speech [in Kârikâ 2.5]. And these elements such as rasa are distributed (vyavasthita, i.e., are everywhere present in poetry), for without them there is no such thing as poetry. 1Although it is through rasa that all poetry lives and despite the fact that rasa is essentially an undifferentiated mass of aesthetic delight, it may still give rise to am extra degree of aesthetic pleasure through the agency of some particular element which acts as its cause. In such cases, when some particular transient state of mind (vyabhicärin) reaches a high pitch and gives rise to exceptional aesthetic delight, we have what is called bhävadhvani.2 An example is [ Vikramorvasïya 4.9]:Can she be angryand using her magic to remain invisi But she was never angry for long.Has she flown off to heaven?But she loves me deeply in her heart.Even the demons could not steal her from me when I was with her.Yet now she has utterly disappeared.What turn of fate is this?Although the rasa of love in separation is present throughout this ex­ample, the exceptional pleasure is occasioned by the striking effect of the transient state of mind known as “speculation” (vitarka).Transient emotions have three states: inception, stasis, and cessation. As has been said,3 “ Vyabhicärins are so called because in bringing [the nwas] before us they act in diverse ways.”Sometimes the emotion is presented in the stage of inception. For example:The slender damsel heard him when in bed address her by another woman’s name.She thought of turning away— decided to try to do so—had almost done it, loosening one graceful arm— but could not lift her bosom from her lover’s breast.4In this stanza the words “could not” show that the state of jealous anger is arrested in incipience, since they deny its full emergence; and on this depends the aesthetic enjoyment of the verse.The stasis [of a vyabhicäribhäva, in this case speculation or doubt] has been illustrated just above in the verse “Can she be angry?”§ 2.3 L ]"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"Sometimes it is the cessation of a transient state that occasions the aesthetic delight. This was illustrated earlier in the verse ‘They lay upon the bed” 5 and is called bhävaprasama (the cessation of an emo­tion). In the verse in question we might also speak of the cessation of a rasa, viz., of love in separation due to jealous anger.6Sometimes, again, the cause of aesthetic relish is the coming together of two transient emotions.7 For example:He who has kissed a face beautified by jealousy has known the bliss of drinking nectar.8In this example, in which anger is directly expressed, the man who kisses the face of his beloved as she weeps softly, sobbing with anger, is said to have known the satisfaction of swallowing successive drafts of nectar.9 The cause of the aesthetic delight is thus a mixture [of the directly expressed] anger and [the suggested] reconciliation.Sometimes it is the mixture of different vyabhicärins that is the object of [aesthetic] satisfaction. For example:How can a king of the Lunar Dynasty do a forbidden deed?May I see her once again!I have learned the scriptures in order to abstain from sin.Even in anger her face was lovely.What will the wise and sinless say?One could not find her even in a dream.My heart, come to your senses!But what blessed man will drink her lower lip?10In this stanza the states of mind arranged in pairs are mutually contra­dictory: compunction and longing, intellectual thought and memory, doubt and despair, firmness and anxiety. Yet since the last state is anxiety, the preceding states confer importance on anxiety alone and thus [by being mixed together] they give rise to the highest aesthetic pleasure. In like manner other [examples] may be supplied. All of these: incipience, conjuncture, mixture, etc., are intended by the use of the term etcetera (ädi) in the Kärikä.It might be objected that in like manner great aesthetic delight is conveyed through the vibhâvas and anubhävas, and so we should speak also of vibhävadhvani and anubhävadhvani. But no. For both vibhâvas and anubhâvas are conveyed directly by denotation [and not by sug­gestion]. And the aesthetic delight arising from them terminates in216 [ § 2-3 L"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"217[certain] states of mind (cittavrtti, namely the sthäyibhävas) alone; so there is nothing to be aesthetically enjoyed in them apart from rasa and bhäva [to whose aesthetic enjoyment they lead]. But there is nothing wrong with saying that when the vibhäva and anubhäva are suggested, they are cases of vastudhvani.uNow when false love (ratyäbhäsa, literally \"the appearance of love”) arises out of a false vibhäva, the enjoyment is false because of the falsity of the vibhäva and hence is known as rasäbhäsa, “false or improper aes­thetic enjoyment.” An example is the srngäräbhäsa (the false aesthetic feeling of love) that arises when we listen to the poem of Rävana. 12 Al­though Bharata has said that “the imitation of the erotic {srngära) is comic (Aösya) ,” 13 the feeling of its being comic arises only at a later time. In the verseI merely heard her nameand it acted as a magnet or a maddening charm.Since that day my heart has knownno moment’s rest without her.there is no occasion for relishing comedy. Now someone will object, “In this verse love is not the basic emotion (sthäyibhäva), for it lacks the bond of mutual affection.” But who ever said that there was love here? Rather, we have here a case of false love (ratyäbhäsa, the appearance of love). And it is false precisely because it never occurs to the heart [of Rävana] that Sita might be indifferent to him or even hostile. For if this were to occur to him, his desire would disappear. And even if he thinks that she is in love with \"him, that thought gives no assurance, 14 for he is infatuated with passion. Accordingly, the love is established to be in reality spurious, just as the silver which one cognizes in a piece of mother-of-pearl is spurious. But Bharata himself indicated as much when he used the term drngäränukrti (imitation of the erotic), for anukrti, amukhyatä, and äbhäsa are all synonyms. Therefore when writers use the word srngära in situations where the love is one-sided, it should be understood in the sense of an imitation {äbhäsa) of real srngära. The word srngära [in Bharata’s phrase srngäränukrtir yas tu so häsyah] implies further the possibility of imitation (or falsity, äbhäsa) of the heroic and other rasas.Thus, bhävadhvani, etc., are the outflow of rasadhvani. [In setting up these categories] we merely single out one major cause of aesthetic delight and consider it separately, just as connoisseurs of scent, even when they enjoy the unified flavor of a perfume, are able to say that the§ 2.3 L]"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"218sweetness comes from the nard, 15 or some other element, alone. But Taaadhvani is par excellence the intense relish occasioned by the audi­ence’s (pratipattuh) tasting of the basic emotional element when their understanding of this basic emotion has arisen from the combination of the vibhävas, anubhävas, and vyabhicäribhävas. For example:My eyes with difficulty pass her thighs to wander long in the land about her hips; then at her waist, uneven with the triple fold, become quite powerless to move.But now at last, like travelers parched by thirst they’ve climbed the mountains of her breasts and see at last what they had hoped, their counterparts, her eyes, that flow with tears. 18In this example, from the King of Vatsa's looking at the painting [of two figures] which is honored by his own portrait and which he is describing [to his friend] because of the portrait of the heroine, [we know that] the sthâyibhâva of love is in that state where it is mutually shared. This sthäyibhäva, by means of the combination of vibhävas and anubhävas, has reached a point where it can be aesthetically enjoyed. So enough of this long discussion. It is now established that a meaning in the form of rasa, etc., when it appears as the major element [in a work of literature] is a variety of that kind of dhvani known as asamlaksyakramavyahgya.N early a t th e sam e tim e: the word “nearly” (iva) shows that although there is a sequence, it is not perceptible. As we apprehend th e literal sense: viz., the vibhävas, anubhävas, etc. 11. Abhinava’s literal interpretation of the Kärikä is: rasa, bhäva, etc., when appearing as predominant, constitute the variety of suggestion that can appear without perceived sequence, a variety that is widely distributed [in poetry]. 2. Presumably Abhinava understands this term as an elliptical compound meaning “suggestion of [a rasa brought about by] a striking vyabhi- cäribhäva.” 3. The quotation is from BhNÉ Book 7 (Vol. 1, p. 355), where the MSS disagree on the text. The editors have chosen the reading vivi- dham äbhimukhyena rasesu carantiti vyabhicärinah.

It is not from the Vikramorvasiya as many commentators on Mammata have said. BP says that it represents the words of King Yayäti, who has fallen in love with the brahmin girl Devayänl despite the restrictions of the laws of caste. The verse is later quoted by Änanda (3.20 a A below) as an example of the introduction of elements from an obstructive rasa (here sänta) in order by stopping short to magnify the rasa intended (here srngira). Com­punction, intelligence, doubt, and firmness are vyabhicäribhävas of säntarasa. Longing, memory, despair, and anxiety are xn/abhicärins of love in separa­tion. 11.

The. figure of speech rasavat was known to the older poeticians. Dandin says merely that it was a figure charming with rasa (2.275). Bhämaha says little more: “The figure rasavat is such that the rasas srrigdra, etc., are clearly exhibited therein” (3.6). Udbhata brings into his definition the formative factors of rasa as given in BhNS: “The figure rasavat is where the rise of a rasa such as érngdra is clearly exhibited. It is a locus of rasa, sthdyibhdva, sancdrin (= vyabhicärin), vibhäva, and dramatic portrayal” (4.3 Induräja ="},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"2204.4 Vivrti). For Änanda to establish his system, in which the aim of poetry is roso achieved by means of dhvani, it was necessary to distinguish this roso- dhvani from the old figure of speech. See Introduction, pp. 23-24. He proceeds to do so here by assigning rasadhvani to cases where the rasa is predominant and limiting the figure of speech to cases where the rasa is subordinate or ornamental.[ § 2.4 Introduction AK Wherever the varied word, meaning, and their causes of beauty are subordinated to rasa, etc., this is considered the domain of dhvani.A Wherever the words together with the alaiikäras (ornaments, figures) of sound, the meanings together with the figures of meaning, and the qualities (gunas), all variously arranged so as to be kept distinct from suggestion, subordinate themselves to the main suggested sense which consists of rasa, bhâva, rasâbhâsa, bhâvâbhâsa, or bhävaprasänti, one may apply the term dhvani to that poem.L Kärikä 2.3 spoke of rasa, etc,, “appearing as predominant elements.” It may therefore be asked if rasa, etc., can ever appear as subordinate elements so that it should be necessary to qualify them [as predominant] in order to rule out [their subordination in dhvani]. By way of answer the [the Vrtti] proceeds to say, Now, etc. His thought is that there is subordination of rasa, etc., when they assume the form of the figures of speech known as rasavat, prey as,1 ürjasvin,2 and samä- hita.3 His turn of phrase indicates that rasadhvani, bhävadhvani, etc., are not included within the figures of speech rasavat, etc. [i.e., the provinces of the two are different], for [in the same way,] it was earlier shown that vastudhvani is not subsumed under the figures of speech samäsokti, etc. [cf. 1:13 c]'.The expression used in Kärikä 2.4, väcyaväcakacärutvahetu (words, meanings, and their causes of beauty), is a dvandva compound mean­ing “the literal sense, the denoting word, and their causes of beauty.” In the Vrtti [the expression sabdärthälankärä] is also a dvandva com­pound meaning “words together with figures of speech based on sound;"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"221and meanings together with figures of speech based on meanings.” Is considered: i.e., has already been said [by us in 1.13).But now,4 Bhattanäyaka has said: “If rasa were perceived (pratiyate) as belonging to someone else, the spectator would remain indifferent. Nor can rasa, which stems from a poem dealing with a subject like the life and deeds of Rama, be perceived as belonging to oneself. For if it were perceived as belonging to oneself, we should have to admit that there was a physical production (utpatti) of rasa within oneself. And such a physical production would be inappropriate coming from Sita, for she cannot serve as an [objective] determinant (älambana- mbhâva) to the spectator.5 Should it be argued that a certain universal “belovedness” (käntätva) causes her to become such a determinant (to the spectator] in the sense of causing a flowering of his latent impres­sions (väsanä),6 we may ask how such a process could be possible in the case of the description of gods, etc. Nor can it be said that dur­ing a dramatic performance there is [on the part of the spectator] a recollection of his own beloved. And how can a (stimulative] determi­nant (uddipanambhäva) such as building a bridge over the ocean by an extraordinary hero like Rama ever become generalized [since nobody else could ever do it]? Nor can it be said that Rama, as full of heroic energy (utsäha), is remembered,7 for he has never formed part of our past experience. Again, to perceive Rama’s energy through a verbal source of knowledge is not to experience raso,8 just as when we watch a couple making love there is no experience of raso.9 And if we accept that rasas have a physical origin (utpatti), the spectator would be so 'pained by his [physical] sorrow (karuna, i.e., soka) that he would never return to watch a tragic (karuna) performance. Therefore there is no physical production. Neither is there a manifestation, 10 for if the erotic rasa were a power [located within him) that is manifested, the spectar tor would make ever greater efforts to obtain those objects [which bring about the manifestation] .11 And if you hold that raso is manifested [we must ask the same question as before]: Is rosa in the spectator himself, or in someone else? The same difficulties arise now as arose before. Therefore raso is not perceived (pratiyate), nor physically produced (utpadyate), nor manifested (abhivyajyate) by a poem. Rather, poetic words are of an altogether different nature from ordinary words, thanks to their threefold operation. Their denotative power (abhidhâyakatva) operates within the limits of the literal meaning; their aesthetic efficacy (bhävakatva) operates in the area of the rasas, etc. [i.e., it transforms the vibhâvas, etc., into raso]; and their efficacy of aesthetic enjoyment§ 2.4 L]"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"222(bhogakrttva) operates within the sensitive audience. The working of a poem consists of these three operations. If one were to claim that in poetry denotation alone held sway, then what would differentiate slesa (artistic double meaning) and other figures of speech from such devices as the forcible taking of a word in two senses (tantra) , 12 etc., in scientific works? Moreover, the varieties of alliteration would be virtually useless. And what purpose would be served by the avoidance of such faults as indelicacy of sound (srutidusta)?13 Therefore there is a second operation known as the efficacy (bhävanä) of rasa (i.e., the ability to create rasa), thanks to which denotation assumes a new dimension. A poem’s having the efficacy (bhävakatva) to create rasas is nothing more than a poem’s power of making the vibhâvas, etc., universal. Once a rasa has been thus realized, 14 its enjoyment (bhoga) (is possible], an enjoyment which is different torn the apprehensions derived from memory or direct experience and which takes the form of melting, expansion, and radiance. 15 This enjoyment is like the bliss that comes from realizing (one’s identity] with the highest Brahman, 16 for it consists of repose in the bliss which is the true nature of one’s own self, a nature which is basically sattva but is intermingled with the diversity of rajas and tamas.17 It is this aesthetic pleasure (bhoga) alone that is the major element (i.e., the purpose of poetry] and it is something already (eternally] accomplished (siddharüpa) . 18 Any instruction that poetry may furnish is incidental.” 19On this subject we may make the following remarks. To begin with, there are different opinions among the critics on the very nature of rasa. Some, for example [Lollata], say that what is a stable emotion (sthäyibhäva) in a former state, being nourished by the addition of the transient states of mind (vyabhicârins), etc., just that much, as belonging to the character portrayed (anukärya), is rasa. The rasas (are not located in the actor or audience of a drama. However, they] are called “dramatic” rasas (nätyarasäh) because they are used in drama.(Against this view it may be said20 that] a state of mind (cittavrtti) is something that underlies a series of properties [i.e., is really a trend of mind],21 so what can it mean to say that one state of mind is nourished by another state of mind? Wonder, grief, anger, etc., are not gradu­ally augmented; [on the contrary, they diminish with time] .22 Therefore there is no rasa in the character being portrayed. [On the other hand] if rasa were to lie in the actor, he would be unable to follow the tempo (laya) , 23 etc. Again, if one were to say that rasa lies in the specta­tor, how could there be delight? On the contrary, in tragic (karuna)[ § 2.4 L"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"223performances the spectator would experience only pain. Therefore the above theory will not do. What will do? As states of mind are endless [chains], it is impossible to imitate them exactly. Moreover it would be useless to do so because if we did perceive the exact state, we should derive nothing from it, because we should be indifferent [as the state would belong to someone else].Therefore24 rasa is an apprehension (pratipatti) of a stable emotion whose nature is not exactly fixed. It results from the addition of the vibhâvas, anubhâvas, and vyabkicârins and takes the form a of relishing (äsväda) different from memory because there is a direct object (go- cam) of its perception of the sthäyin, e.g., “This Rama [standing before me as represented by the actor] is happy.” 25 This apprehension of rasa depends on the actor and is found only in plays. It requires no other basis. But the actor must be thought to be26 the character portrayed in order for the audience to enjoy the experience. Only this much27 and nothing more is required for the aesthetic experience of the rasa. Therefore, rasa exists only in the drama and not in the characters to be portrayed, etc. This is the view of some.Others28 say: The appearance (or semblance, avabhâsa) of a stable emotion in the actor, which has been brought about by a set of causes such as dramatic representation, etc., is like the semblance of a horse drawn on a wall by means of yellow and other pigments. When it is relished by an act of perception, known otherwise as a relishing (äsväda) because it is beyond ordinary experience, it is called raso. And so the expression nâtyarasâh is to be explained as nâtyâd ras äh, i.e., rasas arising from drama.Others, however, say: The vibhâvas and anubhâvas are presented to the spectator with the help of particular dramatic equipment (visista- sâmagri = acting, music, dialogue) so as to engage the latent impres­sions of the spectator that underlie that mental state which forms the stable emotion that is sought to be produced by these mbhâvas and that is brought within view by these anubhâvas.29 The vibhâvas and anubhâvas when accompanied by this relishing of bliss within the self are the rasa. [That is to say,] these vibhâvas and anubhâvas themselves are the rasa and the term nâtyarasâh means the rasas which are the drama.Still others say30 that rasa is the vibhâva alone, others that it is the anubhâva alone, and some that it is the sthâyibhâva alone, some that it is the vyabhicâribhâva, still others that the combination of these four is rasa. Some say that rasa is the character being portrayed. Others§ 2.4 L]"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"say that rasa is the conglomeration of these five elements. But enough on this score.Another point is that the occurrence of rasa in poetry is wholly analogous to its occurrence in drama.31 Where drama makes use of re­alistic style (lokadharmi) and theatrical style (nâtyadharmï),32 poetry uses the styles of direct expression (svabhâvokti) and artificial expres­sion (vakrokti).33 In both cases rasa is produced in these styles by the combination of extraordinary34 vibhâvas, anubhâvas, and vyabhicârins presented in language that is clear, sweet, and forceful.35 Granted that the perception of the rasas in poetry is distinct in nature from that experienced in drama, because the means differ whereby it is brought about, still, the same scheme (sarani) holds for both forms of art.36Having arrived at this point, [we can see that Bhattanäyaka’s] criti­cism, pointing to the impossibility of a rasa’s residing in the spectator or in someone else, applies only to the first view [that we described after Bhattanäyaka’s].37 But in all the views [that followed Bhatta- näyaka’sj the unavoidable fact remains that rasa is perceived. For if it were not perceived, we could have no dealings with it, just as we can have no dealings with a goblin.38 However, just as we have sen­sory, inferential, verbal, intuitional, and yogic perception, all of which are undifferentiated so far as being perceptions, but each of which is distinct because of differences in its means of production, just so may we have this other type of perception that is called tasting (carvanâ), relish (äsväda), enjoyment (bhoga), [which is distinct from other types of perception,] because its basic components, namely the vibhâvas, etc., helped by sympathetic response (hrdayasamväda), etc., transcend [the experience of] the workaday world. To say that “rasas are perceived” is a turn of phrase as when we say “he is cooking the rice pudding,” for the rasa consists in the being perceived [of the vibhâvas, etc.].39 Relishing (rasanâ) is a special kind of perception. This perception [of rasa] in drama is distinct from every-day cases of inference, although it depends on inference in the initial stages [since one first infers, from the vibhâvas, etc., the stable emotion that is being portrayed]. Simi­larly, in poetry the perception of rasa is different from other kinds of verbal cognition [abhidhâ, laksanâ, tâtparya), but in the initial stages it depends on direct denotation (abhidhâ) as a means [of reaching the suggested sense].Accordingly, the case (of Bhattanäyaka] against us is destroyed be­cause it never really had occasion to arise.40 Again, it is a rash state­ment indeed to say that the extraordinary deeds of Rama do not win a224 [ § 2.4 L"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"225sympathetic response from everybody. For minds are characterized by a great variety of latent impressions (väsanä). As has been said: “La­tent impressions are endless because desire is eternal.” and “Though separated by birth, place and time, the latent impressions are unin­terrupted because of the correspondence of impressions and memory” [i.e., though several lives intervene, impressions still give rise to the old reactions].41Therefore it is now established that there is perception of rasa. More­over, this perception in the form of aesthetic relishing is physically produced (utpadyate). And the verbal operation in bringing about this perception is the hinting (dhvanana), the suggesting (vyanjana), of the literal sense and denotative words, which is an operation different from abhidhä and laksanâ. (What Bhattanäyaka calls] the poem’s operation of causing aesthetic enjoyment (bhogikarana) of the rasas is nothing other than thé operation of suggestiveness. As for aesthetic efficacy (bhävakatva), this too is nothing more than what is included in the use of appropriate qualities (gunas) and figures of speech, a subject of which we shall speak in some detail (later in this chapter]. What is new about all this? And when you say that poetry is effective (bhävaka) of rasas, you have revived through your aesthetic efficacy the theory of physical production (utpatti) [which you had hoped to destroy].42 Again, one cannot say that in poetry the words alone are effective of nua,43 for if their meaning is unknown, no rasa can arise. Nor can one say that it is the meaning alone, for if the same meaning is ex­pressed in other words, rasa does not arise.44 We explained that both word and meaning were effective when we said, “In which a sense or word suggest that suggested meaning, etc.” [1.13 K\\. Accordingly, with the operation known as suggestiveness serving as means and with the qualities, figures of speech, and propriety, etc., serving as procedure (itikartavyatâ), poetry, which is effective (bhävaka) [of rasas], effects (bhâvayati) the rasas; and in this three-termed scheme of efficacy (bhä- vanâ as understood by the Mlmämsakas) suggestiveness fits in as the means.45Again, aesthetic enjoyment (bhoga) is not produced by the words of poetry [i.e., the power of aesthetic enjoyment (bhogakrttva) is not a third function of poetic words, as BN would have it]. Aesthetic enjoyment, which is a melting, expansion and radiance,46 otherwise known as relishing (àsvâda), comes about rather from the cessation of that obscuration [of the true nature of the self] which is caused by the thick darkness of ignorance. In bringing this cessation to its§ 2.4 L]"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"226superlative degree it is suggestiveness that should be given the place of honor. When rasa has been achieved by means of suggestion, this power of aesthetic enjoyment inevitably follows. For enjoyment is nothing other than the incomparable thrill of delight that arises from tasting the rasa. But it is wrong to think that the varieties of relishing are fully enumerated by melting, expansion, and radiance, because there are innumerable possible variations on account of the endless variety [of human character] created by the varying degrees of predominance among the components of character, sattva, rajas, and tamas. We admit [with Bhattanäyaka] that the relishing of rasa bears a family resemblance to the relishing of the ultimate brahman. (We further admit that] the educative effect ( vyutpâdana) [of poetry] is different from that which comes from scripture through its mandates and from history through its narrations.47 For in addition to the analogy which it furnishes that we should behave like Rama [and not like Rävana], it produces in the final result an expansion of one’s imagination which serves as the means of tasting the rasas. With this view we find no fault.Accordingly, it is established that rasas are suggested and that they are enjoyed by their very perception. Now this suggestion can be either primary [i.e., the rasa that is suggested can be the primary sense of the sentence or stanza] or secondary. If it is primary, it is a case of dhvani. If not [i.e., if the suggested rasa is only secondary], it is a case of a figure of speech such as rasavat, etc. This is what he now says in: th e m ain suggested sense, etc. K ept distinct: viz., because of their having been determined to be distinct by the reasoning already employed [in 1.13a and following passages]. 1[ § 2.4 L1. Prey as: name of a figure of speech also known as preyasvin (3.34 L) and preyolaiikära (1.4 a A, et passim). Dandin and Bhämaha give no definition, but their comon example (Dandin 2.276, Bhämaha 3.5) seems to show that they understood the figure to be a form of complimentary address. L on2.5 ascribes to Bhämaha the view that “preyolankâra is a loving description addressed to a god, a king, or a son.' See 2.5 a L, and note 2. 2. ürjasvin:an expression of pride or egoism, Dandin 2.275, Bhämaha 3.7.

In Dandin (2.298) and Bhämaha (3.10) samähita is the description of a happy coincidence. Udbhata completely changed the definition and brought it into connection with rasa: “A passage concerned with the cessation of raso, bhâva. or their improper"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"227varieties, in such a way that there is no trace of a new anubhäva is called samähita” (4.7 Induräja = 4.14 Vivrti). 4. Abbinava now takes up the question of the nature and genesis of rasa. The question involves him in a long criticism of the views of his predecessors. For the views of Bhattanâyaka and for the meaning of his technical terms bhävanä, bhävakatva, and bhävita, see the remarks in the Introduction, pp. 35-36. The passage 2.4 L from this point on has been translated in an appendix by Raniero Gnoli, The Aesthetic Experience according to Abhinavagupta, 2nd. ed., Chowkhamba, 1968. In the same book Gnoli also translates the longer version of the same argument found in the Abh., Voi. 1, 2nd. ed., pp. 272ff. 5. BN means that Sita is a vib-häva only with respect to Rama, not to the spectator. This holds, of course, only so long as raso is regarded as a physically produced, perceptible, emo­tion. If rasa is admitted to be imaginatively achieved (bhävita rather than utpädita), BN presumably would admit what Abhinava and all later critics hold, that Sita is a vibhäva with respect to the spectator’s rasa. 6. väsanä: literally, the perfuming of the self by its former experiences, including those of preious lives; hence, the latent impressions of the mind, which give it a proclivity to particular tastes and sympathies. 7. Energy (utsäha) is the sthäyibhäva that underlies the rasa of heroism (virya). But how can Rama’s energy produce any such rasa in us? We cannot remember it, for the defini­tion of memory in Indian philosophy involves direct experience (anubhava).8. The expanded version of this passage in ABh., Voi. 1, p. 278 (Gnoli p. 10) reads: na ca sabdänumänädibhyas tatpratïtau (where tat refers to utsähädi- sthäyibhäva) lokasya sarasatä yuktä pratyaksäd iva. The point is that these various forms of perception lead only to information (jnäna), not to rasa, which must be experienced through some other pram&na, viz., through the bhävanä of poetry. 9. Abhinava in ABh., Voi. 1, p. 278 (Gnoli p. 10) expands the analogy of watching a couple making love by adding: pmtyvta lajjäjugupsäsprhädisvocitacittavrttyantarodayavyagratayä kä sarasatvakathäpi syät, “On the contrary, because one becomes preoccupied with one’s own re­spective emotional reactions such as embarrassment, disgust, or even sexual desire, we cannot say that this is an aesthetic experience at all.\" Abhinava makes the same point in ABh., Voi. 1, p. 35. See also DR 4.39 and Avaloka thereon.10. BN’s distinction of utpatti and abhivyakti is presumably the common distinction in Indian philosophy. Utpatti is the origin of an entity that was pre­viously non-existent . Thus the Naiyäyika says that when a jar is made, there is utpatti of the jar. Abhivyakti is the transformation into sensible form of what was formerly imperceptible although existent. When ajar is in a dark room, it is manifested by the light of a lamp. It seems unlikely in view of what follows that BN is using abhivyakti in Abhinava’s more restricted sense, namely, the manifestation of a suggestion by verbal means. 11. The basic argument against abhivyakti is omitted, presumably as being obvious. BP supplies it:§ 2.4 L )"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"228there can be no manif tation of rasa in the spectator because he had no rasa in the first place, that is, prior to his experience of the play or the poem. The argument against abhivyakti that is expressed is an argument against someone who supposes that the rasa might indeed be present in the form of the specta­tor’s latent emotions. These might be roused into manifested, sensible, form by the vibhävas. But then, the hypothesiser should push his analogy further. When we are looking for a treasure in a dark room, we want more than to be told about a lamp. We want to take the lamp in hand. Spectators would rise from their seats and try to carry Sita away with them. See DR 4.39 and Ava- loka thereon: itaresäm asüyänarägäpahärecchädayah prasajytran. 12. This meaning of tantra is not found in PW. It occurs in Vämana, KAS 4.3.7, in Padmapäda’s Pancapädikä, Madras ed., p. 37, line 4, and elsewhere. BP ex­emplifies the technique of fanfra by an old interpretation of Pan. 1.3.3. The sûtra reads hai antyam, apparently meaning “the final consonant (of a tech­nical term of grammar is an exponential marker].” But we cannot know that the expression “hai\" means a consonant until we are told that its is an exponential marker. So Kätyäyana ( Vari. 5) recommended taking the word hai in two ways, that is, by tantra, as (1) the l of “hai\" (here hai is a tatpurusa compound] and as (2) hai (= all the consonants from h to the exponential marker l). The sûtra then means: ‘The / of hai is an exponential marker and all the consonants from h to the exponential marker l are used as exponential markers when final in a technical term of grammar.\" This is how to make a computer bank, not poetry. 13. srutidusta: see 2.11 below. The term goes back to Bhämaha 1.47. 14. bhävite ca rast: the notion of universalizationis not present in the term bhävita itself but derives from BN’s explanation of how the realization or creation (bhävanä) comes about. 15. Druti, vi- stara, and vikäsa. We can point to no technical use of these terms earlier than BN, but they occur frequently in later texts. Dhanika on DR 4.43 assigns expansion (vistano) to the enjoyment of the heroic, and radiance (vinósa) to the enjoyment of the erotic. Melting (druti) would naturally be connected with the rasa of compassion and with love in separation: see 2.8 K below. But BP, on the authority of the Kävyaprakäsasanketa of Râjànaka Ruyyaka, identifies the three forms of enjoyment with the three respective components of the enjoyer: rajas, tamos, and sattva. On those terms as connected with the rasas, see Gnoli, p. 46, and Raghavan, Bhoja, pp. 467ff. 16. BN seemsto have thought that aesthetic bliss was actually superior to yogic bliss; cf. the quotation of BN in 1.6 L. Abhinava in 3.43 b L sems to reverse this value judgment. 17. Abhinava’s summary is so condensed that it almost misses the point. FYom Mammata 4.28, prose following verse quotation 26 (page 90), it appears that BN conceived of the bliss of poetic enjoyment as bringing about a predominance (udreka) of the basic goodness (sattva) of the soul over its adscititious elements of passion (rajas) and brutishness (tamas). For an account of the relation of BN's views to the Sämkhya. see M. Hiriyanna’s[ § 2.4 L"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"229article “Indian Aesthetics\" in Proceedings and Transactions of the First Ori­ental Conference, Poona, 1922, pp. 246-247 and Raghavan, Bhoja, pp. 466ff. 18. Siddharüpa: The term and its implications are taken from Vedanta phi­losophy. Sankara argues that knowledge of Brahman cannot be learned or produced or manifested or developed in any way, for knowledge of Brahman is Brahman, which is not a sâdhya (that which is to be produced) but a siddha. Brahman and Brahman-knowledge are eternally present, the appear­ances to the contrary being due to illusion. Just so Bhattanäyaka would take aesthetic enjoyment to be an eternal mode of being, which is not produced or manifested. In the last analysis he puts the relation between the aesthetic ef­ficacy of the poem and the self-realization of the audience outside the relation of cause-effect which applies to the phenomenal world. It would be the same relation as that between the Upanishads and knowledge of Brahman. Abhi- nava in what follows will obj t to this high-fiying mysticism. 19. Abhinava himself adopts this view at 1.1 e L. But cf. 3.10-14 f L. The view is not held by earlier authors of known date, but may be found in the Visnudharmottara Puräna 15.2.20. BP, followed by Jagannäth Päthak in the Chowkhambä edition, as­signs the following criticism to Srisankuka. 21. The point seems to be that a pure sthäyibhäva such as grief or anger is never found so that we could speak of its being nourished by the transient emotions (vyabhicârins). What we find is a complex mental state (cittavrtti), composed at any one time of a sthäyibhäva and vyabhicârins, this complex flowing forth like a river until it loses itself with the passage of time. 22. This passage has been expanded in ABL, Voi. l; p. 272: sokasya prathamam tivratvam kälät tu mändyadarsanam. A mental state becomes itensified or weakened because of external objective stiinulants and not because of other mental states like the vyabhicäribhävas. 23. BP takes laya differently: layo näma nrttagitavädyänäm ekatänarüpam sämyam. But we feel that the normal sense which the word laya has in music fits the context better. 24. BP identifies the following view as svamata: “his own view,” meaning thereby the view of Sankuka, whose objections have just been recorded. Jagannäth Päthak also supposes that SriSankuka’s re­marks are here continued. The identification seems to me probable but not quite certain. The seeing of the actor as -ayam Rämah sukht\" occurs in the account of Sankuka’s view given in Abh., Vol. I, p. 273, and if nothing is here said about inference (see note 26 below), the same is the case with the account in Abh. The only occasion of doubt is that the analogy of the painted horse, which Mammata attributes to Srisankuka. occurs not in this view but in the view which follows. 25. ayam rämah sukhi is explained by BP, p. 185, as rämo 'yam sitävisayakaratimän. 26. Nothing is here said about inference. Apparently Srisankuka claimed that the spectator infers the identity of char­acter and actor. It is this hypothesis of inference that brings the sharpest criticism on Sankuka in other texts. 27. adah means idam, as often in L.§ 2.4 L]"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"230See Text, p. 160, line 5; p. 239, line 3; p. 258, line 9. 28. It is difficult toidentify the person who held this opi ion. According to Mammata, line 8 of prose following 4.28 (page 8 8), the painted horse analogy (citraturaganyäya) belongs to Sankuka. 29. This is a difficult passage. Tadvibhävaniya means vibhävavibhävaniya: “the sthäyibhäva that is sought to be produced by those vtbhävas.\" Tadanubhâvaniya means anubhâvânubhâvaniya: “the sthäyibhäva which is intended to be brought within the purview of the spectators by means of those anubhävas.” Visistasämagryä samarpyamänam means abhi- nayädisämagryä sämäjikänäm purastäd upasthäpyamänam.30. For the theories mentioned in this paragraph see Raghavan, Bhoja, p. 437. As he points out, Jagannätha Pandita also refers to such theories. 31. The preceding views, except for Bhattanäyaka’s and perhaps those men­tioned in the last paragraph, were developed by commentators on the Nätya- sästra and apply strictly only to the theater. Abhinava now makes it clear that a theory of rasa must apply to poetry as well as drama. 32. On loka- dharmi and nätyadharmi see the long article by V. Raghavan, JOR 7 (1933), pp. 359-375 and JOR 8 (1934), pp. 57-74. Lokadharmi refers to everything in the drama that is realistic, nätyadharmi to those artificial conventions that are peculiar to the theater, such as asides that nobody else can hear, mono­logues, talking animals, gods on the stage. In the thirteenth chapter of the Nätyasästra (Vol. 2, beginning p. 214) Bharata gives a long list of the charac­teristics of each type. One may note an interesting verse that Abhinava quotes from his teacher on this passage. The verse reads as follows: yad aträsti na taträsya kaver varnanam arhati / yan näsambhavi latra syàt sambhavy atra tu dharmatah / / “Not everything that is in the world deserves to be described by the poet in his plays. And what is not possible in the world may oc­cur in plays quite properly.” In ABh., Voi. 1, p. 269, Abhinava again voices his opposition to strict realism. 33. These are parallel terms, svabhävokti corresponding to lokadharmi and vakrokti to nätyadharmi. Thus Abhinava is using the terms in their widest sense. The basic distinction is made by Bhämaha 1.30 and by Dandin 2.363; see also Udbhata 3.8-9 ( Vivrti). The most valuable discussion of svabhävokti is found in the first chapter of Kun- taka’s Vakroktijivita, but his use of terms is peculiar. For Kuntaka vakrokti is almost what dhvani is for Änanda. See the valuable article of V. Raghavan, “History of Svabhävokti” in Some Concepts. See also 4.7 A, note 1. 34. BPtakes the word-stem alavkika to modify sabda: “presented in a language that is more than normally clear, sweet, and forceful.” But the vibhävas are called lokottararüpa on the very next page (Text, p. 187, line 5), so they are probably the recipients of the synonymous epithet here. The intention, I suppose, is that the characters and emotional situations of a work of art are in themselves more striking than those that we know from the workaday world. 35. pra- sanna, madhura. ojasvin: these are the iabdagvnas mentioned by Bhämaha, Dandin, and Vämana. Änandavardhana completely altered the older teaching[ § 2.4 L"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"231by bringing them under the system of rasas. For him the gunas are the properties of the rasas; see 2.7 below. Instead of the ten gunas mentioned by the older writers, Änanda accepts only the three mentioned here. 36. The difference in perception (pratiti) results from the difference in presentation (upasthäpana), the play being presented to the sight and the poem to the ear. But the constituents of rasa in the form of the vibhävas, etc., are the same in both. Furthermore, the same scheme of natural and artificial is found in both. 37. I.e., Lollata’s view, because Lollata belongs to the utpattipaksa. He held that the rasas are physically produced. Others held that they were manifested or relished. 38. The insistance that rasa is perceived is directed against Bhattanäyaka, who said, just above, that it was not. But Bhatta- näyaka would not on that account have admitted that rasa was nonexistent like a goblin. Obviously he meant that perception (pratiti) is too physical a concept to express the manner in which rasa is experienced. So Abhinava goes on to give “perception\" a wider area of application. 39. Although we say odanam pacati: “he is cooking the rice pudding,” a more accurate description would be tandulän pacati, “he is cooking the rice grains,” because the pudding is the result of the activity while the grains are the object on which the activity works. Similarly, instead of the phrase rasâh pratïyante “the nuas are perceived,\" we would be more accurate to say vibhävädi pratïyante “the vibhävas, etc., are perceived,” for the vibhävas, etc., form the object of our perception; the rasa is the result. Or one may even say that the rasa is the process of perceiving itself. This qualification of his term perception leaves very little distance between Abhinava’s view and that of Bhattanäyaka.40. There is a similar passage in ABh., Voi. 1, p. 277, which Gnoli misunderstood: tatra pfirvapakso 'yam bhattalollatapaksänabhyupagamäd eva näbhyupagata iti taddüsanam anutthänopahatam eva, ‘This pürvapaksa [viz., the view of Bhattanäyaka that has just been set forth] is unacceptable because we do not accept the view of Bhattalollata. [If we did accept Lollata’s view of the physical production of rasa, the view called utpattipaksa, then Bhatta­näyaka would have a good argument against us; but we do not.] So the criticisms made by the pürvapaksa are destroyed, never having had a chance to arise. 41. Yogasûtra 4.10 and 4.9. In ABh., Vol 1, p 282, Abhinava has an interesting passage where he claims that the nine sthäyibhävas are present in all human beings, although some predominate in certain people and oth­ers in others. He ends by saying: na hy etac cittavrttiväsanäsünyah pram bhavati. In the course of our beginningless journey through this universe we have experienced all emotions. Thus nobody fully aware of his own humanity can fail to be moved by another person’s experiences. Again, on p. 283 Abhi­nava quotes a line from the Yogabhäsya of Vyäsa (2.4): na hi caitra ekasyäm striyäm rakta ity anyäsu viraktah, “the fact that Caitra is in love with one woman does not mean that he is out of love with others.\" This is not meant humorously, but is intended to show that beneath the particular emotions§ 2.4 L]"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"232which we manifest there lies a latent capability of many others. 42. This is a practical man’s argument against a mystic. What else than cause and effect can Bhattanäyaka be speaking of when he says bhävite ca rase “once a rasa has been realized\"? The identical argument is used against âankara by the ritualists and by Bhäskara: we are not in moksa now; if we get there, some­thing must produce the change. See note 18 above. 43. Abhinava’s point is that BN said that there are three functions of words; he made no mention of the part played by meanings in producing rasa. This seems to be unfair of Abhinava, as he too says over and over that vyahjana is a éabdavyâpàm. Why criticise Bhattanäyaka for an imprecision of terminology of which Abhinava is equally guilty? 44. Cf. what Änanda says on 3.16 m. 45. Abhinava here reduces Bhattanäyaka’s term bhävanä to the technical sense given it by the Mïmâmsâ. In the Mïmâmsâ bhävanä is an efficacy residing within the verb of a Vedic sentence which explains how that verb can bring an actor to pursue a given aim by certain means and procedures. For example, we are given the sentence jyotistomena svargakämo yajeta “one who is desirous of heaven should sacrifice with a jyotistoma sacrifice.” In the verb yajeta “one should sacrifice” there is said to reside bhävanä (we may here overlook the refinement of Kumärila who speaks of two sorts of bhävanä). This bhävanä is connected with three terms or factors: (1) a sädhya, an objective aimed at by the action, (2) a sädhana or karana, the means leading to that objective, and (3) an itikartavyatä, a procedure to be followed in reaching the objec­tive. These terms answer the questions: “What does it effect (Jfcim bhävayet)? With what does it effect it (kena bhävayet)? How does it effect it (katham bhävayet)?\" In the case of the sentence “one who is desirous of heaven should sacrifice with a jyotistoma sacrifice,” heaven is the sädhya, the jyotistoma is the sädhana, and the performance of the minor sacrifices prayäja, anuyäja, etc., is the itikartavyatä. Abhinava now argues that in poetry or drama rasa (or rasäsväda) is the sädhya, dhvanana or vyanjanavyäpära is the sädhana, and gunälahkäravcityädi is the itikartavyatä. By reducing Bhattanäyaka’s term bhävanä to its position in the Mïmâmsâ paradigm, Abhinava claims that it implies nothing more than is already furnished by his own theory. It is Abhinava’s “suggestion” (dhvanana) which is the sädhana by which rasäsväda is achieved. 46. A few lines farther on Abhinava will refuse to limit aes­thetic enjoyment to this threefold description (melting, expansion, radiance). He is here simply using Bhattanäyaka’s description to show that even under Bhattanäyaka’s definition aesthetic enjoyment should not be regarded as a power of words. It is rather a state of the audience that coines about after the words and meanings have produced rasa. 47. This admission falls a good bit short of BN’s view. BN had said. “Any instruction that poetry may furnish is incidental.” Abhinava admits that enjoyment is the main goal and that the instruction of poetry is different from the instruction of other types of literature. But the instruction given by poetry is not without importance[ § 2.4 L"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"233to him. It has a moral value. Furthermore, inasmuch as it trains us to experience aesthetic bliss, it may even be said to be spiritually instructive. In this way Abhinava is able to make enjoyment and instruction come to much the same thing. In commenting on 3.14 he will say: na caite pritivyvtpattx bhinnaripe evo, dvayor apy ekavisayatvät.§ 2.5 L)K But where a rasa, or the like, is subordinate and the main purport of the sentence lies elsewhere, then it is my opinion that in that poem the rasa, or the like, is only a figure of speech.A Although others have defined the domain of the figure of speech known as rasavat, nonetheless my own position is this: if in a poem some other sense is principally conveyed and is the main pur­port of the sentence, to which purport a rasa, or the like [e.g., bhâva, rasâbhâsa, etc.] is subordinated, then the rasa, or the like, comes under the domain of a figure of speech.L {Commentary on K \\ Lies elsew here: that is, in a rasa or something like a rasa, or in a mere fact, or in something peculiarly fit to form a figure of speech. M y opinion: This shows that the author holds back other views as being faulty and is first giving his own view as being worthy of acceptance.[Commentary on A:] Nonetheless: for the province [of the figures of rasavat, etc.] as propounded by others is not reasonable, as will be shown later [in Änanda’s comment on this Kârikâ], If in a poem : to clarify this loosely constructed sentence, it should be interpreted as follows: In that poem in which a rasa, or the like, as already men­tioned, is subordinated, and some other sense is the main purport of the sentence—understanding the word “and” in\" the sense of “but”— that rasa, or the like, which though subordinated is yet connected with the poem, 1 should be considered as falling within the province of the rasädi figures of speech, called by the terms rasavat, etc.2 The upshot of this is that a rasa, or the like, deserves the name of a figure of speech only when it is subordinate, not when it is otherwise."},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"2341. Thus Abhinava takes the word tasya in tasya cângabhüta (Text p. 191, line 4) as construing with yasmin kâvye rather than with väkyärthibhütasya.2. The rasädi figures of speech are preyas, rtuavat, ûrjasvin, and samähita.[ § 2.5 LA As an example of this, in passages of flattery, even though a figure of complimentary address (preyolankâra) is the main purport of the sentence, a rasa, or the like, may be found as subordinate. 11. This sentence presents a difficulty. It seems to speak of an alan­kâra as forming the väkyärtha (the main purport of a sentence), which is an impossibility, for an ornament (alankâra) must ornament the purport; it cannot be that purport. Abhinava will offer three solutions of the difficulty.L He gives an example for this statement: A s an exam ple of this. “This” refers to subordination. His meaning is: as in the example about to be given, so in other places also.If we follow the doctrine of Bhämaha,1 we will take the passage câtusu drsyate all as one sentence, meaning: “even though preyolankâra is the main purport, [as it is] in passages of flattery, a rasa or the like may be found to form a part”; for Bhämaha has said, “preyolan­kâra is a loving description addressed to an elder, a god, a king, or a son.” 2 In this interpretation, the word preyolankâra [in A will be a bahuvrihi compound and so] will mean: “that [passage] in which a very dear person (preyân) is an ornament.” 3 Such a preyolankâra can be ornamented. It will not do to take the main purport itself to be an oranment (alankâra).Or, we may take “the main purport” to mean simply the most im­portant element of the sentence, that is to say, the element that is most strikingly beautiful.Or, we may follow the doctrine of Udbhata and split the sentence in two. [First we will read] câtusu vâkyârthatve preyolankârasyâpi visayah, taking câtusu vâkyârthatve as locative absolute (visayasaptami), [trans­posing the word api,} and supplying the word visaya from the previ­ous sentence. This will mean: “where flattery is the main purport of"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"235the sentence, there is scope also for preyolankâra.” For according to Udbhata any bhäva* can be called a preyas, for affection (preman) is used to cover all the bhävas. The sense of the word api is that not only is there scope for the figure rasavadalankära, but for the figures preyaa, etc., too. By the word rosavat and the word preyas all the (four) alan- käras beginning with rasavat are included. This is just what he says in that [portion of the split sentence] which now follows: rasâdayo ’hga- bhûtâ drsyante, to which we must supply uktavisaye: “the rasas, etc., when subordinate, are found to have the same scope.”1. So also, just below, “or if we follow the doctrine of Udbhata.\" One must not translate, “According to the opinion of Bhämaha ... the sentence is to be taken as one,” for it is out of the question that such early authors could have seen and commented on the words of Änanda. 2. The text of Bhämaha as we now have it says no such thing, although the example of preyolankâra that Bhämaha furnishes at 3.5 does not disagree with such a definition. The absence of the quotation in Bhämaha has already been noticed by Kane, HSP, p. 82. But we cannot explain the absence, as Kane was inclined to do, by impugning our present MS of Bhämaha’s verses, for the quotation is not in verse but prose. Possibly Bhämaha wrote a vrtti on his verses which is now lost, but if so one would expect other quotations from it to survive. Nearly the same words as in the present quotation occur in Räjänaka Tilaka’s Vi .ti on Udbhata 4.2: ratir iha devagaranrpâdivisayâ grhyate, kântâvisayâyâs ta rateh ancone rosavadalankâre vaksyate. 3. Just such a meaning is given to preyas by Induräja in his comment on Udbhata 4.2 (p. 51, line 27): preyah- Jabdaväcyena priyatarena ratyäiambanena vibhävena. 4. For bhâvâlankâra, we must read bhâvâ and omit alankära. See Udbhata 4.2. * So§ 2.5 b A ]A This use of rasa, or the like, as a figure of speech can be either pure or mixed.

And thus in si ilar cases it is clear that other sentiments can be subordinated.1. The verse occurs also in SubhA., 2570. Its author is unknown. I have followed Abhinava in the interpretation of riktabâhuvaiaya. Another possible interpretation would be to take valaya not as a metaphor but simply in the sense of bracelet. The women's arms would be devoid of bracelets, as they are now widows. A and L speak of only two instances of dhvani in the verse: the suggestion of karunarasa, which is subordinate and which is therefore a case of the rasavat figure, and a vastudhvani, viz., the glory of the victorious king (nrpatiprabhâva), which is predominant. In commenting on similar stanzas commentators sometimes speak of the vastudhvani as leading to a third type of suggestion, namely the poet's love of the glorious king (nrpativisayarati- bhâva); ci. 2.5 d L, note 1.L P u re means that there is no mixture with another subordi­nated rasa, or with any other figure of speech.

This explains the “empty circle of their arms” later in the verse. It is only natural to scold a lover who is received back; so she says, “Pitiless man, what is this ... that drove you.” She means that she never nagged him even when he called her by another woman’s name. “In their dreams” refers to their talking in their sleep.2 “Dreams” : the plural shows that this happens again and again. This is what the wives of your enemies say, that is, the wives of the kings hostile to you,3 while their arms encircle the necks, that is, are tightly entwined about the necks of their beloveds. Just as they are in that condition, they awake to find the noose of their arms turned into a vacant circle, at which they cry aloud, with full throat.

Here compassion unmixed [with any other rasa or alankära] forms the figure of speech.

So what objection can there be to our using a rasa, like any other ob­ject, as an ornament (alankära)?6 But tell us, an objector may say, in precisely what manner the matter in hand (prakrtärtha)1 is beautified by rasa. Well,’ [we might ask him the same sort of question:] just how would it be beautified by a simile? If he says that the matter in hand would be compared to something else by the simile, we can say the same of rasa: the matter is made more tasteful (sarasikriyate) by the rasa. This is obvious. Therefore, what some have asked in the form of an objection, namely, “Just what among the vibkävas, etc., can be beautified by a rasa?” is answered by our not accepting the premise.8 For it has already been stated that it is the matter in hand that is beautified'.He now shows that this [subordination of rasa to the main purport] is dften found in literature: and thus.

It is a pity that Abhinava does not really explain here, or at 3.20 c, d L, which deals with the same subject, how the relish of compassion makes the main purport of such verses more beautiful. To judge from what follows, the problem troubled him. Most readers will agree that the stanza is beautiful. In HOS 44, pp. 372-373, I have spoken of the cruelty of such verses, but also of “their strong poetic effect.” But it is hard to explain the effect without admiting that the compas­sion is really more important in such verses than the glory of their nameless kings. 5.

We do not accept the fact that the vibhävas, etc., are beautified by rasa. The vibhäva9, etc., are the means for achieving rasa. What is beautified by the rasa in the figure rasavat is the matter in hand or the main purport of the sentence.[ § 2.5 b LA An example of mixed rasa, or the like, when it is subordiThe women of the Triple City wept from lotus eyesas Sambhu’s arrow-flame embraced them;but still, though shaken off, the fire caught their hands,though struck, did pluck their garments’ hem,denied, it seized their hair, and, scornedlike lover who has lately loved another, lay before their feet.May this same fire bum away your sins.1 Here the [flavor of love in] separation due to jealous anger (ïrsyâ- vipralambhasrngâra]) together with the ambiguities (slesas)7 is sub­ordinate to the main purport of the verse, which is the extraordinary power of the enemy of the Triple City [i.e., Siva]. It is in such an area that the figures of speech like rasavat, etc. properly belong. That is why there is nothing wrong in including two [usually contradictory] rasas, namely, compassion (karuna) and love in separation, in one stanza, pre­cisely because they are both subordinate. For when rasa is the main purport of the sentence, how can it be a figure of speech? Everyone knows that a figure of speech is meant to add beauty to a poem. Surely a thing’s own self cannot act as its own beautifier.1. This famous verse is usually attributed to Amaru, in whose collection it occurs as the second benedictory stanza. But Amaru is likely to have borrowed it, perhaps from Bäna (so SRK 49). It describes the destruction of the demon city Tripura by the god Siva, an act that the demons themselves had long before prayed for. The act, although painful in immediate effect, is regarded as one of purification and mercy. It is here likened by sugestion to a lover’s insistent embrace of a jealous mistress.

When it is said that the lover was scorned (avadhûta), it means that he was not greeted with an embrace in return. In the case of the fire the same word means that the fire was fragmented (visarârûkrta) through the shaking of the entire body. Their eyes were filled with tears in the one case because of'jealousy and in the other because of dispair.(Commentary on /I’s comment:] The love in separation because of jealousy that is suggested by the simile “like a lover,\" which simile is in turn supported by ambiguities (viz., ksipta and avadhûta), is sub­ordinated together with the simile and ambiguities and not by itself alone. It is subordinated to the main purport, namely the greatness of Óiva. Although the relish of compassion (karunarasa) is in fact also present in the stanza, inasmuch as it is not involved in our perception of the beauty of this [love in separation], Änanda has said that this [relish of love in separation] is combined only with ambiguities and has nót said that it is combined with karunarasa.1 As this matter [namely the subordination of the figures rasavat, etc.] was not thought of by previous writers, he emphasizes it, saying: only such.

N othing wrong: If either of the two rasas [vipralambhasrngära or karwna] had been pre­dominant in the verse, the second rasa could not have been combined with the first. For love in separation, whose primary emotion is love (roti) and which consists in a hope for reunion, is in contradiction to tragedy (karuna), whose primary emotion is sorrow and which consists in the despair of reunion.Having thus demonstrated the [possible] co-presence (of two opposed rasas] in the course of treating the expression alankara [used in 2.5 K ualankäro rasädir iti me matih\"], he now explains the intention behind his use of [the emphatic word] “only” (evo) [in his commenti by saying: for when, etc."},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"2401. The word tat in the compound tat-cäratva refers, as BP correctly states, to the irsyävipralambha mentioned in the preceding sentence. Abhi- nava is not denying tragedy or the aesthetic relish of compassion (kannarasa) in the stanza. How could he, when Änanda admits it in his next sentence? He is simply making it clear that the karunarasa does not beautify the érngâra- rasa. The two are held distinct and both are in subordinate positions. Hence they can both be contained in one stanza; cf. 3.20 K together with A’s com­ment. The reason that they cannot be combined in rasadhvani is that in rasadhvani one would have to be subordinated to the other, in which case their contradictory natures would clash.[ § 2.5 c LA Here is a summary of the matter:What makes any figure of speech a figure of speech is the fact that it is introduced in dependence on a rasa, bhàva, or the like, which serves as the purport of the sentence.Therefore, wherever a rasa or the like forms the main purport of a sentence, that is not to be included under the domain of the figure of speech rasavat or any other, but must be considered to fall under the domain of suggestion (dhvani) itself. Of this [suggestion], simile and the like act as the ornaments. On the other hand, wherever anything else predominates as the meaning of the sentence, and where rasa or the like contributes to its beauty, that is where rasa or the like acts as a figure of speech. Thus the domains of suggestion and of such figures as simile and rasavat aie distinct.L Any figure of speech: e.g., simile, etc. The sense is this: the function [viz., ornamentation] that makes a simile a figure of speech works equally with the rasas, etc., [making them figures of speech when they serve in the same function]. There must always be something else to be ornamented. Now this something else, even if it be only a fact (vastumâtra), if it develops into a vibhäva, etc., may furnish a rasa or"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"241the like as the purport of the sentence. 1 And so everywhere it is rasa- dhvani that is the soul or essence. This is what has been said in the words a rasa, bhäva, or th e like, which serve as th e p u rp o rt of th e sentence.O f this: viz., of that which is in a dominant position and is the soul [of the poem]. That is to say, although it is the literal meaning [of a sentence] that is ornamented by simile, nonetheless, the oranmenting of this literal sense consists in its being endowed with the capacity to convey a suggested sense, and so in reality it is the soul of dhvani2 that is ornamented and not the literal sense. For it is the soul that is ornamented by bracelets, armbands, etc., which are worn on the body, for these ornaments indicate what is likely to be in the thoughts [of the wearers].3 Thus, an insentient corpse, even if provided with earrings, etc., is not beautiful, for there is nothing [sc., no soul] to be ornamented. And the body of an ascetic adorned with bangles, etc., would look ridiculous because of their inappropriateness to that which is to be ornamented. Nor is anything inappropriate to a body; so it must really be the soul that is ornamented. This agrees with what people feel. They say “I am adorned” [and not “My body is adorned.”] W here roso or th e like acts as a figure of speech: [the Sanskrit phrase] exhibits two genitives that are not in apposition. The meaning is: that alone is the province of the functioning as a figure of speech of rasa and the like. In consonance with this, one should explain in similar manner the earlier passage in the Vrtti [Text, p. 198, line 1, na rasäder alaiikärasya visayah], understanding it to mean: “that is not ’ the area of an act of beautifying, of which act rasa or the like is the agent.” 4Thus: that is, by distinguishing their spheres as we have done. Such figures o f speech as simile: In cases where rasa is that which is ornamented [i.e., where rasa is predominant], and where there is no other rasa subordinated, i.e., no rasavadalaiikäm. there such figures of speech as simile are pure [i.e., are not mixed with any second figure of speech]. Therefore the domain of simile, etc., is not eliminated by the figure samsrsti.5A nd rasavat: the term here includes the figures based on bhäva and the like (viz., rasäbhäsa, bhäväbhäsa, and bhävaprasama when used as an ornament], that is, the figures called preyasvin. ürjasvin, and samä- hita [as well as rasavat].6Here is an example of a bhäva used as an ornament without any other figure of speech or rasa mixed therewith:§ 2.5 d L ]"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"[ § 2.5 d LYour foot, 0 Mother,with its sole as soft and red as a lotus petal sings with the jingling of its anklets like the gabbling of walking geese.How did this foot,stamping on the head of the buffalo demon, grow as ponderous as the Golden Mountain?in this example the main purport of the verse is praise of the Goddess, jut the emotions (vyabhicäribhävas) wonder and speculation act as iources of beauty. As they are subordinated to the main purport, this s a case of bhävälankära.7An example of rasäbhäsa used as an ornament is a prayer of my own imposition:If ail poetic qualities and every ornament of speech were to embellish you, my Muse, you would not show so fairas by taking your words whichever way they come, if thus they may delight your heart’s love, Siva.So only will you be beyond compare.n this example the main purport of the sentence is that the highest task )f speech is to praise God.

For Bharata îas said that srrigäTa “deals with beautiful clothes and with young and îoble people” (BhNS 1, p. 300).8An example of bhäväbhäsa as subordinated to the main sense of a joem is the following:May he protect you, upon whose killing of their kinsmen the surviving demons tremble to see the dark coloreven in the collyrium used by their women to paint their lovely waterlily eyes.9n this verse we have an example of bhäväbhäsa because the accom- >anying emotion (vyabhicäribhäva) of dread (träsa) [which is subor-"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"243are terrifying by nature.10 Similarly, an example of bhâvaprasama [as subordinated to the main purport] may be supplied.1. Abhinava here has in mind the third sort of suggestion that we men­tioned in the footnote to 2.5 b A. The BP gives an example. In the verse “Why do you laugh?” the fact that is ornamented is the power of the vic­torious king. But this fact itself may assume the form of a stimulant to the emotion (bhäva) of love for that king in the heart of the poet. One might better choose as an example “The women of the Triple City.\" The power of God is a vastumätra, but one will readily grant that for many persons this fact stimulates their love of God. 2. dhvanyätmä: for the ambiguity of the term see 2.2 K, note 1. BP glosses the present occurrence as dhvaniripa ätmä. What is meant is the suggested sense in the form of a rasa, etc.; but by calling it dhvanyätmä Abhinava is able to give the analogy which follows.3. BP. Thus, the necklace and bracelets worn on the body of a young person indicate the likeliness of affairs of the heart, while the staff and orange robe of the ascetic indicate his distaste for worldly pleasures. 4. Abhinava wishes to make the two passages parallel. But surely in rasäder alahkärasya Änanda intended to use the words in apposition: “of the figures of speech called rasädi (i.e., of rasavadalankära, etc.).\" 5. The reason for this comment of Abhi-nava’s on upamädinäm is that, strictly speaking, there is no figure upamä in the verse “The women of the Triple City” that has been under discussion. The upamä in that verse is associated with rasavadalankära, so the figure should be known technically as samsrsti (association); see 1.13 i L, note 1. At this rate it might be thought that samsrsti will preempt the whole habi­tat of upamä and of rasavadalankära, and that Änanda should have written dhvaneh samsrstes ca vibhaktavisayatä bhavati. But no, says Abhinava. There are other instances where upamä in a pure form may ornament the predomi­nant meaning. So Änanda is justified. 6. Abhinava here constructs a more logical system of the rasädy alahkäras than we find in the older critics. Orig­inally the four figures rasavat, preyasvin, ürjasvin, and samähita formed a very disparate collection. In Bhämaha and Dandin they represent, respec­tively, an emotional passage, a complimentary address, a passage of boasting or pride, and a happy coincidence. Udbhata was the first to bring some sort of logical order to the group, defining rasavat as a passage with strong smigära- rasa, preyas or preyasvin as a passage where some other rasa was involved, ürjasvin as a passage showing rasäbhäsa or bhäväbhäsa, and samähita as a description of bhâvaprasama. Abhinava now takes the five concepts listed in Kärikä 2.3, viz., rasa, bhäva, rasäbhäsa, bhäväbhäsa, and bhävapradänti, and in effect sets up five alankäras to cover the five cases where one or the other of these concepts plays a subordinate role in a sentence. 7. According to the older scheme of alankäras the figure here will be called preyasvin. 8. Abhi- nava’s point is that siyigäm, suggested through slesa, here serves an ulterior§ 2.5 d L )"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"244purpose. Hrdayavallabha means “one’s heart’s love” and âiva will suggest the nâyaka because of the masculine gender, whereas vont (speech, which we have translated as “Muse”) will suggest the näyikä because of the feminine gender. Ranjayeh in the case of the lover will mean not to delight but to make love to. The spigarti that is here suggested by ambiguities and that in turn ornaments the religious statement of the verse is not spigära precisely as defined by Bharata. Accordingly, Abhinava calls it épigârâbhâsa. The trans­lation “false love\" here would misrepresent Abhinava's intent and one should not press his remarks on 1.4 g L (anavcityena tadäbhäsah) too far. There is nothing inappropriate here in the relation of the poet’s muse to God. The äbhäsatva comes simply from the fact that the relish of this love falls outside the strict definition of spigärarasa. God, as conceived in Abhinava’s éaiva- Vedänta theology, is essentially without qualities. 9. The black collyrium reminds them of the black-complexioned Krishna. The metaphor in “waterlily eyes\" (nayanotpala) derives from the color of the dark blue waterlily, to which the color of the pupil is likened. The verse is quoted also in ABh. I, p. 297. It appears in SvbhA. as No. 32, ascribed to Candaka.10. The figure will therefore be ürjasvin according to the definition of Udbhata; see note 6 above.[ § 2.5 d LA Should one urge that figures like rasavat occur only when the purport of the sentence deals with sentient creatures, this would amount to saying that such figures of speech as si ile have a very small domain, or have no domain at all. The reason is that when the situation of something that is not a sentient creature forms the purport of the sentence, we shall find that in some way or other there is some connection with the activity of a sentient creature. If you argue that, regardless of this connection, wherever the literal sense of the sentence concerns that which is not a sentient creature, this is not an instance of rasavat, your argument will amount to saying that great works of poetry, the very mainstay of rasa, are devoid of rasa.* 11. The Sanskrit passage rendered in this paragraph is puzzling enough to have made Jacobi suggest that a portion of it (from tarhi, Text, p. 200, line 1, through satyäm api tasyäm, line 3) is an insertion. But it is clear that Abhinava read the passage as we have it and the passage as a whole becomes"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"245clear if one bears in mind that the objector belongs to an old-fashioned school of critics whose view of rasa is radically different from Ananda's. To the objector there is no such thing as dhvani. Accordingly, he makes no distinction between rasa and rasavadalaiikdra. If the sentence meaning contains rasa, bhdva, etc., we have a case of rasavadalankära. If it does not, we have the domain of the other alaiikäras such as simile. Now as the criterion by which to distinguish these domains, the objector first proposes cetanavrttdnta. If the purport of the sentence concerns a sentient creature, we have rasavadalaiikdra; if it concerns anything else, we have simile, etc. Änanda replies that this will leave no domain for simile, etc., for we can always show some connection between the purport of the sentence and sentient creatures. The objector then refines his criterion. He will disregard these possible connections: if the sentence meaning is prima facie concerned with what is not a sentient creature, the domain belongs to simile, etc., not to rasavat. The answer to this argument is that great passages of poetry, which everyone recognizes as the paradigms of rasa—for example, the description of the oncoming season of rain in the Rämäyana, or Purüravas’ apostrophes to nature in the mad scene of the Vikramorvasiya—will lack rasa by the objector's criterion. This is because the objector’s theory can admit rosa into a poem only in the form of rasavadalaiikdra and by his last refinement he is excluding the descriptive passages of the Rdmdyana, etc., from that figure.§2 .5 e l ]L Should one: with these words he introduces the refutation of the opponent’s view that was hinted at by the words “my opinion” [in Kärikä 2.5]. The opponent’s view is this: as a rasa is a mental state, it cannot belong to non-sentient objects.1 So there is no possibility of rasavadalaiikdra or the like in descriptions of such objects. Accordingly, the sphere of simile, etc., is different from the sphere of rasavad, etc. Our author refutes this. T his would am ount: that is, because of the preceding statement. But the opponent may reply, “It has [already] been said [by us] that the descriptions of non-sentient objects is the sphere [of simile and the like].” Anticipating such a reply, he gives the reason for his statement [that simile and the like would have little or no sphere at all]: th e reason is. In som e way or other: that is, by taking the form of a vibhdva. etc. R egardless of this: i.e., even though there may be some connection with a sentient creature. Devoid of raso: the position of the opponent is that wherever there is rasa there must necessarily be rasavadalaiikdra. So if there is no rasavadalankära, there will surely be no rasa.

Are those arbors on the bank of the daughter of the Kälinda mountain, i.e., the Jumna, well? The question is conveyed by inter­rogative intonation. The blessed Krishna, residing now in Dvärakä, his memories awakened at seeing the cowherd, asks him this question, and then soliloquizes in a manner full of longing and with feelings of love awakend by memory of the älambanavibhävas [viz., Râdhâ and the ÿopïs] and uddïpanavibhâvas [viz., the bowers].2 The purpose of these bowers lay in their being cut, because they were soft, that is, delicate, for making beds of love, that is, love-couches; and that purpose is now fulfilled. Or, we can interpret the line to mean that the preparation, that is, the finished arrangement, into a love-couch, was gentle, that is, delicate; that this was the result of the cutting, which result has now come to an end. The idea is: now that I no longer recline there, what use is there in making love-couches? And so, with assurance that his love for the gopis is mutual [i.e., that they will never make love-couches for anyone else], he says, “I know, etc.” The grammatical object of the verb “I know” is the sense of the whole sentence which follows. “Will have grown old and hard”: If I were present, the leaves would be con­stantly used, as described above, and would never [have time to] reach such an old, faded, left-over condition. The remark that the leaves have lost their dark lustre suggests that Krishna has been away [from Gokula] for some time, but is still filled with constant longing for it. Thus, the second half of the stanza can be taken to be what Krishna says to himself. Or, we can take it as addressed to the cowherd to ascertain [the fate of the bowers].

Now, if you should say that whenever such portrayals are given, we may regard them as examples of rasa, etc., used as figures of speech, you would leave simile, etc., with a reduced domain or with no domain at all. Because there is really no case of a portrayal of something insentient which is not connected with a portrayal of living creatures, at least in so far as it furnishes an emotional determinant (vibhävatva). Therefore rasa and the like are ornaments (figures of speech) when they are subordinate. But when a rasa or a bhäva predominates, then, by all means, it is that which is ornamented, that is, the soul of suggestion (dhvani).L Now: one may here supply “with a view to prevent a lack of rasa from obtaining in such cases.\" But it might be objected that simile and the like will have their domain in those cases where there is absolutely no question of that which concerns a living being. W ith this m mind, he says: B ecause, etc. A t least: When insentient reactions are described, for example paralysis, horripilation, etc., because of the fact that such reactions are anubhävas (the physical consequences of an emotional situation), they necessarily bring into consideration living beings [as their basis].

The Kàrikâ too can be brought into accord with these two propositions. However, in regard to the first, the first half of the Kàrikâ should be explained as an illustration.3 The text of the Vrtti should also be explained in this way.1. The two propositions are: (a) An alaiikära (figure of speech) must be different from the alankärya (the body of poetry); (6) One can only speak of an alaiikära and a guna (poetic quality) where an alaiikärya and a gunin (viz., rasa or the like) are present. 2. It is not clear just what arguments (yuktijätam) Abhinava is referring to. But yukti refers to something less than formal proof (sädhana), e.g., to circumstantial proof and analogy, and one can find arguments of this sort for the predominance of rasa in the comments on 2.5. Even when the main purport of a sentence is a mere thing, it will lead eventually to raso if the sentence deserves the name of poetry. The two new propositions are more in the nature of formal proof. 3. The first half of the Kärikä does not state the proposition that an alankära must be different from an alaiikärya, but illustrates it by the analogy: a guna is that which depends on a gunin.§ 2.7 K]A So alsoK It is just srngàra (the flavor of love) that is the sweetest and most delightful flavor (rasa). Sweetness (mâdhurya) has its seat in poetry that is full of this flavor.1"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"2521. The old vocabulary of poetic criticism is here preserved, but it is made to express new relations. From the time of Bharata the critics spoke of the qualities or virtues (guna) of poetry. The early critics emphasized the qualities of sound. Later, qualities of meaning came in for their share of attention. But in all these critics the qualities were considered virtues in themselves. Now the Dhvanyäloka reduces the ten qualities of Bharata to three: sweetness (mädhurya), force (ojas), and clarity (prasäda); and it regards them as virtues only insofar as they lead the audience to rasa. This is Änanda’s position: the qualities reside in the sound and sense but depend on, exist only for the production of, the rasa. Abhinava goes even further, saying that the qualities are ultimately qualities of the rasa, of the experience itself. Their names are then applied metonymously to the sound and the sense that bring about such an experience.( § 2.7 KA The rasa of love is sweet in comparison with the other rasas, because it gives delight. The quality known as sweetness is attributed to a poem if the poem consists of words and meanings which reveal this flavor. As for being pleasing to the ear, this characteristic belongs to [the poetic quality] force (ojas) also.L Now it might be claimed that the qualities sweetness and the like belong to word and meaning. One may therefore ask how these qualities were said to depend on the predominant element, namely a rasa or the like [see 2.6]. Anticipating this question, he says: so also. He means that this [dependency] is perfectly reasonable because of the particular refutation [of the old-fashioned view] that our author has in mind and that he is about to announce.[Commentary on K] “It is just srngâra, etc.” He gives the reason why it is called sweet with the words “most delightful.\" For in all crea­tures: gods, animals, men, and the like, there is an unbroken proclivity (väsanä) towards the emotion of love (rati).1 Accordingly, there is no one who is not inclined to respond sympathetically to it. Even an as­cetic can be struck by its charm. And so it is said to be sweet. For a sweet substance, such as sugar or the like, when-it comes in contact with the tongue, will immediately prove desirable to everyone, wise or foolish, healthy or sick. “Full of this”: viz., that poem in which srngâra is the main concern of the poet and is conveyed through suggestion as the essence of the poem.2 “Poetry,” i.e., both word and sense. “Has its seat” : takes its seat. This is as much as to say that in reality what is"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"253called sweetness is a quality only of the rasa, such as srngâra, etc. This [quality] has been metaphorically transferred to the word and meaning which are suggestive of this sweet relish. For the definition of sweet­ness is the capacity of words and meanings to suggest the sweet relish of love [etc.]. Therefore it was correct to say, \"whatever depends on,” etc. [2 .6 K].[Commentary on A] The Vrtti gives the meaning of the Kärikä:: T he rasa of love, [etc.]. Now sweetness has been defined (by Bhämaha 2.3, where he says]: “That [poem] which is pleasing to the ear and which does not contain many compound words and compound ideas is what is called sweet.” Our author rejects this with the words pleasing to th e ear, etc. He uses “pleasing to the ear” as an abbreviation of the whole definition of Bhämaha. Belongs to force also: for in the verse “Whatever man proud of his strong arm,” 3 [which is an example of force,] there is both pleasingness to the ear and absence of long compounds.1. All creatures have had some previous experience, if not in this life at least in some previous life, of rati. This has left them with a latent proclivity toward this emotion, a predisposition to be affected by the stimulants of this emotion. 2. To speak in simple terms, Abhinava is rejecting the sense “poetry which is full of this relish” and substituting the sense “poetry in which this relish forms the essence.” To speak in technical terms, Abhinava is rejecting the Kâsikà's interpretation of Pan. 5.4.21: tatprakrtavacane mayat. Here the Kâsikà says that prakrta means pràcuryena prastutam. Thus the sjltro means, according to the Kâsikà, “the suffix mayat [may be added to a word designating a substance when we wish] to express that there is an abundance [of that substance].” Abhinava, on the other hand, wishes to take prakrta to mean ätmatvena prakrta and would understand the sütra to mean “ ... when we wish to express that the substance forms the essence [of something].'' 3. The verse will be given in full in 2.9 A.§ 2.8 K ]K In the rasa of love in separation and that of compassion (ka- runa) sweetness is intense.

It is with this in mind that he says, In th e rasa of love, etc. And in th a t of com passion: the word “and” shows the sequence. Intense: what is meant is an intensity that progresses [in step with the sequence].

To a g reater degree: to a progressively greater degree. This is as much as to say that in the relish of compassion the heart completely melts. Now an objector will question us: “If there is sweetness in the relish of compassion as well, how do you explain the fact that in the previous Kârikâ the word “just” (eva) was used [“It is just srngâra\" etc.]? Our reply is that this was not meant to exclude other rasas, but only to show that in strict fact poetic qualities such as sweetness and the like belong only to a rasa, the very soul [of poetry], and that only by extension are they attributed to words and meanings. This is what the use of “just” was meant to indicate. 1The Vrtti gives the sense of the Kärikä: in b o th these rasas, etc.1. Abhinava is quick to notice discrepancies of statement. But he does not rest content with-noticing them, as a Western critic might do. He is a partisan of his author, so he hastens to defend him.

It is what is primarily denoted by the word strength (ojas). Raudra and other similar rasas consist in the relishing of this excite­ment. They are characterized as effects, that is, they are distinguished from other rasas, by this excitement, this particular kind of relishing. Hence, by a metonymy which applies the name of the effect to its cause, raudra and si ilar rasas are called by the name “strength” (ojas). Then by resorting to a second metonymy,2 even a word-group which reveals excitement, namely a sentence with long compounds, is called “an excitement” (dïpti),3 for example, the verse ”The brutal war-club whirling.\" In addition to this, a meaning which produces excitement, being expressed by lucid, quickly intelligible words4 without recourse to compounds, is also called “an excitement” (dïpti), for example, the verse “Whatever man proud of his strong arm.”[The b ru tal w ar club, etc.:] With this “brutal,” that is, cruel, war- club which will be wielded by my “whirling\" arms, that is, arms circling with great speed; with the full attack of this war-club the “two thighs” will be simultaneously “samcürnita,” that is, completely crushed so that the man cannot stand up again.

The same applies to the loathsome. But for the rasa of peace there is a great variety of determinants, so that sometimes strength will predominate and sometimes sweetness.8 Such are the distinctions [among the rasas].[ § 2.9 L1. BP and Mahädevasästri (see Text, p. 208, footnote) are worried by this statement because the relish of the marvelous should produce räga rather than dipti according to what Abhinava has just said (2.8 L; Text, p. 208, line 1 of Locana). But we need not suppose the characteristics of the separate rasas to be so rigidly departmentalized. 2. A laksitalaksanâ is a second laksanä which comes into effect after a first laksanä has already operated. 3. Ob­serve how elaborately Abhinava has complicated the natural sense of these words. To take the words naturally, ojas (strength) is a property of words and meanings which enables them to produce a rasa of fury or of the heroic. This rasa is characterized by dipti (excitement, or, literally, “inflammation”). But in Abhinava’s explanation, dipti and ojas become synonyms. Dipti is what ojas primarily means and ojas denotes primarily the result of an experience. The word ojas (or dipti) is then transferred by metonymy to the experience, the relishing, itself. Then by a second metonymy dipti (or ojas) is transferred to the words and meanings that produce the experience. 4. Abhinava uses the word gamaka to paraphrase the word prusanna used in the Vrtti [Text, p. 2 1 1, line 1]; so it means jhatityarthabodhaka (BP) “instantaneously con­veying the intended sense.” Abhidhiyamäna paraphrases the abhidheya of the Vrtti 5. As will appear from his further comments, Abhinava is taking the genitive sayodhanasya as anädare sasthï (Paru 2.3.38) and eliciting some such meaning as UI shall so despise Suyodhana in his weakness that I will wash my hands in his blood.” This is of course an unwarrantable extension of what Panini means by the gentive absolute of despite. Furthermore, this genitive in actual use almost always contains a participle, e.g., rudato ’vrâjit. “despite his (father’s) weeping he became a monk.” The Käsikä actually in­sists on the presence of a verb form. The interpretation probably appealed to Abhinava on two grounds. It avoids construing suyodhanasya with the subordinate member of a compound, ioni; and it intensifies the raudrarasa. Abhinava uses a similar interpretation for the locative, 3.10-14 c L and note 1, 3.24 L and note 2. 6. No iva is used, so it is not a direct utpreksä. Butthe red blood reminds the hearer of red flowers, so that a fancy is suggested.7. The reading bhagna of Päthak’s edition seems better than the magna of our text or the bhaya of TYipathi’s. The point would be that in relishing fear, our mind, it is true, is reduced to weakness: but as it is strong stimulation that has so weakend it, strength plays a predominant part in literature of that genre. 8.

This clarity was regarded as < virtue in itself without regard to what was being clarified. The Dhvanyâlokt mow defines it primarily in terms of rasa. Clarity belongs only to that won and meaning which clearly reveal a rasa. It is common to all rasas, that is, i is found in the words and meanings which produce all rasas.

P rim arily: This ability to communicate can be intended only with reference to the suggested meaning, not others, for what is so wonderful in a word’s communicating its literal sense that one should use the word “quality” or “virtue” of such a word? This is what our author has in mind.Thus according to Bhämaha [2.1-3] only three qualities were ac­cepted: sweetness, strength, and clarity. And these three qualities refer primarily to the relishing of the audience. By metaphor their names are extended to that which is enjoyed, namely the rasa [in that word’s sense of object rather than process], and even further to the words and meanings which suggest this rasa. This is the essence of what he means to say. 1[ § 2.10 L1. We follow BP in reading vyâpakatvam in place of vyäpärakatvam-, cf. the use of vyâpyate in the verse from which the analogy of fire and dry wood is taken (BhNS 7.7, quoted Dhv.

The second is used by Mammata 8.70 (Jhalkikar p. 476), who has doubtless taken it from Abhinava, as is clear from the commentary of Sndhara, p. 277. The sense is that if a clean cloth is put into water, it will quickly absorb the water, whereas if the cloth is greasy the water will not easily be absorbed. Cf. Jhalkikar, p. 476: svacchajalavat—jalam yathä svaccham patam sahasaiva vyäpnoti malinapate jalasyäprasärät tadvat. 3. This sense of ca has the authority of Patanjali, Mahäbhäsya on Pan. 2.1.16. Kaiyata justifies it by the fact that “particles have many meanings” (anekârthatvân nipätänäm). Abhinava not only takes the word here in this unnatural sense, but he reads it twice (by ävrtti or tantra) so that it may restrict both rasa- sädhärano and sa gunah. 4.

None of the commentators or translators remarks on this little word “and.\" It would seem to connect the present Kärikä with the immediately preceding Vrtti in a way that can be shown by the following paraphrase. “The designation of clarity should be restricted primarily to the suggested meaning and the relative faults also are faults only where the meaning is suggested.\"2. Four faults are intended, as first listed by Bhämaha 1.44: srutidusta, artha- dusta, kalpanidusta, and srvtikasta. They are explained below by L. 3. That is to say, indelicacy of sound and the like are faults only in vivaksïtânyapara- vâcyadhvani where the vyangya is smgärarasa.A Faults such as indelicacy of sound, which have been indicated to be relative, also need not be shunned when the literal meaning is the sole object, nor when a meaning other than the rasa of love is intended, nor when the rasa of love is not suggested by that type called the soul oi 'dhvani. It is seen from illustrations that these faults are to be avoided only in the soul of suggestion, when love is suggested as the primary element [of the poem]. If this were not the case, these faults would not be relative.So now the essence of dhvani, where suggestion is indicated with­out apparent sequence (asamlaksyakramavyangya), has been shown in general terms.L Having previously shown that the distinction in usage between the words “quality” (guna) and “ornament” (alahkära) is a logical one only if one accepts our position (see 2.6 L), our author now sets forth to show that the distinction of absolute and relative faults also makes sense in our position only.

Indelicacies of meaning (arthadusta) are such as cause us to understand something indecent because of the purport of the sentence as a whole. An example is [the ambiguous verse]: “Seeking his chance, the great proud [man] advanced to the attack,” [which can also mean “Seeking for the hole, the great stiff (penis) advanced to the attack”]. An indelicate arrangement (kalpanädusta) occurs by the arranging of two words: for example h im mcim (do what you like) if arranged in reverse.2 Harshness of sound (smtikasta) is seen in such words as adhâksît (has burned), aksautsit (has stamped), trnedhi (pierces). The relish of love is meant to include other appropriate rasas as well, be­cause these faults are avoided in other rasas such as the heroic, the peaceful, the marvelous, etc.Have been indicated: The early authors have not shown the rel­ativity of these faults by showing any distinction in the areas [where they may and where they may not be used]. Neither have they shown how they differ from such [absolute] faults as error in meter, nor have they really shown how they differ from virtue.3 Our position is that they are allowable in the relish of disgust, of comedy, and of fury; and that they are to be shunned in the relish of love and the like. This explains why they eure called relative. Such is what our author has in mind. 1[ § 2.11 L1. Place a danda after srutidusta instead of hetavah. 2. I.e., mcim him.

Bhämaha's example involves no reversal but merely an infelicitous juxtapo­sition: sa sauryäbharanah “this ornament of courage,” which brings together the syllables yäbha, the vulgar Sanskrit word for sexual intercourse. 3. An indecent ambiguity might be a virtue in a comic verse; one can easily find examples in the anthologies. As for Abhinava’s negations, they are all strictly true of Bhämaha. Bhämaha admits that some of these faults may appear as virtues in just the right context (1.54-55) and he gives us two or three exam­ples. But he states no general principle such as is stated here by Änanda."},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"§ 2.12 A ]K The varieties of the elements subordinate to this [rasa or the like] and the varieties within itself, when one imagines all their possible combinations with one another, are infinite.A It has been stated that a rasa or the like when suggested as the main element of a poem constitutes the very soul of that type of dhvani in which the literal meaning, though intended, is subordinate to a second meaning. Of its subordinate elements, namely the figures of speech which are based on word or meaning, there are endless vari­eties. And of the main element itself, the varieties, namely the rasas, bhävas, rasäbhäsas, bhäväbhäsas, bhävaprasamas, taken together with the vibhävas, anubhâvas and vyabhicärins which produce these rasas, etc., are endless, having no limit in respect to the bases [in which they may be portrayed].1 Now if one were to consider all the possible com­binations of these [two sets of] varieties, one could not count up the varieties of a single rasa, much less of all. Thus, of the rasa srngära there are two main categories to begin with: love in union (sambhoga- srngära) and love in separation (vipralambhasrngära).2 Of love in union there are the varieties represented by the lovers’ looking at each other lovingly, their sexual enjoyment, their recreation, and so on. Of love in separation we have yearning in separation, the separation caused by jealousy, by love quarrels, by exile, and so on. And all of these may be divided according to the vibhävas, anubhâvas, and vyabhicärins in each case. And as there are differences of these according to the base in some location and the stage in some time-span [in which and at which they occur], even this one single rasa will prove to be endless in respect to the varieties which exist within itself. How much more so if we take account of the varieties of its subordinate elements! For if we consider all the varieties of subordinate elements [i.e., all the figures of speech] in their possible combinations with the varieties of each main element [i.e., with each rasa, bhäva, etc.], we shall surely arrive at infinity."},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"2641. svâérayâpeksayâ (Text, p. 215, line 6) cannot mean “when considered in themselves,” as Jacobi seems to have taken it, for that much is already implied by svägatäs in line 4.

In both cases svä- s'mya must refer to the dsraya. the physical base, in which the vibhävas, etc., reside. In the expansion Änanda has added a reference also to their residence in time, that is, to the various stages of the emotion. There are notably nine stages of love in separation before the subject dies of it. Now the spacially qualified residences of the emotions can scarcely be anything else than the characters in whom the emotions are displayed, “the appropriate male and fe­male characters,” as Abhinava puts it. But Abhinava strangely misinterprets the expanded phrase. See below. 2. It may be well to give literal transla­tions of these technical terms. Sambhogasrtigära is literally love in enjoyment; inpralambhasrngâra love in frustration, for vipralambha means literally vati­cani, deception, frustration. The subtypes of love in frustration are abhilàsa- vipralambha: frustration that takes the form of yearning; irsyävipralambha: frustration caused by the jealously of the woman; virahavipralambha: frus­tration caused by the woman's intentional separation (viraha) of herself from her lover; and praväsavipraiambha: frustration caused by the man’s leaving home (because of tour of duty, exile, etc.).[ § 2.12 AL Subordinate elements: that is, figures of speech. W ithin itself: belonging to itself (ätmagata), such as love in union and love in separation, and belonging to what belongs to itself (ätmiyagata), that is, whatever belongs to the vibhävas, etc. One could not compute all the relations of principal and subordinate even by a marker and table of elements. 1T he bases: what is meant are such bases as the appropriate male and female characters. Looking at each o th er lovingly implies other varieties as well, such as talking together, etc. Sexual enjoym ent is [divided into] sixty-four items, beginning with the [eight] embraces.2 R ecreation: that is, walking in the park. “And so on” will include such activities as water sports, drinking parties, watching the moonrise, games, etc. Yearning m separation is when a mutual love (rati) has arisen in a man and woman such that each values the other as his own life and when for some reason they are unable to meet, as in the case of the King of Vatsa and RatnävalT in the Ratnâvalî from the passage “Why do you ask whether she pleases me?” onward.

A sabdabhaiigaslesa is a more complicated pun, a word that can be divided in different ways, e.g., asoka (= the asoka tree, or = a-soka “not grief’).[ § 2.15 AL Yamakas and th e like: the word ädi refers to similar fig­ures.

For only this sort of figure is, in the real sense of the term, a subordinate element of rasa. For example:Your palm erases from your cheek the painted ornament and sighs have drunk the ambrosial flavor of your lip; the tears that choke you agitate your breast: anger has become your lover, stubborn one, in place of me.[Amarusataka 81; SRK 664, etc.]1Inasmuch as a figure that is subordinate to a rasa is characterized by the fact that no separate effort is required on the part of the poet to create it, it follows that if a poet who is concentrating on putting together a rasa should leave2 that trend of thought and apply himself to some other effort, the figure that might result would not be subordinate to the rasa. When one intentionally and repeatedly makes yamakas, there invariably is involved the undertaking of a separate effort, which takes the form of searching for the particular words that will fit. To the objection that the same will hold true of other figures of speech, we say not at all; other figures, even those which are difficult when described, will rush to present themselves to a poet of imaginative genius precisely while he is concentrating his mind on the rasa. An example is the passage in the Kâdamban where KâdambarT is [first] seen (by the hero]; again, in the Setubandha where Queen Sita is shocked by the illustion of the severed head of Rama. And this stands to reason, for rasas are suggested by particular meanings and by words th at convey these meanings.3 Now it is figures of speech such as rüpaka (metaphor) and the like that are the particular meanings which are able to reveal rasas. Therefore they are not extraneous devices in helping to suggest these rasas. On the other hand, this [character of being extraneous] does attach to yamakas and difficult arrangements~of words. As for those few yamakas and the like which are found to possess rasa, those are cases of the rasa's being subordinate and where the yamaka or the like is the predominant element. In rasâbhâsa, of course, it does not contradict (our theory) for a yamaka to be used as a subordinate element. But when rasa is to be suggested and is to be of primary"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"importance, yamakas and the like cannot be subordinated to the rasa because they require of the poet a separate effort.The following is a verse-summary of the matter.A great poet can produce with a single effort some matters that contain rasa together with figures of speech. But for composing yamakas and the like, he must make a separate effort even if he is well able to compose them. Therefore these figures cannot play a part subordinate to rasa. There is no objection to using yamakas and the like as elements subordinate to rasäbhäsa. But this subordination is impossible in the case of love, the soul of suggestive poetry.270 [ § 2.16 A1. The point of citing the verse is that it contains several figures of speech which detract in no way from the overall rasa, which is love in sep­aration caused by jealousy (irsyämpralambha). The figures are ambiguity (arthaslesa), metaphor (rûpaka: the anger acting like a lover), and contrast (vyatireka: anger is your lover, not I). 2. atyihya: according to Pan. 7.4.23the û should be shortened: atyuhya. 3. Remove the danda after äkseptavyäh and place it after sabdaih. The tat in tatpratipâdakaih. refers to väcyavisesa. The tat in tatprakäsinah refers to rasas.L T he reason: what is meant is a general principle. Only, etc.: on the road to rasa it is only what one happens on directly, as one is fitting the vibhävas and the like into the combined1 form of rasa, that can serve as ornament. Accordingly, yamakas and the like are always an obstruction to the rasa (aesthetic experience) both of the poet and of the reader, [not only in srngära but] also in the heroic, the marvelous, and other rasas. That our author spoke [in 2.15] of avoiding those figures especially in love-in-separation was doubtless for the purpose of drawing the attention of persons who are in the rut of tradition and who have not attained the height of good taste.2 And so in what follows he will speak in very general terms, saying, “therefore these figures cannot play a part subordinate to rasa.”T he em ergence: what he means is its self-generation through the favor of genius without any apparent making of it. M ay seem won­derful: that is, one wonders how it could have been formed.[In the verse quoted from Amaru] a lady is described as resting her face on her tender hand, her lower lip pale because of her sighs, her throat choked by a welling stream of tears, and her breast shaken by her steady sobbing. The lady, unwilling to renounce her anger, is being"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"271appeased by the speaker with flattering compliments. And while he does so his mind concentrates on relishing the symptoms (anubhävas) [which appear in the lady] of this love in separation caused by jeal­ousy. To this speaker [who is here the poet) such figures of speech as ambiguity, metaphor and contrast emerge effortlesssly and cause nc interruption of his relish, any more than they do of the relish of the reader.C haracterized: he means invariably characterized. R epeatedly (prabandhena): the word construes with the word ‘'being made\" (kri- yamâne)-, and since that which is made repeatedly must be made with intent, he uses the word “intentionally.” 3 A separate effort: an effort other than that of joining one component with another into a rasa. These spontaneous figures are described as being difficult (nirüpya■ mânâni durghatanâni), that is to say, even if one wishes to make them one could scarcely do so. And they are difficult when described (nirûp■ yamâne durghatanâni), that is to say, they arouse the reader’s wondei at their having been made. W ill rush to present them selves (aham■ pürvikayâ parâpatanti): the Sanskrit term derives from the phrase “me first!\" meaning “I will go first.” The abstraction of this is ahampürvikä, meaning a situation where each one seeks to go first.

Those few refers to those used by Kalidasa and others.5[In the verse summary] even if he is well able construes with “he must make a separate effort,” not with with what follows. These refers to yamakas and the like. What was said above [in 2.15-16] is here summarized in its essentials in the half verse: in th e case oi love, th e soul of suggestion. 11. samavadhàna is a technical term of Nyäya meaning co-presence, e.g., the presence of x together (with y) in z. See Upaskära on VaisS. 3.1.12 and 3.2.1 (p. 103, line 11); or Nyäyasiddhäntamuktävali p. 167. line 2. Abhinava’s use of the term here is very precise. He means when one is forming a vibhäve or the like so as to fit with the co-presence (the presence of all the other elements: anubhävas, vyabhicàrins) required in a given rasa. He uses the same word again eleven lines farther on 2. Abhinava imagines the author to be reasoning as follows. Yamaha is so well-loved a figure that it will be impossible to convince a conservative that it should be abandoned in all good poetry. I may be able, however, to make him see that its most glaring misuses are in bad taste. 3. Abhinava’s intention here is to guard against taking prabandhena directly with buddhipüruakam. It is not that the poet constantly§ 2.16 L ]"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"272has the intention of making yamakas, but that he makes them constantly and we therefore infer that he makes them intentionally. 4. The doctrine of vibhaktipratirüpakanipâtas goes back to a Ganasûtra on Pan. 1.4.57. It is useful in justifying irregular and idiomatic expressions. To take the present case: if the aham in ahampürvikayâ were the real pronoun aham, it would have to shift to its stem-form mad in the the compound (Pan. 7.2.98). 5.

And as his illusion contin­ues, for her eye extends [like a lily ornament] to the opening of her ear, he continues to buzz there.1 * * 4 And while she is frightened because of the timidity of her natural delicacy, he drinks her lower lip, which is as sweet as (he fragrance of lotuses in full bloom and is the very treaasury of love (rati). Thus the figure of speech, which is a svabhä- vokti (a naturalistic description) of the bee, has become subordinate to that rasa (viz., abhiläsavipralambhasrngära] which is the poet’s chief concern. Other [commentators], however, interpret the Vrtti's phrase bhramarasvabhävoktir alaiikärah to mean “the figure of which there is an expression in the course of describing the bee’s behavior” and they identify this figure as rûpakavyatireka.5§ 2.18-19 L }1. Clearly one must read samiksä in place of samtksya in order to get a feminin«» no un for uktä to agree with. In the next line one must correctrupakädir to rüpakäder as in the Kärikä. 2. In other words, one is to un­derstand angitvena rüpakäder, grahanatyägau rüpakäder, etc. The same effect will be obtained in the translation by substituting “metaphor and the like” for “them” and “they.” 3. Thus the relative pronoun yam in yam alaii-käram.

A Sanskrit sentence (väkya) of course admits of more parenthetical material than a sentence of Latin or English.4. Abhinava is reading into the close succession of the first two images of theverse the suggestion that âakuntalâ’s eye “stretches to her ear,” this being the convention by which the erotic poets refer to a beautiful eye that keeps casting sidelong glances. 5. The rùpaka (the superimposition of the charac­ter of lover on the bee) would be suggested, the vyatireka (contrast) would be directly expressed. While this identification of figures is at least possible, it is surely not what Änandavardhana meant when he used the phrase bhramara­svabhävoktir alaiikärah.. Whether Abhinava accepts the second interpretation is unclear. Usually he refers to other commentators only to disagree with"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"276them. Accordingly, BP claims that he disagrees here, that is, that he prefers the first interpretation. But in 3.43b Abhinava seems to favor the second.[ § 2.18-19 LA “Never acting as the chief element” means never predomi­nant. For it sometimes happens that an ornament which the poet has intended to be subservient to a rasa or the like actually appears to be intended as the chief factor. For example:By the imperious command of his discus stroke he rendered love's festival for the wives of Rähu empty of passionate embraces and left only with a kiss.1In this stanza (there appears to be] an intention to make the figure paryäyokta (periphrasis) 2 the chief element although the overall mean­ing of the sentence is a rasa or the like.31. The author of the verse is unknown. It refers to Visnu's cutting off the head of the demon Rähu with his discus. As Rähu’s disembodied head continued to live on—to be the cause of eclipses by its occasional swallowing of the moon or sun—it still remains possible for Rähu’s wives to enjoy his kisses. But they have been robbed of the full enjoyment of love. 2. Paryäyokta: see 1.13h L, note 1. The more restricted definition (“an implication of the cause by statement of the effect”) will apply to our verse. 3. Änanda’s text is not as logical as one could desire and we have been forced to add the words “there appears to be” in brackets. The overall meaning of the stanza is the courage of Visnu ( Vàsudevasya pratäpah), which suggests the relish of heroism (virorosa). But the striking effect of the figure of speech, its cleverness and brilliance, casts this overall meaning into the shade and what appears as the predominant element in the stanza is the figure of speech. The difficulty with Änanda’s sentence lies in vivaksä. How does he know what the poet intended? All we know is the result, from which we may say that the poet seems to have intended the figure to be the chief factor. We need the word driyate after vivaksä just as we had it after vivaksito two lines before the verse. But I fear to change the reading lest I be charged with emending the author rather than"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"§ 2.18-19 a L ]L He who, by means of his im perious com m and, that is, his untransgressible order [delivered] in the form of his discus stroke, made the festival of love to possess a mere remnant in the form of kisses; for this festival of love was rendered barren, that is, empty, of its amorous sportings among which embraces are the chief element. 1 But someone may object that what the poet here intended to be predominant was precisely the figure paryâyokta and not rasa or the like. So how can one claim that the overall meaning of the sentence is rasa or the like? But no. For what is intended to be expressed here is the courage of Visnu. And this does not appear as a cause of beauty,1 2 whereas the paryâyokta does. Although the poem is not faulty on this account, it may still serve as an example of how a subordinate figure can obscure the nature of the matter in hand which it was supposed to support. And from this there results a certain impropriety. Such is our author’s view. And so when he states [a few lines below] that “the criticism of a great poet is simply a criticism of oneself,” it must be clear that he did not give this example as an example of a fault.31. Abhinava takes älinganoddämavüäsa as a karmadhâraya containing a bafntvrihi. In doing so he takes udddma as a noun in the unexampled sense of chief element. We have preferred to give udddma its normal meaning and to take the compound as a tatpurusa, literally, “ a wild passion of embraces.”2. To explain this puzzling passage I suppose that Abhinava is interpreting the stanza as an instance of rasavadalaiikdra, in which the poet intends the initial suggestion of the heroic rasa to subserve an ultimate suggestion of love ofVisnu; see 2.5 b and c A. But in the working out of his verse the poet has given greater brilliance to the paryâyokta than to the virarasa. This interpretation would allow Abhinava to avoid condemning the poem, for the ultimate rasa would still be an aiigin to the aiiga of paryâyokta. Only the intermediate rasa would be downgraded. 3. I doubt that Änanda’s intention was as Abhinava says. Ananda’s opinion here, it seems to me, is that the overall meaning of the stanza, which is the heroic rasa, has been spoiled by the cleverness of the figure of periphrasis."},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"( § 2.18-19 bA Even when a figure is intended as subordinate [or helpful t the rasa], it must be taken up at the proper time and not at the wron time. An example of a figure taken up at the proper time is the upamc slesa (simile with ambiguity and puns) of the following:[The translation of the second meanings is given in small print beloi the translation of the first meaning.]It is bursting with new buds and pale of hue;She longingIt has just begun to blossomshe stretch with languorand exhibits a reaction to the constant advent of the breezes.her sighs., this garden vine today on its madana tree in her passionis like a rival woman, and by my gazing on it herI shall doubtless make my queen’s face flush with anger.[Harsa-deva, Ratnâvalï 2.4]1. The use of the simile helped out by puns and ambiguities is indee felicitous, as Abhinava will point out. The king here describes a vine i: the palace garden in terms that will apply to Ratnâvalï, who has recenti arrived in his harem as a servant girl. The verse occurs in the play befor the queen knows of the king’s new infatuation with Ratnâvalï. The puns am ambiguities, given in small type in the translation, not only confirm the sfinii but prepare us for the scenes of jealousy to come. If the verse had been use after the queen’s discovery, the figure would not be apt. The word prärabdhc jrmbhä has been rendered by one translator with \"has commenced to yawn. The translation carries a sadly inappropriate image to the English readei What is meant is the impatient and anticipatory stretching of the body of girl who is daydreaming of her lover and forced to bide her time. The sam expression is used in SRK 370. The same gesture arising from the same caus is described by the Latin poets also; see Juvenal 6.64-65.L It is bu rstin g w ith new buds, etc.: uddâmotkalikâm mean “whose buds (kalikäh) have arisen (udgatäh)”; also “whose longin"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"279(utkalikä) has arisen.” Prârabdhajrmbhâm ksanät means “at a moment, i.e., at that very instant, it has begun to blossom”; but jrmbhâ is also a stretching of the limbs caused by love. “Exhibits a reaction.\" namely the motion of swaying, a reaction on the part of the vine caused by the advent of the wind, namely the gentle approach of the spring breeze. The phrase also means “exhibits a reaction,” that is, manifests the fever in her heart, by the succession of her sighs. Samadanam means “with a madana, a species of tree” and also “with passion (käma).” Here the figure upamäslesa, being placed as trail-blazer to the relish of jealous love that is to follow, calls our attention to the enjoyment of that relish. So the figure is taken up at just the right moment inasmuch as it comes forth just as this rasa is about to begin. That is what our author has in mind.[One may] also [note that] the acting out of the primarily intended meaning, [namejiy that pertaining to the vine,] should be at every word, while the acting out of the secondary meaning [which pertains to the woman] should be only of the general meaning of the stanza and should be effected by upängas (facial gestures) . 1 On the other hand, it would be wrong to give no gesture at all [to the secondary meaning]. But enough on this incidental matter. The word “doubtless” (dhruvam) is the very heart of this preparation for the coming jealousy.1. We wish we knew more about the abhinaya, the acting out a descrip­tion by means of gesticulation and expression, that Abbinava has in mind. How would one act out the description of the vine? At just what point would one use an upäiiga to indicate that the description applies also to a woman? The angas and upängas are listed in BhNS 8.14 (Voi. 2, p. 3): tasya sirohastorahparsvakatïpâdatah sad aiigäni / netrabhrünäsädharakapola- cibukäny upängäni. From this it will be seen that an upänga is a facial ex­pression, a subtler indication of meaning than an anga. which is a gesture of the body.§ 2.18-19 c A ]A A figure that has been taken up, if it is abandoned at the right time for another figure better adapted to the rasa, will likewise [bring about the manifestation of a rasa], as in:"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"[ § 2.18-19 c AYou are rakta with your new blossomsand I am too with my beloved’s virtues;the éüïmukhas come to you,so do those shot by Love to me;the stroke of a damsel’s foot brings joy to you,so would it me and both of us should be,asoka tree, the same, if fatehad not made me sasoka.[Yasovarman; also Hanumannätaka 5.24]1For here the puns and ambiguities (slesa) with which the stanza begins, by their being abandoned for the expression of a contrast (tryatireka), give strength to the particular rasa [sc., love-in-separation]. It may be objected that there are not two figures of speech here, but one entirely different figure of speech, of composite nature like a man-lion, a figure consisting of ambiguity and contrast together.2 But our answer would be no, because that composite type of figure has a different sort of distribution. The domain of the composite figure is where we apprehend the contrast3 in the very same word in which we apprehend the ambiguity, as in the line: “The god [Indra] is Hari by name (sa harih), [whereas] your majesty is saharih (one who has horses) because you have a host of steeds.\" But in our stanza one word is the domain of ambiguity and another is the domain of contrast.4 If we were to imagine the presence of the “entirely different figure” (i.e., sarikara] in an area such as this [i.e., so wide as this], no area at all would be left for samsrsti.s1. Rakta: “red” and “in love”; silimukhas: “bees” and “arrows”; aioka: name of a kind of tree and “without grief”; sasoka: “with grief.\" The Hanumannätaka, in which the verse occurs, is a cento made up of verses taken from many poets and adapted, sometimes by slightly altering the text, to the story of Rama; see Kosambi, HOS Voi. 42, p. civ. The Subhäsitävali (1364) ascribes the present verse to Yasovarman, which is not improbable. To judge from line c the original context would have been one of love in separa­tion caused by jealousy (ïrsyâvipralambha). There is a superstition that the asoka tree will blossom only at the touch of a woman's foot; see Bloomfield JAOS 40, 1-24 and Ingalls HOS Voi. 44, p. 111. As regards the lover, the stroke of his mistress’ foot might serve as his penance and mark the end of her anger. But with the adaptation to the Rama story the context becomes dif­ferent. Sita is not jealous, but has been abducted. Hence the commentators on the Hanumannätaka and on the Rasagangädhara (KM edition, p. 354),"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"281with invincible logic but questionable taste, explain the kick desired by Rama as a reference to an acrobatic position of intercourse.The stanza has furnished matter for disagreement to Sanskrit critics for ten centuries (see Kosambi’s references under SRK 770), so it is not surprising that even the present editors hold different opinions concerning the figure or figures of speech which it contains. The problem briefly is this. Änanda quotes the verse as an example of a felicitous shift from one figure of speech to another. The verse begins with similes strengthened by puns and ambiguities. The lover in three respects is like the asoka tree. But the lover is separated from his beloved so that he is in grief (sasoka), whereas the asoka tree is, as its name proclaims, griefless (a-soka). The shift to contrast (vyatireka) in the last line is certainly effective in emphasizing the relish of love in separation.The chief objection to Ânanda’s analysis is that the stanza does not really drop one figure and take up another; the two figures are interlocked. The contrast cannot arise without the pun in \"asoka\" to support it. Änanda himself raises this objection (2.18-19 d) and answers it, not very happily, by pointing to other cases where contrast is effective without the use of puns. On this matter J. Masson remarks, “It is perfectly true, as Änanda says, that vyatireka can arise apart from slesa. But surely the point is not whether it can or cannot theoretically, but whether it does in the case of the verse ‘raktas tvam,’ etc.” Accordingly, Masson finds himself on the side of the obj tor. But Abhinava supports Änanda (see below), saying that the opponent’s view is incorrect because it goes against one’s inner feeling for the poem, a feeling that even the objector must share. Ingalls finds himself basically on the side of Änanda and Abhinava. Granted that the figures are interlocked, the charm of the stanza derives from its shift, its turnabout. The logic of Ânanda’s argument is not convincing, although Abhinava does much to improve it, as we shall point out in the notes which follow. But the poetic sensitivity of these two critics, it seems to Ingalls, was correct. After examining what Änanda and Abhinava have to say, the reader may come to his own conclusion. 2. This “entirely different figure of speech\" would be a form of fusion (aariAorn) as opposed to samsrsti (the association of distinct figures). The critics divide all cases of the presence of two or more figures in a single sentence or stanza into these two categories. Sankara (as opposed to samsrsti) is a figure distinct from the interlocked or interdependent members of which it consists. The objector is claiming that the as'oka-stama embodies that figure. Änanda will argue that it embodies a samsrsti. 3. One should drop the prakäräntarena before vyatirekapratitir. It probably arose by dittography from the prakäräntarena in the preceding line. 4. This is strictly true: raktas, silïmukhâh, made and asoka are the domain of slesa; asoka and sasoka are the domain of vyatireka. The fact that the figures overlap in asoka does not make Ânanda’s statement false. 5. For samsrsti see note 2 above. The argument from nirvisayatva is a favorite with the grammarians. Änanda has already used it before (2.5 e A).§ 2.18-19 c A ]"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"[ § 2.18-19 c LL “Rakta” means red. “I am too”: here rakta means “my pas­sion has been aroused.” One should understand the red color of the asoka bloom to be the stimulant (vibhâva) which arouses this passion. And hence the ideas expressed first in each quarter of the stanza are to be explained as stimulants [of what is expressed in the second half of the quarters] .1 So this is a hetuslesa. For slesa is very commonly an aid to the figures sahokti, upamä, and hetu. This is all that Bhämaha meant in describing slesa as being “of three varieties, viz., sahokti, upa- mä, and hetu.\" In making that remark he did not intend to deny that slesa may be an aid to other figures also.2T he p articu lar rasa: viz., love-in-separation. The word sasoka, which brings in the contrast, also gives scope to such transient states of mind (tn/abhicäribhävas) as depression, anxiety, and the like, which strengthen the relish of love-in-separation. B ut: this [different figure of speech] is the single figure fusion sankara, so there can be no question of discarding one figure (slesa) and adopting another ( vyatireka). That is the objector’s point. T h at: i.e., fusion. For fusion is the flashing into view of two figures of speech in one area. Thus, the word saharih is a single area. [It has two meanings:] “he is Hari” (sa harih) and possessing horses (saha haribhih).3 B u t in our verse: the particle hi is here used in the sense of “but” (tu).* The reference is to the stanza raktas tvam. One word: the words rakta, etc. [i.e. rakta, silimukha, made, which are the area of double meaning]. And an o th er: viz., asoka, etc. (i.e. asoka and sasoka, which are the area of contrast].5 But it might be urged that if we take the area to be the whole sentence, we can still have fusion here residing in a “single area.” Anticipating such a suggestion, he says if. In an area such as this: that is, a [whole] sentence. The singular inflection of visaye is intentional. The sense is, if one will call something a single area from its being a single sentence, then there can be no association (samsrsti) anywhere because it will be logically included in fusion.1. In the second line, it is the sight of the bees dying toward the aéoka flowers that excites the lover’s feeling of separation from his beloved. In the third line, it is the touch of a woman’s foot which gives delight to the asoka and may cause the lover to think of his own lady’s touching him in the same way. He is also excited at seeing the joy of the asoka. Abhinava’s point is that each element in the description of the asoka tree furthers the lover’s emotion and is therefore the cause of the second meaning of the ambiguous"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"283expression. 2. Bhämaha divides stesa into three varieties (3.17): sahokti- slesa. upamä-slesa, and hetu-élesa. Sahokti-slesa is where a word having the meaning “and” or “together with\" (saha) is used in connection with the am­biguity, e.g., “Being easy to ascend (or approach) and generous of fruit (or reward), wayside trees and good men serve the benefits of others.\" Upamä- slesa is where a word meaning “like\" is used, e.g., the same example with the substitution of “like\" {iva or tulya) for “and\" (ca). Hetu-slesa is where a cause is expressed, e.g., \"Because you are unfathomable and because you never transgress the proper bounds, you are like the ocean.\" In this example of hetu-slesa (taken from Bhämaha) both the word “like\" and an expression of cause (the ablative case) are used. In the asoka-verse a word for “like\" is used and, according to Abhinava, cause is suggested. Bhämaha would doubtless have identified the figure in the asoka-ve rse as upamä-slesa, but Abhinava’s extension of the term hetu-slesa allows a more suggestive interpretation of the verse. Whether Bhämaha would have allowed slesa to be an aid to still other figures, as Abhinava claims, is uncertain. But the opinion is ancient. Dandin says that slesa can increase the beauty of any figure (2.363). 3. And so thisone area furnishes both pun and contrast. 4. And so we have translated it. However, I think that the literal meaning of atra hi in Text 229, line 1 is the same as of the atra hi with which 2.18-19 c A begins. The sentence here is furnishing another reason to explain Änanda's disagreement with the ob­jector {iti cen na Text 228, line 3). But Abhinava is fond of this explanation of the particle hi (e.g. 3.6 a L) and uses hi in this sense himself (3.33 k L, Text 434, line 7). 5. The correct reading is doubtless asokädih, to whichsome absent-minded scribe added saéoka without thinking to remove the à di. As ( the text stands it is nonsense, for it is only the words asoka and sasoka which carry the vyatireka.§ 2.18-19 d A ]A Should one object that our stanza is not an instance of sam- srsti because the contrast comes into existence only by means of a pun (whereas samsrsti demands that the two figures be independent of one another], our reply is no, for we see that contrast can arise in a quite different manner also [i.e., without a si ile based on puns] .1 For example:"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"[ § 2.18-19 d AThe wind of doomsday, whose fierce blast will tear down mountains, will not blow it out; its beauty blazes far by day, it is quite untouched by the soot of night.Patanga gives birth to this unique wick nor ever serves to extinguish it:may this light for the lamps of every land, this sunlight, ever bring you joy.[Mayüra, Süryaéataka 23]a This is an example of contrast without the expression of any similarity at all.1 * 3 Again, it cannot be said that we perceive there [in the asoka- stanza] a cause of beauty to lie in the puns alone [without regard to similarity] and that the puns must therefore be intended to be subor­dinate to the contrast and not an independent figure on their own.4 Because in such an area [viz., the area of contrast] we find that beauty can result also from a well-stated simile alone [without puns], as in the following and other examples:My groans are like your thunder;the water of my eyes, your ceaseless downpour;the fire of grief bom of her separation,is like your flashing lightning;I bear my loved one’s face within my heart, you hide the moon in yours: in all this we are similar, friend Cloud; why then would you destroy me?[Yasovarman]*1. Änanda’s sentence suffers from both ellipsis and bad logic. Abbinava fills in the ellipsis, as we have done in brackets. But the conclusion does not follow from the premise. One cannot deduce a particular from a particular. For Abhinava’s attempt to improve the logic, see his commentary below and our note 1 thereon. 2. The stanza contains a pun in patanga: the sun(which gives birth to sunlight), or a moth (which serves to extinguish the wick of a lamp). So Änanda will furnish another example below of contrast in the complete absence of puns. 3. There is no expressed simil ity because the stanza contains no word “like\" or •‘similar to ( tulya).” There is of course a suggested simile as Abhinava will point out. But Änanda overlooks this pointbecause it is unimportant. See end of note 1 on Abhinava’s comment below.4. The disavowed statement, if true, would imply that the verse contains the figure of interlocked members sankara and not the two figures stesa and"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"285vyatireka held distinct in samsrsti. 5. The verse occurs in SRK 240. It is attributed to Yasodharman by Sadukti. 993; to Yasovarman by SüktiM. 43.33.§ 2.18-19 d L ]L Now an objection may be raised. Contrast always contains a si ile within itself; and in the case here [of the asofca-stanza] the simile has been brought in by means of puns. So the puns in the verse are an aid to the contrast. Thus the stanza is the domain of the figure fusion. On the other hand, where there is no relation of aider and aided between the two figures, that can be a case of association, even if the two figures reside in one sentence. This [is the objection which] our author now states. By m eans of a pun: what he means is “by means of a simile which is brought in by force of a pun.” Our author counters the objection with no. What he has in mind is this: Does contrast everywhere arise only when the si ile [or similarity] is directly expressed, or does it arise when it is implied? 1 He rejects the first alternative by saying: in a quite different m anner. He means, “even though the si ile [or similarity] is not directly expressed.“Will not blow out” means “cannot extinguish.” The flame of a lamp, on the other hand, can be extinguished by a mere breeze. “The soot of night”: soot in the form of night. “Not not freed from” means “quite untouched by.” The wick of a lamp, on the other hand, is accompanied by night (or darkness) because, as the wick is very slender, soot envelops its surface. “From pataiiga, that is, from the sun.” The wick of a lamp, on the other hand, is extinguished by a pataiiga, that is, by a moth, and does not take its birth therefrom.Sim ilarity: he means, with a series of similitudes or similes but without any word, e.g., “like” or “such as,\" proper to the conveying of this [relation]. This is as much as to say that as a simile by being merely suggested can be helpful to a contrast, the simile need not be expressed in so many words. Accordingly, the slesopamä (simile occasioned by puns) was not taken into our verse for its being helpful to the contrast.But, [a new opponent may object,] granted that this may not be the reason in other cases, in the case of the asoka-stanza the Slesopamä has been taken in because it was favorable to the contrast, because if it were not favorable, it would have no power to beautify. This is why the slesopamä cannot be a separate alaiikära (figure of speech = beautifier). This [is the objection which] our author now states with it cannot be said. Our author realizes in his heart that the opponent’s view is wrong because it goes aeainst one’s inner feeling [for the versel."},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"286Accordingly, he produces an example in which beauty arises without puns, simply through simile, which silences the opponent, who is really denying his own inner feeling. He does this with the sentence because, etc.In the exemplar verse the word \"like” is to be construed with all the words ending in the instrumental case. Everything else is to be understood as in the case of the stanza on the asoka.21. Änanda’s argument is actually different from that which Abhinava here supposes. Änanda in effect shows that (a) contrast can be produced by puns without simile, and (b) contrast can be produced by si ile without puns. FVom this he passes to the conclusion (c) that the contrast in the asoka- stanza is not in need of either puns or simile: the figures of that stanza are independent. This is arguing from a particular to a particular. Doubtless Abhinava saw the logical fault, for he makes an attempt to remove it. He supposes an objector to base an argument on a universal, thus:Contrast always involves simile,the simile in the asoka-verse is slesopamä,therefore the contrast and the élesa are iThis argument can be logically disproved by showing a single case where con­trast does not contain a simile. The verse from Mayûra is such an example, for there is no expressly denoted simile in it. Nothing is said of its suggested simile, for that is beside the point. A suggested simile falls in the category of dhvani, not of figures of speech. Technically, the interlocking of slesa and suggested simile does not produce sankara. 2. BP explains that the thun­dering of the cloud is to be taken as the cause of the speaker’s groans, and so on for the other elements of the verse; see 2.18-19 c L and note 1 thereon.[ § 2.18-19 d LA Again, when the poet’s mind is concentrated on carrying out the rasa, a figure which he will not wish to press too far (will bring about a manifestation of the raso] .1 For example:"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"§ 2.18-19 e L ]In anger she has bound himtightly in the noose of her soft armsand in the evening leads him to the bedroom,where before her attendant friendsshe points to the signs of his deceit and conjures hinever, never to do such a thing again.0 lucky lover:as he is hiding his transgression with a laugh, she weeps and strikes him.[Amarusataka 9]afor here a metaphor (rüpaka), being introduced but not fully carried out. greatly strengthens the rasa.1.

On the other hand, if he departs from these principles, a loss of rasa will certainly ensue. Exam­ples of such loss are to be found in abundance even in the works of great poets. But we have not demonstrated these lapses because publishing the faults of great men who have shown their greatness in thousands of fine verses would be simply a criticism of oneself. However, the general direction has been given of how the whole collection of figures of speech such as metaphor and the like can be useful in suggesting rasa. If a good poet, with concentrated mind, will follow this lead, discovering still other principles on his own account, and will thereby construct the soul of dhvani, of which we have just spoken, (that is, a suggested meaning] which appears without a perceived interval, then this [type of dhvani] will arise in all its glory.11.

O ther principles: he means other types of precaution; for example the taking up again at the right time a figure that has been dropped, as in a verse of my own composition: If the rays of the moon are pencils of ambrosia how come they to burn my heart?Or were they long ago infectedby their dwelling with the kälaküta poison?Then how is it they have not destroyed my life?Perhaps it is saved by the magic syllables in telling over my beloved's name.Then why do I faint?"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"290In this verse the figures rüpaka,2 sandeha,3 and nidarsanä,4 being suc­cessively abandoned and then again taken up,3 lead to a strengthening of the rasa. And so enough.1. The moon is traditionally supposed to be the reservoir of ambrosia drunk by the gods, but it once dwelled in the sea where one of its companions was the kälaküta poison. Pencils of ambrosia (amrtacchatäh): the dictionary definitions of chatä are misleading. It is regularly used as a noun adjunct for things which are long and slender, e.g., drsticchatä (Text 309, line 6 of Loc.), sasidyotacchatä (Udbhata, 2.*15 Induräja), katäksacchatä (SRK 465).2. There is rüpaka (metaphor) in the phrase “if the rays are pencils of am­brosia.” The figure is abandoned in the next clause for sandeha. 3. There is sandeha (poetic doubt) in “or were they long ago infected,” etc. It is aban­doned in the next sentence for nidaréanâ. 4. The phrase “saved by magic syllables in telling over my beloved’s name” (priyatamäsanjalpamanträksarai raksyante) contains the figure nidarsanä. This is the later conception of nidarsanä (from Udbhata onward), more technically called asambhavadvastu- sambhavanibandhanä nidarsanä. This type of nidarsanä occurs where a rela­tion (in the present example the relation between raksyante and priyatamä- sanjalpa) is logically impossible unless we envisage a simile (unless we take the whole phrase to mean priyatamäsanjalpena manträksarair iva raksyante), in which the qualifiers (visesanäni) of the vpamäna and the upameya (in the present instance priyatamä and mantra) appear as image and reflection (bimba and pratibimba) of one another. In general, whenever a rüpaka is extended by viéesanas qualifying the upameya and upamäna such that these visesanas appear as bimba and pratibimba, the figure is called nidarsanä. not rüpaka. In the stanza under discussion the nidarsanä is given up in the question which follows. 5. Apparently the last sentence of the stanza “I know not what to think” (no vedmi keyam gatih) is regarded as reestablishing all three of the preceding possibilities and therefore reviving the three abandoned figures.[ § 2.18-19 g LK That form of suggestion which appears after an interval and which is similar to the reverberation [of a bell] is itself distributed into two varieties: it can be dependent on the [suggestive] power of words (éabdasaktimûla), or it can be dependent on the [suggestive] power of"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"§ 2.21 Introduction A ]A Of suggestion where the literal meaning although intended leads to a further sense, the variety which is similar to a reverberation because the suggested meaning appears at an interval [from the literal meaning] has itself two varieties, one based on the ‘suggestive] power of words and the other on the (suggestive] power of meaning.L Having thus considered the first variety of that suggestion where the literal meaning although intended leads to a further sense, that is. the variety where the sequence is not perceived, he now proceeds to analyse the second variety with the words [that form of suggestion which appears] after an interval.

Samlaksyakramavyangya really has a third variety also, based on both the power of words and the power of meaning.

Short a is the source of all the phonemes, from which comes the Veda, from which comes everything. God (Visnu) in his ultimate form is sabda- brahman, the verbal source of the universe.[ § 2.21 LA But now there is a difficulty. Udbhata has shown1 that even when a separate figure of speech appears [together with slesa (an am­biguity or pun)], that [combination] is to be designated an instance of the figure slesa. So now it appears that there is no domain left for dhvani based on the power of words. In anticipation of this difficulty, the Kârikâ has used the word “implied.\" Here is what is meant. Wher­ever by the power of words a figure of speech appears in addition (to slesa]—this figure being directly denoted—all that is the domain of slesa. But where by the power of words a figure of speech appears in addition [to s7esa], this figure being implied by the inherent capability of the situation (sämarthyäksipta)2 and not directly denoted—in other words, being suggested {vyangya)—all that is the domain of dhvani.The direct appearance by the power of words of a second figure [to­gether with s7esa] may be seen in the following:As even without a necklace they had a natural charm, necklace,in whom did this maiden’s breasts not arouse wonder?3Here a transient state of mind (vyabhicäribhäva) of love, named “won­der,” and the directly expressed figure of speech virodha (contradiction) both appear [together with a pun]. So this is in the domain of slesa favoring the semblance of virodha.4 It is not in the domain of that type of dhvani which is like a reverberation.5 However, it is in the domain of the type of dhvani where the suggestion appears without an interval, the suggestion being here suggested either by the pun or the virodha.6"},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":".21 a L j2yö1. This refers to Udbhata, Induräja 4.10 ( V'ivrti 4.24), where he speaks of alesa as “generating the appearance of other figures of speech” (slistam ... alankäräntaragatäm pratibhdm janayat padaih). Both his commentators inter­pret his words to mean that where we have the impression both of slesa and of some other figure such as upamd or rüpaka one is to identify the figure as slesa only. The reason given is anavakäsatvät, i.e., that élesa has no other scope. It never appears without without the appearance of some other figure, whereas those other figures do have their own spheres where slesa is not present. If we do not ve the overlapping instances to slesa. it will have no scope at all. Another solution, of course, would be to recognize the symbiotic nature of slesa and give it no independent domain. The overlapping instances would then be instances of fusion. In cases where slesa and a second figure are mutu­ally dependent, Abhinava (in his comment on this section; see below) claims that Ananda follows this anti-Ubdhata explanation. But that seems unlikely.2. The translation is clumsy but I cannot find a simpler English phrase that does not falsify the meaning. Sämarthyäksipta. taken most literally, means “implied by the capability [inherent in the situation or in the sentence].” Com­pare 3.30 c L arthasàmarthyàd iti väkyärthasämarthyäd iti yävat (Text 411, Loc. lines 2-3). One may render it less literally by “implied by the available possibilities.\" or “implied by the principle of compatability.” Compatability is one of the glosses given to sämarthya by the grammarians on Pan. 2.1.1.3. The verse occurs without ascription of author in SubhÄ 1534. 4. Theword virodhacchäyä, which we have translated “a semblance of virodha,\" is not a synonym of the later term virodhäbhäsa. Ananda does not mean that the contradition itself is false or merely apparent, but that it forms a false figure. The figure is not really virodha because the dictum of Udbhata (see note 1 above) requires us to identify the figure as slesa. 5. Naturally not, for there is no suggested figure of speech in it. 6. Ananda means that the stanza tasyä vinäpi hdrena suggests srngdrarasa It would thus fall under the type illustrated at 3.4 d A, where rasadhvani is helped out by figures of speech. It is disconcerting, however, to find the actual name of a vyabhicârin (viz., vismaya) given in a stanza which is said to suggest roso, as this goes against the principle laid down in 1.4g A. Presumably Ananda regarded the word as merely incidental. Certainly it does not add to the rasa. Finally, one wonders why Ananda wrote vd (“or”) instead of ca (“and”). Abhinava’s explanation seems unnatural.L To show what the Kârikâ means to exclude by the word “im­plied,” our author begins with a possible objection: B ut even when a separate figure of speech.As even w ithout, etc.: Here the word “even” (api) directly de­notes a contradiction1 and so forces the denotative power (of härinau]"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"296into a double meaning. Härinau may mean “they must2 captivate one’s heart,” or it may mean “possessing a necklace (/idra) . ” 3 And it is because of this [presence of api) that the word vismaya (wonder) strengthens this very sense. For if the word api were not present, there would be no direct denotation of a double meaning, since the natural charm of the maiden’s breasts could be taken as the cause of wonder.4A state of m ind nam ed w onder: he uses this phrase to furnish an illustration. Just as wonder appears directly through the very word ‘wonder\" [and not as suggested by the description of an anubhâva or the like], just so does the figure of contradiction appear directly through the word “even” (api) [and is not a suggested figure]. Now one might doubt that there is any suggestion at all in this stanza. To allay that doubt he says, however, etc. O r by th e wrodhai by the use of “or” he shows that this is a case of the figure fusion composed of an interlocked diesa and virodha, for the word “or” indicates that due to the presence of mutual aid3 there is no basis for rejecting the one and accepting the other.1. When the word api is used, a virodha is said to be directly expresed (vâcya). When it is omitted, the virodha is said to be suggested (vyangya). Thus Rangacharya Raddi Shastri, commenting on Dan din 2.333, quotes Vä- mana’s exemplar verse (KASV 4.3.12.1) and says esa ca apidabdaprayoge vä- cyo, anyathä vyangyah. 2. For the interpretation of the -in suffix (nini) as indicating necessity, see Pan. 3.3.170. 3. Without the word “even” wewould take the word härinau only in the first, its common, sense. The word “even\" makes us look for a contradiction, which we find in the second, un­usual, meaning. 4. As the verse stands, the reader understands it to mean that men wondered at the contradiction, viz., that the maiden’s breasts could have a necklace without having a necklace. If the word “even” were omit­ted, the reader might understand the verse to mean that men wondered at her breasts, which happend to be without a necklace, simply because the breasts were beautiful. 5. The presence of mutual aid (anugrahayog&t): What Abhinava means is that the relation of aider and aided (anugrähyänu- grähakabhäva) between diesa and virodha is mutual. If there were no pun (if, for example, we substituted the the word manoharau for härinau), there would be no contradiction. Again, if the contradiction expressed in api did not make us look for a second meaning, there would be no pun. According to Abhinava, Änanda would go against Udbhata’s dictum (see 2.21 a A, note 1) in such instances and identify the figure not as diesa but as sankara. This is putting words into Änanda’s mouth that he might reject.[ § 2.21a L"},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"§ 2.21 b L ]A A similar instance occurs in a verse of my own:As he holds in his hand the discus “Beautiful”As he is one whose hand is beautiful while her whole body merits praise; as he had stepped across the universe surpassed the universe with the graceful motion of his lotus feet while she had conquered the universe with the grace of every limb: as he bears an eye that is the moon while her whole face is of lunar beauty: it was with reason that Hari regarded RukminT as more precious than his very self, as superior to his own body.I pray that now she give you aid. 1In this stanza alesa appears, favoring a vyatireka (contrast) through its direct expression.1.

The words manosa (heart; also the lake of that name) and däna (gift, or ichor) are puns. In the last quarter of the Prakrit one must read ccia for wia (see Hemacandra, PrdJfc. 2.184). This should be translated by eva, not iva. The word iva would produce upamâ. not rùpaka. It may also be remarked that Sanskrit has trouble in rendering the grammatical number of the Prakrit nouns. As the ending -a represents equally the dual or plural in Prakrit, the war elephants (plural) of the king can be likened to his arms (dual) without any grammatical difficulty. But in Sanskrit with its distinct inflections this would constitute a fault, which the Sanskrit translator has avoided at the expense of giving the king more than two arms. 3.

Water does not normally bring dizziness and death.

Again, in the next line, one should place the danda after prasrta- pratäpasära(h) instead of before.A Where the figure of speech, although implied, is then again directly expressed by some other word [in the stanza], we likewise can­not speak of dhvani in the form of a resonance arising by the power"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"of words. In such cases we must speak of some directly denoted figure such as vakrokti or the like, 1 as in this example:0 Keéava, my eyes were blindmy judgment was blinded with the dust raised by your cattle; by passion for the cowherd;1 could see nothing and so I stumbled;I fell from virtue;why do you not help me up, my lord?why do you not take me as a husband (takes a wife]?You are the one refuge of the weak of womenwhen their hearts fail them on rough roads.in their troubles.Thus did the GopT once express a hint to Hari, who now, I pray, may grant his help to you.3Everything of this sort we would place in the domain of the expressed figure stesa.1. Vakrokti in its stesa variety is the figure exhibited in the verse which follows. Änanda uses the term here in the sense of Rudrata 2.14 and Mammata 9.1 (= süfrn 103), of a specific figure (sabdälaiikära) rather than in the general sense of “ornamented speech” employed by earlier writers. Mammata's defini­tion is “ Vakrokti (crooked speech) is when a sentence expresses one meaning taken in one way and another taken in another, the combination being effected by puns (stesa) or by tone of voice (kaku).\" Vakrokti of the first type is really nothing more than a complex or extended stesa. 2. The stanza is quoted in SüktiM. 2.93, where one MS ascribes it to Tribhuvanapala.300 [ § 2.21 d AL Having thus shown what was meant to be excluded by the word “implied” (äksipta) [in 2 .2 1 K], he now proceeds to show what is excluded by the word “only” (eva): w here th e [figure although im plied], etc. The meaning of this sentence is as follows. When words capable of denoting two senses are employed, if there is no reason for restricting the power of denotation to only one of these senses, as, for example, in the stanza “He who destroyed the cart” [2.21 A), or to take a different situation, when there is some reason [such as the use of words like “even”] which awakens us to the presence of a second power of denotation [which conveys a second sense], as for example in the stanzas beginning from “As even without a necklace” [2.21 a .4] and"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"301extending to “Whose war elephants are his mighty arms” [2.21 c /l], it is of course obvious that that [second] sense is denoted, [not suggested]. But where there is some reason such as the context, which delimits the power of denotation to only one of the two senses, so that the power of denotation cannot extend to the second sense: in such a case the second sense is said to be suggested. Now even in such a case, if a word is then used [in the poem], by which that restrictive factor, such as the context, etc., loses its force, then that power of denotation, although once inhibited from rendering the second sense, is revived so to speak and such cases do not fall in the domain of suggestion. The particle ca [the second word in the sentence of the Vrtti which has just been explained] has the sense of api and has been placed out of position; [it belongs after äksipta]. Thus what is referred to is a figure of speech which, although (api) implied, that is, it begins by giving the immediate impression of being implied, is not really implied, but rather is directly expressed because of the revival of the [second] power of denotation by some other word. The word again (punah) indicates this revival of the power of denotation as explained above. Thus the word “only” (eva) [in Kärikä 2.21] rules out a figure of speech that is apparently, but not really, suggested. This is the meaning.“O Kesava” : here the words have their powers of denotation limited by the context in the following sense. O Kesava, as my eyesight was blinded by the dust raised by [the feet of] the cattle, I could see nothing and because of that I stumbled on the way. Why now, that is, for 1 what possible reason, do you not give me. who have fallen, your hand for support? For you alone, being of extraordinary strength, are the refuge, i.e., the means of support in rough places, for all those who are weak: children, the aged, and women, whose hearts are distressed and who are unable to proceed.But while the context inhibits the denotative powers of the words from the second sense, which will be explained presently, these deno­tative powers are revived by the word salesam “with a hint.” Lesa means something small and. as to hint at something is to make a small [reference] to it, salesam means “with a hint.” The meaning hinted at is this: O Kesava, 0 cowherd, 0 lord of my life! Because my eyes were blinded by passion—or the words may be construed as follows: \"Be­cause I was deprived of my judgment by my passion for Kesava\"1—I stumbled, that is, I became guilty of a moral lapse.

As [in a prose passage]:Meanwhile the long period named Summer,Meanwhile the God of Destruction,when the market stalls are white with the laughterwhose terrible laughter is whiteof their blossoming jasmine flowers,as jasmine flowers,expanded as it put an end to the two months of Spring. 1 yawned as He put an end to the aeons of time.[Bäna, Harsacanta 2, lines 19-20]And as (in a verse]:They are high, with flashing necklaceThey are high, with flashing downpoursand dark with aloe paste:and dark as aloe paste: —whom would the breasts of this slender maidwhom would this wealth of cloudsnot fill with yearning?[Sakavrddhi]5"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"§ 2.21e A }iving joy to all creatures to their progenyby their absorption and release of water, of milk,scattering to all directions in the morning and disappearing at the close of day: and gathering together at the close of day: they are a ship for crossingthe sea of transmigration, the source of our long pain.May these rays of the blazing sun engender May these cowsin your purified selves unmeasured bliss.[Mayüra, Süryasataka 9]3In these examples, by the power of words a second, non-contextual (aprdkaranika), meaning appears. In order that the sentence should not convey a [second] meaning that is unconnected [with the first], one imagines a relation of image and subject (upamäna and upameya) between the non-contextual meaning [e.g., cows] and the contextual meaning [e.g., the rays of the sun], this imagining being made possible by the inherent capability of the situation (sâmarthyât). And so the stesa here is implied by the sense and not furnished by words.4 Thus the domain of that type of dhvani which is like a reverberation is indeed different from that of the [figure of speech] stesa. 11. The figure is rüpaka. We have translated according to Abhinava’s interpretation. On the other hand, the natural way of taking phuilamallikä- dhavalättahäso is as a rüpakasamäsa: “whose white laughter was the blos­soming jasmine.\" But taking that compound as a rüpakasamäsa would make the passage unfit as an example of a sugggested figure of speech. Hence Abhi­nava’s interpretation. Note that the way in which such passages are explained by the Älankärikas may be defended logically but does not satisfy the psy­chological process of our apprehension. Meeting with the passage from Bäna, aträntare dhavalättahäso mahäkälah, etc., the reader immediateely sees what Änanda regards as the suggested sense: ‘’Then Óiva with his terrible laughter,” etc. Only later aind painfully does he absorb the other meaning. To Änanda the direct meaning (säksädväcya) is the contextual meaning. Af­ter all, the story is describing the shift of spring to summer. There is no reason of syntax, no word marking a figure of speech (like iva for upamä, tu for vyatireka. eva for rüpaka), that would make us choose the meaning that refers to éiva the destroyer. So that meaning, which the reader has absorbed"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"304so readily, is to Änanda the suggested meaning. But now for the psychological difficulty. This suggested meaning is defined as samlaksyakramavyangya, that is, a meaning which is apprehended at a moment recognizably later than our apprehension of the denoted meaning. In instances like that of the quotation under discussion, that simply is not true. 2. Here the suggested figure is simile. The girl’s breasts are like clouds. The stanza is quoted by Subhâsitâvalï (1538), which quotes some twelve verses by this same poet. 3. The text of the stanza is uncertain, with the variants aklistasrstaih appearing in a (Dhv. ed. Badari Nath 3arma) and pavanas täh appearing in d (Kävyasamgraha, Vol. 2). For the image of the salvific ship, one may note that the soul of the dying man passes by way of the rays of the sun to release (/sa Up.) and that the cow, being sacred, is sometimes used as a psychopomp, the tail of a cow being placed in the hand of a dying man to lead him to heaven. 4. The slesa in the preceding three examples is furnished by the capability, inherent in the two senses of the stanza, of entering into a relation of upamäna and upameya. The two senses have an inherent similarity. If, for example, the two senses of Mayüra’s stanza did not have this capability, we would not think of taking the words pmjänäm, payobhih, and gävah in two senses. On the other hand, in a verse like “As even without a necklace” (2.21 a A), the slesa in härinau is pointed out by the word api.[ § 2.21e AL Having thus distinguished the domain of the figure of speech slesa, he now explains the domain of suggestion(dAvant): on th e o th er hand, where, etc.(Comment on the first example from Bäna.] The contextual meaning is as follows. The summer puts an end to the two months that con­stitute the season of spring; (the summer,] in which the laughter, that is, the blossoming, the whiteness, of the full-blown jasmine flowers is such as to whiten, to make beautiful, the attäni, that is, the market stalls. If [phullamallikädhavalättahäsa is] explained as [a rüpakasamäsa, viz.,] “(summer) which possesses Siva’s white laughter in the form of full-blown jasmine flowers,” this example would be in no way differ­ent from “cloud serpents” [2.21 b A; it would be a case of a directly expressed metaphor]. It is a “long time” (mahâkâlah), that is, a long season, because its days are- long and hard to endure. Here the de­notative powers of the words are restricted by the context, namely a description of the summer season. For that reason mahäkäla [which as a compound means the destructive form of Siva] and the other [word attahäsa, which as a compound means the wild laughter of éiva] do not follow the maxim that “the denotative power of a compound is stronger"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"305than the denotative power of its components,” but fulfill their deno­tative functions [by furnishing the sense of their component members] in the way we have described. 1 The apprehension of the sense [of the compound] which takes place afterward is the result of the power of suggestion based on the [denotative] power of words.On this problem, some people hold the following view. Inasmuch as these words [mahäkäla, etc.,] have been seen in former contexts to have a different power [from that of mahän kälah, etc.], giving a different sense [from that of “a long season”], it is from that other power which has been seen to give that other sense that the hearer can now appre­hend that sense from these words even when their denotative power is restricted by context, this apprehension being due to the operation of suggestion. Accordingly, there is no contradiction in saying that this sense is a suggested sense based on the [formerly experienced] denota­tive power of the word.2Others say that since the second denotative power [e.g., the power in mahäkäla that furnishes the meaning of \"Siva”] relies for aid on the inherent capability of the situation, namely the similar properties of summer to those of the terrible god, it is therefore said to take the form of a suggestive operation.3Some follow the view that just as sabdaslesa is possible only where two separate words are present, so also in arthaslesa there must be two words because there are two denotations.4 Accordingly, in [both] these cases a second word is bought in. Sometimes this is done by a denotative operation, for example where the answer sveto dhävati is given to two separate questions,5 or in riddles and the like. In these cases the figure [s7esa] is a denoted figure. But where the second word is brought in by a suggestive operation, it is reasonable to regard the meaning understood from the second word as a suggested (pratïya- mäna) meaning because it is based on that which is suggested.6Others say that inasmuch as it is a second denotative power that is revived according to the explanation of the second view [put forth above], the second meaning must be denoted and not suggested. But there appears an identification of this second meaning, after it has been apprehended, with the first, contextual, meaning; and as this identification cannot come from a non-linguistic source, it must come from the suggestive power of the words; because one cannot suppose that any denotative power is responsible for it.7 And this [suggested identification] is based on the second denotative power, for without§ 2.21e L ]"},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"306that power it would not arise.8 Accordingly, it is reasonable to speak of this as the suggestion of a figure of speech (alankäradhvani). And the Vrttikära is about to say, “in order that the sentence should not convey a [second] meaning that is unconnected [with the first].” Now in the previous (examples, where the figure was not suggested,] the lack of connection [in the verse “O Kesava, my eyes were blind”] was prevented by the word salesam “with a hint” ; in the verse “He who destroyed the cart” a lack of connection simply did not appear;9 in the verse “As even without a necklace” the lack of connection was prevented by the word api “even” ; in the verse “As he holds in his hand the discus,” by the word adhika “superior” ; in the verse “The cloud serpents,” by the metaphor-compound [the rüpakasamäsa “cloud-serpents”]. [They say that] this is the overall meaning. 10[Commentary on the verse of Mayura.] The word payobhih means both \"with water” and “with milk” Samhära means “disappearance” and “gathering into one place.” Gävo means “rays” and “cows.”Conveying a m eaning th a t is unconnected: that is, a meaning that is unintelligible. A relation of im age and subject: By this rela­tion, which is in the form [that the figurative operation takes] in simile, one should judge that contrasting [one thing with another], denying [one thing in favor of another], etc., in fact, any form of [suggested] operation, furnishes us with the chief goal of aesthetic delight, rather than the base and simile, etc., [on which these operations work] .11 This consideration applies to all suggested figures of speech.By th e inherent capability of th e situation: that is, by the suggestive operation. 1 21. Other things being equal, one would naturally take mahäkälah to mean Siva. But the present context forces us to take the denoted sense as that of mahän kälah, a long season. If we also apprehend the sense of Siva, that sense must be suggested, for the denotative operation has been completed.2. This is the view accepted by Mammata 2.19 (Jhalkikar ed. p. 63) and by Visvanätha (SD 2.14). 3. This interpretation stays closer to the languageof Änanda. The hearer already knows that mahäkäla can mean Siva. But hearing the word in a context where it must denote a long season, he would not think of the denotation Siva unless there was some similarity in the new context that suggested that other sense. The fact that summer puts an end to a period of time, namely the spring, and Siva puts an end to a period of time, namely the aeon, constitutes the similiarity that allows the sugges­tion to operate. 4. This is the view of Udbhata as is also the peculiar distinction t>f sabdaslesa and arthaslesa. Udbhata defines slesa, by which he[ § 2.21e L"},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"307means a sticking together, an adhesion, of two meanings or of two similar sound groups, in 4.9-10 Induräja (4.23-24 Vivrti): ekaprayatnoccdrydndm tacchäydm caiva bibhratäm / svaritddigvnair bhinnair bandhak slistam iho- cyate / / alankäräntaragatäm pratibhäm janayat padaih / dvividhair artha- sabdoktivisistam tat pratiyatäm / / ‘The use of expressions that have identical phonetic shape, or of expressions that seem to have identical shape because their differences are in properties such as the Vedic accent, is called slista (= stesa). This figure produces the appearance of other figures by means of word-pairs of these two types and is to be understood as characterized by a (conjoined] expression of meanin or of sound-groups [i.e.. as artha- slesa or sabdaslesa.” The commentators explain that in Udbhata’s view there must be a separate word (padam) for every meaning. Thus, if kara is used to mean both “hand\" and “ray,” we have two words of identical phonetic shape. This usage he calls arthaslesa, adhesion of meaning, for two mean­ings adhere together in one phonetic datum. On the other hand, when the expression asvdpaphala is used to mean both \"producing a result that is not easily obtained’f (a-su-âpam phalam yasya) and “the result of lack of sleep” (a-svàpa-phalam), we do not have two words of identical phonetic shape. Ac­cording to Pan. 6.2.172 the former will be accented asvâpaphalà (a negative bahuvrihi has terminal accent), while by Pan. 6.2.139 the latter will be ac­cented asvdpaphala (in a tatpvrusa the final member takes its natural accent). This usage Udbhata calls sabdaslesa, adhesion of sound, for two sound-units adhere so as to appear identical. Udbhata’s two types are almost equivalent to Dandin’s abhinnapada and bhinnapada. Udbhata’s terminology is infelicitous because both types depend on sound and this terminology was abandoned by the later Älankärikas whose works are preserved to us. But the commentator from whom Abhinava is here quoting apparently accepted it. 5. The two questions are ka ito dhdvati “what is running hither?” and kimvarno dhd- vati “What color is the thing that is running?” The answer to the first is iveto (svd ito) dhdvati “A dog is running hither”; to the latter sveto dhdvati “Something white is running.” The second word (sveto “white”) is brought in by denotative operation. The question demands that some color be denoted. The example goes back to Patanjali, Mahdbhdsya, Intr. to 1.1.1 (Kielhorn Voi. 1, p. 14) and 8.2.3 (Kielhorn Voi. 3, p. 388). 6. Context demandsthat mahdkdlah apply to summer. So the “first word\" denotes a long season. But we have previously heard a “second word” of identical phonetic shape, which means Siva. If we now understand the meaning éiva also, it is because the second word has been brought in by suggestion. Vdcya and pmtiyamdna are used, like srauta and drtha, of that which is expressed and that which is understood (suggested). 7. Because the denotative powers are used up in furnishing the first and second meanings. 8. The suggested identification is not furnished (utpddita) by a denotative power because the denotative powers are now exhausted. But it is based on, that is, it presupposes, a denotative§ 2 .2 1 e L ]"},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"308power. Specifically it presupposes the second denotative power because one cannot have the relation of identity without having a second term to identify with the first. 9. Both meanings of the verse furnish praise of God and so both are contextual. There is no non-contextual meaning in the stanza which could exhibit a disconnection.10. According to BP this view (the fourth view of “others” given by Abhinava) is accepted by Appayya Dlksita in his Kuvalayänanda. 11. In characterizing suggested figures of speech Änanda spoke merely of our being forced to imagine a similarity. Abhinava extends his statement, taking it as an upaiaksana of other relations which we may be forced to imagine. He then points out that this imagining of various relations is what gives the chief aesthetic value to this species of dhvani. In denoted figures of speech our pleasure ends with the apprehension of the objects which are brought into relation by the figure, e.g., the subj t (upameya) and the image (upamäna). In suggested figures of speech we receive a special relish from imagining the relations.[ § 2.21e LA Other figures of speech as well [as simile] can occur in this type of suggestive poetry that is based on the power of words and where the suggested meaning is like the reverberation of a bell. Thus, contradiction {virodha) may appear in the form of a reverberation based on the power of words, as in Bhattä Bäna’s description of the land called Sthänvlsvara:where the women have the [slow] gait of elephants have affairs with outcastes,and are virtuous,are of fair complexion and fond of wealth,are Gaurîs and are fond of places where âiva is absent,are youthful and wear rubies,are black and have the red color of lotuses,have mouths that are bright with white teethhave mouths as pure as those of pure brahminsand breaths that are perfumed with wine.[Bâna.Harsacanfa, p. 98, lines 3-4] (Chapter 3, iines 228-229 out of 654)"},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"309For in this example one cannot say that the contradiction is directly expressed or that the puns favoring the semblance of contradiction are denoted; because the figure contradiction is not directly revealed by any word [such as “although\"]. For where the figure of contradiction is directly expressed by a word, in such a poetic expression of ambiguity we have the domain of a denoted figure of speech, either contradiction (virodha) or pun (slesa).An example may be given from the same work of Büna:She was the meeting place as it were of contradictions,for her figure was brilliantfor there was the figure of the sunalthough accompanied by the blackness of her hair.even in the presence of the young night.[Bäna, Harsacarita, p. 27, line 15] (Chapter 1, line 403 out of 689)Or, [one may see an example of suggested contradiction] in a verse of my own own:Bow down to the sole refuge of men, the everlasting, to the soie house of men that is no house, the overlord, the lord of our thoughts, the non-lord of thoughts that is lord of our thoughts,Hari-Krishna, fourfold of nature,1 beyond all action, the golden, the black, of dexterous self who does not act, the destroyer of enemies who bears the wheel, the destroyer of the spoke-holder who bears the wheel.For in this verse contradiction in the form of a [suggested] reverberation based on the power of words is clearly understood.Contrast (vyatireka) of the same sort also appears i of my own:May both sets of the sun god’s feet lead you to welfare[those which are his rays and those on which he stands):those which light up the sky, dispelling darkness,and those whose toenails are refulgent;and those which do not illumine the sky;those which nourish the beauty of the pond lotusand those whose beauty puts the lotuses to shame;those which shine on the tops of mountainsthose which shine on the heads of kingsand those which tread on the heads of the immortals.§ 2.21 f A ]"},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"310In the sänne way there are other varieties of dhvani based on the power of words where the suggested meaning is like the reverberation of a bell. They may be sought out by sensitive readers on their own. I have not dealt with them here in detail lest my book should become too extensive.A reference to the four emanations (vyüÄas) of Visnu.[ § 2.21 f AL [Commentary on the first quotation from Bâna.] [Mâtanga- gäminyah] means they walk like elephants. The contrast [with what follows] lies in the [second] meaning “they visit outcastes.” “They delight in wealth” also means they take delight in a place where 3iva is absent. “They possess the gems called padmarâga (rubies)\" also [means] they have the red color (rapo) of lotuses (padma). “Their mouths are pure,” that is, bright “with white teeth (dvija)” also [means] their mouths are as pure as those of pure, that is, the most exalted, brahmins (dvija).For where: namely in a poetic expression of ambiguity [where the contradiction is directly expressed], there we have the domain of con­tradiction (virodha) or pun (slesa), that is to say, of the figure fusion (samkara).* He means that this [figure in such instances] becomes the domain—of what?—of a denoted figure of speech, of a denoted ornament. The meaning is, it becomes the domain of something which possesses the property of a denoted figure of speech.2 This is as much as to say that it is only in such cases that one may rightly call the contradiction or the pun a denoted figure.[Commentary on the second quotation from Bâna.] Night, that is, blackness, was in her hair (vàia), or the night, that is, darkness, was young (bàia), new.Now it might be objected that in the passage “Where the women have the gait of elephants,” etc., the particle ca (“and”) being used with the pairs of properties actually expresses the contradiction. For if a mere additive sense had been intended, ca would have been used with each property separately, or would have been used just once at the end, or would not have been used at all.3 With this objection in mind, he furnishes another example: or.How can a sarana, a house, be in the form of a-ksaya, a non-house? How can he who is not dhisa, lord of our thoughts, be lord of our thoughts? How can he who is golden (hari) be black (krsna)?

How can he who is the destroyer of that which possesses spokes proudly bear the wheel?C ontradiction: the word virodha here means contradiction in gen­eral [not the expressed figure of speech virodha}.* Is understood: what he has in mind is that it is clearly understood but is not expressed by any word.[Commentary on the final verse.] “Those whose toenails are resplen­dent” also means “which certainly do not shine in the sky.” “Both” [sets of feet] means those which are his rays and those which are limbs composed of toes, heel, etc.1. I.e., such an instance falls into the category of the figure fusion. See above, 2.21a A, note 1 and 2.21a L, note 4. 2. I.e., such a case of thefigure fusion falls into the category of a denoted figure of speech. 3. The same effect appears in English. If I say, “He is wise and young, handsome and not proud,” I am emphasizing the contradictions as I would not do if I used the word “and” three times, or jiist once (before “not proud\"), or not at all.4. The reason for Abhinava’s gloss is that in his view the suggested figure is sankara, not virodha.§ 2.22 A ]K On the other hand, we have another type of [dhvani] that arises from the power of meaning ( arthasaktyudbhava) when a meaning appears which by itself and without [the use of] words, manifests a second meaning as the tätparya (the chief meaning of the sentence).A Where a meaning by its own inherent capability manifests, without the operation of words, another meaning, we have that variety of dhvani, arising from the power of meaning, where the suggested meaning is similar to a reverberation. For example:While the heavenly visitor was speaking, Pârvatï, standing with lowered face beside her father, counted the petals of the lotus in her hand.[Kälidäsa, KumSam. 6.84]"},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"312For here the counting of the petals of the lotus subordinates itself and without the help of any verbal operation reveals another matter in the form of a transient state of mind (vyabhicäribhäva) [of the emotion love, namely shyness]. This example does not fall under the sole heading of “suggestion without a perceived interval” (alaksyakramavyangya), for it is only where we apprehend the rasa or the like directly (sâksât, i.e., immediately) through a verbal presentation of the vibhävas, anubhävas, and vyabhicâribhâvas that we have a suggestion that is exclusively of that type, 1 as for example in the Kumärasambkava where, in the con­text of the advent of spring, we have the description of events beginning with the arrival of Pârvatï wearing spring flowers for jewelry, up to the point where the god of love places an arrow on his bow and takes aim at Siva. All this, as well as the description of the particular actions of Siva as his calmness is stirred, is conveyed directly by words. But in the present example the rasa is apprehended through its transient state of mind, which in turn is implied by the inherent capability [of the described action of counting the lotus petals, etc.]. Therefore this is a different variety of dhvani.1. Note that Änanda will admit, in 3.43 A, that this stanza does contain rasadhvani, for the suggestion of the shyness leads on to an apprehension of the rasa, srngâra. In the stanza the two varieties of dhvani, he says, are fused. What he says here is that the stanza does not contain rasadhvani only (alaksyakramavyangyadhvani). It also contains a suggestion of perceived interval, namely the suggestion of shyness.The phrase säksäcchabdanivedita used here and three lines below has long caused difficulty. Srïdhara in commenting on the Kâvyaprakâsa (Vol. 1, p. 128) attributed the phrase to Änanda’s temporary forgetfulness or inattention. For modern discussions of the passage, in addition to Jacobi's note, ZDMG 56 (1902), p. 766, see K. Krishnamoorthy, The Dhvanyäloka and its Critics, p. 266, and M. V. Patwardhan and J. L. Masson, “Solution to a Long-confused Issue in the Dhvanyäloka,” JOlBaroda 22 (1972-73), pp. 48-56, to which Krishnamoorthy has replied in a long note to his text and translation of the Dhv., pp. 354-360.The difficulty is this. Änanda has already said (1.4 g A) that rasa and the like (rasädi) are never sâksâcchabdàvyâpâmvisaya, that is, never the object of the direct (denotative) operation of words; they are always suggested. And within the term “and the like\" the bhâvas and vyabhicâribhâvas are included. If we take säksäcchabdanivedita in the present sentence to mean “where the vyabhicârins are conveyed by direct denotation, or actually named,\" we will have to charge Änanda with flatly contradicting one of his most basic theories. Furthermore, in the passages of the Kumârasambhava to which he refers as[ § 2.22 A"},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"exemplifications of alakayakrama, the vyabhicàribhàvas axe nowhere directly named.Abhinava’s solution, followed by Patwardhan and Masson in the article just referred to, is to connect the sense of the adverb säksät more closely with pratiyate than with sabdaniveditebhyo. It is when we apprehend the suggestion directly, that is, immediately, from the description of the vibhävas, anubhävas and vyabhicârms that we have the type of suggestion where the interval is not perceived (asamlaksyakramavyangyadhvani). In Ânanda’s judgment the verse which describes Pâxvatï’s counting the petals of the lotus does not belong in that category. He feels that we must reflect for a moment before we realize that what is being described is really the shyness of young love. So he assigns the verse to the samlaksyakrama type.Abhinava’s solution becomes somewhat more difficult in the passage three lines below, where säksäcchabdanivedita is used without the verb pratiyate, the sense of which must be understood. That is, we must understand “con­veyed by direct words\" to mean “conveyed by words which give an immediate understanding of the suggestion.” Difficult or not, this interpretation fits with the whole tenor of Ânanda’s aesthetics. We can now charge him perhaps with inexactitude of expression (Srïdhara’s inattention) but not with a lapse of theory (ârîdhara’s forgetfulness).§ 2.22 L ] 313L Having in this way dealt with that variety oidhvani where the suggestion- rests on the power of words, he now proceeds to explain the variety that depends on the power of meaning: [On th e o th er hand], etc. A nother: sc., other than that which rests on the power of words. By itself [manifests] as th e tätparya: This word (tät- parya), being followed as it is by a denial of the denotative function [in the words vktim vinâ], must refer to the suggestive process, not to the tätparyasakti (the power belonging to the syntax of the sentence), for we have already said [1.4 b L] that the power belonging to the syntax of the sentence has exhausted itself once we have understood the literal sense.With this same intention he now says in the Vrtti: W here a m ean­ing by its own inherent capability. The term “by itself” (svatah) of the Kärikä has'been rendered by “its own” (sva) in the Vrtti. He now explains the significance of “without words\": w ithout th e oper­ation of words. He illustrates: For exam ple “While [the heavenly visitor], etc.”A no th er m atter: shyness. D irectly: the meaning here intended is that the vyabhicârins are “directly conveyed” where our perception"},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"314of them arises from their appropriate vibhâvas and anubhävas with­out anything’s being interposed, inasmuch as we do not perceive any interval [between the literal and suggested meanings]. Hence there is no contradiction with what was stated before [in 1.4g A]. For it was stated before at some length that the vyabhicäribkävas, being emotional manifestations (bhävas), cannot be conveyed by being directly named (svasabdatah). This is as much as to say that although rasa, bhäva, and the like are invariably suggested and never directly expressed, still they are not always in the domain of that type of suggestion where the interval [between the literal and suggested meanings] is not perceived. We have that type of suggestion only in those cases where the sugges­tion of rasa and the like occurs immediately from the full presentation of the vibhâvas and anubhävas belonging to the sthäyibhävas and the xnjabhicäribhävas. For example:Then came the daughter of the mountain king with her attendant nymphs. Her loveliness seemed to rekindle in the god of love his near extinguished courage.[KumSam. 3.52]In this and the following stanzas there is a full description of [Pârvatî’s] nature which is well suited to act both as an objective and a stimulative determinant (älambanavibhäva and uddïpanavibhâva.)1We are told how these vibhâvas take effect in the stanza:As éiva, favoring his devotee, moved to accept the offering, the love-god fitted to his flowery bow the deadly shaft Infatuation.[KumSam. 3.66][ § 2.22 LBut Siva, stirring slightly from his cal as the ocean stirs at moonrise, busied his eyes on Umä’s face and her fruit-like lower lip.[KumSam. 3.67]First we have been told of Pârvatï’s inclination toward éiva and now we are told of éiva’s turning his attention toward Pärvatl. His prej­udice in her favor has been indicated as a “favoring of his devotee.\""},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"315Prom a strengthening of this prejudice comes the basic emotion (sthdyi- bhâva) love (rati). The author has revealed all the symptoms (anu- bhâvas) common to this basic emotion and to its transient states of mind (vyabhicärins) eagerness, agitation (ävega), instability (cäpaiya), and the like. And so our relish of the determinants (vibhävas) and the symptoms ends up as (paryavasyati) a relish of the transient states of mind. And as the transient states of mind are dependent [on the basic emotion], there is no perceived interval between our relishing of them and our aesthetic goal of relishing the basic emotion, which is like the string of a garland [of which the transient states are the separate flowers].But in the stanza which our author is discussing, a young maiden’s counting of lotus petals and lowering her face can be imagined as due to other causes [such as inattention or naivete] and so do not cause our heart to fix immediately on shyness [as her state of mind]. Rather, these acts suggest the idea of shyness in love only after the reader calls to mind the earlier incidents [of the poem], such as Pârvatï’s asceticism [undertaken in order to win Siva as her husband]. So the suggestion of [the accompanying emotion] shyness comes after a perceived interval.The rasa in the stanza is also removed, but as it appears the moment that the true nature of [Pârvatï’s] state of mind has been realized, it is not at a perceived interval from that. The suggestion of perceived interval in this stanza is with respect to the shyness. This is what our author has meant to indicate by his use of the words “sole” (eva) and “exclusive” (kevala).2 11. Pârvatï herself acts as the älambanambhäva; her physical qualities act as the vddïpanavibhâvas. 2. There is no strict or exclusive asamlaksya- kramadhvani in the lotus petal stanza because while the rasa is asamlaksya- krama from the vyabhicärin, the vyabhicärin is samlaksyakrama from the presentation of the anubhäva. To put the matter in simpler form: there is a perceived interval between the presentation of the anubhäva (counting the lotus petals) and the suggestion of the vyabhicärin (shyness); there is no perceived interval between the suggestion of shyness and the suggestion of the rasa of love. This is a subtle distinction, which permits Abhinava to say that the rasa itself is always suggested without interval even when it “stands far off” (düratah) by reason of its transient emotion’s being suggested at an interval.§ 2.22 L ]"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"[ § 2.22 a AA But a meaning which is aided by the [denotative] operation of words in suggesting a second meaning does not fall in this category [of suggestion by the power of meaning]. For example:Knowing that her gallant had set his heart on a rendezvous, the subtle lass smiled and to show her meaning folded the petals of the lotus in her hand.1Here we are expressly told of the suggestiveness of the girl’s folding up the lotus blossom with which she is playing.1. As lotuses close their petals at sundown, she means that he is to meet her at that time. Änanda quotes the stanza again at 3.34 A as an example of aiaksyakramagunïbhùtavyangya. The suggestion is the fact that her lover should come at night. We arrive at the suggested meaning immediately. The stanza is also found annonymously in SvbhÄ. 2043. Dandin has a very similar stanza, KA 2.261.L He proceeds to show what is sought to be excluded by the Kärikä's phrase “without [the use of] words”: B ut a m eaning, etc. The particle ca (“and”) here has the sense of “but.” In this [cate­gory]: he has in mind that it may, however, fall in [a different category, namely] that of suggestion where the interval is not noticed.1 He illus­trates: “Knowing that her gallant, etc.”T he suggestiveness: sc., that evening will be the right time [for the rendezvous]. Expressly told: sc., by the first three lines. It is true that no one word in these three lines, even in connection with its neighbors, has the power of denoting the sense of “evening,” and to that extent the suggestiveness of the stanza is not undone. However, we are expressly told that the sense is suggestive of some other sense and thereby the very life of suggestion, which consists of the charm of something’s being said in a hidden manner, is destroyed.

Jagannäth Päthak translates it into Hindi: maim gambhir hüm, bina batâe marâ kâm koï bhï nahim jäntä, (is lie) kuch kahtä hum, “I am a deep man. No one knows of my doings unless I give a hint, (therefore) I say something.” BP punctuates so as to get a very different sense: “I am not a deep man. Therefore no one knows my intention although it is indicated [by my expression). So I will say something.” Päthak may be right. BP, I am sure, is wrong.§ 2.23 A ]K When a meaning, even though it has been implied by the power of words or meanings, is then again revealed by the poet in so many words, it is [to be considered as] a figure of speech and different from dhvani.A When a meaning, even though it has been implied by the power of words, by the power of meaning, or by the power of words and meaning, is then again proclaimed in so many words by the poet, it is [to be considered as] a figure of speech and different from this type of dhvani that is like a reverberation.

Have done with this exhausting stretching of your limbs.\" the proud destroyer of Bala [Indra].”Thus Ocean, under guise of calming Laksmi's fear, for she was dazed by the churning of the sea, caused her to reject the other gods and gave her to him who now, I pray, may bum away your sins.3An example of a meaning implied by the power of meaning [and then revealed] is:\"That’s where my aged mother sleeps, and there sleeps daddy, the oldest man you’ve ever met.Here sleeps the slave-girl worn out by her chores, and here sleep I, who must be guilty to deserve these few days absence of my lord.\"By these statements the youthful wife suggested to the the traveler his opportunity.4[Rudrata?]An example of a meaning implied by both powers is “O Kesava, my eyes were blind” [2.21 d A]. 11. The genitive alaksyakramavyangyasya goes naturally with sambhave and tâdrs refers most naturally to alaksyakramavyangya. There is no need for the grammatical gymnastics employed by Abhinava (see below). 2. Vertical motion is a basic characteristic of fire in the Vaisesika system ( VS 5.2.13) and is used as an epithet of fire in poetry (e.g., Éisupâlavadha 1.2). 3. Thestanza is quoted anonymously in SüktiM. 3.65 and under Kuv. 155. Laksmi was among the precious objects churned up by the gods from the sea. The motion might well have left her out of breath and trembling. For jrmbhita, context as well as the opinion of Abhinava favors the meaning of stretching the limbs (angasammardana.) rather than yawning; see also 2.18-19 b A, note 1. The ocean is pictured as Laksmï’s father, comforting her and by puns directing her away from all suitors but her future husband, Visnu.

We may take the main purport of the stanza to be a relish (srngärarasäbhäsa) of the poet’s love of Visnu ( Visnuvisayakaratibhäva) of which the stimulant ( uddipanavibhäva) would be Visnu's qualities which are here suggested to be superior to those of all the other gods by the fact that LaksmT chose him for her husband.4. The reading avasara in line d is found in ancient quotations of the stanza only here and in RG. With this reading a literal translation of the line will be: ‘Thus was the traveler addressed by the young woman with a hint of his opportunity in her statements.” Most ancient quotations (SRK 812, Sad- ukti. 2.15.3, Aufrecht ZDMG 36, 539) read abhimatam: the wife informed the traveler of her intention. SubhÄ. 2247 reads avasatha (resting place): the young wife spoke to the traveler under the pretext of stating the resting places (of the members of her family]. The verse is variously ascribed in the anthologies to Rudrata or Bhatta. The two authors: Rudrata, author of the Kävyälankära, and Rudra Bhatta, author of the Érngàratilaka are constantly confused in the-anthologies. As Rudra Bhatta was apparently of later .date than Anandavaxdhana (see Kane HSP, pp. 149-151), it is Rudrata that has the best claim to the verse.§ 2.23 L ]L The author of the Vrtti wishes in a single construction to resume the foregoing two types of suggestion and to indicate a third type. Accordingly, he introduces the Kârikâ with a phrase that serves both purposes: and in th e sam e way.1 The meaning is that together with the aforementioned two types a third type must be considered.' (In the Kärikä] sabdärtha is an ekasesa compound.2 Different: it is not a suggestion but an (expressed] figure of speech such as stesa. Or, taking “suggestion” (dhvani) [in the Kärikä] to mean suggestion with an unperceived interval, this suggested meaning can be considered an ornament of that suggestion to which it is subordinated, an ornament that is different from merely expressed figures of speech and one that forms a second, far superior (lokottara) type of figure of speech. He will explain the passage in these two ways in the Vrtti.3(Comment on the first verse.) Visäda (distress) [also] means eater of poison. “Of vertical motion” refers to Fire. [To obtain a satisfactory pun] one must understand the \" word “and” [as connecting svasanam and ürdhvapravritam]. Kampah (trembling) (also] means lord (pah) of waters (kam). Or [why] choose kah, that is, Brahma, your ancestor (guru)?4 Have done with balabhid, that is, Indra, who is jrmbhita, drunk with the pride of his sovereignty; that is [one] meaning. Jrmbhita also means a stretching of the limbs, which is balabhid, that is. destructive"},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"320of one’s strength because it causes exertion. By the word “rejection” (pratyäkhyäna) we are informed that a second set of meanings is de­noted by the words. “Having caused her”:5 now Laksmï had arisen from the sea with a desire for Pundarlkäksa (= Visnu) in her heart and so she naturally [would have] rejected the other gods; but because of the delicacy of her constitution she was in a state of shock from the crashing waves churned up by Mt. Mandara and was brought to do what was natural to her only by her father’s reminder in the form of his revealing the faults of the other gods and his saying, “Come hither (come to this one, [Visnu])\" with a gesture indicating his respect for all the virtues [of her future spouse]. That is why the poet says “dazed by the churning.” The structure of the sentence is this. May he burn away your sins, to whom Ocean gave Laksmï after causing, under the guise of stilling her fears in the manner described, her, who was dazed from the churning, to rejet the other gods.[T hat’s w here m y aged] m other [sleeps]: the suggestiveness of the individual words in this stanza can easily be imagined by a sensitive reader, so we refrain from explaining them in so many words. The phrase “with a hint of” constitutes the direct expression which is the statement of the poet himself.6Under the guise of sum m ing up7 [what has gone before], our author has described and illustrated two varieties of suggestion. He now pro­ceeds to mention a third variety: im plied by both powers. [The stanza “O Kesava, my eyes are blind” contains sequential suggestion by] the power of words because of the puns in goparäga [“the dust raised by your cattle” or “passion for the cowherd”], etc.; the power of meaning because of the context.8 For so long as it is not known that Krishna is the object of the intense, secret love of all the young women [of Gokula], the second sense [i.e., the suggested sense] cannot be per­ceived. The word salesam ( “with a hint” ) is the statement of the poet himself. 11. “In the same way\" (tathä) refers to the foregoing two types “based on the power of words” and “based on the power of meaning.” “And\" (ca) indi­cates that there exists a further, third type “based on the power of words and meaning.” 2. Pan. 1.2.64. Just as vrksäh can be analyzed into vrksa-vrksa- vrksäh = vrksas ca vrksas ca vrksas ca, so sabdärthah can be analyzed into sabdas ca arthas ca sabdärthas ca. 3. Änanda explains the Kärikä phrase sänyaivälaiikrtir dhvaneh in two ways, but not in the two ways described by Abhinava. There is no need to take dhvaneh in the Kärikä as a genitive as well as an ablative. It appears as a genitive in the second explanation of the Vrtti[ § 2.23 L"},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"321simply because it is in construction with sambhave. Nor is there any reason to suppose that Änanda made a value distinction between the alaiikara involved in the first interpretation and that involved in the second. 4. Abhinava here discovers still another pun. which we have not rendered in the transla­tion. The interrogative kasmai in RV 10.121 “To whom shall we offer the oblation?” was understood as a name of Brahma. Brahma would be an im­possible choice as husband for LaksmI a? he was her grandfather. 5. BP- Abhinava is taking the causative suffix ntc in the sense of causing a person to do what he is naturally about to do, not in the sense of setting him on a course which he has not begun on; because this interpretation is harmonious with the rasa of the verse. 6. The statement \"proclaimed in so many words by the poet,” as A has put it, which gives away the suggestion. 7. The phrase upasamhäravyäjena may mean little more than “by way of summing up.” But we have taken it at full value. Änanda has actually done more than sum up what had been said before. His examples of sequential suggestion that fails or is spoiled by open revelation give us a fuller knowledge of this type of suggestion. 8. A knowledge of context, of course, is necessary in sabdasaktyudbhavadhvani also. But it is a particular kind of context that Ab­hinava has in mind, as his next sentence shows. The knowledge of Krishna's character permits the arthasaktyudbhavadhvani here just as the knowledge of the gay housewife’s character permits the same type of suggestion in “That’s where my aged mother sleeps.” 1§ 2.24 A ]K A meaning that reveals a second fact [or situation, vastu) is also of two kinds. It may be given body simply by an imaginative expression (praudhokti),* or it may be inherently possible (svatah sam- bhavin).1. For an explanation of praudhokti based on the etymology of the word, see Abhinava below. The term is used of a sophisticated, striking (camat- käränuguna) expression arising from the poet’s imagination rather than from the data directly-presented by the everyday world. We translate it by “imag­inative expression,\" but the term always connotes boldness, vividness, fancy, and the irreality of what is expressed.A In the type of suggestive poetry that is like a reverberation, ithin the variety that is based on the power of meaning, the suggestive"},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"322meaning is itself of two types: the first, which is given body simply by an imaginative expression of the poet or of a character created by the poet; and the second, which is inherently possible. An example of the type which is given body simply by an imaginative expression of the poet is:The fragrant month prepares,but gives not yet for his use against young maids,the arrows, pointed with mango budand feathered with new leaves, to the god of love. 1An example of the type which is given body by an imaginative ex­pression of a speaker created by the poet is the verse already quoted •‘On what mountain, for how long\" [see 1.13m A]. Or,Attentive youthhas lent a hand to your breaststhat they might rise as it were to greetthe visitor love.2The type that is inherently possible occurs when the fact can be imagined as appropriate in the world of reality, a fact the substance of which is not produced only by a turn of phrase. An example is the verse we have quoted “While the heavenly visitor was speaking” [2.22 A]. Or, The hunter’s wife strolls proudly with peacock feather behind her ear.She strolls amid fellow wives who are decked with pearls.3[Satfosaf 2.73] 11. The stanza describes the earliest days of spring before its full effect is seen. For similar descriptions see SRK 164 and 166. The syntax follows the metrical pattern. That is, there is a syntactic break after surahimäso-, the words na dava are to be construed with what follows. By failing to observe this, Jacobi’s translation misses the point of the stanza. In line b the alternate reading lakkhasahe given by BP is better than lakkhamuhe., as it avoids the repetition of the word muhe. V. V. Mirashi in “Some Royal Poets of the Väkätaka Age,” IHQ 21, pp. 196ff, ascribes this verse to the Harivijaya of the royal poet Sarvasena, for whom see below 3.10-14 e A. There is no compelling reason for the ascription, but the verse is written in the literary dialect and has the simple charm of other verses of that author. 2. The author is not known. Literally, “An abhyutthäna (rising to meet a guest) has been given to Love by your swelling breasts, an abhyutthäna that has the support, respectfully bestowed (vitïrna), of the hand of Youth.” 3.

Abhinava will explain the suggestions of this little stanza below.§ 2.24 L ]L In this way the author has so far given a general definition of suggestion that arises from the power of meaning. He has also explained that its province is separate from that of figures of speech such as slesa and the like. He now proceeds to explain its subdivisions: It m ay be given body, etc. The meaning which [in the K ärikä] is said to reveal, that is, to suggest, another meaning is also of two kinds. Not only is reverberatory suggestion [i.e., samlaksyakramadhvani] of two kinds [viz., based on the power of words and based on the power of meaning], but even its second variety is of two kinds through the dichotomy of the suggestive meaning. That is the force of the word also.(In the Vrtti] he states that imaginative expression also has subvari­eties: of th e p o et [or o f a character]. Hence there are three varieties of the suggestive meaning.1 Praudha is formed of pra in the sense of highly, extremely (prakarsena) and üdhah “carried out,” that is, [of a meaning, when it is] fully competent for the matter to be conveyed; so praudha means effective. An expression also is called praudha when it is appropriate to the matter to be conveyed.[Abhinava gives a Sanskrit translation of the MähärästrT verse “The sweet month.” He then comments.] Here spring, figured as a sentient being and the friend of the god of love, only prepares but does not give over [the arrows to his friend]. By this expression, which is effective in conveying the meaning which should be conveyed, that stage of spring is referred to when the mango is just coming into bud. It is hereby suggested that the depredations of love are just beginning and that they will gradually grow stronger and stronger. If, on the other hand, the poet had written, “In the spring the mango begins to bud and leaf,” he would have stated a fact that suggests nothing. This is an imaginative expression of the poet speaking in his own person.2“On what mountain” : here if the poet had written “the parrot bites a red bimba fruit,” there would be no suggestiveness at all. But when there is an imaginative expression of this sort contained in the stanza, spoken by a young man of the poet’s invention, who is filled with desire, there is suggestiveness."},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"324[Abhinava gives a Sanskrit translation of the MähärästrT stanza “At­tentive youth” and then comments.] Here the girl’s breasts have be­come great persons, but love is worthy of still greater respect, so they are figuratively said to rise up to greet him; and youth acts as their attendant servant. By this striking expression the speaker’s intention is indirectly suggested: that “every man will fall deeply in love with you as soon as he sees your breasts.” If he had said, “Your breasts are high because of your youth,” there would be no suggestion.Not [produced] only by: this phrase implies that strikingness of expression is always useful.[Abhinava translates the MähärästrT stanza “The hunter’s wife” and then comments.] In his attachment to her the most that he can do is kill a peacock. When attached to his other wives, he killed even elephants.3 Thus the success in love (or sexual attractiveness, saubhâgya) [of the new wife] is suggested [ukta, i.e., vyanjita] by the wording of the stanza. By saying that the other wives are decked with pearl ornaments, that is, possess pearl ornaments which are variously arranged, it is suggested that because these wives are not preoccupied with sexual enjoyment their major occupation is a display of skill in the arrangement of these ornaments, which in turn suggests that now [after the arrival of the new wife] they suffer the greatest neglect. One need not fear that the poet’s statement that she is “proud” gives away the suggestion, because it is possible for the wife’s pride to come from the ignorance of youth or the like [and not from a realization of her success in love]. This matter, as it is described, or put aside the description and suppose that one were to see it directly in the external world, suggests the great success in love of the hunter’s wife. [Hence it is an inherently possible situation.]4 11. Abhinava soon overlooks the subvarieties of praudhokti and will speak of “the two varieties of suggestion arising from the power of meaning,” 2.25 L, first sentence. Of later authors Hemacandra {AC, p. 73) denies explicitly, and Jagannätha (RG, p. 136) implicitly, that there are three types. 2. Spring is not really a sentient being and does not prepare and hand over or refrain from handing over arrows to the god of love. 3. Later commentators note that the elephants would be farther off in the forest, with the result that killing them would require of the hunter a longer renunciation of his amorous sports. 4. I should prefer a simpler explanation of the stanza. The young bride might well be proud of her peacock feathers, for they are the very hallmark of a hunter, worn next to his body, around his waist (see KumSam. 1.15). But Abhinava’s explanation is essentially the same as that given by Ananda under 3.1 i A and it remains the explanation invariably given by[ § 2.24 L"},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"325later commentators. Also in its favor is the large number of similar verses in Prakrit. See the whole of Section 22, on hunters, in the Vajjälagga, together with Patwar- dhan's translations and notes.§ 2.25 L ]K Also where a new figure of speech is understood by the power of meaning, we have another variety of suggestive poetry in which1 the suggested sense is like the reverberation (of a bell].21. In the Kärikä the relative clause modifies prakärsah (variety). In the Vrtti it modifies dhvanih (suggestion). The difference in meaning is min­imal. 2. In the previous four examples of sequential suggestion arising by the power of meaning (arthasaktyudvhavasamlaksyakramaityangyadhvani) a meaning suggested a fact or situation (an artha suggested a vastu). The present Kärikä shows that a meaning may also suggest a figure of speech (an artha may suggest an alankära).A Where a new figure of speech, that is, a figure other than an expressed figure of speech, appears to our understanding from the inherent capability of a meaning, that is another [type of] suggestive poetry, arising from the power of meaning, in which the suggested sense takes the form of a reverberation.L The two varieties of suggestion1 arising from the power of meaning have heretofore been described as a form of vastudhvani (the suggestion of a fact or situation) because that which was suggested in both types was a mere vastu.2 He now states that this [same type of suggestion arising from the power of meaning] can be am alankäradhvani if that which is suggested is in the form of a figure of speech. Thus he says Also w here a new figure of speech, etc. The purport of the word “also” is that a figure of speech is not necessarily suggested by the power of words, as has been described, but may also be suggested bythe power of meaning. Or, we may explain the word “also” as meaning that it is not only a vastu that may be understood there [viz.,"},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"326in suggestion by the power of meaning], since a figure of speech also may be suggested.The Vrtti explains the word \"new” (anya): o th er th an an ex­pressed figure of speech.1. See 2.24 L, note 1. 2. Abhinava fails to mention here that in thesvatah sambhavin variety the suggestion may be of a rasddi rather than a vastumätra. An example is the stanza quoted in 2.22 A.[ § 2.25 LA Lest it be thought that the scope of this [type of suggestive poetry] must be very small, the following is said:K It has been shown that the whole collection of figures of speech such as metaphor and the like, which use direct expression, are often met with in suggested form.A It has been shown by the venerable Bhattodbhata and others that figures of speech such as metaphor and the like, which are well known to be directly expressed in some occurrences, in other occur­rences are understood (i.e., suggested), and this quite frequently. For example, it has been shown that in such a figure as doubt (sasandeha)1 there may appear the figures simile, metaphor, hyperbole, and the like. And so it is not difficult to prove that one figure of speech may be found suggested in another figure of speech.2"},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"3271. Sasandeha: In the light of Udbhata’s only surviving work one would say that Ananda, and following him Abhinava, are here using the wrong word. Udbhata distinguishes sasandeha from sandeha (see 1.13 i L, note 7) and says specifically that it is the latter figure which gives rise to the appearance of other figures. His example of sandeha (6.3* Indurâja, 6.6 Vivrti) is a stanza which describes Visnu ■‘of whom, black of color and riding on the sun-bright king of birds, one doubts whether he is a black cloud on Mt. Meru or smoke over the fire of doomsday.” Indurâja identifies the suggested figure in this stanza as poetic fancy (utpreksä). Udbhata’s two examples of sasandeha do not suggest a second figure in this fashion. If the reading of our text is wrong, the error must be ancient, for Abhinava (see below) clearly read sasandeha. Krishnamoorthy in his var. led. notices sandeha, which he attributes to BP. But this is an error; the word does not occur in that text. 2. This is the sense that Abhinava finally assigns to the passage. He begins, however, by taking alankäräntare as a locative of cause, which would give the passage the meaning, *‘it is not difficult to prove that one figure of speech may be suggested because another [directly expressed] figure is present.\"§ 2.26 L }L Lest it be thought: the source of his concern is that it is easily understandable that by the power of words such figures as s/esa and the like may appear, but it is hard to see what figure of speech could appear through the power of meaning. By the words “the whole [collection]''’ and “has been shown” he makes it clear that this difficulty is specious.'[Bhämaha 3.43 and Udbhata 6.2 have defined sasandeha as follows.] “A statement containing doubt made for the sake of praise by a person who states the identity [of the upameya] with the upamäna and then again its difference, is known as sasandeha.\"1 For example,Is this her hand, or might it bea frond whose finger-leaves are moving in the breeze?2 In such lines there is a suggestion of either si ile or metaphor. And as for hyperbole (atisayokti) it is suggested in almost all expressed figures.3B ecause an o th er figure of speech is present: [Abhinava begins by understanding the Vrtti to say that one figure may be suggested because another figure is present, i.e., by means of another figure; cf. 2.26 A, note 2.] If a figure of speech suggests another, it is not impossi­ble that a figure may be suggested by a vastu (fact or situation). If this is the meaning, the author of the Vrtti has used the word alankäräntare [to exclude that possibility here], but it does not fit the context. The"},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"328context here is not that a figure can be suggested by a figure. The context is that in dhvani based upon meaning, a figure, just as well as a vastu, can be suggested. Thus in the passage where the subject is summed up, the Kärikä (2.28) will state that “these figures attain the highest beauty when they form a part of dhvani\" ; on which the author of the Vrtti begins by saying that a figure can belong to suggestion in either of two ways [viz., by suggesting or by being suggested] and con­cludes that “here, because of the subject at issue we must understand la figure that is suggested’ to be meant, [not one that suggests].’’ As an alternative [which will avoid this lapse from the subject at issue] we shall take the word antara in both occurrences to be a synonym of visesa4 and take the locative as a locative of the sphere rather than a locative of cause.5 Thus the meaning will be as follows. “In an area of expressed figures various suggested figures [may also] appear.\" This has been stated by Udbhata and others and they have thereby admitted that a figure can be suggested by the power of meaning. The only qual­ification to be made is that as they were definers of figures of speech, they spoke of these [suggested] figures in an area of expressed figures. Such is the real meaning of the passage.1. Abhinava does not quote the verse which follows this in Udbhata (6.3 Induräja, 6.5 Vivrti), where Udbhata specifically states that in sandeha (not sasandeha) one figure may suggest another. 2. The source of this example is unknown to us. 3. See below, 3.36. 4. One of the thirteen meaningsof ontani given by the Amarakosa is bheda = visesa = difference, variety.5. See 2.26 A, note 2.[ § 2.26 Lis much deserves to be stated:K Even where a second figure of speech is apprehended [without being directly expressed], if the [first,] expressed figure does not appear as subordinate to it, we are not on the road of dhvani."},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"§ 2.27 L ]A Even where there is an apprehension, like a reverberation, of other figures of speech in (expressed] figures of speech, if the beauty of the expressed figure does not appear chiefly in its conveying of the suggested figure, we are not on the road of dhvani. For example, al­though simile is regularly understood in a figure like zeugma (dipana), if the beauty of the zeugma does not lie in its suggesting the simile, one should not use the designation of dhvani [i.e., one should not label the si ile as upamädhvani). For example:Night is ennobled by moonlight, the pond by its lilies, a vine by its clusters of flowers, the beauty of autumn by wild geese, and the very name of poetry by good listeners. 1In passages of this sort, although a simile is contained [within the dï- pafca], the beauty of the poem lies chiefly in the expressed figure and not in any subservience of it to the suggested figure. Therefore it is reasonable for the poem to be given its designation by the expressed figure.1. Author unknown. For kävyakathä, literally “all talk of poetry,\" see Abhinava's remarks below. Sajjanaih means literally “by good persons.” But what is meant is persons of taste and fair judgment, the opposite of those asajjanäh (SRK, Section 38) who seek out the faults of a poem “as a camel looks for thorns\" (SRK 1255). The expressed figure of the verse is dipaka because the same action, ennobling, is predicated of several subjects, one of which is präkrta (truly the subject matter, here “poetry\") and others of which are not.L Now it might be objected that if all this has been said by former authorities, there is no need for our author to exert himself. Sensing this objection, he says: b u t this m uch [deserves to be stated); supply “by us.\" The word “but” indicates that there will be some difference [in what he will say] from what those [authorities] have said.“By moonlight”: moonlight achieves its greatest glory only at night; and what would good listeners be good for without poetry?1 The en­nobling of night by moonlight consists in its rendering the night brilliant"},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"330and enjoyable; the ennobling of the pond by its lilies in their giving it beauty, fragrance and wealth; the ennobling of the vine by flowers, in giving it attractiveness and charm; of the autumn by wild geese, in their making it a delight to the ear and charming. All these [effects of ennoblement] are granted to poetry by good listeners. All these mean­ings are furnished by the words “is ennobled\" by force of the zeugma (dîpaka).2 The “name” 3 of poetry implies this: put aside the subtle dis­tinctions of poetry; the very word “poetry” disappears without good listeners. But when they are present, a mere collection of words be­comes blessed and possessed of the appelation “poetry,” for the effect of these [good listeners] is to bring it to a position of honor. Thus it is the figure dîpaka that predominates here, not the si ile.1. It is odd that Abhinava begins his comment on the stanza by eliciting this incidental suggestion from a reversal of its terms. This reverse implication is not important and he does not refer to it again. 2. That is, the sense “is ennobled by” is supplied to each pair of subject and agent by the figure of speech. 3. Abhinava is here explaining why the word kävyakathä (literally, “all talk of poetry”) is used rather than the simple word fcövyo (poetry).[ § 2.27 LA But where the expressed figure of speech is placed in subor­dination to a suggested figure, it is reasonable to designate the poem by the suggested figure. As in“Why should he, who has attained to royal glory, who has won ërl for wife, burden me again with the pain of churning?I cannot believe that one so active should seek his former sleep.Why, when he is attended by lords of all the islands, should he build a bridge once more?”Such are the doubts, it seems, which make the ocean tremble when your Majesty marches to its shore.* 1"},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"Or2 as in a verse of my own:IVuly insensate is the oceanthat it is not now stirred by this your smiling face,tremulous-eyed beauty,which fills the horizon with the splendour of its loveliness.3In instances such as these, inasmuch as the beauty of the poem lies in a metaphor that appears like a reverberation, it is reasonable to designate the poem as poetic suggestion of metaphor (rüpakadhvani).1. Author unknown. The stanza flatters the royal patron of the poet by suggesting, in a fused figure (samkara) of doubt {sandeha) and poetic fancy (vtpreksâ, indicated by \"it seems\"), that the patron is Visnu whom the ocean knew on three previous occasions: before the obtaining of Sri from the churning of the sea, in the time of pralaya when Visnu slept on the sea, and when, as Rama, he built a bridge to Lanka to defeat Rävana. 2. At this point we should probably read the passage rejected by Abhinava; see below. We omit it in the translation only in order to avoid repetition. 3. The verse contains a pun. The woman’s face, like the moon, should stir the ocean (jalaräai) if it were not insensate (jadaräsi). In puns / and d are regarded as identical (ladayor abhedah). The verse has been picked up by several of the anthologies; see Kosambi’s apparatus on SRK 421.§ 2.27 a L ]L In this way he has shown the [negative] meaning of the Kärikä by'a [negative] example. He now explains the positive intention implied by what the K ärikä has excluded. This positive intention is that where [the expressed figure shows] subordination to the suggested figure, we are on the road of dhvani: B u t w here, etc. Actually there are three possibilities here (viz., in the area of figures of speech suggested by the power of meaning]: (a) a second figure may be suggested by an expressed figure; (6) there may be an expressed figure but one that does not suggest; and (c) there may be no expressed figure at all. One should attach these possibilities, each as it may fit, to the examples [that follow].1He illustrates: \"Why should he, who has attained to royal glory,” etc. A certain king has come to the shore of the sea with an immense collection of troops, whereupon the sea begins to tremble (or surge) either because of moonrise or because of the plunging of these troops into it.2 As this trembling is fancied to be due to doubts [as described in the stanza], we have the fusion of sasandeha and utpreksä, so the"},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"332expressed figure is fusion (sam kara). And by this there is suggested the superimposition of the character of Väsudeva [= Visnu] on that king [i.e., the figure rüpaka is suggested]. Granted that a contrasted superiority (vyatireka) of the king [to Väsudeva] also appears, that is because of a superiority to Väsudeva in his former, not in his present, condition. Because the blessed Väsudeva has now obtained èri and lives as am active monarch who is victorious over the kings of all the continents. The rüpaka is not forced upon us by any impossibility of the fancied doubt so that we might say that it served simply as a support (upaskâra) to the expressed figure,3 for we can imagine [the ocean’s] reasoning to take the form that anyone who has not obtained wealth amd is inspired by an unconcealed desire of conquest might be likely to churn its waters.4 Nor is this sense [of the identification of the king with Väsudeva] forced on us by the words “again’’ (punar api), “former” (pürvam), and “once more” (bhüyah). Because the words “again” and “once more\" can reasonably be used even if the agents should differ, since the ocean remains the same. As one might say, “The earth was formerly conquered by Kärtavlrya and then again by Jämadagnya.”5 And “his former sleep\" cam be explained as the king’s habit of sleep when he was a prince [before he had assumed the responsibilities of a ruler]. Thus it is established that the stanza is an example of suggested metaphor (rüpakadhvani)6 [and not a case of a metaphor subordinate to an expressed figure]; because we apprehend the superimposing [of the character of Väsudeva on the king] in the absence of direct denotation simply from the beauty of the expressed sense.7 Here some [authorities] read another example: “And as inOn this sand bank of the Sarayu whitened by flooding streams of moonlight two angels once held long debate.One claimed that Kesin was the first to die; the other, Kamsa. Tell us truly now which did you slay first?”This passage is spurious,8 because the sense that “you are Väsudeva” is here made clear by the direct expression of the word “you.” “Loveliness” (lävanya), that is, a charm of configuration; “splen­dour,” i.e., brilliance. The horizon is “filled,” that is, furnished with, made enchanting by, these two qualities of your face.9 \"Now”: now that your face inclines toward graciousness after its recent disturbance by [the] anger [of jealousy]. “Smiling\": with lips slightly parted in a smile.[ § 2.27a L"},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"333“Tremulous-eyed beauty”: the word is a vocative, designating a per­son of whom the eyes are tremulous, that is, beautiful because of their motion and dilation prompted by their owner’s graciousness. And yet the ocean is not stirred “now,\" although it was stirred a moment ago [when the moon rose). Inasmuch as your face, flushed by its [recent] disturbance of anger and [now] smiling is the very disc of the full moon rising at sunset, 10 any sensitive being must be stirred, must experience a motion of the heart. As the ocean “is not stirred,” it clearly exhibits an accumulation of insentiency (jâdyasancaya) in conformity with its name “the accumulation of waters\" (jalarâsi). We have said before [see1.1 Intro. L and note 10 thereon] that adjectives like jada can be nom- inalized [e.g., jada can be used in the sense of jädya]. In the stanza the denotative function of the words comes to a halt after furnishing the sense “a sensitive person must be stirred,” must experience an alter­nation brought about by love, “on looking at your face.” Accordingly, the metaphor (rüpaka, i.e., the identifying your face with the moon) must be the work of suggestion. The pun (slesa) is an expressed figure of speech in the stanza, but this pun does not suggest anything. The metaphor that appears like a reverberation is suggested by the power of meaning; and as the beauty of the poem depends on this metaphor, the poem should be designated by it as an instance of rüpakadhvani. This is the connection [between the verse and the thesis that stood i need of illustration]. 11. The passage from “actually there are three possibilities here” (tatra ca. etc.) to “one should attach to the (following] examples” (udâharanesu yogyam] becomes clear after one reads further in the commentary. Abbinava was apparently struck by the fai t that several of the examples given under this Kärikä by the Vrtti do not exhibit a figure suggested by another figure. Although that seems to be the area marked out by the Kärikä, the Vrtti cov­ers the wider area of figures suggeated in any way by the power of meaning. Abhinava divides this wider area into three categories. The first, which is clearly referred to by the Kärikä. in where the suggested figure is suggested by an expressed figure. This is exemplified by the following example, prâptasrîr esa \"Why should he.” The second, where the verse exhibits an expressed fig­ure but where the suggested figure i> suggested by something other than the expressed figure, is exemplified by < he stanza lävanyakänti “TVuly insensible is the ocean.\" The third, where there is no expressed figure but where there is a suggested figure, would be exemplified by the verse jyotsnäpüraprasara “On this sand bank of the Sarayu, which Abhinava rejects as an insertion, if the suggestion were not spoiled by the direct expression “you.” 2. These§ 2.27a L ]"},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"334are the real causes of the surging of the sea, as opposed to the fancied cause. In supposing that the trampling of an army could disturb the sea, Abhinava was doubtless picturing in his mind a Kashmirian lake rather than the Indian Ocean. 3. If the rüpaka arose in this way, it would be subordinate to the samkara and we could not categorize the poem as rûpakadhvani. The point of view that Abhinava here denies might be put as follows. So long as the character of Visnu is not superimposed on the king, the speculations (vitarka) regarding the purpose of the king’s visit to the ocean, which constitute the sandehälaiikära, are not reasonable. Nor is the fancy (utpreksä) that these speculations are the cause of the ocean’s agitation reasonable. The superim­position is needed in order to justify or rationalize the expressed figures. But Abhinava denies this view. The speculations regarding the purpose of the king's visit to the ocean do not force the rüpaka upon us, he says, because they can be differently explained. 4. As the ocean was supposed to be a ine of jewels, anyone desiring wealth would be a potential miner of these jewels. Again, a king bent on conquest would be likely to churn the sea by tranporting his army to distant lands. It does not take a Visnu to think of troubling the sea. 5. The argument which Abhinava rejects might be put thus. We grant that any ambitious king might churn the sea. But only Visnu could churn it “again” and build a bridge across it “once more.” Abhinava’s rejection points out that the adverbs can refer to the relation of verb and object rather than to the relation of verb and subject. The sea, churned by Visnu, can be agitated at the thought of being churned by someone else.6. This categorizing of the verse by Ànanda and Abhinava is criticized in RG, p. 247. 7. These words are added to make it clear that the present exampleis a case of arthasaktyudbhavadhvani. 8. Abhinava’s criterion of textual authenticity is that what the text says must be worthy of his author. If, in his opinion, it is not, the text must be spurious. By modem principles of textual criticism the rejected passage has a good claim to be genuine. It is included in the Nepali manuscript of the Dhv. (see Krishnamoorty’s ed.) and is cited in the Vyaktiviveka (p. 430) where it appears between the verses pràptaérìr esa and lävanyakänti, precisely its position in the Nepali MS. 9. Abhinava takes lävanyakänti as a dvandva. In the translation we have taken it as a tatpurusa.10. The full moon also as it rises turns from red to white.[ § 2.27a L"},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"§ 2.27 b L ]A The following is an example of the poetic suggestion of si (upamädhvani).The eyes of warriors take not such joy in their ladies’ saffron painted breasts as they take in the cranial lobes, painted with red minium, of their enemies' elephants. 1Another example is from my Visamabänalilä, speaking of the conquest of the demons by the god of love:Their hearts once bent on theft of those gems born of the same womb as Sri were transferred by the god of flower arrows to the bimba-like lips of their women.1. The comparison of a woman’s breasts to the two frontal lobes of an elephant’s cranium is a stock simile of Sanskrit poetry, but the notion that a warrior might take more joy in handling and crushing the upamäna than the upameya of this simile is original.L Our author gives two examples of suggested simile (upamä­dhvani), but does not state expressly how the definition [of a suggested figure] applies to them because the application is the same [as in the preceding examples of suggested metaphor).[Abhinava gives a Sanskrit translation of the Prakrit verse “The eyes of warriors,” on which he comments as follows.] Here, while there is a weighing of the inclination [of these warriors] to fondle their orna­mented ladies against their emotional eagerness for an approaching bat­tle, the eagerness for battle is [shown to be] greater. Thus the directly expressed figure of speech is contrast (vyatireka). But a similitude is suggested between the cranial lobes of enemy elephants, ready for bat­tle, objects of terror to all men, and the swelling breasts of their ladies. By this si ile we see the esteem [of these men for battle], as if they were deriving sexual pleasure from it, and this si ile effects a striking"},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":"portrayal of their heroism. Hence the (suggested] simile is of primary importance [in the verse].T he conquest of th e dem ons: for in that poem his conquest of all three worlds is described. “Their hearts,” that is, the hearts of the demons who dwell in Pätäla and who had engaged in every sort of outrage, such as injuring the city of Indra and the like; hearts whose resolution was unshaken by the most arduous adventures.1 “Born of the same womb as Sri” : the sense is “and therefore of inexpressible value.” The hearts of these demons which had been bent on, that is, wholly intent on, the theft, that is, the abduction from every [hiding place], of these gems: these hearts were transferred by the god of flower arrows—he was supplied with the gentlest artillery imaginable—to the lips of their women; that is to say, Kama brought their hearts to regard the gazing at, ki ing, and biting of these lips as the highest purpose of these demons’ lives, whereas their hearts had just now been blazing with the fire of martial ambition. Here the expressed figure of speech is hyperbole (atisayokti).2 The suggested figure is simile, for the bimba- like lips are similar to the best of all gems and hence the high value placed upon these lips is real. That is why the suggested figure is not rüpaka, because a rüpaka is a superimposition [of the character of one object on another, actually different, object] and so is unreal.3 The similarity of the lips of their women to the best of gems appears to these demons as a matter of actual fact and this similarity by its predominance is the source of the striking effect of the verse.1. The words tarn hiaam of the verse are glossed by Abhinava by hrdayam tac ca: the heart, and such a heart! 2. Mammata quotes this verse (Book 10, vs. 515) as an example of the trope paryäya (where one obj t, here “their hearts,” is described as existi in different places). Paryäya is apparently an invention of Mammata’s, as it is not found in such older authors as are preserved to us. His reason for the assignment of it to this verse is that atisayokti had ceased to mean hyperbole in his time and the verse will not fit easily into any of his four types of atisayokti. But the verse fits naturally into the older definitions, e.g., that of Bhämaha 2.81 “A statement the sense of which exceeds reality, when made for some [poetic] purpose should be considered atisayokti (hyperbole)\",'\"or of Udbhata ( Vivrti 2.23). BP by ingenuity manages to fit the present verse even into a late definition of ati­sayokti. “Heart,” it says, really refers to nothing more than cittavrtti, a mental or emotional state. The demons’ emotional drive toward robbery really had no connection with their later amorous state, but the two states are here pictured as connected.

But if I say her face is the moon, the literal sense of my words is false. This distinction between the reality of upamd and the in-eality of rvpaka goes back to the beginning of the Alankara tradition; cf. BhNÉ 16.56, savikalpena racitam räpakam, “rüpaka is a figure formed by one’s imagination.” * 1 2§ 2.27c A ]A An example of poetic suggestion of äksepa (feigned or preg­nant denial) is as follows:He can express all Hayagriva’s virtueswho can measure by jars the water of the sea.*Here by means of the (expressed] figure hyperbole there appears a (sug­gested] äksepa, which takes the form of proclaiming that Hayagriva’s virtues are indescribable and which has the purpose of showing that in their excellence these virtues are unique.21. The verse is later quoted by Hemacandra AC 1.77 and AlSaru, p. 151. Possibly it is taken from Bhartrmentha’s lost poem, the Hayagrivavadha.2. The directly expressed figure here, in the older system of poetics, is hy­perbole (atisayokti) because measuring the sea in jars is a purely imaginary action that exceeds the bounds of reality; see 2.27 b L, note 2. In the later system the figure would be identified as nidaréanâ, as it is identified by our late commentators on Sdk. 1.16, which contains a similar turn of phrase. The suggested figure is äksepa, a denial which hints at something unexpressed; cf. 1.13e A, note 3. Bhämaha (2.68) defines the figure as “a feigned denial of what is or was one’s intention, made with the purpose of emphasis (or ex­aggeration).”: pratisedha ivestasya yo visesäbhidhitsayä. What he means can best be seen from examples. “It is wonderful that you have no pride although you have conquered the earth. But what can produce an alteration of the sea?” (Bhàmaha 2.70). \"As he thought about her, it was wonderful that his thought knew no end. But where is there any end to thoughts of love, or time?” (Udbhata, 2.2* Induräja, 2.5 Vivrti). In both examples there is implied a denial (the denial is not directly expressed in these examples) of the predication \"wonderful.'’ but in both cases the denial is not because the"},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"338denied fact is not wonderful (it is wonderful) but because the word wonderful is not strong enough. The graciousness of the conquering king and the never ceasing thoughts of the lover are more than wonderful; the one is as steady as the ocean, the other as ceaseless as time. In the present example cited by Änandvardhana, there is an implied denial that the virtues of Hayagriva can be enumerated or described (both Änanda and Abhinava speak of avarnan»- yatâ rather than aparisankhyeyatä). This is not because the poet really means that they are indescribable (his poem doubtless went on to describe them), but because he wishes to emphasize or exaggerate. He means that Hayagriva's virtues were unique.[ § 2.27c AL By m eans of hyperbole: he means, as the expressed figure. The implication that his virtues are indescribable is a form of äksepa (feigned or pregnant denial), because it is a denial of what is actually intended. 1 He shows us that this äksepa forms the predominant sense of the verse by the adjectival compound “[which has the purpose of showing that these virtues are] unique.”A Poetic suggestion of the figure substantiation (arthäntaranyä- sa) is possible both as a suggestion arising from the power of words (sabdasaktyudbhavavyangyadhvani) and as a suggestion arising from the power of meaning (arthasaktyudbhavavyangyadhvani). An illustration of the former is:Since fruit depends on fate, what can be done?This much, however, we can say: the flowers of the red asoka tree are unlike those of others.[Sattasai 3.79]1As the suggestion is here revealed by a word [viz., phale “fruit”], it does not conflict with the overall sense of the sentence, which is different."},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"An example of the second variety is as follows:0 clever lover, to apologizeeven when I have disguised my faceand hidden the grievance in my heart.Though you have been unfaithful, one cannot be angry.2By the fact that one cannot be angry at a particular individual denoted (by the primary force of the words], who is clever though unfaithful, there is suggested as the primary sense a substantiating general state­ment connected [with that particular statement).1. The Sattasai reads deväattammi, the regular reflex of Sanskrit devâ- yatte, and Pischel knows only the form äatta. But äya might change to e on the analogy of aya, so our reading may be correct. For kahkillapallaväh read kankellipallavd. Kankelli is the MähärästrT name of the asoka-, see Hema- candra, Abhidhänacintämani 1135. The word occurs again in Sattasai 5.4. The asoka tree bears brilliant red flowers, which appear on its fronds (pallavóli) before the leaves appear. Its fruit is inconspicuous. The direct meaning and suggested figures of the stanza are as follows. Direct meaning: “The asoka tree bears no fruit; that cannot be helped. It bears beautiful flowers.” There is no arthäntaranyäsa (substantiation, see 1.13 i L, note 8) in the direct mean­ing because a particular cannot be substantiated by a particular. The first suggestion arises from the double meaning of the word phale (fruit, reward) and so is a suggestion arising from the power of a word. ‘The asoka tree bears no/fruit. The reward of all living things depends on fate.” This is arthäntara­nyäsa of Mammata’s second type (10.109), where a particular statement is substantiated by a general statement. The second suggestion depends on the power of meaning and derives from the stanza as a whole, read in the context of advice to a king. “Even a hero may fail of success, for success depends on fate. But his virtues shine above those of other men.\" This is aprastutapra- samsä, a figure which consists in a statement (prasamsä) of a non-contextual or allegorical ( aprastuta) meaning and which suggests a contextual (prastuta) meaning, that is, a sense that concerns the matter that is really in one’s mind. The prastuta meaning in an aprastutapraäamsä is always suggested; it cannot be expressed. A problem now arises. Our text has said that we can speak of a suggested figure of speech only when that figure forms the predominant sense of the verse (2.22 K). How can there be two predominant suggested senses in one stanza? Ananda does not answer the question very satisfactorily. He merely says that there is no contradiction because one figure is suggested by a single word, the other by the sentence as a whole. 2. Viewing this little verse out of context and without reference to the commentators, one may be§ 2.27 d A ]"},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"340puzzled how to take it, whether as the remark of a woman who is naive, forgiv­ing, cynical, or clever. Änanda’s implied and Abhinava’s expressed opinion is that it is the remark of a clever woman, who has been hurt and who is letting her husband or lover know that she sees through his excuses. This is why they assign the verse to “suggested substantiation” (arthäntaranyäsa- dhvani), a figure that demands that a particular statement be substantiated by a general statement or vice versa. The particular statement of the woman concerning her lover suggests the general principle that false lovers always act in this way. After reading Abhinava’s comment on the verse one will agree, I think, that this interpretation gives the verse a greater charm than it would have under other interpretations.[ § 2.27 d AL Is possible: by this word he shows that the consideration at this point of suggestion based on the power of words is incidental [the matter properly under consideration being suggestion based on the power of meaning].[After translating the Prakrit stanza “Since fruit depends on fate,” etc., into Sanskrit. Abhinava continues:] Unlike other trees such as the mango and the like, the asoka tree does not bear fruit. What can be done about it? But its flowers are extremely beautiful. By express­ing this much the denotation of the sentence is complete. Before [we reach this point], we apprehend a substantiation of this [particular] fact through the [double] power of the [ambiguous] word phale (fruit or reward). The general proposition takes the form of the following obser­vation: “Sometimes, because of fate, the result in the form of success may not be achieved even by a man of uncommon ambition who sets forth with the correct means.” But now a difficulty arises because an allegory ( aprastutaprasamsä) is suggested1 as the predominant mean­ing of the sentence as a whole. How then can the figure substantiation be suggested, since two predominant meanings cannot coexist? In view of this difficulty he says, As th e suggestion is here revealed by a word. For it will be stated [in 3.1-2] that all the forms of suggestion are revealed either by single words or by complete sentences. In the verse we are discussing substantiation (arthäntaranyäsa) is the predominant suggestion in a single word, whereas allegory (aprastutaprasamsä) is. the predominant suggestion in the sentence. But of these two it is the relation of substantiating and substantiated statements (i.e., the arthäntaranyäsa) furnished by the word phale that appears in greater predominance2 and so one will categorize the verse as an example of suggested substantiation (arthäntaranyäsadhvani)."},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"341“When I have hidden the grievance in my heart\" : literally, “I being one by whom the grievance is placed within the heart and not revealed.\" Accordingly, you clever one who apologize to me even when I show no anger in my face, there can be no cause of anger at you although you have been unfaithful. The vocative singular \"0 clever one\" determines [the denoted sense to refer to] a particular. But then as one considers the sense, a substantiation in the form of a general statement is appre­hended and this is strikingly poetic. For we have here a woman who has been wronged [by her husband or lover], who is clever and who, when he apologizes, shows her annoyance by saying [in effect]: “Every clever rascal although he has been unfaithful covers up the occasion of his transgression in this way; do not pride yourself falsely on that account.\" Connected: sc., because the general statement is connected with the particular.1. aprastutaprasamsa prädhanyena vyangyä: Abhinava is speaking inex­actly, as BP points out. What he means is that the contextual (prastuta) meaning of the aprastutaprasamsa is suggested (aprastutaprasamsâsthale pra- stutärtho vyangyah). The distinction should be kept in mind because in 2.27 h Abhinava will give us an example where the aprastuta sense as well as the pro­stata sense is suggested. That is not the case here. 2. Abhinava gives no reason for this greater predominance. BP says simply that it appears that way to men of taste. * I§ 2.27e A ]A Poetic suggestion of contrast (vyatirekadhvani) is also possible in both forms [sc., by the power of words and by the power of meaning] The first of these types has been illustrated above [2.21 f A]. An example of the second is this:I would rather be born somewhere i as a crippled, leafless tree than be born in the world of men, a man yearning to give and poor.[Sattasaï 3.30]In this example it is directly stated that to be born as a poor man who wishes to be generous is not a matter for rejoicing and that to be born"},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"342as a stunted, leafless tree is a matter for rejoicing. This statement, after we first apprehend the comparability (upamänopameyatva) of such a man with such a tree, shows as the predominant meaning of the verse that the man’s degree of misery is greater.I § 2.27e AL A suggestion of contrast is also possible: By using the word “also” he shows that just like the suggestion of substantiation (arthântaranyâsadhvani), the suggestion of contrast vyatirekadhvani) is also of two kinds. Above refers to the verse “May both sets of the sun god’s feet” [2.21 f A].1“I would rather be born somewhere in a forest” : in a secluded part of a forest, in a thicket where, being surrounded by the luxuriance of numerous conspicuous trees, I shall not even be noticed by anyone. “Crippled” : unfit for being made into any shape. “Leafless” : the mean­ing is that it affords no shade, how much less should it have flowers or fruit. What the poet wishes to convey is that even such a tree might be useful for making charcoal or might serve as a roost for owls. “Of men”: that is, where suppliants are plentiful. “In this world”: sc., where he is seen by suppliants and where suppliants are seen by him and yet he can do nothing [to help them].

Sandalwood trees grow in Malabar and are said to be a favorite haunt of snakes (SRK 801, 1078). The verb mürcchati means both to swell and to swoon. Swooning may be caused either by snake bite or unfulfilled love. The spring breeze brings back to travelers memories of their wives and mistresses waiting at home. With this verse compare Dandin 2.238. 2. Or, becauseof the natural compatibility of the sentence meaning with such a fancy. On simarthya see 2.21 a A, note 2. 3. BP: As persons of taste will understandthe sense of fancy in such passages even in the absence of a word like iva, the rejection of such passages as disconnected or nonsense is wrong.[ § 2.27 f AL Is fancied: because [it is fancied that] the wind, swollen by, that is magnified or increased by, poisonous exhalations, causes swooning. Furthermore, it is fancied that one individual among the travelers [viz., the wind], being poisoned (mürcchita), causes mürcchä, that is, loss of health, to other individuals. So we have a double fancy (utpreksä). Now it might be objected that we have no fancy here at all, because the adjectival phrase [“swollen by the breathing of snakes”], being otherwise a useless addition, makes sense only if taken as giving the cause [of the increase of the wind and the swooning of the travelers]. But what if the phrase is taken as giving the cause. This is not the real cause [of those effects]; rather, it is fancied as the cause. So the objection amounts to nothing.1 O f such words: because we see that this sense, viz., that of something fancied, may be understood even when words like iva are not used. He now illustrates this point: As in, etc.“Afflicted by anger”: tinged with redness. Should the moon attain similarity to your face when your face is pleased, or that it should always be similar, then what would it not do [in its joy]? That it could really become your face—why, this would be beyond the power even of its daydreams. This is what the word “although” (apt) conveys. He “cannot contain himself” in his own body, as he is filling the horizon [with moonlight]. “Just this once” means after such a long time and then too for one night only [sc., for the night of the full moon]. In this stanza the filling of the horizon by the light of the full moon, which is a natural event, is fancied in this manner [sc., as being prompted by the moon’s desire to equal the face of the woman].But now our author senses that the word nanu (“it seems”) might be regarded as a expression of reflection, that is, of fancy (utpreksä), and that by this direct expression the disconnection (asambaddhatä) [to remove which, as we have claimed, the reader supplies a suggested"},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"fancy] might be removed. Accordingly, he gives us another example: O r, as in, etc.That the deer, r u n n in g among, that is, all about, the tents, did not halt although it was not chased by any men with bows and arrows, was due, in actual fact, to its natural timidity and restlessness. But a poetic fancy is here suggested: that the deer did not halt because the beauty of its eyes, which was the deer’s most treasured possession, had been hit [i.e., surpassed] by the women with arrows in the form of their large eyes [also: arrows pulled back on the bow string as far as the ears]. Our author anticipates a criticism, namely that this verse too2 is disconnected (or nonsense) as there is no word like iva to denote the fancy; and so he says:when it com es to th e relation, etc.1.

This slesa, [which arises] from the non-verbal inherent compatability of the [ex­pressed] meanings [with the second meanings], acts as the predominant figure of the stanza."},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"3461. This stanza, which forms part of Mägha’s desccription of the city of Dvärakä. has been analyzed by Vallabhadeva and Mallinätha as well as by Änanda and Abhinava. There is no disagreement about the double meanings of the adjectival phrases. But the commentators disagree on how to interpret the little word aamam (“together with”) and on this question hangs the un­derstanding of the expressed meaning of the stanza, the identification of its figures, and the problem of what, if anything, the stanza suggests. Samam is an adverb, but does it modify the verb’s relation to its subject or to its object? In the first case, the direct meaning will be: “together with their wives the young men enjoyed the terraces.” In the second case, the direct meaning will be: “the young men enjoyed the ten-aces together with, that is, as well as enjoying, their wives.” Only Mallinätha takes the latter course. Änanda and Abhinava take the former course and explain the appearance of the second meaning as a suggestion. Änanda’s explanation, which is ellipti­cal, and Abhinava's, which is clearer, may be put as follows. After we have understood the direct meaning (the first of those just given), there occurs to the mind the second meanings of the adjectival phrases. These senses are suggested to the mind by the natural compatability of the primary sense for these second meanings. What our authors mean is that the primary sense gives us an erotic context in which it is entirely appropriate that the women be beautiful, endowed with the graceful triple fold at the waist, and elegantly adorned. Once we perceive these puns, we realize that the terraces are like the wives. That is to say, we arrive at the second meaning by way of a simile that grows out of the suggested puns. As the charm of the verse lies in the sug­gested puns, it should be counted as an example of slesadhvani. Mallinätha, setting off from a different direct meaning of the verse, sees in it the expressed figure tulyayogitä (paired objects). The Dhvanyäloka analysis seems to me a better description of the psychological process of understanding the stanza; Mallinätha’s of course is simpler.[ § 2.27g AL “Possessing patäkäh,” that is. [of terraces] possessing flags on flagstaffs. The phrase ramyä iti (“to give them beauty”) expresses the cause.1 (As applied to the women] “possessing patäkäh” will mean possessing fame. The phrase ramyä iti will then express the form that this fame takes [i.e., the fame of being beautiful]. Viviktäh (private) [is used of the terraces] because they are not crowded with people; and for that reason they increase râpa, that is. the desire for sexual enjoyment. Other [commentators], however, explain räga here as color, “having a profusion of beautiful color.”2 Also, [as applied to the women,] the sense will be “increasing (their husbands’] passion (anuräga) since they are viviktäh., of ornamented limbs, that is, handsome. [The terraces] have"},{"pageNumber":362,"pageContent":"347curved eaves, that is, curved edges of the thatch. [The women] have curved lines at their waist in the form of the triple fold. Samam means together with. But someone may say that from the word sama (equal, similar to) one understands [that the terraces are] similar to [the wives]. That is true; that too [is understood] from the puns. But the puns are not brought in by the denotative force of the words, but by the inherent compatibility3 [of the primary sense for these second m e an in g *]; and so the puns are most certainly suggested. That is why the author of the Vrtti, while he says that the terraces are like the women, does not say that we have here a case of suggested simile (upamädhvani), because the simile is based on the puns. If the poet had said clearly [that the young men enjoyed terraces which were] samäh (similar to) [their wives], then the simile would be directly expressed and the puns would be brought in by the simile. But the indeclinable samam has the direct meaning of saha (“together with”), which can furnish a pun only by suggestion through its modifying the verb.4 If we omit the puns, there is no incompletion of the denotative power of the words. So it is only after the denotative power of the words has exhausted itself that a second meaning is understood and this only by persons of refined taste, who understand it without any separate effort.5 As has already been said [1.7 K], “Not by a mere knowledge of grammar and dictionaries is the suggested sense known.” And this [principle of analysis] is to be followed in all [these] examples.6 In the sentence “Fat Caitra does not eat by' day,” it is the denotative power that is incomplete and that demands a further meaning or a further word for its exhaustion. AAd that demand furnishes occasion for the inference (anumâna) of a Naiyäyika or the verbal presumption (srutärthäpatti) of a Mïmâmsaka. There is no occasion there for suggestion.7 But enough of this long [explanation]. It is this [principle of analysis] that our author refers to when he says non-verbal. 1§ 2.27g L ]1. The terraces were decked with flags because they (the flags) were beau­tiful; ramyâ refers to patäkäh, not to va.labh.ih. 2. Abbinava is here probably referring to Vallabhadeva. who in his commentary on the Sisnpälavadha ex­plains räga in this verse as referring to the painting of the terraces with red realgar and minium. 3. The context, I think, demands crthasämarthya in place of arthasaundarya. 4. In vadhübhih soma valabhih the word for similar connects “terraces” and ••wives” directly. In vadhübhih samam valabhxr asev- yanta “terraces” and “wives” are connected only through the verb. 5. If the denotative sense were incomplete without the puns (as in the verse of 2.21 c A"},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"348“The cloud serpents pour forth water”), the puns would be part of the deno­tative process and would not be suggested. Furthermore, the understanding of the two meanings of the puns would be by two separate efforts, for there would be two denotative powers to understand. Here the second meaning arises after the denotative process has ceased and its understanding is part of the same effort by which we understand the denoted meaning. 6. By “this principle” Abhinava evidently means the rule that once a logically complete meaning has been given by direct denotation, any further meaning that ap­pears in a poem does so by suggestion, not by anumàna or arthâpatti, of which he goes on to speak. 7. The Naiyäyika regards the sentence “Fat Caitra does not eat by day” as furnishing the Unga for the inference that Caitra eats at night. The Bhätta Mîmâmsaka regards it as presuming a suppletion by the word rätrav (“at night\").[§ 2.27g LA An example of poetic suggestion of yathäsaiikhya (ordered sequence) is the following:The mango tree puts forth sprout, leaf, bud and flower.In our heart love puts forth sprout, leaf, bud and flower. 1 1In this stanza there is a beauty similar to a reverberation in the fact that the words “sprout,” etc., used in the predicate of “love,” occur in the same sequence in which they were used in the prior statement [about the mango]. This beauty is noticed as something distinct from the expressed figures of tulyayogitä and samuccaya that apply to love and the mango tree.2In this way other figures of speech may be adduced [as examples of figures suggested by the power of meaning], according to the proper connection in each case.31. BP notes that for the nominatives in the first verse-half another read­ing gives locatives; and such is the reading of SRK 188 and Sadukti. 1232: ankurite paUavite karakite puspite ca sahakäre. But the change to nominatives is doubtless intentional on Änanda’s part and is repeated in the Vyaktiviveka, p. 442; see the following note. None of the sources gives the author’s name"},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"3492. The expressed figures axe tvlyayogitä, the assignment of the same verbs to two different subjects (the mango tree and love) that are both proper to the context; and samuccaya, defined by Rudrata 7.27 as the occurrence of the same quality or action in two different objects at the same time. Yathä- saiikhya (ordered sequence) occurs when a number of things are referred to in a later passage in the exact order in which they were referred to in a prior passage. In an expressed yathäsaiikhya the sense of the sentence is not logi­cally complete or satisfactory unless we apply this principle of ordering. “You surpass the lotus, the moon, bees, elephants ... by your face, radiance, eyes, gait .. . \"(Bhämaha 2.90). If we mix up the references, we get nonsense. So yathäsankhya is necessary for an understanding of the primary sense. The same necessity applies to our present verse if we read locatives in the first half line, for the verse will then mean that as the mango puts forth sprouts, love begins; as it leafs, love unfolds; as its buds appear, love develops into a sharp yearning; and as it flowers, love reaches it full development. The yathäsaiikhya principle is needed in order to assign the appropriate conditions to the appro­priate effects. But if we read nominatives, the verse sets two whole sentences against each other, as we have done in the translation of A. It is not necessary to correlate the components of the two sentences in order to avoid nonsense. Rather, the perception comes as a pleasant surprise, after we have understood the direct meaning, that the components of the two sentences can be sequen­tially paired off. Thus the yathäsaiikhya appears as a suggestion similar to a reverberation and not as an expressed figure. One may note that Simhabhu- päla (also spelled Éingabhüpâla and Singabhüpäla) equated the terms of our little verse with various Sanskrit words for love: ahkura with prema, pollava with mäna, koraka (= kalikä) with pranaya, puspa with sneha, phala with räga (Rasärnavasvdhäkara, ed. T. Venkatacharya, 2.11 Iff.). Mallinätha refers to this passage at KvmSam. 8.15. 3. In some cases the connection will be witha suggestor (vyanjaka) which is itself a figure of speech; in other cases with a suggestor that is a vastu (fact or situation).L In this way o th er [figures o f speech]: Every figure of sense (arthälahkära) can be found in suggested form. For example, a suggestion of dipaka (zeugma) is:Not fire or windor maddened elephant!Not ax or lightning!0 tree, may you be eversafe with your vine.[The meaning of the verse is “May fire, wind, etc., not harm you,” but] the zeugma of the verb “harm” is hidden, from which we understand§ 2.27h L ]"},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":"that the tree is specially dear to the poet1 and by which the verse is given beauty.A suggestion of aprastutaprasamsâ is as follows:3 Flying about the ketaka trees, you will kill yourself on their thorns, O bee; while in your wandering you will not find a flower sweet as the jasmine.3A certain lady, walking in a garden with her lover, sees a bee and addresses these words to it. Thus the direct statement about the bee is contextual.4 You cannot say that we understand this meaning to be non-contextual from the use of the vocative,5 because the vocative can be contextual, being due to the lady’s simplicity.6 So the aprastuta- prasamsd cannot be reached simply by the power of denotation. It is only after the denotative process has been completed that a reference to some other matter is suggested by the force of the directly expressed sense.7 The suggestion is that a lady of good family, beautiful and proud, comparable to a delicate, sweet-smelling jasmine, prompted by her sincere love, berates her lover who has been roaming hither and yon among prostitutes of low birth, who have gained a reputation for their artificial skill, who are surrounded by thorns in the persons of their bawds, and who can well be represented by a grove of ketaka trees with its far-reaching perfume.A suggestion of apahnuti (denial accompanied by false affirmation) is found in a verse by my teacher Bhattenduräja:On this reservoir of nectar, whose bold and lovely curve is like the curve of a pale maiden’s breast, that which we see, precious as the application of ornamental markings in black aloe, is Love, my graceful lady, stretching out his limbs on that cold bed to assuage the heat engendered by his dwelling in the heart of many a damsel burning with the fire of separation.®In this verse a denial of the mark on the moon is suggested by the [false] affirmation that it is the figure of Love, turned black by the fire arising from the hearts of damsels who suffer the fire of separation.The same verse carries also a suggestion of the figure sasandeha (doubt), for the mark of the moon has not been mentioned by name but has been referred to as exhibiting the value, or excellence, of the spot painted with ornamental markings of black aloe on the moon as rep­resented by the curve of a pale maiden’s breast. Accordingly, a doubt350 [ § 2.27 h L"},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":"351is suggested to the effect that “I do not know what it is.” There is also a suggestion of prativastüpamä? The prativastüpamâ that is sug­gested is this. A lady who has refused to accept her lover’s apologies subsequently feels remorse and pain at the separation occasioned [by her anger], so she prepares to welcome her lover back and after com­pleting the decoration of her person is ready in the love chamber for his arrival. It is a full-moon night and her lover arrives, guided by the go-between. The lover flatters the lady, telling her, “the ornamental markings on your swelling breast stir my passion.” to which the anal­ogous sentence is that “this beautiful appearance, dark as the petal of a blue waterlily, on the moon does the same.”10 The term “reservoir of nectar,” although it is used only as a synonym for the moon, still sug­gests the reason for the god of love’s seeking to allay his heat there. So we have also a suggestion of hetvalankära (the figure cause).11 There is also a suggestion of sahokti (pairing) in the form that the beauty of your breasts and the beauty of the moon together stir my passion. From the apprehension of the sense that “the moon is like your breast and the curve of your breast is like that of the moon, the figure upa- meyopamä12 is also suggested. In this way, other varieties [of suggested figures of speech] can be imagined. For these words of a great poet are like a magic wishing-cow, [endless in the gifts they can furnish]. For it has been said:The playful gesture of one man produces results unending; another’s effort cannot achieve a particle of gain.If an Elephant of the Quarters stirs a hair, he shakes the earth, while if a bee should fall from heaven itself, he would not shake a vine.13The combination of these figures [in Bhattenduräja’s verse] into sam- STSti and sankara (associated and fused combinations) can be worked out [by the reader for himself].A suggestion of atisayokti (hyperbole) is in a verse of my own:Your eyes are the chief embodiment of beauty’s springtimewhen it sends forth its first shoots of gaiety:the successive motions of your eyebrow are the bowbending in Love’s hand to its varied curvature;the wine of your lotus mouth, fair lady, at first sipbegets intoxication: truly God has centeredin you alone the treasures of his universe.§ 2.27 h L ]"},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":"352There is a suggestion of atiéayokti here, for while spring, love, and wine are blessed with success in the world by reinforcing one another, they are here [said to have] combined into an unique body in your person. 14 There is also a suggestion of the figure vibhävanä (the occurrence of a result in the absence of cause), for by saying that “the wine of your mouth causes intoxication at first sip” it is suggested that a result, namely intoxication, comes about without its proper cause, namely a frequent imbibing [of the inebriant]. There is also a suggestion of tvlya- yogitä (paired subjects) in saying that the lady’s two eyes are the chief embodiment of beauty’s springtime.It should be understood that in this way every figure of speech can be suggested. It is not that only certain figures can be suggested within certain limits as some writers claim. 15A ccording to th e p ro p er connection in each case: one should connect [with the suggestion] the [power of] meaning that is appropriate in each case. In some cases the suggestor will be a figure of speech; in some cases it will be a vastu (a fact or situation).1. It is so dear to him that he silences the unlucky word bädhista ( “harm” ). The dipaka, not being expressed in words, is suggested by the contextual meaning. One cannot argue that as the verb must be supplied in order to get a logically satisfactory sense, the dipaka should belong to the denotative operation; because we might get a satisfactory primary sense by supplying a different verb with each subject (may fire not burn you, wind not break you, etc.). The choice of a single verb, which occasions the dipaka, is due to suggestion. Abhinava does not here observe the distinction between dipaka and tulyayogitä that we find in Udbhata and later authors. See 1.13f L, note 1.2. Here Abhinava is speaking precisely (contrast 2.27d L, note 1). Not only the contextual (prostata) meaning but the non-contextual meaning ( aprastu- ta) itself will be suggested. 3. The verse is included as stanza 985 in Weber’s supplement to the Sattaäai (Das Saptaçatakam des Hàia, p. 512). It is also quoted by Mammata. The ketaka is Pandanus odemtissimus, Linn., a tree with leaves “drooping, from three to five feet long, tapering to a very long, fine, triangular point, very smooth and glossy, margins and back armed with very fine sharp spines” (Roxburgh, 707). Without being given some special explanation one would take the verse as a directly expressed aprastutaprasam- sd. It is only by inventing a special context that the figure can assume the form of a suggestion. Abhinava proceeds to furnish such a context. 4. That is to say that the expressed meaning is not aprastutapTasamsa, where the direct meaning must be non-contextual. 5. The point of the objection is that a person would not normally address a bee in this personal fashion. In order to make sense of the vocative we have to suppose that the lady is really[ § 2.27h L"},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":"353referring to something else. 6. The lady is not a biologist or a logician. She might well address a personal remark to a bee. 7. The description of the bee’s folly is singularly compatible with the folly of the lady’s lover. So a reference to his fickleness suggests itself to us. 8. The “reservoir of nectar” is the moon. That which appears on the moon is its mark (our “man in the moon”). Women painted designs (pattrabhanga) in red saffron or in black aloe on their breast or cheek; see Ingalls, An Anthology of Sanskrit Court Poetry, HOS Voi. 44, note on vs. 389, p. 498. This verse is discussed by J. L. Masson, “Abhinavagupta as a Poet,” Journal of the Oriental Institute (Madras) Voi. 19 (1970), pp. 247-253. 9. A prativastüpamä is a figureconsisting of two sentences, the latter forming an analogy to the former. In the later system of figures (from Udbhata onward) a prativastüpamä must fulfill three conditions: ( 1 ) there must be no word such as iva to denote the similarity; (2) the analogous objects must possess the same quality or action (not a sim ilar one as in the figure udäharana (“example”); (2) the common property must be expressed by a different word or phrase in each of the two sentences. An example is Kâlidâsa’s description of King Dillpa (Ragh. 1.18) ‘To benefit his people he took taxes from them. The sun draws up water to pour it forth a thousandfold.” “Take” and “draw up” refer to the same action by different words.10. The literal sense of the stanza is that a substance which lies on the moon and which has a beauty like the beauty of aloe markings on a woman’s breast, is really the god of love. This suggests two sentences related as in a prativastüpamä: (1) The aloe markings on your breast are really the god of love”; and (2) T he dark substance on the moon is really the god of love.” The phrase “dark as the petal of a blue waterlily” is introduced by Abhinava in order to fulfill the third condition of a prativastüpamä, mentioned in the previous footnote, that the phrase used to describe the common quality in the second sentence must be different from the phrase used in the first sentence. 11. Hetu is Dandin’s name for the term (2.235). Udbhata (Induräja 6.7) calls it kävyahetu and later writers know it as käin/alinga. 12. Upameyopa- mä: a simile followed by a sentence in which the two terms of the simile are reversed. 13. Source unknown. In the cosmology that regards the earth as fiat and circular, four (or sometimes eight) elephants are said to support it at the chief compass points. Their stirring causes earthquakes. The impact of a bee, on the other hand, though the bee falls from a great height, is scarcely felt. 14. For once BP errs i interpreting the sentence. The identification of the lady’s eyes with springtime, of her eyebrows with love’s bow, and of her mouth with wine are metaphors (rüpaka) and are directly expressed. The atis'ayokti consists in joining three objects (spring, love and wine) which in the real world are not joined but merely cooperative. This joining is only suggested. Spring, love and wine are not actually said to be joined in the stanza, but as they are identified with the eyes, brow and mouth of a single§ 2.27 h L ]"},{"pageNumber":369,"pageContent":"body, we see that they must be pictured as joined. 15. We do not know who these authors were.354 [§ 2.27 h LA Having thus analysed the province of suggested figures of speech, in order now to show their usefulness [the Kärikä] says:K Those figures of speech which cannot be made into the body of a poem when they are directly expressed, attain the highest beauty when they form a part of dhvani.A Forming a part of dhvani can occur in two ways, by being a suggestor or by being suggested. Here, in view of the context, we are to understand that being suggested is meant. But figures of speech, even when suggested (vyangya), form a variety of dhvani only when they form the predominant sense of the passage. Otherwise they fall under “subordinated suggestion,” as will be explained [viz., in 3.34).L Now figures of speech have long ago been defined by the crit­ics, so it might be doubted that anything very wonderful has been accomplished by our author in showing that they may be suggested. To allay this doubt he says, H aving th u s analysed, etc.[Abhinava first interprets the Kärikä by taking väcyatvena as a single word, thus eliminating the negative.] “Those figures of speech which by being directly expressed are made into the body of a poem.” Making into the body of a poem means taking a figure, which as it is something other than the subject matter in hand is not naturally the body of the poem any more than a bracelet or the like is the body of the person"},{"pageNumber":370,"pageContent":"who wears it, and making this figure into the body of the poem, a transformation that can be effortlessly achieved by great poets.[Abhinava next gives the more natural interpretation of the Kärikä, dividing the word väcyatve from na so as to express a negative.] Or [we may interpret the Kärikä to say that] figures of speech which are not made into even the body of a poem—the sense is that it is difficult so to make them—when they are directly expressed: these same figures of speech by taking a suggested form become an integral part of the operation of suggestion or of the poem itself and even attain to the highest and rarest beauty, which one may call the very soul [of the poem]. What is implied is this. A good poet, like an experienced woman, uses ornaments skilfully; and yet, it is difficult for him to make an oranment pass for the body of a poem, just as it is difficult to make rouge pass [for the true flesh]; how much less can an oranment become the soul itself. But such is the property of being suggested that it imparts to an ornament, even when the ornament is not predominant, a superiority over expressed oranments. It is like the property of royalty which imparts a peculiar distinction even in the games of children.1 It is with the foregoing in mind that our author says, otherw ise, etc.1. The “king” even in children’s games acts differently from other chil­dren. Compare Horace, Epist. I, i, 59-60.§ 2.29 K ] 355A Now there are two ways in which a figure of speech can be suggested as the predominant element: it may be suggested by a mere fact or situation (vastu), or it may be suggested by [another] figure of speech.

O therw ise; sc., if it did not come into being in dependence on that. Accordingly, there is no room in such cases for a suspicion that the suggested figure might be subordinate.11. The reasoning that underlies K, A, and L in this section is the fol­lowing. In order to have poetry one must either have suggestion predominant in the poem (as in dhvani), or one must have an alankära predominant in the poem (as in subordinated suggestion). When one alankära (directly ex­pressed) suggests another alankära, the question can arise whether the second alankära is predominant or the first. But where a mere fact or situation sug­gests an alankara, the suggested alankära must be predominant, for if it were not, the verse would not be poetry at all.A These same figuresK when they cire suggested by another figure,"},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":"§ 2.30 L ]K they will form a part of dhvani if the suggested sense is seen to be predominant by its greater degree of beauty,A for we have already said [1.13 e A\\ that “the decision whether the literal or the suggested meaning is the more important depends on which is the more charming.”The province of figures of speech which are suggested by a mere fact or situation can be deduced from the examples just given. Ac­cordingly, arthasaktyudbhavänurananarüpavyangyo dhvanih (that type of suggestive poetry where the suggested sense appears like a rever­beration arising from the power of meaning) is to be understood as occurring wherever a meaning of any sort, or a meaning in the form of a particular figure of speech, gives rise to a second meaning or a second figure of speech such that the second is predominant by its possessing a greater degree of beauty than the first.L These sam e figures: this furnishes the words that must be supplied in the Kârikâ which immediately follows. Then: this word itf supplied in the middle of the Kârikâ. The word dhvanyangatâ [used in the Kârikâ and meaning literally “a property of dhvani”] means “a variety of dhvani.” If th e suggested sense is predom inant: the reason follows: by its g reater degree of beauty. “If1 : what our au­thor has in mind is that if the expressed sense rather than the suggested sense is predominant, the suggested sense will belong to “subordinated suggestion.\"Now a figure of speech is sometimes suggested by a fact or situation and sometimes it is suggested by another figure of speech. So it may be asked why our author did not give examples [of the former variety as well as of the latter] .1 He replies [to this question by the sentence, “The province of figures of speech which are suggested] by a mere fact or situation, etc.”He summarizes the whole matter in conclusion: Accordingly, etc. The upshot is that there are four varieties of arthasaktyvdbhavadhvani"},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":"358(suggestion arising from the power of meaning), deriving from the two forms, vastu (fact or situation) and alankära (figure of speech), in which either the suggestor or the suggested may appear.1. All the examples under 2.27 are of an alankära suggested by an alankära. Under previous Kärikäs examples were gives of suggestion by a vastu, but not of an alankära being suggested by a vastu.[ § 2.30 LA Thus the varieties of dhvani have been given. The followi is now said in order to distinguish them from the false varieties.K Where the suggested meaning appears indistinctly, * 1 or as sub­ordinate to the expressed meaning, that is not the province of this [type of] dhvani1. Manuscript authority seems to be equally divided between pramlista- tvena, “indistinctly\" (see Pan. 7.2.18) and praklistatvena, “with difficulty.”A A suggested sense is of two sorts: it may be clear or indistinct. Whether occasioned by the power of words or of meaning, it is only that suggestion that appears clearly that falls in the province of dhvani, not an indistinct suggestion. And even a clear suggestion is not in the province of the [type of] dhvani where the suggested sense is similar to a reverberation, if it appears as subordinate to the expressed meaning. For example:0 auntie! Without touching the lotuses or scaring away the geese, someone has laid out a cloud upside down on the village tank. 1(Mianka, Sattasai 2.10]The suggestion here, that a naive girl has seen the reflection of a cloud in the water, is subordinate to the expressed meaning."},{"pageNumber":374,"pageContent":"3591. malia = Sanskrit mrditäh (Pischel p. 171), not malitäh as given in the châyâ. piucchä = Sanskrit pitrsvasar (Pischel p. 112); I know not what confusion has lead to the gloss sahasä. uttänaam: on its back, i.e., in the reverse of the position it held in the sky. phaliham (= Sanskrit sphatika, pangha, parikhâ) makes no sense to me; surely it cannot mean praksiptam as Abhinava seems to take it. I have substituted the Sattasax reading vvidham (= vyüdham). Both Änanda and Abhinava see nothing more in the verse than a naive expression of wonder. If that is all there is, they are conect in finding a greater charm in the naive expression itself than in the suggested explanation of optical illusion. But the commentators on the Sattasat see much more. A young wife, they say, has gone off in the early morning on the pretext of drawing water from the village tank before it is muddied by the advent of others, but really in order to keep a rendezvous with her lover. The lover, however, failed to appear. Later he comes by as the young woman is chatting with her aunt. The verse is spoken by the woman in order to inform him that she kept her promise as he did not, but at the same time to hide this information from her aunt. As so often with verses from the Sattasai, one does not really know how much the author himself intended.§ 2.31 L }L T hus [the varieties of dhvani have been given, etc. The two major divisions [of suggestion] are: avivaksitavâcya (where the literal sense is not intended) and vivaksitaparavâcya where it is intended, but is subordinated to a further, suggested, sense). The for­mer, is divided into atyantatiraskrtaväcya (where the literal sense is entirely set aside) and arthäntarasankramitaväcya (where the literal sense is shifted). The latter is divided into alaksyakrama (where no interval is perceived between the literal and suggested meanings) and anurananarüpa (where the suggestion is similar to the reverberation of a bell). Of this pair the former has endless varieties. The latter has two: sabdasaktimüla (where the suggetion arises by the power of words) and arthasaktimüla (where the suggestion arises by the power of meaning). This last has three subdivisions: kavipraudhoktikrtasarira (where the suggestion is embodied in an imaginative expression of the poet), kavinibaddhavaktiyraudhoktikrtasarira (where the suggestion is embodied in an imaginative expression of a character invented by the poet), and svatahsambhavin (where the suggestion is inherently possi­ble in the real world). Now each of these three subdivisions is of four kinds depending on the distinction just given that the suggested sense and the suggestor may be either [a vastu (fact, situation) or an alankâra"},{"pageNumber":375,"pageContent":"360(figure of speech)]. Adding to these the four major divisions of sugges­tion that were mentioned first (viz., atyantatiraskrtavâcya, arthântara- samkramitavâcya, alaksyakrama, and sabdaéaktimüla), we arrive at six­teen varieties of suggestion. Now each of these sixteen varieties will be stated [3.1 K\\ to be twofold according as the suggestion is revealed by a word or by a sentence. But as alaksyakramadhvani is revealed not only by words and sentences but by phonemes (varna), by style (samghatanä), or by an entire work [cf. 3.2], we get in all thirty-five varieties.To distinguish, that is, to separate, [these thirty-five varieties] from the false varieties of suggestionT h at sort of poem is not th e province, not the domain, of this dhvani which is the soul [of poetry].[Abhinava translates the verse from the Sattasai into Sanskrit as follows.]The lotuses have not been sulliedand the geese have not suddenly been driven off[but] someone has thrown a cloudupside down into the village tank.But others say that piucchä [does not mean “suddenly,” but] is a voca­tive, meaning “aunt.” “Someone” : some one extremely dexterous.S u bordinate to th e expressed m eaning: from the expressed meaning, it being in the form of a manifestation of wonder, we under­stand the extreme naivete [of the girl]; and so the charm of the verse lies just in the expressed meaning. On the other hand, it is only because the expressed meaning wants support in order to become rationally intelligible that it suggests to us a second meaning. 11. To say that a cloud has been thrown (as Abhinava understands the verse) into the village tank is absurd and irrational. The absurdity is ratio­nalized by our accepting the suggestion that the girl has seen a reflection of the cloud in the water.[ § 2.31 L"},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"§ 2.31 b A ]As the young wifebusy with her housework hears birds flying up from the cane thicket, her limbs fail her. 1Such verses, as will be shown later, are generally to be adduced as examples of subordinated suggestion.1. The verse is included, as number 874, in Weber’s edition of the Sat- tasai. The young woman has apparently promised to meet her lover in the cane thicket but is prevented by the dreary chores of her married life. The flight of the birds tells her that her lover has kept his promise and is await­ing her in vain. The suggestion (that her lover has entered the thicket) has no particular charm or beauty; hence Mammata categorises the verse under asvndaram vyangyflm (5.132). The description of the young woman, how­ever, physically broken by her disappointment, moves our emotion. Thus the expressed meaning is predominant over (more beautiful than) the suggested.L [After translating the Prakrit verse, Abhinava comments as follows.] What is here suggested, namely that the secret lover has arrived at the agreed upon rendezvous, serves merely to support (or rationalize) the expressed meaning. To explain: “busy with her house­work” : although her mind is intent on other things. “The young wife” : although she is constrained by great shyness and by subserviency [to her'elders]. “Her limbs”: there is not a single limb which can be pre­vented by the deepest dissimulation [from revealing her longing]. “Fail her” : far be it from finishing the housework, she cannot even support her own body. While she was engaged in housework her limbs were not seen to be in that state. From this expressed sense we understand that the young woman is utterly overcome by love and from this comes the charm of the verse.A But where the particular meaning of a direct expression has been determined by our understanding of the context or some like factor"},{"pageNumber":377,"pageContent":"362and where this expressed meaning then appears as subordinate to the suggested meaning, we are indeed on the road of this type of dhvani that is similar to a reverberation. For example:0 farmer's bride,gather the flowers on the groundand don’t shake the éephâlikâ tree.Your bangles will end on an ugly note if your husband’s father hears them. 1Here we have a wife, who is engaged in sex with her paramour, being warned by a friend because of the noise, heard afar, of her jingling bangles. This [context] is necessary in order to understand the direct meaning. But after the expressed meaning has been understood, inas­much as it has been expressed only in order to furnish the final meaning which is the hiding of the woman’s adultery, it becomes subordinate to the suggestion. Accordingly, the verse should be included in the type of dhvani where the suggested sense is similar to a reverberation.1. This verse too is included in Weber’s edition of the Sattasai (num­ber 959). The reading of our text in c can scarcely be right, as viravo repeats the sense of saddo. The Sattasai reading is esa avasänaviraso. Abbinava seems to have read esa avasänavisamo. For the éephâlikâ (or sinduvdra) tree, see M. Emeneau, University of California Publications in Classical Philol­ogy 12 (1933-34) pp. 333-346 and Ingalls, HOS 44, p. 490 (note on vs. 271a). The tree blooms only at night, with beautiful, scentless white flowers. Thus the time of the adultery as well as the place (a garden) is indicated. The father-in-law is presumably within hearing of the friend’s advice. He might well be annoyed at his daughter-in-law’s shaking flowers from his favorite tree, but the friend regards the rousing of such annoyance as a lesser evil than the fury which would seize the old man if he guessed the true cause of the jingling bangles.[ § 2.31b AL B u t where: where the sense has its nature determined by our understanding of a factor in that set of factors beginning with con­text and including the proxi ity of another word, inherent capability, gender, etc.,1 but where this expressed m eaning th en —then be­cause, having been directly expressed, its own understanding has been completed—does not conclude the sentence meaning by just this sense but goes on to assume a subordinate role in a suggested meaning: such an instance is in the realm of dhvani. Our author’s clearly stating the connection with a final meaning in the form of suggestion is tantamount"},{"pageNumber":378,"pageContent":"to saying that we must consider such cases to be the very opposite of “subordinated suggestion.”“Your bangles will end on an ugly note if your husband’s father hears them” : because the father-in-law has been preserving the sephälikä tree with particular care and will be angry at its being pulled or shaken. We are to suppose [the expressed meaning to be] that the ugly result will be on this account, for otherwise [that is, if the ugly result were taken to be on account of the daughter-in-law’s adultery], the suggested sense of the verse would be given away by the direct expression. Beyond this, we are to interpret the stanza as we did the stanza, “Who wouldn’t be angry” (kassa vä na hoi roso).2T his, i.e., this suggestion, is necessary for our understanding, our getting at, the direct meaning. That is to say, without it no direct meaning can be got because this meaning [without the suggested sense given by the context] would be something perfectly obvious [to the adulteress] and so not worth saying. But now it might be objected that at this rate the suggested meaning serves merely to support (or rationalize) the expressed meaning [and so is subordinate to it]. To prevent such an objection our author continues: b u t after th e ex­pressed m eaning has been understood; in other words, after it has been directly expressed.1. The reference is to the list of factors by means of which an inherently ambiguous expression can be narrowed down to the particular sense intended. The,list occurs in Bhartrhari, VP 2.315-316 and is repeated by Mammata under 2.19. 2. See 1.4 f A, L, where Abbinava gave six different suggestedsenses, the suggestions differing according to the various persons supposed to be overhearing the verse. Tripathi (p. 649), following Abhinava’s direction, does the same for the present stanza.§ 2.32 Introduction A ] 363A While on the subject of distinguishing in this way vivaksita- väcya dhvani (sugestive poetry where the literal meaning is intended but leads to a further meaning) from the appearance thereof, one may distinguish avivaksitaväcya (suggestive poetry where the literal mean­ing is not' intended) in the same way. To do this, the Kärikä says:"},{"pageNumber":379,"pageContent":"[ § 2.32 KK If a word that shifts [from its primary meaning] (skhaladgati) is used out of lack of mature judgment (avyatpatti) or lack of skill, such [a word] too is not in the province of dhvani.A If a word that shifts [from its primary meaning], that is, a word of secondary sense (upacarita), is used out of lack of mature judgment or lack of skill, such [a word] too is not in the province of dhvani.L W hile on th e subject of distinguishing: this is a loca­tive, used causally. The sense is, because of the cogency [to the subject about to be raised] of the [previouis] mention (prastäva) of the dis­tinction from the appearance—appearance of what?—the needed com­pletion of the sense is furnished by the word vivaksitaväcyasya. On the other hand, if we take prostata in its simple (sposta) meaning [of “begun” or “under discussion”], the passage makes no sense, for the distinguishing of vivaksitaväcya from the appearance thereof has al­ready been completed; it is not now begun, nor is it to be continued in what follows.A word th a t shifts from its primary meaning: that is, a metaphor­ical (gauna) word or a word used in a relational secondary sense (lâ- ksanika).1 Lack of m atu re judgm ent: as writing with a view merely to compose alliterations and the like; for example:Prenkhatpremaprabandhapracuraparicaye praudhasimantininäm cittäkäsävakäse triharati satatam yah sa saubhägyabhümih.Happy is he who strolls within the rooms of women’s hearts, the which are well acquainted with every subtle sort of swaying love.Here the word “swaying” (prehkhat), used in a relational secondary sense [sc., for unsteady, fickle], has been used because of the poet’s passion for alliteration and the metaphor “rooms” which the poet has used [for hearts2] leads to no beautiful goal whatsoever in the form of suggestion.3"},{"pageNumber":380,"pageContent":"§ 2.33 In troduction A ] 365Lack of skill: such as inability in filling out the meter; for example:O foremost of the numerous entourage of Love, your sinking to the ocean, this dish of rolling waves, has imparted undulation to your level self.Here the first word (the compound word “foremost of the numerous entourage of Love”) is an indirect expression for the moon; “dish” is used for receptacle; and “level” (literally “wall-like”) for unmoving. None of this produces any beauty [or has any use at all] except to fill out the meter.4Such [a word] too: In the first Uddyota, apropos of “poets who use words in senses furnished merely by convention,\" our author gave an example of secondary usage (bhäkta = upacarita), viz., “the lotus- petal couch speaks [the fever of a slender maid].” (1.14 A]. The force of the word “too” in the present passage is to say that not only was that example not in the domain of suggestive poetry, but so also a word such as is here referred to.1. See 1.1 K, note 2. 2. BP seems to take cittâkâéa as a rüpaka-samäsa, i.e., cittaivàkâsa, heart and space having the same property of im- perceptability. Such an interpretation explains Abhinava's denomination of äkäsa as gauna. But it would be more natural to take cittâkdéa as equiva­lent to hrdayâkàéa, the physical interior of the heart. The real vice of the stanza, it seems to me, is not its misuse of laksanä but its verbosity: avakâéa adds nothing (except alliteration) to cittâkâéa, procura is needless; satibhagya- bhimih achieves a repetition of the phoneme bh but means nothing more than svbhagah. 3. The only poetic purpose of using laksanä is to produce dhvani. Here it has been used only to produce alliteration. 4.

While it is true that in the preceding chapters the types [of dhvani] such as avivaksi- taväcya were distinguished by means of the literal sense (väc y a) and thus, insofar as the literal sense may act as a suggestor—and we see from 1.13 “either sense or word, etc.” that it can—these types have already been distinguished by the factors which act as suggestors, nev­ertheless these literal senses were there analysed according to what was suggested by them. Thus the unintended literal sense (amvaksitaväcya) was subordinated to the suggested sense and the intended literal sense (vivaksitänyaparaväcya) was said to “lead toward the suggested sense.” Thus the meanings that act as suggestors of the basic types of sugges­tion and of the_sub-types were distinguished only by recourse to, by reference to, the meanings they suggested. Therefore he says: through an analysis of those factors w hich act as th e suggestors.But more than this, while it is true that a meaning that acts as a suggestor may also be capable of being suggested, a word can act only as a suggestor and can never be suggested.

That analysis was indeed made by reference to suggestor factors. But although made, it will now be made again by reference to purely suggestor factors.2 Thus, without reference to the suggested sense, one can divide suggestors into words, sentences, phonemes, word-components, texture (sanghatanä), and long sections of poetry. But none of these, like the literal meaning, is ever capable of being suggested. So the point of his statement is that the varieties [of dhvani in the Third Chapter] will be described exclusively on the basis of the [verbal] suggestors.A certain commentator3 has explained the Vrtti's phrase “through an analysis of what is suggested” as follows: “by reference to that which is suggested, namely vastu, alankära, and rasa.” He should be questioned in these terms: It was not the author of the Kârikâs who made this threefold division; it was the author of the Vrtti who pointed it out [cf. 1.4 a A]. And it is not the author of the Vrtti who will make the [new] divisions [in Chapter Three].4 Therefore, what kind of logic would it be to say, “he did that and now he is doing this,” when the agent is not one and the same person?5 Moreover, this explanation hardly makes a contextual connection with the whole of the book that has gone before, because other varieties also, such as avivaksitaväcya, have already been shown.6 But enough argument with an elder member of my own family.71 .1.e., the discussion in Chapter Three will be distinguished by its treat­ing suggestor words (as opposed to suggestor meanings), which were not treated in the previous chapters. 2. By purely suggestor factors (suddha- vyanjaka) Abhinava means words, phonemes, etc., which are purely sugges­tive, never suggested. 3. The reference is to Abhinava’s kinsman, the author of the Candrikd. 4. The division into padaprakäsatä, väkyaprakäsatä, etc., is given by the author of the Kdrikas in 3.1-2 K. 5. Certainly Abhinava here speaks as if he supposed the author of the Kdrikds to be a different person from the author of the Vrtti. But in introducing 3.2 he will take quite the opposite point of view. For the question whether Kdrikdkdra and Vrttikdra were the same man, see Introduction, pp. 25-27. In view of Abhinava’s own ambiguous stance in regard to the question, his criticism of the Candrikäkära here seems a carping one. Nor is it greatly strengthened by the argument that Abhinava subjoins. 6. Abhinava’s point is that the explanation given by the earlier commentator can, at the very most, demonstrate the logical[ § 3.1 Introduction L"},{"pageNumber":386,"pageContent":"371connection of the third chapter with only a part of the earlier portion of the work, namely the portion in the first chapter where vastu, alankam, and rasa were mentioned as divisions of dhvani-, it will not demonstrate the logical con­nection with chapter two, where avivaksitaväcya and vivaksitänyaparaväcya have been mentioned as divisions of dhvani. 7. Kane (HSP p. 198) is prob­ably correct in here emending püjyajanasagotraih to pürvajanasagotraih, for Abhinava in other passages regularly refers to the author of the Candrikâ as pûrvavamsa, and sagotra is merely a synonym of vaméa.

In this variety a word may serve as the suggestor, as in this line of the great sage Vyäsa:these seven are the kindling sticks of royalty. 1 Another example is in a line of Kalidasa:When you put on your armor, who could be forgetful of his wife pining in his absense?1for what serves not as ornament to a sweet configuration?3In these examples the words “kindling sticks,” “armor,” and “sweetr have been used for their suggestive qualities."},{"pageNumber":387,"pageContent":"3721.

As the monsoon season was normally a time for staying at home and enjoying domestic bliss, the sight of gathering clouds would naturally remind a traveler of his wife waiting for him at home. As a cloud does not actually don armor, one takes the word samnaddha in the secondary sense of udyata, prepared as for a campaign, here accompanied by wind, thunder and lightning. The suggestion, as L will point out, is of a cruel and irresistible opponent. 3. Éâhintala 1.17. The whole verse:[ § 3.1 AThe pond lily circled by moss is charming;the moon’s mark though black,gives it a royal beauty;and this slender damsel,even in her rough dress, is lovely;for what serves not as ornamentto a sweet configuration?L In the Kärikä the word “and” ( ca) serves to prevent a sequen­tial ordering of the two pairs of terms. 1 Thus avivakaitaväcya, in both its types, is twofold insofar as it can be suggested by either a word or by a sentence. The type, namely “suggested gradually” (kramadyotya.), of wvaksitänyaparaväcya, which latter is other than avivaksitavâcya, along with its sub-types [namely sabdaéaktimüla and arthaéaktimüla] is like­wise twofold. It is called anvrananarüpavyangya because its suggested meaning (vyangya) is such that its appearance is like the appearance of a reverberation.The great sage: this harks back to what was said earlier [l.le A), that suggestive poetry “is also found in such works as the Rämäyana, Mahäbhärata, and the like.”Firmness, forbearance, self-controlpurity, pity, kindliness of speech,and constant faithfulness to friends:these are the seven kindling sticks of royalty.2Here the literal meaning of the word kindling sticks is completely set aside because it is impossible. What the word “kindling sticks” suggests"},{"pageNumber":388,"pageContent":"373is the intention of the speaker, the suggested sense, namely that the capacity to strengthen royalty depends on nothing other [than these seven factors].3 Although the purpose of giving the present example has been served by such examples [already given] as “like a mirror blinded by breath [cf. 2.1 c A), nonetheless these further examples have been given here, where an occasion for them arises, in order to show how they pervade a great part of literature. As one may easily supply the discarding of the literal sense here from what our. author has just said, there is no need for his expressly repeating the fact.The word arm or, because it is here impossible in the literal sense, conveys, by secondary usage, the sense of being prepared, and thus sug­gests what the writer intends, namely cruelty, irresistibility, rashness, etc. In the same way, the word sweet conveys, by secondary usage, the giving of pleasure, satisfaction and the like, to all people, and suggests the speaker’s intention, namely that it is not surprising that such a shape should be the object of intense desire.41. Withoutco, we should follow the principle laid down by Pänini (1.3.10) and connect the first member (avivaksitaväcya) of the pair of suggestions with the first member (pada) of the pair of suggestors; likewise the second member ( anurananarüpaxn/aiigya) of the suggestions with the second member (väkya) of the suggestors.

In a footnote to our text Pt. ârî Mahâdeva àâstrï points out this distinction. The secondary meaning (laksyärtha) of the word samidh is capability of production; what is suggested (vyangyärtha) is the fact that royalty depends on nothing other than these seven factors. 4.

[The complete stanza from which he quotes is as follows:]1The cruel demon treated you as one expects of such a being angered by rejection: and you too bore the blow as a lady of high bi should bear it, with your head held high.But the witness of your death, who bears his weapon now to no avail.Rama, being overmuch in love with life,has failed, my beloved, to be worthy of his love.When [Rävana] was forcibly rejected [by you], since he is cruel by his very nature as a demon and through evil pride feels that his or­ders are not to be disobeyed, he acted, blind with rage, in conformity with his spirit when he cut off your head, for his intention was that no one else should ever transgress his command. Treated “you”: the sense is, you, by whom even such [a despot] was not heeded. And you bore the blow without flinching, open-eyed and with a face as calm as on a holiday. “As”: in the manner of. “A lady”: even a woman of low birth who wishes to be called a lady will hold her head high to give the impression that she is a lady. But you held it up bravely at the moment of decapitation, as if to say, “let it be done quickly.” You held your head high as real ladies do because you had always done so. Thus both Rävana and you behaved throughout with propriety. But the part I played turns out to be most improper. My banishment robbed me of opportunities to use my bow, but it might at least have proved useful in protecting my wife. Now that I have failed to protect"},{"pageNumber":390,"pageContent":"375you in your need, it becomes wholly useless; yet here I still carry it. The only reason one can imagine is to protect my own life; and this is not proper. “By Rama”: the meaning of this word is developed into suggested qualities2 [beside the literal meaning of Rama, the son of Daiaratha], such as being disposed to unequalled daring, truthfulness, appropriate behavior, etc. The explanation of the term “et cetera,” found in a [certain] commentary, that it stands for cowardice and other such qualities, is incorrect. For this behavior, far from being inap­propriate, would be proper in the case of a coward. “My beloved”: this has become a mere word now, for that which justifies the use of the word “beloved” is love, and that has been sullied by impropriety. Thus, the tragedy of Rama3 is made clear by the combination of [the sthäyibhäva] grief, the älambanavibhäva [namely Slta’s death], and the uddïpanavibhâva [namely her noble behavior].Let oth ers thus com pare: [After translating the Prakrit stanza Abhinava continues:] By “thus” the poet implies that people are nat­urally blind to distinctions. “People” : that is, those whose only course is the steps of those who have gone before. “Her cheek” : that is, of her whose precious figure possesses unique beauties. “Give the moon as a comparison to her cheek”: In order to funish a rhetorical comparison to her cheek, which is the central and predominant element of a face which is the perfection of genuine beauty, one must find some object that is of greater beauty; whereas the orb of the moon, being spoiled by its spot, is grossly inferior. Thus, although ordinary people follow in a Une Uke sheep, if discriminating people will consider the matter, [they will see that] this wretched thing deserving of pity that is called the moon is really a thing to which should attach the properties of waning, of being without real charm, and of being sulUed. For the shift of the Uteral sense to various suggested properties, one may compare what I have said previously [viz., in 2.1 a L]. The saune appears in what foUows. 1§ 3.1a L]1. The verse is taken from some Rama play that has not been identified. Apparently it contained a scene in which Rävana produced before Rama an iUusion of the severed head of Sita, an illusion that eUcits from Rama the present verse. Such an element of plot would be an easy invention in view of the scene in the Rämäyana where Rävana produces before Sita an iUusion of the severed head of Rama. 2. See 2.1 a A and L. 3. Abhinava writes loosely here. The tragic experience (karunarasa) does not belong to Rama"},{"pageNumber":391,"pageContent":"but to the reader or auditor of the play. What belongs to Räma is the emotion grief (soka).376 [ § 3.1 a LA [Coming back to] the sub-type where the literal meaning is entirely set aside, [we find that] in this sub-type a sentence [just as well as a single word] may serve as the suggestor. Thus:In what is night to all creatures the true ascetic wakes; where others wake, the sage who sees sees that it is night.[Bhagavadgitâ 2.69]For in this sentence the meanings night and waking are not intended. What is communicated is rather the attention of the saint to a knowl­edge of truth and his aversion to what is not truth. Thus the suggestive force is of the sub-type where the literal meaning is entirely set aside.L Having in this manner illustrated the two sub-types of the first variety as revealed by single words, he now illustrates them as revealed by sentences: “in what is night.” Intended: if we take the words literally, they furnish no advice for those who are to be advised. 1 What would be the use of saying that one must remain awake during the night and that one must act as if it were night the rest of the time? Therefore this sentence, its primary sense being obstructed, suggests that the ascetic, because of his extraordinary nature, is attentive to the preception of truth and averse from false perception. As the word “all” is a relative term, the literal statement is logically possible. Accord­ingly, it is wrong to supposa.that. the true sense is [not suggested but is] implied (äksipta) by the fact that “all” cannot otherwise be logically construed.2[Now to interpret the verse:] That which is night, that which causes utter confusion, to all fourteen classes of living beings from Brahma down to plants is the vision of truth. The true ascetic wakes here,"},{"pageNumber":392,"pageContent":"377seeking to attain it. This rather than mere avoidance of sensual plea­sure is what asceticism really consists in. Or, one may take the words differently. That which is night to all creatures is the deception [of mäyä}.3 The ascetic wakes here, seeking to avoid it. On the other hand, all creatures wake in false perception, that is, they are wide awake to [its presentations], whereas to the ascetic it is night, a field of non-awareness, for he is not awake to its activity. Thus he whose conduct is defined as extraordinary [i.e., the true ascetic] really sees and thinks. Of him alone are the outer and inner organs of knowledge profitably employed. Others do not see and do not think. The general sense of the verse is that one must be intent on the perception of truth. In the same way, the words “sage” and “who sees” do not cease operat­ing on rendering the literal meanings, but only after giving a suggested meaning. As the pronouns yat and tat (represented in the translation by “what” and “where”] are dependent on the other words of the sen­tence, we may say that the whole sentence, verbs and all, is suggestive. Our author states as much in the words For in this sentence, etc. Is com m unicated means is suggested. 11. It is assumed that every verse in the Bhagavadgitä must constitute God’s advice to those who are in need of it. A verse from the Gita must therefore be so interpreted as to furnish such advice. 2. An objector claims that the intended sense of the verse is furnished by arthâpatti (that which one supplies in order to resolve a logical contradiction). Abhinava insists that the intended sense is furnished by suggestion. The objector’s argument would run as follows. “The literal sense of ‘night’ is ‘a time for sleeping.’ Now there is a logical contradiction in saying ‘the ascetic wakes in the sleeping-time of all creatures,' for ‘all creatures’ is inclusive of ascetics. Thus the so-called suggested sense of waking at night, viz., the pursuit of truth, is a necessary implication, not a suggestion.” Abhinava rejects the argument by allowing “all” to mean “most” or “all other.” Thus the literal sense becomes merely inappropriate, not logically impossible. 3. The second explanation is the one chosen in Abhinava’s Gîtâbhâsya: yâ sarvesâm bkütânâm niéà, mohinî mäyä, tasyâm munir jägarti katham iyam heyeti. With this and with the statement just above that the true ascetic is more than one who simply avoids sensual pleasure, one may compare Abhinava’s comment in his Gitäbhäsya on this versè:~yogt ca sarvavyavahärän kurvàno ’pi lokottara iti niräpayatä paramesvarena samksipyäsya svarüpam kathyate: “God (i.e., Krishna) here shows that the yogin, though he may take part in every sort of worldly activity, is of extraordinary nature; and he tells us briefly what this nature is.”§ 3.1b L]"},{"pageNumber":393,"pageContent":"[ S 3.1c AA Of the same type but of the sub-type where the literal sense is shifted a sentence may serve as suggestor, as in the following:The passing of time is poison to some, nectar to others; part poison part nect to some, neither poison nor nectar to others. 1For in this sentence the information is conveyed by words which have been shifted from their literal sense of poison and nectar to the sense of pain and pleasure. Accordingly, the suggestive force is of the sub-type where the literal sense is shifted.1. Source unknown. In our printed text pâda a is two mdtras short. Badarinath Sarma corrects it by inserting via after visamato. In b he reads boleï = Sk. vyapacala(ya)ti (cf. Turner Diet. 12167), which is better than vale I = valayati, though the latter is barely possible (time “rolls on”).L That which is made of poison ( visamayitah) means that which has come to consist of poison (visamayatäm präptah). (The first group of] “some” are those who are wicked or those who have a keen judg­ment. For (the second group,) those who are virtuous or those who lack judgment, times passes as if it were made of nectar. For some, who are of mixed conduct or who are partly of sound, partly of weak judgment, (time is] part poison, part nectar. While for those who are complete fools or who have reached the final stage of yogic concentration, time passes as if it were neither poison or nectar. 1 This is the construction. The words poison and nectar, by a sort of dead metaphor such as one sees in the word lävanya2 axe used in the sense of causes of pain and pleasure, just as we say that a lemon is poison and a wood-apple is nectar; but they end up by referring to the pain itself and the pleasure that they cause. However, it is not the intention of the sentence that they should not at all refer to the cause, for without the cause pleasure and pain would not exist. This is what our author means by saying that they have been shifted from th eir literal sense. 3 (The sense"},{"pageNumber":394,"pageContent":"379of the other words in the sentence has been shifted also:]4 the sense of “some” is shifted from the indefnite to the definite [groups which the author has in mind]; the sense of “passes\" is shifted to the general sense of an activity; the sense of “time” to all the elements of worldly life. The author of the Vrtti has used the shifting of the single words poison and nectar as an example (by which the other shiftings may be judged]. That is why he specifies “in this sentence.”1. Time brings pain to the wicked by bringing them retribution for their bad deeds. It is likewise painful to the man of judgment, who sees the essenti misery of transmigration. Groups two and three follow naturally from the first. Group four is composed of those unaffected by time—those whose ahedony is due to stupid insensitivity and those who have overcome the emotions by yoga.2. For lâvanya see 1.16 K and L. When used as a frozen metaphor to mean charm, beauty, it cannot give rise to dhvani. The same holds for the words visa (visa) and-amrta (amia) in the present stanza. It is not these words but the stanza as a whole that gives rise to dhvani. 3. So the primary intention of the author of the verse is to suggest the pain and pleasure of the world as it affects different types of persons. He does this by a secondary use of words, but the literal sense of the words is not wholly abandoned. 4. Abhinava here guards against an objection which might be made to Änanda’s example. We might ask how this example differs essentially from the example in 3.1a, where a single word is shifted. Is the only difference that here two words are shifted? It will be seen that by Abhinava’s interpretation the present example is essentially different from that of 3.1 a. The suggestion here comes from a shift of meaning of the whole sentence. The way in which anything in the world affects persons depends on their karma, their judgment, and their practice of yoga.§ 3.1 d >1 IA Of that type of dhvani where the literal sense is intended but where there is [subordination to] a suggestion resembling a reverber­ation, in its sub-type arising from the power of words, a single word may act as suggestor, as in the following:If fate will have it that I am not born to fill the wants of needy men for riches, why was I. being jada, not made to be a well or pond of limpid water by the wayside?"},{"pageNumber":395,"pageContent":"380Here the word jada (witless, insentient, cool), used by the discouraged speaker in grammatical agreement with himself, comes to have, as a reverberation brought about by its own power, grammatical agreement with the well. 11. A question may arise how to correlate the present passage with Ànan- da’s statement in 2.21. He said there that we have sabdasaktyvdbhavadhvani only where an alankära is suggested. Where vastumätram (a mere fact or situation) is suggested, we have slesa. In the light of that statement the present verse at first sight would seem to exhibit slesa and not any form of dhvani. The answer is that the present verse does cany the suggestion of an alankära. Although neither Änanda nor Abhinava mentions it here, both of them refer to it in 3.33c. The verse suggests a simile (vpamä), for the speaker is likened to the pond and well. One should note that the term sabdasakty- udbhavänarananopamadhvani applies here only to the suggestion of simile. There is also rasadhvani in the verse, namely, a suggestion of säntarasa: “As my lot is so much worse than that of an insentient pond or well, all worldly objects must be regarded as useless and empty.” This final suggestion of the verse is referred to in 3.33 c (see 3.33 c A, note 6 and 3.33 c L). It is immediately perceived by the sensitive reader and does not arise like a reverberation.[ § 3.1 d AL Having in this manner given examples of the four kinds [of dhvani] referred to in the first half of the Kärikä, he now proceeds to give, in order, examples of six other variétés covered by the second half [of the Kärikä] by saying: O f th a t type of dhvani w here th e literal sense is intended, etc. Prätum means “to fill.” The plural in “riches” is meant to suggest the fulfilling of whatever need any par­ticular suppliant may have. This is why the word “needy” has been used. “Of men” :1 because generally people want money; they do not want help from virtues. “By fate,” the decree of which cannot be ques­tioned. “I”: that is to say, someone else certainly has been created [for this purpose], but not I, for which reason the speaker is dejected. A pond of limpid water is one that is useful to people. “Or a well” : the suggestion is: “even although it is not noticed by people.” Used in gram m atical agreem ent w ith him self: the word jada has the sense' “unable to think of what to do.” In the same sense jada can apply to a well, for a well lacks knowledge of who needs what. And that is why the well is jada, “cool,\" i.e., not fevered by distress at the situation. At the same time the well is jada by its connection with cool water (sitalajala)2 and so is able to help others. In this third sense the word"},{"pageNumber":396,"pageContent":"381jada if applied to the pond would be tautologous.3 So he says that it comes to have gram m atical agreem ent w ith th e well. By its own power: thus he assigns the suggestion to the category of those arising from the power of a word.41. Abhinava’s point in this remark is that the word jana (men in general, ordinary people) has been used because the common run of men want just wealth. It is only a few unusual persons who may want moral or spiritual aid, which the speaker might be able to give. 2. In interpreting puns and suggestions, d and / are regarded as interchangeable. So jada can be the same as jala (water). 3. Abhinava here seeks to explain why the Vrtti speaks of jada's attaining grammatical agreement with the well rather than the pond. It is because this third meaning which he has discovered of jada (possessing cool water) would be tautologous with prasannämbudhara (containing limpid water) already, used of the pond. 4. More literally, thus he joins [to the suggestion] the property of arising from the power of a word.§ 3.1e L ]A In the same sub-type of dhvani a sentence may act as a sug- gestor, as in the speech of Simhanäda in the Harsacarita:In this great disaster you are now all that is leftIn this cosmic destruction you are now the world-serpent Sesafor the support of the earth. * 1[//arsacanta, p. 192 bottom (Chapter 6, lines 421-2 out of 628)for this sentence clearly suggests by the power of its words a second sense that comes like a reverberation.1. Simhanäda, the field marshal, is addressing Harsavardhana after the deaths of the latter's father and elder brother.L The word mahäpralaya in its first sense is to be analyzed as maha-â-pralaya, the complete cessation of happiness.

Abhinava tries to elicit a pun from every word in the sentence. Surely no reader would understand this “direct meaning” at a moment noticeably previous to the \"suggested meaning.\" See 2.21 e A, note 1. 2. One mightadd that the two senses in conjunction suggest a si ile. viz., that King Harsa il in qualities to the world serpent.[ § 3 .1e LA In the same type of dhvani [viz., where the suggested sense appears like a reverberation] but in the sub-type where the suggestion arises from the power of a meaning furnished by a poet’s imaginative expression [cf. 2.24], a word may be the suggestor, as in the Harivijaya.1The face of early spring is decked with mango buds and scented with the rich sweet wine that soon will flow.The god of flower arrowssnatches from her a kiss without consent.2Where it is here said that the god of love snatches a kiss from the face of spring without her consent, the word asamarpitam (lit., “unoffered”), which denotes the state [of early spring], suggests by the power of its meaning [since it implies that Love seized Spring without her consent] the violence of the god.31. For this lost Prakrit poem by the royal poet Sarvasena. see V. Ragha- van, Bhoja, pp. 810-11.

Here the attributive ‘‘pre­cious” is placed after its noun in the compound because there is no rule of order in Prakrit.1 Chana means festival. Mukham means both beginning and'face: and this is joined to surâmodam.2 The basic mean­ing is that in the beginning of spring love stirs our hearts. But this becomes suggestive of a further sense because of the striking expression of the poet.1. But this is not true. If it were, the Prakrit language would be unintel­ligible. F\\irthermore, in Abhinava’s interpretation prosava makes very little sense. 2. Abhinava’s interpretation amounts to this. At the very beginning of spring comes the Love-Festival (Manmathotsava). Under its influence the love god in our hearts takes delight in the vernal beauty and seizes it even in its childhood. This suggests how violent our love will become when spring is fully grown. Abhinava does not note the obvious meaning of surâmodam (scented with wine).A Within the same sub-type a sentence may act as the sug- gestor, as in the verse already quoted “The fragrant month prepares,” etc., [see 2.24 A]. There the meaning of the sentence, viz., that the fragrant month prepares but does not yet give the arrows to the god of love, being embodied in an imaginative expression of the poet, suggests spring’s destructive stage of stirring up love [which is about to come]."},{"pageNumber":399,"pageContent":"[ § 3.1 g LL Our author has not given an example either of a word or a sentence as suggestor of the sub-type of suggestion arising from a meaning embodied in an imaginative expression of a character invented by the poet [cf. 2.24 A], This is because what he has given is sufficient to illustrate the specific words of Kärikä 2.24: “it may be given body simply by an imaginative expression.” An example of a word acting as suggestor in that sub-type would be:Truly fair women are objand truly wealth is fair;but life is unsteady and as quickly goneas the glance of a tipsy girl.( Cänakyaräjanttisästra]1In this verse there speaks a disenchanted (virägin) character created by the poet, suggesting by force of the meaning embodied in the word “life“ the following. All these sensual pleasures and riches are of use only to one’s life. When one’s life is gone, even though they still exist, they come to be as if non-existent. And life, which consists in preserving the vital breaths,2 is nothing to rely on, because the functioning of the vital breaths is so tenuous.

The idea that we form of their beauty can be assigned, by positive and negative agreement, to particular parts of the collection. Accordingly, there is no contradition in our assigning of dhvani to indi­vidual words insofar as they are suggestive [of this kind of beauty in the whole poem). The following slokas will give support ( to our position).“Just as the sound of what is unpleasant makes a verse faulty, as is manifested in the faults srutidusta, etc.; just so does the reminding us of what is pleasant constitute a virtue.“Therefore there is beauty in all those varieties of dhvani which ap­pear in single words, even though a single word serves only as a re­minder.“Just as a woman appears beautiful by a single ornament which im­parts to her some special attraction, so the speech of a good poet is beautiful by means of the dhvani revealed by a single word.\"1. The objection must come from a Präbhikara Mlmämsaka. In Prabhä- kara’s theory väcakatva, conceived as the power of transmitting valid infor­mation, must produce a new cognition. The individual words simply remind us of objects which we already know. 2. Abhinava will point out that this answer is a chala, a trick in which the opponent’s meaning is intentionally misunderstood (cf. Nyàya S. 1.2.10-17). By väcakatva the Präbhäkara means ' the power to convey a specific piece of new information, whether fact or sug­gestion.

It is with this in mind that our author says: poem s [like hum an bodies], etc. For it has been said before: “the teaching that (a sentence] has parts applies only at the time of analysis.” 4But how can we shift the area in which we apprehend beauty to the parts [of the sentence, which are its words], for the individual words do not express the sentence meaning but merely bring objects to mind? Well, why not? Why should words not be causes of our apprehending beauty, since they remind us of beautiful suggestions? To take a con­trary instance: a word such as pelava “delicate” is not denotative of any obscene sense such as pela “testicle,” but merely brings that sense to mind; and on that account a poem, as being a thing of beauty, is “spoiled by its sound (smtidusta).” This fault of being srutidusta is assigned by positive and negative agreement to the parts of a poem. The same should be the case with [the causes of beauty] which are under discussion. He puts the matter thus: Ju st as th e sound of w hat is unpleasant, etc. The sense is, the sound of what reminds us of that which is unpleasant. M akes a verse faulty: that is, un­beautiful. V irtue: as much as to say beauty. Having thus given a [counter-Jexample in the first three quarters of the sloka, he gives that which the example illustrates in the fourth. Then he sums up: T here­fore there is beauty, etc. The syntax [of his argument] is this. As the memory of what is pleasant constitutes a beauty, therefore in all va­rieties of dhvani that have been described, even in that which appears in single words, even in that which is revealed by a single word, there is beauty, even though words function only as reminders. The word api (“even though”) is construed in both directions on the principle of a crow’s eye.s Finally he shows by positive and negative agreement how our apprehension of beauty arises from a single word: Ju st as a 1 * 3[ § 3.1 j L1. That is, the view is based on the fifth of the five meanings assignedto dhvani by Abhinava (1.131). From the points of view represented by the other four definitions the objection could not arise. 2.

A word is a collec­tion of phonemes. A sentence is a collection of words. Texture is a property both of words and sentences. A complete work is a collection of connected sentences. It is with this in mind that the author of the Kärikä has listed phonemes, etc., in the order here given. The term “etc.” refers to parts of a word, groups of two words, etc. The locative in varnapadädisv. is the locative of cause.2 The term “shines forth,\" as it implies the illuminating of the entire poem, confirms the nature of [dhvani to be] a type of poetry, as [we have seen] before.1. Note that in this sentence Abhinava writes as if the author of the Vrtti were the same person as the author of the Kärikäs. Contrast 3.1 Intr. L, note 5. 2. Wherever possible Abhinava wants to understand - dhvani as“suggestive poetry,” rather than as “suggestion.” He is able to do so here by taking the locative according to Vârttika 6 on Pan. 2.3.36 ( carmani dvipinam hauti: one kills a leopard for its skin). Instead of meaning udhvani (i.e., suggestion) shines forth in phonemes, words, etc.,\" the Kärikä will mean, by Abhinava’s interpretation, “dhvani (i.e., suggestive poetry) shines forth"},{"pageNumber":405,"pageContent":"because of [skilfully employed] phonemes, words, etc.” The locative in vdkye, however, he will take differently; see 3.4 c L.390 [ § 3.2 LA Lest one should hesitate in accepting this statement, feeling that phonemes are meaningless and therefore cannot suggest anything, the following is stated.K The phonemes s, s, dh, and conjunct phonemes containing r, when used to excess, are hindrances in [the rasa of] love. These phonemes do not produce rasa [of that variety].These same phonemes, when used in the rasa of loathing, [cru­elty,] etc., illumine their goal. Hence they do produce rasa [in those varieties] .11. In Kärikä 3 one must read te na separately; in 4 one must read iena as a single word. Rasacyut can only mean “dripping rasa\"; ci. the similar compounds madacyvt, madhucyvt, etc. In other words, Abhinava’s first ex­planation (see below) is the only one that can be justified by idiom. The varieties of harshness remarked on in these Kärikäs pass unnnoticed in so generally harsh a language as English, but they have often been noticed in more musical languages. For the effort to avoid sibilants in Latin, see Quintil­ian 9.4.37-38, for other harsh conjuncts ibid 11.3.35. The letter r was called by Persius (1.109) canina litten (the dog’s letter) from its suggestion of a dog’s growl.

The positive precept comes after in the form of a qualification that this usage is not always to be avoided but is permissible in such rasas as bibhatsä. The author of the Vrtti, on the other hand, places the positive first in order to observe the custom of placing the word anvaya before the word vyatireka.*The following is meant. Although the cause of aesthetic pleasure (rasa) is the combined apprehension of the vibhävas, anubhävas, and vyabhicäribhävas,5 it is self-evident that the vibhävas, etc., are conveyed by words of a given phonetic shape. Therefore even the particular character of phonemes, as soft, harsh, etc., which is grasped by the ear regardless of whether the meaning has been noticed at the time when they are heard, is helpful to the relishing of rasa. It is on this account, namely in order to convey the fact that phonemes are helpful, that the locative of cause was used [in 3.2 K] in the expression varnapadädisu. It is not that rasa is suggested solely by phonemes, for we have said many times that aesthetic pleasure arises from a combination of the vibhävas, etc. But phonemes have a nature of their own, grasped only by the ear, which does take part in producing the flow of aesthetic pleasure. They"},{"pageNumber":407,"pageContent":"392are similar in this respect to the sounds of a song without words, or to the various notes (jâti), rhythms (karana) and ghra, etc.6 of a drum, guitar, or the like.[ § 3.3-4 L1. By Abhinava’s addition of the word pradhäna, it would seem that he interprets the verse as a warning against conjuncts that contain a predomi­nance of r ’s, i.e., more than one r. If so, we should expect rkr instead of hr in the first example. But the combination rkr is not likely to occur in Sanskrit.2. Pamsä vrttih “harsh alliteration” is defined by Udbhata, 1.4 Induräja, 1.6 Vivrti, as containing these phonemes. 3.

The verse gives the words of King Udayana, who wrongly believes his queen Väsavadattä to have perished in a palace fire. The situation has been dramatized in many plays but this particular verse is from the play of Mätra- räja. In commenting on this verse as quoted by Mammata (7, ex. 187) Nâgeéa Bhatta and others have erroneously ascribed it to the Ratnâvalï. Some MSS follow this verse by another verse exemplifying the same suggestive use of the word fe. The extra verse, which is not commented on by L, begins jhagiti kanakacitre and is given by our text in a footnote to page 304. Its translation is as follows.The moment the golden deer appeared,my beloved's eyes blossomed and sent forth those glances,like blue waterlily petals ruffled in a breeze,which as I remember them still burn my heart.The words will be those of Rama remembering Sita.§ 3.4a L ]L M ay also be present in a w ord: that is, may be present also' when a word acts as a cause1 of the suggested sense. Thus the intention is as follows. Aesthetic pleasure comes [strictly speaking] only from the vibhâvas. etc. But when these vibhävas, etc., being conveyed by some particular word, bring about a specially delightful relish (rasa- camatkära), we ascribe the power [of suggestion] to the word alone.For in this verse: this is the lament of Vatsaräja, in whom heavy sorrow is aroused by his hearing of the burning of Väsavadattä. And inasmuch as the sorrow has here arisen from the destruction of a beloved person, such gestures of that person as the motions of her eyebrows or her sidelong glances, which formerly made her an object of sexual desire—these very gestures as now recurring to his memory—give rise to tragedy (karuna), in which the sense of loss is absolute.2 This much is clear. Now. in the phrase “those eyes,” the word “those” (te) serves as the special cause of the tragic rasa by suggesting various memory- pictures of the qualities that her eyes possessed, qualities which are indescribable and which can only be felt by the speaker.Thus, what a certain [commentator] has objected to and answered are both false. He objected that the word “those\" cannot possess this power, sincé it must refer to something previously mentioned.3 His answer was that the speaker was under the influence of rasa [when he spoke].4 Neither the objection nor the answer should ever have been raised.5 Where the relative yad has shown that a thing possesses a property that may occur together with some second property still to"},{"pageNumber":409,"pageContent":"394be mentioned, there the word tad then shows the copresence [of that second property] with the first property that we still bear in mind.6 So the rule that ayad and tad must go together” refers to the anaphoric usage of tad. On the other hand, where the word tad is used to suggest a particular memory-picture induced by some cause,7 as in the phrase “that pot” [meaning the pot which I remember as having seen before], in such and similar expressions, the word tad has no reference whatever to anything mentioned previously. So enough of arguing with persons who think themselves learned but whose references are wrong.By the words “trembling,” etc., the speaker of the stanza imagines the symptoms (anubhävas) of the queen’s fear. The thought that he has been unable to prevent [that fear] is a stimulus (vibhäva) of the sorrow which fills him. [He speaks of] casting “those” eyes, that is, eyes which, although they were always the unique abode of beauty-in-motion, were now helpless, finding no goal of sight in their terror and as if asking “Who will save me? Where is my husband?\" That “those” eyes of hers should have been reduced to such a condition acts as a stimulant (uddipana) of the speaker’s sorrow in an exceptional degree. “Cruel\": such is the very nature [of fire] and cannot be helped. And yet, the fire was blinded by smoke and so was unable to see [the queen], for it is inconceivable that an informed agent should do such an improper deed. Thus the memory of the beauty of her eyes now acts as a stimulus of the sorrow which overwhelms the king. All this development of meaning is achieved by the presence of the word “those.” In this manner (the suggestive power of particular words] should be explained in the case of other examples. 11. Abhinava is taking the locative word pade (Text, p. 304, line 1) as ni ittasaptamï rather than as expressing place where. See above, 3.2 L, note 1. 2. BhNS distinguishes tragedy (kannarasa) from love in separa­tion (vipralambhasrngära) by the fact that the emotion (bhäva) is absolute, unqualified (nirapeksa), whereas in vipralambhasrngära the emotion is rela­tive; its object is merely removed, not destroyed. 3. The commentator who is being criticized (presumably the Candrikäkära) based his criticism on the anaphoric use of the pronoun tad (its use as “picking up” the relative y ad). 4.. And hence apparently unable to remember grammatical requirements. The remark is historically interesting, as it shows that the Candrikä-kära still held to the old conception of rasa as simply a heightened form of bhäva. See Intro­duction, p. 18 and footnote 29. 5. For the expression anutthänopahata see2.4 L., note 40. 6. The passage becomes more lucid if we read anüddeksya-mäna, as BP suggests, in place of anüddisyamâna. In the sentence yo vidvän[ § 3.4 a L"},{"pageNumber":410,"pageContent":"395sa püjyah, “he who is learned is worthy of honor,\" the relative pronoun yo shows the man’s possession of the property vidvattva to be combinable with some second property.

Theappearance of recollections is always due to some cause, such as the experi­ence of something similar to or something in some way connected with the recollection.§ 3.4 b A ]A The suggestion may arise through a part of a word [e.g., through a single component of a compound word], as in the follow­ing.Her face was bowed in shyness in the presence of our elders and she forced back the grief that gave motion to her breast.But did not the mere corner of her eye, lovelier than a startled deer’s, somehow, as it dropped a tear, tell me not to go? 1 1Here the component tribhâga (“corner” ) 2 [in the compound netratri- bhäga (“eye-corner”) is suggestive].1. The verse is ascribed by Éârng. 3464 to “Eye-corner” Brahmayasasvin, as though the poet had taken his sobriquet from this verse. In SüktiM. 43.21 the verse is given as anonymous (kasyâpi). One may supply a context in which a husband tells his friend of the difficulty in taking leave of his young bride to go on some journey. 2. The literal meaning of tribhâga is “a third.” A “third of the eye,” as Jacobi notes in his translation of the present passage,- implies the pupil of the eye. But what is precisely meant is the pupil in a position at the comer of the eye, as in a sidelong glance. It is this meaning that gives suggestiveness to the element in the present verse. If so small a fraction of a remembered trait could tell the speaker of his bride’s love, how great must be his pain in separation from her."},{"pageNumber":411,"pageContent":"[ § 3.4b LL The component “corner”: The speaker remembers how she looked at him, despite the presence of their elders, with a sweet glance that contained yearning, grief, and despair. 1 The recollection serves as a stimulant of the grief of separation, caused by a journey, of persons who cannot live without each other.2 This stimulation is made clear by the presence of the word element “corner.”1. The reading of the Kashi edition -garvamantharam makes very lit­tle sense. We have preferred the KM reading (also accepted by Badarinäth Sarmä) -garbhamadhuram, and have so translated. 2. Paraspamhetuka- tvapräna seems to mean that each one is the cause of the sustenance of the other’s life, i.e., if one should die, so would the other.A Where the passage to the suggested meaning is imperceptible, dhvani having the form of a sentence is of two sorts, being either pure, or mixed with a figure of speech. Of these, the pure type is exemplified in the verse from the Rämäbhyudaya “though with feigned anger.” 1 For the sentence taken as a whole shows how the love [of Rama and Sita] for each other has reached full bloom and so reveals the perfect essence of rasa.1. The complete verse is given below by Abhinava. The lost play Rämä­bhyudaya was writen by Yasovarman, the eighth-century king of Kanauj and patron of Väkpatiräja and Bhavabhuti.L H aving th e form of a sentence: the term is expressed in the nominative in order to show that the sentence and the dhvani are .. coextensive.1 For while the suggested meaning appears when phonemes, words, or components are present [as special causes], that meaning appears (over a greater area than theirs] as running throughout the whole verse, for it takes its life from the combination of vibhävas, \\anu- bhâvas, and vyabhicäribhävas]. Thus it is that phonemes, etc., are"},{"pageNumber":412,"pageContent":"397merely subsi iary causes of dhvani where the passage from literal to suggested is imperceptible, but the sentence is not a subsidiary cause, merely helpful like the phonemes, etc., but is engaged in conveying the whole complex of vibhâvas, etc., and so appears as wholly made up of rasa or the like.1 2 Accordingly, where 3.2 K says [that the suggested meanng may] “appear in a sentence,” the word väkye ( “in a sentence” ) is not to be interpreted as a mere locative of cause but rather as a locative [of place] having the sense that this type of dhvani can occur in no other area.T he pure type, that is, unmixed with any figure of speech [is as follows].Although with feigned anger, with tears and with despairing glances, my mother sought to hold you back, you followed me in exile out of love, who now, without you, gaze upon the horizon black with its new clouds: how hard this shows your lover's heart to be, my love, that he still lives!Yasovarman, RämäbhyvdayaHer following him despite his mother’s seeking to hold her back in these various ways shows that she disobeyed the command of a parent out of the depth of her love. The collocation of “your lover” and “my love” expresses the basic emotion (sthäyibhäva) of love where each of the lovers is the very life of the other. “New clouds” shows that Rama is gazing at the clouds of the monsoon season which he has never before endured [in the absence of Sita] and so expresses a stimulant (uddi- panavibhäva) of love-in-separation. In the phrase “still lives” (jivaty eva) the particle “still” ( eva) by its expressing a qualification prevents the appearance of tragedy.3Taken as a whole: the sense is that no one word reveals the rasa more than another. Essence of rasa: the essence, that is, of love-in- separation (vipralambhasrngära).1. If the Vriti had said väkye dhvanih “suggestion occ ring in a sen­tence,” one might take the sentence to be merely a special cause of the sug­gestion, just as “in a word” and “in a component part” were taken in that sense (nimittasaptamï) by Abhinava in the foregoing comment on Kärikä 3.2.2. “Or the like\" refers to rasäbhäsa, bhäva, bhäväbhäsa. 3. If the versepictures Rama and Sita as never to meet again, its effect will be tragedy§ 3.4c L }"},{"pageNumber":413,"pageContent":"398(karuna). If it is felt that they will meet again, its effect will be the sad variety of the erotic (vipralambhasrrigära); see 3.4 a L, note 2. Abhinava here argues that the statement that Rama still lives implies that the lovers will meet again; for otherwise Rama surely would have died. One may of course challenge his interpretation. It is true that Rama will meet Sita again. But Rama, as pictured in this verse, does not know this; only the audience knows. And Abhinava has said (p. 107 = Text p. 79, line 1) that paurvâparyavimaréa is not relevant to the immediate aesthetic impact on the reader. That is why, as he explains, Rävana’s love for Sita is a case of srngâra, not of häsa, although ultimately it becomes häsa as the love is not shared. By analogy a case might well be made for assigning the present verse to tragedy.[ § 3.4c LA The type that is mixed with a figure of speech may be ex­emplified by such a verse as “carried together by the flooding river of passion.” * 1 for in this verse the rasa, [viz., love-in-separation] is strongly manifested and is adorned with metaphor following the rules laid down above [viz., in 2.18] concerning the suggestor.1. The verse, from the Amarusataka. is given in full by Abhinava below.We have seen lovers carried together by the flooding river of passion, who find the flood to be blocked by a dam in the form of their parents.When forced, with desire unfilled, to stand frozen as in a painting, they still drink of each others love through the lily stems of their eyes.Narasimha (SubhÄ. 2057 = Amaru. 104) W ith m etaphor: passion is the flood of a new river, that is, a mon­soon freshet, because it has swollen up suddenly. “Carried together” by this, that is, brought face to face without having so planned it. There­upon their parents (guravah). mother-in-law and the rest, act as dams"},{"pageNumber":414,"pageContent":"399by blocking the flood of their desire. 1 (There is also a pun here, for] the dams are heavy (guravah), that is, impassable. The will [of the lovers] is thereby blocked and so they stand “with desire unfilled.” However, interchanging their persons as they face each other, with limbs as it were painted because devoid of all motion in their bodies, they pass their time in the strategem of mixing slender glances of mutual long­ing, tasting the relish of each other’s longing which is brought to them by the lily stems which are their eyes.Now it may be noticed that the metaphor is not made complete, for the lovers have not been identified with a pair of wild geese or cakraväka birds or the like, for such birds are accustomed to play at drinking water from a single lily stem.2 That is why our author speaks of the rules laid down above. For it was said above “the intention must be keep them [viz., the figures of speech] subordinate and [they] should never be overeustained” (2.18 K). “Adorned”: by the ornamentation of the vibhävas the rasa is also adorned.1. In India it is considered unseemly for young married couples to kiss and fondle one another in the presence of their parents and in-laws. Thus the verse does not imply, as an English reader might at first take it, any opposition on the part of the parents to the relationship between the young people. The obstruction is merely to overt gestures. 2. Sanskrit poetry is full of references to the monogamous affection of shelldrakes (cakraväkas) and wild geese (hamsas). A common picture is of a pair of such birds nibbling at the two ends of a nalini, the long stem of the water lily which descends below the surface of a pond. Now the eyes of the lovers have the shape and dark color of water lily buds. Their mutual glance is likened to a lily stem. They drink rasa just as the birds drink the water contained in the stem. Thus the poet could have completed, or elaborated, his metaphor by likening the lovers to such birds. But he did not.§ 3.5 Introduction A ]A It has been said [in 3.2 K\\ that the variety of suggestive po­etry where the passage from the literal to the suggested meaning is imperceptible may shine forth in texture (sanghatanä). So it is here necessary first to define the nature of texture."},{"pageNumber":415,"pageContent":"[ § 3.5 KK Texture has been said to be of three sorts: lacking in com­pounds, having compounds of medium length, and having long com­pounds.A “Has been said,” that is, by cetain [critics] .1 After simply inding the reader [of this definition] ,2 the following is stated.1. Presumably, then, Kärikä 3.5 is a quotation, but it is not known from whom. The term sanghatand is not used by the early critics, who use racand or riti instead. On the evidence of Abhinava’s comment on 3.6 it appears that Udbhata used the term. He may have been the first to use it and the present Kdrikd is possibly a quotation from him. 2. In other words the definition will be accepted without criticism or discussion.L In T exture: the word sanghatandydm is [an abstract noun] formed [from the verb sangkat- “to put together\"] with an abstract suffix [viz., yuc = ana].

And if they are different, two further views are possible: (2a) that texture depends on the qualities; or (2b) that the qualities depend on texture. Now if we accept the position of unity, or the view that the qualities depend on texture, the meaning of the verse will be that texture, depending on qualities that are its own self, or on quali­ties that reside in it. manifests the rasas. But if we accept the position of difference and within that position the view that texture depends on the qualities, then texture, standing in dependence on the qualities, will be by nature subordinated to the qualities but will not be identical with them.1. By adding “etc.” the Vrtti shows that rasäbhäsa, bhäva. and bhävä- bhäsa are to be included. 2. The long and complicated commentary which follows is motivated by Änanda’s desire to justify his very different view of texture from that of the older poeticians. Bhämaha (2.1-2) implies that the punas of a poem depend on the degrees of word compounding in the texture. Vämana states explicitly (1.2.7-8) that the punas are special properties of the texture (which he calls riti). Udbhata, according to Abhinava and oth­ers (see 3.6 L, note 2), states that the punas are properties of the texture (sanghatanä); and a property both resides in and is dependent on the sub­stance in which it resides. So the older view was that the punas depend on texture. Ànanda shows (in 3.6 a A) that this older view fails to accord with the facts of literature. His own view of puna and texture is radically different. In Änanda’s view the gunas reside in the rasas. The srngârarasa is sweet (has sweetness), the raudrarasa is strong. The punas are not related to the texture in this way. The texture, since its purpose is to manifest nua. may rather be said to depend on the punas. Abhinava points out that “depending on” (àsritya) is here used in a different sense from the sense which it bears in the older view. Änanda does not mean that a given texture resides in a puna; he means that it follows the lead of, is subordinate to, operates for the sake of, a puna. The Vrtti is complicated by its examining other views, notably the gunasaiighatanaikyapaksa or view that texture and punas may be identical (3.6e A). The conclusion of the Vrtti is that on either view, Änanda’s or that of identity, some regulation of the use of the various textures must be given. That rule is furnished by the second half of the present Kärikä: the texture must be appropriate both to the speaker and to the content (rasa or other­wise) of what is said. Thus, Änanda accomplishes his underlying purpose of"},{"pageNumber":417,"pageContent":"402subordinating the old concept of texture (riti or saiighatanä) as well as the old concept of the gunas to his new concept of rasas which must be suggested.

The principle by which it is regulated is that it must be appropriate to the speaker and to what is said.”[Commentary on A:} The Vrttikära shows that the plural inflection of the word rasân is meant to include similar entities: th e rasas, etc. Now in this m atter, i.e., in regard to [what is said in] the first half of the verse, it is possible to imagine, or to explain, these various matters by means of alternatives, which he states: th a t tex tu re and qualities are one, etc. He shows how three possible views can be explained: Now if we accept th e position of unity, etc.T h at are its own self: To show the exact nature of a thing we often use an expression which refers to it as the basis of some entity hypothetically distinguished from it, as when we say that the property of tree-ness belongs to a simsupa. 1 W hich reside in it: According to Bhattodbhata and others the qualities are properties of texture;2 and the generally accepted view is that properties depend on their property-possessor.W ill be sub o rd in ate to th e qualities: in this case the expres­sion “depends on” will not refer to a physical relation of superstratum and substratum (ädhärädheyabhäva).3 For the texture does not reside physically in the qualities. So the sense is similar to what is intended when we say that the estates are based on the king, meaning that the ministers and the like are appropriate to that [kingdom] on which the king is based. Thus we arrive at the sense that texture is by nature subordinate to, is at the mercy of, looks up to, the qualities.1. A simsupa is a tree. But in order to show this point clearly, we hy­pothesize as different from it a property tree-ness, which we then say belongs to the simsupa. So in the case at issue. According to one theory, a given quality, strength, consists in (and so is really one with) the texture of long compounds. But we may bring out its nature with clarity by saying that the texture of long compounds belongs to the quality strength. 2. The view is attributed to Udbhata also by the Ratnaprabhä. which comments on the words of the Pratäparudriya, sanghatanäsrayä gunäh (p. 245, lines 2-3 = Sec­tion 7, lines ö—10) by stating Udbhatamatenoktam eva. Presumably Udbhata"},{"pageNumber":418,"pageContent":"403expressed this view in his lost Bhâmahavivarana. In his only preserved work he has no occasion to speak of gunas or texture, as he is concerned only with figures of speech. 3. Adhärädheyabhäva is the relation that obtains between property and substance, part and whole, etc.§ 3.6a A ]A Now what is the point is raising these various possibilities? It is this. If texture and qualities are one (1), or if the qualities depend on texture (2b), we shall be forced into the untenable position that the qualities, like texture, have no fixed rules of usage. [It is an unten­able position,] because, of the qualities, we know that a high degree of sweetness* (mädhurya) and clarity (prasdda) is limited to the area of tragedy and love-in-separation and that strength (ojas) belongs to fury (vaudra), wonder (adbhuta), and the like. Furthermore, sweetness and clarity are found only in the area of rasa, bhâva, rasâbhâsa, and bhäväbhäsa. Thus the sphere of the qualities is regulated. But this breaks down in the case of texture. Thus we find the texture of long compounds in the area of love as well [as in the area of fury] and un­compounded texture in the area of fury [as well as in love]. Of these [irregularities] an example of the texture of long compounds in love is: mandhära-ktisuma-renu-pinjaritälakä with locks engoldened by the pollen of the flowers of Paradise;or such a verse as:anavamta-nayana-jaia-iava-nipuna-parimusita-patralekham te, etc.Who would not grieve, fair lady, to see your face supported by your open hand as the ever dropping tears rob it of its painted ornament?In similar disagreement, the uncompounded texture is found in exam­ples of fury such as:Whatever man proud of his strong arm.1 Accordingly, the qualities are not one with the textures, nor are they dependent on the textures."},{"pageNumber":419,"pageContent":"[ § 3.6 a AL Like tex tu re: because in the first view, since qualities and texture are held to be one, they will be equivalent in all respects, while in the other view (2b), because the qualities are held to be properties of the texture. Suppose that there are indeed no fixed rules of usage. With this in mind, he says, because, of th e qualities, etc. The word “because” here has the sense of “but.” 1 On the one hand, this does not square with the facts [because the qualities are in fact regulated], while on the other hand, it is forced upon us by logic [if we accept either of these two views]. This: this regulation that has been laid down for the qualities. He now sets forth examples from the literature to prove that such is the case: Thus.By saying “we find,” he has let us know that there are places where this may be observed. This lays the ground for [his furnishing] an example: O f these. Lest some one object that there is no érngâra in this example,2 he gives a second example: or such as. This is the speech of a lover for the purpose of placating his beloved who is angry over a love-quarrel. Accordingly: that is to say, these two views do not fit with the Kärikä.1. See 2.18-19c L, note 4. Abhinava’s interpretation comes to the same result as ours, but is less literal. 2. Érngâra is produced by a combination of vibhävas, anubhâvas, and vyabhicâribhâvas. In the first example, as it is only the fragment of a verse, we are given only the älambhanavtbhäva.A Now if the qualities do not depend on texture, on what do they depend? The answer has already been given [in the Second Chapter]: “Whatever depends on the predominant sense should be regarded as qualities. On the other hand, whatever depends on the non-predominant sense should be considered as ornaments (figures of speech), just like bracelets, etc” [2.6 K).Or we can even let the qualities depend on words [rather than the sense of the words]. They will still not be on a par with alliteration and"},{"pageNumber":420,"pageContent":"405the like. For alliteration and the like axe properties of words regardless of the meaning of the words, whereas qualities are the properties of words capable of expressing a primary sense which gives rise to a certain suggested meaning. These qualities can be called properties of words although they really depend elsewhere, just as heroism and the like are said to depend on the body [as the body is the place where they are manifested].§ 3.6 b L ]L On w hat do th ey depend: what he has in mind is that it has already been remarked on by previous [critics] that if they depend on words and meanings, they would differ in no way from figures of speech. Has already been given: viz., by the author of the Kârikâs.Or: This alternative is possible because it does not follow from the fact that two things depend on [i.e., reside in] the same base that they are identical. If it did, the color [of an object] and its contact [with some other object] would be identical. If you object that the contact requires a second object [and so does not, strictly speaking, rest on the same base as the color1], the same may be said of the point at issue: the quality requires [in addition to its word base] a literal meaning [of that word] that may help it to a suggested sense. But this is not really my [i.e., the Vrttikära's] point of view. I would merely let the qualities be the property of words according to the opinion of those who do 9 0t make clear distinctions, just as they take heroism and the like to be the properties of the body. For the man who does not make clear distinctions is unable to distinguish between primary and metaphorical usage. Still, there will be no fault. This is what I intended by my remark.So he says they can be called properties o f words. The sense of although they really depend elsew here is: although they really belong to the soul.1 21.

I.e., to the rasa in the case of the poetic gunas. to the jïvâtman in the c of heroism, etc."},{"pageNumber":421,"pageContent":"[ § 3.6c AA Now it may be objected that if the qualities depend on words, it will follow that they are identical with texture, or that they depend on texture. For words that are untextured (asanghatita, i.e., not struc­tured into a sentence) cannot be the basis of the qualities, because such words cannot express qualities, which depend on rasa and the like, since rasa and the like are conveyed by specific meanings [viz., the vibhävas, etc., not by the general meanings that belong to words taken individually).But this objection does not hold, because it has been shown that rasa and the like can be suggested through phonemes and words. Or, if we admit that sentences suggest rasa and the like, we need not admit that these sentences depend by rule on any particular texture. One may thus say that the base of the qualities consists only of words, words that are untextured [i.e., free to belong to any one of the three textures] so long as they are accompanied by some particular suggestive meaning.L D epend on words: if, metaphorically speaking, the qualities reside in words, the conclusion will be as follows. The quality sweetness (madhurya) is the capacity of words to convey a literal sense which [in its turn] suggests such rasas as love; and that capacity of words can be attained only by a specific texture. It follows that the texture is nothing separate (from the words). Rather, it is textured words to which this capacity belongs. This amounts to saying that this capacity [to express the rasa of love, etc.) depends on texture. Such would be the conclusion.But let the gunas be properties of the words, or even identical with the words. What need is there to bring in texture? Anticipating this response, the objector continues: For w ords th a t are u n textured cannot, etc. The rasas, bhävas, and the false varieties and cessations of rasa and bhäva are suggested when they are conveyed by specific meanings [i.e., the vibhävas, etc.], not by the general senses of individual words1 unconnected with one another. Even metaphorically speaking, untextured words cannot be the basis of qualities dependent on, or"},{"pageNumber":422,"pageContent":"407strictly speaking residing in, these rasas and the like. The reason for this is because such words cannot express, etc. For untextured words cannot express a literal meaning which is syntactically complete and therefore useful to the production of a suggested meaning. This is the sense.He now refutes [the foregoing objection): B ut this objection does not hold. For just as it has been said that a phoneme can suggest a rasa, just so can a word, without expressing any meaning, suggest sweetness, which becomes the manifestor of a rasa, by the beauty that results from the mere hearing of it, as in the case of the phoneme. What need is there for texture? And just as it has been said that dhvani may be manifested by words, just so may a separate [unstructured) word, by its reminding us of its [general] sense, reveal a meaning capable of suggesting rasa. And this (meaning] in itself is sweetness. Here again what use is there .of texture?Now it may be objected that at least in that variety of dhvani which is manifested by the sentence it will be necessary to introduce texture, for without it how could the sentence or how could its literal meaning have any beauty? With this objection in mind, he says: O r, if we adm it. The word “or” is used in the sense of “also” and should be construed with the word vâkyavyangyatve.2 This is as much as to say: bring in texture; we make no objection to its presence. But a specific texture is not the base of, nor one with, sweetness, for sweetness and the like exist without it wherever rasa and the like are suggested by phonemes and single words. It follows that where rasa and the like are suggested by a sentence, it is the sentence, independently of any given texture, that suggests rasa and that the texture, although present, is needless for suggesting rasa. Hence, even if we speak metaphorically, the qualities depend only on words, (not on texture). He states this conclusion by saying, only of w ords, etc. 1§ 3.6 c L]1. The objector is following the Munämsä theory that the individual word denotes a general or class character. See 1.4 b L, note 2. 2. I.e., themeaning intended is abhyupagate vâkyavyangyatve ’pi: \"if it is also admitted that rasa and the like can be suggested by sentences."},{"pageNumber":423,"pageContent":"[ § 3.6 d AA Objection: “We can understand that this might be the case as far as sweetness is concerned, but we cannot understand that strength does not depend on words as set in a particular texture. Because a texture without compounds could never serve as the basis of strength.” This objection too we are not unwilling to answer, if your mind is not spoiled by habitual acceptance of what is commonly believed. Why should a texture without compounds not be a basis for strength? Af­ter all, it has already been shown [2.9 L] that strength is just another name for the excitement of a poem conveying the rasa of fury and the like. What fault is there if strength is expressed in a texture with­out compounds and sensitive readers find no lack of beauty therein? Accordingly, there is nothing wrong with saying that qualities depend upon words that are not regulated by any particular texture. But these [qualities) will not stray from their own field any more than will the eye, etc., relate to a sense object which is not their own [e.g., the eye will not hear sounds). Therefore the qualities are one thing and texture is another. Nor are the qualities dependent on texture. This is one view.L O bjection: some [commentators] say that this objection is concerned only with dhvani suggested by sentences. But we would say that in strength, which is the special character of the rasas fury and the like, even when this strength is suggested by a phoneme or a word, its special beauty does not really blossom in the individual phonemes and words until they are given the mark of texture. And so we would take the objection as a general one. Conveying: the present participle (by Pan. 3.2.126) expresses characteristic or cause. Here the sense is that strength is characterized by the conveying of fury and the like. 1 A nd [sensitive readers): the word “and” has the sense of “for.” What he means is that since there is no lack of beauty in “Whatever man proud of his strong arm” [see 2.9 A and 3.6 a A], it therefore follows, etc. By these: these qualities. T heir own: the field [of love] has been restricted [to sweetness] by the statement: “it is just srngâra that is the sweetest and most delightful flavor” [2.7 K)."},{"pageNumber":424,"pageContent":"4091. Abhinava does not express his meaning clearly. Prakäsayatah actually agrees with kävyasya, not with ojas. But presumably he identifies the two: the strength of a poem which conveys rasa is a strength which conveys rasa. His meaning is that from the conveying of fury, etc., we can infer the strength of the poem. This is on the analogy of the stock example of Pan. 3.2.126: sayänä bhunjate yavanâh “the Greeks eat lying down.” From the knowledge that someone eats lying down we can infer that he is a Greek.§ 3 .6e A ]A Or let .us consider [another view, namely] that the qualities are one with texture. But it was said earlier that [if they are one,] the qualities, like texture, would have no fixed rules of usage, for in lit­erature we find irregularities [in the corrrelation of texture and rasa]. The reply to this is that when in literature we find an irregularity in a sphere that we have circumscribed, we should regard it as an aber­ration (virûpa). If you ask how it is that sensitive readers nonetheless find beauty in such instances, our reply is: because the aberration is concealed by the poet’s skill (sakti). For a poetic fault is of two kinds: it may be due to the poet’s lack of mature judgment (avyutpatti) or it may be due to his lack of skill. A fault that is due to lack of mature judgment may be concealed by the poet’s skill and so never be noticed. But a fault that is due to the poet’s lack of skill will appear immedi­ately. The following sloka will give support to our position: “If a poet commits a fault out of lack of mature judgment, it may be concealed by his skill. But if the fault is due to lack of ski , it will immediately appear.”And so it is that the impropriety of a great poet, such as his well- known writing of the sexual enjoyment of the highest gods, does not appear as vulgarity because it is concealed by his skill. An exam­ple is the description of [Siva’s] enjoyment of PärvatT in the Kumära- sambhava.1 That the charge of impropriety cannot be cancelled in such cases2 has been shown in what follows [3.10-14 b A). But it will appear in conclusion by positive and negative examples that this fault can be concealed by poetic skill. That is why, if a poet devoid of this skill were to describe this type of love in the area of such actors, his work would"},{"pageNumber":425,"pageContent":"410clearly appear faulty. But if we adopt this view (that texture and qual­ities are one], what lack of beauty can we find in such such a stanza as “Whatever man proud of his strong arm\"? The answer is that we may hypothesize a lack of beauty which is not perceived because it is concealed by skill.31. The reference is to the Eighth Canto, of which there is no good rea­son to doubt Kalidasa's authorship. While the general meaning is clear, the exact wording and interpretation of Änanda’s text are in doubt. In the BP text, which we have adopted, it would also be possible to break the com­pound as uttama-devatd-avisaya; “(sexual enjoyment,) which is an improper area in dealing with the highest gods.\" Compare Abhinava’s analogy ntr- vyäjapardkmmasya purusasydvisaye 'pi. Furthermore, Dr. Krishnamoorthy has reported from his Moodabidre MS the reading uttamadevatdvisayaprati- siddhasambhogasrngdTa: “such as his writing of sexual enjoyment, which is forbidden in the case of the highest gods.” 2. aucityatydgas (MB MS, Krishnamoorthy) gives better sense than aucityatydgas (Kashi ed.). 3. Thequoted stanza fails to use long compounds to express the raso of fury. Ac­cordingly, since the quality stregnth (which by tradition is to be expressed by long compounds) belongs to fury, if quality and texture are the same, the stanza breaks the rules. I have long puzzled over this passage before deciding to adopt the interpretation suggested by the punctuation of the Kashi text and the specific direction of BP, which states that nanu him acdrutvam is an objection, to which apratfyamdnam evdropaydmah is the answer. By so interpreting we are forced to recognize the gunasanghatanaikya theory as an alternative acceptable to Änanda. My chief reason for accepting such a conclusion is that Änanda uses the hypothesis of “fault hidden by skill” in 3.10-14 b A as though he approved of it. The reader will do well, however, to consider carefully a very different interpretation proposed by Badarinâth éar­ma in his Sanskrit commentary, p. 272. The whole gunasaiighatanaikyapaksa, he says, is wrong and is not accepted by Änanda. He interprets the present passage as follows. “But if we adopt this view (that texture and the qualiti are one], will we [be willing to] superimpose on such a stanza as “What­ever man proud of his right arm” some wholly unperceived lack of beauty?” He goes on to say, “To hypothesize wilfully a lack of beauty in this stanza, when this lack is not perceived even by connoisseurs, is grossly unreasonable (mahïyasy anupapattih). Accordingly, this view [of the identity of quality and texture] is wrong.\"[ § 3 .6 e AL O r [let us], etc. What he has in mind is that the power of words to manifest rasa consists in their being textured in some partic­ular fashion.

M atu re judgm ent (vyutpatti) is skill in the careful weighing (pürväparaparämarsa) of all that may be helpful to such [presentation]. His lack of skill: that is, the poet’s. Im pro­priety: the most important point in [producing] rasa is to avoid any disturbance of delight to those who are relishing it, because rasa is wholly tied to this relishing. Now treating the sexual enjoyment of the highest gods is like treating that of our parents. Shame and horror will leave us no room for delight. This is his meaning. Because it is concealed by his skill: for even sexual enjoyment is there so de­scribed by the imaginative poet that our heart fixes on the description itself without any careful weighing of the context, just as when a man of unimpeachable valor is engaged in a battle, even if it be in a wrong cause, we give him our bravos at that moment, but not later when we weigh the matter carefully. Such is our author’s meaning. 1 Has been shown: he uses the past tense because the passage is by the author of the Kârikas,2 for it will be stated that ‘‘for the spoiling of rasa there is no cause other than impropriety” [3.10-14 a A]. Is n ot perceived: that is, not even by those well-trained, who weigh matters carefully.§ 3 .6e L )1. We are not convinced of the justice of this interpretation, however artistically Abhinava has phrased it. Änanda says nothing about subsequent compunction. He says only that the impropriety is tiraskrta, concealed, or 'more literally, set aside, by the poet’s skill. Nor do we find that those who have once loved the Eighth Canto of the Kumârasambhava ever reverse their opinion of its beauty. Those critics who are shocked by its impropriety were doubtless shocked at their first reading. 2. This is an extraordinary state­ment, for the quoted passage is not a Kärikä. Nowhere else does Abhinava ascribe one of the sangraha-slokas, or the parikara- or sanksepa-slokas, to the Kärikäkära. If one is to distinguish the Kärikäkära from the Vrttikâra, the sloka here indicated (3.10-14 a A) must be ascribed either to the Vrttikâra or to some extraneous author. If the iloka in question were a kärikä, the Vrttikâra would have commented on it. I can only suppose that Abhinava’s eagerness to justify the past tense of darsitam has led him into confusion."},{"pageNumber":427,"pageContent":"[ § 3.6 f AA So, whether we suppose that texture and qualities are one or that they are different, we shall need some other determinant1 of the correct use of texture. Accordingly, the Kärikä goes on to say: “The principle by which it is regulated is that it must be appropriate to the speaker and to what is to be said (väcya).”1. Other than the rule which says that heavily compounded texture, as identical with strength, is productive of the rosa of fury.L O r th a t th ey are different: if the two are different, there will be no principle for regulating the texture, while if they are one, the rasas cannot furnish the regulation.1 So some othher principle must be given.T he principle by which it is regulated, etc.: this forms the remaining portion of the Kärikä [3.6].1.

The hero of the story may be brave and noble (dhïrodâtta), or may belong to one of the other categories of heroes. Then too there are primary and secondary [heroes]. All these distinctions are possible. What is to be said (väcya) may be subsidiary to true rasa, which is the soul of dhvani, or it may be subsidiary to false or unconventional rasa (rasäbhäsa).

It is perfectly cleax that Änanda is here using naso in its old sense of a particularly vivid emotion (bhäva), especially of love, not in the new sense established by Abhinava, of aesthetic delight. See Introduction, pp. 18-19.§ 3.6 g L]L The hero of the story, called the näyaka (leader) because he leads the story in the sense of subordinating it to his own activity, is he who enjoys the reward at the conclusion. B rave and noble, etc.: a brave and noble hero is most notably heroic in justice and righteous war; a brave and arrogant hero (dhïroddhata) is notable for herosim and fury; a brave and amorous hero (dhvralalita) is noted for heroism and love; a brave and spiritually calm hero (dhiraprasänta) is noted for heroic generosity and justice and for his spiritual calm. These four types of hero are for the most part represented by the sâtvatï, âmbhatï, kaisikî, and bhâratî modes of gesture and speech (vrtti)1 respectively. P rim ary refers to the main hero, secondary to the secondary hero. D istinctions: differences of speaker.W h at is to be said (väcya): here “subsidiary to true rosa” means being a manifestor of this rasa which is the soul, that is, the very na­ture, of dhvani. [As väcya has also the more techncial sense of “primary meaning,” Abhinava now seeks to justify Ananda’s statement if the word is taken in that sense.] A primary sense (väcya) of dramatically representable meaning (abhineyärtha) is one where meaning in its sug­gested form, that is, the very nature of dhvani, can be brought (neya) into (äbhimukhyam) almost direct representation through speech, ges­ture, inner symptoms,2 and costume. This is what is called [by Bharata] the goal of poetry (kävyärtha). It alone is susceptible of enactment. As the sage [Bharata] has said in several places in such words as, “The bhävas produce (bhâvayanti) the goals (or meanings) of poetry (kävyärtha) with their accompaniment of speech, gesture, and inner symptoms.” 3 But as the primary sense (väcyo ’rthah) in the form of the vibhävas, etc., is acted out in the course of enacting the rusas, it is quite proper to speak of the primary sense (väcya) as having a [fur­ther, suggested] sense that is dramatically representable (abhineyär­tha).* We should not speak here of vyapadesivadbhäva as others have done.5 O thers: that is, it may be concerned with middle class or lower class characters.1.

But"},{"pageNumber":429,"pageContent":"414the first three associations are natural enough. The sdtvati is the heroic mode par excellence, the ârabhatï is the mode of violence, and the kaiéikï the graceful, delicate mode. The bhdratï is more difficult to characterize and is usually limited to speech, not gesture. For the history of the modes in criticism see V. Raghavan, JOR 6.346-370 and 7.34-52, 91-112. In what fol­lows Kärikä 3.33 will refer briefly to the modes. Vrtti in this sense is to be distinguished from vrtti as a type of alliteration (see 1.1 a A, note 4) 2.

Abhinava’s point is that it is only the suggested meaning, the rasas and the like, that are really abhineya (to be dramatically represented). But it is justifiable to speak of the primary, lit­eral sense as abhineya because it forms an ever-associated part of the process. 5. For vyapadesivadbhdva, see Paribhàsenduéekhara 30. It is a grammatical technique by which one treats a linguistic element that lacks some particular mark as if it were an element which bears that mark. The following is a non- linguistic example. The demon Rähu consists only of a head, but we speak of rahoh siras \"the head of Rähu,” placing rahoh in the genitive case as if Rähu, like other beings, possessed a head. In the case at issue, some commen­tators) previous to Abhinava interpreted vdcyam in vàcyam abhineyârtham by this principle. The vdcyam (primary meaning), they must have said, is nothing other than the abhineydrthah (the dramatically representable mean­ing). But in the grammatical analysis yasya artho 'bhineyas tad vdcyam it appears in the genitive, as if distinct. Abhinava solves the difficulty by saying that the dramatically representable meaning is not the literal meaning but the suggested meaning to which the literal meaning leads.[ § 3.6 g LA Among these cases, when the poet as speaker is devoid of rasa and bhdva, the type of structure (racanâ) is optional. The same holds when the speaker is a character invented by the poet and is without rasa and bhdva. But when the speaker, either the poet himself or a character invented by him, is possessed of rasa and bhdva, and when the rasa, from its being the predominant element, forms the soul of dhvani, then, by necessity,1 only the uncompounded texture or the texture employing compounds of medium length can be used. But in the rasas of tragedy and love-in-separation (the restriction is greater and] only"},{"pageNumber":430,"pageContent":"415the uncompounded texture [is allowed]. Why is this? Our answer is, that when a rasa is set forth as primarily important, one should do one’s very best to avoid anything that interferes with or opposes the perception of it. As compounds can be interpreted in many ways, a texture of long compounds sometimes interferes with our perception of the rasa. Accordingly, in passages of rasa, the frequent use of this texture spoils the effect, especially in drama and, in other forms of literature, especially when the rasa is tragedy or love-in-separation, for these are very delicate rasas where the slightest lack of clarity delays our understanding of the words and meaning. On the other hand, when other rasas are being presented, such as fury, a texture of medium length compounds and sometimes, in order to describe the action of a hero who is brave and arrogant, even a texture of long compounds, may not be at fault and need not be entirely avoided, in view of the needs of a literal meaning that becomes appropriate to the rasa only by recourse to' this texture.21. See note 1 on Abhinava’s commentary below. 2. Âksepa: literally, a drawing toward oneself, or introducing into one’s work. Badarinâth Sarmâ explains the implication of its use here by the gloss, äksepo ’nupapattimülako 'dhyähärah, ‘the supplying of an element because failure would otherwise ensue.” Note how Ànanda justifies the use of texture here. It is “appropriate to the v&cya, because it enables the väcya to be appropriate to the rasa.§ 3.6 h L ]L Having thus listed the varieties of speaker and the varieties of what is to be said (or primary sense), he now states the appropriateness to each of these which regulates [the texture]: Am ong these cases.O f stru ctu re: that is, of texture.

Although the poet when he speaks should be filled with rasa, for otherwise the poem will be tasteless, as our author will state in the passage “If he himself becomes dispassionate,” etc. [3.41- 42 a A], still, when he gives his chief attention to exhibiting skill in complicated figures such as yamakas, he is said to be devoid of rasa.

This being the logical structure, one cannot complain of tautology in the use of the word niyama (restriction) and two restrictive particles eva [in one sentence] . 1W hy is this: his attitude is, is this a pronouncement of some legal text? O ur answ er is: i.e., a reasonable explanation is. (Whatever interferes with] th e perception of it: whatever interferes with the relishing of the rasa, that is, whatever is an obstacle to the relishing or opposes it by containing some contradictory relish. C an be in ter­preted: the compounds can be interpreted [by the reader] in many ways; but the texture is [also] a causal agent in this interpretation. Hence there are two causal suffixes in sambhävanä.2 Especially in dram a: to begin with, one cannot act out the meaning of a compound without breaking up the suggested sense. The shifts of intonation and the like and the antara and prasäda songs3 are difficult to perform in this case. Furthermore, in this case [i.e., in the use of long compounds] the understanding [of the audience] is subject to constant doubts, which is improper in a play, because in a play the understanding should be direct and immediate. A nd in o th er form s of literatu re: in non- dramatic forms.D elays o ur understanding: the sense is that our relishing of the rasa is hindered by the obstacles presented to it. [May not be at fault;] The reason why a texture of long compounds may cease to constitute a fault is that it may be needed by a literal meaning which has been chosen in order to suggest a rasa, which is appropriate to the rasa, but which is incapable of suggesting the rasa without the texture of long compounds. The explanation that has been given [by a previous commentator] of tadäksepa as “[only] by drawing in the action of this hero” [instead of “by recourse to this texture”] does not fit well; so enough of that.[ § 3.6 h L1. The problem is to explain the apparent presence of three expressions of restriction in the single sentence yadâ tu kavih ... sanghatane. Abbinava does so by explaining that three different variables are restricted, three areas are excluded. This explanation plays havoc with the word order; niyamenai- va must go together. 2. Abhinava here avails himself of a grammatical fiction based on Pan. 6.4.51 ner aniti. By this rule the causative suffix nie"},{"pageNumber":432,"pageContent":"417(= i > e > ay) drops before any further suffix that is anit. As nie itself is anit, a causative suffix will drop before a second causative suffix and a double causative will be phonetically the same as a simple causative. Thus “Caitra causes Maitra to cause the boy to eat rice” becomes caitro maitrena bälam odanam bhojayati (= bhuj + [nie] + nie + sap + ft). In the case at issue Abhi- nava is interpreting samäsänäm anekaprakärasambhävanä as “the causing by the texture of the reader to cause [i.e., bring about] a manifold analysis of compounds. 3. For antaragäna and pmsädagäna, see ABh. on BhNÉ 6.29.§ 3 .6 i L]A The quality called “clarity” is required throughout all types of texture, for it has already been said that it is “common to all the rasas and common to all the textures.” 1 If one swerves from clarity, even1 a texture without compounds will not suggest tragedy or love- in-separation. If one holds to it, even a texture of medium length compounds will not fail to reveal them. So clarity is always to be sought. Accordingly, if you feel that the quality strength is missing in the verse “Whatever man proud of his strong arms,” [we would point out that at least] it has the quality called clarity and it does not have sweetness.2- Furthermore, it does not lack beauty since it reveals the rasa which its author intended. So whether texture is one with qualities or'whether it is different, the sphere of [the various types of] texture is regulated by the proprieties set forth above. In this way texture too is a suggestor of rasa. And the above mentioned principle of the regulation of texture as a cause of the manifestation of rasa [namely appropriateness to speaker and content] is precisely what regulates the qualities. So there is no contradiction in saying that the distribution (vyavasthäna) 3 of texture is dependent upon the qualities.1. Änanda is quoting his own remark from 2.10 A, substituting the syn­onym sahghatanâ for racanä. 2. Änanda’s point is that strength may not be required for ratidra rasa. The quality of clarity without sweetness may suffice. 3. Vyavasthäna implies the assignment of one type of texture to one type of speaker or content and of another type to another.L T hroughout: this is as much as to say that every type of tex­ture is to be so constructed that there shall be immediate perception of"},{"pageNumber":433,"pageContent":"418the primary sense. H as already been said: viz., under Kärikä 2.10: “A poem’s ability to communicate,” etc. W ill not suggest: he means, because the suggestor will not transmit its own literal sense. To it: if one holds to clarity. As the matter [of clarity] is so important to our author, he explicitly gives a positive as well as a negative state­ment. It does n o t have sweetness: he implies that as strength and sweetness have already been described as mutually contradictory, 1 a combination of the two is quite unheard of. Intended: the sense is that the raso has been revealed simply by clarity; it is wrong to say it has not been revealed. So: The meaning of the whole passage [3.6—3.6 i] may be stated as follows. If the qualities are one with texture, the regulation of the texture will be identical with the regulation of the qualities. In the view that texture depends on the qualities, we reach the same conclusion. Even if the qualities depend on texture, the very appropriateness to speaker and content which have been described as regulating, as being sources of, the texture, will likewise be sources for the regulation of the qualities. Thus there is no serious fault in any of the three views.21. See 2.9 L, last paragraph. 2. This may be true, but Änanda never specifically defends the third view.[ § 3.6 i LK Also another sort of appropriateness, namely to the [particu­lar] visaya (genre) [in which one is writing], regulates the texture, for texture differs as it is found to occur in different varieties of literature.A In addition to what is appropriate to speaker and content, that which is appropriate to the visaya (genre) also regulates the texture. For the varieties of literature are many, such as the muktaka (indepen­dent stanza), which is written in Sanskrit, Prakrit, or Apabhramsa; the sandänitaka (couplet), visesaka (triplet), kaläpaka (quatrain), and kulaka (connected group of more than four stanzas); the paryayabandha (poem on a fixed subject); parikathâ (round of stories); khandakathä"},{"pageNumber":434,"pageContent":"419(short story) and sakalakathâ (complete story); the poem in cantos (i.e., the Sanskrit mahäkävya); the play; the âkhyâyikâ and kathä (two types of tale); and others. Texture assumes a particular form as it occurs in one or another of these.§ 3.7 L]L He shows that there is another principle of regulation: to th e visaya. The word visaya means a particular aggregate (sanghâ- ta). And just as a man who enters a social aggregate such as the army, even if he should be individually a coward, adapts himself to the character appropriate to an army, just so a poetic sentence introduced into a particular aggregate such as a couplet, must become appropriate thereto. If the muktaka (independent stanza) has been listed under the word visaya, this is only in order to show that because of the absence of any aggregation of poetic units in the muktaka, it is entirely free (of regulation by aggregate] and rests on itself like the ether [of the Upanishads] .1By the word also he as much as says: when there also exists a need to be appropriate to speaker and content, the need to be appropriate to the visaya extends only to differences of degree; the need to be appropriate to speaker and content is never set aside by the need of the visaya.T he mufitaka: the term is formed from mukta, “freed,” not bound to anything else, plus, the suffix kan used in forming a conventional term (sanjnâ).2 Because of (the conventional associations of] this [term], a verse occurring independently in a cohesive form of literature, even if that verse is in no need of syntactical completion, is not called a muktaka. The adjectival phrase “written in Sanskrit, [Prakrit, or Apa- bhramsa]” qualifies muktaka only.3 He names the languages in this or­der because they originated in this order. In a sandänitaka the syntax is completed in two verses, in a viéesaka in three, in a kaläpaka in four, in a kulaka in five or more. These varieties are expressed in a copulative compound because they all possess the property of being distinguished by the length of their sentences. Paryäyabandha is a description of springtime, etc. Although the sentences (i.e.v stanzas) which it contains are complete in themselves (and so make up a plural­ity, so to speak] it goes under the title of the single object which is to be described.4 A parikathä concerns one or another of the four goals of man, such as dharma, which it exhibits variously with a wealth of incident- and description.5 A khandakathä contains only a portion [of"},{"pageNumber":435,"pageContent":"420the above]. A sakalakathä follows all the plots to their conclusion. These two types have been named together in a copulative compound because they are both commonly found in Prakrit. In the previous types, from the muktaka on, there is no limitation of language. T he poem com posed in cantos (sargabandha) is the mahäkävya, treating all the aims of man and describing everything.6 It is written in Sanskrit only.7 T he play consists of the ten types together with such syb-types as the nätikä, trotaka, räsaka, prakaranikä, etc., and is written in a mixture of languages. The äkhyäyikä is a tale divided into chapters called ucchvàsa, etc., and contains occasional verses in vaktra, apavak- tra, and other meters. The kathä lacks these two characteristics. The two are expressed in a copulative compound because they are both written in prose. A nd others: this will include the campû. Dandin says: “the campû is written in a mixture of prose and verse.” (1.31).1. Abhinava's interpretation of visaya as sanghäta gives him an oppor­tunity for the fine simile of the man in the army, but it falsifies Änanda’s view. Visaya (area, sphere, genre) simply does not mean sanghäta (aggre­gation). Änanda means, for example, that one type of texture (relative lack of compounds) is appropriate in the sphere of plays, another type of texture (relatively long compounds) is appropriate in the sphere of the äkhyäyikä and kathä. This is borne out by the majority of extant examples of these genres. Compare, for example, the texture of the Ratnävalx with that of the Dasa- kumäracarita or the Kädambari The reason that a sentence of the Kädambari may be textured in long compounds is not that it must fit with other sentences of the Kädambari; this would be circular reasoning. It is permitted to be so textured because it is in the sphere (genre) of the kathä. Abhinava’s difficulty in explaining how the muktaka, an independent verse that has no fellows, can be brought under the word visaya is a difficulty of his own making. 2. See Pan. 5.3.87. It is important from Abhinava’s view to derive the word thus, rather than from mxikta + svärthe kah. A sanjnä always denotes something more specific than the mere etymology of the word would warrant. Thus, krostr as a common agent noun means “a howler” ; but as a sanjnä the same word means only a jackal. So in the case at issue. As a common noun mukta­ka would mean a free entity or a small, free entity. As a sanjnä, according to Abhinava, it means, more specifically, a verse that is free not only by the_ fact that its syntax is not bound to its neighbors, but by the fact that it is not inserted into some other genre of literature. Krishnamoorthy translates muktaka as “a pearl,” as if derived from muktä, but one cannot justify such an etymology by Panini. 3. Something is wrong here. Either the word eva must be rejected, or a sentence of explanation must be supplied; because Abhinava says below that the types from muktaka onward (presumably on[ § 3.7 L"},{"pageNumber":436,"pageContent":"421through parikathä) are all unregulated in respect to language. BP supplies the needed explanation: “the adjective compound applies [strictly] only to muktaka because the termination of the compound is singular. But we are to draw it down to sandänitaka, etc., and supply the necessary conversion to plural.\" 4. This definition would fit many of the satakas preserved in San­skrit. 5. Bhoja’s example of a parikathä, the Éùdrakakathâ, seems to have taken käma for its subject, on which it gathered a number of stories around (pori) King âüdraka. It was written in Prakrit, whereas Abhinava seems to imply that such works should be in Sanskrit. On the type see V. Raghavan, Bhoja’s ÉP, pp. 591-593, 604, 805-806. In the same book he also gives such information as is available, unfortunately very little, on the next two gen­res. 6. “Everything\" is an exaggeration. What is meant is the long list of subjects demanded by the ancient critics, e.g., Dandin 1.16-17. 7. Prakritpoems of the same type were called skandhakabandha (Dandin) or äsväsa- bandha (Bhoja).§ 3.7a A ]A Among these [different genres], the principle that applies in muktakas is that when the poet seeks rasa formation, the texture should be appropriate to that [raso]. This has already been shown [cf. 3.6 h A]. 'When [his intention] is othewise, [the texture is] optional. There are examples of a poet’s seeking rasa formation in the genre of mukta- kas, just as he might seek it in a long poem. It is well known that a single muktaka of the poet Amaru, for example, may flow with a flavor of love (srngârarasa) equal to that of a whole volume. But in the sandänitaka and the other [syntactically connected verse sequences] a texture of medium length or of long compounds is in order, because of their appropriateness to the wider area of composition. Where these sequences occur, however, in long poems, the texture should follow whatever is appropriate to the given longer poem.But in the paryâyabandha (as opposed to the sandänitaka, etc.,] the texture is non-compounded or of medium length compounds. Even if on occasion one may use long compounds because of their appropriateness to the subject matter, one should avoid both the harsh and the vulgar types of alliteration. 1 In the parikathä the texture is optional, for its concern is solely with the telling of stories and there is therefore no"},{"pageNumber":437,"pageContent":"422particular intention to create rasa. The khandakathâ and sakalakathä are commonly found in Prakrit. As they contain many kulakas and other [syntactically connected verse sequences], there is no objection to their having long compounds. The choice of alliteration2 should accord with the rasa.In the Sanskrit mahäkävya when its overall purpose is rasa, the tex­ture should be appropriate to the rasa-, otherwise, the texture is op­tional. For we see that the authors of mahäkävyas have traveled on both roads. Rasa is the better purpose to have in view.In plays, as opposed to the foregoing genres, one should always seek rasa formation.1. Harsh and vulgar vrttis have reference to types of alliteration that are too obvious, the first by its piling up of harsh phonemes and conjuncts, the second by its exclusion of all conjuncts and its overuse of soft phonemes; see1.1 a A, note 4 and 1.1 a L, note 4. Vrtti is here used in the sense employed in 1.1 a A, to be distinguished from that of 3.6g L. 2. The compound vrtty- aucitya is evidently of different formation from the compounds prabandhaucit- ya and arthaucitya used a few lines above and from the terms vaktrväcyavcitya and uisayaucitya used by Abbinava in 3.7 L. The present compound means the appropriateness of the alliterative style, whereas those other compounds were elliptical, e.g., prabandhaucitya = prabandhagataucitya or prabandhäsri- taucitya, “the appropriateness to the type of work.” Änanda uses the term again 3.16 f A, 3.19 K, and 3.18-19 c A.[ § 3.7a AL W hen otherw ise: sc., when he does not seek rasa formation.Now it may be asked, how can there be a combination of vibhävas, anubhâvas, and vyabhicârins, by which a rasa could be attained, in [so short a space as] a muktakal With this in mind, he says: “there are examples [in the genre] of m uktakas.” In the following stanza of Amaru there is a clear perception of the vibhävas and the rest in all their perfection.She had suffered in his absence and finally agreed to take her lover back; and then he called her carelessly by another woman’s name.She pretended not to hear, but glanced aside in terror that her unforgiving friend had heard; then seeing that her friend had left the room, she ceased to care.[Amaru. 75]"},{"pageNumber":438,"pageContent":"423T he w ider area: What he means is that if a texture without com­pounds is used [in such long sentences], our understanding is delayed, being held in suspension and forced to travel the long road to the verb, so that by the time it has apprehended the literal meaning it is already weary and not in a position to relish the [suggested] rasa} O ccur in long poem s: That is, when any of the verse sequences from the sandänitaka to the kulaka so occur.. Or we may take the view that the muktaka may occur in a longer genre as well [as in a collection of mutakas], for a muktaka can be any stanza the relishing of the rasa of which is independent of what precedes and follows, as the stanza “When I would paint you as you stood after we had quarreled.”2 On occasion: viz., in the area of fury and the like. No p articu lar inten­tion: The logical connection is: the texture is optional because there is no particular intention to create rasa.T he choice of alliteratio n : the harsh, gentlemanly (upanagari- ka) and vulgar types of alliteration should be appropriate to the type of work and to the rasa. O therw ise: When its purpose lies only in the narrrative, the type of alliteration also is optional. On both roads: the word is locative. A mahdkavya like the Kädambarikathäsära of Bhatta Jay ant aka3 is concerned only with narrative, while poems like the Raghuvamsa are concerned with rasa. Others have explained “both roads” as referring to Sanskrit and Prakrit. But this would be an unpardonable obscurity,4 for to what then would our. author be referring when he says that of these “rasa is the better purpose to have in view?” 11. One must bear in mind that in rasadhvani the rasa unfolds imme­diately from the poem. Where there is a delay in the perception, as in laksitakramavyaiigya. we are dealing with a different type of poetry. Now this immediate, unitary perception can be achieved without compounds in short sentences, for they follow the natural syntax of everyday speech. But in a sentence extending over several verses the suspensions become difficult. We must hold the sense of three or four words in our mind before we come to the verb that gives them meaning. Even after we come to the verb, there may be a delay while the mind fits the puzzle together. In such sentences the compre­hension is aided in Sanskrit by compounds, just as it is aided in Greek and Latin by the conventions of classical syntax (subjunctive, optative, infinitive clauses), which Sanskrit lacks. 2. This is Meghadvta 110 (2.42). Abhinava calls it a muktaka because it can be taken out of the Meghadüta with no harm to the rasa of the verse, which could apply to any lover separated from his love.

Our text reads bhattajayantakasya, but the reading is in ques­tion and the fact is that the Kädambarikathäsära was written by Abhinanda, the son of Jayantabhatta. Conceivably the ka of jayantakasya is a diminutive or pejorative. But V. Raghavan (Bhoja’s ÉP, p. 592, n. 2) reports that India Office MS 1135 (of the Locano) here reads bhattajayantasutasyäbhinandasya krte kädambarikathäsäre. 4. For the fault of neyärtha see Bhämaha 1.38 and Vämana 2.1.12.[ § 3.7a LA As the äkhyayikä and kathä consist chiefly of prose and as the methods of prose composition differ from those of verse, the basis of the regulation [of the texture] in prose, which has not been touched on before, is here set forth briefly.K The aforesaid propriety governs texture everywhere, even i prose, although it lacks the regulations of meter.A The regulation already given of texture, that it must be ap­propriate to the speaker and content with due consideration given to genre, is the source of regulation in prose, even though prose lacks the regulation of meter. Thus, there too, when the poet or the character invented by the poet is devoid of raso and bhäva, [the type of texture is] optional; but when the speaker is possessed of rasa or bhäva, one must follow the aforesaid regulation. Even here [sc., in prose], appropriate­ness to genre [is to be observed]. The äkhyayikä is distinguished by a predominance of medium length or long compounds because the beauty (chäya) of prose depends on its long sentences and they are carried to the greatest extent in the äkhyäyikä. In the kathä, although it con­tains many long sentences of prose, one should observe the proprieties relating to rasa which we have given."},{"pageNumber":440,"pageContent":"§ 3.9 A ]L W ith due consideration given to genre: by the word visaya we are here to understand the varieties of prose composition.K Whenever it is based on the aforesaid appropriateness to rasa formation, the texture (racanâ) will be beautiful.

This [propriety] will assume some alteration by considerations of genre, but will not be wholly changed. For example, even in prose a texture of very long compounds will not be beautiful in an äkhyäyikä in passages of love-in-separation or tragedy, while in a play a structure [completely] without compounds will not be beautiful in a description of fury or heroism. But the appropriateness to the genre takes away from or adds to the measure [given by therasa]. Thus in an äkhyäyikä one will never go so far as to write without any compounds at all, while in plays, etc., which are the sphere [of uncom­pounded texture], one will never go so far as to write with really long compounds. This is the direction to pursue in the matter of texture. 11. A summary verse appears at this point in MS ga of the KM edition, in Krishnamoorthy’s Moodabidre MS, and in the Kalpalatäviveka.

Just how it is so made to appear, however, will be explained in the following.1. That is, in that variety where the whole work rather than a word or sentence, etc., acts as manifestor. For the word ätman in the sense of “variety,\" cf:-2.20 A, opening sentence.L It has been explained above how poetry of unperceived inter­val is revealed in the presence of texture. 1 That it may be revealed by a work taken as a whole is a matter beyond dispute that needs no special statement. In order, however, to instruct poets and sensitive readers in the means of achieving such suggestion in a work as a whole, these means should be described. Hence what follows.

The forming of such a plot is one means by which a work as a whole becomes a suggestor. What is meant here by appropriateness of the vibhävas to the rasa is obvious. Appropriateness of the (sthäyi-) bhävas is derived from appropriateness of the characters. Characters differ by their having the emotions (bhävas) of the upper, middle, or lower classes and by their having the emotions of gods or humans. A basic emotional drive (sthäyibhäva) that is described by following these distinctions and not confusing them will be “appropriate.” On the other hand, if one describes the energy (utsäha) or the like of a god as belonging to a mere human, or that of a mere human as belonging to a god, the emotion will be inappropriate. For example, in a passage dealing with a king who is a mere human, if one describes activities in which he leaps across the seven seas, one’s description, even if beautiful in itself, will as a rule be without rasa and tasteless. The reason for this would be its inappropriateness.L F irst: The various means by which a work as a whole may be suggestive of rasa can be described helpfully only if presented in a"},{"pageNumber":444,"pageContent":"429certain order. First, then, comes of the consideration of plot. Next, the insertion of other elements, the carrying [of the whole] to a conclusion, watchfulness over the rasa, and finally the appropriateness of the figures of speech used to describe the appropriate vibhävas, etc. [The Kârikâs] now set forth these five elements in order: T he m eans by which, etc.T he appropriateness of these elem ents: If one would describe love, one should adopt a plot in which there may be a clear appear­ance of such vibhävas as seasons, 1 garlands, etc., of anubhâvas such as playful gestures (lîlâ) , 2 and of sancarins such as joy, firmness, etc. Obvious: being known from everyday life as well as from Bharata’s textbook. A ctivities: the term is meant to include the basic emotional drive of energy which would find its scope in such activities. For it is the appropriatemess of a sthäyibhäva that is under discussion at this point, not the appropriateness of an anubhâva.3 Even if beautiful: so far as the power of description is concerned.

Abhinava, on the other hand, seems to be using the word in its sense of playful or amorous gesture; it would thus include the sidelong glances (BhNÉ 1, p. 305), revealing motions of the arms (Bhattalollata, quoted by Mammata, p. 87), and similar gestures^ regularly included in the anubhävas. 3. The vyäpära (activities) of the king would properly speaking form an anubhâva, a subject not properly under discussion here. Hence Abhinava’s explanation that vyäpära really refers to the utsäha (a sthäyibhäva) which prompts the activities.3.10-14 aA But now we hear of such adventures as journeys to the nether world taken by King Sätavähana and others. So what impropriety is there in describing the extraordinary and superhuman power of kings who ruled over all the earth? The objection is not to the point. We do not say that descriptions of the extraordinary power of kings are inappropriate; rather, that in a narrative which has been invented and"},{"pageNumber":445,"pageContent":"430is based on purely human characters, matters that are appropriate to gods are unfitting. If the character in a narrative is partly devine and partly human, there is no contradiction in introducing matters appropriate to both, as in the narrative of Pändu and his sons. As for the heroic deeds traditionally ascribed to Sätavähana and others like him, if we treat of their deeds within the traditional limits, our description will be proper. But anything other than that, even in the case of such kings as these, will be improper. The heart of the matter may be put thus:For the spoiling of rasa there is no cause other than impropriety. On the other hand, composing a work within recognized proprieti is the very Upanishad of rasa.1Accordingly, Bharata has laid down a rule which must be observed in the making of plays of the nätaka type: that “they shall contain a well known plot and a hero who is well known and noble” (BhNÉ 18.10). By this means the poet will not find himself in doubt concerning the hero’s appropriateness to the rasa or his lack thereof. But if one were to compose a nätaka or some other type of play2 by using an invented plot and a hero that is not well-known and not appropriate, he would commit a greaat folly.1. Upanishad: i.e., the true means of attaining the goal. The verse has already been referred to by Abhinava 3.6 e L. 2. The word nätakädi presents difficulties, for strictly speaking a play with an invented plot cannot be called a nätaka. Abhinava offers several explanations; cf. end of L section below. It seems to me that Änanda’s lack of clarity is due to his compressing sev­eral ideas into a short space. He seems to mean the following. If one were to compose a nätaka with a hero whose character does not fit the recognized pro­prieties, or if one were to compose a play other than a nätaka with an invented plot and an inappropriate hero, for the likelihood of the hero’s impropriety would be greater in an invented plot, the result would be faulty.[ § 3.10—14a AL B u t anything o th er than:_i.e., in addition to that. What our author really implies is this. Matters should be so described that there may be no breach in the credence of the audience.

It is for this reason that our author says that even in the case of Räma, if other wondrous powers are invented, they too will be improper. So one should not describe something that cannot be believed.By this m eans: viz., by using a well known plot and a noble hero. F ind him self in doubt: i.e., ask himself what he should write. If one: if a poet. A g reat folly: The general sense is that this is the reason why the sage Bharata did not describe nätakas and the like with invented plots and thus one should not attempt them. The element ädi in nätakädi means “similar to.” Its purpose is to refer to the dima and the like, where the well known exploits of a god are described. Another commentator, however, has said that nätakädi is a bahuvrihi denoting a subsidiary element2 and that what is meant is a prakarana. Or, we may take a different reading: nätikädi. There again the sense of ädi will be “similar to.” Now Bharata defines the natikä as a play in which “by its combining the character of a prakarana and a nätaka the plot is invented and the hero is a king” (BhNS 18.58). Accordingly, we are to understand [the term nätikädi] as referring to the invented plot [of the one component) and the kingly hero [of the other component] respectively.§ 3.10-14 a L ]1. Abhinava expatiates on this subject (prapattäv ayogyatä) in ABh 1, pp. 280 ff. Cf. also Masson and Patwardhan, Éântarasa p. 74. 2. By thisexplanation nätakädi would be an atadgunasarnvijnänabahuvrihi, meaning “a play belonging to the list of play types in which nätaka stands first.” The term would not refer to nätaka, but to the subsidiary members of the list, such as the prakaraiia, the type of play with invented plot. Two objections may be raised. First, àdt-compounds are invariably of the other, tadguna, type (see Mahäbhäsya on Pan. 1.1.27) except in the hands of ingenious commentators (e.g., Käsikä on Pan. 6.1.6; Sankara and Bhäskara on Brahmasütra 1.1.2, etc.). Second, suppose we allow nätakädi to stand for prakaranam. If a play were to have a well known hero, it could not be called a prakarana. So we have jumped out of the frying pan into the fire."},{"pageNumber":447,"pageContent":"[ § 3.10-14 b A3.10-14 bA An objector may here grant that in describing the basic driv­ing force of energy and the like the poet must take into some considera­tion the differing proprieties of the human and the divine. But what is the use of such consideration, he may ask, in dealing with love? Surely the love of gods may be described by the actions that are appropriate to love here in India. Such an objection would be wrong. Prom impro­prieties in this area even greater faults will ensue. Thus, if we assign a type of love to characters of the upper class by recourse to what is ap­propriate to the lower class, how ridiculous will be the result! Even in India what is appropriate in love differs according to the three classes of men. But, says the objector, that the proprieties of the gods should differ from those of humans [in matters of energy and the like] cannot help us here in dealing with matters of love. We answer by pointing out that we do not claim any difference between divine and human pro­prieties in the sphere of love. Indeed, love among the gods will be well described if it is based on love as practised among the upper classes, such as kings, here in India. But just as what is recognized as vulgar love is not found to be attached to kings in plays of the nätaka type and the like, just so should it be avoided in writing of the gods. If you say that nätakas and the like are performed, and that it is because the performance of sexual enjoyment is indecent that this subject is there avoided, we reject [your limitation]. If a performance of this subject is indecent, how can a poetic description of the same subject be free of the same charge? Accordingly, whether in the literature of performance or in poetry which is not performed, the description of vulgar sexual enjoy­ment between characters of the upper classes, kings and ladies, is highly indecent, just like a description of the sexual enjoyment of our parents. Precisely the same charge appears within the sphere of the gods.Furthermore, sexual intercourse is not the only form of love-in­enjoyment (sambhogasrngära). Other forms, such as the interchange of glances and the like are possible and can be used in writing of upper class characters. Thus, that which is appropriate to the character is to be followed in treating of sexual desire (rati) just as of energy (utsâ- ha). The same is true of wonder (vismaya) and the other sthäyibhävas."},{"pageNumber":448,"pageContent":"433The fact that literature furnishes examples of careless writing by great poets in this area [of sex] is to be accounted a fault of those poets. But, as they have concealed it by means of their skill, it passes unnoticed, as we have already remarked (3.6 e A).The need for appropriateness of the anubhâvas [to the rasa] is obvious in Bharata and other authorities.§ 3.10-14 c A ]L In answer to the question how a poet is then to write about love-in-enjoyment, he says “[sexual intercourse] is not [the only form],” etc. Thus: Bharata too, in various places and in diverse ways, has made appropriateness to the character a criterion [for the description] of vibhâvas, anubhâvas, and the like, as when he says [of the vyabhi- cäribhäva surprise (âvega)) that it is received “with fortitude by upper and middle class characters and with consternation by the low.* 1BhNÉ 7.63, where the text reads câpasarpanaih (running away) in place of the consternation (sambhramena ca) here quoted.3.10-14 cA What the foregoing amounts to is this. A poet who follows the system of Bharata and others, who studies the work of great poets of the past, and who gives rein to his own genius, must still be attentive and exert the greatest care not to relax or depart from the proprieties of the vibhâvas and the other factors of rasa. In saying that the choice of an appropriate plot, whether traditional or invented, will be suggestive of rasa, the Kärikä implies that however many and delightful (rasa­va£) may be the tales furnished by tradition and history, the poet must choose for his plot only such a one as will furnish vibhâvas, etc., appropriate to his rasa. He must be even more careful if he invents his plot than if he takes it from tradition, for if the poet stumbles here out of heedlessness, he will incur a heavy suspicion of his lack of judgment.

The date of its compo­sition doubtless falls before the defeat of its author by Lalitäditya of Kashmir (see RajTar. 4.134-140). which is perhaps to be set in a.d. 733 (see Introduc­tion, p. 2) and certainly within a few years of that date.

If he observes a pattern in the story that goes against the rasa, he should eliminate it and bring in some other story appropriate to the rasa by his invention. A poet has no need to carry out a mere chronicle of events. That is a task accomplished by the historian.1.

This is quite right according to our author, who goes on to say: A p oet, etc.1. yathäsayyä: see 1.13 h L, note 6. 2. The remark is of interest, for thisis precisely the pattem of the story in the Vulgate version of the Harivamsa; see Bombay text 2.65-76. These chapters follow on the simple statement of 2.64 that Krishna dug up a pärijäta tree and took it to Dvârakâ. They record the jealousy of Satyabhämä, Krishna’s assuaging promise to give her the tree which brings youth and assures a wife of her husband’s love, Krishna’s battle with Indra, and the transportation of the stolen tree to Dvârakâ on the back of an elephant. These chapters are found in all MSS collated by the critical edition except those of the £äradä family, from Kashmir, and M 1-3 from Kerala. The critical edition relegates them to Appendix 1, number 29. Abhinava’s remark is evidence that the pärijätaharana was never regarded as scriptural in Kashmir. It is tempting to make the further inference that the scriptural accounts now available are based on the imaginative work of Sarva- sena. There is room in a history of Sanskrit literature for a small chapter on Purànic borrowings from kävya next to the large chapter on the borrowings of kävya from the Pur an as.3.10-14 fA [Commentary on point (5) of 3.10-14 K.\\ Now for a further, major means by which as work as a whole may become suggestive of"},{"pageNumber":452,"pageContent":"437rasa. One should construct the sandhis (the successive stages of plot development), which are called mukha (beginning), pratimukha (devel­opment), garbha (the center), avamarsa (dubiety, also called vimarsa, “the struggle”), and nirvahana (conclusion), as well as the component parts of these sandhis, which are called upaksepa (planting the seed) , 1 etc., with a design toward the revelation of rasa, as has been done in the Ratnävali, and not merely toward fulfilling the prescriptions of a textbook, as for example in the Venisamhära, where the component known as viläsa (amorousness) has been used in the development sec­tion in the Second Act simply out of a desire to follow the dictates of Bharata, although this component is inharmonious with the rusa.1. The sandhis and sandhyangas are defined in BhNÉ Chapter 19 and in DR Chapter 1. For a detailed study of how the traditional prescriptions are applied in the case of a classical play (the Uttararämacarita) see Margaret Kane, The Theory of Plot Structure in Sanskrit Drama.§ 3.10-14 f L ]L T he sandhis. Princes, who are not educated in scripture— those works of sruti and smrti which consist in commands, like those of a master, to do this or that—and who have not received instruction from history, which like a friend reveals to us the connection of cause and effect with such persuasive instances as “This result came from such an act,” and who are therefore in pressing need of instruction, for they, are given the power to accomplish the wants of their subjects, can be given instruction in the four goals of man only by our entering into their hearts. And what enters into the heart is the relish of rasa (rasa- sväda, the imaginative experience of emotion). Now since this rasa is brought about by the union of the vibhävas and their related factors, a union which is invariably connected with instruction in the four goals of man, it follows that the the subjection of a man to the relishing of the rasas by a literary construction of the vibhävas, etc., appropriate to rasa, serves at the same time for the instruction (vyutpatti) that naturally results. In this way [literary] delight (pratiti) is an aid to instruction. Our teacher [Bhattatauta] has put.the matter thus: “Rasa is delight; delight is the drama; and the drama is the Veda [the goal of wisdom].” Delight and instruction are not different in nature, for they occupy a single realm.1 It is the appropriateness of the vibhävas and their related factors that is the basic cause of literary delight, as we have said more than once. Our inner understanding (svarüpavedana)"},{"pageNumber":453,"pageContent":"438of the nature of the vibhävas, etc.—that they are appropriate to this or that rasa—may be called our instruction insofar as it ends in that result.2 Now results may be brought about by the unseen force of our karma, or by the grace of the gods, or otherwise [sc., by accident]. But none of this is to be taught, for we would then not be applying our instruction to the means.3 Accordingly, by showing in the person of the hero and the villain how success attends upon him who employs right means and destruction upon him who employs wrong means, we should educate the audience in the distinction between means which are helpful and those which are harmful.A means when employed by a human agent falls into five stages (avasthâs): svarüpa (the directed activity itself in its undeveloped stage), then a certain swelling or development [from the svarüpa], then its attainment of a state fit to produce a result, then its falling into a position of doubt under the attack of opponents, and finally, when the opposition has ceased and all hindrances have been hindered, the definitive result. These are the elements of the causal process at least so far as it appears in characters who are capable of enduring hard­ship, who fear to be separated [from their loved one], and who act with circumspection.4 The five stages of this causal process have been described by the sage Bharata:Writers should know that where a goal is to be achieved, the causal activity takes place in five stages in the following order: beginning, effort, possibility of success, certainty of success,® and achievement of the goal. [BhN$ 19.7-8]Such are the stages of the causal process. The plot by which the actor carries them out is likewise divided into five sandhis (joints): the mukha, pratimukha, garbha, avamarsa, and nirvahana. They are called “joints” in accordance with their function, for they are the parts of the plot which are joined together (sandhïyante) [to make the play]. Since we observe a certain order within the function carried out by each of these sandhis, the plot is further divided into subsidiary divi­sions. These are the sandhyangas (components of the sandhis) such as the upaksepa (planting the seed), parikara (working it in), parinyäsa (reaffirmation), vilobhana (temptation), etc.6The five arthaprakrtis (plot stimulants) 7 are included within the sandhis. To be specific, there are three arthaprakrtis belonging to the hero insofar as his success depends on his own efforts (sväyattasiddhi)6: the bïja, the bindu, and the kärya. The bija [prompts] all his actions, the bindu sets them in motion again [after an interruption], and the[ § 3.10-14 f l"},{"pageNumber":454,"pageContent":"439kärya brings them to a conclusion. These are three different natures (prakrtis) or dispositions of the agent, namely that of observation, pur­suit, and achievement, in attaining of his goal (artha). Insofar as the hero’s success depends on his friends, the action of his helper may be for the hero’s sake, or for the helper’s sake, or for the helper’s sake as well as the hero’s.9 As the type of action common to both these purposes can be designated as prakari when it is extensive and as patäkä when it is particularly noticeable, these two terms prakari and patäkä have been used (by Bharata as names of the fourth and fifth arthaprakrtis].Thus the principal action, which ends with the achievement of the stated goal, should be composed with five sandhis and a full set of sandyangas and should impart instruction to all people. But in the subordinate action these rules do not apply. Thus Bharata has said:In a subordinate plot, because it depends on something else, [namely, the main plot,] these rules do not apply. [BhNS 19.19]Such are the rules. And so in the Ratnävalt, a play in which the char­acter of the hero, as “brave and amorous,” removes any impropriety in his pursuit of enjoyments so long as they are not opposed to dharma— indeed their pursuit is praiseworthy by the maxim that “one should not be without pleasure”10—we find a mention, at the very beginning11 of the play, of the aim as the obtaining of a maiden, an aim closely con­nected with another great aim, the obtaining of universal sovereignty.12 With this revelation as a beginning, we are then shown the five sandhis with the five stages and all the appropriate sandhyaiigas and the artha­prakrtis. For the requirements that begin with the bija have been dis­played in the words “In this undertaking which will cause my lord’s prosperity” [Ratn. 1.8], and the requirements that begin with the upa- ksepa have been displayed by the words “Through whom all talk of war has ceased” [Ratn. 1.9] and “The kingdom is now without an enemy\" [Ratn. 1.10] and “Now is the time to pursue enjoyment.” 13 But to ex­emplify all the sandhyaiigas by adducing the full text in each instance would add too much to the size of my commentary, while if I were to exemplify them without giving the context, my examples would only lead to confusion. So I say no more.As our author wishes to emphasize the care that should be given to this matter [of harmonizing the sandhyaiigas, etc., with the rasa of the play], he comments on the contrary fault, which the Kärikä expressed in the words “and not brought in merely to fulfill the requirements,” by explicitly giving an example: not merely, etc.§ 3.10-14 f L ]"},{"pageNumber":455,"pageContent":"440The reason for the use in the Kârikâ of the words “merely” and “out of a desire” is as follows. Bharata has stated that the purpose of the sandhyangas is to be auxiliary to the rasa by rendering the plot beautiful. They are not intended to have an invisible effect or to remove obstacles, as do the components of the pürvaranga.1* Thus he says:The purpose of the angas in this textbook is visible and is sixfold: ( 1 ) the proper arrangement of the subject matter; (f) preserving the plot from fail­ure;1* (3) enabling one’s production to please the audience; (4) hiding (i.e., leaving out] that which should be hidden; (5) expressing [the matter] in a wonderful [i.e., impressive or striking] way; (5) revealing [all of] that which should be revealed. [BhNÉ 19.15-52]And later, in defining viläsa (amourousness) as a component of the pratimukhasandhi, he says: “ Viläsa is said to be a yearning for the enjoyment of rati' (19.76). The term “enjoyment of rati\" is used to imply such vibhâvas and the like as shall suggest the basic emotional drive (sthäyibhäva) of the main rasa of the play. [The author of the Venisam/iara16] has failed to understand the meaning properly, for in that play the rasa in question is the heroic (vira) . 171. Both are found where rasa is present. 2. Compare Namisädhu on Rudrata 1.18: yuktäyuktaviveka ucitänucitatvapanjnänam [vyutpattir iyam] “Education (vyutpatti) is the discrimination of right and wrong, the thor­ough knowledge of what is appropriate and what is not.” 3. The only useful thing to teach is that results come about by human effort {purusa- kära). Then we have a subject for instruction, namely the means that our effort may employ. 4. The reason for this qualification appears from Abhi- nava’s comment (ABh) on BhNÉ 19.17-18. In the types of play called dima and samavakdra, the fourth stage of the causal process is not expressed and consequently the fourth sandhi is dropped. This, Abhinava tells us, is be­cause the heroes of such plays are so arrogant (atyuddhata) that they do not fear any opposition such as appears in the fourth sandhi. Where the hero is drtisahisnu and worries about opposition, all five sandhis must be given. In the vyâyoga and thdmrga types two sandhis are omitted, in the prahasana type three (the second, third, and fourth). In the prahasana the hero is adharmapräya “pretty much a rascal.\" Presumably he would lack all the qualities here mentioned, ärtisahisnutä, vipralambhabhirutd, and preksd- pürvakära, that necessitate the full set of avasthds. 5. Niyataphalaprdpti. The Indian tradition is unanimous in interpreting this phrase as “certainty of achieving the goal,” although the commentators are forced to qualify it by adding “if some particular opposition can be overcome.” Sten Konow, Das Indische Drama, p. 19, took the phrase to mean “withheld success” (zurück­gehaltene Erlangung). This is etymologically possible and makes better sense[ § 3.10—14 f L"},{"pageNumber":456,"pageContent":"than the traditional interpretation. 6. For definitions of the sandhyangas see BhNÉ 19.69 fï., DR 1.27 ff., Lévi p. 36 ff. 7. The syntax of the Sanskrit is obscure in parts of the passage which follows. The content consists in an effort to derive the meaning of arthaprakrti from the meaning of its compo­nent words and to assign the individual arthaprakrtis to their proper agent. Abhinava here takes arthaprakrti to mean the disposition or nature which the agent assumes in his pursuit of his goal. In Ahh 19.20 he offers a different analysis, viz., the various means (prakrti = upäya) which are used in pursuit of the goal. Neither explanation, it seems to me, throws much light on the subject. What we have in the arthaprakrtis are five very disparate factors by which the plot is impelled forward. The nature of the separate factors can best be understood by reference to examples. In the Éâkuntaia the bija, or seed, first appears in Act I, verse 11, where the ascetic who greets Dusyanta blesses him with the words \"May you obtain a son who shall be a univer­sal monarch.” The achieving of such a son becomes the seed of the whole drama which follows, the final cause, in Aristotelian terms, of all the action. The binda (“drop\") appears in Act II after verse 7. The main business of the drama has been interrupted by the general of the army with his plans for the king’s hunting expedition. Dusyanta cancels the expedition and, left alone with the clown, reverts to a confession of his love for 3akuntala. Thus the “drop” sets the main action in motion again. The metaphor of a drop may have arisen by reference to a drop of oil which spreads out over water (so ABh on 19.23), or by reference to the continuous dripping of ghee which keeps a fire burning (Bhoja’s $P p. 578). The kärya (“result”) comes in Act VII with Dusyanta’s discovery and recognition of his son. The prakari and patâkâ are two types of interlude, long and short respectively, in which the chief characters do not appear. They too help the plot forward by bringing to Bear on it events which are undiscoverable from the action directly rep­resented through the hero and heroine. As for the term arthaprakrti itself, the original sense must have been the forwarding or advancing of the dra­matic goal, then by metonymy the factors which so advance it. The three categories avasthäs, sandhis, and arthaprakrtis may be distinguished func­tionally as follows. The avasthäs are the stages of the causal process from onset to denoument. The sandhis are the plot-segments corresponding to these stages. The arthaprakrtis are five factors which stimulate the action through the course of these stages and segments. 8. In ABh 3, pp. 5-8 Abhinava distinguishes two types of hero: the hero whose success depends on his own.efforts (svayattasiddhi), such as Rama, and the hero whose suc­cess depends on the effort of his friend or minister (saciväyattasiddhi), such as King Udayana in the Tâpasavatsarâja. Here, however, he seems to en­visage the hero as characterized in both ways. 9. In ABh on 19.20 Abhi­nava claims that the chief character of the patâkâ works both for his own aim and for that of the hero (svärthasiddhisahitayä parârthasiddhyâ yvktah),§ 3.10—14 f L ]"},{"pageNumber":457,"pageContent":"whereas in the prakarî he works solely for the hero (parärthasiddhyä éuddhayâ yvktah).10.

But is this the sense that Abhinava intended? Dhanika on DR 1.27 gives Ratn. 1.6 as the upaksepa. One could equally well choose Ratn. 1.8, which likens the hero to the bow of the love god. One might then take the next two quotations to exemplify the immediately fol­lowing sandhyaiigas, the parikara and the parinyäsa. Our present text of the Ratndvalx lacks the last of Abhinava’s quotations. Reference to the ABh is no help, for there Abhinava takes his examples from the Venisamhdra. 14. The components of the pürvaranga (the musical ritual preliminary to the play) are essentially religious and so have an adrstdrtha like a Vedic sacrifice (yajna) where one must follow the scriptural rules in every detail. The sandhyaiigas, on the other hand, have a visible effect, namely the beautifying of the play. It is that effect which determines how much of the instruction one shall use in a given context. Abhinava draws a similar contrast in ABh Voi. 3, p. 32, but there states, more accurately, that the effect of the pürvaranga is partly invisible (religious) and partly visible (secular). After all, the pürvaranga too can be beautiful. 15. “So that it may have clarity and not appear like so many sticks [thrown together],” ABh Voi. 3, p. 32. 16. Surely some wordsmust have dropped out of the text. 17. Abhinava's meaning in this passage is obscure, perhaps because of a lacuna in the text. It can be cl ified by reference to his remarks in ABh Voi. 3., p. 42, where he takes Bharata’s term ratibhoga to mean not “enjoyment of sexual pleasure” (the natural meaning) but “enjoyment of one’s emotional needs,\" the emotion being that given by the rasa. His remarks run in part as follows. “The viläsa that is exhibited be­tween Duryodhana and BhänumatT * the Venisamhdra is most inappropriate in Duryodhana in the situation he is in. This has been remarked on by former critics, as by the author of the Sahrdaydloka. [He then quotes our 3.12 K and continues.] I have explained the matter at length in my Vivarana [on Bhattatauta’s Kdvyakavtuka; see Introduction, p. 31]. In the text of Bharata here the term rati refers by implication to a sthäyibhäva useful to a man’s needs (pumupayogin) and belonging to the rasa of the play. Accordingly, in a play where vira is predominant, especially in the pratimukha, energy (utsdha) should be placed [emend hy ästhä to pratisthdpyo ?] as the rati.442 [§ 3.10-14 ÎL"},{"pageNumber":458,"pageContent":"§ 3.10-14 g L }3.10-14 gA [Commentary on point (4) of 3.10-14 K.] And now for another means by which a work as a whole may become suggestive of rasa: the intensifying and relaxing of the rasa at the appropriate occasions within the work, as in the Ratnävali; furthermore, the revival of the predominant rasa wherever it begins to fail, as in the Täpasavatsaräja.L Intensifying: by intensifying the vibhävas and their related factors, as in the. words of Sägarikä: “So this is King Udayana.\"’ etc. [Ratn. 1.24 +1]. Relaxing is exemplified when she later flees from Väsavadattä [Äotn. 1.24 +14]. The rasa is again intensified at the mention of the painting [Ratn. 2.0 +23].1 It is again relaxed at the en- trace of Susahgatâ [Ratn. 2.0 +43).2 The constant close handling of a rasa, like that of a delicate jasmine flower, causes it to fade quickly [cf.3.18-19c A], especially if the rasa is love. As Bharata has said:It is because of her frowardness, because of her refusals, because she is hard to get, that a woman is a lover’s chief passion. [BkN!) 22.207]The,same principle holds in works of the heroic rasa. If there is no intensification and relaxation at the right occasions and if the result is achieved quickly like some miraculous reward, the relation between means and end that the author had intended to display will not be shown.F urtherm ore: the reference is to cases where, because of the exi­gencies of the plot, we find a rasa of which the failure, the breaking off, has begun, that is to say, seems likely soon to occur, but has not yet fully occurred.

But it persists because the final goal of the play, namely the recovery of Väsavadattä, is what the king by a great measure most desires, [although it is] enhanced by the recovery"},{"pageNumber":459,"pageContent":"444of his kingdom through the skilful machinations of his minister, a re­covery to which the obtaining of Princess PadmävatT is attached as a subordinate element. [This is clear] because the play ends in a con­clusion which shows the overriding importance of the recovery of the queen: “I have obtained my queen and [sovereignty of] the earth and have formed an alliance with Darsaka” [Tapas. 6.9]. The king’s con­tinuing love for Väsavadattä is like a wall on which the variegated plot is painted,4 for it remains throughout, from the first plotting of the minister, and remains even in the marriage to PadmävatL So it is that this love for Väsavadattä, even when it seems about to fail because of the exigencies of the story, is revived.Thus, in the very first act the love is given clear form in the verse:I have spent the day in gazing at her moonlike face, the evening in her conversation, and the night in her embrace, to which the God of Love gave ardor.Why should my heart yearn, even now as I set forth to find her waiting with her eye fixed on my path?But yes, our festival of love is still unfinished.[Tâpasavatsarâja 1.14]5And in the Second Act, after this love has been interrupted (by the re­port of Väsavadattä’s death in the palace fire], the king’s love survives: Did not your eyes rain moisture and your mouth stream honey?Was not your heart dripping with love and your limbs with sandal ointment?What foothold could an earthly fire find on your body to do its cruel will?Surely the flame that did the deed Was of remorseless lightning.[Tâpasavatsarâja 2.9), in the Third Act:The rooms are blazing on all si her attendants have all fled; the queen is trembling in her fear and falls at every step.The fire that ended that unhappy lady’s life as she cried out for her lord, though now long since burned out to ash, keeps burning me.[ § 3.10-14 g L[Tâpasavatsarâja 3.10]*"},{"pageNumber":460,"pageContent":"§ 3.10-14 g L )And in the Fourth:If I slept, I should doubtless dream about the queenand if, in dreaming, I should call this beautyby the queen’s name, I should deeply wound her pride;wherefore I somehow kept myself awake,only to suffer the alternative and loseall night by my accursed courtesythe chance of seeing my beloved queen.[Täpasavatsaräja 5.3]7In the Fifth Act, where the rasa of tragedy gives way before the hope of reunion, the rasa of love-in-union begins to arise:When the sage’s words come true, my love will scarce be able to restrain her anger at my unfaithfulness.“Forgive me,” I will pleadand she will stand before me,her sweet words broken by the flowing tears,saying “I am not angry.\"[Täpasavatsaräja 5.1]'th Act:My ministers persuaded me to live by tempting me with your recovery[Täpasavatsaräja 6.3a]and so on.1. Enter Sâgarikâ, holding a painting board and enacting her state of love. Sâgarikâ: “Be still, my heart, be still. Give over this constant seeking of a person who cannot be obtained,\" etc. 2. The attention of the audience would be distracted for a moment by the entrance of another character. But the relaxation is very brief. Susangatâ’s sympathy soon prompts her friend to exhibit intense symptoms of love. 3. Abhinava alters the obvious meaning of Änanda’s text because the principal rasa, in a well-constructed play such as the Täpasavatsaräja, never really dies. Technically, therefore, it cannot be revived. What can be revived is some subordinate element such as a in- bhäva. This revival may make us more sharply aware of the predominant rasa.4. Literally, “in the painting, which is the plot, the love of V. is the wall.”5. This stanza is quoted by Kuntaka for its felicitous turn of phrase in the last line ( Vakrokti 1.7, Vrtti, p. 23).

The scene of Act Three is Räjagrha, where Princess Padmâvatï, through the machinations of Yaugandharäyana, has been shown a portrait of King Udayana and by its means has fallen in love with him. Yaugandharäyana has also arranged for Queen Väsavadattä, who, unknown to the king, escaped the fire and is cognizant of the plot necessary to her husband’s welfare, to be given into the care of Padmâvatï. Through the conversation between the two young ladies concerning the subject of the portrait, our attention is drawn from the central love of the play to the new love arising in Padmâvatï. Then King Udayana enters, clad in the garments of an ascetic (tàpasa). His first verse as he comes on stage is the one here quoted, in which the central theme of the play is vividly revived. 7. The stanza appears as 5.24 in the printed text of the play, but the figure is corrected to 5.3 in the errata (skhalitasodhana) inserted in the middle of the index of verses. In the appendix (parisista) of his Sanskrit introduction (bhümikä) the editor discusses the discrepancy in the number of the Act between this passage of the Locana and the manuscript text of the play. He insists that “there is no chance whatever of this stanza’s being connected with the Fourth Act.” I am inclined to agree for the following reason. The stanza is spoken by Udayana on the morning after his marriage to Padmâvatï, “this beauty” whom he fears to offend. The marriage, which we are told of but do not witness, must occur between Act IV, where the king rescues Padmâvatï from suicide and in pity for her betrothes himself, and Act V. As all the events of a single act in a Sanskrit play take place in one day and as the present verse could not be spoken before the day after the marriage, it must fall in Act V. Abhinava’s memory has apparently played him false. 8. The Vidüsaka has reminded the king long since (Act 3, 13 +13-14) that a holy man had foretold that “after marrying a maiden similar to the queen\" he would meet with the queen again. Then on first meeting Padmâvatï the king was struck by her resemblance to Väsavadattä (3.14-15). Before his marriage to Padmâvatï he already remarked (4.12) that if he should facilitate the prediction by entering this marriage, his queen would be jealous when he regained her. In the present verse Väsavadattä has not yet reappeared, but the king's eagerness to regain her overcomes his concern for her anger. I have taken the Täpas. reading purah in pdda d, as the verse gains in vividness by the king’s desire to have the queen, whether angry or jealous or sad, at least standing before him in the flesh.446 (§3.10-14 g L"},{"pageNumber":462,"pageContent":"§ 3.10-14 h L ]3.10-14 hA [Commentary on point (5) of 3.10-14.] For a work as a whole, such as a nâtaka, to become suggestive of rasa, we should understand this further means: that the application of figures of speech should be in conformity with the rasa even though one may have ability [to construct more elaborate figures]. For sometimes an able poet becomes engrossed in the construction of figures and thereby fails to take into consideration how the rasa is to be built. These words may serve as a warning, for there are many examples of poets who have been solely intent on figures and who have neglected rasa.L O f figures: this is an objective genitive, to be taken with “application.” Many examples: as in the play called Svapnaväsava- datta:Opening by the stroke of her beauty the eyelash doorpanels of my eyes, the princess entered the chamber of my heart. 11. The verse is not found in the extant Svapnavdsavadatta and has there­fore provoked much comment. It is likely, but not certain, that the extant play is a version of a play by Bhäsa and that Abhinava is referring to another version of the same play.

In both K and the following Vrtti we take the natural interpretation of the words dhvaner asya. As will be seen, Abhinava gives a very different interpretation.A This type of dhvani where the literal meaning is intended but only as leading to an additional meaning, which has been described as carrying a suggestion similar to a reverberation, in both its subtypes, also appears throughout some passages, as for example in the words of Päncajanya in the Madhumathanavijaya,1 or in the scene where the God of Love meets with his friends in my Visamabânalïlâ,2 or in the Conversation of the Vulture and the Jackal in the Mahâbhârata.31.

Nevertheless this suggested element stands—we must here supply “as a sugggestive factor”—to rasadhvani, the matter with which we are here concerned. The passage in the Vrtti is to be interpreted in the same way. 1 Or, we may construe “dhvaner asya\" [as a genitive of instrument] with the words udyotyo 'laksyakramah” of the next Kârikâ. The sense will thus be: “sometimes by an extended passage, the dhvani of imperceptible succession is also suggested by this variety which has been described as resembling a reverberation.”This amounts to saying that sometimes a whole passage may directly suggest dhvani of the type where the suggested meaning appears like a reverberation, but this ends up by being transformed into rasadhvani. On the other hand, if we interpret the text in a straightforward manner, the present passage, set as it is between preceding and following pas­sages that deal with suggestion of imperceptible interval, will appear as a non sequitur. Furthermore, the words of Päncajanya and si ilar passages would be without rasa.2 So enough of this discussion.In such passages as the followingHow can it be that you who liftedon the tip of your tusk the whole circle of the earthnow find even a lotus-stem bracelettoo heavy for your limbs!3we “have the suggestive words of Päncajanya, which are intended to reveal Krishna’s feelings on being separated from Rukminl.

Abhinava’s interpretation of dhvaner asya in K and of asya ... dhva- neh in A as meaning rasadhvaneh (instead of vivaksitänyaparaväcya) is surely wrong. It necessitates the supplying of words that would not have been omit­ted if they were intended. Equally unnatural is his second explanation, which follows. Abhinava has been led to these unnatural interpretations by a desire to exculpate his author from a charge of non sequitur. K and A had been speaking of rasadhvani and will continue to speak of rasadhvani in 3.16. By hook or by crook Abhinava seeks to avoid a departure from that subject in the present section. 2. Abhinava’s point is that the passages from the Visamabänalilä, which Änanda has in mind, do in fact contain rasa and that consequently Änanda could not have meant the straightforward interpreta­tion, which excludes rasadhvani, to be accepted. 3. The text of the verse as printed in the Kashi Locana is corrupt. One can make out an acceptable text450 [ § 3.15 L"},{"pageNumber":466,"pageContent":"by drawing on Hemacandra’s quotation, Viveka 1.151 (p. 81), and on BP’s emendations. Thus,lîlâdâdhagguvûdhasaalamahïmandalassa cia ajja kîsa mundlâharanam pi tujjha guniâi ahgammi.The word lilà is used of any attribute of an incarnation of Visnu, as these attributes are all assumed by the god playfully, not as a result of the karmic process. Thus lüä-dädhä means “the tusk which you assumed in your boar incarnation.” For dädhä = Sk. damstrâ see Pischel, para. 76. Uvûdha must be a lightened form of uwüdha (metri causa). The BP reading vddharia is metrically impossible. On the other hand, BP is correct in reading mahï (Hemacandra, mahi). For eia = eva, see Pischel, para. 336. A literal (un- metrical) Sanskrit rendering of the stanza would be, lîlâdamstrodvyüdhamahï- mandalasyaivädya / kasmän mrnäläbharanam api tava guru bhavaty ange / /4. The suggestiveness of the verse, as Abhinava sees it, is similar to that of KumSam. 6.84 (see 2.22 A, above) or Sattasai 2.73 (see 2.24 .4, above). It takes the reader, or hearer, a moment to assign a cause for the apparent con­tradiction ( virodhäbhäsa) in what Päncajanya says. If Visnu, who lifted up the earth on his tusk in his boar incarantion, now as Krishna finds a lotus-stem bracelet too heavy, it must be because the fever of love makes insupportable even those objects which are normally cooling agents. But as soon as we un­derstand Krishna's fever of love, we immediately have a relish of vipralambha- srhgära. Compare our remarks in 2.22 L, footnote 2. 5. The text of thisstanza is wildly corrupt in the Kashi text. One is forced to reconstruct it on the basis of BP, Hemacandra ( Viveka 1.152, p. 82), and Mammata (KP 7, exemplar-verse 320, p. 432). All these agree on the first half (in the form printed at the end of this note). But all three show different readings in the second half. BP has sivine vi tumammi puno bhantim (misprint for bhattim] na pasamarämi. Hemacandra has sivine vi tujjha samae pattia bhattim na pupphusi i. Mammata has sivine in tumammi puno pattihi bhattim na pa- sumarämi. Of these versions Hemacandra’s is the only one that is metrically correct; but I make no sense of pattia and I think that the final verb should be pummhasi i (from pra-mrs, to forget). So I would reconstruct the stanza and its Sanskrit translation as follows:humi avahatthiareho nirahkuso aha viveharahio vi sivine vi tujjha samae pattihi bhattim na pummhasimi.[bhavâmy apahastitarekho nirahkuso ’tha vivekarahito pi svapne 'pi tava samaye pratihi bhaktim na vismarämi]6. By suggesting the way in which Youth is affected by Love and presumably in later verses the way in which Spring and Malabar Breeze are devoted, the passage as a whole gives us srhgärarasa itself. 7.

Abhinava’s readings in these two verses are quite peculiar, being furnished by none of the MSS, including those from Kashmir, which are collated in the Critical Edition. But such was his authority that Hemacandra (AC p. 81) and Mammata (KP, exemplar vss. 95- 96) repeat his version without correction. The MBh variants are as follows. 15b, mä bhayam (sämpratam)-, c, bahurüpo; d, jivetâpi; 60a, imam (amtim); b, bhüsanaih samalankrtam; c, putram (bäläs); d, pitrpindadam (avisaiïki- täh). In 15c one may argue that Abhinava’s version is superior. His sense seems to be as follows. This particular hour, viz., near twilight, is subject to many dangers from evil spirits. Accordingly, it is possible that the child is temporarily possessed by an evil spirit. When the hour has passed, viz., at sundown, he may come to life again. Bahuvighno leads to this sense better than bahurüpo.10. The intentions of the two animals are suggested. This is the vastu- dhvani. Once we realize how callous and self-interested they are and, by im­plication, that most people are similar, we become disgusted with the world. This feeling of disenchantment is the basis of sântarasa (the aesthetic percep­tion of peace).[ § 3.15 LK The dhvani (suggestion) of imperceptible sequence [i.e., rasa- dhvani] is sometimes suggested by sup (case endings), tin (personal endings of a verb), vacana (grammatical number), sambandha (rela­tionship as expressed by the genetive); by the force of the kärakas (complements of the verbal activity: agent, object, locus, etc), and by krt (primary suffixes attaching to the verb root), taddhita (secondary suffixes attaching to a substantive stem), and by compounds. * 11. The distinction between sup, a morphological category, and vacana, sambandha, or käraka, which are semantic categories, must be maintained in grammar but is of no real importance to the present purpose. Take the two sentences: annam labhate “he receives food” and annâya vrajati grâmam “he goes to the village for food.” In both sentences food is the obj t complement of an activity (karmakäraka). In the first, where the activity is expressed by a verb, the accusative sup is used, whereas in the second, where the activity (“to seek”) is unexpressed by a verb, the dative sup is used; cf. Pan. 2.3.14. But in a context where rasa (say, karunarasa) is occasioned by the fact that"},{"pageNumber":468,"pageContent":"453food is the object of a poor man’s journey, one may point equally well to the sup or to the kâraka as the suggestive factor. Hence it is that in the examples which follow one may often substitute one of the listed factors for another.§ 3.16 A ]A Dhvani in the highest sense (dhvaner âtma), which is of im­perceptible sequence, namely rasa [bhâva, rasäbhäsa, and bhäväbhäsa], is [sometimes] found to be manifested by the use of particular case endings, particular personal endings, particular grammatical number, particular relationships; by the force of the kärikas, by particular pri­mary suffixes, particular secondary suffixes, and particular compounds. By the use here of the word “and” we may understand particles, verbal prefixes, tenses, and other such factors to be included also. Thus:It is already a humiliationthat I should have opponents. But that among them therd should be a holy man and that he here should slay a host of demons: can it be that Rävana lives?Shame on my son akrajit! What usewas in the waking of my brother Kumbhakarna?What use these twenty arms, so vainly proudof having robbed that miserable village known as heaven![Mahänätaka 9.15 = Hanumannätaka 14.6, variant] 1In this verse nearly all the above factors can be clearly seen as sug- gestors. The suggestiveness of sup, sambandha, and vacana appears in the phrase me yad arayah. “that there should be opponents of me.” 2 In the phrase taträpy asau täpasah “even among them this holy man” we have suggestiveness of a secondary suffix and a particle.3 In the pas­sage so ’py atraiva nihanti râksasabalam jïvaty aho rävanah “that he should slay here a host of demons [and] that Rävana lives” we have the personal endings of the verbs [fi of nihanti and jivati] and the force of the kärakas [locus expressed by atra, object by balam}. In the second half of the verse, dhig dhik sakrajitam, etc., “shame, shame on Sakra- jit,” etc., we have suggestiveness of a primary suffix [the kvip suffix of sakrajit], of a secondary suffix [the suffix tikac of grämatikä], of a compound svargagrämatikä, and of a verbal prefix [vi in vilunthana].In a poem of this sort, put together with so many suggestive factors, an extraordinary beauty of composition is apparent. For if there is a certain beauty of composition in a poem where a single word reveals a suggestion, how much greater is this beauty where there is a combina­tion of so many (suggestive factors], as here in the verse just quoted. For"},{"pageNumber":469,"pageContent":"454while the word “Rävana” is here ornamented by the type of suggestion where the denoted meaning is shifted (arthäntarasamkramitaväcya), many other kinds of suggestion, which we have just explained, appear in the stanza.1. It is worth noting as indicative of the differences of evaluation among Indian critics that this verse, so much admired by our authors, is quoted as an example of poetic faults by Mammata (7, ex. 183). Mammata objects to the word order of the first line and to the attributive position in the fourth line of vrthä, which should be in predicative position. A fault that most commenta­tors pass over in silence is the use of prabodhitavatä, active, for metrical reasons in place of prabodkitena, passive. Nägoji explains it as prabudh + bhdve kta + matup: “being one of whom there has been an awakening.” 2. Sup and plural number appear in arayah. The sambandha of self and opponents is expressed by the genitive in me. Each of these factors emphases the outrage felt by Rävana and consequently the raudrarasa of the verse. 3. täpasah = tapas + taddhita suffix an (Pan. 5.2.103). The particle is api “even.” For the suggestive force see Abhinava below.[ § 3.16 AL In the foregoing text our author has shown all the suggestive factors of rasadhvani, which arises without perceived interval, from the phoneme up to the work as a whole. There would thus appear to be nothing left in the area to describe.1 However, in order to furnish in­struction to lovers of poetry, he examines the suggestive factors further, testing them in a subtle way by positive and negative agreement: by sup, tin, etc. But2 I would understand the following statement [of the Kärikä] together with [that of] the Vrtti, in this way. A suggestion of the type similar to a reverberation may appear through the agency of sup endings, etc., this suggestion taking the form of a speaker’s in­tention. Now this suggestion similar to a reverberation effected by sup endings, etc., in turn suggests that type of dhvani where the succession is imperceptible.Som etim es: this is to be construed with the preceeding Kärikä.3 For sup endings, etc., always reveal a particular intention of the speaker; but in the examples here given this suggested intention by its assuming the form of a vibhäva suggests the rasa, [6Aâvo,] etc., appropriate to that [vibhäva]. To state the m atter in other words: Rasa may be sug­gested directly by the various suggestive factors from a single phoneme up to the work as a whole by [the poet’s directly] designating a vibhä­va;* or it may be suggested indirectly through the suggestion [rather"},{"pageNumber":470,"pageContent":"455than the designation] of a vibhäva, etc. Now it is here [viz., to this latter case] that the statement (of 3.15] applies, which spoke inciden­tally of this indirect sort of suggestiveness belonging to a work as a whole.5 Now the present Kärikä speaks of this [indirect suggestiveness] as belonging to phonemes, words, etc. Hence where the Vrtti says is found to be m anifested and later says can be seen as suggestors, we must supply “indirectly, through the suggesting of a vibhäva, etc.“ [Comment on the verse:] “That I should have opponents” : here the impropriety of a relation (sambandha) of opponents to “me” and the plural of “opponents” suggest a stimulation (vibhäva) of anger.® [That is to say, Rävana feels that no one should dare oppose him, how much less many persons.] Täpasa (holy man) is formed by the secondary suffix an added to tapas (ascetic fervor) with possessive sense: “he of whom there is ascetic fervor.” By this suffix is suggested [Rama's] lack of manliness. The combination of particles tatra7 and api ( “even among them”) suggests the utter impossibility of Râma’s opposition. So long as I live there should be no slaying [of my räksasas by enemies]. The (second] api (that “even” he should slay) suggests that the agent of this slaying is a mere human. “Here” viz., in a land ruled by me: this is the locative complement of the verbal activity while “a host of demons” is the object complement through their being altogether slain by him. The words that carry the personal ending (i.e., nihanti) and the force of these complements (i.e., atra, räksasabalam) suggest a failure of active measures [on Rävana’s part] inasmuch as this inconceivable situation has come upon him. The word “Rävana” carries suggestion of the sort “shifted to another object,” as has been explained before.3 The particles dhig dhik (shame, shame!) taken together with the upa- pada compound [viz., sakrajit] suggests that (the literal meaning of that compound, namely that] “he has conquered Indra” is a myth;9 while the compound beginning with “heaven,” viz., svargagrämatikävilunthana- vrthäcchünaih, suggests Rävana’s memory of his own brave deeds. The secondary suffix tikac in grämatikä, indicating smallness, 10 together with its femi ine inflection, suggests a village deserving of no respect. The prefix vi in vilunthana (robbing) suggests a pitiless invasion. The indeclinable vrthä ( “in vain” ) suggests a belitteling of his bold deeds. The word “arms” by its plural number suggests that these arms rather [than being helpful] are a mere burden. What else can we say than that every portion of this verse, no matter how minutely we analyze it, appears to be suggestive.§ 3.16 L ]"},{"pageNumber":471,"pageContent":"456He now shows the result of this demonstration: [In a poem] of this so rt, etc. He then examplifies what he has said about a single word’s [giving beauty to a poem]: as in th e verse ju st q u o ted. 111. That is to say, the analysis of suggestive factors is logically complete without the present Kârikâ. All cases of the suggestiveness of sup, tin, etc. fall under the categories phoneme, word, sentence, work as a whole, already listed. But it may be useful for the exact appreciation of a poem or for guidance in the writing of poetry to observe just what sorts of words and word elements give rise to the suggestion of nwo. By observing the effect of a poem with (anvaya) and without (vyatireka) a particular sup, tiri, etc., one can see in greater detail exactly where the suggestiveness of rasa may lie. 2. The adversative particle tu may, but does not necessarily, imply that another commentator had understood the passage otherwise. Abhinava is here continuing the line of interpretation that he adopted in 3.15. The par­ticle tu differentiates this line from the straightforward interpretation. The straightforward interpretation would see in all the examples of suggestion that Änanda notices in the Mahänätaka verse so many instances of direct rasadhvani (of imperceptible succession). Abhinava denies this. What we have, he says, is first a vastvdhvani, a suggestion of Rävana’s intention or feelings. This suggestion comes after a perceptible interval from our noticing the suggestive factors such as sup, tiri, kärakasakti, etc. But once we have this suggestion of Rävana’s feelings, we have the very mbhäva (stimulative or reve­latory factor) that immediately suggests raudrarasa (the aesthetic perception of anger and cruelty). The succession from sup, etc., to rävanäbhipräyavyakti is perceptible; the succession from rävanäbhipräyavyakti to raudrarasa is not perceptible. Abhinava here shows an admirable analysis of the aesthetic pro­cess, but I cannot believe that his interpretation renders accurately Änanda’s intention. 3. Abhinava construes thus: dhvaner asya [i.e., anurananopama- dhvaner] dyotyo 'laksyakramah kvacit, “the alaksyakrama variety is suggested by this [anurananarv.pa-}dhvani.” 4. Place a comma at Locana, p. 348, line 2, after pratipädanadvärena. One must understand abhidhayä before vi- bhävädipratipädanadvärena, in contrast to cases where the mbhävas, etc., are suggested rather than directly expressed. 5. Bandhasya here equals pra- bandhasya. Abhinava uses the word prasangät (incidentally) to show that anurananopamadhvani was not in itself the subject of discussion in 3.15 but was brought in because of its indirect effecting of rasa. 6. I have supplied the word co at the end of the sentence mama bahuvacanam. This keeps sambandha and vacanam parallel, as they are in the Vrtti. 7. tatra is listed in the cädigana (Pan. 1.4.57) of nipätas. 8. “Rävana,” in addition to di­rectly denoting an individual, suggests that individual’s possession of those properties of strength, heroism, cruelty, for which Rävana was famous. Cf. the remarks on the word “Rama\" 3.1 a L, above. 9. One may put a comma after[ § 3.16 L"},{"pageNumber":472,"pageContent":"457the word sahakrtah of Locana p. 349, line 4. With äkhyäyikeyam iti one must supply vyahjakatvam from the clause which follows. The formation iakrajit is prescribed by Pin. 3.2.61. Although Panini does not give the formation a sense of past time (upapada suffixes with the sense of past time begin only after Pan. 3.2.84), it is often so taken by commentators and dictionaries; thus Éabdakalpadnima defines the word éakmjit : sakram jitavän, Rävanaputrah. The Rämäyaria tells of his gaining the name Indrajit (= Sakrajit) by his having defeated Indra (Räm. Vulgate, 7.29.20ff.).10. For iti svârthikataddhitaprayogasya we should probably read ity alpä- rthikataddhitaprayogasya. Compare NagojTs Uddyota commenting on the same verse as quoted by Mammata 7, ex. 184: grämasabd&d alpärthe taddhita iti bahuvacanabodhyas tikacpratyayah. This suffix tikac is not mentioned by Panini. Nägojl justifies it by the fiction invented by Käsikä on 4.1.76, that the word taddhitäh in that suini, being used in the plural, implies that there are many taddhita suffixes, even in addition to those prescribed by Panini. One of these, according to Nägojl, is tikac, used after grama and carrying the sense of “small.\" 11. What Abhinava means is that the following expla­nation of the dhvani carried by the word Râvana exemplifies the beauty that the suggestiveness of a single word can give, as opposed to the greater beauty furnished by a plurality of suggestors.§ 3.16a A ]A This sort of composition is frequently found in the works of great men who are endowed with special imaginative genius. Take, for example, this verse of the great sage Vyäsa:All times of happiness are passed,times of hardship are at hand;tomorrow and tomorrow every day grows worse,for the earth has lost her youth.[Mahâbhârata 1.119.6]In this verse we see primary suffix, secondary suffix, and grammatical number producing a suggestion of imperceptible succession [i.e., rasa- dhvani]. In the phrase “the earth has lost her youth” we can see a suggestion of the type where the direct meaning is entirely set aside. 1"},{"pageNumber":473,"pageContent":"4581. The word yauvana (youth) in its direct meaning can refer only to an age span of living creatures. As applied to the earth it can only be used metaphorically, the direct meaning being set aside. Cf. 2.1c A, L.[ § 3.16 a AL Times in which happiness has “passed” (atikränta), that is, in which happiness does not ever occur as a present reality. 1 All such times have passed; not the smallest portion of time now makes for happiness.1 2 “Times of hardship are at hand” (pratyupasthita), that is, they are facing us, they have returned to us, having been afar they are now present. Since every portion of time now furnishes the most manifold misery, time [as a whole] first suggests a disenchantment with the world and this suggests sântarasa (the aesthetic perception of peace) . 3 He speaks of space as well [as time): the earth [a vast extension of space] is such that tomorrow and tomorrow, that is, morning after morning, from day to day, its days are pâpïya, that is, connected with evil ones, under the guidance of most evil persons.4 The sense is that time is inherently evil to begin with, but by the spacial evil consisting in a space coterminous with earth being under the governance of the most evil persons, time has become especially evil. Thus, tomorrow and tomorrow, that is, from day to day, [the earth is] losing its youth, is becoming like an old woman with whom the pleasures of sex are unimaginable; and because of this loss of youth every day that arrives is worse than the day that has passed. Alternative explanations are that the sage has used pâpïya as a word ending in the comparative suffix ïyasun,5 or that he is using a denominative ending in nie.6Is en tirely set aside: He means that this type of suggestion is subordinate to the rasadhvani.1. This is what is suggested by the past participial suffix kta (a primarysuffix) of atikränta. 2. This is what is suggested by the plurality of “times.”3. Abbinava here specifies the double process of suggestion that he holds tothroughout his interpretation of 3.15-16. The first, delayed, suggestion (anu-rananopamadhvani) is of the speaker's intention, viz., that he is disenchanted with the world. This leads to an immediate suggestion (asamlaksitakrama-vyangya) of sântarasa. 4. This farfetched interpretation is in order to avoid admitting that the author has committed a solecism in writing pâpïyadivasa for pâpïyodivasa. Abhinava is taking pâpïya to be formed from papa plus the saisika taddhita suffix cha (= zyo), which according to Pan. 4.2.114 may be employed after stems with an initial vrddhi vowel (such as papa-). Its sense could be the general sense of connection therewith (tasyedam. Pan. 4.3.120),"},{"pageNumber":474,"pageContent":"459which Abhinava renders more specific by tatsvâmika. Later he will admit the natural analysis (fya = the comparative suffix -iyas) as an alternative explanation. 5. In which case the dropping of s would be àrsa (by epic licence). 6. BP explains. First one forms the comparative pdpiyos “more evil.” One then adds nie (= t) to form a denominative verb meaning “it makes greater evil” (Patanjali 3.1.26, Vart. 5, taf karotity upasankhyänam). One then adds ac to form an agent noun: papa + iyasun + nie + ac “(days which are] makers of ever greater evil.” Now before the nie suffix the noun stem (by 6.4.155, Värt. 1, of which a variant is included as a ganasütra in the curädi dhâtupàtha) must be treated as it would be treated before the suffix istha; that is, the last vowel of the stem together with its following consonant must drop (tilopa). This gives us päpiy + nie + ac. Finally Pän. 6.4.51 (ner aniti) comes into play: the suffix nie drops before any further suffix that dispenses with the union vowel i (as does ac). Hence papiy + a.§ 3.16 b A ]A The suggestiveness of case endings and of these other ele­ments is frequently found in the works of great poets both singly and in groups. An instance of the suggestiveness of a word because of its case ending1 is:On which your friend the peacock perches, learning how to dance from my beloved’s clapping of her hands beautiful with bracelets.[Kâlidâsa, Meghadûta 2.16cd]* 1 21. Literally “of a word with case ending\"; but as every noun in Sanskrit has a case ending, the meaning is as we have translated. The suggestiveness of the instance quoted could equally well have been attributed to the gram­matical number of the noun: compare our remarks in footnote 1 to 3:16 K.___2. The half verse is part of the Yaksa’s address to the cloud messenger. Pea­cocks are the friends of clouds because they dance as though in joy as the moonsoon approaches. Abhinava explains the suggestiveness of the plural in “clappings,” which I should fail to see without his aid. Note that Änanda preserves what is doubtless Kalidasa's original reading iinjadvalaya (with the participle éinjat) in place of the corrected form iinjävalaya (with the noun"},{"pageNumber":475,"pageContent":"sinjä) transmitted by Mallinâtha. See Pathak's note, p. 106 of his ed. of Megh. The reason for Mallinätha’s correction is that üji (Dh&tupâtha 2.17) is an anvdâttet verb. Thus its present participle, if used, should be sinjäna, not éinjat.460 [§ 3.16 b AL O f a word because of its case ending: What our author has in mind is to give examples of the suggestiveness of these factors taken singly, now that examples of their combined use have been given. “Clappings\" : the plural suggests that her skill [in music and dancing] is of many varieties and so stimulates the rasa of love-in-separation. * 11. Tdla means not only clapping of the hands but also musical tempo. The suggestion seen by our authors seems to be that the Yaksa’s wife teaches the peacock various rhythms. Her doing so implies an artistic skill that renders her absence more poignant to the Yaksa.A An example of a verb that is suggestive because of its personal ending is:Go away! Don’t wipe my miserable eyes.God intended them only for weeping.So they got drunk on the first sight of you, and failed to show me what your heart was like. 11. The verse is found in a non-vulgate version of the Sattasaï (Weber No. 706). In the Kashi text of the Locano the Prakrit as usual is corrupt. For the opening words read osara rottura-, in the second half read damsana- and jehim. For the Prakrit word pumsa (= Sk. apamria) see Pischel, para. 486.L [After giving a Sanskrit translation of the verse, Abhinava continues:] Since a drunkard knows nothing, no one is at fault here;"},{"pageNumber":476,"pageContent":"461everything has been done by fate. Go away! Make no false efforts [at reconciliation], for fate cannot be reversed. Here the imperative with its personal inflection is suggestive, as are the other words which it flavors.1 This is what our author has in mind.1. BP says that what “go away” suggests is the woman’s jealousy. Ac­tually, the second person active of the imperative {osara and mä pumsa) is more violent and emotional than it would be in Latin or English. Politeness normally dictates a use of the third person passive in Sanskrit imperatives.§ 3.16 d L ]A Another example is:Don’t block my way; move on.Young fool, you are utterly shameless!I cannot stay from my chores;I have to take care of an empty house.11. The verse presupposes that a traveler has stopped a young woman on the road and has tried.to engage her in conversation. Secretly she wishes to accept him as a lover. So under the pretense of sending him off she informs him that there is an empty house nearby where they can make love unob­served. An “empty house\" is the conventional rendezvous of village lovers in Sanskrit poetry; see note on SRK Translation, 813. The woman is probably not referring to her own house. The verse is given with different readings in Weber’s Satasai 961 and in Hemacandra’s AC, Parikh’s edition, p. 84 (the NS edition simply copies from the Locano). In the Locano version we must emend to rundhî no [Weber: mä pantha rundhasu paham\\ Hem.: mä pantha rundha maAarn). For aniricchäo read anirikkhäo = Sk. anirîksyakâh “not free from constraint,” i.e., dependent on the command of others.L [After a translation of the Prakrit, Abhinava continues:] Here the imperative “move on” with its personal ending suggests the fol­lowing. You are inexperienced to show your feeling thus where other people are present. But there is an empty house that could serve as a rendezvous. That is where we should go. 1"},{"pageNumber":477,"pageContent":"4621. Both this verse and the next exhibit some simil ity to the verse quoted under 1.4 b A, “Go your rounds freely, gentle monk.,” etc. In all three verses a command is to be understood otherwise than as expressed. But our authors took the verse of 1.4 b as an example merely of vastndhvani whereas these two verses are said to exhibit rasadhvani, directly according to Änanda if we understand him correctly, indirectly by a suggestion of vastudhvani leading immediately to rasadhvani, according to Abbinava. One may ask where one draws the line. Where does an ironic use of words lead only to the lower form of suggestion ( vastudhvani) and where does it become the soul of poetry (mso- dhvani)? The answer, I think, lies in the passion of the utterance. In both this verse and the following a woman is directly addressing her potential lover. We feel her passion in the imperatives that she uses. The verse bhamma dhammia, addressed to a stupid old monk, while it hints at an erotic situation, lacks any passion of utterance and ends up in the reader’s heart as merely comical.[ § 3.16 d LA An example [of a suggestive relationship expressed by] the itive is:Go somewhere else you innocent puppy.Don't stand here staring at me bathing.A bathing beach is not a place for men afraid of their wives. 1Prakrit verses that make use of the suffix ka7 show the suggestiveness that is possible in secondary suffixes. Ka expresses heavy scorn.1. In the text of the Prakrit verse join hnâanti _ together and separate puloesi earn. Earn represents the Vedic etad “here, thus,” not Sk. evam, which is evvarn in Prakrit. In the second half, read eia na hoi for viana hoi. 2. As in ftä/a[£]a and 6/iiru[fc]änaT7i in the verse.L Go somewhere else, bälaka [lit., pitiable child], you of ungrown intelligence. Why do you keep looking at me here as I am bathing? Bho (you!) is a form of scornful address. A beach is not to be related to men afraid of their wives.

Vikramorvasiya 4.IO]2 Tiere the particle “and” (ca) is suggestive.1. Vrttyaucityena: the same term as in 3.7 a A; see footnote 2 on that passage. But Änanda probably means here that the degree of compounding must be in accord with the genre of the work. Änanda gives no example here of this type of suggestiveness. 2. The association of the moonsoon with days spent at home in marital bliss (cf. HOS Voi. 44, p. 127, para. 6) makes Purüravas’ loss of Urvasï harder to bear. In d the reading of our text nir- ätapärdharamyaih makes no sense to me. Dr. Krishnamoorthy does the best he can with it: “I believe the beauty of days will be halved for want of any sunshine,” but the point of the verse must be that the days are too beautiful to bear, not that their beauty is reduced. So I have taken the reading of the printed editions of the play nirdtapatvaramyaih.L T he p article ca: he uses the singular in the sense of a class to refer to the two occurrences of ca (“both and”). These two"},{"pageNumber":479,"pageContent":"464occurrences tell us that the separation [from Urvasï] and the advent of the moonsoon, coming by chance together, like a boil on a tumor, are more than life can bear. By this means the word “lovely” (ramyaih) becomes especially stimulative of rasa.[ § 3.16 f LA Another example is:She turned her face aside, with its long lashes, and her fingers covered her lips which struggled to pronounce the words of prohibition.I dared to lift her face, but dared not kiss it.[Kâlidâsa, Éàkuntala 3.22]Here it is the particle “but” (tu).L T he particle “b u t” : By its indicating his regret it suggests that if the king had only received one kiss, he would have satisfied his every desire. This is what our author has in mind.A Note that while the suggestive function of particles has gen­erally been recognized [by the grammarians], what we are referring to here is their suggestiveness with respect to rasa. Verbal prefixes have [this sort of] suggestiveness in such verses as:Rice grains lie scattered at the foot of trees, dropped by the parrots from their nesting hoi Here and there are rocks profuse with oil, that show where oil-huts have been lately ground.The deer with long-accustomed confidence stroll by untroubled by the sounds of men.The paths that lead from the waterside are tracked with drippings from the hem of hermits’ bark-cloth.[Kâlidâsa, Éâkuntala 1.13]1,2"},{"pageNumber":480,"pageContent":"4651. The verse describes Kâsyapa’s hermitage, which King Dusyanta and his charioteer have just entered. “Oil-nuts” (ingudïphala): Terminalia catalpa. The leaves were fed to camels (MBh 2.47.4). The oil expressed from the nut was used to heal wounds (Éâk. 4.14) and, by persons living removed from civilization, as a substitute for mustard or sesamum oil. Märkandeya Purâna 28.26 remarks that the vanaprastha must use “wild oil.\" The point of Änanda’s quotation lies in the word prasnigdhàh “profuse with oil,” where the prefix pra intensifies the basic sense of snigdha “oily,” 2. The Kävyamälä edition here adds a second quotation and a summary remark of the Vrtti. As Abhinava does not comment on the passage, it may not be genuine. But given the rarity of remarks in Sanskrit on the aesthetic effect of meter, the passage is of interest. It runs:madamukharakapotam unmayüram praviralavämanavrksasannivesam vanam idam avagähamänabhimam vyasanam ivopari därunatvam etiityddau pmsabdasyaupacchandikasya ca vyanjanatvam adhikam dyotate, which may be translated:With its enraptured sound of doves and eager peacocks, this waste land of sparse, dwarfed trees is like unto human vice: it is dangerous to him who enters and bodes cruel consequence.In these examples suggestiveness is intensified by the prefix pra [sc., in the example from the Éâkuntala] and by the aupacchandasik'a meter [sc., in the example just given).With regard to the meter the remark seems to me to be just. The contrast between the happily tripping syllables of the line openings and the heavycadence ( — ^ ------) is very nicely parallel to the contrast between thetempting beauties of the forest (and of vice) as first seen and then the heavy disaster which follows if one yields to the temptation to enter.§ 3.16 h L ]L H as generally been recognized: He says this because it is proclaimed in the schools of the grammarians that particles are sug­gestive (or indicative, dyotaka) on the ground that they lack the prop­erties necessary for direct denotation. Thus, they are used as prefixes [to verbs], or are dependently used; they lack case inflections and they lack gender and number.1“Profuse with oil\": The prefix pra intensifies the meaning and by telling us that the ingudi nuts were especially juicy suggests the great"},{"pageNumber":481,"pageContent":"466beauty of the hermitage.2 [Another commentator has made] the remark that “what is suggested is the strong craving of the hermit for this particular kind of nut.” This is wrong, for in the play this is the speech of the king, not of the hermit.3 So enough.1. A particle can only indicate which of several potential denotations is to be given to the independent, inflected words. See Väkyapadiya 2.189-206 and Abhyankar, Dictionary of Sanskrit Grammar, s.v. nipätoddyotakatva. But this sort of dyotakatva has nothing to do with rasa. 2. This remark is quoted verbatim, but without attribution, by Râghavabhatta in his commentary on the £äk. ad loc. 3. If the hermit had been speaking, the intensive expression might suggest his intense feelings about tripudi nuts. But the king has no use for tripudi oil. If he notices its profuseness it can only be to suggest the wealth and beauty of the forest products in the hermitage.[ § 3.16 h LA The use of two or three prefixes in a single word is not to be counted a fault if it is consistent with the suggestion of rasa, as it is in the passage:When darkness drops her garment, straightway the sun god, perceiving from on high the nakedness of creatures ...[Mayüra, Süryasataka 4ab]* 1or in the verse:So human is the guise in which you serve ...1. Perceiving their nakedness, the sun sends forth his rays to clothe them. The word samudvtksya (perceiving from on high) contains three pre­fixes. 2. Abhinava completes the verse, the source of which we have not found. It sounds very like the Bhägavatapuräna.

The second verse referred to runs as follows:So human is the guise in which you serve that the foolish seek to understand you, reasoning with inferences made according to their wit: you, incomprehensible even to the greatest yogis.The participle samupâcarantam is to be Understood as “acting toward (a = nearly, or in behalf of) in perfect (sam = samyanc) disguise (upa = upamsubrtvä).

Nowherecan I find a refuge of such people,for Fate, the scoundrel, prospering only thosewho hate the good, has brought them all to death.21. The remark applies to Kama as he offers to attack Siva. 2. The Kävyamälä ed. has svavapusi for sma vapusi. While manti svavapusi is more idomatic, one needs the sma to throw the first half of the verse into past time.

In the first of the two quotations the two particles aho and bata increase the suggestion of wonder. In the second quotation hä and dhik increase the suggestion of disenchantment. 11. Thus the first verse quoted suggests adbhutarasa, the second säntarasa. In the second verse there are actually four exclamations: hä, dhik, kastam, and bata. But kastam is not a nipäta, because it can be inflected.A The repetition of a word, too, if used for suggestiveness, some­times adds beauty, as in a verse like the following:A scoundrel aims at his own interest,puts his mind to deception, and brings forth wordsfilled with flattery and artifice.It is not that good men do not know his tricks; they know, but cannot bring themselves to disappoint him of a favor. 11. The verse, attributed in Subhâsitâvalî (271) to an otherwise unknown Bhagavattârârogya, is quoted by Mammata (7 ex. 312) and Hemacandra (AC 3, ex. 232). The repetition of the negative suggests that good men know these tricks very well. What the repetition of vidanti suggests is less clear. Abbinava takes it to suggest that they know still more. Perhaps he means that they are aware of the selfishness and deceitfulness of most men. Mammata and Hemacandra say that it excludes others from this knowledge. In any event the two repetitions seem to emphasize the wisdom and generosity of good men.L The foregoing brings up the subject1 of another form of repe­tition which may be suggestive: T he rep etitio n of a w ord, etc. The"},{"pageNumber":484,"pageContent":"term “word” is meant to imply the inclusion of sentences and other units also wherever they may be [repeated suggestively).“They know”: The suggestion is that they know everything else as well.

Shall they be safe while I still live?” what is suggested is [Bhlma’s] excessive wrath.3 [In the Vikramoruasïya] the repetition of the words “Lord of all mountains, have you seen that perfect beauty?” suggests [PurQravas’] excess of madness.41. The subject is incidental to the main topic, as the suggestions under this heading are ef the vastudhvani type, not of rasa. 2. The passsage here referred to (Ratn. 1.7 and ff.) exemplifies the kathodghäta type of pre­stavano, as Abhinava states in his ABh (BhNÉ Vol. 3, p. 94). The pre­stavano is the introduction or prelude to a play. Bharata (20.33) speaks of its five aiigäni (Abhinava interprets as “types\"), of which the kathodghä­ta is where a character enters by taking up a sentence that has been used in a conversation between the stage manager and one of the actors (20.35). As appears from other accounts of the kathodghäta and from the examples adduced, the sentence must be applied to one situation by the stage manager and repeated' with an application to the plot of the play by the entering character. In the Ratn. the stage manager has been comforting his wife, the chief actress, by assuring her that fate will bring back her daughter “from even the farthest island.” Yaugandharâyana, on the other hand, applies the words to the princess of Ceylon, whom he hopes to see married to King Udayana. He has just heard that she has been saved from shipwreck and brought to Ujjayinl.3. The passage here referred to forms the kathodghäta of the Venisamhära (Poona ed. 1.7-8; Madras ed. 1.9-10). The stage manager concludes his stanza of propitiation with the words “And may the sons of the Kuru king rest safe with all their followers” (svasthä bhavantu kururäjasutäh sabhrtyäh). There are then heard offstage the words of the wrathful Bhïma. The text differs in the different editions, but all contain the words svasthä bhavantu (or bhavanti) mayi jïvati “shall they rest safe while I still live?” The stage manager then retires and Bhïma enters with Sahadeva. 4. The reference is to the scene of PurQravas’ madness Vik. 4.51. He asks the mountain if it has seen his lost UrvasI: sarvaksitibhTtäm nätha, drstä sarvähgasundari... mayä vimhitä tvayä “Lord of all mountains, have you seen that perfect beauty lost by me?” He then listens to the echo of his words from the mountain caves. The echo repeats the words exactly but PurQravas construes them differently, as “0 lord§ 3.16 k L ] 469"},{"pageNumber":485,"pageContent":"470of kings, I have seen that perfect beauty lost by you.” In the ABh (BhNà Vol. 2, p. 458) Abhinava gives this passage as an example of the vithyanga called trigata. The “parts of a Vlthi” ( vithyanga) are often transposed to types of plays other than the Vithi proper; see Raghavan, Bhoja’s ÉP, p. 573. “That is to be known as trigata where because of similarity of sound many meanings are artificially construed” (BhNÉ 18.124, Vol. 2, p. 458). Commenting on Bharata, Abhinava says, “many meanings: sc. where the text is made out to consist of question and answer.” In the exemplar verse, the sentence that is first construed as a question is next construed as an answer. A simpler version of the same rhetorical trick is found in Ovid’s delightful story of Echo and Narcissus, Meta. 3.380ff. (dixerat, ecquis adest? et, adest, respondent Echo, etc.).[ § 3.16k LA A tense may be suggestive, as in the followiThe floods level out high and low; ever fewer come travelers over the roads, which soon wi impassible even to wishes.[Saifasaf 7.73]1Here the phrase “roads, which soon will be” the suffix of the word bhavisyanti (will be) by its expressing a particular time shows itself as a strengthening of the rasa (emotional content), for the sense of the verse contains rasa when it is viewed as stimulative of love-in-separation caused by the husband’s staying abroad.Just as it is here the suffix of a word that proves suggestive, it may elsewhere be the stem. For example:That house with crumbling walls, and now this palace stretching to the skies; that old decrepit cow, and here comes marching this troop of cloud-black elephants; that humble sound of pounding rice and this sweet singing of young damsels: wonder of wonders, that the days have raised the brahmin up to such prosperity!2"},{"pageNumber":486,"pageContent":"471In this stanza, it is the stem of the word divasaih (“days”) that is suggestive.3Pronouns, too, can be suggestive, as in the verse just quoted.4 And it is because he realized that the pronouns were suggestive that the poet did not use a word (directly expressive of contrast,] like kva (“how different!” ) . 5 Sensitive readers will be able to ferret out along these lines even other types of suggestive factors. All of these of course were included in [our] speaking of the suggestiveness of words, sentences, and style (cf. 3.2 K), but the subject is retraced with this subtlety of distinction for the purpose of instruction.1. Gangâdharabhatta’s first explanation is doubtless the correct one: “To a companion who has been trying to console her when the gentleman has not returned even at summer’s end, the lady speaks these words.\"’ The Sanskrit contains a pun that I have not rendered in English: manomtha: desire or, in its apparently literal sense, the chariot of the mind. 2. The verse is quoted by Mammata (10, ex. 517) as an example of the figure of speech paryâya. In his commentary on that passage Bhlmasena Dlksita identifies “the brahmin” as Sudäman. whom Krishna had enriched. Hemacandra also quotes the verse AC 1, ex. 91. 3. The commentators on Mammata point out that the worddivasaih, “days,\" as opposed to months, years, or time in general, suggests the rapidity with which the brahmin has gained his prosperity. This adds to the adbhutarasa (relish of wonder) of the verse. 4. The reference is to tadand idam (“that” house ... “this” palace, etc.). 5. E.g., kva dhenvr jaratikva ca karino ghanäbhäh.L A tense: A finite verb through its tense, number, käraka, and upagraha1 contains a package of meanings. Our author feels that we should investigate suggestiveness in such detail as to assign it, by positive and negative example, to one or another of these elements. A strengthening o f th e rasa: What is here suggested might be put thus: “If the time of the rains makes me tremble i its anticipation, what will it do when it arrives?”Apropos of the distinction of part and possessor of the part (e.g., of suffix and stem), he says, J u s t as, etc.; for the sense of the word “days” here suggests the utter improbability of the thing described.P ronouns too: he means, together with the stem of a word. That is to say, it is the pronoun as taken together with a word stem that is suggestive. Hence there is no tautology.2 Thus the pronoun tad (that) taken together with the stem of the word natabhitti (of crum­bling walls) suggests a house that is overrun with mice and miserable§ 3.161 L ]"},{"pageNumber":487,"pageContent":"472in every way. For if the word “that” had been used alone [to qualify the word “house”], one might suppose the house to have been very prosperous; while if the word “of crumbling walls” were used [without the pronoun “that”], the extreme misery of the place would not have been suggested. The same reasoning applies to “that cow,” etc. In all such cases the word “that” suggests something that one remem­bers and is to be distinguished, as previously stated, from the “that\" that is correlative with “which.” 3 Thus it is by such words as tad and idam* (“that” and “this”), through their suggesting the contradictions between [the speaker’s] memory and his present experience, that the stimulants of wonder are brought together. For if the words tad and idam were omitted, the images would not hold together. Thus we may take it that the very heart [of the suggestiveness or charm of the verse] lies in these portions, tad and idam.5 This double combination [of sug­gestive factors] implies that we may have triple combinations.6 Thus by using a marker and a table of elements,7 we may say that the varieties [of suggestive factors] are endless, as our author is about to state in the passage even o th er types, etc. As this [analysis] has been spread over many [pages], he draws it together, lest the student have missed the point, withAll of these, etc. At the same time, he reminds us of the purpose that has led to this breadth of analysis, with the words, [the subject is retraced] w ith this subtlety of distinction [for the purposes of instruction]. 11. A verb has agent or object or agent-object käraka as it is active, passive, or reflexive in meaning. Upagraha refers to the choice of parasmai- pada or âtmanepada endings. This choice may tell whether the verb denotes action that benefits (or affects) the agent, or action that benefits someone else. 2. If the stem of a word were already suggestive of something, there would be no need of a pronoun to suggest the same thing. 3. See 3.4 a L and our note 6 on that passage. One might put the matter as follows. In expressions such as “O those eyes!” “Ah that house,” the pronoun takes the deictic construction (as in “those eyes are brown,” “that house is miserable\"), not the anaphoric (as in “that house which stands on the hillside”). The reason is obvious: one may point to something in one’s memory as well as to something in the outer world. 4. “Such words” (ädt): the òdi refers to the pronoun etad used in the second line of the verse. 5.

But we answered this objection when we spoke of the suggestiveness of words [cf. 3.1 j above]. Moreover, even if the rasas are suggested by particular [sentence-] meanings, since these meanings cannot arise in the absence of suggestive words, a thorough knowledge of the nature of suggestors, dividing them up in the manner shown above, cannot fail to be useful. Furthermore, the beauty of particular words, as it has elsewhere1 been shown with careful distinctions, must be understood to be wholly contingent on their suggestiveness.Even where suggestiveness does not appear in some passage [that we are] now [reading], if it contains words in which we once saw beauty in a suggestive passage in some other work, we will find by force of habit the same beauty in those words now taken out of the context that they had in the flow [of that former work].2 How else would there be any difference in the beauty of words of which the denotative sense is the same?3 If it be objected that the difference is other than in suggestive­ness, being something that is felt only by sensitive readers (sahrdaya), we may ask what it means to be a sensitive reader. Is the prerequisite the recognition of certain conventions that apply to poetry and that bear no relation to rasa and bhäva? Or is it a broad and subtle knowl­edge of the nature of poetry as consisting in rasa, bhäva and the like? On the former alternative there would be no criterion for the beauty of particular words set up as beautiful by such readers, for one could perfectly well set up a different set of words by a different convention. But on the second alternative, being a sensitive reader amounts simply to having a knowledge of rusa.4 Now the peculiar property of words [sc., the property that renders them beautiful] that is felt by senitive readers of this sort is the natural power such words have to transmit rasa; and so the primary beauty of these words is based on their sug­gestiveness. The only peculiar beauty that words can have when used denotatively is clarity when their beauty depends on meaning, or, when it is not dependent on meaning, alliteration, etc."},{"pageNumber":489,"pageContent":"4741. According to Abhinava “elsewhere” here refers to Udbhata’s Bhämaha- vivarana,. The remains of what may be this work, edited by R. Gnoli, are not sufficient for us to discover what Udbhata said on this subject, but he is not likely to have attributed the beauty of words to their suggestiveness. What we have here in Änandavardhana is likely to be a criticism to the effect that in spite of what Udbhata said on the subject, the real cause of a word’s beauty is its suggestiveness. 2. This complicated sentence furnishes a persuasive argument against the critic who might object: “How can the beauty of a word be contingent on its suggestion when some words are beautiful everywhere they are used, even in expository prose?” The answer is that such words carry over their suggestions from other contexts. 3. Abhinava offers the example of tatam, tatah, and tati, all meaning river-bank or shore, of which he finds only the last word beautiful. In English I would call “cellar” beautiful as opposed to “basement.\" The former suggests to me (D. I.) the cool milk and stored apples of my childhood, the latter the oil furnace and cast-off ironware of modern times. 4. (J. M.) Ànanda's argument here is not strong, although his objection to other critics of his day may well be taken. He argues that either one admits that rasa is the essence of poetry, or one does not. If one does not, then there is no objective basis for asserting that such and such is beautiful in poetry and such and such is not, for a different critic will hold a different view. Whereas if one believes in rasa, then rasa becomes the touchstone of beauty in poetry. But this is a valid argument only if one already accepts rasa. An opponent could argue in precisely the same manner, substituting some other criterion in place of rasa. If one were to put forward vakwkti or svabhävokti as the essence of poetry, one would in no less degree have a standard by which to judge any given work. To do Änanda justice, however, one must consider that at the time he wrote his work, no one had come forward with a comprehensive theory of poetics that allowed all the elements within literature to fall into place. Änanda with his theory of rasa and dhvani was the first to do this. So if we interpret his words here as an objection to assertions that such and such elements in poetry are beautiful without a coherent theory to underlie such statements, we may fairly agree with him.[ § 3.16 m AL It m ay be objected: The objection has already been re­solved [at 3.1 j A), but is here brought up in order to recall it to the reader’s attention and to add something new. W e answ ered: We have already said that denotativeness is not so necessary to the operation of suggestion that a non-denotative element may not be suggestive. 1 But when there is suggestiveness of rasa in a word, the word is not,2 as is a song, etc., without a linguistic operation toward that end. Rather,"},{"pageNumber":490,"pageContent":"such a word is suggestive in the highest sense. That is the meaning; and it has been explained by us under Chapter One.3In order to show that this [doctrine] is no new invention on his part our author proceeds with F urtherm ore th e beauty of particular w ords, etc. Elsewhere: viz., in the Bhämahavivarana.* W ith care­ful distinctions: Where Udbhata says that the words sraj (garland) and candana (sandalwood) are beautiful in the erotic but not in the gruesome (bibhatsa), he is making a distinction based on rasa. We have already stated5 that it is the suggestive force only of a word that makes for rasa.Even w here: Such words as sraj and candana, even when they are at that time in a passage that lacks any suggestion of the erotic, etc., will still have the power to convey a meaning that has become beautiful by a sort of fragrance from our frequent experience of their suggestive power. For example, in tati täram tämyati (“the shoreline suffers sharply”) the man of taste (sahrdaya) rejects the masculine and neuter forms and uses the feminine tati on the principle that “even a name is sweet by being feminine.” 6 Or as in the following verse of my teacher Bhattenduräja, that prince of scholars, poets, and sensitive critics:§ 3.16 m L] 475Even if he bore not his water-lily colored stigma, even if, by merit gained in other births, he might assume those tempting graces that alone win all our wonder,still, could the moon have, could he ever have, the lovely softness of her cheek?For here the words indivara, laksma, vismaya, suhrd, vilâsa, nâma, parinâma, komala, etc., all of which we have seen elsewhere to be sug­gestive of snigära, bring to the verse the highest degree of beauty.7That this [basis of verbal beauty in suggestiveness] must be admit­ted he states in the words How else, etc. As one cannot claim that this [difference in the beauty of words] is not felt, he says by sensitive readers, etc. A different set: for how could there be any criterion if the convention depended on unregulated individual whim?

Both the quotation and the reason given for the choice of words seem to be taken from some earlier author (Udbhata?), for they both appear in Kuntaka’s Vakrokti- jivita (2.22, ex. 79), which gives the verse from which the quotation comes as follows (I emend the last word from subhagä to svbhagah):yatheyam grismosmavyatikaravatï pdndurabhidd mukhodbhinnamldndnalataralavallltkualayd tati täram tämyaty atisasiyasä ko ’pi jaladas tathä manye bhävi bhuvanavalayäkräntisubhagahI do not know what bhidä means, but for the rest, the stanza may be rendered as follows.The shoreline suffers sharply in the summer heat, pale and with her foliage trembling under the exhausted breezes of her sighs: from which I guess that soon some lucky cloud will rob the moon of his white glory and will lie victorious on this bracelet of the earth.The original choice of tati here, it seems to me, had little to do with the inherent beauty of the word. The shore must be made feminine to fit with all the other suggestions of a lady and her lover. Just as a lady pines in her lover’s absence, stirring the curls above her forehead with the sighs from her mouth, just so the shore in the summer heat. And the black cloud, defeating the white moon in combat and thereby overcoming the earth, will be blessed with the joy of physically “overcoming” or lying upon his beloved. The sight of a shoreline just before the advent of the monsoon has put the poet in mind of these suggestions. But the odd alliterating phrase tati täram tâmyatijtïcks in the mind. Udbhata or some other ancient critic must have explained its haunting beauty by the ‘ feminine” charm of the word tati. Of course to one who remembers the verse, the word tati even in other contexts may retain some of the charm it has in this verse. 7. Abhinava, it seems to me, here goes too far.

However, it would follow by a small inference that the inbhävas of the two rasas must likewise be contra­dictory. 3. By bhäva Ananda certainly meant sthäyibhäva, for such is his regular usage. Nowhere does he use the simple word to mean vyabhicäribhäva. But Abhinava wishes to furnish a reason for Änanda’s abbreviating the full expression (sthäyibhäva) in this way. His explanation is that if one removes the sthäyibhäva from sänta and places it in srngära, it must there become a vyabhicäribhäva. Otherwise there would not be simply obstruction to irngära: srngära would cease and éânta would take over. Thus, according to Abhinava, Änanda used the neutral term bhäva because he wished to cover that which is a sthäyibhäva in the obstructive rasa and at the same time a vyabhicäri­bhäva in the rasa that is being obstructed. 4.

For the vyabhicäribhävas of sântarasa see Abh. Vol. 1, p. 340, line 4 and Masson and Patwardhan’s Éântarasa, p. 139.

Badarinâth âarmà (Haridas ed. p. 358) explains the force of the passage thus: devapräyatvakathanena näyakasya dhirodättatayä 'nucitopanyäsaparän- mukhasilatä sücyate \"by speaking of his being ‘almost a god’ it is indicated that the hero is of the ‘firm and noble’ type and should be averse to the mention of anything inappropriate.” 3. dhvanipratipädanamäträbhinivesa: The word mäträ is here used in its sense of extension (“all”), not restriction (“only\"). Examples of this use are M.Bh. 13.22.3 dyäväprthivimätraisä kämyä “this desire exists throughout all heaven and earth.\" Käs. on Pin. 3.2.106 linmätrasya yathä syät “so that [the substitution] may apply to all cases of lit.\" This seems to be the way that Abhinava understood the word here.[ § 3.18-19 b AL O f an o th er action: as in the Fourth Act of the Vatsaräja- carita (= Ratnâvalï], where Vijayavarman gives his report, without even a mention of RatnavaEPs name. 1By the two words a t th a t (api tävat), which show that such a scene is really out of the question for Duryodhana, he hints at the fact that the Second Act of the Venisamhära is the example he has in mind. That is why he goes on to say d riven o u t of his senses by fate. The passage here referred to was mentioned earlier (3.10-14 f A) as an example of how not to compose a sandhyanga. T he ch aracter in the tale: here he means the villain [Duryodhana].On this account: viz., because the construction of rasa is the chief business of a poet and if he gives his chief attention to narrating the"},{"pageNumber":498,"pageContent":"483plot, he will construct rasas and bhävas that “lack a proper relation between what should be predominant and what subordinate.” that is to say, where no consideration has been given to the relation of major and minor. In this way he will stumble and all sorts of faults will arise; that is the sense. W ith every possible description of dhva n i: What he has in mind is that the mere instance of a suggested sense is of no importance. To become infatuated [with describing] all such instances would be like examining crows’ teeth.21. There can be no doubt that by Vatsaräjacarita Abhinava is referring to what we now know as the Ratnävaii by King Harsa, for in its Fourth Act just such an interruption occurs. The king and the VidOsaka have been talking about the disappearance of Sägarikä (RatnävaE), whom the king yearns to meet with. Suddenly Vijayavarman is brought on stage and gives a long account of his uncle’s victory over the King of Kosala. We should probably read vijayavarrrumo in place of vijayavarma in compound, which breaks the rule of syntax that the subordinate member of a compound should not be construed with a word outside the compound. 2. Examining crows’ teeth is a proverbially useless endeavor because a crow has no teeth. J. M. adduces a popular verse: käkasya kati vä dantä mesasyändam kiyatpalam / gardabhe kati romàni vyarthaivaisä vicäranä // The third of these proverbial follies would seem to offer a more appropriate nyäya here. Describing every instance or type of dhvani would be useless because there would be so many and most of them poetically insignificant.§ 3.18-19 c A ]3.18-19 cA [The fifth type of obstruction.] And here is what we must regard as another cause of obstructing the rasa, namely that one should keep flashing it after it has reached full maturity. For a rasa, after its set of causes (i.e., vibhävas, anubhävas, and vyabhicäribhävas) has brought it to maturity and it has then been enjoyed, will wilt like a flower if it is then constantly handled.[The sixth type of obstruction.] Likewise any impropriety of vrtti, that is, behavior (vyavahâra), can only be obstructive to a rasa, ss, for example, if a certain lady were to state her desire of sexual enjoy­ment to the hero without the use of appropriate periphrasis. Or we"},{"pageNumber":499,"pageContent":"484may take uvrttin to refer to the modes of speech and action, known to Bharata, such as the kaiéikî (the graceful mode), etc. , 1 or to the style of compounding and alliteration, such as the upanägarikä, known in other works on poetics.2 Any impropriety in such a vrtti, that is, its use in the wrong place, is a cause of obstructing the rasa. In order to avoid these obstructions to the rasa and others along the same line that he may discover by himself, a good poet must be attentive. The following verses will give support to our position.The principal object of the work of poets are the rasas, (6/iävas,] and the like. In constructing them he must be constantly on guard.A work that lacks rasa is a deep reproach to a poet. By it he ceases to be a poet and is forgotten by others.It is true that the ancient poets gained fame without chaining their lan­guage [to rules]. But a wise man will not abandon our system in reliance on them.The system that we have set forth is not alien to the aims that were held by the great masters of poetry, beginning with VâlmîTâ and Vyäsa.[ § 3.18-19 c A1. BhNÉ 20.8ff; see above 3.6 g L and footnote 1. 2. To keep kävyä-lankäräntaraprasiddhänäm parallel with bharataprasiddhänäm, we must take the phrase kävyälaiikära to refer to a book, such as Udbhata’s Kävyälankära- särasangraha, rather than to “poetic figures of speech.” Udbhata does use the word vrtti to refer to such styles as the upanägarikä; see 1.1 a A, note 4. Only the last of the Vrtti's three explanations of vrttyanaucityam agrees with the way in which the Vrtti has used the similar phrase vrttyaucityam (3.7 a A and note 2; 3.16f A and note 1). The fact that the Vrtti here gives three explanations has been used as an argument in favor of dual authorship of Kärikäs and Vrtti (Kane HSP p. 181), as though the Vrttikära had not been certain of the Kärikä’s meaning. But it is not unusual for an author to elicit from his own words as wide a scope as their meaning will bear.L He explains the Kärikä passage vrttyanaucityam eva ca (“and impropriety of style”) in several ways. By likewise he is glossing the word “and” (ca) in the Kärikä; and by the word only (eva) in “can only be obstructive to a rasa” he shows that the order of the words is reversed in the Kärikä, for what the Kärikä means is vrttyanaucityam ca rasasya virodhäya eva.

Abhinava is quoting from Kalidasa, KumSam. 5.75.§ 3.20 A ]K But when the intended rasa has been firmly established, there is no fault in mentioning these obstructive factors if they are stopped short, or if they are brought into a subordinate role.A But when the intended rasa has been brought to maturity by its set of causes (i.e., vibhävas, anubhâvas, and vyabhicâribhàvas), there is no fault in the mention of obstructive factors, that is, elements belonging to an obstructive rasa, if they are-stopped short, or if they are brought into a subordinate role. For obstructive factors are stopped short only when they can be overcome, not otherwise; and in that case their mention serves to magnify the intended rasa And when such factors are brought into a subordinate state their obstructiveness ceases."},{"pageNumber":501,"pageContent":"486That such factors should become subordinate may be due to their very nature; or it may be due to some artificially imposed property. To begin with those which become subordinate by their own nature, there is no obstruction at all in mentioning such factors; as, for example, in love-in-separation, the mention of such states as physical illness which are subordinate to this rasa (as being its vyabhicârins, although they are also elements of the obstructive rasa tragedy (AarTina) ] .1 But it is only of such [obstructive factors] as are subordinate to the intended rasa that the mention is without fault, not of such as are not subordinate.2Death,3 while it can form a subordinate element (in love-in-separa­tion], is an element the use of which is inadvisable, because if the human receptacle of the rasa is cut off, the rasa itself will be cut off. One should not argue that the tragic will thereby be increased, because tragedy is not what is here aimed at and what is aimed at will be cut off. Only where we are actually aiming at the tragic will death prove unobstructive. Or we may admit the use of death to be occasionally not entirely obstructive in srngära if there is a possibility of revival in a short space of time. But if the revival occurs only after a long time, the force of the rasa will be lost in the interim. Accordingly, a poet, who is chiefly concerned with constructing a rasa, should avoid such a element in his plot.1. The erotic embodies the largest set of transient (and therefore subordi­nate) states of any of the rasas. BhNÉ Vol. 1, p. 306, specifies that irrigarti is capable of all the vyabhicäribhävas except älasya (laziness; Abhinava restricts the word so as to exclude languor), augrya (cruelty), and jugupsä (disgust). In love-in-separation the lovers can become physically ill, a state that is also found in the obstructive rasa tragedy (fcanina). What Änanda is telling us is that to introduce this factor of illness (vyädhi), which is prima facie an ele­ment belonging to an obstructive rasa, into vipralambhasrngâra, is not a fault because illness by its very nature can be subordinate (as a vyabhicâribhâva) to srngära. 2. There are only three of these (see previous footnote). To introduce älasya, augrya, or jugupsä into vipralambhasrngâra will indeed be obstructive because these states cannot naturally be subordinated to the in­tended rasa. 3. Death (marana) is specifically included by Bharata among the vyabhicäribhävas of srngära, because one can die of love.[ § 3.20 AL [Comment on the Kärikä] Having thus laid down a general rule for avoiding obstructive elements, he states an exception1 within a li ited area: B ut w hen th e intended rasa, etc. If th ey are"},{"pageNumber":502,"pageContent":"487stopped short: The meaning is [that they may be introduced] with the intention of stopping them short or with the intention of making making them subordinate. Acchala means “without fault.”[Comment on the Vrtti.} He explains the intention of stopping them short by saying, For [obstructive factors] are stopped short, etc. He explains the intention of subordinating such factors in two ways. Of these he first describes the natural way: which are su bordinate to this, etc. Now tragedy (karwia), by its being without hope of relief (nirapeksabhäva), is obstructive to love-in-separation, which contains am element of hope (säpeksabhäva)2 and physical illness and the like are certainly seen as its factors. O f such [factors the mention is without fault], for while they occur in tragedy and they alone occur there, they also occur in srngära, but not only they.3 O f such as are not subordinate: such as laziness, cruelty and disgust.4W hile it can form a su b o rd in ate elem ent: because it has been said that all the vyabhicärins [except the three mentioned above] are found in srrigära-, our author is aware of this. But if the receptacle, tha£ is, the man or the woman who forms the base, is destroyed, then love (rati) will be cut off because it stands in each of them in the form of the illusion that the other is their all in all in life.W h at is here aim ed at: viz., love-in-separation. A ctually aim ­ing at: i.e., when that is the matter in hand. But at this rate the doctrine that all the vyabhicärins exist in srngära will be destroyed. Anticipating this objection, he says, O r we m ay adm it, etc. Death may serve as a vyabhicärin (subordinate state) of srngära in those cases where the death, being of brief duration, is not the point on which our apprehension comes to rest.O ccasionally: that is, when a poet is sldlful enough to accomplish such a turn. For example:Leaving his mortal body at the junctionof Ganges and Sarayü and being thusadmitted into everlasting life,he met once more with his beloved queen,now of fairer form than ever, and enjoyed her lovein the pleasure halls of Indra’s paradise.[Kälidäsa, Raghuvamsa 8.95]6In this passage death is clearly subordinated to physical love (rati). And because it is to be subordinated, this wise poet has not allowed death a foothold [in our memory], mentioning it merely in the non­predicative part of the sentence.7 If he had given it a foothold, the§ 3.20 L ]"},{"pageNumber":503,"pageContent":"result would certainly be to produce sorrow, no matter how short the period of time before reunion.But now, can it be with reference to what sensitive critics would consider a long time that death is stated to be subordinate whenever it is followed “in no long time” by reunion? At this rate, since intelligent persons when they hear of the machinations of Yaugandharäyana and his accomplices, will not believe that Väsavadattä has really died at all, there could be no tragedy in the Täpasavatsaräja. So enough of this side issue and let us take “long time” to mean rather the furnishing of a foothold [for our memory to dwell on].8Here ends the explanation of natural subordination. As one may infer the nature of artificially imposed subordination by its being contrary to natural, he does not explain it in so many words [although he will give examples of it].1. pratiprasava: lit., a reviving of the permission that naturally obtained before the prohibiton was made. The term is taken from the grammarians. 2. The terms säpeksabhäva and nirapeksabhäva are taken from Bharata (BhNÉ Vol. 1, p. 309). where they are used to distinguish vipralambhaérngàra from karuna. Love-in-separation is always a temporary form of rasa. It looks toward and hopes for and is succeeded by love-in-union. Tragedy (karuna) does not have this apeksä, this relativity, or this ulterior state to which to look forward. The two rasas being thus distinguished, the question arises how we are made aware of the apeksä or its lack. Does the difference lie in the perceived experience of the character portrayed, or in the reader’s knowldge (his knowledge, for example, of how the story will end), or in the poet’s emphasis? Abhinava will raise this interesting question and will favor the last of these explanations. 3. Illness and other painful factors (e.g., discouragement, weariness, despair) are the only vyabhicäribhävas of karuna (see BhNÉ Vol. 1, p. 317), so they certainly belong to karuna. But they are also vyabhicäribhävas of srngärn and therefore subordinate to it also. The only difference is that they are not the exclusive subordinates of srngära, which contains pleasurable factors also. 4. Âlasya and ugratä are given in the list of vyabhicäribhävas BhNÉ 6.18 and 20. Jugupsä is listed as the sthäyibhäva of bïbhatsâ (BhNÉ 6.17). As Bharata says that érngâra possesses all the vyabhicärins except these three (Voi. 1, p. 306), Abhinava in his Abh. infers that the sthäyibhävas (when outside their proper rasa) may act as vyabhicärins. 5. visräntipadabandha: Hemacandra, who borrows largely from this passage of the Locano, renders the term as pratxtiviäräntisthänatva (Parekh ed., p. 110, lines 19-20; KM ed., p. 85, line 3 from bottom). 6.

There is no need to emend, as is commonly done, to488 [ § 3.20 L"},{"pageNumber":504,"pageContent":"489adhikatararucä. Kälidäsa elsewhere uses the word catara to mean “beautiful.” In Ragh. 9.47 Mallinätha glosses it by upabhogaksama, which would do very well here also. 7. The tdtparya or final purport of a sentence, that on which our apprehension comes to rest (insränti), is the vidheya, approximately translatable as predicate. The vidheya is the new information which the sentence gives us as opposed to the uddesya or anuvdda, the matter already known, about which this new information is stated. What Abhinava here means is that Kälidäsa has not written in such form as “And then King Aja died,” in which case our mind would come to rest on the unhappy event of his death. Rather, his words have taken the form, “King Aja, having died and been rebom in heaven, enjoyed the love of his queen.\" Here the tdtparya, the portion of the sentence that leaves its impression on the mind, is concerned with love, not death. 8. Änanda's doctrine that death in love-in-separation must be of short duration is unpalatable to Abhinava because if it means short in the opinion of the audience, any verse dealing with Aja’s death would qualify. There would be no need for skill on the part of the poet, as the audience can guess from what preceeds (cf. Ragh. 8.93) that Aja will be shortly reunited with IndumatT; while in the Tdpasavatsardja the audience will not even believe in the death of Väsavadattä at all. As usual, instead of changing Änanda’s doctrine Abhinava reinterprets it. A “death of long duration” is to be taken as a death so described, by being placed in the predicate or by being made in some other way predominant over srngdra, etc., as to linger in the memory.§ 3.20 a A ]A Of these [types], an example of the mention, when the in­tended rasa has been firmly established, of obstructive elements, a mention without fault because they are stopped short, is the following:How can a king of the Lunar Dynasty do a forbidden deed?May I see her once again!I have learned the scriptures in order to abstain from sin.Even in anger her face was lovely.What will the wise and sinless say?One could not find her even in a dream.My heart, come to your senses!But what blessed man will drink her lower lip? * 1"},{"pageNumber":505,"pageContent":"490Another example would be the lecture [in the Kädambari],2 given by the other young ascetic to Pundarlka who has fallen deeply in love with Mahäsvetä.1. The verse was quoted above by Abhinava. See 2.3 L and footnote 10 thereon. 2. The passage begins on p. 313 of the NSP ed. of the Kädambari (Peterson’s ed., p. 146) with the words sakhe Pundarika, naitad anurùpam bhavatah.[ § 3.20a AL Having thus explained the three types [of situation where ob­structive elements may be mentioned], he illustrates them in the order [of his presentation]: O f these. “How can a king,” etc. Here com­punction is stopped short by longing, intelligence by memory, doubt by despair, and firmness by anxiety. We have already said this toward the beginning of Chapter Two. T he o th er [young ascetic]: What he has in mind is that the strength of [Pundarlka’s] passion is expressed by its proving unshakable even when disenchantment (vairâgya) and the vibhävas of an obstructive rasa [viz., éânta] are particularized.A There is no fault in the natural subordination [of an obstruc­tive element], in such a verse as:The cloud serpents pour forth water pour forth venomwhich brings to ladies whose husbands are away a sudden dizziness, a listlessness and weariness of heart, then fainting, darkness, emaciation, death. 1There is likewise no obstruction where [the subordination is] arti dally imposed, as in “Your pale emaciated [face],” etc., orIn anger she has bound him tightly in the noose of her soft arms.2"},{"pageNumber":506,"pageContent":"1. The verse has already been quoted under 2.18-19e. Dizziness, fainting, etc., are vyabhicäribhävas of koruna but also of vipralambhaérngâra. Appar­ently listlessness of heart (alasahrdayatä) is regarded as diffent from älasya; see above, 3.20 a A, note 1. 2. For the first quotation see Locano, below; forthe second, see above, 2.18-19 e A.§ 3.20b L ]L Artificially imposed: one must supply “subordination.” the verse,Your pale emaciated face,your surfeited breastand your listless limbs, my gentle friend,proclaim a terminal maladyin your heart. 1the disease, as belonging to tragedy, is imposed by the trick of a double meaning.[Comment on the verse “in anger,” etc.) The referents of “in anger,” “has bound,\" “is struck,” are symptoms (anvbhävas) of the cruel (rau- dra) which have been imposed by metaphor on, and have been made subordinate to, [the erotic] because they are not fully carried out [in their proper sphere]. This was spoken of above in connection with never oversustaining [a figure of speech; cf. 2.18-19 K).. 1. The word ksetriya in ksetriyarogam (terminal malady) is noticed byPanini 5.2.92, who says that it denotees that [disease] which is curable only in another body, that is, in the next life; in other words, a terminal malady. But the context of the present verse: the vocative sakhi “my female friend\" and the pun in hrdayam sarasam (a heart that has received too much nourishment from eating strong foods or a heart that is filled with passion) give to “terminal malady’ a second meaning, viz., “a fatal passion.” Thus the words which in a straightforward sense denote a tragic situation are playfully adapted to love-in-separation. Mammata, who is more scholastic and less imaginative than Änanda, quotes the verse twice: once to exemplify the figure of speech tidyayogitä (10, ex. 460), in which he is scholastically correct, and once (7, ex. 332) in order to reprove Änanda. There is no obstnictive factor here, Mammata says, because a sickness is a natural state of love-in-separation. He thus misses the point of the verse, which Änanda clearly saw. The “terminal malady” is entirely imaginary. It has been superimposed (samöropita) on the ordinary yearning of unrequited love in order to sharpen our visualization of the pangs of that love. Thus an element of an obstructive rasa (tragedy) has"},{"pageNumber":507,"pageContent":"492been artificially created and then subordinated to the intended rasa (vipra- lambhasrngâra). I see no reason to object to Änanda’s distinction between artificial (fanciful) and natural subordination.[ § 3.20 b LA There is also another method of achieving subordination. Two rasas or bhävas which are mutually obstructive may become subordi­nated to the single main sense of the sentence, as that is the true subject matter (adhikära); and there will be no fault of obstruction here. An example has been given in the verse “The women of the Triple City wept,” etc. 1 How can we say that there is no obstruction here? Because the two [mutually obstructive elements] are both placed in subordination to a third. And if it be asked how the obstruction ceases even if the two obstructive elements are subordinated to a third, our answer is that the fault of obstruction occurs when the obstructive elements are placed in the predicate, not when they are contained in the subject. For example:“Come here! Go!Lie down! Get up!Speak! Be still!”Such is the way that the rich play with menwho are bitten by the demon of hope.[Näräyana, Hitopadeéa p. 49]a In this verse there is no obstruction (i.e., no contradiction of sense) because the contradictory elements are mentioned in the subject.3 The same holds of the verse on the women of the Triple City. For in that verse the love-in-separation due to jealousy and the element of tragedy4 are not predicated; because the overall sentence meaning is the extraor­dinary power of the enemy of the Triple City (viz., £iva) and becausethese two elements are subordinated to that. __And it cannot be claimed that distinctions of subject and predicate do not apply to the rasas, for it is admitted that the rasas are a sentence meaning and the distinction of subject and predicate that applies to the directly denoted sentence meaning must apply also to the rasas that are suggested by those direct meanings. Even those critics who"},{"pageNumber":508,"pageContent":"493deny that the rasas, etc., are, without mediation, the meaning of a poem, must at least admit that they derive from its meaning. So, even at that, there would be no obstruction in the verse.5Again, there is no obstruction because the apprehension of a specific emotion (bhäva) arises from the predicate portion of the sentence, that portion being helped to achieve its result by elements of rasa caused by the subject portion of the sentence; for it is seen in the world that a specific result can arise from a cause that is helped out by mutually obstructive auxiliaries.6 It is obstriictive (contradictory) for a single cause at one and the same time to bring about mutually obstructive results, but not for it to have mutually obstructive auxiliaries.If it be asked how the actor can represent on the stage such mutually obstructive elements, the answer is that he will proceed just as he does in representing comparable denoted (as opposed to suggested) elements in a subject. In this way the obstructiveness in the verse is explained away by making use of the distinction of subject and predicate.§ 3.20 c A ]1. See 2.5 c A, above, where the veise was quoted as an example of rasavadalaiikära. In the discussion under the present Kärikä Änanda will offer two interpretations. The first, according to which the erotic and tragic elements of the verse are subordinated to a predication of God’s power, which in turn produces a f ling (bhäva) of love of God, is compatible with the Chapter Two explanation of the erotic and tragic elements as rasavadalahkäm. The second explanation (3.20d) finds the tragic to be the most moving element in the verse and treats the verse as an example of karunamsa. 2. Quite possibly the verse is borrowed by Näräyana, as are many other verses of the Hitopadesa. It is attributed to Vyäsa by the author of the Subhäsitävali (3168), by whose time it was well enough known to be used in the game of samasyäpürana (see SubhA. 1228). Mammata (7, ex. 339) and Hemacandra (AC 3.195, Parikh p. 165) quote it, doubtless taking it from Änanda. The usefulness of the verse to the present discussion is that its contradictions are väcya, directly denoted rather than suggested, and so are obvious, as is their relation to the predicate. Änanda will explain the contradictory suggestions of the verse of the women of the Triple City by analogy with this simpler example.3. See above, 3.20 L, note 7. Änanda is making use of MTmämsä doctrine, for an explanation of which see Mimämsänyäyaprakäsa of Äpadeva, BORI 1937, p. 39 and Kunjunni Raja Indian Theories of Meaning, pp. 184-185. The Mlmämsä distinction between permissible contradiction in the subject and impermissible contradiction in the predicate is a valid distinction and accordingly is found in other systems of logic. A modem Western example would be: “John is in Boston and John is in Cambridge” is self-contradictory"},{"pageNumber":509,"pageContent":"494and therefore false. “‘John is in Boston and John is in Cambridge’ is self­contradictory\" is not self-contradictory and is true. 4. Änanda here speaks of a “tragic element” (karunavaatu) rather than a tragic rasa because rasa derives from the sentence meaning. The rasa (or more strictly speaking, bhäva) of the verse, as Ananda is now interpreting it, is a feeling of the power of God. The tragic element lies in the subject and does not achieve the state of rasa. Later he will offer a different interpretation, by which the tragic can be regarded as the rasa of the verse. 5. Änanda takes into account two opinions and shows that by either of them there need be no contradiction of rasas in the verse on the women of the TViple City. According to the first opinion, a rasa is the kävyärtha, the overall meaning of the poem. It differs from the väcyärtha (the directly denoted meaning) by being vyangya, not väcya. But just as the denoted sentence meaning derives from the predicate, not the subject, so also the suggested sentence meaning or rasa. The second opinion holds that a rasa is not directly the suggested meaning of the poem but is caused or brought about by the suggested meaning of the poem, i.e., by the bhävas, vibhävas, etc., that the poem suggests. Here too the rasa must derive from a meaning that is expressed in the predicate, not the subject. 6. For example, cooked rice arises from the raw rice grains as helped out by the mutually obstructive properties of coldness and heat belonging respectively to the water ' the pot and the fire on the hearth.[ § 3.20 c AL A no th er m ethod: this is the fourth method [of avoiding obstruction). In the previous [two methods] an element of an obstruc­tive rasa became subordinate to the rasa in hand, whereas now the elements of two mutually obstructive rasas become subordinate to a third: this is the difference. T h e women of th e Triple C ity: we have explained the verse under 2.5 c.Now it may be objected that a thing’s nature does not change by its being subordinated to something else and the obstruction that a thing presents is occasioned by its nature. With this in mind he says, A nd if it be asked, etc. T he two obstructive elem ents: that is, ob­structive in their very nature; the adjective furnishes the reason [for the objector’s view that the obstruction will not cease). O ur answ er is: What he has in mind here is that the obstruction or lack of obstruction in things occurs as they fall into particular causal combinations and not simply from their inherent natures, as may be seen by the absence of obstruction between hot and cold [in certain causal combinations] .1In th e predicate: as in “Do it! Don’t do it!” By the word “pred­icate” he is saying that both actions are taken as predominant at the same time.2 That is why the Mfmämsakas (väkyavidah) say that the"},{"pageNumber":510,"pageContent":"495two Vedic statements with mutually obstructive predicates: “They use the sodasin cup in the Atirätra” and “They do not use the sodaéin cup in the Atirätra” amount to a prescribing of option.3In th e subject: i.e., when they are subordinate to something else. Since the statement of these mutually obstructive (contradictory) ele­ments is subordinate to the portion [of the sentence that asserts the] playing [of rich men], it is a statement of elements which are made dependent [and give up their natural opposition] by their looking up to something else, like two feuding opponents standing in the presence of their king. It is thus a statement of expressions which, as we hear them follow one upon the other, do not allow our minds to rest on the nature of the things expressed, much less to worry about the mutual relation among those things by which contradiction could arise. 4 [The] only [effect of the contradiction is that] the connection that might later be inferred between them from the sentence syntax by the principle dis­cussed in the Arunâdhikarana, fails to be made because of their mutual obstruction. 5An objection arises. To predicate is to state something as the chief or predominant element of a sentence. If something is expressed as not predominant, it is in the subject. But you [proponents of dhvani] will not allow a rasa to be stated [i.e., directly denoted] at all. Anticipating this objection, our author says, A nd it cannot b e cla im ed , etc. What he means is that predicate and subject axe concepts depending solely on predominance and non-predominance and they apply to what is suggested as well as to what is stated. It has been said that a rasa when it is presented as predominant is the final sense of a poetic sentence. So when a suggested sense appears as non-predominant, it stands to reason that the rasa will be in the subject. Or, we may say that the rasa is placed in the subject when it is suggested by vibkävas and the like which stand in the subject. This is what he states in saying [the distinction of su b ject and predicate th a t appHes directly denoted) sentence m eaning, etc.Or, let us not speak of contradictory elements being introduced y being treated as the subject; they can be introduced as auxiliaries. In-this way there is no difficulty in finding a logically sound relation of predominant and subordinate. He shows this in the sentence, Even those critics who deny, etc. T h a t th ey derive from its m eaning, the meaning of a poem is a vibhäva or the like; the rasas are tan nimittäh, i.e., have that as their cause: such is their nature.§ 3.20c L ]"},{"pageNumber":511,"pageContent":"496The pertinence (saripatt) [of these remarks to the stanza on the women of the Triple City] is this. We have the vibhävas and the like such as the “catching of their hands” mentioned in the subject and so subordinated to the main rasa. Caused by them are matters of rasa (rasavastu) or rasa-like matters (rasasajâtïya) belonging to both tragedy and love-in-separation. And these are auxiliaries of what is predicated, namely the burning away of sins by the fire of diva’s arrows. From this [predicated burning of sin, so strengthened,] we apprehend a particular emotion (bhâva) called magnifying the power of God, which is the field of the figure of speech preyo 'laiikära.6 We see in the world how two mutually obstructive properties, heat and cold, belonging re­spectively to fire and water, act as auxiliaries to a cause, e.g., grains of rice, from which a specific result arises, namely the softening of the grains into edible food. Indeed the process of cause and effect takes place in this manner [by means of auxiliaries] everywhere, even in seed and sprout, etc.7At this rate it might seem that obstruction can never amount to anything [as it can always be explained away]. With this in mind he says, It is obstructive for a single cause, etc. Hence the maxim: there can be no cause of contradictory [results].8Now [a difficulty presents itself]. When a sentence with mutually obstructive suggestions occurs in a poem that is to be acted out, if a total representation is given, how can the actor represent these mutu­ally obstructive elements at one and the same time? With this in mind he asks how th e acto r can rep resen t, etc. He answers the question by saying, ju s t as he does, etc. The actor’s procedure will be just the same as it is in an instance where there is a comparably contradictory denoted meaning, as in “Come here! Go! Lie down! Get up!”What is meant is as follows. In acting out the verse, “The women of the Triple City,” etc., the actor will begin by representing the mean­ing in hand [that is, the final or predominant meaning of the verse] by the use of frightened and distressed glances. Although the tragic as well [as the erotic] is subordinated to this, still the tragic is closer to the meaning in hand than is love-in-separation because the tragic is more pertinent to rendering the power of God and because love-in­separation is farther removed, being brought in only by the fancy or simile expressed by the word iva (“as it were,\" “like”) in the phrase kâmïva (“like a lover”). Thus, up the phrase säsrunetrotpaläbhir [at the end of the third line], there should be used together with a repre­sentation that will be primarily pertinent to tragedy only a very slight[ § 3.20 c L"},{"pageNumber":512,"pageContent":"497[representation]9 of love-in-separation, with i ication being given of its similarity to tragedy. At the words kâmïva (“like a lover”) the representation will be appropriate to a love quarrel, from which love- in-separation may be understood, but as this is immediately followed by the power of God, rendered with grandiose gestures as the words sa dahatu duritam, etc., (“May this same fire burn away your sins”) arc to be enacted, the love-in-separation ends up by being subordinate to this [power of God] and there is no obstruction.He concludes this [demonstration of the] avoidance of obstruction by saying, In this way, etc.1. Hot fire and cold water combine to produce the cooking of rice.2. Änanda has used the singular vidhaa, not the dual, to indicate the im­possibility of contradictory actions by one person at one and the same time3. In order to maintain the meaningfulness of Vedic texts we are forced tointerpret the predicate here as double: at one time they use the sodasin in the Atirätra; at another time they do not. The use of the sodasin thus becomes optional. The Atirätra is one of the five forms (samsthâ) of the Jyotistoma sacrifice, so called from the name of the final vese-sequence (stotra) employed therein. The sodasin is a cup for holding soma. The apparently contradictory prescriptions for its use are discussed in Mimämsä Sütra and its commentary. 10.5.34ff. 4. Because the mind is hurried along to the chief matter of the sen­tence, the predicate. 5. In the ritual texts we are told that one should pay for the soma with a red, brown-eyed, year-old heifer (aninayô pingâksyâ eka- häyanyä somam krinäti). In the Aruna Section of the Mimämsä (MtmämsäS. pp. 673-698) the commentators show that the primary relation denoted by arunayä, pingâksyâ, and ekahäyanyä is that of instrumentality in the buying of the soma. Only later does one infer the identity of the substance referred to by these three adjectives. One does so from the grammatical agreement of the words plus the fact that their referents can be found in a single substance. In the case of the verse ehi gaccha, etc., such a posterior inference cannot be made. We cannot infer that one and the same man at one and the same time is told to come and go, lie and stand, etc. 6. See 2.5 a L. In the present interpretation, the magnification of éiva in the predicate is taken as preyo 'laii- kära; the suggestions of tragedy and love in the subject as rasavadalankära.

Because its force is thus blunted, there is no fault here in such an obstructive element. Accordingly, it is proper to call an element “obstructive of the rasa” only if it is obstructive of the rasa or bhâva that is the overall sense of the sentence and not when it has been subordinated to that sense.L He says that in other contexts the fault of obstruction may be explained away in a different manner: F urtherm ore, etc. Judges of literatu re: that is, an audience possessed of discrimination.

Rather, the tragic here, resulting as it does from anger which is a transient state of the heroic, ends up, because of its suggesting its cause, simply as an increased relish of the heroic. As has been said, “the tragic rasa should be known as the effect of the cruel.” 1 This is what our author says in speaking of occasions of th e g reatest joy. An example is the following:0 amaranth, you will lose the joy of pressing close to our breasts;O bakula vine, our sweet breathwill live only in your memory;while you, the griefless asoka,will be grieved without the touch of our feet.Such are the words of his enemies’ wivesas they flee their ancient city.[Ratnâkara]2Or bhâva: that is to say, the sthäyibhäva in that rasa, or a vyabhi- cäribhäva if it has become predominant, as yearning (autsukya) might become in love-in-separation."},{"pageNumber":514,"pageContent":"4991. The quotation (BhNÉ 6.40; Vol. 1, p. 295) is not quite appropriate. Bharata is there speaking of the close relation between raudra and karuna., rather than between vira and karuna. Abhinava uses the quotation again in commenting on 3.24 Introduction. 2. The verse is ascribed to Ratnäkara, the ninth century Kashmirian, by both Éarng. 1269 and Subh.A. 2564. It plays on the poetic conventions of the dohadas (whims of pregnancy) of flow­ers. In order to blossom the asoka must be touched by a woman’s foot, the bakula must be sprinkled with wine from a woman’s mouth, and the ama­ranth {kurabaka) must be embraced. For the last of these conventions see Sattasai 1.6 and Saundaryalahari vs. 97. The verse quoted by Mallinàtha on Kum.Sam. 3.26 presumably follows the same tradition, but in the NSP ed. the words älokitah and äloditah have been reversed. My note in HOS Voi. 44, p. Ill, para. 7 should therefore be corrected.§ 3.20e A ]A Or we may say that in any context of the tragic, even if this tragic rasa is made predominant, the joining to it of an erotic element by some special turn of speech will work toward the strengthening of the tragic rasa. This is because of the fact that when things that are sweet by nature come to be objects of grief, they occasion an even greater access of grief if we remember the erotic charm that belonged to them in their former state. For example:Here is the hand that drew off my belt, that felt my full breasts, that touched my navel, my thighs and loins, that untied the knot of my skirt.[Mahâbhârata 11.24.17]1And so in the verse on the women of the Triple City, the fire of diva’s arrows acted “as a lover who has lately loved another.” In this way too one may say that there is no obstruction. So, no matter in which of many ways the verse is examined, no fault is -to be found i it. The same is true of the following:They walk the ground about a forest fire, seeming to drip lac from tender feet which are bleeding from the spikegrass;"},{"pageNumber":515,"pageContent":"[ § 3.20e Aand as their eyes drop tears and in their fear they hold their husbands by the hand, the women of your foemen seem to be enacting once again their marriage.2In all such verses one should understand that there is no obstruction.We have thus shown, so far, the various areas in which rasas and the like may and may not be combined with obstructive rasas and the like.1. The verse is the lament of the wife (not wives, as Abhinava says) of Bhûrisravas as she stands among the dead warriors on Kuru Field. Arjuna had cut off the hand of Bhüriéravas as that warrior was about to kill Sätyaki (MBh 7.117). This interference of Arjuna in what should have been single combat is often held up to his reproach, a fact that also adds to the karuna- rasa of the quoted verse. 2. The verse is found also in the Khandaprasasti attributed to Hanumän (The Pandit, Vols. 5-6) and in Mammata (7, ex. 338), etc. Each trait that is described of the now unhappy wives is likened by simile or suggestion to the erotic context of their earlier marriage. So if we interpret the verse according to the second interpretation given to the stanza on the women of the Triple City, we will say that the rasa of the verse is tragedy, which is heightened by the use of remembered love. If we interpret by the method used in 2.20 d, the tragic element will be blunted by our delight in the power of the king who is being praised. If we follow the line laid down in 2.20 c, both the tragic and the erotic elements will be subordinated to the panegyric (preyo ’lankära) which is the main intention of the verse.L Our author now uses a different method by which to explain away the obstruction in the previously cited verse on the women of the Triple City: O r we m ay say. What he has in mind is this. In his previous explanation he stated that there was no obstruction because love-in-separation and the tragic were both subordinated to something else. Now he is making the love-in-separation subordinate to the tragic and showing in this way that it cannot obstruct. Thus it has been said that the tragic rasa arises from determinants (vibhäva) such as the destruction of one’s loved ones (istajana, BhNÉ Vol. 1, p. 317) and the property of being a “loved one” (istatä) depends on one’s being the recipient of the emotion love. So in the figure of fancy used in the words “like a lover who has lately been unfaithful,” the following is suggested. In looking at the motions of diva’s arrows of fire the women are reminded of the events of former love quarrels. These quarrels, being now utterly erased, become vibhâvas (determinants or factors"},{"pageNumber":516,"pageContent":"501which reveal) the grief of the women. This is what our author is saying [when he speaks of joining an erotic element]. B y som e special tu rn o f speech: He means, by bringing in some determinant (vibhäva) or symptom (anubhâva) in an elegant way, in words that lack vulgarity.He gives an example of just this: “Here is the hand.” This is the lament of the wives1 of Bhurisravas as they see his hand lying on the battle field. “That drew off my belt”: that drew off my girdle on occasions of making love. Many verses are amenable to this method of explaining away obstruction. With this in mind he says, T he sam e is tru e, etc. The “tears” could be caused by the smoke of the marriage fire or by grief at leaving the house of parents. Their “fear” could be the natural timidity of virgins.Thus he has given this long but useful explanation of the portion of the Kärikä (3.20) that states “there is no fault in mentioning [these obstructive factors] if they are brought into a subordinate role.” He concludes by saying, We have th u s show n, etc. The word tävat (“so far” ) shows that there are other matters still to be stated.1. As Jacobi has pointed out (ZDMG 57, p. 35, note 4), only one wife is speaking in this Mahâbhârata passage.§ 3.21 K ]A Now, in order to show the proper method of introducing these [rasas and the like] into a single extended work, the following is said:K While it is well known that larger works contain a variety of rasas, a poet who seeks the excellence [of his works] will make just one of them predominant.1"},{"pageNumber":517,"pageContent":"S021. The antecedent of tesäm is not clear from the wording of the Kärikä, but in the Vrtti Änanda takes it to be the rasäh expressed in nänärasa-, Abhi- nava says it is prabandhänäm.

If compounded, the long i would be taken as the suffix ctn (Pan. 5.4.50), by which the meaning would be reversed (“just one of them must be made subordinate”).[ § 3.21 KA In larger works, such as mahäkävyas or nätakas, many rasas are found dispersed in major and minor functions. While this is well known, an author who aims at a high degree of beauty for his works will make just one of these rasas, as being the intended rasa of the whole work, predominant over the others. This is the more proper way.L He introduces those [other matters which, as we remarked at the end of the last section, remain to be stated]: Now, etc. Construe “method of introducing” with “these rasas.”[Comment on the Kärikä.] Well known: having been described by the sage Bharata and others.

However, the sort of work [where a single rasa is predominant], such as a nätaka or a mahäkävya, is a finer piece of lit­erature. That is what he means by using the comparative degree of the adjective: “more proper.”1. Abhinava’s interpretation is thus: “a poet who seeks the excellence of his works will make just one rasa prédominent.” 2. Patâka is a short interlude, prakari a longer one; see 3.10-14 i-L, notes 7 and 9. 3. Forparyäyabandha see above, 3.7 L and note 4. The samavakära has not hitherto been mentioned.

In anticipation of this question the following is said:K The inclusion of other rasas will not harm the predominance of the rasa in hand if that rasa appears as an abiding factor.A In large works, if a rasa is first taken in hand and then con­stantly brought back, as an abiding factor that stretches throughout the entire work, its predominance will not be injured by the introduction of other rasas that occur in the intervals [of its appearance].L B ut how: What he means is this. How can a rasa be subor­inate if it is fully developed? Or if it is not fully developed, how can it be a rasa? It thus appears that being a rasa and being subordinate are self-contradictory concepts. And yet if these other rasas are not subordinate, how can a single rasa be predominant?T he inclusion of o th er rasas: If the rasa that has been taken in hand extends throughout-the whole plot and is fitted for predominance by this extensiveness, its predominance will not be harmed by the in­troduction, by the filling in, of other rasas brought in by the needs of the plot and running through only limited sections of the narrative. Rather than being injured, the predominance of the rasa which appears"},{"pageNumber":519,"pageContent":"504as an abiding factor throughout the plot will be strengthened. In other words, the subsidiary nuns, although they attain a degree of charm by being fully developed each at its own stage by its own set of vibhävas and the like, still do not attain such a charm that our apprehension will rest on them; rather, it will be carried on to some further delight. This is the process that is found everywhere in relations of minor and major. As the great master* 1 has said:The minor by being perfected goes to [the help of] the major, for in this way it works to the greater advantage of the major.[ § 3.22 L1. We do not know whom Abhinava means. Elsewhere he uses the term tatrabhavän of at least three persons: lävarakrsna, Patanjali, Bhartrhari. The quoted verse is found also in Mammata very near the end of the Seventh Book.3.23 IntroductionA To demonstrate this, the following is said:K As a single, abiding goal (kärya)1 is demanded for a work, so also there is no obstruction (or contradiction) at all in demanding -a- “sTngle roso.1. Just what the Kärikä means here by kärya is hard to say: goal, line of action, or plot. Änanda leaves the word as it is without a gloss or explanation. To Abhinava it carried the technical sense that it bears in BhNÉ, viz., goal as the third of the arthaprakrtis. But Abhinava saw that this sense was too narrow. So by remedial interpretation he-reads other senses into it as well.A Just as a single, abiding goal is set up, extending throughout the body of the work with all its sandhis, without precluding its being"},{"pageNumber":520,"pageContent":"505combined with other goals, nor is its predominance lessened by this mixture; just so is there no obstruction to a single rasa by its being mixed with others. Readers with a ready sense of discrimination, who are attentive and intelligent, will rather take a higher degree of pleasure in such a work.§ 3.23 L ]L To dem onstrate: he means, by furnishing an appropriate analogy. And the analogy stands to reason. For one must of necessity accept a single goal that sets the topic, that extends throughout the work, and that is helped out by other, occasional goals. And it is because of this [relation of major and minor] that the states of mind (cittavrtti) of the chief characters, which depend upon these goals or objectives, themselves fall into relations of major and minor. There is nothing extraordinary about this. Such is the overall meaning.Ju s t so (tathä): exactly similar in its extending throughout the work. 1 Or we can take the word eva to be displaced, understanding it to go with tathä rather than with no. The sense will then be: it follows by necessity that the rasas too should be arranged in just the same maimer ( tathä eva), viz., in a relation of major and minor elements, as is found in the goals or objectives.Goal:2 [This includes] the bija (seed), which has been defined as “that which is of small compass at its first appearance but which spreads out in many ways.\" 3 [Hence it is spoken of as “extending throughout,”] Again, the binda (drop) is that which binds together again whenever there is an interruption of purpose, all the way from the btja to the end of the work.4 So the “goal” in its form of the artha- prakrti called the bindu extends to the denouement of the work. He indicates this by saying that it is abiding (anuyäyi). Thus, by this word “goal” both the 6yaand the bindu are included. With other goals: This refers to the incidental goal resident in the fourth arthaprakrti, called the patäkä, which is defined as “not extending beyond the garbha or the vimarsa sandhi” 5 and to the goals which characterize the still less extensive prakari.6 In this way, what is said implies that the five artha- prakrtis should be so introduced as to form part of a single whole,7 as is done in the Täpasavatsaräja.The Kärikä has thus done two things: it has given an analogy to the relation of principal and subordinate [that should exist among the rasas] and it has shown how this relation among the rasas follows from"},{"pageNumber":521,"pageContent":"the force of the plot. The text of the Vrtti is likewise to be interpreted as having these two intentions.1. Abhinava is here giving the word tathâ of the Kärikä a double function. It acts as a correlative of yathâ, but it also acts as an independent adverb: “in the demanding of a rasa that acts ‘so’ (viz., throughout the work), there is no contradiction.” 2. Abhinava takes kärya basically to mean the third of the five arthaprakrtis, for an explanation of which see above, 3.10-14 f L, note 7. But he makes it include, in a secondary sense, the first arthaprakrti or bija (hence Änanda calls it vyâpakam) and the second arthaprakrti or bindu (hence Änanda calls it anuyäyi). He then takes karyäntaraih to refer to the fourth and fifth arthaprakrtis, which must be subordinated to the first three. 3. This is Bharata’s definition, BhNÉ 19.22. 4. BhNÉ 19.23, whichlacks the words bîjât prabhrti and ends yàvat samâptir bandhasya sa bindvh parikïrtitah. 5. BhNÉ 19.24; for the five sandhis see above, 3.10-14 f L. 6. BhNÉ 19.25. 7. Ekaväkyatä is a term taken from the commentators onPanini. It may happen that two statements are found separately given in Pânini’s text but are to be taken as forming a consistent unit (vâkya) with the mahäväkya or overall statement. Väkyaikyaväkyatä comes to mean the consistency of smaller syntactic elements with an overarching whole.506 [ § 3.23 LA Now it may readily be granted that a relation of predomi­nant and subordinate can be established between rasas which are not mutually obstructive, as between the heroic and the erotic, the erotic and the comic, the cruel and the erotic, the heroic and the marvellous, the heroic and the cruel, the cruel and the tragic, or the erotic and the marvellous. But it may be doubted how such a relation can be achieved between rasas which are mutually exclusive, as between the erotic and the loathsome, the heroic and the fearsome, the peaceful and the cruel, or the peaceful and the erotic. So the next Kärikä says:L That the erotic is not obstructive of the heroic appears from the fact that the fairest maidens are won by battle, boldness, and diplo­macy. The comic clearly fits in with the erotic. Comedy, while not in"},{"pageNumber":522,"pageContent":"507itself one of the aims of man, can become one by its increasing our delight in the erotic when it forms part of it. It can even somehow be made out that the cruel is not obstructive to the erotic, for it has been said by Bharata that “they even make love with violence,” 1 where he is referring by the word “they” to devils, demons, and violent men. One need only avoid cruelty here as exercised against the heroine.2 The heroic and the marvellous can combine because wonder is aroused by the hero’s unexpected deeds such as sweeping the earth clear [of all his enemies). As the sage [Bharata] has said, “the effect of the heroic is the marvellous.” 3 The heroic and the cruel combine in a proud and noble (dhiroddhata) hero like BhTma because there is no obstruction between anger and heroic energy (utsäha) .4 Of the cruel and the tragic the sage has said, “the effect of the cruel should be known as the tragic rasa.nS The erotic and the marvellous can combine, as in the mirage of the magician in the Ratnävali.6The erotic and. th e loathsom e: How can there be a relation of predominant and subordinate between two rasas of which the one can arise only by elimination of the other? Love takes the form of plunging into the object of one’s emotion; loathing the form of fleeing from the object. If the two were to take the same object, the one would destroy the natural inclination of the other. Fear and heroic energy7 must also be said to be mutually obstructive. And there is obstruction of the peaceful by either love or anger,8 for the peaceful takes its life from an indifference to worldly objects brought on by a knowledge of truth and so is void of desire, whereas love and anger live on one’s attachment to worldly objects.9§ 3.24 Introduction L ]1.

Three principles of avoidance are here implied, of which the first is this. A non-obstructive rasa should not be more fully developed than the predominant rasa-, because it will not obstruct the predominant rasa [not only if it is less fully developed, but] even if it is developed to an equal extent [with the predominant rasa] .1 As in this verse:On one side his beloved weeps, on the other the trumpet of battle sounds: the soldier's heart swings to and fro between love of wife and love of war.2She breaks the necklace from her neckand tells it over like a rosary;she pretends her girdle strings are serpent coito bind her thighs in yogic posture;her lips, which tremble with the syllablesof the silent spell, yet half reveal a smile,for, jealous of the Lady Twilight,she is mimicking the Lord of Cattle’s prayers:I pray you see the Goddess at that moment,that her smile may ever bring you aid.31. The question may be asked how we are to know which rasa is predom­inant (atipin) and which is subordinate (anga) if both are developed (pari- posita) to an equal extent.

One suspects it of being an insertion, as Abhinava does not comment on it nor is it quoted by Mammata or Hemacandra. It belongs to the type of benediction characterized in HOS Voi. 44, Section 1, para. 2 and Section 4, para. 20. It is the smile of the Goddess that forms the link between the divine incident protrayed in the first three and a half lines and the benediction of the final half line. The smile in the incident is, of course, mischievous. PärvatT, as in Kvm.Sam. 8.49, is jealous of her husband’s addressing prayers to another goddess and is mocking him by her imitation. He is telling over his beads as he recites the mantras and has bound his intertwined thighs with his attendant serpent, Vâsuki. Pârvatï uses her necklace and girdle strings in imitation. But a smile from the Goddess, however occasioned, is all that we mortals need in order to be blessed. The combination of rasas, à propos of which the verse is here quoted, is of srngära, as revealed by the vyabhicäribhäva jealousy, and häsa, as revealed by the mimicry. Badarinäth Sarmä is mistaken in finding a combination of srngära and iònio in the verse. The verse is adduced as an example of mutually non-obstructive rasas. Érngâra and iònia are mutually obstructive.§ 3.24 L ]L [Commentary on the Kärikä:} O bstructive or non-obstruc­tive: The intention of the alternative “or” is as follows. When an added rasa is made stronger than the predominant rasa, the added rasa will be objectionable even if it is non-obstructive. On the other hand, if it is made compatible by bringing it into subordination to the predominant rasa by some means, then even an obstructive rasa, being added on, as he will state, 1 by such means as by attaching it to a different person, will not be censurable. So the question of obstructive or non-obstructive is of no consequence. What is important is to pay heed to the way in which the rasa is introduced.Into th e p redom inant ra s a : The locative (angini) is locative of despite.2 The sense is that a subordinate rasa should not be developed in despite of the given predominant rasa so that it puts that rasa down. It will not produce obstruction: the meaning is, it will be without fault.[Commentary on the Vrtti.] He speaks of three ways of avoiding over­development in the passage beginning with the word tatra (“of which”) and ending with the word trtiyah (“the third way,” 3.24a). But now,"},{"pageNumber":525,"pageContent":"510one would have expected the Kärikä to state merely that the added rasa should be less developed. What possibility did its author envisage to make him say rather that it should not be more developed? The Vrtti addresses this question with the words because even if it is developed to an equal ex ten t, etc.[After translating the Prakrit verse “On the one side,” etc., Abhinava continues:) The words “his beloved weeps” show a development of love {rati), the words “the trumpet of battle sounds” and “the soldier’s [heart]” show a development of heroic energy (utsäha). The words “swings to and fro” show an exact equality of the two. Here some have said that this [equality] can obtain only within the compass of a single verse, not throughout the extent of a whole work. But they are wrong.3 Because in the plot that forms the topic of a whole work the three goals of man (sensual enjoyment, power and religious merit) may all be equally predominant. For example in the Ratnävali, from the point of view of what is accomplished by the efforts of the king’s min­ister, the basic goal of the play will be the king’s attaining sovereignty over the whole earth, while his gaining the most beautiful of maddens is only an incidental goal. But from the point of view of the king, the opposite is the case. Such then being the view of the minister and such the view of the king, by the maxim that success is achieved only by uniting the mi isteria! and the royal points of view, we end up uniting them and saying that each is predominant. Now it is a principle of practical government that success comes only from uniting the plans of the sovereign and his ministers. So [in this play] the two are united, which amounts to saying that ultimately they are of equal predomi­nance. As has been said, “By the skillful effort of a poet [a goal is achieved] by all the chief characters in cooperation.” 4 But enough of this side issue.5 1[ § 3.24 L1. In 3.25. 2. Abhinava sometiomes prefers to take a locative thusrather than as a locative of place; see 3.10-14c L, note 1. 3. I have trans­lated the plural of the text: “some have said they are wrong.” But Abhinava is doubtless referring, with intentional vagueness, to a single com­mentator, probably his favorite whipping boy, the author of the Candrikâ. The opinion that Abhinava here refutes has much to be said in its favor. It is on the face of it nonsense to speak of an anga and an angin as being equal without qualifying the statement in some way. One may do so by saying that the anga and angin may be equal for the space of a single verse, but that the angin continues as fully developed in succeeding verses, whereas the anga"},{"pageNumber":526,"pageContent":"511does not. Such was apparently the interpretation of the previous commen­tator. On the other hand, the qualification preferred by Abhinava is that the aiiga may continue as equally important but only from the viewpoint of a secondary character. 4. The quotation has not been traced. One must complete it by some such words as äpyate phalam. 5. It seems to me that Abhinava's quick wit in putting down his adversary has led him into deep waters. Yaugandharäyana’s efforts may be as important to the plot of the Ratnâvaiï as King Udayana’s. But how are they as important to the rasa? If they are, to what rasa do we ascribe them? If we ascribe them to a rasa other than srngàra, how does irtigara remain, as everyone agrees that it does, the predominant rasa of the play?§ 3.24a >1 ]A The second [principle of avoiding overdevelopment of a rasa] is this. One should not introduce too many transient states (vyabhi- cärins) obstructive to the predominant rasa. Or, if one does introduce them, one should follow them quickly by transient states of the pre­dominant rasa.The third way is to be constantly watchful that a subordinate rasa which is being developed remains subordinate. Other principles along these lines can be imagined. But any rasa that is obstructive must be kept less developed than the predominant, as, for example, the erotic when the peaceful is predominant, or the peaceful when the erotic is predominant.It may be asked how a rasa which is not developed can be a rasa at all. The answer is that we are here speaking of its development relative to that of the predominant rasa. It must not be developed as fully as the predominant rasa. This does not mean that it may not have such development of its own as is possible [within this limit]. And this imparting of a relative prominance to a single rasa in works which contain many rusas cannot be denied even by a critic who would not admit a predominant-subordinate (or whole and part) relation between rasas.In this way, whether they are obstructive or non-obstructive, if rasas are added to a work in a relation of subordinate to predominant, there will be no obstruction. All this has been said from the point of view"},{"pageNumber":527,"pageContent":"512of those who hold that one rosa may act as a vyabhicärin (temporary state or variant) of another. Even in the opinion of others (who deny that possibility], one can take the sthäyibhävas of the rasos to be re­ferred to by the word rasa in its secondary sense and say that by the subordination of one of them to another, obstruction is avoided.[ § 3.24 a AL Having thus described the first method, he states the second: One should not introduce, etc. N ot introduce: viz., into the sub­ordinate rasa. But at this rate, it might be objected, the subordinate rasa could not be properly developed. Anticipating this objection, he gives a different judgment: Or, if one does introduce them . The word “or” is here used to affirm the second judgment, not to offer it as an alternative.1 Thus only one method [is here recommended],2 whereas otherwise there would be two.3 A transient state which belongs [specifi­cally] to the predominant rasa should follow, that is, should bring them into conformity. For example, in the stanza, “In anger she has bound him,”4 anger (krodha) has been expressed as subordinate to sexual de­sire (rati), which is the predominant bhâva of the stanza. A transient state [of this anger], indignation (amarsa), has been introduced by the words, “bound him tightly.” But by the words, “she weeps” and “with a laugh,” this is quickly brought into conformity with such transient states of rati as jealousy, yearning, joy.He states the third way: to be constantly w atchful. One may take as example the Täpasavatsaräja, in which the rasa of love-in­enjoyment, furnished by King Vatsa’s relation to PadmävatI, [ is always kept subordinate].5 O ther principles: [For example,] one should not overdevelop the vibhävas and anubhävas of a subordinate rasa. If they are obstructive to the predominant rasa, one should not introduce them at all; or rather, if one does so, one should add to them vibhävas and anubhävas belonging to the predominant rasa. Where the vibhävas and anubhävas of an obstructive rasa are developed, one must be vigilant to keep them subordinate. One can readily supply such rules by oneself.Having thus described the methods that are common to cases of ob­structive and non-obstructive factors, he now speaks of a particular [means]-which differs by its being a method for avoiding overdevelop­ment which is peculiar to cases of obstructive factors: B ut any ra sa th at is obstructive, etc.As is possible: supply, t being obstructive to the predom­inant rasa.\""},{"pageNumber":528,"pageContent":"513A nd this [im parting of a relative prom inence], etc.: There exists an opinion that there is no such thing as a relation of helper- helped among rasas because a rasa has no further effect than its own aesthetic delight (camatkära); that otherwise it could not be called a rasa; and if it were not a rasa, how could it take part in a relation of predominant and subordinate rasas? But even those who hold this opinion must admit the prominence of a single rasa in a work, that is, its extension over a greater part of the work, while other rasas are found accompanying smaller sections of the work, for otherwise there could be no coherence of the plot (itivrtta).8 If there is no coherence of the rasa that extends over the greater part of the work with the other rasas, there will be no coherence of the plot; while if there is coherence of the plot, this will amount to admitting a relation of helper-helped among the rasas. That there is no contradiction between the fact that the rasas end in their own aesthetic delight [and the fact that they may exist in a subordinate or helping relation] will be stated just below.7 So he says, even by a critic who would not admit, etc. What he means is that the critic may refuse to admit it in so many words, but will be forced to admit it in principle.Now another [commentator] has given a different explanation. The passage beginning '‘and this imparting of a relative prominence,” he says, refers to the “second” opinion, according to which the relation of helper-helped does not exist among the rasas [but exists only among the sthäyibhävas}. Even in that opinion, he says, there is predominance of one rasa by its extending over a greater section of the plot. This explanation is wrong.8 Because if we accept it, the author’s summary, which refers to only one opinion, as is clear from the word “all” in “all this has been said,” etc., and from his raising only later the second opin­ion with the words “even in the opinion of others” : [this distribution of the two opinions] would be illogical. But enough of this argument with an older member of my family.9Of those who hold: At the end of Bharata’s chapter on the bhâvas is this verse:Of many [rasas] which are used in the same work the one whose form is [of] large [compass] should be considered the ‘abiding’ (sthâyin) rasa; the others, the ‘transient’ (sancärin) rasas.10According to what is stated in this verse, a state of mind (cittavrtti) that extends over the basic plot must necessarily appear as “abiding,” whereas that which accompanies only an incident in the plot will appear§ 3.24a L ]"},{"pageNumber":529,"pageContent":"514as “transient.” Thus there is no contradiction in an abider-transient [= principal-subordinate] relation between them at the time when they are relished in the form of rasas. This is how some people11 have explained the verse. Thus, even Bhäguri, 12 after asking, “Are the rasas as well [as the bhâvas] to be regarded as abiding or transient?” answers it in the affirmative, saying, “Indeed they are.”But others understand the verse to mean that that rasa (i.e., bhäva] which is listed as a sthäyibhäva may become a vyabhicäribhäva of an­other rasa,13 as anger (krodka) [which is listed as the sthäyibhäva of the cruel] may become a vyabhicärin of the heroic, while a rasa that is listed as a vyabhicärin may become the sthäyibhäva in another rasa, as indifference (nirveda) [which is listed by Bharata as a vyabhicärin of the tragic], when it is revelatory of a knowledge of truth, becomes the sthäyibhäva of the peaceful. Or we may take the verse to mean that that which is really a temporary state (vyabhicärin) may be relatively permanent as compared with other temporary states, as, for example, madness in the Fourth Act of the Vikramorvasï.1* The intention of the verse is to give all this meaning. Its literal interpretation is: “Of many bhävas (emotional states) in their form of states-of-mind (cittavrtti), that one whose form is found to be large is the sthäyibhäva (the abiding emotion) and it is a Vasa’ because it is capable of being made into a rasa; the others are called ‘transient’.” But with this permanence and transiency of the rasas the verse says nothing of their being related as predominant and subordinate. That is why still others read the term rasasthäyi as a compound,15 whether as a genitive tatpurusa (mean­ing “the abiding emotion of the rasa”), or as a locative (“the abiding emotion in the rasa”), or, on the authority of Pan. 2.1.24, V ärt 1, as an accusative. 16 So he says, Even in th e opinion of others, etc. By th e word rasa-. The reference is to the word rasa contained i Kärikä 3.22.1. Abhinava is taking the word vâ of the Vrtti in the sense of “rather,” ashe did in 3.9 L. 2. Namely, the second of the three principles announced in 3.24 A. 3. And consequently the vrtti should have spoken of four principles in 3.24 A, not three. 4. See 2.18-19 e A and 3.20 b A and L. 5. For the plot of the Täpasavatsaräja see above 3.10-14 g L. King Udayana’s love for Padmâvatï is always kept subordinate to his sorrow for the loss of Vâsava- dattä. 6. As in commenting on 3.23, Abhinava here again emphasizes the dependence of the nuas on the plot. Just as a plot demands the introduction of various rasas, so the coherence of the plot demands an angängibhäva or upa- käryopakärakabhäva among the rasas. 7. Viz. by Abhinava, Text. p. 386,[ § 3.24a L"},{"pageNumber":530,"pageContent":"515lines 5-8. 8. The interpretation to which Abhinava objects was that ofthe Candrikä. It is certainly the natural interpretation of the passage. What Abhinava has against it is that if such was Änanda’s intention, he seems to contradict himself in the words that follow, when he says, “All this is according to the opinion that one rasa may act as the vyabhicärin of another.\" To absolve his author from the charge of contradicting himself, Abhinava gives a more artificial explanation of the passage. The critic who “will not admit” the aiigäiigibhäva (or the anugrähyänugrähakabhäva) of the rasas is not an upholder of the second opinion (viz., the opinion that the sthäyibhävas rather than the rasas are subordinated to one another). He is a believer in the sva- camatkäraviiränti of the rasas, one who is so obstinate in that belief that he will not admit the aiigäiigibhäva of the rasas although he really must believe in them. Thus the critic “who will not admit” the aiigäiigibhäva of the rasas can be included in those who really believe that one raso can act as the vyabhi- cärin of another. There is now no contradiction in saying that “all that we have said is according to the belief that one rasa may act as the vyabhicärin of another.” 9. See Introduction, p. 29.1 0. BhNS 7.119 + 1 (Voi. 1, p. 379). The verse is missing in the shorter version of Bharata. The translation that we give here understands the third quarter of the verse as sa mantavyo rasah sthäyi, whether one reads it that way (as does the GOS ed. of BhNÉ) or whether one reads so mantavyo rasa- sthäyi (as does the Kashi ed. of the Locano) and understands a dropping of the visarga by Pan. 8.3.36, Värt. 1. If one takes the latter reading and regards rasasthäy» as a compound, a different translation will be needed. We give it in footnote 15, below. 1 1. In the term “some people\" Abhinava apparently includes himself. 12. Nothing more is known of Bhâguri as a drama critic than what is furnished, by this reference. The Bhâguri quoted in LaksmT- dhara’s commentary on Vâdirâja’s Yasodharacarita 2.34 was a grammarian, if we are to judge from the nature of the quotation there given. It is possible, of course, that one man commented both on grammar and on the BhNÉ. 13. This first group of “others” differs from Abhinava in taking the word rasa in the verse to mean bhäva. Abhinava too believed in the interchangeability of sthäyin and vyabhicäribhävas-, cf. above, 3.20 L, note 4. But he does not understand the present verse to refer to it. 14. Madness (unmäda) is a vyabhicäribhäva of love-in-separation, but is so developed in the mad scene of the Vikramorvas't as to become practically the sthäyin. 15. For this third interpretation we must translate the verse as follows: “Of many [fthavas] which are used in the same work, the one whose form is [of a] large [compass] should be considered as the ‘abiding’ bhäva of [or in. or with,] the rasa; the others as the ‘transient’ [bhâvas].” 16. Abhinava quotes the Värttika as it is given in Patanjali and in the Käs'ikä. Its sense is “To the list given as 'srita, etc.’ one should add gami, gämin, and others.” The list is of words which may be compounded with an accusative noun. Thus, grämagämi “going to the§ 3.24 a L ]"},{"pageNumber":531,"pageContent":"k[ $ 3.24 a Lvillage.” So here, maasthäyi “abiding with the roso.” Sthâyi is understood as anusthâyi and so <*an govern the accusative although the verb without prefix is normally intransitive.A Having thus set forth the means of avoiding obstruction that are common to cases of naturally obstructive and naturally unobstruc­tive elements when introduced into the predominant rasa of a work, it is now proposed to show one [means] that is limited in its use to the area of naturally obstructive elements. Thus, the K ärikä says:K If an element, which would be obstructive to the abiding [rasa] because its belonging to the same base would be contradictory, is made to belong to a different base, it will be without fault if fully developed, even so.A Obstructive (or contradictory) elements are of two sorts: ob­structive because found in the same locus and obstructive because im­mediately successive. Of these, that which is obstructive to the pre­dominant rasa that abides throughout the work, because its belonging to the same base would be contradictory to the rules of propriety, as the fearsome would be to the heroic, should be made to belong to a dif­ferent base. The hero of the story is the base of heroism; so it should be introduced into his opponent If that is done, even if the element is naturally obstructive, one may develop it without fault. For if one shows an extreme degree of fear in the enemy, one will thereby suggest all the more of competence and bravery on the part of the hero. This is shown clearly in my Arjunacarita on the occasion of Arjuna’s descent into the underworld."},{"pageNumber":532,"pageContent":"§ 3.25 L ]L By summing up the means that are common, he lays the ground [for describing] a means that is special: Having thus, etc. One: that is, a means of avoiding obstruction.[Comment on the Kärika.] The adjectival compound viruddhaikä- srayo contains the cause. 1 That abiding [state] that is naturally ob­structive because its belonging to the same base with some other abid­ing [state] would be inconceivable, like fear with boldness, must be made to have a different base, that is, must be made to belong to the enemy of the hero. It [will be]: Even if it is naturally obstructive, if it is made thus, if it is constructed thus, its development will not constitute a fault because it will add to the prominence of the hero. This implies that it would actually be a fault not to develop it. The word api is displaced and is taken to be so by the Vrtti as well [as by us].2[Comment on the Vrtti.} O bstructive because found in the sam e locus: that is, by its very connection with the same base [regardless of time], as boldness with fear. In other cases, even if connection with the same base may be possible, an element may be obstructive because it follows immediately, without any interval, as indifference [will prove obstrucitve] to love [when it follows immediately].3 Is shown: in such passages as this:And as the fearsome sound of Arjun’s bow was heard, a panic rose within the city of the demons.41'. Abbinava means that viruddhaikäsrayo acts as a causal clause. “Pos­sessing a contradictory belonging to the same base” means “Because its be­longing to the same base would be contradictory.\" 2. Both Änanda and Abhinava understand the api with tasya [tnrod/iina/i] rather than with pose: ‘There will be no fault even if the element is naturally obstructive” rather than ‘There will be no fault even if one develops fully a naturally obstructive element.\" 3. The distinction is this. Some emotions can never share the same person. A hero is never afraid. Some emotions can occur in one and the same person but not in immediate succession. A lover may become a saint; but not immediately. 4. One hopes that a whole canto was not written in this thumping iambic meter.

Now the hero’s love (srngära) for MalavavatT would be obstructive to this rasa of peace; so the poet, in order to make possible its breaking forth in succession to the peaceful, presents it only after inserting the rasa of the marvellous, which is unobstructive to either. He does this in the passage “Ah, what a song! Ah, what music!” (Näg. 1.13 +1)- And for this purpose the verse: “Clarity in all ten types of touch.” etc. (Näg. 1.14),4 while it is almost without rasa of itself, is here presented, as it raises the dfegree of rasa by strengthening the marvellous. After which, the next rasa is shown to break forth with “There can be no harm in looking at an unmarried girl” (Näg. 1.14 +9). As the Sânkhya philosophers, who are famous for their examination of how states of mind arise, have said:As occasion is offered by causes and effects,[through the power of prakrti, the psychic self takes up its different postures like an actor], aiming at the various goals of man.5Then we have this erotic mood, which has been brought in by causes and effects, strengthened by the comic, which is roused by the actions of Sekharaka. In natural opposition to this and in support of worldly disenchantment and peace is the scene of viewing the bones of the dead Nägas. But this is introduced only after the insertion of the heroic, aided by the transient state (vyabhicärin) of anger as expressed by the verses beginning with: “[Blacking out the sun with aerial chariots]/ that fly from every side [along the roads of heaven]\" (Näg. 3.15), these verses being spoken by Mitravasu, whose entrance is the occasion for Malayavatl’s exit.1. What follows is a most interesting analysis of the Nägänanda. which shows that from the point of view of at least one sensitive critic it was not the dramatic failure that most Europeans have thought it. The student will have to read or reread the play in order properly to judge Abhinava's analysis.

The quotation is of the first half of Säiikhyakärikä 42, to which I have joined a translation of the second half in brackets (prakrter vibhutvayogän natavad vyavatisthate Ungarn). Abhinava quotes the verse in order to show that the state of mind of the chief character (and therefore the rasa of the play) is not immutable and that a skilled dramatist will make use of these “occasions offered by causes and effects\" in order to bring about changes therein. Actually one might argue that this factor is as important as the insertion of the third rasa. The drunkenness of Sekharaka and the sight of the bones of the sacrificed Nägas are later instances in the Nägänanda. It is these external events which serve to alter the cittavrtti and the rasa. Even by the aid of such events, of course, they cannot be immediately reversed. As with an automobile, one must first shift into neutral.[ § 3.26 LA And the peaceful is indeed apprehended as a rasa.1 It is char­acterized by the full development of the happiness that comes from the dying off of desire. As has been said:The joy of pleasure in this world and the greater joy of pleasures found i are not worth a sixteenth of the joy that comes from the dying of desire.[Mahâbhârata 12.168.36]J1. Despite the fact that it is not mentioned as one of the rasas in the oldest version of BhNÉ. 2. The verse is found quoted throughout Sanskrit literature; see references in the critical ed. of Mbh.L But now, it may be objected that there is no such rasa as the peaceful and that the sage (Bharata) does not even mention a basic"},{"pageNumber":536,"pageContent":"521emotional state (sthäyin) for such a rasa. Anticipating this difficulty, our author says, And th e peaceful, etc. The peaceful rasa may be characterized as the full development into aesthetic enjoyment of a certain type of happiness (sukha) occurring as a basic èmotional state. This happiness consists in the dying off, that is, the complete cessation, of desires, that is, yearnings for objects of sense, and may be called an indifference to worldly things (nirveda).Is indeed apprehended: [first explanation] that is, it can indeed be imagined even within one’s own experience, as at a time when all desire for some particular sensual object, such as food, as ceased.1Others, on the other hand, imagine that the basic emotional state [of the peaceful] is a cessation of all states of mind (or thought-trends). But if the absence of desire is understood as a pure negation (prasajya- pratisedha) and means the absence of all states of mind, it could not be called an emotional state ( bhâva) at all; whereas if it is understood as a limitational negative (paryudäsa), it will fit in with our position.Others consider the statement of Bharata:The emotions arise from peace, each from its peculiar cause,and when the cause has ceased, they melt back into peace,3and on this basis say that the peaceful (sänta) is the basic nature common to all the rasas and that its basic emotional state is that state where no specific state of mind has yet arisen. This view is not far removed from ours.4 The difference is one of prägabhäva (the non­existence of something before its origination) and pradhvamsäbhäva (the non-existence of something after it has been destroyed). What is correct is to speak of [indifference to worldly things as] the posterior non-existence of [sensual] desires “because,” as has been said, “we never see a man born without desire.”*Is indeed apprehended [second explanation:] The sage [Bharata] himself accepted it in saying, “sometimes peace,” etc.6 Nor is there any need to describe its final stage, which, because of its complete cessation of action, could have no symptoms (anubhâvas) and so could not be [aesthetically] perceived.7 In its final stage we could say of the erotic too that it cannot be described.8 But in the previous stage [of the peaceful] there are activities of rules and restraints in their various forms—as is indicated by the [ Yoga-] sûtras: “The mind’s pure flow of peace comes from one’s [repeated] will [to suppress thoughts of sense§ 3.26 a L ]"},{"pageNumber":537,"pageContent":"3.; Lobjects]\" ( YogaS. 3.10) and “In the intervals [of trance] various worldly cognitions arise because of old predispositions” ( YogaS. 4.27)9—or, in the case of men like Janaka.10 even though they were men of peace, one could have observed such activities as reigning over a kingdom. So there exist symptoms (anubhävas) and transient states (vyabhicärins) which can be imagined among rules and restraints, from which this [rasa of peace] can indeed be [aesthetically] apprehended. If it be objected that it is not apprehended because it has novibhävas, we deny the charge. It is apprehended; so there must be vibhàvas. Its vibhâvas (situations which reveal it) are such as the fruition of a character’s former good deeds, his being favored by God, his close acquaintance with books treating of spiritual secrets and with men who are devoid of desire.In this way we have demonstrated the existence of the vibhâvas, anu­bhävas, and vyabhicärins [of the peaceful] and have shown its sthäyin.1. Most of us are not sufficiently enlightened to experience nirveda in its full extent, but we can all imagine it by analogy with the partial or specific nirveda that everyone occasionally experiences. 2. The distinction between prasajyapratisedha and paryudäsa is frequently discussed in the commentaries on Panini; see Mahäbhäsya 1.1.43,, 1.2.4, 1.4.57. Basically the first means a verbal negation, as in the sentence “One must not bring brahmins\" (brähmanä na netavyâh, where na modifies the verb-form netaxryâh), whereas the second means a nominal negation, as in the sentence \"One must bring non-brahmins”(abràhmanà netavyâh. where the negative a- modifies the noun brâhmanàh). But more than this lies in the distinction. A prasajyapratisedha is purely negative; it refers to nothing positive. A paryudäsa, on the other hand, refers to positive as well as negative. Abràhmanà netavyâh means that one is not to bring brahmins but one is to bring others. These others, it is implied, have some properties similar to those of brahmins, for example humanity, for the sentence obviously implies that we are to bring men who are not brahmins, not that we are to bring horses or cattle. Thus the doctrine arises that a paryudäsa always implies a certain similarity of the enjoined entity to the forbidden entity. Now to come to Abhinava’s point in the present discussion. To interpret trsnäksaya (= trsnäbhäva) as a prasajyapratisedha results really in a self-contradiction. There can be no happiness, in fact no emotion at all, in something purely negative. One is not happy in not desiring; one is happy in non-desire, a positive state that is similar to desire in being an emo­tion but different from desire in not haveing sensual pleasures for its objects.3. BhNÉ Vol. l,.p. 335. This forms part of the interpolated sänta passage at the end of Book 6. Even Abhinava, in whose version of the Nâtyasâstra they occur, may have realized they were not composed by Bharata himself. Like other insertions in BhNÉ the section is prefaced by the words atràryâh. On"},{"pageNumber":538,"pageContent":"523a similar preface (Vol. 1, p. 327) Abhinava says (in Abh.), “These äryä verses are to be taken together. They were recited by earlier teachers as a definition. The sage inserted them in the appropriate place to serve as a summary (tä età hy âryà ekapraghattakatayâ pürväcaryair laksanatvena pathitâ muninä tu sukhasamgrahâya nivesitâh). For a further discussion of the nature of such verses see Kane HSP p. 17. 4. The similarity wouid lie in the conceptionof nirveda as a positive emotional state. 5. NyäyaS. 3.1.24, where the fact is taken as evidence of the previous existence of the soul. The point here is that the calm state before any of the eight sthäyibhävas arise does not belong to any observable human. If the peaceful is to be achieved by the exhibition of its sthäyibhäva, we must take that sthäyibhäva to be the non-existence of sensual desire after destruction, that being the only sort of trsnäbhäva that is observable and that can be represented. 6. The reference is to BhN$ 1.108 (Voi. 1. p. 38), which occurs in the following context: trailokasyäsya sarvasya nätyam bhâvânukîrtanam (= 1.107b): kvacid dharmah, kvacit kridä. kvacid arthah kvacic chamah (= 1.108a), kvacid dhäsyam, kvacid yuddham. kvacit kämah, kvacid vadhah (= 1.108b). “The theater is a representation of the bhävas of all three worlds. In some plays [one will find] dharma\\ in some, delight: in some, material advantage; in some, peace: in some laughter; in some, war; in some, love; in some, slaughter.” Clearly the beginning of the list is a reference to the four aims of man: dharma, käma, artha, moksa. So the word bhäva should be interpreted very generally as the states or activities or occupations of the whole world. Bharata recognizes that moksa, or àânti which leads thereto, is a fit subject to be treated in a play. But in com­menting on these verses in his Abh. Abhinava goes further. He identifies the items listed with the dramatic bhävas (emotions) which underlie the various rasas and so would ascribe to Bharata recognition of sänta as a rasa. It is this view which he now follows in his second interpretation of Änanda's words “and'the peaceful is indeed represented as a rasa.\" 7. This is one of sev­eral passages where Abhinava seems to be directly refuting Dhanika- In his Avaloka on DR 4.35 Dhanika. says, “We deny that sama can be a sthäyin in a play, for a play must of necessity be performed and sama is not amenable to performance, because it consists in the dissolution of all activity” (sarva- thä nätakädäv abhinayätmani sthâyitvam asmäbhih samasya nesyate. tasya samastavyäpärapravilayarüpasyäbhinayäyogät). P. V. Kane has shown that Dhanika and Abhinava were contemporaries (HSP pp. 236-237). But it is possible that the view expressed by Dhanika and refuted by Abhinava goes back to some older source. 8. In the ultimate stage of sexual love all percep­tion ceases in the pleasure of the climax. Compare Brhadäranyaka Upanisad 4.3.21: \"Just as a man in the embrace of a beloved woman knows nothing outside or inside, ” From the woman’s point of view compare Amaru 101 (by the poetess Vikatanitambä; see SRK 572) “But when within his arms, I can’t remember who he was or who I was or what we did or how.” 9.

And it is not proper to include it in the heroic because that differs by its being based on false notions of self, while this is found only in a form where egoism is set at rest. And if we were to imagine a unity of the two despite the existence of this distinction, we might just as well imagine a unity of the heroic and the cruel. There is no contradiction if we make a distinction in this fashion: that when certain states of mind such as the heroism of compassion and the like are entirely without egoism, they form a vari­ety of the peaceful; otherwise they form a variety of the heroic. It is thus established that there exists a rasa of peace. Nor when we insert into it, in a work, a naturally obstructive rasa, if we do this with the intervention of a neutral rasa, will there be obstruction, as in the work to which we have just referred.L But, says an objector, there is nothing in this [state of peace­fulness] to appeal to the heart; so it cannot be something that is rel­ished (rasyamâna). We answer: who can say it is not [something to be relished], when we have already said that “it is indeed [aesthetically] apprehended”? But the objector may continue: “Granted it is appre­hended, stiff, it is not something that everyone admires.” At this rate, we reply, as the erotic is not admired by men devoid of desire, the erotic too will have to be dropped from the list of rasas.1 So our author says, Even if, etc. Then, considering the possibility that the peaceful might be simply the heroic in which a religious element is prominent, he says, And it is not proper, etc. Because th at: By “that” he means the heroic.

The sense of the word ca (“and”) is api (“although” ) , 2 i.e., although they are diametrically opposed by the one’s consisting in desire and the other’s consisting in desirelessness. Between the heroic and the cruel, on the other hand, there is no such diametric opposition, for they have this in common that they are both useful in the pursuit of religion, wealth, and sensual pleasure.3But, it may be asked, what shall we call the heroism of compassion? Is it the heroism of religion, or the heroism of generosity? It is neither; it is simply another name for the peaceful. For the sage [Bharata] says that there are only three kinds of heroism according to tradition:Brahma said that the heroic is of three kinds: the heroism of generosity,the heroism of religion, and the heroism of war. [BhNÉ 6.79]So our author says, when certain states of m ind such as the heroism of com passion and th e like. 4 By the word ädi (“and the like”) he anticipates an objection that the peaceful, insofar as it takes the form of revulsion ( jugupsä) from objects of sense, might be included in the loathsome (bibhatsä). But that [viz., revulsion] is a transient state ( vyabhicârin) of the peaceful and does not become a basic emotion (sthâyin) because in the final stage of the peaceful it is eradicated.The author of the Candrikä has said that the rasa of peace should not be used as the topic [i.e., as the predominant rasa] of a major work.5 We shall not discuss the matter here because its discussion belongs elsewhere. Suffice it to say that as the rasa of peace leads to m oksa, which is the highest aim of man, it is the most important of all the rasas.6 This has been stated by my teacher Bhattatauta in his Kävya- kautuka and, with full discussion of the arguments for and against, by myself in my commentary on that work.7 For the present this is enough. 11. Abhinava is a bit carried away here by the heat of the argument. It is true that different persons have a special liking (hrdayasamv&da) for different rasas. In Abh. Voi. 1, p. 339, lines Uff. Abhinava speaks of the special liking that enlightened persons have for the peaceful, adducing BhNÉ 27.58 in support (tusyanti tarunäh. käme moksesv atha viräginah). But to say that the erotic is not admired by men devoid of desire, while it leads to a rhetorically effective reply here, goes against what Abhinava says elsewhere. On 2.7 he has told us that even as ascetic is struck by the charm of the erotic and his remarks on 3.40 will be in the same spirit: “A man devoid of desires does not misapprehend the bhâvas.

A bhinava's interpretation is th a t out of dayd- tnm. dfiarmavfra, and ddnavira the first, as being without egoism, is always equivalent to sdnta T h e la tte r two, as being possessed of egoism, are always varieties of vim. He proves his point by a quo tatio n from B harata. T h e word odi in dayävirädinäm is now free to refer to any other ciltavrtti th a t is free of egoism.

This fine passage from some lost kâxrya is also quoted by Mammata (7, ex. 334-335). It comes from a description of a battle, where the dead warriors are pictured as being led to Indra’s heaven by the apsarases who hover over battle fields for that purpose and who point out to the warriors amid their new luxury the mortal bodies which they have left behind. “Their breasts were scented\": the scent comes from the garlands of the apsarases who are embracing them. The fault of tautology is avoided by the use of synonyms: bähumadhya and bhujäntaräla, suranganâ and lalanâ, upavïjyamâna and sam- vijita.[ § 3.27 AL To confirm: he means, in the minds of students. The word even shows that the matter is well known so far as large works are concerned.On bodies soiled w ith dust: the adjectives indicate how far re­moved and how difficult to imagine [as their own]1 these bodies were. And yet, by the phrase “look upon their bodies\" we see that the war­riors make the common correlation of body and self and so have been able to identify these bodies with themselves. Thus both [rasas] are given a single base, for otherwise, if they occupied different bases, there would be no obstruction to be avoided.But it may be objected that the only rasa in the passage is the heroic, not the erotic or the loathsome and that what we have is love and loathing appearing as transient states (vyabhicärins) in the heroic. That may well be, but the passage will still serve as an example of the matter at issue. It is (to allow] for this (objection] that our author adds [the qualifying clause] or of th eir elem ents. By “their elements” he refers to their sthâyibhâvas.2T he heroic rasa: What our author has in mind is this. We under­stand the energy and other [heroic] qualities belonging to these [war­riors] from the phrase “the heroes [looked down on] their bodies.” From this understanding we perceive [the heroic] in both agent and object as they run through the syntax of the whole sentence. Hence the heroic, although it is not explicitly expressed in the middle [of the two other elements] does in fact [implicitly] intervene.3 11. The expression asambhävanäspada is strangely elliptical and one sus­pects that some word like svâbhimâna or sviyatva has dropped out before it. I have translated according to BP. 2. The sthâyibhâvas of s'rngära and btbhatsâ are rati and jugupsâ. Here they could be regarded as vyabhicärins of vira. 3. The objection that Abhinava has in mind is clear enough. His"},{"pageNumber":544,"pageContent":"529removal of it, though, would be difficult to understand without the BP or the commentators on Mammata. The objection is that the word vtrdh occurs only at the end of these verses, whereas the suggestion of the loathsome comes in the first adjective compound and the suggestion of the erotic in the sec­ond adj tive compound. So how can one speak of the intervention of vira? The solution is this. We are told at the end of the sentence that “the heroes looked down on their dead bodies.” From this we understand the heroism that attaches to these warriors and to the bodies they have lost in battle. The remainder of the sentence consists mostly in adjective compounds, one set describing the dead bodies, the other set-describing the revived heroes. Now adjectives in Sanskrit are said to give rise to two cognitions: the first, of a property; the second, of a substance to which the property can belong. The doctrine is connected with the fact that there is almost no formal difference in Sanskrit (as there is in English) between an adjective and a noun; every Sanskrit adjective can function as a noun. In the sentence under discussion the first adjective compound, in its adjectival force (visesanatayä) gives us a suggestion of the loathsome. But right after this, by its reference to the sub­stance (visesyatayä), viz., bodies, it gives us a suggestion of the heroic which attaches to those bodies. We then come to the second adjective compound, which gives us visesanatayä an immediate suggestion of the erotic, followed by a suggestion visesyatayä of the heroism attaching to its substance, viz., heroes. Such is the succession of rasas based on the order in which the words of the poem are heard. But this succession can occur only on the second or further hearing of the poem, for we must have heard the final half verse before the adjectives can furnish these heroic suggestions. So the succession may be given in the order in which one construes the words of the poem. In mentally construing, one places the subject first and the object after. By so doing we shall get the succession sriigära, viro, bibhatsä, viro, etc. In either case vira intervenes.§ 3.28 A ]K One should pay careful attention everywhere to obstruction and to the absence of obstruction in this manner; but especially in the erotic, for it is the most delicate.A The man of taste (sahrdaya)1 should pay careful attention, in accordance with the above definitions, to obstruction and to the ab­sence of obstruction, both in large works and elsewhere; but especially"},{"pageNumber":545,"pageContent":"530in dealing with the erotic.

The word vineyân, which we have here translated “audience,” for it often has that meaning, in its literal sense means \"those to be instructed or improved.\" Both Änanda and Abhinava emphasize the literal sense. We have taken the word vâ (“or\") to express an alternative between attracting the attention of the audience and giving beauty to the poem. Abhinava takes it, less naturally, as expressing an alternative to all the methods of avoiding obstruction that have been previously described.A That elements of the erotic should come in touch with a rasa that is naturally obstructive to the erotic will not be a fault, not only when the [aforesaid) rul for avoiding obstruction are applied; because it will also not be a fault when done in order to attract the attention of the audience-to-be-improved (vineyân), or to give beauty to the poem. For such an audience, being attracted by elements of the erotic rasa, will more readily receive instruction for its improvement. For the sages have transmitted [rules for] entertainments such as plays, which take the form of instruction in good conduct, for the specific purpose of benefitting persons who need improvement. Furthermore, since the"},{"pageNumber":547,"pageContent":"erotic has a delight that charms all people, the introduction of elements of the erotic into a poem will furnish an addition to its beauty. So even if done in this way, the introduction of elements of the erotic into a rasa that is naturally opposed to it will not be obstructive.

The verse has already been quoted and discussed by Abhinava; see 3.1 g L.L This being th e case: that is, since the erotic appeals to everyone. [Comment on the Kärikä.) To it: that is, to the erotic. In rasas, such as the peaceful, which are opposed to the erotic, a touch that bears on elements of the erotic is not a fault. Vibhâvas and anu- bhävas, even if they belong to another rasa, can be described by some such turn of phrase as has [elsewhere] made them belong to the erotic. As in a prayer of my own composition:O moon-crested lord of my life, at your sudden touch after deep pain of separation, my consciousness,like a puppet carved from a moonstone, melts and melts away.1For in this verse even the vibhâvas and anubhävas of the peaceful are described by an erotic turn of speech.2 The syntax of the Kärikä is this. “[A touch of the erotic] is not a fault if done in order to beautify the poem so as to attract the audience-to-be-improved.” The word vä (“or”) distinguishes this as a single alterantive [to the other methods described in 3.24-27].[Comment on the Vrtti] Our author interprets in the saune way [as we have just done], saying, n o t only when, etc.3 The following will explain his use of the word vä: Methods of avoiding obstruction, such as the avoidance of overdevelopment, etc, have been mentioned above; [Now] one may introduce obstructive elements for the beauty of the poem in order to attract the attention of the audience-to-be-improved, and not only [utilize] the methods above mentioned.

But an objector may say that a poem is something playful like a game; how can we talk of its giving instruction, a function that belongs to Vedic texts? It is with thoughts of this objection that he speaks of good conduct. By “sages” he means Bharata and others. We have already described how plays and poems educate us in the manner of a wife, by means of pleasure, as opposed to sacred texts and history, which instruct us in the manner, respectively, of a master or a friend.5 So we shall say nothing on the subject here out of fear of repeating ourselves.But is it only by describing the mbhävas as if they belonged to the erotic that one can attract the attention of the audience-to-be- improved? No,.there is another way, which our author describes by saying, F urtherm ore, etc.6 By an addition to its beauty, he means it will strengthen, or render more beautiful, particular figures of speech such as similes. For it is said that “the properties productive of beauty in a poem are the gunas; the causes of an addition to this beauty are the figures of speech.” 7“A tipsy girl”: What is being described in this verse is the tran­sience of all things and this is a vibhâva of the peaceful. This vibhäva has not been expressed by any erotic turn of phrase. Rather, by the word “truly” the statement enters directly into the listener’s heart, as though the speaker had said, “I am not proclaiming any false infatu­ation for indifference to the world, but I am teling you that life, for which all these things are sought, is itself transient.” In this statement the unsteady glance of a tipsy girl, which is an element referable to the erotic insofar as the glance can be considered either a vibhâva or an anubhâva,8 is used as a simile for transiency. For everyone takes delight in the sidelong glance of his beloved and so the hearer, who is to be improved, being started by this delight, will be led on to understand the true nature of things in an indirect way, just as a child is led on to take medicine by one’s putting sugar on his tongue, and so will end up in a state of disenchantment with worldly things.9 1§ 3.30 L ]1.

Änanda certainly contrasts the per- mision furnished by the present Kârikâ with the permissions extended under the different circumstances mentioned in 3.24-27. But it does not follow that he took the word vä to set the present permission off as a single alterna­tive. In fact, the pasage “Furthermore,” etc. (him ca, text p. 399, line 2ff.) shows clearly that he took kävyasobhäriham as an alternative to vineyân un- mukhikartum. But Abhinava noticed a logical fault that would ensue from taking vineyân unmukhikartum and kävyasobhäriham as separate alteratives. He was also aware that another commentator, presumably his bète noire the Candrikâkâra, had taken the natural interpretation. To exculpate Änanda from the fault and to get in a blow against the earlier commentator he forces on Änanda an interpretation which Änanda did not intend. 4. There are many different readings of the text. For labhyete [Kashi ed.] one must cer­tainly read labhyate [KM ed.], of which kävyasobhä will be the subj t. Before labhyate one should probably read kvacit (so BP ; KM reads kecit, which is senseless), which we have translated as “ever.\" Thus appears the logical diffi­culty which has spurred Abhinava to his unnatural interpretation of vä. If one takes the natural interpretation, as did “the comments of others,\" it would be logically possible for a poem to aim at kävyasobhä without the alternative of attracting the audience; and it would be possible to use any one of the pre­viously mentioned methods of avoiding obstruction without any intention of making the poem beautiful. 5. Cf. 1.1 e L (near end) and 3.10-14 f L (near beginning). 6. Here we have a second unnatural interpretation, provoked by the first. If the word vä does not contrast kävyasobhäriham with vineyân unmukhikartum, we must find some explanation of the passage “furthermore, etc.” other than its natural meaning. Its natural meaning is that the intro­duction of erotic elements not only attracts the audience, but furthermore may add to the beauty of the poem. So Abhinava twists the meaning into the following. Not only does the introduction of erotic elements by treating the vibhävas of sänta as if they were vibhävas of irrigarti beautify the poem so as to attract the audience; but furthermore, an introduction of erotic elements can strengthen an “addition to beauty,” that is, a figure of speech [alankära, called an addition to beauty—éobhâtiéaya—because it causes an increase of beauty) and such figures of speech too will attract the audience. 7. The quotation is from Vâmana 3.1.1-2. 8. The sidelong glance of a tipsy girl isan uddipanavibhäva (stimulative factor) of srhgära.

Änanda: erotic elements may be introduced into an opposite rasa such as the peaceful, not only by means of the safeguards above mentioned (e.g., by inserting a neutral rasa between the two, etc.), but also when the purpose is (1) to attract the audience’s at­tention, or (2) to beautify the poem. He quotes the verse “Truly fair women” (satyam manoramâ rämäh) as an example of (2). Abhinava: erotic elements may be introduced into an opposite rasa such as the peaceful not only by the safeguards above mentioned, but also when one wishes to beautify the poem in order to attract the attention of the audience. This may be done (1) by a turn of phrase that expresses a vibhäva, etc., of the peaceful as if it were a vibhäva, etc., of the erotic. As an example he quotes his own verse “0 moon- crested lord\" (tvarn candracüdam). Or it may be done (2) by using erotic elements in a figure of speech. As an example of (2) he refers to the verse “Truly fair women,\" which employs in its second half the simile “unsteady as the glance of a tipsy girl.” Note that in method ( 1 ) srngâra is so fused with éànta that it cannot be eliminated without damaging the éànta; whereas in method (2), as may be seen from the example, it is not quite fused and, even if it were eliminated, no harm would be done to the éànta. For example, one could change the second half of the quoted verse to read kintu padmapalàéa- sthajàlalolam hi jivitam and the éànta would remain unaffected although the srngâra would be eliminated.§ 3.31 A ]K Knowing thus the subject of obstruction and the avoidance of obstruction among the rasas and the like, a good poet never finds himself in difficulties.A Knowing thus, that is, in the manner set forth just above, the subject of mutual obstruction and the avoidance of such obstruction among rasas and the like, that is, among rasas, bhävas, rasäbhäsas and bhäväbhäsas, a good poet, that is, one who possesses a high degree of genius in the area of poetry, never finds himself in difficulties in writing poetry."},{"pageNumber":551,"pageContent":"[ § 3.31 LL Summing up the foregoing, he states the practical benefit of the whole topic: K nowing th u s, etc.A As the usefulness has thus been shown of studying obstruction and its avoidance in the rasas and the like, it is now stated that in the study of the suggestive factors, viz., the denoted and the denotative elements within the same area, there is the same [usefulness].K The putting together of denoted and denotative elements with propriety so far as the rasas and the like are concerned is the chief task of a great poet.A The putting together of denoted elements, that is, the par­ticulars of a plot, and denotative elements, that is, the words which denote these particulars, with propriety so far as the rasas and the like are concerned, is the chief task of a great poet.

The point has already been made in the First Chapter, where it was said that “just this meaning [viz., the suggested meaning] is the soul of poetry” (1.5 K).1. Being a great poet is actually the result of composing words and meanings in a manner appropriate to the nwas. But the phrase used in the Kärikä'speaks of the poet as a factor already given (siddha), viz., as the agent of such composition.§ 3.33 A ]'A To show that this composition of poetry with the ultimate purpose of [producing] rasas and the like was well known to Bharata and other [ancient authors], the following is said:K The appropriate usage of words and meaning so as to conform to the rasas and the like is the basis for setting up the two sets of vrttis.A [This is so,] because usage (vyavahära) may be called vrtti (operation, employment). Of these [two sets], that which is based on"},{"pageNumber":553,"pageContent":"538the appropriate use of expressed meanings (väcya) in conformity with the rasas is the set of vrttis called kaisiki, etc.; that which is based on the appropriate use of expressors (vâcaka, i.e. words) is the set called upanägarikä, etc.1 The vrttis, when introduced for the ultimate purpose of [producing] rasas and the like, lend a special beauty to a play or poem, for the rasas and the like of both these [vrttis] form the very life [of a play or poem]. Such elements as the plot are merely its body.[ § 3.33 A1. For kaisiki, etc., see above, 3.6g L, note 1; for upanägarikä, etc., see 1.1a A, note 4. It is natural enough to regard upanägarikä, etc., to be based on väcaka, as the members of this set are characterized by specified amounts and types of compounding and alliteration, both of which belong to the category of expressors rather than expressed. The characterizing of kaisiki, etc., as based on väcya is more artificial and would be hard to justify in detail. One can best explain it as due to a desire for symmetry.L This [composition]: viz., such as we have described. By the expression and o ther in “Bharata and other [ancient authors],” he implies that vrttis such as parasi are given in works on figures of speech (alankârasâstresu).1 O f bo th these: He means, of both sets of usage which we call vrttis. T he very life: When Bharata says, “The vrttis are the sources of poetry,” 1 2 he is telling us that they must be based on plots that are appropriate to the rasas and this implies that the rasas are their very life.3 And Bhämaha and others have said that those usages that we call the sabdavrttis (the vrttis dependent on words) have their life in the use that they may be to the rasas. In Bhâmaha’s words:People will put to use the meaning of a sentence if it is mixed with the sweet rasa of poetry. Children who have first licked honey can be brought to drink the bitter medicine.4T h eir body: Bharata says, “The plot is the body of the drama” (B tiN S 19.1). And the drama is just rasa, as we have said above.51. Parusä, komalä, etc., are varieties of alliteration defined by Udbha- ta (Indurâja 1.4ff. = Vivrti 1.6ff.). They are not mentioned by Bharata.2.

The four nâtyavrttis (kaiéikî, etc.) are vitally connected with the rasas since they must be appropriate to the different rasas. So when Bharata says that these vrttis are the sources (or mothers) of poetry, he means that the rasas suggested by these vrttis are the source or essence of poetry. 4. Bhämaha 5.3.

If the expressed elements are wholly united with a rasa or the like, as a given body is united wholly [i.e., over its whole surface] with a light complexion, then just as that light complexion invariably appears to everyone whenever that body appears, so would the rdsa or the like appear together with the expressed elements to ev­eryone, to persons of no literary taste ( asahrdaya) as well as to persons of literary taste. And that is not so, as has been stated in the First Chapter [1.7 K \\.Or, it might be argued that the rasa-like nature of the expressed elements can be recognized,as the genuineness of jewels is recognized only by certain experts.3This too would be wrong, for when a jewel is recognized as genuine, the genuineness is seen to be nothing other than the very nature of the jewel. By this analogy the rasas, etc., would be seen as nothing other than the expressed elements such as the rribhâvas, anubhâvas and the like. But this is not so, for no one supposes that the rasas are nothing more than the vibhâvas, anubhâvas, and vyabhicârins. Accordingly, as"},{"pageNumber":555,"pageContent":"540the perception of the rasas is impossible without a perception of the vibhävas, etc., the two are distributed into the positions of cause and effect; and that is why an interval must be posited between them. This interval, it has been said,is not noticed because of its short duration; and that is why the rasas when suggested are of unperceived interval.4[ § 3.33a A1. Here begins an immense digression, 56 pages of text in length. What prompts it seems almost accidental. The Kärikä has spoken of the close relation between rasas and vrttis. This leads Änanda to consider the rela­tion between rasa on the one hand and väcya and väcaka on the other; and this leads to a full-dress discussion of vyanjakatva (suggestiveness, suggestive power of operation) in all its varieties. Many points are brought up here that are nowhere mentioned in the Kärikäs and that the Vrtti failed to discuss at the beginning of Chapter Three or in Chapter One, in either of which places it would seem to have been more appropriately brought in. But one may over­look the fault of placement in view of the brilliance of the discussion. 2. By guna the objector means an essential or inalienable property. Life is not a guna in this sense; it is an activity that inheres in the body for a limited period of time. 3. These words form a half sloka and must be a quotation from some other author. 4. The printed texts misplace the opening quotation mark. The quotation begins with läghavän na prakâéate and extends through rasädayah, thus forming the last three quarters of a Moka. The source of the Moka is not apparent. If the author is Änanda himself, this would be the only instance in the book where he introduces a sanksepasloka that is incomplete. On the other hand, one hesitates to ascribe such an explanation of rasadhvani to some earlier author.L Should be spoken of as a relation o f quality and sub­stance: Because the two appear so intimately connected, they should be spoken of as property (dharma) and property possessor (dharmin). R ath er than: the idea is that there is no interval between them. In th e F irst C hapter: it was stated in the passage which reads: “[d/mmi] is not to be found by a mere knowledge of grammar and dictionaries” (1.7 K).But the statement that the property of a substance always appears to everyone when the substance appears is not without exception. The special property of a ruby that we call its genuineness is not invariably apparent to everyone when the ruby is seen. In order to state this"},{"pageNumber":556,"pageContent":"541objection he says, it m ight be argued, etc. He then refutes it with This too would be wrong, etc. In other words, in the syllogism “(a property always appears to everyone when the substance appears,] because it is a property” we must insert the proviso “so long as the property is of an obvious nature.” And the genuineness of a gem, un­like its color, is not obvious, for its nature is well concealed. Now some persons have interpreted the refutation to imply that [in the authors opinion] the rasas are of an obvious nature. But our teacher has com­mented as follows. In denying the nature of quality and substance in the passage beginning “To this we reply,” he is arguing as follws. If the rasas are properties (dharmäh) of the expressed elements, one of two alternatives must follow: they must be like [obvious properties] such as color, or they must be like [hidden properties] such as the genuineness of a ruby. The first is impossible because the rasas do not appear to everyone. The second is impossible because they do not appear as in­separable [from their substance] as does the genuineness of jewels. The reason here given [for rejecting the second alternative] can be applied with equal force against the first alternative. Our author states the second alternative and its refutation in the passage running from “One might argue” through the words “But this is not so.”He now substantiates what he has said: for no one [supposes], etc. Accordingly, etc.: as the rasas, etc., are not perceived as properties of the expressed elements and as the perception of the expressed meaning never fails to be helpful [to their perception], we must posit a succession, for of two simultaneous entities the one cannot aid [in the perception of the other]. But this succession is not perceived by sensitive persons, as has been remarked above (1.10 L), because of their lively imagination (bhävanä) and their literary practice (abhyäsa), although otherwise it would be. As for him1 who has already said that a rasa is itself a perception of a special kind, he too may speak of the perception of a rasa by treating the rasa as a vyapadesin,2 as we have already said elsewhere.31. By “him” Abhinava means himself. 2. For an explanation of vyapa- desivadbhäva (= vyapadesivattva) see 3.6 g L, note 5. The rasas in Abhinava’s opinion do not qualify for the designation pratiti-visaya, as they are forms of pratili itself. But one may speak loosely of rasasya pmtiti as one speaks of Rahoh sirah. 3. See above, 2.4 L and note 39 thereon.§ 3.33 a L ]"},{"pageNumber":557,"pageContent":"[ § 3.33 b AA An objection is raised that the word, as conditioned by con­text, etc., gives rise to our perception of both the expressed and the suggested meanings at the same time. So how can we hypothesize a succession of these meanings? Our reflection on its expressed mean­ing is not a prerequisite of a word’s suggestiveness, for the rasas can be suggested by the words (or sounds) of songs or the like; and no reflection on the expressed meaning of these [words] is needed first.To this we reply. We agree with the opionion that words as condi­tioned by context axe suggestive. But this suggestiveness is sometimes the result of their phonetic form and sometimes of their expressive (de­notative) power. In the case of those whose suggestiveness is bound to thieir denotative power, if the suggestion could arise without our per­ceiving what they denote and simply from our perceiving their phonetic form, their suggestiveness would no longer be bound to thieir denota- tive power. But if it is indeed bound to this [denotative power], it follows that our perception of the suggested meaning must necessarily be posterior to our perception of the denotative process. It makes no difference if the succession is too rapid to be noticed. If a rasa or the like could be perceived by means of the mere word as conditioned by context, without any perception of its expressed meaning, hearers who know the context 'but are themselves ignorant of the relation between the word and its expressed meaning would also have this perception of rasa from a mere hearing of a poem. Moreover, if the two mean­ings occurred simultaneously, the perception of the expressed meaning could not aid [in producing the suggested meaning]; whereas if it does aid, it cannot be simultaneous. Even in the case of those words (or sounds) of songs and the like whose suggestiveness is brought about by our perception of their phonetic form, there must be a succession in which perception of the form comes first and perception of the sug­gested [roso] comes after. But this succession of activities of a word is not perceived in [the area] of the rasas and the like, which differ from any other meaning in that they do not contradict the expressed mean­ings. The succession is not perceived because the attachment (ghatanà) of the result [i.e., the attachment of a suggested meaning] to the word,"},{"pageNumber":558,"pageContent":"a result which can be brought about by no other means, occurs so swiftly.2§ 3.33 b L] 5431. Of the printed texts only that of Krishnamoorty gives the correct reading: avadhäritaprakaranänäm, which fits the context, in place of anava- dhäritaprakaranänäm, which does not. His reading seems to be based on the variant readings reported by the KM ed. and on his Moodabidre palm-leaf. 2. Abhinava understands the passage which I have translated in this last sentence very differently, as follows. “The succession is not perceived because the various styles (sarighatanä, that is, the phonetic form of the words and the qualities resulting from word-compounding, etc.), each of which produces its unique effect, bring about their effect so swiftly [that we are not aware that our perception of the rasa is preceded by our perception of the style and of the literal meaning].’’ I have rejected this interpretation, preferring what seems to have been the interpretation of the Candrikâ, for which Abhinava expresses heavy scorn at the end of his comment (see below). My reasons are that I can find no evidence of Änanda’s ever using ghatanä in the sense of saiighatanä, nor can I find any example where bhävin in such a compound as äsubhävin is used causatively. The interpretation of Abhinava leads to a very neat explanation of why the succession should be so swift, but I cannot believe that Änanda had any such explanation in mind in writing this passage. It goes against the whole tenor of his remarks on style (saiighatanä) under 3.5-9.L An objector may say: “We grant that rasas and the like are separate from the expressed meaning, but you yourself have said that no interval is perceived between the two. We would add that there is no valid reason for even hypothesizing such an interval. By induction from positive and negative examples we see that a perception of a rasa can arise without any perception of expressed meaning, as when it is brought about by the aid of mere sound in songs and the like where we have a meaningless succession of syllables (svaräläpa) without words. So the expressed meaning and the so-called suggested meaning or rasa appear at the same time through one and the same set of conditions (sämagri) and there is no use in assuming two operations, one of de­notation and one of suggestion.” Our author states this in the words, An objection is raised. Even where there is meaning to the words of a song, the understanding of that meaning is not necessary because we see that the rasa arises in accordance with the scale and mode, without regard to the suggested meaning. And although meaning may"},{"pageNumber":559,"pageContent":"544be present, it is not seen by everyone. Our author states this, say­ing, and no [reflection], etc. O f these [words]: viz., words of the song, etc. By the word ädi (“etc.”) he indicates the sounds of musical instruments, or of wailing, etc.W e agree: he has in mind that he has said, \"Where word or sense,\" etc.1 [Their suggestiveness] would no longer [be b o und to th eir denotative power]: for in that case the rasa would appear from the words of a poem as it does in songs without any understanding of the meaning of the words. But as this is not the case, we must admit that the words have a denotative power also. And as this denotation takes as its object the expressed meaning,2 we must admit that our perception of the expressed meaning occurs before [our perception of the rasa]. He says this in the words, B u t [if it is indeed bound], etc. This: viz. denotative power. D enotative process: i.e., denotative power. In other words, suppose even that the expressed meaning is not suggestive of the rasas, etc., and that our perception of them comes from the words (or sounds) themselves. Still, as the words necessarily rely on their denotative power as an aid in producing our perception of the rasas, it follows that the perception of the expressed meaning must come first.3But it might be argued that the denotative power plays no part here any more than it does in the words of a song; and that if there is no perception of rasa after a poem has been heard, the reason is the lack of the necessary cooperating causes such as the understanding of the context. Our author guards against this argument by saying, If [a rosa], etc. For one may ask just what an understanding of the context means. Is the context a reference to the help given by [the phonetic form of] other sentences, or to the expressed meaning connected with [the phonetic form of] other sentences? Even if one should understand both, the rasa will not arise without one’s understanding the literal sense of the central sentence. Them selves: what he has in mind are persons who might have had the mere context explained to them by someone else. And a man who would deny as a cause the perception of the expressed sense, a factor that can be shown to be a cause by positive and negative concomitance, and who would have recourse to the presence or absense of some unseen factor [to explain the occurrence or absence of rasa], is strengthening no argument except an argument in proof of his own perversity. This is the intention of the passage.But the objector may admit that the denoted sense is useful [to the production of the suggested sense] and still ask what purpose is[ § 3.33 b L"},{"pageNumber":560,"pageContent":"545served by adopting the theory of succession. A mere co-presence (of the suggested meaning], characterized by (that meaning’s] being dependent on the same set of conditions (as the denoted meaning],4 can be the useful factor. Our author guards against this by saying, if [the two m eanings occurred] sim ultaneously, etc. He means that to call such an entity a helper when it could give no help would be merely the inventing of a name without any substance. Even the objector has admitted the priority of the useful factor. Our author states this by saying, Even in th e case of those w ords, etc. Our author’s intention is by this very example to prove the priority of our perception of the expressed meaning [to our perception of the suggestion].Now, if there is an interval [between the two perceptions] why is it not noticed? He addresses this question with the sentence. B u t this, etc. He states the nature of the interval to be a “succession of activ­ities”: succession of activities. The two activities (k n y e) are the perceptions of the ‘expressed and the suggested meanings, or, if you will, of the denotative operation and of the suggesting or hinting oper­ation. The temporal succession of these activities is not apprehended. The phrase in th e ra sa s and th e like refers to the area where [this lack of apprehension is found]. Of what sort are these rasas, etc.? By saying that they are different from other, expressed, meanings, that is, from any other meaning that is expressed, as they are altogether inexpressible, he implies that there must be an interval. And yet they do not contradict the expressed meaning, for if they contradicted it, the interval would be noticed. He states the reason why this [interval] is not'noticed in the form of a locative of cause, “... äsubhävinisu,\" which itself contains a further cause in “ananyasädhyatatphalaghatanä- su.”s Here ghatanäh6 refers to what were called mädhurya (sweetness), etc., in the section where the gunas (qualities) were described. They are tatphaläh, that is, they have perception of the rasas as their result and they are anyäsädhyäh, that is to say, whatever is accomplished by each such ghatanâ is “not other,\" is sui generis, for one will not get a perception of the tragic (koruna), for example, from a ghatanâ of strength (ojas).In other words, the interval is not noticed because, in a poem that possesses the gunas, style (sanghatanâ) is used without any confu­sion of object [i.e., each style is used to produce a specific rasa]. But granted that there is a precise distribution of styles, we may still ask why the interval is not noticed. Hence he says, “because [the sanghata- nâs] bring about [their effects] so swiftly.” The sense is that without§ 3.33 b L ]"},{"pageNumber":561,"pageContent":"546waiting for our understanding of the expressed meaning, they imme­diately set about building up the rasas, giving us a foretaste (äsväda) of them. This is as much as to say that as the rasas are suggested by style (sahghatanâ), the ground is laid for the relishing of a rasa at the very beginning of the appropriate style before our understanding of the meaning has come into play; and that it is on this account that the rasa, even at the later moment, after we have understood the expressed meaning and when the rasa has assumed its full flavor, does not appear to have arisen later [than our understanding). For wherever we have experienced a conclusion many times, the passage from understand­ing of the invariable rule to that conclusion goes unnoticed. Practice works such wonders that we can arrive at a conclusion by force of habit, without really paying attention, simply by being able to infer it. Thus, when we have by heart the universal law that where there is smoke there is fire, the only thing that is necessary [for the inference of fire] is the knowledge that the minor term has smoke; and this knowledge takes the place of the full “consideration” (parâmarsa).7 As soon as the knowledge of smoke has arisen and has been aided by our memory of the universal law, without any attention to contrary instances or any perception of agreement, we pass without noticing any interval to the knowledge of fire. So it is in this case too. But if the rasa were contradictory to the expressed meaning, or if the style (ghatanä) were inappropriate [to that rasa), the interval would be noticed.The author of the Candrikä, who simply repeats what the text says and who could easily fail to see an elephant in front of his eyes, com­ments as follows. “Since the ghatanä, that is, the formation, of the result of the word (or, of this result), namely the literal and suggested meanings, is produced by nothing else, that is, by no other power of the word.” We fail to see the slightest conception of the true meaning in this explanation. But let me not argue at length with an elder member of my family. 1[ $ 3.33 b L1. The reference is to 1.13 K. Abhinava does not here distinguish the Kärikäkära from the Vrttikâra. The point in his quoting this particular Kärikä seems to be that it takes for granted a knowledge of the context (prakardhädi- jnâna), since both iabda and väcyärtha suggest the pratïyamânârtha with the help of the context and other factors; see 1.13d A and note 2. 2. BP glossesväcyanisthä by vâcyavisayikâ, “and as this power takes as its object the ex­pressed meaning.” For nistha used in this sense see below, 4.2 a L and note 1;"},{"pageNumber":562,"pageContent":"547also Vakrokti. 1, vs. 125, Vrtti, lines 1-2: ity avinayânusthânanistham... abhi- dhiyamànam anaucityam àvahati. 3. The view that rasa can arise from the mere sound of words in a poem is here put forward only as an abhyupagama, a tentative concession for the sake of argument, and will be followed by Abhi- nava’s approved doctrine that “there is no origin of rasa without knowledge of the meaning of the sentence involved.” In other sections of the book, however, Abhinava comes close to holding the tentative view. Under 1.18 (p. 193), he speaks of alliteration, even without aid from the expression of meaning, as being suggestive of rasa. He says much the same in his comment on 3.3. We may perhaps bring the various expressions of his views on the matter into harmony by the following statement. In certain cases of the alliteration of gentle or harsh phonemes the mere hearing of the alliteration, even without accompanying knowledge of the expressed sense, prepares the proper atmo­sphere for the apprehension of a particular rasa. The clear apprehension of the rasa, however, comes only after the perception of the expressed sense. In other words, alliteration only cooperates with the knowledge of the expressed sense in bringing about rasäsväda and is not its principal cause. Compare the phrases äsütrito rasàsvâdah and pansphutäsvädayuktyo 'pi toward the end of the present section (Kashi text, p. 409, lines 2-3). 4. The same set ofconditions would be the particular word and its context, from which both the expressed and the suggested meanings arise. 5. Ananyasàdhyatatphala- ghatanäsv äsubhävinisu is interpreted as a locative of cause; cf. Pan. 2.3.36, Vârt. 6. It means, (they are not noticed] because their ghatanàs are swift act­ing. Then the substantive portion of the locative construction itself contains a cause of that cause. The ghatanàs are swift acting because each is capable of producing a unique result. 6. In what follows Abhinava takes ghatanà in an extended sense of sanghatanä (style). By it he understands not only style of alliteration and compounding, but the qualities (punas) such as sweetness, force, etc. He supposes that this “style\" gives us our first hint of the rusa to be suggested, a hint that is later rendered specific by our perception of the expressed meaning. 7. For the later doctrine of inference, see Ingalls, Mate­rials, pp. 32-33. The instrumental cause of the inference “this mountain has fire” is a knowledge of the universal law “where there is smoke there is fire.\" The operation (vyäpära) of this instrument takes the form of a consideration (paràmaréa) in the form “this mountain possesses smoke which is vyäpya by (i.e., included within the extension of) fire.” Now where we have often made the inference, Abhinava tells us, we can dispense with a certain amount of this process. Instead of the full consideration “panato 'yam vahnivyäpyadhüma- vdn,” all we need is the knowledge “this mountain has smoke” (panato 'yam dhümavän). The fact that the smoke is vahnivyâpya is supplied by memory and needs no attention to contrary instances (vijâtïyapranidhâna, e.g., to the absence of smoke in a locus of non-fire such as a lake) nor any perception of cases in agreement ( anusaranapratiti, e.g., “there is smoke in other loci of fire§ 3.33 b L ]"},{"pageNumber":563,"pageContent":"548such as a kitchen hearth'’). We jump immediately from \"there is smoke on this mountain\" to “there is fire on this mountain.”[ § 3.33 b LA In some instances the interval is perceived, as in our appre­hension of the type of suggested meaning that is similar to a reverber­ation. If in these cases too the question is asked why, we would give this explanation. First let us consider the type of suggested meaning similar to a reverberation in its subtype based on the power of meaning. Here we have two apprehensions, one of the expressed meaning and the other of the meaning implied by it. Since the latter is different in kind from any expressed meaning,1 these two perceptions are utterly dis­parate. Hence their relation to one another as cause and effect cannot remain hidden and their succession in time is obvious, just as it is in the Prakrit verses quoted in the First Chapter to illustrate an “under­stood” [i.e. suggested] sense.2 In such instances, because of the utter disparity of the expressed and suggested meanings our apprehension of the one cannot be confused with our apprehension of the other.Next let us look at the type of suggested meaning similar to a rever­beration in its subtype based on the power of words, as inMay these rays [or, may these cows] of the blazing sun engender in your purified selves unending bliss.[Mayüra, Süryasataka 9]3In verses such as this, where we have the verbal apprehension (éâbdï pratïtih)* of two senses (“rays” and “cows,” etc.), the apprehension of a relation of simile and base between these two senses, since there is no word [such as “like”] directly expressive of the simile, is something implied by the capability of the situation. Here too the temporal suc­cession of the apprehension of the suggested figure of speech to the apprehension of the expressed meanings is easily noticed.Now to look at suggestion where the suggested meaning similar to a reverberation is of the type based on the power of words and where a single word [rather than a whole sentence] acts as the suggestor. Here there is the attachment [to two nouns] of an adjective [e.g., jada] that is capable of two senses [\"helpless, wretched,” when modifying asmi and"},{"pageNumber":564,"pageContent":"549\"insentient, cool,” when modifying küpa] without any joining word (e.g. “like,” “and,” “although”). Although the attachment is non-verbal [as it is not denoted by a joining word], it is established by meaning.5 Just as in our previous example, the succession is here clearly marked. Here it is between the apprehension of the denoted meaning [“wretched,” as applied to the speaker] and the figure of speech [si ile], but only that, which is thereby implied.6 Although the apprehension [of the figure of speech] derives from meaning, it can be considered as based on the power of a word because it is initiated (prasävita) by the capability of a word (viz., jada] that can be attached'to two meanings.In suggestion of the type where the expressed meaning is unintended, the revelation of another meaning is preceded by an apprehension that the words take no notice of their proper objects. A succession is there­fore necessary. We gave no attention to the temporal succession of suggested to expressed meaning in this type for the very reason that the expressed meaning is [always] unintended here. Thus there is nec­essarily a succession from the expressed to the suggested meaning (of whatever type] just as there is a succession from the word that denotes to the meaning that is denoted, because in either case the latter is re­lated to the former as effect to cause. But the succession is sometimes noticed and sometimes not for the reasons above stated. 1§ 3.33 c A ]1. In 3.33b Änanda used the phrase abhidheyântaravilaksana (“different in nature from any directly expressed meaning”) to describe rasa. He uses it here to describe the suggestions of alankâradhvani and vastudhvani. Jacobi, interpreting the phrase to mean “that which cannot be expressed by any other words,\" felt that the phrase was properly used only in the first instance. In the present instance he recommended emending it to abhidheyavilaksanatayä. But the phrase does not have so restricted a meaning. 2. The dhvani of these Prakrit verses is anurananarüpavyangya, but it is not vivaksitânyapara- väcya. 3. The dhvani in this (and the next) example is both anuranana­rüpavyangya and vivaksitânyaparavâcya. See the discussion of the whole verse under 2.21 e A. 4. Verbal apprehension {éâbdïpratüih): what is meant is an understanding derived from a verbal expression, as opposed to ârthî pratïtih, an understanding which derives from an implication or suggestion. 5. The description will become clearer by reference to the verse prätum dhanair (“If fate will have it,” etc.) quoted under 3.1 d A. See also our note on that verse. 6. I have taken the simplest interpretation of the compound abhi- dheyatatsämarthya-. Abhinava gives a different interpretation; see below. The word matra (“but only that\") is intended to rule out the rasa, which is also suggested by the denoted meaning but which is not perceived to be posterior."},{"pageNumber":565,"pageContent":"'[ 5 3-33 c LL Where style (sanghatanä) plays no part in suggestion, the interval is perceived.1 He states this in the words, In som e instances. He then raises the question why there should be this difference when there is a suggested sense in all cases: If asked why, etc.Obvious: what lies back of this is the previous verse:Either a word or a sentence may serve as the suggestor in the type of dhvani where the literal sense is not intended and, of the other type, in that subtype where the suggested sense resembles a reverberation [3.1 K);for in this verse alliterative style and the like were not mentioned as suggestive factors. P rak rit verses: such as “Go your round freely, gentle monk” [1.4 b X], on which we have commented above.[W here we have the] verbal apprehension: the meaning is, although it is verbal.2 Expressive of th e simile: such as yathà, iva, etc. By th e capability of th e situation: as much as to say, by the capability of the sentence meaning.Having thus discussed [sequential suggestion] based on the power of words where the suggestion is revealed by a sentence, he goes on to discuss the type that is revealed by a single word: w here a single word acts as th e suggestor.An adjective: e.g., jada. A ttachm ent: e.g., the bringing it i grammatical agreement with the well and with the speaker.3The compound abhidheyatatsämarthyäksiptälankämmätrapratit' is to be analysed as: the two apprehensions of just the two figures of speech, namely that which is expressed and that which is implied by the capability of that.4 The succession between these apprehensions is clearly marked, that is, easily noticed. By saying “just,” that is, only, these two figures of speech, he indicates that in our apprehension of the rasa the temporal succession is not noticed.But now it appears to be contradictory that we should have here a figure that both derives from meaning and that is based on the power of a word. Being aware of this, he says, A lthough th e apprehension derives from m eaning, etc. The truth of the matter is that there is no contradiction. As we have already discussed the matter at length,5 we will not repeat ourselves here.O f th eir pro p er objects: The proper object of the word “blind” (andha) is a person whose sight has been destroyed.8 The being turned"},{"pageNumber":566,"pageContent":"551away (vaimukhya) from that object means the taking no notice of that object. W e gave no special atten tio n : sc. by describing [that aspect of the type] in the name that we assigned,7 because it could not even be suspected that the two apprehensions were simultaneous in this type.The rasas and the like are the life of those vrttis named kaisikf, etc., which form the plot element, and of those named upanägarikä, etc., [which form varieties of style,] because the use of any one of the vrttis of either set is limited to a particular area by these rasas and the like. This is the subject matter [of the K ärikä] and in connection with it, in order to prove that the rasas and the like are something over and above the expressed meaning, our author has furnished the above discussion of succession. He now sums up the discussion by saying, T hus, etc. We have first an apprehension of that which denotes, i.e., of a word, and only after that an apprehension of that which is denoted. As the master [Bhartrhari] has said: “Words furnish no meaning until they are objects of our apprehension” ( Vâk. 1.56); and again, “That is why, when we have not- understood the form [of the words], we ask ‘What did he say?’” ( Vâk. 1.57). Here too, just as with [inferences based on] universal concomitance, if we have made repeated use of the convention [that attaches a given meaning to a given word], we may not notice the succession. 1§ 3.33 c L J1. As Abhinava has just (3.33 b L) included under style (sanghatanâ) the qualities mâdhurya, ojas, etc., which are forerunners in all cases of rasa, this statement amounts to saying that where the suggestion is other then rasa, the interval is perceived. 2. Abhinava’s gloss serves to contrast the éâbdï pratitih of the two senses of the word with the ärthi pratiitih of the alankära. 3. aham: Abhinava takes the asmi of the verse as an indeclinable particle synonymous with aham. It is listed as such in the câdigana of Pan. 1.4.57. 4. In Abhinava’s gloss abhidheyam and äksiptam are neuter becausethey modify the neuter word mätram. BP explains that the expressed figure of speech is zeugma (dtpaka) because the adjective jada is applied to two substantives; and that the suggested figure of speech implied by the zeugma is simile. This is doubtless a correct explanation of Abhinava. But it seems doubful that Abhinava’s is a correct explanation of Ànanda. It is hard to see how Änanda could have regarded dipaka here as a directly denoted figure of speech when he has said (3.1 d .4) that the application of jada to küpa is suggested. 5. See 2.21 e L. 6. The example is taken from the versequoted under 2.1c. 7. What Abhinava means is that this type has been"},{"pageNumber":567,"pageContent":"557called avivaksitaväcya, not samlaksyakramavyangya, because the reference to temporal succession was not thought to be necessary in its nomenclature.§ 3.33 c LA After we have described the varieties of suggestion (dhvani) in this manner by means of the concept of suggestive power (vyanja- katva), an objector may take issue with us. “What is this suggestive power?” he may say. “(We put the question] because suggestive power is merely the revealing of a suggested meaning.1 If the being suggested (vyangyatva) of a meaning is dependent on suggestive power and if the proof of suggestive power depends on having a suggested meaning, the two concepts rest on each other. By such circular definitions nothing is really defined.”But we have already shown that the suggested meaning is something distinct from the expressed meaning; and then, as dependent upon that we established suggestive power. What is there to object to in this?But [the objector may continue:] “This much is true, that you have proved by your arguments the existence of something which is distinct from a given expressed meaning. But why should that something be called a suggested meaning? In fact, where it appears as the pre­dominant meaning [of the sentence] it would be reasonable to call it the expressed meaning because the sentence depends on it. That is why the operation of the sentence which reveals it must be denotative. What is the point of hypothesizing another power? Let us therefore say that the meaning which forms the object of the whole sentence is the primary expressed or denoted meaning. If we apprehend any other expressed meaning in the course of arriving at that object, its appre­hension will be merely a means to the apprehension [of the sentence meaning], just as the apprehension of word-meaning serves as a means to the apprehension of sentence-meaning.” 11. I follow the text as corrected by Krishnamoorty on the basis of his MB manuscript: him idam vyanjakatvam nâma / vyangyârthaprakâéanam hi vyanjakatvam / tad vyahgyatvam càrthasya vyanjakasiddhyadïnam vyahgyâ- peksayä ca----"},{"pageNumber":568,"pageContent":"§ 3.33 d L ]L At the beginning of Chapter Three is was stated that the nature of suggestion (dhvani) would be explained through [an analysis of] those factors which possess suggestive power. In summing up that subject now, despite the fact that the existence of suggestive power was already proved in Chapter One, he states an objection to its existence in order to fix its nature in the minds of his students by dealing with the subject all in one place. He begins with, A fter we have described, etc. A n objector: viz., a Mlmamsaka. W h at is this, etc.: the opinion about to be stated is that of the objector.A lready: that is, in Chapter One, in the passage where the non­existence of dhvani was refuted. So it is not the case that the suggested meaning is proved to exist by proof of the suggestors, a process that would be open to the charge of circular definition; because it was proved by other reasons. .This is what is meant. He puts it in the words, [then,] as dependent on th at, etc.B u t why should th a t som ething, etc.: We grant that there is a second meaning, [says the objector,] but if you give it the name of “suggested,” why could you not just as well give it the name of “expressed” (or “denoted\")? Or why not give the name of “suggested\" to what you consider to be the denoted? For a word’s denotative power (lit., its property of being a denotator] is nothing more than a word’s having a meaning in so far as that meaning is understood. Denotative power should extend just as far as denotation extends. And since that chief ipeaning [of the sentence], which you have therefore described as the annointed king of suggestion,1 stands at the limit of this extent, it is proper that the power of denotation should extend to it. Our author states this in the sentence, [In fact,] w here [it appears as th e predom inant m eaning], etc.[Of th e sentence] w hich reveals it: of that sentence which nec­essarily reveals this meaning which you consider to be the suggested meaning. M erely a m eans: by this one expression he refers to the school of Kumärila, the school of Prabhakara, and the school of the Grammarians. For according to Kumärila,In the working of these [varnas, phonemes] toward our understanding of the sentence meaning, it is a prerequisite that they convey a knowledge of the word meanings, just as the burning of fuel is a prerequisisite for cooking. [Élokavârttika, Vâkyâdhikarana, vs. 343]"},{"pageNumber":569,"pageContent":"554Thus [in his opinion] the meaning that is established as the final limit (tâtparyena) by the word-meanings that we understand from the in­dividual sounds is the sentence meaning and this is precisely what is denoted. In the view of the followers of Prabhäkara, the [denotative] operation is a long one, extending all the way to the sentence meaning, which is the “caused element” (nimittin, i.e., the result). In their opin­ion the individual word-meanings, which are the causal element, have a metaphysical reality, whereas in the opinion of the Grammarians they have not; that is the only difference between them [in this matter]. But we have explained this at length in Chapter One [1.4 b L] and shall not take the trouble to do so again. We confine our remarks here to show­ing what the text is referring to. It is to these three opinions that the words of the objector refer.1. The reference is to raso as “the soul of dhvani.\"[ § 3.33d LA To this we reply as follows. Where a word in denoting its own meaning gives us to understand some further meaning, is there a difference between its nature as denoter of its own meaning and its nature as cause of the understanding of the other meaning, or is there not? It cannot be that there is no difference, for the two operations are perceived to have different objects and to be of a different nature. Thus, the operation in which a word is denotative has for its object the word’s own meaning. The operation that is suggestive (gamaka) has for its object some other meaning. And the designation of the denoted and the suggested meanings as its own and as other cannot be rejected, because the former is apprehended as something connected with the word, while the latter is apprehended as something connected with that which is connected with the word. The denoted meaning is something directly connected with the word. The other meaning, being implied by the capability of the denoted meaning, is something connected with that with which the word is connected. If it were something directly connected with the word, we could not refer to it as something different. So between these two operations the difference in the object operated upon is perfectly clear."},{"pageNumber":570,"pageContent":"555The difference in the nature of the operation is equally clear. For the power of denoting is not the same thing as the power of suggesting, because we see that the sounds of a song or the like, although they are not denotative, may suggest such things as the rasas. The same point can be made from the fact that gestures and the like, which are not even sounds, are known to reveal particular meanings. Thus, a great poet in writing “Her face was bowed in shyness,” etc.,1 has shown how a particular gesture can reveal a meaning.Accordingly, both because of their difference of object and because of their difference of nature, a word’s power to denote its own meaning and its power to cause us to understand some other meaning are different. Now if there is a difference, then that other meaning, which we are led to understand by the inherent capability of the denoted meaning, cannot itself be called a denoted meaning. That it is the object of some activity of a word, however, we are quite willing to admit; but it is so as being suggested by the word, not as being denoted. And since we apprehend a second meaning [e.g., the purity of the village in the phrase “a village on the Ganges”] by the fitness of that meaning to the relation [viz., denotedness] of a well known denoter [e.g., the word “Ganges”], when that second meaning can be made the object of our apprehension by a different word [i.e., “purity”] denoting its proper object, it is right that we speak here of suggestion (prakäsanä) [rather than denotation].21. The reference is to the verse quoted under 3.4 b A. 2. The syntax of this sentence has thrown all the translations which I have seen of it very wide of the mark. The correlatives are tasya arthântamsya and yadxnsayikaranam. In suggestion we apprehend that meaning which could be given directly by the use of denotative word A, indirectly by the meaning’s appropriateness to the denotation of word B. Purity, which could be denoted by the word “purity,” can also be apprehended by the word “Ganges,” because purity is appropriate to the Ganges. There is no need to emend the text.§ 3.33e L ]L To this: sc., to the objection. W e reply: that is, we furnish the correct view (siddhänta). Denotative power and suggestive power differ in nature and they differ in their objects, which are the word’s own meaning and a different meaning respectively. Here an opponent may argue as follows. “If the second meaning is understood from the first, how can it be termed a ‘different’ meaning? If it is not [understood from the first], how can it bear any relation to the word by which it"},{"pageNumber":571,"pageContent":"could be called an object of the word?” Our author guards against this objection by saying, A nd th e designation, etc.W e could not refer to it: In the phrase vyavahära eva na syätthe word order is irregular; what is meant is vyavahära naiva syät ( “we could not possibly refer to it”).Here it might be objected that the denotatve operation of a single word, if the word has several meanings like the word aksan (the eye, a die, etc.), may work on different objects. To guard against such an objection he points out that the denotative and the suggestive differ in nature: The difference in the n atu re, etc. He shows that the matter is well known: For [the power of denoting] is not, etc. He furnishes a reason to convince any one who might still disagree: although they are not denotative, etc. If the power of denotation were the same as the power of suggestion, the power of suggestion could not belong to that which is not denotative, nor would it be possible for that which is suggestive to lack the power of denotation. But neither of these implications is true, for we see in the sounds of a song that a factor which cannot denote can produce a suggestion, while in the lowering of the head, the heaving of the breast, and the onset of tears, it is obvious that suggestive factors may be incapable of denotation. This is the overall meaning, which he then sums up by saying, Accordingly, b o th because of th eir difference of object, etc.T hen [that o th er meaning] cannot [be called a d enoted m ean­ing]: because to be a denoted meaning is to be the object of the deno­tative activity of a word and not to be the object of an activity, taken indiscriminately, of a word. As for its being the latter [i.e., the fact that the “other meaning” is the object of some sort of activity of a word], that merely proves what is already proved. 1 Our author states this in the words, [That it is th e object of some] activity of a word, etc.Now the objector may say, “We will admit that there is no denotative force in songs and such like, but we insist that the word [of which we are here speaking] is denotative of this other meaning. For why should its denotativeness be cut short?” To guard against this objection our author says, A nd since we apprehend, etc. Where a given word takes for its object a meaning that belongs to another word, it is proper to speak of suggestion and not of the denotative power of the word. In the same case it is not proper to speak of the meaning as being denoted. This is because the power of denotation is the power of giving a meaning by convention, without any intervention, as we see in the case of that word in giving its own meaning. Our author says556 [§ 3 .3 3 e l"},{"pageNumber":572,"pageContent":"557this in speaking of a word’s denoting its p roper object. Because to be denoted [of a meaning) is to be given by force of convention with­out any intervention [of another meaning], just as the same meaning [that is here suggested) is given by some other word [viz. its proper denoter). He says this in the sentence, And since we apprehend, etc. The compound prasiddhäbhidhänäntarasambandhayogyatvena is to be analysed thus: “(characterized) by a fitness consisting in, or a fit­ness for, the relation of being the denoted object of smother word [e.g., “Ganges”), which is well known (inasmuch as it is denotative).” Now there is no such denotative power of the word here [e.g., in “Ganges”) toward the [suggested] meaning [e.g., purity); and there is no denotat- edness of this meaning by the word [“Ganges”). If there is not, then how can the word be said to take this meaning for its object? He an­ticipates the answer by saying, “since we apprehend” it. Now if the meaning is apprehended without any denoter-denoted operation, the word’s operation (or power) must be of a different character [from that of denotation). This is what the argument amounts to.1. Siddhasädhana, the proving of what is proved, is a fault of inference noticed by the Naiyäyikas. One does not infer the presence of an elephant by its trumpeting after one already sees the elephant.§ 3.33 f A ]A And it is not true that the relation of expressed to suggested meaning follows the analogy of the relation of word meaning to sen­tence meaning.1 For it is held by some scholars that our apprehension of word meanings is a pure fiction; and even those who do not admit the artificiality of this apprehension must take the relation of sentence meaning to word meaning on the analogy of the relation of a pot to its component causes [viz., the portions of the pot].2 For just as when the pot is completéd there is no perception of its componènt causes separate from itself, just so when a sentence or its meaning is appre­hended [there is no apprehension] of the words or their meanings [as separate therefrom). If there were a perception of them as separate, our understanding of the sentence meaning would disappear. This pattern"},{"pageNumber":573,"pageContent":"558does not hold for the expressed meaning and the suggested meaning, for when the suggested meaning is apprehended our knowledge of the expressed meaning does not disappear, because that [suggested mean­ing] can be revealed only by the appearance of the expressed meaning.3 Accordingly, the analogy that applies here is that of a lamp and a pot. For just as when a pot is cognized by means of a lamp the light of the lamp does not disappear, just so the appearance of the expressed when the suggested is apprehended. As for the statement in Chapter One that “(the understanding of the suggested sense is preceded by understanding of the denoted sense] just as [the understanding of the sentence meaning comes] through the meaning of the words” [1.10 K\\, it was intended to show no more than that expressed meaning and word meaning are similar in both serving as means, [the first first to the suggested meaning and the second to the sentence meaning].1. Änanda here qualifies the statement of Kärikä 1.10. 2. “Somescholars” here refers to the grammarians who follow Bhartrhari. Bhartrhari held that words are essentially fictions invented by grammarians in order to analyse the meaning of sentences, the sentences being the only units that actually transmit information. For a discussion of this view see J. Brough, “Some Indian Theories of Meaning,” TPS 1953, p. 165ff. “Those who do not admit the irreality of this apprehension” will refer to other grammarians and to the Mîmâmsakas. The relation of a pot to its component causes is a concept derived from the Nyäya-Vaisesika. The separate halves or portions (kapälav) of an Indian pot (ghata) were molded with a stick on a revolving wheel and were later joined together to make the pot. In analysing the causes of a pot the Naiyäyikas say that the instrumental cause (nimitta-kärana) is the stick, the component or inherent cause (vpädäna- or samaväyt-kärana) is the portions of the pot. The Nyäya always speaks of two portions (kapälav), but Abhinava here speaks of several portions (kapäläh) presumably in order to furnish a better analogy to the words of a sentence. The non-inherent cause (asamaväyi-kärana) is the conjunction of the pot-portions. The potter is not a cause but the causer or agent (kartr). 3. It is obvious that the expressedmeaning (e.g. a description of a vibhäva) does not disappear when a rasa is suggested. It may take more thought to realize that the expressed meaning does not disappear in other forms of suggestion. But even in avivaksitaväcya of the atyantatiraskrta type a little thought will show that we must remain aware of the meaning that has been set aside even while we apprehend the suggestion. In the verse “Go your rounds freely, gentle monk,\" the speaker does not intend the expressed sense. But if we, the audience, did not keep it in mind, we should not be amused by the verse. Badarinâth Sanna makes a useful remark on this passage. The vâcya, he says, is not a component cause of[ § 3.33 f A"},{"pageNumber":574,"pageContent":"559the vyangya as the pot-halves are of the pot, but an instrumental cause. The stick does not lose its identity in the completed pot; it is only the pot-halves that lose their identity in it. This is the reason why Änanda shifts from the pot-halves and pot analogy to the lamp and pot analogy.§ 3.33 f L ]L An objector might say, “Very well, we will grant that the denotative power is not [the conveyor of what you call the suggested meaning]; still, the final power of the sentence (tâtparyasakti) might well be.\" Anticipating such an objection, our author says, And it is not tru e th a t, etc. By some scholars: viz, grammarians. Even those who do not adm it: viz., Bhatta Kumärila and his followers.1 He then explains the analogy: For ju st as, etc. Its com ponent causes: by this expression he is referring to the portions of the pot which are its inherent causes (according to the Nyäya]. In the opinion of the Buddhists and the Sahkhyas, of course, there is no existence of the components at the time when the pot is composed of them—in the Buddhist doctrine because the components [like all other entities] last only for a moment; in the Sähkhya doctrine because they cease to be manifested [as soon as their effect-form appears]—but in either opinion there is no perception of them at that time as separate from the pot; and so the example serves to this extent. W ould disappear: he means, because it would have no unity of meaning.2Having thus rejected the analogy of word meaning and sentence meaning that was [intended] to establish the power of overall sentence meaning (tätparyasakti) in the area under discussion [viz., in the area of suggested meanings], he now applies to this area the analogy of the lamp and the pot in order to establish the power of which he ap­proves, namely the power of revelation (or suggestion): Accordingly, etc. Since the analogy of word meaning and sentence meaning is not proper, he accordingly applies the pertinent analogy, after analysing it, to the situation which it will illustrate: For ju s t as when a p ot, etc.But it was said above [1.10 K] that “the understanding of this matter [viz., the suggested sense] is preceded by understanding of the denoted sense just as the understanding of the sentence meaning comes through the meaning of the component words.” One may ask why our author has gone to such pains here to reject this analogy. Seeing that such a question is likely, he says, As for the statem en t in C h ap ter One, etc. It [was intended to show], etc: he means that the two matters are not analogous in all respects."},{"pageNumber":575,"pageContent":"5601. Compare Abhinava’s remarks on 1.4 b and 3.33 d. 2. It is a common postulate of grammar, MTmämsä, and Nyäya that a sentence has only one meaning. Although the three schools differ in the way they analyse sentence meaning, they would all agree that if meanings are apprehended as separate, they cannot form one sentence.[ § 3.33 f LA But at this rate, it will be said, we have arrived at giving two meanings at one time to a sentence; and that being the case, its nature as a sentence is destroyed, for this is defined as the having of only one meaning.1We reply that there is no such fault here, because the two (meanings] are distributed as principal and subordinate.2 Sometimes the suggested sense is predominant and the expressed sense subordinate. Sometimes the expressed sense is predominant and the suggested sense subordi­nate. Of these [alternatives], where the suggested sense is predominant we have what is called suggestive poetry (dhvani). Where the expressed sense is predominant we have a different type (of poetry] that will be described in what follows. Accordingly, it stands established that even when the suggested sense is predominant in a poem, this suggested sense [although it is the main sentence meaning] is not denoted but suggested.3However, where the suggested sense is not intended to be predom­inant, even you [Mlmämsakas] should admit that it is not expressed, for the word [that reveals it] is not directed toward that [final sentence meaning]. To this extent then the suggested forms a certain area of a word’s operation. So even when the suggested sense is predominant, why should it then forswear its nature? Thus, [by the arguments given] so far, [it would appear that] the denotative operation is different from the suggestive operation. But there is this other reason why the sug­gestive differs from the denotative, namely, that the denotative is based solely on words whereas the other is based on both words and meaning; because we have already shown that both words and meanings act as suggestors."},{"pageNumber":576,"pageContent":"5611. See above, 3.33 f L, note 2. 2. That is to say, a sentence thatcontains a suggestion is a complex semantic unit. 3. Here at last we have the conclusive answer to the objection, raised in 3.33 d, that where a suggested meaning appears as the predominant meaning of a sentence it should be called the expressed meaning “because the sentence depends on it.”§ 3.33g L ]L [Mlmämsaka objection:] A t th is rate: he means, by [fol­lowing] the pattern of the lamp and the pot, both of which appear [separately] at the same time. This: viz., the nature of a sentence. A sentence is defined as having only one meaning, because it is stated [inMïmâmsâS. 2.1.46] that a sentence is [known to be] one from its having just one meaning. For when a word is heard once, it rouses our memory of its conventional attachment to a given meaning and that meaning is what is understood by the word. Since there is no activity [of the denotative power] after it has ceased and since there cannot be a simultaneous recall of several conventions, what chance is there for two different meanings? On the other hand, if [the word is] repeated or later remembered, it is not the same word. 1 Such is the [objector’s] meaning.[Änanda’s reply:] T he two: sc. the two meanings. O f these: the sense is, if we take the first of these alternatives. A different type: sc. that which is termed gunïbhütavyangya (“in which the suggestion is subordinated”). Suggested: i.e., revealed (prakäsya).Now since that toward which a word is directed (yatparah sabdah) is the wdrd’s meaning, it might follow that when the suggested meaning is predominant it [will be the meaning toward which the word is directed and so] should be called the expressed meaning. But what about the case where that meaning is not predominant? If you designate the meaning as suggested in that case, we have won our argument. He states this in the sentence, M oreover, etc. But the objector may hold out against calling the meaning suggested when it is predominant. So our author says, So even w hen, etc. What he means is that the necessary conditions for being a suggested meaning are these: the meaning must be different from [the expressed meaning]; it must be connected with that [viz., the direct meaning] with which the word is connected; and it must not have been arrived at by using the convention [e.g. by using the dictionary]. As these conditions are found where the suggested meaning is predominant just as well [as where it is not], there is no reason to suppose that it changes its nature [from the one case"},{"pageNumber":577,"pageContent":"to the other]. He sums the matter up by saying, Thus, sc., because it differs in its objects and in its nature.So far (t&vat): this expression lays the ground for a further argu­ment.2 He proceeds to give it in the words, B ut th ere is this o ther reason, etc. By these words he shows that as there is a difference in the complex of conditions [necessary to produce these two types of meaning], there must be a difference in their causes. But we have shown this matter at length in Chapter One, on the definition of dhvani, when explaining the use of the word vâ and of the dual form vyanktah in the passage “whenever a meaning or a word,” etc. (1.13 L). So we do not enter into details here.1. Thus the MTmämsaka would analyse what we should call a sentence containing a pun as two sentences, in the first of which the ambivalent word or phrase gives the meaning that best suits the context and in the second of which the word or phrase is repeated (or, as we should say, “supplied\") or remembered; but this second occurrence is not really the same word or phrase, so it can give a different meaning. 2. Abhinava has explained the force of tävat in much the same way before; see 3.20 e L, end.56 I 3 3.33 g L,A It is true that secondary usage (gunavrtti), whether metaphor­ical (upacära) or relational (laksanä),* is also based on both [word and meaning]. But from secondary usage also, suggestiveness differs both in nature and in object.To speak first of its nature: it is obvious that secondary usage is a non-primary (amukhya) operation of a word whereas suggestiveness is a primary (mukhya) 2 operation, for not the slightest hint of a non- primary nature can be observed in our apprehension of any of the three types of suggested sense that arise from meaning. Then there is this other difference of nature: that secondary usage may be called a deno­tative operation applied in a non-primary way, whereas suggestiveness is entirely different from denotation, as we have already explained.3 And still another difference of nature is this: that in secondary us­age a meaning that indicates a second meaning becomes transformed into that indicated meaning, as in gangäyäm ghosah (“a village on the"},{"pageNumber":578,"pageContent":"562Ganges\"); whereas in the process of suggestion the meaning that sug­gests a second meaning is apprehended to reveal that second meaning only by revealing itself at the same time.4 It acts in this respect like a lamp, as may be seen in such examples as “PârvatT counted the petals of the lotus in her hand.”5 If we were to give the name relational usagt (laksanä) to an operation where one meaming indicates another with­out our setting aside the apprehension of the first meaning, we would be making relational usage into the primary operation of words. Foi almost every sentence reveals a meaning, the object of the tätparyc (the overall sentence operation), which is different from its expressed meaning.6“But even in your view,” the objector may ask, “what sort of oper­ation of the word can you hypothesize when a meaning suggests one of your three types of suggestion?” We answer this by saying: since this sort of suggestiveness attaches to meaning only by force of some word as conditioned by context, it cannot be denied that the word in question plays a* useful part in the process.71, For discussion of these terms see 1.1 K, note 2. 2. Here “primary”means based upon the literal sense and “non-primary” means deviating from the literal sense. In gangäyäm ghosah (“a village on the Ganges; see 1.4 b L, note 6) the suggestion of coolness and purity carried by “Ganges” comes directly from the literal sense of India’s holiest river, whereas the application of “Ganges” to the bank which borders the river is a deviation from the literal sense. 3. In gangäyäm ghosah we are denoting the bank of the river, but in a roundabout way, viz., by directly denoting something contiguous to it. But we are not denoting coolness and purity at all; we are suggesting them.4. The meaning of gangä becomes transformed into the meaning gangätatah (bank of the Ganges) for the purpose of locating the village. But its proper meaning, must also remain before our minds in order for the suggestion of coolness and purity to take effect. 5. The example has been discussed under 2.22 A. Whether we consider the suggested meaning to be a vyabhi- cäribhäva or a rasa, the primary meaning remains clearly before our mind at the very moment that we apprehend the suggested meaning. 6. Abhi- nava fails to comment on this sentence. I take it that it means little more than “every sentence carries a meaning other than the expressed meaning of its words.” Denotation and suggestion are the primary operations of a word. Gunavrtti is secondary and unusual. 7. The point of the final objection and answer of this section is not clearly brought out by Abhinava. The objector is hoping to show that vyanjakatva is not a property of the word at all because it is the meaning (artha) that is responsible for the suggestion; the word is simply denotative or secondary as the case may be. Änanda’s reply is that the§ 3.33 h A ]"},{"pageNumber":579,"pageContent":"suggestion furnished by the meaning would be impossible without the help of the word. This implies that tryanjakatva attaches to the word.504 [ § 3.33h AL Having thus shown that the suggestive operation is different from the primary operation of denotation on the grounds of difference of object, nature, and cause, he foresees a question as to what difference there can be between the suggestive and the secondary operations since the two are alike in being based on both word and meaning. To show that the suggestive is different from the non-primary (i.e., secondary] operation he now says, It is tru e th a t secondary usage, etc. Based on both: viz., both word and meaning. The natures of metaphor (upacära) and of relational secondary usage (laksanä) have been dis­tinguished and explained in Chapter One, so we shall not repeat the matter here. Is a p rim ary operation: i.e., is of non-stumbling gait (askhaladgati).' T he th ree types of suggested sense: viz., vastu (fact or situation), alaiikâra (figure of speech) and rasa. A denotative operation: for even here there is still an employment of convention.2 As we have explained: viz., just above. Transform ed: so that it no longer appears i its proper form.W h at sort of: i.e., primary or non-primary, for there is no other sort. If (you assign to the suggestive word a] primary [operation], then it is denotative. Otherwise it is secondary. The term gunavrtti (sec­ondary operation) is to be explained as the operation of a word when its function (uriti) is through some guna, that is, some special cause (nim itta) such as similarity (of some other object to the proper object of that word], etc. Now, our author’s intention is that suggestiveness is a primary operation but that it differs from denotativeness because its set of conditions (säm agri) differs from that of denotativeness. Ac­cordingly he says, W e answ er this, etc. 11. See 1.17 K and 1.4 b L, note 17. 2. One could not apply \"ganga\"to gangätatah if it were not for the dictionary meaning of \"ganga.” On the other hand, one could suggest purity by words with quite other dictionary meanings."},{"pageNumber":580,"pageContent":"§ 3.33 i A ]A The difference in the area1 of secondary and suggestive op­erations is likewise perfectly clear. For the three areas within which suggestiveness operates are: the rasas, and the like, certain types of alarikâras, and facts or situations provided that they appear in sug­gested form. Of these, no one cairns, nor could he claim, that our apprehension of rasas and the like is due to secondary operation.2 The same holds for our apprehension of suggested alankäras. A suggested [fact or situation] is one which is intended to be conveyed without taking the help of the proper denotative words, in order that we may apprehend some special beauty [in that fact or situation]. This does not wholly coincide with the area of secondary operations, for we see that words are used metaphorically (not only to achieve beauty but] also because of idiom or conformity [to convention]. This has already been stated.3 And even if an instance does fall within the area of secondary usage,4 this is only because of an admixture of suggestiveness. So we see that sugestiveness is radically different from secondary operation.While suggestiveness is different from the denotative and secondary operations, it has a distribution that includes depencence on both of them. For suggestiveness sometimes depends on the denotative oper­ation, as in that type of suggestion where the expressed meaning is intended as leading on to another meaning (vivaksitanyaparavacya)', and sometimes it depends on secondary usage, as in that sort of sug­gestion where the expressed meaning is not intended (avivaksitaväcya). And it was in order to show this double dependence that the very first analysis of dhvani was into these two divisions. Inasmuch as sugges­tiveness depends on both, its nature cannot be said to be that of either. It cannot be of the same nature as the denotative operation, because some of its occurrences depend on secondary (or relational) use (laksa- nä); and it cannot be of the same nature as laksanâ, because in other occurrences it depends on the denotative operation. Nor is this double dependence the only reason that its nature cannot be that of either. There is a further reason, namely that we find suggestiveness occur­ring as a property of sounds that are devoid of denotative or secondary power. Thus, the sounds of a song can also be suggestive of the rasas"},{"pageNumber":581,"pageContent":"and the like, whereas no denotative or indicative power can possibly be found in these [sounds]. As we find suggestiveness in areas even out­side of sounds, it is clearly improper to speak of it as a mode of some such verbal property as denotativeness and the like. And if, despite the fact that suggestivess differs in nature from the mode of operation of the well-known properties of words, namely power of denotation and laksanä,etc., you would still imagine it to be their mode of operation, why not just as well imagine it to be a mode of operation of the word itself? 5Thus, in the matter of verbal communication [we may speak of] three modes of operation: the denotative (vâcakatva), the secondary (guna- vrtti), and the suggestive (vyanjakatva). Of these, where we find sug­gestiveness, if the suggested sense is predominant, we have dhvani, of which the two main varieties were given at the outset as that where the expressed meaning is not intended (avivaksitavâcya) and that where the expressed meaning is intended but as leading on to a further meaning (vivaksitänyapqraväcya); and both these varieties have been described in detail.1. visaya: area (range) of operation, or objects operated upon. 2. I have taken the iti in gunavrttir iti as a mark of cause, understanding the whole phrase as equivalent to gwiavrtteh. 3. Viz., in 1.14 A. 4. That is, if some fact or situation which is rendered in secondary terms (by metaphor, metonymy, etc.) happens to be beautiful, this is because of the suggestiveness of the phrase, not because of its secondary usage. 5. This sentence has giventrouble to all commentators and translators. BP tries to make sense of the passage by taking sabdaprakäränäm as a genitive of limitation (“among”), but this does not go far enough. Jacobi emended by reading sabdadharmapra- käränäm in place of sabdaprakäränäm. V. Patwardhan suggests changing the order of the words so as to read: yadi ca väcakatvalaksanädinäm prasiddhä- näm sabdaprakäränäm vilaksanatve 'pi My translation embodies both these suggestions. Abhinava’s remarks (see below) I find to be of no help.566 [ § 3.33 i AL Thus suggestiveness, because of the three modes in which it operates, to wit, without stumbling in its march [from word to mean­ing], without the slightest aid from the conventional [or dictionary meaning], and with a [continuing] appearance [of the expressed mean­ing] as separate [from the suggested meaning], is different in nature from secondary operation, which is carried on in the reverse of these three ways. Our author, having explained this difference, now states"},{"pageNumber":582,"pageContent":"567the difference in its area of operation: T h e difference in th e area, etc. As facts and situations are also in the area of secondary operation, he makes a distinction: provided th a t th ey ap p ear in suggested form.The area of suggestiveness is not the area of secondary usage and further differences [viz., those discussed in Chapter One] from the area of the latter may be added.He begins by speaking of the first variety [of suggestiveness]: O f these, etc. N or could he claim : because in this [perception of the rasas] the set of conditions for secondary usage is lacking, as has previ­ously been stated. 1 The sam e holds: he means that secondary usage is impossible here also. He then explains the qualification he has just given of a fact or situation: th a t we m ay apprehend som e spe­cial beauty, etc. In saying that this does not wholly [coincide], he means that there is a partial coincidence. For example in the line “and like a mirror blinded by breath” [the word “blinded” is used both as a secondary meaning and as a suggestor].2 As has already been stated, “secondary usage can sometimes be an adventitious characteristic of a certain type of dhvani” [1.19 K). B ecause of idiom: for example, such words as lävanya (literally, “saltiness,” idiomatically, “charm”). Because of conform ity: that is, because of conformity to past prac­tice (vrtta) or conformity to current convention (vyavahära), as in such phrases as “this lotus-petal couch speaks.” 3 A lready: viz., in Chapter One, in the verse, “Words which are used idiomatically,” etc.4 He now clarifies, along the lines of our explanation above, what he meant by [calling the areas] “not wholly” coincident: A nd even if, etc. From secondary usage: the word gunavrtter is ablative.He now shows that suggestiveness differs from both denotative oper­ation and secondary usage by showing in turns its difference from the former because of its being given life by the latter and its difference from the latter by its being given life by the former: [W hile sugges­tiveness is different] from th e den o tativ e, etc. The particle ca has the sense of restriction and is in irregular position, as is also the particle api.5 That is, not only do the previous reasons go to form a syllogistic proof6 of the difference [of suggestiveness] from denotative operation and secondary operation, but so also does its distribution into instances based on both, that is, based on the primary and based on the secondary operation. So the general sense of the sentence is: it is different from either of these, because instances can be found which are based on the other.7§ 3.33 i L }"},{"pageNumber":583,"pageContent":"568He distinguishes these [two forms of suggestiveness]: For sugges­tiveness [sometimes depends], etc. T h e very first: viz.,, as given in Chapter One in the passage, “And it is [in general of two sorts,]” etc. [1.13 m A]. He now indicates another reason: and it cannot be. The indicated reason is that the place of its occurrence differs both from denotation and from secondary usage. He makes the point clear: Thus, the sounds of a song, etc. In these: in the sounds of songs. He now indicates another reason: As [we find suggestiveness in areas] even outside of sounds, etc. The reason here indicated may be given in syllogistic form thus: Suggestiveness is different from deno­tative and secondary operations because it occurs in areas even outside of sound, like the property of being knowable.8Now the opponent might say, “I grant that the suggestiveness that occurs in something that is not denotative is different from denotative­ness,9 but I still insist that the suggestiveness in that which is denotar tive is not different.” To guard against this our author says, And if, etc. By the word ädi ( “etcetera\" ) he includes gauna (secondary usage in the specific form of metaphor) [in addition to laksanä, the relational form of secondary usage]. O f th e word itself: if “suggestiveness\" and “denotativeness” are imagined as synonyms, why not imagine “sugges­tiveness” and ‘‘word\" to be synonyms? 10 For there is no obstacle to wishful thinking. But, when we have shown the nature of suggestive­ness to be distinct, how can one misassign this property to an area not its own? The sense is that at this rate one could say that smoke on a mountain does not derive from fire [but rather from water or rocks]. Now he sums up the distinction [of suggestiveness from denotation and secondary usage]: T hus, etc. By the word com m unication he rules out the roar of the sea and such like. 11. The set of conditions for laksanä is that the primary meaning must be blocked, that the secondary meaning must be related to the primary meaning in one of certain ways, etc. See Abhinava’s comment on 1.17 2. See Abhi-nava’s remarks on this question, 2.1c L. 3. See above, 1.14 A. 4. The reference is to 1.16 K. 5. By “the sense of restriction” is meant the sence of eva\\ see 2.10 L, note 3. So Abhinava is interpreting the sentence to mean: väcakatvagvnavrttivilaksanasyaiva tasya ... vyavasthänam api. 6. The syl­logism would be in the form: vyanjakatvam väcakatvagunaxnitivilaksanam pürvoktahetukaläpät. For the portion pûrvoktahetukalâpa that forms part of (is a ghatana of) the vyäpti of this proof, one may substitute ubhaydsmya- tvena vyavasthänät. 7. Literally, “it is different from ubhaya because it is distributed into instances that are based on ubhaya.\" Logic and idiom forbid[ § 3.33 i L"},{"pageNumber":584,"pageContent":"one to translate ubhaya here by its dictionary meaning of “both.” 8. The proof derives from the fact that the minor term (paksa, here = vyanjakatva) is of wider extension than vicakatva and gunavrtti with which the opponent seeks to equate it. Accordingly, the property of being knowable (prameyatva) is chosen as the example (udâharana), this being a property of the widest extension possible. Prameyatva, according to the Nyäya, occurs in every­thing, for everything is knowable, if not by us at least by God. 9. To be strictly logical , in line 4 oiL on Text, p. 428 we must either emend aväcake to aväcakädau or emend väcakatväder to väcakatvasya.10. Clearly Abhinava takes the apodosis of Änanda's sentence (viz., tac chabdasyaiva prakäratvena kasmän na parikalpyate) to be an outrageous sug­gestion, just as the protasis is outrageous. Hence his analogy to regarding smoke as produced by non-fire. But it would seem to me that the apodosis actually embodies Änanda’s accepted view, for Ananda continues in his next sentence by stating that the vyanjakatva is one of the three modes of a word. I hesitate to say that Abhinava is wrong, howeever, because the reading and meaning of the first part of Änanda’s sentence, on which Abhinava is here commenting, are obscure. See above 1.33 i A, note 5.§ 3.33 j A ] 569A To this someone might object. 1 “We grant you,” he might say,/ “that there is no secondary operation in that type of suggestion where the expressed meaning is intended but leads on to a further meaning, just as you have said. For how can we speak of a secondary operation where our apprehension of a second meaning is preceded by an apprehension of a denotative word and its expressed meaning? For in secondary usage it is impossible that the expressed meaning should be intended.2 This is true of both types of secondary usage: (a) where a word because of some special reason is superimposed on a foreign object, the native sense of the word being completely set aside in the process, as in such phrases as ‘the brahmin boy is a fire’;3 and (b) where a word holds on to a part of its native sense and by means of some connection (of the foreign sense] with that (native sense] passes on to the foreign sense, as in such phrases as ‘a village on the Ganges. ’4 And so it stands to reason that we should speak of suggestiveness in that type of dhvani where the expressed meaning is intended as leading on"},{"pageNumber":585,"pageContent":"570to a second meaning, for there we not only apprehend the nature of the denotative word and its expressed meaning but we also understand a [second, suggested] meaning. That which casts light on something else in the very act of revealing its own self is called a suggestor. As it is only a denotative word [and never a metaphorical or indicative word] that can be suggestive in such a case, we can never speak of secondary operation here. But where the expressed meaning is unintended, how does your dhvani differ from secondary usage? For i its two subtypes we see the two types of secondary usage.”5To this we reply that here also there is no fault; because while the type of suggestion where the expressed meaning is unintended relies on the path of secondary usage, it is not itself secondary usage. Secondar}' usage can also be found [in instances that are entirely] without sug­gestiveness. Again, suggestiveness is found nowhere without the sug­gested meaning’s being a source of beauty as we have stated, whereas secondary usage may come into being in the form of a metaphorical identity resting on a property belonging to the expressed object and on a suggested meaning of any sort [not necessarily a beautiful meaning].6 For example, [we call] the young brahmin a fire because of the sharp­ness [of Sre];7 we speak of a woman’s face as a moon because of the delighfulness [of the moon]. The same is seen in the line, “there is no tautology in lovers.”8And that variety of secondary usage which is relational ( laksanarüpâ) can occur without our apprehending any beautiful suggestion, simply by making use of some connection [of the expressed object] with the indicated object, as in such examples as “the benches cry out.”9 11. The objector here is closer to Änanda’s views than were the previous obj tors. Most of his speech is an explanation of why ganavrtti is impos­sible in vivaksitänyaparaväcyadhvani, a view which Änanda shares. Only at the end of his speech, when he comes to avivaksitaväcyadhvani, does he dis­agree. 2. The structure of the sentence is obscured by the mispunctuation of the Kashi text. The structure is: na hi gunavrttau yadâ ... yadä ca ... tadä vivaksitaväcyatvam upapadyate. 3. The meaning of the phrase is that the boy is quick to anger. The reason for the superimposition is similarity: both the boy and fire flare up quickly. The example is thus of the variety of secondary usage called gauni (metaphorical). Mammata and later authors further analyse the type into two subtypes. In the first, called säropä, the metaphorical word (fire) is superimposed on its base (the brahmin boy as in the present example). In the second, called sädhyävasänikä, the metaphorical word “swallows\" its base. An example is agnir eväyam, “he is a real fire.” One[ § 3.33 j A"},{"pageNumber":586,"pageContent":"571may note that the “metaphor” of Greco-Latin rhetoric shows a still greater degree of swallowing: 'The fire of Rome spoke to the senate,” meaning that Cicero spoke. 4. This is an example of the relational or non-metaphorical variety of secondary usage, called éuddhâ laksanâ by Mammata. This partic­ular example is based on the relation of proximity between the Ganges and its bank. See 1.4 b L, note 6. We may now turn to a difference between Änanda and later writers in the interpretation of this famous example. Later writers regard gangäyäm ghosah as an example of jahatsvärthä laksanâ, a secondary use of a word which abandons its native sense. The stock example of the opposite, ajahaUaksanä, is kuntäh pravisanti “the spears enter (the city),” where what is meant is spearmen. Here it is clear that the native sense is not wholly abandoned, because the spears do come into the city together with the spearmen. Ananda, on the other hand, regards gangäyäm ghosah as an example of ajahatsvärthä laksanâ. What led him to this view was probably the fact that even in its secondary use here gangäyäm does not mean just any river bank. It means specifically the bank of the River Ganges. So the native meaning of gangä appears in a subordiate or shadowy form. However, as the full native sense of gangä is not present, one may properly designate the example as avivaksitaväcya. 5. By the two subtypes of avivaksitavâcya- dhvani the objector means the atyantatiraskrta, as in agnir mänavakah, and the arthäntarasahkramita, as in gangäyäm ghosah. By the two types of sec­ondary usage he means the gaum and the läksanikä. 6. There is a trick of terminology here that Abhinava in his comment does not cure. It is implied by 1.17 K that wherever there is gunavrtti there must be a vyahgya. Logically it follows that the word which furnishes the gunavrtti must also possess the power of vyanjakatva But Änanda says no. When he speaks of vyanjakatva, he means only the power to produce a beautiful vyahgya. In the conventional and unbeautiful instances of vyahgya which he here adduces, the vyahgya is merely a by-product of the gunavrtti. It requires no separate vyäpära of the word for its explanation. I call this a trick , because it assigns a wide mean­ing to the root vyahjû when used in one derivative (vyahgya) and a narrow meaning when used in another (vyanjakatva). Änanda uses the same trick later on (see 3.33 m A, note 1). If I were a Mïmâmsaka, I should call the trick unfair. 7. In agnir mänavakah the suggested sense (vyahgya) is the sharp­ness (the quickness to flare up) of the boy. This suggested sense is assumed to be identical with , and so rests on, the well-known property of sharpness in fire, fire being the expressed sense of agni. But there is no particular charm or beauty given to the sentence by this suggestion. Clearly this lack of beauty is felt by Änanda in all three of the examples here given. In the third example the English reader might take issue with him, but that is because “tautology” is a rarer and more striking word in English than paunaruktam in Sanskrit. Badarinäth Sannä quite misunderstands the passage. 8. The quotation is from the verse quoted in 1.14 A. The tertium compamtionis in§ 3.33 j A ]"},{"pageNumber":587,"pageContent":"572the 1 t example would be tedium or unattractiveness. 9. The quotation in slightly different form, viz., manca basanti (“the benches laugh”), goes back to Mahäbhäsya on 4.1.48, Värt 3 (Vol. II, p. 218, line 16), which even there served as an example of secondary usage. Nyäya S. bhäsya 2.2.62 quotes the sentence as we have it here, mancäh kroéanti, again as an example of upacära. In view of the Mahäbhäsya quotation, the reference was doubtless originally to persons sitting on the benches of a theater. For manca in this sense see BhägPur. 10.42.35 and 38. Later commentators, forgetting the original con­text, sometimes speak of the watchers on field platforms or even of children crying in their cradles.[ § 3.33j AL An objection may be raised to the two reasons that have been given (for the difference of suggestiveness from secondary operation], namely that it is given life (in some instances] by a denotative oper­ation and because it is given life (in other instances] by a secondary operation. These reasons do not hold in that division of suggestiveness where the expressed meaning is not intended, because the instances of that division are nothing more than secondary meanings. In order to show this point of view, our author begins, To this som eone m ight object, etc. Although the problem has already been solved by his say­ing that suggestiveness (as a whole] depends on both (the other types of operation], he proceeds as he does in order to remove all doubts for one who finds the difference hard to distinguish between secondary usage and suggestiveness of the type where the expressed meaning is not intended. So he directs the objection against the second type only, after admitting the difference in suggestiveness of the first type. In the passage beginning, [We gran t you] in th a t ty p e w here th e expressed m eaning is intended b u t leads on to a fu rth er m eaning, etc., the objector is shown as conceding a point to his op­ponent. In order to show why one cannot speak of secondary usage [in this type] he shows just where secondary usage does occur: For it is im possible, etc.Gunavrtti means a vrtti, that is, a semantic operation (vyäpära) that occurs because of the presence of some guna (i.e. some special reason). And when because of some special reason (guna = nim itta), such as similarity, a word operates on_a foreign object, we get a case of apposi­tion [between the two words and identification of their senses]. Hereby he shows the gauna type. He then shows the laksanâ (relational type) with the words, or when a word holds on, etc. By these two types he shows that he accepts the fact that suggestion where the expressed"},{"pageNumber":588,"pageContent":"573meaning is not intended is of two types. That is why he mentions the two types specifically in the words, th e native sense of th e word being com pletely set aside and [where th e word] passes on to a foreign sense. 1A nd so [it stands to reason]: because there are not the aforesaid causes to justify the name of secondary usage. He then shows that his argument is consistent with everyday usage: [That which casts light while revealing] its own self, etc. Is called: as for example a lamp. On the other hand, the physical senses [sight, hearing, etc.] are not termed suggestors, because they are the instruments, not the suggestors (or revealers), of our perception.2Having thus expressed the matter on which he agrees, the opponent now shows his objection: B ut w here th e expressed m eaning is unintended, etc. The word “but\" distinguishes this type from the preceding. For in its [two types], etc.: the sense is that in the two types of suggestion where the expressed meaning is unintended the two types [of secondary meaning], namely the metaphorical (gauna) and the relational (läksanika) are observed, that is, stand revealed.Our- author now disposes of the criticism: Here too [there is no fault]. Gunavrttimärgäsra.ya. (that which relies on the path of sec­ondary usage) is to be analysed as: that of which the basis (äsraya) is the mârga, that is, the two varieties, of secondary usage. Here the word “basis” refers to a factor which plays a causal part only in the earlier stages of the process. This process has already been described. 3 He states the reason why they cannot be of the same nature: Secondary operation, etc. He means both metaphorical and relational.Bnt how can secondary usage occur without there being a suggestion? For it has already been said that “When a word abandons its primary operation and reveals an object by secondary usage, the purpose for which this is done is one to which the word moves without stumbling.” [1.17 Ä], So you have said that there is no secondary usage without a purpose and that the operation which is responsible for [showing us] this purpose is the suggestive operation.4 It is in expectation of such an objection that he says that the suggestiveness that is here intended is one that arrests the attention5 and that in these [examples] there is no such suggestiveness. He says this in the sentence beginning, Again, suggestiveness, etc.A p ro p erty belonging to the expressed object: the meaning is that secondary usage can occur on the basis (äsrayena) of denotation, that is, in order to strengthen denotation, which is a property (i.e., a§ 3.33 j L ]"},{"pageNumber":589,"pageContent":"574power of words] which conveys the literal meaning; because the “other” [or secondary] meaning is in the last analysis simply a way of making sense (upapädäya) of the literal meaning, as in srutärthäpatti (material implication) .6Of these [secondary usages] he gives an example of the metaphori­cal type: For exam ple, etc. He proceeds to show the second [non- metaphorical type] in an instance devoid of suggestiveness, with the words, And th a t variety, etc. By beautiful he means one that holds our attention. Without that, the power of suggestion cannot unfold, because our attention turns back and comes to rest on the literal sense, like a common man who catches a glimpse of divine wealth only to lose it the next moment.I § 3.33 j L1. Abhinava means that the obj tor has associated the gauna use of a word with the subtype of avivaksitaväcya suggestion called atyantatiraskrta and has associated the laksanä use with the subtype called arthäntarasan- kramita. 2. The analogy of a lamp naturally brings up the subject of the senses. One must remember that vyanjayati can mean to manifest or reveal as well as to suggest. In verbal perception a suggestive word or phrase, for example a description of avibhäva, suggests or reveals an extra meaning, for example a rasa, by its very revealing of itself. In the same way in ocular perception a lamp reveals to us a jar by its very revelation of itself. But could we not say that our eye reveals the jar? No. Our eye is the instrument that perceives the jar; it is not the vyanjaka. So likewise in verbal perception: the ear and mind are the instruments. The ear perceives the sound and the mind perceives the sense. 3. At 1.4 b L (Text pp. 58-59, Translation pp. 86-87) and 1.13m L (Text p. 140, TYanslation p. 173). 4. The objector has logic onhis side. See 3.33j A, note 6. 5. Literally, one on which [the heart] comes torest; that is, one which takes our attention away from other verbal operations. 6. The stock example of srutärthäpatti is pino devadatto diva na bhunkte, “fat Devadatta does not eat by day.\" In order to make sense of this statement we assume that Devadatta eats at night. So, when we hear agnir mänavakah, in order to make sense of the statement, we resort to a secondary operation which shifts the meaning of agni from fire to a property of fire."},{"pageNumber":590,"pageContent":"§ 3.33 k L ]A But where secondary usage is the cause of our apprehension of a beautiful suggested meaning, this is because suggestiveness is in­volved. In this respect secondary operation is similar to the denotative operation. And where we make use of an impossible [literal] sense, as in “These men reap the earth of its flowers of gold,” 1 it is the [de­sire to bring about an] apprehension of a beautiful suggested sense2 that provokes [the use of the metaphor]. So in si ilar cases also, even though there is the use of a secondary sense, it stands to reason that we may speak of dhvani. Thus in both types of suggestion where the expressed sense, is not intended [we may have] a secondary usage that is intertwined (atrista) with some particular suggestive operation but is not identical therewith, because, while it is apprehended as delightful by the hearts of men of taste, it is [only] the cause of our apprehension [of the beautiful meaning]3 and because we can find other instances of secondary usage which lack this [delight]. All this has already been pointed out, but is restated in order to give the reader a clearer under­standing.1. See 1.13 m A. The literal sense here is more than blocked (bädhi- ta) ,by the surrounding context; it is inherently impossible. The flowers of this earth are not made of gold. Whenever a literal operation is blocked, a secondary operation will come into play. But where the literal sense is inherently impossible, it is obvious that the speaker never would have chosen such words except out of a desire to give beauty to his expression. 2. The suggestion of the whole verse according to Abhinava is that the courageous, the wise, and the faithful are worthy of praise. See 1.13 m L. 3. pratitihetu must have the same meaning here that it had at the beginning of the section. What is meant here is therefore vyangyapratitihetutvät.L Now how shall we handle cases (of secondary operation] where our mind comes to rest on the suggested meaning? He addresses this question with the words, B ut w here, etc. The sense is that in such cases there is clearly a separate suggestive operation. He uses an"},{"pageNumber":591,"pageContent":"[ § S.asTk 1example that is acceptable to the opponent: sim ilar to th e den» tativ e operation. What he means is this. Even you have accepted ! suggestive operation in cases where a denotative operation [precedes] this follows from your having made no objection to the first type o dhvani.1Moreover,2 upon one thing that is possible in the world in its pri mary sense [e.g., a boy] a second thing which is also possible in it: primary sense [e.g., a fire] can be superimposed [that is, fire can b< superimposed on a boy who is quick to flare up], and we speak of su perimposition simply because the area of application has been shiftec [from fire to boy]. This is the essence of the metaphorical process. Bu flowers made of gold are inherently impossible, so how can we speal of superimposing the notion of harvesting upon these imaginary flow ers in the verse in question? So, as there is indeed a superimpositioi in the phrase “the earth’s flowers of gold,” we see that the suggestiv« operation is predominant here rather than the use of superimposition The latter arises only in order to help the suggestive operation.

One cannot even imagine that the attentioi would come to rest on the superimposed meaning, which is impossibleEven though th ere is: he means, although the secondary sens« serves us as a temporary prop in order to attain the suggestive opera tion. Thus: (the secondary sense is] unqualified (avisista)3 by a variety (visesa) in the form of suggestiveness, where “unqualified” means no possessing a variety (visesa = bhedana) of that sort. In other words suggestiveness is not a variety of secondary operation.

The words kirn ca (moreover) gloss the word ca in the sentence beginning asam- bhavind cärthena (“and when we make use of an impossible literal sense”). In the passage that follows Abhinava shows that metaphors which employ words with an inherently impossible literal sense can be brought into use only by a desire to produce a beautiful or striking suggestion. 3. Abhinava’s text read visesdvisistd where in our translation of A we chose the reading of KM, visesdvistd. Accordingly, he is faced with a difficulty. He cannot allow the passage to exhibit the normal meaning of avisistd, for it would then say that gunavrtti is indistinguishable from, that is, identical with, vyanjakatvavisesa and this is precisely what Änanda is seeking to disprove. So Abhinava offers us a choice of two extraordinary interpretations, the first etymologyzing avi­sistä and the second dvisistd. Both are far-fetched, but they both furnish a meaning that is compatible with Ananda’s views. 4. Abhinava’s text must have been different from ours.§ 3.331 A ]A Furthermore, the property of words and meanings called sug­gestiveness is in conformity with a generally recognized relationship and' cannot be called contrary to the doctrine of any school. 1 Be­tween words and meanings it is generally accepted that there exists a denoter-denoted relation. Quite in conformity with this but con­nected with a different set of conditions is an operation acccidentally attaching (aupâdhika) to word and meaning called suggestiveness; and on this account it is different from the denotative power. A denota­tive power is the very self of each individual word, bound to it from the time of our first understanding the word, for the word is never known to be without it. But suggestiveness is not bound to the word, but accidental, for our apprehension of it is conditioned by context, etc. and it is not apprehended in the absence of those conditions. If it be asked why we bother to study its nature if it is not essential, we answer that we are not at fault, because while it is accidental to the word [which carries it] it is not accidental to its object, which is"},{"pageNumber":593,"pageContent":"578its suggested meaning. A suggestor in this respect is seen to act like the Unga (middle term) of an inference. Just as the property of be­ing a Unga appears irregularly in the entity which possesses it, as it depends on one’s desire [to infer], and yet is invariable in its relation to what it works toward, [viz., the sädhya, the major term or proban- dum], so is the suggestive power, as we have described it, [accidental to the word but invariable in relation to what it suggests].2 From the very fact that it is not bound to the word, it follows that it cannot be taken as a mode of the denotative power. If it were a mode of the denotative power, it would be bound to its word, just as the denotative power is.And this sort of accidental property of words must necessarily be as­sumed by him [viz., the MTmâmsaka] who holds that there is an inborn (autpattika) relation between words and meanings.3 He is an expert in the meanings of sentences and claims that there is a difference be­tween human and non-human sentences. For if he did not assume such a property, he could make no distinction between what is stated by a non-human and by a human sentence, since the connection between the component words and meanings is the same in both cases.4 If he does assume such a power, however, he can explain how human sentences can be false by possessing an accidental operation, other than the deno­tative, superimposed upon the words in accordance with human desire, despite the fact that the words never abandon their connection with their denoted objects.We see that there are entities in the world which, without abandoning their essential nature, may act in contrary ways by some accidental operation imparted to them by various combinations of conditions. For example, such an entity as the moon possesses a coolness that refreshes all living beings, and yet it is well known that it can cause pain when viewed by men whose hearts are burning with the pain of separation from their beloveds. Accordingly, one who would explain the falsity of human sentences despite the inborn connection [of their words] with the objects [of those words] will clearly have to posit an accidental property of some sort in addition to the power of denotation. And this property is nothing other than suggestiveness (vyanjakatva), for suggestiveness is simply the revealing of a suggested sense (vyangya) and human sentences regularly reveal a human intention (purusäbhi- präya). The sense is suggested, not denoted, because the words are not connected with this [intended or suggested sense] by a relation of denoter to denoted.[ § 3.331 A"},{"pageNumber":594,"pageContent":"5791. The present section (3.331) is an attempt to bring the operation of suggestion, and thus the doctrine of dhvani, into harmony with the views of the MTmämsä and the Nyäya. The MTmämsä too posits a verbal operation in addition to väcakatva and gunavrtti. It is forced to do so in order to explain how the meanings of sentences made out of words with invariable meanings can ever be false They are so because a final sentence operation ( tätparyavyä- para) is given to these words by human intention (vaktrabhipräya) whereas the denotative power does not derive from human source but is eternal. The Nyäya, on the other hand, posits a property, lingatva, which belongs to an object (e.g., smoke) when, at the prompting of our mind, it serves as an inferential means for our reaching a probandum (e.g., fire). Änanda will here show that his vyanjakatva (suggestiveness of a word) is analogous to the tät- parya of the MTmämsä and to the lingatva of the Nyäya. In later Sections he will make it clear that this is only an analogy, not an identity. 2. Lingatva and vyanjakatva are relational abstracts; see Ingalls, Materials, pp. 44-47. They are not properties essential to an entity but properties that appear in an entity under certain conditions, or when the entity is set in a certain relation. The entity smoke possesses lingatva (the property of being a signpost or middle term) to fire only under the double condition that (a) we do riot already know of the presence of fire and (b) we wish to infer the presence of fire. The word ganga possesses suggestiveness of coolness and purity only under certain conditions, not, for example, in the sentence gangâyàm bahavo matsyâ jïvanti “there are many fish in the Ganges.” But when the conditions are present, it invariably gives those suggestions. It is important to note that Änanda is likening a vyanjaka to a Unga only in this one respect. Later, in arguing with the Nyäya (3.33o A), he will show that the vyangya-vyanjaka relation is in other respects different from the litigi-Unga relation. 3. Cf. MîmàrnsâS. 1.1.5: autpattikas tv sabdasyärthena sambandhah. 4. It is only in putting the sentence together and in what he intends by his sentence that the human speaker differs from the inhum an source of the eternal Vedic text. The accidental property of his sentence, its tâtparya, will reflect his limited knowledge and fallibility, even though each word faithfully denotes its obj t just as it does in the Veda.§ 3.331 L ]L He now shows that suggestiveness, which by being accidental is unbound, must have a different cause from the denoter-denoted rela­tion, which is bound: F urtherm ore, etc. A ccidentally attaching: he means that it is thus because of the complex character (vaicitrya)1 of suggestiveness that has been mentioned; and this is as much as to say that on this account it is different from the denotative power, which is bound by convention. He makes this clear with This is why, etc."},{"pageNumber":595,"pageContent":"180 ira-3311He shows just how suggestiveness is accidental by saying, [for our apprehension of it is conditioned by] context, etc.W hy we bother: he means that something unbound or unregulated can be imagined as one wishes and lacks any reality. There is no point in studying a nothing. To th e word: to the particular word-form which carries the convention. In th e en tity w hich possesses it: because smoke is not always informative of fire, as we see when it is sometimes informative of something else and sometimes is uninformative of fire.2D epends on one’s desire: desire here includes the wish to know the paksadkarmatâ (e.g., that smoke is actually on the mountain), the desire to remember the universal law (e.g., “where smoke there fire”), etc. In relation to w hat it works tow ard: it never fails to gain its proper goal once the triple condition ( trairüpya) has been apprehended within itself and within that toward which it works (i.e., within the Unga and the sädhya).3He now clarifies what he said above, that his theory does not run counter to anyone’s doctrine: And this sort, etc. By “this sort” he means characterized by suggestiveness. An inborn (autpattika) relatio n:4 autpattika, (which denotes primarily that which belongs to the first bhävavikära (stage of life) , 5 namely birth,] here indicates in a secondary sense the second stage, existence, because of the proxim­ity of existence to birth. Or, we can take the word by a relational secondary usage, indicating the contrary,6 to mean that which is not born [but is constantly present]. Or, we can take autpattika to be used idiomatically7 as a synonym of nitya (constant, eternal). The sense is that the Mlmämsaka, who posits an eternal relation between word and meaning, which he calls [the word’s] power, must admit this sort of property.He could m ake no distinction: because in that case the entry of human shortcomings would bring about no change and the invalidity of human sentences, which depends on these shortcomings, could not be explained. If we say that what is understood is like that [i.e., is false], because it is [the understanding] of a faulty listener, it would follow that the sentence itself is faultless. So how could we call it invalid? And even Vedic sentences would be invalid because of the faulty comprehension of the listener.But now, even if we accept another property (viz., tätparya or vyanja- katva), how can human sentences become false, for the word will not abandon its inherent nature of revealing the object?

That is why such state­ments as \"angulyagre [karivarasatam]” 9can be said to be false only by bringing into consideration the intention of the human speaker.W ith this: what he means is that due to uncertainty [of the relation between the words and their suggested sense, viz., the human speaker’s intention], there is no inherent [or invariable] connection between them.§ 3.331 L ]1. Just what Abhinava means by vaicitrya is hard to say with certainty. BP's suggestion (väcyaväcakayor gunaprädhänyäd) is unlikely. More likely Abhinava is referring to the prakaranädyavaccheda which Änanda mentioned at the end of 3.33 h. That would include the conditions of context, speaker, person addressed, etc. 2. The Nyäya examples of the former would be: when we use the presence of smoke to infer the presence of fireness ( vahnitva rather than vahni), or of the opposite of coldness, or of wet fuel; of the latter, when we already know that the fire is there, or when we are inattentive, or simply do not wish to make an inference. 3. It is most unlikely that Änanda intended the compound svavisaya as a dvandva. But by so analysing it Abhi­nava renders Änanda’s statement far more precise. The “triple condition” of Unga and sâdhya is: paksadharmatä, sapaksavrttitva, apaksävrttitva. In the stock example of inferring fire from smoke, the smoke must indeed occur on the mountain; it must occur in similar loci of fire (kitchen hearth, etc.); and it ihust not occur in dissimilar loci (a lake, etc.). 4. Abhinava takes the literal sense of autpattika to be “connected with birth” (utpatti = janma). The difficulty then presents itself that an autpattikah sambandhah, if taken in the literal sense, would cease directly after birth. So Abhinava offers us three ways of taking the term in a secondary sense. The first is from Sahara on MîmâmsâS. 1.1.5. The real source of the difficulty is that Panini has not given a specific sense to the suffix thak that would suit its present employment in the word autpattika. 5. Yäska, Nirukta 1.2, lists the stages as jàyate, as­ti, vardhate, viparinamate, apaksîyate, vinaâyati. 6. Viparitalaksanä is the secondary sense commonly seen in irony, e.g., èuro 'yam, “he is a great hero,\" when we mean “he is a coward.” 7. Rüdhyä: that is, without reference to etymology. 8. MïmàmsàS. Vol. I, pp. 16-17. 9. The quotation begins amandäkränta verse. It is usually used as an example of absurdity; see 1.4 b L, note 9. But the absurdity depends on the intention of the speaker.

But if he means, “a hundred fine elephants are in front of my finger, i.e., I am pointing at them,” that may be true.582 [§ 3.331 L3.33 mA But at this rate the term dhvani (suggestion, suggestive po­etry) must be applied to every human sentence, for all these sentences are suggestive in the way just described. That is true. But the sug­gestiveness that comes from the revealing an intention on the part of the speaker is common to all human sentences without distinction. It is not apart from the denotative power, for that which is suggested in this case is inseparably present with it. This, however, is not true of a suggestion which the speaker wishes to convey (vivaksita). It is where what is suggested stands as intended to be conveyed that the sugges­tiveness [of the sentence] can prompt us to call it dhvani (suggestive poetry) . 1A suggested sense which is revealed by word and meaning, if it is a specific intention, becomes a vivaksita (something that the speaker wishes to convey), when it is revealed as the tâtparya (final sentence meaning). However, this alone will not explain the term dhvani, which covers an immense area, because it is insufficient. Rather, it is a sug­gested element in any of the three forms, [vastu, alahkàra, or rasa], whether in the form of the speaker’s intention or not,2 if it is suggested as the final sentence meaning, that justifies the term dhvani, as we said in defining dhvani in terms of the aforesaid types of suggestiveness. Our definition was neither too wide nor too narrow.So it appears that a verbal suggestion characterized by suggestiveness does not conflict with the doctrines at least of the experts on sentence meaning [sc. the Mlmämsakas]. As for those scholars who have ex­actly determined the nature of brahma as it appears in speech [sc. the Grammarians], we adopted the term dhvani from their philosophy,3 so the question whether or not we are in conflict with them does not arise. Among the masters of argument [sc., the Naiyäyikas4], who regard the connections of word and object as artificial constructions, the fact that words, like other things, can be suggestive, is proved by experience and uncontradicted (by other means of knowledge]; so it does not fall among those concepts which they reject."},{"pageNumber":598,"pageContent":"5831. The distinction made in this paragraph is between a suggested element (vyangya) in the form of vaktrabhiprâya (the speaker’s intention to convey the information embodied in the sentence) and a suggested element that the speaker wishes to convey (invaksita) as a suggested element. The former sort of suggestion is present in every sentence. The latter sort is present only in poetically suggestive sentences (sentences which possess vyafijakatva). Here again (cf. 3.33j A, note 6) Ananda assigns a very wide meaning to the root vyanjü as used in one derivative (vyangya) and a narrow meaning as used in another (vyanjaka). This distribution allows him to eat his cake and have it, as the saying goes. In 3.331 A he used purusäbhipräya, (= vaktrabhiprâya) to show that his vyafijakatva was no more than what the MTmämsakas are forced to admit. Human sentences are distinguishable from Vedic sentences by their suggesting vaktrabhiprâya. Now he denies that the suggesting of vaktrabhiprâya is a case of real dhvani and thereby clears his criterion of poetry from the criticism that the Mïmâmsâ concept would incur if so used. 2. The vyangya need not be intended by the speaker. A naive girl, to give an example not seldom used in Sanskrit poetry, may make a suggestion of which she is quite unaware and which she is so far from intending that she would avoid it if she were. The figure of speech apahnuti often contains such an unconscious suggestion, which is then denied as soon as it becomes apparent to the speaker. 3. See 1.131 A. 4. Possibly Änanda would include the Buddhists also; so Abhinava.§ 3.33 m L ]L What our author has in mind is this. When we hear the words, “Bring the cow,” and an intention of the speaker is thereby suggested, a meaning characterized by that particular intention is associated with [i.e, prompts] the activity of bringing the desired object, not intention in general, which would be quite ineffective. W hich th e speaker wishes to convey: he means, as predominant. W h at is suggested: viz., in examples of dhvani. From the sentences of poetry we do not seek an apprehension that is pertinent to taking and bringing things. We seek an apprehension that holds our attention [i.e., that is aesthetically satisfactory]. And this is an apprehension that comes to rest on the intention [i.e., on the suggested meaning] and does not end on the [directly denoted] desired object.1But now, if what is suggested is only the speaker’s intention, how do we explain the three varieties of suggested meaning that have been posited? He speaks of this problem with the words, A suggested sense [in th e form], etc.Having thus shown that it would be wrong to find anything here in conflict with the doctrines of the MTmämsakas, he shows that there is no"},{"pageNumber":599,"pageContent":"584conflict with the Grammarians, with the words, As for those schol­ars w ho have exactly determ ined, etc. The compound pariniscita- nirapabhraméaéabdabrahmanâm is to be analysed as follows: those by whom brahman, which is unimpaired (nirapabhramsa), that is, with­out any latent impression of avidyâ, because of its being devoid of all dualities, and which is in that form of revelation and reflection called speech, has been completely (pari) determined (niscita), that is, has been established by valid means of proof. Here brahman is derived from the root brh “to increase,” 2 because it is great (brhat) through its wide extent, because it is swollen (brmhita) with a wealth of special powers, and because it is an instrument of increase (brmhana) through Brahma’s being the god who has the power of creating the universe.3 This is as much as to say that the Grammarians, while they admit no other factor in the state of pure brahman, so there can be no question of denotative and suggestive power there, do admit a further operation in the phenomenal world (avidyàpode). We have explained this at length in Chapter One.4Having shown that both the scholars of sentences (Mîmâmsakas) and the scholars of words (Grammarians) fall within the area of agreement, he proceeds to show that there should be no conflict with the Logi­cians, who know the principles of the means of knowledge. Artificial constructions: Those who hold that the connection between word and meaning is an artificial construction are the Naiyäyikas, the Bud­dhists, and the like.5 Thus we have the statement, “No, (the relation of word to meaning is not like the relation of hetu to sädhya], because the idea we have of a thing from a word is conventional” (NyâyaS. 2.1.55). Again, “Words give a conventional sense” (Dharmaklrti, PV. 3.91; ed. Gnoli 1.92).6 Like o th er things: e.g., such things as a lamp.7Now we might prove by experience (of an astygmatic observer] that there are two moons and this could well form a subject for disagree­ment. To guard against such a possibility our author adds, and uncon­trad icted . Uncontradicted is that to which there is no obstruction, no sublation by a second (corrective) cognition. So the sense is, that it is both proved by experience and not sublated. That which is proved by experience is not to be rejected, any more than the denotative power. 11. Abhinava here expands on Änanda’s basic distinction of vaktrabhi- prâyavyahgya and vivaksitavyahgya.

On the matter of suggestive power, which follows behind, which is common to other entities besides words, and which they admit as something well known in the world, what occasion is there for them to disagree? For it is with matters beyond worldly experience that all the arguments of the Logicians are concerned, not with matters of ordinary experience. We do not see then? disagree on a matter that lies within eveyone’s sense perception and that is free of obstacle, such as the identity of what is blue, or sweet, or the like. If one says of a blue object that is open to view, “It is blue,” another does not contradict him by saying, “It is not blue; it is yellow.” So who can deny the suggestive power, which belongs to denotative words, to such non-denotative sounds as those of songs, and to non-verbal gestures and the like, and which is proven to exist by the experience of everyone? For various occupations and activities, both sustained and isolated, which suggest a beautiful non-verbal meaning, are found to be honored in assemblies of the skillful. 1 What man of sense, if he would avoid exposing himself to ridicule, would scorn them?1.

Their argument is not about the existence of denotative power but about whether it is an inborn or acquired property.

The four alternativ represent the doctrines of the Säiikhya-Yoga, the Nyâya-Vaüesika, the Vijnänaväda Buddhists and the éünyavâda Buddhists respectively.§ 3.33 o A ]A Here an objection might be raised. “There is good reason to scorn them. The suggestiveness of words is informative (gamaka) and to be informative is to be a Unga (inferential mark, as smoke is informative of fire) of an inference. Accordingly, the apprehension of a suggestion is simply the apprehension of an inference and the suggestor-suggêsted relation of words is nothing other than a marker- probandum relation. For this reason too you will have to accept our point of view: because you have just now explained that suggestiveness is with reference to the speaker’s intention. Now the speaker’s intention is essentially an anumeya (an inferendum, a fact to be arrived at by inference).”To this we reply: Come now, even if things were as you say, what harm would that do us? What we are insisting on is the existence of a verbal operation other than denotative and secondary operation, one that is characterized by suggestiveness. Even if the operation were as 'you say, our thesis would not suffer. Let the suggestive operation be the operation of an inferential mark or let it be something else: in any case, it will still be within the area of verbal operations and yet different from the other known verbal modes. So there need be no argument between us.But it is not really true that the suggestive operation is simply an inferential operation, nor that our apprehension of a suggested meaning is always the apprehension of a lingin (probandum of an inference).1 As you have repeated our words in order to prove your own point, claiming that since we admitted the speaker’s intention to be something suggested, the words that reveal this intention must act as inferential marks,2 we shall go over what we said, making some needful distinctions to which we invite your attention.The area of words3 is of two sorts: the area that can be inferred (anumeya) and the area that can be communicated (pratipädya). Of"},{"pageNumber":603,"pageContent":"588these the area of inference is that of vivaksä (the speaker’s desire to say something). And this vivaksä is of two sorts: a desire to manifest speech-sounds and a desire to manifest a meaning by means of these sounds. The former of these is not a part of verbal communication. It merely results in our knowing that the speaker is a living being. The latter is ultimately responsible for the speaker’s limiting himself to particular sounds [i.e. certain words] and it is also the cause, at one remove, of his communication by words.4 Both these desires fall within the inferable area of words. As opposed to this area, the objects that can be communicated consist in the meanings which the user wishes to communicate. Now these also are of two sorts: those to be expressed (or denoted) and those to be suggested. For sometimes the user chooses to reveal his meaning by means of the word naturally attached to it and sometimes, out of regard to some special prompting, he chooses to re­veal it as not denoted by its natural word. This twofold area of what can be communicated does not itself appear as a probandum (lingin, some­thing inferred) but as a term in some other sort of relation, either an artificial or a natural one. The fact that the meaning is something that the speaker intended to communicate is apprehended as a probandum inferable from his words, but the meaning itself is not so apprehended. If the operation of words in this area [viz., in communicating their meanings] were as inferential marks, there would be no disagreements as to the truth or falsity of a word’s meaning any more than there is in other cases of inferring a probandum [like fire] from a mark like smoke.5And the suggested meaning, being implied by the capability of the expressed meaning, must be connected with the word, just as is the expressed meaning. Whether the connection is direct or indirect makes no difference; and we have already shown that the suggestve power depends on the relation of the word to its denoted meaning. There­fore, to sum up: words operate like inferential marks only when the suggested element is in the form of the speaker’s intention; but when the suggested element is turned into object of the speaker’s intention, they operate as things to be communicated.Now when this communicated sense is understood (rather than di­rectly expressed], both when it is in the form of intention and when it is not in the form of intention,6 is the verbal activity a denotative operation or is the operation through some other connection? It has already been stated [3.33 e A; Text p. 418, lines 3-4] that it cannot be a denotative operation in this case. If it acts through some other connection , it must be suggestive.[ § 3.33 o A"},{"pageNumber":604,"pageContent":"589Moreover, that which is a suggestor (or revealer) cannot be identified with that which is an inferential mark, because one sees that such is not the case with a lamp, etc.7 It follows that no communicated object of words is related to them as a probandum is related to its mark, any more than the expressed object is so related. For that which is related to words as their probandum, namely the object which we have so described [the speaker’s intention, his desire to use words, etc.] is not understood as something denoted but as an accidental attachment (tipädhi). If the communicable object were a probandum, there could never be the disagreements regarding it that people are seen to engage in. This too has been stated.1. Actually this is true only when the suggested meaning is vaktrabhi- prdya, the fact that the speaker has an intention. 2. Änanda admitted the vaktrabhiprâya to be vyangya (3.331 A; Text p. 440-441). He also admitted that in one respect, at least, a suggestive word acts like a tinga (3.331 A; Text p. 437, line 3 to p. 438, line 1). 3. Visaya (area) here means the area inwhich words can serve any purpose as informing us of anything. It includes both their objects (their expressed, indicated, and suggested meanings) and also the facts that can be inferred from our using words. 4. Read -ävasitä and separate from the following vyavahita. Thus, if we follow the psychological process sequentially, we shall find that the second-mentioned desire comes first. We first wish to manifest or transmit some meaning. We then decide to employ speech sounds to do so. 5. If a man says, “I am your friend. You have nothing to fear,” we will have no doubt of his intention, which is inferable. But we may well doubt the truth of what he says (the verbal object of his intention), which is communicable. 6. See 3.33m A and note 2.7. A lamp is vyanjaka of pots and cloths; it is not a tinga of pots and cloths.L T h ere is [good reason]: there is no denying suggestiveness here; but it adds nothing; it is simply the relation between the marker (tinga) and the result (lingin) of an inference, ju st now: that is, in bringing up the Mïmâmsaka objection.Even if things w ere as you say: by this he shows that even if he were to put on a bold face and accept the objection, his thesis would not fail. 1W ithin th e area o f verbal operation: [Such is our translation of sabdavyäparavisayatvam, but Abhinava takes the compound differently, as follows]: being the operation of a word, it is also an object of our apprehension.

As the inferential relation does not pervade the vyangya-vyanjaka relation, the latter cannot be essentially2 the same as the former.The area of words: by a word’s visaya is here meant everything that we apprehend upon the pronunciation of the word. Both types of vivaksâ, the desire to use speech sounds and the desire to transmit a meaning [by means of these sounds], are inferable. But that which is the object in the speaker’s desire to transmit meaning [i.e., the mean­ing that he wishes to transmit] is something for [the understanding of] which the word serves as instrument; and this something is not infer­able. All that we can infer is that the speaker had a desire to transmit it. Where the word is used as an instrument there is not found the modus operandi which is found in the working of a Unga, such as our perceiving that it occurs in a minor term [e.g., as smoke occurs on a mountain], but rather a different modus operandi, such as the activa­tion [in our memory] of the convention [that connects the word with its meaning]. So the word here cannot be an inferential mark. And we may note that the modus operandi [where a word transmits a meaning] is of two sorts: by the one, the word engages in the activity of denotation; by the other, it engages in the operation of suggestion. Our author states this in the passage, Of these, etc. O ut of regard to some [special prom pting] : what is meant is, out of an intention or wish to obtain some special effect of hidden beauty or the like. Of a w ord’s m eaning: this is so because the nature of an inference is precise.As an accidental attach m en t (upädhi): The desire of the speak­er appears only as a qualification of the expressed or suggested mean­ing.

The inferential relation does not pervade vyangya- vyanjakabhâva in this way. So suggestiveness cannot be essentially identical with (cannot be a variety of) the inferential relation.§ 3.33 p A ]A A s in the area of expressed meanings it sometimes happens that their accuracy is apprehended by recourse to some other means of knowledge, yet even when they have been found to fall within the area of that other means of knowledge it is not denied that they were ob­jects of a verbaT activity, so also should it be with suggested meanings. Furthermore, in the area of poetry an inquiry into the truth or falsity of suggestions is useless; so the testing of the suggestive operation by other means of knowledge [like inference] is a laughable occupation.1 Thus it cannot be said that the apprehension of a suggested meaning is in all cases the apprehension of an inferable result. The sort of sugges­tiveness of a word which has for its object a suggested meaning that is also inferable2 is not the sort to which one could apply the term dhvani (poetic suggestion). It was mentioned by us, however, in order to show that an operation of words- characterized by suggestivenéss must be admitted even by those [Mlmämsakas] who posit an inborn connection between words and meanings, for our whole effort has been to show that the suggestiveness of words, whether of denotative or non-denotative words, whether by an inferential process or by any other process, is something that no school of philosophy can deny.Thus suggestiveness must of necessity be held to be different at least from such verbal modes as the secondary (metaphorical) and the de­notative. Although there are some who insist on forcing suggestiveness into those categories, this treatise on the special type of suggestiveness called dhvani, which has been composed for the removal of disagree­ment and for the enlightenment of men of taste, should not be scorned.

Such a suggestion, for example, as the fact that the speaker desires to communicate something.L Now it may be objected that after the suggested meaning is understood, its truth can be determined only by another means of knowledge, namely inference. So here again, the suggested meaning turns out to be inferable. But the objection is groundless. Of an expressed meaning also the truth can be determined only by inference. As [Kumärila] has said,If [you claim that] an inference is present there [viz., in cognitions of sentence meaning], namely, an inference drawn from the property of accuracy common to other statements of a reliable person, 1that does not prove that our understanding of the expressed sense is known from inference, but that the truth which belongs to the ex­pressed sense and is something in addition to it, is known from ex­perience. The same should hold for the suggested sense also. Our author says this in the passage beginning, As in.

So he says, F u rth erm o re, in th e area of poetry, etc. Useless: because from the sentences of poetry we do not seek for the performance of certain acts on the basis of the tranmission by the sentence of a meaning that is true, as we do from such Vedic setences as “agnistomafm juhuyätj” (one must offer a fire sacrifice). This is be­cause the end of poetry is pleasure, for it only by pleasure, in the form of an otherworldly delight, that it can serve to instruct us.

In view of such an objection, he says, [The so rt of suggestiveness th a t has for its object a suggestion] th a t is inferable, etc. He means that such suggestiveness does not characterize dhvani, because such suggestion does not operate on any object outside the intention of the speaker. But, the opponent may say, if the suggestiveness which has for its object the intention of the speaker, and is equivalent to an inference, does not deserve to be called dhvani, why did you mention it? He answers by saying, It was m entioned by us, however, etc. He examines this [purpose] briefly with the words, for our whole effort, etc.Inasmuch as we see that the suggestive (or revelatory) operation is aided: sometimes, as in the case of its suggesting the speaker’s in­tention, by inference; at other times, as when lamplight reveals [the objects in a room], by perception; sometimes, as when the sounds of a song: [reveal a rasa], by causality; sometimes, as in that form of dhvani where the expressed meaning is intended as leading on to a suggested meaning, by denotation; sometimes, as in that form of dhvani where the expressed meaning is not intended, by the secondary operation; it follows that we can prove its nature to be different from all these aux­iliaries. He states this in the words, Thus [suggestiveness m ust be held different], etc.The opponent may ask why we reduce the nature and extent of such well-known entities as the denotative and secondary operation. Why not say that suggestiveness is exactly of their nature but distinguished by subjection to a different set of conditions? 4 He addresses that ques­tion with the words, [A lthough th ere are some who insist on forc­ing it] into those categories, etc. What he means is that he does not begrudge their giving it whatever name they wish.

The word sämänya has been added here, making the sense clearer but de­stroying the meter. The whole verse, as Kumârila wrote it, runs thus: uâpta- vädävisamvädäd atra ced anumänatä / nirnayas tâvatâ siddhyed buddhyxit- pattir na tatkrtä.” If [you claim that] an inference is present there [viz., in cognitions of sentence meaning], namely, an inference drawn from the accu­racy belonging to statements of a reliable person, that inference merely proves that we judge [the sentence meaning]; it has nothing to do with our cognition of it.” Kumärila’s argument is directed against the Buddhists. The Buddhists claimed that there is no separate verbal means of knowledge (pramäna). You can know that there are mango trees by the river in only two ways: by per­ception, i.e., by going to the river and seeing them, or by inference, as when someone informs you that they are there. For if someone tells you, “There are mango trees by the river,\" it is by inference that you gain your knowledge. The inference will run thus: “There are mango trees by the river, because this sentence shares the property of being accurate with other sentences of speakers whom I have found to be reliable.” Kumârila points out that es­tablishing the truth of a sentence is distinct from understanding its meaning. The anti-Buddhist thesis is most clearly put by the verse which immediately follows: anyad eva hi satyatvam äptavädatvahetutvam / väkyärtha anya eveti jnätah pürvataras tatah. “The truth of the sentence is one thing and has its cause in its being the statement of a reliable person; the meaning of the sen­tence is something else, which must be known before its truth can be known.”2.

But now a type of poetry is envisaged where this sense is subordinated, the expressed meaning being more beautiful. This is called gunïbhûtavyangya. In this type, the suggestiveness of a subordinate element belongs sometimes to a sug­gested fact or situation which is understood from an expressed meaning that is set aside ( tiraskrta), but where the suggested element is still subordinate to the sentence meaning which is directly expressed. For example, the following:What an unique river of allurement is this, where waterlilies float together with the moon; from which arise an elephant’s cranial lobes, and where new trunks of plantain trees and steins of lotus fiber grow.[Attributed to King Vikramâditya] 1 Ini other cases the suggestiveness may belong to a meaning that is understood from the expressed meanings which are not set aside ( tiras- krta), but where the suggested meaning is subordinate in respect to the beauty of the poem because of the predominance of the expressed sense. An example is such a stanza as that already quoted [at 1.13 e A):The sunset is flushed with red, the day goes ever before.Ah, such is the way of fate that never the two shall meet.*A subordinate nature of the suggestion also results from the revealing of the very same thing by express words, as in the example [quoted at 2.22 a A]:Knowing that her gallant had set his heart on a rendezvous, the subtle lass smiled and to show her meaning folded the petals of the lotus in her hand.3The subordinate use of a suggested meaning in the form of a rasa and the like has previously been shown to be in the domain of the rasavat figure of speech (2.4-5). In this domain the subordination of these [rasas and the like] to the principal sense of the sentence is like a king’s following after his servant in the servant’s wedding procession.Where a suggested figure of speech is subordinated [to the expressed], we have the domain of such figures as dvpaka (see 1.13 f L and note 1)."},{"pageNumber":611,"pageContent":"5961.

Änanda quoted the stanza at 1.13 e as an example of the figure of speech äksepa. Abhinava preferred to identify the figure as samäsokti. Whichever we choose, the suggestion (of two lovers prevented by adverse fate from ever joining) is regarded as subordinate because it forms a figure of speech. Here the words sunset and day are clearly used in their literal sense, so the suggestion arising from them is atiraskrtaväcya. The word anuräga, however, presents a problem, for which see Abhinava's comment. 3. The stanza has already been quoted, 2.22 a A. The woman is hinting that her lover must wait to visit her until nightfall. But the suggestion is subordinated (or should we say spoiled?) by its being given away through a direct expression, •‘to show her meaning.\" Again, see Abhinava’s comment.[ § 3.34 AL After setting forth [in Chapters One and Two] the essential nature of dhvani together with its types and subtypes, and after giving [in the first part of Chapter Three] its forms from the viewpoint of the various possible suggestors, our author composed a section [viz., the Vrtti on 3.33] establishing the doctrine of suggestiveness1 in order to instill in the minds of students in a single lesson an understanding of the all-impotant relation of suggestor to suggested. Thus he has said all that need be said with regard to dhvani. But now, in order to justify the doctrine that the suggested sense is the soul of poetry by the [a fortiori] argument that this sense even when it is subordinated beautifies the words of a poet, he says,2 A different type, etc. What he intends is that [in this type of poetry] the connection with the suggested sense ornaments the expressed meaning.W hich has been described: viz., in the verse, “on the other hand, the suggested is something different,” etc. [1.4 K]. Has been called: viz., in the verse, “The type of poetry which the wise call dhvani,” etc. [1.13 K].The suggested sense is of three sorts: a fact or situation (vastu), a figure of speech, and a rasa or the like.3 From among these, our author now demonstrates in succession the subordinate use of the varieties which have been described of suggested fact or situation: In this type.W h at an unique river of allurem ent is this: This is the speech of a certain young man, which contains desire and wonder. In it"},{"pageNumber":612,"pageContent":"597the word “river” suggests the fullness [of a lady’s beauty], the word “waterlilies” the sidelong glances of her eyes, “the moon” her face, the words “elephant’s cranial lobes” her breasts, “trunks of plantain trees” her thighs, and “lotus stems” her arms. As the literal mean­ing of these words is wholly impossible, it is set aside in the man­ner that the literal meaning of “blinded” was set aside [in the ex­ample of “a mirror blinded by breath”].4 These meanings, although they are suggested, attain beauty [only] in the literal portion “what an unique [river] is this,” because here the literal meaning by emerging [in a single inclusive image] has submerged all the [individual] sugges­tions. Its beauty arises first from its becoming a stimulant (vibhäva) of wonder6 through its being a collection achieved by the coming to­gether in one beautiful place [viz., the wondrous river] of a number of the most precious objects in the world, such as waterlilies and the like, whose coming together can scarcely be imagined; in the second place, by its then being ornamented by the suggested meanings and thereby made delightful {vicitra), so that as this literal sense raises it­self up it becomes a stimulant of desire (abhiläsa) and the like [which lead to srngâramsa]. That is why, although there is to this extent a predominance here of the literal sense, this sense assumes a subordi­nate position to rasadhvani.6 This statement will be found to apply to the mode of operation in all cases of gunibkütavyangya; and that is why we have said over and over again7 that dhvani is the soul [of poetry].Other sensitive readers have explained the stanza as a speech refer­ring to a river which is beautified by the flowing charm of a number of young women who have entered it to play in the water. Even if one accepts this, the interpretation will be along the lines we have stated. Still another explanation is that it refers to a young woman who has come down to bathe and is standing by the river. But in all cases there is subordination of the suggested meanings since the suggestive activity occurs to this extent only because of the wonder [excited by the literal sense] which is primary.8A lready quoted: this example was explained in Chapter One. Our author has called the stanza an example of a suggestion where the primary sense is not püt aside (atiraskrta). He does so with the un­derstanding that the word anuräga (etymologically, “redness\"), which applies to desire (abhiläsa) because of its secondary sense of “being col­ored by redness,” is here used directly for passion as the word lâvanya [is used directly for beauty].9§ 3.34 L ]"},{"pageNumber":613,"pageContent":"T he very sam e thing: viz., the situation [embodied in the sugges­tion).

Anticipating such questions, our author shows by a well-known example that on the other hand it remains beautiful: In this dom ain, etc.; that is, in the rasavat and such figures of speech.Having thus shown how a suggested situation or rasa can be subor­dinate, he shows the same capability of the third variety of suggested sense, a figure of speech: W here a suggested figure of speech is subordinated, etc.: viz., a simile or the like.[ § 3.34 L1. The context seems to demand vyanjakatvavâda rather than vyanja- kaväda. 2. It will be noticed that in this passage Abhinava makes no distinction between the author of the Vrtti and of the Kärikäs. 3. Cf. 1.4 a A. 4. The example was adduced at 2.1c A to illustrate the atyanta-tiraskrta variety of avivaksitavâcya dhvani. Änanda does not here give any example of the other variety of avivaksitavâcya dhvani, called arthäntarasaii- kmmita. In interpreting the stanza here quoted Abhinava jumps directly from the literal meanings to the suggested meanings {vyangyä arthâh) without any mention of the secondary meanings (laksyâ arthâh) which call them forth. Patwardhan writes as follows. “This happens many times, as it is often not possible to state the prayojana separately from the laksya artha. Frequently the vyangya-prayojana is stated to be only an intensified degree (utkatatva or atisaya) of the laksya artha. For example, in gahgâyâm ghosah the vyangya- prayojana is stated as éaityapâvanatvâtisaya—an excessive degree of coolness and holiness—which is only an intensified form of saityapâvanatva, a property associated with the secondary sense, viz., the bank of the Ganges (gangätata). This difficulty of explaining the vyangya-prayojana distinctly from the laksya artha must have been the main reason why the bhaktivâdins wanted to oppose dhvani (suggested sense) and subsume it under bhakti or gunavrtti.” 5. Vi- smaya is the sthâyibhâva of adbhvtarasa. 6. Compare Abhinava’s remark at 1.13d L (Translation, p. 139). 7. See Translation, pp. 47, 49, 167. 8. Bythis sentence Abhinava seems to mean that the suggested meanings arise in order to render rational the literal sense, which has aroused woder. On the interpretation of the stanza as a whole Patwardhan writes as follows. “In the case of this stanza Abhinava gives three different explanations. According to the first explanation the stanza is a description of a beautiful woman who is spoken of as a river of loveliness. The several examples of ganîbhûtavyahgya"},{"pageNumber":614,"pageContent":"599arising out of the words sindhu, utpala, éasin, etc., become finally subor­dinated to the rasadhvani in the form of the suggested abhiläsarati of the speaker of the stanza for the beautiful woman in question. Under the second explanation the stanza is primarily a description of a river in which a number of beautiful women are swimming and playing. Under this explanation the gunîbhûtavyangya does not arise out of the word sindhu (as there is no jahal- laksanä in it), but it does arise out of the remaining words like utpala, sasin, etc. Here the gunîbhûtavyangya arising out of the words utpala, sasin, etc., be­comes subordinated to the rasadhvani in the form of the suggested abhiläsarati of the speaker for all the beautiful women. Under the third explanation the stanza is a description of a single beautiful woman standing near a river and wishing to make a plunge into it. Under this explanation, as under the first, all the words sindhu, utpala, sasin, etc., give rise to gunîbhûtavyangya, which then becomes subordinated to the rasadhvani in the form of the abhiläsarati of the speaker of the stanza for the beautiful woman in question. Abhinava introduces these three explanations without expressly showing his preference for or disapproval of any one of them. The Bälapriyä commentary, however, suggests that Abhinava is in favor of the first and third explanations and dis­approves of the second because under that explanation the blue waterlilies, the moon, etc., coexist not in a beautiful woman but in a river, which means that under the second explanation the stanza is a glorification of a river and not of a beautiful woman. The point likely to be raised by some that under the second explanation there is the suggestion of the speaker’s abhiläsarati for several women and hence it is inferior to the other two, is not important, as there is nothing improper (anucita) in a man’s entertaining abhiläsarati for several women. Even supposing that there were impropriety in such a case, it would still become an example of äbhäsa of abhiläsarati, which is aestheti­cally as enjoyable as abhiläsarati.” 9. See 3.34 A, note 2. While the words sunset and day can suggest a lady and her lover without abandoning their primary meanings, it would seem that anuräga can suggest the passion of the lady only by a mataphorical shift of anuräga from its etymological sense of redness. If so, the suggestion should be called tiraskrtaväcya (one where the primary meaning is set asaide). Abhinava admits the shift from the etymo­logical meaning, but says that anuräga is like the word lävanya (see 1.16 J? and 3.1c L, note 2) in being a frozen metaphor. On hearing it we have no sense of its etymological meaning. The primary sense may therefore be said not to be set aside.10. preyasvin is another name for preyo’lankâra, for which see 2.4 L, note 1 and 1.4 e A, note l._§ 3.34 L ]"},{"pageNumber":615,"pageContent":"«003 in tro d u ctio n AA And so,K To poems of which the words axe clear and deep and which bring him delight, a man of intelligence will attach just this character.11.

In these poems a man of intelligence “will recognize” this character, viz., of “a poetry of subordinated suggestion.”A To all poems which are charming because of meanings of this sort (viz., of subordinated suggestion) and so bring pleasure to men of discrimination, although these poems appear to be of infinitely varied natures, one should attach this character.

His son-in-law is Visnu, who ever exerts himself in the granting of all enjoyments and of final release. Then, too, his wife is the Ganges, who is the irresistible means of attaining all desirable things. Ambrosia and the moon are his children. 1 Here ambrosia means wine. As it is from bathing in the Ganges and worshipping the feet of Visnu that one gains laksmï (wealth) and from wealth that one attains the chief goal (of life on earth] characterized by the enjoyment of drinking par­ties at moonrise, we understand his preeminence throughout the three worlds. Ah! what a family does the ocean possess! The suggestion takes a subordinate position because of the word “ah.\" 21. They were born from the ocean when it was churned by the gods and demons. 2. The exclamatory word points expressly to the wonders suggested by the rest of the stanza and so shifts the suggestions from the category of dhvani to that of gunïbhütavyangya. just as the words “to show her meaning\" shifted the category of suggestion in the last example under 3.34 A.§ 3.36 A ]K All the expressed figures of speech are seen in poetry generally to attain the highest beauty when accompanied by a suggested element.A Those who have defined [the figures] have shown in part (eka- desena) how the expressed figures of speech attain an extra degree of beauty when accompanied by a suggested element, whether a situation or itself a figure of speech as the case may be. But in general all these [figures of speech], if they are carefully examined in poetic literature, are seen to be of this sort. Thus, just as dïpaka and samâsokti,1 other"},{"pageNumber":617,"pageContent":"602figures also are generally seen to be associated with a further suggested figure or suggested situation. For one thing, first of all, every figure of speech can be made to contain some hyperbole; and when so con­structed by great poets, it blossoms with a special poetic beauty. For how could the attachment of hyperbole, if managed with propriety to the subject matter, fail to impart a superiority to the poem?In defining hyperbole, when Bhämaha says:This is the whole of figured speech; by it the meaning is exalted.A poet must take pains with it,[for] what figure of speech is without it?[Bhämaha 2.85]we must here understand his meaning to be that inasmuch as there is extra beauty in any figure of speech over which, through a poet’s genius, hyperbole presides, whereas another [which lacks hyperbole] is a mere figure of speech, [we see that] hyperbole is able to incor­porate itself in all figures of speech; hence by a metaphorical use of identity, [Bhämaha can say that] it is every figure of speech. Now this mixture of hyperbole with another figure is sometimes done expressly and sometimes by suggestion. Furthermore, when it is suggested, it is sometimes predominant and sometimes subordinate. The first of these [three types] belongs to the expressed figures, the second to dhvani, the third to gunïbhûtavyangya.1. See 1.13d A and L; also 1.13e A and note 3.[ § 3.36 AL Having thus stated that a poem within the area of those with­out figures of speech, although it may appear empty from a superficial point of view, is made beautiful by the inner meaning [arising from sub­ordinated suggestion], he now shows that an [expressed] figure of speech is made more charming by the same means: [All] th e expressed [fig­ures of speech], etc. Being an elem ent of something means being subordinated to it.In p art (ekadeäena): by this term he refers to partial metaphor.1 So what he means is as follows. In a partial metaphor, such as,The pond-kings were fanned by autumn with her wild geese[Udbhata, l.*12 Induräja = 1.24 Vivrti]"},{"pageNumber":618,"pageContent":"603inasmuch as those who have defined the figures have shown that [the suggested metaphor that] the geese are fly-whisks becomes subordinate to the expressed [metaphor], kings,2 they have hereby indicated this sort [of subordinated suggestion]. Others3 have explained the word ekadeéena as referring solely to the complex character4 of the literal portion [of am ekadesavivartin rûpaka or partial metaphor] and thus their explanation is not sufficiently developed (anudbhinna).s[Seen to be associated, etc.:] The word vyangyälankäräntara- va3tvantarasamsparsino means, [are seen] as being those which touch upon, that is, cling to for their own ornamentation, some other, sug­gested, figure of speech or some other suggested situation. G reat po­ets: Kalidasa, etc. He now gives the reason why such [a figure of speech] blossoms, as he has said, with poetic beauty: For how could, etc. The particle hi expresses cause. How could th e attach m en t of hyperbole fail to im part a superiority: he means that such [a failure of hyperbole] is not found in poetry, if only the poet constructs the hyperbole while keeping in mind what is appropriate to his subject.Thus, to take an example of Bhattenduräja:A tremulousness of the eyes.hesitating in mid-glance;limbs daily growing thinnerlike severed lotus stems;and cheeks so pale they seemedto imitate white dürva grass:such was the costume put on by the gopisas they and Krishna came of age.8Here the hyperbole is justified, as its object is the beauty of the Blessed One whose form was that of the love-god. Accordingly, the figure ex­hibits an otherworldly beauty in the poem. But when inappropriate, the beauty fails. For example:God made space too small; for he reckoned not that such would be the future expansion of your breasts.Now it may be asked just how hyperbole is latent in suggested form-- in every figure of speech. For [an opponent may urge that] Bhämaha spoke of hyperbole as being a generic character of all figures of speech. Now a generic character does not appear from a word separately and at a later time than one’s perception of its particularity. So how can§ 3.36 L ]"},{"pageNumber":619,"pageContent":"hyperbole be suggested? 7 Anticipating this question, our author says, B häm aha says, etc. Here we must construe together words which are separated from one another, thus: “when Bhämaha says ... , we must here understand his meaning to be ... ” And what does Bhämaha say? This is [the whole of figured speech], etc. That which has been defined as hyperbole is the whole of figured speech, that is, is every sort of figure of speech, for Bhämaha has said:An unusual or striking form of word or meaning ( vakrokti) is consideredan ornament (alankrti) of poetic utterance.®For the “bent” (vakra) form of a word or of a meaning (ukti) is its pre­sentation in an unusual or striking form (lokottîrnena räpena) and this constitutes the ornament of a figure of speech (alankärasyälankärah). Now hyperbole is precisely the property of being unusual or striking (lokottaratä). Hence hyperbole is a common property of all figures of speech. Thus, [to explain the second quarter of Bhämaha 2.85 quoted by the Vrttikära: “by it the meaning is exalted (vibhävyate)\"] it is by this hyperbole that a meaning which has been worn out by everyone’s use of it can be given new variety and interest [vibhävyate = vicitratayâ bhävyate]. Again, it is hereby that pleasure gardens and the like can be turned into vibhävas (i.e., stimulants of the rasa of love) [vibhävyate = vibhävatäm nîyate]. And the matter is hereby endowed with a special property, i.e., is given a content of rasa [vibhävyate = visesena bhävy­ate|. This is what Bhämaha actually said.9 As to what he meant here, our author continues, by a m etaphorical use of identity [Bhämaha can say that] it is every figure of speech.Our author states the relation which furnishes the cause10 of the metaphorical usage by saying, [hyperbole is able to incorporate itself] in all figures of speech. He states the purpose (prayojana) of the metaphorical usage in the clause running from inasm uch as th ere is an ex tra beauty to another is a m ere figure of speech. He points out also the blocking of the primary sense (mukhyärthabädha) in the words through a p o et’s genius, etc. 11What our author has in mind is the following. To begin with, if hyperbole were a generic character in all figures of speech, it would in effect be essentially identical with them and no figure of speech would be without it. Such being the case, no poetic genius would be needed in [constructing] it and no “mere figure of speech” [i.e., figure lacking hyperbole] would be found to exist. On the other hand, if what is meant [by Bhämaha] is that hyperbole is the life of poetry, then it might be"},{"pageNumber":620,"pageContent":"605inhibited by a lack of propriety. Now if hyperbole constructed with propriety is the life of poetry, then, since nothing else can regulate this propriety than the rasas, bhävas, and the like, we shall have to admit that it is they (the rasas, bhävas, and the like) that are the chief inner life of poetry, not hyperbole. [Incidentally12], this refutes those critics who say, “When a poem consists in beautiful words constructed with propriety, what is the use of another factor called dhvani, as the soul of poetry?” 13 For this saying, of which they are so proud, witnesses their admission of the existence of dhvani}* Accordingly, this [statement of Bhämaha that hyperbole is all the figures of speech] is a metaphor, because [we see that] the primary sense is blocked and [that] there is both a cause and a purpose of the metaphorical usage of identity. Accordingly, it is correct to say that hyberbole is suggested.Our author now divides into three types the joining to itself by hy­perbole of another figure of speech, [a mixture] of which he has just spoken: [Now this m ixture] of hyperbole, etc. Expressly: that is, the hyperbole may be expressly stated, as in “what an unique river of allurement is this” (cf. 3.34 A). Here we have hyperbole attaching itself to the literal meaning of the words in a metaphor.15 Our author now distinguiahes the areas [of the three hyperboles]: [The first] of these. What is meant is, the first among the three types. 1§ 3.36 L ]1. Thus, Abhinava understands Änanda to say that the older critics showed how a suggested figure of speech could give an extra beauty to an ex­pressed figure by [their exposition of] partial metaphor. This interpretation, I thinks wrongly restricts Ananda’s meaning. The older critics certainly recog­nized the suggestions implicit in dîpaka, samäsokti, and other figures besides that of metaphor. 2. That the geese are fly-whisks is obviously subordi­nate, as the suggestion would never occur to us without our understanding the expressed metaphor that the ponds are kings. 3. Abhinava often refers to the Candrikäkära by a plural pronoun. Here he may be simply criticizing the comment of a single predecessor. 4. vaicitrya: the word should have the same sense here that it bears in 3.331 L (Text, p. 436, line 4 of Locana). Thus, the “other” interpretation would be that Udbhata and others pointed out the suggested figure in speaking of the complex character of ekadeia- vivartin metaphors. 5. Because the other commentator(s) failed to make any reference to the subordination of the suggested metaphor. And indeed neither Udbhata nor the other older writers do make any such reference. “In­sufficiently developed” seems to me a better rendering of anudbhinna than BP’s “unclear” (aspast&rtha). although the word does also have that sense.6. Abhinava has already quoted this verse of his teacher at 1.4 g L, where"},{"pageNumber":621,"pageContent":"606he commented on other aspects of it. 7. The opponent’s point is this. By saying that all figures of speech are just hyperbole, Bhämaha is making hy­perbole the sämänya of the visesas represented by simile, metaphor, etc., just as bovinity (gotva) is the sämänya (generic character) of all cows. But the Nyäya-Vaisesika doctrine is that a sämänya inheres in its visesas; it is insep­arable from and synchronous with them. Bovinity is perceived together with and synchronously with our perception of a cow. Such is the Nyäya-Vaisesika doctrine; we need not here question it by means of modern experiments in epistemology. So how can the Vrttikära say that hyperbole is a suggested meaning, which arises after and separately from our understanding of the ex­pressed simile or metaphor? 8. Bhämaha 1.36, quoted above at 1.1 c L and see note 4 thereon. 9. The word tävat implies that he did not say that vakrokti was the generic character inhering in the particular alaiikäras as the opponent just argued.10. For nimitta (cause) as one of the three conditions of the metaphorical or secondary operation, see 2.1 L, note 2 and 2.1 b L. The nimitta is actualy the relation between the expressed object and the object of the secondary usage, here the relation between hyperbole and all figures of speech, viz., a relation of soul and body. 1 1. Prayojana and mukhyärthabädha are the other two conditions for metaphorical operation; see 2.1 L, note 2. Abhi- nava will demonstrate in what follows just how the word kavipratibhävasät shows the blocking of the primary sense. 1 2. Supplied by BP. 13. These critics must be predecessors of Ksemendra, who in his Aucityairicämcarcä has propounded the hypothesis that autcitya is the soul of rasa. See Kärikä 3 of that work: autcityasya camatkärakärinas cärucarvane / rasajïvitabhütasya vicäram kante 'dhunä. 14. It witnesses it because the “propriety\" of which it speaks is regulated by the rasas and the like, which can be suggested only by rasadhvani. So BP. 15. (Patwardhan) The hyperbole in the stanza under discussion arises from the use of the words aparä eva and it is therefore expressly stated. It is the kind of atisayokti which Mammata 10, p. 628, characterizes as prastutasya yad anyatvam, i.e., as representing the matter under discussion as something altogether different from its own self, as being out of the ordinary. Abhinava’s remark that in this stanza there is a räpaka (metaphor) is to be explained as follows. When it is said, \"iyam (purah, sthitä yvvatih) aparä eva lävanyasindhuh,” there is clearly a superimposition (äropa) of the upamäna (lävanyasindhuh.) on the upameya (iyam) and so the presence of rüpaka cannot be denied. The BP’s explanation is half right and half wrong. It is right in saying that the atisayokti is located in the words aparä eva. It is wrong in stating that the räpaka consists in the representation of the eyes, face, breasts, thighs, and arms of the lady as waterlilies, moon, elephant’s cranial lobes, plantain trunks, and lotus stems. For according to Abhinava (3.34 L) the words “waterlilies,” “moon,” etc., are cases of laksanä (secondary metaphorical operation) based on the suggestion of a prayojana and are not[ § 3.36 L"},{"pageNumber":622,"pageContent":"607cases of rüpaka at all. When once the words “waterlilies,\" etc., are adjudged to be loci of laksanâ and cases of gunïbhütavyangya, they cannot be regarded any longer as loci of rüpakas. The seat of the rüpaka in the stanza is the phrase tyam lâvanyasindhvh; the seat of the atiéayokti is the phrase aparä evo.§ 3.36a A ]A And this method of operation [sc., by subordinating itself to a second figure] is found among other figures of speech as well; but other figures cannot subordinate themselves to the whole range of figures. Hyperbole can be subordinated to all figures; that is its peculiarity. Among those figures which receive their title as figures from a notion of similarity, that is, among metaphor, simile, tulyayogitä (equal pairing) . 1 nidarsanä(demonstration, instruction) ,2 and the like, we may say that all these figures when they partake of an exceptional beauty are loci of subordinated suggestion (gunïbhütavyangya).In samäsokti,3 âksepa* paryäyokta,s and the like, inasmuch as they cannot gain their title to these figures without the suggested element, their containing of subordinated suggestion is obvious.In this matter [of subordinated suggestion], some figures of speech are limited to the suggestion of only certain other figures of speech. For example, trick praise (vyâjastuti) 6 must contain [as a suggested elefnent] complimentary address (preyo’lankâra)7 For some figures of speech [on the other hand] the rule is merely that they shall contain some [suggested] figure or other. For example, poetic doubt (sandeha) and the like may contain simile [or other figures].8 Some figures may suggest one another, as dïpaka (zeugma) and simile. Here it is well known that dïpaka regularly contains a suggestion of simile;9 but a simile may occasionally join to itself a touch of dïpaka, as in a garland simile (mälopamä). For example a touch of dïpaka is obvious in such verses as the following:As by its flame of glorious light a lamp,[as by the Milky Way the path of heaven, as by his Sanskrit speech a learned man, so by Pârvatï her father was both sanctified and given beauty] .10"},{"pageNumber":623,"pageContent":"1.

See 3.27 A.10. KumSam. 1.28. Pärvatl’s father is the Himalaya Mountain. In each flower of the garland the notion of zeugma is present. Sanskrit being the sacred language and also the most beautiful of languages, a learned man is both sanctified and given beauty by his use of it. The Milky Way, in Indian mythology, is the Ganges of Heaven. As the Ganges washes away all sins and as the Milky Way is beautiful, the same zeugma applies to the night sky. Fire purifies, and so a lamp is sanctified as well as rendered beautiful by its flame. For the close connection in Kalidasa's mind between beauty and holiness, see Ingalls. Kâlidâsa and the Golden Age, pp. 19-20.608 [ § 3.36 a AL But now, if hyperbole alone is like this [viz., present in all other figures of speech], with response to what [else] was a hierarchy suggested [by the Vrtti] in its saying, \"first of all” [3.36 A]?

Thus we have [mere] simile in “A wild ox is like a domestic ox” ;1 metaphor, in “The khalevali2 is a sacrificial post”; double meaning (slesa), in the technical repetition of [dvirvacane] employed in “dwrvacane 'ct'.” 3 We have (an unpoetic use of) sequential ordering in “tüdîsalâtura,4 of zeugma (dïpaka) in gäm asvam;s of embodiment of doubt (sasandeha) in “it may be [a man] or a post’’ ;6 of denial (apahnuti) in “This is not silver” ;7 of periphrasis (paryâyokta) in “the fat man eats not in the daytime” ;8 of equal pairing (tulyayogitä) in usthâ-ghvor ic ca” ;9 of aprastutaprasarnsâ10 in all those [enunciations of Panini] which are indicative [of some extraneous fact], as for example his use of the word anta [in 1.4.14] in defining the technical designation “word,” for this use implies that the principle of tadantavidhi cannot be applied when a suffix is used in the defining of a technical designation. 11 We have äksepa (a hint in the form of a denial) 12 in the double options (ubhayatravi- bhäsäh) [of Panini], because, in order to prescribe particular options, he denies even that which he seeks before prescribing it, on the principle that after [the whole area] is levelled by a prohibition, [the particulars may be reconstituted] .13 We have hyperbole in “The bowl is an ocean,” or “The Vindhya Mountain grew so high it seized the path of the sun” ;14 and other figures in like fashion.As such [examples] are of no use to poetry, it is subordinated sug-~ gestion, the heart of figurative speech, which, when defined, defines the figures properly. By it they are completely defined, that is, con­tained; otherwise, our definitions must surely fall short of the mark.15"},{"pageNumber":626,"pageContent":"611Our author states this in speaking of reciting the peculiarities of each p articu lar figure. There can be no general definition of hyperbole, vakrokti (striking expression)16, si ile, and the like, if they lack beauty. So it is this subordinated suggestion, since the beauty [of a figure] is dependent on it, that furnishes the general definition.Furthermore, the beauty of a suggested meaning is no more than its ability to manifest rasa, and since rasa, as the end product of the aesthetic process, is itself bliss, there is no infinite regress here. 17For they are endless: We have explained this in Chapter One in commenting on our author’s statement that “the possibilities of speech are endless.” 18But now, it is not the case that a second [subordinate] figure appears in every figure of speech. So how can all figures be included by defining subordinated suggestion? The objection is needless. The suggestion which is subordinate may be a fact (or situation), or it may be a rasa. Our author states this in the words, T here is also an area of sub­ordinated suggestion, etc. In a different way: that is, by the suggestion’s being of a fact or of a rasa.Or,'one may lay the ground for the author’s remark in a different way, as follows. It might be objected that if the figures of speech eure to be defined by means of subordinated suggestion, why is that definition not now given? To which the author replies by saying, T h ere is also an area of subordinated suggestion, etc. Here the word “area” will mean area to be defined. And how is it to be defined? By defining it as a type, different from that of dhvani (predominant suggestion) , 19 where the poet accompanies the expressed statement by the suggestion of a fact or situation. So, when suggestion (vyaiigya) has been defined, and the subordinate variety of it has been described, what further definition is there to give? This is the final meaning.Having thus established that suggestion (dhvani) is the soul of poetry, he sums up with the passage that begins with “This [second form ]” and ends with “some touch of suggested m eaning.” Then, to show that this suggestion, as it is the secret of the poetry of all great poets, is no matter of deception or idle praise, he says, Those who are wiseill honor it, etc. 1 21. This is the standard Nyäya example of upamäna, NyäyaSBhäsya 1.1.6.2. Thekhalevalî is the wooden post in the center of a threshing floor. To it is tied the ox who tramples out the grain. 3.

The Siddhântakaumudï has a dif­ferent interpretation, but also takes the word dvirvacane in two different senses (as dvirvacananimitte and as dvirvacane). The double meaning is necessary, as the sütra must express two conditions if correct forms are to be generated from it. 4. Pan. 4.3.94. The full sütra is tüdisaläturavarmatikücaväräd dhakchandhanyakah, ‘To tüdî, éalâtura, varmatï, and kûcavâra are appended respectively the suffixes dhak, chan, dhan, and yak.” 5. The words are pos­sibly taken from a verse quoted in the Mahäbhäsya under 2.2.29, Värt. 1: ahar ahar nayamäno gäm as'vam purusam pasum / vaivasvato na trpyati suräyä iva durmadi, “Though every day consuming ox, horse, man, and beast, death is no more slaked than is a drunkard by his rum.” As the word nayamäno is construed with both gäm and aévam, the sentence qualifies as a dîpaka.6.

After the erroneous perception that “this is silver,” the correc­tion, if it occurs, takes the form, “This is not silver.” 8. For definitions of paryäyokta see Bhämaha 3.8, Dandin 2.295, Udbhata with Induraja 4.6. The definitions of Bhämaha and Dandin will apply to any roundabout way of con­veying information and so would include the here quoted sentence, which may be regarded as simply a periphrasis of “the fat man eats at night.\" The same statement has been quoted before by Abhinava (1.4g L and note 21) as the MTmämsaka’s stock example of material implication (arthäpatti). 9. Pän. 1.2.17. The sütra prescribes the effect of certain suffixes on the verbal root sthä and on those roots which are technically called ghu. As both sthä and ghu refer to entities within the same area of discourse (both are verbal roots), the figure is here identified as tulyayogitä, not dxpaka. Compare what was said in 1.13 f L, note 1.1 0. See 1.13 j A and note 1. 1 1. Normally, in Panini's work we are tointerpret a mere suffix as referring to a word ending in that suffix. This rule of interpretation is called tadantavidhi. But the rule does not hold in the defining of technical designations. Panini does not state this exception explicitly, but gives us an indication of it by defining “word\" as “that which ends in a case­ending or personal ending\" (suptinantam padam), for if there were no such exception, he would have omitted the word anta (“which ends in”). 12. See1.13e. A and note 3. 13. An ubhayatravibhäsä is a pratisedhapürvaka-vikalpah “an option preceded by a prohibition,” just as the figure of speech äksepa is a pratisedhapürvako viéesapmtipattih “the conveying of a particular, preceded by a prohibition.\" Hence the illustration furnished by Abhinava. An explanation of why an ubhayatravibhäsä came to be regarded as a pratisedha­pürvako vikalpah cannot be given briefly and a reader who is intimidated by Sanskrit grammar is advised to skip the rest of this note. Pan. 1.1.44 defines[ § 3.36 b L"},{"pageNumber":628,"pageContent":"613the term vibhäsä thus: na veti vibhäsä. The Käsikä, following the guidance of Patahjali, interpreted this to mean “[If the operation may either] not [take place], or [take place], [the situation shall be called] “vibhäsä” (option). Paul Kiparski (p. 228) has shown that this is certainly not what Panini intended, but the interpretation has become standard among Sanskrit grammarians and is said to explain why Panini did not use the simple word vä (“or”) in many instances of option. The argument runs thus. Options are of three sorts. A präptavibhäsä is where something already prescribed is made optional. For example, of the root ivi, to swell, we are told that the vi must convert to u before weak endings (6.1.15). Thus one generates the form suivvatvh, “they both swelled.” However, the form without contraction, sisviyatvh, must also be allowed. Such an option will be a präptavibhäsä, for it makes a previous rule only optional. It will be seen that a präptavibhäsä is in effect an optional rej tion of a rule. On the other hand, before strong endings there is no rule for contraction of vi in svi. Thus we generate the form stisväya “he swelled” (with strengthening of the vi to väy by Pan. 7.2.115). But the form s'usava (with vt contracted to u, which is then strengthened to äv) must also be allowed. This will be an apräptavibhäsä, for it is an option to follow a procedure (contraction before a strong ending) for which there exists no rule. It will be seen that an apräptavibhäsä is in effect an optional prescription. Now if Panini, when he came to allow these options in 6.1.30, had simply said vä sveh, “[contraction] of svi may occur [in the perfect tense],” we might understand either that the präptavibhäsä was allowed, or that the apräptavibhäsä was allowed, but not both, because, so say the commentators, the force of vä would be used up in making the one type of option and would no longer be available for the other. Hence Panini invented the special term vibhäsä to permit a third type of option, the double option (ubhayatravibhäsä). The force of this word vibhäsä, says the Käsikä, is first to prohibit (pratisedha) contraction of svi by levelling the whole area (samikrte visaye), and then to inaugurate a particular option. Thus the technical term “tribhäsä,” or its referent, a double option, is in effect an option preceded by a prohibition. 14. The first of these examples is frequently used in the Mahäbhäsya (e.g., on 1.4.24, 2.3.50, 2.3.67, 3.2.110). In all cases it is followed by vindhyo vardhitakam, “The heap of rice is a Vindhya.” It is not clear to me why Abhinava has changed the second example. 15. Literally, “otherwise there would be an avyäpti,” that is, a definition of insufficient extension. J. Masson is tempted to emend to ati- vyäpti. The trouble with the traditional definition of simile, he says, is that it is too wide, not too narrow. It includes such mundane statements as “a wild ox is like a domestic-ox,” as well as the poetic uses. This is true, but only from the viewpoint of particular definitions. They are too wide. But from the viewpoint of a general definition, the traditional work of the älan- kärikas is too narrow. Even if we add up all their definitions of the figures, we never arrive at the heart of figurative speech, at that quality of it which§ 3.36 b L ]"},{"pageNumber":629,"pageContent":"614gives beauty to poetry. 16. Abhinava seems to take vakrokti here as the name of a specific figure. 17. It might be argued that if the beauty of the alankäras is caused by the beauty of subordinated suggestion, that beauty in turn must be caused by some other factor, and that factor by still another. But if the beauty of subordinated suggestion is tied to rasa, there will be no infinite regress, for ras a is the end product of the aesthetic process. It is itself bliss. 18. In 1.1c L, where Abhinava assigned three meanings to “speech” (väk): word, meaning and denotative function. 19. Here lies the main difference between Abhinava’s second (and therefore preferred) interpretation and his first. In the first, the words “in a different way” were taken to mean “in a way different from the suggestion of a figure of speech.” Under the present interpretation they are taken to mean “different from the definition of dhvani.\"[ § 3.36 b LK Of the words of great poets, even if they contain [other] orna­ments (figures of speech), this luster of the suggested is the foremost gem, like bashfulness in women.A By means of it even a trite subject is brought to a special kind of beauty. For example:Prompted by intimacy and by Love’s command, the soft-eyed damsel uses graceful gestures which are indescribable and come forth ever new.I must find some solitary spot to ponder them with my whole thought in constant meditation.The literal sense of the word ke ’pi is “indescribable.\" What beauty is not given by the easy and endless suggested sense arising from this? * 11. The suggestion, as BP points out, is that the gestures must be utterly delighhtful since they are incapable of being defined.L The words forem ost and gem go together [although in the Sanskrit they are separated]. The phrase “even if they contain [other]"},{"pageNumber":630,"pageContent":"615ornaments” [means also by implication] “even if they are devoid of ornaments.” The luster, that is, resplendence, brought about by what is suggested is like bashfulness,1 as they both come to life from a beauty the essence of which is concealment. Bashfulness is the chief gem of ladies even if they are wearing jewels. Bashfulness is that by which a luster is suggested2 in the form of that beauty of the heart which bursts forth from inner emotion, for bashfulness is a manifestation of emotion in the form of a desire to hide the workings of love which are bursting forth from within. For we see no trace of bashfulness in ascetics who are devoid of the emotions of love, even if their loincloth is taken away. For an example [of bashfulness] see the stanza of a certain poet, “She freezes like a deer.”3Also [one may take pratiyamänacchäyä lajjä to mean] bashfulness which gives beauty to the suggested yearning, beseeching, and hurt pride of one’s beloved.4 For the ocean of love, meeting with the em­bankment of bashfulness, constantly throws forth amorous gestures in the form of mutual alterations of eyes and limbs; all this is the working of bashfulness, which is a beauty the essence of which is concealment.P ro m p ted by intim acy: The com m and is imperative, being given by the holy teacher, Love, whose rule is honored throughout the world and who can therefore dispel bashfulness and timidity. The gestures are presented at the time of intim acy, that is, at the time of love-play, when the command is obeyed, as it must be, by the dropping of fear and bashfulness. The gestures are of a soft-eyed dam sel; this shows that they are rendered pure by glances appropriate to her being overcome by the genuine enjoyment of love-play. By gestures are meant all the other amorous alterations of eyes and limbs; hence they are said to be aksunnâh, that is to say, they flash forth at every moment in new forms. They are to be m editated upon —here the gerundive has the sense of “can be” and “should be”5—with one’s whole (thought), that is, with no other object of attention, by one who has retired to a solitary spot. This is because they are “indescribable”; they cannot be understood in any other way.§ 3.37 L ]1. In this analysis of pratiyamänacchäyä lajjä, Abhinava takes pratiya­mänacchäyä as a madhyamapadalopi karmadhäraya, with pratiyamänacchäyä as the upameya and lajjä as the upamäna. 2. Here Abhinava is taking pratiyamänacchäyä as an instrumental bahuvrihi modifying lajjä. 3. The"},{"pageNumber":631,"pageContent":"complete stanza is printed at the foot of p. 476 of the Kashi edition of our text. In English one may give it thus:She freezes like a deer f cinated by a song;she asks her friend to tell again the tidings of her dear one;she daydreams without sleeping: O, I know the signs;Cupid has begun to water the new flower in her heart.The point of Abhinava’s quoting the verse is that it expresses how bashful­ness restrains the passion springing from the heart. The stanza is quoted by Mammata and Hemacandra and is attributed by SüktiM. to Trivikrama- bhatta. Trivikrama was the author of the Nalacampv and the Madâlasa- campü-, see Raghavan, Bhoja’s SP, pp. 783, 801. There exists an inscription of a.d. 915 composed by him. The stanza in question might well be placed in the mouth of the heroine’s confidante. 4. Literally, “bashfulness by which there arises a luster of the suggested yearning,” etc. This third interpretation is like the second in taking pratïyamànacchâyâ as a bahuvrihi, but this time the bahuvrihi is regarded as xn/adhikarana. The word anunâthana seems to have been forgotten by the dictionaries. Here, as in Kathäsaritsägara 2.6.89 (kupitänvnäthanäni), it means beseeching, conciliation, begging for forgive­ness. 5. Pan. 3.3.169 and 172.016 [ § 3.37 LK The understanding of a different matter that may appear by a change of voice (Arafat), it being subordinate, belongs to this variety of suggestion.A The understanding of a different matter that appears by a change of voice, if the suggested matter is subordinate [to that which is denoted by the words], belongs to this variety of poetry characterized by subordinated suggestion. As i “They will be safe, the Dhärta- rästras, while I am alive? ” 1 Or as in:So I am an adultress? Come off it, chaste wife!You have not sullied your character?But I am not like the wife of a somebody who is making love to a barber;2[Sattasai 5.17]"},{"pageNumber":632,"pageContent":"617because it is primarily the direct force of the words, which is only helped out by the change of voice which one may infer from the inher­ent capability of the denoted meanings, that is here the cause of our understanding the particular [suggested] meaning; not the change of voice alone. For if we were to change the matter of which the words speak, no change of voice that the speaker might invent could give us an understanding of such a meaning.As the meaning is obtained from the inherent capability of the (di­rectly denoted] meanings, although it is strengthened by the operation of the words in conjunction with a particular change of voice, it be­longs to the type called suggested meaning (vyangya); and when we apprehend the meaning of a denotation of this particular sort [viz., of the sort qualified by change of voice], as following upon the direct des­ignation, we refer to the poetry which suggests such a meaning as the poetry of subordinated suggestion (gunïbhûtavyangya). For any poem which states a direct meaning qualified by a particular suggestion is a case of subordinated suggestion.1. Venisarnhära, 1.10 (Madras), 1.8 (Poona). The words are Bhïma’s and so imply the opposite. We would attain the effect in English by raising and accenting the word “I,” and not dropping the voice at the end of the sentence. 2. Abhinava will explain the tone used in each phrase and the suggestions.§ 3.38 L ]L [The Kärikä] furnishes another example of subordinated sug­gestion: T h e understanding of a different m atter, etc. The word kähi1 is derived from the verbal root kaka “to be greedy” (Dh.P. 1.90). The derivation from greediness is because a word by being enunciated in the expectant or non-expectant [tone] seeks for (i.e., is greedy for] a meaning over and above its ordinary sense. Or, the derivation may be from ku in the sense of “a little, slightly,” with the substitution of k& for ku (by Pan. 6.3.105) [plus ku meaning earth or ground]. Thus, kähi is the “slight ground” by which we apprehend the matter that is in the speaker’s heart. Now, the type of poetry where we “understand a different matter” by means of this “slight ground” belongs to the type of subordinated suggestion. The reason why it belongs to this type is that the suggested sense is here subordinated. By the phrase “the understanding of a different matter” the Kärikä is referring to a poem; it does not mean that the understanding itself is subordinated suggestion. Or, [one may say that] a poem is so described [viz., as"},{"pageNumber":633,"pageContent":"u i8 [ § 3.38 Lsubordinated suggestion] because of the understanding [through kâku of some further sense subordinated to the poem’s literal sense].Others explain that this variety [gunïbhütavyangya] occurs only when the sense suggested [by kâku] is subordinated,2 saying that otherwise we should have dhvani proper. This is wrong, for when kâku is used, the suggestion that unfolds from it is always subordinate because it is touched upon (or revealed by) a word. This is because, as kâku is a particular property of a word, [the suggestion] which the kâku touches upon is merely aided (anugrhïta) by it, just as the suggestions are aided by an [additional] word in “Thus did the GopT once express a hint to Hari” (2.21 d A), or “The subtle lass smiled and to show her meaning folded the petals of the lotus” (2.22 a A) .3 That is why, if we were to add kâku to the verse, “Go your rounds freely, pious monk,” that verse would become subordinated suggestion [rather than dhvani], for everyone would take its suggestion as hereby being made obvious.They will be safe: The tones on the separate elements of this line: svasthâh, bhavanti, mayi jivati, Dhärtarästräh. are varied by being ex­pectant, fiery, interrupted, high-pitched, rising, and falling.'1 The tone touches upon the suggestion that the thing is impossible, that it is ut­terly wrong, and being aided by this suggestion transforms the denoted sense, now embellished by the suggestion, into a symptom of anger.5So I am an adulteress: [Abhinava translates the Prakrit verse into Sanskrit and then comments:] “So I am an adulteress” has the tone of an admission but is expectant and spoken with ridicule. Com e off it: as this is delivered with non-expectant tone, it carries a hint.6 C haste wife: with fiery tone and a sneer. You have not sullied your character: in expectant and interrupted tone.7 B ut I am not like th e wife of a som ebody who is m aking love to a b arber: that is, to an outcaste. This is delivered in non-expectant tone, inter­rupted and with ridicule. The whole stanza is addressed to a lady of good family but who is in love with a barber, by the speaker, whose adultery the lady had seen and ridiculed. The stanza furnishes ridicule in return. What is important in the stanza is the tone (kâku) in which it is spoken.In order to show the subordination [of the suggestion] he proves first that it is touched by [i.e., forms an object of] the component words^ [because it is] th e direct force of th e words, etc. But then, one may ask, how can the meaning be “suggested” ? 8 Anticipating this question, our author says, As th e m eaning is [obtained], etc. Next he shows that [this suggested meaning] is subordinate: [and when"},{"pageNumber":634,"pageContent":"619we apprehend th e m eaning as following upon] th e direct designation. The process of suggestion follows upon and is therefore subordinate to direct designation. As we apprehend [in cases of fcäAu] a direct meaning as qualified by a particular suggestion, it is assumed that the poem is revelatory of just that [viz., of a particular sugges­tion] and it takes its name [viz., the poetry of subordinated suggestion] from that. It follws that wherever we find käku, we have subordinated suggestion. So those who would speak of a metonymy of reversed sense (viparïtalaksanâ) 9 in such a line as “I will not crush in my anger a hundred Kauravas in battle” 10 have not judged the matter properly. For we understand the negative here as being itself negated by force of the fiery, high-pitched, interrupted and expectant tone on na kopät (“not ... in my anger”), which we apprehend at the very time that the words are pronounced and which is [placed on these words] because of [Bhlma's] feeling that the peace policy persued by Yudhisthira is insuf­ferable. As none of the obstacles is here present, such as blocking of the primary meaning, which require resorting to metonymy, what chance is there for metonymy to come into play? In a Vedic phrase like “one must sacrifice on the darsa,”n as there is no other means available such as change of tone, there may well be metonymy by reversed sense. But enough on an incidental matter. 12 1 2§ 3.38 L ]1. In the commentary which now follows Abbinava combines the sense which käku bears in the works of the Älankärikas (a change of voice indicative of some extra meaning) with the sense which it bears in BhNÉ 17.102ff. To Bharata käku is one of the properties of enunciation along with pitch, place of utterance, phonetic content and concatenation. Tone in general rather than change of tone seems to be what Bharata has in mind. He divides käku into expectant (säpeksa) and non-expectant (nirapeksa). As so used, “expectant” means an interrogative tone, “non-expectant\" a declarative tone. These terms have a different sense in the grammatical literature; see Mahä- bhäsya on 2.1.1. V. M. Kulkami, The Treatment of Intonation, gives a useful summary of the views of later Älankärikas on käku. But he says nothing of the varieties other than säpeksa and nirapeksa, for which see note 4 below.2. The normal meaning of the VVtti’s phrase gunibhdve sati would certainly be the sense given by these “others.” viz., so long as, or. only where, there is subordination. But Abhinava has noticed that neither Kärikä nor Vrtti ever gives an example of käku functioning as predominant suggestion or dhvani. Accordingly, he interprets the phrase to mean “since there is subordination.” Thus by a dubious interpretation he improves on his author. 3. One must not push Abhinava’s analogy too far. All he means to do is to reinforce the"},{"pageNumber":635,"pageContent":"620fact that the word on which käku is placed takes as obj t the very same suggestion that is unfolded by the käku. The käku does not, however, “give away” the suggestion in the way that the words salesam and arpitäkütam give away the suggestions in his analogies. Without the words svasthäh, bhavanti, etc., we would not know at all to what the impossibility referred. In Abhi- nava’s analogies on the other hand, the suggestion is already presented, at least to a trained audience, before the words salesam and arpitäkütam are added.4. Of these six adjectives we have already spoken of “expectant\" in note 1 above. “Fiery” (dipta) is what Bharata calls an ornament (BhNÉ 17.113) by which he means a special type of tone. “Interrupted” (gadgada) is a term not used by Bharata; see note 7 below. “High-pitched\" is a term for the top two notes of the scale (Abh. Voi. 2, p. 398, line 8 of commentary). “Rising” (dipana) and “falling” (praâamana) are types of concatenation (BhNÉ 17.130). What is meant by the last two terms refers probably to volume rather than pitch. How these varieties of tone are to be distributed among the words of the stanza, one will have to imagine as best one can, for Abhinava is silent on the matter. 5. The process as envisaged by Abhinava is this. The context of the sentence (its being spoken by Bhima, who hates the Dhärtarästras) suggests to us that the literal sense of the sentence is something impossible. The tone (with its particular varieties, pitch, and concatenations) strengthens this suggestion and so transforms the literal sense of the words “They will be safe, the Dhärtarästras, while I am alive,\" which is already embellished by the suggestion that this is something wrong or impossible, into the emotion anger. As anger (krodha) is the basic emotion (sthäyibhäva) of raudrarasa, the use of käku, although an instance of subordinated suggestion, leads ultimately to the highest poetic goal, rasa. 6. Any sort of käku carries a hint, but none of the commentators tells us what the hint may here be. Possibly the words hint at the angry argument that must have gone before. 7. Sagadgada usually refers to a voice interrupted by sobs. I suppose, though, that it here refers to interruption by laughter. It would then be a type of concatenation (anga).8. One might think rather that the meaning is directly expressed. 9. For viparttalaksanä see IVanslation pp. 64, 85, 190, 580.10. Venisamhära 1.17 (Madras), 1.15 (Poona). 11. One would expect darse to mean on the day of the first seeing (from drs, to see) of the moon. The common opinion of the érautasütras, however, is that one should perform the darsa sacrifice on the day of the dark of the moon (amävasyäm). Accord­ingly; various improbable explanations were found for taking darse to mean amävasyäm. The present explanation, that darsa means its opposite, viz., the day on which the moon is not seen, is used by Ksïrasvâmin on AK 1.3.8. Dhürtasvämin on Àpastambha érautasütra 1.1 says that the darsa is the day on which the moon is seen by the sages to be in conjunction with the sun. The Matsyapuräna, as quoted by éabdakalpadruma s.v. darsa explains it as the day when the moon and sun see each other. 12. The incidental matter[ § 3.38 L"},{"pageNumber":636,"pageContent":"621is the interpretation of the Vedic darse yajeta. The distinction of kâkvà gunt- bhûtavyangya from vipantalaksanä is pertinent and important.§ 3.39 A ]K And the sensitive reader should not assign the name of dhvani to that area which can reasonably be perceived as belonging to this [subordinated] variety [of suggestion].A For the paths of dhvani and of subordinated suggestion are sometimes found merged in a poem. That one of the two which has the benefit of reason should give its designation to the poem. One should not be unduly partial to dhvani in all cases. For example:“With this, touch the moon in your husband’s crest,” was the laughing benediction spoken by her friend after lacquering her foot; to which Pârvatï said not a word but struck the girl with her garland. 1(ffumSam. 7.19]Or again:Her lover, reaching her high flowers from a branch had called her by another woman’s name.The lady stood, her eyes suffused with tears, saying nothing, scratching with her foot the earth.2[Kiràtârfunïya 8.14]In both stanzas, as the phrases “without a word” and “saying noth­ing\" appear by their negatives to denote to some extent the suggestion [furnished by the remainder of the stanza], it seems best to take the suggestion as subordinated. It is when the suggested meaning appears as the sentence meaning without any indirect statement [to the same effect]3 that we can speak of that [meaning] as predominant, as in “While the heavenly visitor was speaking.” 4 But here there is a lit­eral statement, at least in an indirect way (bhahgyä), so the literal statement also is important (literally, “predominant”). Accordingly, we should not designate these stanzas as dhvani of the type where the [literal sense is subordinated to a] suggestion [which] resembles a reverberation.5"},{"pageNumber":637,"pageContent":"6221.

The crescent of the moon is borne on Siva’s head. By praying that she conquer it, the suggestion is that she will overcome her fellow wives.2W ith o u t a word [she struck th e girl]: Although this [action] suggests such things as shyness, bashful concealment of emotion, joy, anger, fear, pride of beauty, still these suggestions act only to supple­ment the meaning directly expressed by “without a word,” namely the lack, appropriate to maidens, of a ready reply. It is the [direct] mean­ing as supplemented by these suggestions that goes toward forming the srngärarasa.H er lover, etc.: By high flowers the poet means those which the lady could not reach herself and so had asked him to pick. But my teacher3 has said that ticcaih [does not go with the word kusumdni, •flowers,” but] means “in a high or loud voice.” Her lover had said, -These are beautiful flowers, so-and-so, take them, take them,” and calling thus in a high voice had presented them to her with a great"},{"pageNumber":638,"pageContent":"show of honor. And that is why the poet says that she was lambhitä, made to receive or suffer [the other woman’s name].Saying nothing: The suggestion [of the stanza] that it would not be proper for the lady to show her hurt pride at his remembering another beloved on such an amorous occasion and that this [reticence] adds to her burden of grief, simply beautifies the direct statement which negates her speaking. This is what our author will say in here th ere is a literal statem en t, at least in an indirect way.O f th at: he means, of that suggested meaning. B u t here: he means, in the verse “With this, touch the moon,” etc. The word also should be taken as out of order, [i.e., it goes with “predominant” rather than with “statement”]. He means that the direct statement is predom­inant in and by itself, while remaining subordinate with respect to the rasa, etc., which is developed. That is why he specifies, in the last sentence of his comment, that the dhvani from which it differs is a resemblance to reverberation.41. That is, if he judges the direct statement to furnish a greater beauty, he will designate the passage as subordinated suggestion; if the suggestion strikes him as more beautiful, he will call it dhvani. 2. This is a more tasteful interpretation, and I think more in accord with Kalidasa’s intent, than that of Mallinätha, who sees in the benediction only a reference to the sexual gymnastics soon to be practised by the newlyweds. 3. The reference is probably to Bhattenduràja, but could be to Bhattatauta. This is the only passage in the Locand where Abhinava seems to favor an interpretation that we are told is different from that of his teacher. The teacher’s interpretation hero seems to me ridiculous, but it was followed by Mallinätha. 4. It is doubtful if such was Änanda's intention. He probably meant no more than that in cases like these the literal statement is as important as the suggestions, and that it is therefore to our aesthetic judgment to decide which is the more beautiful; on that basis we are to apply the designation dhvani or gvnïbhûta- vyangya. The only reason he specifies anurananarüpavyangya is that that is the type of dhvani to which one would assign the stanzas if one regarded the suggestion as predominant. They would then be placed in the same category with the stanza, “While the heavenly visitor was speaking” (2.22 >1). But by taking the word prädhänyam literally and shifting the position of api Abhi­nava allows the two stanzas quoted in this section to qualify more logically as rasadhvani (see the next Kdrikd), for although the literal meaning is predom­inant over the suggested, it is subordinate to an immediate (asamlaksyakrama as opposed to anurananarüpavyangya) realization of érngdmrasa.§ 3.39 L ] 623"},{"pageNumber":639,"pageContent":"624[ § 3.40 KK This type of poetry also, where the suggestion is subordinated, may take on the nature of dhvani when regarded from the viewpoint of its final meaning, if that meaning is a rasa, etc.A Even the type of poetry where the suggestion is subordinated may again turn into dhvani when regarded from the viewpoint of rasa, or bhäva, etc., furnished by the sentence meaning. Such is the case in the two stanzas just quoted, as also in:“Rädhä is hard to please, most favored sir,since her tears have been falling even as you dry themwith that skirt from your beloved’s loins.Women are hard-hearted, and so enough: leave off your blandishments.” May Hari, so reproved in his solicitations, bring you wellfare. 1Such being the case, one may say of the words in the stanza “It is already a humiliation” (cf. 3.16 A) that although they furnish a literal sense qualified by [subordinated] suggestions, they are suggestive [just like dhvani] with respect to the rasa that forms the ultimate meaning of their sentence. One should not mistake them for furnishing that type of dhvani where the literal meaning is shifted to some other sense,2 be­cause the words here preserve their literal sense. In them we apprehend a denoted meaning as qualified by suggested meanings, not as altered into a suggested meaning. Accordingly, the sentence as a whole is an instance of dhvani; the words are instances of subordinated suggestion. And it is not only words containing subordinated suggestion that may reveal alaksyakramavyangyadhvani (that type of dhvani where the pas­sage to the suggested sense is imperceptible). Words instancing a type of dhvani where the literal meaning is shifted to another sense may like­wise reveal it.3 For example, in that same stanza the word Rävana is of this other type and is similarly revelatory. But where the final mean­ing of the sentence is not a rasa, although the individual words may"},{"pageNumber":640,"pageContent":"suggest it, one can only say that subordinated suggestion is a property of the group of words.4 Examples are such verses as the following:They serve even kings,they enjoy even sense-obiand they love women:men must indeed be clever creatures!*One should devote great care to distinguishing the predominant and the subordinate among the literal and suggested meanings in order to recognize clearly the true areas of dhvani, subordinated suggestion, and the figures of speech. Otherwise, one will fall into confusion over the areas of even well-known figures of speech. For instance, take the following stanza:He reckoned not expense of beauty’s substance nor the infinite pains that he employed; nor did he stick at firing the hearts of men who heretofore had dwelt without constraint.And yet, poor lady, she’s undone from lack of lover matched in quality.What purpose had the Creator in making the body of this slender maid?[Dharmaklrti]®There is a commentator who has interpreted this stanza as contain­ing the figure trick praise,7 but this is not sound, for it does not fit well to have what is said here end up as no more than a figure of speech. In the first place these cannot be the words of a lover, for the words, “poor lady, she’s undone from lack of lover matched in quality” would be im­possible for such a speaker. Next, they cannot be spoken by an ascetic, for his whole way of life would be opposed to such notions. Further­more, the stanza is not reported to come from any larger work, by which we might imagine a meaning pertinent to its context. Accordingly, it must be an allegory (aprastutapraéamsà),3 for by the subordination of the literal sense there appears [the suggestion]9 of a lament by a man puffed up with pride in his u n c o m m o n talents, on seeing that others fail to recognize his qualities because he has fired their jealousy by the degree of his brilliance. What is more, the verse is commonly ascribed to Dharmaklrti and this is just as one might expect, for in this other stanza he reveals the same intention.§ 3.40 A ] 625"},{"pageNumber":641,"pageContent":"[ § 3.40 AMy philosophy, into which the brightest minds have not trusted themselves to plunge, of which the ultimate truth has not been s by their greatest effort, has failed to find i a philosopher worthy of its challenge: it will grow old within myself like the unplumbed waters of the sea within the sea.(Dharmaklrti]101. Hari (Krishna) has returned from some other amour to find his Räd- hä weeping. He tries to appease her, wiping away her tears with his skirt, without realizing that on arising from his recent bout of love he had donned the skirt of the girl with whom he had been lying. In a culture where men and women wore skirts of similar cut, such confusions did not seem improb­able. They figure not seldom in Sanskrit erotic poetry; see SRK 847 and SubhÀ. 1441, 1442, 1443. The stanza here is in the form of a benediction, to which a rasa (rasavadaiaiikära) is subordinate, as in “The women of the TViple City.” Änanda and Abhinava are not concerned, however, about the relation between the rasavadaiaiikära and the ultimate meaning of the verse (viz., a vastndhvani of the loveableness of Krishna and thence the rasa of the poet’s love of God). They are concerned rather with the relation of the suggestions of the individual words to the rasa of the rasavadaiaiikära. This rasa is the flavor of love-in-separation, where the separation is caused by jeal­ousy (irsyävipralambhasrngära). It is primarily suggested by the literal sense of Râdhâ’s words taken as a whole, but is helped out by the subordinated suggestions of the individual words. These subordinated suggestions are enu­merated by Abhinava in his comment. Änanda will point out that the relation between these two sorts of suggestion, i.e., between the gunîbhütavyangya of the individual words and the rasadhvani of the sentence, is the same as in the stanza “It is already a humiliation” (3.16 A). 2. That is to say, the stanzadoes not exemplify the arthäntarasamkramitaväcya variety of avivaksitaväcya- dhvani, for which see 2.1. 3. The sentence is awkward in Sanskrit becauseof the repetition vyangya vyangya vyanjakäni, and more awkwardstill in English. What Änanda means is this. Not only words containing a subordinate suggestion, such as me yad arayah, taträpy osait täpasah, etc., but also words containing dhvani. such as “Rävana” (for “Rävana” here is an instance of arthäntarasaiikramitaväcya, which has been categorized as a- type of dhvani), are capable of embellishing the literal sense and so leading ultimately to rasadhvani. 4. In such cases the subordinated suggestions do not qualify or embellish the literal meaning so that it may lead on to rasa.5. The suggestions are that it is impossible to do these things without re­ceiving the opposite of what one seeks. Accordingly, Abhinava claims that"},{"pageNumber":642,"pageContent":"627one apprehends from the stanza nirveda, indifference to worldly things which is the basic emotion of the rasa of peace. But the chief charm (camatkdra) of the stanza lies not in the rasa but in the neat presentation of the literal meaning. We have not been able to trace the source of the stanza. In the second päda the reading of the Kashi text (visamam apy upayunjate) makes nonsense. Visam apy upabhunjate, found in one NS MS, is not much better.J. M. has suggested the emendation which we here translate: visayam api bhunjate. It is clear that Abhinava read two occurrences of api in the stanza.6. Änanda (see below) believed the stanza to be by Dharmaklrti. It is ascribed to Dharmaklrti by the anthologies: SRK 454, SubhÄ. 1472, SvbhM. 50.9, and by Ksemendra, Aacityavicäracarcä 11. In most of the quotations the stanza is regarded as simply referring to a young woman. Such was clearly Ksemendra's opinion, while the anthologies always place the stanza under the category of women or young women. Änanda and Abhinava, and much later Appayya Diksita (Kuvalayänanda 72) take it as an allegory. Their arguments in favor of allegory are set forth in what follows. 7. That is to say, by appearing to censure the lady through censure of her creator, one is made aware of the extraordinary beauty of which she is possessed. 8. For trick praise (vyäja- stuti) a knowledge of the context is indispensible. But for aprastutaprasamsd, when it is used in an isolated stanza (a muktaka), a knowledge of the context is not necessary, as, in fact, there is no context in the case of such stanzas.9. “For by the subordination of the literal sense there appears a suggestion” (väcyena gunibhûtàtmanâ). This phrase explains the pertinence of Änandas exemplar stanza, which has been questioned. It was quoted to illustrate the importance of distinguishing which is predominant and which subordinate among the literal and suggested meanings, so that one will not confuse the areas even of well known figures of speech. Now in aprastutaprasamsd of the fifth type (where like suggests like, i.e., allegory) Änanda has said (1.13 j A) that we may have either dhvani (where the literal is subordinate) or a mere figure of speech (where the literal is predominant). In the exemplar stanza the literal is subordinate, so we have a case of dhvani. On the other hand, in trick praise Abhinava has said (1.13 k L, which doubtless reflects correctly Änanda’s view) that the literal meaning is merely embellished by (i.e., not subordinate to) the suggestion. Thus it is a mere figure of speech. So if we take the view of Änanda’s opponent, the examplar stanza will be merely a figure of speech, while if we take Änanda’s view, it will constitute dhvani. This distinction is not made by Mammata, according to whose categories both trick praise and allegory are instances of the type of suggestion which he calls vdcyasiddhyangavyangya (Mammata 5.126-127, a suggestion which is necessary in order to make sense of the literal). If one follows Mammata's categories, one will suppose that Änanda has chosen an impertinent example.10. Quoted in K.Anu., Viveka 553. Other laments of Dharmaklrti on the lack of understanding shown for his works will be found in SRK 1726. 1729.§ 3.40 A ]"},{"pageNumber":643,"pageContent":"[ § 3.40 LL Carrying this line of argument to its conclusion, he brings into full light the doctrine that dhvani is the soul of poetry: This ty p e of poetry, etc.The two stanzas: he means in the two stanzas of similar color, “With this, touch the moon,” etc., and [“Her lover, reaching,” etc.]. By the word “two” he excludes the stanza “While the heavenly visitor was speaking.”R ädhä is hard to please: Rädhä had become angry without rea­son. Her lover had fallen at her feet and said to her, “You will not for­give me. Ah, you are hard to please. Do not weep.” And now he wipes away her tears. This is her speech, admitting that she is unappeasable. M uch favored sir: this suggests “since your other sweetheart cannot part with you for a moment without leaving you with some ornament from your intercourse.” W ith th a t skirt: she means, “Just look at it, that skirt, which you so prize that without any shame you are wearing it.” As you dried them : from this we see that the tears are falling in a thousand streams. And your heart is so far gone that you forget me and are thinking of her, that she is angry. Otherwise you would not act as you are acting. Have been falling: the sense is that the time for my weeping is now past. And if you ask why I do not give up my anger with your showing me so much honor, the answer is that w om en’s hearts are hard. The word “women” here refers to the mere object without any connection with love; and such is its nature. As applied to herself, the words suggest that the phrase “young women are ten­derhearted” is nonsense. Their heart must be harder than a diamond if it doesn’t break into a thousand pieces at a discovery of this sort. B landishm ents: which you use only out of politeness. Solicitations: the plural suggests that this lover of many women must assume this posture time and again, that he is extremely well favored in love.Such in essence are the suggestions which ornament [and so are sub­ordinated to] the denoted sense of the words. But the denoted sense so ornamented becomes itself a component of [and so subordinated to] the true rasa of love in separation in its variety of jealousy.As for a commentator who has explained that in these three stan­zas the suggested senses [of the individual words] are a component of rasa, he has sold the image of the god to get enough money for its festival; because at this rate the subordination of suggestion [to the literal sense], which is the matter under discussion, would be wholly"},{"pageNumber":644,"pageContent":"629destroyed. For in the case of a suggested meaning other than a rasa, etc., [i.e., in the cases of vastudhvani and alankäradhvani], the sugges­tion’s being a component of rasa, just that and nothing else, makes it predominant [over the literal meaning]. But enough of arguing with an older member of my family.1Such being th e case: the sense is, since a difference has been established between dhvani and subordinated suggestion in the manner just stated. Then, to explain the word “also” in the Kärikä, our author says, A nd it is not only, etc. The stanza (to which he is referring, namely, “It is already a humiliation,” etc.] has been quoted before, so he does not here write it out in full.B ut w here, etc.: although we apprehend here [viz., in the stanza, “They serve even kings,” etc.] the rasa of peace, which is identifiable with a disinterest in worldly things, the charm of the stanza lies in the literal sense. The suggestions, namely that the actions [expressed in the stanza] are impossible or bring about the opposite [of what one intends], merely follow along with the literal.2 They are already touched upon [i.e., prematurely revealed] by the two words “even,” of which each is to be doubly construed,3 by the word “and,” which construes with three clauses,4 by the word “indeed,” which is doubly construed [with “clever” and with “men\"], and by the word “men.” 5 And so these suggestions are subordinated. Our author shows that a consideration of this distinction .[between dhvani and subordinated suggestion] is not without use: One should devote g reat care, etc.A nd th e figures of speech: Where there is no suggested element at all, the predominance is of pure figures of speech. O therw ise: that is, if one does not make an effort. The force of the word even is this, that all the more surely is there ground for confusion in the type of suggestion to which he has just referred.By the word substance is suggested that it was his most precious wealth, which had been useful to him in many creations.6 H e reckoned not: on the other hand, one who spends his wealth slowly and not in a flash like lightning does of necessity reckon it. But the Creator, although he had been at work for endless years, used no consideration at all. Thus God showed no forethought.—And so the poet speaks of infinite pains. Who had dw elt w ithout constraint: that is, unchained [by desire]. A nd yet, she: the words “and yet\" (api and eva) suggest that it is a great crime to destroy the very thing one has created. W h at purpose: the sense is none, for himself, for the world, and for what he had created.§ 3.40 L ]"},{"pageNumber":645,"pageContent":"630For such a speaker: For a lover the expressions “poor lady” and “she’s undone” would be unseemly, the first because it would contain disparagement, the second because it would be inauspicious; while the words from lack of lover m atched in quality would cast unseemly aspersion upon himself. If he could not find the possibility of that role in himself, he would be no better than an animal to keep on loving her.To this argument, however, there are possible objections. Why should these not be the words of a lover who has for some reason undertaken a vow of abstinence for some time, or who might be like Rävana with re­spect to Sita, or who might be like Dusyanta with respect to Sakuntalä before he knew to what caste she belonged; in which case the words could admit of a pride in his own qualifications as a lover and of his praise of the lady. Neither are the words impossible for an ascetic, who might see the lady, although with impartiality, as she really is through the influence of his memory of passion experienced from the endless span of his former births. After all, he who has put aside passion does not see things topsy turvy. The notes of a lyre do not sound to him like the cawing of a crow. Accordingly, if the stanza is taken to be about the subject which it states, the words would be possible for ei­ther [lover or ascetic]. If you take it as an allegory, you must show that the unintended subject [the matter actually stated] is something pos­sible [of the intended matter]. For one cannot have an allegory about light that says, “Ah, curses on you for your blackness.” As the allegory ( aprastutaprasamsâ) is dependent on the stated matter, there must be nothing in that matter which is impossible [in the allegory]7With these objections in mind our author states: F urtherm ore, th e stanza is not, etc. By the four sentence-elements nihsämänya (uncommon), nijamahimä (his brilliance), visesajnam [na pasyatah\\ ([seeing that others fail] to recognize his qualities), and paridevitam (a lament), our author explains the [suggested] meaning of each succes­sive line in the stanza.8 But what proof is there of this interpretation? Our author proceeds to answer the question: W h at is m ore, etc. But the objector may say, what if the stanza is [commonly ascribed to DharmakTrti]? With this in mind, our author shows how the meaning furnished by a verse indubitably written by Dharmakïrti agrees with the meaning of this stanza: and this is ju st as one m ight suspect.In which they have not tru sted them selves to plunge: how much less have they really acquired it!

The literal sense so far (in the two stanzas just adduced] shows two figures of speech, allegory (in the stanza “He reckoned not expence,” etc.] and si ile (in the stanza “My philosophy,” etc.]. But [in the case of the prior stanza], immediately after [apprehending the figure of speech], one becomes filled with amazement at the speaker himself, and so the aesthetic sense [of the reader] comes to rest in the rasa of wonder. Of the second stanza one should judge thus: that its point of rest is the rasa of heroism, for it touches on a moral hero (dharmamra) by its showing the benevolence of the speaker when one thinks that such [a philosophy], which is of great benefit by its producing heroic energy in the hearer because of its awesome reputation and the fact that it can be understood only with difficulty, has been made to favor a few select persons. 11 Otherwise, what would a mere lament amount to? If you claim that he is informing us that he acted without thinking of the consequences, what would that prove, as such a lament could be of no use either to himself or to others? So enough of the matter. 1 2 * 41. What Abhinava objects to in his older relative’s interpretation of the stanza is that the Candrikä, the commentary written by this older relative, made the individual word meanings directly subordinate to the raso, instead of çürectly subordinate to the sentence meaning which furnishes the raso.2. Compare 1.13 k A (Summary Verses 1 and 2). 3. Abhinava would inter­pret the literal sense as: “They even go into service and they even serve kings; they even enjoy and they enjoy even sense-obj ts.” This sense by itself goes a good way toward expressing the difficulty or impossibility of what men do.4. The literal sense by its accumulation of three activities shows the difficulty of what men do. 5. That men (the word denotes a being who is not super­human) should do these difficult or impossible things implies in itself without any need for suggestion that they will not attain their object. 6. That is to say, the Creator had been drawing on his stock frugally whenever he wished to make a beautiful creature. 7. Thus, “Curses on your blackness-’ could serve as the aprastutärtha only in an allegory where the prastutärtha was some such object as a villain, a false doctine, etc. 8. Each successive line is given by a couplet of lines in the English translation. 9. Abhinava is continuing the suggestion thrown out by plunging or diving.

Abhinava sees a play on words in pratigrâhaka, thus concluding the oceanic suggestions with which the stanza begins. The three creatures named were respectively the elephant, horse, and physician, among the precious ob­jects churned up from the sea by the gods. 11. Abhinava has two reasons in mind for assigning the final effect of the stanza \"My philosophy,” etc., to vîrarasa. (1) The stanza shows Dharmaklrti to have been a dharmavira in composing a work so beneficial to others. (2) His philosophy rouses heroic en­ergy ( utsäha, which is the sthäyibhäva of viramsa) in its hearers. The syntax by which he joins the two reasons is awkward.[ § 3.40 LA And there are three ways of writing an aprastutaprasamsä (here = allegory). Sometimes the literal sense is intended by the speaker, sometimes not intended, 1 sometimes partly intended and part­ly unintended. Of these an example where the literal is intended is this:It suffers pressure for others’ sake; is sweet when broken; even in altered state it is prized by all.What if it fails to grow if cast on barren land:is this the fault of the sugar cane or of the hostile desert?[Bhallata-sataka 56]3Another is my own verse:These things which seem so beautiful achieve their purpose surely by becoming objects, if but for one brief moment, of the eye: that eye, which in a world devoid of light has now become the equal, or less, alas, than equal, of the body's other parts.3In these two stanzas the sugar cane and the eye, although intended in the literal sense,4 are not the subjects that the poet has in mind.

The stanza was quoted under 1.14 A, which see together with note 6 thereon. 3. This stanza also is in Bhallata. as number 6 8. As remarked above (1.14 A, note 6), the Bhallatasataka is an anthology drawn from many authors. The allegory is this. A great poet, like a man’s eye, can reveal the beauty of the world. But if he lacks a patron, or an audience, his activity is of no more use, in fact of even less use, than that of any other man. 4. Since what is said of them is inherently possible. 5.

The construction [of what fol­lows ] is: that eye, of which these things, having become for a moment the object, attain their purpose. Devoid of light: devoid of discrim­ination. Less than equal: for the hand is still useful for touching or taking things. O th er parts: he means even those which are most useless. The compound apräptaparabkägasya is to be analysed as: of a man by whom high, that is, outstanding, reward—in the form of receiving wealth or of becoming famous—has not been received.I will say it, etc.: this is the reply. The suggestion is this: that I really should not tell you, for it will distress you to hear it; but if you insist, I will say it. As if disgusted: the disgust is suggested by the tone of voice and by the words “brought to misery by fate.” Y ou’ve guessed aright: this is the second reply. W hy: the question is as to the cause of disgust. [Why do you] speak thus: [the suggestion is that] the answers began with a painful recollection and that what was stated was stated with difficulty. On th e left: the sense is that it is charaterized by such faults as inferior birth. B anyan: a tree which is proud simply because of its shade, although it is devoid of fruit or flower. Even shade: because the säkhotaka thorn-tree [as it grows in burning-grounds] has its branches and leaves scorched by the funeral fires.Our author states the reason why the literal sense is not intended here: as questions and answers are im possible.An evil m an (asatpurusa) who is rich: If one takes the reading satpurusa,2 one will have to understand the meaning to be a man who is good so far as mere wealth goes but not good in virtue.Is not entirely: We cannot say that there is no basis for the exis­tence of the literal sense, because the suggested sense [which is just as improbable] does exist.3 Thus, where it is said that the tree “grows in"},{"pageNumber":650,"pageContent":"635an out of the way spot,” [it is suggested that] the woman is not born of a good family. That it is ugly [suggests that] she lacks charm. It is said that the tree lacks fruit, flowers, and leaves. This suggests that even a woman of this sort [i.e., low-born and ugly] might be protected if she had sons, or if, through her brothers, etc., she had a group of relatives to care for her. O peasant, by putting a fence around this badavi you will be laughed at by everyone; this is the sense.Having thus described the figure of allegory (aprastutapraéamsâ) since the occasion presented itself [in. connection with the verse \"He reckoned not expense,” etc.], he now sums up the matter that was at issue: A ccordingly. The sense is: because we see that people are confused in regard to the figure of allegory in the stanza “He reckoned not expense,” etc.1. The pratika seems to be wrongly given. One wants \"ami ye drsyanta iti” in place of “nanv iti.\" 2. Of the recorded manuscripts none has this reading. 3. I am uncertain of the translation of this sentence. The double nâsti in our text is surely a printer’s error of dittography. KM. reads väcya eva niyamo nästiti; the Vidyabhavan edition reads vâcyabhâvaniyamo nästiti.J. Masson would emend to vâcyabhâvaniyamo ’sti nästiti. Patwardhan would omit the whole phrase, as it is absent in Hemacandra (see above, 3.40 a A, note 6). If we keep it, as I (D.I.) have done, there is a question of what Abbinava can mean. In all cases of aprastutaprasamsà there is a suggested meaning. In itself this does not rule out the literal meaning as being intended also. It seems to me, therefore, that he should mean that the literal meaning is improbable, but no more improbable than the suggested meaning. That is why the verse is not “wholly possible or impossible.” It may be that some lines'have dropped out of the text, as there is no other Prakrit verse in the book where Abhinava fails to give a chäyä.§ 3.41-42 K ]K By reference to the predominance or subordination of the sug­gested meaning the two types of poetry have thus been assigned their places. What is other than these is called cifro (display).1 Cifra is assigned to two types depending on word and meaning. Of it one type is verbal cifro; the other is semantic cifro."},{"pageNumber":651,"pageContent":"1.13 a A, note 2 and the Vrtti on the present stanza, especially[ § 3.41-42 KA Where the suggested meaning is predominant we have the type of poetry called dhvani\\ where it is subordinate, we have guni- bhûtavyangya (the poetry of subordinated suggestion). That which is different from these, namely poetry which lacks rasa or an emotion (bhäva) as its final meaning, which lacks the power to reveal any partic­ular suggested meaning, which is composed only by relying on novelties of literal sense and expression, and which gives the appearance of a pic­ture, is citra. It is not real poetry [just as a picture is not the real thing], for it is an imitation of poetry. One type of this citra is verbal citra, such as difficult arrangements,1 yam akas (echo alliterations),2 and the like. Semantic citra differs from verbal citra and may be exemplified by poetic fancy (utpreksä) and such figures, when they carry no suggested sense and lack any final meaning of rasa, etc. because of predominance of the literal meaning.But what is this thing called citra, where there is no touch of a suggested meaning? For suggested meaning has already been shown to be of three sorts. Now we may let the word citra apply to that case where there is no suggestion of a thing (or situation) or of a figure of speech. But where there is no reference to the rasas, etc., there cannot be any type of poetry at all. Because poetry cannot be about nothing; and everything in the world necessarily becomes a constituent of a rasa or a bhäva, if only by its ultimately being a determinant (vi- bhäva) thereof. This is because the rasas are particular states of mind and there is nothing that does not produce some state of mind. If there were, it would not be in the area of poetry. And here you have described a certain area of poetry as being citra.1. See 2.15 L, note 1. It is doubtless from these difficult pictorial arrange­ments ( citrabandha) rather than from the factitious nature of pictures that the term citra actually originated. Stanzas were arranged in the shape of swords, drums, wheels, etc. Examples may be found in Änandavardhana’s Deviéataka, in Kir&târjunïya, canto 15, and in Mägha’s canto 19. Similar tricks may be found in Greek in the Anthologie Palatina, Book 15, where they are known as technopaignia. What characterizes the citrabandha is an interlocking of the syllables which outline the various parts of the object represented. It is there­fore difficult to compose. English pictorial verses, sometimes called topiary verses, usually depend for their effect on typographical arrangement.

To treat of this subject we are given two Kârikâs: By reference to th e predom inance, etc.Verbal citra: this is well known as containing such pictorial effects as yamaka, cakrabandha,1 etc. Semantic citra may be conceived as similar [in lack of suggestion, etc.].

It is true that there is no species of poetry where there is no apprehension of the rasas, etc. When, however, a poet, having no intention of revealing by his words a rasa, or bhäva, etc., composes mere figures of sound and sense, we may regard his composition from the viewpoint of his intention as be­ing without rasa, etc. For the meaning of the words in a poem is greatly strengthened by the author’s intention. By force of the inher­ent capability of the literal sense there may be an apprehension of rasa, even though the author had no intention of revealing it; but that ap­prehension will be very weak. In this way too we may regard such a composition as without rosa1 and so assign it to the area of citra.The matter is stated as follows:That is the area of citra where the author’s intent is not to write on the subject of rasas or bhävas, etc., but to compose figures of speech.But when the intention of the author, as the final sense of his compo­sition, is the rasas, etc., one may say that there is no poetry that is not in the sphere of dhvani.'2We have set up this citra from our observing the way in which some poets of unconstrained speech have gone about the writing of poetry without regard to making the rasas, etc., their final meaning. But for modern poets, now that correct guide rules are being established, there is no sort of poetry other than dhvani. For the performance of mature poets has no beauty unless its final goal is the rasas, etc. When the rasas, etc., are the final goal, there is nothing that can be brought into connection with the intended rasa which does not gain in beauty thereby. There is even no insentient thing which cannot, either through its forming, as each case may require, some contextual factor (vibhâva), or by one’s ascribing to it a sentient activity, be brought into connection with a rasa.

One of the meanings listed for the negative in Sanskrit is “very little.\" The meanings are fisted in the following verse: sädrsyam tadabhävas ca tad- anyatvam tadalpatâ / aprasastyam virodhas ca nanarthdh sat prakâsitâh / / The Mahäbhäsya on 1.4.24, Värt. 3 (Kielhorn 1.327.20) gives as examples of the negative used in the sense of very little alomikaidikà (a goat with no hair, that is with very little hair), anudarä kanyä (a young girl with no belly, that is with a slender belly). See also Mallinätha on KumSam. 4.33. 2. Abhi-nava attributes these two verses to the author of the Vrtti. 3. These verses too are doubtless by Änanda. Abhinava quotes the second stanza in ABh Voi. 1, p. 294, specifically attributing it to Änandavardhana. The first two stanzas are quoted, without attribution, by Agnipurâna 339.10-11; see Kane HSP pp. 7-8 and Raghavan, Bhoja's ÉP, pp. 479-80.L W hen, however: he means, when an author does not apply the sort of circumspection in introducing figures of speech that was spo­ken of in the verse: “The intention must be to keep them subordinate and never acting as the chief element,” etc. (2.18 K).As being w ith o u t rasa: he means, that one will find no taste (rasa) in it, as in a meat dish concocted by a cook ignorant of the culinary art. Here it might be objected that from the beauty of the thing itself there must be some relish of it, just as there is of a si- kharini,1 even if prepared by one without skill. With this in mind, our author says, By force of th e inherent capability of the literal sense, etc.In th is way too: Previously he had been speaking of a complete lack; now he is speaking of a weakness of rasa.

[To com pose figures of speech:] he means, to compose figures of sound and figures of sense.But, an objector may ask, what was the point in specifying that “what [is other than that] is called citra\" (3.41 K), since you have already said that it is not poetry at all? If you claim to have pointed it out as someting to be avoided, you should also state that by making pots one does not become a poet.2 With such an objection in mind, our author explains that poets have indeed written this [type of literature] and on this account he points it out as something to be avoided. Thus, W e have set up this term , etc.M atu re poets: that is, poets whose maturity is shown by their choice of words and meanings appropriate to [the intended] rasa. Even the definition [of maturity by Vämana], “when the words of the poem [being perfect] can no longer be changed,\" 3 must be said to be aiming at appropriateness of words to the rasa, for otherwise it would have no point.Endless [worlds]: that is, without beginning or end. He then ex­plains how the universe revolves at the poet’s wish: If th e p o et w rites of love, etc. A poet writing of love is one who takes delight in rel­ishing the vibhävas, anubhävas, and vyabhicäribhävas which have been ascribed to srngärarasa, not a man who is addicted to women. This is why the sage Bharata uses the word “poet” [and “poetry”] as primary [examples of the locus of the bhävas and rasas], when he says [that the bhävas transmit] “the state of mind (bhäva) which is in the poet,” 4 or that the bhävas “transmit the matter of poetry,” 3 I have commented on this in my discussion of the nature of the rasas.6T he world assum es: the sense is, because it is plunged in rasa. The word “love” is used as representative of all the rasas. If he becom es: the sense is that as soon as he ceases to be a rasika (one inspired by the rasas), the various bhävas that are seen, although they transmit everyday pleasure, pain, folly, or neutrality, will not form, without the strengthening of a poet’s description, a basis for the transcendent relishing of rasa. 11.

That is, in order to be consistent you should list all the things that are not poetry. Why single out just one, namely citra? 3. The quotation is from a verse first found in Vämana’s Vrtti on his Kävyälankärasütra 1.3.15. Rajasekhara at­tributes it to “the followers of Vämana” ( Vämaniyäh ... ähuh, KävMtm. 5.20 = page 20, fines 9-10), which seems to show that he regarded the Vrtti as not by Vämana himself. Gopendra Bhüpâla, the 15th-century commenta­tor on Vämana, attributes the verse, wrongly, to Bhämaha. 4. BhNÉ 7.2. Abhinava has adduced the passage before, on 1.6. What he would here point out is that the bhävas are located primarily in the sensitive poet, not in the common man. 5. BhNÉ Intr. to 7.1. Here again, the matter on which the bhävas (and rusas) are based is said to be the possession of a poet, not of an ordinary person. 6. The reference could be to Abhinava’s comment on 1.4 a (see Translation p. 81), or to his comment on 1.18 (see Translation p. 192). It is unlikely that he is here referring to his great discussion of the rasas in ABh 6.31, which seems to have been written later than the Locana and which contains no passage notably pertinent to the point he is making here.§ 3.41-42 b A ]A Accordingly, if a poet is wholeheartedly intent on a rusa, there is nothing whatsoever which he cannot, if he wishes, form into an inte­gral part of that rasa, or which, being so integrated, will not increase in beauty. All this is seen in the poetry of great poets. Even in ray own works it can be seen as occasion arises. This being the case, no type of poetry falls outside the nature of dhvani. As has been said above, even that type of poetry which is characterized by subordinated suggestion, if the poet has regard to [its ultimate goal of] rasa, etc., forms part of this (general category of dhvani]. But even where the rasa, etc., as­sume a subordinate position, as in clever verses or prayers to the gods, etc.; also where the literal sense as qualified by some suggestion is the predominant element, as it is in hrdayavatï verses1 written by clever authors2 in gäthä meter; in these cases also we must see subordinated suggestion as a derivative of dhvani.3 This we have already said. So now that instruction is being offered to modern poets in the true princi­ples of poetry, while citra may be much used in the efforts of beginners"},{"pageNumber":657,"pageContent":"642who are seeking practice, it is established for mature poets that dhvani alone is poetry. The following verses sum up the matter.Where a rasa or a bhäva or the like appears as the final meaning, where a fact or figure of speech is suggested in a hidden way: along that road of poetry, the sensitive critic will recognize that dhvani has its realm, being simply the ultimate predominance of the suggested sense.[ § 3.41-42 b A1.

One should read dhvaninisyanda as in 3.36 b A(Text p. 474, line 2), rather than dhvaninispanda.L The construction here is: “there is nothing which will not increase in beauty.” In my own works: such as the Visamabäna- lîlà.1 In h r d a y a v a tï verses: that is, in verses called hiäliä,2 which teach us cleverly the means to the ends of man3 and which are well known in gatherings of Prakrit poets. C lever authors:4 authors of literary sensitivity are so called. Their verses are like the following by Bhattendudräja:When she blessed the farmer, saying “May your phalain plants grow higher than the sky,\" his neighbor also was delighted.5In this verse, by a woman’s granting a blessing to a farmer with the words “May your cotton plants grow higher than the sky,” his neighbor was brought to happiness.6 It is the literal sense that is charming, qualified as it is by the suggestion of desire for stolen intercourse.When the many rose-apples ripen in the thickets on the bank of the Godavari, the farmer's wife puts on a dress as purple as rose-apple juice.7In this verse, by its saying that when the many rose-apples ripen in the thickets on the bank of the Godavari the farmer’s wife puts on a dress as purple as rose-apple juice, there is a subordinate suggestion of her hiding any possible spots8 that might come from her dress being"},{"pageNumber":658,"pageContent":"reddened by the juice of the fruit, as might occur from her hasty, stolen intercourse with her lover.9 This should be explanation enough.D hvani alone is poetry: What our author means is that in reality the soul and the body are the same, but for the purpose of analysis one may make a distinction. 10By the use of the [second] word vâ (“or”) our author includes the false or improper rasa and bhäva that were mentioned before (e.g., 2.3 K).

The MSS read aaliyä, which our text has mistakenly cor­rected to hiaalalxä. The word hiâliâ is the Prakrit equivalent of hrdayavatx [ÿôt/iâ], “a stanza which has a heart, i.e., a second meaning, underlying the literal, apparent sense; a riddle, an enigma\" (M. V. Patwardhan, Vajjälagga, notes, p. 550; Section 64 of the Vajjälagga is entitled hiälx-vajjä). 3. The sections of the Vajjälagga are in general divided in subject matter into dharma, artha, and käma, but of the hiälx-vajjä all the gäthäs except one deal with käma. 4. Following the Vrtti, we should read satprajnakäh. See 3.41- 42b A, note 2. 5. I have emended the text on the basis of BP's state­ment of a variant in Abhinava’s explanation. It says: “A variant reading in the Locana is prätivesyiko nirvrtim präpitah. This is better. The Prakrit verse and its translation should be emended accordingly.\" My emendation, then, is: langhiagaanä phalakî-laâu hontu tti vaddhaantxe / haliassa äsisam päliveiiyako vi niwudio / / Hereby the riddle of the verse will be why the neighbor should be delighted by a blessing directed to another man. The answer will be that the woman speaking the blessing is giving a hint that the tall phalakï plants will make a good place for the neighbor and her to make love. If one keeps Abhinava's text as the editions print it, the Prakrit verse will end with pälivesavahuä vi niwudiä, '‘the neighbor’s wife was also delighted.\" But the riddle and its answer are no longer neat. An unspecified woman gives the farmer a blessing and his neighbor’s wife, lusting presumably for the farmer, is delighted. Abhinava glosses phalakï by karpäsa (cotton), but a cotton field, at least such as we have in Virginia, would make a poor place to hide one’s love-making. I take nivudio as ppp. of a denominative from niwuda = mrvrta. 6. The translation follows BP's variant reading. See note 5, above. 7. The jambü (Eugenia jambolana, the Anglo-Indian “rose- apple”) is regularly associated by the poets with the Vindhya hills (see note on SRK, Translation, 157a) and so, as here, with the Godavari River. The Kädambari (p. 37, line 11, to p. 38, line 1) notes that its juice is black-red and§ 3.41-42 b L ] 643"},{"pageNumber":659,"pageContent":"644astringent but sweet (nïlapatalah kasâyamadhvrah jambüphalamsah). In the verse the syllable su is to be connected with pacyamânâ- as its inflection but goes metrically with the second half verse. 8. Parabhäga here means ■'contrast\" (cf. 2.1a L, note 1), and hence contrasting color, spot. 9. BP explains that she would naturally spread her dress on the ground for her lover and herself to lie on.10. Abhinava means that real poetry is inseparable from dhvani (in its largest sense, that is, whether the suggestion is predominant or subordinate), just as body and soul are inseparable. Kärikä 1.1 stated that dhvani is the soul of poetry and Kärikä 1.5 that rasa (to which dhvani leads) is the soul of poetry. Thus, it has analysed dhvani and poetry into distinct entities comparable to soul and body. But as dhvani is invariably associated with real poetry, we can speak metaphorically (upacdrena) of identity between them, as between soul and body. 11. Suggestion of a fact, of a figure of speech, or of a raso, etc.[ § 3.41-42 b LK Dhvani appears by fusion (sahkara) and association (sam- srsti) with its own varieties, as well as with subordinated suggestion and with the figures of speech; and furthermore in many ways.A And many varieties are seen in literature where a fusion or association of this dhvani is made with its own varieties, with sub­ordinated suggestion, or with expressed1 figures of speech. Thus we see:dhvani fused with its own varieties, dhvani associated with its own varieties, dhvani fused with subordinated suggestion, dhvani associated with subordinated suggestion, dhvani fused with one of the expressed figures of speech, dhvani associated with one of the expressed figures of speech, dhvani fused with figures which are themselves associated, dhvani associated with figures which are themselves associated.Thus dhvani appears in many ways.2"},{"pageNumber":660,"pageContent":"645Among these ways, the fusing [of an instance of] dhvani with one of its own varieties is sometimes by a relation of assisted and assist or ' anu- grähänugrähakabhävena), as in the stanza “While the heavenly visitor was speaking,” (see 2.22 A and note 1) for in it we apprehend a variety of dhvani where the passage to the suggested meaning is imperceptible [viz. a rasadhvani], which is assisted by a type of dhvani based on the power of the situation, where the suggested meaning is at a perceived interval and is like the reverberation of a bell.Again, there may be a fusion of two varieties of dhvani by a relation which puts us in doubt [as to which variety prevails] by the falling together of the two (prabhedadvayasampätasandehena); as in:Brother-in-law, your wifehas said something to your holiday guestso that she sits weepingin the loft behind the house.Go-comfort the poor girl.3In this stanza we might take the word “comfort” as shifting the literal sense to another meaning [viz., to “make love to” ],4 or we might take it as intended in its literal meaning but subordinated to a suggested sense [viz., that you really love her and have ceased to love me]5 Nor is there any decisive reason for choosing one interpretation rather then the other.But by a relation of entering into the same suggestive unit it is very common for a suggestion of the type where there is no perceived interval to fuse with some other variety of its own type. An example is the stanza “White herons circle against dark clouds” (see 2.1 a A) . 6 A case of association of dhvani with one of its own varieties is offered by the very same verse. In it there is the association of that type of dhvani where the literal is shifted to another meaning with the type where the literal is entirely set aside. 11. The term “expressed figures of speech\" is used, as Abbinava will point out (3.43 b L), in order to exclude the suggested figures of speech, which are included in dhvani or in subordinated suggestion. 2. Änanda might easily have added two more categories where the figures of speech are themselves fused. But obviously these multiple combinations can be increased at will. Abhinava disregards them. By way of compensation he elaborates very con­siderably on Änanda’s first six categories. 3. Author unknown. The word padohara, or more correctly parohada is probably derived from Sanskrit paro- grha and means back yard (gharavädayam); see Patwardhan, Vajjälagga, note§ 3.43 A j"},{"pageNumber":661,"pageContent":"646on vs. 523. The word occurs in several verses of that work. 4. The sugges­tion would thus belong to the first variety, viz. arthäntarasaTikramitaväcya, of the first type, avivaksitaväcya. 5. The suggestion would then belong to the first variety, viz. alaksyakramavyangya, of the second type, vivaksi- tänyaparaväcya. 6. Here we have a fusion of rasadhvani and bhävadhvani, as Abhinava will explain. Both of them belong to the type alaksyakrama- vyangya. Änanda’s quotation of the stanza in 2.1a A was in order to point out a different sort of suggestion, which he now takes up in the next sentence.[ § 3.43 AL Having stated a summary of the matter by means of the two stanzas [at the end of 3.41-42b A), our author recites the following, which shows the manifold varieties of dhvani: D hvani appears in m any ways. The general meaning of the sentence is that the varieties of dhvani are endless by its fusion and association with its own varieties as well as with subordinated suggestion and with the figures of speech. He demonstrates its manifoldness by T hus, we see, etc.There are three types, as it combines1 with its own varieties, with subordinated suggestion, or with the figures of speech. In each of these types the combination may be by fusion (saiikara) or by association (samsrsti), thus making six types. Then there are three varieties of fu­sion, as the fused elements may stand in a relation of assisted and assis- tor (anugrähyänugrähakabhävena), or may be related in a manner that gives rise to doubt [as to which element prevails] (sandehäspadatvena), or may be ralated by their both entering into the same suggestive unit (ekapadânupravesena).2 Hereby we arrive at twelve types. Further­more, the varieties of subordinated suggestion are to be counted as thirty-five, just as sire the varieties [of dhvani proper] which were listed above (viz., in 2.31 L). The varieties of dhvani proper being thirty-five and the figures of speech being taken as a single unit, gives seventy- one [varieties with which a combination may be made]. Multiplying this figure by the three types of fusion plus the one type of association gives 284. Multiplying the primary types [which enter into combina­tion] by this figure gives 7,420.3 But as the number of figures of speech is endless, the total number of combinations is innumerable.Desiring to give examples of a few of these varieties by way of expla­nation, our author proceeds with four examples of the combination of one variety of dhvani with another, these combinations being the most important, as may be seen by the fact that in the Kärikä the word prabhedaih ( “with its own varieties” ) is the exocentric noun [which the"},{"pageNumber":662,"pageContent":"compounds sagunïbhûtavyangyaih and sälankämih modify]: A m ong these ways.W hich is assisted by: because the erotic mood (srngdrarasa) in the form of desire is here assisted by the apprehended shyness, which acts as a vyabhicâribhâva.[Brother-in-law:] The word ksana means a festival or holiday. To the woman whom you invited for the holiday [i.e, to your sister-in-law], O brother-in-law, your wife said something, so that she sits weeping in the empty loft in the back yard of the house. Go comfort the poor girl. The woman here spoken of is in love with her brother-in-law and has been addressed sharply by his wife who has learned of the affair. The woman speaking the verse is secretly in love with this “brother- in-law” and has discovered the situation. She speaks about it in order, by indicating that his wife knows about his affair [with his sister-in- law], to cause a quarrel between him and his wife. Here the literal meaning of “comfort her” is shifted to the suggested sense of “com­fort her by sexual intercourse,” as would be natural in such a private place. Or, we may take the literal sense of “comfort her,” intended only as leading to a suggestion of jealous anger, which gives the fi­nal meaning to the words, namely, that you are in love with just her. The speaker intends the comfort literally, meaning that the visiting woman is now the proper and uncensured object of his love, but only as leading on to the suggestion that “I have now become an object of scorn.\" As either of these suggestions serves to reveal the inten­tion of the speaker (viz. her own love for the man addressed], there is no decisive reason for choosing the one or the other. [They axe indeed two different forms of dhvani], for in the latter case the lit­eral sense of comfort remains, pointing on to the further suggestion, while in the former the shift causes it to assume the very form of the suggestion.Or, (we may explain in a different way, by saying that] the verse is spo­ken by a woman who is in love with her brother-in-law and who speaks to him thus after having seen him making love to another woman. This would follow from the use of the vocative, “O brother-in-law,” whereas in the previous explanation we have to explain the vocative as used with reference to [the man’s relation to] the other woman [rather than to the speaker].4It is very common: Everywhere in poetry the final goal is the rasas, etc. Here we find the manifestation of rasadhvani and of bhâva- dhvani by fusion into the same suggestive unit, for in the stanza “White§ 3.43 L ] 647"},{"pageNumber":663,"pageContent":"348herons circle against dark clouds” we relish both the rasa of love and its transient state of mind (vyabhicârin), the distress of sorrow.5Having thus explained the three sorts of fusion, he now gives an example of association: [A case of association ] w ith one of its own varieties.In it: in such words as lipta (lit., “anointed”; here used as “covered, painted with\") the literal meaning is set aside; while in such as “Rama” it is shifted.[ § 3.43 L1. We accept BP's v iant sammisryate for the prakäsyate of the text. 2. These are the three basic types of sankara listed by Udbhata ( Viviti) 5.20- 26. Udbhata makes a double type of the last, depending on whether both members of the pair occur in one sentence or in one väkyämia. 3. Every careful reader has noticed the discrepancy of this figure; see BP, p. 500, or Tri- pathi, p. 1241. The multiplication of 284 by 35 actually gives 9,940, not 7,420. Abhinava has multiplied by 212, not by 284. Can it be that he regarded two types of fusion (that which gives rise to doubt and that where both members of the pair enter into the same suggestive unit) as impossible between a variety of dhvani on the one hand and a subordinated suggestion or figure of speech on the other? This would reduce the total by (35 + 1) x 2 x 35 = 2,520, and would result in the figure which he gives. But if he made such a reduction on this or other grounds, he should have told his readers. 4. This 1 t explanation is certainly the most natural one. It was probably Abhinava’s own view, as commentators generally, though not always, put their favored view 1 t. 5. Compare what Abhinava said of the verse in 2.1 a L.A There is fusion of subordinated suggestions (with dhvani) in such a stanza as “It is already a humiliation that I should have oppo­nents” (see 3.16 A)\\ or in"},{"pageNumber":664,"pageContent":"§ 3.43 a A }Where is the proud cheater of the dice game, he who set afire the house of lac, was prompt to seize the hair and dress of Krsnâ, and who called the Pändavas his slaves?Where is the ruler of Duhsäsana, the elder mentor of a hundred brothers; where is Karna’s friend, Duryodhana?Tell him we have come not in anger to see him.1[ Venisamhära 5.26]For here the final meaning of the stanza, which is a dhvani of the type where the suggested sense is without perceived interval (from the literal sense], is mixed with (subordinated suggestions expressed by] words which give a literal sense qualified by suggestions. And that is why there is no contradiction when a subordinated suggestion resting on the meaning of a word is fused with a dhvani that rests on the meaning of the whole stanza; just as [there is no contradiction in the fusion of dhvani] with one of its own varieties. For just as different types of dhvani can be fused with each other and, by their resting on word meaning and sentence meaning respectively, give rise to no contradiction, (so also here].Furthermore, while there would be contradiction between predomi­nant and subordinate if they rested on the same suggested sense, there is no contradiction when they rest on different suggested senses. For that reason too then there is no contradiction. And just as one may speak of fusion and association of several elements with one without contradiction in a relation of denoted and denoter,2 we may consider the same absence of contradiction to obt in a relation of suggested and suggestor.On the other hand, where some words of a sentence are expressive of a suggestion of the type where the literal sense is unintended and others express the type where the suggestion follows like a reverbera­tion, there we have association [rather than fusion] between dhvani and subordinated suggestion. An example is the stanza “Say, happy friend, if all is well still with the bowers” (2.5 f A). In it the words “compan­ions to the dalliance” and “witnesses of Rädhä’s love” carry a variety of dhvani, while the words “they” and “I know” carry a subordinated suggestion."},{"pageNumber":665,"pageContent":"6501. The last sentence of the stanza is intentionaly ambiguous. The natural way of taking the literal sense of the Sanskrit would be, 'Tell him that we have not come in anger, but to see him.” Given, however, the situation of the play, the character of the speaker Bhima, and the reproaches contained in the preceding lines, the suggested way of taking the sentence is that we have come in anger not to see him but to kill him. 2. The sense is that just as two or more figures of speech (which are väcya) may combine in one word (which is vâcaka), so may two or more suggestions (which are vyangya) combine with one suggestor (vyanjaka).L Having thus exemplified the four types of connection between dhvani and one of its own varieties, he proceeds to illustrate them as they occur between dhvani and subordinated suggestion: T here is fusion of subordinated suggestions, etc.For here: viz., in these two examples. W here the suggested sense is w ithout perceived interval: viz., is of the rasa of fury (raudra). Qualified by suggestions: the term shows that the sug­gestions are subordinate. W ith words: this is an instrumental of characteristic;1 the meaning that is so characterized occurs as a sub­ordinated suggestion; with this there is mixture, that is, fusing, of the dhvani. And since fusion may occur as a relation of assisted and assis- tor, or as a combination subject to doubt, or as the entrance of two var rieties into the same suggestive unit, it should be assigned to whichever type is possble when it occurs in these two exemplar stanzas. Thus, in the stanzas “It is already a humiliation that I should have opponents” and \"Where is the proud cheater,” the aesthetic relish of fury is aided by all the word meanings by their functioning as stimulants (vibhâvas), etc.2In the stanza “Where is the proud cheater” one can see a sugges­tion in every word, every clause, and every compound. So I have not troubled to list them all. The words Pändavä yasya däsäh (lit., “whose slaves the Pändavas are”) are an echo of Duryodhana’s own words.3 Here we can find a subordinated suggestion to conjoin, because it is the literal meaning here (as qualified by a suggestion] that furnishes a stimulus (uddîpana-[vibhâva\\) to Bhïma’s anger.4 At the same time, the suggestion that slaves, who serve a master, must of necessity come to see him, is a case of dhvani (where an interval from the literal sense is perceived] like the reverberation of a bell. As there is beauty in both these suggestions, there is no valid reason for choosing the one over the other.5[ § 3.43a A"},{"pageNumber":666,"pageContent":"651[The third type of fusion, namely] the entrance of both members into the same suggestive unit, [is also found in these stanzas,] because the same words furnish subordinated suggested meanings and also, through their manifesting its vibhävas, etc., the rasa which is predominant in the stanza.A nd th a t is why: [The initial] sense is, because [such a combi­nation] is seen in the examples [just adduced]. But an objector may insist that a subordinated suggestion and a predominant one are mutu­ally contradictory and that even if it is seen, the combination, because it is contrary to reason (ayuktatvät), will not be believed. With this in mind, our author shows that there is no contradiction, because the suggestive units are different: th a t is why, etc.6W ith one of its own: As he has already given examples of dhvani joined by fusion to one of its varieties, he now uses them to illustrate [the point here at issue, viz., the lack of contradiction]. He explains: For ju st as, etc. We must supply “just so here” at the end of the sentence. Or we may read tathä hi (“for just so”) in place of yathä hi (“for just as”).While contradiction may be avoided by a difference of suggestive units when the fusion is one of the first two types, an objector may ask how it can be avoided in the third type, where both suggestions are present in the same suggestive unit. In response to that question our author gives the definitive reason for avoidance: F urtherm ore.For th a t reason too: as the subordinated suggestion is one thing and the predominant is another, what contradiction could there be? But here aD objector may say that he has heard these terms fusion and association used with reference to figures of speech but never to suggestions, With this in mind, our author says, And ju st as, etc. We should consider: he means that by considering, by understanding, we should decide the matter to be so [i.e. without contradiction], for understanding is our final recourse in both cases.Having thus illustrated the three forms of fusion of dhvani with sub­ordinated suggestion, he proceeds to illustrate association: O n the o th er hand, w here som e words, etc. By the word “some” he rules out fusion.7 [In the stanza “Say happy friend”] we have dhvani of the form where the literal is unintended in the words “companions” and “witnesses.”8 By the word \"they,\" although a host of special quali­ties is suggested, the suggestion is subordinated because the beauty of the stanza derives primarily from remembered love, which is given by the literal sense, [as the word “they” denotes directly the remembered§ 3.43 a L ]"},{"pageNumber":667,"pageContent":"fronds of the love bowers]. As for the word “I know,” although it sug­gests an endless number of fancied qualities, its literal meaning in the form of knowing or fancying9 is primary.Thus he has completed his illustration of the four types of combi tion of dhvani with a subordinated suggestion.652 [ § 3.43 a L1. Abhinava hereby corrects the inexact phrasing of Änanda. The fusion, strictly speaking, is between the dhvani and the subordinated suggestions (not the words that give them). Thus he rejects the natural interpretation of padaih sammisratâ (“a mixing with words”) for the interpretation “a mixture that has words,” as we might interpret “an ox with horns\" to be an ox that has horns. 2. Thus in these cases we have fusion of the first type, that is, through a relation of assisted and assistor. 3. That is, Duryodhana had originally said, “The Pândavas are my slaves,\" and Bhïma now repeats his words, changing only the form of the pronoun. 4. Anger is the sthäyibhäva of the ravdrarasa which is predominant, as being the ultimate suggestion of the stanza. 5. That is to say that one and the same phrase, Pändavä yasya däsäh, can be regarded as a case of gunibhütavyangya or of arthasakty- udbhavänurananarüpadhvani. These are mutually contradictory in a single phrase, as the one is from a subordinate category and the other from a pre­dominant. So we should choose one or the other. But as we are left in doubt which to choose, their fusion with the final dhvani of the stanza is of the type “subject to doubt.” 6. BP notices Abhinava’s odd method of proce­dure here: “First he comments on the words ata eva and then he gives an explanatory introduction to the whole passage from ata eva to na virodhah7. Because in fusion the two elements must join in the same locus. As he here speaks of some words carrying one sort of suggestion and others another, the two sorts can be joined only by association. 8. In their literal sense the words suhrd (friend) and säksin (witness) can denote only sentient be­ings. In the stanza in question suhrd (“companions”) is used metaphorically (laksanayâ) to indicate the helpfulness of the bowers to the cowherdesses by offering a secret and lonely place for their trysts, while the word “witnesses” indicates that they were present at Rädhä’s love-making with Krishna. The purpose of the metaphorical usage is to suggest the special degree of helpful presence. Thus the dhvani furnished by these words is avivaksitavâcya of the arthäntarasaiikramita variety. 9. The word jäne is a close relative of manye (“I fancy”), sänke (“I doubt, I might almost think”), etc., which are standard introductions to poetic fancy (utpreksâ); cf. Dandin 2.222."},{"pageNumber":668,"pageContent":"§ 3.43 b L ]A That there is fusion of express figures of speech with dhvani of unperceived succession is well established in all poetry of rasa that makes use of the figures. There is also fusion of the figures with some of the other varieties of dhvani, as in this verse of mine:I am weary from much painting of the world,for though I used the new and wondrous sight of poetswhich busies it If in giving taste to feeling,and used the insight of philosopherswhich shows us objects as they really are,I never found, O God recumbent on the Ocean, a joy like that which comes from love of thee.Here the type of dhvani in which a literal meaning is shifted is assisted by the figure known as contradiction. 11. The literal meaning of the word drsti is shifted by metonymy to the meaning “poetic imagination.\" There is an apparent contradiction so long as one holds to the literal meaning (for sight cannot busy itself with taste), which is removed.as soon as one accepts the shift. As one makes the shift because the contradiction blocks the literal meaning, the shift is assisted by the contradiction. The first three pàdas of the verse are plagiarized by the Yogaväsistha, Chapter on Nirvana, second half, sarga 190, vs. 89 (p. 1521), as was first pointed out by V. Raghavan, JOR 13, pt. 2 (1936).L He now exhibits the varieties of combination of dhvani with the figures of speech: [That th ere is fusion of express] figures of speech. The reason for using the word “express” is that if a figure is suggested, it will be included in the eight varieties [of combinations with suggestion] already described. P o etry : for poetry is always of this sort [viz., a poetry of roso]. Well established: The three va­rieties of fusion, as well as association, can be found in the examples adduced in the Second Book under the Kärikä which begins, “The in­tention must be to keep them subordinate\" (2.18 K ).1 In the stanza “Many times you touch the trembling corner of her eye” (2.18-19 A),"},{"pageNumber":669,"pageContent":"654the figure metaphor-contrast (rüpakavyatireka), previously explained,2 functions as assistant to the srrigärarasa,3 while the figure svabhâvokti (naturalistic description) [inasmuch as it pervades the whole stanza] enters the same locus with the Srrigärarasa.* In the Prakrit stanza “For putting a fence around this badarì\" (3.40a A) we may have either a naturalistic description of a peasant or an instance of dhvani. As we are given no context, there is no decisive reason for favoring the one or the other.5Although a figure of speech must help the rasa, fusion of the two cannot take place in the examples illustrating the principle that “(the figures] should never be oversustained” (2.18 K, with examples given in 2.18-19 e, f A). Hence (what we have there is) association of rasa- dhvani with the figure, as in the stanza “In anger she has bound hi ” (2.18-19 e A) .6T he o th er varieties: that is, the varieties other than rasadhvani.W hich busies itself: We have said that a rasa consists simply in its own arousal.7 In arousing it, poetic imagination is constantly en­gaged in the business, that is, activity, of a description consisting in the combination of the vibhâvas, etc., and then in the construction (of the various suggestors], beginning with phonemes and ending with sentence structure.8 To feeling (in Sanskrit, rasân, “to the rasas): the sense is, in making the sthäyibhävas, which are the essence of what is tasted, to be tasted, that is, in making them fit to be aesthetically relished.9 W ondrous: for it comes awake by transcending the stage of percep­tion of things which fall to a normal course of life. It is on that account that poets are called kavayah: from their being able to describe [in this wondrous way] .10 New: that is, constructing worlds at every moment with ever new and delightful variations. Sight: that is, in the form of poetic imagination (pratibhâ). Here we have the figure of speech, con­tradiction, as if sight, that is, [literally] ocular perception, should give taste to sugar-cakes. Hence it is called “new.” The dhvani in the word “sight” 11 is assisted by this figure. For ocular perception is not entirely unintended, as it is not impossible.12 Nor is the word “sight” intended only as subordinate to some further [suggested] sense;13 rather, it is shifted to another sense, to the sense of imagination which blossoms forth from the constant practice of ocular perception. The contradic­tion assists in the shift. Our author will say just this further on in the words “is assisted by the figure known as contradiction.”[Two analyses are now given of the compound parinisthitarthavi- sayonmesa.] That same sight, being parinisthita, that is, steady orI § 3.43 b L"},{"pageNumber":670,"pageContent":"655firm, had its vision opening upon arthavisaya, that is, the objects to be discriminated. We may also take the compound to mean: that sight which had its vision opening upon parinisthita objects, that is, objects known in the everyday world, rather them upon novel (and fanciful) ob­jects such as would be objects for poets. This insight of philosophers (vipascit) is called vaipaécitï. In saying that he has used both, by his use of the two words kavinâm ( “of poets” ) and vaipaécitï ( “of philoso­phers”) the author as much as says that he is not really a poet or a philosopher, and so suggests his modesty. His sense is that he borrowed these two sorts of sight from elsewhere, as a poor man might borrow provisions to serve [a guest], “Both these,” for one cannot carry out a description or portrayal [of the world] with one sort of sight. T he world: everything. [M uch painting: the Sanskrit is literally “con­stantly describing or portraying\"]: that is, again and again, without rest; describing it by portrayal and picturing things exactly; decid­ing by consideration, inference and such means that this is thus and that that is such; cogitating on the smallest details to discover what is the essence here. For when something is portrayed, the portrait is only perfect if the sight is sometimes busily active and sometimes rests motionless with fixed ga2e upon one detail or another. I: who was wholly addicted to seeking fanciful14 and actual visions. Am w eary: he means that not only has he failed to find the essence, but quite to the contrary, has found only weariness. The word ca, “and” (in “and I found”) has the sense of tu, “but.\" R ecum bent on th e ocean: in yogic sleep. 15 Thou therefore knowest the true nature of the essence; thou hast come to rest in that true nature. Such is the sense. One who is weary will have reverence for one who is at rest. Love of thee: of thee in thy highest form as highest self and essence of the universe; love (bhakti), that is, absorption in thee, an absorption born of succes­sive acts of worship performed with such [preparatory virtues] as faith. Nothing even like that have I found, much less anything equal to it.Accordingly, this stanza represents the words of a man who first took part in devotion to God, then, out of mere curiosity, lived the life of both a poet and philosopher, only at the end to realize once more that repose in the love of God is best. 16 Above the joy that comes from having determined the nature of all objects by every valid means of knowledge, above the joy that is found in relishing transcendent aesthetic flavor, is put the bliss of repose in God the all-highest, for the relishing of aesthetic flavor is no more than the reflection of a drop of that ambrosial bliss. We have said all this before. 17 The final sense is§ 3.43 b L ]"},{"pageNumber":671,"pageContent":"that everyday joy is generally even lower in value than this, for such joy is contaminated with an even greater amount of pain.In this same stanza we may [also] find, by reference to the word drsti, fusion [of the third type], where both members of the pair [viz., dhvani and the figure, contradiction] enter the same suggestive unit.18 By other interpretations we may either take the figure of contradiction to lie in the phrase “making use of sight” as opposed to the description (or painting of the world), or we may take the dhvani in drsti (“sight”) to be of the variety where the literal is wholly abandoned, after the manner of [the literal sense of] the word “blind” [in the stanza “The sun has stolen our affection for the moon” adduced in 2.1 c A). Of these interpretations there will be no valid reason for preferring the one to the other, as both are equally charming. 19 But this [doubt] cannot be applied to the first interpretation which we gave, for there the word “new” by its verbal suggestion similar to a reverberation completely supports the presence of contradiction [rather than a dhvani where the literal sense is abandoned].201. In what follows, however, Abhinava illustrates only two of the vari­eties from the examples of that section. 2. In the previous explanation (2.18-19 L) the recognizing of this figure in the verse was attributed to “oth­ers” with whom Abhinava seemed to disagree. The present remark does not mean that he has changed his mind. All he means is that if the presence of rüpakavyatireka is accepted, the stanza would be an example of anugrähyänu- grâhakabhàvasankara, whereas if one accepts the presence of svabhàvokti it would be an example of ekavyanjakanupravesasankara. 3. The fusion of the dhvani with the figure rüpakavyatireka is therefore of the first type. 4. The fusion of the dhvani with the figure svabhdvokti is therefore of the third type.5. Accordingly, the fusion of the dhvani with the figure of speech is here of the second type. 6. (Patwardhan) Abhinava here claims that when a fig­ure of speech is left imperfectly developed and is not pursued to its logical end, there cannot be anugrähyänugrähakabhävasankara between the figure of speech and the rasadhvani arising from the stanza as a whole, in view of the phrase nätinirvahanaisitä in 2.18. The claim is not convincing. For the rule against pursuing a figure of speech to its logical end has been laid down in 2.18 only with the object of promoting the development of raso in a poem. Consequently, the imperfectly developed figure can very well be said to be congenial to the development of rasa, which means that an imperfectly developed figure can be regarded as anugrâhaka (an assistant) of the rasa. Further, the statement here by Abhinava that there can be samsrsti (associ­ation) between an imperfectly developed figure and rasadhvani is not correct. A samsrsti, according to Änanda (3.43 c A), occurs when the two elements656 [§ 3.43 b L"},{"pageNumber":672,"pageContent":"657joined together occupy separate and independent parts of an äsrayabheda (a poetry-unit, i.e.. a stanza). But in a case where there is a partially developed figure and rasadhvani, the partially developed figure occupies only a part of the stanza and the rasadhvani pervades the whole of the stanza, covering even that part of the stanza where the partially developed figure is located. Here the two elements (viz. the partially developed figure and rasadhvani) cannot be said to be occupying two separate and independent poetry-units. 7. A rasa is nothing but its own arousal (nispddana). Bharata had spoken of the nispatti (arising) of the rasas from a combination of the vibhävas, anubhävas, and vyabhicärins. In 1.18 L Abhinava discusses this nispatti and shows that it differs from the activity which proceeds from a normal cause and results in a normal effect, for a rasa is nothing but the arousal itself; it is the process of relishing, not a manufactured relish. 8. Apparently the word vama has dropped out before prabhrti, probably by haplography caused by the preced­ing varnand The reference in the second half of the sentence is almost surely to 3.2 K. where the suggestors of alaksyakramavyangyadhvani are enumerated. The employment of appropriate gunas and alahkdras would also be covered by ghatand (cf. Locana text p. 59.6; 88.1; 104.7; 188.4). 9. In 2.4 L Abhinavaremarked: “To say that 'rasas «ire perceived’ is a turn of phrase as when we say, ‘he is cooking the rice pudding’ [where to be more precise we should really say ‘he is cooking the rice grains’].” The present passage is analogous. Where Ananda speaks of a poetic vision that makes the rusas have taste, Abhinava takes the real meaning to be a vision which makes the sthdyibhdvas into rusas.10. The word kavih, “poet,\" is derived by Indian tradition from the ver­bal root ku, “to speak,\" (Jfcuri sabde); so Abhinava 1.1 b L (Translation, p. 59 “poetry must be spoken”) and 4.6 L (Translation p. 703). Ksïrasvâmin on AK 2.7.5 derives the word precisely as Abhinava does here; kavate varnayati kavih,/ “One is called a poet because he speaks, he describes.” 11. The dhvani is of the arthdntarasankramitavdcya variety. The meaning is shifted to a metaphorical (Idksanika) sense of the word. The purpose (prayojana) effected by using the word drsti in that metaphorical sense is to suggest the extreme cl ity of poetic vision. (pratibhanasydtisphutatvam). This is the dhvani that resides in the word drsti. 12. Observation of the already ex­isting world is a possible and useful activity of the poet. Abhinava says this is in order to show that the dhvani resident in the word drsti is based on a shift of the literal meaning. It belongs to the variety arthdntarasahkramita- v&cya, not to atyantatiraskrtavdcya. 13. It does not belong to the type of dhvani called vivaksitdnyaparavdcya. 14. The poetic vision is unreal ( mithyd) in reference to the everyday world. Compare the stanza quoted by Änanda in 4.3 A. 15. In which God contracts the universe into himself. In this state he knows the true essence of the phenomenal world to be identical with the highest brahman, for he is it. 16. It is tempting, but by no means safe, to infer that these remarks furnish valid biographical information about§ 3.43 b L ]"},{"pageNumber":673,"pageContent":"658Anandavardhana. A poet does not always write in propria persona. Änanda could have portrayed such a man without being one. Again, the character of the speaker, as drawn by Abbinava, is well known in Indian tradition. It would fit Bhartrhari or Dharmakirti as well as the speaker of this stanza. We know nothing of Änanda’s life, from which to verify his identification with the man whose emotion he here portrays. And yet I would like to believe it. 17. Unfortunately, Abhinava does not tell us where. Certainly not in the Locana or the Abh. 18. (Patwardhan) It is all right to say that there is arthäntarasahkramitaväcyadhvani in the word drsti. But it is not correct to say that there is virodha in the word drsti. The virodha is between drsti (phys­ical sight) and the idea of its enabling one to enjoy such things as sugar cakes. A virodha can exist only between two things. If here it is said to be located in the word drsti, that is only a loose expression. What Abhinava means to say is that there is not only anvgrähyänugrähakabhävasahkara between the dhvani and the virodha in the first two lines of the stanza, as explained above (viz., in Translation, in the sentence that contains reference to note 11), but also there is ekapadänupravesasahkara between the same two elements. 19. Ac­cordingly, the fusion of the dhvani with the figure of speech would be of the second variety, subject to doubt (sandehdspada). But the interpretation by which Abhinava justifies finding this type of fusion in the stanza is not a happy one. BP in explaining it is forced to say that by using sight one sees; to say that “by using sight one describes\" is contradictory. Patwardhan writes as follows. “Actually in the third line of the stanza there is mention of both the visions (viz., of the poet and of the philosopher) and not of one vision only. Further, there is no virodha at all in the statement that poets describe the entire world by resorting to the two visions. Moreover, in the third line there is no question of atyantatiraskrtaväcyadhvani in the word drsti, as the third line speaks of the two separate drstis, and there is no blockage of the literal sense of the word drsti. Since there is neither virodha nor atyantatiraskrta­väcyadhvani in the third line, the question of the presence of sandehasahkara between them does not arise at all. Abhinava's attempt to show that there is sandehasahkara in the third line is anything but successful. In the next sentence he says that the stanza in question is an example of all the three kinds of sahkara. But it is doubtful that Änanda intended this. What he seems to have intended is that the stanza exhibits only one kind of sahkara, viz. that based on anugrähyänugrähakabhäva.\"20. Let us divide the explanation of this difficult sentence into two parts, explaining first what Abhinava means by it and, second, treating the question of whether the sentence, when understood, is justifiable. First, then, Abhi­nava means that if we see the contradiction (virodha) in the stanza to be between the word “sight\" and “gives taste to the rasas,\" we cannot assign to the word “sight” the sort of dhvani where the literal sense is wholly abandoned (atyantatiraskrtaväcyadhvani). The word “sight” must preserve some part of[ § 3.43 b L"},{"pageNumber":674,"pageContent":"659its literal meaning in order for the contradiction to occur. Now, if we are faced with a choice between virodha and atyantatiraskrtaväcyadhvani, there is indeed a valid reason for choosing virodha. That reason lies in the word “new\" which qualifies the word “sight.\" This word suggests something fanciful and beyond normal experience and by this suggestion resolves the contradiction. The virodha must have been present for the éabdasaktyanurananadhvani in the word “new\" to resolve it So there is virodha here but no atyantatiras- krtadhvani and no fusion at all. On the second question, namely whether Abhinava is justified, Professor Patwardhan writes as follows. “Actually it is not correct to say that there is verbal suggestion (sabdasaktyanvranana- dhvani) in the word navi (“new”). For it has one meaning only, viz. novel, i.e., wonderful, and that is directly expressed and not suggested. Further, the fact that there is virodha in the first two lines (between physical sight and its enabling one to enjoy tastes (rasdn) has been already stated and it has been already shown that the virodha is set aside when the word drsti is understood in the sense of poetic vision. Where is the need now to say that the virodha in the first two lines iß definitely supported by the word navi (which is in fact not the case as we have just shown)?”§ 3.43 c A ]A We have an association (sarnsrsti), however, of dhvani with an express figure of speech only with reference to single words, for it is where some words carry an express figure of speech and some carry a variety of dhvani [that we have it]. For example:There, from the Siprä, every dawn a breeze, reddened by its friendship with the nectar of opening lotuses, prolongs the sharp, sweet cry, amorously indistinct, of paddy birds; and by its soothing motion along the limbs of women, like a lover, carries off their lassitude from love and makes a flattering request for more.[Kâlidâsa, Meghadüta 31]For in this stanza the word “friendship” (maitri) carries the type of dhvani where the literal sense is unintended, while other words in the stanza carry various figures of speech."},{"pageNumber":675,"pageContent":"[ § 3.43c LL Having thus illustrated the three varieties of fusion, our author illustrates association: W e have an association, etc. If a figure of speech, and if the suggested sense also, provided it is predominant, resides in the sentence as a whole, we then have fusion of the type where the terms are related as assisted and assistor. But in the absence of this, the two will not come together and so we must have either the figure of speech or the dhvani singly, or both at the same time, attached to individual words.1 These are the three types. Our author makes a restriction among these [three types]: only w ith reference to single words. He proceeds to illustrate the third type, where there can be no suspicion of a relation of assisted and assistor:2 for it is w here, etc. Because it is only where some words carry a figure of speech and where some carry dhvani, as in the stanza “There, from the Sipra,” that we have an association of dhvani w ith an express figure of speech w ith reference to a single w ord. These words (boldface in the translation] must be repeated from the previous line of text and brought into the syntax. For in th is stanza: here the word hi (“for”) should be placed after the term maitripadam.3 Such is the connection of the passage.[Comment on the stanza “There, from the Sipra”] Prolongs: for that sound is carried far by the breeze from the Siprä; furthermore, the birds keep up their calling for a long time, being delighted by the delicate touch of the breeze; and the birds’ cry, being mixed with the soft sound rising from the waves of the Sipra stirred up by the breeze, is prolonged by that fact too.4 S h arp (patu)-.3 thus that gentle breeze does not drown out the cry of the paddy birds, but rather, by acting in cooperation, sharpens it. Nor is this sharpening without benefit, for the cry is sweet and amorously indistinct and so is worth hearing. Every dawn: it is dawn that offers the right time for service of the sort [about to be mentioned]. The plural indicates that this kindliness of the breeze is constant. O pening lotuses: they are sphutitäni, that is, bursting with the load of nectar which they contain; at the saune time sphutitäni, that is. in full bloom and so a delight to the eyes. Friendship with the nectar of these lotuses suggests the gaining of mutual harmony that comes from a continuity of close contact. From this friendship the breeze is kasäya: both enamored, and colored red, by the nectar.6 O f wom en: the breeze, which does this to everything of this sort which is most beautiful in the world.7 carries off the lassitude, the weariness,"},{"pageNumber":676,"pageContent":"661of those who have been engaged in sexual intercourse; and it carries off the lassitude in this regard8 by sharpening the appetite of the lovers for renewed intercourse. It does this not violently or roughly, but following their limbs smoothly, with delightful touch and with acceptance by their hearts. It causes a woman to make flattering requests in this regard9 of her lover. The lover too, his appetite for intercourse aroused by the touch of the breeze, makes flattering requests. As this is done by the breeze, it becomes love’s most precious gift, for love takes its life from mutual passion. And this is to be expected, for that breeze, being associated with the Siprä, is a sophisticated gentleman and not like a country bumpkin. This is what is meant.A lover too, 10 after love-making, is attentive to the body of his part­ner by massaging her limbs and makes flattering requests. In this way he carries off her lassitude from intercourse. He prolongs her cries, that is, the sweet sounds with which she protests. And as he is flattering her, he becomes kasäya, that is, enamored, by his “friendship” with the perfume, that is, his acquaintance with the natural fragrance, of her face which bears the resplendence of a fullblown lotus. He [too] follows the limbs, viz. the sixty-four manners of action in love-play. 1 11The stanza as a whole is spoken by the lover to the cloud in the Meghadüta to the effect that the cloud should surely visit this place [Ujjayinl] where there are such delightful sounds, sights, scents, and objects of touch, and where even the breeze is such a polished gentle­man.Our author applies his definitions to his example: for here th e w ord “friendship,” etc.: We have already said that the word “for\" (hi) should be placed after. Various figures o f speech: in order of occurrence they are:12 poetic fancy (utpreksâ), naturalistic description (svabhâvokti), metaphor (rüpaka), and simile (upamâ).1. That is to say, there are three other possible distributions: (a) thefigure of speech may reside in a single word, while the dhvani pervades the whole stanza; (b) the dhvani may reside in a single word, while the figure of speech pervades the whole stanza; or (c) the figure and the dhvani reside in separate words. 2. Actually, types (a) and (b) of the distributions listed in note 1 will be cases of fusion (aankara). So Xnanda, intending to illustrate association, rules them out. 3. Presumably Abhinava feels that by so shift­ing the particle the sentence will emphasise the fact that the dhvani lies in a single word. But really it makes little difference in which of the two positions hi is placed. 4. The sound seems to come from as far off as the farthest source of the plashing of the waves. Thus three reasons are suggested for the§ 3.43 c L ]"},{"pageNumber":677,"pageContent":"spatial and temporal lengthening of the birds’ cry. 5. BP supposes that Abhinava took the word patu as an adverb, meaning skilfully, rather than in its normal adjectival meaning of “sharp.” The breeze would prolong the cry skilfully by not overcoming it but rather making it more delectable. Aside from the fact that I think Kälidäsa meant the word as an adjective, Abhi- nava’s use of dipayati (excites, sharpens) and dïpanena seems to show that he too understood patu in an adjectival sense. 6. Abhinava gives a double meaning to kasäya: “enamored,\" to fit the simile of a lover, to be introduced in the last line of the stanza, and “colored by the nectar,” to fit the breeze. As a color, kasäya is yellow-red. the color of the Buddhist robe. See also below, 4.7a A, note 1. 7. BP explains: By saying “everything,” Abhinavaexplains the plural in “women.” “Of this sort”: i.e. of feminine gender. By \"most beautiful in the world\" he shows what is suggested. 8. tadvisayäm could mean lassitude toward intercourse (so BP), or it could mean the lassi­tude that takes place in them, viz., women. The former is perhaps better, as tadvisaye surely has that meaning three lines below. 9. I.e., with regard to intercourse.10. Abhinava here turns to the simile, which he carries out by sugges­tion in far greater detail than what is given by the literal sense of the stanza. 1 1. These were mentioned by Abhinava in 2.12 L, on which see note 2. The whole science of love in enjoyment has eight divisions, each of which has eight angäni or prayogäh. 12. Patwardhan finds fault with the inclusion of poetic fancy in this list and he points out (against BP) that samsrsti can exist only between the dhvani resident in maitri (in line 2 of the stanza) and the simile in line 4. He writes as follows. BP says that the word rüpaka is used by Abhinava here in the sense of rüpakàtiéayokti. This is another name for nigirya adhyavasàna atisayokti; see Kuvalayänanda under rüpakàtiéayokti (Kärikä 36). BP claims that this figure occurs in the word kamala (line 2), which also meznsvadana-kamala. It also says that there is a gamyotpreksä (implicit utpreksa) in dirghUcurvan which (according to BP) stands for dirghi­kurvan iva. But this goes against the elaborate explanation of dirghikurvan given above by Abhinava, which clearly shows that dirghikurvan is a factual statement, not a statement based on fancy. According to BP svabhâvokti oc­curs in the second line of the stanza. It would, however, be more correct to say that svabhâvokti pervades the entire stanza, which is a life-like description of the breeze from the River Siprä blowing over Ujjayinl. There is no doubt that upamâ occurs in the fourth line (siprävätah priyatama iva). Since Änanda says that there is avivaksitaväcyadhvani in the word maitri (line 2), and since this stanza has been cited as an example of samsrsti of dhvani with väcya alahkära, we must suppose that the samsrsti occurs between the dhvani in the word maitri (line 2) and the väcya upamä (line 4). Änanda should have said: \"padäntaresu alahkäräntaräni, tesäm madhye upamayä saha avivaksita- väcyadhvaneh samsrstih.” By alankäräntaräni Änanda perhaps meant only1 § 3.43 c L"},{"pageNumber":678,"pageContent":"663svabhävokti, räpaka (i.e., räpakätisayokti, i.e., atisayokti) and upamä. By alankäräntaräni he could not have intended utpreksä in addition to the three alaiikäras mentioned above, as utpreksä is non-existent in the stanza. But even out of the three alaiikäras mentioned above, there is no question of the samsrsti of the avivaksitavâcyadhvani in the word maitri in line 2 with sva­bhävokti or with räpaka. For the areas occupied by avivaksitavâcyadhvani on the one hand and by svabhävokti and räpaka on the other hand, are over­lapping and not distinct from one another, as required by the definition of samsrsti given by Ànanda (3.43 c A, text pp. 510-511). Thus it is clear that although Ànanda speaks of the presence of several alahkäras in the stanza, he could have found samsrsti of the avivaksitavâcyadhvani (in line 2) only with upamä (in line 4) sind not with either svabhävokti or räpaka.§ 3.43 d A ]A An example of dhvani fused with [a figure of speech] that is associated with another figure of speech is the following.The marks of teeth and claws, given by the lion’s mate eager for your blood with loving heartto your body now bristling with joy, are seen by even saints with passionate envy.1For there appears here a dhvani, of the type where no interval is per­ceived [i.e., rasadhvani], fused with the figure of speech contradiction (virodha) which is associated with compressed statement (sam âsokti), for the real object [described] in the stanza is a hero of compassion.2An example of the association of dhvani with a figure of speech that is associated [with another figure of speech] is this:On these days that rumble with fresh cloudsfor persons with a taste for dramatic performance,and are dark as night for travelers,namely, the audience of travelers,beautiful is the dance of peacocwith their outstretched necks.3who pour forth their song."},{"pageNumber":679,"pageContent":"for in this stanza we have the association of dkvani, of the type like a reverberation and where the suggestion arises from the power of words, with [the mutually associated figures] simile and metaphor.41. The author of the stanza is unknown. It is quoted by Mammata 7 vs. 337 (p. 453) and by Hemacandra. AC, vs. 196 (p. 167). On the stanza the Viveka quotes Abhinava’s comments verbatim, without attribution. For inter­pretation see note 2. 2. The dhvani is the suggestion of säntarasa roused bythe portrayal of the Bodhisattva’s virtue. The contradiction lies in the fourth line in the incompatibility of sprhä (passion or envy) with munibhih (saints). For samâaokti. see 1.13d A and L and 1.13j A, note 1. It consists here in our superimposing the behavior of a näyikä on the action of the lioness. The lady would have responded to ther lover’s caresses with the love bites and scratches prescribed by the Kämasästra and would have left his body in a gooseflesh of excitement. In developing the samäsokti one will take raktamanasä to mean \"with loving heart,\" and mrgaräja (“lion king\") to mean “royal king.\" The lady (näyikä) would thus be one of the king's wives. As the samäsokti oc­curs only in the third line and the contradiction only in the fourth, these figures of speech are associated, not fused. As the dhvani derives from the whole stanza, its area includes that of both figures of speech, with which it is therefore said to be fused, not associated. 3. The verse is a derivative of Sattasai 6.59, the words being slightly altered and transposed to permit of double meanings. 4. This stanza, or the stanza from the Sattasai on which it is based, has been variously analysed by Älankärikas, always with results different from Änanda’s. The dhvani arises form the double meanings of the words paoa (= payoda or prayoga), sämäiesu (= éyâmâyitesu or sämäjikesu), and giänam (= grivänäm or gitänäm); and there is an interval of time before we recognize it, so it is rightly called sabdasaktyudbhavänurananarüpa. Now if we take this dhvani as a whole, we must say that it occupies the space (viz., the word sämäiesu) occupied by the simile and metaphor. Accordingly, it would not be associated with them but fused. To justify Änanda’s anal­ysis we must consider only the portion of the dhvani arising from paoa or from giänam. We may then say that that dhvani is associated with the fig­ures. The simile (upamä) resides in sämäiesu if we understand that word as syämäyitesu (= syämä + kyac + kta, literally, “which act like night, or like the night of doomsday” to travelers), because the suffix kyac is prescibed by Panini (3.1.10) to be used “after a stem which serves as a simile.” The metaphor resides in sämäiesu if we understand that word as sämäjikesu, be­cause pathika-sämäjikesu (“to traveler-audiences,” i.e., audiences which are travelers) is a rüpakasamäsa justified by Pan. 2.1.72. But the question arises how these two figures can be said to be associated rather than fused. Viiva- nätha (SD 10.99) takes them as fused by the third type of fusion, where two figures reside in the same word. Others have taken them as fused by the664 [§ 3.43 d A"},{"pageNumber":680,"pageContent":"665second type of fusion, where there is doubt as to which figure is present. No one other than Änanda (and Abhinava, who piously refrains from disagreeing with him here) takes these figures to be associated. In fact, it is a wrong analysis.§ 3.43 d L ]L So far our author has explained and given examples for the portion of Kàrikâ 3.43 that reads “Dhvani appears by fusion and asso­ciation with its own varieties, as well as with subordinated suggestion and with the figures of speech.” He now proceeds to explain the words “and furthermore” and to give examples [of what is thereby intended): An exam ple of dhvani, etc.The meaning of the word “furthermore” is this. Not only is it in­tended that dhvani fuses and is associated with its own varieties, etc., but [it does so also) with varieties, etc., which are fused or associated with each other. However, as it is hard to find the fusion and as­sociation of dhvani with such varieties of itself and such subordinated suggestions as are already fused or associated with each other, 1 no clear example can be given. So he is forced to illustrate (only) the fusion and association with dhvani of a figure of speech which has already been fused or associated with another figure of speech. Of this situation there are four varieties, of which he illustrates the first by the stanza “T he m arks of tee th ?” etc.Here someone speaks a flattering description of a Bodhisattva who has offered his own body to a lioness who was about to eat her cubs [out of hungerj: a body on which has arisen a thick-set horripilation from the great bliss bom of his success in helping others. Raktamanas means one whose mind has an appetite for blood; also one whose heart is full of love. There is contradiction when saints are spoken of as recipients of aroused passion. “W ith envy” suggests that their fondest wish takes the form, “May we too at some time rise to such a height on the pathway of compassion; then we should truly be saints.” The figure samâsokti (compressed statement) is present because of our apprehension here of the behavior of a loving woman (näyikä) . 2A hero of com passion: The term “hero of compassion” is used for a moral hero (dharmavira), as morality is needed for an act of compassion.3 The rasa here is the heroic rasa (virarasa) because energy (utsäha, here the energy of doing good for others) is the basic emotion (sthàyibhâva). Or, we may say that by the word dayâvira the rasa is indicated to be the rasa of peace (säntarasa).4"},{"pageNumber":681,"pageContent":"This rasa is perceived [as fused] with a figure of speech that is already associated [with a second figure of speech]. For the following sense is achieved by power of the figure samäsokti. Just as a man, at the time of his union with a beloved woman whom he has sought in all his wishes, will break out in horripilation, just so does it happen with you on your giving your own body for another’s sake. And hereby a high degree of compassion is stimulated by the coming together of symptom (anubhäva, here the horripilation) and determinant (vibhäva; here the lioness forms the älambanambhäva while the bites and lacerations form the uddipanambhäva).He now illustrates a second variety: An exam ple of th e associa­tion of dhvani, etc.On these days in which there is a rumbling of fresh, that is, beautiful, clouds and which are as dark as night for travelers, that is, which act like night inasmuch as they cause the stupor of travelers.5 Or, we may interpret as “days from which (i.e., because of which) there arises the travelers’ dark complexion (syäm ikä) from pain.” Beautiful is the dance of peacocks with their outstretched necks.[As the Prakrit words of the stanza are susceptible of a different Sanskrit rendering, the following sense is suggested.]6 There being an audience of travelers with a taste for dramatic performance, beautiful is the dance of the peacocks with their prasärita song, that is, whose song follows upon a prolonged keynote (?) (särana),7 or whose necks (griva.) are stretched forth for a grivärecaka.8 The suffix kyac9 is used in the sense that these days behave like nights to the travelers. Thus an ellip­tical simile is indicated by the suffix. 10 As the word pathika-sämäjikesu is clearly a karm adhämya compound, 11 it furnishes a metaphor. Our author’s meaning is that these two figures of speech (viz., simile and metaphor) are associated with the suggestion (dhvani).As the two remaining varieties12 may be illustrated by this very stanza, our author has not furnished another example.To explain: Since the vyäghrädi group of words [which are permitted by Panini 2.1.56 to act as simile words when placed last in a compound] is an open-ended group,13 the compound pathika-sämäjikesu is subject to doubt whether it contain a simile or a metaphor;14 hence these figures are fused with each other in it. With these fused figures the [dhvani or suggestion] arising from the power of the words [viz., ahinaapaoarasiesu and pasänagiänam] to suggest respectively abhinayaprayoge rasikesu and prasäritagitänäm is connected only by association, [not by fusion] because the suggestion is not assisted by those figures. On the other66b [§ 3.43 d L"},{"pageNumber":682,"pageContent":"667hand, the dhvani (suggestion) arising from the power of the words pahiasämäiesu (to suggest pathikasämäjikesu] is fused with these same fused figures because the dhvani and the fused figures occur in the same words. Thus the two remaining varieties, viz., association of dhvani with fused figures of speech and fusion of dhvani with fused figures of speech should be understood [as also present in this stanza].1. For dhvanïnâm (text p. 514, line 1 of Locana) we must read dhvaninä with BP. Likewise, to produce normal syntax, we should read dhvaninä in place of dhvanau in line 3 of the same page. 2. In fact one’s immediate apprehension on hearing the first three lines of the stanza is exactly that. Only in the fourth line do we see that a very different matter is the true subject (prakrtdrtha) of the stanza and that the suggestion of queenly passion is apra- krta (not the subject in hand) and so forms the figure samdsokti. 3. Abhi- nava’s explanation is occasioned by the fact that BhNÉ makes no mention of daydvira, which seems to represent a preeminently Buddhist concept. The three types of hero listed-by BhNS (6.79) are ddnavira (a hero of generosity), dharmavira (a moral or religious hero), and yuddhamra (a military hero). One may note that likewise in the Mahdbhdrata’s long list (13.74.23-27) of twenty- one types of hero (sum), there is no dayäsüra. 4. See Abhinava’s discussion in 3.26 a L. 5. Abbinava gives the prescribed meaning of «pamänäd äcäre (“in the sense of behaving like that, when suffixed to a simile-word”) to the suffix kyac = (äya in syàmâya; see Pan. 3.1.10). The days of the monsoon cause the travelers moha, because this is the season when lovers long to be together and because travelers in Sanskrit poetry are always supposed to be traveling without wife or sweetheart. 6. For the primary meaning, the rendering will be: Abhinava-payoda-rasitesu pathika-sydmdyitesu divasesu / sobhate prdsärita-grivänäm nrtyam mayvravniddndm / / For the suggestion, the rendering will be: abhinaya-prayoga-rasikesv pathika-sdmdjikesu / sobhate prasdrita-gitdndm mayüruvrndänäm / / 7. Both saranâ and sdrana seem tobe used in this sense. See P W and SRK 1737c and note. 8. We do not know just what Abhinava means by this term. BhNÉ defines grivärecita at 8.173 as a shaking or twisting of the neck used in dramatic performance. The ABh on Book 8 is lost, but Abhinava quotes 8.173 in a different form in commenting on 4.67 (Voi. 1, p. 99). He finds fault with the verse as quoted, but his correction is not intelligible to us. 9. See note 5, above.10. A simile is full (pvrnd) when all four of its members are present: the simile proper (upamäna), the base (upameya), the common quality (samäno dharmah) and a simile-denoting word ( aupamyavdcaka) ; for example, \"her face is delightful as the moon” (candra iva ählädakam mukham). Where one or more of these members is absent the simile is elliptical (luptd). According to Mammata, in a simile expressed by means of a word bearing the suffix kyac, the aupamyavdcaka is absent (Book 10, comment on sütra 127; cf. verse 403§ 3.43 d L }"},{"pageNumber":683,"pageContent":"668and Jhalkikar, p. 570, lines 18-20). Other Älankärikas say that the aupamya- väcaka may be understood in these cases from Panini’s sütro 3.1.10 and that it is the samäno dharmah or sädharmya that is absent (cf. SD on 10.19.). 11. Abhinava’s expression is abbreviated. The word pathika-sämäjikesu as it occurs in the stanza (if we so render the Prakrit pahiasämäiesu) is actu­ally a bahuvrihi compound modifying divasesu, but it is based on a karma- dhäraya: days in which there are traveler-audiences (yesu pathikasämäjikäs tesa divasesu). This formation, permissable by Pan. 2.1.72, is a räpakasamäsa (metaphor compound), meaning audiences which are travelers. 1 2. Viz., the association of dhvani ith two alankäras which are fused with each other; and the fusion of dhvani with two alankäras which are fused with each other. 13. That is to say, the group vyäghra, etc., listed in the Ganapdtha may be added to. Not only may we say purusa-vyäghra “a tiger of a man,\" i.e., a man who is like a tiger, or purusa-simha, etc., but, according to Abhinava, we we may say pathika-sämäjikesu, meaning travelers who are like an audi­ence. Thus the compound need not be explained as a metaphor compound (see note 11 above), but might be a simile compound. As usual, Abhinava is grammatically correct, but the interpretation as a simile compound is most unnatural. 14. That is, pathikasämäjikesu may mean “for travelers who are like an audience,” or “for an audience which is [i.e., which consists of nothing but] travelers.\"[ § 3.43d LK So who could ever enumerate the varieties and subvarieties of dhvani?

One may either supply a correlative sa before mvecyah, or take the reading “(a)yam\" in place of uyo,” which is reported by Abhinava as that of “others.” Either method will furnish a syntax simpler than that recommended by Abhinava, who takes kävyatattvam etad (in 3.46) as correlative with yo dhvanih (in 3.45), thus making 3.45-46 into a single sentence.A Because good poets and sensitive readers, if they are adept in discerning dhvani as of the nature here described, will surely attain the highest position in the realm of poetry.L [See L's comment on 3.46.]K It was persons unable to analyse the true nature of poetry as here given, for it appeared to them [only] unclearly, who propounded the doctrine of “styles” (ritayah).11.

This statement is connected with the following Kârikâ (3.46).

In 2.7 A it was stated that the guna, mädhurya, is ultimately nothing but the rasa, srngära.K The vrttis also, those which depend on the nature of words or sound and those which are connected with the nature of meaning, will appear [in their true nature] once this doctrine of poetry is known."},{"pageNumber":686,"pageContent":"§ 3.47 A ]A Once this doctrine of poetry, which is based on an analysis of the relation between suggestor and suggested, is known, both those well-known vrttis such as the upanägarikä, which are based on the nature of words or sounds, and those, such as the kaisiki, which are connected with the nature of the meaning, will follow precisely the same path as the rftis. 1 If this were not so, the vrttis, like invisible things, would be things we could not believe in and would not be validated by experience. So the true nature of dhvani must be clearly defined.The definition of dhvani, given by a certain critic, is wrong and should not be given, when he says, “We may speak of dhvani whenever an inef­fable beauty of certain words and certain meanings is perceptible only to special cognizors, just as the rarity of certain gems (is known only to special experts].” 2 For the special [virtue] of words, so far as their phonetic form is concerned is that they be pleasant to the ear and not repetitious. Their special [virtue] as denotative units is that they be clear (in their literal sense] and suggestive [of a further sense]. The spe­cial [virtue] of meanings is that they appear clearly and be subordinate to a suggested meaning [as in dhvani] or be qualified by a suggested el­ement [as in subordinated suggestion]. These special [virtues] of words and meanings can be explained and have been explained in many ways. To imagine that there is some ineffable virtue over and above these is to admit that one’s power of analysis has ceased. For ineffability, in the sense of being beyond the range of all words, cannot be predicated of anything, because in the last analysis a thing can be designated by the word “ineffable.” As for the definition sometimes given of ineffa­bility, that it is the appearance of a thing [viz., of a unique particular] which cannot be referred to by a word for a mental construct (vikalpa) which is based on (samsparsi, lit., which touches upon) the general or universal,3 this can no more apply to the special virtues of poetry than it can to the special virtues of gems. For the virtues of the former have been analysed by literary critics, while no estimate can be made of the value of a gem by reference merely to the general or universal. It is true, however, in both cases that these special virtues are recognizable only by experts. For only jewelers are knowers' of gems and only sen­sitive critics (sahrdayâh) are knowers of the rasa of poetry. On this point no one will argue.In regard to the well-known doctrine of the Buddhists that ineffability is predicable of everything, I plan to write an exposition in a book which"},{"pageNumber":687,"pageContent":"will examine their theories.4 As it would give offense to literary critics to set forth here details which may be learned from another book, I shall not do so. Or, we may let our definition of dhvani stand just as the definition of perception stands in Buddhist doctrine.®Accordingly, as no other characterization of dhvani [in the sense in which we have been using it] stands to reason,6 and as this [sense] is not the literal meaning of the word [“d/ivam”],7 the correct definition is the one which we have given. This is stated [in verse]:To say that it appears as an ineffable elementis no definition of dhvani,inasmuch as its sense can be explained.The correct definition is the one here given.Here ends the Third Book of the Sahrdayäloka composed by the teacher Sri Räjänaka Änandavardhana.1. I.e., they will appear in their true nature as being no more than ways in which the punas are employed and thus as being ultimately a matter of rasa. 2. The original form of what the critic said should be closer to that given in 3.33 a A (Text p. 403, line 1), because the words there formed a half sloka. But in that passage Änanda attributed the objector’s simile to rasa, not to dhvani. The ineffability of dhvani is a view which was mentioned in 1.1 e A. 3. The passage is translated in accord with Abhinava’s interpretation, with the component samsparsi modifying vikalpa. In the Buddhist epistemology of Dignäga and Dharmaklrti, later borrowed in part by the Nyäya-Vaiiesika, it is supposed that of all objects of knowledge we first have an indeterminate perception (nirvikalpaka jndna), a perception that contains no mental con­struction (vikalpa) but that responds to the mere that-ness which confronts our senses. In the determinate perception (savikalpaka jndna) which follows, we identify the object with some universal, that of horse, man, or as the case may be. All our words refer only to these determinate perceptions. Where the Buddhists disagree with the Nyâya-Vaisesika is in their holding the unique and momentary particular (svalaksana) of our indeterminate perception to be the sole reality. The mental construct, which permits us to speak of it, at the same time falsifies it. Hence the extreme Buddhist position, to which Änanda next refers, that every real thing is ineffable. 4. This book, the Dharmottari- trivrti, was still available to Abhinava. It is lost to us. 5. Perception of the true nature of things is unverbalizable according to the Buddhist idealists. This did not prevent them, however, from giving highly useful definitions of correct and false perception on the level of vyavahdra (the give-and-take of the world, as opposed to ultimate truth). 6. I.e., dhvani cannot be character­ized by bhakti or by abhidhd or by tdtparyavrtti or by anumdna or by saying that it is indefinable. 7. I.e., it is not literally a “tone” or “reverberation.”r§ 3.T7 a"},{"pageNumber":688,"pageContent":"§ 3.47 L ]L W ill appear: that is, they will become established by expe­rience as being [included] in the life of poetry.T he sam e p ath as th e rftis: because they will be like the rftis in being ultimately a matter of rasa. Or, we may take the variant reading pratïtipadavïm, they will enter “the path of our perception.” For that alliterative vrtti which has [its name from its] similarity to a sophisticated lady terminates in such rasas as the erotic (srngâra); the harsh vrtti terminates in fiery rasas such as the rasa of fury (raudra); the soft (komala) in such as the comic (häsya).* Similarly, when the sage [Bharata] states that “the vrttis are the sources of poetry,” 2 he uses the word vrtti for a kind of behavior [attitude, costume, bearing] appropriate to the prevailing rasa. He states this [explicitly] in the following words:The KaisikJ [vrtti], which makes use of charming costume, is born of [l.e., appropriate to] the erotic rasa.3By his words here our author has accepted to some extent the con­cepts that were announced in the words, “The vrttis and the rftis have reached our ears; what is this thing called dhvani that it should differ from these?” (1.1 a A), these words having been given under the alter­native views possible for those ‘who say that dhvani does not exist” (1.1 K). But he has also criticized them, in saying that [the true nature of poetry] “appeared unclearly” [to those who employed these terms] (3.46 K, i4).4He now criticizes the objection that dhvani “lies outside the scope of speech” (1.1 K), although he has already criticized it in Book One, for he feels that after all the det led discussion [of dhvani which he has furnished], the view that it is ineffable becomes simply impossible.P leasant to th e ear: without harshness to the ear.

What he has in mind is that at that rate ineffability would be too wide a definition for dhvani, for by it dhvani would be the same, as regards what one could say of it, as everything else. From an o th er book: There exists an “Explanation” (vivrti) written by our author on the Dharmottari, which is a commen­tary on the [Pramana-] Viniscaya.6 In that book he has explained the matter.This is stated : he means, is stated by himself, to serve as a sum­mary. That there appears in a poem an element that is ineffable is no sufficient characterization of dhvani; such is the syntax. He gives his reason: inasm uch as its sense can be explained, that is, because one can state it (vaktum) distinctly (nis). Another commentator has taken the prefix nis in nirväcya in its negative sense [by which nir- väcyärthatayä would mean “because its sense cannot be stated”] and takes this as giving the reason why the element is ineffable. But this is awkward, for the reason would not differ from what it was intended to prove. So the explanation we have given is the only correct one.[May my words prove] auspicious.This Eye, by surveying all the varieties of dhvani spread out in this Light of Poetry, will furnish men now with their sought-for goal.I praise the Mediating Power, the great goddess dear to Siva, who gives clarity to those differenc which were previously prepared.7Here ends the Third Book of the Sahrdayalokalocana, an exposition of dhvani, revealed by the great Saiva master, the revered teacher, Abhinavagupta. 1 * * 41.

He uses the words, a fur­th e r purpose, because the purpose will now appear so precise that its description will seem other than the imprecise description which preceded. Or, we may take the passage differently, as follows. We will state something further, viz., a distinction between the said two purposes; we will describe the usefulness of dhvani in composing good poetry and its usefulness in recognizing good poetry. Of these, the way in which dhvani works in composing good poetry must be stated first, for we can recognize only what has first been created.2 So the Kârikâ now states: B y this road of dhvani, etc.677"},{"pageNumber":693,"pageContent":"1. éânkarî Sakti is here used as a name of Mäyä.

They are: srsti (creation), sthiti (maintenance), samhära (dissolution), tirobhäva (concealment, illusion), and anugraha (the favoring of his devotees). 2. Abhinava’s second explanation isnot a happy one. The distinction between the way in which the dhvani theory helps in composition and the way in which it helps in recognition is not given anywhere in the Fourth Chapter. What is shown, and in considerable detail, is how the knowledge of dhvani helps the poet to compose good poetry. One must therefore suppose that the second aim, the recognizing of good poetry follows automatically. The “distinction” would thereby be obliterated.[ § 4.1 Introduction LK By this road of dhvani and of subordinated suggestion, which has been shown, the imagination of poets can be indefinitely extended.A Of this path of dhvani and subordinated suggestion, which has been revealed, a further result is an infinite extension of the poet’s imagination (pratibhä). If one asks how this is achieved, [the next Kärikä gives the answer].L Now it may be objected that to say that an infinite extension of imagination comes from the varieties of dhvani is to confuse the loci [of cause and effect] .* 1 With this in mind, our author says, how is this achieved?1. The varieties of dhvani reside in poetry; the extended imagination re­sides in the poet. The solution of this difficulty, of course, is that the extended imagination of the poet actually comes from his knowledge of the varieties of dhvani. Knowledge and imagination share the same locus (samänädhikarana)."},{"pageNumber":694,"pageContent":"§ 4.2 A]K For hereby, when ornamented by even one of the varieties [of dhvani], speech acquires a fresh color, even though it follows a subject matter that is old.A Hereby, when ornamented by even one from among the stated varieties of dhvani, speech acquires a fresh color, even though it takes for its subject a matter that has been treated by poets of the past. Thus, a freshness derives from use of the two varieties of dhvani where the literal sense is unintended, even where an old subject is treated, as in the following stanza.Her smile is half innocent,her wealth of glances tremulous and sweet;the quaver of her voice is moistwith a new wave of dalliance;the motion of her gaitis perfumed with budding grace:what is not charming in a fawn-eyed maidas she touches adolescence?[Bhartrhari 93]1A fresh color appears here by the use of that type of dhvani where the literal meaning is set aside, despite the fact that there are [older] stanzas such as:Her beautiful opening smile, her flashing eyes, tremulous speech, and her gait langorous with weight of hips: what is not endearing in this damsel?In the same way, in the following stanza:He who is first is first indeed.And so the lion, eating the mounded meat of his slaughtered elephant, is a lion to other beasts.Who is there that can put him down?2"},{"pageNumber":695,"pageContent":"there appears a freshness by the use of that type of dhvani where the literal meaning is shifted to another sense, despite the fact that there are [older] stanzas such as:He who has bought his greatness by his valor is overcome by none.Is the lion ever defeated by elephants for all their size?1. Both this stanza and the stanza quoted just below are svabhävoktis, or naturalistic descriptions. The Bhartrhari stanza is quoted by SRK 367 and by other anthologies. It is also quoted by Abhinava in his Abh. on BhNÉ 22.11. Abhinava will point out below the words of the stanza which carry atyanta- tiraskrtaväcyadhvani. 2. We do not know the origin of this stanza or of the one quoted just below. Both are arthäntaranyäsas (substantiations, see 1.13 i, L and note 8). The present stanza certainly gains a novel effect by its use of arthäntarasankramitaväcyadhvani. But one may note that the second illustration also is not devoid of dhvani. The word trita (bought) is certainly used metaphorically, a fact that would force Änanda to recognize that some suggestion was envisaged by the poet. Presumably he felt that the suggestion was not sufficiently charming: compare his words in 1.14 A: vyahgyakrtam mahat sausthavam nästi. One may also remark that the “greatness” (mahimä) is given away (svasabdanivedita) by what follows in the second half of the stanza, thus destroyiong the effect of the suggestion.L Herewith the answer [to the question just posed]: H ereby, etc. The force of the word “even” [in its first occurrence] is this: that granted there are many varieties, the effect occurs by even one of them alone. What is here stated amounts to the following. Poetic imagi­nation (pratibhäna) is a special insight (pratijnä) into the matter1 to be described. Because of the limited number of things worthy of de­scription and because these have been touched on by the first poet [Valmlki], a poetic imagination that takes these things for its object would be the same as his; and the poetry resulting therefrom would be be the same. Accordingly, the profession of poet would by now have become obsolete. But by the multiplicity [of dhvani], of which we have spoken, these same things become limitless; hence there arises an infinity of poetic imagination taking them as its object. The Kärikä explains the result which is attained by this infinity of poetic imagina­tion by saying, speech acquires a fresh color. By this, the speech of poetic literature, at least, acquires a fresh color. This can come about"},{"pageNumber":696,"pageContent":"681only if the poetic imagination is endless; and that only if the objects to describe are endless; and that only because of the variety of dhvani.2Our author illustrates the first in order of these varieties, namely that where the literal sense is wholly set aside: her smile, etc. Here the literal meaning of mugdha (confused, simple), madhura (sweet), vibkava (wealth), sarasa (moist), kisalayita (budding), parimala (per­fumed), sparsana (touching), are wholly set aside. These words [in their metaphorical use] carry the following suggestions.. Her “mugdha smile” suggests its unaffected beauty. That her glance is “sweet” sug­gests that it is lovable to everyone. Her “wealth” of glances suggests their inexhaustible artillery. That her voice is “moist\" suggests that it assuages the heat of fever and gives delight. \"Budding\" grace suggests its delicacy. That her gait is “perfumed” with such grace suggests the continuance of its impression for all time. That she is “touching” ado­lescence suggests that in spite of herself she is meeting with something desirable.3 As soon as a smile, which is a well known object, becomes endowed with a property other than those properties placed in it by old Brahma, it becomes something new. The same principle holds in all the other cases.The word asya (Text, p. 524, line 1) construes with the words apûr- vam eva pratibhâsate (p. 524, lines 4-5) [literally, “of this (stanza) a fresh color appears\"]. In the following instances also, where the word asya precedes a quotation, it is to be construed with the word navatvam which follows the quotation.[He who is first:] The second instance of the word first suggests a sense that is shifted to something other [than the literal], namely, to such suggested properties as irresistible supremacy and uniqueness. In similar fashion [the second instance of] the word lion suggests a sense shifted to such properties as heroism, autocracy, and the calling forth of wonder. 11. Vastunisthah, i.e., vastwisayakah,; see 3.33 b L, note 2. 2. Thecausal chain is as follows: dhvanibheda or dhvanivaicitrya gives rise to ar- thdnantya, which gives rise to kavipratibhdnantya, which gives rise to kdvya- vdkydndm navatvam. What is notable here is that the variety of suggestiveness is placed outside the human mind; it is the cause, not the result of poetic imagination. It is as though our authors thought of the obj ts of the world as existing in a pattern which rendered them amenable to mutual suggestions when viewed by a great poet. The poet’s imagination, in this view, would be the medium, not the primary cause, of the creation of new worlds. The worlds would be already there through the magic which underlies dhvani. Such a view§ 4.2 L]"},{"pageNumber":697,"pageContent":"682is in harmony with the origin of the Sanskrit word for poet, kavi. A kavi is a seer, a revealer. 3. Abhinava jumps directly from the literal senses to the suggested senses without mentioning the metaphorical (bhäkta, patina). One may supply them as follows: innocent, pleasing, abundance, soothing, beginning to manifest, rendered attractive, its encountering.[ § 4.2 LA A fresh color may appear in a verse by use of one of the described varieties of dhvani where the literal is intended but is subor­dinate to a second meaning. As an example, take the stanza:The bride has lowered her lips to her beloved’s face, but afraid of waking him, for he pretends to sleep, she checks the relish of her kiss and hesitates with watchful turning; he too continues motionless, fearing that in shame she may wholly turn aside.In such a moment these two hearts, caught in the state of their anticipation, have reached the peak of love. 1A freshness appears in this stanza although there are [older] stanzas like the following:Seeing that the attendant had left the bedroom, the young wife rose half upright from the bed and gazing long upon her husband’s face as he lay there feigning sleep, at last took courage and kissed him lightly, only to discover his feint by the rising flush upon his cheek.When then she hung her head in shame, her dear one seized her, laughing, and kissed her in full earnest.[Amaru Collection 82]JIn the same way, the stanza, “Its waves are her frowns,” etc., shows originality when compared with the stanza beginning nänäbhangibhra- madbhrûh (“with its many curling waves for frowns’’ ) . 3"},{"pageNumber":698,"pageContent":"6831. The author remains anonymous. I have translated in accordance with Abhinava’s comment, who in pdda b overlooks the word apt and gives to dbhogalolam the sense of “hesitatingly turning (to examine whether he is asleep).\" But I think a more likely interpretation would be “although (apt) she had checked the relish of a kiss, she is waiting (sthitä) in eagerness (lolam) to enjoy it (âbhoga = bhoga).\" 2. Both stanzas contain dhvani of the type vivaksitdnyaparavdcya, subtype asamlaksyakmma, leading to srngdramsa. So Änanda adduces the examples not as showing the presence and absence of dhvani, but as showing that any subject, whether or not dhvani has already been used in its treatment, can appear fresh by a new application of dhvani. The first stanza is more subtle than the second, for in it a kiss is only antici­pated, not consummated, and the vyabhicdribhdva, shame or embarrassment, is only hypothetical, whereas in Amaru’s verse it is directly expressed. Fi­nally, the first stanza exhibits a special harmony of mood between the two lovers. For these reasons Abhinava prefers it, although he does not deny rasa to the second, which, because of its simplicity, a modem reader may actually prefer. 3. The first of these quotations is from the stanza of Kalidasa’s Vikramorvasiya, quoted in 2.5 f A. We do not know the source of the second. From what Abhinava says at the outset of his comment on 4.3, he must regard the quotation from Kälidäsa as an example of the fourth variety of dhvani, samlaksyakramadyotita.§ 4.2 a L ]L Having thus exemplified the two varieties of the first type of dhvani,1 he now prepares to give examples of the second type, where th e literal is intended [but is sub o rd in ate to a seond meaning].[The b rid e has lowered:] nidräkaitaxn, lit., a pretender in sleep; that is, l)is sleep is false. Has lowered her lips to his face: she cannot renounce the heavenly joy that arises from the touch of his face; that is why he is called h er beloved.T he bride: that is, newlywed. She is forcibly checked by fear of w aking, that is, of waking her beloved. Time and again she starts forward, only with difficulty to check for the smallest instant her desire to kiss him. That is why she remains h esitant w ith turning, that is, examining again and again whether he is asleep. But still she cannot turn back altogether from her would-be kiss. While her dear one for his part makes no motion to kiss her, fearing that if he were to kiss her as she now is, she would be covered with shame and would turn away.T h eir h earts are caught in th e state of th eir anticipation (hrdayam säkähksäpratipatti näma): [The literal sense of the bahu- vrihi adjective is that] their hearts are such that their state is one of säkähksä, anticipation or yearning; that is. agitated by love-longing"},{"pageNumber":699,"pageContent":"rather than satisfied by the accomplishment of their desire. They have, however, achieved the ultimate bliss which consists in regarding one’s partner as the all-in-all of life, a bliss which has not required any plunge through physical experience; and hereby their love (srngara) has be­come perfect.2In the second stanza the kiss is achieved and the shame (or embar­rassment) directly expressed. Although the love is strengthened by the words “he kissed her [in good earnest],” still, in the first stanza the pas­sion, without there appearing any possibility that the mutual restraint of their burgeoning desires should cease, bespeaks the union in a single state of mind of the two lovers, and so the love is strengthened to a greater degree.1. That is, the varieties atyantatiraskrta and arthäntarasankramita of the type avivoksitaväcya. 2. The metaphor underlying the sentence is of the river of transmigration into which one is plunged and from which one may reach the farther shore (päram), where lies the summum bonum (parinirvrtti = parinirvânam). As for the final word srngära, it is hard to say whether Abhinava is thinking more of the quality of love exhibited by the lovers, or the aesthetic enjoyment of srngärarasa by the reader.K In this way the manifold complexity of the rasas, etc., should be sought out. The path of poetry, although [it seems to be] limited, will extend to infinity by this aid.A As has been said above, the area of the rasas, bhävas, im­proper rasas and bhävas, and the cessation of these four elements, is of manifold complexity if one calculates the variety of vibhävas and anu- bhävas that belong to each. This whole enea should be sought out [or put to use] in this way so that by use of the rasas, etc., the path of po­etry, which seems to be limited by its having been trodden by so many thousands, or really a countless number, of poets, may extend to in­finity.

Through the use of each one of them an event of the world, whatever it may be, can be made by a good poet at will to appear other than as it is. This too was stated above in our discussion of cifra poetry (3.41-42 a .4, final verse). A great poet also has composed a stanza on the subject:Victorious is the goddess Speech, enlarger of the poet’s field, who many a matter, though it be not such, can fit within our heart as if it were.Thus it is well established that through recourse to the rasa s, bhâvas, etc., the subjects of poetry are endless.§ 4.3 L ]L Having thus exemplified the four basic types [of dhvani], our author, by extrapolation of the character found in the alaksyakrama type, makes a statement that holds for every variety:1 In this way, etc. Should be sought out: should be illustrated.As has been said: viz., in the words:The varieties of the elements subordinate to this (rusa or the like] and the varieties within itself, when one imagines all the possible combinations with one another, are infinite. [2 .1 2 K]This to o was stated: The word ca is here used in the sense of api and is placed in abnormal position. What is meant is “this too was stated” (etad api pratipäditam), viz., in the words, “may treat unliving things as living, and living as unliving” (3.40-41 a A, final verse).T hough it be not such: this refers to the external (reality). As if it were: the sense is that the created vision is of the most wondrous form, because, as shown by the word iva (“as if”), the mind cannot come to rest on either one or the other (viz., the reality or the vision).W ith in our heart: that is, on the touchstone for testing the true gold of all the bhâvas. C an fix: that is, can place it immovably within the heart of whoever has a heart. Hence these [visions] are different from everyday matters; they become a special sort of matter. And it is only when they have been fixed in the heart that they become so; and not otherwise.2 Victorious: she is superior to the creator gods of limited powers. By her grace the poet’s field, that is, the objects which he describes, become enlarged, li itless."},{"pageNumber":701,"pageContent":"1. Abhinava’s reasoning seems to be as follows. It is only in the asam- laksyakrama type (the type where no sequence is observed from the denoted to the suggested meaning) that the rasas, etc. are prominant, and it is in the rasas, etc., that the manifold complexity is found. However, one may use this manifold complexity to explain how other varieties of dhvani also may impart an endless variety to poetry. 2. Here again, as in his introductory stanza to the Locano, Abhinava emphasises the importance of the audience. Compare also his remarks on 2.27. Poetry requires an auditor as well as a poet.686 [ § 4.3 L[There is no new Kärikä at this point. The stanza which Änanda here introduces, as is obvious from the fact that he does not comment on it, is either a saiigrahasloka (summarizing stanza) or a parikarasloka (supplementary stanza). But we have thought it best not to disturb the traditional numeration.]A To explain the same point, the following is said:By use of the rasas, things that have been long seen appear as if new, like trees at the coming of spring.Thus there may be a fresh color by use of that type of dhvani where the literal sense is intended but where there is [subordination to] a sug­gestion, in the variety where the suggestion arises like a reverberation from the power of words; as for example in the passage:You are now all that is left.You are now the world-serpent âesa.[Bäna, Harsacarita]1although there exist such stanzas as the following:Sesa, Himalaya, and you are great, are dignified and firm: you three hold steady the shaking earth, never transgressing the law.[Bhämaha 3.28]2There may be a fresh color by use of the same [type of dhvani] in the variety where the suggestion arises like a reverberation from the power of meaning.

In the last quarter we must read bibrtha with all the editions of Bhämaha. Two of the NS MSS of Dhv. read bibhrthâh, which makes a non-sequitur as well as a solecism. The reading of the Käshi and Vidyäbhävan editions, bibhrate, falls into the latter of these faults. The snake, the mountain, and the king support the earth not for their own benefit but for that of others. The voice should therefore be parasmaipada. The verse is presumably by Bhämaha him­self, who was a good grammarian. The stanza raises a problem of chronol­ogy, as Bäna’s Harsacarita must have been written about a.d. 640, whereas Bhämaha, since he mentions the Nyâsakâra, can scarcely be placed before 700. P. V. Kane deals with the problem, HSP pp. 116-117. He offers two possible explanations: (a) that Ananda was not concerned with the chronol­ogy of his examples, wishing only to show that a passage could be fresh and charming by the use of dhvani. although there might be many other passages in one’s library on the same subject; (b) that Änanda was igno­rant of Bäna’s date. In the second quarter of the stanza there are puns in gnravah (dignified, of the king; heavy, of the snake and mountain) and sthiräh (firm-minded, of the king; steady, of the snake and mountain). 3. The stanza is quoted in full and discussed in 2.22 A. See also 3.39 A and 3.43 A.4. The stanza states directly what is only suggested in the stanza of Kali­dasa. Thus it fails to achieve rasa. 5. For the complete verse and for discussion of this type of dhvani, see 2.24 A, L. 6. Anonymous. The verse is not good. It deserves the jingling alliteration that I have given it.7. The passage which follows in the Kashi and Vidyäbhävan editions makes no sense, because the stanza “Ah merchant, how should we have ivory,’’ etc. (vämaa hatthidantà) is not an example of the kavinibaddhavaktrpraudhokti- mätranispanna variety but of the svatahsambhava variety of dhvani. What has happened is that some lines have dropped out. They are preserved, with a small lacuna, by the NS edition. After sariratvena navatvam it continues as follows: yathä usäara-viinna-jowana-hatthälambarn samunnamantehim / abbhutthänamm iva mammahassa dinnam tuha thanehim / / ” [cf. 2.24 A] asya cagäthasya ‘udihi... kaäbhoä (? ubbhinna-kuäbhoäj jaha jaha thanaâ vinanti bälänäm / taha taha laddhâvâso wa mammaho hiaam avisai / / ” etadgath- ärthena na paunaruktyam / yathä vâ.

Accordingly, the Vrttikära says, To explain th e sam e point. By “explain” he means, to set it forth with a substantiating argument. What he has in mind is that while the author of the Vrtti has stated it [viz., dhvani] to be the cause for the endlessness of meanings, the author of the Kärikäs has not [yet] done so.[Second interpretation.] Or rather, his intention is to quote a sum­mary stanza (sahgrahasloka). This will explain why there is no com­ment on the stanza in the Vrtti.Things th a t have been long seen: one may supply \"by external means of cognition such as perception,” or “by poets of the past.\" Poetry here acts the part of the month of spring.What charm can there possibly be in naming such things directly as yearning, shyness, longings of lovers?The examples [here given which contain dhvani] have been fully ex­plained previously. There is no point in repeating here their explana­tion. For the present passage of the Vrtti intends no more than to show that there is indeed a freshness [in these examples] thanks to the varieties of dhvani, even though the themes have been touched upon by older writers.[Abhinava gives a Sanskrit translation of the Prakrit verse, “My son, who once with a single shaft,” etc. He follows it by saying:] The meaning is obvious.

For all original poetry is achieved by a poet whose mind attends closely to a suggested sense consisting of a rasa, bhäva, or the false or improper correlate (äbhäsa) of one of these, and on the suggestors, as we have described them, 1 in the form of words, sentences, texture (rasanä), or complete works. And so it is that in such works as the Rämäyana and Makäbhärata the battle scenes, etc., although they occur repeatedly, always appear new. Furthermore, one primary rasa, being woven into a work, gives it special meaning and extra beauty. Do you ask for an example? As in the Rämäyana and the Makäbhärata.2In the Rämäyana the karunarasa (flavor of compassion or tragic mood) is prepared by the first of poets himself, where he says that his “grief became verse/ ’3 He carries out the same rasa throughout his composition up to Räma’s final, irreversible separation from Sîtâ.4Again, in the Makäbhärata, which has the form of a didactic work although it contains poetic beauty, the great sage who was its author, by his furnishing a conclusion that dismays our hearts by the miserable end of the Vrsnis and Pändavas, shows that the primary aim of his work"},{"pageNumber":706,"pageContent":"691has been to produce a disenchantment with the world and that he has intended his primary subject to be liberation (moksa) from worldly life and the rasa of peace. This has been partly revealed indeed by others in their commenting on the work. The most compassionate of sages [Bhlsma]5 himself asserts the same when he seeks, by imparting the light of his pure knowledge, to rescue the world from the cruel illusion in which it is plunged. He expresses it in many ways, as in the following:The more the world’s affairs go wrong for us and lose their substance, the more will disenchantment with them grow, there is no doubt.[Mahäbhärata 12.168.4]The ultimate meaning of\" the Mahäbhärata thus appears very clearly: the two subjects intended by the author as primary are the rasa of peace and the human, goal of liberation. The other rasas and other human goals are subordinated to these; and how there may be a rela­tion of principal and subordinate among the rasas is a matter we have already explained.6 It is no contradiction to this to concede that if we disregard the ultimate inner truth, there may be beauty in a subordi­nate rasa or human aim (in the Mahäbhärata] regarded for the moment as paramount, just as there is beauty in the body [although it is in truth subordinate to the soul].An objection may be raised that all the contents of the Mahäbhä­rata are summarized in the Introductory Summary (anvbramanï)T and that thesp subjects [moAsa and säntarasa] are not mentioned there. Rather, it is specifically stated in that Introduction8 that the Mahä­bhärata will inform us of all human aims and that it contains all the rasas. To this it may be replied. It is true that the predominance of the rasa of peace and the predominance of moksa over other human aims are not specifically stated in the Anukramani. But they are shown by suggestion, as in this sentence:And the blessed Väsudeva, the everl ting, is here glorified.[Mahäbhärata 1.1.193 ab]For the meaning intended to be hereby suggested is as follows. The adventures of the Pändavas and others which are here recounted, since they come to a miserable conclusion, represent the elaboration of world­ly illusion, whereas it is the blessed Väsudeva, representing ultimate truth, who is here glorified.9 Purify your minds, therefore, in blessed§ 4.5 A ]"},{"pageNumber":707,"pageContent":"God, the all-highest. Form no passion for insubstantial glories, nor let your minds dwell whole-heartedly on virtues such as statesman­ship, modesty, courage, or the like, so as to regard them as sufficient in themselves. 10 The word “and,” 11 graced with the full powers of a suggestor, appears clearly to be hinting that one should look farther [in the book] and see the worthlessness of all worldly life. The verses which immediately follow, “for He is the truth,” etc. [MBh. 1.1.193 c] are seen to reveal within themselves the same sense.This sense is beautiful because it is concealed. The poet-creator Krsnadvaipâyana has made it perfectly clear, however, by composing the Harivamsa as a conclusion to his Mahäbhärata. Since this sense stirs us toward an intense devotion (bhakti) to that other truth that lies beyond worldly life, all worldly activity appears now as a preliminary goal, to be rejected. He describes the power of gods, places of pilgrim­age, and of ascetecism, only because these are the means of attaining the highest Brahma, because the various gods and sacred objects are epiphanies12 of that Brahma. Even the narrative of the adventures of the Pändavas, since its purpose is to generate a disenchantment with the world, since this disenchantment is a cause of liberation (moksa), and since moksa has been described in the Gita and other works as the chief means of attaining the Blessed One: even this narrative is indirectly a means of attaining the highest BrahmaWhat is intended [by the word Väsudeva in the Mahäbhärata verse just quoted] is the highest Brahma, the abode of unlimited power, known under such designations as “Väsudeva” and made famous un­der that name in the Gitä and other passages; the original whole, 13 which possesses all the forms which were copied by the appearance at Mathura. But the appearance at Mathura, being a partial incar­nation, is not meant, as it is excluded by the adjective “everlasting.” And [there is no reason for limiting the epithet Väsudeva to the son of Vasudeva], because we find the epithet used in such works as the Rämäyana of a still different incarnation.14 Furthermore, this sense [of the epithet as referring to an eternal entity] has been determined by the grammarians themselves.15By that [one] sentence exhibited in the Anukramani, which shows that everything other than the Blessed One is transient, we are already informed that the Mahäbhärata as a work of docrine (sästranaye) con­siders the one supreme goal of mam to be moksa and as a work of poetry (kävyanaye) intends the rasa of peace, which is a strengthening of the happiness that derives from the cessation of desire, 16 to be the"},{"pageNumber":708,"pageContent":"693predominant rasa. As this matter is most essential, it is given by sug­gestion rather than by direct statement, for an essential matter carries far greater luster by not being stated in so many words. For it is com­mon knowledge among intelligent and well-educated circles that one should suggest rather than state in so many words the matter which one has most at heart. 17Accordingly, it is clear that in writing a poem one gains freshness and a large measure of beauty for the work by means of such factors as the predominant rasa. That is why we may see in literature a composition possessed of great beauty if it assembles its m atter in harmony with a rasa, even if it lacks any particular figures of speech. For example:Victorious is the great sage,the prince of yogis, born of a water jar,who in one cupped handfull sawthe Divine Fish and the Divine Tortoise. 18Here the vision of the fish and the tortoise in the palm of Agastya’s hand, being in conformity with the rasa of wonder, adds a great beauty to the stanza, for the vision of the divine fish and tortoise, being an original touch, is more in conformity with the rasa of wonder than the [suggested] presence of the whole ocean in one palm of his hand. For a matter that is trite through being known to everyone, though it may be a marvel, does not give us a sense of wonder. Nor need the mention of an original trait in harmony with the rasa be limited to the rasa of wonder. It may harmonize with other rasas. For example,Lucky man! Her side, which you accidentally touched as you brushed past her on the street, still perspires, bristles, trembles. 19From this stanza, as one thinks about it, there arises a perception in the highest degree of rasa, which would not appear at all from the mere fact, being perceived, that the lady after touching you perspires, bristles and trembles.We have thus described how a fresh color is given to the matter of poetry by use of the various types of predominant suggestion (dhvani). A freshness of the poetic matter may also arise from using a subor­dinated suggestion of any of the three kinds.20 But I have given no example of these in fear that my book would become too long.21 The sensitive reader can easily supply them for himself.§ 4.5 A J"},{"pageNumber":709,"pageContent":"6941. Viz., in 3.2 and 3.16. 2. (J. Masson) Änanda’s view is that whatmakes the battles, for example, seem original each time is not merely the use of dhvani in the descriptions, but also their subordination to a more general aesthetic goal. In the Mahäbhärata the more battles that are described, the more distasteful war becomes and the more firmly grounded becomes our feeling of detachment, of world weariness (vairägya). So in the case of the Rämäyana, the constant expressions of pain, sorrow, separation, all conduce to the overall end of the work, a feeling of kärunya. 3. Räm. 1.2.39; see also above, 1.5 K and note 1. 4. If the plot had admitted of an ultimatereunion, the roso would have been vipralambhasrngära-, see 2.5 c L. 5. Loka- nätha must here be used as an epithet of Bhlsma, who speaks the verse which follows to the grieving Yudhisthira. Normally the word is used of God, that is. of Brahma or Visnu, or by the Buddhists of the Buddha. But the MBh. itself uses the term once of Bhisma (9.2.30). In Änanda’s use of the epithet here, it may have been chosen for its alliterative effect. 6. Viz., in 3.20ff. 7. MBh. 1.1.65ff. The Anukramanï is doubtless a summmary of an earlier Mahäbhärata than the hundred-thousand-s'lofca version that we now possess. It refers to very little of Book 3 and to nothing after Book 11. As the Moksa- parva is in Book 12, it does not figure in the Anukramanï. 8. uddesa: the preliminary mention or listing of matters before they are discussed. 9. The same view of the MBh. is shared by Nïlakantha. See his remarks on Mbh. Vulgate 1.1.275, which he concludes by saying, “One should therefore elicit the substance from the whole book and leave the rest.”10. The sense is that these virtues are worthless if they are kevala, that is, alone, or independent of an effort to attain to God. There is a pause between rägino and gunesu that might be represented by a comma. 11. ca sabdah (Text 532, line 1) should be read together as a compound, meaning “the word ’and,”’ as used in the quotation just given from the MBh. 12. vibhütayah: The word “epiphany,\" as popularized by Mircea Eliade, denotes a place where the sacred appears or becomes sensible to the worshipper. In this sense the word is a more precise translation of vibhüti than “manifestation.” 13. OnlyK. Krishnamoorthy among editors has given the correct reading, which he takes from two BORI MSS. The word amsirüpam should be inserted between sakalasvarüpam and vivaksitam. By “the appearance at Mathurä\" is meant the incarnation as Krishna. Brahma is the amsin, the whole, whereas Krish­na, Rama, and other incarnations are amias, parts. 14. In Räm. 1.39.24 (Vulgate 1.40.25) “Väsudeva” is used as an epithet of Kapila. At the begin­ning of that chapter Visudeva is said to have incarnated himself in Kapila. 15. It is a bold move to appeal to the grammarians on this matter, for Pâmni explains such words as Väsudeva merely as patronymics; in this case, as the son of the sage Vasudeva of the Vrsni clan (Pan. 4.1.114). Abhinava supposes that Änanda is here referring to the Käsikä’s comment on that sütra, for he embodies a portion of that comment in his own remarks (see below under[ § 4.5 A"},{"pageNumber":710,"pageContent":"695L). “How,” asks the Kââikâ “can words which are eternal be assigned to a formation by reference to objects which are not eternal such as the family members of the Andhaka, [Vrsni, and Kuru] clans?” The first explanation of the Käsikä is this: “It so happens that a good many names like Nakula, Sahadeva [and Vasudeva] occurred somehow, merely by chance, in exactly that form among the Kuru, etc., clans. Panini included them in writing his grammar.” One might infer from this that the author of the Käsikä supposed the name “Vasudeva” to have once referred to an eternal entity before it was accidentally applied to a human. But I see no logical means of inferring from the Käsikä's remarks that “Vasudeva” also once referred to a non-human be­ing. How could it when the only etymology of the word given by the Käsikä or Panini is as “the son of Vasudeva”? To justify Änanda's view one needs a wholly different etymology of “Vasudeva,\" which one will find in religious texts (e.g., Visnuparäna 1.2.12), not in the grammarians. 16. The same phrase is used at 3.26 a A (Text p. 390), on which passage Abhinava makes it clear that trsnäksayasakha is the sthäyibhäva of éântarasa. 17. See J. Mas­son, “Telling not Conveying,\" JIP 1 (1973), 144-155. 18. The prince ofyogis to whom the stanza refers is Agastya, of whom many marvels are re­lated. He is called kumbhodbhava (born of a water jar) in accordance with a myth related in Brhaddevatä 5.149. At a sacrifice the gods Mitra and Varuna, upon seeing the beautiful nymph UrvasT, involuntarily ejaculated their semen, a part of which fell into a water jar, where it generated Agastya. The refer­ence in the second half of the stanza is to Agastya’s drinking up the ocean, which he is said to have done by his yogic powers in one sip from his cupped hands. He performed this miracle to help the gods, who sought to destroy the Käleya demons, who had been hiding at the bottom of the ocean. This myth is told in MBh. 3.100-103 (Bombay Vulgate 3.102-105) and is often referred )o by later poets. But the notion of Agastya’s having a vision of the two incarnations of Visnu, the fish and the tortoise, as he took the sea in his hands, is new. The former is that gigantic fish who rescued the earth from the deluge; the latter, the tortoise on whom the ocean rests. The verse is often quoted by later authors as an example of the figure of speech bhävikä (so by Ruyyaka, p. 228, and by Visvanätha, SD 10.94), but the older Älankärikas regard bhävikälankära as a figure applicable only to complete works, not to single stanzas. Änanda and Abhinava certainly do not see bhävikä in the stanza. Abhinava sees rasavadalankära (cf. 2.4 Introduction A and note 1), because the rasa of wonder is subordinate to Agastya’s love of Visnu. What is remarkable about the verse, however, and the occasion of Ananda’s here citing it, is that the freshness and charm is given to it by a direct statement (väcyo ’rthah) of the vision of the fish and tortoise, rather than by a suggested meaning, viz., that Agastya held the whole ocean in his palm. This is because the direct statement is both original and harmonious with the rasa, whereas the suggestion is trite (ksunna), as it can be found in a hundred other verses§ 4.5 A ]"},{"pageNumber":711,"pageContent":"about Agastya. 19. The verse is spoken by a lady’s confidante to a gen­tleman with whom the lady would have a rendezvous. Again, the suggested meaning that the lady has fallen in love with him is trite.

On the other hand, that element which consists in moksa should be considered the essence of the whole.3The m ore: The word lokatantram (the world’s affairs) [may be et­ymologically explained as] that which is set in order (tantryamäna) by people (loka), that is, carefully gathered, viz., dharma, artha, and käma, and the means of attai ing them.

This is what our author intends. In using the words intelligent and well- educated our author follows [the distinction he has made of] “a work of doctrine\" and “a work of poetry.”After this incidental discussion of the construction of the Mahäbhä- rata, he now summarizes the matter stated [above in the words of the Kârikâ], “The poet should concentrate his attention on that one type that achieves rasa”: Accordingly, it is clear, etc.T h at is why: because the matter is clearly established. That is why what we see in literature (viz., that the composition possesses great beauty if its material is in harmony with a rasa] is reasonable. Otherwise it would not be reasonable. And it is not unreasonable, be­cause we experience it as being beautiful; and the sole cause of this experience is that the material harmonizes with a rasa. This is the sense.

Änanda’s thesis has been thatrasa, the chief element of beauty in poetry, is achieved only by suggestion. The obj tor’s point is that it seems to go against that thesis to say that the beauty of a poem can be greatly increased by a literal meaning, not a suggested meaning, which harmonizes with the rosa. The answer is that if the suggestion is stale and trite, anything harmonious with the rasa which lifts the suggestion out of its triteness and gives freshness to the poem, will700 [ § 4.5 L"},{"pageNumber":716,"pageContent":"ro ibring about an increase of beauty. The importance of suggestion is not hereby abandoned, but is made less rigorous and exclusive. 14. (J. Masson) Abhi- nava’s point is that the suggested idea of the generosity of the king embel­lishes the literal sense by rationalizing it and thereby becomes subordinate to it. This is always the case in that kind of vyâjast'iti where the literal sense is a censure, eventually ending in a suggested compliment. 15. The second half of the stanza should read: atthä kivinagharatthä satthävatthä sti­vanti wa. Note that the stanza, when translated into Sanskrit, is metrically perfect: tyägijana-kara-paromparä-sancärana-kheda-nihsaha-torirä / arthäh krpana-grhasthäh svasthävasthäh svapantîva / / It would seem that the au­thor composed the stanza in Sanskrit and converted it only later into Prakrit. 16. As Abhinava says that the stanza is built on the same idea as the next stanza, the subject addressed must be a man and both rägavrddhaye and viraktaye must refer to that man’s reactions. As BP says, “these are the words of someone addressed to a friend. 17. Àksepa here means “hint of a simile,\" as Abhinava has explained in 1.13e L (see note 2 thereon). The simile is,. that just as the color of his hair might have influenced the man in youth, so ought it to influence him now. The figure vibhävanä is the imagining of an effect as existing without a cause: see Bhämaha 2.77, Dandin 2.199, AlSaru. p. 157, SD 10.66 and 67. Dandin’s definition is “Wher­ever in the absence of a well-known cause we must imagine some other cause, or imagine that the thing is self-caused, we have the figure vibhävanä.\" To apply the definition to the present verse: The man continues to be eager for love, although the normal causes of this affection, youth and a hand­some appearance, are absent. So we are forced to imagine another cause, viz., that which is explicitly stated in the “old verse\" which follows: men are even more subject to vice in their old age than they are in their youth. 18. kälabhujagak the snake which is death, or the black snake, i.e., cobra. sivopäya: the means to his welfare, but Abhinava uses upaya regularly to mean a path to moksa; see the chapter headings of his Tanträloka. The literal sense of the stanza must be close to that of the “old verse\" quoted below. It is simply that a man (representing most men) does not prepare himself for death when it draws near. This sense is here embellished by the fancy that the snake of Death is already on the man’s head; the white hairs are the snake’s venom. That the man pays no heed even under such circum­stances suggests the rasa of wonder. The final words, or as we should say, the punch line, is ironical. J. Masson says of himself that “he feels that the older verses [quoted in this section] are more virile than Abhinava’s. which strike him as too self conscious and overly written. He has the impression that Abhinava might have written these verse expressly for the occasion of illustrating his thesis.” The impression may well reflect the truth, but on the value judgment V. P. and D. I. disagree. The “old verses\" are like a hun­dred others in the Cänakya collections and in the 12th Book of the MBh.§ 4.5 L \\"},{"pageNumber":717,"pageContent":"They become tedious.

For in the absence of that, there can be no subject matter whatsoever of poetry. Even beauty of style ( bandhacchäyä), which is the employment of words ap­propriate to the two meanings [viz., dhvani and subordinated sugges­tion], is impossible if there is no imagination in regard to the meanings. To suppose that beauty of style can consist in the choice of sounds with­out regard to any particular meaning is to suppose something in no way close to [the view of] sensitive readers. For at this rate the stringing together of words that are clever and sweet regardless of sense must be called poetry. If it is asked1 how such a composition could be called po­etry at all in view of the fact that poetry is defined as the combination of words and meanings, we would remark that just as a composition built on the subject matter of another poet is called the poetry of that [other poet, regardless of the words which it contains],2 so would a con­struction of poetry of this sort (viz., with a novel arrangement of words regardless of meaning, also be called poetry].1. The question is the natural reaction of a reader to the exaggeration of the preceding sentence. It is answered by explaining the exaggeration as an extended or metaphorical use of the word poetry. 2. Note that the pronoun tat in tatkävyatva must refer to the para in paropanibaddha-, so L, BP, and Badarinäth Sarmä.

A kâyya (poem) is that which is spoken (hu + suffix nyat)\\ kâvyatva (poetry) is the abstract noun derived from that (kâvya + tva). Thus there is no fault here of appending an abstract suffix to an abstract suflix.31. Päka or paripäka refers to the choice of the mot juste.

For the nature of the things directly expressed, whether they are sentient or insentient, becomes endless from differences in state, differences in place, differences in time, and differences in individuality (svälaksanya). By making these objects, varied in this way, into the subjects of a poem, even if it is a svabkävokti (naturalistic description) 1 which portrays faithfully their many well known characteristics, the matter of the poem becomes limitless.As an example of endless poetry achieved by a difference of state, we have the goddess PärvatT in the Kumämsambhava. The first description of her ends with the stanza (1.49) usarvopam,ädmr/yasamv,ccayena.n [The complete stanza runs:The creator used painstaking care, setting in place each ideal form, as though in making her he had wished to s all beauty gathered in one person.)"},{"pageNumber":720,"pageContent":"705Next, as she approaches the eyes of £iva, she is described in a different way as the assistant of the God of Love, wearing “jewelry of springtime flowers” (3.53).

Such an object appears entirely different when treated by joining it to the form belonging to the appropriate sentient being. As in the Kumärasambhava again, the Himalaya is [first] described in its form as a mountain (Kum.Sam. l.lff); then, in the complimentary addresses of the seven sages (6.66ff.), when its sentient form is shown, it appears entirely new. This is a well known procedure of great poets and this path has been described in det 1 for the instruction of poets in the Visamabànalïlâ.1. See 2.4 L, note 33. Änanda seems to be using the term here of a stanza lacking both figures of speech and dhvani. But Abhinava will not agree to this. As for the svabhävokti stanzas of the anthologies, some of them cany dhvani and some do not. See SRK, Section 35, translated in HOS Voi. 45.2. Probably one should drop the negative a from apunaruktatvena and readvänavanava together. Krishnamoorthy notes two MSS which add a na before pratibhäsate, which would have the same effect.

After all, the point is that one can write endlessly about a single person if one makes use of different avasthäs, etc. 3. See Introduction, p. 10.[ § 4.7 AL In o rd er to convey: one should supply “incidentally.” Or, if our author’s intention is that the literal is merely auxiliary to the various suggested meanings and that by force of its being endless the suggested meanings become endless, this [conveyed information] may be pertinent. 1Taken by itself: the intention is, that it is endless in itself without any touch of that process by which it becomes subject to the suggested meaning; but that afterwards, while being endless in its own nature, it manifests the suggested meaning. To suppose that the suggested is not in play at all would rob the result of the name of poetry, for it would lack that which is the soul of poetry. And so it is that in the examples [about to be adduced] there does exist rasadhvani.Our author specifies what is meant by “etcetera” in the Kärikä: Dif­ference in individuality; that is, in the particular nature of the thing, as color and touch [which may be individually differentiated although occurring] in the same degree of intensity in one substance at one and the same time.2[Abhinava translates the Prakrit stanza, ‘T he w in n in g gestures,” etc., into Sanskrit, then continues:] The use of the two particles ca sug­gests extreme wonder.3 In any way: Being considered with the great­est care, no trace of repetition is observable. Of loved wom en: One like Krishna who is lucky in love, even in enjoying his many beloveds in his good fortune of sexual enjoyment, does not notice any repetitious­ness at that time. As has been said:To be at each moment ever new is the very nature of loveliness.(Mägha, Sisvpälavadha 4.17]Loved wom en: What is more, although these graceful gestures (vi- bhrama)4 of beloved women have been exercised since the beginning of time, they appear ever new.. They are not a ritual taught by some one, like the laying of a Vedic fire, by which they might become repetitive from imitation of the teacher.

Even within a single state of sentient beings many subsidiary states can be distinguished: as, of young girls there are those whose heart has been pierced by the God of Love and there are others; and even among these there'are those who are nice and proper (wnita) and those who are not. And among insentient things the individuality of each different stage from origin onward, if described in a poem, will produce endless variety. For example:These buds, which being swallowed by the wild geese, in rolling down their sweetened throats, produce a new and limpid beauty in their cry, are pushing up now from the lotus bulbs like tender tusks of young she-elephants.[Kamaläyudha]1One may follow the line thus indicated in treating of other [objects] also. Variety of insentient things, to begin with, is well known to arise from differences of place, as of winds that travel over different countries and regions; of other objects too, such as waters and flowers. Among"},{"pageNumber":723,"pageContent":"sentient beings, such as men, animals, birds, there is obviously a great difference between those who have been raised in villages, forests, rivers, or the like. If one makes these distinctions in writing of them, one will find an endless store of material. Thus, to take only humans, who could ever exhaust the manifold variety of customs and activities of persons from different countries and regions, especially of young women? All this is material for the composition of a good poet according to his genius.There is a variety also from differences of time, as of insentient things such as the horizons and heavens and rivers, from the various seasons; while of sentient beings it is well known that such emotions as the yearning of lovers2 depend upon the time of year. And it is obvious that there can be a different description [in poetry] of everything on earth according to its individuality. These matters, if only they are brought into one’s composition each as it truly is, will lead to an endless stock of material.On this point there are those who might object. The facts of the world, they might say, come into denotation in their general, not their particular, forms. For poets superimpose those states of mind like hap­piness which they themselves have experienced, as well as the causes of these states, upon others, and in this way bring the facts of the world into their works only by recourse to that form of the facts which is common to the experience both of the poet himself and of others. They are not, like yogis, able to perceive such things as the thought of others3 in the past, present and future. Furthermore, the general form of intelligible experience, which is common to all readers, is limited in extent and has been already surveyed by the ancients, for it is impossi­ble that it should not have fallen within their range. Accordingly, the particular variety of facts which is taken by modern poets as [offering them scope for] originality is a delusion on their part. The only variety lies in the manner of speech ( bhaniti). 11. I have corrected my translation from that which I gave in SRK 284, where this stanza appears, attributed to the poet Kamaläyudha. There are three words “kasäya\" in Sanskrit with the distinct meanings of “red,” “as­tringent,” and “sediment or impurity.” It is the first of these that the poets make use of; and since rakta (“red”) also means passionate, kasäya extends its meaning in the same way. Sweet-voiced birds are called kasäyakantha (Kum- Sam. 3.32, Mälatimädhava 7.1 +30, and the stanza here quoted), whatever color their throat may be. The throat of the grey goose (kalahamsa, either Anser anser or Anser cinerareits), of whom the term is here used, is grey708 [ § 4.7 a A"},{"pageNumber":724,"pageContent":"709or blue-grey, not red. In the compound kasäyakantha commentators often gloss kasäya as madhura (sweet) or manohara (charming) and the compound is indeed about equivalent to “sweet-throated.” As for the elephant tusks, those of the females are whiter than the tusks of the bulls. On a young fe­male elephant they might well look like lotus shoots. The stanza is quoted by Kuntaka as an example of delightful charm ( Vakrokti 1.23.73). There is a prose passage closely resembling our stanza in Qhavabhüti's Mälatimädhava (7.1 +30). As Kamaläyudha, apparently the teacher of Vâkpatirâja, should be placed in the late seventh century, Bhavabhüti (early eighth century) would seem to be the borrower. The passage runs: kavaliaäravindakesarakasäa- kanthakalaharnsaghosaghaggarakkhaliagambhïrabhâradï, “a deep voice, limpid and stuttering as the voice of kalahamsas whose throats are kasäya from the filaments of aravinda lotuses which they have swallowed.\" Bhavabhüti doubt­less intended to give kasäya a double meaning here, for the aravinda lotus is red. The birds will have acquired their kasäya (passionate, sweet) voices from the kasäya (red) flowers. 2. In the descriptions of Sanskrit poetry long­ing increases during the rains, whereas, as with us, new love blossoms in the spring. 3. We follow here the reading of the KM edition, paracittädi.

The verse is 1.92 of Gnoli’s edition of the Pramänavärttikä, 3.91 of the edition with Manoratha’s commentary. The identification of the quotation was first pointed out by Gnoli, The Aesthetic Experience, p. xxxii. The probative force of the stanza rests on the Buddhist doctrine of the momentariness of all things. From this it follows that anything which we experience has ceased before we can verbalize it. We can only verbalize its general aspect (sämänya), which does not really belong to the particular but is superimposed on it by our mind.A To this we would reply. *'If poetry relies on general traits only, what of the varieties of poetry shown, arising from [the description of] particular states, etc.? Must we say they are simply repetition? And if not, then how should there not be endlessness in poetry?* It is wrong to say that poetry relies on general traits only, and that, since these are of limited extent and have therefore been employed by the ancients, there can be no originality of poetic material. For if poetry relied on general traits only, how should we explain the profusion of poetic material in the works of the great poets, or how ascribe the name of poet to any one other than Välmlki, as there would be no poetic material other than general traits and these would have been revealed by the very first poet? If you would remove this difficulty by [reference to] the variety of expression (ukti), we would ask just what this variety of expression is. For expression is the speaking of words which convey the particulars of a meaning to be denoted. If the expression has variety, how should the denoted meanings not have variety also, for there is invariable concomitance between denoter and denoted? 2 The form in which the denoted senses appear in a poem is taken to be identical with the particulars of the external thing. Accordingly, he who speaks of variety of expression will be forced even against his will to accept a variety of denoted meanings also. The m atter is summarized as follows.If it is admitted that one poet at least besides Välmlki possessed imagination, then the endlessness of poetic matter is safe.3"},{"pageNumber":726,"pageContent":"711What is more, the statement that variety of expression is a condition (nibandhana) of poetic novelty is quite in accordance with our view, for all the modes [of existence], which we showed above to be the cause of endlessness in poetic material, again become doubled through variety of expression. The well-known figures of speech, classified as [figures of sense] such as simile and [figures of sound] such as double meaning, being themselves li itless, multiply [the material] a hundredfold when they are brought into a poem through variety of expression.Furthermore, an expression framed in a different language may bring about a further endlessness of poetic material, as caused by the variety of meaning currrent in the respective language. An example is a verse of mine:§ 4.7b A )A man spends all his ti saying “mahumahu” ; and yet the god Krishna never occurs to his mind.41. The passage between asterisks translates the following words.

This passage is found in the KM edition, is reported by BP as oc­curring in this position in “a certain text\" (kvacid granthe), and is necessary to furnish the pratikas, viz., kim iti and na ced iti in Abhinava’s commentary. It could easily have fallen out by haplography, the scribe’s eye jumping from the first occurrence of sämänyamäträsrayena to the second. On the other hand, it is difficult to imagine why it should have been added. 2. That is, between linguistic expression and thought. 3. The Kashi reading aksayam must be changed to the KM reading aksatam. To say that “endlessness is in- exhaustable\" (ânantyam aksayam) would be inexcusable tautology. 4. The stanza, which is corrupt in the printed editions and MSS, is composed in the Apabhramsa or, as Abhinava calls it, SindhI language, in which mahn means \"mine.” Abhinava also tells us that the expression Mahumahu [in the same language] may mean Madhumathana, an epithet of Krishna. The point of the verse depends on the double meaning. A man may have the name of God ever on his lips, but if he is filled with selfishness and attachment to wealth (ever saying, “mine, mine”), God is not in his heart. The verse has been much discussed; see Jacobi’s note and Krishnamoorthy’s note ad loc. Without pretending to a knowledge of Apabhramsa or Sindhî, I propose al­tering slightly Pischel’s emendation (Die Prakrit Sprachen, para. 14. note 2) to produce a rhymed stanza in the form of 14-12-14-12 mätras, as follows.

That a partic­ular instance of this (universal, etc.] is understood from a sentence is a matter on which no one disagrees. In all theories of sentence mean­ing, e.g., the anvitäbhidhänaväda, its opposite (viz., the abhihitänvaya- vâda),2 the samsarga theory,3 or the apoha theory, there is never a denial that a particular (is what is finally understood]. Furthermore, it has been shown that variety of expression is not caused by the mere use of synonyms. As for variety of expression caused otherwise, it serves to further our thesis. Our author says this in the passage: W h at is m ore.Again [become doubled]: furthermore4 (become doubled]. For simile becomes varied by such expressions as nibha (in likeness of), pratim a (being an image of), chala (in the guise of) pratibimba (being a reflection of), praticchâya (mirroring), tulya (equivalent to), sadrsa (similar to), äbhäsa (appearing to be), because there exists a real differ­ence of meaning underlying these expressions. One should say that the word nibha is properly used in connection with an appearance (bhäna), the word pratim a where thére is an imitation, and so on in each case. To regard these words as synonyms is an error which arises from the mischief of reading commentaries on poetry that are useful only for the young. This is the intention. In this way an endlessness of matter and an endlessness of figures of speech arises from variation of expression."},{"pageNumber":728,"pageContent":"713Our author now shows how this [endlessness] may arise [from var­ied expression] in another way. The word pratiniyatabhäsägocarärtha- vaicitryanibandhanam is [a bahuvrihi compound] to be analysed as “of which, sc., endlessness of figures of speech and of poetic material, the nibandkana, that is, the cause, is a variety (uaicitrya) brought about by the meaning (artha) current in (gocara) the respective language (pratiniyatabhäsä).n The construction of the sentence is, “A variety of expression (grammatical subject) brings about that endlessness (gram­matical object).” The cause is set forth by that [bahuvrihi compound] which qualifies the grammatical object.(Abhinava translates the Apabhramsa stanza A m an spends all his tim e, etc., thus:]Mama mama iti bhanato vrajati kälo janasya /tathäpi na devo Janàrdano gocaro bhavati manasah //How should God not be present to the mind of one who constantly says “Madhumathana” (a name of Krishna)? This seems to be a con­tradiction. [The puzzle] is solved by the expression “mahumahu\" in the SindhI language [which means both Madhumathana and “mine, mine”]. 1 2 * 41. Samaya is the convention which binds a given word to a given mean­ing. The schools of philosophy differed as to the nature of the meaning in this dyadic relation. The Mlmämsakas, as a result of believing the words of the Veda to be eternal, held that the meaning with which a word is connected, is likewise eternal. It is therefore a universal (sämänya), not a transient partic­ular. The older Naiyäyikas held that the meaning is a particular as possessed of a universal, for if told to “bring cow” (Sanskrit has no definite article), a boy brings a particular cow, not the universal, bovinity. The Buddhist ideal­ists held that the meaning of a word is an apoha, for what is meant by such a word as “cow” is simply the denial of all things which are not a cow. All these schools agreed, however, that the meaning of a sentence, as opposed to that of a word, is a particular. Again, they differed in their analysis of the particular, the Mlmämsakas, for example, regarding it as an action or state qualified by nominal conditions, the Naiyäyikas as a nominal subject qualified by an action, etc. But these arguments do not affect the point here at issue.2. For the anvitäbhidhänaväda of Prabhâkara and the abhihitänvayaväda of Kumärila, see 1.4 b L, notes 3 and 30. 3. This refers to the Nyäya theory,according to which sentence meanings are analysed as particular relations. Thus, ‘The pot is on the ground” is analysed as “[There exists] a relation of conjunction of which the pratiyogin is pot and the anuyogin is ground.”4.

But a poet need not avoid the third type of poetic material, if it has a separate body which is beautiful, merely because it agrees [with other poetic material). You cannot say that a person is the same because he happens to resemble another person. The next Kärikä is spoken in order to explain this.[ § 4.13 AL [Abhinava quotes the entire Kärikä and adds:] O f its own: That which owes its soul or nature to a poem of prior composition has no soul of its own. The form by which it assumes beauty was conceived by a previous poet, so that it is simply an image of that form. As to what it is in itself, our author says, it lacks any real substance. For nothing new has been imagined here by the later poet; it is just like the reflection in a mirror.Having thus explained the first type, he goes on to explain the second: T he next type, etc.: that is. the second. [The word anyasämya is a bahuvnhi compound, meaning literally] “which bears a similarity to another.” Its soul is w orthless: In an imitation we are aware only of what is imitated, as in a painting or a manuscript. There is no conscious awareness of the minium and other paints [in which it actually consists]. And this [awareness] too [i.e., like our awareness of the first type] does not lead to our prizing it.1In o rder to explain this: viz., that one need not avoid the third type.1. Abhinava, like Änanda, is here considering a painting only as a repre­sentation, not as a source of aesthetic pleasure in itself. One could argue that in viewing a great painting we are aware of the material itself as well as of what it represents. But such a painting would not be purely representational.K The poetic material, if it has a soul of its own, even if it follows a previous prescription, will shine all the more, as does the face of a damsel which resembles the moon."},{"pageNumber":734,"pageContent":"§ 4.15 K }A The poetic material, if it has an essential substance, a soul, of its own, even though it follows a previous pattern, will shine all the more.

Nor will it appear to be repetitious, any more than the face of a damsel which resembles the moon.L (Abhinava quotes the entire Kârikâ and adds:] The Kärikä is broken up and quoted section by section in the Vrtti\\ but in some man­uscripts the Kârikâs appear in unbroken form. 1 Our author explains the word “soul” by the words “essential substance” which he prefixes to it.1. As regards the present Kârikâ, all the pri tions and the MSSof which we have record are of this second type.A Thus the lines have been drawn between [the different types of] similar sentence meanings, which are meanings of compound struc­ture. The next Kârikâ is stated in order to show that poetic material in the form of word meanings [of uncompounded structure] are not at fault from being similar to other material.K Where an old arrangement of [word] meanings1 is used, just as where an [old] arrangement of syllables, etc., is used, there is obviously no fault if new poetic material appears."},{"pageNumber":735,"pageContent":"720[ § 4.15 K1.

By metaphor and by a series of double meanings Änanda likens poetry to the garden of Indra’s heaven, and likens dhvani to the wishing tree of that garden from which the elect may pluck all objects of their desire. The double meanings will be pointed out by Abhinava. Note that the long compound in the first pâda ending in bhrto is ablative in agreement with yasmât. Yasmät surely refers forward to kävyäkhye udyàne, as Abhinava takes it, not to dhvani. Not only would the latter construction be extrmely awkward, but dhvani cannot be said to be gunäiankärasobhäbhrt. 2. The Kashi text here prints dhvanyäloke. AU but one of the recorded manuscripts, however, read sahrdayäloke. The one exception reads sahrdayälokanämni kâvyâlankàre.

[As it bears a w ealth o f qualities, etc.:] that is to say, as poetry, which has a wealth of qualities and figures of speech which are appropriate to a dwelling place of unblemished rasa. Also [in the literal sense] a garden bears a wealth of beauty by the rendering perfect (alankära) of such qualities as delicacy, color and fragrance, a perfection due to its being a recipient of timely (aklista) moisture (rasa) occasioned by irrigation, etc. From which: that is, from the garden that bears the name of poetry.

T he hom e of pure delight: the dhäman, that is, the one center, of unbroken (akhila) delight, that is, delight uninterrupted by any touch of pain.

A garden of the gods: Nandana. “The deserving” [in another sense] refers to those who have performed such ceremonies as the Jyotistoma by which they attain their reward [in heaven].

Its literal analysis is: [d/ivoni] of which there is a glory (m ahim ä) of a sort of which a likeness is only with the wishing tree. For the attainment of everything one desires in poetry depends on it [viz., dhvani]. This too we have (previously] stated in detail.[The right path: Abhinava quotes the first three quarters of the stanza and then adds:] In these lines the connection, the nature of the book, and the purpose,2 are summarized.In this world a person usually takes up a matter only if he believes in a possibility [of success], a belief brought about by the reputation in the world [of his informant or teacher]. Now this confidence in such a possibility arises from his hearing the name [of his informant] and his consequent memory of the qualities for which the informant was well known: his conduct, his knowledge of poetry, etc. For example, suppose a man understands the following. “This book was written by Bhartrhari. This metrical composition is the work of a man of whom there was this [well-known] nobility of character and of whom there is seen to be such a proficiency in this science [of grammar]3 Accordingly, it deserves respect.” Such a man will be seen to take up [the study of that book]. Now people must be brought to take up [the study of a book] if the purpose which it proposes is to be achieved. So the authors of books mention their names as part of an effort to bring their audience, whom they would help, to take up the book. It is with this intention that our author gives his name, Ä nandavardhana. The word “far-famed” conveys just this: that while the hearing of his name may turn some readers away, that may be ascribed to the working of their jealousy and is a matter of no account. For on hearing that the purpose of a book is salvation, if some man of passion should turn away from it, what of it? We certainly cannot say that the purpose of the book has been rendered void. So it stands proved that a famous name is part of winning over those who are seeking [the goal which an author has to offer].

The reference is to Bhatrhari’s Vâkyapadïya. 4. See 1.19 L, note 5. The fourth power (turyä sakti) of God is that by which the world becomes sensible and perceptible.

I am not sure how to take the first quarter. The name Siddhicela occurs nowhere else to my knowledge. De ( '‘The Text of Kavyäloka-Locana iv”) records a variant reading, èri Mantrisiddhi, likewise unknown. Both names may be corruptions. Furthermore, one might construe the compound to refer to Abhinava “who was perfumed by the pollen, etc., and by the mind, etc.,” so that we cannot be sure whether the obscure, or corrupted, name refers to a teacher of Abhinava or to his teachèr's teacher. In the third quarter, the reading of the Kashi text, väkya, seems to me preferable to De's read­ing, kävya, because the terms väkyapramänapadavedi agree with the terms which Abhinava has already used in referring to these groups of scholars; see 3.33 m L, where Mïmàmsakas were called väkyavidah, Grammarians pada- vidah, and Naiyäyikas pramänatattvavidah. One must take De’s reading guru (in compound) in place of Kashi’s guruh. 7. The colophon of the Fourth Chapter differs from those of the first three in naming the commented text Kävyäloka instead of Sahrdayäloka and in omitting âcaryavarya (the best of teachers) from Abhinava’s titles. This bespeaks a separate manuscript tra­dition and indeed almost all manuscripts of the first three chapters lack the fourth.§ Conclusion L ] 727"},{"pageNumber":744,"pageContent":"A B B R E V IA T IO N S A N D W O R K S C IT E DCORRECTIONS OF THE KASHI TEXTINDEX OF FIRST LINES (TRANSLATIONS)PRATlKA INDEX OF VERSES (ORIGINAL TEXT)GENERAL INDEX"},{"pageNumber":746,"pageContent":"A B B R E V IA T IO N S A N D W O R K S C IT E DWhere the names of books have been abbreviated in the translation and notes they are here listed under those abbreviations.

The index includes poetic passages from the prose kävyas, but does not include passages of prose dialogue from the Sanskrit plays. The Kärikä verses of the Dhvanyâloka have been excluded, as have the more prosaic of the expository verses from the treatises on poetics, such as those that merely state a definition of a figure of speech.For each entry the opening words of the original text are supplied in paren­theses. Numbers in bold type refer to pages on which the translation of the verse appears; other numbers refer to further pages on which the verse is discussed or referred to.Readers seeking verses remembered in their original language should first consult the PratTka Index of Verses, which provides cross-references to the corresponding entries in this index.A fool will take a poem that has no content, (yasminn asti na vastu) 0 1, 62-63.A jewel placed against the whetstone, (manih iSnollidhah) 146.A man spends all his time (mahumahu itti bhanantaahu) 711, 713.A scoundrel aims at his own interest, (yad vancanähitamatir) 468, 469.A timid deer ran about among the tents, (träsäkulah paripatan) 343,345.

Technical terms are given in both Sanskrit and En­glish with cross-references from one to the other. Page references are usually listed only under the Sanskrit term.A mere list of all occurrences of such a term as dhvani or rasa would be of little use, as nearly half the pages of the book would be listed under each term. Accordingly, I have tried to analyse by inset headings under such a term the types and varieties of the concept which it denotes and the content of statements made concerning it.The abbreviation “n” following a page number refers to a note on that page; u(q)” following a page number means that the author or work named in the entry is quoted on that page. The abbreviation “q.v.” after a word means that one will find further information and page references under that word.Note that in the transliteration of Sanskrit words nasals are assimilated within a single word, wherever permitted, to the following letter. Thus, for example, one should look for Sankara, sanjnd, sandhi, not Samkara, samjhä, samdhi.ö, according to Abhinava used in Pra­krit in the sense of tâvat, 102. aberration, see tnrûpa. äbhäsa (imitation), 217.

The simpl t system (80, 81, 82 nl. 94 nil.175, 643, 693) divides it into three types: vaatudhvani, q.v.; alankära- dhvani, q.v.; and msadhvani, q.v. The logical system (359- 360) has a view to intention and process and is far more complex. There are two main types (14-15, 212): avivaksitaväcya, q.v., and vivaksitänyaparaväcya q.v. The first of these is divided into the two varieties atyantatimskrtaväcya, q.v., and arthäntanuahkramita- vàcya, q.v. The second main type is also divided into two varieties (15, 212, 214): aaamlaksyakrama- dhvani, q.v. (= rasadhvani, q.v.) and samlakayakramadhvani, q.v. This last variety is divided into two sub-varieties (291): sabdaéakti- mülâ, q.v., and arthaéaktimüla, q.v. In one passage (318) a third sub-variety is added: sabdärtha- éaktimüla. q.v. The sub-variety arthaéaktimüla is further divided(321) into praudhoktimâtrania- pannaéarira, q.v., itself of two sorts (322), and svatahaambhavin, q.v. All these varieties may be multiplied by reference to the suggestor element (word, sentence, etc.) and by other elements with which the suggestion may be associated or fused.
