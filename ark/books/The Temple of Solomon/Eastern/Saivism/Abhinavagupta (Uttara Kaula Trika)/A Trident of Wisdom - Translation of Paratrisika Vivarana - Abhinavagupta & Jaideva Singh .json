Indeed, it is no exaggeration to state that the present translation of Abhinavagupta’s Pardtrimsika-vivarana (PTv) repre­sents both a landmark and a new staging point for the invesu- gation of the Hindu Tantra. This translation of the PTv brings to light a treasure-laden text such as the romantic imagination of visionaries and scholars have sought in India for centuries. Composed as one of the first major works of Abhinavagupta (ca. 975-1025 CE), preceded perhaps only by the Malini-vijaya-vdrtika (MVv), it is written in die difficult but elegant style of the great tantric Saiva master of Kashmir. In this text Abhinavagupta addresses himself to advanced disciples as well as to those who have already achieved liberation.After the demise of the Trika as a lineage in Kashmir in die late thirteenth century, due in large measure to the invasion of Islam, a few rare manuscripts of this important and complex text miraculously survived, copied and recopied by scribes who prob­ably little understood it. Then, almost a millenium after its composition, it emerged in 1918 as one of the early publications of the Kashmir Series of Texts and Studies. Now, some seventy years after the publicauon of the Sanskrit text, the PTv is made available to the larger public. It is indeed curious and significant that three translations of this text should be published indepen- dendy within several years of each other, the present one into English, one by Raniero Gnoli into Italian in 1985, and one by Nllakantha Gurutii into Hindi.The present translation by Thakur Jaideva Singh represents the culmination of a life-work dedicated to making available the central texts of the non-dual Kashmir Shaiva tradiuons. Already in 1963 Singh published a translauon with notes and com­mentary of Ksemaraja’s Pratyabhijnahrdayam, followed in 1979 by an annotated rendering of the Vijndnabhairava, also in 1979 the $iva-sutra-s, and in 1980 the Spanda-karika-s. Indeed, one couldix"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"XPara-Trisika-Vtvaranasay that the current vogue and apparent popularity of Kashmir Shaivism is due in large measure to these publications which have made the foundational texts of the tradition available to a wider public.Nevertheless, in undertaking a translation of the PTv, Singh took on a task of considerably greater magnitude and difficulty than these previous publications. Not only was he attempting a work by Abhinavagupta, an author whose Sanskrit is conceded to be very difficult, but he was taking on what many scholars agree is perhaps his most complex and difficult work. The PTv is the repository of some of the most advanced and abstruse formula­tions of the non-dual Shaivism of Kashmir.It is indeed a pity that Singh did not live to see this final work published, because he succeeded quite remarkably in the task he undertook. In this book, Singh presents us with a readable and lively rendition of the text. Aided by Swami Laksmanjee, who is the only living, modem representative of the tradition, Singh comments liberally on the meaning of the text in very helpful notes and expositions. In addition, he has illustrated complex doctrinal schemes with the help of ten charts. The book includes a corrected version of the Sanskrit text as well as several useful indices. Clearly, Singh went to great lengths to facilitate the readers understanding of the textAs this and other tantric texts of the tradition become available for scholarly investigation, a crucial chapter in the religious history of India is slowly being recaptured, one that is pre­cipitating a new understanding of the development of the Tantra. In the person of Abhinavagupta we find one of the earliest and most articulate figures in the synthesis of the Hindu Tantra. He is usually counted as being the most illustrious representative of the tradition rather imprecisely referred to as ‘Kashmir Shaivism*. This m isleading term refers to several related lineages of Northern Shaiva masters which include Vasugupta (ca. 9th cent) transmitter of the foundational text known as the Siva-sutra-s; his disciple Kallaut, to whom are usually attributed the important Spanda-karika-s; Somananda, also ninth century, author of the influential text known as the §iva-drsti, and his disciple Utpalacarya, author of what has come to be recognized as the foundational text for the philosophical explication of the tradi-"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Forewordxidon, the Isvara-pratyabhijnd-karika-s.In addition to these important intellectual and spiritual for­bears, the tradition which Abhinavagupta inherits and comes eventually to synthesize includes powerful influences from a large number of celebrated agama-s and tantra-s. Abhinavagupta studied these revealed texts with several teachers, and finally achieved liberation under die guidance of a Kaula master from outside of Kashmir known as Sambhunatha. Certainly, all subse­quent Saivite and Sakta authors, including those of the important Srividya lineage, were profoundly influenced by Abhinavagupta’s early and precise formulations.It is a curious fact that, given Abhinavagupta’s importance in the development of the Hindu Tantra, he has until now been better known as an aesthetic theoretician or even as a Saiva philosopher. This has been due in large measure to the unavail­ability of translauons of his tantric texts, and of suitable inter­preters of the teachings he sets forth in them. By bringing to light Abhinavagupta’s tantric teachings which contain his central religious and spiritual vision, this translation of the PTv serves an important purpose. Here Abhinavagupta expounds the esoteric, inner teachings of die Trika-Kaula lineage, teachings whose enure purpose was the enlightenment and liberauon of disciples.In the commentary to verse 1 (p. 18, below), Abhinavagupta declares that the purpose (prayojana) of the PTv is jivanmukti, the achievement of liberauon while sdll alive. Abhinavagupta tells us that the primary characterisuc or power of Siva is his freedom (svatantrya). In his freedom, Siva mediates and transcends all opposites and polarities. Through the pracuce of absorpdve mediauon (samavesa), the pracuuoner finally achieves the highest spiritual posture which consists of the extroverdve or open-eyed trance (unmilana-samadhi). Here the jivanmukta achieves the freedom of Siva as the experience of unified percepdon (ekarasa), the blissful and unitary vision of the all-pervasiveness of the Ultimate. For the thus liberated one, all of the usually con­straining polarides—inner and outer, life and death, pure and impure, good and evil—no longer hold. In the direct percepuon (anubhava) of the Supreme in the Heart, the sadhaka or pracu­uoner becomes a siddha, a perfected one who wields the power of the Embodied Cosmos, the kauliki-siddhi."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"xiiPara-Trisika-VwaranaIn the same passage, Abhinavagupta tells us that the subject matter (abhidheya) of the PTv is the Supreme Power, the blissfully self-referential Self, the AHAM, the unimpeded and totally free consciousness of §iva. Consonant with this emphasis on the Supreme consciousness is Abhinavagupta’s focus on interioriza- tion, and on the interpretation of all ritual actions in terms of inner transformations of consciousness. Indeed, the keynote of the PTv, as of the entire non-dual Kashmir Shaiva tradition, is the freedom of this highest consciousness.Despite the differences of emphasis that characterize the other tantric texts of Abhinavagupta, the PTv forms an almost seamless thematic web with them. These include the monumental 7an- traloka (TA); its shorter summary, the Tantrasara (TS); the shorter commentary on the Pardtrimsika, the Paratrisika-laghuvrtti (PTlv); and the incomplete comment on the Malinivijayottara Tantra (MVT), the Malini-vijaya-vartika. In these texts, Abhinavagupta poured out the most potent distillation of his teachings on the Tantra. With enormous skill and dexterity, he applied his genius for language to the task of conveying the nature of the Ultimate, the character of liberation, and the variety of the methods for the achievement of freedom. By means of the present translation, we are afforded the rare luxury of access to these powerful teach­ings. As we peer through the delicate latdce-work of this tenth- century Sanskrit text, we catch a glimpse of the marvelous and exotic world of the Kashmiri Shaiva Tantra. We can imagine the tantric guru saturated by the blissful nectar of the inherent unity of all conscious experiences patiendy teaching his disciples the secrets and intricacies of the Tantra.In the secret Heart of reality, Siva condnuously explicates him­self. His rumbling vibratory monologue to himself unfolds to become the delightful and enlightening dialogue of Bhairava and the Devi, the Goddess. As the Supreme consciousness self- referentially doubles back on itself (vimarsa), it generates the power of the Embodied Cosmos, the kauliki-sakti, which is the continuous urge towards liberadon and freedom that surges perpetually at the core of reality. For the non-dual Kashmir Shaiva tradiuon, this text, the Pardtrirnsikd, along with Abhinava- gupta’s vivarana on these ancient agamic verses, represent one of the highest available transcripdons of this dialogue. Thus, the"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Forewordxiiipublication of Singh’s translation of the PTv may be seen not just as a scholarly event, but as a moment of great importance in the understanding of these ancient wisdoms of India.We might perhaps characterize the present translation by Jaideva Singh, inspired and aided by Swami Laksmanjee, as a translation from the tradidon itself. It may therefore be con­trasted to Gnoli’s transladon into Italian which could be termed a transladon from Indological scholarship. Despite the understand­able differences of style inherent in these two stances, both trans- ladons are based on a medculous reading and correcdon of the published Sanskrit text. For, just as Gnoli presents us with a critical reading of the Sanskrit text, so too Singh has taken considerable care to emend and correct the corrupt published ediuon of the work, and he gives us the fruit of his text-cridcal labors as part of the present book. It will be the occupadon of future scholars to compare the independent work of textual reconstrucdon of these two authors. (I omit mendon here of the Gurutd translation into Hindi only because I have not yet seen it)It is beyond the scope of the present brief foreword to attempt a thematic introducdon to the text (In this regard I might immodestly refer the reader to my own transladon and interpre­tation of the FHv recently published as The Triadic Heart of Siva (SUNY 1988), as well as to the other important volumes of the SUNY Shaiva Tradidons of Kashmir Series.) The PTv takes up many of the themes dear to the tantric Shaivite master: the nature of consciousness as the AHAM, the fully free T; the nature of the Embodied Cosmos, the kulaf that emerges from the Heart of reality quite freely and impelled by the power of Siva; the nature of the Heart, the hrdaya, which harbors and conceals the innermost core of reality, and which condnuously plays at expansion and contraction; the many forms of the sakti, the power of Siva; the secret teaching of enlightenment conveyed condnuously by Bhairava to the Goddess in the Heart; the Emissional Power, the visarga-sakti, which both oversees the process of manifestation of the many transmigradonal abodes of the embodied self, as well as impels and facilitates the various methods for its eventual achievement of liberadon and freedom; the nature of language, from the Supreme word, parà-vàk, co­"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"xivParà-Trmkà-Vivaranaequal with the supreme consciousness, through various stages, to the manifestation of everyday speech: a topic that forms a central focus in the text, and which is of immense importance in understanding the exegeucal method of Abhinavagupta as he extracts the many meanings contained in the words of Bhairava; the nature of mantra, the primary tool announced by the PT verses for the achievement of liberation; the various paths to liberation, of which this text focuses on the highest, the so-called non-method, annpàya; the coiled and mysterious energy of the kundalinl, which resides at the center of the yogic body, awaidng ecstatic release; die thirty-six tattva-s or principles that structure the fabric of reality; and so on.No doubt, it is the aniculate and precise treatment that Abhin­avagupta gives to this variegated subject matter that consdtutes one of the most appealing features of the texL Yet this very same thematic complexity creates great difFiculdes for the reader and interpreter, difFiculdes which are compounded by a number of other factors. These include the fact that throughout his com­ment Abhinavagupta evidently has in mind a lost comment on the same PT verses by Somânanda known as the vivrti. Moreover, Abhinavagupta’s wriungs are informed by a precise knowledge of the entire gamut of intellectual and philosophical formulauons of ancient India, among which we should not forget to menuon the Vyâkarana (grammar), and the philosophies of Nÿaya and Pûrva-mîmâmsà. We should also emphasize Abhinavagupta’s encyclopedic knowledge of the Šaivágamic corpus. The PTv presupposes in the reader a knowledge of the ritual and technical exposidons which Abhinavagupta would later expound in the T 4, and is based on the scriptural authority of the MVT, the text held in highest reverence by Abhinavagupta and his tradidon. Thus, Abhinavagupta’s commentary is densely packed with implicit connecuons to this large and complex intellectual horizon.Nevertheless, Singh’s transladon and exposidons allow us entry into tins complex religious world. All persons interested in Abhinavagupta and the Hindu Tantra are deeply indebted to the dedicated labors of Singh, Swami Laksmanjee and editor Baumer in bringing to us this transladon of a very important Sanskrit text The reader will find in the following pages some of the most sublime passages of Indian religious and philosophical wridng."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"ForewordxvIn a traditional myth still current in Kashmir» Abhinavagupta was never seen to die, but rather disappeared with some twelve- hundred of his disciples into a cave. This myth-fragment pre­serves the ancient imagery of the enlightened mahdsiddha who bypasses the usual passage into death by entering into the cave of the Heart, the cave where the universal sky of consciousness shines perpetually. It is out of this cave that reality unfolds. As it does so, each object that emerges contains enfolded within it the totality, Siva, and thus, all other objects as well. Similarly, it is out of the cave of the Heart that each word spoken by Bhairava in his liberating teachings emerges. Every word which thus unfolds into the multivalent symbolisms of speech is a compressed sonic manifestauon of the infinity of Siva. Every word sparkles with the barely concealed reality of Siva which hovers just under its surface meaning. As Abhinavagupta says in his TA (26.65), in words that could appropriately refer to the P7u:The supreme nectar of consciousness, which removes birth, old age and death, flows gushing from ¡L I use it as the supreme oblation, like clarified butter, and in this way, O Supreme Goddess, I gladden and satisfy you day and nighLI invite readers to partake of the limpid streams that flow in the pages that follow.Paul E.

Kalharp: How i.e. *kena prakdrena*—in what way, by what means.2. Anuttaram: the unsurpassable Divine Consciousness is so called, because, as Abhinavagupta puts it, it is the Experient of all, and there is none other that can make it his object of experi­ence. It is the universal subject par excellence. “Tasya tu ciddt- manah svaprakdiasya na grdhakantaram asti iti anuttaratvam” (L. V. p. 1). “Anuttara is so called, because there is none other who can act as subject of that Self-luminous Universal Consciousness.” It is the Eternal Universal Subject of all experience.3. Sadyah: Immediately i.e. at the very moment when it is known. In Laghvi Vrtti, Abhinavagupta adopts the reading *svatah* in place of sadyah. Svatah has been explained in Laghvi Vftti as *svatantratah* i.e., by its absolute autonomy.4. Kaulika-siddhih: means ‘kule dehe bhaod kauliki siddhih\\ i.e. an achievement that occurs, that is experienced in this very phy­sical body. There are two important words in this phrase, viz. kaulika and siddhi. Kaulika is the adjective from kula, happening or occurring in kula; siddhi means achievement, the desired fulfilment. W hat is this achievement, what is this fulfilment? The achievement is ‘cidaikatmya* i.e. identity with, unification with cit or universal Consciousness. Kula includes deha or physical body. So, ‘kaulika-siddhi' means the achievement of the unifica­tion of the empirical consciousness with the Divine Universal Consciousness in this very body. The limitation of the individual consciousness disappears, it is transformed into unity-conscious- ness, and the individual views the world and life in a different light.

On the micro- cosmic plane, it refers to that energy which works in the human body. Kaulika siddhi thus brings about the perfect harmony of the microcosmic with the macrocosmic.There are, however, many shades of meaning of kaulika siddhi which will be clear from the translation of the Vivarana com­mentary of Abhinavagupta.5. Khecari-samata.Khecari: A.G. in L.V. says, ‘khecari bodhabhumisahcarini sati iyarji sarjivic-chaktifi.’ (p. 2). ‘Khecari’ is the Consciousness-power that moves about on the plane of bodha or the universal Divine Con­sciousness. W hat are the characteristics of this bodha? A.G. says, ‘They are avikalpatvam, purnatvarji. Bodha or the Universal Divine Consciousness is (1) thought-free (aoikalpa) and (2) it is pumai.e., whole, complete, undivided, unconditioned, integral. In one word, it is not limited or determined by any external condition. Khecari, therefore, is the fakti that pertains to this plane of consciousness.Samata means ‘sameness’. So ‘khecari-samatarji vrajet’ means he acquires the same integral, unconditioned, undetermined con­sciousness as that of Siva or the Divine.One who does not rise to that level does not have the experi­ence of khecari. As A.G. puts it in L.V., “ Tatprakdrctparijndne tu na khecari abodharupe vedyarjiSe sancaranat” (L.V., p. 2), “one who does not have the experience of that level does not have the experience of khecari, because his consciousness moves about in abodha which is only objective-external like blue colour or jar or cloth or internal like pleasure, pain, etc.” Abodha in this con­text is a technical term meaning empirical consciousness. A.G. clarifies this idea further by saying: u Tata eva vedyaih niladibhimi- yantriteti na purnalaktih” (L. V. 2). Since the empirical consciousness is determined, conditioned by ‘blue’, etc., therefore it is not pUrna, not integral, not unconditioned. The consciousness of the khecari level alone is unconditioned and hence puma or whole in itself.Com m entaryTex tFromparamefoarafi on p. 2 upto devi ityucyate on p. 3,1. 5"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"8Para-TrUikd- VivaranaTranslationThe Highest Lord ever brings about the five-fold act.1 He is in fact the very Grace itself, being always equipped with His Supreme Divine Energy (Sakti) whose very nature is Grace (it should be borne in mind that Sakti never considers herself as different from Siva.2) (The Supreme Divine Energy or pari Sakti expresses itself in pard vdk). This Sakti which is full of the thought of Grace for the entire world is, to begin with, non- different (in the undifferentiated or niroikalpa state) frompatyantl who is paramariamayi i.e. who is always cognizant of the essential nature of the Divine and who has a hundred powers which are boundless in operation which however will be described later. She (the Supreme vdk) is, in the most initial stage, stationed in the Divine I-consciousness which is the highest mantra and which is not limited by space or time. In that stage she (pard-vdk) abides without any distinction of question and answer which will start in paly anti.The paravdk which is non-dual i.e. identical with the (supreme) consciousness is present in ail experients3 always in her integral nature (of knowership and doership) uniformly in all states i.e., even at the level of paiyanti, madhyama and vaikhari. Therefore, paly anti comprehends in a general indeterminate (nirvikalpa) way whatever is desired to be known if it is awakened by due causal conditions just as one who has experienced variegated colour like dark, blue etc., as in a peacock’s tail and whose experience is determined by many impressions, positive and negative, recalls only that particular colour which is awakened by the proper causal condition of the memory. At the time of initial indeter­minate knowledge in paSyanti in which there is no distinction in the word and its referent, there was obviously not any sense of difference between the word and its referent.Madhyama, however, which shows the difference between the word and its referent is concerned with its comprehension only in the same location {sdmdnadhikaranya) i.e. in the antahkarana or the inner psychic apparatus.4 In vaikhari, on the other hand, there is a clear difference between the two i.e. between the word and its referent.6When this regular, fixed relation of the word and its referent (vyavasthdydr/i) is proved in one’s own experience, it will be found"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Abhinavagupla9that what is the stage of pard vdk is the power of non-mdylya word and is of the nature of the highest truth.

Therefore, beginning withpaiyanti which is the initial creative state of the energy of the highest mantra, up to vaikhari in which manifestation of difference of all the existents has proceeded fully, this pardvdk full of the wondrous delight of her own self, resting within her own self which is all Light, continues pulsating (sphurati). That pulsation is I-con­sciousness whose highest truth is uninterrupted continuity.6 This matter will be clarified further on.

Therefore, Supreme Consciousness even while appearing as paiyanti and madhyamd actually experiences Herself as the Supreme Consciousness. It is this Supreme Consciousness (pard satfwid) that is said to be ‘Devi’ (goddess).Notes1. The five-fold act refers to (1) sfffi or manifestation, (2) sthiti or maintenance, (3) sarjihdra or withdrawal or absorption,(4) vilaya or veiling the essential nature, (5) anugraha or reveal­ing the essential nature i.e. grace."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"10Pard-Tritikd- Vivar ana2.

Because of shining in the forms of ‘blue* etc. which appear everywhere, (she is called Devi) for the root ldiu* also means to shine or irradiate.5.

Hence ‘divinity’ (devoid) applies especially to Bhagavan Bhairava. Devi is (reasonably.) applied to Bhagavatl also, for she is His very Sakti. This interpretation of Devi is supported by the Science of Grammar which declares that the root ViV is used in the sense o f‘sport, the desire to overcome or surpass all, behav­iour, irradiation, adoration, and movement’.Thus the epithet deoatd is applied also to Vi$nu, Brahma etc. inasmuch as they partially partake of the divinity which is parti­cularly applicable in its wholeness only to the Highest Lord and, which is the same thing, his Sakti.Tex tThe rationale of the past tense in ‘said’ (uodca):From evam bhagaoati pedyanti madhyama ca on p. 3, 1. 14 upto sphufayifyate ca etat on p. 4,1. 15TranslationWhen the glorious paravdk becoming paiyanti and madhyama (i.e. in the stage of paiyanti and madhyamd) thus recollects Herself, “ I myself as Paravak Devi said thus”, then (i.e. in that state of recollection), shining forth (ullasat) in that form (i.e. as pardvak), she regards Her own para stage as past in accordance with the"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"12Pará-Trišikd-Vivaranafact of difference brought about by may a, because in comparison to Herself that stage (of pašyanti) is the commencement of mdyd, and because of her travelling through the passage of inner senses (in the case of madhyama) and outer senses (in the case of vaikhari), whose life consists in manifesting difference, she regards the para stage as past (paroksatayd).The today of Brahma is not limited by the (human) day whose division of day depends on the (apparent) motion of the sun. The measure of his today is determined by many kalpas.1 The day of Vi§nu and others is even longer than that, and in the case of Yogis the term day is used even for one-thousandth part of the human day on account of his inward motion of prána (breath).2 Thus how can the concept of today or the present which is un­settled and fictitious apply to unfictitious Consciousness (which is beyond time)?According to this principle, parávák who fulfils the sense of the past in all its aspects, viz. sámánya bhuta (luň i.e. aorist), anadya- tana (laň i.e., imperfect) an dparoksa (lit. i.e. past perfect) reflects thus in the first person of the paroksa (past): “ I the same Parávák Devi unseparated from Šiva (vácya) and the Šástra (vdcaka) or from the word and its referent thus said.’ This is the sense of the use of the past tense.(An example of such reflection about the past in the present may be cited from common experience:)“While asleep, I, indeed, bewailed” . In this experience, there is the proof of reflection about the past in the present. In the above example, the person does not remember the past experi­ence, for he did not have that experience in the past (and re­membrance is only of a past experience). Now after awaking, he experiences that state in astonishment either by the great re­liability of the statement of another person or by perturbation due to affections in his body through sobbing etc., caused by excessive bewailment, exuberant singing etc. This is not un­believable. “ In an insane condition or in the condition of being asleep, I, so they say, uttered moaning sound”— in this statement, there is a reference to the past even without any objective experi­ence in insanity, dream, swoon etc. In the parč (supreme) stage, there is, indeed, total absence of any object whatsoever.Only because this is the experience of the fourth state, the"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Abhinaoagupta13experience in this is identical with the experient whereas in insa­nity etc., the experience is due mainly to the excess of bewil­derment.

When it is stated, “The goddess said”, it means “ I (Paravak) only always know every­thing in an undifferentiated way in the highest stage {parabhumau), otherwise this (question-answer matter) would not acquire clear expression in the stage of palyanti and madhyama.” This is the sense of the statement: “The goddess said.” It is in this way that the later statement, “Bhairava said,” should be considered. There also, the sense of the statement is, “ I, only as Bhairava i.e., without the division of Siva and Sakti (guru and tisya in this con­text) said,” “Only being predominantly the divine Energy, it is in her aspect of her creative nature that She {para) uses the term 'aham' (I). Thus being predominantly the possessor of that Energy, the delightful experience of Bhairava in His aspect of withdrawal or absorption assumes the form of ‘ma-ha-a.”3 This will be clarified later.Notes1.

In this 'a' denotes Siva, ‘ha' denotes Sakti, 'm' denotes ‘nara' i.e., all objective existents. Thus ‘aham' denotes the state of manifestation or expansion {prasara) of the Divine in objective existence. Aham is known as srsfibija.

This is the aim of all the Sastras (the texts indicating the spiritual dis­cipline) from beginning to end; therefore, there is the actual ex­perience of the energy of the highest mantra of the I-consciousness of the Divine in jnanaSakti (power of knowledge) only which is the characteristic of Sadariva because of the appearance of the former,i.e. the question of the Dev! and the latter, i.e. the answer of Bhairava therein in the form of the construction of the words “Devi uvdca’ and ‘Bhairava uvdca* by means of the letters, D9 e9 v9 x, u9 v9 d9 ca and Bhy ai9 r, a9 va9 u9 v9 d9 ca.It has been rightly said in Svacchanda Tantra: “The God Sadariva Himself assuming the position of both teacher and pupil revealed the Tantra by means of former and latter sen­tences i.e. by means of question and answer.” (Vol. IV, KSTS, P -20).Thus the power of grace of the Divine is always and in all experients uninterrupted. Therefore, she (the power of Grace) alone, the life and soul of Trika Sastra, constitutes the highestre- lationship (between the experients and the Divine Consciousness).In the matter of anuttara9 i.e. in order to attain to anuttara (the unsurpassable, the Supreme), all other kinds of relationship,1 e.g. mahat9 antardla9 divya9 adivya9 etc. are in accordance with the said teaching, aimed at the Supreme only. The same thing has been said in Trikahrdaya:“The highest Lord is always intent on creativity (visargapara-"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Abhinavagupta15mab) through His Sakti. He showers grace, manifests and with­draws without any restraint (for grace only).”Thus there is always the active presence of anuttara. So the inner content i.e., question-answer which appears in the con­sciousness of the highest Lord in an undifferentiated way because of its being the highest truth, is thought of in the paiyantl stage in an indeterminate form (in nirvikalpa form) with a desire to put it in apportionment of letter, word, and sentence; it is posited with a sense of separateness in the madhyamd stage in a determinate form (i.e. in savikalpa form); it is finally expressed in the form of question and answer in the oaikhari stage i.e. in gross speech consisting of mdyiya letter, word and sentence, such as ‘how the unsurpassable etc.*This is that unobservable face (i.e. Sakti) of Bhairava full of the feel of manifestation, of which the essence is the unsurpas­sable I-consciousness, full of the stirring joy (kfobha)* brought about by the union (.sarjtghaffa) of Siva who is symbolized by €a* and Sakti who is symbolized by ‘¿f which is the source of the appearance and extension of manifestation according to the Trika system of philosophy and Yoga, which is the original (maulikarji)9 enduring state {dhruvapadam) and the life of all living beings. Therefore, it is not right to associate the Divine with a parti­cular station3 etc., for in the absence of any limitation in His case, designation of a particular place for Him is thoroughly unjustifiable.The fact of question and answer (oastu) is an ever present reality which is in the first instance, i.e. at the level of pardvdk without division (i.e. without the division of a question and its answer). Therefore, this is all what is meant to be said here. The Self who is the natural state of all existents, who is Self-luminous, amusing Himself with question-answer which is not different from Himself, and in which both the questioner (as Devi) and the answerer (as Bhairava) are only Himself, reflects thus as I, “ I myself, being thus desirous of wonderful delight knowing the truth as it is, appear as question and answer (tathaiva bhavdmi).” So the book begins with, “The Devi said—how the unsurpassable etc.”, says in the middle, “Bhairava said, Listen, O goddess,” and ends with “This constitutes Rudrayámala (the pair of Siva and Sakti).”"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"16Pard-Trttikd- VivarariaMoreover, from all the Sastras which have come out from five sources4 up to worldly dealings—all this is said to be the highest relationship {parah sambandhah)“ In my explanation I, Abhinavagupta, have revealed the entire hidden wealth of question-answer mode which has to be kept secret, which is the quintessence of the teaching that makes one identify oneself with Siva and which always leads oneself in experience to the state of Bhairava.”However with a desire for the good of my pupils, I am sum­ming up the whole teaching in the following verses: “ In ail dealings, whatever happens whether it is a matter of knowledge or action—all that arises in the fourth stage (turyabhum) i.e. in the pardvak in an undifferentiated {gatabhedarji) way. In paSyanli which is the initial field of the order of succession (kramabhujifu), there is only the germ of difference. In madhyamd> the distinction of jftiya (object of knowledge) and kdrya (action) appears in­wardly, for a clearcut succession is not possible at this stage {sphu takramdyoge).Moreover, madhyamd or pafyanti fully relying on para which is ever present and from which there is no real distinction of these {bhfiam pardm abhedato adhydsya) (later) regards that state as if past like a mad man or one who has got up from sleep.This state of the unsurpassable will be explained in this way (i.e. the subject-matter, nomenclature, connexion, and purpose). The same thing has been said by revered Somananda in his commentary6 (on Paratrisika) in the following words:“After the initial pulsation of Energy in the form of Devi uvdca of revered Bhairava who is (always) intent upon the fivefold act...” .I who have been purified by his (Somananda’s) commentary am attempting only to clarify the difficulties (lit., to cut asunder the knots) that have remained in that commentary.Notes1. There are six kinds of sambandha or relationship between the teachers and the taught:(1) Para-sambandha: in which the questioner and the answerer, the teacher and the taught are both Siva. It is the highest relationship.

Now, we are going to describe the abhidhcya or subject-matter. Triiikd is a com­pound word. This is its analysis ‘the iiikd of the three* (tisjndm iiikd). ‘O f the three* means ‘of icchd (will), jhdna (knowledge), kriyd (activity)' The three are also designated by such other words as sfsft1, sthiti9 sarjihdra (with reference to the physical plane) or ‘udyoga'9 ‘avabhdsa* and ‘carvand* (with reference to the spiritual plane). cIiikd' means *Iivari'9 the goddess who governs and controls the three i.e. icchd, jhdna and kriyd or sfffi, sthiti and sarjihdra, or udyoga, avabhdsa, and carvand. It should be borne in mind that liiand' or governance or control in this context means “ being non-different or identical with that which is to be governed"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"18Pard-Trttikd-Vivaranaor controlled.” Therefore, the revered goddess cpard iaktV (i.e. the supreme divine Consciousness) who at once transcends this division of three (viz. sfffi, sthiti, satjihdra etc.) and is identical with it is the abhidheya or subject-matter of the book, and because of its connexion with pard, the title (lit., name) of this Sastra is paratrUikd.’ Another reading of trifikd given by venerable teachers is ‘trirjiiakd\\ and owing to the similarity of words, they give the following etymology:“That which speaks out (kdyati) the three iaktis or powers” is trirjiiaka. The word trirjiiikd derived from its connexion with thirty (trirjisat) verses is not correct. Even thus, it is not the number of verses but only the sense of trirjiiakd, that should be adopted. For instance, it has been said in Tantrasara2:“The sense of Trimsaka has been declared by you in a range of a crore and half verses.”The relationship of the title of the book and the subject-matter is that of the supreme, for both refer to the same Reality. This has been practically pointed out already.The aim or purpose of the Sastra is liberation of all experients in life-time, experients who have become entitled for this know­ledge of the unsurpassable (anuttara) derived from grace in the form of excellent descent of divine &akti (power). This liberation connotes penetration with complete identity in the essential nature of Bhairava and unification with perfect I-consciousness which is the delightful flash of one’s own essential Self and is the achievement of one who by the realization of his essential nature regards the entire multitude of the categories of existence sup­posed to be bondage as mere different aspects of his sportfulness which is the expression of the abundance of his delight.8It is averred that liberation is deliverance from those things (the categories of existence) which are conventionally considered to be bondage, deliverance of the individual who lives and grows in the body, prdna etc.4 whose field of activity is the inner and outer senses (jndnendriyas and karmendriyas), and which (i.e. the body, prdna etc.) are as drives6 and whose life consists in strenuous endeavour.If all the impressions {sarjiskdra mdtra) caused by mdyd (i.e. the impressions of difference) vanish, what does the announcement of such liberation signify and with reference to what is this liberation?"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Abhinavagupta19The same idea has been expressed in Spandakarika (in the following lines):“He, who has this understanding (viz., that the universe is identical with the Self), regards the whole world as a play (of the Divine), and thus being ever united (with the universal Consci­ousness) is, without doubt, liberated while alive” (Sp. K. II, 5).This will be clarified shortly. Thus this realization (i.e., identity of oneself with the perfect I-consciousness of Bhairava) constitutes the purpose of the Sastras and so this purpose is the culmination of the object of human existence. An inquiry about the purpose of purpose is uncalled for. So the connexion, the subject-matter, and the purpose have been described.6Notes1. In the classification according to sfffi etc., there are five aspects, viz. sfffi, sthiti, sarjih&ra, pidhdna or vilaya and anugraha and according to udyoga etc., there are also five aspects, viz. udyoga, auabh&sa, carvandy bijdoasthapanay and vildpana.

By ‘drives’, Abhinava does not mean that they drive one to misery, but that they drive or push the individual to higher life; their very short-coming acts as a stimulus for rising to a higher life.6. This refers to what is known as anubandhacatuf(aya, or four indispensable elements of any idstra. They are (1) the prayojana or purpose or aim, (2) the adhikdriy i.e. one who is competent for the study of the particular Sastray (3) abhidJuyaythc subject-matter of the idstray (4) sambandha or relationship or connexion between the title of the Rostra (abhidhdna) and the subject-matter (abhi- dheya).(1) Abhinavagupta says that the prayojana or purpose of the"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"20Pard-Trilikd- VivaranaIdstra is mukti or liberation, but he scouts the popular idea of mukti as deliverance from the vehicles of the Self or from the categories (tattodni) of existence.

(Abhinava takes up the first word of the first stanza, viz., anuttaram for explana­tion. He has explained it in sixteen ways).1. Uttara may be interpreted as ‘more, additional*, ‘on’ means ‘not*. lAnuttaram\\ therefore, means *na oidyate uttaram adhikarji yatah\\ i.e. ‘Than which there is nothing more, or additional*.The other thirty-six tattoos (categories of existence) upto Ana- srita Siva1 whose very existence is proved by their entrance into the consciousness of highest Bhairava (i.e. which owe their very existence to Para Bhairava) point to the Consciousness of Bhairava as something more than or superior to themselves. Not like this is the highest, most perfect Consciousness of Bhairava (i.e., the Bhairava-Consciousness does not point to anything more or higher than itself), because of its essence being unrestrained, non- relative, delightful flash of knowership."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Abhinavagupta212. Anuttara is that state in which there is neither question, nor answer (i.e. in which a question formulated in 'Devi uvdcc? or an answer formulated in ‘Bhairava uvaca* does not arise). It is that ocean of supreme Consciousness, from which arises infinite know­ledge upto that of AnaSrita Siva, and by which the pupil be­comes competent for the clarity of the question to be raised. It is, in fact, that Reality which is ever awake. In that state how can there ever be an occasion for another answer (than the perfect Bhairava Consciousness) which comes from a preceptor or Guru?3. ‘Uttara* means crossing i.e. liberation. This is the libera­tion accepted by the dualists. This does not go beyond the fixed order of things.According to this, one has, first of all, to enter from the stage of body to the stage of prdna> then the stage of buddhi, i.e. one at first considers the body to be the Self, then the prdna, and then the buddhi to be the Self, then the stage of prdna (the universal prdna- Sakti spandandkhydrjijivanarUpatdjji)y then the state of the void which connotes the dissolution of all objectivity, and then on attaining the highest pitch (atiSayadhardprdptau) of the successive diminu­tion of all the malas (limitations), the emprical individual is freed on the manifestation of the state of Siva. All this stupendous ascension is, indeed* futile (for were not the previous stages also the expression of Siva?).4. Similarly, rising of the iakti from the navel to the heart, then to the throat, then to the palate, then to the top of the head (ibrahma i.e., sahasrdra)y then to the Bhairava bila (the point above the sahasrdra) in an upward succession is ascension. Anuttara signifies that in this Saiva Agama, mounting to Bhairava by an upward succession through the six cakras is not indispensable {na vidyate uttarah i.e. Urdhvataranakramah yatra).5. Uttara also means ‘that from which one has to go beyond* i.e., bondage or the world. It also means ‘crossing over* i.e. moksa or deliverance.Therefore, anuttara is that in which there are no such cros­sings (i.e. according to anuttara, the world is not really bondage, and when the world is not bondage, the question of deliverance does not arise).6. Uttara also means speaking in a limited way (about Rea- lity) e.g. ‘It is like this, it is like that*, i.e. limiting Reality in these"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"22Pard-Tritikd- Vi varonaways. Therefore, anuttara is that which has not got limitations. It is unlimited, infinite Reality.7. Even pointing to Highest Reality2 by the mere word ‘this* is also limiting it, for such indication is also limitation. Thus be­cause of its sense of exclusion {vyavacchedakatvdt), even a simple denotation as ‘this’ is only a vikalpa i.e. a mere thought-construct, because of its essence being ‘limitation* (vyaccheda-prdnameva). Therefore, so long as an empirical experient {mdyiyafi pramdtd) is desirous of entering anuttara (the Supreme Reality) so long he remains in vikalpa (thought-construct) of a particular form (i.e. in samadhi). In this context, (it must be borne in mind) that that which is indeterminate (avikalpitarp.) and necessarily inherent in everything (avinabhdoi),3 that is really anuttara (Supreme Con­sciousness), for without it even a determinate concept cannot ap­pear (tadvina kalpitarupdsphuranat). In fact, in anuttara (tatra), contemplation, concentration etc. (bhdoanddeh) are wholly inap­plicable. Therefore, it {anuttara) has been declared (by Soma- nanda) to be beyond contemplation, karana, etc. Not that bhd- vand is wholly useless, (i.e. it can only bring about the purifi­cation of mind, but not the realization of anuttara). Such anuttara (i.e. the nirvikalpay thought-free anuttara) abides even in the life of the work-a-day world (for those who have its awareness). It has been (thus) said by myself in one of my hymns:“ Slender (pratanu) rain falling continuously (avicchidaiuapatan) is not visible in the far-spreading sky (vitata ioa nabhasi) but it is clearly visible in juxtaposition with the tree of the forest or the eaves of the roof of a house. Even so, the Supreme Bhairava, being too subtle, never appears in the range of experience. Under the circumstances, it is only by its connexion with means which de­pend on space, form, time, pattern, and state that that consci­ousness is generated instantaneously in them in whom the aware­ness of Bhairava is subdued—the consciousness that is indicative of thy presence, O Lord !”So it will be said further that what is posited as an answer is really no answer. Now we proceed further with the explanation of anuttara.8. Thus the fdkta updya is said to be higher than the nara i.e. dnava updya. Sdijibhava updya is higher even than that (i.e. iakta updya). Even in Sdrjibhava updyas there is a hierarchy among them­"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Abhinavagupta23selves in the forms of bhuta, tatted, mantra, mantreivara, (iakti etc.). Again even among physical elements, there is a hierarchy in the form of the earth, water etc. The dreaming is higher than the waking, sleep is higher than that (dream ); the fourth state (turya) is higher than that (sleep); the state beyond the fourth (turydtita) is higher than that (i.e. the turya). Even in the waking condition there is a hierarchy of these states among themselves through four4 varieties. I have conclusively dis­cussed this matter in detail in Sripurvapaftcika.6 I have not des­cribed it here in detail, because that will serve no useful purpose, and will unnecessarily increase the volume of the book. This kind of uttaratva (hierarchy) only shows higher and lower and contains the delusion of dualism.9. Uttara (in anuttara) is used in an abstract sense in which there is no indication of superiority or inferiority as in the division of brdhmana, k?attriya, vaiiya, iudra, the lowest caste (the caste last in order).10. Uttara (is used) in the sense of Saktis like paSyantP etc.11. Uttara may mean Saktis like Aghora and others.712. Uttara may mean 'para' etc.8 Anuttara is that where these don’t exist.13. Anuttara may be analysed into a-\\-nut-\\-tara. The noun ‘nut’ is derived from the root ‘nud’ which means to impel, to push, and tar a means crossing, going beyond the worldly existence. Nuttara would, therefore, mean ‘going beyond the worldly existence through impulsion’ by the process of initiation.The guru (spiritual guide) sets in motion his own consciousness in the consciousness of the disciple. Thus he (the guru) applies an initiation which is intended to bring about liberation (moksada) by means of the process (paripdlya) of the central point (oisuoat)® etc. which is devoid of the movement of prdna (exhalation) and apdna (inhalation) breaths which assume the utterance of harjisa, and is the junction of both and by the difference of sthdna10 on the sakala nifkalau initiation and through the practice of yojanika12 initiation on the occasion of the last function of the complete oblation.Now in all these, how is this kind of mockery made of the un­surpassable consciousness (anuttara caitanya) that is self-luminous,"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"24Pard-TriSika-Vivaranaomnipresent, unmodified, i.e. unrestricted by the limitation of space, time and form?13Therefore anuttara is that in which a crossing over does not occur by such impulsion as will be said in: “Thus initiation that leads one to liberation is achieved only in the case of one who knows the Truth in reality” (P. T. v. 26).14. ‘An* from the root ‘an* ‘to breathe* with the suffix ‘kvip* means one who breathes. Thus ‘An* means anu or the empirical individual whose life consists in breath and who considers his gross body {deha) or the subtle body (puryasfaka) etc., i.e. prdna as the Self. Similarly ananam may mean life {prdnand), existing in the body etc., consisting of different powers devoid of I-con- sciousness, as in the case of one who is known as Sunya-pramdtd.14 So anuttara would mean superiority over the empirical individual and the iunya-pramdtd, having preponderance over everything, because of its being the highest truth, i.e. because of its being Bhairava Himself.In this world full of sentient and insentient existents, the non- senticnt ones exist because of their dependence on the sentient ones. The life of all living beings consists indeed in the afore­mentioned divine powers of knowledge and action in the case of other experients also (paratra) as in one’s own. Only the bodies etc. appear as different.And that which is life appears in every one without any dis­tinction i.e. life appears in every one whether he is deha-pramdtd, puryaj[aka-pramdtd or iunya-pramdtd. This indeed is the highes. truth. As has been said by revered Utpaladeva:“Knowledge (jndna) and activity (kriyd) are the very life of living beings.” (P.K. I, 4)Thus life consists only in knowledge and activity, i.e. know­ledge and activity alone are symbolic of life.15. Anuttara may be analysed as aA-nut+tara meaning the tar a or flotation of the nut or impulsion of ‘a*. ‘A* is the Sakti (kald) who is above the range of may a (amayiya)i who is not found in Sruti-£astra (i.e. in the Vedic tradition), who is the bliss (camat- kdra) of the very waveless ocean of consciousness abiding in the natural, supreme Light, who covers both the initial and the final stage of the perfect I-consciousness (i.e. both ‘a* and ‘harp* the Sanskrit word for T ) , which comprehends the entire cosmos"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Abhinavagupta25which is the expression of the creative delight of Sakti. Nut i.e. impulsion is the culmination of the expansion (visargantatd)15 of that (i.e. kald). Tarah means the flotation or swimming of that nut i.e. the continuance of that state over everything else. (The sense is that though anuttara in its expansion is denoted by Sakti and nara> yet it is never separated by these. It pervades up to the very end).16. Anuttara is now analysed as anut+tara. ‘A ' in anut means avldyamdna (not existing), ‘nut' in ‘anut' means impulsion i.e. successive action (kramatmakd-kriyd) depending on the duality of going and coming i.e. movement in space and time. So ‘anut9 means that in which there is no impulsion of the successive move­ment (kriydmayi prerand).This ‘anut' is well-known among people as dkdia (ether) etc. i.e. iunya or void (for in dkdia or void, there is no possibility of coming and going etc.).‘Tara' is a sign of comparison, meaning better, higher. So ‘anuttara' means higher even than dkdia or ether.In ‘dkdia' (ether) etc. also there may be said to be successive action on account of incidental contact with a ja r or various other incidental contacts and on account of constant and intimate connexion as that of sound. In the supreme Consciousness, how­ever, which has as its essence, the sovereign power of thoroughly uninterrupted, absolute Freedom, which has I-consciousness full of the entire multitudinous objectivity characterized by thisness, the condition of which is accepted {svikrta) by Siva but is viewed with hesitancy (iankyamana), by Ana£rita Siva, with a feeling of ease characterized by delight in differentiated objectivity (oicchin- na-camatkaramaya-viirdntyd), which is ever beyond all appearance (,nirdbhase), but which is always shining in manifestation, in which what was non-appearance for AnaSrita Siva has been accepted as appearance by Siva {soikardbhdsikftdndbhdse), the activity of I-consciousness is successionless, because of the absence of the relativity of space and time which are characterized by objectivity (in manifestation) and absence of objectivity (in withdrawal), which is full of the delight of its own consciousness, well known in the matsyodari16 and mata idstra. This succession- less I-consciousness is the anuttara (supreme, unsurpassable)."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"26Pará-Trtiiká- Vivar ana(Now Abhinavagupta takes up the question as to why the word anuttara has been used instead of anuttama.)According to the rule of grammar, the suffix tamap (i.e. tama) is used (in the superlative degree of adjective), denoting that which surpasses everything (attiqyamdtra), but the suffix tarap (i.e. tar a, denoting comparative degree) has been used here which shows only a comparison of two things. For instance when we say, ‘This is whiter’, what we mean is that of two things both of which are white, one has more whiteness (atifayena Suklah) than the other. But in the sentence ‘of these white things, this has more whiteness’—what is the additional sense in this? For in­stance in: ‘This palace is white, this cloth is white, this swan is also white’, that which has the greatest whiteness is said to be whitest (hiklatama). The palace is also white, the cloth is also white—what additional information has been given in ‘the whitest*? Therefore in the tamap suffix, the formation of the sen­tence in the above way is inappropriate. The tamap suffix does not describe anything more than the tarap suffix.This is what is meant to be said: “The tamap suffix is used when a particular correlative is not intended to be spoken about (i.e. when there is no comparison between two), the tarap suffix is used with reference to a correlative (i.e. when there is compari­son between two). The secondary word (upapada) is used when there is a distinction made by a dual number with reference to a correlative.” One only is a correlative. ‘O f the two, this is more white’—in this, a third is not acknowledged. For expressing specific ascertainment, the first is considered to have a corre­lative. There is no expectancy of more than two in comparison. There is comparison of only one simultaneously with reference to the other. In using the tamap affix by way of gradation, one does not get any additional information. The use of ‘tarap’ and ‘tamap' suffix in the sense of graded or comparative value is only conventional; it has no regular or proper derivation. It is not in accordance with the sense of ‘tarap’ and ‘tamap’ suffix. If tarap and tamap indicate graded excellence, so may tdrya and tdmya also. Enough of displaying ability unnecessarily regarding a matter a bit of which we have heard from scholars.Here it is in order to indicate graded correlatives along with *uttara’ that the tarap suffix has been used.

V. II, 1, 2).19Thus this unsurpassable Reality {anuttara) has been explained in sixteen ways. In the Trikasara20 also, it has been said:“Anuttara is the heart (centre) of all. There is a knot in that heart. Knowing that knot to be sixteen-fold, one should perform one’s actions at ease.”21Similarly, “The knot abiding in the heart can be untied only by Anuttara Himself.”Notes1.

Sakala and nifkala initiation:Sakala initiation is for one who after realization of the Supreme wants to remain in the world and help others in their realization of liberty. By initiation, the future and past karmas of such a disciple are destroyed, but his prarabdha karma (i.e. karma which has commenced to bear fruit) is untouched so that he may re­main in the physical body in order to liberate other souls. A parallel may be noticed in the Bodhisattva of Buddhism.Nifkala initiation is for one who only wants his liberation and is not concerned with the liberation of others. A parallel may be noticed in the Pratyeka Buddha of Buddhism.For details, see Tantraloka, 15th Ahnika, verse 30 ff.12.

As has been said: “By reason of action (only) in collaboration with another’’ (Y.S. IV, 24).2So kula or totality is so called, because Consciousness itself abides in the various forms of objectivity2 (yathduasthandt)z by means of coagulation4 and Consciousness itself (voluntarily)5 assumes bondage by its own Freedom. It is said: “The word ‘kula’ is used in the sense of coagulation and kindred.” {sarjistydne bandhufu ca).•Without Consciousness which is Light itself, no entity which is devoid of the light of manifestation (<aprakdfamdnarji vapuh) can acquire existence.Now ‘kaulikV is that which is related to the whole universe including the body; siddhi or achievement is the acquisition of bliss (dnanda) by turning round (pariuftya)1 to have a firm hold on that very principle i.e. the light of the universal consciousness"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"32Pará-TrUikd- Vivar ana(<tathdtva-darfjlhyarji), in other words, identity with the perfect I-feeling of Siva, who is the highest Consciousness and whose nature is spanda or the eternal throb of delight in manifestation (hfdaya-svabhfoa-parasarjividdtmaka-Siva-vimarfa-tdddtmyam). So 'kau- lika-siddhidarji’ is that which enables one to have such achieve­ment. In other words, by achieving identity with anuttaray the .otality of manifestation becomes like that anuttara itself.As has been said in the following lines:“By means of negative and positive proof8 (vyatireketardbhydiji) there is settled conviction concerning the Self (nijdtman) and objectivity (anyay lit., the other). Such conviction is known as fixity (vyaoasthiti), firm standing (pratis(hd)y complete attain­ment (siddhi)y and final beatitude (nirvftti).”(Interpretation of the word sadyah)The word ‘sadyah’ is used in the sense of ‘on the same day’ (jfl = same, adya =day). As has been said previously, there is no fixity of the day or the present (i.e. it is only conventional). So, ‘sadyah’ in this context means at the same instant. Sameness here does not connote sameness of the moment, but rather ‘ter­minating in Reality’ (tattvaparyaoasdyi), for it is in this way that the word sadyah is to be understood. Therefore if sadyah is to be taken in the sense o f‘at that very moment’, then on account of the limitation of the present moment, the past and future moments would be rejected, and thus the present whose life consists in its being reckoned relatively with reference to the past and the future will also have to be rejected.For the kula (total objectivity) that has been described (so far) is the collective whole (cakra) of the rays9 of the divine Sun, viz. Bhairava and is of the essence of Light (in its external aspect). When, however, that (kula) acquires nirodha (rest, stoppage) by identification with the inner supreme Bhairava Consciousness, then it is full of the relish of the ambrosia of supreme bliss, is anuttara (transcendent to all aspects and phases), beyond space and time, eternal of the form of oisargay10 and ever- risen.

The siddhi (achievement) consists in the definite grasp of blue, pleasure etc. (i.e. objective and subjective experience) which are completely diverse (lit., whose life consists of diversity). Kaulika-siddhidarp., therefore, means that which gives i.e. brings about the definite grasp of objective and sub­jective phenomena by means of kula i.e. by means of the body, prdna, and puryasfaka. Indeed it is the body, mind, etc., which, through the penetration in them of the energy of the eternal V i.e. ‘Siva’, and His externalizing Sakti symbolizing ‘/w’, the energy that is beyond the sphere of time and that mounts the intermediate stair of prdna etc., which bring about the success in the form of the definite perception of the existing entities.13 As has been said,“It is rather by coming in contact with the power of the Self that the empirical individual is equal to that (i.e. the divine Being)*’ (Sp. K. I, 8).Similarly,“Resorting to that power (of spanda tattva), the divinities, M antra etc., being endowed with the power of omniscience proceed to carry out their assigned functions towards the embodied ones just as the senses of the embodied ones by resorting to the power of spanda proceed to carry out their (specific) functions” (Sp. K. 11,1).(Third interpretation of kaulika-siddhidarji)Kula means—though kula of the form of Siva-Sakti is close at hand, i.e. though it is present in every one, it is not realized by all.

V II, 101)Similarly, (it is said in the following lines):“Having once acquired the knowledge of omnipresent Siva with firm conviction through experience (pramdna)> the scripture, and the statement of the guru> there is nothing to be done any more by means of karana or bhdvand.” (S.D. 5b-6).(Fourth interpretation of kaulika siddhidarji) ilKaulika means kulc-jatd i.e., born or sprung in kula. Siddhi means the achievement of the appearance of diversity, beginning with the expansion of ‘Aa’, the expression of Sakti’s delight and ending with the evolution of the multitude of external existents. T hat which brings about such achievement is kaulikasiddhidaiji.It is anuttara itself of the nature of eminent Light, which has implicitly within itself the expansion of the universe as identical with consciousness,17 that explicitly evolves diversity through the abundance of the delight of power issuing from its own unsur­passed Freedom. Mdyd or prakjli which is not Light of Consci­ousness (aprakdiardparji) cannot be the cause of the manifesta­tion of existents. If that is supposed to be of the nature of Light, then it certainly is the exalted Lord Bhairava Himself. Then what is the use of another snare of words?Notes1. Kula or the totality of manifestation appears in three forms, viz., gross (sthula)> subtle (sukpna) and the ulterior (para) either as material object or as the body. In the case of the body it is known as sthdla Sarira, sQksma-farlra, and para or karana farira. In the sense of cause-effect3 it means that bhUtddi or paHca mahd- bhutaSy the five gross physical elements, viz., earth, water, fire, air, and ether are the effect of sthdla or gross matter, the indriyas or"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Abhinavagupta35senses are the effects of subtle or sdkpna matter, and prdna is the ■effect of the para or ulterior matter.2.

Tathdvasthdndt means that every material object appears in its own space, time and form.4. Aiyanardpatayd or ‘by means of coagulation’ means that subtle energy of consciousness assumes the solid form of matter, but even in that thickened mass of matter, consciousness does not lose its nature, even as water in becoming ice does not lose its nature.5. The kula or totality of matter assumes bondage or limitation not by any compulsion, but bodhasodtantryddeoay by the inherent Freedom of the divine Consciousness, i.e. the divine Conscious­ness voluntarily descends into the limitation of matter.6. The double entendre in ‘bandhu$u* cannot be brought out in translation. The word ‘bandhu* is derived from the root 'bandh* which means to bind. ‘badhnati manah snehadind iti bandhuh*. A kindred or friend is called ‘bandhu* because he binds the mind by affection etc. In bandhdbhimdndt} A.G. suggests that 'kula* binds or limits not only in the sense of matter, but also in the sense of kindred or friend.7. Parivftya is a very significant expression in this context. Parivftya means ‘turning round, going back’ to its origin. ‘Pari- uftti* the noun form of the verb *parioji* is a technical word of this system. It is defined as ‘idantdtmakarp, vtiodbhdsam ahantdtmani purndbhasc satjisthdnani*—the entire objective manifestation appear­ing as ‘this’ abiding in the full blaze of perfect I-consciousness of the divine’.

That Sakti is khecari, who abiding in kha, i.e. brahma (i.e. cit) which is identical with herself roams about i.e. functions in various ways (carati). This khecari in her universal aspect functions {carati) in three ways. She (as gocari) brings about a knowledge of objects, (as dikcari) effects movements, such as grasping, relinquishing, etc., (as bhdcari) exists in the form of objective existents. Thus this khecari exists as gocari in the form of antahkaraim (the inner psychic apparatus), as dikcari in the form of bahifkarana (i.e. outer senses), as bhdcari in the form of objective existents, as blue etc., or subjective existents as pleasure etc."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Abhinaoagupta39Similarly, in the individual aspects, the iaktis that are known successively as vyomacari in the void (of consciousness) in which the distinction between subject and object has not yet appeared, as gocari in the form of antahkarana in which there is just ap­pearance of knowledge, as dikcari in the form of the outer senses suggesting the appearance of diversity in which state there is diversity of the knower from the knowable object, as bhucari in the form of bhavas or existents in which there is preponderance of clear diversity in the objects, are in reality, according to the principle enunciated, non-distinct from khecari which abides in the essential nature i.e. anuttara. Thus that Sakti of the Supreme Lord is only one. As has been said,“His iaktis constitute the entire universe, and the great Lord is the possessor of all the iaktis.” O r according to another inter­pretation: “ There is only one possessor of Sakti, viz., Mahesvara and the entire phenomenal manifestation is the varied form of His svdtantrya iakti (sovereign autonomy).” Consequently she (ikhecari) is indicated in feminine gender.It would not be proper to have a fixed, regular order or sepa­rateness between khecari iakti whose sphere is the self, gocari whose sphere is the antahkarana or mind, dikcari whose sphere is the senses and bhUcari whose sphere is external objects, because in that case an intimate connexion between them would not be possible, and also because as completely separate from khecari, they would not appear at all (merely through the activity of the senses).T hat very khecari is perceived separately (from the Divine) in the form of desire, anger, etc. However, the samatd or same­ness of khecari means the perception of her full divine nature everywhere (in iabda or sound, rUpa or form and colour, rasa or taste, gandha or smell, sparia or contact) because of her being of the nature of perfect Bhairava. Even an iota of the ignorance of the nature of the integral anuttara amounts to a contrary state of the mind. It is this contrary state that constitutes transmigra- tory existence (sajjisdra).In this state, there is active display of dnava mala bringing about as it does the sense of extreme smallness in oneself because of his considering himself as thoroughly imperfect, of mdyiya mala which is due to perception of diversity which comes about"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"40Pard- Trifikd- Vivaranabecause of the longing for making up (lit. filling) for the limitation caused by dnava mala, of karma mala which arises because of laying hold of the residual traces of good and evil actions done under the influence of mdyd.When owing to the absence of limitation, the aberration (oai- samya) of the modes of the mind caused by the non-recognition of the essential nature ceases, the very states of anger, delusion, etc., appear as only an expression of the consciousness of the perfect, revered Lord Bhairava Himself. As revered Somananda has said: “ Siva is that whose very nature consists in the expansion of His Saktis” (Sivadr$|i, I I I , 94). Similarly, “ Whether it is the state of pleasure (the expression of sattva) or of pain (the expression of rajas), or of delusion (the expression of tamos), I abide in all of them as the Supreme Siva” (S.D. V II, 105).“ In pain also, the purpose is steadiness through the efflore­scence of the essential nature by means of endurance” etc. (S.D., V. 9).Even the states of anger etc., exist because of their identity with the wondrous play of the (divine) consciousness, otherwise their very existence would be impossible (lit., otherwise the very acquisition of their nature would be impossible). The divine sense-goddesses themselves carrying out the various play (of life) are like the rays of Siva-sun. The sense-divinities1 by combining among themselves become of innumerable sorts. They are either of terrible or beneficent kinds arrayed for various appro­priate purposes (parikalpita-tattatsamucita-saumya-rudraprakdrah) and employed for terrible (raudra) actions of uccd(ana% and mdrana or for gentle, beneficent actions {Sdntyddirupesu karmefu) and in the mata idstrd* etc., are said to be worthy of worship as deities according to their division as kftydx etc. They constitute the family of revered Bhairava. As has been said, beginning w ith: “ One should assume the crow-faced pose for uccafana” and in: “ they are the rays of the God of gods and hold the power of ‘Ara* and other groups of letters.”If the real nature of these rays i.e. iaktis is not realized, then concealing (tirodadhatyah) the wondrous play of the divine Con­sciousness which remains without any differentiation even in the midst of differentiations (vikalpt'pi nirvikalpaikasararji), they bring about the state of paSus (limited experients) by worldly"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Abhinavagupta41snare, by means of the multitude of various kinds of letters, by means of the ghoratari iaktis who carry on their sports (i.e. devatâ• tmanà) in the form of various kinds of concepts (vikalparüpena) by entering them (i.e. the limited experients) in the form of fear arising from doubt.As has been said in the following lines:“ Mahàghoras are the deities of the pi (has who delude people constantly”, and in: “ They push those limited experients down and down who are engrossed in objects of pleasure.” And also in :“Being deprived of his glory by kalâ,5 he (the individual) becomes a victim of the group of powers arising from the multi­tude of words and thus he is known as the bound one.” (Sp. K. I ll, 13).When their real nature is known, then these very mental states (such as anger, delusion, etc. ) bring about, by the means referred to (viz. khecari-samatà) liberation in life itself. As has been said:“ When, however, he is firmly rooted in that supreme spanda principle, then bringing the emergence and dissolution of the putyaffaka entirely under his control, he becomes the real enjoyer and thenceforth the lord of the collective whole of the iaktis” (Sp. K. Ill, 15).This is what is meant by the knowledge of their (i.e. the states of desire, anger etc.) real nature. These states of anger, etc., at the time of their arising are of the form of nirvikalpa i.e. they are sheer energy of the divine.So even when an aberrant thought-construct (vikalpa) (such as kâma or krodha) arises (which at the time of arising is non- aberrant) and is influenced by the varied words which are the outcome of the multitude of letters, it is not united with the group of the iaktis associated with the multitude of the letters so that it cannot annul the yogi’s nature determined by his earlier state of nirvikalpa. The thought-constructs are not entirely detached from the indeterminate state of consciousness (nirvi­kalpa) which is only another kind of vikalpa or thought. It is only the indeterminate consciousness (nirvikalpa) which by the power of its autonomy (svàtantrya) differentiates from itself the various entities (bhàvas) from which are derived the differences of the gross elements (labdhabheda-bhütàdi) known as vijhâna-"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"42Pard-Trifikd-Vioaranacakra and is thus the master or regulator of it (i.e. the vijndna- cakra).Therefore, homogeneousness (sdmya or samatd) of the khecari- iakti constitutes liberation. This homogeneousness (sameness) of the khecari iakti is due to the awareness of the essential nature of the anuttara (i.e. the unsurpassable Absolute Reality) which is constantly present and which arises from the bliss of the recogni­tion of the completion of the union of the divine Sakti with Siva, and acquires stability by the realization of the consciousness of bliss of both (ubhayaoimarldnandarutfhi).Siva intent on creativity in the form of expansion by means of the energy of the great mantra of the Supreme primal word, viz. the perfect I, in union with Sakti, in whom the urge for expansion is implicit, and in whom abounds the bloom of the compactness of their energy, becomes engaged in the act of creative expansion.6Now whatever enters the inner psychic apparatus or the outer senses of all beings, that abides as sentient life-energy (cetanaru- pena prdndtmana) in the middle channel i.e., susumnd whose main characteristic is to enliven all the parts of the body. T hat life- energy is said to be ‘ojas* (vital lustre), that is then diffused as an enlivening factor in the form of common seminal energy (virya) in ail parts of the body.7 Then when an exciting visual or auditory perception enters the percepient, then on account of its exciting power, it fans the flame of passion in the form of the agitation of the seminal energy.As has been said:“By conversation or contact with the body etc.”O f the form, sound etc., even a single one, because of its being made powerful by the augmented vigour referred to previously, can bring about the excitement of the senses pertaining to all other objects also. Since every thing is an epitome of all things for all people, even memory or idea of a thing can surely bring about agitation because of the excitement of innumerable kinds of experiences like sound etc. lying subconsciously in the omni­farious mind. Only well-developed seminal energy (virya) con­taining the quintessence of all experiences (paripuffa-sarvamaya- mahdoiryamcva) can bring about full development and endow one with the power of procreation (pusfi-srftikari), not its immature state (apurtiam) as in the case of a child, or its diminished state"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"Abhinavagupta43(kfinam) as in the case of an old man. When the seminal energy that has been lying within and identical with one’s Self in a placid state (svamayatvena abhinnasydpi) is agitated (viksobha)i.e. when it is in an active state, then the source of its pleasure is the Supreme I-consciousness full of creative pulsation, beyond the range of space and time (adeiakdiakalitaspandamayamahdvima- rSa-rupameoa)y of the nature of perfect Bhairava-consciousness, the absolute sovereignty, full of the power of bliss.Even a (beautiful) figure brought into prominence by the meeting of two eyes affords delight only by the device of its union8 with the mighty seminal energy (mahdvisarga-oiflefana*-yuktyd) which stirs up the energy of the eyes (tadviryakfobhdtmaka); such is also the case when the ears hear a sweet song.In the case of other sense-organs also, the perception by itself (i.e. without its union with the seminal energy) cannot acquire full expansion because of the springing up of energy only in the sense-organ itself (svatmani eva ucchalandt).So in the case of those in whom the seminal energy has not developed (tadvirya-anupabnjihitdnarji), in whom the pleasure of love that excites the seminal energy as in other cases, is absent, who are like stone, to whom the beautiful figure of a charming young woman with large and handsome hips, with face moving to and fro and with sweet, soft and melodious song cannot give full delight. To the extent to which an object cannot bring about full excitement to that extent it can provide only limited delight. If there is complete absence of delight, it only spells insentiency. Engrossment in a profuse delight alone excites the seminal energy and that alone signifies a taste for beautiful things (sahfdayata). Excessive delight is possible only to those whose heart is expanded by seminal energy which has the boundless capacity to strengthen sensibility and which is established in them by repeated association with objects of enjoyment.In grief also, there is the same wondrous experience of delight (to those who have khecari-sdmya).

This only betokens the delight of Brahman which in other words is that of one’s own self.” (V.Bh.

Mahat or mahdn sambandha is that in which the questioner is Sadariva and the answerer is Siva.11. Antarala sambandha is that in which the questioner is Ananta- bha|taraka and the answerer is Sadasiva.Ex po sitio nThere are four important points in the long commentary of A.G. on this verse, viz. (1) W hat does the dialogue between the Devi and Bhairava actually mean ? (2) The connotation of Anuttara,(3) W hat is kaulika-siddhi ?, (4) The concept of khecari-samatd.We may take up these points one by one.1. W hat does the dialogue between the Devi and Bhairava mean? ‘Devi uvaca9 means, ‘The Devi said’ i.e. put a question, and Bhairava uvaca means ‘Bhairava answered*. Does this refer to some remote past in which there was a dialogue between the Devi and Bhairava? W hat does the past tense connote? Who is the Devi? Who is Bhairava?A.G. says, “Paraiva ca sarjivit ‘Devi* ityutyatc”. The Devi is none other than the Supreme Divine Consciousness which is not an abstract idea but living, throbbing Conscious Power, or Energy (Parasakti), the Supreme Verbum (Paravak), constantly pulsat­ing as ‘I* (aharp, vimarfa). And the question is nothing but Self­reflection. As A.G. puts it, “Tatpaiyanti-madhyamalmikd svdtmdnam eva vastutah parasarjividatmakarji vimtfati” The Devi while appear­ing as paJyanti and madhyamd knows Herself to be the Supreme Consciousness.Who is the questioner? A.G. reveals the following answer: “Aham evasdparavagdevi-rupaivasarva-vdcyavdcakavibhaktatayd evam uvdca.” “ I myself as the same Supreme Divine Speech-power undifferentiat­ed from all words (vdcaka) and their referents (vd<ya) spoke thus.”"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"48Para.- Trtiikd- VivaranaA.G. says: Zspam paramdrthamayatvat parameivarasya cittattvasya, yadeva avibhdgena antawastu sphuritarji, tadeva paiyantibhuvi vama- pada-vdkya-vibhajayisaya paramrstarji, madhyamdpade ca bhedena sthitaTfi oastupUrvakarfi sampannarp. yavat vaikharyantarji lanuttaram kalhaijC ityadi bhinm-mdyiya-varna-pada-vdkya-racandntarji.“So, the inner content i.e. question-answer which appears in the consciousness of the highest Lord in an undifferentiated way because of its being the highest truth, is thought of, in the pafyanti stage, with a desire to put it in the apportionment of letter, word and sentence, is posited, with a sense of separateness in the madhyamd stage, and is finally expressed, in oaikhari stage, in mdyiya form i.e. in gross speech consisting of letter, word and sentence.”At the pard or highest stage, there is neither question nor answer. There is simply Truth. It is only when it is to be revealed that it assumes the form of question and answer and is expressed in words.Finally, A.G. sums up the issue in the following words: Etava- deva abra tdtparyam—svatmd sarvabhavasvabhdvah svayarjiprakdfamdnah svdtmdnam eva svdtmdvibhinnena praJnaprativacanena prastf-pratioaktr- svdtmamayena ahantayd camatkurvan oimrfati.“This is all what is meant to be said here. Self who is the natural state of all existents, who is self-luminous, amusing Him­self with question-answer which is not different from Himself, and in which both the questioner (as Devi) and the answerer (as Bhairava) are only Himself, enjoys self-reflection.”So the divine dialogue is, in the ultimate analysis, a spiritual monologue, a sort of self-reflection, self-recollection.This also solves the enigma of the past tense. At the pard or supreme level, there is the eternal Truth which is timeless. So there is neither question nor answer, neither past nor present, nor future. It is only Reality shining in its own light. Reality, not static, but dynamic, pouring itself out (prasara, visarga) in mani­festation, throbbing with self-expression. It is only when the Truth of the pard level is to be described or revealed that it descends to the paiyanti level, embodies itself in the form of the Devi, and the divine dialogue starts. So ‘uvdca5 or reference to the past is logical, not chronological.2. The connotation of anuttara."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"A.G. has explained the concept of anuttara in sixteen ways from different points of view. In his Laghuvrtti, A.G. gives the gist of the connotation of anuttara which covers all points of view. “Uttar am utkfftam uparivarti, tacca jatfdpekfayd grdhakardpam. Tasya tu ciddtmanah svaprakdtasya na grdhakdntaram astlti anuttaratvam. Tena anuttararji sarjividrupam sadd sarvatrdvabhdsitarji pUrvdparadeia- kdlaoihinam anapahnvaniyam” (L.V., pp. 1-2).“Uttaram means higher, superior. In comparison to the insen­tient, it is the subject or experient. Hence uttaram means higher, superior. Since, of the self-luminous Consciousness, there is no other experient, since it is the universal Experient, therefore, is it anuttara. Therefore, anuttara is the supreme Consciousness, eternal, omnipresent, beyond time and space, undeniable Reality.”3. Kaulika-siddhi:A.G. interprets kaulika-siddhi from two points of view, the extroversive and the introversive.From the extroversive point of view, kaulika-siddhi means ‘kuldt dgatd siddhih\\ i.e. achievement of definite experience of objects like jar, a piece of cloth, etc., derived from kula. ‘Aw/a’ means 'prdnadchddiK prdna, body etc. So *kaulikasiddhidarji* means prdnadehddeh dgatd siddhih bhedaprdndndrji nilasukhddindrji nUcayarupd tdrji daddti iti, i.e. that which brings about definite and certain objective experience like blue and subjective experience like pleasure, through prdna, manas9 body etc. (to the empirical experient). Does the mind-body complex bring about this experience by itself? No, the mind-body complex is only the medium. It is anuttara9 the unsurpassable Reality that brings it about through the medium of mind-body. “Sarirddayo hi jhagiti anuttara-dhruva-visarga-virydvetena akdlakalitena prdnddimadhyamo- sopdndrohenaiva bhdvdndrji tathdtvanticaya-rupdiji siddhirji vidadhate.” Indeed it is the body, mind, etc. which through the penetration in them of the energy of Siva and Sakti, the energy that is beyond the sphere of time, that mounts the intermediate stair of prdna etc., that brings about the success in the form of the definite perception of the existing entities.”So kaulika-siddhi is definite perception through the medium of kula or mind-body complex, brought about by anuttara.From the introversive point of view i.e. from the point of viewAbhinavagupta 49"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"50Parâ-TrUikà-Viuaranaof the return movement, kaulika-siddhi means the following: *kula* means the totality of gross, subtle, and subtlest manifestation. This is only congealment of the Supreme Consciousness. 4Kule bhava kauliki siddhih’ i.e. it is tht siddhi pertaining to the total com­plex of gross, subtle manifestation. Siddhi here means 44tathdlva- dârdhyarp, p aridity a ànandarûparji-hrdayasvabhàva-parasaTjiüidàtmaka- fivavimariatâdàtmyarp, târfi siddhirji dadâti.”44 Siddhi or achievement is the acquisition of bliss by turning round to have a firm hold on that very principle, i.e., the Light of Universal Consciousness; in other words, identity with the perfect I-feeling of Siva who is the highest Consciousness and whose nature is spanda or the eternal expression of His delight in mani­festation.M It is anuttara which brings about such achievement.4. The concept of khecari-samatd :The main objective of Devi’s question is khecari-samatâ. This is the focal point round which the entire dialogue between the Devi and Bhairava revolves.This is a compound word, the components of which are ( 1 ) khecari and (2) samatd. We have, therefore, to understand the connotation of these two words. Let us, first of all, take up the word khecari. <Khen is the locative case of kha which means sky, void, or brahman. In this context, it means 4brahman* (the Absolute) and cari means that which moves about. As A.G. puts it, “Khe brahmani abhedarüpe sthitoâ carati iti khecari,” 44khecari is that which, while stationed in brahman or the Absolute in indistinguish­able unity, moves about.” In other woras, khecari is the dynamic divine consciousness. It is this divine Consciousness-Power that in manifestation appears in the form of the empirical experient, when she is known as vyomacari, in the form of the psychic apparatus, when she is known as gocari, in the form of the outer senses, when she is known as dikcari, in the form of the objective existents, when she is known as bhücari.At the empirical level, every experience, whether it is a m atter of perception such as sound, form, savour, etc., or a subjective state of mind, such as kâma (passionate longing) or krodha (wrath) appears as distinct in its own right, having nothing to do with the Universal Consciousness. When it is viewed in this light, i.e., as something in its own right, clamouring imperiously for its"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"Abhinavagupta51gratification then it is khecari-vaifamya i.e. contrary to the actual nature of khecari.When, however, all perceptions and subjective states of mind like kdma and krodha are regarded only as an expression of khecari or the Divine Consciousness, when they are viewed subspecie aetemitatis, then even these states throw back the mind of the aspirant in the sweet embrace of the Divine; then they serve only as liaison between the human and divine consciousness.As A.G. puts it, “Saiva khecari kama-krodhddirQpatayd vaifamyena lakjyate; tasydh samatdsarvatraiva paripurna-bhairavasvabhdvat.” “ When kdma and krodha are viewed only as aberration of the mind, then they constitute khecari-vaisamya or heterogeneity of khecari. The samatd or homogeneousness of khecari consists in viewing every object and state as the nature of integral Bhairava.Again “svarupdparijndnamayatadoaijamya-nivrttau maldbhavat krodha- mohadivfttayo hi paripurna-bhagavadbhairaoabhattdrakasaTjividdtmikd eva” “The uaijamya or disparateness of khecari is due to the ignorance of the essential nature of anuttara or the Absolute. When this ignorance is removed, then all limitations of the empirical con­sciousness disappear and with the disappearance of these limita­tions, even krodha, moha etc., appear as of the nature of the perfect divine Bhairava-consciousness.,,By khecari-samata, the aspirant feels divine Presence everywhere, in every object, in every state, even in passion and wrath. It is an attitude which has to be constantly maintained. His whole outlook on life is changed.In this context, A.G. examines the question of sex. Sex is usually considered to be only a biological phenomenon, only an animal instinct having nothing to do with the Divine, and is looked down upon with monkish disdain. A.G. turns his tdntric microscope upon the problem and examines it with shattering candidness. According to him, sex is only a microcosmic aspect of a macrocosmic divine creative energy. The thrill of sex is only a pale reproduction of the thrill of this divine creative energy. The divine creative energy radiates from the union of Siva and Sakti. It has to be borne in mind that Siva and Sakti are not two separate realities, but only aspects, the prakdla and vimaria aspect of one Reality, and their union is a sort of hermaphroditic or androgynous union."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"52Pará-TrÜikd- Vivar anaIn the mammalian kingdom, energy is stored in the central channel of the spinal column which is the generating, storing as well as the distributing centre. According to A.G. whatever is taken in, whether in the form of food or perception (e.g. sound, visual awareness of form, savour, contact, etc.) is converted first in the central channel in the form of ojas (vital energy); then this ojas is converted into seminal energy (pitya) which permeates the whole body. All reproductive and creative func­tions are performed by this energy, Whether it is the enjoyment of good food, beautiful scenery, sweet music, entrancing poem, the embrace of a dear one, everywhere it is this energy that is at play. It is the representative of the divine energy (khecari) on the physical plane. Even passion, anger, grief, owe their life to that divine energy. When that energy is used as a distinct form of mere physical, chemical, biological or psychic energy, then it is khecari-oai§amya, the heterogeneity, the disparateness of khecari. When everything is viewed and used as a form of divine energy, asA motion and spirit that impelsAll thinking things, all objects of all thoughtsAnd rolls through all thingsthen it is khecari-sdmya; then it is the homogeneousness of khecari. This khecari-sdmya leads to liberation, liberation from the octopus­like hold of the sensuous life.“Khecari-sdmyameva moksah. Tat ca anuttara-svarupaparijndnameoa satatoditarfi paramcSvarydh Hvdtmani sarjigha((asamdpattya ubhayauimar- fadnandarudhi.”“ Homogeneousness of the khecari-Sakti constitutes liberation. This homogeneousness of the khecari-iakti is due to the awareness of the essential nature of the anuttara which is constantly present and which arises from the bliss of the recognition of the comple­tion of the union of the divine Sakti with Siva.” It is not simply the knowledge of energy qua energy that brings about liberation, but the constant awareness of the energy in close embrace with the Divine that brings about the miracle.“Anumdtramapi avikaldnuttara-svarupdparijndnameva cittavfttindrp vaisamyarp. Sa eoa ca satpsarah.”"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Abhinavagupta53“ Even an iota of the ignorance of the nature of the integral armttara amounts to a contrary state of the mind. It is this con­trary state that constitutes transmigratory existence.’*How does khecari-sdmya bring about liberation? The answer is “by transformation of the mind.” Khecari-sdmya does not mean locking oneself up in a room and meditating for a few minutes. It means awareness of the Divine every minute in the hum-drum routine of life. When the divine Presence is felt constantly whether one is eating, drinking, sleeping or looking into office files, when the whole life becomes yoga, then is it khecari-samya. Then the mind of the aspirant is completely transformed. Khecari-sdmya is that wonderful alchemy which transmutes the gross psychic element of the aspirant into the solid gold of divine consciousness. There ensues the miracle of the dissolution of the human con­sciousness into the divine consciousness. Thenceforth, it is not he that lives, but it is his Lord that lives in him. In his L.V., A.G. interprets khecari-samatd as avikalpatmiji, purnatvarji and deoi- rUpatvam} as consciousness free of thought-construct, integral and divine.Tex tETAD GUHYAM MAHAGUHYAIyl KATHAYASVA MAMA PRABHOTranslation“TelJ me this secret, this greatest secret, O Lord who are my very Self (mama jna)” or: “Tell me (kathayasva), O my Lord (mama prabho) this truth which, though largely unhidden (mahd aguhyarfi), yet remains a secret.”Com m entaryTex tFrom guhyarji aprakafatvdt on p. 18, 1. 5 upto tasya dmantranamdt- mana eva on page 20,1. 19.TranslationThis is a secret mystery, because of its not being evident for though it abides in guhd (cavern) or mdyd in which the essential nature remains unknown, it is not evident.1 Moreover, it is"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"54Pard-TriSikd-Vivaranalargely unhidden, for it is known to everyone as the source of delight. (In its ultimate analysis), it is the goddess iuddhamdyd2 herself who abides undivided in the different states of knower (subject), knowledge, and knowable (object). The three-corner­ed one,3 however, becomes in the state of mdyd, percipient of differentiation which is excessively reflected therein. Mdyd also, being the source of the emanation of the universe, is actually divine knowledge (iuddhamdyd or iivavidya) itself. Therefore, according to the principle enunciated, this iuddhamdyd or divine knowledge, when not known in this aspect, is called mahdguha4 (the great cavern), because of her being three-cornered in the form of knower etc. (that appear as different) on account of her exalted state of nondifferentiation being concealed from view. In the Trika Sastra,6 she alone (viz. iuddhavidya mdyd) is, actually the object of worship as the three-cornered divinity.It has been (rightly) said:“ She is the three-cornered great spiritual truth (mahd-vidya) of the three aspects (Siva, Sakti and nara), the abode of all joy (whether external or cidananda), the substratum of universal ex­pansion i.e. both subjective and objective (visargapadarji), There­fore, she should be worshipped in all the aspects of pramdtd (knower), pramdna (knowledge and means of knowledge) and prameya (objects of knowledge). Similarly, “The one divine Light who permeates in pramdna, prameya (artha) and pramdtd never sets i.e. is ever present.”Now in this great cavern of Mdyd whose heart is full of pure divine wisdom (iuddhamdyd) which is the vast creative movement, the origin of the emergence of the entire universe, the return movement in the form of ma-ha-a that occurs by its own inherent dynamism of delight is, indeed, a great secret. By means of this secret it is intended to indicate that there is a return movement from objective manifestation indicated by ‘ma* (nara) and ‘Aa* (iakti) towards the essential nature (of the Self) which ends in the repose of Self-consciousness which signifies divine Freedom or in other words uninterrupted Bhairava-Consciousness indica­ted by V . O f manifestation, the delightful form of the energy of the natural, innate mantra known as pard vdk (the Supreme divine utterance) is I (aharji).

This anuttara aspect is the real I-feeling (aharji-bhdoa).This is a secret, a great mystery.In the process of expansion, the changeless, unsurpassable, eternal, reposeful venerable Bhairava, is of the form V which is the natural, primal sound, the life of the entire range of letter- energies (sakalakaldjala-jivanabhdtah) . He in the process of ex­pansion assumes the (ha’ form (the symbol of Sakti), for expansion (visarga) is of the form of ‘Aa* i.e. Kundalinl6 Sakti, and then he expands into a dot symbolizing objective phenomena (nara rdpena) and indicative of the identity of the entire expansion of Sakti7 (i.e. the entire manifestation) with Bhairava. (Thus the expansion is in the form of aharji or I. After this A.G. describes the return movement of manifestation in the form of ma-ha-a): Similarly, the lowest part or the last phase of objective mani­festation (iji or nara) with its three powers8 whose life consists of the trident of the pard, pardpard and apard takti, in its return movement through its union (viflejana) with that visarga, viz. ‘ha’ iakti, gets its entree into anuttara, i.e. V which is the funda­mental unalterable stage. This will be clarified proximateiy.Thus there is a-ha-m in expansion and ma-ha-a in withdrawal or return movement.(A.G. now sums up the mystery of mahaguhya:)In the ma-ha (mahe i.e. in the great Reality) which is the highest bliss as described earlier, that which is V according to the previously described principle, that ‘a’ is the mysterious secret. This is the great secret, this is the source of the emergence of the universe. Also by the delight emanating from the union of the two (viz. Siva and Sakti), it is clearly manifest (aguhya) inasmuch as it is the delight of all.9(Now A.G. interprets sva mama prabho:)‘Sva mama* means ‘my very self’. ‘Prabho’ is a form of address and means, by bringing about such wonderful manifoldness, you are indeed capable of appearing in any form. A form of address connotes the face-to-face presence of the addressed one towards the addressor or his identity with him. So, it has a"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"56Pard-Trifikd- Vivar anagreater connotation than an ordinary noun. As has been said, “An address has a greater connotation than a mere noun.” I have conclusively proved it in my ‘Sri Purvapaflcika*.10*Etat kathaya’ or ‘tell me this* means that though this truth is undifferentiated in the form of the Primal Creative Sound (pardvdk), yet kindly put it in a series of well-knit sentences in the stage of paJyanti, etc. As has been said earlier,“The Lord Himself assuming the role of teacher as Siva and disciple as SadaSiva etc.”It has been decisively shown earlier that there is identity bet­ween venerable pard and paJyanti etc.The word ‘mine* indicates an object (tdaqibhdva) related to an individual subject {pratyagdtma-sambandhitvasya). The secret that is implicit in this relation is that ‘m-ha-a* is really speaking In ‘this appears to me*, the quintessence of the idea of appear­ing is I-consciousness11 (yat bhasanaiji tasya vimarJah aharjibhdvai- kasarah). The I-consciousness (a-\\-ha-\\-m) from the point of view of the re turn-movement of the subject (bhdva-pralyupa-saijxha- ranamukhena) to the subject is m-\\-ha-\\-a as has been said earlier. As has been said,“The ascertainment of a definite object as ‘this* amounts to its relational reference to (lit. resting in) the essential nature of the Self. This reference constitutes I-consciousness (ahaqi-vimarJa).” At another place also (it has been said):“The determinate knowledge (adhyavasdya) in the form ‘this is a jar* transcends the limitation of name and form of the ja r and is (really speaking) a form of the jndnaJakti of the highest Sovereign, and shines as the Self (i.e. as one with the self), and not apart as an object denoted by the word ‘this* (I.P.K., I, 5, 20).It has been rightly said by revered Somananda in his com­mentary (on ParatriSika):“The vowel V is pure Siva” .The same idea has been described by me in detail.(Now A.G. gives another interpretation of ‘sva-mama’ taking it as one word, and by analysing it into (su-\\-a+mama).)‘Su’ means suffhu i.e. duly, aptly, V means avidyamdnam i.e. not present i.e. absent; ‘mama* means viivarji i.e. the universe.

In order to remove even the residual trace, the prefix €su’ has been used in the sense o f 4suffhu’ (duly, aptly ).As has been said by myself in a hymn :44T hat thought, viz. 4Nothing is mine* by which the senseless creatures are reduced to wretchedness incessantly, that very thought viz. 4Nothing is mine* means to me 4I am everything*.

The Sastra is called trika, because it deals with three aspects of Reality, viz. pramdtd-pramdna-prameya or icchd-jndna-kriyd or Siva-Sakti-/wra or para-pardpara-apara.6. In Sarada script ‘/w’ is written as s which resembles the form of Kundalinl.7. In the process of sfffi or manifestation, V symbolizing Siva expands into ‘A’ symbolizing ‘Sakti*, and terminates into tji or the anusvdra or dot over ‘/w’ which completes the process of the expansion or manifestation. The ‘bindu* (dot) or anusvdra over ‘ta ’ represents the fact that though Siva is manifested right upto the earth through Sakti, he is not divided thereby, he remains undivided; his expansion or manifestation in the form of Sakti remains identical with Him.8. The three Saktis are icchd, jnana and kriyd.

Hft is the supreme conscious base of all objective experiences like blue etc., and subjective experi­ences like pleasure etc., and also of the empirical experients condi­tioned by the body, prdna and buddhi. Ayd (plural of ay a) means knowledge of manifold, varied objects like jar, cloth etc., brought about by its own freedom. Sthd means this scintillating iakti abiding in them.

Kauliki is one who though immanent in all manifestation (subjects and objects) is herself akula i.e. transcends it (kule-bhav& akularupd kauliki).2. O r one who abides in ‘kula' but is 'akula?

The entire range of manifestation (kula) abides as such because of its being rooted in the light of akula (i.e. Siva).As has been said,“But by coming in contact with the power of the Self, an in­dividual becomes equal to that” (Sp. K. I. 8).Similarly:“ Resorting to that power (of spandatattva), the divinities 'mantra? etc. together with the sacred formulae which serve as their indicators, being endowed with the power of omniscience proceed to carry out their assigned functions towards the embo­died ones just as the senses of the embodied ones by resorting to the power of spanda proceed to carry out their (specific) functions” (Sp.

This has already been made clear before. The revered Somananda has also interpreted ‘hjdaya’ in his com­mentary as :“Aya or advancing (of the mind) i.e.jddna or knowledge in the hft or the Supreme centre of consciousness.”“Abhinava has composed this commentary on the question (of the Devi) which elucidates the essence of Trika for cutting asunder inevitably (hafhdt) the knot of mdyd existing in the ether of the heart, for the mind which is engrossed (saktarji) in des­troying for ever the mayic ignorance which is the root of all ill (aSiva)y the mind in which Siva has penetrated (Sivena nivetitaqi) and which is a thirst for drinking the nectar of the bliss of Siva.” In order to open the entire treasure pertaining to the question, Bhairava said. The sense of the past tense in ‘said’, has already been explained. W hat is the use of repeating it again? Bhairava is one who sustains and maintains the universe (indicated by tbha\\ from the root ‘M/*’, meaning to sustain, to maintain) and who sounds the great mantra of Self-consciousness, i.e. who has constantly the awareness of Self (indicated by 'rava9 or sound in Bhairava). Only here the predominance is that of Saktiman (i.e. Siva) from the point of view of the return movement (of His expansion) in the form of ma-\\-ha-\\-a which has already been described earlier.1 This will be made clearer further on. So, the following is the purport of the introductory part of the dialogue.The initial spanda of Sarpvit or divine Consciousness“The divine Supreme Consciousness-Power not different from Bhairava on the point of expansion according to Her essential nature, is said to be supreme icchdiakti (Voluntary Power). Her actual expansion as jfianaJakti (cognitive power) assumes the pardpard or paiyanti2 form and as kriyaJakti (conative power) the apard or madhyama3 form etc.4The nature of the question Now, the inquiry about the nature of pardSakti who expands in the form of the universe is said to be prabia or question. The Devi who is that very Sakti is the initiator of the question about Her (i.e. pardJakti).The consideration of the nature of this expansion is said to be"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"64Pard- TriHkd- Vivaranathe most excellent organ of speech (para-vaktra) and that consists of both question and answer.That very organ of speech constitutes the return movement pertaining to absorption beginning with 'm' i.e. thtjlva (empirical individual) who has limited consciousness (<aparasarjivitterdrabhya) reaching the inner iakti i.e. (pardpara-sarjimtti) 'ha' (antastardrji) and finally getting absorbed in the compact mass of bliss of the highest consciousness—anuttara or 'a' at once {parasarjivid-ghand- nanda-saqihdrakaranam muhuh).Bhairava in whom the entire expansion of the universe is in­volved inwardly abides as the perpetual responder. As the dual process of expansion and retraction is beyond time, therefore, this question-answer is the truth that is of uniform nature.6 Tliis is para sarjibandha6 associated with anuttara. My revered guru Sambhunatha has already expounded it as the pith and core of Trika Sastra.Notes1. In sjrsfi or expansion, it is Sakti who has the predominance, in sarjihdray or the return movement, it is Saktiman or Siva who has the predominance.2. Paly anti retains the truth of unity of the para Sakti and con­tains the germ of diversity of the apard Sakti. Hence she is called parapard i.e. para+apard (the supreme cum non-supreme).3. Madhyama is that stage of expression in which diversity has commenced in a subtle form. Hence she is called apard or non- supreme.4. ‘etc.* includes vaikhari in which there is complete diversity.5. There is no difference between the question and answer at this stage. The question itself is the answer. In the empirical level of reality, the questioner is one, the responder is another; the question occupies one moment of time, the answer occupies another. At the empirical level, there is succession in expansion and retraction. At the met-empirical level, it is akramay succession- less, beyond time. That level is the domain of eternity—time­lessness.

Here, it is taken in the latter sense. So mahdbhdgd means ‘she who being adored according to the instruction described and about to be described gives the great divine power*.(Third interpretation of mahdbhdgd, the word ‘bhdga* being used in the sense of portion)Mahat — the great one i.e. Anasrita Siva who is known as the great one; bhdga =*a portion, a fraction. So mahdbhdgd means she of whom the celebrated great one, i.e. Anasrita Siva is just a portion, for she enfolds within herself the initial one also of the entire thirty-six categories.(Fourth interpretation of mahdbhdgd)She whose portion is mahdn i.e., buddhi category. Mahan has been called a portion from the distributive or analytic point of view (‘oibhagakalapeksi’). It is the divine Sakti herself who is a compact mass of consciousness that is called buddhi in the m atter of settling in their proper forms of different objects and actions brought about by her own freedom. As has been said by revered Somananda:“ In the sphere of differentiation (aparasthitau) i.e., at the level of man where differentiation prevails, she {pardiakti) is known as buddhi which in its subtle all-pervasive condition is always the innate (sahajam) universal consciousness of Siva.’* (S.D.I, 26-27).(Fifth interpretation of mahdbhdgd)*Bhdga:* may mean difference or separation. By the ‘matup’ suffix, the word ‘bhdga’ means that which has difference or sepa­ration i.e. a separate entity. In separate entities, ascertainment is made by differentiating one thing from another.

It is uni­versally admitted that there is a flow of the attribute of sattva in the case of the pleasant states of buddhi, for the pleasant states of buddhi are of the form of dharma (righteousness), ailoarya (power or sovereignty), jhàna (knowledge), and vairâgya (freedom from worldly desires). If one gets entrance into the deepest layer i.e. in the prathamâbhàsa or the initial, indeterminate state even in the pleasant aspect of buddhi, then through that he will find himself perpetually in the domain of supreme bliss underlying that aspect.(Sixth interpretation of mahàbhâgâ)Mahâbhâgâ may be analyzed into maha+â+bhâga. *Maha9 means jagadànanda i.e. that bliss which is entirely uninterrupted, perfect, integral, independent, expression of divine Freedom; ‘<2* means ‘isat9 or slight; *bhâga’ means fraction. So mahâbhâgâ means the Devi of whose jagadànanda, bliss, only a slight fraction is available (to people). Whatever happiness there is in life, that is possible only by entering the Universal Creative Energy ( visargaJaktau) who is the highest abode of the Supreme bliss. It appears in small limited measure (in life) only because of the visargafakti not being realized in her internal essential aspect.Bhaîîanàràyana has given expression to the same idea (in his Stavacintàmani) :“All the delight that is noticed in all the three worlds (viz. bhava> abhava and atibhava) is only a drop of whose delight, to that God, the ocean of delight do I bow.” (St. C. Verse 61 ).(Seventh interpretation of mahâbhâgâ)Mahâbhâga may be interpreted as ‘ma-ha-a bhâgah yasyâh sâ mahâbhâgâ* i.e. she who betakes herself to that form which has been declared by the previous principle as ma-ha-a is mahâ- bhagâ.

Abiding as she does in the form of the power of hearing, she has that sover­eign power (svatantrya) which consists in effecting congruous and suitable connexion by blending all sound in a meaningful whole— the sound which is clear to the ear but is only a succession of a mass of confused vibrating syllables. Without this power of effect­ing congruous connexion, an experient though hearing parti­cular words lost in confused buzzing sound says, in common usage ‘I am not hearing them ’.An object of sense-perception which is merely confused buzzing sound without its being blended in a sensible whole is also said to be ‘heard’. This is the common usage. But in reality, the con­fused sound only enters the ear; it does not enable the listener to grasp the words denoted by the sound and therefore it remains only a confused mass of sound (tatha bhavet), for being different from the words, it is merely buzzing sound. When it is intended to enunciate the words, then there cannot be the production of confused sound, for there is no ground for it. When there is the desire to speak sensibly, then there is the enunciation of clear words, and with the enunciation of clear words, there is no occa­sion for indistinct, confused sound of the same kind. Those very words when they are not clearly enunciated and so cannot be knit into a meaningful whole are said to be mere confused sound. For one attentively intent on knitting the words in a sensible whole, there may be clear comprehension to some extent. There­fore in such a case, it is the congruous connexion of the words which can be of use. It is the goddess paraJakti (the supreme creative power) who brings about the congruous connexion. It has been rightly said,“ M antra, Man tramaheS vara etc. resorting to that power etc.” (Sp. K. II, 10). In fact “hears, sees, speaks, seizes” etc. are only aspects of the goddess alone.

W hat remains in this world (which is not known by the Self)?” (Katha U. II, 3).Hearing does not mean simply lending the ear to some con­fused, loud utterance of words. Siva Himself thus laid down in Svacchanda Sastra on the occasion of the division of japa (repeat­ing a mantra in a murmuring to n e):“T hat which is heard only within oneself is known zsupdrjiiu japa.” In this the Self alone hears in madhyamd stage, not any­body else.’3 This is what is said.When the organ of utterance (sthdna) and the mode of arti­culation {prayatna) are distinctly marked, then with the junction and separation of the teeth and the lips, even words uttered in very low tone may be audible to a person sitting very close and there would arise the contingency of the japa becoming salabdai.e. japa with audible words. It has been said:“T hat which is audible to others is known as safabda japa”. In updrpfu japa (atra), there is no particular advantage even to a man who is sitting close by, for it will be inaudible to him* Another person may notice the movement of the tongue and the junction of the lips (of the performer of the japa), yet he cannot hear him, for the words are not audible externally (varnasya bahirdlmald- bhdbhdvdt), for the japa is being performed only in the madhyamd stage. Only the performer can hear it (dtmand eva fravanatji sydt).By the impact of air, clear words are effected, but the impact is not so strong as to make it audible externally. Even the move­ment of lips in this japa does not enter the stage of marked utter­ance of words, but is confined to itself till that japa lasts. If the movement of lips, hands, etc., occurring at that time (i.e. at the tim e of japa) is stopped and in its place there is distinct articula­tion by means of the organs of utterance, and in the effectuation of words, if there is soft or loud production of sound in succession so as to be audible near or far, then it is, in every way, heard by others. Then it will be sound of the level of oaikhari. Enough of elaboration of this incidental reference.Notes1. Pardbhaffdrikd is the very power of learning.

W hat is meant to be said is that in updrjifu japa, even the aspirant carrying on the japa cannot hear the mantra with his physical ears. ‘He hears it within himself* only means that he experiences the m antra as a spanda or throb of his self-experience.Ex positionThe Devi is none other but the Sakti of Bhairava Himself. A.G. gives seven reasons why the Devi is called mahdbhagd. Now A.G. says that there is an esoteric meaning in asking her to hear. She is the power of hearing itself. While others cannot make out anything from confused, buzzing sound even though it is heard by the ear, she can always make out the sense of all sound whether it is clearly pronounced or is only indistinct, confused sound.Tex tFrom saiva paramekari on p. 25, 1. 22 upto spiu devi iti on p. 28, 1.11.TranslationThat very supreme goddess who hears everything has by the form of address (viz./ O goddess, listen*), clearly been indicated as Sakti. Everything in the universe is of the form of nara> Sakti and Siva.1 Therefore everything in the universe consists of the triad. That, w'hich is only confined to itself (as an object), is insentient and comes chiefly under the category of nara, as for instance, ‘the jar is lying (on the ground).* The above has refer­ence only to the third person (prathama purusa) which is left to be supplied after the first and second person (kfah).T hat which appears even as ‘this’, when addressed, becomes completely enveloped with the I-feeling of the addressor. The ‘this’ which is different from the addressor, when addressed as ‘you’, becomes a form of ‘Sakti\\ In ‘you are standing’ this is the meaning of the second person, and the principle of addressing viz. as I am standing, even so this is standing. Ordinarily, the I (aharpbhava) of the other person is different from the ‘I* of the"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"Abhinavagupta71person \\vho is to address, but in the process of addressing, the addressor assimilates the delightful autonomy of the addressed characterized by I-feeling to his own, and considering it as iden­tical with the uninterrupted delight of his own I-feeling starts addressing him. In this light, he is addressing him in the true sense of the second person. This sense in which the addressor and the addressed, though different, become one in the addressing is indicative of the pardpard goddess (whose characteristic is identity in diversity).(On the other hand) in the freedom of the uninterrupted de­light of I-consciousness completely independent of any reference to anything eke, expressed in the form T am standing’, it is in every respect (sarvathd) the revered para (highest) šakti1 that is at work. In that lies the pre-eminence of the first person. As has been said, “Since I transcend the perishable and ako the imperishable, therefore, am I known as the highest purusa i.e. as the first person.” (Bh. G. XV, 18).Here the verb ťasmV (am) has been used with reference to T , the first person, to indicate its pre-eminence over both the perishing and the imperkhable.Here in every case, it is not the limited I identified with the body that is referred to. The limited I (identified with the body) being an object of the senses is obviously incompatible with that (the real, unlimited I). Thus this (i.e. unlimited) I is of the nature of the self-luminous Siva. Therefore of the (universal, un­limited) Consciousness (bodha) which is self-luminous, there is neither any diminution nor augmentation. Both diminution and augmentation being of the nature of aprakdša cannot be an aspect of the Light of Consciousness (lit., cannot enter consciousness). The middle state which k only relative to the state of diminution and augmentation is ako nothing. Therefore the notion of I which is inseparable from the universal consciousness of Siva (tad* bodhdmcchcdarupa.) and free from all relativity is not applicable to situations of augmentation, diminution, and the middle state bet­ween these indicated by thisness, i.e. objectivity and absence of objectivity (i.e. the state of šúnya or void). The notion of you i.e. the second person which, though indicative of separateness, is actually similar to that of I. “Therefore both you and I are des­cribed as genderless” (i.e. they are used for both genders). The"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"72Pard-TrUikd-Vivaranaapplication of number etc., i.e. dual and plural of these words according to the usage depending on the enumeration or differ­ence of the body is appropriate from the point of view of pard- pard iakti in the dual and apard-fakti in the plural. The difference determined by the Sakti of the Divine Freedom is considered as one in the case of several bodies which can be traced in such usages as ‘we two, you two, wc all, you all.”Augmentation etc., being associated with the body cannot be even figuratively employed in the case of consciousness, for diminution and augmentation cannot be reasonably applied to consciousness.“ Everything is an epitome of all” . According to this uni­versal principle, even the insentient third persons (nardtmano jatfd api) shedding their insentiency can become entitled to the use of second and first person {Sakti-Saivarupabhdjo bhavanti), for instance, in ‘listen, O mountains’, the third person has been treat­ed as second person, in ‘of mountains, I am M eru’, the third person has been treated as the first person, in ‘I, Caitra am speak­ing’ the first person has been treated as the third person. The second person which pertains to iakti, can by shedding its iakti character, acquire the aspect of the third person, for instance, in ‘you whose fear has vanished, are fortitude (lit. the power of fortitude) itself’, ‘you’ not being used as a form of address has appropriately acquired the aspect of the third person. Usage like €bhavdn’ (you) with particular, subsequent use of words like *padah, guravah’ (revered one) which are used only in the case of another person, being used as third person which is characteristic of nara is fairly recognized. The second person also which is cha­racteristic of iakti, shedding its particular use acquires the aspect of first person which is characteristic of Siva, for instance, “ O dear friend (female friend), O loved one, thou art I ” is an accept­ed usage. The first person also characteristic of Siva, shedding its aspect of first person which is cit, betakes to the aspect of the third person characteristic of nara or second person characteristic of iakti. In the following expressions, “Who am I ?” “This one am I,” “ O I ” , “Fie to me,” “ O h to me” etc., the uninterrupted autonomy of I is subdued, and it is chiefly the separate ‘this one’ that becomes predominant. In such a case, it is as if separateness characteristic of apard iakti, in other words, nara rdpa or third"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"Abhinavagupta73person that becomes prominent. In ‘O I ’ etc., Siva contacts the throb of pardpard iakti (i.e. enters the sphere of second person). But in such cases, the preceding state acquires the succeeding state without transgressing its previous nature.3 Thus the third person characteristic of nara can clearly mount to the stage of the second (the Sakti stage) and even to the first person (i.e. Siva stage) but the contrary course of mounting cannot be admissible.4Each of this triad without giving up its nature, becomes of three forms, viz. singular (Siva-£/u5oa), dual (Sakti-Mdwz) and plural (nara-bhdva). It has been said,“ One thing becomes dual, and after becoming dual, it becomes plural.” O f one and the same thing, when it is only one, then it connotes the nature of Siva, since there is no other as counterpart. When there is a counterpart, then it is the nature of Sakti. In the case of many denoting difference, there is the nature of nara. Thus we have cgha(ah\\ one jar denoting oneness, and thus Siva- bhaoa, ‘ghafau’, two jars, denoting Sakti-M<i0tf, 'ghafdh', many jars, denoting the aspect of nara. In a copulative compound (dvandva samdsa) in which the members, if uncompounded, would be in the same case and connected by the conjunction ‘and*, we have an example of many things forming a sort of unity, thus denoting Siva, e.g. 4ghalapafapdfdnah* (jar, cloth, stones). In a verb also, e.g. Uiffhati* (one is standing or sitting) denotes Siva: Uiffhatah9 (two are standing or sitting) denotes iakti, Uiffhanti9 (many are standing or sitting) denotes nara. In fact, the entire manifesta­tion is the expansion of kriydiakti brought about by one alone (i.e. by Siva). As has been said:“ By reducing the many (i.e. the nara-rupa and iakti-rdpa to one (i.e. Siva-rfi/w) who is there who will not be liberated from bondage?”Therefore, when the third person (nara)> the second person (Sakti) and the first person (Siva) are used together, simultan­eously there is the absorption of the lower in the higher and higher, because it is the higher that contains the truth of the lower, e.g. in *sa ca tvarp, ca tiffhathah (he and you are standing), the number of the verb ‘sthd’ (to stand) is used in the second person which indicates that the third person (nara) has been absorbed in the second (iakti). In *sa ca tvarji ca aharji ca tiffhamah9 (he, you and"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"74Pard-Trttikd- Vioara naI arc standing), the verb Uiffhdmah' which is the plural number of the verb in the first person has been used even for the third and the second person which is indicative of the fact that the third and second person are absorbed in the first. It is only this state of complete understanding, the essence of the residual traces of the innate, perfect I-consciousness which is followed by the grammarians in their descriptive rules. Similarly, even in local dialects, e.g., the language (e.g. Pali) used by the Buddhists or used in Andhra or Dravidian region, this manner alone of speech and meaning (lit. expressed by words) which originally follows the instinctive feeling of the heart, conveys by its delightful impression this form (viz., the form of naray Sakti and Siva) of understanding.As has been said by myself:“T hat is no speech which does not reach the heart directly.” So in every way, this kind of comprehension is innate. As has been said: “ W ithout the form o fnara, Sakti and Siva (tair), there is neither word, nor meaning, nor mental movement.” In Malini- vijayatantra also, it has been said:c<As the one Sakti of Siva (iambhoh faktirekaiva iafikari) abides, presiding over the entire class (of words, in first, second and third person), even so has she been related unto you.” (M.V. I ll, 34).In Tantrasamuccaya also, it is said:“This universe is established always and is in every way in­volved in third person (nara), second person (Sakti) and first person (Siva) both in the dealings of worms and the all-knowing.”Thus this universe consisting of the third, second and first person (nara-iakti-Sivatmakaiji) has been explained according to the teaching of the’traditional clear comprehension. This all- inclusive order of experience {samaijisahah pratipattikramah) con­sisting of the third, second and first person has been manifested by the free will of the highest Lord. So enough of elaboration of a topic which can appeal to the hearts of only a few people who have received the teaching from a guru, who are of refined taste, who are well-read (lit., who have heard from the learned people a great deal), and who have been purified by the descent of the Supreme grace. So, ‘listen, O goddess’ has been explained."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"Abhinavagupta75Notes1. In the context of trika or triad, viz., Siva, Sakti and nara, ‘nara' represents all objective phenomena from the earth upto mdyd; ‘Sakti’ represents Suddhavidya, l£vara, and Sadariva, and ‘Siva* represents Siva and Sakti.2. In the first person, it is the pardSakti that is at work. From the point of view of the triad, first person is the state of Siva. In the second person, it is the pardpard Sakti that is at work. So, the second person, from the stand-point of the triad is the state of ¿akti. In the third person, it is the apard Sakti that is at work. So the third person from the standpoint of the triad is the state of nara.3. The meaning is that the Siva-aspect abides in the Sakti- aspect, and the Sakti-aspect abides in the rcara-aspect. Thus the Siva-aspect pervades all of them.4. The nara-rdpa first rises to the Sakti-rupa and then to Siva- rUpa. It cannot rise to Siva-rtfpa, leaving aside the intervening Sakti-rUpa.ExpositionA.G. has tried to show that when Bhairava in the first person addresses the Dev! in the second person, it should be understood that the Devi is not different from Bhairava. In order to prove this point, he has given a number of examples of the usage of speech in which the second person is assimilated to the first, and the third to the second. A.G. has been at pains to prove that these kinds of usages in speech in all languages are not a matter of mere accident or convention, but serve as a pointer to the metaphysical truth, viz. that Siva and His Sakti are one, that just as in gram­mar there is first the singular number, then the dual and finally the plural, that just as in speech, there is firstly the first person, then the second and finally the third, even so in manifestation, the singular number and the first person are symbolic of Siva, the dual number and the second person are symbolic of Sakti and the plural number and third person are symbolic of nara or objective phenomena. Further, just as the third person has to surrender itself to the second, and the second to the first in order that they may be used together, so also thz prameya (object) or nara has to surrender itself to pramdna (knowledge) or Sakti, to be known, and"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"76Parà-Trliikâ-Vioaranapramàna has to surrender itself to pramàtâ (knower) for its final fulfilment.CommentaryFrom uttarasyâpi on p. 28,1. 11 upto ityuktam on p. 33,1. 21.TranslationThat which is said, viz. how it is the anuttara of uttara is the answer of Bhairava.(Different senses of uttarasydpyanuttararji)1. As has been said before (viz., everything is the epitome of all), the proximate one (uttaramapi) is also identical with the non- proximate (anuttara). It cannot exist otherwise. Therefore, the proximate also setting aside its character as proximate becomes non-proximate. The text reads, 'uttarasyâpi anuttaraijC. * Uttarasya* is the 6th or the genitive case, and the genitive case is (also) used in the sense of 4anâdara’ i.e. ignoring or setting aside i.e. absence of consideration or dis-regard. S o 4uttarasyâpi anuttararfC may mean the proximate setting aside its character as proximate becomes non-proximate. Even this difference (of the proximate one i.e. from the earth upto andirita Siva’ acquires this character (of diff­erence) by resting wholly on the undifferentiated (i.e. anuttara).l As has been said in the following :(This is a difficult verse. The following is its prose order:)44Paravyaoasthdpi pare tdoat karturji na iakyate yâvat parah na âtmi- kftah : y atah parah pare buddhah”) ” “ Even the ascertainment of difference {paraoyaoasthd) cannot be made in the different objects (pare tdvat na karturji iakyate) so long as the Supreme is not assimilated to oneself {yâoat parah na dtmikftah), since the different object {parah) is known {buddhah) only in the Supreme {pare) i.e. the different object has its raison d'être only in the Supreme.”2. Uttara may mean the posterior. S o 4uttarasyâpi anuttœrarri may mean, “ even the posterior part of the book cannot offer its answer.” 23. Even of my answer given in the paiyanti stage which is the first expansion of pard, this anuttara is the highest truth i.e. this non-answer {anuttara) or silence is the highest truth."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"Abhinavagupta774. Uttar a may also mean the phenomena—desirables, knowables, and actions—prompted by the trident, viz. icchd-Sakti, jnana-Sakti and briyd-fakti. Anuttara is that stage where all the above and uttara cease.W hat after all is that anuttara? The answer is ‘that is anuttara from which proceeds kaulika vidhi*. Kaulika has been previously explained as ‘that which is of the nature of kula and akula*3; vidhi means ‘the great manifestation* (mahdsrsfi)4 or the tattoos from andirita Siva upto hiddhavidyd (fuddhadhvd). ‘Vidhi' is socalled because of its being executed. Now anuttara is that from which proceeds this ‘great manifestation* i.e. mahds^fi4, which enfolds within itself hundreds of crores of unlimited mdyiya (phenomenal) creations. As has been said, “That from which proceeds every­thing.” So, this universe consisting of cit-pramatd i.e. Sunyapramdtd^ citta i.e. purya§\\aka pramdtd, prdna i.e. pranapramatdy deha i.e. deha- pramdtd (i.e. four kinds of experients), pleasure and pain i.e. subjective experiences, senses i.e. means of experience, the five elements and jar etc., i.e. subtle and gross objects of experience abide without difference in one, supreme, divine Consciousness as simply form of consciousness (bodhdtmakena rdpena). Though the divine universal consciousness never ceases to exist, for it ceasing, there will be the contingency of universal darkness, yet there does not exist difference consisting of reciprocal absence (of objects), for all objects are omnifarious in that state (vtiodt- mdna eva bhdvdh). If all things were not situated in that universal Bhairava Consciousness, then even the initial indeterminate perception which is of use in urging the senses towards their ob­jects would not be there. Therefore, the entire multitude of exis- tents exists there, without the appearance of appropriate objecti­vity (fit., thisness), identically with I-consciousness only, void of all differentiation. There is absolutely no difference there what­soever. In that universal Bhairava consciousness, the entire mani­festation [kaulika vidhi) lies clearly (spajfahsan) at rest.All this (universe) consisting of thirty-six categories, though created by Siva who being of supreme Sakti, is of the nature of universal creative pulsation [sdmdnya spanda) rests in that consci­ousness itself in its own form which is predominantly Sakti i.e. characterized by particular creative pulsation (vtieja spanda).6 This is what is meant by the inherence of objects in their own"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"78Pard- Trilikd- Vivarananature which is consciousness. As has been said “ In which all things exist.”This multitude of objects (tadetat) of the nature of Siva and Sakti, Siva whose characteristic is universal creative pulsation (sdmanya spanda5) and Sakti whose characteristic is particular creative pulsation (vtiesarupam) though only of one form (ekdtma- mapi) has been determined separately by the Lord only as an aid for teaching, but really speaking it is only one, viz. anuttara who is the essence of the creative energy viz., the autonomous I- consciousness.W hat is the nature of that in which this process of creation (kaulika vidhi) is inherent? Bhairava says, “ It inheres in the ether of my heart” (mama hrdaya-vyomni). Now heart (hfdaya) in this context means the receptacle of all the existents.Existents from blue etc. upto worms are, in their final analysis, simply nothing unless they rest in consciousness (<cidarjiia-anivisfd- ndiji). ‘Blue’ etc. belong really to the experient. The essence of blue etc. consists in its being incorporated in uninterrupted I-consciousness, as in ‘Blue appears to me” .(‘Mama hfdayavyomni' may be interpreted in many ways)First interpretation: In 'mamahrdayavyoma', 'hrday a' means the receptacle of innumerable objects like blue etc.; 4vyoma' means that where the universe of particular objects (mamakdrdtmakarji viSvam) is ‘vita' i.e. is held wholly in an implicit manner in that ether which is devoid of all difference (iunyaruparji).Second interpretation: ‘Mama' means ‘of the consciousness which expresses itself both in difference (apara-sarjwitti) and non­difference (para-saijivitti) ; ‘hrdayam' means the final resting placei.e. I—‘aharji'. The vyoma of that also means, by the form of the return movement of aharji i.e. ma+ha+a, the nara form i.e. the objective phenomena represented by ‘ma' being dissolved in the dot i.e. the anusvdra over ‘ha'y enters the kundalini iakti represented by the letter 'ha' and finally entering the V letter which represents the integral, unimpeded delight of anuttara, which is identified with all, it becomes that (i.e. anuttara). This is the ether of my heart. Therefore, that from which this universe proceeds, that in which it rests that one alone, the eternal, the one whose nature cannot be veiled which is self-luminous (prathamdnarfi), which can"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"Abhinavagupta79never be denied {anapahnavdniyam) is the anuttaray the unsurpass­able Absolute. As has been said:“ Inasmuch as nothing can veil His nature, there cannot be the obstruction anywhere of his in whom all this world rests and from whom it has come forth.” (Sp. K. I, 2).Even if He (Siva) is supposed to be obstructed by a cover (e.g., mdyd), He still shines by His freedom in the form of that cover itself,6 and thus the Lord is always of the nature of knowledge and activity. The particle ‘yat* (of which yasmin sarvarji or yatra an dyatah sarvarji o ryasmdt are different forms) conveys the sense of all the cases; on account of its fitness of relation with another sentence (e.g. idarji sarvarji sthitarji)f it stands here in a special position i.e. it is used in the sense of the locative case {yasmin paramafiva) i.e. the Supreme Siva in whom it rests, and on ac­count of its fitness with another sentence (e.g. idarji sarvarji nirgatarji), it is also used in the sense of the ablative case {yasmdt parama- fivat) i.e. the Supreme Siva from whom it emanates. This is the clear, direct sense. That which is the source of the expansion of universal manifestation {kaulikah sfffi-prasarah), in the sense of the ablative case {yasmat ca nirgatam or yatah sarvam), that which abides in the ether of my heart, in the sense of the loca­tive case {yatra sthitarji or yasmin sarvarji), that indeed is anuttara.Thus having established that the anuttara is the centre of both the expansion and the absorption of the universe, Bhairava now establishes the expansion, which is technically called kriyafakti- visarga which means visarga or external expansion of the spanda of kriydiakti which is of the nature of vimaria. He begins with ‘katha- ydmV (i.e., I am telling you).T hat very aspect of expansion is a-ha-m (I), para (supreme), anuttara (unsurpassable). Even in its regular succession of ex­ternal expansion consisting of palyanti and madhyama denoting par apard Sakti, and vaikhari denoting apard faktiits unbroken conti­nuity is the highest truth. *KathaydmV means: ‘I am expressing it by the use of appropriate names the series of utterances upto vaikhari that arise from the venerable pard Sakti and are expressed in varied scriptural and worldly forms. It has been said, “ Who is everywhere” .Whether in the initial stage of pard or the final stage of apard i.e. vaikhari, both of which are the expression of revered pardfakti and"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"80Pard-Trliikd-Vioaranaalso in its stage of expansion in the form of pardpard i.e. in paiyanti and madhyamd forms, it is throughout the display of the immutable anuttara. Venerable Somananda has also said the same thing in his commentary on Paratrlsika. “Kathaydmi\" means “ I (Bhai- rava) say owing to the eagerness of the enquiry; that it is I who being present as Consciousness in all, declare this.” It is this explanation which my heart, purified by the reasoning of the guruy teaching of the scripture, and personal experience, (yuktyu- padeiasarjiskdraih) has fully accepted.(Now A.G. gives different interpretations of sadyah)First interpretation: The nature of the highest Lord is said to be 'sadyah'. 'Sadyah' may be analyzed into sat+yah meaning 'yah parameioarah tat sat' i.e. what the greatest Lord described as Bhairava, akulay anuttara, dhruva is, that is all this sat or existence, in other words kaulikavidhi or the plan of creation. (So sadyah means—He who is this whole universe). No object what­soever can exist apart from the veritable Bhairava who is both prakdia or Light and vimaria or the consciousness of that Light as I.In all matters, there are three terms, sattd (existence), sarfi- bandha (relation), and arthakriyd (purpose). Even though they are considered to be different (pardbhimatdndmapi) by others, the raison d'itre of ail of them is sattd i.e. being (sattahetuta). Without sattd (being), there cannot be the possibility of even sarjtbandha or arthakriyd (sattd-ayoge tathatoa-anupapatteh). If one requires to find out another being of being or another purpose of purpose, then there would be the contingency of regressus ad infinitum. Sattva or eternal being is that by which alone do other things derive their life and the apparent form (prakdiamayata) of which is brought into being by its dimaria. T hat being is Bhairava Himself full of the I-feeiing which is the quintessence of the consciousness of His Freedom.72. O r sadya may be interpreted as 'sati-sadrupe yasyatiyatnarji karoti i.e. he in his nature as sat i.e. as Siva exerts, i.e. is active, for Siva is the very life of the power of activity. This sadya may be treated as neuter gender by adding the suffix kvip. Some elderly teachers have adopted the reading sadyat (sat+yat) instead of sadyah. It has been said in Siddhasantana:8"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"Abhinavagupta81“The power that shines in appearances (such as jar, cloth etc.) is sat itself i.e. Siva.”In Spandakarika also it has been said:“That (Reality) is sat in the highest sense.” (Sp. K. I, 5)Venerable Somananda has also said:“T hat which is sat or Siva is the highest reality (paramdrthah). Since the universe is pervaded by that highest Reality, therefore the universe is also Siva. Thus His nature has been declared. It has been rightly said, “ He who is all” .”(A.G. now comments on kaulikasiddhidarji)The expansion of the power of activity of this very anuttara is being explained by the statement kaulikasiddhidarp:The word ‘kaulika’ has already been explained. Its siddhi or perfect fulfilment is now being explained. T hat by which the being so i.e. the true nature (tathatoa) of kaulika is fixed and cor­roborated, is its perfect fulfilment i.e. anuttara is the true fulfil­ment of kaulika vidhi, the creative process. In that highest ex- perient, viz. the unsurpassable divine Consciousness, everything— kula and akula i.e. Siva and Sakti—becomes that very Conscious­ness where all that is perceived and known acquires the firmness of that very nature itself (pratiyamanarji sarvarji tathatmdardhyarp bhajate).It has been said:“Trika is higher than the highest.” 8At another place also, it has been said:“The Saiva system is higher than the Vedic, the left-hand doctrine is higher than Saiva, the right hand doctrine is higher than the left; the Kula system is higher than the right-hand doctrine; the M atam is higher than the Kula, the Trika is higher even than that; in fact, it is the highest of all.” 9In Ni^acara10 Sastra also, we find the following:“The teacher who has been initiated as deary a in the left-hand path and is considered to be knowing the supreme truth (accor­ding to left-hand path) has to undergo the ceremony of con­secration in Bhairava mdrga, he also has to receive fresh initiation in the Kula mdrga, he wh£ has received initiation in Kula has to"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"82Pard-TriEkd- Vivar anareceive initiation in Kaula mdrga and even he who has received initiation in Kaula mdrga has to receive fresh initiation in the Trika mdrga”11In Sarvacara12 also, it has been said:“The teacher who has received initiation in the left hand path and is considered to be knowing the Supreme truth has still to undertake the purificatory ceremony successively in the various Bhairava systems, viz. Kula, K aula and Trika.”This alone is the mode of Siva that in all the stages whether of the common man, the Veda, the Saiva Siddhanta, the left hand path, the right hand path, the Sakta system (Kula) and the M ata system, it is He that abides as the highest expericnt. As has been said:“ He who is eternally all, to Him, the Omnifarious one do I bow.”So, “ ail this is verily the anuttara”—proclaiming this as the central point of his thesis, venerable Somananda has said in his commentary on Paratrisika: “W hat occasion is there for much talk, everything is anuttara, because of being anuttara”Pointing out how others have expounded this, leaving aside such (lucid) exposition would amount to a fault. Though a dialogue carried on with those who are without any knowledge of grammar, logic, traditional teaching and have no personal experience would be shameful, yet in order to bring to the know­ledge of sensible people the sample of their exposition, I am put­ting down here their explanation of anuttara. This is how it begins: “By the use of the words anuttara etc. in one and a half verses, the question pertaining to Siva has been put. In hfdayasthd tu yd iaktih’ the question pertains to Sakti. In that part of the book which contains the answer, viz., “Sfnu devi...uttarasyapyanuttararji” the explanation offered is: “Listen about uttara, i.e. the expansion of Sakti, and also about anuttarai i.e. the expansion of Siva.” In this case, if the explanation is from the point of view of Trika, there arises the contingency of a third question regarding nara. If the explanation is from the point of view ofydmala, even there, it is not two separate beings—Siva and Sakti whose connexion is known as ydmala so that a separate question about each could be justified."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"Abhinavagupta83The meaning of 'atha' also (occurring in the subsequent verse) would not fit in. O f two homogeneous realities, the word atha indicates the definite priority of one and the definite immediate sequence of the other. Without the ascertainment of the nature of uttara (i.e. Sakti), a question about anuttara (i.e. Siva) is unreasonable.In some old books, another such verse is also noticed: “ O Lord, I have heard the description of the spiritual knowledge pertaining to trika and so through your favour I have also acqui­red knowledge pertaining to uttar a ”Therefore that which the teachers have taught in accordance with the commentary of venerable Somananda will alone do good to all.c‘Abhinavagupta has made the blazing Sun of commentary manifest that is bent on extirpating the darkness (tdmasa) due to misleading, wretched commentaries lacking the refinement of good teaching and tradition, that makes the heart-lotus, purified by the discipline of trika bloom, that, by its flashing lustre, melts the coagulated stream of innumerable bonds.”So that is said to be anuttara from which this kaulika creation emerges, in which it stays, and of which it is constituted.(Here ends the bimba portion of Paratrisika)(Now begins the pratibimba portion of Paratrisika)So, what is the kaulika mode of manifestation? How does it proceed from anuttara? How does it stay in it (i.e. anuttara) alone? How is it (i.e. kaulika vidhi) the form of anuttara itself?It has been said that it is the anuttara even of the posterior part of the book. It is for the explanation of all this that the Lord Bhairava proposes to devote the posterior part of the book with a desire for decisive ascertainment in detail for the sake of those pupils who have become adroit by acquiring the understanding of the knowledge of reality which is the essence (nifkarjana) of the well-reasoned explanation of the guru (jukti), teaching of the traditional scripture (dgama) and personal experience (sdasarfi- vedana).There is the complete satisfaction of realization for those whose manifold impression of the ideas of difference has been utterly destroyed by so much of solid teaching in the form of the question"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"84Pard-TrUika- Vivaranabeginning with *anuttararji katharri and concluded with two and a half verses and in the form of the answer beginning with <fynu devi\\ and ending with a decisive statement in one and a half verses and who have attained to the state otjivanmukti (liberation in life) by entering the stage of anuttara.Therefore, I proclaim with upraised arm that those who have been purified by firm conviction may rest contented with so much only. Now the other part of the book is begun for a thorough deliberation of the kaulika state inherent in the spotless mirror of anuttara who is the supreme Bhairava.13Notes1. The ‘uttara’ or proximate one i.e. the entire manifestation from the earth up to andfrita Siva which is full of difference cannot exist without resting on anuttara which is abhedabhuh, the stage of non-difference i.e. pure undifferentiated Consciousness.2. It has already been said that the Devi asks questions from the stage of madhyamd and Bhairava answers from the stage of pafyanti. But pafyanti itself is. the first external expansion of pard. How can it describe the state of pard? So in spite of all the ex­planation offered by Bhairava in the pafyanti stage, the nature of pard really remains unanswered {anuttara).3. ‘A“ula* means Sakti and ‘akula’ means Siva. ‘Kuldkuldtmci* means that in which Siva and Sakti are fused into one.4.

Saiva is a technical term in this context. It connotes the system of dualistic philosophy or Saiva Siddhanta prevalent in South India. The word vama means beautiful, appealing. In this system, the five wl s were allowed under certain conditions. They were marjisa (meat), matsya (fish), madira (wine), mudrd (food of parched grain) and maithuna (sexual intercourse). Daksa or Dakfina dcdra (right hand path) is said to be superior to the Vama or the left-hand path. It is full of vidhi and nisedha i.e. do’s and don’ts. A.G. says in Tantraloka, “Dakfinarji raudrakarmadhyam,*i.e., the *Dakfina path is full of terrible practices.’ In Kula, a great emphasis was laid on caryd which means due observance of cer­tain prescribed practices. Mata is said to be higher than Kula. Not much is known about Mata. Jayaratha has mentioned eight Agamas pertaining to M ata, but they are not available now.10. This is not available now.11. The Bhairava Sastra mentioned in this verse is the Rudra Bhairava Sastra, not the non-dualistic Bhairava Sastra advoca­ted by Paratririka. There was a good deal of similarity between Kula and Kaula, but as mentioned in note No. 9, in Kula, the greatest emphasis was laid on caryd. In Kaula mdrga> the greatest emphasis was laid on universal unity consciousness. Both Kaula and Trika are non-dualistic, but in Kaula mdrga, emphasis is laid on all the methods, viz. jndna, caryd, kriya} and yoga, whereas in Trika emphasis is laid mostly on jhdna and yoga.12.

Though according to the principle laid down earlier, in manifestation also, there is no succession (of earlier and later) which is entirely related to time, yet so long as there appears the difference between the taught and the teaching brought about by the Lord Himself through His Free Will, so long the fact of succession (of earlier and later) has to be admitted. So, it is with reference to this appearance of succession, that the word 'atha' has been used in the sense of immediate sequence (anantarya) i.e. subsequently it is ‘akula' itself that appears in the form of the manifested uni­verse. The word *atha' (now) has not been used to indicate immediate succession of answer after the question of Dev!. The word ‘atha\\' has been used here for clear apprehension of the meaning of a point arising in the sequential order of a homo­geneous object of inquiry pertaining to the same doctrine1 (ekapra- ghaffakagata). Otherwise there can be in every case an occasion for the use of *atha' even in the sense of immediately after silence. If it is said ‘Well, it may be so. W hat is your trouble in such use?’, the reply is, ‘None whatsoever, except that such use is not found in experience.5Venerable Somananda gives the following interpretation of 'atha':*' ‘A5 ot'atha' indicates Siva and ‘tha' Sakti” and refers to Agama in support of it. He explains 'atha' as anuttara. Both 'tha' and 'ha.' are used equally in the sense of mutual perpetual pervasion. Thus 'ha' denotes Sakti, 'tha' also denotes Sakti. Therefore, 'atha' has been used in the sense of 'aha' because of its being non-different from Sakti that manifests endless objects at the very initial ex­pansion of bliss and because of its depending on the highest nada of pardhantd (the Supreme I-consciousness) which is the very life of all beings. I have not examined this point in detail, for I am not directly aware of such an Agama. He was directly acqu­ainted with such Agamas and thus interpreted this book of pithy teaching (sulra granthasya) which is capable of bearing hun­dreds of reasonings and usages. He expanded in detail the subtle differentiation of meaning of powder (dhuli used in the sacrificial rites at initiation) or symbolic scripts of mantras (i.e. 'atha' mean­ing Siva and Sakti) in that sense on the basis of this book and other Agamas. I who am purified by his teaching, who have a"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"Abhinavagupta91desire to purify myself by removing the difficulties occurring in his book, am indifferent to such interpretations as he has arrived at. Subtle difference of meaning of the mantra depending on imaginary and symbolic interpretation of the letters of a word may be of use to some, but cannot be of use to pupils of all coun­tries and all times. Therefore I have not described it in detail. Such an interpretation is of no use to those who have the benefit of personal experience and the rational explanation of the tea­cher ; it is only easy to be managed by those who simply depend on their own imagination. For others who are not acquainted with that teaching, the impartation of that teaching wiU be of no use. Enough of this which creates an interruption in the subject under discussion.Now I follow the proposed topic. Adya in the verse means a+ ddya i.e. V which is the first of the vowels. O r ‘athadya’ may be taken together and analyzed as *atha+adya’. In this case, the ‘tha’ of *atha' is used only for the sake of ease in pronunciation.The meaning again would be V which is the first of the vowels. In this context the word 'adya' has not been used merely in the sense of the ‘foremost of an order*, nor in the sense of ‘proximity* etc., but rather that whose existence continues in ‘a’ etc., i. e. in V and all other letters (a adau bhavah iti adyah) . So it is being decisively propounded here that *a* is the stage of the highest sound {pardoagbhumih) in which alone of these letters there is the non-conventional, eternal, natural form consisting only of con­sciousness. In the nature of consciousness, the omnifariousness of everything (sarvasarvatmakata) is always present. That highest Divinity, viz. pard (who is only the dynamic form of anuttara), though consisting of the highest stage of non-differentiation is teeming with endless variety, containing within Herself as she does the pardpard expansion of paJyanti etc.2 The maxim ‘that which is not there may be elsewhere’ will not hold good in her case.

Even in the case of those who are assailed by doubt, the omniscient stage of consciousness appears, on certain occasions3 when they are able to view Reality, in a slightly limited form, though not in its full, natural form.Venerable Kallafa has righdy said:“ By the gradual elimination of tufi from the movement of exhalation and inhalation, there is the acquisition of omniscience and ominipotence.,,Now this matter (the omniscience of Paràbha{tàrikà) which is to be known only by one’s own experience is being explained by reasoning.(A.G. uses at first anoaya tarkay i.e. reasoning by positive means. )Indeterminate consciousness (niroikalpa sarjivid) is that which by its efficacy (sdmarthya ) brings something within comprehension which by its subsequent suitability for a particular purpose (iarthakriyâyogyatàdioaêa) finally acquires confirmation as a state of the Self and thus receives firm concurrence which precedes all successive determinate perceptions like blue etc., which are considered to be mutually incompatible (ivirodhdvabhdsisarjimata- kramikaoikalpyamdnanilddiniffha-vikalpa-pHrDa-bhdui) and pervades"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"Abkinavagupta93undivided ail those blue, yellow perceptions etc. which are adm it­tedly incompatible ( tattadvikalpaniyaviruddhâbhimata-nilapitàdyd- bhàsavibhâgi bhavati ), as for example in the integral perception of a picture (in which the difference of the various parts is not m ar­ked), or the integral perception of one standing on the top of a hill (Êikharastha ) or the integral perception of a peacock’s tail (in which the different colours like blue etc., are not separately noticed).(Now A.G. uses vyatireka tarka, i.e. reasoning by negative mean£.)T hat indeterminate consciousness (niwikalpa sarjivid), however, which does not pervade undivided the various incompatible percepts like blue, yellow, etc., cannot be (considered to be) prior also to the endless determinate percepts such as blue, yellow, etc., brought about by its own efficacy, as for instance, a percep­tion pinned totally to the blue. But it, known by different names such as unmesa, pratibhd etc., does occur in the interval between two different determinate ideas or percepts, one that has just terminated and the other that is about to arise (astamitodesyat). This is what is extolled as the indeterminate consciousness in the Tantras (.tobdâgama-gitarji niwikalpakarji), precedent to what in conversation are considered to be mutually incompatible deter­minate percepts or ideas, such as blue, yellow, etc.Therefore it (the niwikalpa samvit or indeterminate conscious­ness) abides undivided among the endless determinate percepts. The interval between the two determinate ideas can by no means be denied because of the difference between the two ideas. T hat interval consists of consciousness only, otherwise (i.e., if conscious­ness is not present in the interval), on account of the extirpation of the residual traces of consciousness caused by that interval or gap (devoid of consciousness), memory, congruous link, etc. bet­ween the consciousness preceding the gap and the consciousness succeeding it would become impossible.Since there is no disagreement among all the teachers regarding pratibhd or indeterminate consciousness having the above charac­teristic, therefore it is free from the fallacy of asiddhi or the non- probativc reason. Since it does not depend on the understand­ing of any conventional sign, it is sheer indeterminate conscious­ness (avikalpatoa)."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"94Pard-TrUikd-VivaranaIn the m atter of natural, non-conventional indeterminate consciousness which is identical with pure consciousness which is quite different from the insentient, there cannot be any similarity with determinate consciousness, for in it differentiation has not appeared. Objects are known only when their characteristic difference is marked. Determinate perceptions do not arise with­out the indeterminate consciousness because they lack the freedom for emerging by themselves. This freedom belongs only to in­determinate consciousness, for it is only indeterminate conscious­ness that serves as means for the recollection of the conventional signs etc. How can the recollection of conventional signs etc. be possible without the experience of indeterminate consciousness? In such consciousness, according to the previous principle, there is the absence of the limitation of time, etc. Thus the one divine indeterminate consciousness (pralibhd) defined by my weighty statement is of this kind i.e. of unlimited nature, the very Self of all. Not only in the beginning and the end but in the inter­vening state also, she is the origin of the emergence of the other present, past and future determinate apprehensions. Those who are adept in discrimination have experienced dlaya-vijndnai.e. unified or integral knowledge in this very way (i.e. in the way of indeterminate consciousness).Agreement of the determinate apprehensions occurring im­mediately after the indeterminate one has already been shown. Therefore, there is no non-probative reason (asiddha hetu) for the probandum (i.e. that which is to be proved viz., the determinative perceptions), nor can it be said that the prdtibha jhdna is confined to only indeterminate consciousness which remains uniformally the same, which allots separate positions to the various deter­minate perceptions (oikalpas) and which is not opposed to prdtibha jňdna or which is usually concerned with bringing about determinate perceptions and only appears in pure indeterminate form now and then (kaddcit), nor is there complete exclusion or separation of the determinate consciousness (asya) from the indeterminate consciousness (tatah). Therefore, there is no con­tradiction (na viruddho) between the indeterminate consciousness and any other apprehension, nor is indeterminate consciousness simply an occasional and not uniform ground (of the determinate consciousness) (ndnaikantiko), nor is there an exclusion [from it"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"Abhinauagupta95of even any dubious, opposite thing (i.e. even opposite things have their raison d'être in the indeterminate consciousness). In similar examples also, e.g., the integral perception of a picture etc., faults like the non-provability etc., of the reason (viz. the indeter­minate consciousness) stand rejected. When the faults concern­ing the main reason are rejected, there remains no occasion for finding faults in examples similar to the main reason. By others also it (i.e. the indeterminate consciousness being the ground or reason of the determinate one) has been practically settled. Therefore, why take the trouble of repeating it ! This m atter has been finally settled:“T hat which moves in the prior, intervening, and posterior state of the apprehension of all the objects of sense (nikhilaoaifayikd- vabodha-pürvâparântaracararfi), which is universal {nikhilatmakarji), which is endowed with the splendour of the highest Sakti (paraiakli- bhdsi)y that indeed is the divine creative consciousness {pratibharfi). To one who is absorbed in that consciousness (tasyâm pralinaoa- pusah)y how can depression (glànih) brought about by the lack of this divine consciousness (abhâoavaêopaklfptyà) ever occur?”“The ignorant man does not observe the magnitude of the delightful enjoyment of the most precious wealth (paradhana- sukhàsvâda) lying in the body, prâna etc.4 and feels overwhelming depression5 in his heart.

This depression pro­ceeds from ignorance. If that ignorance disappears by unme$a how can that depression last in the absence of its cause?”6 (Sp. K. Ill, 8).Also in the following verse:“That should be known as unmeja whence the rise of another thought takes place in the mind of a man who is already engaged in one thought.

This ignorance is the cause of sarjisdra or mdyiya mala which again serves as the cause of kdrmamala” . (M.V.

If it were otherwise than this i.e. if the indeterminate conscious­ness did not pervade the determinate consciousness also in all its phases, then which and by what could the following be so closely linked, viz. the destruction of depression, the emergence of depression from ignorance (of one’s essential nature), and the destruction of ignorance by means of unmefa.

All determinate objects, perceptions, ideas covered by the blanket term savikalpaka inhere in the nirvi­kalpa sarjivid and emanate from it. The entire kauliki sjffi or uni­versal manifestation is simply an expression of nirvikalpa sarjivid. A.G. has used nirvikalpa sarjivid in a very wide sense, in the sense of the divine creative consciousness, the very life of all manifesta­tion.Comm entaryFrom tadevarji sthite on p. 38, 1. 22 upto iti on p. 51, 1. 22. TranslationIt being so, the meaning of the verse is now being decisively fixed. The letters from €a* to visarga denote Siva tattva; those from ka to ha denote the five elements from the earth up to the ether; those from ca upto to ha denote the five tanmdtras from smell up to sound; those from (a to na denote the five karmendriyas (organs of action) from the feet upto the tongue; those from ta to na de­note five jhanendriyas from the nose up to the ears; those from pa to ma denote the group of five i.e., manas, aharjikdra, buddhi, prakjti, and purufa; those from^a to va denote through vdyu bija, agni bija, jala bija and indrabija, rdgay vidyd9 kald and mdyd tattvas. These are also known as dhdranas, because they make the am or the empirical individual think of the universal powers of Bhairava differently {pfthagbhdtatayd). There are two causatives involved here, owing to the causer and the caused being of two form s1 So, in one’s own self which is light, highest and perfect state, identical with Bhairava, and universal are held the states of kaldy vidydy etc., as has been said in Sivadnfi: “ Self alone who shines as bliss (dnanda), and consciousness (cit), whose advance of will-power (icchd) is un-impeded, moves forward in ail the"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"Abhinavagupta99objects as Siva whose knowledge (jfi&na) and activity (kriyd) are ever prevalent” (S.D.I. 2).In Spandakarika also, the same idea has been expressed: “ In whom resides all this” .So also, the Lord assumes these states (of .rdga, vidydykald, niyati) which are held in His shining Self by His own light by veiling Himself, that is to say, He manifests by adopting the state of thisness (i.e. objectivity) whose nature is insentiency. Then again He encompasses all this objectivity with I-feeling. So this state of the Lord as SadaSiva and I ¿vara which is pure Siva- consciousness (hiddhadidydmayi) has been hinted at by one causa­tive form of the verb 'dhf\\ In this case also the encompassing of thisness with I-ness can happen only when that which is to be encompassed (viz., thisness) has already been effected. And from the point of view of the pure Lord who is all consciousness, thisness denoting difference cannot remain in that state (i.e., as something different or separate from consciousness), and so in the event of the non-occurrence of that which is to be encom­passed, the encompassing of this with I-ness cannot properly be upheld. In that case, there cannot be any propriety in considering Siva in the capacity of an encompasser. And without his encom­passing activity, nothing whatsoever can appear, because of the absence of a proper cause. This has been declared by me many a time. The ‘this’ or external appearance, however, does occur. This only means that the ‘this* or external appearance, though now different from the (divine) light does appear externally through the power of the Lord Himself, for any other cause (than the Lord) is impossible. In one’s consciousness also, one can bear witness to the fact that it is the (divine) consciousness that appears in all forms. Thus it is clear that while the universe is the Self itself, i.e. identical with the Self (in its transcendental aspect), it appears differently as ‘this’ (in its immanent aspect). The ‘this* appears only appositionally in the I which is all light (as in the case of SadaSiva or Isvara).So from the above, this is what is most certainly indicated, viz., it is the Lord Himself who knows all the different knowables (e.g., kdla, rdga, etc.) of any knower whatsoever in the manner of T , i.e. in the manner of /aktis identical with Himself.

So he relies on such limited šaktis (i.e. kála, rága, etc.) and through these (i.e. limited kála, rága, etc.) he experiences the state of the knower (vedaka) and knowables (objects) as (totally) different. Through rága (passionate desire) etc., only He (Šiva) has been reduced to the status of a pašu (an empirical individual) etc. So rága etc. assume, according to the principle stated previously, the position of the inciter (lit., the causer) of Siva to regard in a limited way those states which otherwise He regards as His šaktis.Therefore, the second causative verb (nic) having come into operation, those (i.e. rága, kála, etc.) becoming the sole cause of Siva being designated asjiva (empirical individual) are spoken of as dháraná. Even if a causative form of a verb is in operation, the connexion with the meaning of the root of the verb is never lost {prakftyarthánvayánapáyo), so in this case also, the causative force of the root dhf can be applied only to that which has prakáša (i.e. is conscious) i.e., it can be applied to rága, vidyd, kalá because they are šaktis as they, being conscious are dhnyamdna i.e. can be caused to operate and they in their own turn become operators.As has been said by myself in Šivadrsíyálocana1 (a commen­tary on Siva Dr§{i):“ He alone can be impelled who has the competence for being impelled.** Bhartrhari has also said (in Vakyapadiya):“ In the case of one who has not yet commenced to act (but has the capacity to act), verbs with reference to question (pfcchd) etc. are used in the imperative form {lot) when a direction or command is to be given {praise). But when a direction or com­m and is to be given to one who has commenced to act, then it is a m atter of the use of the causative form (nir).”W hat is known as kancuka (covering) in other Sastras has been designated as ‘dháraná'.

Therefore, they have to be purified with effort.’* (‘To be purified’ means ‘to unite with anuttara by anusandhána and to dissolve in it.*) Sománanda has explained the word ‘dháraná* in the sense of limbs or constituents from another point of view (viz. the advaita or nondualistic point of view).

How can he enable others to cross it?”The letters from ‘fa* to lkfa' denote the group of five categories viz. Mahamaya, Suddhavidya, l£vara, Sada£iva and Sakti. Above the category of mdydy and below the category ofSuddha- vidya, there must be another category as the abode of the Vijfta- nakalas. As has been said “Above mdyd and below Suddhavidya are the Vijfianakevalas.” If Mahamaya is not accepted as a category (lit. in the absence of the category of M ahamaya), then the abode of pralayakevalis being in mdyd category, and that of the Vidyesvaras in Suddhavidya, which would be the abode of the Vijfianakalas? Therefore, it has been declared in Purva- ¿astra (i.e. Malinlvijayottara) that the Vijfianakalas have only one mala (limitation), for though they are below the stage of Sixddhavidya, there does not appear in them the limitation (mala) known as mdyiya, because in their case, the display of different objects caused by differentiation does not occur. So they have only anava mala which is ignorance (of one’s essential nature). They alone being enlightened through the grace of Suddhavidya become entitled to the status of M antra, Mantre- ¿vara and M antramahesvara. In Malinlvijaya itself (tatraiva) it is said, Anantabhajtaraka enlightened (lit. awakened) the limited experients, viz., the eight Rudras (jtvdn) who have attained the status of Vijftanakala (p. 3. v. 19), and also :“Having united them to Suddhavidya, Isvara and SadaSiva, he (Anantabhattaraka) similarly manifested seven crores of M antras together with their regions of administration.”In some Sastras (other than Trika) Mahamaya, on the assump­tion of the absence of mala (limitation) pertaining to difference i.e., absence of mdyiya and kdrma malay is accepted as the last part of Suddhavidya category.

According to this view, the five brahmas as denoted by Sa, fa, sa, ha and ksa are Suddhavidya, Isvara, Sadariva, Sakti and Ana^rita Siva, respectively. This will be clarified later. They are known as ‘brahma* because the root ‘¿/-A’ from which the word ‘brahma’ is derived means ‘to grow great’ and ‘to make grow’. These categories are called ‘brahma* firstly because they transcend difference (bhedasamuttirnatodt) (from the point of view of bfhatoa ‘growing great’) and secondly because they bring about the production of the universe of differentiation {sarjisdra- sutikartrtodt) from the point of view of bpnhakatoa— ‘making grow’). These thirty-four categories having been settled according to the procedure of the Sastra resort to tai only, as that is the initial and primal letter.In this connection, this is what is to be examined. Firstly there is the Siva tattva assigned to the V class (i.e. ‘tz’ to visarga), then there are the five elements (in kavarga) etc., and finally there is €fakti* (assigned to ‘taa’). W hat is this particular order in the descent of the mantras pertaining to srffi, sarjihdra and sthiti?z In all the Sastras e.g. in Malinivijayottara, Siddhatantra, Svac- chanda Tantra, the arrangement of letters denoting the various tattvas or categories of existence from ‘foa’ upto V , from the tattoos—the earth {pfthioi) upto Siva is given in the same manner.It is said in M alinl-Vijayottara:“The initial one i.e. pfthioi anda is pervaded by dhdrika ;4 in that, only one tattva i.e. pfthioi (earth) is acknowledged. While consi­dering the succession of oarria* (letters),pada (word), and mantra, it is only kfa oarna, ksapada, and kfa mantra that should be regarded separately in succession.” (M.V. II, 50).In the same book (i.e. in the same Malinivijayottara T antra) according to MaiinI in which there is a mixed arrangement of the vowels and the consonants consisting of the letters ‘pAa’ etc., the arrangement of the categories earth {pfthioi) etc. begins with the{Continued on page 104)♦I n this system, any varya or letter ia called ar#a or mantra, for soteriologi- cally, it protects one who reflects on it (mananittrdyate)."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"Abhinavagupta103Ch a rt 1THE VARIOUS AJVpA OR ELLIPSES CONTAINED 'iN ANUTTARAAnuttara is all-pervasive.

In Mdtfkd, in which there is no mixed arrange­ment of the vowels and the consonants and though in it the assign­ment of the tattvas to various letters is different, there is the same assignment of the category earth (pfthivi) to the last letter in both. The relevant verse regarding Malini* is as follows:“The earth category has been mentioned in \\pha' and from 4da' up to 'jha' i.e., from water up to pradhdna or prakfti, one should mark twenty-three categories successively* * (M .V .IV , 15).Again in the same book, it is said according to the three vidyds.6 There is the mantra of one letter (i.e. aurji) in Siva tattva (nifkale) ¿nd the other two, viz., one of three letters i.e. aghore and the other of one letter i.e. hrirp (tryarnaikdrnadvayam) are in the other two (dvaye) i.e., in Sakti and SadaSiva” (M.V. IV, 19).According to pardpard devi, 'aurp' refers to Siva tattva, and 'ag­hore' refers to Sakti tattva. It is in this way that the order of the successive tattvas has been fixed.6From the point of view of apard devi also it is said: “With the mantra of one and a half letters are pervaded the two ellipses (viz. pfthivi ellipsis i.e. pfthivyan<}a and prakfti ellipsis i.e., prakf- tyantfa), with the mantra of one letter are pervaded two ellipses separately (viz., mdyd ellipsis i.e. mdydntfa and Sakti ellipsis i.e. Saktyan<jla. This pervasion of apara mantra has been described in the reverse order7 (M .V.IV, 24), So the arrangement of the tattvas is as follows. The mantra 'phaf' refers to two ellipses pfthivi and prakftiy ‘hurjx' refers to mdyd ellipsis, and the m antra 'hrirp' refers to Sakti ellipsis. So far as the pervasion of the para mantra is concerned, a different order has been laid down as given below: “Three ellipses (viz. pfthivi, prakfti and mdyd) are pervaded by the phoneme, *sa*9 the fourth one (viz., the Sakti ellipsis) is pervaded by the trident i.e., an, and the one that transcends all, viz., Siva is indicated by the visarga i.e., ah. This is how the pervasion of para is described.8” (M.V. IV, 25).In the mantras Matjrkasadbhava, RatiSekhara, and “Kulesvara, different arrangements (i.e., different from Paratrisika) also are noticed.9 In other Tantras also, usually opposite arrangements•The arrangement of letters according to MAlini is the following: o r f 11* th c dh I n u u b k kh g gh n i a v bb y d d h th jh d j r t p ch U s ah b ? k? ra i aip t e ai o au d ph."},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"Abhinavagupta105are given in many ways. But in this i.e. Paratririka, an altogether different arrangement is noticed. So to one proficient in Agama, this appears as destructive of one’s own principles, as sometimes a bangle of glass or shells gets shattered by the clash of its own components. Nor can it be merely conventional so that it could be considered to be opposite even if determined in varied ways according to the fabrications of a m an’s fancy, as for instance, the southerners designate ‘boiled rice’ with the word ‘caura’ and the inhabitants of Sindha designate ‘thief’ with the same word, and ‘boiled rice’, they designate with the word (krUra\\ The Kash­miris, however, indicate with that word (i.e. krura) husked barley, wheat and rice. If it is to be treated as conventional, it cannot be definitely determined because of its being unsettled, because of its being unconcerned with the highest truth and because of its uselessness concerning the relation between that which is to be purified and the purifier (Sodhya-fodhaka-bhdva).

If one has to depend on conven­tion only, then will arise the problem of endless conventions coming down from one’s own Sastra, from another Sastra, popu­lar conventions, conventions of particular assemblies, conventions coming down from a host of teachers, convention particular for each different person and so on.

One should then sit quietly. God’s will alone would save one who is to be saved. It is His merciful will that makes one depend on such thought.By no means should people remain stretching their legs and lying with ease, indulging in enjoyment, without deliberating for themselves, nor should people sit idle, averse to the constant application of the competent intellect for the subtlest delibera­tion, brought about by the intenser and intenser grace of the Lord which appears in accordance with one’s sddhand (spiritual praxis). Therefore the question raised by me has to be examined in all respects; I am not going to give it up in this way.Therefore, thinking carefully on this matter, stay quiet, while I remove the difficulties involved.This question-answer in its entirety—not partially—resides really in the divine paravak (the cosmic Ideation) whose quintessence is autonomy (svdtantrya) which is independent of everything, which is unsurpassable and is able to bring about what is most difficult to accomplish, and which is not affected even by an iota of dependence on others. This point has been practically satis­factorily settled even before. Even then, it is being explained again in extenso in order to remove all doubts. The doubt has been raised that after Siva tattva> pfthivi (solidity) tattva has been mentioned (by you). W hat is this (peculiar) order? I say it is no order. It is orderless, the highest autonomy of the Lord which includes within itself endless variety. This is the teaching of the Trika system. So, that which is the highest divine Ens (para) pertaining to Bhairava and includes within itself the differentiating (apara) and the differentiating-cum-non-differen- tiating powers, (parapara) abides superior even to Sadasiva and AnaSrita Siva, having made even the latter one her seat (i.e. presid­ing over even the latter one). (Pard is the orb or bimba, and everything else is the pratibimba i.e. reflected or represented form.)For instance Purva^astra i.e. Malinivijaya at first refers to Sadasiva in the following words: “Sadasiva who is the gigantic departed one, smiling and both conscious and unconscious should be meditated upon as the seat of pard or the Supreme divine Sakti” (M.V.

V III 69). The three prongs referred to are “Sakti, VyapinI, and Samana” . There also (i.e. higher above the Saktis), the Supreme abode of unmand i.e. the state of urdhvakundalini, in the form of three white lotuses has been described, in the words “this is the most distinct seat” (M.V., p. 48, v. 70). So far as the three lotuses on the prongs of the trident are concerned, they form the seats of the goddesses (pard-paJyanti, pard-madhyamd, and para vaikhari).* Though this is known as supreme padyanti and is the ultimate limit of jfidnaiakti known as nada (i.e. as the state of Sadariva), yet this has only to be passed over, for the state of Para is higher than this (see the picture introducing the Paratrisika Vivarana). As has been said in Sivadr§ti: “ W hat according to us isjndnaiakti and is really the level of pard-paJyanti as expressive of Sadasiva state is to the duffers, the grammarian’s the highest state.” 18The buddhi that is introverted towards the inner spiritual Self is the level ofpard-paiyanti. Its presiding deity is R udra i.e. Para- (supreme) Sadasiva. The pard-paiyanti comes to an end in jndna- fakti which is a state of Para-Sadasiva, and this state of Para- Sadasiva is the Sakti of Anasrita-Siva.The presiding deities of manas and aharjikdra introverted towards the Self are respectively Para-Brahma and Para-Vi§nu. Their field of activity is limited respectively to pard-vaikhari and pard madhyamd. Therefore, their final resting abode (pratiffhd-bhUh) is the kriydiakti of Para-Isvara and Para-Sadafiva.14 This is pro­ved by Agama and supported by personal experience.Therefore, over pard-padyanti is the stage of goddess pard where everything appears and is also apprehended as identical with Herself.♦I n Saiva philosophy, there is the bimba-pratibimbavdda i.e. the principle that the main factors that exist in the lower sphere have their original source in the higher sphere.

In Suddhavidya, the entire multitude of subjects and objects is reflected in the sole T . It is apprehended only as fully dominated by the I-consciousness, such as “/ am this”.Thus both of these (etat ubhayam i.e. both / and this) being reflected in the common substratum of the supreme consciousness appear as identical and so are said to have a common substratum (samdnadhikaranyam).Therefore all existents share the pardpard state (i.e. the state of identity in diversity) in the stage of I ¿vara, and in the stage of M aya (and also of pralayakala) they share the state of apard (i.e. the state of differentiation).One should not understand from this that the I ¿vara state and Maya state are themselves pardpard and apard. (It is only their prameyas or objects at their stage that are the pardpard and apard states.) Therefore, there is no room for doubting that what the Agama (viz. Rudrayamala) has affirmed is contrary to what the venerable Utpaladeva has said about pardpard with reference to I ¿vara.In the case of M antram al^vara, the I-feeling though having knowledge as its highest truth, is however, different from the I-feeling of tevara and Suddhavidya which is apard i.e. of a lower order. My experience (sarjwit) tells me that ‘this’ i.e. the I-feeling of tevara and Suddhavidya is only this i.e. of a lower order than the I-feeling of Sadasiva, Sakti and Siva.The vijhdndkalaSy however, have only an awareness of T which though of the order of knowledge (bodhaikaparamdrthe api rdpena) is devoid of the experience of ‘this* i.e. objectivity. Because of their non-awareness of objective reality, they have only an aware­ness of ‘I* and, therefore, they are in the category of aprabuddha i.e. unawakened. The pralayakevalis are non-aware of both ‘I* and ‘this*. Therefore they are decidedly unawakened.In the stage of pralayakevali and Sunyapramatd (rnayapadt—which is the abode of Sunyapramata) though by means of the light of in­determinate consciousness (nirvikalpakatdbhdsena), there is an un­derlying sensibility of that sort (i.e. indeterminate consciousness),"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"Abhinavagupta111which is the very life (of determinate consciousness), though they owe their very existence to the grace of the indeterminate consci­ousness only and cannot be in any way separate from it,15 yet the later dealing and judgement of such experients (i.e. when they have risen from the state of the experience of the void) are deter­mined by consciousness of difference and are only of the nature of determinate consciousness {vikalpdtmaiva), as for example, “This is body etc., I am only I, i.e. the one who is the knower, this is aja r, what is ‘this’ is only an object of knowledge etc.” .In the case of the condition of such an experient (i.e. pralayd- kala or idnyapramatd), it is only the indeterminate consciousness that has the capacity of bringing about a consciousness of that sort {tasyaiva avikalpasarpviddtmanah tathd sdmarthyarji). For though none other than the nirvikalpa one is known to be the cause of that kind of consciousness (i.e. the determinate consciousness), even if any other cause is supposed to be its origin, it will ultimately end only in that kind of undivided universal consciousness (i.e. nirvikalpaka or indeterminate I-consciousness). It is because of this capacity of the indeterminate I-consciousness that its power of bringing about endless variety (in manifestation) is proved to be invariable.In the being of this indeterminate I-consciousness, its sovere­ignty of the creativity never ceases. In vaikhari stage or in madhyamd stage in which there is subtle mdyiya objectivity (i.e. where there is a subtle difference through the force of mayd), this kind of apprehension of difference (bheda-vimaria) is not possible if it is completely excluded from the indeterminate I-consciousness (bhdsandtireki).In the supreme consciousness, however, as is the prakdia so is the vimaria for carrying it out in practice. Therefore in that, all things appear completely identical with consciousness, just as water is in water, or flame is in flame, not simply like a reflected image.

This would have led to the breach of the close adherence of the lower pafyanti vâni etc. which depend on Bhairava. So the venerable parâ, owing to the continuation of such states would remain par à only in name.

Thus one by one, all the preceding tattoos (agni—fire, etc.) not being separated from their posterior two or three ones, including within thefnselves the delightful existence of their antecedent tattoos in accordance with the non-divergence from the nature of Bhairava which has accrued to them, are perfectly integral. Thus that category becomes a form very proximate to its chosen self-luminous Bhairava and that form becoming a self-chosen abode of rest is designated Bhairava.

An undivided sight from a distance of a wilderness without limitation of associated objects like pond, mountain, tree etc. or even with these limitations (tadoalyapi) pro­viding a wholeness of vision offers a well-known means of entree into Bhairava-consciousness.

His mental state being without any sup­port will then dissolve and the fluctuations of his mind will cease.” (V. Bhairava, verse 60).

Those who have received proper training and have penetrated into the divine consciousness know this difference themselves. If the heart-lotus of some animal-like men has not blown under the ray of grace falling from the highest Lord, then hundreds of words of mine, even though their hearts be pierced with sharp needle-like words can neither make the heart-lotus blow nor make it accomplish (the objective). On a (thing like) ja r also, one similarly casts an integral look. In this case also, the indeterminate conscious­ness instantly (jhagiti) takes in a view of the ja r as a whole (not of its constituent parts), and then forms all kinds of determinate ideas about it and they starting from the bearest ultimate part enter into the interior and the interiormost aspect and finally dissolve again in the indeterminate state. Therefore, there is no use in referring to other similar cases. Similarly in this m atter also, the Siva principle is inherent in all cases (i.e. even in the •earth category) as an indeterminate reality, and having the ele­gant autonomy of generating determinate states is, though itself beginningless, decidedly the prius of all reality. There is no differ­ence of opinion in this matter. This Siva principle can be consid­ered complete only if it abides also in the ultimate earth cate­gory.

This state of limitation by the divine autonomy in the form of mdyd does not come about without the slightly unlimited reality (ifat-asankucita i.e. iuddha-vidya), unlimited reality (asafikucita i.e. Isvara), slightly expanding (ifad-vikasi i.e. Sadasiva) and fully expanded reality (vikasuara-rupam i.e. Sakti), standing as it does in opposition to the gradually proportionate shrinkage of that whose very essence is limitlessness (asatikucitatd- sdratdratamyapek$i). All these realities are simply nothing without Bhairava who is absolutely autonomous and the very quintes­sence of perfect Light. This regular order of the categories is admitted to be true according to one’s own experience. Srud (scriptural text) also says, where can the earth category which is inclusive of water be found without its solidity? (i.e. the solidity of the earth is due to adhesiveness and adhesiveness is not possible without liquid).

Futurity is posited only with reference to clear difference that is to arise in what is undifferentiated. For instance ‘The kalki (incarnation) will appear and will destroy those who are intent on vice’—if this statement referring to the future had not been experienced in an earlier present, then how could this state­ment be made in the Puránas? If it is said that in some previous creation, there was kalki who destroyed the wicked as described, then the question arises, ‘Is the kalki referred to the same or an­other one? If it is said that he is another one, then how is one to know that he is really another one (lit. how will it be evident to consciousness?).’ If it is the sam c kalki, why is there a difference in the time of his appearance? If it is said ‘that he is not bound by time’, how is it to be proved? If it is said that he is not bound by time because he, being the very nature of consciousness, is omnifarious (citodd-višvartipatvat) then why is not the statement made by me, viz., that there is every thing in the venerable Bhairava who is invariably present on the tip of my tongue and in my heart, who is consciousness transcending the sphere of time, who is perpetually inseparable from the universal Energy, who is identical with the universally acknowledged hundreds of mani­festations and absorptions which appear through the contraction and expansion of Energy exercised by His absolute autonomy and who is the supreme Lord, honourably accepted with open"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"Abhinavagupta119eyes, or why does not one describe it in an open-throated way after having ascertained the truth for oneself?Therefore, this fact is perfectly established that so long as Siva who is beginningless and endless, who is self-luminous, whose essence is autonomy which is integral and inherently indepen­dent, who enfolds within Himself the entire multitude of cate­gories, whose highest truth is His own Self, who, because of His being eternally present, who, because of His being in harmony with everything, because of His conferring grace on all, abides as Bhairava beyond the sphere of time, in para or supreme con­sciousness which would not tolerate even the very word of ‘a particular state* (avasthdfabda vyapadefa-asahijnau), so long accord­ing to the doctrine of this Sastra He abides in the form of total manifestation (mahdsffti), not in a succession of particular limited manifestations. This is perfectly in harmony with the view of this Sastra. Because of His enclosing all the categories one by one and the entire multitude of categories collectively in one hemisphe­rical whole (sampufikaranat), He abides in the manner of a hemis­pherical bowl (sarjipufayoga)—this is the tradition of our revered teachers. It will be said that ‘beginning with the stage of paly anti, there is the play of partial bondage (pdfdmiolldsah) on account of the commencement of difference. Therefore up to paSyanti the principle of the relationship of that which is to be purified and the purifier (Sodhya-fodhaka-bhava) is undeniable. As has been said:“ O virtuous one, beginning with the earth up to Sadasiva, all the categories are to be known as usual being connected with production and destruction.** (Sv.T. V, 548).The Principle of Bimba-pratibimbaPaiyanti who has the nature of pardpard iakti (i.e. the nature of supreme cum non-supreme Energy) is like a mirror, constitut­ing the energy of paraJakti herself, in which pard shines as a reflection. That form, which is always the same both in its ori­ginal condition and reflection, is not called reflection, as the mere reference to the face (mukhapardmarfa-mdtramiua) is not reflection, because of its nature being merely the original face. That, how­ever, which, though being the same, appears in another way, as for instance, the image of the face, in a reverse order, the front as the rear, the left as the right, this also and that also (i.e. as"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"120Pa rd- Trilikd- Vivar anasimilar)—that alone is called reflection. T hat (i.e. the reflection) is only similar (to the original) not dissimilar. Therefore, pard- bhaffdrikd (the supreme consciousness) while casting in the trans­parent mirror of pardpard who has as her essence paiyanti, her reflection full of the categories, earth etc., in their separate forms {apürna-pfthivyádi tattva-sdmagri nirbharam) and thus having a succession of separate categories (tattattathdvidhoktakramarji) is present even in the separate categories because of her enclosing inwardly within herself the natural, integral, absolutely true and invariable apprehension of ‘¿a’ and other letters (antastathdvidha- sahajákrtrima’páramáTthikánapáyikádi-pardmarÉa-krodikdrenaiüa) and displays those letters lka' etc. in an integral way different from their nature.Therefore, when pard casts, in the homogeneous, transparent mirror (of pardpard whose essential nature is paJyanti), the reflec­tion of the categories which are apprehended as earth, water, etc. and are identical with herself, by bringing about differen­tiation by means of her autonomy (tathollasadbhedasütranayd) > then a reverse order of the categories—earth etc., is produced. That which in the supreme consciousness (i.e. pard) is ¿akti tattva becomes (by reflection) in pardpard pjthivxtatlva, that which is pfthivi tattva becomes fakti-tattva. This is the position ofpfthivi etc. in pardpard from upwards.It has been declared by me many a time that there cannot be any change in Bhairava who is always integral, infinite, and auto­nomous, for there can never be any excess (or diminution) in consciousness (which is Bhairava) .20In the apprehension of the highest consciousness (paramdtmani paramarle), all the categories of existence are only of the nature of consciousness (i.e. they are ail Siva). The supreme truth of that apprehension is the expansion of éakti from ka to kfa. There­fore, in the highest consciousness (para) there is complete absence of difference. In pardpard, there is non-difference in difference according to the principle of reflection. When the pardpard state which has the form of a garland of letters from ka to ksa holds as reflection the categories existing in pard which is situated at a level higher than itself, then of the non-mdyiya, inaudible (to the gross sense), supreme k to kya letters, the categories (tattvdni) acquire a reversal of order i.e., the upper becomes lower and the"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"Abhinaoagupta121lower upper. The sense is that this happens through the power of the nature of the original (bimba) which is in the upper level, acquiring a lower level in reflection. So in the statement that ‘there is pfthivi tattva in ksa,’ there is no contradiction, from the point of view of that which is to be purified and the purifier. Because of the invariable continuity of the pard state, even in that i.e. even in parapard state there is the continuous succession of ha and other letters (kddivarnasantcinah).Because of the appearance of paSyanti in the bosom of pard, be­cause of the emergence of madhyamd state within paSyanti, and because of the propensity of vaikhari present in her (i.e. madhyamd) nature, oarna(letter), mantra (word) an dpada (sentence) success­ively arise, but these (not being purifier) remain at the level of iodhya (that which is to be purified) .21 However, let this m atter alone. This is not germane to my thesis. I have conclusively discussed this point in Sripurva (Malinlvijaya) and Paficika.Clarification of the State of Malini etc.Though it has been declared that according to venerable M a­lini, there is a different arrangement of the letters etc., still let those who are devoted to the Lord (parameJvarah) and whose knots of ignorance have been shorn asunder by the teaching of Trika, understand the subject under discussion after complete ascertainment. That which has been said viz., that there are divinities, in the highest consciousness or pard iakti surpassing the highest point22 of paiyantx viz., the takti of Ana^rita-Siva, should not be forgotten by the noble selves.Thus the state of madhyamd iakti (i.e. pardmadhyamd) is being described which abides in the area of pardsarjioit, but has descend­ed to the level of parapard. Madhyamd {para madhyamd) within Her own sphere of authority which is the sphere of kriyd-fakti of I^vara being of the nature of containing clear objectivity (like jar, cloth, etc.) in a veiled form at every step superimposes the word in the object or referent, or object in the word.If the referent is universal, its denotative word has to be uni­versal.

A piece of cloth even if it is shorter by three or four fingers than another piece of cloth cannot cover it com­pletely. Word and its referent can become universal if they are associated together by nature. Vowels which are of the nature of germ (bija) and consonants which are of the nature of their receptacle {yoni) denote Siva and Sakti respectively and, there­fore, the former is denotative and the latter is the denotated.As has been said: “ In this realm of letter, Siva i.e. the group of vowels is said to be bija i.e. germ or semen, and Sakti or the group of consonants is said to be the womb or receptacle” . (M.V. I ll, 12). “ The realm of letters has two aspects— (1) bija and (2) yoni. O f these, the vowels are considered to be bija (germ) and the consonants beginning with */;’ are considered to bcyoni (their receptacles)*’ (M.V. Ill, 10). Being thus described in Purva Sastra (i.e. Malinlvijaya), Siva, not abandoning His nature o f the experient, is the vacaka or the designator, and Sakti who abides in objectivity is the odcya or designated. In the (common) world of difference also, every vdcaka or significant word is success­ful only when it is identified with the state of the subject in its two aspects of vowel {pratipadaka) and consonant {pratipadya). We shall explain presently that the coagulation of the germ {bija) in the form of the vowel denotative of Siva is the yoni or womb denotative of the consonant in the form of Sakti, for it is because of the bija-letter or vowel that there is an expansion of the yoni- letter or consonant.Therefore, if there is union of bija (germ) in the form of vowels with the womb in the form of consonants, in other words, if there is the homogeneous union of Siva and Sakti, then what a plea­sant surprise; without any effort, without tilling and sowing will be generated both bhoga (enjoyment) and mokfa (liberation).The bija-varna or vowel is adequate in itself and the yoni-varna or the consonant is equally so. Therefore, which is the cause and which the effect? Such argument does not disturb us who are making a statement about consciousness which is teeming with infinite variety. Even in worldly dealings dominated by mdydy speech which imparts clarity to the successive letters and wordsfies the other. At the level of madhyami, thty are so identified with each other that one can denote the other.

By others (the followers of other doctrines and the gram­marians) this i.e., the supreme consciousness {pardsarjivid) has been proved by laboured deliberation. In this system, it is esta­blished effortlessly to those who earnestly take to its teaching. Therefore, we do not insist on one’s going to the house of a tea­cher of grammar, the only gain of which will be a little refine­ment of speech (body of words).

Therefore, it has been said in Pürvaààstra (Màlinivijaya) :“The knowers of mantra, in order to achieve the desired object of the followers of mantra and tantra should practise in matters of nyàsa, the nydsa2* of Mâlini which is free of particular prescription (of rites ) and has a mixed arrangement of vowels and consonants, for the sake of idkta body.” By this statement, it has also been declared that Mâlini has a mixed arrangement of voweb and con­sonants. At another place also, it has been said: “ One should direct the mantra neither towards nara (i.e. limited beings and objective phenomena) nor to Siva, the supreme tattvay but to Sakti. They i.e. nara and Siva cannot bestow enjoyment and liberation, for nara is insentient, and Siva is powerless (for power resides only in Sakti).”Notes1. This book is not available now.2.

The three vidyis refer to pari, par apari and apari. Pari is that which rests in the Absolute only as Will to manifest. It is only icchi iakti. When with jnina iakti, the form of manifestation is determined, then this mixed state of icchi and jnina iakti is pari- pari vidyi. When by means of kriyi iakti manifestation is finally brought about, then the vidyi is known as apari. This is the em­pirical condition consisting ofpramitf (the experient, the subject), pramina (experience and means of experience) and prameya (ob­ject of experience).6. In Siva tattva, there is the mantra of one letter, viz. awji in Sakti tattva, there is the mantra of three letters, viz. aghore; in Sadafiva tattva there is the mantra of one letter, viz. hrirji. The full mantra referred to is: orji aghore hrih paramaghore hurji ghoraripe hah ghoramukhi bhime bhifane vama piba he ru ru ra ra phaf hurji hah phaf.7. The mantra of apari devl is hrirji hurfi phaf. The mantra phaf is of one and a half letters. This covers the pjthivi anda and prakfti anda. The mantra hrirji is also of one letter. It covers Sakti anda. The entire cosmos consists of the evolution of Sakti anda in anut- tara, miyiya anda in Sakti, prakfti anda in m iyi, and pfthivi anda in prakfti. See diagram (Chart 1).8. This refers to the mantra Sauh. ‘Sa’ represents the three cos­mic spheres {pfthivi, prakfti and m iyi) i.e. the 31 tattvas of Saiva philosophy from pfthivi upto miyi. *Au* represents /uddhavidyi, I^vara and Sadafiva together with icchi, jnina and kriyi.

He is, therefore, mahdpreta. The use of mahdpreta for Sadariva is figurative, the word *praha- santam’ (smiling) has been used for Sadariva in order to show his joy in serving as a seat for pard (the transcendental Sakti). The word ‘Isvara* in the quotation refers to Sadasiva, not to livaTSL-tattua.Sadasiva has been designated as simultaneously both ‘sacetanci* (conscious) and ‘acetana* (unconscious). He is ‘sacetana* (con­scious) with reference to his identity with the transcendental Sakti, and acetana (unconscious) with reference to the sense of difference that prevails in the world.12. All the categories of existence have two aspects, viz. (i) the original orb and (ii) its reflection. Their original orb is in the pardlakti. No reflection has any existence unless its original orb (bimba) is present in pard. The supreme original orb is deci­dedly pard; the bimbas or original orbs of the remaining vdnis, viz., pafyanti, madhyamd and vaikhari are also present in pard. In the quotation borrowed from Malinlvijaya, it has been indicated that even the three goddesses, in the form of energy, viz. pard paJyanti, pard madhyamd, and pard vaikhari abide on the three lotuses that blossom on the three prongs which emerge from the navel of Sadariva. The venerable parctiaktiy however, presides over even the above three.There are the following mdtrds (morae) of pranava, viz. a, u, my bindtiy ardhacandray nirodhi, ndda, nddantay iaktiy oydpini, and samand.

The Trika philosophers, on the other hand, maintain that there are four stages of vaky viz., pardy paly anti madhyama and vaikhari and consider pard to be the highest stage.14.

Phonematic manifestationAccording to Saivagama, vimaria—iakti or the self-verbalising and the self-revelatory aspect of the anuttara or the Supreme consists of the eternal awareness of ‘I* or Aham (in Sanskrit). The Supreme is not simply prakdla or light of consciousness, but prakaSa-vimarfamaya or light and energy of awareness simultane­ously which is potentially the germ and source of all manifesta­tion. Thus the Supreme is a biune principle.This Aham of the Supreme contains all the letters of the Sans­krit alphabet which consists of 50 letters. The 16 vowels from la* to ‘a#’ are forms of Energy representing the Supreme that is transcendent to manifestation. The remaining 34 phonemes which are consonants are also forms of Energy manifesting the various tattoos or categories of existence. So the phonemes are not merely inert letters, they are creative powers of the universe. The universe is not simply visible phenomenon of the Divine; it is the utterance of Pardvdk, the verbal Power of the Divine.

This vamana yukti is given in detail in Note No. 19 in this section. This is also known as sfffi-krama. Every spark (jiva or soul) of the Divine Flame has to go into exile.Evolution is the reverse of involution. In this section, it has been called the grasana yukti. It is the arc of ascent, the arc of svarupa-prakdSana, the path of return of the exile. It is the sarji- htira krama or layakrama, the return of Odyssey. The ratio essendi o fsfffi and sthiti is anugraha, the Divine Grace by which every spark becomes conscious of the flame from which it was separated.3. The Principle of everything being an epitome of everything elseAccording to this system, everything in manifestation is anepitome of everything else. Even such a thing as earth contains water, fire, etc., right up to Siva category. So also water contains all the preceding and succeeding tattvas or categories of existence.4. Bimba-pratibimba-bhdvaAccording to this philosophy, everything in its essence is anut- tara i.e. has the nature of the Supreme, but is polarised in prati- bimba or reflection i.e. it becomes the reverse of the original, as right becomes left and left right in the reflection of the face in the mirror. For instance Sakti-tattva in parti becomes pfthivi tattva in its reflection in partiparti. This is achieved by the svtitantrya- iakti or power of autonomy of parti. This principle of reflection does not apply to vowels which are always of the form of Siva. The diagram Pratibimba or reflection in bimba shows that pfthivi or earth category represented by the letter *ka’ is reflected as iakti represented by the letter ‘¿/a* and vice-versa."},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"Abhinavagupta135For further details, see the diagrams (Charts No. 1, 2, 3, 4).Mdlini and Mdtfkd in relation to Siva tattva in the aspect of para.Tex tFrom evarji ca sthite on p. 51, 1. 22 to samdvisfam on p. 52, 1. 8.Tra nsla tio nSuch being the case, since everything is in everything else, let us, first of all, see how the first sixteen letters of Mdlini (Ihatya), viz. *na, f, f, /, tha, ca, dha, i, na, h, C, bay ka, kha, gay give an idea of Siva seriatim in relation to the supreme or transcendental con­sciousness.(parasarjividam apekfya) [The pervasion of Siva in the first six­teen letters of Mdlini in the pard or Supreme Consciousness on the basis of sarvdgrarupatd ]1. 'Na' which symbolizes frotra (hearing) in Mdtfka cakra and is a consonant appears in the supreme consciousness in Mdlini as ndda which, in other words, is aharji-paramaria or the divineI-consciousness in this context.2. It enters the group of four phonemes (i.e. f, f /, /) which are the ambrosial seeds inasmuch as they are the womb of immorta­lity being the essential nature of Siva. The I-consciousncss in the form of ndda thrives here and attains maturity (vfrjihitattvam avdpya).3. Tha in Mdlini symbolizes rasand or flavour in the group of Mdtfka letters. So immediately entering this stage, the I- consciousness enjoys the flavour of its own nature as T .4. The phoneme 'ca' in Mdlini symbolizes gandha or smell in Mdtfkd cakra. Gandha (as is well known) is the attribute of earth. In the para or transcendental consciousness, gandha is symbolic of pratyabhijha or recognition in the form ‘I have always been like this’.5. The phoneme *dha’ in Mdlini symbolizes Uvak* or touch in Mdtfka cakra.

This is the kararia-Sakti or in other words mdydSakti which is non-different from anuttara. Being reflected in this.8. Further than the karana-Sakti, there is the state of efflorescence (unmtfa) indicated by the phoneme V in Mdlini. This is the introvertive state.This is followed by the tendency towards prasdra or extension (urdhvdfrayana) i.e. a state of extroversion indicated by the pho­neme d in Mdlini.The phoneme ‘¿a* in Mdlini symbolizes ‘buddhi* in Mdtfkd cakra. The function of buddhi is ascertainment. So it resorts to perfect ascertainment of its self-existence in Sakti represented by buddhi (ibuddhirupam idkta yonim adhiiayya) (hinting that it is not only transcendent to manifestation but also immanent in it).9. The phoneme ‘¿a* in Mdlini symbolizes ‘pfthivV or solidity in Mdtfkd cakra. Pfthivi or solidity indicates ‘sthairya* or firmness. This means that the I-consciousness attains firmness in its own nature as Siva.The phoneme *kha* in Mdlini symbolizes jala or liquidity in Mdtfkd cakra. The characteristic ot jala (water) is rasa which symbolizes savour or delight. This means that the I-consciousness is immersed in its own bliss as Siva.The phoneme lga’ in Mdlini symbolizes agni or fire in Mdtfkd cakra which indicates prakdJa or light. This means that the I- consciousness knows itself as prakdia or Light in its own nature as Siva.(This is known as Siva-tattva inparasarfivitti or Supreme State) E x p o s itio nIn this relationship of Mdlini to the para or transcendental state, Abhinavagupta brings out the following points:1. ‘Sarvarfi sarvdtmakarfC—‘Everything consists of everything else’. This is the basic principle. Siva is immanent in manifes­tation. Since Siva is not confined to any particular element, but is the all-of-Reality, therefore, there is nothing in the universe"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"Abhinavagupta137which docs not contain the all-of-Reality. When it is said for instance, that pfthivi is solidity and has the attribute of gandha or smell, it does not mean that solidity is the only thing that is represented by pfthivi. It only means that solidity is predominant in pfthivi, but it contains the other elements also in miniature.Trika philosophy maintains that the entire manifestation is an expression of para, iakti or pari vdk or transcendental logos. This pard vdk is creative energy. Every letter of the alphabet represents energy in some form. The letters of the alphabet are arranged in two schemes in Trika, viz., Matfkd and Mdlini. Mdtfkd means the little mother or phonematic creative energy. Mdlini literally means the Devi who wears a mdld or garland of fifty letters of the Sanskrit alphabet. Matfkd also wears a garland of fifty letters. That is why sometimes Matfkd is called as pdrvamdlini and Mdlini is called as uttar a-mdlini. But the word Mdlini is rarely used for Matfkd. Another etymology of Mdlini is *malate viivam iti MdlinV, i.e. the iakti of letters which holds the entire universe within itself (the root 'trial' meaning ‘to hold’).The main difference between Mdtfkd and Mdlini consists in the arrangement of letters. In Mdtfkd, they are arranged in a regular order, i.e. the vowels come first, and the consonants come next in a serial order. In Mdlini, they are arranged in an irregular way i.e. the vowels and consonants are mixed and no serial order is observed.On the principle of ‘sarvaifi sarvdtmakarji', Abhinavagupta has tried to show that the first sixteen letters of the Mdlini order represent Siva tattva just as the first sixteen vowels of the Mdtfkd order do. O ut of the sixteen letters of the Mdlini order seven, viz., T> f > f> /> U k and u are vowels and as such, they are the constituents of Siva tattva itself.

They have only an intrinsic significance./, /, /, are called amfta bija, immortal germs or voweb, because they are the resting place of I-consciousness; they do not pro­duce anything; they do not change. I connotes tidnd bija or the power of mastery. U connotes ‘unme$a' or introvertive effloresence of knowledge, and Q connotes drdhvdtrayana or the tendency to extroversion.

This has been done in accordance with certain fixed succession (niyataparipdfi) determined by the pre­dominance of certain letters considered as appropriate according to the vijndna* of each Sastra (nijanija vijndna-samucita-tattad-varna- bhaffdraka pradhanyena).

It is not simply the mystery-mongering of the letters and mantras that constitutes their advantage. As in Vajasaneyatantra, after plac­ing the letters in their proper order, it is said:“This is the divine order of letters of Mdtfkd> which has reached the abode of Vi$nu i.e. this is the Mdtfka-cakra which has reached the infinite space of Mdlini. When it is fully understood from the teaching of the guru (the spiritual director), it cuts asunder the noose of the limited, empirical m an.”Similarly, it is said in Trikahfdaya: “ It is the power of the weapons or of anything else, that matters. So also, it is not only the position of the letters of a mantra, but the power of creative energy that is inherent in it that matters. It is by being preserved with that creative energy, that the mantras are really preserved, otherwise (i.e. without the creative energy) what remains con­stitutes merely a number of letters.”No tes1.

Siddhi in bhuvanas or spheres means that once a yogi has acquired power over a particular bhuvana> he is no longer bom in that particular bhuvana. So also siddhi over a particular tattva or category of existence means that he has arisen above that cate­gory of existence.

Even when the letters of the mantras are considered by them­selves, and not in any other aspect, those very mantras have diff­erences (anyathdtvarji) in the Sastras in accordance with the division of dnava, iakta and Sdmbhava updya.12. There is a difference in the seminal mantra of mdyd, viz.: krirji delineated in Saiva Sastra, of pranava or ‘077*’ delineated in Vai?nava Sastra, of the immortal germ of the heart (amftabija) which includes all the tattvasy viz. ‘sauh* delineated in the Sastras of the left-hand path,2 or there is a difference in the pranava mantra (lit. the four aspected mantra) in the Vedic scripture (where it is O M ), and in Kaulottara etc. i.e., the Sakta Tantras (where it is hrirji)y and in the Ucchu§ma or Bhairava Sastra (where it is hurji)*Here is recorded the rule of the use of the mantras for the worthy practitioners oiyoga in respect of the manifold differences of vowels (kulapurufa) and consonants (kulaiakti). “All the vowels (pUrve) should be placed before (apare) the consonants {pare§drji) and the consonants {pare) should be placed after (pfftha) the vowels, and the vowels {purve\\pica) should be placed in regular succession.

In the others i.e., the mantras which consist of letters with vowels, there is a dot on each previous letter (anyefu prdk).

Thus the dot will differ in the case of mantras the letters of which are without a vowel (isfaihi) and those which are with.a vowel (asprsfaihi). This is the order of such mantras. This is the rule (vidhi) of the combination of vowels (kulapunifa) and con­sonants (kulafakti) as has been described above (yathoktah) in order to point out the infinity of such mantras (dnantyavedane) . ” 4ExpositionIn this, Abhinavagupta mentions the following im portant points about the mantras:1. In spite of the similarity of letters, they become different when used for different updyas. When a mantra is used as anava updya, it is prana-apana or kriydSakti that is predominant. When it is used as idktopaya, it is jndnalakti that is predominant. When it used as farjibhavopdyay it is icchd Sakti that becomes predominant.2. There is a difference in the seminal mantras. In the Vai§nava Sastras, it is O M ; in Saivasastras, it is hrirji\\ in the left-hand Sastras, it is sauh.3. There is a difference in pranava itself in the different Sastras. In the Vedic scriptures, it is ‘O M ’; in the Sakta Tantras it is hriiji'y in the Bhairavasastra, it is hurji.4. Again, there are differences in the formation and the arrangement of the letters in a particular order. The first verse cited, beginning with purvepare§dm etc. shows the difference of arrangement of letters in Mdtrkd and Mdlini. In this verse, the word tpurvai has been used for vowel, and the word *p a r ehas been used for consonant. The verse says that in Mdtrkdy all the"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"Abhinavagupta153vowels should be placed in regular succession. In Mdlini there is an inter-mixture of vowels and consonants.The second verse cited, beginning with ‘adho'dho* contains very archaic Sanskrit words in a technical sense. Bhedasarjikhyd has been used for halant letters, dhama has been used for mantra, sarpkhyd for bindu or a dot etc. For details, see the translation. In this quotation, Abhinavagupta gives an example of two kinds of mantras. The first is that in which (i) halanta letters i.e. conso­nants without any vowel are placed one below the other, and (ii) in which there is a bindu or dot only on the final letter which has a vowel. The following navdtma mantra is an instance of this kind of mantra. Such mantras are known as sarjiyuktakfari mantras. For instance: h or: hy sy r, kfy m, /, vyy, ndrjis rmIvyntirjiThe other is that kind of mantra in which each consonant has a vowel and there is a dot (bindu) on each letter, t.g.yajjiy rarjxy larjiy varji. Such mantras are known as asarjiyuktakfari mantras.Tex tFrom tadetena on p. 55,1. 1 upto padamandmayamy on p. 55,1. 6.TranslationThus, in accordance with this precept, those spiritual practi­tioners who are devoted to the right rules of vowels (kulapuru$a) and consonants (kulaSakti) of the mantrasy e.g. M antramahesvaras (beings always steeped in the essential nature of Siva) become unqualified (to im part mantra to others); they cannot im part mantra for deliverance, for a mantra from them cannot bear fruit. This does not apply to Mantras, for even when they are completely absorbed in meditation, they do not reach the extreme state of andmaya in which one loses one’s personality in Siva.1It has been rightly said:"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"154Pard-Triiikd- Vivarana“ In this world in which beings come into existence right from Brahma upto a tuft of grass, three and a half crores of mantras appointed by Siva (for helping creatures) are quite enough.

At this stage, She becomes so infinite, that considering the varied forms which She assumes she appears omnifarious, and thus being of all forms, She assumes the state of letter (varna), a word {mantra) and sen­tence (pada) through the predominance of three aspects viz. para (supreme), pardpara (i.e. subtle or suk$ma) and apara (gross or sthUla) i.e. even in pardpara state, She appears as para, pardpara {suk$ma) and apara (gross) .1 This threefold aspect should be regarded from the standpoint of effecting purification. The sources of bondage appearing in paJyanti are indeed subtle. They have to be purified in their subtle aspect, for the sources of bon­dage are lying within. The sources of bondage at the pafyanti level are subtle; therefore their purification has to be effected at the subtle level, for a bondage is bondage when it lies within the subtle aspect. At the level of madhyamd in which the external expansion of Sakti becomes more and more perceptible, paiyanti appears as an instrument of purification {Sodhana-karana-tayaiva bhavati)."},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"Abhinavagupta155Just as by washing the dirt or impurity lying in the inner fold of a cloth, the dirt lying on the upper portion gets automatically washed, even so by the removal of dirt lying at the subtle level, the dirt lying at the madhyamd level gets automatically removed.2So, the stage of vaikhari as lying within the pard-sarfwid is being considered. The state of vaikhari in the pard (supreme) state is not impossible.8Though the development of speech-organs (sthdna) and arti­culation (karana) becomes manifest in children in two or three years, yet it is an established fact that their proficiency of the language increases day after day and month after month. If in madhyamd (which is inherent in pardvdk) there were no appearance of the lineaments of the letters in accordance with the speech organs and articulation that become distinct with the expansion of vaikhari, then there would be no difference in the development of language between a child a day old, a month old, or a year old. The proficiency (vyutpatti) in the development of language in a child increases as the impressions of words heard and objects seen are associated in his mind. Pardmarfa or mental association is not possible without word (gross or subtle). Word whether expressed externally in a manifest or gross form or implied inter­nally in an unmanifest subtle form is an aspect of vaikhari.In a new-born child even when the vocal organs are not yet developed, the subtle form of vaikhari inheres in madhyamd by which he is able to associate heard word and seen object by means of an inner, subtle, unmanifest implicit proto-language.It has also to be admitted that the constituent elements of vaikhari are present in his mind in an implicit form for without these, he could not have been able to have even an implicit form of language and without this he could not have been able to associate the seen object and the heard word.If it be said that it is madhyamd itself that becomes distinguished by the difference resulting from such development, we may ask how? Let us discuss this point carefully.The child hears the words and sees the objects and thus develops his acquisition of language. He mentally lays hold on the words heard. The words heard are of the level of vaikhari (articulate speech). In regard to these words, he is like one bom blind in regard to forms. (He hears the sounds but does not know what"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"156Pard- Trisika- Vivaranathey refer to). Therefore, vaikhari constituted by speech organs and articulation certainly inheres in madhyama.Similar is the condition even in the dumb. It has already been said that the consciousness of the goddess pard is all-containing (saroatmaka).Thus vaikhari herself, who has acquired development through madhyamdy so long as she remains in herself with words and their referents perfectly manifest, expressing mutual diversity and having the net-work of the categories of existence within herself, so long she is apard. The development of the madhyama stage which inheres in pard is known as parapara9 and also the growth of paiyanti (is known as pardpard). In her own self, pard is the divine goddess.Sodhaka, Sodhana and SodhyaThus in the state of purified and purifier, there is a threefold position. The purifier (Sodhaka) is the Universal Divine whose expansion is universal. It has already been said that the expansion occurs in this very way (i.e. in the way of triad) .4 In the m atter of the means of purification (iodhana) the action is that of the Divine Being Himself who assumes self-imposed limitation through His own autonomy and reposes in the state of the glory of His Sakti. (iaktamahimaviJrdntasya). That which is to be purified (/a- dhya) is the network of bondage of the limited empirical being (nardtmanah) who is full of a sense of difference which is first inci­pient in the paSyanti vdk stage, which is a iakti of limited beings expanded by the pardpard goddess who is the pulsating padyanti of the form of pati-Iakti, who is also pafu-fakti5 developed by the inanaSakti of Sadasiva, who is similar in rank to venerable pard that is nondifferent from venerable Bhairava who is the unified form of the triad (sun, fire and moon) 4 and who transcends the thirty-seven categories.7 This is a settled fact.As has been said by revered Somananda in Sivadr§ti: “ May Siva who has entered into Us as the Subject (as iodhaka) make obeisance by Himself (in the form of mantra as iodhana), to Siva who is extended as the universe, by means of pard who is His own Sakti in order to remove all obstacles which are but Himself.” (S.D. I, 1)"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"Abhinaoagupta157The entire group of activities (whether Jodhaka, Jodhana or Jodhya) indicates this form of Siva in Siva-Dr$ti.In the m atter of purification, the succeeding state has to be dissolved in the preceding.8“ Leave both (Jodhya) dharma and adharma, both truth and false­hood (i.e. dissolve them in the true Self). Having left both truth and falsehood (i.e. the Jodhya), leave also that by which you leave everything (i.e. give up also the mantra in the form of Jodhana by which you give up the Jodhya).This is the eminence of Trika Sâstra, this is the glory that even the purifier,® and the means of purification has to be purified. All the three (i.e. Jodhaka, Jodhana, and Jodhya, in other words, paJyanti, madhyamd and vaikharl) exist simultaneously in pard (the supreme oak).M an speaks something through oaikhari, ideates through ma- dhyamd, experiences some indeterminate state through paJyanti and experiences inwardly some truth through pard.It is Lord Bhairava only who abides completely full in all the three states (tdvati). By closely investigating the traditional teaching of the primordial experience, it will be established that it is the met-empirical consciousness of oneself. This is a fact that cannot be controverted.This is not simultaneous in a temporal sense. Owing to its being subtle, it is not marked. So there is only a presumption of simultaneity. Just as the piercing of a hundred flowers and buds together appears to be simultaneous, so is that. If it be said that simultaneous means occuring at the same time, what does it really mean? According to the principle enunciated by me earlier, viz. that time is only a thought-construct, what is time in the introverted consciousness? The essence of time consists in the experience of successive appearance and disappearance of objects. Its essence consists in the non-presence of the awareness of intro­verted consciousness which is time-less.The objection that though time is experienced in juxtaposition with successive objects (asprdna-apdna, change of season etc.), it can overpower the non-temporal consciousness, is not valid, for the successive object is in itself known through the underlying consciousness which is not successive. Otherwise how could time itself be known as a distinct object? The rise of the fallacy of"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"158Pard- Trttikd- Vivaranamutual dependence is due to the separation of a thing from the light of consciousness which'is found in one’s own self. Every thing that can be uttered has to fall back upon indeterminate consciousness (nirvikalpa jndna). The same fallacy of m utual de­pendence lies in saying that the piercing of many flowers and twigs together means piercing the many. A whole atom does not come about by the addition of the last one with the others, for this phenomenon is not a karma (operation) .10A congruous connexion cannot be established in the absence of indeterminate knowledge (jndnabhdvena). Investigation of con­gruous connexion is not possible if there is a break in memory (smftibhede), and memory depends on indeterminate knowledge (jfiana). So investigation of congruous connexion cannot be carried out without indeterminate knowledge. I have examined this problem in detail in my commentary on ‘PadarthapraveSa- nirnaya*.11 So what is the use of this fruitless tangle of words which only ends in creating an obstacle in the teaching of the subject under discussion?Thus the goddess pard abides as purifier; pardpard also acts as purifier where abide the powers *aghord'1% etc. with whose aid, the spiritual practitioners Vijfianakalas have become MantramaheSa etc. Through the grace of Brahmi and other goddesses, the minor spiritual practitioners have become Brahma, Vi$nu and others. Indeed, it is the Lord, venerable Bhairava who being, through the multitude of His powers, perfect and whole in Himself, infuses by His autonomy, His own power into Brahma and others and thus makes them autonomous (in their own spheres). W hat else can there be other than this?Thus this is another excellence of Trika, viz., that even the purifier has to be purified.13 It has been rightly said, “Trika is higher even than K ula” . So, owing to the triadic nature of puri­fier, agency of purification and the one to be purified Trika is invariable.As has been said by myself in one of my hymns: “When there are three aspects of the group of three (trika)” there is no regressus ad infinitum in this, for every thing of this teaching is of a piece with the highest consciousness of the Lord. “ Leave that iodhana also through which you do away with the Sodhya (the one to be purified)’’ one should consider it in this way. Finally, the"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"Abhinavagupta159purifier has also to be purified, inasmuch as the idea of difference that arises in him is also a bondage. Purification is also in its highest sense that fire which is non-different from the conscious­ness of Bhairava which is proficient in burning away all impurities. When every thing viz., that which is to be purified (.iodhya), the means of purification (.iodhana), and the purifier (iodhaka) enters into Bhairava, then it is perfection itself. As will be said, “ Thus who truly knows etc.” (Verse 25 of this book).Notes1. In the para or supreme state, she is the repository of varna or letters, in thz pardpara or supreme-cum-non-supreme state (i.e. sdk^ma state) she is the repository of mantra or words; in the apara state (sthula state) she is the repository of pada or sentences. Malini is symbolic of pardpara state, but even in pardpara state, she appears as para, pardpara (sukpna), and apara (.sthdla).2. The sense is that the gross form is iodhya (to be purified), and the subtle form is the iodhaka or purifier; the subtle form is iodhya (to be purified) and thzpara (Supreme) form is its iodhaka (purifier). This chain goes on until anuttara or the Highest.3. In the womb of pardiakti lies pardvak, in pardvdk lies paiyanti, in paiyanti lies madhyamd and in madhyamd lies vaikhari. Consequ­ently vaikhari is inherent in pardsarjivit.4. The triad refers to §iva-£akti-mzra, varna-mantra-pada, para- pardpara-apara, iodhaka-iodhana-iodhya.5. In this context, pardpara goddess signifies the original bimba paiyanti (or pati-iakti) and paiu-iakti signifies the pratibimba or re­flected paiyanti-vdk. The first is without kfobha, the second is with kfobha.6. The triad consists of the sun, fire and moon. The sun or surya symbolizes pramdna or knowledge, the fire or agni symbolizes pramdtd or the experient or subject; the moon or soma symbolizes prameya or object. Again sQrya or the sun is the symbol of jndna or knowledge; agni or fire is the symbol of icchd or will, and soma or the moon is the symbol of kriyd or activity. Bhairava is the unified form of all these triads.7. Anuttara has three eyes, agni (fire), soma (moon), and sdrya (sun).

This means that finally both Sodhya and Sodhana have to be given up. Be established in your real Self, and then nothing else would be required.10. W hat Abhinavagupta is trying to express means that what is a ‘whole’, an integral fact is above time. It is not constituted by the sum of the parts what becomes a ‘whole’ by the addition of parts, it is the result of karma or operation which is temporal, but a real whole or paripurna is not the result of karma or operation. It is an expression of kriyd Sakti which is beyond time.11. This book is untraced.12. ‘Aghora’ are those Saktis who help the spiritual practi­tioners in the realization of Siva-nature.13. This Sodhaka or purifier refers to such Sodhakas as M antra- maheSvara etc. The idea in the purifier, viz. ‘I am purifier’ is also a stain. This has also to be given up.TextFrom tat parasaijividekamaya etc. on p. 57, 1. 22 up to hfdayarji- gamikftam on p. 63,1. 6.TranslationThus Pardpard divinities being identical with the highest con­sciousness are omnifarious (sarvatmaka) and therefore include infinite variety of secular and sacred words and their referents, as has been said in Malinlvijaya III, verses 59-60.The very powerful yoginis which are like limbs of pardpara mantra1 are eight.2 They include successively five, six, five, four, and two, three letters twice.3 They are constituted by the nomi­natives of address amounting to seven, eleven, one and one-and- haif letter twice, i.e. twenty-two letters.4Thus this relation of the purifier and the one to be purified is constituted by the inclusion of endless pre-concerted signs (sarji- keta) pertaining to mantras already composed or to be composed in future.

Nor can it be said that a conventional sign cannot indicate spiritual knowledge. This is accepted. This being the position, we are now pursuing the topic under discussion.The syntactical connexion of the words in the fifth verse indi­cates that at first there are V and other vowels (upto au). At their end, through the connexion of kriydlakti {kdlayogena) occur what are known as soma (moon) and sürya (sun) .6 By the word ‘tat* in the phrase ‘tadantaK is to be understood ‘akula* i.e. anuttara or Bhairava referred to in a previous verse. Therefore cakula* is that which includes within itself the effectuating power (kaland), for the kulaiakti (the cosmic creative power) inheres in it.6 It is the mmariaiakti (the energy of the creative I-consciousness) that is the effectuating power (kalandtmikd). Without this vimaria~ iakti even akula which transcends the fourth state, is mere noth­ing, for it is only inherent in the deep sleep state. The states that come immediately after turya (i.e. sufupti, svapna and jdgrat) are also similar to turya (i.e. they are also mere noth­ing without vimaria iakti). Vimariafakti abides as the supreme, divine, unsurpassed (niratifaya), autonomous iakti of venerable Bhairava, full {puma), emaciated (Arr/a), both full and emaciated, neither full nor emaciated.7In the vimariaiakti of Bhairava, this is no stain either of the appearance of succession or simultaneity. According to the precept referred to previously, viz., that time is only a thought construct, succession should be deliberated upon (kramo vicdrani- yah) in accordance with the fact that the very nature of the mas­sive creative Self-consciousness (vimarfaikaghana) of the supreme (pardbhaftarika) gives rise to infinite, future absorption and emana­tion and that there is an appearance of succession and non­succession (kramdkramdvabhdsah) in that nature of the Divine which is above both succession and simultaneity (kramayaugapadyd- sahisnu). As has been said: “Lord Bhairava is autonomous, per­fect, whole and omnipresent. T hat which does not appear in the mirror of His Self does not exist.“ Non-succession can have its existence only in consciousness in which there is an appearance of both succession and non-succession {akramasya tatpürvakena sarjividyeva bhdvdt) so succession has to be accepted for the sake of exposition.

This will is only a state of consciousness of the transcendental being (anuttara-sattd). The highest Lord is always conscious of His own nature. He is akulaiakti. Though in being aware of His form, He makes use of kulafakti, yet there is a distinction in the concept of akulafakti from that of kulafakti.

Thus svdtantrya iakti (the power of autonomy) in the form of icchd (will) resting in its own dnanda (bliss) is designated mahdsffti (transcendental emanation).10 As will be said (in verse 29 in this book): “The heroic sddhaka (oirah) should thereafter worship sfffi (emana­tion).” The second one (viz., u, U or unme$a, Qnatdmayi jndnaiakti) becomes prominent by being engaged in the separation (recana) i.e. external expansion of the multitude of objects which abide identically with the icchdiakti of Bhairava and by being engaged in the anupraveia i.e. in withdrawing them and effecting their entrance in andirita Siva.By the separation of the multitude of objects, she becomes emaciated, as she is engaged in the manifestation and expansion of objects. Thus she is like the sun.11 Being identical with the essential nature of Bhairava, by the desire to withdraw the crea­tive consciousness into andirita Siva (kulasarjwitsarpjihifdtmikd), she is known as jhdnaiakti who has the tremendous power of with­drawal. Again, reviewing her former expanding form, she, within herself/ looks for the previous state of her own transcendental consciousness, symbolized by moon (soma) with the disposition o f the retention of the successive form of the sun and the moon.18 In an inverse state she looks for the aspect of the moon, the sym­bol of manifestation (sfffi) and the sun, the symbol of withdrawal (scujihdra).In this changing state, now wishing sarjihdra and now wishing sfffi, jhdna and icchd sometimes tending towards expansion and sometimes not, one should not attribute the fallacy of non-finality (na ca atrdnaoasthd iti vdcyam), for the expansion (prasara) and non-expansion (aprasara) go on changing their position.

This difference lasts only so long as the objects of experience are due to the physical limitation (tasyd-upddhih dehasamvedya mdtra- tayaiva bhdvdt). Therefore in Tantrasara, it has been said that reality has to be understood through the example of the shadow of the best part of the body i.e. the head. “Just as (when) one tries to jum p over the shadow of one’s head with one’s foot, the head will never be at the place of one’s foot, so (also) is it with baindavi kald.” 15 Thus this group of six iaktis (from V to ‘fl’) which has been determined covers the powers upto jndna.Now we are going to deliberate on kriydiakti, the power of activity that has begun to move forward. Icchd (will) and jndna themselves by heterogenous intermixture16, by admitting the succession of the preceding and following which are full of mar­vellous strangeness are termed kriyd. Impetuous eagerness is the essence of kriyd. Whatever intermixture occurs owing to the expansion of kriydiakti with something else, is due to the fact that anuttara (the Absolute) enters suddenly in a sphere of reality which is beyond mental grasp (andmarianiya), and void (i.e. the state of anairita Siva) just as a frog by a simple leap reaches ano­ther place from one place. The consciousness that is anuttara (a) and dnanda (<J) does not expand in the first four spheres (i.e. f, r, /, i) (na prasarati), of kriydiakti, for that is an unnamable (andkhyd) state, not being the object of name and form (ndma- rUpa).Anuttara and dnanda being the final support of everything (paryantabhittirupatvdt) and after having been the foundation of the entire activity in every kind of knowledge cease (from expansion), aksubdha icchd ends in kfubdha Hand. So far as its relation to im­petuous eagerness is concerned, it is capable of expanding both in its own field and also in anuttara and dnanda because of its capa­city for succession.Then that kriydiakti full of impetuous eagerness, penetrating into its own form (denoted by f, f, /, /) which is void (i.e. devoid of all manifestation), immerges at first into a luminous form which is tcjas or fire (denoted by the experience o ff).

After this, icchd-iiand following the sound Hy assumes the form of / and / which indicates immo­bility, the essential nature of the earth (pdrthivarupa-satattva) .18 Finally, it is the energy of Hand, which passing over all the states o f objectivity, jumping over the longer state (dirghatararji plutva)y after reaching the immobile state of vacuity i.e. /, attains to the prolated state (plutatvameti) i.e. / in accordance with the principle of Sanskrit grammar that phoneme tly does not have the long form (dirgha) of the phonemes V etc., the prolated state is only a longer form of the long one. In accordance with the rule stated already,19 one should not search for the long form of / separately. Enough of this. This group of four letters on account of its penetration into vacuity is like burnt seed and is said to be eunuch.20 There is in them no total absence of germ i.e. the state of a vowel. Nothing can exist which is neither germ nor womb which symbolize Siva and Sakti, for the existence of any other thing has not been mentioned either in Purva Sastra (Mali- mvijaya) or any other Sastra. Even in worldly pleasures, there is felicity in repose of this kind. That is why this group of four letters is said to be the germ of immortality.When icchd (t) and Hand {I) penetrate the aspect of dnanda and the sphere of anuttara which are anterior to all and never lapse from their essential nature, we have V (anuttara) or d {dnanda) plus : or i as e as is said, the letter *ay combined with the letter V becomes e.In the inverse state (i.e., if V and *dy come after and Hy) with the penetration of V and idy there will arise a different letter. If Hy or Hy penetrates dnanda i.e. ‘<f, there will be a long state (sphufatd) of the vowel V.

In the SaivaSastras also (pdramtivartfu api) the short aspect of V and V in comparison to *ai* and ‘at/* which is noticed in the application of afigavaktra i.e. in connexion with limbs or mouth, should be considered in this light viz., V becomes ‘qyo* in place of long ai and ‘o’ becomes lava* in place of long au. Thus the posi­tion with regard to the vowels V and ‘o’ is settled.Now when V combines with ‘a’ and ‘<f (tatha iabalibhutarjt), it becomes ‘oi*. Similarly in the case of unme$a i.e., V , when it coalesces with ‘o’ or ‘¿’ we have ‘o’. So also when u coalesces with ‘o’ or ‘¿* we have ‘o’. When ‘o’ combines with a or ‘<J’ we have ‘oh’ [e is the fifth stage of kriydiakti, ai is the sixth, o is the seventh, And au is the eighth and final stage of kriydiakti ].Though unme$a i.e., jMnaiakti expanding can penetrate into the void, yet it can do so only when it enters at first icchd and Hand (asya HanecchdtmakobhayarUpa praveia eva itinyatd). It is only thus that there can be an entry in the void. In the case of icchd and Hand, there is no question of change of their essential nature.22 So, their position remains as before. Thus icchd and jhdna (i.e. iy i, u,U) by entering the essential nature of anuttara (i.e. a) be­come developed, i.e. reach au which is symbolic of full develop­ment of kriydiakti. After this, they abandon the variation of those Saktisy and mounting to the state of non-difference, get immersed in the remaining form of a bindu i.e. arjiy a dot which represents awareness (<vedand) of the very nature of the Reality that is pure consciousness (cinmayapurufatattvasatattoa), and get immersed in the anuttara state. So they get dissolved in the state of anuttara. The vibration of kriydiakti ends in au. The vibration of icchd and jhdna comes to a stop here, for icchd and jhdna are included in kriydiakti.M In the Trika Sastra, the nature of au is determin­ed as a trident24 in the enunciation of topics, in the following verse:“The venerable pard vdk pervades the three spheres (anda) viz. pfthiviy prakfti and mdyd with the letter ‘¿a’, with the trident"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"168Para- Triiikd- Vwar anai.e., lau', she pervades the fourth (i.e. the Sakti an<}a).

When the highest Lord emana­tes within Himself the entire cosmos as only pure awareness in order to express unity (ekagamandya) at first as predominantly the possessor of Sakti, i.e., as Siva (¿aktimat-rupapradhanatayd), and next as predominantly Sakti (idkta-visargapradhanataya) with the creative means of that (tannirmdnena i.e. icchd, jndna and kriyd). The visarga ‘w/i* is symbolic26 of iakta visarga.In respect of fully developed kriyaJakti of such an extent (ctavati) upto the end of au, it is the aspects of the pulsation of icchd, the initial, jndna, the middle, and kriyd, the final appearing first as the desire to manifest (icchd), then the comprehension of mani­festation (jndna) and finally the actual manifestation (kriyd) that constitute the very nature of venerable Bhairava or the unsurpassable (anuttara) who has penetrated into all these. These arc clearly experienced by yogis who are engaged in subtlest medi­tation and are described by Svacchanda and other practical Sastras as prabuddha connoting icchd, prasarana, connoting jndna, and avarana, connoting kriyd.21 Therefore, it has been said in the seventh chapter in Sivadr§ti: uBy meditating on the supreme Self (paratmani) who is cit (sunirbharatard), ananda (ahldda), fullfledged *a* i.e. anuttara (bharitdkdra-rupini) and in whom all the three iaktis (viz. icchd, jndna and kriyd) are fused (one acquires the nature of Siva).” Again, “ It is His Sakti that has acquired the form of the cosmos, just as a mass of clay acquires the form of a ja r.” (SD, V II, 28). And finally having described th a t‘There is only one principle (viz. Siva), there is no difference in Him on account of the number of phases (like the four spheres of pfthivi, prakrti, mdyd and Sakti or, three Saktis, five states etc.), it declares♦Tw o points in this verse are noteworthy:1.

Thus Siva abides with perfect fusion of the three subtle Saktis (viz. icchd, jhdna and kriyd) in Himself. That supreme Reality is then the highest cit (consciousness) and ananda (beatitude) without any differentiation (nirvibhagah).” (&DI, 3-4)Referring to the knowledge of an object, such as ajar, the same text says:“ Even at the time of the knowledge of an object, such as a ja r etc. (these five aspects viz. icchd, jhdna, kriyd} ananda and cit are present); ‘one knows the jar*—this indicates kriydiakti, ‘knows* this fact indicates jhana-iakti and if one does not have icchd, knowledge would not be possible (lit., there would be destruction of knowledge). When a thing has been known (i.e. after pramiti) the absence of inclination towards that thing (aunmukhydbhdva) indicates his abstention (nivftti) from that thing, but this is not possible without the experience of ananda (nirvftti); that is why one does not advance towards that which one dislikes; and knowledge is not possible without cit.” (§D I, 24-25).Similarly:“Because one desires, therefore one proceeds to know or do. Activity takes place only with desire. O f this (i.e., of activity with desire), two aspects have to be assumed, viz. the earlier and the later (SD I, 19). The earlier consists of the acquisition of ananda (beatitude) accruing from accomplishing a deed; the later consists of its inclination towards manifestation which is its expansion.

In this particular context what is meant to be said is that iccha Sakti cannot be grasped by means of the objects of icchd (desire) with which it is associated, for objects owe their very existence to iccha or desire.16. Heterogenous intermixture is such as r = r + b f “ f+f* /=* /-[-1, / = /+*, e = a+i, ai = a+ey o*=a+u, au=*a-\\-o. There is no intermixture from d to u as they are homogenous.

After this, the expansion of manifestation is withdrawn into the unity of anuttara. The dot (bindu) in ‘a//*’ is symbolic of the dissolution of the inner mani­festation in anuttara.This inner manifestation is the bimba or origin of its pratibimba or reflection in the external manifestation in the world. The inward manifestation is accomplished inwardly in anuttara itself and is known as svardpa-sfsfi or the manifestation within the inward nature itself.The vowels from V to cau’ represent the inner manifestation within anuttara, and the vowel atji represents the dissolution (sarfi- hdra) of the inner manifestation within anuttara itself and identi­fication with *cinmaya-purusa-tattva* i.e., with Sdmbhava-tattva.The developed form of icchd-iakti is jndna-takti, and the deve­loped form ofjfidna-iakti is kriya-Sakti.

In manifesting the world, there is no vikdra or change in Siva. All manifestation is the outcome of his Sakti, but he is not changed in the gross physical world.

With the addition of the six referred to above,the total becomes thirty-six tattvas.Thus Siva-6(/a i.e. svara (vowel) becoming condensed through its autonomy and abiding in the fdkta-rdpa in a iakti form as kusuma (blood) is called yoni i.e. a consonant.3 (By the combi­nation of Siva-^i/a and $dkta-yoniy there is universal manifestation).T hat red sperm of Sakti or female principle according to the principle referred to before, consisting of three angles viz., grdhya (object), grahana (knowledge), grdhaka (subject) when mingled with the semen of Siva or male principle becomes the place of procreation (visargapada) or external expansion. It is only by the meeting of both Siva and Sakti that there is the activity of pu$pa or the female creative red sperm, i.e. in the female aspect, it is known as yoni or female organ of generation because of its fitness for mating by the Siva aspect or male. Therefore, that red sperm (kusumam eva) itself being three-angled represents the^ani or female organ of generation.

The triadic Sakti of the Supreme is known as Bhairavi. The meeting point or union of Siva and Sakti now appears in the form of a hexagonal (fafkona) mudrd and being the spot and basis of the generation of manifestation is designated as yoni or the female organ of generation. (While both Siva and Sakti are separately triadic, their union is hexagonal) .6In the chapter on khandacakravicdra in Kubjikamata, it is with reference to this m atter that it has been declared: “There is mahdmdyd above mayd who is the very embodiment of bliss because of her being of a triangular aspect.” Therefore, the union of Siva and Sakti which is represented by semen (bija) and ovum (kusu~ ma) being fused into one compactness should be worshipped by oneself in the form of his Self. This is what has been advised in T rikatantrasara:“The spiritual aspirant who experiences his identity with the incipient unity of Siva-Sakti found in icchd-iakti and with their compact unity found in jnana-Sakti should worship the highest triad of the union of the triangular aspect of Siva and the triangu­lar aspect of Sakti.”Therefore, though the condensation of the phonemes becomes distinct only in the vaikhari or gross aspect, yet it abides primarily in the supreme verbum (pardvdk) which is all inclusive (sarvasarvd- tmaka).In that (i.e. in para), even the organs of speech (sthdna) such as throat, lips and manner of articulation (karana) are all-inclu­sive. This is the special point to be noted. Even inwardly one mutters and envisions. This is a m atter of distinct experience. Their difference is due to the various organs of utterance, for audition is the very life of the letters. Moreover, even a child, when he is being taught the use of words, learns the names of various objects by muttering the words within. Even while he thinks in the opposite way or in an uncertain way, so long as he uses his mind, he does know something. All understanding is due to use of words. So letters which are produced by contrac­tion of the throat (samvdra), expansion of the throat (vivdra), which are unaspirated (alpaprdna) and which are aspirated (mahdprdna) with the aid of breath and sound are present, ac­cording to their appropriate nature, inwardly (in madhyamd and"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"Abhinavagupta177paJyanti,) as they are in vaikhari). Otherwise (i.e., if it were not so) then on account of there being no difference in the letters produced by the same organ of articulation, the powers of the senses uttering the letters separately would disappear even in vaikhari. Besides diversity of ideas like ‘I hear* (in vaikhari) and ‘I heard* (in madhyamâ and paiyanti) ; ‘I see* (in vaikhari) and ‘I saw’ (in madhyamâ and paJyanti); ‘I ideate’ (in vaikhari) and ‘I ideated’ (in madhyamâ and paSyanti) would otherwise be impos­sible (i.e., if these diversities were not present in the inner states).So by this repeatedly thought-out reasoning, entering more and more in the interior, cherish that consciousness which is a mass of awareness and is all-inclusive,6 and therefore the abode of guttural and labial energies (also), and in which inheres that creative I-consciousness, viz. aharp. which is the very quintessence of auto­nomy, which is the venerable phoneme, the highest mantra, and is (always) inherent within. If one were to object, “in that undiff­erentiated mass of consciousness, how can there be a division like: this is the organ of utterance, this the articulation, this the letter etc.?” my reply would be: “ that unbounded, absolute freedom brings about in the supreme Self of every one different apprehen­sions like ‘this is a ja r’ (external object); ‘this is happiness’ (internal object); ‘this is knowledge’ (pramâna); ‘I am the kno- wer’ (pramâtâ or subject).” In this diversity of experiences what and how much is the exertion?7Therefore one and the same venerable supreme verbum (ekaiva parâbhaf(ârikâ)y being all inclusive, abides as the highest Lord in all, whether stone, tree, animal, man, god, Rudra, pralayâkala or vijhânâkala (kevali), M antra, MantreSvara, M antramahesvara and others. Therefore, Mâtfkâ whose body consists of letters (and sounds) which reside in various stations as their very soul either in indistinct (asphufa) or imperceptible (avyakta) way as in madhyamâ or indistinct (sphufa) or perceptible (vyakta) way as in vaikhari is declared as the efficacious potency of mantra (mantravirya).Similarly it is said that the same note produced at different places in different instruments like the vinâ, vipanci (a vinâ with nine strings), kacchapi (another vinâ with a tortoise-shaped sound­board), muraja (a kind of drum ) is said to be belonging to the same register (ekasthâna) . 8"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"178Pard-TrUikd- VivarariaSimilarly, the basic or the starting note (sthdyi svara) in diff­erent registers, such as bass (mandra), middle (madhya) and upper (lard) is said to be the same. Similarly the same phoneme is produced in some creatures from different organs. For instance, it is found that in crows, the sounds lka\\ ‘(d and Va* are pro­duced jointly by so many organs, such as stomach, anus, throat, palate. Though they (ka, fa, ra etc. of crows) are indistinct, they are all right in themselves, being phoneme, and a phoneme apart from Mdtjkd is impossible. If it is said that certain phone­mes are separate from Mdtjkd, and being indistinct and meaning­less, they are useless, therefore, they should not be accepted, we say that this is not correct. There is usefulness even of an indi­stinct phoneme, such as the sound of a muraja (a kind of drum ) or of an ocean in as much as it is helpful in bringing about joy or sorrow. W hat othei utility is desired? In Saiva Sastra also, mostly those have been chosen as mantra whose phonemes are indistinct, for instance (indistinct sound of pranava in) ardhacan- dra etc. are said to be the very essence of a mantra. It is also said that the mantra at the stage of nirodhini makes only a hissing sound. The (indistinct) sound of bell, cymbal etc. which strikes the ear has also been (agreeably) indicated in the teaching about ndda- yoga. It has been said in Guhyayogin! T antra: “As the horse neighs, as the tame ox bellows, as the lion roars, as the camel produces a guttural sound, even so the powerfulyoginis (balddhikdh) by m utt­ering a mantra (of indistinct sound) draw down the very life of paius (empirical beings). This is the application of mahdmantra which is used in drawing towards oneself even that which cannot be overpowered” . This is only an expedient.In fact, “ It is the inner sound that is mantra” . Mahdmantras which have distinct and meaningful phonemes can be easily used both by you and us.Therefore, the indistinct sound also is definitely of the form of phoneme, just as a jar placed even at a distance is ja r all the same. This is settled. That a phoneme, though produced in different places, through the difference of prdna, like that of a bird or kettle-drum etc., is the same phoneme—this is also settled. Therefore what the sage Patafljali says, viz. “ There can be a knowledge of the sound of all beings to the yogi,” is fully realized by me now.

When those indistinct phonemes also (i.e. the asphufa or indistinct phonemes like those of birds etc.) acquire the status of words which have perfectly clear meaning (lit., whose meanings are really identical with those words) like distinct phonemes (varndndmiva), then according to the principle mentioned, the cooing of birds and even the sounds of kettle drum etc. become full of meaning. Then as the cooing of birds has some meaning, even so the sound of drum may be indicative of either conquest or defeat (in battle). It is from that point of view only that the different Sutras of Sik§a (the sci­ence of proper articulation and pronunciation of words) etc., according to some (hay and visarga are to be pronounced ‘from the chest’, according to others, they are to be pronounced ‘from the root of the teeth’, can have some sense, not at all other­wise. This is the reason why on the basis of slight difference, grammarians being in doubt about the different forms of pho­nemes have increased the list of phonemes to sixty-four by con­sidering the following as different phonemes:1. JihvdmUllya and upadhmdniya from visarjaniya.102. The five yama akjaras: nurji, Hurji, nurjxy nurjiy murji as different from the five nasal phonemes nay Ha, nay na, ma though they are only varied forms of the latter.113. By taking the varied form of day $(ha, yay ray lay vay k$a by means of a short form of articulation as different from those letters.In this division of phonemes, there is the same difference between f and r as between vowel and consonant. It has been said in Trikaratnakula also: “The Mdtfkd whose variety has been deter­mined by multiplying eight by eight (8x8 = 64) alone should be considered as kulacakra (i.e. iakti cakra).12 That kulacakra per­vades the entire universe. The difference of these 64 phonemes has been determined in detail in the work ‘Matrkajfianabheda*."},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"180Pard-Trtfikd-VivaranaHere (i.e. in Trika), there is no fondness for that procedure for integral wholeness or perfection is the essence of this system. So, there is such method of the entrance into the supreme conscious­ness everywhere. W hether in jndnaSakti (sahkalpyamdnah) or in kriyafakti (kriyamdnah), every object rests on the superb splendour of the mantra of supreme verbum, viz. the pure, creative I-con- sciousness (vimarfatma) which is one’s essential nature (svarupa- bhuta) and which is non-mdyiya (non-empirical) and unconven­tional (asanketika). It is that state which is lauded by all the schools of philosophy as indeterminate (nirvikalpa). T hat splen­dour of the supreme mantra {paramantramahah) is present in earth category etc. both in unmixed or mixed state in the form of vowels (bija) and consonants (pin^la) in phonemes like cka’ etc. Other­wise there would have been no difference between the deter­minate different pairs of knowledge, such as M eru-mountain and Jujube fruit, water and fire, ja r (an external experience) and pleasure (an inner experience) and their indeterminate know­ledge. Even determinate knowledge (vikalpa) which arises only from the heediessness (of the indeterminate state) would have followed the same path (i.e. in that also there would not have been mutual distinction). On the contrary, it could not have been able to make the distinction-less indeterminate state as the basis of all distinctions. The fact is that the mantra (of I-consciousness or pardvak) which transcends all conventionality is taught as the object of worship by the all-knowing teachers even when they know that that mantra is the source of all the mutually distinctive conventions. It is, indeed, in that non-conventional splendour of the supreme verbum (vdnmahasi) i.e. into aham (I) that all em­pirical (mdyiya) conventional symbols so terminate that they i.e., the mdyiya (empirical) symbols attain identity with that trans­cendental, non-conventional mantra, viz., aham. The only signi­fication of those empirical (mdyiya) conventional symbols con­sists in the attainment of the experience of the essential nature of the non-conventional, there is no other signification of these sym­bols. By constant repetition when one enters the sphere of the non-conventional, one recollects clearly that the consciousness of the word ‘go’ (cow) attained in a remote past (or in a previous life) and later, on the occasion of conventional use, the conscious­ness attainable of a visible cow—both merge ultimately in a higher"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"Abhinavagupta181sphere of another kind of consciousness transcending conventiona­lity and beyond the pale of mdyd. Even in a child, there is at first, the predominance of only cit (pure, unconditioned consci­ousness). Therefore, even in the present life after a previous one, there exists in him a consciousness which transcends conventiona­lity. Otherwise there would be no support for his conventionality to stay. So it is on the basis of the non-conventional that there can be the possibility of the comprehension of the conventional, not otherwise. This is what was ascertained by venerable Utpala- deva in his commentary on ISvara-pratyabhijfia.13The means for entrance into the non-conventional state is described in the following words by revered Kanthapada: “ Where one sees something else, hears something else, does something else, talks something eke, thinks something eke, eats something eke—in all such conditions, there is the stance of the non-conventional reality (i.e. it is the non-conventional that controls all these functions). The attention is cast elsewhere, the eye is directed elsewhere. T hat is how prdna always proceeds effortlessly.” (Sv. T. V II, 58).So, the conventional sign i.e., the determinate knowledge (saoikalpaka jnana) pursuing its source terminates in the anuttara or the transcendental state. T hat transcendental state whose very nature is an eagerness always to exhibit that kind of multitudinous variety, always goes on expanding from the point of view of mani­festation (visarga).It is that impukion to manifest that brings about expansion upto ‘ha* aspect. O f that, viz., of that impukion to manifest (visargasya) there is the aspect of Sakti-kun<jlalini designated as half of Via’ (in Trika) which assuming the shape of a dot (bindu) that is a means of identity with the essential nature of Siva, passes back again into the anuttara (transcendental) state, and thus rests in the essential nature.The consciousness symbolized by one phoneme, viz. V i.e., the anuttara or transcendental consciousness indeed by its very nature transcends all concept of space, time and causality and which, according to the previously stated principle, is wholly perfect, resorts instantly to the stage of para visarga, i.e., the supreme stage of manifestation.It is only after connexion with the stage of para-visarga i.e."},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"182Pa rd- Trtfikd- Vivaranathe supreme creative elan, that there is the stance of dnanda> iccha, tiana, unme§a, its expansion, i.e. Unatd or Q> its diversity i.e., f, fy U f and the product of kriydSakti viz. e, ai> o, au.T hat supreme, energy of manifestation {para or idmbhava visarga ) becomes supreme-cum-non-supreme energy (parapara) which expands because of its excessive plentitude and because of its being inseparably connected with that supreme energy {svasattd- ndntarikatayd) and instantly becomes the aspect of ‘ha? i.e., apara visarga or external manifestation. It is the acquisition of the state of cha\\ i.e. external manifestation that actually brings about the existence of a network of innumerable categories symbolized by *ka* etc. It is again this very cha k a li or external manifestation which entering the bindu i.e., arp, of ‘aharp.* terminates into the anuttara state.Thus it is that supreme venerable Goddess, the supreme ver- bum who is only one, non-dual, wholly integral and perfect and who is present as sarjivedanasattd, i.e. as vimartomayi-kriyaJakti or conscious Creative Energy. There is no question of succession (of space, time and form) in this act of manifestation. In the aspect of manifestation, this is known as ‘aharjC {a-ha-m) or Siva-Sakti-nara; inversely in the aspect of withdrawal this is known as or flara-Sakti-Siva. Though appearing as two, this is really one consciousness.Thus, everywhere, even in the consciousness of jar (external), or pleasure (internal) etc., it is the I-consciousness whose whole treasure consists in calm repose within itself. As has been said by U tpaladeva: “The resting of all objective and subjective ex­perience within oneself is what is meant by I-feeling,, (Ajatfa- pramatr-siddhi, verse 22). In reality, that I-consciousness is all- inclusive according to the principle already enunciated (viz., sarvarp. sarvdtmakarji—everything is in everything). T hat I-con­sciousness is Bhairava Himself pervaded by the Supreme Energy. As has been said by myself in the following hymn of praise:“ I make an obeisance, through my own joy, to that highest reality which is wondrous delight {paramdrtha-camatkfti) which blossoms forth everywhere in the multitude of objects without cessation {bhdva-pafale parijndbhamdna viccheda-iunya), which is the I in the perfect mode of existence {pdrnavftti aham iti), which is full of lustre (devim), whose nature it is to shed light all round"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"Abhinavagupta183(prathanasvabhdvdrji) and who abides in one’s own self (svdtmasthi- tirji)” . One should understand that this is the doctrine that has been taught in the Advayasampattivartika composed by Vamana. So it is settled that the phoneme V only is endowed with fullest richness i.e., is perfect in every way. In words like ‘har$a*, cgha(a\\ *nila\\ the letters ‘fo’ etc. have to be combined together with the preceding and the following letters (in order to make a com­plete word). Otherwise (i.e., if the letters are not combined in a synthetic whole), if only the last letter is added to the group of letters such as *ha\\ etc., it would not form a complete whole, the word would be concealed within and would be unable to give rise to a concept.14Thus in all kinds of knowledge, all the divinities of letters {devatdh i.e., varna-deuatdh) arising together simultaneously, would bring about concepts of strange kinds. It is with this idea in view that in the chapter on kdla (time) in Svacchanda Tantra it has been described that in the duration of one breath, even in the sixteenth part or one tufi or space covered by 21 fingers of one breath (of a yogi), there are, along with an explanation of the passage of sixty or its double number of years, the rise and dis­solution of eight Matrkas, eleven Rudras, ten guardians of quar­ters (lokapdlas), twenty-seven constellations, eight Nagas and other divinities. Thus, timelessness is the highest truth of reality. If the highest Reality is what is to be decidedly the empirical (mdylya) measure of truth, it would only lead to atheism (in as much as it is beyond the empirical understanding). But in the supreme or transcendental consciousness, it appears immediately in that state (of timelessness). Therefore, what has been said, by way of teaching viz., ‘he sees something else, thinks something else*, etc., refers to one anuttara consciousness {ekasydmeva jndna- kalanaydrji) that anuttara or transcendental consciousness being the substratum (simultaneously) of the three divinities, viz. pard {para vdk), pardpard {pafyantl and madhyamd), and apard {vaikhari) is certainly invariable truth. Really speaking, the highest truth of all kinds of knowledge is I-consciousness.So this is established, viz., the supreme divine impulse to mani­festation (visarga in its aspect ofprasdra or expansion) in its pleni­tude of beatitude {dnanda-iaktibharitah) goes on ejecting the entire cosmos which is lying within it first as para visarga and then in its"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"184Para- Tritikd- Vivaranaprogressive congealment, it becomes external manifestation (lha? i.e., apara visarga) (hakdrdtmatdmpratipadya) and the visarga simul­taneously goes on reabsorbing its manifestation in its aspect of sarjihdra or withdrawal and after diverse combinations finally it becomes ‘kja'.1* This very emanation (sa eva esa visargo) whose nature it is to give rise to a multitude of innumerable objects which spring up from the middle sujumnd stage (madhyamasau- furrma padocchalat-tattadanantabhdvapafaldtma), now making a com­bination of two consonants16 (dutydtmakaSaktayoni-sarjighatta)yViz. of the appropriate consonants (ka and sa) which in active state resorts to a state in which there is no actual impact (andhata- ndda-dafaJrayanena) (and thus) putting an end to all combination (viilifyan) enters the transcendental stage which is constant (dhruvadhdmni anuttarapade). This has been said even before.18Notes1. From V to *arji\\ there are 15 kalas (energies of letter) and ‘ah' is the sixteenth kald. This is the essential nature of the Lord. This sixteenth kald of ah is known as visarga-kald. From ‘ka' to ‘kfa* which represents external manifestation, there is always prasdra-safikoca (expansion-contraction), but the visarga-kald re­mains changeless in its nature. In prandyama also, fifteen tufis go on increasing or decreasing but the 16th tufi remains unchanged. In the moon also, 15 digits go on increasing or decreasing, but the 16th digit, the background of all and hidden from view, remains unchanged.The visarga iakti or the emanative Energy of Siva is called amfta kald, because in spite of all the changes brought about by the energy of Siva, Siva or His energy does not undergo any change whatsoever.(a) Pard visarga iakti: There are three phases of visargaiakti- pardy pardpard and apard. Pard is also known as idrfibhava or Saiva visarga. It is transcendental emanation, an interior emanation within the divine consciousness. It is the source and primary principle of dnanda or the highest divine beatitude.

It is known as idkta visarga.(c) Apard visarga-iakti or apara visarga :This brings about the diversity of empirical manifestation, the manifestation of limited beings. This is why it is also known as dnava visarga. It is represented by the phoneme ‘ha'.2. Sakti is said to be mouth (vaktra) of Siva because it is through Sakti that one can get entry in Siva. The guru is also like Siva. Visarga-iakti is also like guru-mukha. Therefore in this context visarga-iakti is also called ‘guru vaktra.'3. It is difficult to bring out the double entendre used in this passage. Siva represents the male-principle and Sakti the female principle. Siva-bija is the white semen of the male, and kusuma the red menstruation of the female. In the present context the bija is the svara or vowel andyoni, the female organ, is the conso­nant. Just as the combination of the male semen and the female sperm gives rise to fetus, so the bija of Siva and yoni of Sakti brings about the full consonant.4. Kusuma and pufpa (lit. flower) are symbols of procreative energy.5. The union of èiva.-trikona which is bija and Sakti-trikona which is yoni is known as Safkona mudrd.

If it were to spread simultaneously in all the organs of articulation, then there would ensue simultaneity in the utterance of all the sounds.

The root *svr' means (i) those which utter a sound {iabdayanti) i.e. indi­cate a delightful mental mode (sucayanti cittaiji) and (ii) which (in the state of withdrawal) yield their essential nature to Siva, the highest subject (svaiji ca svarupam dtmdnaiji ranti),” i.e. which dissolve completely in anuttara.e Thus the word 4svarah’ means “those which transmitting their essential nature to the highest experient (i.e. anuttara) offer themselves i.e. get dissolved in anuttara (as vowels) (in the aspect ofsarfihara or withdrawal) and offer their form as consonants like ‘¿a’ etc. i.e., display (existents) externally (in the aspect ofprasdra or expansion).

How? The answer is *kramdt* (verse 6).The etymological meaning of kramdt is the following: “Krama-\\* at which is derived from the root 'ad* ‘to devour* means devouring of succession (kramasya adanam-bhakfanam) i.e., swallowing up of time (kdla-grdsah)” . Kramdt is used here in an adverbial sensei.e. ‘by swallowing up time*.‘Suvrate’ in verse 6 means the following: su—iobhana or magni­ficent. Vrata = holy practice. Suvratdy therefore, means one who has two holy practices, viz.

So *dkfdnta* would mean ‘one who does not end with the sensuous perception from before* (aindriyakdnamante samlpe prdgaparyavasand yd). This dkfdntd is the adjective of srffi. Figuratively, this means that this is manifestation in which there is an unparalleled taking away or seizure (apdrvam dharanarji), that is to say, in which there is the withdrawal of manifestation by way of entrance within the Self (svdtmanupraveSdtma-svarupam sarjihdra-rdparji yasydrji).This creative goddess, viz., Mdtrkd is the source of all vidyd or knowledge assuming the form of vedand or inward feeling, indi­cative of the throb of Sakti, and as a product of germinal energy in the form of Siva-bija or vowels and prasara or consonants, of the attribute of protection or reflection of the mantras in the form of vdcya i.e. the devatds or inherent goddesses and their vdcakas or wordings.

In prdnacdra, the point within from which prana arises is known as antah-dvadaJanta, and the point where it ceases externally is known as bahyadvadaSanta. On the other hand, in apdnacdra, the external point where prdna arises is known as bahyadvadalanta and the point where it ceases internally is known as antahdvadalanta. The space between these two dvadadantas is 36 fingers or 16 tufis.

Movement (calanam) in this context is not to be taken in the sense of physical movement. It is an inward pulsation or throb in Consciousness denoting the ever-present activity of the delight of Self-consciousness of the Divine. It is the dynamic activity of Consciousness. It is motionless movement so to speak. Just as a wave in the ocean rises up only in the ocean itself but does not move out, even so ‘spanda’ is a throb in the divine consciousness of Siva-Sakti.Spanda is of two kinds, samanya (general) and vifefa (particular). Samanya spanda is the foundational spanda of Siva-Sakti, on which is based the working of the gunas of prakfti which are the vtie$a spanda, leading to particular experiences of psychic and physical phenomena. The particular experiences are popularly known as the spanda of Sakti.12. 'Amuld' has also been used in two senses, viz.

The sense of this is that the entire phonematic manifestation is only dtat or expansion o f‘a’.14. So long as varnas or phonemes exist only in the mind, they are known as mantra.

From the portion ‘it is anuttara even of uttara* it has been described in detail that the expansion of manifestation (consisting of 36 tattvas) is due to kula or Sakti. It has been deter­mined that even the subsequent one i.e. expansion of the universe has the anuttara or the transcendental as its precedent. Now it is the nature of the transcendental which requires a detailed consideration. So while considering both prescriptive rule (vidhi) and explanatory reiteration (anuvada), the nature of both vidhi and anuvada has to be characterized. In the mental recitation of the name of Siva (which is vidhi), and the appearance of all happiness (which is anuvada) both are discernible. Though in this system, anuttara or the transcendental is nothing different from the uttara or the posterior—for if it were something other, that would also fall within the category of the uttaray even then"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"202Pard- Tritikd- Vioaranathere is this difference brought about by the autonomy of the Lord from the point of view of the disciple and the teacher.

O r this sauh or amftabija is the bhairaviya hrdaya of the narabhdva or phenomenal aspect which is only of the essence of Sakti {tftiyarji brahntabhairavdtmdnah nah bhairavdtma hfdayarfi: nah in this syntax means asmdkam i.e. of our system). 9-10.He who is not born of yogini1 or is not united with Rudra® cannot clearly obtain this (i.e., sauh).

The heart or the essence of that iakta nature is Siva who is held in firm embrace by the divine Sakti, viz. the venerable supreme power (pard).By the word ‘Bhairava’ is to be understood Sakti, the Divine Energy, of the universe according to the principle that every­thing is the form of everything else (sarvasarvdtmakatd vapuh).The heart or the essential nature of the phenomenal reality (nara rUpasya) permeated by that Sakti is Siva who is identified"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"Abhinavagupta205with the supreme non-differentiation {partna abhedena) by the above principle, for without this even differentiation would not be possible i.e. if Siva and Sakti were not prevalent in phenomenal reality, its state of difference would not have been possible. This has been stated before. Stdront (O with beautiful hip and thighs), is the vocative case. (A.G. by splitting bhairavdtmanah into twoi.e. bhairavdtma and ‘miA* and by adding hfdayarji with sufroni and turning it into a compound word, viz. sidroQi-hfdayarji gives the following explanation:)T hat which is irremovably involved even in repugnant mdyd and consists of pure consciousness is the core between the two thighs, viz., the female organ (yonirQpam). The Sakti in the form ofyoni (female organ) is the state of Bhairava that indicates the wholeness (purnatd) of the nara-bhaua or phenomenal reality which includes within itself the entire host of experients from sakalas (i.e. limited experients), (divinities like) M antra, M antra- maheSvara down to immobile beings (like plants etc.) whose very life consists of empirical I-feeiing and which is rightly designated as ‘ours* (nah).The Explanation of tjtiyam brahmaBrahman (accepted in Trika) is that in whom the virility of the universe is inherent and who is full of the mass of bliss (dnanda- /aktighanarji) that is surging forward for visarga-vtilcfana i.e. visarga or separation from Siva and viile§ana or union with Sakti. Such Brahman is vast (bjhat), all-pervading (vydpaka) and fully nurtu­red with the union of Sakti. This Brahman is certainly not like that which is accepted by the readers of Vedanta and which is not far removed from absolute nihilism. This is called the third Brahman, because it is more identical with Siva than nara or Sakti. Therefore, in Tantras and particularly in Paratrisika (atra)y this i.e. the union of the male principle and the female principle is the very core which has been taught as the object of worship. Even in the case of ordinary people whose mind has not penetrated into the core of that sort of virility, by the mere pursuit of external ritual, the bonds that govern the state of pafu1* (limited empirical being) become at first gradually slack and finally completely loosened, at first slowly splitting and then finally completely split asunder and then they automatically"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"206Pari- Trtiikd- Vivaranaattain to the state of penetrating into that core (which is the union of Siva and Sakti). This penetration into the core is not like a literal statement as in “ I have entered the heart, it is the supreme goddess’’, rather it is the search inside the heart. This has been already said in detail. “Neither the restrictions of Sastras (reli­gious texts) can confine the heart within narrow limits, nor can popular views contaminate consciousness. That alone is the state of plenitude which is infused with the joyful condition of absorp­tion or khecari samya which is completely replete with the attri­bute of the essential nature of the Divine” . As has been said by myself in one of my hymns: “ In those whose mind has been made purer by being fully dominated by devotion unto you, this state is clearly established in the heart in a moment.” Therefore on the angles (i.e. para, pardpard and apard) of the triangular Sakti, the three goddesses and in the centre the transcendental goddess who is the churning Sakti of Bhairava, the embodiment of supreme beatitude19 have to be worshipped. In the tradition of the deities, there is bliss through kfobhdtmaka visarga which is due to the inces­sant flow of bliss of the eternal beatitude.20 Inydmala or vira-yogini or vira-ddti tradition, there is physical union (satfighafta) between the vira and yogini. The purpose is only to stimulate the nityd- nanda or eternal beatitude by means of the contact of sex-organs. By this contact, there is kyobhdimaka visarga. It gives intense delight.21 In a single person (ekavirataydmapi) occurs also by con­centration of the mind on the essential delight of the Self the same (sexual) delight. In the case of the ordinary run of m an­kind, on the occasion of intercourse, on account of the close compactness of the union of the sexual organs of the man and the woman right from the deepest part upto the foremost part, the mind of both is dissolved (in the supreme Sakti), and the delight that resides in the ejaculatory part of the sexual organ of man and the nether aspect of the triangular region i.e. the^om or the female sexual organ is consequently exceedingly generated.22 In this connexion, the mystic sense of the intercourse has been expressed in the following verse:“One should throw (i.e. concentrate) the delightful mind in the middle of vahni (the region of contraction) and vi$a (the region of expansion) both ways, whether by itself or permeated by vdyu (pranic breath). One would then be joined to the bliss"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"Abhinavagupta207of sexual union” 23 (V. Bh. verse 6 8). Thus it is the association of beatitude which is the worship of the ‘heart* i.e., the essential nature of parddevi.As has been said in Trikatantrasara:24“The expansion of beatitude is ‘worship*. One should per­form this worship on the Trikona (triangle) 26 with sweet smell like that of flowers, incense etc., which give satisfaction to the heart.’* Everything is pervaded with two mudràs which are essen­tially jnJmi and kriyd Sakti. Only among deities, the display of jnàna-mudrà or Siva-trikona is prominent internally and that of the display of kriyd-mudrd or Sakti-/rzAo«tf is external, whereas among the viras, it is just the reverse. So far as the entrance in the region of delight or madhya-dhâma i.e. sufumnd is concerned, there is both similarity and difference. It is from this point of view that it has been mentioned that the kriydJakti or the symbol of the female organ should be offered to jndnaSakti or the symbol of the male sexual organ.Notes1. Trtiyam brahma: The usual nomenclature of brahma is ‘aurji tat sat; Sat is the third brahma. ‘Sa’ with which begins the third brahma, viz. 'sat' is symbolically designated as the third brahma.2. TithUa or the lord of the vowels is ‘arji’. At the end of this comes ah or visarga. So sauh is the mantra that indicates anuttara or the transcendental.3. H eart or hjdayaip is the centre of Bhairava. It is the prati- ffhdsthdnarp—the place of repose of the Lord. In his commen­tary on verse 2 in P.T.V., A.G. says “paraiji pratisthdsthdnarp sarpvidàtmâhft”—the heart is the very consciousness of anuttara ; it is its most interior place of repose, the very centre of consciousness. In his commentary, L.V., A.G. explains it as “Bhairavdtmano bhagavatah Êabdardfeh utivaSarirasya hjdayarp sârabhütarp”. If we take the universe as a body, it would be its very heart, i.e., the very essence of the universe which in other words, is a mass of sound (congealed). Commenting on the word ‘hfdayarp’ occurring in verse 9, A.G. says in P.T.V. that it isyonirüpam, the source of all creative energy.4. Ordinarily,yoginis are those initiated ones who have acquired"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"208Pard- Trtfikd- Vivaranasupernatural powers. Here the word seems to be used for those deities who are liberated and identified with Siva.5. Rudra in this context, also appears to be a liberated soul, identified with Rudra Siva.6. The word 'yoga' stands here for supernatural powers and union with Siva.7. Satjiyak uccdra in this context does not mean mere vocal recitation, but silent, spontaneous, subtle movement of the mantra within. It is its union with the breath that leads to realization. Commenting on this in his L.V., A.G. says: “Asya bijasyoccdre prdnarupatdydrji samdvekna tavdt hjtamdtra eva jndnakriyaJakti-Sarird mantramudrah sadya eva sammukhaidm uccdrayitur dbhimukhyarp. prati- padyante” .“ When by the uccdra of this mantra, the yogi becomes totally absorbed in prdna, then by that alone, the mantras and mudrds which are the embodiment of knowledge (jhdna) and activity (kriya) turn towards the^o^i who is reciting the mantra and offer him all that he desires.”8. Smarate does not simply mean memorizing but constant attention on the mantra. T hat is why it has been translated as ‘has a mindfulness’.9. Muhurta = two ghafikds. One ghafikd = 24 minutes. So muhU- rta = 48 minutes.10. Cumbaka is iakta spar§a> the embrace of Sakti cakra occurring in sufumnd or madhya nail. Cumbaka means magnet. Just as a magnet draws iron-fillings towards itself, even so the ¿dkta-sparto draws the aspirants toward itself.11. The ‘mothers’ refers to the eight deities YoglSvarl, Brahml, MaheSvari, Kaumari, Vai§navi, Varahi, AindrI and Camunda presiding over the various groups of phonemes.12. They are chiels of theyoginis.13. A.G. says in his L.V. that the oiras are Aghora etc. In P.T.V. he says that the viras are the buddhi (intellect), and organs of action (kriyendriyakhydh etc.) when they are introverted to­wards Siva.14. Virefvaras: In L.V., A.G. says that these are the deities associated with navdimd mantra.15.

Svami Lakshmanjee thinks that they are a group of yoginis. They seem to be femalt yoginis who have acquired supernatural powers.17.

The three recommended to be worshipped are the pard (supreme), pardpard (supreme-cum-non-supreme) and apard (non-supreme) Saktis. The transcendental or pardtitd devi is in the centre.pardapard pardpard20. In the tradition of the deities, there is no physical contact with any female. Those aspirants who have attained to this level feel the influx of an internal delight owing to the awakening of the kundalini. Kfobhdtmaka visarga refers to the process of the flow of iabda (sound), sparia (contact), rdpa (form and colour), rasa (flavour), and gandha (smell) that well up out of sheer delight.This union is jndnamudrd, an internal spiritual union, not kriydmudrdy not an actual intercourse.21.

Smardnanda—the bliss of sexual union by recollection. There is no actual intercourse here. It is only ‘inverted kdma* or sexual delight.24. This book is not available now.25. Trikona is a technical word. It symbolizes both Sivdi-trikona in which jndnaiakti or the male sexual organ is predominant and Sakti-Zrifawa in which kriyd-iakti or the female sexual organ is predominant.

Hfdaya or heart is that which is linked with it (i.e. with anuttara). It has already been stated in detail that all things whether external such as ajar, o r internal, such as pleasure, take hold of that germ (the source of all existence) as the highest Reality. Therefore that (anuttara) is the heart or core (of Reality).2nd interpretation(A.G. gives this interpretation by splitting caturdaia into 'catur' (four) and daid(states).) This is an interpretation with reference to the phoneme V . T hat which is brahma, i.e., sdmarasya or equi­poise, in other words, which is the conjunction of the four states (caturdaia) i.e., ludyoga\\ 4avabhdsa\\ 4carvana* and 4vildpana5 of the subject and the object is the primal undifferentiated state. Being linked with that means \"inseparable from that*.The vowels which are up to the end o f4 3* are known as tithiia, because out of them, the other remaining phonemes are bom. The last ones of the vowels coming at the end of the above tithiia vowels are the four immortal phonemes viz., f, f, /, /. Brahma is well connected with these vowels. From the point of view of ascent, Siva who is higher than nara and Sakti is the third. There­fore, the third brahma is identical with supreme Siva.The subject (vedaka), moving forward by means of the four states of udyoga, avabhdsana, carvana and vildpana, with his eagerness increased by those states, dissolving the amjtakalds (i.e. r> f, A /) within his Self, unifies the entire objectivity with his Self. Thus, by accomplishing the fusion of the stir of the state of the subject and object within the Self, he enters the state of anuttara, the very heart of the universe which can be accessible only to jhdna (gnosis) characterized by identity, or yoga characterized by activity. As has been said in Bhagavadgita: 44One who is established in yoga regards everything as the same (divine) in all cases. He sees the Self (in all beings5) and all beings in the Self” 8 (VI, 30).3rd interpretation: (from the point of view of dnanda i.e., with re­ference to the phoneme cd \\)It is dnandaiakti (the power of beatitude) which is the base of"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"212Parti- TriSikti- Vi varan athe rise of pure7 icchtifakti (will), i.e. pure icchtiiakti is implicit in tinanda, In a reverse order, icchti is the third with reference to kriyti iakti (e.g. 1. kriyti, 2, jhtina, 3. icchti). This icchti (will) in its initial aspect, being untainted with desired objects is brahman (itadeva prtik-kotau-igyamtintidi-akalufam brahma),Caturdaia may be interpreted as forty by analyzing the word into ‘Caturye dafa.' i.e., four times ten. Bhairava together with his three iaktis (viz. parti or supreme, partiparti or supreme-cum-non- supreme and aparti or non-supreme) plus the thirty-six categories (tattvtini) would make forty.

The third is icchti. That is brahma; ‘brahma’ is one who is ‘brrphita* (grown, swollen, evolved).

CaturdaSayutarp? means ‘in which the forty tattvas or categories have mingled with one another’.Tithtta may be interpreted as follows : O f akula or anuttara who is the lord of the vowels (tithUvarasya akulamaya anuttardtmanah). Antah means sarjikjrtih i.e., absorption i.e., absorption in anuttara, i.e. the initial pulsation of kulaiakti that is absorbed in akula or anuttara.

TithUàntena means with the initial pul­sation. The whole thing means with the desire to shoot forth (prarurukfutayd) ; it is well linked with the initial pulsation of kulaiakti that is absorbed in akula, ‘the lord of the vowels*.

This has been indicated before. Its nature is U<jlhatd,i.e. to hold the division of the categories of existence prior to manifestation in jhdnalakti itself. In accordance with this estab­lished practice (rtitfhyd), the third brahma at this stage is that which holds the entire mobile and immobile manifestation within. In contrast to the cduddha sf^i (the entirely differentiated order of manifestation), and hiddhcduddha sftfi (the differentiated-cum- undifferentiated order of existence), it is a purely undifferentiated order of manifestation (.hiddha-sfs^ydtmakaiji).

Linked [yutam) with that void ether, the third brahma may be termed icchd. This brahma is full of the external glow of tithUvara, i.e. the sun.® Arka or the sun is the symbol of pramdna or knowledge.

Therefore, it is linked with that. This brahma being connected with some reality which follows the tithildnta i.e. the glow of fire (vahni)9 known as pramdtf-tejas is of the nature of the void (vyomdtma).11th interpretation: (the interpretation with reference to the phoneme /)As in f phoneme, the third brahma inherent in the phoneme / is iidna (Z-H = /) itself. This also is connected, on the one hand, with the ether, the inner void, the base of the four categories of earth, water, fire and air (caturdaia-yutam) and on the other, with something indefinable that follows the pramdtf-tejas (tithi- idnta).Only this one plunges with tremendous momentum into the fullest form of the void {paripQrna iunya) which is Bhairava itself.W hat this means is the following: When icchd together with iidna which is its own nature, reaches the vyoma plane (i.e., the plane of the void) of objective experience (vedya)y then it rests in slight luminosity for a while, suddenly enters the plane of the void (vyomebhUmim) which is unbounded {aparyantatdm) , invari­ably steady (niicaldm) almost like wood or stone. About such yogis as have entered the state of the void which is like deep sleep without the awareness of any object whatsoever (apavedya-su$upta), it has been said: “ Even the sound of a kettle drum or bronze cymbal cannot awaken him from his state of absorption” .12th interpretation: (with reference to e.)Now in accordance with the process explained before, when the six vowels (a, d, i, f, uy d) enter another, there occurs diversity of forms. Keeping this in view, the nature of the third brahma is as follows: When icchd (will) together with iidna (iy i) is oriented towards entering anuttara (a, d)y then it experiences the joy of the emotional excitement generated by the union of iakti-kjobha or icchd-iakti and anuttara, and this is what is said with regard to that state."},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"216Pard-Tritiká- Vivar anaSdmdnya spanda1 is the fourth state of the particular {viie§a) spandas of the qualities of consciousness flowing externally in the form of a vowel of slow tempo, predominantly of the nature of sattva, or a vowel of middle tempo, predominantly of the nature of rajas, or a vowel of fast tempo, predominantly of the nature of tamos.

The five main powers of Siva are anuttara (a) or cit, dnanda (represented by the phoneme d), icchd (represented by the pho­neme V ), jndna or unme$a (represented by the phoneme V ), and kriyd (represented by the phonemes, e, aiy o, au). Icchd comes after dnanda.2. This experience is known as vedaka-tdddtmya—the identity of the subject with all.3. This experience is known as vedya-tddatmya—the identity o f all manifestation with the Self.4. Icchd is implicit in dnanda. But in this aspect, it is not tain­ted by any desired object. Hence it is called pure.5. ‘Yu mtirane amiSrane vd*: The root ‘yu* connotes both mingling and separation. In this context it connotes mingling.6.

As soon as anuttara oriented towards external expansion begins to throb as oimarla, there is a lapse of its essential nature.

These substances (wine etc.) in as much measure as is obtainable destroy all taint of difference. The following process is generally observed. Doubt which brings about narrowness of mind is generative of the first sprout of the mundane tree, and then it expands, becomes mature, and finally brings about the very fruit (i.e., complete involvement) of m un­dane existence. It has been fabricated by the awakened ones in such a way that it may becomo stationary in the case of the un­awakened ones. In the case of fools, once a doubt is entertained, it gets rooted in their mind, it fructifies in diverse ways for them, according to their peculiar nature.Therefore, on account of diverse imagination doubts assume different forms and are described as adharma (unrighteous) etc. They vary according to each scripture, and each country. As has been said, “Just as a plunderer carries away the valuables of the house, even so depression saps away the vitality of the body.” (Sp. K. I ll, 8).When that doubt is instantly dissolved, then the stain of the trouble of the psycho-physical limitations of the aspirant is cast out {nirasta-pdSava-yantrana kalahko) and he enters the heart of Bhairava. Therefore, one should in every way, practise the discipline that leads to the heart of Bhairava. This is the sense of the teaching of Tilaka-Sastra.

On the contrary, even the stage of Siva which is plain liberation (and amftabija) is for the unfortunate ones always (i.e., in both nirvikalpa and savikalpa states) a desert or a vast forest owing to the fear of transmigratory state. “ (For the un­fortunate ones) there appears to be a heap of tangled flames in the form of submarine fire bursting forth from water.

T hat is not conventional; the etymological explanation of every word, owing to unforeseen destiny has not reached the common people. So the nature of the phoneme *sa* is also like this.

The supreme state of the Experient characterized by such ihd is svadehàveiah.

The eye for instance can only see, not hear.

By the word ‘ sady ah' (immediately) is suggested absorp­tion in the anuttara stage. ‘Tanmukhatám eti* means that after samáveša, one acquires supreme consciousness [para-rüpa). This penetration is not the like that of the animals whose real nature of Bhairava on the contrary is concealed. (Now A.G. takes up ‘muhürtam smarate’ for explanation). iMuhürtami in this context means ‘fortyeight minutes’. Though amftabija is undetermined by time [akàlakalitatve\\pi) yet the word ‘muhürta* is used here with reference to the experience of other experients which is temporal (para-kalanâpeksayâ). ‘Yah smaratV means he who esta­blishes congruous connexion with amftabija (anusandhatte). He alone holds captive (sambadhnati) i.e. makes identical with him­self (svátmani ekikaroti) the multitude of mantra and mudrá already explained because of his unity consciousness (advqyatah). How does he do so? He alone can do it who by means of cumbaka i.e. by means of šakta-šarira which contacts the universal aspect, having impressed with mudrâs on ail fronts, establishes congruous connexion with amftabija.The particle ‘/m’ is used in the sense of certainty.

There­fore, it has *sakfdvibhatatva\\ i.e. it is shining eternally. Therefore has it been said. It is because of this i.e. limitation that the pre­sent time requires a reference to the past etc. i.e., to the past and the future. In the absence of limitation, because of non-appli­cability of expectancy, reality is undetermined by time. This has been repeatedly stated. It is the Lord alone who makes the variegated power of time manifest. “ Moreover in any waking condition, that which is considered to be a ghafikd i.e. twenty four minutes, in that very time those experients, who are under­going varied experiences in a dream, experience the diversity of a day, three hours (prahara), a year etc.” .(Now A.G. is giving an interpretation of the fourteenth verse, viz. praharadyadabhipretam.. .rudraJaktibhih.

A state of indecision or doubt depends on two alternatives, e.g., whether this is the trunk of a tree or a human being. Even this uncertainty has an element of certainty about it (for certainly it is one of these and cannot be anything else). Thus the divine power achieves what is hard to accomplish.Explanation of prahara...smaranaSuch a yogi is verily Bhairava who has the power of memory which is pardpara i.e. which assimilates a past experience to a present one. That is why it has been said only in ‘two praharas9i.e. by placing two cognitions {para and apara) together. The para or the previous or the past prahara is that of actual experience and the apara or the second prahara is the cognition of the sameness in the present. Remembering the amftabija in this way (i.e. in pardpara* way) he becomes settled in oyoma or empty space {vyomastho jdyate) i.e. he acquires the status of an experient in puryasfaka (at the time of perception or first experience) and idnya or void (at the time of apohana). When his perceptual experience is characterized by prahara i.e. by complete absorption, he deliberates upon it by calling it up in memory again and again. “Sakfdt padyati asarjidigdharfi...rudra ¿aktibhih” is connected with this as with the previous one. It has been said that till that time even the memory is like the original experience itself. It is said that he is united with the vikalpa fakti of the nature of apara i.e., apohana i.e., he experiences even the gap occurring between the first experience arid its recall.(Now A.G. is explaining the 15th and 16th verses).

Thus ‘saufi9 includes all the 36 tattvas.)Notes1. Brahmadehagam: Brahma in this context means ‘sa’. This interpretation is based on Bhagavadgita which says that Brahma is oniy tat, sat. The ‘t9 of ‘sat9 is dropped, and ‘sa9 is considered to be Brahma. It is generally called tftiyam brahma, the third name of Brahma, the first two names being om and tat.2. ‘a9 with: becomes ah i.e. visarga. The phoneme ‘a9 is gene­rally called ananta in Trika inasmuch as it is the basis of all ex­pansion.3. The word ‘para9 being repeated twice yields two meanings. The first para means ‘in the remaining’ and the second para means the supreme.4. Sakti-trayam means that which is constituted by three Saktis, viz. icchdy symbolic of Sadafiva, jfidna, symbolic of Ilvara, and kriyd, symbolic of Suddhavidya.Tex t o f t h e VerseTADANTARVARTI Y A T K lftC ITSUDDHAMARGE VYAVASTHITAM I ANURVlSUDDHAM ACIRATAlSVARAM jftA N A M ASNUTE // 23 //TranslationW hatever is established (in the universe), all that reposing in that i.e., sauh, is in the pure way i.e. it is implicit in saufr in a pure way i.e., without any mala or limitation.

Everything (in its place) is all- inclusive. Just as in the seed of the banyan tree lie all the re­levant parts, viz. sprout, branches, leaves, and fruits, even so this universe lies in the heart of the Supreme. The certain con­viction of this is (in itself) undoubted initiation for liberation (nirvana). As has been said:“This is the acquisition of ambrosia leading to immortality; this alone is the realization of Self (lit. grip of Self). This alone is the initiation of liberation (nirvana-dikjd) leading to identity with Siva” . (Sp. K. II, 7)There are other kinds of initiation also which may offer worldly enjoyments, but the insight into this (mantra) is the essential initiation. T hat is why it (Trika-Sastra) is superior to every other Sastra; it is even superior to Kulasastra.As in the weights of a balance, though there may be only a limited removal of the weight there arises a good deal of diff­erence in the measure of a thing only by slightly raising or lowering the balance, even so there occurs a good deal of di­fference in respect of the knowledge of space, time, and enjoy­ment of the higher and higher tattvas (categories of existence)."},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"Abhinaoagupta245It is even possible that the sphere of experience (saijwedana) rising higher and higher may exceed the thirty-six categories. Since insight (.saijwedana) into the hfdaya-blja or sauh is initiation (dikja), therefore is it said that vira and yogini who have pene­trated this insight (etat sarjivit anupravi^(o) stand initiated (kjta- diksan) by the grace of the I-consciousness described as revered, supreme Bhairava who is the ruler of the collective whole (cakre- Svara) of the twelve* external and internal sense-divinities (nz- imi-devatd-dvddaJaka) that are constantly present (satatodita) in the supreme reality (para-sattd) and are transcendent to mdyd (amdyiya). 25-26.Thus the way in which the transcendental (anuttara) state occurs without abandoning the external extension has been determined many a time both separately and in a composite way.Now this is what is to be said. In every Sastra it is said: “Those who are devoted to hfdaya-bija or sauh, the very import of Trika, even when they do not realize its full virility, are the very lord, in a veiled form, having entered the human body.”How is this worship to be performed?

The purport is that (according to the etymology of ‘nivedayet’ : nih—completely, veda- yet—one should experience or understand oneself). One should, in conformity to the Absolute Reality, consider one’s Self to be the Absolute Reality itself.
