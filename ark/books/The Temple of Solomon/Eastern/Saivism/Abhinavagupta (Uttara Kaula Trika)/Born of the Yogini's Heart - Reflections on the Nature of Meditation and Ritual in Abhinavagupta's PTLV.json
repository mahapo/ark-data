IntroductionIn his massive study entitled Abhinavagupta: AnHistorical and Philosophical Study, K.C. Pandey recountsthe traditional story which has it that Abhinavagupta wasnever seen to die, but rather disappeared along withtwelve hundred disciples into a cave in the mountains.The passage reads as follows:Unlike what has been written so far, we have no other authority than that of tradition for what we are going to write in the following few lines. We have not so far been able to trace any written authority on which this may have been originally based. The tradition, which, as we pointed out before, is current not only in the old Pandit families but also in some of the old Muslim houses in the locality, says that on one day Abhinavagupta, after finishing his work, as he thought, along with twelve hundred disciples walked into the Bhairava cave and was never seen again. The cave is there even now. It is about five miles from Magam, a place midway between Srinagar and Gulmurg. A village in its neighbourhoood and a brook running down below the hill, wherein the cave is, both are known by the name Bhlruva, and so is the cave itself. The writer visited the locality and went into the cave also... Down the hill was accidentally seen a religious minded and long bearded Mohammedan, bent double with age, slowly walking reclining on his slender stick. He was approached and questioned if he knew or had heard anything about the cave. The only information, that he could_ give was: \"I heard from my grand father thatAbnacarl went into it along^ with twelve hundred disciples but never did return.\"This fragment is important to the Historian of Religionwhether it is \"historically\" accurate or not. Indeed, we"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"4might almost be tempted to doubt its historical accuracyprecisely because it fits so neatly into the symbolicmatrix of Abhinavagupta's thought. The notion ofdisappearing into the cave links the themes of the caveor abyss (guha), with the traditional symbolism of the2cave of the Heart (hrdaya). The claims made in the passage concerning Abhinavagupta's supernaturaltranscendence of the human condition, his apparent bypassing of the usual passage into death, denote precisely his perceived status as an accomplished mahasiddha, a perfected one who has captured the cave of the Heart, the abode of Bhairava, the sky of consciousness itself. He is one who has consciously and directly reentered the primordial source.This myth-fragment, which has survived for almost a millenium maintained by local Kashmiri tradition, points directly to the central symbolic complex associated with Abhinavagupta's tantric formulations: to enter the heart-cave is to unite with the Goddess; to enter the heart- cave is to ascend to the most exalted level of consciousness, to return to the Goddess who is the creative power and the existential matrix of that consciousness. A dense network of symbolic equivalences is to be found here. To return to the cave is to attain"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"5immortality. To reenter the secret heart of things is todrink of the enlivening and immortalizing soma which,since the time of Indra and the slaying of Vrtra, is3contained in a huge vat, a cup, a chalice. Thiscontainer in turn becomes the crescent moon, the womb ofthe Goddess, of the YoginI, exuding life-givingsecretions, all of which are linked with the cave ofconsciousness from which trickles the flow of life-giving 4waters. Abhinavagupta consciously reenters the cave with his disciples, the cave in which, since the time of the Veda, the cows were hidden and then released by the masterful King of the Gods, Indra.^ To reenter the caveis to achieve physical immortality, to bypass the normalprocess of death. To reenter the cave is to journey to the moon (soma), which is not made of cheese, but of afiery, nacreous, congealed liquid, the soma, cold andsweet to the taste.^ To reenter the cave is to undertake a magical flight through the void, to move in the void (khecarl), to reenter the pulsating darkness, to reintegrate consciously with the creative matrix of the universe, and thus experience the ecstasy of the liberated being vibrating in the emissional power (visarga-&akti). ^The density and complexity of the symbolism of the"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"6Heart escapes our capacity to transcribe it into language.We begin with an apparently minor and unsubstantiatedmyth-fragment, the entry into the Bhairava cave. Then,just as when we idly pull at a loose thread in a piece ofclothing and watch as part of the garment unravels, so,when we tug gently on this myth-fragment, the entire 1framework of Saiva tantric symbolism threatens to become a pile of thread at our feet. The densely woven tantric symbolism of Abhinavagupta's thought can be entered into by this apparently inconsequential tale. We want to examine the \"garment\" of the Heart, but we must realize that these linear explications of the Historian of Religion, finally do not capture the dense weaving of the Tantra itself in which all meanings are juxtaposed simultaneously.The basis of this paper is a recent translation and study of the ParatrlSika-laghuvrtti (PTlv) ofgAbhinavagupta. In a recently completed study of this textIentitled The Triadic Heart of Siva, Kaula Tantricism in Abhinavagupta1s Kashmir Shaivism, I explored the concept of the Heart (hrdaya) as forming the central symbolic focus for the tantric sadhana prescribed by the great Kashmiri Shaivite master of the tenth century. As the primary textual focus of this study I presented a"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"7translation of Abhinavagupta's ParatrIsika-laqhuvrtti (PTlv), the Short Gloss on the Supreme, the Queen of the Three. The PTlv is a relatively short tantric manualcomposed sometime around the beginning of the eleventh century. It represents perhaps the most concise statement on the nature of tantric sldhana by this outstanding Shaiva master of medieval Kashmir. Abhinavagupta, considered the pre-eminent exponent of the group of traditions which has come to be loosely termed Kashmir Shaivism, presents in this text a self-sufficient path towards liberation based on a repose (viSranti) or_ Iabsorption (samavefea) into the triple Heart of Siva, theultimate reality.In my study of this text, I argued that the PTlvgives us direct access to the theoretical and practicalbases of one of the most obscure yet influential lineages9in the history of medieval \"Hinduism\": the Kaulas. Thislineage, which is neither properly a \"school,\" nor a separate \"tradition,\" contributes most directly to tantric formulations focusing on \"transgressive sacrality.\" The Kaula lineage, within which this text may be placed, taught a method of spontaneous and increasingly effortlessI _  _entrance into the triple Heart, known as the Sambhavopaya,Ithe method relating to Sambhu. By means of this advanced"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"8tantric discipline, the sadhaka could replicate the reality of the Heart in his own consciousness and attain freedom-in-life (jivanmukti), a state of embodiedperfection (kauliki-siddhi) , often known as the condition- . 10 of Bhairava.In addition, in my study I attempted to show that the Kaula emphasis on the direct and unmediated experienceIof the reality of Siva as symbolized by the Heart,provides a key entry-point into an understanding of thetantric worldview, generally, and the theoreticalformulations of Abhinavagupta, specifically. My study andtranslation of the PTlv aimed at reconstructing a coherentunderstanding of the Kaula lineage by examining a keyterm: hrdayangamibhuta, literally: \"become something thatmoves in the Heart,\" that is to say, conscious realizationor, more interpretively, \"experiential replication.\"^This important concept was explored in relation to twoother crucial ideas presented in the PTlv, the visarga-1¿akti: the emissional power of Siva, and the kula: the12embodied cosmos.Abhinavagupta (ca. 950-1014 C.E.) was a Kashmiri brahmin who is still probably best known for hiscontributions to the development of Indian aesthetictheory, particularly the exploration of the concepts of"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"9rasa and dhvani. However, as a result of the recentwork of several scholars including Pandey in India, Gnoliin Italy, and Padoux and Silburn in France, the extent ofhis contributions to the development of the Hindu tantra14are finally emerging. He is usually counted as beingthe most illustrious representative of the tradition called, for want of a better appellation, simply Kashmir Shaivism.^-5 This rather imprecise term refers to several related lineages of Northern Shaiva masters which include Vasugupta (ca. 9th cent.), transmitter of the foundationalI _text known as the Siva-sutra-s; his disciple Kallata, to whom are usually attributed the important Spanda-karika-s; Somananda, also ninth century, author of the influentialI _text known as the Siva-drsti, and his disciple Utpalacarya author of what has come to be recognized as the foundational text for the philosophical explication of the_ _   _ _ _ ^gtradition, the I¿vara-pratyabhijna-karika-s. Inaddition to these important intellectual forebears, the tradition which Abhinavagupta inherits, and comes eventually to synthesize, includes powerful influences from a number of celebrated agamic ¿astra-s. Of these, theMai ini-vi jaya-tantra is usually considered the most17 —authoritative. Abhinavagupta studied these agamic textsI _with his Kaula master, Sambhunatha, and dedicates a large13"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"10portion of his writings to an explication of the then developing Hindu Tantra, including the lineage of the«• i 18Kaulas.The PTlv may be grouped with four other texts inwhich Abhinavagupta explores this tantric environment.These are his encyclopedia of tantra entitled Tantraloka;a short summary of the TA, known as the Tantrasara; a longtext, the Paratrim&ika-vivarana which comments on the sameagamic verses commented on in the PTlv, and the Malinl-vijaya-vartika. It is in the PTlv, however, thatAbhinavagupta presents the most concise statement on the19nature of the tantric sadhana.20In the Tantraloka , Abhinavagupta reserves the' - 21highest praise for his teacher Sambhunatha, a master of the Kaula lineage who lived in Jalandhara (in the Panjab). Abhinavagupta, who traveled from Kashmir to study with this teacher, tells us that it was the initiation that heI _received from Sambhunatha that finally led him to 22enllghtenment.It is no accident, then, that the Kaula lineage holds pride of place in the tantric writings of Abhinavagupta. This tradition, whose name may be translated as the lineage of the Embodied Cosmos, teaches that the ultimate reality is the Heart. According to the"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"11tradition, the Heart is the Supreme (anuttara); it is theIvery self of Siva, of Bhairava, and of the Devî, the' 23Goddess who is inseparable from Siva. Indeed, the Heartis the site of their union (yamala), of their embrace(samghatta). This abode is pure consciousness (caitanya),as well as unlimited bliss (ananda).As consciousness, the Heart is the unbounded,infinite light (prakâéa), and the freedom (svitantrya) andspontaneity (vimarèa) of that light to appear in amultitude and variety of forms. The Heart is the sacred24fire-pit of Bhairava.I __ _The interesting feature of the Sambhavopaya lies inits utter simplicity. It presents a shortcut to freedomwhich sidesteps the enormous complexity of the meditationand ritual practices that had developed at this time. Inorder to follow this path the sadhaka needed only toobtain initiation into the Heart-mantra. This mantra,25which may be transcribed as S-AU-H, would lead him to be—  — — 26 \"born of the yogini\" (yoginijata). Abhinavaguptaclarifies that \"being born of the yogini\" means that thesadhaka obtains a descent of the energy (¿aktipata) whichtabides in the Heart united with Siva, and which will open his vision to the Self. This is the powerfully liberating force variously known as the kauliki feakti, the power that"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"12rules the embodied cosmos, visarga, the emissional power,t 27or simply Devi, Goddess.In the brief compass of this essay I want to explore a puzzling feature of the teachings presented inthe PTlv. There appears to be a discrepancy betweenIAbhinavagupta's formulations about the Sambhavopaya and other statements he makes about the efficacy and importance of ritual. The streamlined path to liberation presented by Abhinavagupta in the PTlv claims to dispense entirely with the need for ritual. In order to understand the theoretical framework within which the claims that Abhinavagupta makes in the PTlv become meaningful, I willIfirst examine the notion of the Heart of Siva in moredetail. The central concept of visarga will then beconsidered. Following this, the complex of ideas surrounding the notions of experiential replication will be analyzed. We will then have sufficiently delineated the conceptual framework necessary to understand the claims made by Abhinavagupta in the the PTlv about the relationship between ritual and meditation."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"13II. THE HEART OF SIVAThe Heart is the Ultimate (anuttara) which is both utterly transcendent to (viSvottirna) and yet totally immanent in (viSvamaya) all created things. It is the ultimate essence (slra). Thus, the Heart embodies theIparadoxical nature of Siva and is therefore a place ofastonishment (camatkara), sheer wonder (vismaya), andineffable mystery. The Heart is the fullness and1 _unboundedness of Siva (purnatva), the plenum of being that overflows continuously into manifestation. At the same time, it is also an inconceivable emptiness (¿unyltifeunya).^ The Heart is the unbounded and universal Self (purnahanta).1The Heart of Siva is not a static or inert absolute however. In fact, the Kashmir Shaiva tradition considersit to be in a state of perpetual movement, a state of2vibration (spanda) in which it is continuously contracting and expanding (samkoca-vikasa), opening and closing (unmesa-nimesa), trembling (ullasita) , quivering (sphurita), throbbing, waving, and sparkling (ucchalata). The intensity and speed of this movement is such that paradoxically it is simultaneously a perfect dynamic stillness.^The tradition states that the Heart is the enormous"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"14ocean (ambunidhi), the ocean of light, the ocean ofconsciousness. The waters of consciousness which in manare broken by countless polarizing (vikalpa) and divisivewaves (urrni) may be easily brought to a state of dynamicstillness by the process of immersion or absorption4(samaveèa) in the Heart.The perpetual effervescence, ebullition, andIincandescence at the center (madhya) of Siva's being provides the motor, as it were, that drives the entire process of manifestation;^ or, as Abhinavagupta terms it, of emission (visarga), of the entire universe. Equally important, through the medium of the empowered mantra the power (¿akti) that resides in the Heart, provides thefpossibility of a return to Siva, which is to say, the possibility of enlightenment. Thus, this power in the Heart, which is the Goddess, is at once centrifugal (pravrtti), that is, emissional and expansive, as well asgcentripetal (nivrtti), that is, absorptive and unitive. This centripetal motion of the Goddess resides in man as the kundalinl energy that impels one back to the source and center of one's being in a completely natural and spontaneous (sahaja) way.Abhinavagupta identifies the Goddess in the Heart with the Supreme Word (para-vik), the transcendent"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"15sounding of the motor of being, the primordial roar (nada)7of the fiery waters. This Supreme Word, while ultimatelybeyond any of the combinations of human speech, may betranscribed on the gross level by one of several mantra-s:OM, AHAM, SAUH. These and other mantra-s, when properlyempowered (mantravlrya) by the awakened life-force — 8(prana) and the consciousness of the guru, and properly employed by the receptive disciple, engage the centripetal motion of the Heart. The fragmented and restless mind is thus calmed, awakened, and intensified by the mantra which, tending automatically to move to its own source,9discovers the fullness and unboundedness of the Heart.There the disciple will hear the Supreme Word as theunstruck (anahata) sound of the Heart which is the10universal life force or cosmic breath (prana).The mysterious triad of sun (surya), moon (soma), and fire (agni) are said to abide in the Heart in a state of perfect equilibrium.^ On one level, these represent the interior cosmos of the process of knowing, the object of knowledge, and the knowing subject. However, a more complex homology is at work here. Just as the moon waxesIand wanes, so the Heart of Siva, the Goddess as moon,expands and contracts through the fifteen days (tithi) of12the lunar fortnight. Continuing the linguistic"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"16ananlogy, each day or station is assigned one of thevowels of the Sanskrit alphabet.“^ The sixteenth vowel--visarga— , emissional aspiration— H, is said to inheregenerically in the preceding fifteen. Because of the double meaning of the word soma as moon and as the ambrosial nectar, this sixteenth vowel links the emissionI Iof the union of Siva and Sakti with the water ofimmortality which slowly drips and trickles form the moon, 14from the Heart.This spring of nectar streams in the Heart which isthe secret cave (guha), the endless abyss or chasm, themysterious opening (yoni) in the body of the Goddess which gives birth to the entire universe.^ This creative matrix or void is also, by a double meaning of the word kha: cavity, hollow; space, air; the sky (cidambara), theether (akl&a) of consciousness. Thus, the highest spiritual attainment possible to man is termed khecari,that is, moving freely in the sky of consciousness.^What is the meaning of the assertion that the lingais the very Heart of the yoginl, the yoginlhrdaya? Thisrather mysterious statement links the most common emblemI _of Siva, the linga or phallic mark, with the Heart. It refers to the union of the 1inga, the phallic pillar oflight, with the guha, the vaginal abyss of darkness, a"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"17union which occurs in the Heart.The notion of the linga in the Heart may be read in at least three ways. On the cosmic level, the linga isIthe massed and powerful consciousness of Siva as he is17about to release the universe into manifestation. WeIrecognize here the emissional power of Siva which, continuously expanding and contracting, releases into being the seed-cognitions it harbors within itself. On another level, that of the yogic practice, the 1inga in the Heart alludes to the practice of meditative absorption into the cave (guha). Thus, we might initially read this process as guha-samâveèa— absorption into the cave, where that phrase yields a dual meaning. On the inner level of tantric practice, it may be interpreted as alluding to the yogic immersion in the cave of consciousness. On the external level of tantric ritual, it may be seen as describing the ritualistic penetration of the phallus into the vaginal cave. This superimposition of meanings, it need hardly be said, is not accidental. Thus the yoginl,«  Vthe Goddess, is penetrated by Siva, has Siva as her veryIHeart, has Siva in her very core. Bhairava is the self ofthe Goddess, he is inseparable from her, he is perpetually18united to her. Just as the Heart is said to harbor in its depths the unstruck sound, so the linga proclaims the"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"18withheld and unemitted semen of Siva, of the yogin, thetransmuted semen that permits the activation of the theGoddess in the form of the kundalinl, and the emission of• •19the soma within the Heart.The mutual sexual knowledge of the God and Goddessin the Heart is productive, on the human level, ofspiritual knowledge. A common theme which introduces manytantric works is the plea for knowledge made by the Devi 1to Siva. The God, after cautioning the Goddess not toreveal the secret teaching he is about to impart to anybut the most worthy disciples, proceeds to explain histrue nature to the Goddess. In addition, he reveals the20method or means to be used to attain Him. It is not surprising that the Heart, which is the abode and source of all, is lauded as the source of this transcendentalIwisdom as well. Siva as the great Yogin stands in theHeart as the supreme teacher. Abhinavagupta often extolsMaheivara in the Heart as the teacher from whom he learnedthe particular yogic and tantric methods which he explains 21in his texts. In this same vein, the authonative andrevealed scriptures, the agama-s are said to be the mere22throbbing of the Heart.Another important theme associates the Heart and the lotus flower (padma, ambhoja). Bhairava is said to"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"19reside in the lotus of the Heart in the form of bliss and consciousness, while the sense-goddesses (indriya-devi-s) perpetually worship him by offering up the enjoyments ofthe sense objects. The Heart-lotus is said to have eightpetals each facing one of the cardinal points of the compass. Important evidence that the Heart as it is here conceived does not refer to the fourth or anahata cakra of the esoteric yogic physiology is the fact that this latter cakra is usually described as having twelve petals. Interestingly, the names of the sense-goddesses bear a curious resemblance to traditional lists of the SevenMothers (sapta-matrka-s). However, Abhinavagupta has hereexpanded the list from seven to eight: Brahmani, E;* — — — ______ _Sambhavi, SE; Kumari, S; Vaisnavl, SW; Varahi, W; Indrani,• • •NW; Camunda, N; MahalaksmI, NE. We know that the numberIeight is doubly sacred to Siva as it enumaerates the eightIfaces of Siva (asta murti), and is also the sume of fiveand three, both of which numbers have many associations to' 23Siva and Shaivism.The number three brings us to the last and perhapsmost important theme associated with the Heart, the Heart24 . .as triangle (trikona). This initially puzzlingassociation links one of the names for the tradition,Trika or triple, with its most important symbol, the"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"20Heart. In fact, one of the important texts quoted by-  25Abhinavagupta in his TA is entitled the Trika-hrdaya.There is a deeper meaning lurking here, however. We havealluded to the identification of the Heart with the caveor abyss (guha). We have also seen the link made betweenthe cave, the Heart, and the female sexual organ. It1 _ _ _happens that in the Sarada script, in which almost all of the manuscripts of Kashmir were written, the vowel \"E\"looks very much like an isoceles triangle with its apex2 6pointing downwards. This emblematic association withthe female sexual organ causes the vowel \"E\" to becomeknown as the trikona-bija triangle-vowel, or yoni-bijavagina-vowel. The Heart, the triangle, the yoni, and thevowel \"E\", are all linked with the Goddess, with the¿akti, with the female power of sexuality, fertility, and 27reproduction."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"21III. THE GODDESS IN THE HEART: VISARGAIn this section I would like to examine a single,though crucial, aspect of this Kaula method: the conceptof visarga,^ which is most commonly encountered inSanskrit phonology as naming the pure, voiceless 2aspiration. The notion of the visarga is deeplyconnected with the theoretical bases of the Shaiva Tantra.Abhinavagupta devotes a large portion of the PTlv to anextended discourse on the nature of visarga. Thefollowing are two crucial passages from that textdetailing the nature of the visarga.The power (¿akti) which resides in the Heart ofconsciousness is freedom itself. The purpose of itscreative activity is the embodied cosmos (kula), theentire range of perceiving subject, perceived object,and process of perception. Thus She is called Kaulini.She is the Noble Lady, the Mistress (Nayika) of thatEmbodied Cosmos, She rules over it. By knowing it,She causes its manifestation, as well as reabsorbing it 3in Herself.Now, it is well known that perception here is just the illumination of the objective world, which, by nature, is divided up into two groups, namely the knowing subjects and the knowable objects. The knowing subject"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"22has as its essence the supremely subtle vibration of the Self. It is characterized by knowledge and action, and its nature is one of contraction and expansion, that is, opening and closing. It is not like a pot, and so on, which is inert, limited and stationary. The more this combination of expansion and contraction becomes evident in the vibration of the Heart, of the triangle etc., the more does the subjectivity become elevated, until it reaches the consciousness of Bhairava. Conversely, the more the expansion and contraction diminish, the more does the subjectivity fall until it becomes inert like a stone etc. This expansion and contraction is the characteristic of the visarga, whose essence is freedom, that is, the very Power of the Lord, of the Ultimate (anuttara). Therefore, the phoneme \"H\", the visarga, is termed the Rudra-yamala, the Rudra-Dyad, because it consists ofIboth the Supreme Siva and ¿akti, of the rest andactivity which constitute the union of Bhairava with 4his Beloved.In Abhinavagupta's teachings about the Kaula method, the term visarga has a wide signification. Here, it comes to name that power (¿akti) (known alternatively as the kauliki^akti, the Devi, the nada) which is"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"23responsible for emitting the universe in all its glorious variety. Equally important, it names the power which must be harnessed by the tantric yogin to continue the arc of manifestation as it doubles back on the journey ofIreturn to Siva. This power may be thought of as an impelling force (iccha-èakti), that at one and the same time continuously pushes everything out into being, andIcontinuously absorbs it all back into Siva. Thus, this power in the Heart, which is the Goddess, and which isnamed the visarga, is at once centrifugal (pravrtti), that is, emissional and expansive, as well as centripetal (nivrtti), that is, absorptive and unitive.^This expansion and contraction (samkoca-vikasa) forms a kind of \"alternating current\" of spiritual power which may be tapped by the yogin in various ways. The\"expansive\" mode may be employed for the furthermanifestation of desires in the external or subtle worlds(bhoga, phala), or, during the farther reaches of the sadhana, for the establishment of the experience of non­duality even in outward perceptions. The \"contractive\" mode connects the yogin to the inwardly ascending force that effortlessly propels the yogin to rest in absorption (samaveèa-vièranti) in his own unbounded, original consciousness. Here, the infinitely fast vibration"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"24(spanda) of consciousness allows the re-emergence of the state of Bhairava, the state of liberation in this very life. In the dialectic of reversal characteristic of the visarqa the \"expansive\" mode mentioned above may, fromanother perspective, be termed \"contractive\" and vice-versa .Abhinavagupta calls the visarga the Rudra-dyad. On one level, the double nature of the visarga clearlyI _ _reflects its graphic representation in the Sarada script: two dots placed vertically one above the other, sometimes accompanied by a straight vertical line just to the left of the two dots. The single dot, bindu, which is the phoneme that just precedes the visarga in the enumeration of the vowels, is said to represent the finite, knowing subject (vedaka).^ The visarga, which is made up of twobindu-s, represents the inherently self-referential capacity of consciousness.^ It is in this sense that the visarga represents the freedom of consciousness, thevimar£a, which is the most important characteristic of consciousness. Consciousness is not like a rock crystal which passively reflects all that appears before it. Rather, the freedom and spontaneity present in consciousness, allow for a continuous process of self- consciousness (svasamvedana) as well. The vi sarga"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"25represents the basic component of the sadhana in which the finite consciousness is doubled back on itself. At first, as this process proceeds, consciousness simply encounters more and more of its own contents. Finally, there occurs the powerful moment of recognition (pratyabhijna), when the beam of consciousness becomes conscious of itself and nothing else. This is termed the entrance into the\"Fourth\", turlya, and here the condition of simple nirvikalpa ensues.The visarga, which is tentatively translated as the \"emissional power,\" brings together all the variouslevels of the tantric cosmos: the divine level of outwardcosmic manifestation, the human level of inward spiritualabsorption, and the ritual level on which the humanbecomes divine. In terms of language, the visargafunctions both as a phoneme, the outwardly explosiveaspiration of breath, and as a component of numerous mantra-s, where its function is rather to cause the inward cessation of the vital breath. On the level of ritual,it resonates with the kula-yaga, the secret ritual taught in veiled terms by Abhinavagupta, where it may signify the orgasmic expulsion of the life force; or, on the level of inner, tantric yoga which is part of the same ritual, it coincides with the blissful inward force, the kundalini."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"26In each of these environments, the polar, dyadic nature of the visarga is clearly at work.The sophistication of the tantric treatises, especially the tantric works of Abhinavagupta, is such that they exhibit a great deal of self-consciousness about the nature of language and the use of language as a religious tool. On the technical level, the most potent tantric instrument for liberation is a small unit of language, a mantra♦ As we have seen, the specific mantra taught by Abhinavagupta in the PTlv is SAUH, and it contains the visarga as its final and perhaps most potentgelement. Abhinavagupta explains the mechanism by whichthe mantra accomplishes the task of enlightenment in thefollowing way. The individual soul (anu), is caughtmidway between the total inertia of a rock and theomniscience of Bhairava. According to the PTlv, the foursheaths or kancuka-s are the forces that suspend the anu9in the middle, like the mythological character Triianku. The PTlv states:The Heart is the seed of the Universe devoid ofbeginning and end, devoid of coming into being anddestruction; and because it is a seed, it expands into the form of All, it moves incessantly to expansion.This Heart which moves in the midst of the Lunar"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"27Stations made up of time— of the All— is present ineverything in the form of an undifferentiated self-referential consciousness. He should continuallymeditate on this seed of the Heart as having penetratedinto his own Heart, into his consciousness, which is inthe form of a lotus flower because it plays atexpanding and contracting; he should meditate on thisseed which having entered into his consciousness causesit to expand by bringing abut the removal of the formof contraction. In this way there occurs the10attainment of Bhairava in all its fullness.This continuous movement of expansion present in the very core of reality is the visarga. Naturally, the expansion is accompanied by a counterbalancing movement of contraction. The visarga is always conceived in polar, rhythmic terms. This dual nature accounts for its being termed the Rudra-dyad, (the Rudra-yamala). The PTlv continues:The initiated one knows this supreme knowledge whose characteristic is the Heart, and which is given by the divinities of Bhairava, who are within the Heart, and who bring an escape from the vibration of manifestation which leads to the obscuring of the Self, and are rather directed towards the supreme vibration which"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"28consists of an opening up of the Self. These samedivinities destroy the chief bond which is the state ofcontraction.^The vibration that leads to manifestation, is, interms of consciousness, the contractive aspect of thevisarga, and the supreme vibration that discloses the selfis the expansive aspect of the visarga. Abhinavaguptatells us that the purpose of the mantra is to cause12consciousness to vibrate more quickly. Thus, in terms of the mantra, the process involves harnessing the very power that resides in consciousness, and allowing the finite mind to vibrate more quickly, to expand, and to reach the infinitely fast vibration that characterizes the state of Bhairava. The attainment of this state issynonymous with the condition of jivanmukta. It is in this way that Abhinavagupta explains the theoreticalI _  _ _underpinnings of the Sambhavopaya. The method thatI I I _relates to Siva or to Sambhu (Sambhava), employs nothing else but the visarga, which can here be understood as an impulse or power within the Heart. This power begins to operate to lead the sadhaka towards the Ultimate once consciousness has been successfully doubled back uponitself. Once the sadhaka has reached this stage, he hasbecome a vira, a spiritual hero, who is able to unite with"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"29the Goddess. He is one who is able to surrendergracefully, completely, and effortlessly to thatcentripetal motion of the Heart, the gravitational pull ofconsciousness on itself, which plunges him back into thedepths of the ocean of consciousness. The vira may, atthis point, if he so desires, consolidate this unificationwith the inner Goddess in the context of the secret ritual_ <3known as the kula-yaga."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"30IV. HRDAYANGAMIBHUTA: EXPERIENTIAL REPLICATIONWe now turn to a single passage of the PTlv which addresses the concept of \"experiential replication.\" This passage occurs in the comment to the first two verses of the agamic \"base-text.\" In these first two verses the Goddess implores Bhairava to reveal to her the great secret of the power that abides in the Heart. In his commentary Abhinavagupta first presents the view of the purvapaksin who questions the necessity for any kind of revelation. The objector bases his argument on the ground that if it is agreed that the Self is already shining in the Heart of all beings, then there is no need for Bhairava to reveal it. Abhinavagupta responds to this objection by saying:True, but even though it shines there, it has not truly become a conscious apprehension. Without conscious apprehension, even if a thing exists, it is as if it did not exist, just like the leaves and grass and other things when riding in a chariot. The question is thus appropriate because contentment is not possible without a conscious realization. Contentment (trpti) is of two kinds. The first is effected by means of absorption (samaveia) and consists of magical powers. The second is attained by reaching a condition of"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"31conscious heart-felt realization, and it is the state of being liberated while still alive.'*'The operative phrase in this passage is \"conscious apprehension\" or \"conscious realization\" which translates the Sanskrit hrdayangamibhuta. This compound literally means \"has become something that moves in the Heart.\" It has also been rendered as \"a condition of conscious heart­felt realization.\" The argument that Abhinavagupta puts forward seems to be that even if we agree that in their innermost recesses all beings are essentially constitutedIby, and identical with, Siva, there remains a crucial difference between unconsciously being something and consciously taking possession of one's true status. In the one case, the finite self, ignorant of its identityIwith Siva, suffers bondage and limitation. In the other case, conscious realization of the true status of theperceiver (grihaka) generates a transformative andempowering effect.By using the term hrdayangamibhuta Abhinavagupta underscores certain important characteristics of the Kaula notions about liberation. The Kaula moksa operates afundamental transformation of the experience of thesâdhaka, that is to say there is a primacy of theexperiential dimension. However, the attainment of moksa"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"32as an epistemological rather than ontological event, and once it is attained it represents an active rather than a passive condition. In terms of the finite self, the liberation aimed at by the Kaulas represents a process of expansion rather than a process of contraction. Finally, in terms of the finite world, the Kaula moksa operates an integrative and transformative effect rather than a separative and destructive one.We will consider these statements one by one. It is important to emphasize that the \"conscious realization\" referred to is not simply a process of assenting intellectually to or affirming belief in a religious doctrine. No doubt, comprehension and faith may constitute important first steps in the process of gaining liberation. Nevertheless, it should be clear that to \"become something that moves in the Heart\" cannot be reduced to \"having an idea in the mind.\"The process of recognition of one's identity withI _Siva (pratyabhijfia) is simply the experiential awakening to a pre-existing condition. Consequently, from an ontological perspective, when freedom is gained nothing has really changed. What has always been continues to be. Yet, epistemologically, the awakening to a conscious realization of the true situation is powerfully"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"33liberating. Everything changes. Indeed, it is as a result of this heart-felt realization that the state of j ivanmukti is said to arise. It should be noted thatperhaps these philosophical categories imported fromIWestern thought are subtly distortive here. Siva's being (prakaSa) is essentially constituted of a consciousness that is continuously self-referential (vimarSa). Thus, while it remains true that awakening to enlightenment is essentially an experiential, epistemological event, whichI Idoes not in any way alter Siva's being qua Siva, it is equally true that this event is powerfully transformative of the \"being\" of the sadhaka. The siddha \"is\" no longer the same, and this new status will reflect itself not only in terms of a transformed vision of the self and of the phenomenal universe, but also in the attainment of a divinized condition of physical embodiment.The power which moves in the Heart is the visarga- ¿akti— the emissional power, the spanda— vibration. The process of conscious realization involves the awakening to and grasping of this innate power of the Ultimate. It is this power which increasingly overwhelms the finite selfI  1with the infinity of Siva. The process of attaining Siva may rightly be described as passive in the sense that it involves, according to the Kaula method of the"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"34Sambhavopaya/ a progressively and increasingly effortless immersion (nimajjana), or reposing (viSranti) in the abyssof the Heart, a term functionally equivalent with the'  2immanent Siva-who-is-consciousness. When the experienceof realization matures sufficiently the sadhaka mayIrightly utter the startling assertion, \"I am Siva\"1(S ivo1 ham). However, this assertion claims for theawakened siddha not just an intrinsic and passive1\"oneness\" with the essence of Siva, but an activeattainment of the five functions or powers (pancakrtya)1 3of Siva as well. This active appropriation of theIcondition of Siva is alluded to in the above quoted passage Abhinavagupta merely alludes to it when he describes the condition obtained as a result of the transmission of knowledge as a state of contentment (trpti) which is said to be of two kinds. The first occurs as a result of absorption (samaveia) and results in the attainment of magical powers (vibhuti). The second kind of contentment is brought about by the achievement of the condition of conscious heart-felt realization and results in the attainment of life-in-freedom.The attainment of the Heart corresponds to theIattainment of the liberating power of Siva which grants freedom and unveils the ultimate reality. The first"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"35moment of this realization occurs in an implosive enstaticIrecognition of an inner identity with Siva. Abhinavaguptadescribes the astounding unity-in-difference that4characterizes life-in-freedom. The finite self attainsliberation and experiences itself as indissolubly unitedwith the totality. The individual self expands toexperience itself as the perfectly fulfilled egoity(purnahanta), and in so doing comes to the experience ofastonishment (camatkara) inherent in this amazing\"transformation\" into the universal self. Abhinavaguptaoften plays with the opposition between expansion andcontraction (samkoca-vikasa). The \"expansion\" that leadsto the manifestation of the world occurs as a result of1the \"contraction\" of Siva into finiteness, into the finite selves (anu). The meditatively achieved \"expansion\" of the finite self results in the \"contraction\" of the finiteworld's \"expansion\", and the de-contraction of the finite' . 5self back into Siva.Thus, \"to move in the Heart\" refers, to begin with,to an inner grasping of the ¿akti which opens the sadhakaIto identity with Siva. By uniting with the Goddess, thesadhaka is said to be \"born of the Yoginl's Heart\", that1 6is, to be reborn as Siva. For the Kaula lineage thisrefers to the attainment of certain macranthropic"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"36experiences. The sadhaka truly comes to embody thecosmos. The capacity to experience finite objects is notlost; instead, objects are now seen as \"luminous with theplay that bestows the fragrance of the Self.\"^ Theastonishment of the experience involves not just the1discovery that Siva, the universal Self, is the true inner identity, but also the bewildering perception that this non-differentiated Self is simultaneously lightly at play as a luminosity inherent in all external objects. In this way, the jlvanmukta \"moves in the Heart\", in the sense that he now experiences the fact that he has his life and being within the omnipresent reality of the Heart, ofI   ISiva. He comes to realize that he is surrounded by Siva on all sides, and that what he formerly \"perceived\" as separate, finite objects have now revealed their truefstatus as simply Siva himself. This is one of themeanings of the tantric formulation, present in the PTlv, which integrates the usually opposed concepts of\"enjoyment\" and liberation (bhukti-mukti). The highest meaning of \"enjoyment\" is in fact the living of theblissful state of liberation itself. Thus we may contrast the Kaula moksa to the separative kaivalya of the Samkhya and Yoga systems, or what may be characterized as the \"destructive\" end of maya in the moksa of Advaitic"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"37formulations. In distinct contrast to moksa-s whichoperate an isolative, absorptive, sublative, or perhapseven destructive effect on samsara, the Kaula moksa• •transforms the finite world just as it integrates it toithe reality of Siva.There is a final sense to the notion of moving in the Heart. It is in order to underscore this particular connotation that the rendering \"experiential replication\" was chosen. The notion of \"replication\" refers to a crucial aspect of the relationship between the Kaula guru and the sadhaka. Essentially, there occurs a \"movement\" within the Ultimate as the experience of enlightenment displaces the condition of ignorance. According to the Kaula tradition the awakening from ignorance to enlightenment may be seen both as a movement in the Heart occuring within an individual, but also as a movement ofQreality from the Kaula guru to the disciple. TheI  Iabsolute reality of Siva spreads out, as it were. Siva,Iwho has come to apprehend himself as Siva within theexperiential framework of the life of the guru, replicatesHimself in the experience of the disciple. For the Kaulatradition, this continuous flux of enlightenment from thecenter to the periphery is known as the descent of the . _ 9¿akti (saktipata). It is this ¿akti, the Goddess, who is"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"38said to be continuously established and moving in the Heart. Thus, by the unceasing movement of reality within itself, finite beings first ignorantly apprehend themselves as finite, and then come to know themselves as infinite. In this fashion the experience ofIenlightenment, of Siva, replicates itself unceasingly as a function of the activity of the Goddess."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"39V. BORN OF THE YOGINI'S HEART; MEDITATION AND RITUALThe method outlined by Abhinavagupta in the PTlvemphasizes the primacy of the direct experience of theHeart through the mantra. Meditation on the mantra willbring the practitioner to a state of direct knowledge ofthe ultimate reality'*', as well as bringing him thecapacity to have detailed knowledge of all finite things,2past and future. The direct, meditative absorption in3the Heart is said to fulfill the purpose of any ritual. Indeed, the entrance into the Heart constitutes initiation, even if the actual ritual of initiation has4not been performed. Moreover, as a result of the directknowledge of the ultimate reality of the Heart, thepractitioner gains essential knowledge about all rituals,even if he does not know the specific rules for the5various rituals. Most importantly, all of the ritualssurrounding the entrusting and transmission of the mantragare said to be \"of no use whatsoever\". The practitioner who has been \"born of the yoginl\" automatically becomes an expert in the rituals of all schools, not necessarily because he has come to know the ritual regulations of each of the schools in detail, but rather because he comes to know the so-called \"Method of the Ultimate\" (anuttara-7vidhi). Says Abhinavagupta, \"with respect to the"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"40Ultimate, which is only consciousness, all other thingsgare extraneous.\"It is in the light of these rather strong statements in favor of the primacy of direct meditative knowledge of the Heart that it becomes urgent to attempt a conceptual reconciliation of the relationship between meditation and ritual as conceived by Abhinavagupta.I _Despite the teaching of the Sambhavopaya, a great varietyof rituals continue to be practiced. We may properly askourselves why it is that many of Abhinavagupta1s othertexts, especially the Tantraloka, are full of descriptions9of elaborate tantnc rituals. Even more puzzling is the fact that in the PTlv itself an entire section of the commentary is devoted to a description of various ritualprocedures (vidhi), including sacrifice (yaga, yajana),-. 10 adoration (puja), and oblation (homa). How are we tounderstand the inclusion of this description of ritual ina text devoted almost exclusively to meditation practices,especially when the claim is made that these meditationpractices surpass and obviate all ritual? To put thematter in more general terms, what light can this textshed on the relationship between the \"inner\" practices ofthe tantra and the \"outer\" practices?The method I will follow in this last section will"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"41be to present three approaches to the interaction between ritual procedures and meditative absorption. It is hoped that by means of these approaches the apparent discrepancy outlined above will come to be understood in terms of Abhinavagupta's intricate interweaving of these two dimensions of religious practice. In a sense, as we will see meditation and ritual are finally not to be distinguished. They represent two differentiable but finally indivisible aspects of the same tantric sadhana. I now proceed to present these three approaches as possible avenues for further exploration.1) Ritual as preparation for meditative absorption;In a longer commentary on the same agamic verses explained in the PTlv, Abhinavagupta states that the ritual of adoration (puja, puja-vidhi) prepares those who have not yet received the full and total descent of energy (¿aktiplta) to use the mantra successfully.^ Due to the \"peculiar efficacy\" (mahatmya) of this particular ritual, says Abhinavagupta, the sadhaka is able to practice fully the technique of \"remembering\" the mantra, and in this way attains the condition of the Heart, the ultimate reality. Thus, in this context, ritual functions to facilitate meditative absorption (samaveSa, viferanti, nimllana samadhi). It is this"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"42absorption which then discloses the inner dimension of the Heart in its fullness. In addition, absorption brings the practitioner into contact with the emissional power of consciousness (visarga), the primary force which guides the unfolding tantric sâdhana.2) Meditative absorption as preparation for ritual:The agamic \"base-text\" commented upon by Abhinavagupta inthe PTlv describes a ritual of \"imposition\" (nyasa),giving a few details as follows: One makes \"imposition\"on various parts of the body: head, face, heart, genitals,and whatever image is to be adored. One then mutters themantra twenty-seven times, simultaneously binding up thetop-knot. The ten regions of space are then bound up,beginning by making three loud hand-claps to removeobstacles. Sanctified water is then sprinkled over thetop-knot, the flowers and other ritual implements, thelinga, and the entire sacrificial surface. In hiscomment on this, passage Abhinavagupta concentrates almost12exclusively on the notion of appropriation (svlkarana). For him, the significance of the ritual is that it involves a process of reducing the external constituents of the ritual to a state of identity with the ultimate reality of the Heart. The successful performance of the ritual of imposition is the prerequisite for the true"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"43practice of the ritual of adoration. In order to perform the process of appropriation central to the rite of imposition (as opposed to merely simulating it, or imagining it), the tantric \"hero\" (vlra) must have already received the ¿aktipata that \"decontracts\" his consciousness. Only when the contraction of the finite self (anu) has ceased is the vlra fully qualified to perform, in its truest sense, the ritual of imposition which prepares the necessary preconditions that permit the true practice of adoration.Thus, the rituals of imposition and adoration serve the vlra as a stage upon which to extend his inner visionIof the unity of all things within Siva-who-is-consciousness. It is precisely by \"appropriating\" allthings to the Heart that the vision of inner unity isextended outwards. In these rituals the vlra finds anarena for solidifying the unitive vision acquired duringmeditative absorption. The rituals serve to extend andexpand this inner vision of unity to include all theexternal constituents of the ritual. They serve as acontext within which the vira will eventually attain theadvanced form of meditative realization known as the13extrovertive samadhi (unmilana samadhi).3)The Convergence of ritual and meditation:"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"44In the first case considered above, ritual \"opens thedoor\" of meditative absorption. In the second case, arather advanced degree of meditative realization isnecessary for the true performance of the ritual. In thissecond case rituals have been transformed from merely\"external\" performances into extensions and continuationsof the state of meditative realization itself. As aresult, in the tantric sadhana described by Abhinavagupta,the relationship of meditation and ritual seems to be oneof almost complete interdependence. It might almost bedescribed as being symbiotic in nature. The trueperformance of one requires a high degree of proficiencyin the other. The successful practice of one deepens andenhances the performance of the other. Synergistically\"feeding\" one upon the other, the two \"wings\" of externaland internal tantric practice advance the vira along thepath of sadhana. In so doing, ritual and meditation havea tendency to converge, to merge one with the other, untilthe boundary or distinction between these two categoriesblurs and fades. To present this process of convergencein detail would require more space than we have available.We may mention as an example, however, a ritual describedby Abhinavagupta in the Tantraloka for the empowerment of 14a new teacher. If our interpretation of this passage is"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"45correct, it seems that in this very important ritual,there do not occur any \"external\" actions on the part ofthe teacher or disciple whatsoever. Rather, ritual hashere become a context for \"sacred action\" in which thereality that has been intuitively apprehended in thesilence of meditative absorption is now silentlymanipulated in order to be transmitted to the disciple.Once again, the distinction between \"outer\" practices and\"inner\" attainments has become blurred. Nevertheless, theconvergence of ritual and meditation is quite inaccordance with the avowed aim of the tantric sadhanawhich is described as a condition in which all things are\"of one taste\" (ekarasa).^In the Tantraloka), Abhinavagupta describes ameditation using terms and images drawn from a fire-ritual;the two fire-sticks are rubbed together in order to16inflame the sacred fire-pit of Bhairava. This meditation essentially consists in visualizing the entire universereduced to the wheel of pure consciousness, and then,rehearsing the process by which the entire universe once again emerges. The siddha is said to have become identified with Bhairava when he actually comes to experience the continuous emanation and reabsorption of the universe from his consciousness. In order to achieve"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"46this condition of Bhairava the siddha employs ritualized meditations and meditative rituals which serve as arenas for manifesting his identification with Bhairava. These practices become the context within which the siddha exercises and tests his attainment of the powers of manifestation, maintenance, and reabsorption of the universe. As the mutually enhancing practices of meditation and ritual deepen, they provide a context for \"sacred action\" which tests the authenticity and intensity of religious attainment and which is both deeply meditative and highly ritualized in nature.The precise balance between meditation and ritual in Abhinavagupta descriptions of sadhana seems to depend on at least three factors:1) The particular method (upaya) that the sadhaka is employing: The method, in turn, will depend on theteacher's ascertainment of the degree of ¿aktipata that the sadhaka has received. Thus, only the most highly qualified disciples would be able to employ successfullyI _  _the Sambhavopaya described in the PTlv. For them, and them alone, the great majority of ritual practices seem to have become useless. Nevertheless, it is for these highly advanced disciples that the tradition teaches the eroticized secret ritual known as the kula-yaga. For"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"47other, less favored, practitioners, the rituals will serveto enhance and develop whatever meditative skills they may» 17have.2) The goal of the sadhaka: Sadhana may be undertaken for the attainment of moksa, for the attainment of particular desires (bhoga), or for a combination of the two. For those practitioners undertaking sadhana only for the attainment of moksa, the precision of the regulations established for the performance of ritual lose their importance. The only important element in this case is that every aspect of ritual be such that it causes joy in the Heart. Those who aim at the fruition of specific desires, on the other hand, must attend closely to the precise details for the performance of each specifici 18ritual.3) Is the sadhaka pursuing the attainment of the introvertive (nimilana) or the extrovertive (unmllana) samadhi?: The introvertive samadhi is attained by an emphasis on meditative absorption. The extrovertive samadhi is achieved by meditatively performed ritual. These samadhi-s are pursued precisely in order that the polarity between inner and outer be overcome. The alternation between a contraction of the manifested universe into the silent witnessing consciousness, and the"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"48expansion of that universe again out of consciousness, constitutes the essential structure of the tantric sadhana. Thus, it is in the dialectical relationship between meditation and ritual, in the repeated alternation between the inner and outer practices, that the sadhana advances towards its unifying goal."}]
