In his encyclopaedic work, the Tantraloka, 'Light on the Tantras', he describes the various tantras of his day and places at their apex the most extreme of them, the Kula ritual, which proposes the use of wine and meat and intercourse with women of the lowest castes. Is Abhinavagupta's esteem of the Kula ritual just the shadow side of genius, an aberration best forgotten? This work is a translation - the first into English of any chapter of the Tantraloka of Abhinava­gupta's version of the Kula ritual. It also provides a translation - the first into any language - of Jayaratha's indispensable commentary. It shows the structure of the text, which is not a confused mass of codes and activities but is articulated as finely as an Indian temple. The translation is accompanied by a commentary, the appendices, including glossary and index of words. The Kula ritual leads the practitioner to ever more exalted stages of the mantra finally to reach the highest level of consciousness, the experience of mantravyapti, the 'pervasion of the mantra'. The person who knows this pervasion knows that he is Bhairava. The supreme mantra of consciousness is none other than the mantra SAUH, the supreme goddess Para, which expresses both the supreme reality and all manifested reality. In this way Abhinava­gupta breaks down the dualism between sacred and profane, ritual and ordinary life so that the Kula practitioner is liberated while alive, his every act is worship and his every word is mantra."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"JOHN R.

Yet this chapter occupies an important position in a book which itself is the greatest work of the greatest thinker of his day for it was into the Kula ritual that Abhinavagupta was initiated by Sarnbhunatha and which he prized above almost all the rest. Abhinava states in TA 13.300cd-301ab: 'Sequentially and according to the descent of power, one is initiated in the Siddhdnta, then in the Left, in the Right, in the Mata, in the Kula, in the Kaula, then in the Trika which is in the Heart.' A first glance is bewildering. The mixture of images and themes and codes makes the text unreadable. A second glance scandalises. The use of wine and sexual fluids, the use of women and the disregard for conventions - what have they to do with the great Abhinavagupta? Are they perhaps an aberration, the shadow side of genius? Inescapably, however, we are forced to admit that Abhinava placed the Kula ritual almost at the summit of divine revelation. Only the Trika, i.e. the single mantra SAUH, stood higher. We are forced to attend more closely to the ritual. How does it, in fact, express the grandiose vision set out in the first half of the Tantraloka? Or again, how does the theory of the first five chapters work out in practice? This monograph will show that the Kula ritual, properly understood, is an exalted and simple way of life. It does involve wine etc. but not so as to create a dichotomy between body and spirit, enjoyment and liberation. The aim of the Kula ritual is to overcome the dualism of pure and impure, sacred and profane, divine and human, even good and evil. It wishes to show how ordinary life is the expression of consciousness, of Siva himself in union with his sakti."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"HOW TO READ THIS MONOGRAPH The focus of this monograph is not a theme such as the con­cept of the word fully studied in the work of Andre Padoux nor the theme of the heart studied in its various aspects by Paul Eduardo Muller-Ortega.1 They draw on a number of authors and texts to study a theme, whereas this work is directed above all to the text of TA 29 and its investigation alone. The chapters in Part I of this work aim only to lead the reader to appreciate the text more fully. They will help situate the text in its various settings - the life and work of Abhinavagupta, the currents of his day and his basic world view. The introductory chapters which are meant to accompany the text will explain certain words in more detail and provide some assistance regarding those texts where the density of language or wealth of imagery at first confuses the reader. The structure is of major impor­tance in showing the direction of the chapter and the inter­relationship of its sections. The notes and the appendices will further help to explain the mass of terms and codes in TA 29 and its investigation. In particular the glossary with its refer­ences to the text will help to explore the various meanings and usages of a word and so draw up a fuller presentation of a particular theme. By combining these various tools the reader will be able to analyse the text at greater depth. The text of the Tantraloka is written in couplets so that each sloka consists of two whole lines or four half-lines. Gnoli, in his translation of the Tantraloka indicates the first whole by the letter 'a' and the second whole line by the letter 'b' but this monograph sees a value, especially for the glossary, in referring to half-lines. Thus TA 29.1b refers to the second half-line of 1. Andre Padoux, Vac, The concept of word in selected Hindu tantras, Trans­lated by Jacques Gontier, Albany, State University of New York. Press, 1990.

Similarly, TA 29. lab refers to the first two half-lines of that sloka while led refers to the second two half-lines. The printed edition of the Tantraloka distinguishes clearly between the text of Abhinava, Jayaratha's own commentary and the quotations he gives. It does so by means of different sized type. That cannot elegantly be replicated in this work. Customarily the investigation, i.e. Jayaratha's comments and his quotations, are referred to by the abbreviation TAV, the volume, chapter, page and lines. For example: TAV 11 (29) 15/ 6-14. This style is satisfactory when the references are infre­quent but is cumbersome in a work which constantly refers to the investigation. Furthermore, it does not distinguish between a comment by Jayaratha and a quotation. Thus, for the sake of clarity and brevity, a different system has been introduced. For example, 'Jr.40b.l' refers to a comment by Jayaratha (Jr.) which occurs after the second half-line (b) of sloka 40. It is the first comment (1) he makes after that half-line. Qt.42d,2 refers to a quotation (Qt.) which occurs after the fourth half-line (d) of sloka 42. It is the second (2) quotation made after that half-line. The comments and quotations are sufficiently brief to make this system work for TA 29. The abbreviation 'viz.' indicates that what follows does not belong to the text but is added to make the text readable. For the sake of brevity I have translated into English the quotations taken from works written in other languages."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"PART I Prolegomena to the Tantraloka 29 and to Jayaratha's Investigation"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1 ABHINAVAGUPTA We are unusually well-informed about the life and background of Abhinavagupta. He himself provides the autobiographical details in places scattered throughout his work and especially at the con­clusion of the Tantraloka and the Paratrimsikavivarana.1 Pandey and others have set out these details clearly and there is no need to repeat them.2 Only those points of particular relevance to TA 29 are given here. Abhinava stems from an illustrious background for his distant ancestor, Atrigupta, a Brahman3 famous for his erudition and cul­ture, was invited by Lalitaditya, king of Kashmir, the 'World Con­queror',4 to leave the prestigious capital Kanauj which Lalitaditya had conquered. Atrigupta was provided with a great house in the capital, Pravarapura (modern Srinagar) near the temple of Sitamsumauli5 on the banks of the Jhelum.6 The opening hymn of the Tantraloka, repeated in the Tantrasara and found again at the start of the Paratrimsikavivarana, sings of the union of Siva and sakti from whose bliss the whole universe 1.

In their union he regarded them as Siva and sakti. From them, in their state of transcendent union he, Abhinava, has sprung. He is their yogini-child, the 'de­pository of knowledge', who 'even as a child in the womb ... has the form of Siva.'7 He was born about 960 C.E. and died about 1020 C.E.8 He is named Abhinavagupta. In giving the etymology of his name he perhaps reveals his own self-image. 'That wise man alone is suited to this sacrifice who is protected (gupto) on all sides ('bhi) by praise (nav).'9 Jayaratha glosses that seemingly banal etymology of the name and Silbum summarises his gloss as follows: 'Thatperson is 'Abhinavagupta' who remains vigilant in the course of every day activities; who is present ev­erywhere (abhi), in the objective domain as much as in the subjective domain, and dwells there without limita­tion. He sings the praise (nu) without ceasing to con­centrate on the energies of knowledge and activity. He is protected (gupta) by this praise even though he lives under the pressure of temporal affairs. '10 Jayaratha's interpretation is reflected in Qt.l00b.4 which is a description of the practitioner of Sacrifice 3. Vimala, Abhinava's mother, dies when he is two years old and his father rears him. He also has a brother Manoratha and a sister Amba.11 Abhinava describes his father, Narasimhagupta, as 'out­standingly adorned with devotion to Mahesvara'.12 He goes on to note that he himself, following his father, was 'spontaneously seized 7.

Abhinava acclaims his father as his first teacher. Narasirnhagupta introduced the young boy to Sanskrit grammar.14 Afterwards he was introduced to all the intellectual currents of his day. He him­self notes that 'out of curiosity', he '...frequented the logicians, the followers of the Veda (srauta), the Buddhists, the Jains, the Vaisnavas, etc.' 15 and he explains the purpose of his curiosity was \"... to fill out [his] consciousness'.16 In TA 37.62, he lists a host of other teach­ers.17 This does not mean that he travelled widely outside of Kash­mir18 since the vale was itself experiencing a Golden Age of intel­lectual ferment. In TA 36, Abhinava portrays the vast sweep of traditions which descend from Bhairava. Srikantha, i.e. Siva, is the guru of the three Perfected Beings, Amardaka, Srinatha and Tryambaka. At Srikantha's command, these promulgate the dualist, dualist-non-dualist and the non-dualist Saiva traditions respectively. Further­more, Tryambaka himself has two children, a son and a daughter who is called Half-Tryambaka or Ardhatryambaka so that there are, in fact, 'three and a half streams of tradition' (adhyusta-samtatisrotah)}9 The lineage of the daughter is called the 'three-and-a-half tradition (adhyusta-pitha)20 and is identified with the 13.

Her tradition forms the subject matter of Tantraloka 29. Those schools attracted his particular interest. In TA 37.60-61, he speaks of his education in them. Vamanatha, 'son' of Erakavara, taught him the dualist tradition; the 'son' of Bhutiraja taught him the dualist-non-dualist tradition; Laksmanagupta, 'son' of Utpala who himself was the 'son' of Somananda, taught him the non-du­alist tradition which goes back to Tryambaka. Finally, Sambhu-natha, 'son' of Somadeva, taught him the fourth or the 'three-and-a-half tradition.21 The vast Tantraloka begins with the customary acknowledg­ment of the divine origins, the Perfect origins and the human ori­gins from which the work derives. In the encomium of the human origins, TA 1.7-21, Sambhunatha receives the most frequent and complete mention. Again, at the end of the vast work, he is men­tioned as the high point in the series of his gurus: 'The omniscient Sambhunatha, 'son' of Somadeva, like the full moon over the sea, expounded [for him] the so-called 'Fourth Tradition'.22 Sambhunatha and Abhinava must have met though it is not clear where they did so.23 Did the master travel all the way to Kashmir24 or, rather, did the disciple make the journey?25 In Jr.29b. l, Jayaratha identifies the sacred site mentioned in TA 29.28b with Jalandhara and says that this is the place '...from which the doctrine [of the Kula tradition] was propagated by the lineage of the [eternal] Perfected Beings and the [eternal] yoginis'. And so he gives the slight weight of evidence in favour of Abhinava making the journey to Jalandhara. 21. It is worth noting that Sambhunatha's own guru, Suraati, originated from South India.

It was at Sambhunatha's command,27 as well as at the request of his students and colleagues, TA 1.15, that Abhinava composed the Tantraloka. Abhinava did not marry. He states concerning himself that: '..he was a celibate throughout his life and as such the question of having wife or son etc. never did arise. '28 We cannot, however, conclude that he did not have direct experi­ence of all the Kula rituals. In fact, in the concluding line, TA 29.292ab, he refers to the authority of his own experience and seems to scotch the accusation that he knows the rituals only at second hand. Abhinava lived out his life as a writer and teacher. Although he was a Brahman like his ancestor Atrigupta, there is no evidence in TA 29 that he exercised a function at any temple. Rather, the con-text of TA 29 is the house, the 'hall of sacrifice',29 or the gathering of Kula practitioners, i.e. the circle-sacrifice,30 the gathering of heroes surrounding the guru who is the 'Chief of Heroes'.31 26.

By so doing he places it in a precise historical context. No attempt is made here to give a full picture of that historical context.1 The following pages only trace the trajectory of the tantric traditions to point out how they surface both in TA 29 and in Jayaratha's investigation. (a) Other Traditions The Tantraloka falls within the tradition of tantric Saivisrn. It should be seen firstly in contrast to the 'orthodox', Vedic, tradition which Abhinava the Brahman does not totally reject. Rather, he eliminates it from his concern by relegating it to the lowest posi­tion in the hierarchy of revelations Siva has granted to mankind. The purpose of incorporating the Vedic element is firstly to main-tain social conventions of life in the world, out of compassion for those who know no better and secondly to protect the reputation of the Saiva gurus.2 The Veda is embodied in the ideal Brahman whom Sanderson describes as follows: 'Brahmanhood in its orthodox form as the basis of the path of purity was of two levels, the physical and 1.

The first, conferred by birth from Brahman parents and seen as an inalienable property of the body, is necessary but not sufficient for the second, par­ticipation in the society of Brahmans through the study of Vedic revelation, marriage and commensality. This could be achieved, maintained and perfected only by conformity to the corpus of rules derived directly or indirectly from the infallible Veda and embodied in the conduct of the orthodox.'3 The ritual of TA 29 inveighs against this ideal as the Kula ritual has no regard for purity or impurity. It uses forbidden foods and forbidden women. It completely overturns the meaning of brahmacarya. It downgrades the Vedas and does not see marriage, in the Vedic sense, as the most honourable estate. In addition, it opposes the Vedas in those movements such as the later Siddhanta which try to revive the Vedic viewpoint and it attends to the Vedic ritual only to reinterpret it along Kula lines.4 Smarta ceremonies were the domestic rituals every twice-born or initiated person, whether Brahman, ksatriya or vaisya, was ex­pected to perform after his marriage. The tantric ritual claimed an essential superiority over such rituals but in fact vied with them by providing equivalents in the external conduct of its own cer­emony.5 The smarta tradition is explicitly rejected as dualist in Qt.75b.3 whilst in Qt.79d.l it is dismissed as irrelevant since the Kula version of the Krama process in its third Cycle is not bound by time and place. Indeed, in the Kula rituals of TA 29 the external act is reduced to a minimum. The desire for equivalence remains 3.

The words tarpana, satiation; yoga, sacrifice; homa, oblation into the fire; and all the language of ritual are reinterpreted to refer to internal experience. Indeed, the internal sacrifice replaces and surpasses the outward observance. The tantric traditions contrast significantly with those based on the Vedas and include a whole range of types. Their history runs through three stages: oral, scriptural and exegetical. Between the years 400 C.E. and 800 C.E.6 many of the tantras were written but it is uncertain by whom they were composed and where. They are called scriptural in the sense that they are revelations from a di­vine source, either spoken by the deity to his consort or, less fre­quently, granted by the goddess to her god. In TA 4.248 ff., in the general context of a discussion on pure and impure, Abhinava compares the scriptures and concludes that there is a hierarchy of all the sacred texts. These, in ascending order of importance, consist of the Vedas, the Vaisnava scriptures and the Saiva scriptures.7 Nevertheless, in TA 29.74c, the Vaisnavas will feel the edge of Abhinava's tongue because of their dualism. In the Tantrasara, quoting the Paramesvaratantra in terms remi­niscent of TA 29.74c, he elaborates on the reasons for his rejec­tion of the Vaisnava tantras: 'The Vaisnavas etc. who all are tainted by attachment to impure knowledge do not come to know the supreme category: they are deprived of the knowledge of the One who knows all. '8 He criticises the Vaisnava school throughout the Tantraloka, a fact which indicates its importance in the life of Kashmir. Indeed, it will eventually cohabit with his thought and survive through to modern times. (b) The Saiva Tantric Scriptural Traditions The many strands of the Saiva tantric tradition are like the 6.

Nevertheless Sanderson has managed to map their course. In what follows there is no attempt to repeat this his­tory in its complexity but only to touch on those things which are strictly relevant to TA 29. Sanderson begins his survey of the tantric traditions by describ­ing the Atimarga, the 'outer' or 'transcendent' path which concerns only the ascetic and provides only for salvation. The Lakula divi­sion of the Atimarga is expressed in the Nisvasatattvasamhita which states that the ascetic '... may eat and drink anything. No action is forbidden to him. For he is immersed in contemplation of Rudra, knowing that no other deity will save him. '9 Sanderson goes on to note that the Lakula ascetic '... was to aban­don the more basic notion of the pure and the impure.'10 However, the Tantraloka is not concerned with the ascetic so much as with the householder and for that reason it is situated within the tradition of the Mantramarga. This strand comprises a whole ramification of traditions which constitute a trajectory to­wards the feminine and move towards ever more powerful and more esoteric systems of ritual.11 The ramification can be set out as follows: The Mantramarga divides into: • Saivasiddhanta • Bhairava-tantras, these latter bifurcate into: • Mantrapitha • Vidyapitha, this latter sub-divides into: • Yamala-tantras • Sakti-tantras, these latter divide into: • Trika-tantras and Kali-tantras. 9.

They do admit the existence of his female consort but she is largely an abstraction and the daily ritual does not incorporate her worship. The 'mantra', i.e. the deity, is without sakti.12 Furthermore, the ritual conforms to the Veda and is the least esoteric of the tantric rituals. However, one must clearly distinguish between the early Saivasiddhanta texts and their later reinterpretation according to a Vedic orientation by the Saivasiddhantins of Abhinava's day. In TA 29.74cd-75ab, the later Saivasiddhantins receive his strongest criticism: 'The mantras given by the Siddhdntas and the Vaisnavas etc. are therefore impure. Because they can­not bear so much splendour, they are lifeless, accord­ing to the non-dual tradition'. The Kapalika tradition had a profound influence on the progress of these tantric traditions. It is closely linked with the Lakula branch of the Atimarga13 and is also found in the earlier tradition of Svacchandabhairava but in the Vidyapitha it comes to the fore.14 The Kapalika tradition has been thoroughly studied by Lorenzen who proposes that the movement originated in South India or on the Deccan plateau perhaps in the fifth or sixth centuries. He describes the devotee: '...a typical Kapalika. He smears his body with the ashes of the dead; he carries a trident and a skull bowl; he worships Bhairava and Mahakapalin; his text is the Bhairavagama; he honours this god with liquor and offerings of human heads; and he imagines salvation as the indescribable bliss of an endless embrace in the arms of Uma.15 12.

This gratification required the participation of a duti, a con­secrated consort, with whom he was to copulate in or­der to produce the mingled sexual fluids which, with blood and other impurities of the body, provided the offering irresistible to this class of deities.'18 The Yogini Cult also forms part of the background of the Vidyapitha which is of particular significance for TA 29. The yoginis of legend are fearsome apparitions who are both wildly dangerous and the source of great boons.19 They radiate from the heart of the deity20 as sources of power which govern time and space and send out further emanations of female powers which are visible in the sacred sites (pitha) and cremation grounds (smasana).

By placating these hordes with horrific substances, even with the vital fluids of one's own body, and perhaps even by copulating with them, the devotee gained the ascendancy and so secured their powers over the cosmos etc. The male deity wor­shipped in this ritual is Rudra or Bhairava,'... the wild ascetic who leads the Yogini hordes (yoginigananayaka).21 The cult of the yoginis seems to have been the earliest form of what becomes the Kula tradition. They are usually sixty-four in number, a traditional number usually interpreted as eight times the eight 'mothers' (matrka).21 All the yoginis belong to a family (kula) or to a clan (gotra) grouped into 63 [64?] sisterhoods.23 However there are 8 major families who have Brahmi etc. as their 'Mothers' (matr) and who are of particular importance at the mo­ment of initiation, for the guru ascertains, by the manner in which the flower falls, to which of the families and to which of the 'Moth­ers', the initiate belongs and which of the yoginis he is to seek and which powers he will receive.

It occupies a significant place in the thought of Abhinava who often includes it in his listing of the hierarchy of traditions.24 The Trika belongs to the group of the Sakti-tantras and has three stages of development. At a first stage, it is based simply on the 21. ibid. 22. Padoux, Le coeur, p.58. 23. Sanderson, 'Saivism', p.672. 24.

At a second stage, those three goddesses are subsumed into Kali who transcends them as the fourth goddess. At the third stage, the Trika is influenced to a profound degree by the Isvarapratyabhijnakarika. The first stage is expressed in the Siddha-yogesvarimata as well as in the Malinivijayottaratantra and the Tantrasadbhava in which the trika, 'the set of three' goddesses and their emanations of lesser yoginis comprise the whole array of cosmic levels and are imag­ined as present within the body of the worshipper. His own central axis is the staff of their mandala while above his head are three lotuses which represent the three goddesses.25 Para is worshipped both as 'one of the three and as their sum and source'.26 In this last capacity she is also called Matrsadbhava, 'Essence of the Moth­ers'. By supplying them with alcohol and meat on a surface such as a cloth, the worshipper ascends the levels of beings and so ar­rives at the absolute. The other main division of the Sakti-tantras concerns the cult of the single goddess Kali as found in the Jayadrathayamala alias the Tantrarajabhattaraka. The first quarter of this immense work of 24,000 verses describes Kali or Kalasahkarsini, Destroyer of Time, in terms of the Yogini Cult. The remaining three quarters go far beyond this understanding. Here Bhairava is superseded, even dismembered. The goddess is 'the hidden emaciated [krsa] destroyer who embodies ... consciousness.' Thus she is also called Krsa.27 She both emits and reabsorbs.28 The emaciated goddess, Krsa, is worshipped in TA 29.76 and Qt.77d.l. (c) The Kula Reform Abhinava gives two sources for the origins of the Kula tradition. Firstly, in TA 1.7, he praises Macchanda as the source of his own doctrine, a point Jayaratha takes up in his commentary and extends 25.

It has already been noted above that the daughter of Tryambaka is the source of the Kula tradition. The word kula refers to the family or grouping of the yoginis and of the 'Mothers'. It is also taken to mean the corporeal body, the body of power, the cosmic body, the totality of things so that by entering into a 'family', a kula, the worshipper enters into the totality of cosmic powers, the kula. He himself, in his own body, is the embodiment of the 'Mothers' and of the whole of reality. By being initiated into a 'Mother' he also enters into one or other level of his own body and becomes master of the powers identified with it. By piercing all the circles of his body he is master of the totality30 and attains the central deity which is identified with the true self of the worshipper, his 'blissful inner consciousness'31 of whom the eight 'Mothers' are the projections. Abhinava distinguishes between the Kula and the Kaula in his listings of the hierarchy of tradition. The Kula tradition, Sanderson holds, belongs to ascetics who are close to the Kapalika and pre­serve a connection with the cremation ground and wear various insignia. Contrary to this, the Kaula tradition is a reformed ver­sion which makes allowance for the householder.32 This being said, the distinction is not so clear. The ritual described in TA 29 is called Kula and yet is applicable to the householder. The original Yogini Cult suited those who were removed from everyday life. By con­trast, the Kaula reform allows the Yogini Cult to become available to the householder by placing the emphasis on inner experience. 29.

The terminology of the Kapalika or Yogini cult could then be transferred to his domestic ritual and the externals of those cults could be justifiably aban­doned as superfluous. The Kaula version of the Trika thus under­stood itself to be the essence of tantric practice.33 At some unknown date,34 the Kaula developed four transmis­sions, each with its own set of deities, mantra, mandala, mythic figures etc.35 These four are the eastern or 'earliest' (purva) whose chief divinity is Kulesvari; the northern (uttara) whose chief di­vinity is Kalika, i.e. the twelve Kalis; the western (pascima) whose chief divinity is Kubjika; and the southern (daksina) whose chief divinity is the goddess Kamesvari/Tripurasundari.36 Of these four transmissions, the Eastern and Northern are found in TA 29. The Eastern Transmission (purvamnaya) is contrasted with the earlier or first stage of the Trika which is called tantra-prakriya.37 This Kaula reform of the Trika is well-established in Kashmir by about 800 C.E.38 and is entitled kula-prakriya. Jayaratha reports that Abhinava considered the Kula to be superior to the Tantra: 'And in this way, he esteems more highly the guru who follows the Kula ritual procedure (kulaprakriya) - be­cause of [its] restfulness - in comparison with the guru who is devoted to tantra ritual procedure (tantrapra-kriya).'39 This statement is born out by even a cursory comparison of TA 15-16, two chapters full of ritual activity, with TA 29 where the ritual is largely reduced.

He is consistent in his sev­eral listings of the arrangement45 except for the so-called Mata which varies its position, being placed usually before or some­times after the Kula. But what does 'Mata' mean? Does it refer to that variant of the Northern Transmission called 'the Mata' or to the other variant of the Northern Transmission called 'the Krama' which features so frequently in the Tantraloka.

Thus the Trika locates itself at the furthest remove from neutral 'vedic 'orthodoxy. '46 At the apex of that hierarchy stands the Trika, surpassing both the Kula and the Kaula. This point is made explicitly in Paratrimsikavivarana p.217 line 22 where, before listing the hier­archy of schools Abhinava quotes the phrase: 'The Trika is higher than the Kula,' (kulat parataram trika), where the word 'Trika' re­fers to SAUH47 and not to the rituals and mandala etc. associated with the Trika. The inner knowledge of the single mantra SAUH surpasses in simplicity and effectiveness all other mantras, rituals and traditions, even those of the Kula. (e) The Exegesis of the Saiva Tantric Traditions The third stage of the tantric traditions is the post-scriptural or exegetical stage which occurs in the middle of the ninth century C.E.48 and produces two major streams, on the one hand the Saivasiddhanta and on the other the Trika and Krama.49 Both streams are directed at the householder who seeks not the super­natural powers of the ascetic but liberation. According to the later Saivasiddhanta, liberation consists in being like Siva, equal to Siva, yet essentially other than Siva.50 Similarly, the Saivasiddhanta exegetes establish a division between the individual and the world such that the Siddhanta is fundamen­tally dualist. The endless cycle of birth and rebirth is due to the stain (mala) which is a substance (dravya). As such it can only be removed by what is equally material, namely the Saivasiddhanta ritual. The initiatory ritual removes this stain whilst the daily and the occasional ceremonies continue to remove any persisting impu­rity. Complete liberation occurs only at death when the practitio­ner is at last free of the world. 46. Sanderson, 'The visualisation', p.50. 47. Pandey, p.601. 48.

The supreme goddess of the Trika, Para, is then as­similated to the supreme goddess of the Krama who absorbs and transcends the other goddesses and is called Sri Para. By a play on the word matr which can mean either 'mother' or 'knowing sub­ject', Sri Para is now understood, in fact, to be the 'Essence of Knowing Subjects', Matrsadbhava. When these four, Sri Para, Para, Parapara and Apara, are multiplied by the three stages of emana­tion, preservation and reabsorption (srsti, sthiti and samhara) they constitute a group of twelve but in fact the twelve can be calcu­lated in two ways, as a multiple either of 3 x 4 or of 4 x 3. These are equivalent51 since the fourth goddess, Matrsadbhava and the fourth phase, 'ineffable' (anakhya) or 'nameless' (anama) are the same. The multiple of 4x3 can be put schematically as follows: known knowing knower emanation 1. 5. 9. preservation 2. 6. 10. reabsorption 3. 7. 11. 'ineffable' 4. 8. 12.

Libera­tion consists in attaining that source and in realising it. The next stage of the development occurs with Somananda who composed the Sivadrsti, the seminal work of what will eventually be called the Pratyabhijna school. Sornananda gives a more philosophical cast to the movement which began with Vasugupta.54 Somananda's pupil, Utpaladeva, develops a classical formulation of the move­ment in his Isvarapratyabhijnasutra written towards the begin­ning of the tenth century.55 The Pratyabhijna school takes its name from that work. In opposition to the later Saivasiddhanta, the Trika allows that a person can achieve liberation through ritual as well as through insight alone. These two, ritual and insight, are not opposed for ritual is the mirror of hidden realities and can reveal to the practi­tioner his own innate nature. This knowledge is the act of salva­tion, it is an awareness that the practitioner is truly Siva. He does not become like Siva or even become Siva, but rather he comes to realise he is Siva. Liberation is the moment of recognition (pratyabhijna).56 Similarly, liberation from bondage is not a re­lease from the world but the realisation that the world is simply the expression of oneself. Just as the practitioner and Siva are one, so the practitioner and the world are one reality which is free, con­scious, omnivalent. Although by coming to knowledge the practi­tioner regains the original state of consciousness, he does not re­main at this level. Although he is essentially Siva and all reality is simply the expression of his self, he freely 'contracts', he lessens his glory and manifests himself in limited subjects such that 'this' and 'that' appear in dualist fashion.

Guided by the light which emanates from it, people can easily be engaged in the rituals.'1 In this way he gives a double emphasis: truth and ritual. Accord­ingly, the first half of the work, Chapters 1-13, deals with the ex-position of a world view whilst the second half, Chapters 14-37, describes the rituals. The Tantraloka is destined for his own disciples and is there-fore directed to those who are already acquainted with the sub­ject-matter. It is not a work of popularisation, not even of haute vulgarisation and, trying to cover the whole range of tantric lore, summarises and does not elaborate. What was perhaps clear to his entourage is allusive and cryptic to readers who do not have their background. 1. TA 37.83cd."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"24   The Kula Ritual (b) Models of Composition Rastogi suggests that Abhinava uses four models in composing his Tantraloka.2 It is a sangrahagrantha, a 'digest of tantric litera­ture and lore'; a prakriya-grantha or paddhati-grantha, a manual of practice; a sastra-grantha, a religious treatise or fully struc­tured text; a stuti-grantha, a hymn of praise. The Tantraloka combines elements of all these genres. In first place, it can be truly described as 'A Digest of Tantric Literature and Lore'. The list of works mentioned by Abhinava in the Tantraloka is long and he draws on them to form a compendium and to show that his own work gives their true meaning and is correctly entitled 'The Light on the Tantras'. Abhinava himself defines the Tantraloka as a varttika3 which is defined as the expo­sition of what is said, what is left unsaid or what is inadequately said.4 Quite specifically the Tantraloka is a gloss on the Malinivij-ayottaratantra for he says: There is nothing here [in the Tantraloka] which is not in the illustrious Malinivijayottara'5 which text provides the essence, he says in TA 1.19, of the three Saiva currents: the dual current represented by ten scriptures; the dual-non-dual current expressed in eighteen scriptures; and the non-dual current represented in the sixty-four scriptures. This being said, TA 29 can hardly be classed as a simple commentary on the Malinivijayottaratantra since from sl.21 till sl,187cd he does not quote from the Malinivijayottaratantra and when he does quote it is sometimes with a notable slant.6 The word varttika applies, therefore, in the sense of' that which is left unsaid'. In fact, as far as TA 29 is concerned, Abhinava prefers texts such as the Madhavakula, the Viravali or the Yogasaiicara but until these texts become available we cannot say if he adheres to them more closely than he does to the Malinivijayottaratantra. 2.

On the one hand he reveres them and is at pains to support his argument by appeal­ing to their authority. On the other hand he submits the texts to his own structures so that various parts of TA 29 do not fit well to­gether, as for instance sections A and B of Sacrifice 2 which de­pend on the Madhavakula and the Yogasancara respectively. The same occurs within a single passage as in the case of the second rite of ordinary initiation where he refers to the Ratnamala alone but does not seem to present a coherent ritual so that one wonders whether he may have inserted material from an unnamed source. The second half of the Tantraloka presents the various initia­tions and consecrations in great detail and so constitutes a sort of manual of tantric practice. TA 29 itself is clearly a manual of prac­tice and is divided into two major sections: the rituals for the ini­tiate and the rituals of initiation. This being said, TA 29 is not a set of rubrics. Sacrifice l and the rituals of initiation do make use of a clearly defined pattern but the sequence of the rituals moves in­creasingly towards the internal forum which functions according to its own spontaneity. Jayaratha describes Abhinava as the 'composer of a religious treatise' (sastrakarah)7 and shows how the initial statement (adivakya) given in TA 1.1-21, presents the four purposes of a re­ligious treatise.8 Likewise, the second sentence of TA 29, sl. lcd-2ab, is the adivakya which defines the Chapter as a religious trea­tise on Kula ritual procedure. Just these two lines contain the four indispensable elements (anubandhacatustaya)9 required in any religious treatise. 1. prayojana, the purpose: defined here as 'is described', a purpose Jayaratha expresses more fully in Jr.02 with the word abhidatum, 'to expound'; 2. adhikari, one who is qualified to receive the subject mat­ter: defined here as 'the most advanced gurus and dis­ciples'; 7.

The structure of TA 29 is set out as a whole in Appendix 15 and together with the overview of TA 29 given in Chapter 6 shows how fitting the title 'religious treatise' is for TA 29. The final model to be considered is that of the Tantraloka as a 'hymn of praise'. It is the weakest of the models since the number of hymns is very small. Abhinava places a prayer at the beginning (upakrama) and end (upasamhara) of the Tantraloka.™ Just as ev­ery one of his works includes a blessing,11 so too TA 29 has a hymn of praise strategically placed at the conclusion of the sections which deal with intercourse. In imitation of his master, Jayaratha intro­duces all thirty-seven chapters of the Tantraloka-except Chapter l -with a verse of two lines. (c) Generalities on Style Although the Tantraloka and TA 29 are finely structured, the work is conceived as an integrated whole such that it cannot be broken into detached sections.12 Since Abhinava wishes to avoid isolating one Chapter from the next he makes use of the technique of what Jayaratha calls samcayanyaya, 'aggregate' or 'accumulation',13 where the one sloka is divided into two halves, the first serving as the end of one chapter or section and the second beginning the next Chapter or Section. This occurs between every Chapter of the Tantraloka and frequently within TA 29.14 10. Rastogi, pp.11-12. 11. Pandey, p. 105. 12. Rastogi, p.76. 13. Tannaloka vol.2, p.309 line 9. 14.

Nor should it be kept com­pletely secret'.16 The reader is thus obliged to read the whole text before one topic can be fully appreciated or sometimes even un­derstood and so the fine structuring of the text goes hand in hand with a certain obscuration. The verses are compact so that the sentences and phrases need to be read both backwards and forwards, with reference to what precedes and what follows. The words also have various levels of meaning: being interpreted both in an obvious and in a symbolic sense, applying on the gross, subtle and supreme levels, under­stood as object, means and subject of knowledge, such that a text is not so much to be read as mulled over. Once these initial diffi­culties are overcome the passages can be read and reread with in­creasing profit. This monograph attempts only to overcome the initial difficulties and to provide at least one intelligible reading. (d) The Manuscript Many of the manuscript texts discovered in Kashmir were writ­ten in the sarada script.17 Indeed, Jayaratha makes the point that Abhinava actually refers to the morphology of that script.18 This fact is significant in understanding the symbolism of the phoneme H in TA 29. The Tantraloka of Abhinavagupta in its entirety to­gether with Jayaratha's investigation or commentary (viveka) was presumably transliterated from the sarada script and was certainly first published in 12 volumes between 1918-1938. Its editor, Mukund Ram Shastri, does not provide any editorial note or pref­ace so that little is known about the manuscript sources. He seems to have used a base text plus three other manuscripts designated by the nagari letters Ka, Kha and Ga. These three are referred to in footnotes and give the variant readings.

His father, Srngararatha, was minister to King Rajaraja who is probably the same as Jaya Simha and who lived around 1200 C.E. while Jayaratha himself flourished around 1225-1275 C.E.1 He was initiated by Subhata Datta and his teacher in Saivism was Kalyana. At the instigation of the king he studied the Tantraloka2 and without royal patronage could not have con­cluded the task.3 Besides the viveka on the Tantraloka he wrote the Alankara Vimarsini, a commentary on the Alankara Sarvasva of Ruyyaka, and the Alankarodaharana.4 He also wrote the Vamakesvarlmata-vivarana, a commentary on the Nityasodasikarnava, the basic scripture of the South Transmis­sion of Tripurasundarl.5 Rastogi tries to reconstruct the circumstances that surrounded Jayaratha's massive undertaking in commenting on the Tantraloka. He proposes in the first place that the text of the Tantraloka had become corrupt6 and that Jayaratha restored both the text and the correct order of the slokas? He proposes furthermore that Jayaratha's viveka was not the first commentary and that other com­mentaries existed8 which either assisted him or against which he 1. Sanderson,'Saivism', p.689. 2.

Rastogi proposes, therefore, that quite different points of view were entertained concerning the Tantraloka.9 If so, there is little evidence of contention in Jayaratha's commentary for he gives the impression of being focussed and unassailable. These other commentaries have not survived so that the Tantraloka is in the unusual position of having only one commentary or investiga­tion which is yet thorough and complete. In a sense the viveka is not just a commentary but is an extension of the Tantraloka.10 For example, the long intervention on the meaning and use of alcohol, Jr.13d.l-l3 and Qt.l3d.l-25, explains the multiple meanings and uses of alcohol and defends it against what must have been severe criticism. There is no such defense concerning the use of the sexual partner. Indeed, although Jayaratha accepts that he is writing a viveka, investigation, he prefers to call his work prakasana, eluci­dation,11 and rightly so for his work is illuminating and without it TA 29 would be most difficult to understand.12 As already noted earlier, Abhinava gives to the Tantraloka the style and character of a sastra. Jayaratha follows suit and proposes, in Jr. 166b.2, that TA 29 or rather Sacrifices 3 and 4 constitute a sastra since the two sacrifices provide the vidya, mantra, mudra and mandala which establish the four-fold base that every sastra must have.13 Abhinava has himself divided the Tantraloka into its topics and sub-topics. Jayaratha also provides connotative titles for all the chapters of the Tantraloka14 and SO highlights the meaning of the chapter. For example in Jr.0.2 he adds the title 'the ritual of the secret study'. He also clearly signposts the Sub-topics. In Jr.2b.l and Jr.2b.2, he scarcely refers to the Sub-topic 'the category 'qualified''. 9. ibid, pp.107-108. 10. ibid, p.102. 11. 'Jayaratha's titles are invariably followed by the word 'Prakasana'.

Rastogi, p.138."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Jayaratha   31   However, in Jr.l7d.3, he indicates the actual commencement of the 'Kula procedure concerning the Perfected Beings and their wives' and in Jr.55d.3 he clearly explains that it has just been com­pleted. In Jr.55d.3, he introduces the Sub-topic: 'the ritual of ado-ration', and in Jr.95d.2 he introduces 'the ritual with the sexual partner'. Jr. 186b.2 notes the conclusion of 'the ritual of the secret teaching' and introduces the Sub-topic 'initiation'. Jr.224d.2 intro­duces 'consecration' while Jr.235d.2 introduces 'penetration'. Furthermore he clearly marks the sub-divisions within a sub-topic. For example, the divisions within the ritual of adoration are clearly noted by Jayaratha in Jr.57d.4, Jr.70b.7, Jr.77d.3 so that these three constitute three varieties of the 'ritual of the sacred sites'. Furthermore, Jr.81d.3 notes the conclusion of the ritual of adora­tion and the beginning of a distinct but relevant discussion on reci­tation. Jr.95d.2 repeats the clear distinction. Again, Jayaratha, by the way in which he positions his interventions, divides the text into short units, into what might loosely be called karikas which are somewhat self-contained and so allow a coherent commen­tary. All these smaller divisions are important for understanding the text since the larger divisions into topic and sub-topics do not adequately present the argument for a reader who is unacquainted with the subject matter. By and large this monograph follows the divisions into karikas suggested by Jayaratha. After having made these divisions into karikas, Jayaratha pro­ceeds to surround them with both an introduction and an elucida­tion. He first introduces the lines by providing the bridge, which is not always self-evident, between the preceding statement of Abhinava and the following. In doing so he may take on the role of a disciple and ask for clarification or take on the role of an opponent and raise an objection which is sometimes couched in the form of a quotation. The objection is often introduced by the word nanu which need not be translated. To these questions Abhinava is imagined to give his reply. The interventions are well chosen and show that Jayaratha has understood the precise issue at hand. After giving the verses of the text Jayaratha proceeds to comment upon them. He first of all explains the meanings of words."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"32   The Kula Ritual For example, he will explain that the 'ejaculated form' (abhyuditam rupam) in Jr.l28b.l refers to the sexual fluid. He also provides alternative terms for well-known words that have occurred in the text or in order to prepare the reader for words in a quotation. For example, Jayaratha gives six quotations, Qt.39d.l-6, from the Kulakridavatara which list somewhat differing details on the her­mitages etc. In order to prepare the reader for these quotations he gives, in Jr.39d.l, a list of equivalents. He is speaking about tex­tual and functional equivalents, not necessarily about geographi­cal equivalents. Again, the list of equivalents in Jr.66d.l is given not only to explain the meaning of sl.66 but also to square the text of sl.66 with Qt.66d.l-3. This being said, the harmonisation of Abhmava's text and a quotation can be tortuous, as in Jr.72b.l. After explaining the meanings of individual words and phrases of a verse Jayaratha may also give a paraphrase wherein he dis­plays all his skill. The text of Abhinava is often in code or sym­bolic language and is extremely compressed so that it can only be understood in the light of the paraphrase. For example, sl.83-88 can hardly be understood without Jr.88d.l. Again, sl.278cd-281 needs Jr.281d.l-2. In his paraphrase he interpolates definitions of terms as well as references to other passages from TA 29. He suggests the various levels on which Abhmava's text may be read. For example, Jr. 104b. 1 shows that sl. 104ab can be understood both as a description of sexual intercourse and as a summary of the five levels of consciousness. He equally suggests that the five levels are in fact experienced in intercourse. The paraphrase is not only a commentary on the verses preceding but also a preparation for the verses which follow. The elucidation needs to be read both back­wards and forwards. Thus, the same paraphrase just mentioned, Jr.l04b.l, prepares the reader for the description of intercourse which starts at sl.l04cd-105ab. Does Jayaratha read more into Abhinava's text than is present? In general the answer is no. The most notable example of over-interpreting is his commentary on the word 'if, in sl.96, which he interprets as 'must'. Does he read all that is available in them? It is most unlikely since a finely wrought text such as TA 29 admits of many readings."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Jayaratha   33   The commentary from Jayaratha's own pen amounts to more than 1150 lines of about 18 syllables each. It is a significant con­tribution. A most notable aspect of the investigation is Jayaratha's use of quotations. The longest quotation, Qt. 100b.5, occupies 29 lines while the shortest is one half-line. He makes a total of 172 quotations from various sources and these amount to a total of 422 lines. By comparison, the text of Abhinavagupta amounts to 583 lines. Thus the original text of Abhinavagupta has been consider­ably amplified. Some of the quotations are taken from other parts of TA 29 or from other chapters of the Tantraloka just as parts of TA 29 such as sl.66 and sl.162cd-163ab are quoted in earlier chap­ters of the Tantraloka. This shows Jayaratha's complete familiar­ity with the whole of the immense work while it implies that the reader should draw together the meaning of the various contexts in which the same quotation is found. That comment applies also to repeated quotations from sources other than Abhinava, such as Qt.8ld.l: 'His saktis are the whole universe', or Qt.98b.l: 'Bliss is the form of brahman'. The various contexts of the one quota­tion are significant to each other. At times the quotations are given in a straightforward manner. At other times the quotations are woven into Jayaratha's paraphrase so as to produce very complex sentences which are always gram­matically correct, just as the Sanskrit is always accurate, but which lack smoothness of flow. This technique also shows his skill and comprehension. A good case in point is Jayaratha's investigations following on sl. 109ab, sl. 126 and sl. l 53ab."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 5 PARAMETERS OF THE TANTRALOKA The following contextualisation of TA 29 is not a summary of the Tantraloka.1 Rather, it presents the several concepts and struc­tures within which TA 29 functions. These are drawn from the Tantraloka as a whole and use the main terms found in TA 29. 1. The Absolute (a) As a Unitary Reality T (aham) is the primary consideration of TA 29. Reality is not to be reduced to mere objects. It is not just the projection of the fac­ulties of knowledge, of sub-conscious impulses or of a mind con­ditioned by social forces. The essence of reality is personal: 'I am'. However, the personal 'I am' is not to be confused with the indi­vidual, the atomic, limited self. The universally personal knows no such limitation. It says 'I am' and cannot say 'I am not'. The T stands as the basis of the three forms, 'subject of knowl­edge' or 'knower' (pramatr); 'means of knowledge' or 'knowing' (pramana); and 'object of knowledge' or 'the known' (prameya) or the world of objectivity designated by pronouns such as 'he' 'she', 'it'. The three forms may be understood in some sort of opposition to each other but there is yet a fourth term (pramiti) which refers to the unity of all three such that the knower knows by means of his own self and at the same time is the known. Thus Kashmir Saivism is not so much a doctrine of being as a doctrine of revelation. 1. A recent summary of the contents of each chapter of the Tantraloka is available in Lilian Silburn and Andre Padoux, La Lumiere sur les tantras, chapitres 1 a 5 du Tantraloka, Paris, E. de Boccard, 1998, pp.31-37."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Parameters of the Tantraloka  35  Before ever the world is emanated, the Light knows its Light by means of its own Light. Since Siva is identical with his emana­tion, when he contemplates the world he contemplates his own self. All lesser means of knowledge, such as the faculties, logic etc., are particular forms of his own universal Light. The perceiv­ing subject of whom all is a manifestation is, by definition, unsurpassable (anuttara). There is no other perceiver who could reduce him to an object of knowledge or define him.2 The unsurpassability is not the same as transcendence for which, strictly speaking, there is no place since all reality is a revelation of the supreme knower. He is his revelation.3 Knowledge (jnana), is the basis of the whole construction of Abhinava's world view. It refers first and foremost to the knowl­edge which is all-inclusive such that nothing is excluded from its range of vision. It can also refer to category 33 in the thirty-six divisions of reality4 which already involves a limitation of bound­less knowledge. It can refer to differentiated thought (vikalpa) and to the knowledge of phenomena such as 'blue' and 'pleasant'. These vastly different meanings of the word jnana can easily lead to con­fusion. They must not be confused, neither must they be opposed since all forms of knowledge are expressions of the supreme knowl­edge and all relate to each other. The terms linked to jnana are many. TA 29 prefers the word samvit, consciousness, which cap­tures something of the totality (sam) of knowledge and refers to what unites all forms of knowledge in one act of perception. The term 'idealism' is sometimes used to describe the Saivism of Abhinava. The term may conjure up several nineteenth century Western schools of thought and may also seem to be the opposite of 'realism'. However, in the thought of Abhinava, objects are not unreal or illusory. They are real, not because they are dualistically separate from the subject but because they are truly projected from the subject's own being. The cosmos derives from the antecedent supreme T. Objects take their reality and their meaning from him. He is not reduced to their inertia. 2. Paratrisikalaghuvrtti p.49. 3. Padoux, Vac, p.235 footnote 25. 4. See Appendix 1."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"36   The Kula Ritual (b) As a Mutuality The pair of terms 'splendour' (prakasa) and 'reflection' (vimarsa) are used to express the ineffable consciousness. That is, the know­ing subject knows that he knows. Consciousness is not ignorant of its consciousness. If consciousness is splendour then vimarsa is the awareness of the splendour. It is the self-evidence of light, a sort of reflection but not an introspection or introversion. There is no obscurity, no room for doubt, and because of this assurance there is an infinite capacity to act which is called sakti and is of paramount importance throughout TA 29. A certain ambiguity attaches to consciousness. It can be under-stood as the splendour whose counterpart is reflection. It is pos­sible, however, to go a step further back, so to speak, and to ac­knowledge the void, the altogether apophatic, about which noth­ing is said and yet which is known to be the fount of all. The con­sciousness which arises in this context is sakti, who is the goddess (TA29.118ab). Just as consciousness knows no limit so it knows no restriction. It does not resist and is irresistible, it remains the subject and cannot be subject to another. It enjoys an essential freedom (sva-tantrya). As the self-evidence of consciousness it occurs naturally, spontaneously. It 'happens'. Consciousness and freedom are a fundamental pair. The divine sakti is the freedom of Siva and all her emanations are made in utter freedom. The mastery of Siva expresses itself in doing what is impossible and extremely difficult5 taking on the form of limited subjects or even in using the impurity of things in order to realise the pure light of consciousness. Reflection (vimarsa) is simply the self-revelation of consciousness and so is the primary act of revelation. As such it is a dynamic reality and is appropriately called sakti since the word 'sakti' derives from the verbal root SAK 'to be able' and can be translated as 'energy', 'power' etc. However, by definition sakti cannot adequately be defined since she herself is the defining agent. From sakti as self-revelation, derive all the other revelations, the 5.

Everything is sakti.6 The will (iccha) is not involved in the foremost manifestation of sakti. Voluntarism has no part to play in this system. Rather, the sakti spontaneously arises, of her own volition, so to speak. Yet consciousness is not a detachment, an uninvolved observa­tion. The sakti is consciousness recognising itself and assenting to itself. The term saktiman means, literally, 'the person (masculine gen­der) who possesses energy'.7 It stands in relation to sakti as does Siva or as consciousness does to self-revelation. It occurs frequently in TA 29 where it refers to the male practitioner in union with his sexual partner, for these have become assimilated to the divine pair. Among the more useful and fully expounded8 similes is that of the mirror. Strictly speaking, the mirror cannot be seen and be­comes apparent, in a sense, only when an image appears on its surface. Precisely because it has no particular form it is capable of an infinity of forms. On this analogy Siva is the mirror which has no form while sakti, prior to any particularisation, is the capacity of the mirror to take on any form. In terms of language, Siva is the ineffable which is the starting point of any statement, and in terms of art he is the king of dancers (nataraja). The postures he adopts are not something apart from him yet he is not limited to any one posture and he transcends them all. He is essentially void. In ordinary language, the reflection (pratibimba) seen in a mir­ror is the reflection of something external to the mirror-a face, a vase of flowers-which is the original object being reflected (bimba). By extension, the word pratibimba refers also to the 'reflection' found in the mirror of consciousness which is the bimba. In this extended sense, however, there is strictly speaking no bimba since 6. Nevertheless, in Tantrasara p.27 line 9 - p.28 line 2, in the chapter on sakri method (saktopaya) Abhinava gives a long list of words to describe sakti. Many of these words will reappear in TA 29 and its investgation. 7. TA 1.69-74. 8. TA 3.1-64."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"38   The Kula Ritual there is no object apart from consciousness. Furthermore, con­sciousness is 'void' and cannot be reflected. In fact nothing is re­flected and there is no reflection, neither bimba nor pratibimba. Rather, the image arises spontaneously in the 'mirror' of conscious­ness.9 Nevertheless the term pratibimba is used to refer to any ex­pression of a higher reality. Therefore, Siva and sakti are related as bimba and pratibimba, the original and its reflection. This imaging forth occurs at every stage of the emanation. Each category of reality (tattva) is the source of the one which follows, and each later category is a reflection of its source.10 Thus action, category 32, is an expression of the previous category, knowledge, which is category 33. That is, knowledge is the source of action since a person acts according to what he has in mind. Or again, the practitioner who has reached the state of Bhairava may wish to express himself in an external ritual which thus becomes a reflec­tion of his divine self, as noted in Jr.24d.2. (c) As a Unity The pairs of terms we have been considering must not lead to a sense of dichotomy. The words eka, one; advaita, non-dual; anavacchinna, undivided; tadatmya, identity, are often used pre­cisely in order to prevent any sense of dualism at the highest level. The polarities noted above are not dualities for the highest reality is not a sameness but a relationship of such sort that one term essentially involves the other. Other terms which come now for consideration bring our attention back to the essential unity of con­sciousness. The first such term is kaula. In ordinary usage it is interchange­able with kula but since the term kaula can also mean 'combina­tion', it can refer to the union of Kula and Akula. In TA 29.117b, kaula refers to Kula and Akula, to sakti and the one who possesses sakti, to Siva and sakti in their union. All emanates from them in such a way that the emanation is not divided from them. Rather, the panoply of the world is simply the revelation of themselves. 9.

Padoux, Vac, p.231."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Parameters of the Tantraloka  39  Thus the kaula, the union of Siva and sakti, is at the same time the totality of knowledge and the objects of knowledge. The relationship of Siva and sakti is one of complete harmony and repose, (visranti). The term 'repose' does not signify idleness but effortless act. Each category rests in the one in which it was originally contained, from which it has proceeded and to which it returns.\" All reality rests in sakti which in turn rests upon the void of Siva. This relationship, though a perfect repose, is also expressed by the term spanda, vibration, since the elements of an oscillation are essentially related to each other. The play of cognition and recognition is a constant vibration of which the vibrating cosmos is a reflection. The term spanda can be taken at various levels. It is Siva and sakti, awareness, creative awareness,12 and the outflow of the whole world.13 At the very highest level, before any expression, cognition and recognition are perfectly related to each other so that nothing more is needed. The adequacy of one to the other is bliss (ananda). The adequacy or bliss is experienced (anubhava) and cannot be de­scribed nor proven. In TA 3.68, bliss is noted as the first effect of the union of Siva and sakti and as their most characteristic aspect. 'The paired (yamalam) form of [Siva and sakti] is called union (samghatta). It is the energy of bliss from which all is emitted.'14 Indeed, TA 3.71 ff. show how the emanation occurs and how it is symbolised by the series of phonemes of the Sanskrit alphabet. In the process of emanation the divine bliss produces particular forms of bliss. Yet earthly bliss, though limited, is particularly able to open a person to eternal bliss. In TA 29, the term ananda, bliss, has several meanings. It can refer to the ultimate relationship of Siva and sakti and their perfect 11. ibid. p.192.

These vari­ous levels of meaning interpenetrate each other and the single use of the word anand can refer to one or to all of them. The unity of Siva and sakti is powerfully expressed by the pho­neme A which now introduces the symbolism of the Sanskrit al­phabet. It is feature of Kashmir Saivism, as indeed universally in India, that language and revelation are intimately associated so that the phonemes of the Sanskrit alphabet in particular are taken to symbolise all revelation. Furthermore, since in the idealism of Kashmir revelation and reality are co-terminous, the study of the phonemes is the study of being. The phonemes A and A, the first two letters of the Sanskrit alphabet, are given a rich variety of meanings which summarise the teaching on Siva and sakti and their bliss. The phoneme A can refer to Akula alone or to Kula alone or to their inseparable union. The phoneme A can refer to the goddess herself or to the union of Siva and sakti or to their bliss. From them, in the bliss of their union, all reality, i.e. all other phonemes proceed, as shall be described shortly. A further notable phonetic symbolism can be mentioned at this point. The word T (aham) is the fountainhead of all and the sum­mation of all and in its very components symbolises that totality. It can be divided in two ways: A + HA and A + H. Since A and HA are the first and last letters of the Sanskrit alphabet18 the word AHAM symbolises the beginning and end of all things. The pho­nemes A and HA also signify all the intervening letters of the 15. Jr.79d.l, Jr.lHb.l. 16. Jr.50d.l. 17. Tantrasara p.6 line 11. 18. Strictly speaking, the Sanskrit alphabet has only 49 phonemes, the last of these being HA. To round off this number, a further phoneme is 'invented': KSA. Thus either HA or KSA can be considered to be the last phoneme. The speculations differ according to the stance taken in this matter. See Padoux, Vac, p. 112 footnote 79 and ibid. p.241 footnote 43."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Parameters of the Tantraloka   41   alphabet.19 Therefore AHAM, T, contains within itself the whole emanation. Secondly, as A + H, the word AHAM can also be read dynamically in two directions, for the 'I' is an oscillation. There-fore A+H can be read in its emitting aspect when the union of Siva and sakti is expressed in external revelation. That is, A the first phoneme of the alphabet leads to the sixteenth phoneme, H, which emits the following thirty-four phonemes of the alphabet and so manifests the cosmos. 'H is the projection of reality.'20 On the other hand, A + H can also be read in the direction of reabsoiption for the 'I' draws all into itself. In this way H is a portal out of which reality emerges and back through which all returns.21 Similarly, the bindu M can symbolise either the result of the emanation, i.e. the indi­vidual, anu,21b or the supreme undivided union of Siva and Sakti.21c 2. The Emanation of the Absolute Siva and sakti in their very essence and at the highest level are a vibration, a mutuality and a unity but they also express their vi­bration in limited form. The question may be asked as to why they should do so, but no answer is given except that it pleases Siva through his sakti to perform feats impossible and improbable. These feats or emanations (srsti) can be considered from a number of different angles. (a) As a Contraction of Splendour Cognition recognises itself by the act of self-awareness (vimarsa), an act both total and abiding. This awareness is to be distinguished from creative awareness (paramarsa) which is awareness expressed in emanation. The creative awareness itself is further to be dis­tinguished from the will (iccha) which is a limitation of creative awareness, a focussing on one possibility among many. 19. In TA 3.204cd-205ab, Abhinava applies to AHAM the grammatical rule called pratyahara whereby the whole is indicated by its start and finish. 20. Paratrimsikavivarana p.253 lines 2-3. 21. Pandey gives an extensive analysis of AHAM in his book Abhinavagupta, pp.286-293. He notes significantly that the contex of the Kula ritual is sambhavupaya, the 'means of Sambhu', whose main goal is the realisation of AHAM. ibid. p.91. 21b.

Silburn, Le Vijnana Bhairava, p.164."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"42   The Kula Ritual The creative awareness is exercised through what are commonly called 'the five acts of Siva', namely emission, stability, destruction, darkening and grace.22 The two acts, emanation (srsti) and destruction or reabsorption (samhara) are particularly associated with sakti and Siva respectively since sakti in her infinite capacity is the fountainhead of all manifestation while Siva, the perfect stillness of the void, is the end point of all reabsorption. The same basic concepts of 'emission' and 'reabsorption' are expressed by the terms samkoca, 'contraction', and vikasa, 'expansion'. Permanence or stability (sthiti) refers to the maintenance of the fabric of the universe. The third of the five acts of Siva is reabsorption (samhara), a dissolution (laya) of the emanation. The reabsorption is a reconciliation of all into their essential unity. All is merged (lina) into the being of Siva who holds all in the oneness of his undivided self. All things cease their restlessness and find repose (visranti) in the tranquillity (santa) of Siva and sakti who are perfectly fused (samarasya) in a harmony which is yet an eternal vibration without beginning or end. The fourth act is a darkening (tirodhana) since no expression is able to reveal the greatness of the divine splendour. Any manifestation is, in fact, an obscuration until such time as the person, by a later grace, attains the original light and comes to the condition of Siva (sivata). The fifth act of Siva is grace (anugraha). It is the free benevolence of Siva who wishes to bring the confused human being to the realisation (pratyabhijna) of his divinity. He is freed by grace from darkness and from its consequences, from mala, stain, and karma. The terms udita, 'rising', and santa, 'resting', which are often used in TA 29, bear much the same meaning as emanation and reabsorption. The 'rising' is the coming into existence, the mani­festation and the appearing and so is particularly associated with sakti and her emanations while santa is the disappearing from view and so is particularly associated with the ineffability of Siva.

To the unen­lightened individual, all this external reality appears to be obscure, unmanifesting, a world of objects and facts without meaning but to the enlightened person reality is symbolic, suggestive and trans­parent. Indeed, when he has come to recognise his true nature as Siva, reality is seen as the revelation of his own nature. All be­comes his supreme word and all words speak of him. The first stage or particularisation of the supreme word is pasyanti, liter-ally 'the [word] which sees [something limited]', in other words 'insight'. Here subjectivity predominates but objectivity has begun to appear. From this comes a further 'coagulation' or 'hardening' of the word which is called madhyama, literally 'the middle' [word], i.e. the word in its stage between subjectivity and total objectivity, where subjectivity still lingers but objectivity predominates, as when a person is about to say something. The final stage is the 'gross word' (vaikhari) where objectivity alone is found, as for ex­ample in the spoken or written word. The series of phonemes in the Sanskrit alphabet imitates the process of emanation. Indeed the sequence is understood to bring about the emanation and in fact to be the emanation so that the phonemes can be called 'seed' (bija) on the analogy of the small seed which contains within itself the essence (sara) of the mighty banyan and which makes the tree appear in the course of time. The emanation is divided into two stages, that of the vowels and that of the consonants while the juncture of these two stages is the. visarga, H, a phoneme of great importance. The short vowel U is the beginning of the knowledge (jnana) of what is to be emanated while the long vowel U represents the stage when the manifestation becomes more evident as a specification and therefore as a limitation or deficiency (unata), a wave (urmi) on the limpid surface of consciousness. It is like the udder (udha) of the Celestial Cow which grants every boon23 and symbolises the first six vowels.24 It is not yet the emanation itself, which only takes place with the appearance of the consonants. 23.

YA is the conjunction of the power of will, I or I, with the Absolute, A. It has the character of a swift movement which is an attribute of the wind so that it is a dessicating force. The phoneme RA (repha)29 derives from the vowel R and has the nature of heat.30 The phoneme E, in devanagari and even more in the sarada script, has the form of a downward pointing triangle and is called a triangular 'seed' (trikonabija).31 Abhinava explains its meaning: The thoughts of the unsurpassable [A] and of bliss [A] joined to the energy of the will [I] enunciate the 'tri­angle' [E] which, they say, is beautiful with the per­fume of emission.

The phoneme AI is said to have six rays35 and is called satkona36 even though the orthography of the phoneme AI does not have a six-angled shape.37 The energies of Siva are will (iccha), knowledge (jnana) and activity (kriya). All these three energies are particularly intense in the phoneme AU at the moment when the emanation is about to take place.38 The fifteenth kala, the fifteenth vowel, the phoneme M occupies a special position in the symbology. It contains the value of all the preceding phonemes and is the moment of transition when the whole energy of sound gathers to a point (bindu) and is ready to explode in the emission of the universe.39 The act of emitting- but not that which is ernitted-is symbolised by the two points of the visarga,: , which we shall discuss later. The term bindu can be interpreted in the two directions of emission and reabsorption. In the latter case it represents the summation of the whole emission, when all is concentrated once more into a point and is about to be finally reabsorbed into the void of Siva,40 so that bindu takes on the sense of pure consciousness from which all originally comes.41 34. ibid, p.269. 35.

The phonemes H, HA, HA are similar in sound while HA and S belong to the class of fricatives. Thus, although they are distinct sounds, they tend to become interchangeable. The phoneme H, pronounced as a faint emission (visarga) of breath, is called 'half-of-HA' (ha-kala) and is written as ':' in both the sarada script and the devanagari script.42 The form':' is halved, so to speak, to produce the shape '.', which is called half-of-half-of-HA,42a and which is the bindu. These phonetic and morphologi­cal details provide the symbolism. Siva and sakti together constitute AHAM. If siva is A, Sakti is HA. Consequently HA comes to represent the whole range of the word,43 all the mantras, the whole emanation and every manifesta­tion of bliss. Furthermore, as the last letter of the alphabet, HA represents the moment of transition from emanation to reabsorp-tion. The manuscripts of the Tantraloka were written in sarada, the script of Kashmir. In this script, HA is written in the shape of the Roman letter S44 and is therefore curved in shape (kutila), like an ear-ring (kundala). Since H is half-of-HA it is possible to specu­late on the visarga as kundalini. In TA 3.165cd, Abhinava notes that'... the entire universe shines within the letter sa.' However, the S is also the eternal, supreme word which is known spontaneously in sexual union.45 When S is understood as referring to the experience of the Absolute in sexo-cosmic rituals, it is called sit-kara, 'making the sound sit'.

The whole of reality consists of 36 categories (tattva)52 as set out in Appendix 1. In fact, Abhinava speculates about a 37th and 38th category but these are logical considerations rather than re­alities.53 The term tattva constantly recurs in TA 29 and its investi­gation but also acquires another quite different meaning. The knowledge of Siva, the supreme category, the category par excel­lence, produces bliss and a sexual flow which thus signifies all the categories from the highest to the lowest and also grants access to them and to all their powers. The sexual fluid is therefore called tattva, 'substance'. A category is a grouping of worlds (bhuvana), portrayed in TA 854 as a complex mandala or throne for Siva. These constitute an intricate system of enjoyments into which the disciple is initi­ated in TA 29 but they cannot be listed here. They extend, in vary­ing numbers according to various texts, from Sadasiva down to the lowest level, Kalagni, from which the reabsorption starts. Each world is distinct with its own deities, its own qualities and plea­sures into which a person is reborn according to his attitude of 52. The whole of TA 9 is an exposition of the categories. 53. There are two numbering systems. The first is as follows. Siva is essentially united with sakti and inseparable. As such he is classed as the thirty-sixth category. However, if for the sake of discussion he is regarded as separate from sakti, he may be classed as a thirty-seventh 'category'. Yet the very act of consideration involves a thirty-eight 'category' which is the sub­ject who is considering Siva as separate from sakti. This is stated simply in Tantrasara p.110 line 13-p.lll line 5. It is also dealt with in TA 11.20ab-27 and in TA 6.179 cd-181ab. See also Padoux, Vac, pp.78-81. Secondly, if Siva is considered to be a distinct thirty-sixth category, the totality of categories is classed as 'thirty-seventh'. When he is all that he emits, he is a thirty-eighth category. See TA 15.314b. See also Tantravatadhanika 3.17cd. 54. TA 8 explores the various worlds (bhuvana) and is dependent on a number of sources, in particular the Svacchandatantra. See Gnoli, Luce, p.247 footnotel. After de­scribing the cosmic mandala in its immense variety, Abhinava summarises his de­scription from il.407cd onwards. Then, in sl.436cd-452, he gives a further sum­mary taken from Malinlvijayottaratantra chapter 5 which lists 118 worlds. In that summary he states that above the hells which are ruled by Kalagni and Kusmanda is the level of earth, bhutala, whose Lords are Hataka and 'Siva', sl.437cd.

Just as a category is a grouping of worlds so the kala is a group­ing of categories.55 There are five kala: 1. nivrtti has the one cat­egory: earth; 2. pratistha extends from water through to prakrti; 3. vidya involves the categories from purusa to maya; 4. santa extends from suddhavidya to sakti. The fifth kala, corresponding to the category 'Siva', is called santatita since it transcends santa and contains all the kala.56 The causal deities (karana) govern the various levels of being. As such they are tied to limitation so that they do not enjoy the liberty the practitioner of the Kula ritual will eventually enjoy. Abhinava lists six lords which Jayaratha explains in his accompa­nying investigation.57 They are associated with the various mo­dalities of the subtle-breath, the diverse positions in the body and the steps of the life-cycle.58 They are also linked with the five well-known states of consciousness to which a sixth state is added.59 Again, in the Tantrasara, Abhinava links them with the various eons of time, with the levels of the body, with the categories, with the subtle-breath and the stages of sound.60 The categories, worlds, kala and causal deities cover the range of emanated realities.

There are three impurities or stains (mala) which are also called knots (granthi). If the highest reality is knowledge (jnana), the fundamental 'stain is ignorance' (malam ajnana).6lAbhinavaquotes an unknown text which puts it well: 'The wise describe the stain of ignorance, i.e. [the stain of] individuality, as the root cause of the stains of rnaya and karma. That same seed of the worn out tree of [transmigratory] existence is consumed instantly in the blazing fire of supreme consciousness.

The 'coverings' (kancuka) which obscure consciousness and give shape to external reality are six in number: rnaya itself, restricted activity, desire, limited knowledge, time and necessity.70 If rnaya is excluded in the sense of being a blanket term, the coverings are five in number. They may also be referred to as kala so that the word kala, as used in the terms sakala and niskala, refer to the five coverings. Thus, Siva 'without parts' or simple, niskala, is Siva prior to his subjection to rnaya. He is active in the world of limited beings, but as a sort of invisible, effective presence. When Siva takes on the limitations of objective reality, Siva 'with parts' or composite, sakala, he acts through the faculties and sense organs.71 Notice that Siva in this case is not burdened by the ignorance of rnaya but is liberated while alive. However, the person who does not recognise his true nature and who continues to be dominated by the three stains, ends as a 'bonded animal' (pasu). He lives in a dualist world and is trapped by every limitation. Like the ox at the mill, he moves round in an endless cycle of activity which leads to nothing. He is under the control of other forces and greedily satisfies himself with food and drink, as noted in Qt.l00b.2.72 66. Abhinava studies karman at length in TA 9.88cd-144ab. 67. TA 15.28 ff.

Siva, who is AHAM, 'I am', unlimited, unsurpassable con­sciousness, has concealed himself by a sort of forgetfulness and takes on the stain of the limited self (anava-mala) becoming purusa, the individual person, which is numbered as category twenty-five. He then enters further into darkness by subjecting himself to the processes of intellect (buddhi). From this he derives an image of the self, the ego (ahamkara) which is category twenty-two.73 The ahamkara is a natural reduction, so to speak, of Siva's infinite AHAM but is not incompatible with AHAM. Indeed, when the whole cycle we are examining is complete, the ego will be reconciled with the 'I' just as all the categories will be brought into the har­mony of the person who is liberated while living and who is Siva. The term ahamkara is not to be confused with the term ahamyu, egoism or conceit. Such a person is attached to his self-image and will allow nothing to disturb it so that neither emanation nor reab-sorption can occur. The vibration ceases and reality remains frag­mented. The emanation of the categories reaches its final point where Siva becomes inert (jadi). In that state there is neither the sponta­neity of consciousness nor any expansiveness of heart, no subjec­tivity nor sense of the harmony of things but only fragmentation, lethargy and impotence. Inertia is the dominance of matter (prthvi) and the petering out of emanation.73b (d) As the Human Being The process of emanation is set out in the body itself. Starting from the tuft of hair and ending with the soles of the feet, the human person is a microcosm, a symbol of the whole. The harmonious complexity of reality or of the body with all its combinations and phases is symbolised by the wheel (cakra). This word has a variety of meanings: 'wheel', 'cycle', 'circle', 'vortex', 'radiation', 'group', 73. Abhinava links the two concepts, AHAM and ahamkara, in his derivation of ahamkara. The ego, ahamkara, is a product, kara, of the 'I am', AHAM.

The wheel involves other 'wheels', all arranged in a hierarchy. The principal circle (mukhya-cakra) is consciousness from which all comes or is identified with the sex organ since it too, like consciousness, is the source of bliss. On the principal circle the many sub-circles (anucakra) depend so that one circle leads to another in an harmonious system. The codes given in TA 29.37cd are of particular importance for understanding the circles in the body. Svacchandatantra 15 gives a large number of codes and their meaning75 none of which correspond to anything in TA 29. That being said, Svacchandatantra 15.24-31 gives the illuminating example of an Adept pointing to a particular part of the body, tuft of hair or skull or forehead or palate, and so indicating a category: sakti, bindu, isvara, rudra etc.76 In Jr. 195d.3, Jayaratha describes the ritual of the 'hand of Siva' which touches one or other of the circles of the initiate's body causing conviction in that place and making it the focus of his practice,77 and therefore of his level of power. By referring to one or other of these locations in his body, the yogi reveals both the initiatory experience he has received and the corresponding supernatural powers and rights that have been granted to him. The parts of the body are emanated in the followng way. Twelve finger-widths above the head is the 'end-of-twelve', the place beyond the visible body where consciousness rests.78 The term sikha which means tuft of hair, flame, subtle-breath, sakti, Siva himself79 etc. also symbolises the source of the emanation80 and the end point of the reabsorption, consciousness in its plenitude. 74.

The three principal channels (nadi)82 are ida on the left; pingala on the right; and the dominant susumna in the centre.83 From these come innumerable other channels by which the subtle-breath leaves and enters the practitioner and the guru enters the disciple. TA 29 and its investigation refer to other openings in the body. The upper kundali is to be distinguished from the lower kundali. The former is at the top of the head84 and is the 'pit-of-Brahma' as distinct from the lower Brahma at the generative organ. Viewed experientially, it is the kundalini in its raised state85 as distinct from kundalini in its dormant state in the 'bulb' (kanda) where it lies in repose. The eye-brow centre (bhru-madhya) is particularly associated with bindu and with the mind. It is the place where all the mani­festations of consciousness as well as all the operations of intelli­gence etc. have their starting and concluding point. To affect this point is to affect all the thought processes. The words rasmi, ara and marici in their ordinary sense mean a 'spark', a 'beam' or a 'ray'. They can also refer to the secondary divinities which emanate as rays of light from the principal divin­ity such as, for example, the twelve goddesses of the Krama or the eight goddesses Brahmi etc.,86 and can refer to levels of conscious­ness, gocara, bhucara etc. They often designate the faculties which proceed from consciousness like rays of light in order to make contact with their objects.87 Principal among these faculties are the three internal faculties (antah-karana), buddhi, ahamkara and 81.

The puryastaka, the 'eight', are traditionally listed as the three internal senses, buddhi, ahamkara, manah, and the five subtle elements (tanmatra).88 The sexual organ and sexual area is of special importance and is designated by a number of terms. It is called the 'bulb' which is not so much a part of the anatomy as a place of experience. For this reason there are different localisations of the 'bulb', (kanda).89 The male, but particularly the female organ, is called a lotus, since the flower has the property of expanding and contracting.90 It is also called 'root' (mula) in the sense of being the place of origin. The female sexual organ, called 'mouth of the yogin1 (yogini-vaktra), the Picu-mouth (picu-vaktra), the generative organ (janma-ddhdra) etc., symbolises the womb of the universe and is particularly associated with the visarga, H. The downward pointing triangle (tri-kona) which is reminiscent of the region in which the womb is located, also symbolises the emanation of the universe. Indeed, just as the sound seed (bija) in fact contains and emits the universe, so too the tri-kona of the woman conceives and gives birth to the universe. The symbol enacts what it represents. The feet and in particular the toe are intimately connected with the earth and with the last stage of emanation and for that very reason they also symbolise the starting point of reabsorption so that the Fire of Time, Kalagni, Kalanala, begins from that point.91 3. Reabsorption of the Absolute The process of emanation is reversed by the process of reabsorption and the one mirrors the other. There are a number of frameworks which are more often weighted in the direction of reabsorption. 88. Gnoli, Luce, p.606 footnote 7. Padoux, Le coeur, p.151 footnote 228. For these, see Appendix 1.

The pathway is usually understood as the means of arriving at consciousness but it must first be understood as an emanation from consciousness.92 The pathway is described93 as the way by which, in reverse direction so to speak, a person who is still caught in duality reaches the highest level. Rather than being a painful journey, for those who are enlightened the path­way is something to be enjoyed or 'devoured' (adyate) whence, Abhinava explains, comes the word adhvan. Throughout the Tantraloka 6-11,94 he develops a schema of the manifestation of the pathways which, following TA 6.34-36, can be set out in this fashion: A. Pathway of time (kala-adhva) based on subtle-breath (prana) 1. phonemes (varna) 2. mantra 3. pada95 B. Pathway of space (desa-adhva) based on bodily forms (murti) 4. kala 5. categories (tattva) 6. worlds (pura, bhuvana) The guru initiates his disciple into one or other of the pathways which are not exclusive of each other.

(b) Five Forms of Subtle-breath The subtle-breath (prana) is of first importance in the Tantraloka and is examined in great detail in both TA 5 and TA 6. The words prana or pranana refer to the subtle-breath, 'life' (jivana), before it has differentiated into the varieties of subtle-breath such as prana, apana etc.97 It is a vital energy, a spiritual energy particularly associated with the heart and indeed is assimilated to the energy of the cosmos.98 The term can refer to the first of the subtle-breaths, prana, or to all five: prana, apana, samana, udana, vyana. The prana, exhalation, is a movement towards externalisation. The apana starts from externality and is the beginning point towards internalisation and feeds the prana just as the waning moon feeds the sun.99 When these two movements are brought into harmony or balance with each other, there is an experience of samana. In this state, they are both restrained (nirodha) from their normal trajectory: prana from its tendency to externality and its ida channel; apana from its tendency to internality and its pingala channel. Then there is an experience of 'breath', which is the udana rising within its central channel, the susumna, towards the highest level of consciousness. This involves a devouring of limited subjectivity etc. and the attainment of supreme subjectivity, AHAM, where there is no limitation of any sort, no dualism in any sense. The AHAM is all inclusive, reigning over all. Abhinava connects the five stages of subtle-breath with the five levels of consciousness100 in the following schema: 96. TA 11.82cd-85ab.

(c) Seven Levels of Bliss The bliss of Siva and sakti, the relationship of cognition and recognition, may proceed through seven levels described in TA 5.43-52ab and is linked to the five forms of subtle-breath. They are set out schematically as follows: Bliss 1. nijananda 2. nirananda 3. parananda 4. brahmananda 5. mahananda 6. cidananda 1. jagadananda Place of repose subject (pramata), void (sunyata) objects of knowledge (prameya) all objects of knowledge union (samghatta) of all objects devouring of the means (mana) and objects of knowledge (meya) nothing is inert (jada) Breath prana apana samana udana vyana Image heart (hri) [sun] moon fire The first level of bliss is that of the supreme subject, AHAM, the personal bliss (nijananda) which belongs to Siva and sakti. Out of freedom the divine reality wishes to express itself in the great mandala of the world. It abandons, so to speak, the bliss it possesses eternally and begins the process of self-expression. This intermediate stage is called sunyata, emptiness, since bliss is found"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Parameters of the Tantraloka  59  neither in the subject nor yet in the object. It is rightly called 'non-bliss' (nirananda or a-nanda).101 Progressing further, the divine emanation manifests the world of objects and therein finds parananda, pleasure in the object. The objective world is limited by nature and so pleasure in a limited object comes to an end. This is the starting point of a return movement called 'the bliss of Brahma1 (brahmananda) since Brahma is the starting point of the movement toward consciousness. This process of returning to subjectivity, of seeing the object of knowledge and the means of knowledge as simply the result of one's own subjectivity, is the fifth form of bliss called mahananda. The sixth stage is called cidananda, the bliss of consciousness when the realisation of 'I' is predominant. The seventh form of bliss, jagadananda, is a total bliss, the unity of all the forms of bliss. Bliss is found in the world as in the self, since the self has been experienced in the world. To delight in the one is to delight in the other. (d) Four Aspects of the Krama Cycle Somewhat comparable to those seven stages of bliss are the four moments of the Krama cycle of emission and reabsorption. These are not different from the twelve stages of the Krama but are a different way of looking at them. The first is udyoga where consciousness emits the object. The second stage is avabhasa, the manifestation of reality. The third is the reabsorption, the relishing or savouring (carvana) of reality. The final stage is the dissolution when reality is reabsorbed in its every aspect into the rest (visranti) of subjectivity.102 For example, 101. TA 5.44cd states: 'since he rests on the void alone, he experiences an absence of bliss', sunyatamatravisranter niranandam vibhavayet║ In his investigation of that text, Jayaratha glosses as follows: 'absence-of-bliss (niranandam), moving out from own-bliss (nijat) which is experienced in the knowing subject, is particularised as [end-of-]ten.' It is slightly removed from the 'end-of-twelve' and is a state interme­diate between that based on the subject, nijananda, and that based on the object, parananda, and is the state connected with the means of knowledge. See Pandey, p.646. 102. Padoux, Vac, p.238 footnote 37.

The first three are grouped together since all three are transient.105 The other two stages, Fourth and Beyond-Fourth, are linked together because subjectivity, the 'I' (ahambhava), shines forth in them. In short, the wakened state is the world of multiplicity and division whereas the movement towards the deeper states of consciousness is a progression towards unity.106 The first three states are simply described. Wakefulness (jagrat) is the state 'wherein an object is perceived by the external senses and where there is an object of perception common to perceiving subjects. \"°7 Dreaming sleep (svapna): '... because it derives from a mental state alone, this emanation is not an object seen by other perceiving subjects.'108 103.

It does not come after the other three states but rather suffuses them.110 Thus, whereas the first three exclude each other, the Fourth can be found in each of them and, indeed, the aim of the Kula ritual is to attain the condition wherein the Fourth and especially the Beyond-Fourth are universally present. The Fourth (turya) is particularly associated with the dynamism of sakti and is a process of transforming all perception into consciousness.111 The fifth state of consciousness, Beyond-Fourth, is AHAM, Siva-sakti, eternal cognition and recognition. It is defined as '... that state ... in which the same principle of free-consciousness [svatantryatrnana] or self consciousness [ahambhavena], ... shines, in its full freedom ... and there is full consciousness of the presence of qualities of omnipresence and eternality etc. ...\" 112 Abhinava adds a sixth level: 'namely the 'unsurpassable' (anuttara) which is the state of self-existence.' 113 (f) Five Fields of Knowledge Vyomesvarl, also called Vyomavamesvari or Varnesvari, presides over four fields or lesser states of consciousness.

The set of eight when expressed in the direction of emanation are: 'the transmental' (unmana); 'association with mind' (samana); 'the pervasive' (vyapini); 'energy' (sakti); 'end-of-sound' (nadanta); 'sound' (nada); 'the obstructing' (nirodhini); 'half-moon' (ardhacandra). To these eight are added a set of four stages, making a total of twelve. These four, still in the direction of emanation are bindu, and, in the case of OM, the three phonemes M, U, A. The set of twelve are experienced in the direction of emanation or of reabsorption. While it will be described here in terms of emanation, the terminology sometimes makes more sense when described in terms of reabsorption. 12. The stage of unmana corresponds to the supreme word, the acknowledgement of the self (svatmavimarsa). 116 It is the pure word without any movement towards emanation and where any exteriority has ceased. It transcends all comprehension, as the word unmana, transcendental, suggests. 11. Stages 11, 10 and 9, i.e. samana, vyapini and sakti, are the bridge between the supreme word and sound and are some­times implied together as a trio117so as to form the 'sakti-spike' on which unmana is enthroned. In stage 11, samana, the word 115. Sanderson, 'Meaning', pp.69-70. 116. Silburn, Le Vijnana Bhairava, p.51. 117. Paratrimsikavivarana pp.228-229.

It is the first stage in a movement towards sound but it is a complete indetermination with re­gard to any particular sound or form of manifestation and due to its association with mind is called samana. In the direction of reabsorption it signifies the moment of indifference to any manifestation. 10. The word continues its process of manifestation. There is a first sense of particularity or variety but the word still pervades all equally and is called vyapini, permeation. In the direction of reabsorption it is the cessation of any will to emanate. 9. The word limits itself still further into energy (sakti) which is also called sparsa-vyapti118 or simply sparsa (Jr. 160b.2). It is a concentration of the inherent dynamism of the word and is a determination to express. In the direction of reabsorption it is the cessation of any determination. 8. The next two stages, nadanta and nada, are paired. Nadanta is the 'end of sound', the end of any sense of expressing. Con­versely, in the direction of emanation it could be called 'be­ginning of sound'. 7. Sound (nada) is the first condensation of the supreme word (paravac).119 It is the act of saying, the expressing without any indication of what is expressed. If nada is the statement, nadanta is the withdrawal of the statement. 6. Sound moves towards its self-expression. The command is being given. It still has a universality and has not yet been particularised. This sixth stage is called nirodha, obstruction, because the causal deities, whose nature is particularised and who hold sway over various particular groupings of cate­gories are prevented from entering this indeterminate stage.120 In the direction of reabsorption it is the end of any subject matter. 5. The 'half-moon' (ardhacandra) is understood in association with bindu. It is the beginning of the impulse to manifestation 118. Silburn, Le Vijnana Bhairava, p.50. 119.

It is a transition stage between the universal­ity of nirodha and the particularity of bindu. In terms of reab-sorption it is the cessation of impulse towards audible sound. 4. The bindu is the concentration of the audible sound. Since bindu is the concentrated mass of the expression it is more powerful than the audible sound. In the direction of reabsorp-tion it is the moment of silence wherein the audible sound has ceased but which contains all that was said. 3-2-1. At this point sound becomes audible. The last three stages should properly be considered in terms of reabsorption. In the case of the sacred sound OM they are constituted by the phonemes A, U, M. (h) Four Means to Reach the Highest State The last of the frameworks which structure reality and emphasise the process of reaching the highest state is arguably the most important since it is treated at the outset of the Tantraloka, in chapters 2-5. It consists of the 'four means' (upaya). The first 'means' is totally transcendent. Each of the other upaya in turn reflects one of the three external activities of Siva: will (iccha), knowledge (jnana) and action (kriya). Each also reflects one of the three levels of being: 'siva', 'sakti', and 'nam'. The latter in this list of three is an expression of the former but the practitioner need not proceed from one method to the next since each is a valid means to attaining Siva himself.121 The first method is, strictly speaking, a 'non-method' (anupaya, nirupaya) whose description in TA 2 is given mainly in apophatic terms. This method is both means and end at once since it is an immediate and total effectiveness. Abhinava gives the example of a person who hears one word of the guru (guruvacanam) and is there upon brought to realisation by an intense descent of energy and enjoys an absorption into Siva (samavesa) without other means of realisation.122 He is not bound by any other activities such as mantra, worship, meditation or discipline.123 The agency in the 'non-means' belongs entirely to Siva himself without any activity 121.

The 'non-method' does, however, have indirect methods (parikaratvam) as for example the 'oblation' (caru) which is mentioned in Jr.200d.2. The second means, 'the method of Sambhu' (sambhavopaya), is particularly associated with the will, with an attitude of mind and heart, a fundamental orientation. This method too is described largely in the negative, as the method of non-discursive thought (nirvikalpa).124 To put it in positive terms, undifferentiated or non-discursive thought is 'pure thought, direct perception (pratyaksa) of the ultimate reality'.125 Abhinava also excludes all ritual action from the sambhavopaya.126 The Kula ritual derives from the atti­tude involved in sambhavopaya and leads to it, but being ritual, is itself the 'fourth method'. It is concerned with the contemplation of AHAM.127 The third method, the 'method of sakti' (saktopaya), uses vikalpa128 which means differentiated thought, that sort of mental activity which opposes the various aspects of things and emphasises one thing to the exclusion of another. It questions, hesitates, it divides and is dualist in tendency.129 It is nevertheless a means since a valid reflection, even though differentiated as in the statements 'I am omniscient' or 'I am omnipotent', unifies all aspects of reality so that the non-duality of consciousness arises130 in a manner described according to the steps of the Krama tradition which is closely associated with the third means.131 Fourthly, 'the individual method' (anavopaya) uses kalpa which is action in a broad sense. 124.

Yes, but it is a question of the starting point. The absorption is not the result of rising, breath, concentrations etc. but is given directly by the guru during initiation. The ritual expresses and fortifies the absorption by means of various actions but is not the means of attaining it in the first place. (i) Three Attitudes Although the four means all lead to consciousness, Siva is not di­vorced from the world. The attainment of Siva is not simply a return to the previous condition but rather is a discovery of states such as universal bliss (jagadananda) and especially the 'attitude of Bhairava' (bhairavi-mudra) which is best understood in con­nection with two other attitudes, khecari-mudra and krama-mudra. Just as cognition is the basis of recognition, so too the person who attains (cari) the illimitation of space (kha) brings about the presence of many saktis. In khecari-mudra the practitioner attains the space of pure consciousness so that the goddesses arise before him. He enjoys them and secures all their powers'33 and has no need of other ritual obligations (niracara). This state is khecari-mudra. As the term krama suggests, the attitude called krama-mudra involves a progression from the emanation of the objective world through twelve stages to pure subjectivity. If khecari-mudra is absorption into the absolute, krama-mudra is a fluctuation134 in that it involves both emanation and reabsorption. 132. Malinivijayottaratantra 2.21. 133. TA 32.7cd-8ab.

However, once the structure is perceived, the chapter is seen to be admirably ar­ranged. Accordingly this overview will firstly present the struc­ture in broad outline and then take each section of the chapter, present its structure and describe the main terms and procedures operating in that section. The structure is also incorporated into the translation and is provided as a whole in Appendix 15. (a) Structure of Tantraloka 29 Abhinava himself provides the basic structure1 for the Tantraloka in TA 1.278-327ab where he gives the 'table of contents' (anukramanika) divided into two sections. In the first section, TA 1.278-284ab, he gives the list of the general topics (purvajoddesa) of the Tantraloka. Sloka 283cd reads: rahasyacarya mantraugho mandalam mudrikavidhih | 'the secret ceremony, the host of mantras, the mandala, the ritual concerning the mudra.' These four topics form an ensemble occupying chapters 29-32. The general topic of TA 29 is 'the secret ceremony' (rahasyacaryd). The general topic of TA 30 is the host of mantras (mantraugho) which, according to TA 30.123cd, includes both mantra and vidya etc. TA 31 studies the mandala and TA 32 studies the mudra. TA 29 touches on all these topics but in less detail. The second section, TA 1.284 1. The four categories, jnana, yoga, kriya, carya, i.e. knowledge, yoga, ritual and con­duct, are sometimes considered to form the tantric quadrilateral of themes, 'on which topic see Helene Brunner-Lachaux, 'Analyse du suprabhedagama'', in Journal Asiatique 155: 31-60, 1967 and Helene Brunner 'The four pada of saivagama', in Journal of Oriental Research (Madras) 56-62: 260-278, 1986-1992. The four cat­egories do not determine the structure of TA 29 nor, indeed, of the Tantraloka as a whole, as Rastogi notes in his Introduction, p. 195."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Tantraloka 29   69   bc-324ab, gives the list of Sub-topics (anujoddesa).

'2 A further elaboration of the structure is given in TA 29.7 where Abhinava lists six supports for the Kula sacrifice: 'on external reality, on the sakti and on the pair; on the body, on the course of the subtle-breath, on the mind', bahih saktau yamale ca deke prana-pathe matau | These will be called Sacrifice 1, Sacrifice 2 etc.3 2. adhikaryatmano bhedah siddhapatnlkulakramah || arcavidhirdautavidhi rahasyopanisatkramah || diksabhisekau bodhascetyekonatrimsa ahnike || For bodha Rastogi reads vedha. Rastogi, p. 184 footnote 3. 3. The various summaries of the Tantraloka give slightly different listings of these Sacrifices. Tantrasdra ch.22 summarises Tantraloka 29. It states: '[Kula sacrifice] is of six kinds: in external [surface], in the sakti, in one's own body, in the pair, in the subtle-breath and in consciousness', saca [kulayagah] sodha-bahye saktau svadehe yamale prane samvidi ca iti Tantrasdra p. 198 lines9-10. The Tantrasara mentions a seventh sacrifice: 'The seventh Kula sacrifice, the best of all, is celebrated with respect to the guru's body.' gurusarire saptamah kulayagah sarvottamah. Tantrasdra p.207 line 5. This seventh sacrifice is absent from TA 29 unless the second ritual of conclusion is classed as the seventh sacrifice. The Tantroccaya summarises the Tantraloka even further. In Tantroccaya ch.8 p. 177, the list of supports reads as follows: sthandile mandate svasaktigurudehacakraprandntaratmasu ... arcayet However, it is not clear how that list should be divided since the Tantroccaya de­scribes only the first three sacrifices: 'on the sacrificial surface, in the mandala, and in his sakti'. A translation which reconciles the three texts, the Tantraloka, the Tantrasara and the Tantroccaya, would read that list of supports as follows: 'He should make adoration with regard to the sacrificial surface, in respect of the mandala, of his own sakti, of the guru, of the circle of the body, of the subtle-breath and of the self (atma).' In Raniero Gnoli and Raffaele Torella, eds. 'The Tantroccaya of Abhinavagupta' in Indo-Sino-Tibetica, Roma, Bardi, 1990, on p. 177 footnote 166, the editors note that the text has mandate where one might expect yamale. However, the discrepancy is not so great if we consider that the word mandala can mean 'circle' and that the word 'circle' can also mean pair, yantala. The Tantravatadhanika is an even briefer summary of the Tantraloka but has no details on the rituals of TA 29."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"70   The Kula Ritual Most of the overall structure of TA 29 falls thus neatly into place. However, Sub-topic 2, TA 29.18-55, has a structure requiring closer examination. It is a development of the ritual of Malinivijayottar-atantra 11.3-16. A comparison of these two texts suggests the following sequential structure: Malinivijaya 11   TA 29 i. Introductory comments: 1-2 2cd-17 ii. Preliminary ritual 3-7 18-24 iii. External ritual  8-16 25-55 This sequence is elucidated by the following comments on each of those elements: (i) In TA 29.2cd, Sub-topic 2 is called 'the essence [of the Kula ritual procedure]' and is also the daily ritual. It is appropriate, there­fore, that the introductory comments should be attached to it in the first instance, but they apply also to all the Kula rituals which follow. (ii) In Jr. 17d.3, Jayaratha notes that the preceding verses, sl.2cd-17, constitute the setting for the sacrifice. He also notes that sl.18 is the beginning of the description of the Kula ritual. He notes later, in Jr.23d.3, that 'the sacrifice is complete' (siddhah kula-yagah). Sl. 18-23 would seem, therefore, to constitute a ritual which is, in a way, complete and separate. By contrast, in Jr.l9d.2, he refers to sl.18 ff. as 'the daily wor­ship' (nityad). He confirms this in Jr. 132d. 1 where he notes that sl.24-55, for the most part at least, constitute the daily ritual of the Kula ritual. Furthermore, the comparable section of Malinivija-yottaratantra 11.3-16 is reflected in TA 29.18-55. In Tantrasara p. 198 line 15, Abhinava begins the summary of TA 29.24-55. Irn-mediately afterwards, on p. 199 line 1, he changes the focus and describes TA 29.18-23. He only returns to his discussion of TA 29.24-55 on p.200 line 6. All this would bind 18-24 and 25-55 closely together. How then do 18-24 and 25-55 fit? The answer is to be found in the meaning of the term siddhah which is used in Jr.23d.3. In TA 29.5-6, Abhinava discussed the meaning of sacrifice (yaga)."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"Tantraloka29   71   In sl.5 he defined sacrifice as what is done 'as a result of seeing all things from that point of view', i.e. from the point of view of sl.4 or, as Jr.5d.l says,'... in terms of the outflow from the pulsation of Siva and sakti'. He went on, in sl.6, to state that: 'Whatever a hero performs with mind, word and body in order to evoke such a frame [of mind] is said to be the Kula sacrifice.' In Jr.23d.3, therefore, Jayaratha is pointing out that this outlook has been achieved by following the prescriptions of sl. 18-24 and that the Kula sacrifice has been performed. If the ritual does continue, it is not because something needs to be done in order for the practitioner to achieve the state mentioned in sl.6 but rather because he wishes to express that state. He does so in what may be called Sacrifice l. Sloka 24 describes the transition and could be counted either with sl. 18-24 or sl.25-55. Thus TA 29.18-55 constitute the daily ritual which consists of two parts, the first of which, sl. 18-23, achieves the state of bhairavi-mudra intended by the Kula ritual, while the second, sl.24-55, is the external expression of that state. (iii) The verses 25-55 correspond more clearly to what is called the 'Kula procedure concerning the Perfected Beings and their wives'. However, those verses differ distinctly from Malinivijayottaratantra 1 18-16 because of the long insertion of the Kula hierarchy found in sl.29c-45ab. Therefore, there would seem to be three parts to Sub-topic 2: namely Introduction, Opening Ritual and Sacrifice 1. That being said, the three parts are not sealed off from each other. In particular, Abhinava notes in the Tantrasara that the Opening Ritual and Sacrifice l stand in a special relation to each other. Firstly there is a movement from the external, i.e. the hall of sacrifice (sl. l 8a), to the state of Bhairava (sl.22d) and thence back to the external such as the cloth (sl.25a). The cloth provides the starting point for a return to the centre, for a throne upon which sakti and Bhairava (sl.49ab) will be seated. Next there is an externalisation as far as the placing of the 'lamps' (sl.55). Thus there is a double enclosure, a chiasm, A-B-A'-B'-A\", where the external, A, and consciousness,"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"7 2   The Kula Ritual B, enclose each other. It is an expression of the vibration (spanda).4 TA 29 is divided into two sections of unequal length. The first two thirds are devoted to the rituals for the initiated, the last third to the rituals of initiation. The two sections are closely linked since the rituals of the initiate cannot be performed without prior initiation while the ritual of initiation is performed by the guru after he has performed the rituals of the initiate. Accordingly, the overall structure of TA 29 is as follows: sl. lab General Topic The Secret Ceremony' (rahasyacarya) sl. lcd-2ab Sub-topic 1 'The Category 'qualified' (adhikaryatmano bhedah) Part I: The Rituals for the Initiated Sub-topic 2 The Kula lineage of the Perfected Beings and their wives, (siddhapatnlkulakramah) sl. 2cd-17  Introduction  sl. 18-23  The Opening Ritual sl. 24-55  Sacrifice |external (bahih) sl. 56-95 Sub-topic 3 The ritual of adoration (arcavidhir) Sacrifice 2 based on the sakti (saktau) sl.96-166ab Sub-topic 4 The ritual with the sexual part­ner (dautavidhi) Sacrifice 3 based on the pair (yamale) .

These three steps are relevant to the detailed structuring of the Sub-topics. For example, at the beginning of Sub-topic 3 he enunciates the Sub-topic (sl.56) and proceeds to define it (sl.57). He goes on to examine the three Cycles but first defines Cycle l (sl.58) and then examines it (sl.59-63). Another example: in sl.201ab he enunciates the initiation as Son and in sl.201cd-sl.202ab defines the ritual while in sl.202cd-206 he examines it. The systematic nature of this elaboration gives great clarity to his work and earns it the title of sastra. (b) General Topic 'The Secret Ceremony' From the outset Abhinava reserves the ritual to those who are. qualified (adhikari) and the first Sub-topic of TA 29 concerns 'the category 'qualified'' about which Abhinava says practically nothing. 5. 'Abhinavagupta bases himself on the three steps of knowledge in Nyaya, namely uddesa, 'enunciation', laksana 'definition', and pariksa, 'examination'. Bettina Baumer, 'Vac as samvada.

Baumer refers to Nyayasutra I 1.2."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"74   The Kula Ritual It is Jayaratha who defines the suitability, stating that a person is qualified if he 'dwell[s] in a state of undifferentiated (nirvikalpaka) thought',6 and so indicating that the Kula sacrifices pertain to the second of the means, the method of Sambhu (sambhavopaya). Abhinava gives a second quite different meaning to the term 'qualified' in connection with his description of the Kula hierarchy in TA 29.29cd-33 where he lists the six 'qualified' gurus and six 'non-qualified' gurus. The non-qualified have neither consorts nor lineages whilst the qualified do transmit their potency, their 'seed' (virya) which is to be understood in two senses. Jayaratha explains, in Jr.42d.l, that the transmission of 'seed' means the transfer of semen (carama-dhatos) and the transmission of the vibrating power (spharasya) of Siva and sakti from which the entire universe proceeds. For that reason, sl.34 lists the six saktis or consorts of the qualified and sl.35 refers to their lineage of disciples and grand-disciples. By contrast, those who are 'not functioning'7 or inactive do not hand on the Kula tradition in any sense: they are celibate and do not have disciples, they are not opposed to the tradition nor outside of it but remain 'at rest within the self, (sva-atma-matra-visranti) Jr.42d. 1.8 In short, the person is qualified to practise the ritual if he has the 'seed' or 'potency' (virya) of the Kula tradition. He is 'functioning' within the tradition if he communicates 'seed'. The term vira, 'hero' is thus appropriately used to describe the Kula practitioner. Because they are qualified they may practise the secret (rahasya) ritual. It is secret in a first sense because it is the hidden knowledge granted by a god at the request of his consort and then revealed to mankind in a tantra. However, the secrecy referred to in TA 29 is also societal. The Kula ritual had to be kept secret since its 'impure' practices involved grave social consequences for the practitioner and his whole extended family.9 Something of the social horror is expressed in Qt.l0d.l: 6. Jr.2b.l. He elaborates in Jr.l02d.6. 7. Gnoli translates the term adhikaro as 'functioning'. Gnoli, Luce, passim. Helene Brunner also translates it in that way in her article 'Un tantra du nord: le Netra Tantra', in Bulletin de l'Ecole Francaise d'Extreme-Orient 61: 125-197, 1974, p.154. 8. This phrase is used to refer to those who have reached the highest state. See Jr.24d. 1, Jr.79d.l and Jr.l85d.2. 9.

But what is the Kula ritual procedure? Was there a Kula ritual properly speaking or was it a trend which defies any categorisation? Until such time as the various Kula texts, the Ratnamala, the Yogasancara, the Virdvali etc., on which Abhinava draws are available, it will be difficult to know how far he has departed from his sources and what he means by 'The Kula Ritual'. As it is, he departs considerably from the Malinivijayottaratantra, the basic source text of the Tantraloka, in composing TA 29. Accordingly this present study analyses TA 29 without detailed reference to other works that contain the word kula or show similarities. Within the category 'qualified', Abhinava lists gurus and disciples. The term 'guru' is preferred to the terms 'Master' or 'Adept' who are minor figures in TA 29.

He bestows liberation, and enjoyments, he initiates and teaches, he performs rituals and receives the worship of Adepts, Sons and ordinary initiates. The word 'guru' is also used to refer to the Master and the Adept and to others who exercise a function. The Master and the Adept will be described later in looking at the rituals of consecration where Abhinava specifically names them. The yogi, jnani and karmi are named only by Jayaratha and may suitably be treated here in order to clarify the parameters of the word 'guru'. The terms yoga, niracara and sacara are also reviewed since they are used in our text and further describe the variety of persons who are qualified to perform the Kula ritual. The diverse personages are all outstripped by the guru who remains the person of choice. In TA 13.326cd-340, Abhinava discusses the different capabilities of the yogi and the knowledgeable person (jnani). In brief, the yogi is essentially concerned with enjoyment (bhoga) while the knowledgeable person is essentially concerned with liberation (moksa) and discriminating knowledge (vijnana). The guru par excellence has all these roles. Abhinava puts the matter very clearly: 'He who wishes both enjoyment and liberation and discriminating knowledge, should seek a guru who is well-practised (svabhyasta) in knowledge (jnaninam) and accomplished in yoga (yogasiddham). However, if such a person does not exist, he should seek [a guru] who is a knowledgeable person as regards discriminating knowledge and liberation; as regards a particular enjoyment, [he should seek out] a yogi who is able to grant that result. \"12 As the name implies, the yogi is concerned with yoga which Abhinava defines as the particular expression of ultimate reality. Consciousness shines forth in differentiated thoughts which in turn imply particular realities.13 Involvement with these limited realities 12. TA 13.338-339. 13. Tantrasara p.27 lines 5-9."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"Tantraloka 29   11   brings equally limited enjoyments which cannot simply by themselves lead to consciousness.14 That sort of yoga is to be distinguished from the yoga of Patanjali, discussed in TA 4.86-109ab under the heading 'the irrelevance of the limbs of yoga'. Abhinava notes that the eight limbs are of no direct use in attaining consciousness but rather the reverse: they are the manifestations of an already existing consciousness.15 The distinction between jnani and yogi is echoed in the distinction between niracara, the person who is not attached to any ritual, and sacara, the person who is so attached. When the sacara performs an initiation, an external manifestation or sign occurs which convinces the recipient that he, the recipient, has attained Siva. By contrast the niracara, who is also called 'independent' (avadhuta), does not have any particular ritual to perform and his initiation does not provide any proof other than the inner experience of self-evident consciousness.16 Abhinava describes the niracara: 'Free, not attached to any ritual (niracaro), without doubt (nihsariko),free of worldly concerns, pure (avadhuto), not attached to any ritual, reflecting that 7 am not' (na-aham-asmi), relying solely on the mantra, viewing all the goddesses who reside in his body... always seeing (pasyan) these things as the perceiving subject, he is clearly made perfect by means of khecari-mudra.'17 That description of the practitioner who is not attached to any ritual is further illustrated by those women who are called niracarah, who are not restricted by food laws or moral codes and so are to be worshipped as goddesses.18 14.

In TA 23.25a, Abhinava makes the blunt statement: 'The guru who is an officiant is without knowledge' (jhanahlno guruh karmi...).

The distinction (avantara) which does in fact exist between the [guru who is] an officiant (karmi) and the [guru who is] a knowledgeable person is secondary and always presupposes that knowledge.'20 In his commentary on the word sacara, 'he who follows a ritual', in TA 20.9c, Jayaratha similarly softens this classification and notes that the officiant, 'places emphasis on ritual' (kriyapradhana) so that it is a question not of exclusion but of emphasis. The officiant would seem to be particularly concerned with the proper performance of the ritual rather than with understanding and expounding his insight. Jayaratha emphasises this point of view in Jr.130b.l which is an investigation of the phrase in sl 129c, 'those who have not received enlightenment'. Abhinava goes on, in TA 23.25b-26ab, to note that once the officiant has passed on his qualification, he can no longer perform initiations without asking the permission of his successor whereas the knowledgeable person, even though he has passed on his qualification, can continue to function as before.21 19.

Initiation is of first importance because, by giving the mantra, it communicates the lineage and its power24 and this is more important than the theoretical doctrine or the mechanics of the ritual. Sub-topic 2 in large part follows: Malinivijayottaratantra 11.1-16 whereas Sub-topics 3-5 do not, but since Sub-topic 2 is the essence of the Kula ritual, the later topics are seen as an expression of the essence, a sort of gloss. Who are these Perfected Beings? The mantra is passed on to the disciple by his guru who in turn obtained it from his guru and so on back through the human stream, the symbolic figure of 64 generations of Masters25 who themselves obtained it from the stream of the Perfected Beings (siddha) who in their turn ultimately obtained the mantra from the divine stream. The Perfected Beings thus occupy a place midway between the gods and mankind. They enjoy supernatural powers (siddhi) and lead others to the same condition they enjoy.26 The term 'Perfected Being' has a wider scope. In Jr.29b. 1 Jayaratha mentions the 'eternal (anadi) Perfected Beings and the 'eternal yoginis' on the left hand side of the worshipper who are historical beings since they lived at Jalandhara yet are different from Khagendra etc. who are worshipped at the cardinal points. Jayaratha does not say what he means by 'eternal'. Finally there is 23. Brunner studies the phrase \"essence of the Veda\" found in the Kamikagama.

Abhinava defines the mantra to mean both the world and its supreme Lord, pure consciousness as well as discursive thought. It is the energy of the phonemes.29 As a result the mantras are able to bring a person to identity with himself and so to freedom and in turn to grant him authority and power.30 The ritual 'setting out' of the phonemes is an imitation of the emanative process - the varnaparamarsa - whereby the earlier phoneme contains and emits the later phoneme. Just as there is a progression in emanation or a hierarchy of tattvas, so too there is a hierarchy of deities and their mantras. The goddess presides over her vidya or mula-mantra which is her very substance and is surrounded by subsidiary goddesses who in turn preside over their own vidya. A mantra is received, individually and privately from the mouth of the guru during initiation. Indeed, initiation consists primarily in the communication of this word31 which is at the same time one's deity and one's personal mantra.

Ordinarily the mantra is received during the ceremony of initiation, such as the one described in sl.l87cd ff., but there it is not so much the guru who whispers it into the ear of the disciple. Rather, the guru by his silent concentration causes the goddess to make the disciple drop the flower upon the mandala and so to reveal which mantra, which goddess, which kula and its attendant ritual, have been chosen for the disciple. The guru discerns the kula and then, one may suppose, utters to the disciple the phonic form of the mantra so that the mantra is both visual and aural.35 Just as the mouth of the guru utters the mantra which leads to consciousness so too the 'mouth' of the yogini, the yogini-vaktra, yogini-mukha, yogini-vadana, communicates the unique experience of consciousness, immediately.36 Just as the guru considers the initiate to be his son, so too the yogini by her 'mouth' brings him into the family (kula) of the 'Mothers' or into the clan (gotra) or into the Kula tradition whose eponymous ancestor is Khagendra or Macchanda. The initiate proceeds to perform the various Kula rituals which, like so many others,37 are primarily concerned with the communication or awakening of the mantra.

Power rather than doctrinal consistency is the trump card and the mantras of the Kula tradition are supremely effective because, when understood as Kula and Akula united in an eternal embrace,40 they 'cause an immediate conviction'. The mantra leads to supernatural powers (siddhi) which are of central interest in Indian thought.41 They are found already in the Vedas,42 but the tantras are particularly interested in them. They include power over various dangerous forces, over women and over enemies43 or the control of mantras and mudras, the knowledge of events hidden in the past or in the future.44 In his commentary Paratrimsikavivarana45 Abhinava presents a lengthy interpretation of the various forms of supernatural powers pertaining to the Kula tradition but the supernatural power he mentions first and which comes first in his estimation is bliss.46 He does not deny the value of the siddhis such as smallness, lightness etc., or of lesser manifestations of the descent of energy 38. In TA 11.88, Abhinava contrasts the mantras of the Siddhanta and of the Left and Right schools etc. with the mantras of the Trika. Those mantras involve various stages of purification.

The greatest value is to become liberated while alive and to be able to communicate this state to all creatures and so to attain the state of Siva (sivata),48 the final purpose of the whole sweep of rituals of TA 29. The various worlds have their respective powers and the various parts of the body, heart, navel, eye-brow centre etc., have their respective powers just as one's kula determines the powers one may enjoy,49 but the aim is to progress rapidly through all levels so as to arrive at the highest level of consciousness which confers all powers. Thus, although the mantra can achieve all things, its greatest effectiveness is seen in bringing the practitioner to consciousness without the delay of ritual and so to enter the inner circle of initiates and gain access to all the lesser supernatural powers. The mantra is the basis for the term 'sacrifice' iyaga) which Abhinava defines essentially as knowledge and whatever is done in relation to that knowledge. In two sentences (sl.5-6) he both relativises all ritual action and ritualises all human activity50 so that the Kula sacrifice is universally applicable. The various rituals of TA 29 are the more limited and externalised forms of that essential sacrifice. This teaching is the equivalent of the instruction given in the Paratrimsika 18 and 20 which says that merely knowing SAUH is to be initiated and to know and perform all rituals. Since all proceeds from the union of Siva and sakti, towards what could Siva be hesitant? Knowledge which is clear and complete leaves no room for doubt (sanka).

The regulations of the Vedas and their proscriptions, the injunctions of the Manusmrti have no value in his eyes, for he is lead by a higher revelation. While the Vedas are not entirely rejected as revelation they are far superceded by the revelaton due to Siva who is essentially pure such that nothing makes him impure. So the practitioner ignores the multitude of doubts51 and rises above any fear. If, however, a person cannot free himself of doubt he is adjudged not yet to be initiated or able to perform the Kula ritual. At best he can become an ordinary initiate and eventually bringing himself to the state of readiness where he can accept the requirements of the Kula ritual without hesitation. The mantra and its outlook are the perfect sacrifice and whatever is done in order to attain that outlook is a Kula sacrifice. That being said, Abhinava goes on, in sl.7, to list six particular forms of activity or ritual which will assist the Kula practitioner to strengthen the universal sacrificial outlook. It is the radiation of the one splendour of the mantra. As already noted, these six forms provide one of the structural divisions of TA 29. Traditionally there are three categories of ritual: the daily or regular (nitya), the occasional (naimittika) and the optional (kamya).52 The regular or daily ritual must be performed at fixed times. According to Jayaratha, Sub-topic 2 is a daily ritual.53 The occasional ritual must be performed in certain eventualities,54 e.g. 51. In TA 13.198ab, Abhinava lists a number of doubts: concerning mantra, self, ele-ments, ingredients, food, rites, categories etc. ...' mantra-atma-bhuta-dravya-asa-divya-tattva-adi... This list is extended in Jayaratha's investigation, Tantraloka vol.5, p.2326 linel5 - p.2327 line 3. On the basis of those lists, Sanderson writes: 'As that which holds the Brahman back from the path of power it is fear of loss of identity (atma-sanka), or participation in non-Vedic rites (divya-karmasanka), of impure Tantric incantations (mantrasanka), fear of contact with the forbidden substances that are offered and consumed in Tantric worship (dravyasahka), fear of contamina­tion by untouchables in caste-promiscuous sexual rites (jatisanka), fear of enter­ing the cremation grounds and the other impure sites in which the cult of power is celebrated (sthana-sanka), fear of assault or possession by the forces that inhabit these sites and are handled in the Tantric liturgies (bhuta-sanka, sarirasanka) and finally, fear of an alien taxonomy of reality (tattvasanka) ...'

The 23 occasional rituals of TA 2855 are referred to in a general way in TA 29.29lc so that they must form part of the Kula ritual but Abhinava does not clearly state how they do so. Jayaratha refers to some of the occasional rites: no. 10, the posthumous rites, in Qt. l 3d. 15, Jr. 13d. 11; no. 11, a misfortune, in Qt.13d.14; and no.23, the reparation for an infringement of a rule, in Qt3d.ll, Qt.13d.12, Qt.13d.13. Finally, the optional rituals are performed for a purpose of one's choosing, e.g. to capture elephants or to secure a beautiful woman.56 TA 29.75cd-77 has aspects of an optional ritual as when Abhinava states:'... he should recite the 'The Hymn of the Sacred Site' in order to invoke good fortune'. Abhinava terminates this first part of the introduction by defining the term kaula. If kula refers to sakti and her manifestations, kaula refers to Kula and Akula and their manifestations all of which form the one reality. The kaula is knowledge in all its aspects, the knower, the knowing and the known. Sl.9 sums up the idealist position and provides the basis for the use of 'unclean' ingredients, for, if the kaula in fact constitutes the whole of reality, nothing is impure. The Veda distinguishes between the 'pure and 'impure' (suddhy-asuddhi) and is constantly concerned with purity. The Siddhanta 55. In TA 28.6-8, Abhinava lists twenty-three 'occasional' rituals. The translation which follows depends on Gnoli's rendition and on Gnoli, Luce, p.632 footnotes 1-11. The stoka numbers give the places in TA 28 etc. where these matters are dealt with to some extent.

Indeed, he makes use of what is reprehensible so that by being involved in sin - yet not in the manner of the 'bonded animal' - he realises the transcendence of consciousness. Far from involving a person in sin, the unlawful ingredient 'destroys great sins' (pataka) as noted in TA 29.282d. Yet the Kula ritual, although it decries the concepts 'permitted' and 'forbidden' (nisiddha) needs them and defines itself partly in terms of them so that it is counter-ritual rather than revolutionary. How can power derive from the act of transgression if there is no such thing as transgression.59 The concept of purification does, however, have its place but in a quite different sense. The process involves dissolving the lower categories into the higher ones, seeing the lower levels as contained in the higher levels, till one reaches the state of Siva,60 and then regenerating the body by expressing the higher categories in the lower ones. Purification consists in regenerating all as light. The rejection of the terms 'pure' and 'impure' is first expressed in the use of the forbidden ingredients and particularly in the use of wine which is described as ambrosia or nectar-of-the-left (vama-amrta). It is called 'left' (vama) not only because the left hand is to be used in the ritual but also because 'left' has the added sense of 'foreign to ordinary day life', 'secret',61 antinomian or heterodox.62 The word vama also has the meaning of 'vomiting' or 'emitting' so 57. TA 4.118cd-119ab reads: \"The idea that those things which in fact consist of Siva are separated from him: that is called impurity. Purity is the suppression of that idea.' See also TA 4.221. 58.

He further explains the overriding importance of wine by linking it with consciousness and with Bhairava. Liberation and enjoyment are appropriately discussed here before going on to look at the triple secret which consists of the 'vessel', the sacred place and the 'lamp'. Siva seeks neither enjoyment (bhukti) nor liberation (mukti) since they preexist in him and proceed from him. He does not seek what he already has. Although the word mukti is commonly translated as 'liberation', Abhinava gives the word a quite different thrust: 'The term moksa, liberation, is nothing else than the revelation of one's nature and one's nature is quite simply consciousness of the self '69 It comes from intuition and not, strictly speaking, from initiation since initiation does not give anything that is not already known but rather cuts the bonds which might hinder a person from self-recognition. Liberation can be obtained either without differentiated thought or within all the variety of the world70 so that liberation is not opposed to enjoyment. Indeed, the purpose of TA 29 is to show how the seeming dualism is overcome by becoming 'liberated-while-living' (jivan-muktah) a term which appears in sl. 161 cd-162ab and reappears in Jr.277b. 1.

Since the objective world is divided into three genders, each desires the other two in order to regain the primal unity. By contrast, the highest level of light, con­sciousness and bliss, expressed by wine, is that of the supreme subject, para-pramatr, Bhairava himself, who is beyond any limitation of gender. There is no basis for associating spirit, mead and rum with female, neuter and male in a sexual sense. 69. TA 1.156. In TA 13.164cd-195, Abhinava quotes the Nandi-sikhatantra at length.

In the Doctrine of Recognition, (Pratyabhijna) initiation, strictly speak­ing, does not, give liberation but only frees a person from the bonds which hinder it.

The name Siva means 'the Auspicious One', while the term Bhairava has the opposite meaning: 'awesome', 'fearsome'.72 The opposition is merely apparent since the grace of Siva is a destruction of every limitation, while to be torn away from the concepts 'pure' and 'impure' is a moment of blessing. In this sense the term bhairava is fittingly associated with wine, the forbidden drink, the deicide and brahmanicide.73 Indeed the word becomes synonymous with wine, as in Qt.l3d.8, or becomes synonymous with bliss, as in Qt.l3d.6. In TA 29 and its investigation, the term argha-patra, vessel, refers either to the container or more significantly to the contents. These are the 'fearless essences'74 which consist especially of the sexual fluid immersed in wine. In TA 15.164cd-167ab, Abhinava broaches the theme of kunda-golaka. He states that the gurus recommend '... the nectar (arnrtam) which comes from the union of the heroes and their counterpart [viz-their sexual partner]'.75 In his investigation of this text, Jayaratha clearly states that '... the nectar is the so-called sexual fluid (kunda-golaka) which arises during the perfect fusion of the [hero and the yogini],76 71.

The word aruna, which also means blood, can also refer to the female procreative sexual power, as in TA 29.195ab. The fluids derive from a 'sacred place'.

'The officiant, reciting mantras and sprinkling water in the same manner as previously, purifies the woman's yoni. With a blade of grass the officiant touches the yoni while reciting a Vedic mantra to make the womb fertile ... Then looking at the yoni he recites a mantra stating that the nectar flows. As a rule then the female sexual fluid (raja) should fall down itself (swatah raja pdta). But if it does not the officiant then engages in sexual intercourse (without ejaculating, information given orally).

Its uses are many, they cross refer and can be taken at various levels. In the first instance it refers to the trio consisting of earth, cloth and skull which themselves can be taken as referring to object of knowledge, means of knowledge and subject of knowledge. It can refer to the sexual organ, especially to the female sexual organ, or to the central axis, the susumna and also to consciousness, the knowing subject, to the source of emission, to the world, etc. It can bear this variety of meanings because any location where the divine glory becomes apparent is indeed a sacred place. The word dipa, 'lamp', can bear its ordinary sense but another meaning is suggested in TA 29.282a where Abhinava speaks of 'having cooked dlpaka'. Sanderson states80 that the dipa-caru was a lamp '... shaped out of dough with red wicks fuelled with clarified cow's butter ... intended as a substitute for the flesh of a human sacrifice ...to be eaten by the worshipper at the end of the cult.'81 As regards the wick, he goes on to refer to the Krama where \"... the wicks were to contain camphor, musk, aloe and olibanum mixed with the blood of a man or of an animal substitute and the lamps themselves were to be made from the flour of red rice kneaded with fermented liquor and mixed with ginger and pepper. Both red rice and ginger were substitutes for flesh.'82 All this suggests that the 'lamp' is more than just an ordinary ritual lamp.

The preparatory section involves a cleansing or regeneration of the practitioner followed by a preparation of the instruments, whatever these may be, and in particular a filling of the vessel. After these preparations the practitioner performs the most important part of the ritual which takes place in two stages. Firstly, he brings himself into the state of Bhairava and, secondly, sprinkles himself and the circles with droplets taken from the vessel. Some elements require a more extensive comment. The location of ritual is not public but private. Abhinava speaks of 'entering the hall of sacrifice' (yaga-okas) but this need not be elsewhere than in a house. It is filled with incense etc. but what counts is that 'the heart is filled with peace and is disposed to full absorption into Siva'. That is the true place of sacrifice.87 Even if performed with a partner or with disciples or in the context of a circle of worshippers, the ritual is private worship (atmarthapuja) and it contrasts with 'agamic', dualistic, ritual which usually involves the temple and public worship (pararthapuja).88 Although there is no calendar in the Kula ritual, there is considerable specification concerning direction. At least in this Opening Ritual, the practitioner faces north-east since north is the direction of liberation while east is the direction of enjoyment89 so that the Kula practitioner is liberated-while-living. In Jr.29b.3, Jayaratha adds a further detail. The personages who are worshipped are ranged on his left whatever his direction so that rather than the practitioner facing a particular direction, the direction is deter­mined by his own body. Like Siva, the divinised practitioner is the point from which all directions are measured. Just as there is no public place of sacrifice, there is no calendar of sacrifice. TA 28 attaches great importance to the 'junctures' (parvam) or feast days,90 whereas in the Kula ritual the calendar is 87.

This being said, the feast of TA 28 called the 'Ceremony of the Cord' is the occasion for obtaining the ingredients, especially the sexual fluid, to be used in the Kula daily ritual and other Kula rituals.91 These matters are best understood as the context for using the mantras which, at this first stage in the Opening Ritual, are explicitly named and of which the first is Malini the principal vidya of the Malinivijayottaratantra. It is a set of 50 Sanskrit phonemes in which vowels and consonants are mixed as a garland (mala). The first phoneme of the set is NA and the last is PHA whence the frequently used alternative name Nadiphanta. In TA 15.140c, Abhinava states that, instead of the long form of fifty phonemes, Malini may be used in the abbreviated form: NA-PHA HRIM. Although the origin of Malini is unknown,92 Abhinava states that there are many other arrangements of alphabets where vowels and consonants are mixed and he even names one of them, Kulaputtalika, without further elaboration. He goes on to affirm that Malini is the principal one of these arrangements.93 He also explains that this mixing, where vowels are the seed and consonants are the womb, produces the emission (visarga)94 so that the object predominates and Malini is primarily emanating, cooling, nourishing. This explains the predominance of Malini in TA 29 which is more concerned with union and emission in all its meanings than with the reabsorption which predominates in Matrsadbhava. 91. The Ceremony of the Cord is specifically mentioned in Qt.22b.l in connection with obtaining the sexual fluid and is described at length in TA 28.112-186ab. In TA 28.139cd-142ab he mentions great celebrations, feasting, dancing etc., at the con­clusion of which there must be a Circle Sacrifice. In Paratrimsikavivarana p.280 lines 28-29, Abhinava stresses the importance of taking part in the pavitraka cer­emony. It would seem that the ingredients were obtained at least on such an occa­sion and were kept for later use, perhaps in the form of pills as suggested by the word vidravya in Qt.l29b.3. 92.

It is called 'seed of the heart' (hrdaya-bija) 'seed of nectar' (amrta-bija). Paratrisika 10b calls it 'the heart of Bhairava himself while Paratrisika 35b calls it Rudrayarnala.95 It is also called trika which can cause confusion with the system called Trika'of which it is the crown. The phonemes of the mantra take their meaning from what has been said above concerning the forms of emanation. When Para is recited in the direction of reabsorption, S represents the objective world; AU the three energies of will, knowledge and action; H is the supreme brahman who emits the universe.96 From another point of view, S represents the first three cosmic spheres (anda): prthvi, prakrti and maya. The phoneme AU represents the fourth sphere of sakti, namely the three powers of action, will and knowledge or the deities Suddhavidya, Isvara and Sadasiva while H, consisting of two dots,:, represents Siva and sakti. Thus SAUH contains the whole of reality in every aspect.97 When Para is recited in the direction of emission, S symbolises Siva-as the highest brahman,98, AU retains its meaning as the three energies of will, knowledge and action, while H represents the emission. However, all this takes place within consciousness.99 While Para can be recited in the directions both of reabsorption and emission, the emitting aspect predominates, as reflected in Jr.21d.l.100 A different interpretation is available for Para.

The point is especially significant since Paratrisika 18 will point out that the knowledge of SAUH alone is sufficient to secure every supernatural power (siddhi), so just to consume the liquids is to attain the fullness of power. Although Parapara and Apara feature in TA 29 they are minor mantra-deities since the ritual is concerned above all with the subject.101 The third principal mantra to be examined in Matrsadbhava. Now, the first expression of the union (samghatta) of Siva and sakti is the energy of bliss (sakti-ananda) from which all is emitted.102 Abhinava gives103 a variety of names for bliss: 'goddess' (devi), 'essence' (sara), 'heart' (hrdaya), 'emission' (visarga). He also notes that, according to the Devyayamalatantra, she is called Kalakarsini, 'she who pulls time to herself. He also calls her Sri Para and notes that in the Malinivijayottaratantra she is called 'Matrsadbhava' which originally meant 'The Essence of the Mother Goddesses' but which Abhinava interprets to mean 'The Essence of (All) Agents of Cognition'.104 She is also called Kali.105 Her phonic form (vidya) is the one syllable KHPHREM106 which is also called Pindanatha or Pancapindanatha107 since it consists of one syllable comprising five phonemes. She also has a vidya of seventeen syllables, hrim mahacandayogesvari thr dhr thr phat phat phat phat phat, which is given in Qt.70b.2.108 These three great mantras of the Kula tradition are not only self-standing but are also inter-connected.

It is this power of dissolution that places Matrsadbhava at the apex. In second place, a mantra may be used by itself or combined with other mantras, as for example in the practice of enclosing (samputa) one mantra in another. On the analogy of a substance which is enclosed by two bowls, a mantra or the personage who embodies the mantra is further empowered when enclosed by the principal mantra which is its origin and end.112 The enclosing can be done in two ways. The principal mantra can be placed before and after the lesser mantra. Thus the mantra rudra-sakti is Malini enclosed either by Para or by Matrsadbhava and is explained in Jr.21d.l as a means of acquiring both liberation and enjoyment. Alternatively the principal mantra can be interspersed throughout the lesser mantra.113 This second method can be given a circular 109. See also Padoux, Vac, p.422 footnote 110.

In Tantrasara p. 135, he notes that even the dualist and impure mantras of the fol­lowers of Garuda and Visnu are made pure and capable of giving liberation when they are associated with Malini. 113.

Since the bliss of Siva and sakti stands at the beginning and end of the whole process of emanation and reabsorption, the cosmos is enfolded in bliss.115 So too, the universe and conscious­ness mutually enclose each other. 116 This notion is further extended to refer to Siva and sakti who are joined, as two bowls, to form a whole.117 The idea of enclosure, where the outlying element is dominant and the centre (madhya) is weak, must be distinguished from another idea of the centre where the central element transcends and governs the attendant realities. For example, when Abhinava refers to the central position of Siva in contrast to the surrounding four faces of Tatpurusa, Aghora, Sadyojata and Vamadeva, he states that '... to occupy the central position means to preside over all things...' 118 Again, when the prana and apana come to harmony, the udana rises in the central channel (madhya-nadi) and leads to consciousness. While, in Abhinava's recension, the principal mantras of the Kula ritual are Malini, Para and Matrsadbhava, another more basic mantra is found in the groan of love, HA-HA, which expresses in a more spontaneous fashion the experience of the bliss of consciousness. The word kuta means 'peak', or 'combination.119 and can also refer to a grouping of two consonants without their accompanying vowel.120 The most prominent of these is the combination of K and S to form KS, such that kuta becomes almost synonymous with KS, as in Jr.213d.L Its significance lies firstly in the fact that 114.

Thus KS symbolises the union of Siva and sakti and all the emanation arising from their union.121 Secondly, according to a certain reading of the alphabet, KSA is the last phoneme and so symbolises the starting point of reabsorption.122 In the Opening Ritual, the three great mantras are used as a form of bath (snana) the external sort of which is discounted in the Kula ritual.123 The internal bath is used in TA 29.l8cd-l9 and is performed with the mantra whereby the practitioner identifies himself with all the categories by placing the mantra upwards and downwards in the directions of reabsorption and emission.124 The third sort, the principal bath, which features in TA 29.22-23, is described as follows: '... after transforming, by means of contemplation, the ingredient of bliss within the hero's receptacle into Siva, he worships therein the circle of the mantra; then, by means of the same ingredient, he satiates the circle of goddesses in his body and his subtle-breath.

For the hero, however, these eight are replaced by '... the dust of the battlefield, hero's water [alcohol], the breeze of a crematory, the ashes of a hero, the air of a cremation ground, the moon and sun of a cremation ground, the self which is without differentiated thought.'

The act of installation unites the location and the located so that the place becomes the sacred site and acquires its character and its enjoyments. When, for example, the sacred site Attahasa, also a name for Siva, is installed on the tuft of hair, the tuft becomes consciousness. When the mantra Para is installed on the body in both an upwards and downwards direction, the body is reabsorbed and emitted as a pure body. The last preparatory action of the Opening Ritual is the filling of the vessel. All is contained in the mantra so that the filling of the vessel is an expression of the inner reality of the mantra which is the bliss of Siva and sakti. The practitioner fills the vessel with wine, meat and sexual fluid for they lead to bliss (ananda) and result from bliss and come simply to mean bliss. To come in contact with the contents of the vessel is to arrive at bliss and to sprinkle droplets from the chalice is to communicate that blessedness. Bliss refers in the first instance to the very highest reality, the union of Siva and sakti so that in TA 29.97c Abhinava states that 'Bliss is the supreme brahman'127 for it is the source of all other realities.128 The experience of their bliss produces various reactions such as the sexual fluid or the cry HA-HA which is the savouring of bliss, as in Qt.l60b.2. These experiences and expressions of bliss lead to each other in a constant cycle of vibration. Although the 3 M's are involved with bliss, the Kula practitioner is not dependent on them because he first discovers bliss within himself. Indeed, the use of the 3 M's is not so much a means to acquire the bliss of consciousness as an expression of the bliss which is already possessed. It is not the false bliss of 'bonded animals' which is based on delusion and the absence of consciousness and which the 'bonded animals' think they attain by 126.

The two forms of bliss, the bliss of consciousness and the 3 M's, presume each other. In that sense, to abstain from the 3 M's is to abstain from consciousness. After this preparation, the practitioner embarks on the sacrifice properly so called. He brings himself to the state of Bhairava by an internal act. Three inter-related internal acts may be considered here since they are the essential method of all the Kula sacrifices. The first of these to be considered is bhavana which basically means 'that which causes to be',129 but it is a complex word for it can mean 'realisation', 'creative visualisation', 'contemplation', 'identification' etc.130 Abhinava defines it as follows: 'The wise call this realisation 'the cow which fulfils all desires'. It brings into reality the object which existed only as a desire.'131 All preexists in consciousness and is externalised by a mental act. It is not make-believe or external manufacture but yogic projection, a gradual bringing into reality by means of repetition and is comparable to the act of impregnation or saturating.132 A reality which is glimpsed momentarily is brought into prominence by being dwelt upon and seen in every circumstance so that the fleeting reality is in fact seen to constitute the whole. The term recollection (smarana) is closely connected with bhavana. In the act of recollection the worshipper brings to mind the higher principle and reabsorbs the lower into it. It is a return to the heart, an act of integration whereby the object is brought into harmony with the supreme subject and so frees a person from ritual, or rather turns all into ritual. The aim of the worshipper is to attain the state whereby all his acts and words are done with recollection and so are turned into worship. Meditation (dhyana) is another major technique advanced in TA 29 and is defined as 'a continuum of uniform knowledge ...'133 129.

One of these is attentiveness (anusamdhir) 'to the whole nature [of consciousness]',135 a form of meditation emphasised in TA 29 since the Kula ritual is based on undifferentiated thought. Attentiveness takes place on the 'undivided level' (anavacchinna-pada) and there is no attempt to provide a visual meditation on some form of the goddess holding weapons, for example, because these things are created objects.136 He does allow meditation on a form of the formless, a sort of coagulation, murti, or projection from one's own self137 such as the square, circle, triangle and point etc. of the mandala or in slightly more imaginative forms of visualisation.138 Abhinava also makes use of satiation (tarpana) which refers in its primary meaning to the offering of food and drink to the ancestors and to the gods, a sort of libation.139 In the Trika it is given the wider sense of the reabsorption of the lower categories into the higher categories or of object of knowledge into the means of knowledge which itself is reabsorbed into the subject of knowledge. The satiation takes the form of either an external act or an internal act. When he performs the external act the practitioner projects his inner reality or identifies the outer object with the bliss symbolised by the droplets. He does this by sprinkling (proksa) droplets of wine etc. from the consecrated vessel. It is also performed by consuming food and drink, satisfying of the lower 'circles' so that the highest circle, consciousness, may become manifest. He may also, in a more internal fashion, perform the sprinkling with a mantra such as rudra-sakti. Again, it may be done simply by acknowledging the object with full consciousness 134.

Externalisation follows from the idea of sprinkling and is one of the principal themes of TA 29. By means of the Opening Ritual the practitioner has brought himself to the awareness of his state as Bhairava and so is now able to engage in Sacrifice since divinisation is a precondition for true worship, as in the phrases: 'Having become Siva he should worship Siva',141 'He who is not god may not worship god'.142 If he is Siva it is natural for him to express himself in Sacrifice 1, since Siva freely expresses himself in his five acts, not just emanation, preservation and reabsorp-tion but also in the two acts which emphasise the role of grace: his varied and multiple acts of concealment and revelation.143 The ritual is not performed in order to attain a state of liberation or enjoyment as though these were absent but is a manifestation of the real condition the practitioner has received through initiation and the mantra. He now wishes to show (didrksur, sl.24d) that the external world and the inner world coincide, to demonstrate the 'attitude of Bhairava' (bhairava-mudra). Yet in a sense the external sacrifice is also needed. In the Tantrasara, while discussing the relationship of external and internal, Abhinava notes that if the sacrifice were performed only interiorly there would be a lack of externality and therefore limitation144 and dualism.145 140.

Into this overall pattern taken from the Malinivijayottaratantra, Abhinava inserts what may be called the Kula hierarchy. Some of these elements require closer analysis. From the large range of supports available,147 Abhinava has selected those which suit the nature of the Kula ritual,namely the ground with its design (mandala), the cloth (pata) and the skull which is the vessel containing the fearsome ingredients. These constitute the sacred space appropriate to the external Sacrifice. The linga is not mentioned here in TA 29 as an instrument of sacrifice.148 The mandala and the skull require further comment. According to Jayaratha in Jr.27b. 1 and Jr.27b.2, the mandala of sl.26d refers to a dot or circle (sl.25c) or dot and circles (Qt.27b.l) drawn on the ground. On the cloth which is placed over the diagram on the ground, the practitioner sets out the Kula mandala consisting of a square, circle, triangle and point. Thus there are two mandala. The first mandala consisting of a dot or circle represents Siva and sakti and their act of emitting. The square of cloth is the conclusion of the emission and the starting point of the reabsorption enacted by the practitioner. The term mandala has many other meanings in TA 29. They draw on the basic meanings of 'circle or 'diagram': a group of goddesses, the union of a Perfected Being and a yogini, the structure of the body and its channels, the design of the triple trident, the faculties, a triangle, the coverings such as rnaya etc. The skull is a significant item for it is a reminder of the Kapalika background of the Kula tradition but its relatively minor role in the ritual shows how distant that background is. The skull is in fact called the 'sacred site of the body' (kaya-pitha) because it is deemed to be the seat on which the deity is enthroned.149 This 147. See TA 6.3, TA 2.42-43ab, TA 21.16-22ab and TA 27.44-46. 148. Nevertheless, the linga still remains a possibility. Tantrasara p. 198 line 15 - p. 199 line 1, which provides the setting for the Kula ritual and which is the equivalent passage to TA 29.14-16, reads as follows:'... the external reality consists of a sac­rificial surface, a hero's cup full of wine (ananda), a blood-red cloth or a linga etc. as mentioned above.' 149.

Insertion of the Kula Hierarchy The outer section of the mandala or the square of the cloth is the world of objectivity, in particular the history of the Kula tradition in its divine, Perfect and human streams. At first Abhinava follows the pattern given by Malinivijayottaratantra 11.8-16, but before leaving the outer square and following that text further into the centre he inserts the Kula hierarchy. After all, the essence of the Kula ritual consists in the worship of the Perfect Beings and their wives and it is appropriate to give more details on the lineages than are provided by the Malinivijayottaratantra. He does not indicate what other text, if any,151 he is following. The hierarchy may be first considered in order not to break the flow from the outer limit of the mandala to its central point. The hierarchy proceeds as follows: sl. 29cd-32ab a. The 4 Perfected Beings and wives sl. 32cd-33 b. The 6 qualified gurus sl. 34  i. Their saktis ii. The marks of the lineages sl. 35  a.

Paramarthasara, sl. 80. 151. TA 4.212-278 is Abhinava's commentary on his own paraphrase of Malinivijayottaratantra 18.74-81.

The arrangement is so neat that it seems fabricated rather than factual. Yet Abhinava goes on to give some historical plausibility noting, in TA 29.40, that those who make use of the gestures etc. when they travel to various sacred sites obtain whatever they want from the yoginis. The term 'Perfected Being' is particularly associated with the figure of the yogini who differs vastly in TA 29 from the type described in the section above dealing with the yogini cult. Yet these fantastic creatures provide the basis for the role of the yogini in TA 29 and its investigation.152 In particular, from her 'mouth' the yogini provides the sexual fluid, the awesome substance which destroys the ego. She is the sexual partner and grants supernatural powers of which the bliss of consciousness is the greatest and she gives birth to the yogini-child who is the receptacle of all knowledge, a Rudra. The domestication of the Kula ritual and its reinterpretation by Abhinava means that the female sexual partner is invested with all the imagery of another era. She has the essential role of the mythical yogini but not her outward appearance. Thus to be associated in sexual rites with the female partner is effectively to enter the cremation ground and to join the company of the Perfected Beings and their preferred partners, the yoginis. 152. Some of the characteristics listed by de Mallmann, Les enseignements, pp.169-182, are found in the yoginis of TA 29: 'they have superhuman powers': the yoginis grant powers to the hero of their own kula (sl.40d.); 'moving through the sky': they dwell in the sky where they receive those who deserve them (Qt.64d.l); 'preferring to dwell in cemeteries': they frequent cremation grounds (sl. 183b, sl.72b, Qt.72b.2, Jr.l85d.l); 'they can take on the shape of all sorts of animals': they devour flesh when unsatiated (Qt.13d.24); 'they compete for the attentions of the same man': they are lovers of men (Qt.129.1) and love certain rituals in particular, (s1.150d); 'they protect children': they are celestial beings who engen­der children in women of their own kula (Jr.46b.l) while the human female sexual partner who is identified with the yogini gives birth to a child who is yogini-bhuh (sl.163a)."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"Tantraloka 29   109   The bodiless gurus are intimately involved in handing on the tradition. Indeed they are the sky-travellers (khecari) who bring about the birth of the receptacles of Kula knowledge, among whom Jayaratha places Abhinava, and so ensure in their own way the transmission of the tradition. The bodiless gurus and their wives, for example Svabhava and Bhagavati, exist in an eternal union. However, they freely choose that there should be knowledge and then bring about the birth of the child such that the knowledge is now received in bodily form by human beings. The attendant yoginis witness and take part in the events at each stage, at conception, birth etc. until the yogini-child153 reaches full maturity at the age of twenty-seven.154 In this way there is a progression down every level of being from will to knowledge, then to action and so to the historical birth. In this way the hierarchy does full circle. Resumption of Sacrifice 1: After inserting the Kula hierarchy, Abhinava resumes in very general terms the pattern provided by Malinivijayottaratantra 11.10 ff. He moves out of the history of the Kula lineages and into the circle formed by the more subtle sets of alphabet deities, Malini and Matrka from whom all emanate and into whom all are reabsorbed as is indicated by the way in which they move between north-east and south-west.155 The goddesses are also mediators between the centre and the periphery, subject and object. The term matrka is originally associated with the mythological figures, the Seven Mothers or matrka who govern the universe 153. Gnoli, Luce, p.685 footnote 31. 154. The number twenty-seven has symbolic value in the Trika, being the result of the calculation 3x3x3. In Paratrimsikavivarana p.277 lines 1-3, Abhinava explains the derivation of the number. The three goddesses Para, Parapara, Apara are 'mul­tiplied' by the three activities of will, knowledge and activity and are 'multiplied' again by the three acts of emanation, maintenance and reabsorption.

Matrka and Malini are associated. In Matrka the subject predominates and therefore Matrka is absorptive, fiery, whereas in Malini emission predominates and therefore Malini is cooling. Abhinava identifies Malini with sakti and identifies Sabdarasi or Matrka with Siva159 but these alphabets do not exclude each other any more than Siva excludes sakti. Indeed, after having described the two alphabets Matrka and Malini, Abhinava goes on to say that even if Matrka does consist of Siva and Malini of sakti, both have the nature of Siva and sakti since both alphabets are complete.160 The pair, Matrka and Malini, form the circle which surrounds the triangle formed by the Trika deities Para, Parapara and Apara in their transcendent state.

The worshipper has now come to the point, the source and origin of all things whether in her single form or in its equivalent, her coupling with Kulesvara. At this point the nomenclature changes and Abhinava speaks of Bhairava and sakti but the same realities are intended. The practitioner contemplates the bliss of the divine pair which derives from their union (sanghatta) but, as Jayaratha points out in Jr.50d.2, the contemplation of the couple is equivalently the contemplation of the self full of consciousness and bliss. Reality is also a vibration such that the concluding moment of arrival at the centre is also the beginning of an emanation to the periphery. The worshipper acknowledges the light streaming from the centre in the form of a hierarchy of traditions all of which, in their lessening degrees, express consciousness and bliss. Firstly, the twelve goddesses of the Krama or an alternative set of twelve, as Jr.51d.l allows; the sixty-four Masters or tantras or deities of the Bhairava tradition; the four deities of the Right or Left traditions and then one's own tradition, all located within the triangle.161 The lotus petals which emanate in a circle from around the triangle are thrones for the eight goddesses who occupy an 161. In Jr.51d.2, Jayaratha introduces the set of eight goddesses by raising an objection which runs as follows. The traditional teaching states that the triangle contains an infinite number of rays which radiate from the single mass of consciousness and bliss. Why then specify the limited numbers twelve, sixty-four or four within the triangle, for any departure from traditional teaching will invalidate the ritual. Jayaratha admits the force of the objection and must, therefore, mitigate the sig­nificance of the numbers which he does by highlighting Abhinava's rhetorical ques­tion: 'What number do they [viz. other gurus] assign to the rays [of light]?' (sl.51d) and so concluding that the statement about the limited number of rays is just a concession to other gurus such as those of the Krama, the Left, the Right etc., while Abhinava's own teaching concerns the limited number outside the triangle, namely the two sets of eight.In another context, Jayaratha will give a different argument. TA 33, the synoptic chapter, lists many sets of rays, six, twenty-four, sixteen, thirty-four etc., and gives their names which are those of male and female divinities. He then notes that Abhinava understands these circles of divinities to be in fact unreal. Gnoli, Luce, p.758 footnote 16.

They are the intermediaries between consciousness and the world of objectivity.164 Again, the goddesses are temporal deities, each governing a specific day of the lunar fortnight165 and also have a directional significance as lokapala, protectors of the points of the compass. Thus, from these eight come the whole external world. Each goddess and her bhairava has an entourage (avarana) of eight Masters with their consorts, the propagators of the Bhairava scriptures,166 to a total of sixty-four, whose names are omitted but who were referred to within the triangle (sl.51b).167 162. Isvarapratyabhijnavimarsini, vol.3, p.226. In Tantrasara p.17 line 7, Abhinava also associates the number eight with the eight classes of phonemes and adds a ninth class, the single phoneme KS, as Gnoli notes in L'essenza, p. 112 footnote 2. Padoux also explains that such goddesses are the energies which preside over the eight classes of phonemes which in turn are the mother-energies of creation. He notes also that the lists vary between different texts. Padoux, Vac, p.51 and p.155 note 194. See Svacchandatantra, 1.34-36. 163.

In his investigation, Tantraloka vol.2, pp.39-44, Jayaratha lists the sixty-four bhairavatantras. These are set out in eight groups of eight and the discrepancies are noted in Rastogi, p.324. Mark Dyczkowski, The canon of saivagama and the Kubjika Tantra of the Western kaula tradition, Delhi, Motilal Banarsidass, 1989, p. 121 gives a slightly different list of the sixty-four tantras and names the teach­ers of each tantra. 167. At this point Jayaratha raises another objection. The essence of the Kula worship was stated in sl.2d to consist in the worship of the succession of the Perfected Beings. Why then is the listing of the Masters absent from the description of the mandala? To answer this point, Jayaratha first admits, in Jr.54d.3, that the 'sixty-four' refer to Masters and then refers to the endless number of Kula texts and their inconsistency in their lists of names and reinforces his argument by noting in Jr.54d.4 that a certain scripture even changes the number, admitting only fifty-six names. The actual numbers and names therefore, he argues in Jr.54d.5, are not important so that Abhinava is justified in not giving them."},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"Tantraloka 29   113   It is from these Masters and scriptures that the worshipper has received his vidya which now he worships, presumably on the square, by setting out 'lamps' considered as the outermost expression of the original bliss.

The Opening Ritual and especially Sacrifice 1 form the heart of the Kula ritual procedure so that the other Sacrifices flow from it. In displaying this essence, Abhinava has followed the pattern of Malinivijayottaratantra 11.3-16.

The first deals with the Krama cycle and is based on the Madhavakula which is the fourth section of the Tantrarajab-hattaraka. The second draws from the Yogasancara and deals more particularly with recitation. It also shows the influence of the Krama. Although the two sections are related they do not fit with complete ease. Abhinava follows his usual pattern and introduces the key elements of the ritual. Some of these require special comment. Sacrifice 2 is based 'on the sakti' (saktau) which has a wide reference but it does not refer to an actual woman. It is based on the 'internal sakti' which is, in the first instance, a recollection of outcaste women but is also any act of any faculty. In the Tantrasara Abhinava makes the point,168 firstly, that the preeminent and purest object of adoration in Sacrifice 2 is the union of heroes and saktis, but adds that the same adoration can be applied to the eye's act of looking, for example. In sl.96a by contrast, he 168.

One aspect particularly relevant to TA 29 is the legend that the sacred sites contain the relics of the dismembered Sati, consort of Siva. The sacred site is deemed to be the place where the goddess dwells in union with Bhairava.171 It should be possible to travel to these various sacred sites and there to acquire the powers of the goddess or yogini who dwells there.172 It is more convenient and equally 169. In TA 28.78cd-82ab, Abhinava lists the five types of Circle Sacrifice: 'solitary', 'paired', 'mixed', 'circle', 'intermixture of heroes'. Regarding the fourth type, he says: '[The sacrifice celebrated with] a potter's wife etc. (cakrinyadyas), i.e. per­formed with the respective saktis, will be described later. The Circle Sacrifice which takes place through their presence gives every result.' In his investigation of that text, Jayaratha explains the phrase 'potter's wife etc' by quoting TA 29.66 and explains the phrase 'later on' by naming TA 29. Later on in his gloss on the phrase 'but without regard to castes etc' (TA 29.101b) he also refers to TA 29.66. It transpires that both Sacrifice 2 and Sacrifice 3 are adaptations of the fourth Circle Sacrifice. The first adaptation, Sacrifice 2, is performed with an internal sakti and occurs by recollection only. Just as the worshipper recalls the twenty-four sacred sites, so too he recalls the saktis listed in sl.66. They are therefore internal or intentional rather than materially present. The second adaptation, Sacrifice 3, is a domestic and private equivalent performed with an external sakti, with an actual woman. By quoting TA 29.66 in his commentary on TA 28.79b, Jayaratha is only indicating what son of saktis are involved in the fourth Circle Sacrifice. They are not the wife nor the prized courtesan of the second and third forms of the Circle Sacrifice but are from the lowest ranks of society. Gnoli confirms the point, stat­ing that in the second sacrifice the sakti is contemplated whereas in the third there is sexual intercourse. Gnoli, L'essenza, p.280 footnote 2. 170.

The word pitha has another sense. It signifies the tradition expressed in the four elements: vidya, mantra, mudra and mandala.173 The goddess, specifically Kundalini, presides over this tradition and makes it produce its fruit, the oil or essence which is pleasing to consciousness. In Sacrifice 2, the term pitha more specifically focusses on the sexual dimension of the body so that the union of the sacred sites of the male practitioner, on the one hand, and of the group of nine impure women, on the other, symbolises the sexual union of the hero and the yogini or of the faculty and its object. It is performed by recollection and constitutes the sacred region (ksetra) or cremation ground.174 Or again, the heart is both the sacred region and the cremation ground because all is absorbed into the fire of consciousness and all proceeds from consciousness which is the heart. Like the term 'sacred region', the term 'cremation ground' (smasana) can refer to the union of the male and female practitioner or the faculty and its object. Section A of Sacrifice 2 follows the three major steps of the Krama process, i.e. the objects of knowledge, means of knowledge and subject of knowledge, each of which in turn follows the cycle of emanation, permanence, reabsorption and the 'nameless'. Cycle I is concerned with action (kalpa) and starts with the emanation of the objects of knowledge and leads to Sankarsini, the goddess of the Krama. Cycle II is concerned with knowledge (vikalpa) and Press, 1967, p.81. Almost all of these sanctuaries, dating from 9th - 11 cent.

The body of the male practitioner is transmuted in an orderly and harmonious way into the twenty-four sacred sites according to the order of emanation, starting from the tuft of hair and finishing with the foot. Likewise reabsorption starts from the toe so that reference to the Fire of Time (kalagni) gives a hint of the reverse process of reabsorption which forms the inclusion at the end of Sacrifice 2 (sl.92-95). This is done by recollection. The nine wives are carefully selected. Each of them is involved with the instruments of the Kula ritual, the twelve ingredients listed in Qt. 17d. 1 or the five 'jewels' listed in Qt.200b. 1 and the skull, so that the significance of the women lies not only in their adulterous"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"Tantraloka 29   117   character but also in the fact that they are ritually impure. Like the ingredients they allow the practitioner to transcend the concepts of pure and impure and so to reach supreme consciousness. Whereas the sacred sites are installed upon the practitioner and confer their power on him, these reprobate women, these goddesses, are enthroned on the sacred sites and sanctify them. Once the two sets of 'sacred sites' have been joined to form the 'sacred region', or once the male and female or the faculty and its object or any complementary sets have been joined, the return to the 'nameless' begins. As a result of their joining the 'wheel' begins to function. In sl.66-70ab, the word cakra is used in three separate images. The first image (sl.66-67, 70ab) views the nine wives as forming a circle around the worshipper who has become the god. Eight of them are placed on the practitioner just as the eight petals of the lotus are placed on the square of the mandala while the ninth, cakrini, occupies the centre as the most significant of them. Among its various meanings, the term cakrini can mean either the wife of the potterl75 or the wife of the oil-presser. Of these two possibilities, wife of the oil-maker or oil-presser applies best to sl.68 ff. The cakrini or cakriki sits on a seat which presses down on the sesamum seeds while the ox, moving round and round the trampled floor, turns the mill. The oil is thus extracted and is used for worship etc. but the husk is used as fodder. The second image (sl.68) is that of a wheel turning in the cycle of emission-dissolution wherein Cakrini/Kundalini plays the principal role. In 70b. l, Jayaratha sketches three forms of the activity of Kundalini / Cakrini. Firstly, with the emphasis on the cycle of emanation and reabsorption, Kundalini manifests the universe as far as objects such as blue etc. and then reabsorbs all back into consciousness. Secondly, by transforming the seed into prana she circulates through the body. She also produces the 175.

The emphasis here is on internal experience. Then, in a third paragraph, Jayaratha explains the image of the oil-presser (cakriki). The third image (sl.69) is that of radiation from a central point and of contraction back to that point. In the radiation there are three stages: l. the appearance of the 'circle' or the emanation and maintenance where Kundalini is dominant; 2. the middle of the 'circle' or the reabsorption, where Kulesvan or Kalakrntani is dominant; 3. the very end of the 'circle', the 'nameless', where Sankarsini is dominant 176 and transcends Kulesvan, the principal goddess of Sacrifice 1. In the Tantrasara, Abhinava changes the image and expresses the same in terms of the triangle. Where Kulesvan, in Sacrifice l, occupied the centre of the triangle formed by Para etc., in Sacrifice 2, Sankarsini is at the apex of the triangle.177 Cycle II: Means of Knowledge sl. 70cd-71ab 1.

Thus the goddess who presides over the means of knowledge is Kalakrntani: 'she who knows', jna. The object of knowledge had emanated from her so that she is described as 'after knowing', jnatva. The goddess who presides at the very end, from the point of view of pure subject, is Sankarsini. 177.

The emanation starts from the heart or 'cremation ground' and leads in two contrary directions, to two sacred sites, to the lower kundali and to the group of yoginis, the upper kundali. This is repeated in each of the eight directions so that the twenty-four sacred sites are used again, but in order to signify that the whole range of the means of knowledge and in particular the whole range of prana is being set out in every sense.178 The next step symbolises the second stage, maintenance, which is done by joining twenty-four 'lamps' to the mandala. Note that, according to Qt.73b.1 these are edible. At the same time Abhinava allows the practitioner to perform the ritual he may have obtained from a previous initiation and to make it effective by enclosing it in the ritual of Cycle II. From the comments in TA 29.75cd, Abhinava seems to have the tantric initiations of TA 15 ff. particularly in mind. The joining of the mandala and the lamps evokes the third stage, the elimination, of which there are two moments. The first act of elimination is to set aside the tantric instruments of sacrifice and is a moment of reabsorption when the practitioner acquires an unspecified supernatural power. He then focusses on Krsa, the fourth stage of Cycle II and consumes the hero's meal, the contents of the cup consisting of wine and sexual fluids etc. It is the moment of complete dissolution into subjectivity when all power is given to him and his mantras succeed without effort. 178. Many of these twenty-four are repeated in TA 15.83cd ff. which refers to Nisisamcaratantra. Their arrangement helps understand TA 29.70cd ff. In TA 15.84, Abhinava notes that 'the will of [Paramesvara] is the basis of the sacred sites' and that this will corresponds externally to Kamarupa. He goes on to note that two other sacred sites, Purnagiri and Uddiyana, develop out of Kamarupa, dvayam tatah, so that the central sacred site gives rise to two others. He goes on to review their arrangement. These sets of three are arranged in two ways. First of all there is a set of 3x3, then, more significantly to our purpose, there is a set of 3x8=24 located on the petals of the lotus of the heart, on the tips of the petals of the lotus and on the connecting points of the petals."},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"120  The Kula Ritual Cycle III Subject of Knowledge sl. 78 1.

They and the practitioner are without ritual (nirarcarah) and differentiated thought. This stage may be compared to the moment of paramarsa, creative awareness without any further emanation. Abhinava moves swiftly at this point and notes that there is neither time, nor place because everything is reabsorbed into what may be compared with vimarsa simple awareness, the state of pure consciousness where, at last, 'Paramesvara works vigorously, above all within the sacred place of his sakti' (sl.8 lcd).

The third step (sl. 92-95 ab) takes up again the twelve stages of the Krarna which are performed in the context of oblation into the fire. These various steps require some elaboration. The recitation is grouped into sets. The items listed in the sets of 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 are set out below in a table which relies heavily on Jayaratha's interpretation of the words and symbols. 5 face heart 'thread' breath Saiva couple; 6 mouth eyes heart 'thread' breath Siva+Sakti; 7 mouth eyes ears -heart breath union of Siva+sakti; 8 mouth eyes navel heart breath; pit-of-Brahma; private place + aperture of Ka; 9 mouth eyes ears breasts hands feet breath; pit-of-Brahma; private place+ end-of-twelve; It becomes immediately apparent that the more numerous the sets of repetitions the more externalised is the focus of the recitation. Conversely, the less the number the more internalised"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"122  The Kula Ritual is the focus. This accords with the comment made in Jr.89d.2 to the effect that the more competent the yogi the fewer repetitions does he need to make. Subtle-breath is the source of time which is a veil over consciousness179 so that the reduction of the number of recitations and the stilling of the subtle-breath allow consciousness to appear. Although the term hamsa in fact refers to the goose which floats on the waves but dives its head under the water and in this sense has symbolic value, the term has many other meanings as well. Ham symbolises exhalation (prana), while sa symbolises inhalation (apana)180 so that hamsa is uttered twenty-four hours every day.181 The connection of exhalation and inhalation with prana and apana ties hamsa to the various meanings of those two forms of subtle-breath. Thus hamsa is the cycle of emanation and reabsorption182 as well as the whole range of phonemes and since emanation and reabsorption involve all reality, hamsa contains all reality.183 However, both emanation and reabsorption are themselves the work of Siva-sakti with the result that hamsa is also the heart (Jr.88d.l), the supreme self in perfect union with reality.184 Finally, the word hamsa can be divided into HA 179. In Tantrasara p.60 lines 4-6, Abhinava says: 'When the acts of breathing disap­pear, when time is devoured, complete, truly single consciousness shines in all its splendour.' In the Tantrasara, time, the number of arisings of subtle-breath and the number of phonemes in the mantra are linked. Similarly, in TA 7.39cd ff., Abhinava gives explicit details about the number of breaths and the number of recitations. 180. Gnoli, L'essenza, p.134 footnote 1.

It can start from the lowest and lead to the highest and in this sense is closely allied to the term uccara, 'arousing'. This word has several meanings including the 'subtle-breath' which rises as udana 186 and moves from the base to the highest place, from the location of the dormant sakti, to the place where sakti and Siva unite, at the end-of-twelve. This uccara is also identified with sound which proceeds upwards in the direction of reabsorption, moving through the twelve or eight stages of sound to reach the supreme personal word. Since all aspects of the practitioner are associated with the subtle-breath, he too, in his body as in all his faculties, is reabsorbed and all becomes purely personal, subjective. The arousing is therefore the reabsorption into the personal so that the practitioner becomes the supreme person, 'I', AHAM. The various aspects are in fact the one event, the uccara, which occurs spontaneously under the inspiration of sakti who is the freedom of Siva.187 The practitioner once again goes through the twelve stages of the Krama process, gradually withdrawing from the external world of sound. At first he recites out loud, then he murmurs and so on, withdrawing progressively from sound till he reaches the last two moments which are in fact one autonomous consciousness. This is the real oblation into the fire, of which all other forms are mere echoes.188 Is there also an exterior fire? The answer is uncertain. The bald statement that 'he both makes oblation and performs the recitation' (sl.92d) seems to imply a real oblation into a real fire.189 Jayaratha's separation of the two in Jr.95d.2 further suggests an objective distinction. 185.

Note that Gnoli adds sections from TA 29 to his translation of the Tantrasara. The impor­tance of Sacrifice 3 is further emphasised by its handling in Tantroccaya ch.8 where, after naming the six or seven sacrifices of the Kula ritual, Abhinava passes very quickly over Sacrifices 1 and 2, and does not treat of Sacrifices 4,5 and 6, but devotes about one third of the chapter to Sacrifice 3, again quoting from and alluding extensively to TA 29.

Various terms, especially the Circle Sacrifice and the sakti require clarification. He defines the word brahmacarya by describing brahman as the bliss that belongs to Siva and sakti in their union. He goes on to interpret bliss as wine, meat and especially the sexual fluid emitted during intercourse, since these lead to bliss and result from bliss.192 The words 'bliss' and 'brahman' have, therefore, a double connotation and can refer to the inner experience as well as to the fluid which results from it.193 The word brahman is interchangeable with the word parabrahman. Therefore, the true brahmacarya is not celibate,which is the usual meaning of the word,194 nor is he Preliminary rites: 1. The Adept procures a woman who is wanton. 2. He places her in the mandala and 3. offers her a narcotic drink. 4. He places her on his left thigh and 5. honours her yoni which is to be unshaven. 6. He anoints the yoni with sandal paste to look like flower or menses, puspam. 7. He gives her wine to drink. 8. He paints a 'half-moon', ardhacandra, on her forehead with vermilion. 9. He places his hands on her breasts and mutters the bhagabija [which Schoterman identifies with the mayabija HRIM]. 10. He kisses her on the cheeks and moulds her breasts. 11. He recites the mantra or a stotra. 12. The sakti anoints the linga with sandal paste and saffron Central ritual: 1. The Adept conducts the ritual coition. 2. \"The object of ... this ritual coition is the production of the fluid called Tattva Uttama ... or Yonitattva.' Concluding Rite: 1. The Adept pays his respects to the yonimandala and to the guru. 2. He utters some final lines expressing that he has accomplished his purpose and has been saved from samsara.Schoterman notes, opcit. pp.28-29, that the point of the ritual is to secure the yonitattva which has two applications: a. The Adept uses it to form his tilaka in his daily ritual. b. He uses it to worship the sakti in three stages. Firstly he worships the yoni with water used for cleansing the yoni and the linga. Secondly, he offers the vessel containing the yonitattva to the sakti. This is then di­vided into three parts of which the Adept presents one part to the sakti while he himself drinks the other two parts mixed with wine. 192. In Anuttarastika 4 line 1, Abhinava weakens the identification: '[This] bliss [which comes from the Unsurpassable (anuttara)] is not like the intoxication which comes from wealth or wine nor even like the bliss that comes from joining with the Be­loved (anga).' 193. This double meaning dominates the two quotes Qt.l00b.3, Qt.l00b.4 which in turn very adequately describe the meaning of 'the 'bliss of brahman'. 194.

Abhinava goes on to contrast the brahmacarya with the 'bonded animal' (pasu) whom he defines (TA 29.99) as someone who either does not use any of the 3 M's or who may indeed use the 3 M's outside of the ritual but refuses them during the ritual. Jayaratha explicates these points. Two types of person are envisaged. Some do not consume the three M's at any stage, either during the ritual or in ordinary life. They totally abstain in accordance with the recommendation given in the Manusmrti which is quoted in Qt.98d.1.196 Far from being truly free they are no more than 'bonded animals', like oxen who do not feed on wine or meat. Others do consume the three M's in ordinary life but do not share it in the sacred setting.197 They are 'bonded animals' in a moral sense or, as Qt.l00b.2 says, are 'like dullards'. Abhinava is flexible. It may be that someone who does not make use of the 3 M's finds his way into the ritual. Is he a complete outsider, uninitiated, someone who has strayed into the meeting?198 Should that be the case, Abhinava holds that he is usually not to be ejected from the meeting. In TA 28.20cd ff., he makes a comparison. Just as the late-comer to a spectacle can become quickly involved because of the infectious enthusiasm of the other spectators who have been only gradually involved, so too someone who joins a meeting of the yoginis and the siddhas may suddenly arrive at consciousness. Jayaratha gives an important complement to those basic points. The true Kula practitioner is already possessed of bliss for he has experienced absorption during the course of his initiation. He performs the ritual, as Jayaratha notes in Jr.l00b.3, 'for the reason 195. The pancamakara, the five M's, are wine; madya; meat, mamsa; fish, matsya; parched grain, mudra; and intercourse, maithuna. In TA 29, there is no reference to the five M's but in TA 28, in the description of the Circle Sacrifice, fish is mentioned. 1%. This group is described in sl.99ab, Jr.100b.l and Qt. 100b.l. 197.

He makes ritual use of the 3 M's in order to manifest an interior bliss just as in sl. 24 the practitioner who is Bhairava wishes to manifest his true nature by performing the external ritual of Sacrifice l. This contrasts with the person who has not experienced bliss by the grace of Siva but wishes to attain it by the inappropriate and ineffective use of the 3 M's: 'Without a guru, without a deity, like dullards ... forever consuming wine and meat...\" Qt.l00b.2.

Its preferred participants are the knowledgeable person (jhani) or the yogi since they will perform the ritual in the fullest fashion but the ordinary initiates and outsiders should be avoided. The guru should be knowledge­able.201 The Circle Sacrifice or Image Sacrifice should be celebrated on the following occasions: 'On the occasion of the Ceremony of the Cord, of the rite performed after death, on the days of juncture (parvan), at the eclipses of the sun and moon etc., even at the ordinary junctures, on the occasion of a feast [e.g. celebrating, the guru's birth etc., notes Jayaratha], of a marriage, of the ritual sacrifice and initiation of Brahmans, at the . installation [of a temple, a linga], on the day that the rules are abrogated, and finally in order to bring about one's special desires: [on these occasions] the Image Sacrifice should be per-formed.

'Solitary': a sacrifice in which gurus alone take part. 2. 'Mixed': a sacrifice performed with the Adepts etc. and their wives. 3. 'Paired' is of two kinds, according as wives or prized court­esans take part. 4. \"Circle' is celebrated with a potter's wife etc. It gives every result, i.e. both liberation and enjoyment. 5. 'Intermixture of heroes': the sacrifice is performed with all of the above.204 The fourth of these lies behind Sacrifices 2 and 3. It is not clear how the participants of these sacrifices are arranged. Comparing TA 28.82cd-84 and Tantrasara pp.l84-l85, it would seem that there are three concentric circles. The first is constituted by the gurus, i.e. the Masters and Adepts and the second comprises the tattvavit, i.e. the Sons, while the third involves the ordinary initiates, even though Abhinava prefers only the knowledgeable person and the yogi. The matter is not clear but that arrangement would seem to concur with the description of the group given in TA 29.282 ff. and its investigation. The various-circles of participants are satiated with the contents of the vessel, one after the other, starting from the guru and extending as far as the outermost circle and then returning back to the guru, in imitation of the cycle of emission and reabsorption.205 First the heroes are worshipped and then their saktis (sl.92a). This constitutes one 'complete cycie'.206 Next, the celebrant distributes food such as meat, fish etc. (mamsamatsyadi, sl. 92d). 203. TA 28.79ab. 204. TA 28.79cd-82ab. 205.

What if there is no vessel? What if drops fall to the ground? What if someone enters who has no right to be there? The answer to this last is that if, through lack of due precaution, someone does enter the circle, one should not question him.207 In sl.99-101ab, he concludes the description of the ceremony by mentioning the remuneration (daksina) consisting of money, betel nut, cloth etc. In sl.l04cd-106ab, Abhinava gives further details. The heroes and the yoginis are to meet at night in a secret house (gupte grhe, sl. 104a) addressing each other with a secret, unconventional language (asamketa, sl. 105a). Later, in sl. 373cd-385ab, Abhinava resumes the subject of the Circle Sacrifice, and discusses the theatrical aspect of the gathering. That is, just as during a performance of dance or song, the various spectators are caught up in the spectacle as a group and not as separate individuals, so too during the sacrifice consciousness arises in each person as part of a community. For this reason, if someone whose 'consciousness is in a state of contraction'208 does enter the group, the cerejnony should continue since he may be caught up in the experience of the group (il.381cd-383ab). If the person will certainly not become involved, the ceremony should be interr­upted.209 Abhinava goes on to define the external sakti or sexual partner (duti).210 The phrase 'she is 'caused', 'cause' and 'co caused' ' (sl. 102a) and indeed the whole of sl. 10lcd-102 and the investigation which follows it, have caused great difficulty. (a) One kind of interpretation is literal. Pandey states that the duti '...could be mother, sister, daughter, grand-mother, sister's daughter or daughter's daughter'211 with which Masson and 207. TA28.98d. 208. TA 29.380ab. 209. TA 28.384cd-385ab. 210. In TA 1.13, Abhinava gives tribute to his guru Sambhunatha and to his guru's consort who is referred to by the epithet bhagavati.

A second interpretation is echoed in Hevajra Tantra 11.5.58-59 which interprets the words as codes217 concerning which the Yogaratnamala gives the clues, stating for instance that 'Mother' refers to the Master's consort or that 'Daughter' refers to the Master's female disciple.218 Thirdly, Silburn holds that the phrase must be understood in a spiritual sense only so that the 'mother' is the duti who inspires the partner; the 'daughter' is the duti who is inspired by the partner; the 'sister' is the duti who is equal to the partner: they inspire each other.219 (b) Another possible interpretation leads to the conclusion that the phrase in question refers to one woman in her various capa­cities.220 212.

The texts which are particularly important in this present matter, TA 28.194-195, TA 29.101 -102,123 and Jr. 102d. 1, contain a number of words which revolve around basically similar concepts and can be put into two tables. 28.194 womb yoni knowledge vidya 28.195 ego ahanta consciousness bodha, 29.101 worldly laukika non-worldly alaukika 29.102 perceptibly saksat indirectly parampara 29.123 being bhava meditated upon bhavitam Jr.l02d.l from womb yaunad from knowledge jnaniyac"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"Tantraloka29   131   (i) In TA 28.194 ff., Abhinava describes the guru and his family - wife, brother, sons etc. These are assembled as a group but the basis of their grouping is not so much the womb (yoni) or the family bond as knowledge (vidya), not so much their blood connection as their common tradition. They form a sort of dualistic association of 'worldly' and 'unworldly', terms which refer to family and knowledge. In TA 28.195, he goes on to justify the statement given in sl. 194 by contrasting the ahanta, the ego-identity, which is connected to the body, with the ahambhava, the 'I' which is consciousness (bodha). Since consciousness is greater than the body, vidya is a stronger bond than the family tie. For that reason, the disciple who shares the consciousness of the guru is truly of his line (santana, sl. 197c). He then explains that the guru passes on his knowledge to his disciples by the fact that his consciousness enters into the very self [of the disciple]22' and communicates its particular characteristic.222 The guru does this in the same way that a yogi can enter into another person's body without leaving his own.223 In this process of making the disciple a member of the family, there is the 'cause', the 'assistant cause' and the 'co-caused' (karanam sahakari ca\\ eka-karana-karyam ca).224 The 'cause' and the 'assistant cause', are the guru and his wife.225 The fellow disciples are called 'brothers'226 while a person who is associated with the disciple 'is also considered to form part, indirectly (paramparayo-gad), of the guru's family.'227 Thus the terms, 'cause', 'assistant cause' and 'brothers', are concerned with initiation into the guru's wider 'family' which consists not of blood relations but of people with the same vidya, 221.

In TA 28.210a, Abhinava emphasises the point by stating that nor­mally the guru is without qualification for this sacrifice if he is without a sakti (nihsaktikasya). 226. TA 28.211c. 227.

(ii) In TA 29. 123cd, Abhinava quotes the saying of Kallata: '[The guru] should ritually prepare (bhavitam) [the sakti] because by her very being (sva-bhava) she is superior to his own body.' In Jr.l24b.l, Jayaratha notes that this sentence sums up the definition of the sakti which started in sl.100. The sakti is female by her very nature (sva-bhava) and for that reason she is ritually prepared (bhavitam). As female she is the source of the kundagolaka and is therefore ritually prepared in a ceremony noted in TA 29.123ab and in Jr.l24b.l which tells us that 'the guru should ritually prepare the sakti, i.e. should purify her' (samskrtam). Already in TA 15.577, Abhinava has given the rule that 'one must 'avoid the woman who is not purified' (nasamskrtam vrajet). '[Her lack of purification] would render useless the fluid which comes from her.' The sakti affects the practitioner by providing the sexual fluid and bringing him to consciousness and so she is the 'cause'. Her act is in keeping with the Kula tradition in which the daughter of Tryambaka communicates the knowledge. On the other hand she is 'ritualy prepared' (bhavitam) so that she is both 'cause' and 'caused'. She affects the practitioner and is affected by him so that they are both 'co-caused'. Someone may come to the ritual who has not been initiated just as someone might be brought to a spectacle by a friend. He comes as an associate of one of the disciples and so he is considered indirectly (paramparayogad) to form part of the group. He is not directly involved with the sakti but nevertheless she has an effect on him. His presence is a tacit approval or ritual preparation of her so that he too is both 'caused' by her and 'causes her' and they are both 'co-caused'. In short, according to this interpretation the one sakti, the one woman, has the six qualities listed in TA 29.101cd-102. The guru of TA 28 has a 'worldly', a sexual or physical, relationship with his family whereas the relationship with his disciple is 'unworldly' only,"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"Tantraloka29   133   based on consciousness. The sakti of TA 29, however, has a relationship with her male partner based both on sexuality and on consciousness and so she is superior to the male guru. (c) How then should one understand Qt.l02d.2 which reads: \"One's wife, sister, mother or daughter can be the beautiful mistress\". This quotation can be understood to mean either: '[The same man can have] either his wife, sister, mother or daughter as his beautiful mistress' or: 'The wife, sister, mother or daughter can function as a beautiful mistress [in the Kula ritual but not necessarily to the same man].' In other words, the meaning of the quotation is not clear. Next, the question must be asked: does the quote actually refer to the three categories, 'caused', 'cause' and 'co-caused'? In fact Jayaratha's discussion on sl. 10lcd-102 finished in Jr.l02d.2 with a comment on the word tulya, 'like that' so that the quotation should rather be understood to introduce a new issue which is elaborated over the following interventions and quotations,228 namely: why is one's own wife excluded from this ritual? That question concerning the wife is best viewed in the context of the five Circle Sacrifices. The second of these is performed with 'the Adepts etc. and their wives'. The third is performed with 'wives or prized courtesans'. The fourth is performed with outcasts such as the potter's wife. What is the particular advantage of the fourth sacrifice? Qt.l02d.2, then, is not at all concerned with mother or daughter but with the advantage of the fourth Circle Sacrifice. The Vedic teaching is that the upright man who observes the dharma will have as one of his highest duties to join with his wife who is of the same caste as himself and by the emission of seed with its accompanying pleasure (riramsa) to continue the family line. It is against this particular norm of conduct that the fourth Circle Sacrifice and Sacrifice 3 inveigh. It proposes just the opposite situation: to join with a woman of whatever caste or condition who is not the wife, and to have sexual intercourse with her but without seeking the pleasure of orgasm, Qt.l02d.7, and without 228. Jr.102d.5-6, Qt.102d.3-7."},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"134  The Kula Ritual the intent of procreation.229 The aim is to engage in sexual activity simply in order to arrive at consciousness and to attain the state of being liberated while living. Even if there is procreation, as in the example quoted in Qt.102d.6and allowed for in TA 29.162cd -163, it is without the intent of pleasure. The sexual partner provides the satisfaction which allows the practitioner to become still even as he is roused. He must not alter the balance and experience orgasm which causes intense pleasure, on the one hand, but breaks the stillness of absorption, on the other. Rather than seek the fluctuating mental stages of excitement and abatement, the practitioner seeks intimacy with the sexual partner while focussing on their eternal identity as Siva and sakti, joined together in bliss. (d) In short, the evidence would seem to hold that the sakti of sl. 101 cd-102 is not the mother, sister, daughter or wife etc. but is a woman who takes on the position of a consecrated female vis-a-vis the practitioner. The one woman has six aspects just as the divine sakti manifests herself in many ways and has innumerable further aspects depending on how she is viewed. As was forecast in the fourth Circle Sacrifice where Abhinava states that 'the Circle Sacrifice which takes place through their presence gives every result', the one woman 'bestows both enjoyment and liberation'(TA 29.103). After presenting the ingredients and the participants of the ritual, the text goes on to define the ritual itself: it consists of three types of emission: emanation, reabsorption and union (melakam). This briefest of definitions can be understood, according to Jr.l04b.l, as the stages of sexual intercourse or as the five forms of subtle-breath or the five stages of consciousness which finish with the ultimate state, the union of Siva and sakti. Similarly, in sl.l04cd-105ab, Abhinava summarises the ritual in terms which are both erotic and sacred. The various meanings are possible because of the inter-relationship of the lower and higher circles which lead to each other. 229. Indeed one of the descriptions of the perfect sexual partner is that she is 'without children' (aprasuta, Qt.l00b.6)."},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"Tantraloka29   135   The texts which now follow will occasionally require an analysis of some of the terms or require the accompaniment of a commentary which will help unravel a compact statement. Examination of the Ritual The First Emission: Emanation (srsti); the 'arisen' (udita); There are three Emissions just as there are three ways of understanding the phoneme H. The First Emission is concerned with emanation, with H as the source of the other phonemes, the Second Emission with reabsorption, with H as the moment of transition which leads to the state of Siva. Finally, the Third Emission is concerned with H as the two points,': ', as the union of things, as the union of Siva and sakti who are the upper and lower dots respectively.230 The First Emission actually consists of three Trajectories, each more subtle than the other, each able to lead to the fullness of consciousness. Again, the three Trajectories tackle the Emission from the point of view of action, differentiated thought and the immediacy of the sexual fluid. A few points need to be made with regard to each Trajectory. Trajectory 1.

TA 3.215-9."},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"136  The Kula Ritual The first Trajectory is particularly concerned with the circles, i.e. the higher and lower faculties. In introducing this subject in Jr.l07b.3, Jayaratha raises a significant objection. In sl. 105cd-106ab, Abhinava had said that the supreme bliss comes from within, from the principal circle. On the other hand, Qt.l07b.l states that it comes from outside. Does bliss come from outside or from inside? Abhinava will answer this dilemma by his definition of sacrifice in sl.l08-l09ab: 'And the sacrifice, viewed externally, is called 'satiation'; and as a result there is an expansion.' He notes that while satiation or pleasure is significant it is ordered according to its capacity to prepare for the experience of consciousness so that a pleasure which does not lead to consciousness is useless and is to be discarded. Yet the pleasure is not the cause of consciousness but the circumstance in which consciousness freely arises, for consciousness is not controlled by pleasure but is essentially autonomous. The focus lies, therefore, not on the pleasure but on its possible result. Pleasure is a sacrifice in response to which the divinity draws close and blesses the practitioner. In this way, Abhinava avoids the charge of hedonism and reconciles both enjoyment and liberation. Purity and pleasure are not necessarily opposed. On the contrary, when the pleasures are experienced on the unsullied basis of true consciousness, the practitioner attains the state of Rudra, the divinity who in his essence combines or rather transcends enjoyment and liberation. On the basis of such a definition, Abhinava describes the ritual from the experiential point of view according to levels 3, 4,5,6 and 7 of the seven levels of bliss which have been described in Chapter 5 above. The third stage, parananda, is a satiation of the various sub-circles or lower faculties with the 3 M's and also with sandal-wood, incense etc. It is quite different from the seventh stage, jagadananda. In parananda pleasure is found in external objects (para) but so far without the sense of 'I am', AHAM. Since consciousness is the source of all, there is a movement of attention,"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"Tantraloka29  , 137 brahmananda, towards consciousness. The practitioner becomes amazed as his own true self begins now to be revealed and the goddesses begin to absorb reality and lead in the direction of the bliss of consciousness. Abhinava now introduces the significant contrasting figure of the person who is fixated at the level of parananda. In point of fact it is not possible to remain at that point for the stages of bliss are essentially mobile and the experience of pleasure in external objects becomes jaded if it does not move on. The egoist who is fixated upon his ego (ahamkara) becomes in fact ahamyuh, haughty, and is not fit for the Kula ritual which is focussed on AHAM. A practitioner of this sort does not experience the move­ment to higher levels, nor does he experience the expansiveness which belongs to the seventh stage, jagadananda, universal bliss. 'His sense of self is not complete nor does it well up' (sl. 113ab). The practitioner and his partner who do proceed along the stages of bliss now allow their mutual pleasuring to enter a new phase and become intensely aware of each other, indeed become absorbed in each other. This is the mahananda. Their intentness upon each other does not mean, Abhinava is quick to note, that they are abstracted from the sub-circles, from the body etc. but on the contrary, the sub-circles are agitated by the heightened conscious­ness the pair now enjoy so that the erotic experience is expressed in all the faculties, in movement, touch etc. and involves a more passionate form of exchange, as Jayaratha notes in Jr. 115b.2. The experience of cidananda now occurs whereby the couple lose all sense of differentiation and their union is complete. They are taken to the highest form of consciousness, the uniting form of emission, the condition of Siva and sakti, a subject dealt with more particularly in the Third Emission. This condition is not a transcen­dence which denies the reality of the world but an entry into universal bliss (jagadananda). The whole world is seen as coming from them and destined for them. They are the supreme kaula, the union of Akula and Kula and all that is emitted. They transcend emanation and reabsorption and are the source of these so that all is reconciled in their perfect fusion. The bliss of Siva and of the world is the same."},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"138  The Kula Ritual Trajectory 2.

Whereas the first Trajectory (sl.l07cd-l 17ab) emphasised action (kalpa) and led to universal bliss, the second Trajectory starts from differentiated thought (vikalpa) and leads to absorption and the emission of the fluid. The terms 'risen' and 'rested' dominate this Trajectory and variously mean 'apparent' and hidden', 'emanated' and 'reabsorbed', 'awareness of the self and 'awareness of the other'. The Trajectory is described in four stages. (i) The couple becomes particularly aware of sexual difference and of their symbolism as Siva and sakti and so engage in the movements of intercourse which symbolise the ceasing and arising of emanation and dissolution, the whole rhythm of the pulsating universe. (ii) The couple become aware of the emotions of the heart as they go out to each other or return to their own self-awareness in a mutual giving and receiving. Each is aware of the 'rising', i.e. of the outgoing to the other, and of the 'resting', i.e. the return to self-awareness. (iii) This fluctuation, the intercourse, does not stay at a dualism but results in a unity where they become each other, truly a pair and not two monads. They are at the highest level where Siva and sakti are not two but one, just as the fire and its capacity to burn are one. They rest in each other and this resting is wholly manifest, or - as Abhinava who is a virtuoso with words expresses it - the 'resting' is 'risen', is apparent. (iv) This experience produces a particular effect in the sakti so that there is an 'emanation'. While this term can be understood at"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"Tantraloka29   139   many levels including the manifestation of the universe, it also refers to the sexual fluid which may flow at this intense moment of unity and symbolises bliss as well as the whole universe, so that it acquires an evocative power, as shall be seen next.

Result: consciousness etc. The third Trajectory is concerned with the sakti and the immediacy of her impact. Because of the immediacy, the Trajectory goes beyond kalpa and vikalpa to undifferentiated or immediate knowledge (nirvikalpa). The Trajectory is extensive and varied and begins with two descriptions of the sakti. The first focuses on her very nature (bhava), the fact that she has the 'fully opening and closing central path' which links her so intimately with the visarga,: H. The body of the guru may well be the object of worship in the seventh Kula sacrifice proposed in the Tantrasara, but the body of the sakti is superior even to the guru's body. The second description focusses on the fact that she is ritually prepared (bhdvita) as the means by which the Kula tradition is transmitted so that every sakti is an image of Ardhatryambaka who received the Kula tradition from her father and passed it on to her disciples. The very nature of the sakti and of her capacities gives rise to a number of intended ambiguities. Consciousness, the 'mouth of the yogini' and the sexual fluid which is emitted, all correlate with each other. This needs to be spelled out. Consciousness is the kaula, the union of Siva and sakti and is the place where the 'rested' and the 'risen' preexist. Just as from them and their pulsation the world is emitted, so too from the sakti the fluid is emitted. The emitting of the sexual fluid is its 'saying' by the 'mouth of the yogini1. Just as consciousness cannot be put into writing, so too the fluid deriving"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"140  The Kula Ritual from the experience of consciousness is an immediate reality which must be experienced and so cannot be 'put into writing'. And just as consciousness is the preeminent circle because it produces the highest bliss, so too the 'mouth of the yogini1 which emits the fluid is the principal circle. To taste the fluid is to engage in 'mouth to mouth' and therefore to arrive at the preexisting 'rested' and 'risen'. In another sense, when the practitioner joins his 'mouth' to the 'mouth of the yogini1, when the sexual organs are joined, he comes to consciousness. The sexual fluid since it results from consciousness and leads to consciousness can also be called the 'rested' and the 'risen' and derives its power from all these meanings.

These rituals are for the person who desires liberation and for the two types who seek enjoyment. Desiring liberation, the mumuksu seeks to attain that state which precedes any movement of consciousness to objectivity. Therefore, while being involved with the 'mouth of the yogini and the resultant 'rested' and 'risen' sexual fluid, he focusses his attention on the experience which made the sakti emit the fluid. By focussing on her experience of that prior emitting reality, as later the practitioner"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"Tantraloka29   141   will focus on the sound HA-HA (sl. 158cd), he comes to experience what she has known, the bliss of 'the undivided level', so that she is truly the door and the means to liberation. The bubhuksu, by contrast, is concerned with enjoyment and therefore with the world that has been emanated. Appropriately, the ritual for the two types of bubhuksu, the knowledgeable person and the officiant, involves handling the actual sexual fluid, the 'ejaculated form', which results from the experience of conscious­ness. It is endowed with all the powers of consciousness among which one of the most prized is 'bodily stability' (pinda-sthairya) or immortality and youthful vigour, especially sexual vigour and attractiveness. The knowledgeable person knows the Kula tradition and especially its categories and is particularly involved in teaching that knowledge. Accordingly, the ritual involves the mouth and the consumption of the fluid which, coming as it does from the body called kula, is itself called kula. It is obtained either directly from the body or in the form of a pill or paste and is consumed in very specific rituals. Jr. 129b.3 and Qt.l29b.3 are very illuminating and fill out Abhinava's arcane statement 'mouth to mouth'.230a The officiant does not, in fact, have the knowledge or discriminating knowledge which distinguishes the knowledgeable person but he does have insight and therefore he is able to participate in the Kula ritual which is based on undifferentiated thought. Since he is involved with action rather than with knowledge, his ritual is concerned with action and the external. Thus he uses the fluid to delineate, on the sex organ of the sakti as well as on his own, the process of reabsorption and emanation 230a. In her commentary on sl. 128-129, Silburn notes the following marriage custom from Kashmir. The young couple are together. The bridegroom's mother places a morsel of food in her son's mouth. The young man then cuts it in half and places a piece in his bride's mouth. She, in her turn, places a piece in her bridegroom's mouth.

Abhinava makes use of two patterns - the seven levels of bliss and the four stages of the Krama. He begins by positing the state of 'rested', the first state of bliss (nijananda) which is the repose in the self or in the 'sea of subsiding billows' (taranga). However, it is a human being of flesh and blood who has reached that state of repose. The faculties, the central circle in the first place but also all the other sub-circles which depend on it, cease to function and are therefore dissatisfied since their natural condition is to act and take pleasure in the objective world. They are plunged in non-bliss (nirananda), the second of the seven stages of bliss, but this situation cannot continue. The faculties, or rather the deities of the faculties, like the artist, create their own objects. The next four steps, which might be expressed as levels 3, 4, 5 and 6 of bliss,, are described in terms of the four steps of the Krama, namely: udyoga, creative outburst; avabhdsa, manifestation; carvana, devouring; visranti, repose. Not only does the faculty absorb its object - the eye sees, the mouth tastes - but the process continues and the whole experience is brought into"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"Tantraloka 29   143   union with consciousness, the true self: 'I see', 'I taste'.231 As a consequence there occurs the next stage which might be called the seventh level of bliss, jagadananda. Here it is described by the expression 'the lord of the circles surges vigorously', or as Jayaratha puts it: 'he quite suddenly turns his attention outwards'. Rest does not mean inactivity or non-involvement. Repose and activity are not mutually exclusive. In fact, Siva is perfectly active because he is perfectly at rest, just as the consummate musician plays effortlessly.

He appropriately examines the term visarga and gives its etymology. The emissions are listed as 'rested', risen' and union; or to use other words, emanation, reabsorption and what is called 'that', namely the ineffable. The Third Emission takes place in two steps. The first concerns the 'mantra', the practitioner who is identified with the mantra. By reconciling all the diversity of nature, the contrasting forces of prana and apana, 'sun' and moon', the joints and veins, and all else, he attains the highest level where he recognises his state of Siva and experiences immediately the most evident reality, Being itself, the knowing subject, 'I'. In this context something further happens. Of itself, the creative awareness (paramarsa), which is the 'resonance' (dhvani),232 the first movement of consciousness to objectivity, becomes evident. Since it is a first movement to objectivity it contains in itself the triple emission, the three aspects of the phoneme H, namely awareness (vimarsa) and the two emissions that proceed from it -absorption and becoming or, to use other words, reabsorption and emanation. Since this creative awareness is the fountainhead of all other mantras, it is their potency (mantra-viryam). When it shares its splendour even one's own individual mantra is empowered to acquire every fruit. The practitioner proceeds to recite his mantra in such a way that the whole outflow of creative awareness becomes united with consciousness. The recitation is in three stages. It starts with the goddesses of the sub-circles, the whole objective reality. It proceeds according to the modalities of sound, the twelve or eight stages of the uccara which have been noted already in Chapter 5 and, by 232. In TA 4.18lcd-193, Abhinava discusses the potency of the mantra (mantraviryam). He begins his discussion with a definition of dhvani which is the foundation of the potency: '[Consciousness], because by nature it is creative awareness, sponta­neously possesses a resonance (dhvanih) which is ever arising and which is called 'the great supreme Heart.' Potency is given to a mantra, any mantra, if it is associ­ated with the great mantra of the Heart. In TA 4.193ab, he concludes his discus­sion on the potency of the mantra with the succinct phrase: 'The potency of all mantras consists of the Heart.1 See also Padoux, La Paratrisikalaghuvrtti, p.99 note 171."},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"Tantraloka 29   145   means of the creative awareness which is the principle of unity, all enters into consciousness. In this way, the practitioner has indeed become Siva in a way imitating sl.22 of the Opening Ritual. , The second step largely develops sl.23 of the Opening Ritual. The practitioner who has become the mantra now couples with the sakti so that together they form the six rayed mudra which phonically is expressed as the sixth vowel, AI, and together they attain the state of khecarimudra. Abhinava begins by describing the sexual organ and the pleasure zones of the female and the male in terms reminiscent of the mandala of the Kula tradition. The couple then begin their intercourse consisting of three moments. The first is the movement, the friction of the organs, after which the male and female fluids, the 'moon' and 'sun' fluids,233 are emitted and then in the third moment are united. In the 'fire', which results from all of this, comes the 'sprout', the emanation. These matters can be understood at many levels hence Abhinava's use of symbolic language. At one level, sl. 15l-153ab is a description of intercourse leading to the procreation of a child or to the sense of producing the whole universe which is called the Fourth.234 At another level, it is the joining of the object and means of knowledge. These coincide in such a way that the 'fire', the conscious subject arises. Another step now occurs. Just as the creative awareness (paramarsa) arises during the attentiveness to Being, so awareness (vimarsa) appears during the stable attention to the Fourth. This awareness is higher than creative awareness since' the couple in their union more clearly symbolise Siva and sakti, or, as Jayaratha puts it in Jr. 154b.2, the interplay (lollbhava)235 of mantra and mudra in copulation leads to the first and highest form of consciousness, the supreme sound. Abhinava then goes on to describe the recitation which is most appropriate to this context. It is a natural recitation in the sense 233. The moon has 16 'portions'. The sun has 12 phases, one for each month of the solar year, de Mallmann, Les enseignements, p.7. 234. The sexual fluid is suggested perhaps in Qt.l53b.5, the idea of the yogmi-born is found in sl.162cd-163ad and the sense of the Fourth is mentioned in sl.l54ab. 235. 'Lolibhava in this system is a technical word. This means that both word (vacaka) and its referent (vacya) are so closely tied that the one signifies the other.\" Singh, Paratrimsikavivarana, pp.121-122. The same applies to mantra and mudra."},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"146  The Kula Ritual that it is not something learned such as the mantra received in initiation but rather it is spontaneous and innate (sahaja). It is sahaja, natural, in another sense, namely that it derives (ja) from SA and HA or, to invert the phonemes, from HA and SA, hamsa, the subtle-breath. The analysis of the recitation takes place in three stages, namely the eight circles, the eight levels and the eight bhairavas, which express in greater detail the recitation mentioned briefly in sl. 149cd-150ab. Abhinava uses the number eight because the number eight has a sense of totality in that eight elements are deemed to completely surround the centre of which they are the complete expression. The first stage is objectivity. The term 'circle' means 'pair' or 'two' or in this case 'male and female'. The eight circles of sl.l57cd-158ab refer to eight stages in the act of intercourse and to eight levels in the body where the intercourse is experienced, ending with consciousness itself, the end-of-twelve. The list is given not in order to limit the number of circles but to show the completeness of this level. The second stage is the subtle level of the arousing of sound (uccara). Here too the number eight is symbolic since the whole range of sound from the audible to the supreme is intended. Where normally the yogi attends to his own recitation, here he concentrates on the reaction of his sexual partner. He is led by her natural recitation, her cry of love which is the inarticulate sound (avyakta) and the primordial syllable (aksara), to the highest level of bliss which is the third stage, the perfect fusion of Siva and sakti, an ineffable state referred to as 'that' (tat), a neuter pronoun. Accordingly the highest level, the supreme Bhairava, is envisaged as surrounded by eight bhairavas whose names are listed in the neuter form, and who are the eight stages or phases of sound, the expression of that perfect fusion.

Concluding bibliography"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"Tantraloka29   147   The lengthy description of Sacrifice 3 has now reached its climax with two principal effects. The first is the pervasion of consciousness. Since the practitioner is not tied (alepo) to any audible mantra or to any particular ritual, he is able to transform every state and circumstance. Being free of any particular ritual, all becomes ritual and every word is his mantra. All is sacred and so the practitioner is always pure (alepo). He is Bhairava, and his state is that of bhairavi-mudra where the interior and the exterior are the same, the one subject, T. He is liberated-while-living. A second result is the conception of the child, the yogini-born. Because the practitioner and his partner have attained the perfect fusion of Siva and sakti, the child so conceived is an expression of this transcendent unity, a Rudra, and so has all knowledge. The couple and the child are the counterparts of the khecari and their offspring mentioned in Jr.46b.l.

Sacrifice 3 brings the practitioner to a state where in all the actions of every-day life he is'... ever unattached, liberated-while-living, the supreme Bhairava', TA 29.162ab. He is free because he has joined male and female in the six rayed mudra of intercourse and his only method therein is recollection which had been so prized in sl.64-65. This is reflected in both the Tantrasara and the Tantroccaya where, at the conclusion of Sacrifice 3 which is described largely by quoting verbatim from the Tantrdloka, Abhinava quotes from TA 32.20cd-24ab as follows: 236.

From it rises the linga238 which is composed of all the categories. From it also radiate the lotus, circle and space, three increasingly abstract patterns which represent the three dimensions of object, means and subject of knowledge. The triple trident of this kind indicates that the practitioner of Sacrifice 4 is at least a Son and that he is engaged in the totality of the Krama cycle.

If the apana was offered as satiation to the many goddesses of the prana, now the whole of reality, every enjoyment, is offered to the one goddess of consciousness. Abhinava describes the process of worship firstly in a brief presentation and then in a detailed description which seems, from Jr. J 86b. 1, to follow the Krarna stages of reabsorption. Jayaratha himself (Jr.185d.l-2) seems to recapitulate the whole procedure in terms of the Krama.242 The description depends significantly on the pun formed by the word citi which can mean either funeral pyre or consciousness. By consuming all in the fire of pure subjectivity, the practitioner achieves the highest state. The dissolution of everything in the fire of consciousness is the true initiation.243 (h) Sub-topic 6 'Initiation' sl. 186cd- l 87ab Enunciation of the sub-topic Having performed the rituals for the initiate, the guru has arrived at the highest state of consciousness and so is in a state of perfection 242. In Jr. 186b. 1, Jayaratha refers to the stages of the Krama and in Jr.185d.l-2 he takes all the key words of sl. 183-185 and reorganises them according to those stages. His investigation is divided into two parts, the multiple of which gives the twelve stages. 1.The first part goes from 'In this [body]' and finishes with 'will not be brought to perfection?' It is an investigation particularly of the phrase 'located within the body' (sl.182c). The four major stages of the Krama, namely emanation, maintenance, reabsorption and 'the ineffable', are reflected, within the limitations of his text, by the words 'filled', 'transience', 'abandonment' and 'this', which last relates to 'the ineffable', the fourth stage of the Krama. 'The ineffable' is reflected again in the word 'in that' which occurs in the second part of the investigation. 2. The second part is introduced by the question 'what sort of reality' and goes from the phrase 'in the sense of simply of turning inwards' and finishes with the phrase 'to the place of repose in one's self alone' and is an investigation of the phrase 'radiant as the Fire of Time', sl.l82d. It dwells on the three spheres of 'ob­ject of knowledge', 'means of knowledge' and 'subject of knowledge'. The first of these is reflected in the phrase 'the passing bodily form of all things'; the second in the phrase 'free of all differentiated thoughts ... the faculties'; the third in the phrase 'the single form of the knowing subject'. 243. In Paratrimsikavivarana p.279 lines 9-10, for which see Gnoli, II commento, p. 174 notes 530a and 530b, Abhinava, after describing the dissolution of all into con­sciousness, quotes the following text: 'Acknowledgment of one's essential nature: this is mantra in the highest sense, this is initiation and this is the sacrifice, this is the ritual action, it is unsurpassable.'"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"Tantraloka 29   151   (sl. l 85c) and is therefore in a position to perform initiation, for if it is true that only Siva can worship Siva it is also true that only Siva can initiate into the worship of Siva. The whole Tantraloka is basically divided into two parts. Chapters 1-12 deal primarily with knowledge (jhana) while chapter 13 is an important bridge to chapters 14-34 which deal with the ritual, more specifically with the various forms of initiation (diksa).244 Chapter 15 deals with ordinary initiation. Chapters 16 and 17 describe the initiation of the Son. Chapter 18 deals with initiation in its shortened form. Chapter 19 describes initiation at the hour of death. Chapter 20 is an excursus on the symptoms of effective initiation which will be mentioned briefly in TA 29.207-208. Chapter 21 describes the initiation of those who are absent, either through distance or because of death. Ch.22 discusses the initiation of converts from inferior rituals. In Ch.23, Abhinava momentarily moves out of the field of initiation strictly speaking and into the topic of consecration. Ch.24 deals with the initiation of those who have been sent to a hell. Ch.25, the rite performed after death (sraddha), is the last of the initiations. Thus the rites of initiation occupy a large part of the Tantraloka. In TA 1.43 ff., Abhinava considers the relationship of initiation and knowledge and emphasises that the only initiation which gives liberation in life is the one preceded by knowledge. Indeed he notes245 that for some disciples the mere knowledge of chapters 1-10 of the Tantrasara on the four methods of attaining Siva and the pathways etc. will be sufficient to procure liberation. Similarly, he considers that the highest form of initiation occurs by intuition (pratibha) which comes either from a 'very intense' or from an 'intense' descent of energy. It is a direct initiation by the goddesses themselves so that there is no need for such a person to undergo the ritual of initiation. Again, in rare cases there can also be a 244. In Paratrimsikavivarana p.273 line 17, Abhinava provides the traditional etymology: 'Diksa is defined as the granting (dana) of knowledge and the de­struction (ksapana) of maya.

Ordinary initiation is described according to three different texts which progress from the more external and gentle to the more interior and shocking. The first is according to Malinivijayottara-tantra 11.17cd ff. with which Abhinava now resumes after the long break of Sacrifices 2-6. Given the information provided in the rituals for the initiate, the rituals of initiation are fairly self-explanatory. A few items need special consideration, however. In TA 15.456cd-474ab, Abhinava describes the so-called ritual of the 'hand-of-Siva'. Firstly, the guru sacrifices to the circle of the mantra (mantra-cakram) located on his right hand and then places his hand on the head of the disciple, on his heart and navel and afterwards on every limb of the disciple's body so that the disciple becomes an ordinary initiate. By contrast, in the more interior and more powerful rituals of TA 29, the rite of the 'hand of Siva' is performed by the disciple himself. The guru does not touch him but is there silent and immobile for he acts from within, he reflects (yicintayei) and manipulates the rudrasakti which is Malini enclosed by Para or Matrsadhbava and is also called the 'circle of the goddess' or is described as a curved flame and is deemed to have the form of an elephant goad (ankusa)249 designed to both prod and pull. The guru directs the rudrasakti, the circle of the goddess (devi-cakram) so that the disciple places his own hands on his own head. The disciple is moved to touch not some lower centre but the highest so that the illumination will be of the highest order and both hands are used because the disciple is being 248. TA 15.520cd-521 ab, Abhinava states that 'An ordinary initiate is qualified for study, for hearing the scriptures, for daily worship and for service of the guru.' Further rules of conduct are given in TA 15.521cd-61 lcd which apply, mutatis mutandis, to the ordinary Kula initiate. 249. 'The Elephant Goad is a manifestation of the god's powers of attraction and subju­gation.'

The 'hand of Siva' has therefore several meanings in TA 29. It refers to the internal act of the guru with its resultant external effects, to the rudrasakti, the 'elephant goad' which the guru manipulates and to the hands of the disciple which have been so empowered. The significance of ordinary initiation lies not so much in the external events as in the experience so that the principal task of the guru is to observe the descent of energy (saktipata) and therefore the degree of absorption. Siva expresses himself in the emanation of the universe which eventually peters out in inertia and conversely he draws all back to himself by the revelation of his splendour. All this is performed out of grace (anugraha) for he is essentially free. The revelation is performed in nine ways according as he pleases. These are the descent of energy. Even though Siva is free, the attitude of the recipient is not irrelevant. For example, if the recipient desires only liberation, the circumstances of his life - birth, family, bodily health, wealth, even his karma - are of no account whereas if he wishes enjoyments, these matters influence the type of saktipata.251 Abhinava notes in general terms, that the descent of energy is classed into three groups: tivra which means 'strong', 'violent', 'severe'; madhya, 'medium'; and manda 'weak', 'slow', 'sluggish'.252 Each of the three is divided again according to the same classification to form nine categories.253 In general Abhinava rings 250. In Tantrasara p. 163, in discussing the ritual to be performed in the case of a dying person, Abhinava describes how the 'hand of Siva' is to be used: the right hand alone is transformed into a triangular mandala which is made to blaze with fire and wind and is then placed on the head of the dying person in order to burn away every impurity and lead him to the highest level. 251.

Identity with Siva is the result. (ii) Intense: This eliminates all ignorance and is a sudden intuition (pratibha) and such a person is called 'an intuitive guru'.254 Abhinava continues with a long discussion - many elements of which he had already presented in TA 4.33-85 - on the quality of such a person. Given the importance he attaches to this ideal figure throughout TA 29, some of the major features must be mentioned. (a) Such a person receives illumination independently of all levels of initiation, of exterior purifications, of teachers, scriptures etc.: - 'he has been initiated by the goddesses'.255 He is like the moon, dispelling both darkness and heat (tapas) in his disciples; his look is full of bliss; he is acquainted with all the sciences, with tradition, grammar, astronomy, kula etc.256 In his presence other gurus 'lose their qualification'.257 (b) Significantly, Abhinava distinguishes between a hesitant and firm intuition. The hesitant intuition received from an intense descent of energy may be made brilliant and clear by means of teachers, the scriptures, by 'yoga, sacrifice and recitation'.258 (c) The person who receives an intense descent of energy acquires extraordinary supernatural powers, such as hearing from afar, penetration (vedha), playful acts such as immense size, 259 but 'turns from those powers with disgust, intent only on having the nature of Siva'.260 That being said, the supernatural powers do, 254.

The private worshipper at the shrine who presents his offering of flowers can have received intuition of Siva no less than the teacher who expounds the scriptures to the assembled throng. (iii) Slightly intense: In this case the disciple cannot proceed on the basis of his own intuition but is inspired to find an authentic guru (sadgurum) who will initiate him and grant him liberation. Abhinava lists some ways in which this initiation may occur: 'This [initiation] - which can be obtained from any one of the following or all together - is divided as follows: resulting from an exposition, from a meeting, from a look, from a scripture, from a transmission, from the sight of a ritual act [which excludes no one by reason of birth etc. (?)] (samya), from the oblation, from the efficacy of a mantra and of a mudra etc., from a ritual act, from penetrating into the interior subtle-breath.'263 Abhinava describes the six lesser varieties of descent of energy in the space of about seven slokas. These show an increasing concern with enjoyments and a decreasing lack of conviction about Sivahood, the lynch pin of the Kula ritual. In consequence the six lesser forms need not be described further except to make the final point that even the very weak descent of energy is still an act of grace on the part of Siva such that the person who is so little favoured will also attain liberation in the end. 261.

They are like stone and are to be abandoned.264 Finally, the disciple's attitude towards the 'oblation' is of particular importance in the second form of ordinary initiation. If he is hesitant (kampa) he will remain an ordinary initiate but if he is fearless the guru will give him initiation as a Son. This is brought out more fully in the third form of ordinary initiation where the guru quite simply proffers the 'oblation'. As Jayaratha notes in Jr.200d.2, the awesome 'oblation' is a most powerful means for attaining consciousness. Indeed it is an indirect means of the 'non-means' which is the highest and first of the upayas.265 By taking the oblation the disciple shows he has been absorbed into consciousness and so rises above the concepts of pure and impure, above social convention and even natural repugnance. He has gone beyond maya, has been absorbed into sakti and has become a member of one of the clans (gotra) of saktis. II. Initiation as a Son sl. 20lab Enunciation The initiation as Son (putraka)266 is the dividing point of all the initiations and consecrations of TA 29. Thus ordinary 'initiation' is a prelude to initiation as Son. These two stages form a whole and there is no need to go further. The disciple may wish simply to remain in the state of liberation obtained by his initiation but he may also choose to adopt a public role and seek to become either 264. TA 29.211b. 265. In TA 2, which deals with the 'non-means', Abhinava states that '... the teaching occurs once only' (sakrtsyaddesana, sl.2c) so that nothing more is needed to come to full consciousness. In Tantraloka vol.2, p.312 line 13, in his investigation of this phrase, Jayaratha quotes a source, which states: 'for the siddhas and yoginis the eating of the 'oblation' (carubhojanam) is revelation', and goes on to say that nothing else is needed. The 'oblation' has the same impact as the teaching. 266. The word putraka is simply a diminutive of putra, son. However, it is also held to derive from a compound, put-tra, 'preserving from the hell called Put'. Monier-Williams, Sanskrit English dictionary, p.632. It also has the ordinary meaning of 'son', 'offspring' etc., from putra. For that reason Gnoli translates putraka as 'figlio spirituale' [spiritual son]."},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"158  The Kula Ritual an Adept or a Master. He need not first become an Adept but may directly go on to become a Master. It is also possible for the one who has first chosen to be an Adept to seek further consecration as a Master267 but by contrast there is no point in a Master seeking consecration as an Adept, as Jr.232d. 1 makes clear. Initiation as Son must precede initiation-by-penetration. He must first be brought to liberation and only then can he properly receive the enjoyments which penetration procures. There are four subdivisions of the term 'Son'. In TA 15.23-26, on the basis of ritual, Abhinava contrasts the Son who is nirbija and the Son who is sabija. The nirbija has no ritual obligation etc. so that children, women and the sick, for example, fit into this class. The tattva-jna, 'the person who knows reality', can also be placed in this class because he transcends the limitations of ritual obligation. The sabija, who receives initiation into a 'seed' (bija) has various ritual duties and a rule of life. Thirdly and fourthly, in TA 29.205d, Abhinava distinguishes between the niskala-putraka and the sakala-putraka, according as the Son seeks either liberation only or seeks enjoyments as well as liberation. The Son is called a mumuksu, one who seeks liberation, a term often opposed to the term bubhuksu, the person who desires enjoyments. Can a mumuksu desire enjoyments? Are not enjoyment and liberation so opposed as to exclude each other? Abhinava deals with this question in sl.219 ff. and explains that the liberated person knows both liberation and enjoyment by proceeding through the five stages of consciousness. In other words, because he has experienced consciousness in his initiation as a Son he will want to express it by knowing every level of being and the enjoyments of every level. It is called 'the Kula tradition of sacrifice' (sl.220c). The successful combination of both 'enjoyment and liberation' (bhoga-moksau, sl.276d) is the climax of TA 29. The word tattva-yna268 with its synonym, tattva-vid, recurs 267. This somewhat complex topic is dealt with in TA 29.231-232 and Jr.232d.l. 268. In L'essenza, p.269, Gnoli translates the word atattvajhanl as someone who does not have the 'consciousness of reality'. In Gnoli, Luce, p.584, he translates tattvavin, tattvajna and jnani as 'gnostic'.

It revolves around the meaning of tattva which normally means category but is also a code word. In Jr. 166b. 1, Jayaratha defines the essence involved in the Primordial Sacrifice: 'it consists of the 'substance' (tattva) of consciousness and it appears as 'nectar' ', meaning sexual fluid. Accordingly, the tattva-jna, the one who knows the tattva, refers to the person who has taken the 'oblation' and who has been absorbed into the highest category, consciousness itself and so has become a Son. 1.

Some points need elaboration and the ritual according to the Sadbhava needs some explanation. The first point for elaboration is the word kala which has two different meanings in the description of initiation according to the Ratnamala and its investigation.269 The first meaning refers to the whole range of categories grouped into five kola starting from the lowest, earth, to the highest, santy-atita. It is according to this pathway that the disciple is regenerated and 'nourished'.270 The second meaning refers to the five coverings (kala) and to the scope of the regeneration, as follows. Siva is said to be of two sorts composed (sakala) or simple (niskala) which means with or without 269. For the two groups of kala, see Appendix 1. 270. TA 16 deals with initiation as a Son. The cleansing of the pathway of the kala is treated in TA 16.147ab-150ab."},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"160  The Kula Ritual those five coverings. Jayaratha explains that the person who is merged into Siva in his simple form is initiated as a Son without more ado. The person who is merged in Siva in his composite form is initiated with reference to a later consecration as an Adept who will be involved in obtaining and conferring enjoyments in the world of multiplicity. In his survey of initiation as a Son (sl.201cd-202ab) Abhinava had mentioned the absorption (avesa) which causes the initiate to fall to the ground. In fact, he lists five signs,271 of which the reeling is the least significant but perhaps the most spectacular. The five are bliss, lightness, trembling, sleep and reeling.272 If the disciple is particularly attached to the body, the descent of energy will have its effect there, releasing him from his attachment to the body and making him fall. The bliss which is experienced in the 271. In TA 13.214-215, Abhinava gives a different list. 'Under the term 'penetrated by rudrasakti', the following list of signs, according to [the Malinlvijayottaratantra], is implied in due order: perfectly unwavering devotion to Rudra, the supernatural power of the mantra, dominion of all the categories, the successful accomplish­ment of any undertaking, the gift of poetry, understanding the meaning of all the scriptures.' 272. In TA 28.218cd-219ab, in the context of a discussion about the life-cycle, Abhinava states that: ' Incarnation is [the appearance of the subtle-breath] within the body which is located in the womb. The subtle-breath first arises from consciousness which is within the void.' The sequence is, therefore, consciousness, void, subtle-breath, [internal and external] body which is reflected in sl.207cd. In Tantrasara p.63 lines 6-7, Abhinava gives the reverse procedure. In Tantrasara p.40, he links these five effects with the five levels of consciousness and with the five locations in the body. These, along with the place where the energy enters, are schematised as follows: Place of Energy external body bahis-tanu internal body antar-tanu subtle-breath pranana space vyoma mind citi Effect reeling ghurni sleep nidra trembling kampa lightness udbhava bliss ananda Level of Consciousness wakefulness jagrat dreaming sleep svapna deep sleep susupta Fourth turya Beyond-Fourth turyatlta Place in Body triangle trikona 'bulb' kanda heart hrt palate talu upper kundalini urdhva-kundalini"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"Tantraloka 29   161   mind may not be spectacular in the same way but is more significant. Indeed, in Jr.208d.l, Jayaratha links the effects with the degrees of the descent of energy so that a very intense descent of energy will enter the mind and produce bliss while a very weak descent of energy can only touch the body. The burning of the bonds (Jr.208d. l) is the elimination of karma and of rebirth. But which aspect of karma? There is a past, present and future karma encompassing the acts and their consequences in all the dimensions of time. If all of these are eliminated the disciple must die, as Jayaratha notes in Jr.208d.2. However, the guru who has joined the disciple to Siva and has liberated him from the consequences of ignorant action in the past and from the prospect of error in the future does not eliminate the present condition of the disciple which is the 'remainder' but regenerates the disciple with pure categories. Just as Siva who is immanent to the world is pure so too the disciple who is joined to Siva is equally immanent to the world and enjoys it. For that reason Abhinava, after completing the discussion of initiation as a Son, goes on to speak of enjoyments (sl.219-224). The ideal throughout TA 29 is not to be absent from the world but to be fully present. After giving the three masses of phonemes (pinda) each of which leads to complete liberation, Abhinava describes the third ritual in detail with specific reference to installation, meditation and recitation. Firstly, the guru installs the saktibija, IM,273 on the whole body of the disciple. Then the twelve vowels are enclosed by HA in circular fashion and installed on the circle of the heart so that consciousness arises from the centre. These three steps resemble the formation of the Kula mandala. At a second stage the guru meditates on the dessicating and burning force of YA and RA in 273. There seems to be a disagreement as to the meaning of sakti-bija. In Jr.216d.l, Jayaratha explains that sakti-bija consists of a double bija: the phoneme I and maya. Buhnernan, p.372, states that sakti-bija is HRIM but Padoux, Le coeu., p.382 footnote 389 and Agehananda Bharati, p. 119, note that HRIM is called maya."},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"162  The Kula Ritual order to release the paralysing grip of karma274 which holds the disciple back from regeneration and condemns him to rebirth. At a third stage, the guru recites one or other of the masses of phonemes, enclosing the disciple's name within the mass such that the disciple is absorbed into sakti and thus attains liberation. The first result of initiation as a Son concerns the disciple alone. Before initiation he was attached to a particular category and was thus held in bondage but by his release from every limitation 'he does not see'. The phrase 'he does not see' signifies bhairavlmudra, the attitude of Bhairava. The disciple no longer 'sees' if 'to see' means seeing something separate from himself, but he is now the totality of all, he is what he sees, he sees what he is, he sees by means of himself. The inner and the outer are the same, all is AHAM.275 The second result is that he also comprehends all the scriptures. As Bhairava he speaks the scriptures and the scriptures speak of him so that he is a guru in the fullest sense.276 III. On the Son who Desires Enjoyments sl. 219-220 1. a. Enjoyment in a category b.

The phoneme YA dessicates and the phoneme RA burns. The seed of karma, when affected by these influences, is made unable to produce its fruit and so the disciple is liberated from the cycle of rebirth. TA 20.5-6a reads: 'The [seed] which is burnt in this way is not able to germinate. For the same reason, the karmas which derive from the stain [of individuality] and maya, and which have been burnt by virtue of mantra, meditation and ritual action are not able to produce their effect.' 275. Anubhavanivedana 1 describes bhairavimudra as follows: \"When the yogi, his subtle-breath and mind dissolved in the internal [object], sees (pasyann) the exter­nal [world] with unwavering perception (drstya) while not seeing it (apasyann): that is truly the mudra of Sambhu which is brought about through your favour, O Guru. This category (tattvam), without void or non-void, is the level of Sambhu.' See also Tantrasara p.68 lines 5-8: 'He who sees this pathway in all its parts (sakalam), in the body and in the subtle-breath, in the mind, in the great emptiness and in consciousness, becomes Bhairava in the fullest sense.' 276.

The person who has achieved liberation through initiation as a Son may therefore proceed in three ways. He may seek his own eventual personal enjoyment whether at a particular level, as in sl.219 or at all levels, as in sl. 220, or seek his personal enjoyment within the public context of obtaining enjoyment for others as an Adept, or, finally, he may seek immediate enjoyments through initiation-by-penetration, as in sl. 236 ff. Abhinava passes quickly over the initiation into enjoyment within a particular category, whether this be at the lowest level such as mastery over a world or at the highest level such as that of Sadasiva, as Jayaratha notes in Jr.220d.l. Such enjoyment is achieved by the appropriate ritual, which Abhinava does not describe, and by the appropriate exercise of concentration (dharana) which will procure the enjoyment. But Abhinava is interested in the larger picture, that of obtaining every enjoyment. This goal is achieved by means of the Kula tradition of sacrifice which is directed, as Abhinava notes in sl.223cd, to those who are completely involved with their own sexual partner or sakti. The practitioner has been liberated through his initiation as a Son and is directed to practise the Kula tradition of sacrifice in its five states, not in order to attain liberation but to show that he is liberated while living. He is given this single life-long practice which both classes him as a sabija putraka and explores every level of enjoyment. In union with his sakti the practitioner proceeds through the five levels of consciousness. These extend from the lowest level of wakefulness with all its mantras or divinities or realities to the authorised to initiate others. See TA 13.134 and TA 28.386cd-387ab and Tantrasara p.122 lines 6-8. In TA 4.41b, in the description of the guru, Abhinava uses the phrases svapratyayatmakah, 'conviction comes from himself, which Jayaratha ex­plains as 'not due to [another] guru etc.'.

In his article 'Meaning', p.90, Sanderson interprets sl.222-223 as follows: waking state: the initiate worships 'the entire pantheon, i.e. Kulesvara and his consort Kulesvari together with the three goddesses Para, Parapara and Apara, their bhairavas and all their retinues of yoginls etc. dream: he worships one of the goddesses with her bhairava and retinue; deep sleep: he worships the core of the pantheon without the retinues, i.e. KuleSvara, Kulesvari, the three goddesses and their bhairavas; Fourth: he worships only KuleSvari; Beyond-Fourth: he worships only Kulesvara. 278. In TA 23.17cd-20ab, Abhinava describes the consecration of the Master and notes, in sl.10lcd, that the consecration of the Adept imitates it. Indeed, Brunner holds that the ritual for the consecration of the Master is the model for that of the Adept. Brunner, 'Le sadhaka', p.422."},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"Tantraloka 29   165   the second, 'internal',279 seems to apply only to the consecration of the Master because it mentions the number sixty-four which is particularly associated with the Master. Both the Adept and the Master are mentioned at this point in TA 29 but Abhinava has very little role for them in the rest of the chapter. The Adept devotes himself to the assiduous practice of the mantra (mantra-sadhana)280 and so obtains the super-natural powers inherent in his mantra. He is able to grant attainments to others and so acquires a public role.281 In TA 29.23 lab, Abhinava clearly defines that role and notes also that the Adept is authorised to give the teaching of the guru and to perform the rituals which, according to Jr.232d.l, include initiation. His role is limited, nevertheless. 'There is no transmission of competence' and there is no 'vow of wisdom'.282 According to TA l5.23cd there are two types of Adept: the sivadharmin stands outside the ordinary customs of life and the lokadharmin leads a life 'in the world'. The Adept in TA 29 is a minor figure. If his role is to grant attainments, the Master's role is to grant liberation (sl.23lcd) but since Abhinava is interested in those who function on the basis of liberation, it is the Master who is the more important figure of the two. Although the Adept is termed a guru in sl.231c, the guru par excellence is the one who grants liberation. Jayaratha, in Jr.232d. 1, takes this a step further and explains that the Master can bestow both attainments and liberation and can adopt any role as he is an 279. In TA 13.144cd, in the course of his discussion of the intense descent of energy, Abhinava makes the point, while referring to Vajasineya, that a person who has received such a descent of energy 'is consecrated in that way not with the waters contained in an external jar.' Jayaratha then quotes the relevant text of Vajasineya which refers to the consecrator performing the consecration by meditating, dhyatva. 280. According to TA 23.102cd-103ab he is given the mantra which he must practice. He is taught the rites he must perform and receives the necessary instruments. The mantra-sadhana is described in detail in Brunner, 'Le sadhaka', pp.423-435. 281. Brunner makes this point in ibid, p.434 footnote 74.

At a certain point it produces spectacular effects such as when the corpse trembles or raises the left hand, bringing the doubting bystander to an experience of liberation.285 The context of TA 29 is not the dying or the dead or the unliberated but the living person who is already liberated and who desires immediate enjoyments.286 The purpose and content of penetration in TA 29 is therefore quite different and has only this in common: that the method produces immediate enjoyments such as minuteness. These in turn, if need there should be, perfect the conviction of the already convinced Son, making his conviction firm and bringing him to the self-evidence of consciousness, pure knowledge. Abhinava distinguishes between three types of guru: the guru who most properly deserves the name, the knowledgeable person 283. Indeed, Brunner suggests that this growing irrelevance of the Adept is one of the reasons why he becomes a forgotten person in the traditions of South India, ibid. pp.441-442. 284.

The first of the six methods, 'by mantra', is related to the eight or twelve levels of sound as given in Appendix 3. The guru reflects how he himself is composed of all these levels and by yogic penetration communicates these to the disciple who is thus taken through all these levels and moves from the state of mere objectivity, caused by his attachment to some object, to the state of pure subjectivity. The second of the six forms is penetration by sound for which Jayaratha's explanation is essential. The guru pronounces Malini or at least its abbreviation, NA-PHA, in a prolonged manner so as to arouse the 'sound' H in the disciple such that the sound which arises in him cleanses the pathway of the phonemes and penetrates through the disciple's mind. The fourth method depends on H which is located in the triangle, at the very basis of the person, the generative organ. The guru somehow inhabits the disciple such that the coiled energy of this place, the dormant subtle-breath, moves upwards of its own volition, rising in a circular movement which encompasses every level and therefore every reality till it reaches the end-of-twelve, the full expansion of the disciple's awareness. Since the body of the disciple symbolises the whole universe, by circulating in every place of the body the energy, H, penetrates the whole universe. The fifth form follows on smoothly from the fourth. The energy, the 'cobra' is described as moving from the generative organ to the space above the head. Abhinava goes on to describe this in more detail. He refers to sets of realities which he says come to a total of five but it is not clear how these five are composed and it is even less clear how, according to Qt.252d.l, there are five sets of five making a total of twenty-five. Whatever about the manner of counting, the groupings variously involve the whole of reality: the five kalas; the categories or rather spheres;289 the auspicious lunar 289. As Jr.252d.l points out, these 'categories' do not refer to the usual thirty-six cat­egories separately considered, but rather to the grouping of the categories in four sets or spheres or 'eggs' (anda) for which see Appendix 1. The fifth 'category' is not a sphere but is Siva himself who contains them all."},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"Tantraloka 29   169   days290; the spaces within the body;291 the kula-s;292 the causal deities;293 the faculties. The sakti penetrates though all of these, moving from the lowest abode of Brahma to the highest abode of Brahma294 so that every circle is pierced and the disciple arrives at full consciousness. Although the first five forms involve very little external activity-only the second form involves audible sound - the sixth form mentions no internal activity on the part of the guru but only presence, for in his presence all the activities of the mind and indeed the mind itself disappears. It is the supreme penetration since there is no dualism of any sort,not even the dualism of initiate and initiator. 290. Gnoli notes that nanda is the name of one of the five auspicious lunar days. Gnoli, Luce, p.709 footnote 161. He does not elaborate. 291. In 252d.l, Jayaratha mentions only four locations. On the presumption that there must be five locations, perhaps we are further to presume that space itself is a location. There are different combinations of five places for which see TA 19.15b, TA 30.5Sd-59a and Tantrasara p. 199 line 5. 292. A number of interpretations of the term kula-s can be given. In Jr.252d. 1, Jayaratha glosses the term kula-s with the phrase mahakaulakaulakulakulakula which can­not, it seems, be divided except as mahakaula, kaula, akula, kula, kula-akula. This division involves double counting in that kula is first counted separately and then is counted as part of the pair kula-akula. The resulting set of five imitate Jr.223d.l where Kulesvara and Kulesvari are worshipped separately and then to­gether. The kawla, on the basis of Jr.223d.l, would consist of the group of atten­dant deities and the mahakaula would refer to the whole range of deities or man­tras etc. so that the phrase in question refers to the five levels of consciousness. A second line of interpretation is suggested by the phrase kula-kaula-mahdkaula-siddhakaula-adi sasanam which is found in an alchemical text, Rasarnava 1.4b, quoted in David G. White, The Alchemical Body, Siddha Traditions in Medieval India, Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1996, p.421 footnote 77, and is un­derstood to refer to various schools within the Kula tradition. Thirdly, in the Buddhist Tantras generally five kulas or families are referred to, namely Natl, Rajaki, Dombi, Candali and Brahmani. Bagchi, Kaulajnananirnaya, p.66. 293. The six causal deities may be listed as Brahma, Visnu, Rudra, Isvara, Sadasiva and Anasrisiva although the nomenclature varies. In Jr.252d.l, Jayaratha excludes Anasrisiva from the list but without indicating a replacement. 294.

Supreme In the first of the nine forms the guru places the disciple in a mantra which surrounds him as a foetus is surrounded by the womb. The flames release him from the stains or knots and from the karma that hinders him and out of this triangle the disciple is reborn. Although most of the methods of penetration are interior, it seems that menstrual blood is fittingly used here. In the second form, the guru imaginatively concentrates himself as a small ball and by yogic penetration enters the disciple at the very basis of the disciple's being. With all his faculties raised to the highest level of consciousness compatible with some diversity, namely at the level of sakti, vyapini and samana which constitute the sakti spike, the guru moves around the disciple and brings him to conviction. In the fourth penetration, the guru imagines some form, for example the image of a deity, emerging from his forehead where all exists in a concealed state295 and refashions the disciple according to that image. The disciple in turn sees himself as refashioned in that image and becomes the deity itself with all the enjoyments the deity possesses. According to the sixth form, the disciple has three sorts of body or mass (pinda): the gross body of flesh and bones; the subtle body 295.

The guru, by yogic projection, moves along one or other of these channels, for example the eye, and then masters the channel, releasing it from illusion and bringing it to consciousness. For example, the master's glance is initiatory. Ill Supreme Penetration in the Virdvalibhairava sl. 272ab  Enunciation  Examination sl. 272cd-273ab i. The guru sl. 273cd-274ab ii.

This list of three differs from the trio given in Paramarthasara sl.24 which con­sists of stain, maya etc. and body. In Jr.271d.l, Jayaratha notes that the kala of sl.265a are categories 26-31, the coverings (kancuka). 297. Sl.265cd reads: 'The self [which is seen] in the reflection is [in fact] invisible. But it is thought to be visible when it is [seen] in the mirror etc.' A number of texts will help to elucidate this difficult line such as the long section TA 3.1-64 and also TA 13.182ab, Paratrimsikavivarana p.234 lines 19-21, Isvarapratyabhijhavimarsihi, vol.3, p.174, Paramarthasara sl.9. See also Isvarapratyabhijnakarika ii.IV.19 quoted in Silburn, Hymnes de Abhinavagupta, p.35. On the basis of these texts it would seem that the quotation under discussion uses the analogy of a persons' reflection in the mirror in order to describe the subject, means and object of knowledge. The transcendent subject (para) is supreme. The reflection is apara and gross whereas the mirror, the means of knowledge (parapara) is subtle. That is clear enough, but in sl.265cd Abhinava applies that same line to a different context, namely the three levels of the body explained as the coverings, the facul­ties and the flesh, so that Jayaratha has a point in stating, in Jr.271d.l, that the quote is out of context. Yet Abhinava is hardly making a mistake for every ema­nated category is a reflection of its emanator and can be reabsorbed into it. The line in question may be taken as the particular application of a general rule: just as apara and parapara are absorbed into para, so too the gross is absorbed into the subtle and this into the supreme, the supreme being understood here as the five kala. The final absorption into truly supreme Siva is described in sl.271."},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"172  The Kula Ritual of a Son, contemplates the triple trident and goes out of himself from his right into the left of the divinity residing in that trident and leaves the divinity from its right and returns to himself through his left, etc., with the result that a single consciousness shines forth, a single throbbing (aikyasphurattatma). That text and the third and much fuller presentation of supreme penetration according to the Viravalibhairava help explain the circumstances that surround the set of six and the set of nine forms of penetration. Abhinava first describes the guru's preparation for the initiation in which he moves beyond the fluctuation of prana and apana and comes to a knowledge of the centre which governs all. In the process he comes to know all the lesser levels of reality through which he has passed, their deities and mantras.298 The disciple then comes before him as a person might come before the deity or before the triple trident. The guru communicates to him his own being, as a father upon his death bed does to his son.299 The guru communicates all his faculties, including the very highest, nothing less than his 'mouth' which is his sakti300 so that the disciple becomes one with the centre the guru embodies. Since all has been totally communicated, the minds of the guru and disciple experience perfect fusion (samaras!)301 at the highest level, at 298. This sort of experience is described in the Kula tradition of sacrifice connected with the five states, sl.221-223. 299. In her introduction to initiation-by-penetration, Silburn quotes from Kausitaki-Upanisad 11.15 which describes the sacrificial ceremony during which the dying father identifies himself with his son by every part of his body: 'Or else [the fa­ther] can perform the transmission (with the son) sitting before him. He transmits to him, therefore: \"I want to put my voice in you, says the father. -1 receive your voice into myself, says the son, -1 want to place my breath in you, says the father. - I receive your breath into myself, says the son\" (Similarly for sight, hearing, taste, action, pleasure and suffering, procreation, conduct, intellect, and the son receives them ...).' Silburn, La kundalini, pp. 107-108. See also TA 28.296-298. 300. In a quotation from a lost version of the Malinivijayottara-tantra. see Gnoli, II commento, p.115 footnote 347, Abhinava identifies the mouth of the guru with the 'circle of the sakti', viz. yoni, by which Siva emits the world. '... [emission (yisargo)] ... is said to be the mouth of the guru; it is called the 'circle of the sakti'.' Paratrimsikavivarana p.248 lines 20-21. 301. Silburn commonly translates the term by 'of the same flavour throughout', as for example when salt flavours the whole dish or when the two beams of a balance have ceased their oscillation and have become still. Padoux translates this term by 'total fusion, common and / or shared enjoyment'. Le coeur, p.138 footnote 179.

It is a feature, however, of TA 29 that the level of cidananda, the bliss of consciousness, leads on to jagadananda, universal bliss. Accordingly, Abhinava completes his description of initiation-by-penetration by presenting the procedure leading to the initiation of all living beings. It is the highest form of initiation and it grants the highest state of liberation which exceeds all that is available to the causal deities. These govern and enjoy the worlds within their purview but by definition are limited to the lower spheres, their authority is limited, their worlds divided. They rule their subjects but fail to grant them the fullness of Sivahood and so their governance is partial.302 After giving a brief summary of the method, Abhinava gives a more extended description and takes up the fives stages of the subtle breath. The externalisation occurs with the emission of prana which is a darkening (timira), a fragmenting303 of the natural splendour of infinite consciousness, a reduction of infinite subjectivity to the status of a limited self. After an involvement with all the levels of creation and with all the causal deities, the practitioner 302. Padoux, Vac, p. 103. 303.

Sin ipataka) consists not in what others call sin304 but in being ignorant of consciousness so that to eat the forbidden 'oblation' does not cause sin but instead frees one from sin. The sacrifices listed in the Tantrasara include a seventh sacrifice. Tantrasara p.207 line 5 states: The seventh Kula sacrifice, the best of all, is celebrated with respect to the guru's body.' Likewise, the list of supports given in the Tantroccaya mentions 'the body of the guru'. Neither the Tantrasara nor the Tantroccaya, in the sections involved with the Kula ritual, say more on this matter. What is the status of the second ritual which is a 'sacrifice to be celebrated in honour of the guru'? In answer to this question two texts need to be considered. Firstly, in TA 23.24, Abhinava states that a remuneration (daksina) must be given to the guru after the ceremony of consecration. The act of remuneration is called an 'ancillary aspect of the sacrifice' (yaga-angatvam) and should not be confused with the occasional rite called gurupujanam, a point implied in Tantrasara p. 191 lines 5-6. The second text is TA28.423cdff. It describes the gurupujanam or gurupujdvidhih, the ritual of worship of the guru, which should take place the day after the initiation or consecration or an occasional rite. Here the disciple offers the remuneration (daksina) that forms an integral part of the worship of the guru and which should please him personally (tattustaye tvidam, sl.431d). On the basis of those two texts it appears that there are two forms of remuneration: on the one hand the ancillary aspect of sacrifice which forms part of a ritual such as initiation andon the other the gift for personal pleasure which forms part of guru worship. This is borne out by Jr.285b. 1 where Jayaratha states that sl.284-285ab is the ancillary aspect (angatvam) and is not the gift given for personal pleasure (na-tu tat-tusti-karitvam). 304. According to the Smrti there are five great sins: murder of a Brahmana, drinking of alcohol, theft, committing adultery with the wife of one's guru and association with those who have committed such offences.

This listing, which repeats some of the names given in TA 29.52, will help provoke the objection raised in Jr.51d.2. 67. Jayaratha identifies the 'four' of TA 29.51c as referring to the four goddesses of either the Daksina or the Varna schools. The four goddesses of the Daksina school are Suska, Siddha, Utpala, Rakta / Candika. The four goddesses of the Varna school are Jaya, Vijaya, Jayanti and Aparajita."},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"214  The Kula Ritual taken! But this is the opinion of other gurus.

In TA 13, Abhinava discusses the degrees of descent of energy. In his description of the person who has received an 'intense' descent of energy, in TA 13.136-7, Abhinava distinguishes between one person whose intuition is sure (dardhya) and another whose intuition is vacillating (kampa). For the latter type he recommends the use of reasoning, the scripture, a guru, conversation [with the wise], practice, etc. Thus even the recipient of an 'intense' descent of energy may be insecure, his intuition not 'fully established'. Later in TA 13.163ab, while still discussing the intense descent of energy, he quotes the Kiranatantra which makes the following distinction: 'Some are suited to knowledge (jnana) and others are suited to ritual action (carya)'. Thus, two pairs of distinction are being made: the intuition may be sure or vacillating; the intuition may be expressed through knowledge or ritual action. In short, the phrase 'who have not received enlightenment' refers to a person who is not without intuition but who is not secure in the knowledge of his intuition and who expresses his intuition in action.

Do they refer to the supreme penetration, as in Jr.271d.3, or to the state of Siva which is the result of the initiation? Do all these things in fact coincide? The guru has come to know the centre and he sets about bringing the disciple to this highest state.

The term 'devours' links up with the term 'relish' which is the third stage in the fourfold presentation of the Krama cycle. He 'devours' in the sense that he reaches a state which is higher than both liberation or enjoyment and from which both emanate. 228. The term 'etc' refers to the disciple. 229.

To this que-tion he says: The external subtle-breath which goes outside, which, taking on the form of darkness, || 278 || has left through the pores, circulates through all the causal deities. After he has aimlessly made the [external subtle-breath] arrive at a centre, he causes it to [continue to] circulate.

This initiation grants the acquisition of the state of Siva to all living creatures. ║281║ Jr.2Sld.l The 'pouring out' is the external apana and prana, in the sense that it consists of objectivity. When these (apana and nrana] become intent on repose, [the pouring] is the cen­tral [subtle-breath]. Therefore, the form which pours out through the pores, i.e. through the channels in every direction -Qt.281d.l \"There is no sadness prior to duality. Darkness is not due to the state of non-duality.\" Jr.281d.2 - assumes, according to this quote, the appearance of darkness, i.e. the form of the [limited] knowing subject. And, as a result of arresting the upwards movement, [the subtle-breach] circulates in the regions governed by the causal deities such as Brahma etc., i.e. [the limited knowing subject] causes [the subtle-breath] to circulate in those [regions] by abandon­ing and approaching an object of meditation. And, immedi­ately after [the subtle-breath] circulates in this way, he 'emits'."},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"342   The Kula Ritual Then, by means of an upward movement of the union of prana and apana, he pierces the set of five knots which govern the various causes. Then he reflects on the central sacred place, i.e. on the couple, prana and apana, which have become fused, i.e. he becomes closely attentive to that same [central sacred place]. Then he ceases to focus on the combination [of the following aspects] which pertain to the limited self; space, i.e. void; external reality, i.e. external objects such as blue etc.; mind which, since it is the basis of the mirroring [of objects], is a hidden speech; and the body.

The Jayadrathayamala is one of the four basic scriptures of Kashmir Saivism along with the Siddhayogesvarimata, the Tantrasadbhava and the Brahmayamala. Alexis Sanderson, 'Vajrayana: origin and function', in Bud­dhism into the year 2000. International conference proceedings, Bangkok, Dhammakaya Foundation, 1994, p.94. More specifically, it is an agama of the Krama tradition. Sanderson, 'Mandala', p. 197. The work is also known as the Tantrarajabhattaraka. ibid. p.199 footnote 141. For details concerning the manuscript, see ibid, p.205. Further details concerning the manuscript and comments on the place of this work in the canon are also given in Prabodh Chandra Bagchi, Studies in the tantras, Part I, Calcutta, Calcutta University Press, 1939, pp.1-15 and pp.109-114. 6. The Tantrasadbhava belongs to the Trika tradition and is one of the four basic scriptures of Kashmir Saivism. Sanderson, 'Vajrayana', p.94. Sanderson gives the manuscript details in 'Mandala', p.206. Sambhunatha and the Tantras­adbhava are linked in TA 29.212ab and TA 30.99. K.C. Pandey and R.C. Dwivedi hold that Sambhunatha is its author. Rastogi, p.52. 7. Trisiromata appears as a work of the Kula tradition. Padoux, Vac, p.281 and ibid, footnote 166. 8. Is Thohakasa a text? It is not listed in Gnoli, Luce. It is not included in the list of Kubjikamata tantras of the pascimamnaya or Western Transmission given in Dyczkowski, The canon pp. 127-133, or in the index of some 800 titles given in ibid, pp.216-226. 9. The Devipancasatika is an agama of the Krama tradition. Sanderson, 'Mandala', p. 197. For the manuscript details, see ibid. p.206. 10. The Devyaydmala belongs to the Trika but shows its allegiance to the Kali-cult by enthroning Kalsamkarsinf, the highest of the Kalis, as a fourth goddess above the three godesses of the Trika, Para, Parapara and Apara. ibid. p. 194.

The Brahmayamala, alias the Picumata, is one of the four basic scriptures of Kashmir Saivism. Sanderson, 'Vajrayana', p.94. It is the basic Tantra of the cult of Kapalisabhairava and his consort Canda Kapalim and is applicable to all the systems of the Vidyapitha.' ibid. p.94. Seven MSS - all incomplete -are listed in Rastogi, p.254 footnote 8. Details concerning the manuscript and comments on the place of this work in the canon are given in Prabodh Chandra Bagchi, Studies, pp.1-15 and pp.102-105. 12. The Madhavakula is the fourth section of the Jayadrathayamala which is also known as the Tantrarajabhattaraka. Sanderson, 'Mandala', p. 199 footnote 141. Sanderson notes that it 'teaches the cult of a Kali Madhavesvari to be worshipped as the consort of [a form of] Visnu ...', Sanderson, 'Saivism', p.686, and goes on to to connect her with the third form of the Northern Transmission, the cult of Guhyakali. 13. In TA 28.128ab, Abhinava states that the Ratnamala is an agama of the Kula tradition. In Tantraloka vol.2, p.281 line 16, Jayaratha identifies it with the Kularatnamala. 14. Gnoli identifies this text with the Siddhayogesvarimata, Gnoli, Luce, p.699, which is one of the four basic scriptures of Kashmir Saivism. Sanderson, 'Vajrayana', p.94. Also called Siddhamata and Siddhatantra, it 'is probably the earliest and most fundamental of the Trika's scriptures. This work survives, but in what is certainly a much shorter redaction than that known to the Kashmirians.' ibid. p.94.
