PATWARDHAN Abhinavagupta is generally considered to be the greatest of the many Indian writers in the field of poetics. The breadth and profundity of his intellect, and the originality and brilliance of his critical insight, entitle him to a distinguished place in the ranks of philosophers of aesthetics of all lands and all periods of history.This tenth century Kashmiri scholar advanced ideas in every way as interesting and sophisticated as those propounded by Aristotle, yet his work is virtually unknown in the West beyond a very small circle of Sanskritists. It is to remedy this situation by making some of the central insights of Abhinavagupta available to literary critics and the interested layman that the authors offer the present volume. Most of the material they present has never before been translated.The introduction is meant primarily for students of comparative literature and the general reader. The body of the work is divided into two parts. In the first, the authors examine the various in- fluences'which went into the shaping of Abhinava- gupta’s philosophy of aesthetic experience, a unique synthesis of original insights into traditional Indfan poetics with the éaiva philosophy of Kashmir. They deal with[such problems as : the nature of obscenity, the aesthetic enjoyment of tragic literature, the nature of poetic imagination, Tantric rituals as drama, and, above all, the relation between ima­ginative experiences and transcendent mystical experiences. In the second part of the work, the authors reproduce and translate everything written on the subject of sànîarasa ( “ the aesthetic ex­perience of tranquillity ” ) prior to Abhinava­gupta.$ 6.— Rs. 25/—"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"SANTARASAANDABHINAVAGUPTA’S PHILOSOPHY OF AESTHETICS"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"BHANDARKAR ORIENTAL SERIES No. 9SäntarasaANDABHINAVAGUPTA’S PHILOSOPHY OF AESTHETICSBYJ.

M . V. Patwardhan and Mr. J. L.

Renou of the Sorbonne and Prof. D. H. H. Ingalls of Harvard. His asso­ciation with these two scholars explains his association with me./This monograph is on Santa Rasa and Abhinavagupta’s aesthetics as it emerges out o f the philosophy o f Rasa as expounded by him. It stems out of my Number of Rasas which at the time o f its first appearance in the middle of the forties, was the first detailed exposition of this important subject. In that work, 1 had also offered a critical edition of the section relating to the Santa from Abhinavagupta’s commentary on the Nàtya Sàsîra. Naturally, while the material given in the present study has already been known, the treatment of the authors has given it a freshness, illustrating the principles of novelty elucidated by Anandavardhana in Uddyota IV of Dhvanyäloka. As Max Müller said, at every stage, a fresh study of a branch of knowledge is required. In the introduction, as also in the main part of their work, the authors have traversed a wide ground in respect o f literature and response to it, and on the background o f the latest writers, critics and philosophers in the West and the attempts of a few of them to interpret or understand the contributions of the Sanskrit writers, they have highlighted some o f the most important ideas o f Anandavardhana and Abhinavagupta. The thought o f these two masters of Sanskrit literary criticism, particularly o f the latter, is examined on the background of their school of philosophy, Kashmir éaivism. But as they go, the authors take in their stride many other related concepts which involve parenthetical treatment; added to these are the very large number o f references to works and authors, but the reader should be able to follow the main theme of the authors namely the conception o f Rasàsvâda as elucidated by the two great aesthetes Anandavardhana and Abhinavagupta.It would not be possible to fall in line whith the authors on some o f the literary judgements that they have passed on Sanskrit poems and plays, e. g. those on p. ix of the Introduction.

W e have both been long interested in Sanskrit literary criticism. Professor Patwardhan has taught the Dhvany dioica and the Rasagangätlhaoxi over a period of fifteen years to students in F ergusson College. Mr. Masson has translated and annotated the Dhvanyäloka and the first chapter of the Locano for his Ph. D. thesis at Harvard.• When we met we discovered a deep mutual interest in-Abhi- navagupta’s Locano,, the greatest Indian work on aesthetics, but a text so difficult that even the Pandits hesitate to teach it in the Päthasäläs. W e began meeting twice a week for 3-4 hour sessions to read and discuss textual difficulties in the Locano. W e soon found that we shared nearly identical views on the major problems in this work. Gradually most of the textual mysteries began to yield up their secrets, and we decided to translate the entire Locano, as a joint work.The section on éântarasa was originally to have been ah appendix to this three-volume annotated translation. But we found that so many issues in the Locaiva had a direct bearing on the problem of éântarasa that it really required a more extensive and separate treatment. Especially in reading the s'ântamsa passage in the Abhinavabhärati, a text of notorious difficulty, we found that our readings in the Locano, were a great help to its elucidation. It is primarily as an aid to understanding this säntarasa passage of thé Abhinavabhärati that we are publishing the results of our research.

It might be asked why we use the term “ (esthetics” in the title when surely “ poetics” would have been more correct* since aesthetics is a wider concept, including reflections on the experience of the beAutiful in a11 Art forms, and not only in literature. This would be true were we to confine our attention only to the Dhtanyàlokalocand. But the Abbina cabhàratì iucludes considerations of music and of dnnce as well as of litera­ture, and it is clear, even if nowhere explicitly stated, that Abbinava intends his remarks, on the nature of imaginative experiences in dramu and poetry to apply to other art forms as well. If we were to sum up Abhinava’s theory iu one phrase as “ great art demands the transcendence of self” then we could surely apply this to music as well.2. We presuppose on the part of our readers a certain familiarity with the technical terms of Sanskrit poetics. Forthose who are reading about the field for the first time, we would recommend the following works :For a general introduction to Sanskrit poetry the reader cannot do better than read D. H. H. Ingalls’ humane study i An anthology of Sanskrit Court Poetry Harvard Oriental Series, Cambridge, 1963. The two standard works on Sanskrit literary criticism are : S. K. De, History of Sanskrit Poetics, Firma K. L. Mukhopadbyaya, Calcutta, 1960, and P. V. Kane, History of Sanskrit Poeties, Motilal Banarsidass, Delhi, 1961. Kane is better than De on textual problems, but less full on the actual theories. A concise bub intelligent overview of the theory of suggestion can be found in an article by J. Brough, “ Some Indian Theories of Meaning” , Transactions of the Philological Society, 1933, Oxford. An excellent book, which contains a very fine chapter on the theory of dhvani is K. Kunjunni Raja, Indian Theories of Meaning, Adyar Library and Research Center, Madras, 1963. A clear account by a good modern Indian philosopher of many of the issues will be found in M. Hiriyana’s Art Experience, a collection of his essays on such questions as “ Art contemplation”, “ Art and Morality”, “ The Philosohhy of Æsthetic Pleasure” and so on, Kavyalaya Publishers, Mysore, 1954. For those who read French, we would recommend the pioneer study of the Indian theatre by Sylvain Levi, Le Théâtre Indien, reprinted with Renon’s article, “ La Recherche sur le théâtre Indien depuis 1890”, Paris, 1963. The Introduction to R. Gnoli’s The Aesthetic Experieiice according to Abhinaragupta} Rome, 1965 and now reprinted by Chowkhamba, Banaras, 1968, is excellent, though readers might find the actual text difficult. K. C. Pandey’a two works, Abhinavagupta, an Historical and Philosophical Study Chowkhamba, Banaras, 1966, and Comparative Aesthetics, vol. I, Indian Aesthetics (both second editions), Chowkhamba, Banaras, 1959, are also likely to prove difficult, though both works contain much valuable information. The reader would also be well advised to read one or two of the texts in translation. The most important work on theatre and on dramatic theory is the Nâtyakâtra ( ca. 3rd century a. d. ? ) of which there is a new edition and trans­lation by M. UhosL, Maqisha Granthalaya, Calcutta, 1957.

Their writings could extend our conceptual armoury ” .1 While we agree with the sentiment, we disagree strongly with the method. In an article subtitled : “ A Study in Indian Aeshetics ” , there is no mention o f a single Indian critic ! One could contribute an entire negative bibliography on Sanskrit poetics which would illustrate the same fault : an insufficient acquata* tance with the basic texts of Sanskrit literary criticism. Instead of vague generalisations ( or reinterpretations such as are found in the special issue o f the Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism on Oriental Aesthetics, Fall, 1965), we need detailed studies* 1 2 and especially translations into modern English o f the major works of Sanskrit æsthestics. It is disturbing to think that there are no English translations at all of many of the most important works : the Vakrotkij'ivita, the Kävyamlmämsä, the Abhinavabhàratï, the Dhvanyäloka- locano, the Vyaktiviveka or the Rasagahgädhara.3 There is no readily availa­ble translation o f Dandin, or Bhàmaha, or Vàmana, and Ànandavardhana’s Dhvanyäloka is sorely in need of a new and better translation. We know that the Indians have creative ideas on such important issues as “ the natureContinued from previous paye )rare : The Dhranyäloka the most important text on poetics will soon be published with a complete translation of Abhinavagupta’s commentary, the Locana, by the authors. Meanwhile there is Jacobi’s excellent German translation, Z. D. M, O, no. 56, Leipzig, 1902 and the translation into English by K. Krishnamoorthy, Poona Oriental Series, Poona, 1965. There is a French translation of Rfijaéekhara’s Kâvya* mimànisâ ( 9th oentury ), a fascinating and eccentric work, by N. Stchoupak and L, Renou published by Société Asiatique in 1946 that is still in print. The second most important work on drama, though much later ( 10th century) than the Nâtya- éàstra9 has been translated by G. 0. Haas, The Dakarüpaha of Dhanamjaya : A Treatise of Hindu Dramaturgy, Motilal Banarasidass, Delhi, 1962. A good translation of Mammata’s Kdnyaprakâêa ( 11th century) has come out by G. Jba, Bharatiya Vidya Praka8han, Banaras, 1967. Mammala follows Abhinava very closely, though he is more conventional in his opinions. It ie by far the best of the “ text books” that became so popular in the Sanskrit tradition. Similar to it, and even fuller in treatment, though less interesting, is the Sâhityadarpana of Visvanâtha, translated by J. R. Ballantyne and P. Misra, Motilal Banarasidass, Delhi, I960. An excellent and readable French translation of one of the later texts is Le Pratâparudriya de Vidyâ• nâtha by Pierre Filliozat, Institut Français d ’ indologie, Pondichéry, 1963.1. “ An Exalted Theory of Ornament”, published in Aesthetics in the Modern World, edited by H.

For details, see Bibliography.3. A four-volume work is soon to appear on readings from literary criticism throughout the world. One volume will be devoted to Indian Aesthetics. It is being edited by B. K. Matilal of the University of Pennsylvania and will contain translations of all the major texts (excerpts only of course) by B, K. Matilal, V, Raghavan, M. Ghosh, M.

But what exactly did the Indian writers have to say on each of these issues ? We have taken up one of these issues, käntarasa, for detailed discussion in this volume.Säntarasa might be translated as “ the imaginative experience of tranqui­lity ” . It is an issue on which there exists some confusion. Edgerton was ableto write, astonishingly, of käntarasa : \"___that it is forbidden to use it in thedrama ; it is inherently opposed to the very nature of the drama ” .1 This is a simple misunderstanding of the texts. Such misunderstandings arise because many modern writers are not taking the trouble to see just what the Sanskrit writers on poetics have said. They are relying on secondary literature instead of going directly to the original sources. In this way errors only compound themselves. How will one be able to appreciate Sanskrit literature properly if one is unware of just what it is that a cultivated audience expected from its literature? And how can one know this,unless one reads Sanskrit literary criti­cism ? Here we must take sides in what seems to us a major issue concerning the proper method of understanding Sanskrit poetry : Professor D. H. H, Ingalls has written of A. B. Keith, whose two works, “ A History of Sanskrit Literature ” and “ The Sanskrit Drama ” are standard reading in the field, “ that for the most part he disliked Sanskrit literature.” After illustrating this, Professor Ingalls remarks : “ What is unjust in these judgments is that not once does Keith apply the remarks of a Sanskrit critic to any of the Sanskrit works he is judging. ” 1 2 Professor J. Brough, a former student of Keith, responds to this criticism by quoting a paragraph from Keith’s “ History of Sanskrit Literature ” , after which he remarks : “ I have re-read this paragraph with close attention, but I have not been able to discover any hidden meaning in it ; and 1 do not understand how such words could be written by one who 4 for the most part disliked Sanskrit literature. ’ ” 3 Professor Brough may well be correct, for it is perfectly possible that Keith did in fact like much of Sanskrit literature. But surely this is irrelevant. The point is not whether Keith did or did not like Sanskrit poetry ( since one can certainly understand something for which one does not have great admiration ), but whether he understood it or not. Brough does not answer Ingalls’ second charge, by far the more important of the two. Did Keith judge Sanskrit literature accord­ing to the highly developed canons of its own texts on literary criticism ?1. F. Edgerfcou, “ Indirect Suggestion in Poetry ”, Proc. of the American Philoaophicul Society, voi. 76, 1936, p. 704.2. An Anlholoyy of Sanskrit Court Poetry, p. 503. J. Brough, Poems from the Sanskrit, Penguin, 1968, p. 21."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"tvJudging from his chapter on the theories of poetry in ancient India, one?^would guess not. He seems for the most part innocent of their more detailed doctrines.1 This is an important point of methodology. Before we can judge or even appreciate Sanskrit literature, we must understand it. As I. A. Richards often remarked to his students at Harvard : “ We do not admire what we do not understand. ” No amount of theory on methodology will 'help one to understand Sanskrit literature. There is only one method that counts : exposure to, and familiarility with, the texts. There is a perfectly ^straight-forward use of the word “ understanding ” which is too often ignored• in the elaborate treatises now fashionable on “ methodology ” ( often, it seems Ho us, merely excuses for not dealing with the texts themselves ). The difficul­ties of interpreting a Sanskrit poem are considerably less in India than in the 'West. The meaning of a Sanskrit poem is rarely subjective. Either you have• understood a verse or you haven’t. In a traditional Sanskrit class, the Pandit will ask a student after he has read a verse : artho jrnto va na vä, “ Havecyou understood the meaning or not ? ” This makes it far more easy to reach •a concensus about a poem’s worth in Sanskrit than would be true in English literature.2 When we read a passage in one of these Sanskrit texts we knowV* . . 1. For instance, on p. 38G-397 of A History aj Sanskrit Literature, ( Oxford ^1928) Keith is supposed to be explaining the thoories of Jagannâtha’s Rasagantjü- 'dhara, but everything he quotes is actually taken by Jagannätha from Abhinava- 'gupta’s Locana, a fact of which Keith seems totally unaware. Thus, he writes : “ The ; causo of this form of pleasure is a form of meditation {bhâeanâ ), consisting of continued » application to the object characterized by the pleasure. It is quite different from the joy produced by the thought of the meaning of what is said to one, e. g. “ A son is ubòrn to you But this example actually occurs several times in the Dhranyâloka- 'locanti, ( e. g. p. 80, Bälapriyä Edn. ) 600 years earlier 1L 2. Not that the Indians ever made the fallacy of thinking that a poem was•.exhausted by what it meant. Far from it, thoy were likely to sin in the opposite ^direction, and suppose that a poem derived all its worth from how it was said ( vyafljami ) rather than what it said. As I. A. Richards puts it : “ It is never what a poem says which matters, but what it is ”. John Wain speaks of the difficulty of pin­pointing the elements in a poem that make for its success : “ But to illustrate these . things in the concrete is to approach the vanishing center of literary criticism, which, , not being an exact science, is bound sooner or later to reach a point at which demon­stration breaks down and is replaced by a shared sensibility; though, of course, '-this point is very much more distant than the anti-critical writers on literature *; would have us think”, Interpretations, edited by J. Wain, Routledge, London, 1956. For the Indians it was not only distant, but actually beyoud the horizon. This is an important point to stress : the Indians simply cannot conceive of arguing ovor the •final worth or even interpretation of a poem in quite the same way as can be done to­day in Western literary criticism. It is of course true that finally the sahrdaya, the , intelligent and responsive reader, is the final criterion. But generally, sahrdayas tend to agree amongst themselves to an astonishing degree. One has only to look at the interpretations of poems advancod in Sanskrit commentaries. They are usually very( Continued on next paye"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTIONimmediately whether we understand it or not. If we do not, no amount o f “ methodology ” will give us instant and magic insight into the meaning. It is only by reading further in the literature that understanding will be gained.* We feel that we have to speak of this because in a sense we are deal­ing with religious material, and the familiar criticism comes to mind that in order to understand Buddhism one must either be a Buddhist or at least be­long to some religious tradition. Similarly, the argument goes, one must be “ personally ” concerned with the problems raised by säntarasa and by religious ecstasy in general in order to understand the issues properly. To this belief we cannot subscribe. We can sympathise intellectually with the problems raised by säntarasa without being personally moved by the issues in our everyday life. Certainly to have a profound understanding of Dante it is not necessary to be a believing Christian. We can respond to the power and grace o f a mind without necessarily agreeing with what is said. Were it necessaryj to hold firmly to a set of immovable beliefs, then the whole of surrealism, in which our common expectations are constantly arrested, should possess no aesthetic significance. Literature does not depend for its power on a set o f beliefs. Is the ghost of Hamlet real ? How can this matter for a proper appreciation o f the play ? The important point is that it is real for the play. Are the punishments that Dante describes “ real ” ? They are real in the .poem. Whether we believe in their objective reality or not has nothing what­ever to do with our appreciation of the poem itself. Similarly, säntarasa exists within the context in which we discuss it. We must judge these beliefs in the context o f the works o f literature in which they appear, and not in the light of our personal convictions, or we seriously restrict the possibilities of our own literary appreciation. We have elucidated certain difficult texts which describe ecstatic experiences. It should not be relevant what our own belief is as to the objective nature of these experiences.A more important dichotomy than that between belief and scepticism has to do more directly with our method o f work. This is the dichotomy between modern Western methods and the more traditional method o f under-Continued, from previous page )similar to one uuother. ( This is surely why plagiarism in such matters was never considered to lie a serious matter. Witness Heinaeandra, who uses Abbinava’« expia* nations of innumerable stanzas. He is not “ cheating ”, he is “ agreeing ”. ) When a modern commentary like the Bàlapriyâ follows Uttungodaya’s Kaumndi on the Locanay Räinagäruka is not being lazy or dishonest. This simply points to shared values in Sanskrit literary criticism. We know, for example, that MahimabkaUa and Kuntaka both disagree sharply with the views of the dhoani school, and with Ânandavardhana in particular. But their disagreements concern principles, and do not really extend to the interpretation of individual poems. When they explain the rasa of a poom there is remarkable agreement.•V"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"ftstanding texts used by the Pandits. There need exist no opposition between the two methods. In our cases, we have both profited greatly from our study among the Sàstrins, and we both possess an unqualified admiration for the depth o f their knowledge into a given kàstra.

Pandits will often say of him that : alamkàrakàstram tenaiva sàstratvam pràpitam—“ He alone turned poetics into a science. ” There are virtually no important ideas in later Sanskrit poetics that do not derive from him (o r from his influ­ences )*. In his two famous commentaries, the Locana on the Dhvanyàloka, and the Abhinavabhàratì on the Nàtyakàstra, he has dealt with almost every important issue of Indian aesthetics. Neither work is meant to be primarily philosophic—he deals rather with specific verses, and especially in the Locana he performs brilliant feats of understanding and interpretation in discovering the hidden “ suggested ” meaning in verses. ( There are numerous examples o f this ; one thinks in particular of the enormous range of suggestion he is able to derive from a single case of vastudhvani in the Dhvanyàloka )1 2 3 * * *. His linguistic acumen is no less astonishing, and he often points to the suggestive use of a case-ending, or even a particle. But we are concerned in this volume with those passages, by no means rare, where he deals more with theory than with its practical application. In extracting Abhinava’s philosophy of aesthetics, we have discovered that he is deeply concerned with religious Values in literature. In this he marks a decided break with his predecessors. There is nothing particular religious about the Nàtyasàstra. As for the Dhvanyàloka, which we believe to be the work of two different authors,8 the1. Many of the ideas of later writers (especially Mamma ta ) which modero writers mistakenly think to he original, derive ultimately and often literally from Abhinavagupta. Thus S. K. He, “ The theory of Rasa ”, in Some Problems of Sanskrit Poetics, Calcutta, 1059, p. 200, attributes to Viévanâtha the doctriue that “ those verythings which are called cause of pain in the iworld......when consgined to poetry anddramatic representation possess the right to be called, in consequence of their assuming euch a function, alanhika ribhävas etc., and from them only pleasure ousues, as it does from bites and the like in amorous dalliance”. But this doctrine is found first in the Abhindrabhdrati, Voi. 1, p. 202.2.

There are no religious terms used, and no analogies drawn from religious literature. Even the term säntarasa is never used.1 Änandavardhana is a different matter. In his Vftti religious preoccupations are evident. Unfortunately, his Tattväloka* a work that dealt with the relation between poetry and philosophy, is lost, so that we cannot know how great its influence upon Abhinava was. At least his concerns within the Dhvanyâloka never culminate in a philosophic theory. It is only with Abhinava himself ( preceded, in all likelihood, by Bhattanäyaka in his lost Hrdayadarpana) that specific religious doctrines are applied to aesthetics ( we do not o f course distinguish sharply between religion and philosophy, for in Abhinava’s case, as in much Indian writing, the two are nearly coterminous ).Abhinava is concerned with providing a stable philosophical founda­tion for his theories. We have tried to show in this volume how often Abhinava draws on säntarasa for his major contribution to Sanskrit aesthe­tics, the theory of rasa. Reduced to its bare essentials the theory is as follows : watching a play or reading a poem for the sensitive reader (sahrdaya) entails a loss o f the sense of present time and space. All worldly considera­tions for the time being cease. Since we are not indifferent ( tatastha) to what is taking place, our involvement must be o f a purer variety than we normally experience. We arc not directly and personally involved, so the usual medley o f desires and anxieties dissolve. Our hearts respond sympatheti­cally ( hrdayasammda ) but not selfishly. Finally the response becomes total, all-engrossing, and we identify with the situation depicted ( tanmayibhavana ), The ego is transcended, and for the duration of the aesthetic experience, the normal waking “ I ” is suspended. Once this actually happens, we suddenly find that our responses are not like anything we have hitherto experienced, for now that all normal emotions are gone, now that the hard knot o f “ selfness” has been untied, we find ourselves in an unprecedented state o f mental and emotional calm. The purity of our emotion and the intensity of it take us to a higher level o f pleasure than we could know before - we experience sheer undifferentiated bliss (änandaikaghana) for we have come into direct contact with the deepest recesses o f our own unconscious where the memory 1 21.

Änamla, however, does interpret III. 30 ( p. 397 ) to be a reference to Säntarasa, but it is possible that he has misinterpreted the verse.2.

Inadvertent­ly, says Abhinavagupta, we have arrived at the same inner terrain as that occupied by the mystic, though our aim was very different from his. Such an experience cannot but make us impatient with the ordinary turmoil of emotions that is our inner life, and though Abhinava never explicitly says so, one cannot help feeling that he expects the reader to search out now these experiences on a more permanent basis.t We would be justified in asking why Abhinava felt it necessary to provide such a unified theory of rasa ( when Ànandavardhana for instance never felt the need to philosophise about rasa ), and especially a theory that depended so heavily on notions involving kàntarasa. We think there is a good reason : as a religious man, Abhinava must have been under a certain amount of at least internal pressure to justify his deep interest in purely secular literature. There has always been among Indian philosophers ( and Western ones too; one thinks of Plato )l a certain distrust of poetry. There is the attack of Jayantabhatta, the great logician, on Änandavardhana’s theory of suggestion : “ There is no point in arguing with poets, ” 2 or the famous remark with which Mîmâmsakas3 were known to rebuke those interested in poetry : “ One should avoid the useless prattle that is poetry.’*4 Abhinava undermined such opposition by attempting to show that the states of mind during religious experiences and during literary experiences bore a basic affinity to one another. Literature, he wished to prove, at least the best literature, is just one more expression of an ineffable transcendent experi­ence. This was a daring move and one which might legitimately have been expected earlier.5 It is rather odd when one considers it, that nobody before1.

Perhaps it was because the philosophical atmosphere of Kashmir Saivism was so saturated with literature : we have only to glance at any single page of the Yogaväsistha to see how true this is. The most philosophic texts from this school bristle with terms taken from literature and literary criticism, just as conversely a work like the Dhvanyàloka is rich in philosophical impli­cations and learning. For the Kashmir Saivas generally, with their interest in Tantric ritual, sexual pleasure, indeed, aesthetic pleasure in general, was much less repugnant to them than it was to the Advaita tradition ( though we must not exaggerate this either, for did not the orthodox tradition itself ascribe to Sankara the Amarusatakal).What are the advantages that such a theory provides for Sanskrit literature ? They are many. ( 1 ) Such a philosophical justification must have helped to explain to Abhinava himself the nature of his interest in Sanskrit kàvya. If, as Kafka said, poetry should be a pick-axe to free the sea frozen within us, then most of Sanskrit poetry fails utterly. Most kàvya cannot reach us in our most primitive minds the way that Proust, or* Lawrence, or Joyce can. In reading through the Dhvanyàloka, one is struck- by the disparity between the theory and the literature to which it is applied. The poems themselves do not represent values more universal than their time. But the refined and subtle theories which Änandavardhana employs, clearly do. For a modern scholar, it is easier to view these principles sub specie aetemitatis than to do so with the literature which illustrates them. The doctrine, oddly enough, is not significant merely as cultural anthropology, whereas many of the poems can only interest us for reasons other than their literary appeal. Abhinava surprises us by ascribing the fault to us and not to the poetry. He could hardly have been unaware of this more or less un­spoken complaint of sensitive critics, that a certain amount of Sanskrit poetry was mere trivia. The criticism would apply equally to Sanskrit plays. If we demand of our best literature transcendence, then these works seem to fail us. But Abhinava, in order to prove the lack o f sensitivity in such a view, uses a very new argument : he brings in the example of sàntarasa. The one thing that sàntarasa does that no other rasa can, is that it disturbs us. If we really believe the message that any successful play dealing with sàntarasa tells us, we hear what Rilke said was the final lesson of all great literature : “ You must change your life.” By powerful arguments, Abhinava attempts to show that this quality of transcendence, which we must admit in sàntarasa ( though his critics of course did not ), applies equally well to good literature. The greatest example, which Änanda was apparently the first critic in Sanskrit literature to notice, is the Mahàbhàrata. Before Änanda nobody ever consider- U"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"X5TFÏITOed the possibility of looking at a piece o f literature as a unified whole, with a single dominant suggestive atmosphere, and certainly not something of such gigantic proportions as the Mahàbhàrata. But both Ananda and following him, Abhinava, insist on the overwhelming experience that reading the Maha- bhärata provides. As unhappiness and doom succeed one another in a seem­ingly endless display of the vanity o f this world; as we slowly become aware of the folly o f trusting to the external world to bring happiness ; as one after another the heroes of the epic whom we have come to know over volumes and volumes fade from existence and everything seems to dessicate and near its end, the reader is invaded by a sense o f doom, a sense of the uselessness o f strife, and he is eventually instilled with a craving for tranquillity, for an end to human suffering and misery. If our reading is extensive enough, concen­trated enough, with no distractions from the outside world, then we can induce in ourselves a profound imaginative experience of tranquillity, sàntarasa. The Mahàbhàrata remains for Sanskrit literary critics the supreme example of this mood, this imaginative creation. It is not surprising that Ananda is at his most eloquent when he describes this experience in great detail in the fourth Uddyota of his Dhvanyàloka. The passage was clearly a powerful influence in Abhinava’s theories.( 2 ) If Abhinava was struck by the poverty of much Indian kàvya ( which, through a reinterpretation o f its purpose, he felt need no longer be considered trivial ), he must have been equally disturbed by the lifeless quality of much Indian philosophy. By eschewing the real world, it often found it­self in the arid territory of the purely theoretic, with no tap-root leading into the rich soil of real life as it is lived by men and women in a real world. An English literary critic has recently berated this arid quality in surrealism : “ .. reading surrealistic books, as in talking to hermits, one is often struck by the impoverishment of fantasy when not continually cross-pollinated by the external world. Paradoxically, fantasy is not enriched, but etiolated by resolute subjectivism. Ml Abhinava, by importing literary issues into philosophy, was able to provide philosophical thinking with a literary quality it previously lacked. Aesthetics now becomes a legitimate concern for the philosopher.( 3 ) Abhinava discovered that great poems such as the Mahàbhàrata, reach us beyond the conscious mind. One is reminded of Freud’s great study of Leonardo, when he speaks of the effeminate forms o f Leonardo’s “ John the Baptist ” and “ Bacchus ” : “ They are beautiful youths o f feminine delicacy and with effeminate forms; they do not cast their eyes down, but 11.

The familiar smile of fascination leads one to guess that it is a secret of love.” 1( 4 ) Abhinava was not only a philosopher, he was also an authority on Tantric ritual. The rites he practised, probably even before he became interested in literary theory, must have provided him with his first contact with the kind of play-activity that he later found once again in the theatre. It seems to us no accident that Abhinava was more fond of the theatre than of any other form of literature. By establishing the intimate connection between theatre and ritual ( and thus by implication mythology as well ), Abhinava foreshadowed certain modern theories, even though he was not followed in this brilliant insight by any of his successors. The ramifications are many, and Abhinava often draws them in scattered places throughout his works. He is fond o f the comparison o f life with a drama and the resultant sense of unreality this gives. Dreams come up again and again in his works. In his Tanlraloka he speaks of man, the creator, as destroying the produce of his life, a dream. The external buildings, he says, are razed in the fire of his sudden awareness that he is Siva, the great destroyer. Then follows the purely joy-filled dance of Siva, the Tandava, that has no purpose other than to give expression to a sense o f freedom and joy.1 2 On the other hand, one feels that Abhinava was not unaware o f the enrichment that results from imaginative experiences. Even one’s own childhood becomes an aesthe­tic object, something viewed with the dual detachment and involvement ( hrdayànuprave'sa, or hrdayasamvàda) o f the perfect spectator, the sahrdaya who is both moved and yet distanced from the object he contemplates. Has Abhinava in fact had an insight into the unconscious, and the value of imagi­native understanding which Freud stressed as being essential to any true freedom from our own childhood traumas ?( 5 ) Abhinava is able to restore to poets an important place in the intellectual hierachy by showing their underlying philosophical seriousness. One thinks he would have approved o f Andre Malraux’s comment : “ Les grands artistes ne sont pas les transcripteurs du monde ; ils en sont les rivaux. '* An advantage which might well pass unnoticed that Abhinava’s system provides is the following : in Indian society, curiously enough, it was always the religious mystic who has been considered the maverick, who has been allowed the eccentric freedom that in the West we tend to associate with1.

Edmund Wilson, in “ The Wound and the Bow documents the i neurotic elements in many of the great poets of the nineteenth and twentieth century. The striking phrase of the title refers to the myth of Philoctetes, the Greek warrior who possessed a magic bow, but was forced to live in isolation on an island because of the insufferable odour that emanated from a suppurating wound on his ankle. Eventually his country­men had to call him back, in spite of their disgust, because of his un­erring weapon. Art extracts its own price. Of course in India the mystic was never both loathed and venerated, he was simply venerated. Nonetheless already in the Upanisads we hear of the mystic as being similar to a child in his unrestrained behaviour.1 The adjective sometimes applied to him is unmatta, mad. One thinks of the extraordinary passage in the Chändogya Upanisad dealing with Raikva of the cart, who dares to call King Janaka but a sudra, and who finally agrees to teach him for the pretty face of his daughter. He received his name from where he lived, underneath a cart. This has not generally been true of the artist. The poet has always been far more integrat-* ed into Indian society. India has not developed the sense of the loneliness of the writer, shunned by, and shunning, society. But Abhinava, by restor­ing to him his more important functions, also enables him to preserve his independence. It is now not only the mystic who opens himself to numinous experience. Is it significant that the only description of the poet as a man* out of his ordinary senses that immediately comes to mind is from Uttungo- daya, Abhinava’s commentator, in his fourteenth century commentary on the Locana, the Kaumudi ? There he says of the poet : “ ... the poet wants to write poetry in order to instruct those of delicate minds, people who are for- the most part similar to princes, in the means of attaining the four goals of life through aesthetic enjoyment. First, by the stream that is rasa, to be aesthetically enjoyed by the presentation of the vibhàvas etc. that are at the root of the poem he wishes to make, his own heart which is like a great and , immeasurably deep lake ( o f rasa) becomes filled, then he becomes as if possessed by a planet, as if mad, and finally he pours out his poetry, and turns the listener, the sensitive reader ( sahrdaya ), into the same ( sort oi madman as he has become ). ” 2 But of course the artist is never in Sanskril1.

Even in the legend of his death, how he entered a cave with twelve hundred disciples and never returned, there is nothing “ asocial ” to shock the Indian.( 6 ) One corollary of his theories, though again it does not seem to have been realised either by Abhinava or by his successors, is that rasa becomes available not only to poetry and the theatre but to all literature. Generally rasa is only possible in kavya or nàtya. But the Mahàbhàrala is after all already an exception since it cannot be considered kävya in the strict definition of the term. Yet both Ananda and Abhinava give it the careful literary attention it deserves. The claim was made by Kalhana at the beginning of his Raja- tarangini that his work on history contains säntarasa :“ Considering how the life of creatures cracks after a few moments, one should understand ( why ) säntarasa has been given the most impor­tant position in this work ( atra ). ” 1It is all the more surprising then that Abhinava never thought of extending his theory to purely religious texts. After all the most obvious and in a sense the best examples o f säntarasa are to be found in religious and philosophical literature, and not in belles lettres. The Upanisads. for example, would surely have provided Abhinava with his finest examples. Today we can consider the Upanisads to be among the finest examples of world “ litera­ture ” , though no text on literary criticism in ancient India ever thought o f quoting them or deriving support from any o f their beautiful lines. As the rhetoricians define literature, the Upanisads do not qualify. Abhinava’s brilliant insight that what makes for literatureis the quality of the sentiment and not adherence to formal rules, provided the opportunity for a re-definition that was curiously never taken advantage of. Even Jagannàtha Panditaraja, who gives a more liberal definition of literature,2 does not depart from standard examples in his illustrations ( indeed he even regresses in including only his own works, thus furthering the greatest single misfortune of Sanskrit literary criticism, the divorce between what actually was written and what was supposed to be written ). No better example of säntarasa could be found). litljataranyirn, 1.23, 4 (Viéva Bandhu’s edition, Hosbiarpur, 19-^3 ) :2.

Or even such prosaic but haunting lines as that of King Janaka when his kingdom went up in flames : miihilàyàm pradïptayàm na me kimcana dahyate—' ‘ Nothing of mine is burned when Mithilà is in flames.” 1( 7 ) Abhinava insists on the epiphany that poetry provides, on the sense of camatkàra, of having our breath taken away. He compares it at one place“ to a wondrous flower that suddenly bursts into bloom. He is parti­cularly fond of a fine image in the Nàtycsàstra :“ The externalisation ( bhàva ) of that emotion ( artha ) which makes an appeal to the heart is the source ( udbhava ) of rasa. The body it suffused by it, as dry wood is suffused by fire. ” 3( 8 ) An advantage that Abhinava’s philosophy provides for Sanskrit literary criticism is that there need be no disagreements over significant lite­rary experiences. Since the emotional experience in great literature is for Abhinava and later critics who follow him ( Mammata, Vis'vanâtha, Jagan- nàtha, etc. ) always the same, namely àtmànanda, 47 the bliss of the self” , an insoluble problem for Western literature has been solved. The problem is that there is no guarantee that two spectators fed the same thing when view­ing a work of art. To say 74 it depresses m e” or “ it thrills m e” , or 44 it excites me ” , is often a comment on the viewer’s own state of mind and not on the work of art itself. Usually it is discovered in later conversation that the work of art has acted as a catalyst, releasing some emotion long consci­ously forgotten, dislodging it from its undercover. One might object that Abhinava too is no longer speaking about the work of art on its own, but about certain universal states of mind. This is true, but at least, if all literajy critics accept that this is the true function of literature, namely to induce such a state of euphoria, then they have a common ground on which to argue whether a particular piece of literature has been successful or not. And in fact it is astonishing to note how great a concensus of opinion there is in Sanskrit literature over what is good. The concensus lasts over the centuries. There are few poets who have been considered great in the tradi­tion long ago, but now forgotten. If one looks through the names of poets that Abhinava constantly quotes, one is struck by how many o f these are poets we still read and admire today, 1000 years later. We are all aware how1.

Goethe is reported to have said that he found 44 the Inferno abominable, the Purgatorio dubious and the Paradiso tiresome. ” One thinks too of Donne, eclipsed for three centuries and only restored to honour through the critical efforts of T. S. Eliot. Such ups and downs in Sanskrit literature are more or less impossible. ( There are of course other reasons for this as well. )These are just some of the more general results of Abhinava’s theories. The details will be found in the body of this work. We think it is clear that the way for later writers on poetics to expand on religious and philosophical themes was provided by Abhinava. ( Surely, for example, the Bengal Vaisnavas, especially the two Gosvâmins, were inspired to their elaborate theories by the climate Abhinava created ). Abhinava’s final theory bears a1 remarkable similarity to what Aldous Huxley developed in his work “ The Doors of Perception H. Osborne writes of this work as follows : 4£ Finally it is sometimes asserted that works of art symbolize a metaphysical reality of which by our appreciative commerce with the work of art we become directly and immediately aware. This is a view which many modern artists have themselves alleged. In his essay “ The Doors of Perception ” Aldoux Huxley describes how under the influence of mescalin his ordinary perceptions were accompanied by an intense and inescapable feeling of revelation. He develops the theory that artistic vision in general has this revelatory character and that the works of art which artists create communicate to us imperfectly the revelation of ultimate reality which they have enjoyed. ' What the rest of us see only under the influence of mescalin \\ he says, 4 the artist is congenitallyequipped to see all the time___It is a knowledge of the intrinsic significanceof every existent. For the artist as for the mescalin taker, draperies are living hieroglyphs that stand in some peculiarly expressive way for the unfathom­able mystery o f pure being The statement that in the act of appreciating a beautiful work of art we have immediate intuitive awareness of ultimate or pure being, takes us outside the confines of aesthetics proper. As £ emotive * descriptions of the artistic experience such affirmations are significant and must be treated with respect ” .AWe have seen some of the advantages that Abhinava’s philosophy provided for literary criticism, all of which derive from his brilliant insights into what lay behind imaginative experiences in literature. Let us now look far more briefly ( for they are less important ) at some of the disadvantages. The chief danger, it seems to us, is the reductionism in his theories; how all1. u Aesthetics as a Branch of Philosophy ” by Ruth Saw and Harold Osborne, p. 31, in “ Aesthetic* in the Modern World ”, London, 1068,"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"XVTÇTFrRTTliterature becomes reduced to a single experience. A similar criticism has been made of Coleridge : “ Coleridge’s demand for unification and harmony entailed the conversion o f the poetic into something other than the poetic, its subordination to philosophy and ultimately to religion ’V Perhaps the reason, in Abhinava’s case, was that he was not himself a very good poet. He did of course write a good deal of poetry, but there are at the most three or four memorable verses in all of his work,* 2 and his poetry goes virtually unquoted in later critical literature. Perhaps he was prevented by his own intelligence from being direct and concrete.3 Had he been more of a poet, and more interested in the particular, would he have preached quite so reductionist a theory ? There are of course advantages to this ( a unified theory for one ) but it means forgetting what I. A, Richards has taught a generation of literary critics, namely that “ a poem does not stand for something else” .4 Abhinava’s strength lay in ideas, in conceptual thinking. He was not himself an artist, and one cannot help being reminded of Eliot’s famous remark à propos Henry James, that he had a mind so fine that no idea could violate it !There is a sense in which Abhinava confuses art and life when he insists on the primacy of säntarasa. Tt is of course true that dramatists can be concerned with anything they like, including the experience underlying säntarasa; but the point is not one of theoretic possibilities, but of what actually succeeds in the theatre. Abhinava’s weakest point was that he did not really have any example of a great play in which säntarasa was dominant, to lend credence to his theories. The Nägänanda is the sole exception, and this could hardly be considered great literature. By seeing beyond literature to the universal experience that lies behind it, Abhinava is undermining the autonomy, the uniqueness of literary experience. He is in danger of turning literature into an icon, a representational object, an aid to devotion rather than an experience unique and precious for its own sake. \" Art ” , in C. S.

That literature could point nowhere except to itself, must have somehow proved disquieting to Abhinava. He was too religious to allow that literature might be somehow “ useless ” , a goal in itself. ( Though rasa does involve surrender to the work o f art, and Abhinava insists that one’s own self must be got out of the way before the work of art can truly be appreciated for its own sake. ) It is significant in this respect that Abhinava shies away from the terms priti “ pleasure” and vinoda “ entertainment ” , to express the purpose of poetry. He prefers the religious word ananda “ .bliss” . By insisting on putting such significance into poetry Abhinava is in danger of making much of Sanskrit literature top- heavy ; one is wary that it simply cannot bear the philosophical burden he places on it.

Nobody denied these in poetry or in religious literature generally,1 but in drama their existence was still debated. Säntarasa was not universally acknowledged as a legitimate element in drama. For Abhinava the question was not merely academic, for if he were not able to provide convincing arguments in its favour, he could hardly justify his interest in drama. Moreover he had no examples o f a play in which iäntarasa played an important part, with the single exception o f the Nàgànanda, largely a Buddhist drama, and o f questionable literary excellence. By synthesising all o f his pre-occupations into one system, a theoretical justi­fication for säntarasa could be made, with the ultimate result that the type of otherworldly or transcendental experience which the spectator undergoes during SR ( säntarasa ) would be basic to all aesthetic experience. Such a system was not to be found ready-made. But Abhinava was able to take what he needed from different sources ; from the Dhmnyäloka he took his theory o f suggestion ; from Bharata he took the starting point o f his ideas onI trasa and drama ; from speculation on SR and from Kashmir Saivism and Tantric works he took ideas on the relation of religious ecstasy to literature. The final end product was his theory of rasa in which he combines philosophyand poetics. There are, therefore, four major influences in his theories ;/poetics, philosophy, speculation on SR and ritual.Before examining these influences more closely, we must \"note that while open to all of them, Abhinava had an extremely independent mind.1.

On the other hand, he belonged to a tradition in which a careful grounding in the past was de rigeur, and it is not surpris­ing to find that he has been greatly influenced by a large number of writers. To consider this plagiarism3 is as absurd as demanding that Coleridge ( like Lowell in “ The Road to Xanadu ” ) footnote all his allusions and quotations ! Abhinava has a very fine verse in the Abhinavabharati,. right after giving elaborate expositions of his predecessors’ views on rasa, in which he justifies his urge to proceed further :“ When intellectual curiosity ( dli'i/i ) climbs higher and higher and seeS the truth ( arthatattva ) without getting tired, this is because of the ladders of thought built by earlier writers ” .4Poetic InfluencesAbhinava was of course familiar with all the works on poetics extant at the time o f his writing (many of which are no longer available).

The words santa and tónti occur constantly in both works.1 Further, at the end o f Saundarananda2 there are two remarkable verses which might well have influenced Abhinava :“ And so this work, whose essence is liberation, ( was written ) so that people might obtain peace o f mind, and not for amusement ( rataye ). I have written it in the form o f a poem in order to engage the minds o f readers interested ( primarily ) in other things ( and not in liberation ). The fact that I have dealt with things other than liberation is because o f ( the book’s ) poetic nature, and in order that it might appeal to the hearts o f readers, just as a bitter medicine is mixed with honey in order to induce the patient to drink it ” .sAbhinava has used this very simile of medicine and honey in the Locano. Moreover, he insists, time and again, that poetry is more gentle than tóstra ( which can be loosely translated as “ philosophy ” ), but that it leads to similar results. The last verse of the work is no less important :“ Since men are, for the most part, engrossed in sensual pleasures, and totally disinterested in moksa, I have said in this work, under the ( sweet ) dis­guise of poetry, that moksa is the highest ( truth ). Knowing this, ( the reader ) should with attentive mind ( avahitam ) accept from the poem that which leads to peace, and not ( only ) that which is pleasant. For gold is surely separated from mineral dust-particles ” .4,If we suppose that Abhinava did know this poem, how do we explain the fact that he did not use As'vaghosa’s works, seeing that he could certainly1.

We think there is a plausible reason : although there are passages of real santa poetry,1 nonetheless on the whole As’vaghosa’s position is directly opposed to the enjoyment o f poetry for its own sake ( a position Abhinava defends, see below ). The whole o f his work ( even the Saundarananda ) can be seen as a tract against just such frivolous activities as reading poetry and watching plays ! Santa is seen therein to be opposed to literary enjoyment, which after all implies a certain delight in the senses. Both Abhinava and Ananda (see below), extol the great variety of this world. Two other, less probable reasons, suggest themselves : (1) As'vaghosa was after all a Buddhist, and to quote him with approbation might have seemed odd. (2) In the verses quoted below there is real poetry. But there is a great difference between being told something, and actually experiencing it ( a problem which Abhinava and Ananda are greatly concerned with, under the name of sva'sabdanivedi- tat va). Preachers inform us; only poets invite us to experience. Asva- ghosa is more often than not a preacher. Thus, the same ideas from the fine verses quoted in the notes are repeated time and again, especially in chapter XIV. But they make no impression, for they are merely bald statements — ideas rather than poems.

But such verses are rare, and Abhinava may well have classified the whole poem as \" didactic ” , thus dismissing it from serious literary considera­tion, for the philosophical passages are o f interest to the believer and to the scholar, but not to the sahrdaya. But this is mere speculation.With Ànanavardhana, however, we pass into the realm of certainty. The influence of the Dhvanyähka on Abhinava cannot be exaggerated. \"We can safely say that the two greatest works in Indian literary criticism arè the Dhvanyàloka and Abhinava’s commentary on it, the Locano. There are few ideas in the D. Al. which Abhinava has not assimilated, often by dealing with them in a more subtle manner. Those ideas however for which he owes less to Ânanda, will be dealt with in the section on Abhinava himself.' Here we Should like to call attention to certain key terms, which stand for important concepts, from the D. AL which might-escape the notice of a hurried readei*.. These are the terms which seem to us most important to Abhinava’s theo­ries. Before doing so, wc should remember what dhvani is not. There; is nothing imprecise, or vague about dhvani, as many Western, writers have erroneously supposed, misled by the connotations of the word “ suggestive’’ in English. The concept is not a subjective one. There is nothing ineffable about dhvani. It is important to realise this. Ânanda in fact spends a good deal of energy in refuting the anäkhyeyavädins, those who claim that, if suggestion exists at all, it is beyond the realm of speech.2 Both vasludhvani and alankàradhvani can be paraphrased, without losing their status as poetry ( though of course they are no longer cases o f dhvani by definition ), but rasadhvani cannot. In fact, if we were to state what is the single most important characteristic feature of rasadhvani, we would say that it is the inability to lend itself to paraphrase.

We- will deal with this only briefly, for while it is essential to Abhinava, it is an area about which the reader can find reliable information with no great diffi­culty.1 In essence it is this : Ànanda inherited from older works, two functions of words, abhidhà and laksatp. Abhidhä is denotation, the literal meaning of any utterance. Laksam is more complex ( it has often been mis­understood ), but can be translated as secondary usage, including metaphori­cal usage. The time-honoured example, unfortunately not so simple to under­stand as has been thought, is : gamgayhm ghosah, literally : \" In the Ganges is a village of cow-herders. ” If this sounds absurd in English so does it in Sanskrit, for the locative is not normally used in the sense of proximity. By “ in the Ganges ” is therefore meant “ near the Ganges ” , i. e. \" on the banks of the Ganges ” . This meaning ( known as the laksyàrtha, as opposed to the abhidheyàrtha ) is reached through laksanâ. Until the time of Ànanda, these were the only two functions ( apart from tàtparya with which we are not concerned here) which writers, either on literature or philosophy, recognised. Änandavardhana revolutionised the field of poetics by adding a third func­tion, hitherto completely unsuspected : vyanjanä or “ suggestiveness This sabdavyäpära or “ linguistic function ” is active in all the three types o f suggestion mentioned above. Both Ànanda and Abhinava spend a great deal o f time justifying this function and defending it against detractors.1 2 3 They did this so successfull that, after one or two major critics ( Kuntaka and Mahimabhatta ), this function was universally acknowledged, and one finds no major work written after the eleventh century in which the author does not use it as an important element in his own theories on literature. To our mind, Abhinava’s major contribution to this doctrine was to show that rasa is not niyata, i. e. \" necessary ” , thus differing from arthapatti ( presumption, as used by Mukulabhatta in the Abhidhàvrttimàtrkà) and from anutmna, which are logical processes. Direct statements “ produce ” results. Thus the phrase putras te jätah? “ A son has been born to you ” , \"produces” delight. This is not the case with aesthetic delight, which, according to Ànanda and Abhinava, can only be “ suggested ” . But there are a great many other ideas in the D. AL not nearly so well-known, which must have exercised a certain fascination for Abhinava, as they still do for us, one thousand years later. The most important of these ( and certainly the least recognised by modern writers ) goes by the name of svasabdaniveditatva. It is closely relat-1.

Can an emotion be conjured up by simply nam­ing it ? 1 When an author attempts to charge a situation with sensuality, for example, is it sufficient for a man to say to a woman : “ I want to sleep with you ” ? If a character says to someone : “ I love you ” ,2 this may or may not be the case, but as readers of literature we demand proof, and the only proof relevant to literature is the actual suggestion of the emotion in the work. Simple profession is not enough. Surely the great fault of Thomas Mann’s 46 Magic Mountain ” is that while the first half of the book successfully creates the atmosphere of a sanatorium removed from the preoccupations of ordinary existence, the second half, in which Mann deals with philosophical and political ideas, fails to come to life. It is too intellectualised, too explicit- Mann seems to be writing essays, not literature. Settembrini’s long dis­courses only arouse impatience to get on to the real fictional elements of the work. Änanda saw this clearly ( is he perhaps the first recorded literary critic to do so ? ) : “ In a poem in which there is no description of the vibhàvas, etc., but a simple use of the word “ love ” , etc., how can there possibly be the slightest imaginative experience (on the part of the reader) ? ” 3 Abhinava was deeply impressed by this doctrine, as he tells us in the A. Bh. : \" It has been shown by the author of the dhvani (-àloka) and others, that rasas, etc., are never conveyed by the mere naming of the emotion ( to be suggest­ed ). This can be ascertained from my exposition called the Locana on the Sahfdayhloka.” 4 It is this doctrine that has led Änanda to emphasise the extreme importance of the suggested element ( vyahgyartha ) in literature, over and above the explicit element ( väcyärtha ). The whole first Uddyota of the D. AL is devoted to establishing the existence of this suggested element, and to underlining its supreme place in poetry. At times, in fact, this seems excessive, for it often leads Änanda to give critical acclaim to a poem that we should judge less satisfactory5 and to deride a poem that we should1.

But as Ânanda was the very first critic in literary history to have perceived the existence of the suggested sense, we must not complain if he is carried away by enthusiasm at his discovery.1 There is however one place in the D. AL where Änanda makes a very significant concession which has been for the most part overlooked by the later tradition : in the first Uddyota of the D. AL he says that an emotional evocation can be “ directly and explicitly stated” if this statement is merely a recapitulation (anumda•) of what has already been suggested.2' A doctrine which Änanda never developed into a specific theory, but which is nonetheless discernible from various passages and their underlying assumptions in the D. AL is the autonomy of literary experience. A poem creates its own world, and must be consistent only with itself. It owes only token allegiance to the outside world. The values of life are not necessarily the values of literature. Änanda says, very explicitly, in an important passage in the third Uddyota, that questions of truth and falsity simply do not apply to imaginative literature :“ In the field of poetry where we perceive suggested elements, truth ( satya ) and falsity ( asatya ) are pointless. To examine ( literature ) through ( the usual ) valid means of cognition would simply lead to ridicule. ” 3The criteria by which we judge literature, he explains, are not those which we apply in our everyday life. This theory culminates in the famous doctrine of aucitya, literally \" propriety ” . He develops this concept at very great length in the third Uddyota, and culminates by saying :“ Except for impropriety, there is no other source of harming rasa. The highest secret (upanisad) of rasa is following well-known (canons) of propriety. ” 4Continued from previous page )in fe rio r , aB litera tu re, to th e verse q u o te d ou p.

Now Ânanda points out that this is tantamount to describing the love-mak­ing of one’s own parents,3 4 since Ssiva and Pârvati are considered in mytho­logy to be the father and mother of the world. Ânanda, from the same passage,3 leaves us in no doubt that the passage is \" obscene ” ( asabhya ). But this does not mean either that it should be censored ( a question Ânanda never even considered, for it would be considered hubris to do more than make literary judgments; an actual “ judge ” , deciding what people should or should not read, would be distasteful and indeed unthinkable in ancient India, as hopefully it is coming to seem to us today ) or that it is not great literature. The description may be obscene ( asabhya ) but it is not vulgar ( gràmya ), i. e. it may offend some people’s notion of propriety, but it is not on that account unrefined or without value. The reason, Ânanda tells us, is the literary skill with which the description is made. Kalidasa was a consum­mate artist, and this is all that need concern the literary critic. Questions of morality are simply absurd. (Though one might sympathise, partially, with Kenneth Tynan when he pleads that he should be allowed to criticise a play of Ionesco on moral grounds : “ If a man tells me something which I believe to be an untruth, am I forbidden to do more than congratulate him on the brilliance of his lying ? ” 2 i ) Here is Ànanda’s remarkable passage : “ How is it that in such cases sensitive critics do not find the subject-matter utterly lacking in literary beauty ( càrutva) ? It is because (what would ordinarily be considered a blemish ) is cancelled out ( lit. concealed-tirohita ) by artistic genius ( kavi'sakti ). For there are two kinds of blemishes ( dosa ) : ( 1 ) that due to the lack of intellectual refinement ( avyutpatti ) on the part of the poet, and ( 2 ) that due to the absence of genius (sakti). Now the fault that is due to a lack of intellectual refinement can sometimes be passed over by grace of ( the poet’s inborn ) genius. But a fault due to lack o f genius will very quickly obtrude itself (on the attention of the reader) ... And so for example, great poets can describe the well-known sexual love, etc., among the very highest gods, and although they are improper, nonetheless, due to].

An example is the description of the love-makiug of Pàrvati ( and Siva ) in the Kumärasambhava. ” 1Another semina! idea of importance for Abhinava’s later theories was the critical equipment necessary to appreciate this “ suggested sense Kàrikà 7 of the first Uddyota, has this remarkable verse :“ ( The suggested sense ) cannot be known merely through lexicography or through grammar. Only those concerned with the very essence of poetry have access to it. ” 2Here the author of the Kàrikàs is criticising what was until his time the very staple of the literary critic : technical knowledge. Reading through the works written before the D. AL, one is struck by the extraordinary percep­tion of this remark. Dandin, Vâmana, Udbhata and Bhàmaha are unbend­ing in their concern with the technicalities o f the language, with metre, with grammar,3 and, especially, with figures of speech. One is reminded of the situation today, where the battle still continues between the “ academics ” .who insist on the importance, for understanding a work, of peripheral know­ledge, and the “ new ” critics ( a term Ananda uses of his school ) who insist on the autonomy and self-sufficiency of the poem. The difference, of course, is that it could be taken for granted that anybody in ancient India who was interested in Sanskrit poetry automatically came armed with elaborate train­ing in purely formal disciplines : grammar, prosody, logic. But Ananda was the first to demand that another element be introduced : literary sensiti­vity. He was concerned with essentials, with the aesthetic impact of the work of art. This was revolutionary, but in a sense it never had the impact on later critical writers that one would expect it to have. The one great critic to assimilate this principle into his own literary criticism is Abhinava him­self. For only Ananda and Abhinava concerned themselves with wider issues of literary criticism.

Abhinava of course carried on the tradition of Ànanda by focusing on fundamental questions of the philosophy o f aesthetics. Though he was followed in this by all later writers, he was the last to make any contribution to the field. What he had to say was new and intellectually daring. Later writers simply repeat his ideas, usually in a simplified form. But it seems to us very likely that Abhinava was encourag­ed to take this wider view because of the example that Ananda set for him.Another idea which Abhinava must have first assimilated from Ananda is the extraordinary importance ascribed to the poet. Not importance in the worldly sense of the term, but his autonomy, his ability to create new worlds'. This too was an idea barely foreshadowed in earlier criticism. Ananda states his position in two very exceptional verses, which have impressed themselves on the imagination of all later writers :“ In the shoreless world of poetry, the poet is the unique creator. Everything becomes transformed into the way he envisions it.If the poet is emotionally moved (lit. “ in love ” ) in his poems, then the whole world is infused with rasa.

For the poet is endowed with a power to create wondrous and unheard o f things. This power arises from the grace of Para Vak ( “ Highest Speech ” ), which is just another name for poetic imagination ( pratibhà ), which has its seat in the poet’s own heart, and which is eternally in creative motion (udita).\"1 It follows from this that for both Änanda and Abhinava, there could be no end to this creative imagination and to the actual poetic situations it could envisage. This is the theme of a whole section at the beginning of the fourth Uddyota of the D. Al., where we are told that there is no end to the themes of poetry, as long as one is endowed with poetic imagination.2 He gives a beautiful simile :\" Even though subjects may have been already used, thanks to the fact that they are associated with imaginative experience ( rasa) in literature, they all appear new, just as trees appear new during the honey-months ( spring ). ” 3c. There is no end to the novelty of poetic themes,4 no way of exhaust­ing the subject-matter of poetry :*' Thousands upon thousands of poets as eminent as Vàcaspati himself might use ( various ) subjects ( in their poetry ), and yet, like primordial world-matter, they cannot be exhausted. ” sThis is a healthy emphasis on the primacy of the external world, and how it must always form the poet’s major source of material.8One is reminded of the passage from the Avimàraka : \" How lovely is the great variety o f this world ! ” 7 This agrees with the emphasis the kàrikâs-3= . -------1.

In the second Uddyota when the gunas ( linguistic qualities ) are being discussed, madhurya “ delicacy ” is emphasis­ed : *' love alone is very delicate, for it is the most pleasing among all the rasas. ”1 This is so, we are told, because \" the mind, in love, becomes exceedingly sensitive (is m oved) . ” 2 It is surely this emphasis3 that has led Abhinava, in the A. Bh., to make a profound philosophical definition o f love. This occurs under NS. VI. 45, where Abhinava has a very long comment on Bharata’s definition of srhgararasa. The section is, for the most part, very corrupt. However one passage can be translated :“ Someone objected as follows : how can there be only one rasa ( srhgara ) when there are so many different kinds o f love ( rati ) according to the literary character in whom ( love ) exists ? The person objecting thus is not ( really ) acquainted with love. For all love is only one. It (exists) where there is not the separation of the one (7-ekaviyoga) ( from the other ), because there is a mutual ( commingling ) of consciousness. This is why ( Bharata ) said : uttamayuvaprakrtih ( this refers to p. 301, Vol. I of the NS : sä ca stripurusahetukä uttamayuvaprakrtih ) : “ he is noble ” and “ she is noble ” and so we get the dual compound uttamau. The same is true o f yuvànau ( i. e. “ he is young and she is young ” and so the dual compound ). Now the word uttamayuva in this context refers to their consciousness ( i. e. their minds ), and not to their bodies. For this concept ( viz. nobility ), from the highest point of view, applies only to consciousness.. .,,4:Continued from previous page )jagatah. Cf.

It is clear from the quotations by later writers that Bhattatauta was greatly preoccupied with this term and the concepts that lay behind it. Hemacandra quotes three verses from Bhattatauta :“ It has been said that there can be no poet who is not ( also ) a seer. And a man ( becomes ) a seer because of his “ vision ” ( darsana ). Vision is the knowledge of the truth o f the nature and properties of various things. A man is said in the iâstra to be a poet only because of vision. A man is said to be a poet in the world when he has both vision and (the power o f) description. This is why, although the first poet ( Vàlmïki ) was always gifted with a clear vision, as long as he did not actually describe ( things ) he was not known as a poet ( but only as a sage ) ” .31. A.

It held a particular fascination for Abhinava, for it involved him in one of his life-long pre­occupations : the relation between philosophy and poetry. In a sense one can look at this dichotomy as finally touching the most famous dichotomy o f all, that between the followers of the old school of poetics who believed in the paramount importance of alahkaras and gunas, and the new dhvani school. For the older school emphasises the hard work that must go into creation, the need for being properly schooled. The new school on the other hand, emphasises imagination,3 inspiration, rasa and dhvani.

The argument is not confined to India. It is a matter o f controversy whether a \" creative writing course ” is of any use to the young writer or not. There are those who argue that nobody ever learns anything from such artificial attempts to instil talent into students. Howard Nemrov once said in conversation that the only thing he really felt he should tell his class on creative writing was : \" Why don’t you write well ? Why aren’t you good ? ” On the other hand, there is general agreement that such classes do often manage to teach the already gifted student certain technical skills.The most famous line on pratibhä, first quoted by Abhinava and later by a great many writers, belongs to Bhattatauta.2 It is : 8 “ Poetic imagina­tion is that ( form o f) intelligence which shines with ever new scintillation ” .4 The whole verse is quoted as far as we know, only by Vidyacakravartin, in his Sampradàyaprakàsini :“ Remembrance is that which refers to an object of the past. Moti refers to something that is still in the future, buddhi deals with that which is present and prajm belongs to all three times ( past, present and future ). But pratibhä is that intelligence which shines with ever new scintillation. The poet is he who is skilful in descriptions animated by that ( pratibhä ). Poetry is that which the poet does ” .5There is of course a long tradition behind this word. The most famous quotation is perhaps the verse from Bhämaha that Abhinava quotes more than once :1. II. 16 and v r t t i thereon.2.

He has many interesting and unusual observations on critics and poets in the rest of the chapter as well. One thinks in particular of the two poets, blind from birth,4 who are nonetheless endowed with “ vision ” ( pratibhà ).But it is really only Abhinavagupta who enables the various insights into the nature of imagination to be coordinated into a philosophical whole, as we shall see when dealing with his philosophy o f aesthetics in the next section. The fine image o f Mahimabhatta was surely inspired by Abhinava’s philosophic views on imagination :•* Pratibhà is that intellectual function of the poet whose mind is con­centrated ( stimita ) on thinking about words and meanings that are appro­priate to rasas. It arises for a moment from the contact of the poet’s mind with the essential nature ( o f the Àtman ).”Ab h in a v a’s p h il o s o p h y o f a e s t h e t ic s1.

The most important of these is sàdhàranìkarana, the power which enables a situation in literature to abstract itself from its unique application to one individual, and to be univer­sally applicable. This is not a concept found in Anandavardhana, nor in the Nàtyakàstra. The word that BN uses for it is bhävanä. Abhinava® quotes the first line of a verse that Hemacandra7 8 and Jayaratha* give in full :“ ( There are three functions in poetry : ) abhidha ( denotation, which, for BN, includes laksanä as well ), bhävanä ( generalisation ), and the enjoy­ment that ensues. Both word and sense-figures belong to denotation. The whole collection of (primary emotions such as) love, etc., arises from bhävanä.1.

Al. ( though he is supposed to have written his Hfdayadarpana to demolish the idea o f dhvani) in granting that there is an element in poetry beyond denota­tion and secondary usage. In one passage in the Locano,3 Abhinava even says that BN is simply giving suggestion another name. But far more import­ant for Abhinava was BN’s views on religious ecstasy and poetry.It may well be that Bhattanàyaka was the first person to make the famous comparison o f yogic ecstasy and aesthetic experience. Unfortunately his Hrdayadarpam has been lost, and only quotations survive in the later Alahkära works. The Hrdayadarpana appears to have been either a com* tnentary on the Nàtyasàstra or an independent work criticising the theory o f dhvani in the course of which he had occasion often to quote from the NS, Abhinava quotes Bhattanàyaka frequently in the Locano,4 not always to disagree with him. It is clear from many o f his remarks that he had a high respect for him.The first passage we quote and translate is one of exceptional interest, that must certainly have been of great importance for Abhinava’s own theo­ries. It is found on p. 5 of the Abhinavabhàratì ( G. O. S. vol.

Just as the unreal actions of Rama, Ràvana and others, which are essentially a figment of one’s imagination and hence do not possess a single fixed form, butin a moment assume hundreds and thousands of forms; which though different (in their unreality) from dreams, etc., are still the outcome of mental imagination ( hrdayagrahanidàna ); which are enacted by actors who are almost like the creator of the world ( Brahma ) and who have not relin­quished their separate identity ( as persons in real life ) - those actions ( of Rama and Ràvana, etc. ) appear ( to us ) in a most unusually wondrous way; and though appearing like that, they become the means of attaining the (four) goals of life - in exactly the same way this universe consists of a display of unreal forms and names and yet through listening to and meditating on spiritual instruction, it leads to the realisation of the highest goal of human life ( namely moksa ).Thus this stanza, by suggesting ( the attainment o f) the other-worldly highest goal of human life introduces sàntarasa.‘ Depending on their respective causes the different rasas originate from sàrìta ( a state of mental calm ). *Thus the present stanza ( NS, I. 1 ) conveys the higher purpose ( o f drama ). ” This is the explanation that Bhattanàyaka has given in his Sahrdayadarpana.

It is true of course that h r d a y a and s a h r d a y a mean very different things, but Abbinava seems in the habit of calling a single work by different names. Thus he speaks of the K â v y â l o k a (i. e. the D h o a n y d l o k a ) of Änandavardhana ( L o c a n a, p. 2 and again L o c a n a % p. 554 ) and later in the A b h i n a v a b h à r a t ï , Vol. I, p. 343, he calls the same work the S a h r d a y â l o k a.

It has been suggested4 5 that he wrote his works on poetics after his major works \"on philosophy. One would, therefore, expect his aesthetic theories to have been influenced by his readings in Kashmir Saivism.

The work itself1 says that it is meant as both, and all of its thirty-three thousand verses bear out this boast. Not only does it contain remarkable philosophi­cal doctrines, but many of the passages are as complex and literary as any of the Mahàkàvyas. The philosophical stories are replete with lyric descriptions of great beauty,8 and the very language itself gives evidence of a highly literary mind.2 3 The author was clearly aware of all the terminology from literary criticism,4 * * * and makes use of it, thus illustrating Abhinava’s very philosophy.

Had Abhinava known the work, it seems odd that he would not have quoted it any­where. It is interesting to note that in the preserved portion of the commentary on the V B by Kçemarâja, the direct disciple of Abhinavagupta, there areno quotations from the Y V , whereas in the later commentary ( 18th cen. ) by S'ivopâdhyâya, there are numerous quotations. This seems to us to point to the fact that Kçemaràja did not know the work,1. Y V , 11,18, 33 :3TT^T I2. On this aspect of the work, see J, Masson and B. K.

The remarkable story of Gädhi ( V. 45-50 ), who dreams, in one second an entire life that turns out to have actually taken place in another dimension, is replete with the most extraordinary literary passages. There is no finer example in world literature of a profound philosophical mind with a genius for artistic description, even though many of the verses betray a certain lack of tradi­tional literary education ( odd syntax, unorthodox similes etc. ).

In any case, both authors are closely related. One doctrine which is remarkably similar to passages from the VB and to passages in the Tantràloka that we shall shortly examine, is the emphasis on being unfettered in one’s enjoyment of life. Thus there is a passage where Vasistha tells Räma that he, Rama, is now a jivanmukta, who knows that his consciousness is ever pure, and so he should : “ Drink, live, make love, for you have obtained the far-shore of worldly existence. ” 1Such verses are not rare in the YV, e. g. :“ It is all the same (if the realised man) be, with unbridled passion ( uddamamanmatham ), given to heavy drink, or dance, or if, on the other hand, he abandon all society and go off alone to the mountains. ” 2The number o f verses in which ànanda is described in terms to which we are now used from Abhinava, are legion. Here are just a few examples :“ That is genuine happiness wherein the mind ceases to function. Such happiness is not possible in heaven, just as it is not possible for a house of ice to exist in the desert. ” 3And on a theme that Abhinava will develop himself :“ Higher than a kingdom, than heaven, than the moon, than the status of Maghavan and even than the delight that arises in making love with one’s beloved is the happiness proceeding from the extinction of desires. ” 4The YV tells us that “ all beings strive for bliss” .5 Speaking of ätmänanda, a term of which the book is very fond, it says :1* Ppr fa ir I Y V .

We can justly presume that many of Abhinava’s ideas come from this text.Another question that must go unanswered, though it is rich in possi­bilities. is Abhinava’s debt to Buddhism. We simply do not know anything definite on this problem at all, though it is very tempting to speculate.1tIn f l u e n c e s f r o m s p e c ul a t i on o n S à n ta ra saIt is clear that Abhinava did have access to certain old manuscripts of the Nàtya'sàstra in which nine rasas were enumerated, including sàntarasa, and not the usual eight. Apart from the famous Kâlidàsa passage2 which mentions only eight, there is reason to believe that Abhinava himself realised, with an extraordinary display of intellectual integrity, that eight was the older and more genuine reading. We say this because when he quotes the verse from the NS3 enumerating the rasas, in the Locano, he quotes theJ______1. Abbinava of course knew Dharmaklrti whom ho referB to with groat respect in the ÏP V V, e. g. Vol. II, p. I ll :^ Tri. He again refers to him by name atÏP V V, I, 279; II, 46 and 174. He moutions the P r a m ü n a o â r t t ik a by name at several places in the I P V V , K. g. Vol. II, 220; 223; 228; 234; 400; Vol. III. p. 11; 72; 103; 127; 138; 140; 200; 389 and 397. In defending d h v a n i against those who claimed that it was ineffable, Ananda has the following lino : «IÎ&MI cTrT-I Abhinava, commenting on this passage ( L o c a n a , p. 519 ) remarks : $T?$T1?3T sfa I W ÏtPîÎ *ÏT î^frRgHT ^rfl cT^- cfS^ÎT^TTïï^l H is really moBtunusual that Ananda should write a commentary on a Buddhist text. This certainly shows that Buddhist doctrines must have exercised at least a fascination for Ananda and thus for Abbinava us well. Under AtaS\\ VI. 45 (O .

Oddly enough, however, there exists at present no Buddhist text on a la n k u r a & te lr a . It seems rather unlikely that Dharmakirti w rote a work entitled simply “ A l a n k à r a ” , as Kane has noted ( I I , S . P . p. 05 ) : 44 So the Buddhist logician and philosopher Dharmakirti may have been a poet, but there is nothing to substantiate the claim to regard him as a writer on A la û h â r a . ” Seo Sivaprasada Bhnttaoharya,44 S t u d ie s in I n d i a n P o e t i c s ” , Calcutta 1964, which contains the reprint of an article entitled 44 The Neo-Buddhist Nucleus in A la n h â r a ê A s t r a ” , though as Kane points out, the quotation from the V û s a v tid a U iï is at the most ambiguous inspite of what S'ivarûma says. There seems to us no likeli­hood that the kârihâa of the A la ïik à r a é e k h a r a could be by Dharmakirti though we have no spaco to give our arguments. Note finally that Abhinava often quotes one Kâhnla, a commentator on the N ü t y a î û s t r a, and that this is a Buddhist name.2. V i k r a m o r v a & y a ì II. 18.3.

Bh} he speaks, whenever he mentions sànta, of those who “ read ” sànta. We cannot there­fore know how old the doctrine o f SR is. The first author of known date to mention SR is Udbhata,1 2 who simply includes it in his enumeration- o f all the rasas without further comment or explanation. The interpolated käntarasa passage in the Nàtyasàstra, whatever it was ( for it is clear that the present passage is not likely to be precisely the one that Abhinava commented on3 4 ), is nonetheless likely to have been the earliest reference to SR that Abhinava knew. If we, purely tentatively, place the core of the NS around the fourth century A. D., then all we can say is that SR must have been add­ed to the text sometime before the time of Udbhata, i. e. the eighth century A. D. (unless we are to argue that it was Udbhata who first spoke of SR., which seems most unlikely in view of the fact that he has nothing whatever to say about it, beyond naming it). However, it is clear that for Ananda, SR was a matter of controversy. Had the passage from the NS already existed, and had Ananda felt that it was genuine, there would be no reason for him not to have mentioned this fact in his D. ÀI., while discussing SR. The fact that he did not, makes us suspicious of its existence in his time.* But if it was not existent, this means that it was added between the time of Ananda and Abhinava, i. e. only a space of about one hundred years. Is this sufficient for Abhinava to speak of “ old ” manuscripts which contained the SR additions ?The influence on Abhinava of Ananda’s speculation on SR will become clear from the passage we translate below. The importance of the NS passage ( and related verses, which though they do not specifically mention SR, yet seem to Abhinava to imply it ) will also be clarified in part II of this volume. But here we should say something of several passages1 which claim to be old, but which can at best be described as suspect.1. E. g. A . B h. Vol. 1, p. ‘299 unci 332.2.

Since Bharata does not mention santa, and since there* are only an even number of eight rasas, there is nothing it could come from.“ O King, they say that santa arises from vairàgya. It can be enacted by means of taking on religious paraphernalia and through such means as compassion for all beings, meditation, encouraging others towards the path of moksa etc. ” * 1 2“ Sànîarasa is that wherein one feels the same toward all creatures, where there is no pleasure, no sorrow, no hatred and no envy. ” 3It is clear that these lines are simply a pastiche o f the various passages which the reader can see in Part II. It seems to us unlikely that this passage antedates Abhinava. The editor, Miss Priyabala Shah, thinks differently : \" Thus in the present stage of our knowledge, it would be safe to put Visnudharmottara somewhere between the first or rather the second half of the fifth century a. d„ and the first half of the seventh century a. d., i. e. between circa 450 and 650 a. d. ,,4r But in dating any Purana text, to date more than single sections ( and indeed, perhaps more than single stanzas ! ), even very roughly, is a hazardous undertaking.

The strangest and the most disturbing element in the ritual involves the DQti ( note the similarity to love-poetry, where every Nàyikà must have a Dûtï). The culmination of the ritual is concerned with this Doti, who identifies herself with Siva’s Sakti. Jayaratha quotes a text to the effect that this Dütî should be :“ One’s own wife, one’s sister, one’s mother, one’s daughter or one’s beautiful friend ” .4But Jayaratha points out that Abhinava ( ? ) did not accept one’s own wife as a Düti, for one might conceive purely carnal lust in her case,5 which goes against the whole ritual6 where the goal is to enter a state of pure consciousness.7 The Dütî is very elaborately described in fourteen verses from the Srïtantraràjabhattàraka, with all the paraphernalia of a maha- kävya.* Now follow the ordinarily8 forbidden acts,10 the three makàras :1.

These three, when combined together, give the highest bliss ( änanda ) and the highest bliss is none other than Parabrahman.1 Abhinava points out that this ritual expands ( vikàsa) the heart, by inducing a state of complete freedom from desire (nairàkànksya), since one’s body ( through the use of perfume, incense and flowers, verse 108, p. 77 ) and mind, are mutually satisfied. The actual sexual union,3 described in verse 50 is said to give rise to ànandavì'srànti, “ rest in bliss ” , on which Jayaratha has the significant gloss ( p. 36 ) of svätmacamatkära. In his exposition, Abhinava uses the term sàrtia several times (e. g. verse 133, p. 95 ) and many other words and concepts which were to form his theory of aesthetics. Finally one of the major verses makes this comparison that we have been drawing inevitable :“ Because of the flow ( rasa ) o f desire, through the force o f the relish ( carvanà ) of outward things, which are filled with one’s own flow ( ? ), one attains the state of complete repose ( visräntidhäma ) and all phenomenal objects ( comm, bhävajäta ) are merged into one’s own Self. ” 31. Verses 49-60. The verses actually dealing with intercourse ( e. g. 111-117)are deliberately couched in obscure and symbolic terms, so that it is very difficult to understand precisely what is meant. There is no doubt that the soxual act is preceded by elaborate fore-play directly acted out, but symbolically interpreted. Thus Jaya­ratha on verse 114, p. 83 writes : |The passages concerning the actual ejaculation of semea are the most obscure of all. It is clear from p. 89 and elsewhere that the face of the éakii is the most important cakra of all, and it would seem, though we are not certain if we have understood the passages correctly ( e. g. p. 88 ), that the man ejaculates in the mouth of the woman. From the many quotations that Jayaratha cites, it is obvious that there existed a very elaborate and serious literature on this subject, unfortunately lost today. In explain­ing the difficult verse on p. 91, ( verse 128 ) Jayaratha explains that the semen should be passed back and forth from the mouth of the woman to the mouth of the man, and finally poured into a consecrated vessel. Several verses from tc the ägamas ** are quoted in support, e. g. p. 93 :Abhinava himself discusses various forms of ejaculation, all supported by ancient authorities. The subject, of enormous interest to students of religion and of pyscho- logy, deserves a close and impartial investigation.2. T.

Because it is only when one is in love that there is continual ( dhàrâ ) repose in sheer happiness. ” 2Leaving aside the extremely curious sexual contacts with one’s own family ( which require a very careful pyschological, or pyschoanalytic analysis if the significance is to be found ), there is nothing in the rest of the ritual that does not bear a close resemblance to the theatre. Surely such Tantric rituals affected Abhinava’s views on the eventual goal of art, and led him to his transcendental theories on the aim of the aesthetic experience. The combina­tion was unique in all of Indian history, and has produced one of the great monuments to the complexity and profundity of the human mind.

They cannot be completely beyond our scope of knowledge, whether that knowledge be acquired through our own past experiences or through our acquaintance with literature.1 ( 2 ) Too personal an identification. One must not feel that the drama is an actual event in the world. A certain aesthetic distance is necessary. This is the purpose of the mtyadharmis, those conventions found only in the theatre, e. g. unusual speech habits, dress etc. (3) An absorption with one’s own feelings (nijasukhàdivivasîbhàva). One must overcome personal feelings in order to enter another person’s feelings ( vastvantare samvidam visràmayet), Music, decoration in the theatre, etc., all help to soften the spectator’s hard sense of ego. The setting works on him and enables the spectator who is willing to respond to become a sahrdaya, a man sensitive to literature. (4) Lack of proper means of per­ception ( pratìtyupàyavaikalycim ). (5) Lack of clarity ( sphutatvàbhàva). Just as Abhinava insists on certain conventions in the theatre ( mtyadharmi ), so also he insists on their opposite as well, a certain realism ( lokadharmi ). Thus he says the acting ( abhinayana ) is in many senses very close to direct perception {pratyaksavyäpärakalpa). (6) Lack of pre-dominance ( apradhànatà ). Abhinava feels that there are four major mental states, more important ( pradhana ) than any others.1 2 He associates these four with the four goals of life. Rati, love ( the sthàyibbàva of srrigàra ) corresponds to kàma. Krodha9 anger ( the sthàyibhàxa of raudra ) corresponds to artha. Utsàha, energy( the sthàyibbàva of vira) corresponds to three ( kama, dharma and artha).1. Cf. Abhinava, in the L o c a n a , p. 331 :^ ^rrarr i ^ 44 ^4 i j w3TcT cTWfa 1 ïî c4tì<-+U«Mm<Ì 1cc This comes to the following : one should only describe such incidents as do not destroy the enjoyment of tbe audience. So that if ( one should say that ) a simple man crosses the seven oceans in one step, because it is impossible, it will strike the mind as untrue and so will cause even the teaching consisting in the means of attaining the four aims of life to seem false as well. But in the case of Rama etc., even such ( inherently unreal ) feats as the one just described ( namely crossing the seven oceans ) do not seem false because 9uch deeds are busod on ( our ) trust that is generated by a series of earlier well-known narrative events And so even other extraordinary feats of Rama, when imaginatively described, will not seem false. But in any case one should avoid describing unlikely events ( unless they are vouchsafed by a narrative tradition ). ”2. Note that Bharata ( N J Ì .y VI. 39-40 ) too has this doctrine of four promi­nent r a s a s which give rise to the other four in turn [ 8 r n g d r a t r a u d r a, rira and bibh a tsa ).

One of these must predominate in every drama. Abhinava explains that all of them contain a predominance of bliss ( sarve'mi sukhapradhänäh ), since in experiencing them, one is tasting one’s own con­sciousness, which is a single compact mass of bliss ( svasamviccarvamrupa-syaikaghanasya..........änandasäratvät). (7) The presence of doubt ( samsaya-yoga ). This refers to the fact that we cannot be certain what the anubhävas are meant to represent. Tears, Abhinava tells us1 might be due to joy or to sorrow, and anxiety {cinta) might refer to virarasa as well as to bhayanaka. But when properly combined ( samyoga ) such doubts will not arise.We can see from this that Abhinava places emphasis (and not only here, but throughout both his major works on poetics) upon the transcen­dental ( alaukika ) nature of our feelings during a drama. He has stressed over and over that there is not a direct correspondence between karana and vibhàva, or between kàrya and anubhäva, for one refers to the world, and the other to art. Ordinary means of knowledge play no role in rasa :“ The enjoyment of an aesthetic experience consists of a transcendental wonder ( alaukikacamatkära ) and is decidedly ( eva ) different from ordinary, ( laukika ) knowledge such as ( is produced ) by memory and inference ” .aThe sthäyibhäva that Abhinava speaks of is the same as väsanä, an important word in his philosophy. It means the same as samskära, latent impressions that we carry with us from birth to birth. In a sense it corres­ponds to the Freudian unconscious. The sthäyibhäva would correspond to the conscious, for the väsanä is aroused, awakened, and we then call it a sthäyibhäva. Now this doctrine enables Abhinavagupta to answer one of the great puzzles of literary criticism in the West. How do we explain the fact that we can appreciate a drama which deals with emotions beyond the range o f our experience ? E. g. how is it that incest dramas grip those o f us who have no experience ( at least consciously ) of such emotions ? The answer that Abhinava gives is ingenious. He claims that in our beginningless (for it is an axiom of Sanskrit philosophy that samsära is anàdi9 though of course it has an end ) wanderings through the universe, we have had every con­ceivable experience, been open to every possible emotion. “ Nothing human 1 21.

For example, we all seek pleasure, and avoid pain, and are thus open to rati ( sarvo riramsayà vyäptah ). He concludes : “ There exists no living being who is devoid of the latent impressions of these mental states ” .2 What happens after this sthàyibhàva is activated is hrdayasamväda, a word of which Abhinava is very fond. It means “ sympathetic response” and he uses it to represent the state just before identification. It is made possible through the existence of sädhäranikarana, the factor in literature that makes all events impersonal and universal, an idea that Abhinava borrowed from Bhatta- nàyaka as we have already seen. This identification which then takes place is what Abhinava calls tanmayibhavana, another key term. The word is already used in a difficult verse from the Tantràìoka :“ Those who do not identify ( with the object of contemplation ), who do now know the merging of the body, etc., ( in that object ) and whose intellect as a means of cognition is not merged ( in that object ) — they are known as insensitive ” .3It is defined elsewhere in the Tantràìoka, where we are told that \" identification is the attainment of one’s highest Self. It is the highest stage o f fulfilment, and there can be no further fruit after that ” .4 By “ further1. A . Bit., Vol. I, p. 282.2. Op. eie., p. 282 :*T HTJft ^?fcf I3. T. At.

When we get what we want, we have further wants. Not so with this, for we have attained ourselves, and there is nothing further to desire.1 Immediately after tanmayibhavana, the last stage in the process o f aesthetic experience, we come to the actual experience itself : rasa. Abhinava has played down both alankäradhvani and vastudhvani in his Locano commentary, to give unique perference to rasa. Time and again he will say things like the following :\"B y the word ucita (proper), Änandavardhana shows that the only propriety ( relevant to poetry ) is the one with regard to rasa, and thereby he suggests that rasadhvani is the essence ( of all poetry ) ” .*His definition of rasa occurs in such a context :“ When the suggested sense does not take the form o f an alankàra, then we say that it is plain vastu. The word plain ( màtra) rules out its being anything else ( i. e. alankäradhvani or rasadhvani ). Now rasadhvani is something else altogether. It belongs (gocara) only to the (suggestive) function in poetry. It is never included under worldly dealings ( vyavahära ) and is never even to be dreamed of as being revealed directly through words. No, quite the contrary, it is rasa, that is, it has a form which is capable o f being relished ( rasaniy& ) through the function ( vyäpära ) of personal aesthetic relish ( car vana), which is bliss (ananda) that arises in the sahrdaya's delicate mind that has been coloured (anuràga) by the appropriate ( samucita ) latent impressions ( väsanä ) that are deeply embedded from long before (präk ); appropriate that is, to the beautiful vibhävas and anubhävas, and beautiful, again, because of their appeal to the heart (samväda), and whichC o n tin u e d , f r o m p r e v i o u s p a g e )3T5TIrftr il<r*TT 11.

That alone is rasadhvani, and that alone, in the strict sense of the word, is the soul ( of poetry ) ’VHis definition of drama is equally difficult and philosophic :“ A drama is a thing ( vastu ) whose essence, so far as the spectator is concerned ( tadgrähaka ) consists of rasa that can only be known by direct experience (samvedana ) in the form of aesthetic enjoyment which is altogether different from correct knowledge ( samyagjmna ), erroneous cognition ( bhranti ), doubt, uncertainty, non-determination ( anadhyavasàya ) and ordì* nary knowledge ( vijnàna ). It is distinct from worldly objects, and also different from such things as their ( i. e. worldly objects’ ) imitation, reflec­tion and pictorial presentation (alekhya), determination (adhyavasäya ), fancy, magic shows, etc. ” .aAbhinava likes to insist on the autonomy of a work of art, on the fact that it is sui generis and need have no object corresponding to it in the real world. Thus he remarks of the dance that it imitates nothing in real life, but is pure creation, with no practical aim ( to be free of practical aims is for Abhinava one of the defining characteristics o f drama, as indeed it is of all art ). Thus he remarks, d propos of Siva’s famous cosmic dance, that it is the spontaneous expression of his overflowing bliss, in which no thought other than sheer creative beauty exists.3 The poet is very much like Siva; in fact, Abhinava often associates the poet, Siva and rasa all together.

The creation of samsara is by Siva,* the poet ( note the implication : both are unreal ). Reductive state­ments dealing with identification are not uncommon with Abhinava.3 His commentary on the NS. VI. 38, provides a good example and is itself intrin­sically interesting.

Hence they alone ( i. e. the rasas ) deserve to be mentioned first ( and not the b h â v a s ).” Anticipating such an objection he says : just as the tree etc. Just as the seed stands as the root-cause of a tree, so the rasas ( stand as the root cause of the b h â v a s ), for moral instruction and intellectual train« ing, which are preceded by entertainment, arise from them ( i. e. from the r a s a s ).( The following words— ta ta er a ca v y â k h y â n â r h â t are obscure, and we are not able to follow what Abhinava means. ) The functioning of the actor which is preceded by { i. e. which is based on ) the ( dramatic ) poem, is ( ultimately ) based on the thought arising in the poet’s mind - which thought is attuned in sympathy (t o that of the original characters ). It is that very thought ( arising in the poet’s mind ) that is really speaking the r a s a . The spectator who is carried away by the perception of that ( r a s a ) later on perceives the v ib h d v a s etc. ( only ) on analysis ( of the aesthetic experience - a p o d d h â r a h n d d h y â ). ( The following words : i t i p r a y o j a n e , n d t y e,k â v y e 9 s ä m ä j i k a d h i y i ca, are obscure and we are not able to follow what Abhinava means by them. ) Thus the rasa existing in the poet ( k a v ig a to r a s a h ) is like the seed which is the root ( i. e. cause ) ( of a tree ) ( we propose reading m ü la b i ja s t h d n i y d h for the G. O. S. reading of m fd a b i j a s t h ä n iy ä t which makes no sense ). For the poet is just like the spectator. For this very reason it has been said by Ânandavardhanâ- cârya “ If the poet is full of ê r n g â r a r a s a ” etc. ( D h v a n y d l o k a III, p. 498 ). Therefore a ( dramatic ) poem is like a tree. The activity ( functioning ) of the actor such as gesticulation, is like the flowers etc. The aesthetic experience on the part of the spectator is like the fruit. Consequently everything is full of rasa,” What follows is no less interesting. Here is the text as corrected by Raghavan ( o p . c it . p. 532) : an* Tf faiiT^K T, w rfT W «:, =3I g q«qirftn'IrcT'jfä’JT i 3 ^ît-fc? *ng: sra'i^t 1 %■;( The first sentence is obscure. ) a But we have not been taught to take the fruitless trouble of parading bits of wisdom wrhich are not useful to the matter in hand.

Others however explain : the tree in the form of r a s a arises from the which is like a seed; andfrom that ( tree of r a s a ) which is lovely with its blossom in the form of a b h i n a y a, the b h d v a like a fruit, is enjoyed by its perception ( p r a t i l y d ). Now these people ( in explaining the passage in this way ) have explained the whole thing in a manner repugnant to the matter in hnnd. For in explaining the passage in this manner, they are saying that bhäva exists both in the beginning ( u p a k r a m a ) and in the end ( p a r y a v a s â n a ) ( in as much as they claim that bh d va is both the seed and the fruit ).

Thus everything ( or : the whole world ) is made of rasa ! ” 1For Abhinava, poetry and drama are essentially the same thing.® Thus rasas are only to be found in drama, and not in the real world.® And what does Abhinava consider the purpose of drama and poetry to be ? What is his stance on the largely unspoken but constant controversy between vyutpatti ( in the sense of moral or intellectual instruction ) and priti (pleasure) as the goal o f literature ? Basically Abhinava holds that the major purpose of art is pleasure. Thus in the Locano* he says :“ Although knowledge and pleasure for the reader are both present, as Bhamaha® has said :‘ Study o f good poetry confers fame and pleasure, as well as skill in dharma, artha, kama and moksa, and skill, too, in the fine arts, ’ nevertheless pleasure is the main thing.

Even of instruction in the four goals of life delight is the final and major result. ” ,Abhinava has an interesting passage in the third Uddyota of the Locano1 in which he repeats this fundamental distinction in method between history, philosophy 'and poetry. Since, he says, people, and especially people in important positions,: must be made sensitive ( lit. “ instructed ” , vyutpädya ), the best way to provide them with this ethical and intellectual education ( vyutpatti ) is through poetry. The way to instruct people in the four goals of life is by entering their hearts ( hrdayàmpraveha ), which is just another name for imaginative experience in general ( hrdayanupravekas ca rasäsväda- maya eva ). Abhinava ends by saying that priti, pleasure, is the cause of vyutpatti ( prit ir eva vyutpatteh prayojikä ). His concluding phrase leaves us wondering whether this whole doctrine was not inherited from his teacher:“ Rasa consists of pleasure, and rasa alone is drama, and drama alone is the Veda. This is what our teacher says ” .2 Ahhinava goes on to make this important remark : “ Nor are pleasure and instruction really different things, for they both have the same object ” .sC o n t i n u e d f r o n t p r e v i o u s p a g e )“ ( Readers ) use ( i. e. read ) even tbe éâstras if they are mixed with sweet poetiorasas ( jnst as children will ) swallow bitter medicine if they first lick honey. 11Curiously enough, according to Professor Bhattacharya, this is a quotation from the H r d a y a d a r p a n a ( see p. 8, fn. 1 : M^ f f c T ). Butthis cannot be correct,since the stanza is found in Bhätnuha,V. 3. What are the works in Skt. that can be considered àâatraa as well as Jcdvyas* Really only two : the Y o g a v ä s if t h a and the M a h â b h â r a ta. It is a great pity that Ânandavardhana’s T ü ttv â lo k a is lost, for it very probably dealt with this fascinating topic in detail ( see L o c a n a, p.67 and p. 633 ).1. L o c a n a, p. 336.2.

When their sufferings are overcome, drama becomes the cause of dhrti, etc., according to suitability {yathhyogam ) ; thus dhrti etc., ( verse 113), having delight for their essence, apply in their proper order to the spectators afflicted with sorrows etc. For instance, ( drama ) gives courage to the person overcome with sorrow. For the man afflicted with illness it distracts his mind. For the weary man it creates happi­ness. The word *' etc.” ( in verse 113 ) stands for such things as awakening of the mind, etc., in the case of the man who practises tapas. Not only ( does the drama achieve ) this, but it also gives rise at a later date ( kàlàntare ) to the result ( paripäka ) in the form o f happiness that stems from instruction. In this manner the purpose ( o f the drama ) for those who are unhappy ( is three­fold ) : it calms the pain o f those who are grieved, it gives immediate pleasure, and it gives happiness later ( through instruction, which if followed leads to happiness ). As for those who are not in sorrow, but are almost always happy, such as princes, etc., even for them the drama provides instruction in the ways o f the world and in the means leading to the (fo u r) goals of life, such as dharma, etc. The word “ world ” means “ ways of the world ” . Question : does the drama instruct the way a teacher ( or an elderly person ) does ? ( Answer : ) No. Rather it causes one’s wisdom to grow.In his commentary on the rasasütra of Bharata, just before com­mencing a detailed statement of his own position, Abhinava quotes the first line o f a very famous verse from the Sàkuntaìa} Abhinava considered this verse to be the ideal introduction to his exposition of rasa. Since its exact significance has proved somewhat mysterious, we feel we are justified in intro­ducing the two passages from the Locano with a short discussion on this passage. The verse reads :“ Seeing moving sights, and hearing soft sounds, even a man who is happy is filled with strange longing. Surely it is because he vaguely remem­bers, though he is not fully conscious, affections formed in an earlier life that are fixed inside him through the latent impressions they leave behind. ” 31. A good summation of this whole theory is Abhinava’s account at the beginning of the A . B h ., of what takes plaee when we actually witness a drama,O. O. S., p. 36. The passage has been edited and translated by Guoli, o p . cit. ( p. 96 ).2. The verse is quoted in the A . B h ., p. 279-280, ( Vol, 1 ).3. à â k u n t a l a, V. 2 :îffar JTgÛaj farsi»!SRHFrRffWfîf 11"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"58Why then does Abhinava quote this ? 1 - The reason Ave feel is'this : Dusyanta has an experience of rasa. * But it is not like any other ex­perience in the world. He is not directly experiencing any kind of sexualpleasure, but the vibhavas ( music and perhaps paintings as well ) call up to him some vague memories. This in its turn produces longing ( autsukya ) in him. It is an aesthetic experience. The memory involved is not of course like any other kind of memory, for it has no object. The bhàvasthiràni in the verse are the actual vàsanâs. These vâsanàs ( latent impressions ) are brought to life by his hearing the music, and they then bring to his aesthetic attention ( i. e. his deeper unconscious) intimations of a pleasure he formerly had. But this pleasure is now no longer direct, it is purified, not directlystateable. It is thus a higher kind of delight than the original.3 SoAbhinava regards this verse as proof of rasa*1. Hemacandra, K â v y à n u s â s a n a , 11. 1. p. 99 :ar? w a rie r «ir s i * rnffawfiiST i iWhat Hemaohandra means by saying that Du$yanba has not experienced this love is that he is not now remembering something ho has experienced. In other words, ordinary memory of happy experience does not constitute aesthetic experience. Thus a play does not bring up in our memories similar experiences. What is conjured up in us is the more general emotion, purified of any actual memory. This interpreta­tion is confirmed by the passage from in the Ì P V V. quoted in Note 3.2. For Räghavabhatta, the verse is a case of ê r n g û r a.3. On p.252 of the third volume of the Ï P V V , Abhinava quotes the last lines ofthe same verse : b h â v a s th itâ n i j a n a n â n t a r a s a u h r d à n i (this reading of b h à m s t h i t â n i instead of b h à v a s th ir à n i is confirmed by Räghavabhatta, who says that it is a w ell- established reading ). The context is extremely difiicult to make out, since the text on which Abbinava is commenting is nob extant, and none of the p r u tik a s make sense. But it is clear that he is quoting this as an example of an emotion ( he seems to be discussing the distinction between various kinds of love ; k(ìm a 9 icchù\\ ab hit à? a, a u t s u k y a , etc. — l%$ïïfcPTT«I *11f«f$| HH9 HT l3 cfipT I ) that has no direct object, but is aetherealised as it were, that is, in his terms, « generalised ” : ^ Wn^TT-.............iClearly then these v à s a n â s bring us to a state of generalised love, which is why it is called a u t s u k y a, for it would seem that a u ts u k y a is a longing with no particular object. This is in fact what takes place during a dramatic performance of the Ü ä k u n la la , for we do not wish to actually possess herself.4.

We are now ready to read the two important passages from the Locano.11. W e have barely couched the surface of Abhinava’s aesthetic philosophy. There are of course a great deal of interesting passages from his philosophical workB which shed light on the issues discussed here. Lack of space prevents us from .examining all of these passages here, but we cannot refrain from noting briefly at least some of them. The first verse of the last chapter of Utpalâcârya’s J ê o a r a- p r a t y a b h i j f l ä ( B h ä a k a r iy vol. II, p. 280 ) reads :tST IIl“ The one highest God is the very Self of all beings. He assumes the form of everything. He is filled with the unbroken notion : ‘ I am this ( universe ) \\ ”In his commentary to this Abbinava speaks of the consciousness that is not restricted by time and space, just as he speaks of the consciousness in a play that is not restricted by time and space ( e. g. A b h i n a v a b h â r a t i, p. 280 ) : *ï?r:«T «T I And later in bis Vrtti : p a r â n u n m u *k h a a v û t m a v i& r û n t i r û p â h a n i v i m a r fa p a r i p û r n a h. “ Filled with the notion of 11 * ness \"which takes the form of rest in the self which is not directed towards anything else. 11 These are precisely the terms in which Abhinuva speaks of the aesthetic experience.See also Abhinavars T a n t r a s â r a , p. 19, where two interesting verses sum up the third o h n i k a. The verses, oddly, are in Prakrit. Note that s a im b h â i in the Prakrit should be tianslated into Skt. as s v a y a m b h â li and not as e a t y a m b h â ti as in the c h ä y ä given in the footnote on p. 19. Also, s a r a h a n a in the Prakrit should be trans* lated as s a r a b h a s a and not as s a r a h a n y o . Perhaps too oue should emend v i m r f t a• T û p a m into v i m r s ta r ttp e to agree with d a r p a n e in the first line.

However, our interpretations differ so often and so radically from his, that we felt we were not duplicating any labour by translating this important passage. It did not seem to us necessary to point out all the places where we differ.2. This is an earlier version of what Abbinava later expands into the famous commentary on the r a s a s ü t r a in the A h h i n a v a b h â r a t ï, Vol. I, p, 277 ff.

Nor can rasa, which stems from a poem dealing with a subject like the life and deeds o f Rama, etc., be apprehended as belonging to oneself. For if it were appre­hended as belonging to oneself, we would have to say that real emotions ( such as sexual desire, etc. ) arise in one’s own self ( while witnessing a dramatic performance ). And that would be most improper in the case of ( somebody like ) Sita.1 For ( she ) cannot be the ( älambana ) vibhäva2 with respect to a spectator.* 1 2 3 Should it be argued that what causes (prayojaka) her to become a vibhàva ( cause ) of arousing ( vikàsa ) latent emotions ( vàsanà ) ( of love, etc. ) ( in the spectator ) is the fact that ( she stands as a symbol for ) non-personalised ( sàdhârana ) womanhood ( käntätva ), we reply : how would such a process be possible in the case of the description of gods, etc. ? Nor can it be said that during’ a dramatic performance ( madhye) there is ( on the part o f the spectator ) a recollection of his own wife.4 How canC o n t i n u e d f r o m p r e v i o u s p a g e )( For full bibliographical information on each item consult the bibliography at the end of the volume): (1) S'ridhara’s commentary on the K â v y a p r a k â ê a ; (2) Mànikya- candra’s commentary on tho K P . ; (3) Candîdûsa’s commentary on the K P . ; (4) Heina- candra’s K â v y â n u ê â s a n a ; (5) Prabbäkara’s R a s a p r a d ip a ; (6) Vidyâdhara’s E k â v a l i ; (7) Vidyftüâtha’s P r a t à p a r u d r a y o & o b h û s a y a, and finally (8) Jagannâtha’a R a sa * g a i ïg â d h a r a.1. Abbinava, following Bhattatauta, uses this same argument against S'ahkuka, A . B h ., p. 277 ( Gnoli, p. 7 ) :«T f t tfrcïT « f r i f a - U « I“ The actor does not think to himself : 4 Sita belongs to me ’. ”2. BN means tlmt Sita is onljr a v ib h ä v a with regard to Rama, not to thespectator. But what can this mean ? V i b h ä v a a are all in regard to r a s a . After all, it is not Rama who experiences r a s a in regard to Sita, so how can she be his v ib h ä v a ? W e must take the word v ib h ä v a to be a loose usage for k ä r a y a o f true r a t i in Rama,but this has to do with the real world and not with r a s a .3. Bhattanäyaka ( BN ) uses sophistry to prove that r a s a is perceived neitheraB located in the s ä m ä jik a ( â t m a g n ta ) nor as located in someone else ( e. g. thecharacter portrayed or the actor who presents that character ). By ruling out both the possibilities, â t m a g a t a t v a and p a r a g a t a t v a of r a s a p r a t l t i f he oomes to the conclu« sion that r a s a h 11a p r a t i c a t e , “ r a s a is not perceived at all ” . According to BN we do not have any p e r c e p t i o n ( p r a t i t i ) of r a s a, but only its enjoyment ( b h o g a or b h o g i. k a r a y a ). BN is not against admitting r a s a in the s ä m ä jik a — he is against admitting its p r a t y a y a ( perception ) in the s ä m ä }ik % . Iusteiid of p r a t y a y a t BN uses his own terminology b h o g a and b h o g lk a r a y a. The difference between the two ideas seems to us only one of terminology.For the same arguments, see the A . B h .y p. 278, ( Gnoli,p. 10 ).4. We have translated this sentence as if it were a serious observation, namely that when the spectator sympathises he does not remember his own personal life. However, it is possible that it is meant humorously as well : “ for God’s sake, you do not want to have to remember your own wife when watching love scenes ! ”XX"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"643TFcR*r( uddïpana ) vibhàvas in the form of such deeds as building a bridge over the ,ocean, etc., by extraordinary heroes like Rama ever become generalised, ' ( since nobody else could ever do them ) ? Nor can it be said that Rama, etc., as full of energy,1 etc., is remembered,2 because he has never actually .formed a part of our ( past ) experience ( such that now we could remember him ). To perceive ( Rama’s ) energy ( utsäha, the sthàyibhàva of virarasa ) from a verbal source of knowledge (sabda) is not to experience rasa? just as when we directly watch a couple making love there is no aesthetic pleasure.4 As for the theory that rasas arise (utpatti)y (the difficulty is that) because of the (spectator’s) (real) sorrow (karma, i. e. soka) he .would be genuinely unhappy and would no longer return to watch such dramatic performances in which (there was) karuna {rasa) ever again. Therefore rasa does not '‘ arise” (utpatti), nor is it induced by suggestion1. The important word is Rama, to which nisâhâdimân is simply an adjective. The âdi stands for ratim ân, etc., depending on the rasa. But none of these states form part of our own experience of Rama, since we never knew him. Even though the spectator might apprehend the sthâyibhâvas like utsäha, etc., in Rama, etc., from the words actually used in the poem, still it will be only Sabdaj any aj flâna of the utsäha in Rama. This kabdajanyajftâna cannot lead to rasotpatti in the sahrdaya. The reason for this is given in the form of an analogy in the next sentence : \" Just as when a :couple is actually observed (pralyaksa ) making love to each other, there is no rasotpatti in the observer ( rasopajana means ratibhïivâsvâdana - an aesthetio experi­ence of love ). ” But we cannot quite see the point in the argument, in spite of the analogy. However, to have seen this “ generalised ” nature of drama was one of the great moments of literary criticism, and it appears that this view belongs to Bbat- tanâyaka, for Abhinava simply takes it over. Bhâvanâ is the same as sâdhâravïkarana. Änanda does not use this term.2. The reason we cannot remember Rama is that the definition of memory in Sanskrit logic involves anubhava, direct experience.3.

The same difficulties would arise now as arose before. Therefore rasa is not ( directly ) perceived {pratiyate ),3 nor conjured up ( utpadyate ), nor. suggested ( abhivyajyate ) by poetry. But poetic words are of an altogether different nature from ordinary words, thanks to the three functions (tryamsatä),■ possessed by them. Denotation (abhidhàyakatva) is concerned with the.i literal meaning; universalisation ( bhàvakatva) is concerned with rasa, etc.;4 and aesthetic enjoyment ( bhoktrtva ) is concerned with the sensitive reader ( sahrdaya ). These are three ( separate ) functions which are the constituents of words used in poetry ( or literature ). If one were to claim that in1.

Guoli takes it very diflerently from the way we have ( see o p . c it . p. 45, 108 ). We take it to mean that the spectator would actually feel the need t o acquire ( a r j a n a ) the object ( v i fa y a ) on tbo stage, i. e. he would want to get up and take Sita away. But the expression t à r a t a m y a is, we admit, inconvenient. We suppose the idea is that some people will make a greater effort ( i. e. will be more excited ) to attain the object, and others less. See J J a sa r ü p a k a IV. 39 and A v a l oka on the same : ^^erf ani f l l1 fche story of the backwoodsman in tho gallery who shot the “ villain ” on the stage.2 . It is not clear to us just what Bhattanâyaka intends by the term a b h i­v y a k t i. He must of course have known the doctrine of v y a i i ja n â as put forth by Ânandâvardhana. Abbinava uses tbo term a b h i v y a k t i as synonymous with e< sugges« * tion Bhattanâyaka however understands w a b h i v y a k t i 71 to be a sort of production which he places on tho same level as n t p a t t i, since his argument é r n g â r a s y a a b h i• v y a k t a u y etc., really applies to u tp a ttip a k s a. Abhinava points out that in a verse which he quotes from BN, the expression v y a r ig y a occurs. The verse is :3Tr<sr«*n<qi3w OT ^F*rr*f 3^ n( Gnoli, p. II, A . U h .

Unless ho could mean by p r a t i y a t e M direct experience ” , which is of course not what takes place in the theatre, since, as BN already pointed out, we do not know the people on the stage and are thus not personally involved.4.

And what purpose would the avoidance of such faults as cacophony ( srutidusta )? etc., serve ? Therefore there is a second function4 known as generalisation ( bhävanä ) ( responsible for bringing about the experience ) of rasa ( i. e. o f the sthâyibhàvas ), thanks to which, denotation ( abhidhä ) assumes a new dimension ( vilaksanà ). This function of universalisation ( bhàvakatva ) with respect to the rasas ( i. e. sthâyibhàvas ) is in fact ( mma ) what is, in poetry, responsible for making the vibhàvas, etc., universal.

What does he mean when ho says that one mental state cannot nourish another, since any mental state is in constant flux ? The analogy of a river does not hold good, for while it is in a constant state of Hux, it is nonetheless augmented by minor streams. Why should not a major ( or abiding, s t h â y i n ) mental state be intensified by subsidiary and fleeting mental states? Does S'ankuka mean that there is no question of any mental state being strengthened by any other mental state, since all of them are after all in a state of flux-always changing - diminishing in their intensity with the passage of time? But this does not seem true. Does he mean that it is ouly in the theatre that one has a coucentrated meutal mood, not iu real life? If so, would he argue that Rama’s love was constantly changing? Unlikely. What then could he mean ?3. This passage has been expanded in the A. B h . p. 274:1 T h *8 *9 very fcrue> and wel1 observed, but what doe9 it prove ?

If one were to say ( that rasa, i. e. ratyàdibhàva exists ) in the spectator, how could there be delight ( camatkära )?

It is not possible ( precisely ) to imitate any one particular ■mood because o f the endless and ever-changing ( aniyata ) degrees o f intensity ( o f the mental moods ).

The nature of this experience is the enjoyment of the sthàyibhàva ( love, etc. ) ( thus inferred as existing in the actor ) and it is different from memory, because it is the object of the appre­hension that \" this Rama ( standing before me, as represented by the actor ) is happy* 2 ( because he is with Sita ) This rasa does not depend on any other thing beyond the actor who is apprehended ( by the spectator ) as non- different from the character being portrayed, and the spectator who is the relisher ( o f the ratibhàva, etc., inferred by him as existing in the actor). Only that much3 ( and nothing more is required for the aesthetic experience of the rasa ). Therefore, rasa exists only in the drama, and not in the charac- ters to be portrayed, etc. This is the view of some ( i. e. of Sankuka ).Others4 say : the appearance (semblance, avabhâsa) of a sthàyi (bhäva) in the actor, which has been brought about by the dramatic accessories ( sämagri ) such as abhinaya, etc., is like the appearance ( semblance ) of a1.

As proof of this, he points out that many dances do not have anything to correspond to them in real life. ( What in the outside world bears any resemblance whatsoever to Beethoven’s last quartets?) Note too, what Abhioava says in the A . B h . vol.

This was not so, less than fifty years ago.1. These are parallel terms, a v a b h â v o k ti corresponding to l o k a d h a r m i and v a k r o k t i to n ä t y a d h a r m l as applied to k â v y a . Thus Abhinava is using the terms in their widest sense. Bhàmaha too ( V. 66 II. 85,1. 30) uses v a k r o k it to apply to all forma of a la h k à r a . But he defines a va b h â vo k ti ( II. 93 ) as a separate figure of speech* (T hus De’s remark, V a k r o k t% jiv ita % p. 23 : “ Kuntaka follows Bhämaha in rejecting a v a b h â v o k ti as an a la n k à r a ” is not true. It stems from the qualifying phrase in Bhàmaha : i t i k ecit p r a c a ç k a te, which does indicate doubt on Bhamaha’s part, but not com plete rejection. ) Dandin ( II. 363) divides v à n m a y a into two realms : s v a b h à v o k ti and v a k r o k t i. See also Udbhata. III. 8-9. The most elaborate discussion on a va b h â ­v o k t i is found in the first chapter of Kuntaka’s V a k r o k li j i v it a . V a k r o k t i of course for Kuntaka is just what d h v a n i is for Ananda, only it is even wider in its embrace. S v a b h à v o k t i is the a l a n k ä r y a, the k ä v y a s a r i r a to which v a k r o k t i is applied. See the valuable article by V. Raghavan, “ History of Svabhàvokti ” in “ S o m e C o n c e p t s, etc*It is tempting to see the division in Skt. poetry as that of realism and romanticism. Certainly verses that illustrate a va b h â vo k ti tend to be more simple and direct, and to deal with less exalted subjects. Moreover, the passage from the L o c a n a supports this conjecture. There are not a great many Skt. poets who excelled in realism. Profes* sor Ingalls has written about one who did, YogeSvara, in two remarkable articles : <c A Sanskrit Poetry of Village and Field : Yogesvara and His Fellow Poets ” J .

Raghavan Felicitation Volume, A d y a r L i b r a r y B u l l e t i n, Vols. 21-22, 1967-68, Madras, pp. 185 ff. A poem that deserves to be much better known in this respect is Abhinanda’a K â d a m b a r l k n t h à s à r a, quoted by Abhinava several times, which contains some remarkable examples of well-observed minor moments in life.2. Against B n l a p r i y â ( p. 186 ), we take a la u k ik a to construe with the v i b h â v a s, etc. In other words, the v ib h â v a s are a la u k ik a in so far as they are called v ib h â v a s . It would not make much sense to associate the word with the gwnas them­selves.3. These are the M d a g u n a s mentioned by Bharata, Dandin and Vämana. Ânandavardhana com pletely altered the older teaching of Dandin (I . 41-42) and Vâmana ( I. 2. 11 ) on g u n a s by bringing them under his S3Tstem of r a s a . For him, the g u n a s are the properties of r a s a ( as opposed to the a la n k â r a s ). See under II. 7 of the D h v a n y â l o k a . Instead of the usual ten g u n a s accepted by Bharata, Dandin and Vämana, Ananda accepts only the three mentioned here.

By 9aying na p r a t i y a t e r a s a li, obviously he could not be claiming that r a s a does not exist, only that p r a t l t i is not an adequate ‘word to express how it is experienced.

Abhinava also accepts the reason for this statement : ra s a is made universal, s ä d h ä r a n i k a r a n a y which is one of the most important concepts of Skt. poetics, first met with ( under the name of bhUvantl ) in BN and universally accepted hy later writers.4.

We think it very likely that thi9 is what he means ( how else could we interpret the line? ) for he ha9 made similar statements earlier : in the first U d d y o t a, commenting on a verse by his teacherBhattendurâja, he says : «T ïf 1 ( p. 127 )."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"A B B I N A VA*S P H I L O S O P H Y O F A E S THETICS73exist outside of the imagination ). Moreover, though as cognition they are the same, nonetheless such forms of perception as direct perception ( pràtyaksikì ), inferential perception ( änumäniki ), that which arises from verbal testimony ( àgamotthà ), that which is caused by intuition ( pratibhäna- krta ), and that which stems from yogic sight ( yogipratyaksajä i. e. telepathy, etc. ) are distinguished from one another by the means through which they are brought about. So also the perception ( piatiti ) of rasa, for which other names are carvanä ( relish ), àsv'adana ( gustation ), bhoga ( enjoyment ), ( is a form o f perception different from these other types of perception ), because the set of factors, namely the vibhàvas, etc., helped by sympathetic response ( hrdayasamvàda), etc., which lie at the base ( nidâna ) of the aesthetic experi­ence are of a transcendental nature. When we say that “ rasas are perceived ” ( we are using language loosely ) like when we say that he is cooking the boiled rice ( odanampacati) ( where to be more precise we should really say tandulàn pacati, since odana is the finished product ), for rasa is the process o f perception (pratìyamàna eva hi rasah)8 itself ; and rasano (aesthetic experience) is a particular kind of perception ( i. e. it is brought about by the sàmagrì such as vibhàvas, etc., in literature ) ( pratitir eva visistà rasano ). This perception ( of rasa ) in drama is distinct from every-day cases of inference, though it depends on inference in the initial stages ( since one first infers from the vibhàvas, etc., the sthàyibhàva in the person being portrayed ). In poetry too this perception ( of rasa ) is different from other kinds of verbal cognition ( i. e. abhidhä, tätparya and laksanä ), but in the initial stages it depends on abhidhä as a means ( of reaching the suggested sense).

Hence it is, that sympathetic response ( from the spectators ) is difficult to achieve in the case of the presentation of the doings of Gods. For they ( i. e. the Gods ) are not subject to any suffering, so that from the description of ( that suffering and of ) the means used by them to overcome it, the spectators may derive instruction. There is however nothing contradictory in introducing even a divine heroine ( as opposed to a hero ), as for example Urvaéi ( in Kalidasa’s V ih r a m o v e a U y a m ), for her actions are presumed to be plausible because of the actions of the ( human ) fiero ( in that drama ). ”'W e are not certain of the phrase : p r a t y u t a dexnïnàm a d h i y â d h â n a m p r a a i d - d h i r i g h d t a k a m.

Moreover ( Bhattanàyaka is wrong, because ) this perception in the form of aesthetic enjoyment ( rasano ) does arise ( utpadyate ). And in bringing about this perception ( tatra ) the function is the suggestiveness (dhvanana ), i. e. the vyanjana o f the literal sense and denotative words,1 which is a function different from abhidhä. ( What Bhattanàyaka calls ) the function of aesthetic relish ( bhogikarana ) with regard to rasa in poetry is nothing other than suggestiveness ( dhvanana ). As for bhàvakatva, which ( for us ) consists in the use ( parigraha ) o f proper gunas and aïahkàras,* 1 2 3 4 * * * we will speak of this in some detail ( later in the second Uddyota ). What is new about it ? When you ( Bhattanàyaka ) say that poetry is the producer ( bhàvaka ) of rasas, through bhävanä, you have yourself revived the theory o f utpatti (which you supposedly destroyed).8 One cannot say that in poetry words alone are productive ( o f rasa)* forC o n t i n u e d f r o m p r e v i o u s p a g e )interesting pussage where be justifies the nine s t h â y i b h â v a s in all human beings ( though some predominate in certain people and others in others )( and ends by saying: «f STT# *T?fcT I In fche courB° of our beginningless journey throughthis universe, we have experienced all emotions. Thus nobody fully aware of bis own humanity can fail to be moved by another person’s experiences. On p. 283 {of the A . B h .) , Abhinava quotes a fascinating line from Patanjnli II. 4 : ^ Ç?T-\\ 4< The fact that Caitra is in love with one woman does not mean that he is out of love with others. ” This is uot meant humorously, but only that when Caitra is in love with one woman, this means that his love for that particular woman is dominant in his mind. It does nob mean that his mind is altogether devoid of love for any other woman. He of course has love in his mind for other women also, but this love is more feeble than the other, and hence overpowered by the love he feels for a particular woman at any given moment.1. Suggestion applies to the v d e y a ( e. g. in v a * t n d h v a n i % where the literal meaning suggests the v y a h g y d r t h a ) and to the v d e n k a (since m c a h a s are v y a fija k a s ),2. This is somewhat curious. Where has BN said that b h d v a k a tv a is s a m u c i • 't a g u n d l a d k d r a p a r ig r a h a ? For BN b h ä v a n ä is s à d h ü r a n i k a r a n a . How can this be associated with g u n a s and a la n k d r a s ? However, Abbinava himself, in the A. B h. p. 277, uses these very words to characterise BN’s views. Ths wording in the A. B H .is slightly different : ............. tfu| | The phraseni b i d a n i j a m o h a s a n k a t u k d r i n d on p. 277 of the A . B h. vol. I, is puzzling. Perhaps we must read s a m k a t a n iv H t i k d r i n d .3. This is well observed. It is true that BN must use some expression like .u t p d d y a l e , regardless of w hat word he chooses. Thus w hen he says b h â v ite ea r a s e ,( L o c a n a p. 183 ), one must paraphrase by b h ä v a n a y d s a m a r p i i t ca r a s e.4. Abbiuava’s point seems to be that BN said ( L o c a n a , p. 182 ) that thereare tbroo functions of w o r d s : I But unfair ofAbhinava, since he too says over and over that v y a i i j a n â is a i a b d a v y d p d r a, SurelyBhattanàyaka must have meant the same thing ? It is most unlikely that he would have restricted the function to words. On the other hand, Abhinava himself has argued for the importance of i i l d a.

Nor can one say that it is meaning alone ( that gives rise to rasa in poetry ) for if the same meaning is expressed by other words (sabdàntarenàrpyamànatve) rasa does not arise.1 We ( the Dhvanivàdins ) have explained that both word and meaning ( are helpful in the presentation of rasa ) when we said : “ Wherever a meaning or a word manifests a suggested meaning, ” 1 2 3 etc. Therefore by means o f the function known as suggestiveness ( as a means ), and through ( the use o f ) gunas, alankâras and propriety ( aucitya), etc., as a procedure (itikartavyatä), poetry which is possessed of the power of conveying (bhävaka) (rasas) conveys ( bhävayati ) rasas, and in this three-fold scheme of bhävanä ( as accepted by the Mîmàmsakas )3 suggestiveness fits in as the means1.

A l .3. In brief, the A f ï m â m s â position is as follows : h h d v a m i, creative force, or creative energy, is of two kinds : ( 1 ) à â b d ï9 and ( 2 ) â r t h i . It is a particular kindof activity in an efficient or operative agent ( b h d v a y i t r ) 9 which is conducive to the production of the effect ( or conducive to the coming into being of that which is going to come into being ). &dbdî bh ä va ?iä means verbal creativity, or word-efficient force. Â r t h i b h ä v a n ä is purposive creativity, or end-efficient force. iSäbdi b h ä v a n ä is concerned with how the words in a scriptural or secular command operate in bringing about the fulfilment of that command. A r t h i b h ä v a n ä is concerned with how a particular action ordered by the scriptures or by a human master is carried out by the person ordered to do it, with a view to achieving the expected result. In this passage we are concerned with ä r th ib h ä v a n ä and not with k ä b d ib h ö v a n ä . B h ä v a n ä consists of three elements : ( 1 ) s ü d h y a ( objective aimed at by the action ), ( 2 ) s ä d h a n a ork a r a n a ( the means leading to that objeotive ) and ( 3 ) i t i k a r t a v y a t ä ( procedure to be followed in reaching the objeotive ) ( kirn h h ä v a y e t, k e n a b h d v a y e t 9 k a lh a m b h d v a y e t )# According to Abhinava, Bhattanâyaka has borrowed the word b h ä v a n ä from tho Mimàinsakas. In k a r m a k d n d a 9 ìd the case of a sacrifice Y\\ke j y o t i f t o m a ( j y o t i s t o m e n a s v a r y a k à m o y a j e t a ), s c o r g a is the s â d h y a . The j y o t i t ç o m a sacrifice is the s ä d h a n a or k a r a n a, and the performance of the minor sacrifices p r a y ä j a, a n u y ä j a, etc., is the i t i k a r t a v y a t ä . In poetry and drama, r a s a ( or r a s â s o â d a ) is the s d d h y a, d h v a n a n a or v y a f i j a n ä v y ä p ä r a is the s ä d h a n a or k a r a n a 9 and g u m ï l a n k â r a n c i t y û d i ( i. e. s a m u c i* t a g u n d l a n k d r a p a r i g r a h a ) is the i t i k a r t a v y a t ä . Thus according to Abhinava, d h v a n a n a is the k a r a n a or s ä d h a n a by which r a s ä s r ä d a is brought about. This is what hemeans by the sentence M\\=Hl*ff WffTtf 1 He means thatk ä v y a is the b h ä v a k a of the r a s d s v d d a i just as the performer of a sacrifice is the b h ü v a y i t r ( i. e. b h ä v a k a ) of the s v a r g a r û p a p h a l a ."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"a b i i i k a v a’s p h i l o s o p h y o f a e s t h e t i c s77( katana).* Nor does bhoga ( aesthetic enjoyment ) come about through the words used in poetry (alone), but rather ( it comes about) through the removal of the obscuration (sankata) (o f the blissful nature of the Self) caused by the blinding darkness which is itself the result of deep ignorance ( moha). In the transcendental ( lokottara ) aesthetic enjoyment ( bhoga ) that is to be brought about (in this manner), for which another name is âsvàda (enjoyment), and which consists of dritti, vistat a and vikäsa,1 2 suggestiveness alone ( according to us, should be ) given the highest place of honour (mürdhàbhisikta). When suggesti­veness ( of poetry in relation to rasa ) is admitted, this so-called bhogakrttva (of poetry) inevitably follows. For bhoga is nothing other than the inexplicable thrill of delight (camatkàra) that arises from aesthetic enjoyment (rasyamànatà). But it is not correct to say that aesthetic pleasure ( âsvàda ) is divided ( only ) into three, druti, etc., ( because there are innumerable variations possible ) on account o f the endless variety created by the principal-subordinate relation among the ( gunas ) sattva, etc. We admit ( with Bhattanàyaka) that aesthetic enjoyment is similar to the joy ( that comes from realising one’s identity with) Brahman.3 ( We also admit with Bhattanàyaka4 that ) the intellectual1.

By feeling these deeply ( carxam), the heart ( o f the sage Vàlmîki) sympathises (with the plight o f the male bird), and ( finally ) he identifies ( with the situation ).

Scott, N. Y. 1962 ).1. Abhinava takes d e a n d v a not to mean “ pair ” but to mean actual “ sexual intercourse ” ( s a h a c a r y a ), a moaning the dictionaries do not seem to sanction.2. For the significance of the change that both Abhinava and Änandn make In the legend by having the female bini killed rather than the male, see J. Masson : “ Who Killed Cock Kraunca; Abhinnvagupta’s Reflections on the Origin of Aesthetic fixperience ” , J o u r n a l o f the O r ie n t a l I n s t i t u t e , Haroda, Vol. XV11I, No. 3, 1069.3.

But in ka r u n a there is none. This makes it much closer to “ tragedy ” than has generally been acknowledged. Thus in speaking of the R à m à y a n a, Abbinava will point out in his L o c a n o to the fourth U d d y o t a ( p. 680 ) that Kama and Sita are “ permanently ” separated, thus showing that the final verses of the epic which speak of their re* union in heaven, have no impact on the reader in auy aesthetic sense.4.

The emotional upheaval in the mind of the sage was like the overflowing o f a jug filled to the brim with water, or like the cry of sorrow which is of the nature of the effusion of the mental mood ( o f grief). The words that the sage uttered (on that occasion) are suggestive of the state of his mind according to the maxim that exclamations ( of joy, sorrow, etc. ) are suggestive of ( the relevant ) natural moods, even in the absence of a fixed convention ( between them and mental moods, unlike what is the case for words and their literal meanings ).* 1 2 3“ Oh hunter, may you never, for eternal years, attain to stability ( pratisthh ) ( in this world ) since you killed, from a pair of Kraunca birds, the male ( when ) he was engrossed in love ( - making ).But it should not be supposed that Vàlmìki was (actually experiencing) sorrow ( in the ordinary sense ).

He takes this fine analogy a step further, and says that the mind is im­pressed with the emotions it contemplates. First the mind becomes soft and pliable, and then comes the hard substance like the drama or the play when the mind receives its impression, the way sealing wax is impressed with a seal-ring.1. In K.

For this to be the case, we must say that he was the audience, as it were, of his own verse ! So, Abbinava envisages the situation something like this : Vulraiki sees( C o n t i n u e d o n n e x t p a g e"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"845 T P W Tit possible for somebody burdened with grief1 to utter a verse (at the very moment of his sorrow ).C o n t i n u e d f r o m p r e v i o u s p a g e )the killing of the bird. He is deeply moved to the point of uttering a poem about it. But of course as long as he is simply in sorrow, that is, feeling one of the primary emotions that belong to real-lifo situations, he does not have the necessary “ artistic distance ” which would enable him to engage in poetic creation. So, at some magic poiut he stops feeling sorrow ( if in fact Abbinava ever felt that he did ), and it is as if be were witnessing a drama in a play-house. It is at this stage of some distance that he speaks his poom. Each time he contemplates what he uttered, he ie the s a h r d a y a, the r a s i k a, the spectator ( which would explain why he says kirn id a m v y d h r t a m maya at R â m . I. 2. 16 ). i. e. he is again in an a la u k ik a state of aesthetic enjoyment. The êoka that he formerly felt has been transformed into art. While this is a pro­found interpretation of the famous incident,it should bo carefully noted that this could hardly have been what the author of the episode in the R d m d y a n a had in mind.

These terms have been used by J. R. R. Tolkieu in his essay u Oq Fairy-Stories ” , published in “ Tree & Leaf ” , Unwin Books, London, 1964. See also “ Secondary W orld s” by W. H. Auden, Faber & Faber, London, 1968. The world of the Râmâyaça belongs to what Tolkien calls Faerie, “ the perilous realm, and the air that blows in that country ”. Mortal men only exist there when they are enchanted. In modern times, perhaps only Tolkien himself, in “ The Lord of the Rings ” has managed to create an entire “ secondary” world. It is the greatness of Sanskrit literature that such autonomous worlds have been built — Kr$na*s world in the Bhâga- vatapuräna, and the dream world of the Yogaväsi$tha. The sustained effort of imagina­tive creation evidenced in the latter work is to our mind unparalleled in any other literature.1. Another point is that there can be no d u h k h a in r a s a, which is a synonym for d n a n d a, w bliss ” , as Abbinava points out again and agaiu. See De, H. 5. P . Vol, II, p. 132, and note the passage he quotes from the Â b h in a v a b h â r a t ï :“ For the spectators, the whole point of the drama is to produce pleasure, not sorrow, etc. ” It is almost certain that Viévanâtha’s remarks in the third p a r i c c h e d a of the S û h ü y a d a r p a n a were inspired by Abbinavagupta.

Creation takes place later, when the experience has been assimilated and is then contemplated. This is another of Àbhinava’s seminal ideas taken over by the later tradition.1. Reading s a m u c c h a l a n a . On p. (160) ( 86 B . P. ), top of the page, the term has been used of water overflowing from a jug. Actually though this is an error, for it is not the k a r u n a r a s a that overflows, but the original emotion. The word rasa is used loosely here to stand for both the final aesthetic result, r a s a proper, and to mean “ emotion ” in general.2. On p. 28 (p. 10, B. P.)} Abhinava has used this same expression. B. ed. reads* ( kabda ” which is a better reading. This is also the earlier reading that we have accepted in our translation of the Locanrt.\"4 V a ila k s a n y a here means “ charm ” , from thé notion of its being something completely different, è â b d a stands for é a b d a v y â p â r a.3. Is this famous line from Bhattanàyaka meant to show that the poet must be full of emotion, using r a s a in the wider sense, before he can w rite? In other words, is Bhattanàyaka saying that first one must be overwhelmed by an experience ! Or is he using r a s a in the technical sense to mean that first the poet himself actually has an aesthetic experience, And then records it, so that others may share it ? Sanskrit poetic theory is not reAlly clear on precisely what the experience of the poet is in relation to that of the reader. Abhinava seems, in his more rigorous moments ( “ n c ity e ev a r a sä h h a tu lo k e ” ), to restrict the aesthetic experience to the reader, in which case the poet would be excluded. Bhattatauta, ( see L o c a n a, p. 92 B . P . ) however, says that this ex * perience ( a n n b h a v a ) is the same as that undergone by the reader, the poet and the n ä y a k a !

SA EVA. The use of the word “ alone ” ( eva ) shows ( that it alone is ) the Atman, not anything else. Therefore, what Bhatfcanayaka has said, namely :“ Because of the overriding importance of the words used, people class the sästra1 apart (from poetry and stories). They give the name àkhyana ( historical talc ) to compositions in which the sense conveyed by words is possessed of paramount importance. When both ( word and meaning) are subordinated, and ( all ) importance is given to the manner ( vyàpâra ), then it is called “ poetry ” ,2 ”is refuted. For if by “ manner '* he means that (function) whose essence consists in suggestiveness (dhvanana ) and which is of the nature of aesthetic enjoyment ( rasana), he will have said nothing new. If, on the other hand, he means by “ manner ” abhidhà, we have already shown earlier3 how it can­not be of major importance in poetry.He now explains the verse : VIVIDI!A. That which is (m ade) beautiful because of the high degree of excellence4 in respect to the ideas ( vàcya ), the words, and the structure ( racanà), having been diversified ( vicitram krtvà) so as to be favourable to the various rasas to be suggested, i. e. that which is endowed with gunas and aìankàras, both of words and meanings. There- 1 2 3 *1. é ü 8 t r a m here means the Veda. Bhattanâyaka’s point is that in the Veda the t€ letter ** is all-important. In stories, the meaning is important, and finally, in poetry, it is the manner in which something is told that counts the most. Cf. I. A. Richard's famous dictum : “ It is never what a poem which matters, but what it is ” .2. It is impossible to know just how indebted to Bhnttanäyaka Abhinava really is. We think, however, that the famous comparison of poetry to a loving wife, certainly was either taken directly from Hhuttnnäyaka, or was at least inspired by this very passage. Both ideas are in fact synthesised by S'ridhara in his commentary on the, K à v y a p r a h ì k a and by Vidyadhara's EkCivali ( K. P. Trivedi's edition.

The expression nihatasahacari3 ( “ the killed female ” ) expresses the vibhäva. The word àkrandita ( \"cries” ) expresses the anubhàva. JAN IT A.* One must supply : \" through attaining to the state of aesthetic enjoyment. ” Objection : if the verse arose from the aesthetic enjoyment of \" sorrow ” , how can one say that the soul of poetry is that suggested thing ( viz. rasa ) ? 5 ( i. e. only soka has been mentioned in the stanza, and not rasa). With this doubt in mind he says: SOKO HI. Sorrow ('soka) is the sthäyibhäva of karuna which consists in the aesthetic enjoyment of sorrow.0 Since the state of mind appropriate to the vibhävas and anubhävas in relation to the sthäyibhäva soka, when aesthetically enjoyed, becomes rasa, it is but proper7 to say thatabhixava’s p h i l o s o p h y of a e s t h e t i c s 871.

The objection must have been that if one accepts the suggestive function ( d h v a n a v y â p â r a ), which Bhattanàyaka does not, we will have to admit as examples of poetry, cases which merely include suggestion, but no charm. Thus s a r v a t r a means, as the K . says on p. 162 : s i m h o va tn h i t y â d â v a p i t a t h e t i. See p. 57 ( B.P. ed. ) of the text of the L o c a n a.3. Note that K. Sastri, on p. 164 of his U p a l o c a n a says that this is a p r a t ik a that only gives the first words, but that it is meant to read : n ih a t a s a h a c a r iv ir a h a * k à la r a , i.e. that it stands for the male k r a n fic a ! But this is mere sophistry. Had Abhinava meant this, he would have said so.4. Note that Abhinava has said on ( p. 79, SO, and 83 ) of the L o c a n a that r a s a is not j a n i t a , i. e. the function is not j a n a n a t “ production Thus he is of course bothered by the phrase k r a u H c â k r n n d a ja n ita h êok a ev a . He therefore says here ( p. 89 ) that one must add the phrase : c a r v a n â g o c a r a tv e n a .5. The objection is that in the k ä r ik ä only &oka is mentioned, not r a s a. This is perfectly true, for the point of the K â r i k â is to show the existance of a p r a t l y a * m â n â r t h a i. e. that êoka is here suggested, and uot directly stated. However Abhinava and Änanda are probably correct to go further in their interpretations, for if this is all the author of the K â r i k â meant, it would be a very weak argument; for in the K a m a * y a n a itself, we are directly told both before and after this verse that Välmfki was in sorrow !

He might well have been aware of the fact that this was an interpolation, for he says : “ in ( some ) old manuscripts ” . On the other hand, he was eager to attempt to show that Bharata in fact sanctioned b d n ta ra sa , even though he may not have said this in so many words. This comes out even in the adjective he applies to p u s t a k a y c ir a n ta n a t thereby attempting to give them some prestige and worth in the eyes of his readers.2.

(26).1 2 3 4The rasa that is not opposed ( to the principal rasa ), though occur­ring in the same character, but is opposed because of its immediate occur­rence (after it), should be introduced into the work only after the interven­tion of a third rasa. As, for instance, känta and srngàra have been introduced into the Nàgànanda* ( with the intervention of adbhuta ). Santa, which is characterised by the full development of the happiness that comes from the destruction of desires,5 is indeed apprehended ( as one of the rasas by sensi­tive readers ).6 And so it has been said :1.

By e k à s r a y a tv e n i r d o s o, we think that the author of the K â r ik à s meant to convey the fact that two opposing r a s a s may reside in one person if a long time elapses. I. e. a man can be a k ä m in in one part of a poem and eventually become a v ir ä g in in another. Bhartrhari’s k a ta k a tr a ya m ?4. The idea in citing the N à g à n a n d a is that two opposing rasa«, namely ér A g â r a and k ä n ta , are interrupted by a third rasa, a d b h u ta, that is not opposed to either of them. Abbinava has a long passage where he gives quotations from the drama exemplifying all the three r a s a s. The only noteworthy expression there is k r a m a p r a s a r a s a m h h d v a n ä h h ip r ä y a , which means the orderly progression of the rasas. First comes k à n ta ra sa, right at the very beginning of the drama ( in fact in the P r a s t a - va n a ), when Jïmütavâhana goes off to the forest. Then the s th à y ib h â v a of a d b h u ta, namely v i s m a y a ( over the beautiful singing ), is introduced, and this forms the tran­sitional phase to krAgära. But note that this is a weak argument, for adbhuta hardly forms an important element in this drama. Tt is there, formally, only because of the one phrase : a h o g i t a m, a h o v d d it r a m } which Jïmütavâhana says when be first hears M a l a y a v a t i singing and playing on the lute. Moreover, all of these three ra s a s occur in the first act. The rest of the drama is exclusively concerned with the hero’s efforts to give up his life for the sake of another.5. This definition of éànta is needlessly ^complicated. A single long com­pound would have been more clear : [ | ^ ^ u,': 16. Änanda is seriously concerned with showing that kà n ta ra sa does exisb ( p r a t i y a t a eva and a sti känto ra sa h ). It is, therefore, likely that this was a controver­sial point in the ninth ceutury (indeed it has remained controversial until the present day ). Since the K à r i k à s mention all of the eight r a s a s by name, at some point or another, there is absolutely no reason why they should not have mentioned kdnta} had känta been known to their author. The fact that kànta is never mentioned in a single K â r i k à leads us to believe that their author was unaw'are of its existence ( at least of its formal existence as a rasa, though there is no reason why he should not have known about kànta as an attitude ), and moat probably, therefore, lived before the time of Udbhata, the first author to mention känta as a rasa,X V"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"963TTFR*T“ The pleasures of love, as well as the great pleasures of heaven, do not equal even the sixteenth part of the happiness that succeeds the des­truction of desire. ” 1Even should it be claimed that this is not within the range of experience of all men, still it is not possible simply on this account1 2 3 to reject what is the special state of mind of great men who are not like ordinary people. Nor is it correct to include sànta within virarasa, because vira depends on egoism, whereas sànta consists exclusively in the destruction of any feeling o f self.8 If, in spite of this distinction, one should still claim that sànta and vira arè' one and the same, then the same absurd reasoning would apply to vira and raudra. In the case of the states of mind in vira which depend on compassion,, etc., when there is a total absence of egoism, they can be considered as varieties* of sàntarasa. If, however, egoism remains, then they should be considered varieties of vira. If we understand things in this way, there will be no' contradiction. And therefore there is sàntarasa.

If the absence of desires (which is the meaning of irsnàksaya) is understood in the sense of a complete negation o f their existence, then it would amount to the absence of all mental activity and could not be regarded as a bhàva ( i. e. a positive mental state).

But when these causes disappear, they melt back into sànta; ” 3 and they then claim that sànta is common to all rasas and consider the sthàyibhàva of sànta to be that state of mind which has not been particularised into any other mood. This opinion is not very far removed from our position. The difference is one of pràgabhàva ( \" non­existence of something before its origination ” ) and pradhvamsàbhàva ( non­existence of something when it is destroyed ). And it is correct for desires to be destroyed. As has been said : 44 We can never find a man who is without desires from his birth. ” ( I. e. a person achieves this state at some later point in his life, and therefore desires can be destroyed. ) Even Bharata has shown his agreement by saying : “ Sometimes peace ” ,4 etc. The culmina-1. The point is this : what kind of negative is trsnüksaya ? Is it prasajya- pratiiedha, or paryndiUapralifedka Ì If it is the former, then there could be no question of a ôÂâraatall, and therefore this is unacceptable. Paryudâaa% which means c< exclusion of something with the possibility of including its opposite ”, is however acceptable. The two kinds of negation are paralleled by the two forms of absence, pràgabhàva and pvadhvamsâbhâva which will be mentioned later.2. This is from the Nè VI. 106-8 and forms part of the interpolated U in ta passage in that text.3. Note that this verse does not necessarily meau that their author accepted éânlarasa. Santa is simply the absence of emotion, the tabula rasa of the emotional board. It has nothing to do, necessarily, with mok$n or religious views in general.The stanza is given under fcbe beading of Aryâ verses and was, therefore, most probably part of a floating tradition, and not part of a continuously argued passage. On p. 326 of the N S (Vol. 1), several versos are introduced with these words : aträryöh ( with a variant reading of airdnnfiatttêÿâ <lryû bhavanli ) on which Abbinava has a most important remark : dT ÇrTT (Abbinava is fond of this rather rarely usedword ) I gf^ n îpTOîlÇiq fa%rçifTT: I a is. therefore, clearthat these verses are not by Bharata himself.

This is an important distinction, but it is difficult to know exactly what Abhinava has in mind. He udmibs that it is impossible to show the anuhhävas of the last phases of fanlaraxa, because at that point there is a complete absence of activity. ( This is an old Advaita problem, whether the JioanmuUa engages in activity or not. The conundrum had passed into Zen, where it has formed the basis of elaborate discussions concerning the identity of samsara and nirvana ). But Abhinava says that the same is true of êrngâra, etc. What does he mean ? We suppose he is referring to actual sexual intercourse. Now, why, precisely, does he say that this cannot be portrayed ? On the analogy of the earlier example of êïnta, it would seem to be because there is no physical activity. But this, of course, is uot true. Or does he mean, not only.sexual intercourse in general, i. e. not only the act of penetration, but also the actual moment of ejaculation ? lu this case, he might well mean that there is little or no activity. ( Which does not, however, imply that one cannot describe it, or even present ‘it on the stage ). Perhaps Abhinava simply means that it would be a breach of good taste to portray actual sexual intercourse on the stage. But if this is what he means, it is hard to see how this is relevant to àïntarasa and the absence of activity. Moreover, in the Abhinaoabhâraliy Abhinava makes the same remark concerning karnnarasa.3. Prom the Yogasülra, III, 10 and IV, 27.

For it has already been said that it is perceived. Objection : V ( Though it may be ) perceived, it is not esteemed by everybody.” 1 2 Yes, but according to this reasoning, men devoid of desire will not find love very praiseworthy either, and so it will have to be removed from the annals of rasa history ! 3 And so Anandavardhana says : “ Even if Objection : “ It is possible to consider this ( sänta ) as identical with that variety of vira which consists primarily of dharma ” . He answers this by saying : “ And not. ” tasya refers to vira. “ Is full of egoism, ” because the essence of utsäha ( energy, the sthäyibhäva of vira ) is to feel and say that “ I am such and such ” , etc. Asya ca refers to sänta. “ Between the two ” : ca here means ‘ although they are extremly opposed to each other because the one ( vira) is full of desire and the other ( sänta) is devoid of desire. * But vira and raudra are not even very much opposed, because their similarity consists in this, that in attaining dharma, artha or käma, both are ( equally ) helpful ( upayogitva ). Objection : “ If this is so, then compassionate heroism (dayävira) is either religious heroism (dharmavira) or generous heroism. (dänavira) (but not sänta).\"* No, it is neither of these two, because1. The point of the objection is that éânla is never experienced by ordinary people in everyday life, and therefore they will have no that will enable theacting to heighten the sthäyibhäva. in them to tbo status of a rasa. Abhinava replies that êânta is, in fact, experienced by ordinary men. He refers, we believe, to the analogy of feeling sated after a full moal.. 2. The opponent's argument, that énntaraaa appeals only to a select few, isvery strong and deserves a serious reply. Abhiuava's reply that for a vìtaràga, a man with no passions, érngâra will also hold no appeal, is very weak. The point, surely, is that érngâra is, or has been, within the experience of all men, whereas éânta is not, ( There are after all philosophical schools in India which denied the very existence of motosa, but none that ever denied the existence of érngâra ! ) This is presumably what the pürvapaksin means by slâghâspadam.. Moreover Abhinava has himself made fun of these very vilarägas who are unable to appreciate love. Dry Mimamsaka scholars he calls them. Of course, from a modern point of view, both objections can be simply met : it is not necessary to believe in something in order to enjoy it, for otherwise no Atheist would find any pleasure in reading religious poetry, or even the Upanisada for that matter. Brigid Brophy has said that most of us “ have replaced belief in fairies by a Midsummer Night’s Dream3.

But while disgust* can be a vyabhicàribhàva of sànta ( in the sense that it is transitory ), it cannot be its sthàyibhàva; because in the last phases of sànta, it is completely rooted out. The author of the Candrikh claims that bàntarasa should not be employed as the major rasa (in a work). We have not examined this opinion here since that would lead to digression (prasaiigàntaràt)? Because sànta is grounded on the highest goal of man,1. Read raaam viram and not rasaviram, It means virarasa.2. The point of the verse is that Bharata does not even mention dayâvira, and therefore it ia not rira at all, bat êânta, ( N&. VI, 79. p. 331 ) The real question to ask Abhinava would have been how he intends to understand dharmavlra, How does this really differ from dayâvira ?3. Something has been dropped from tbe Locana passage dayâvirâdinàû cetyâdigrahanena. The Bàlapriyâ says that one must supply dharmavïradânavirayor grahanam, But this seems a contradiction, for Abhinava has just finished saying that dharmavlra and dànavìra are rlrarasa, not êânlarasat whereas daydvira is êânta, However, this seems to be what Ananda has in mind, for otherwise it is difficult to know what Cidi will stand for. The view of Ananda is that all the three, dayàolraì dharmavlra and dànavìra^ are to be regarded as varieties of êânta ( as far as one can judge from his Vrtti ), if they are free from all traces of egoism. If not, they should be regarded as varieties of vlrarasa. Thus, Ananda does not appear to have shared Abhinava’s view that an}* form of dayâvira is necessarily êânta itself. Abhinava holds the view that dayavira is not to be identified either with dânarïra or with dharmavlra. He believes that dànavìra and dharmavlra are also to be regarded as varieties of êânta if they are divested of all traces of egoism. The difference between tbe positions of Ananda and Abhinava seems to be this : that, whereas Ananda regards dayavira as identical with iïïnfa only in certain circumstances ( viz. when there is uo egoism ), Abhinava regards dayavira as identical with êânta in all circumstances. This implies that there can be no egoism in dayävira for Abhiuava. Cf. Locana, p. 514 : dayavira* êabdena râ §ântam vyapadiêati.4.

For in the Ramayana, karunarasa has been hinted at by Vàlmiki when he says : “ Sorrow was transformed into poetry. ” 3 It isthat very (rasa) that has been sustained till the very end, since Vàlmiki ends his work with ( Rama’s) final separation from Sità.4 (The same applies to ) the Mahàbbàrata also, ( that work ) which has the form of a philosophical, (or didactic) text5 and possesses the beauty of poetry. When the great sage ( Vyàsa ) ends his work in such a way that it makes us feel melancholy ( vaimanasyadàyini ) by having the Vrsnis and the Pàndavas all finish in a pathetic way,6 and shows how his book puts emphasis on the creation o f world-weariness ( vairâgya ), he suggests by this emphasis that ( among the rasas) sàntarasa is meant to be predominant, and ( among the goals of life V moksa is primarily intended. Moreover this has been partially explained by other commentators as well. The father of the world ( lokanätha ), who wishes to lift people out of the morass of rampant ( udirna ) ignorance in which they have fallen, and provide them with the pure light of knowledge, has himself asserted this very thing when he said the following and many other things like it over and over :1. What makes the battles seem original each time, is not, we think, the use of d h c a n i in each particular description (though vira, b h a y â n a k a, bïbhalaa, and va u d ra , can all exist therein ), but their subordination to a more general aesthetic goal. So in the case of the R â m â y a n a, the constant expressions involving pain, sorrow, sepa­ration, etc., all conduce to the over-all end of the work, a feeling of k a rn n a . In the M a h à b h à r a ta, the more battles ore described, the more distasteful war becomes and the more firmly grounded our feeling of detachment, of world-weariness ( v a i r â g y a ). This theory, advanced as it is, would be appropriate to a work where the subject is a unified one, but it can hardly be applied to a work as varied ( in authorship as well ) as the M ah â b h â ra trty which contains several r a s a s, and cannot be viewed as a unity, Ä nan da of oourse could not have agreed.2. A r lh a v ié e s a here means a r th a n a v a tv a .3. See the passage translated from the L o c a n a on tho first U d d y o t a of the D h v a n y â l o k a, p. 79. The passage here is R â m â y a v a I, 2. 40.4. This refers to Sitä’s being swallowed up by the earth. At the very end of the R â m ü y a n a y Rama is promised a heavenly reunion. One wonders whether this obvious interpolation existed at the time of the D h v a n y â lo k a. If it did, then Änanda in an unprecedented critical attitude seems to suggest that this cannot concern the literary critic, which is a remarkably advanced view.5. Read éâ a tra rû p e on p. 330.6. Note what the D i d h i t i commentary (p. 611 ) says on this : rm ìfótRwL ^ft; “ If Gven they ended up like this, what hope is there forthe rest of u s?” The m a h â p r a sth â n a episode, especially the s v a r g â r o h a n a, does indeed convey an atmosphere of dejection.

The topic of the predominance and subordination of the different rasas has already been dealt with.2 It is no contradiction to say that if we do not take into consideration the ultimate ( paramarthika ) inner truth ( of the Mahàbhàrata), other subsidiary goals of life ( besides moksa) and other subsidiary rasas ( besides sàntarasa ) are beautiful in their own way ( svapràdhànyena, i. e. svavisaye). just as the body, when we do not take the soul into consideration, is thought of as beautiful, though it is really only subsidiary ( to the soul ). “ But ” , ( someone might argue ), “ in the Main- bhàrata all of the subjects to be presented have been given in the table of contents, and this one ( that you mention ) is not found there.3 On the contrary, we can understand, through the very words used ( svasabdani- veditatva ) in that section ( uddesa ), that the Mahàbhàrata teaches all the goals of man, and contains all the rasas. ” We reply : What you say is true. In the table of contents it has not been said in so many words that in the Mahà­bhàrata, sàntarasa is the main ( rasa ) nor that moksa is more important than all other human preoccupations. But it has been shown through suggestion, as in the following phrase : \" And the blessed eternal Vasudeva is praised herein. ” * The intended meaning, arrived at through suggestion, is that the deeds of the Pândavas, etc., which are recited in the Mahàbhàratay all end pathetically and are only a manifestation of cosmic ignorance; and that the blessed Vasudeva, whose form is the highest truth, is glorified there. “ There­fore turn your minds devoutly to that revered, highest God alone.

MUKHYATA YÀ. Although it has been said : “ And in dharma, and in artha, and in käma, and in moksa, ” 1 2 nonetheless the four “ ands ” amount to this, that although the essence of dharma% artha and käma ( as described in the Mahähhärata ) can be found elsewhere ( i. e. in .works other than Mahäbhärata), nonetheless, the fact that they ultimately come to a pathetic end is to be found here only. But the paramount importance ( säratä ) of the nature of moksa ( mokse yad rîtpam tasya ) can be seen only here (in the Mahàbhàrata). YATHÀ YATHÀ. ( Tantryamäna means) that which people tend towards, i. e. what is sought by them ( sampàdyamàrta) with effort. This refers to dharma, artha, and käma, and the means leading to them, though people consider them to be real ( and essential ). YATHÀ YATHÀ means ( the goals and their means ) characterised by the working for their acquisition and for their protection ( once they are obtained ) and ( finally ) by (their) destruction. Asäravat means like an insubstantial magic show. Viparyeti means :3 on the contrary they turn out the opposite ( of what we had hoped for ), so there is no question of their being regarded as real and abiding.

Objection : “ In the Mahàbhàraîa, irngàra, vira, etc., are charming as well. ” Anticipating this doubt he says: PÀRAMÀRTH1KA. Although these other rasas are subsidiary ( angabhuta ), yet people who are exclusively interested in pleasures and who are overcome by worldly desires think of them as predominant, just as (foolish people) think of this body as the cognising Self, although it is merely an instrument (ayatana) for the enjoyment(of pleasures)by the conscious Self. KEVALESU. There is no harm ( in fixing one’s thoughts on virtues ) helfpul to one’s devotion to the highest God. The construction is this : don’t have your minds attached to worldly goods, and exclusively interested (even) in worldly virtues. AGRE. In the text of the Mahabharata, right after the Anukramanu Objection : “ Surely Vasudeva is used in the sense of the son of Vasudeva, and not in the sense of the highest Lord, the Atman, the supereme God.” Anticipating this doubt he says: VÀSUDEVÀDISAMJNÀBHIDHE* YATVENA.“ At the end of many births, the wise man reaches me, (thinking that ) Vasudeva is everything.” 3(In) this and other ( passages like it ) the final meaning (tâtparya) (o f the word Vasudeva ) has been established tobe the whole (truth, the highest Brahman ), which is the content ( abhidheya ) of that designation ( i. e. Vasudeva ).NIRNITAS CA. In discussing ( the Sutra of Panini ) : \" rsyandhaka- vrsnikurubhyas ca ” , it has been said that words ( i. e. names of individuals ) are really eternal, but are assigned conventional meanings ( in the form of particular individuals ) only by accident.4 SÀSTRANAYE.

This is what is meant. This has been dealt with in detail by Änandavardhana in his book the Tattvaloka? Since it is not the main subject here, we have not gone into the problem.He now explains the reason for saying “ far greater beauty. ” PRASIDDHIS CA. The word ca is used in the sense of t€ since As this matter is well-known in the world since beginningless time, therefore, in not •saying directly ( that moksa and rasa are the subjects of supreme importance in the Mahàbhàrata ) the intention of the revered Vyàsa and others must have been just that ( i. e. they did not use direct words because this is not the practice in assemblies of the wise ). For1 2 3 otherwise in regard to the rela­tions of actions and the senses conveyed by the various case-endings, etc., while explaining the meanings of the words in a stanza like \" Paying my homage to Nàràyana etc. ” ( the first verse of the Mahàbhàrata ), what evidence is there to show that Vyàsa had the same intention ( as the one which is in conformity with lokaprasiddhi)! This is what he means. The words “ cultured and learned ” correspond to the method of poetry ( kavyanaya ) and the method of philosophy ( sàstranaya ) respectively.1. Understand sa ti after â a vâ d a yog â b h â ve.2. There are two references to the T a ttv a lo k a of A nandavardhana in tbo L oc a n a : this one, and another on p. 67 in the first U d d y o t a. Unfortunately this work is lost to us. It would have been unique, for nowhere has the relationship between fa s tr a and k â vya been discussed in Indian philosophy. Obviously Ânanda ( like Abhinava ) with his interest in both fields would have been an ideal person to write about this question. One wonders whether his idea of the M a h à b h à r a ta as both a êâ slra and a k â vy a did not inspire the book and if this was not one of the most important works discussed. Note that here, as elsewhere, Ananda is interested in things that seem to have passed unnoticed before among his fellow Indians. If Abhinava really did comment on the Y og a vä a isth a t and if Ananda is really quoted therein ( see above, p. 29 ), then it is possible that the Y og a v â sisth a was inspired by Ânanda’s lost T a ttv a lo k a.3. This line a n y a th à hi k r iy rïk â ra k a sa m b a n d h â d a u, etc., involves a rather : complex point. Here is the what Abhinava means :Vyàsa has made use of countless sentences in the A/. B h . in describing the main events in the story, the various episodes and incidents introduced from time to time, and in discourses on various worldly and philosophical topics. He has also commenced the M . B h . with the verse n â rû ya n a m n a m a s k r ty a, etc., which is a sentence. Now a sentence is nothing but a combination of an action ( kriyâ ) with various efficient causal factors or relations ( kärakax ) ( such as k a rf r, karm a, k a r a n a t etc. ). A sentence is the relation between an action and its various contri­butory factors (k riy â k â r a k a a a m b a n d h â d a u vâkye ); and this action and its various causal factors are displayed in a sentence according to well-known and generally accepted( C o n tin u e d on next page"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"Abhinavabhàratìq gqqq Wi ffq qsf%, cT'T^f w w w n M q r f i qq ^ fà fif : -^TPtT: ?TWfRT*ïï^^: cR^qtfïïflT^rfèft: fsfarrtçqTOÊr I ïï^T # lè lT - I öTfipErrO' ïîqqfqsnïfàftfq n^ q qf% , qqqpqqi: qqfqqrq;, # w ï ï-qïïnqj fà q iqqTqr qçgqRqïfq: q^qqqrcqnqTq ^q^qqqqrqqT ^ p w I qqtoqqqifq^g q strict qqqqqtqq: i qrqinqqr 3iqqr(fqq ^tct %q; q^fèqqvqtiftsfq qft qqt^qqfq qqisqqqr^qi fqqiqqi qn qj qnqT^qiqtsiq qigmq:, w q n tq y R ^ % :, w ^ r g ; , qqimqqqriqqra ; q if ^ F gq ^ i: qqVrcfrq: i gnw qqisfq f| ft:*r#=3rqqqq^qqT- ffft: ^5i(ìqqiqqi5q% i ^ w fK qiq qiHiqqqiqqq: q;q qqq; i q qTfàfqqtfqmqq ^ q n im ^ =pnq% fq^rqr: i qq q^:^;f% qqqqt ^q% ^T^iqqfnqpqt m v , aifq g m k i qq qn^rt ^fq iarâMq— qqr f f qiqq. qqifèfèqqq, p m w s ft pqm : 5n%q tftftiqfrqif^q q qrqròqìqiqqT spnqq ?Tq g w f q i q«n q qqqifäiC o n tin u e d f r o m p r e v io u s p a g e )rules aod conventions of syntax, which are as old as time ( i. e. practically beginning* less ). And Vyâsa aod other sages (like Vâlmïkî ) have strictly adhered to these well- known and generally accepted rules of sentence-structure ( or syntax ). In explaining the various syntactical relations in the sentences in the M. B h . and other works and in explaining the meaning of the stanza n â r â y a n a m n a m a s k r t y a, etc., we take it for granted that in constructing these sentences, Vyâsa has strictly followed the generally accepted principles, and we proceed on ^this assumption at the time of reading the sentences in the M . B h . and understanding their sense; and we have the satisfaction of having understood exactly what Vyâsa intended to convey« Thus, if we take it for granted that Vyâsa and others have followed the well-known and generally accepted ( lo k a p r a sid d h a ) laws of sentence-structure ( as laid down by grammarians ), we must also take it for granted that Vyâsa has also followed the well-known principle, generally accepted in circles of refined critics and scholars ( v id a g d h a v i d w t p a r i ç a t ê u ), namely that a matter close to the heart ( i. e. a matter of primary importance ) should be conveyed by suggestion and not by direct expression (and that comparatively unimportant matters should be expressed directly).

In this connection some say that sama is the sthayibhàva of sànta and that it arises from vibhàvas such as ascetic practices, association with Yogins, etc. It can be represented on the stage by anubhàvas such as the absence of lust, anger, etc. Its vyabhicàribtiàvas will be firmness, wisdom, etc. Others however do not accept this, because, they say, sama and sànta are synonyms. Nor do they wish to relinquish the figure of 49 bhàvas3 ( that was given by Bharata ). Moreover, they say that it is proper for the vibhàvas such as the seasons, flowers, etc., to be connected with love, etc., which arise immediately after these ( vibhàvas are apprehended ). But ascetic practices, Vedic recitation, etc., do not immediately give rise to sànta. Should1. The text used here is that given by Dr. V. Baghavan in the revised edition of H The N u m b e r o f R a sas ”, published in 1967, p. 104 ff. All textual corrections will be found in the notes.2. The three largest discussions in the Abh in a va bh âra lï are all in the sixthchapter of the N è , (All of the seventh chapter of the A bhinavabhârati but the very beginning has been lost, which is a great misfortune, since Abhinava refers to it frs* quently. It must have been a large and important section of the A . lih. ). One deals with êrn gâ ra, the other ( ed. and tr. by Gnoli ) is on the arisal of ra sa, and this is the third, But Abhinava was to some extent aware that there was something artificial about the êàntarasa section, for he says : y e p u n a r nava rasa iti p a th a n ti, thereby clearly suggesting that this was a pà than ta r a , and not an established part of the text. ( Note that on page 83 of the L o e a n a, Abhinava quotes the text of the N è that reads : ity astau näpye rasäh sm rlä h , which shows that he must have regarded this as a more authoritative text ). He uses this same type of expression when discussing the god of hänta ( buddha ! ) and the colour ( svaccha). ( See also A . B h , p. 267 :cR\" STW Itili 1 cf ^ ^ I cPT Tàf^T I This on N è , VI 15, which gives the list aafollows :WT: ^cTT: IIIt is odd that it never occurred to Abhinava to say that the figure 8 only applied to the drama, and that Bharata might have sanctioned the ninth rasa for poetry. But of course Abhinava did not want to compromise even this much. ) Now does Abhinava mean that he too “ read” nava rasàh ? He must, for otherwise we cannot understand the sentence : tanm ate stintasvarûpam a bhidh iyate. But it is clear that he was uot the first to do so. ( Cf. N è . on I. l,the A . B h .} p. 5, where Bhattanäyaka’s view is quoted from the H rd a ya d a rp a n a : ^ Mi s 4 ^1 I )It is, however, doubtful that he had in front of him the text of the N H on säntarasa as we have it.3. The forty-nine bhävas are : eight ethâyibhâvasi eight sâltvikubhàvas and thirty-three vyabhicdribhàvas. This means that the exact number of vibhàvas ( which are really innumerable ), and of anubhàvas, is not given. Of course Bharata does mention, for each rasa, its anubhàvas as well as its vibhàvas, though he does n$t separately enumerate^them in a K à rik â ."},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"a b h in a v a’s p h il o s o p h y of a e st h e t ic s121one argue1 that ascetic practices, Vedic recitation, etc., are the immediate causes of the knowledge of the truth, then, since the knowledge of the truth which precedes (iònia) is their ( immediate ) effect, they cease to be the vibhàvas of kânta. Even the absence of lust, etc., cannot be the anubhàvat because it is not conclusive evidence ( of shnta\\ inasmuch as it is found to be present in rasas other than sànîa as well1 2, and because it cannot be combined with a stage-representation (prayoga ). After all, it is not possible to display a cessation of activity. For example, even the anubhàvas sleep, swoon, etc., can be shown by actions like breathing in and out, falling down, lying on the ground, etc. ( As for vyabhicàrabhâvas ), how can firmness of mind, etc., which is accompanied by a desire for the attainment of objects,3 be appropriate to Santa ? Those to be instructed cannot be taught how to attain the knowledge of the truth by means of a state of complete inacti­vity.4 * * Those people whose minds are pained by the sufferings of other people have not ( yet ) reached a state of tranquillity characterised by correct perception ( of the highest truth ), but rather they are ( still ) caught in the turmoil of worldly life.8 Therefore sàntarasa does not exist. The reply is1. Jr»&Ad?»a can be equated with kdranay the immediate cause that arouse the sth dyibh dva of a rasa. The argument here then is that Vedic recitation, etc., do not immediately precede the slh à yibh à va ( èrnia ) of êànla. The Pûrvapak$in’a point is that if Vedic recitation, etc., are the immediate causes of ta ltva jû à n a y then they cannot also bo the vibhàvas of êà n la, for they would be at one remove.2. This line, ê'intâd vipa kfàd a n yà vr tle h, is difficult. If we take vipakça to mean “ opposite ” which is its usual meaning, the passage will make no sense, for then it will be saying that even in the emotion which is the opposite of êànla ( i. e. '* love ” ) there will be kà m d d ya b h d va i i. e., there will be no <e love ” in “ love ” I We will have to interpret vipahpi to mean “ anything different from ê à n l a ,” i. e., any other rasa besides êànla. In other words, there is no kdm af etc., in such rasas as vaudra and bhaydnaka,3. P r à p ta v ifa y o p a r d g a . Pandit Srinivasa Shastri of the Deccan College, who waskind enough to read over some of the more difficult passages with us, says that u pardgah here means sam bandhuh, so that tbo phrase will mean : STHTt ^IcT !According to him, since êànta is a state of no mental activity at all, how can there be any contact with vi*a ya s therein ? But another interpretation is possible : d h rti is detined in the 7th ch. of the X & . ( Vol. I, p. 363, VII, 56 ) as arising from, among other things, m anorathaldbha. These are its vibhàvas ( note that for Bharuta the vya b h icd• ribh àvas can become sth àyib h âvas and have their own vibh dvasy etc., as Abbinava will point out later in this pagSAgo ). Its anubhàvas are : dIHIhRTHMl f ^ 1îTaïï5xf'e iïl-lïcl^ etc. Therefore we think it is possible to take upardgah simply in the sense o* upabhogah, “ pleasure, ” and interpret as : accompanied by a desire for the attain­ment of sense-objects4. We interpret a k iilcitk a ra tva m à lra here as the complete absence of anyaction, which is supposed to result from the state of tattvajfldna,5.

Just as the states of mind that are proper to love, etc. and expressed by such words as sexual love ( rati) etc., by being made capable of being relished through the activity of the poet and the actor, are brought to the status of rasas such as srngära, etc., in relation to the spectators who are possessed of the proper sympa­thetic response; in the same way, we ask you to tell us why the state of mind which is appropriate to the highest goal of man known as moksa cannot beC o n tin u e d f r o m p r e v i o u s p a g e )—uote bow this phrase s a m t/a y d a r sa n a is often used in Buddhism io manyjj variations sa m y g h o d h i) etc. ), such identifications are not possible.

The Pûrvapak$in objects’ that this kind of sympathy is found in worldly life and not in transcendental mystic states.1. We take a lr o c y a t e as Abhinava’s own position. He is of course quite right in pointing out that m o fk a was already a well-known p u r n s ä r th a long before the N i i , But that m oksa should be prevalent in the s m r tis and ilîÀûsa does not, ipso f a c t o, establish any connection of it with literature. We must remember that for people like Abhinavagupta, tho s m r tis and itih à sa s were not litorature in the strict sense of the word. Nobody, of course, would have argued that êânta in the sense of m o k fa p u r u sâ r th a does not occur in suoh works. The point was whether it could occur in the far more refined N â ta k a s and K â v y a s. It simply never occurred to these older writers that one can apply the term literature to many of these works, as well as to a large number of purely religious works, e. g. the M a h û p a r in ib b â n a s u U a in Pâli, and several of the Sanskrit A îa h â y à n a S ü tr a s , e. g., the V a jr a c c h e d ik ä, or the V im a la k ir tin ir d e sa ( not available in Sanskrit, but recently so beautifully translated into French by Professor Et. Lamette ). Even the O it d t in spite of the fact that Ânaudavardhana ( p. 293 ) quotes the verse y d ni6:i s a r v a b h û tà n â m ) etc., as an example of d h v a n i, was not really considered “ lite ra tu re in the strict, and restricted, sense of the term that the Indians used it. This restriction was a great loss to the theory, to r d h va n i would have boon more faithfully served, in illustrations, by passuge9 from many of these religious or secular texts ( e. g. the B r h a lk û th â ê lo k a sa n g ra h a ) than by the N d ta k a s and the K â v y a s, many of which were artificially composed to conform to a given ra sa and its definition by Bharata. One has only to think of some of the literary passages in the U p a n isa d s ( e. g. Satyakâma Jâbala, or Raikva with the Cart ) to realise bow much the Indians lost by such a restriction. If later writers like Jagau. ,n&thu Panditaräja widened the definition of K à v y a ( r a m a v i y â r th a p r a tip â d a k a h êabdah k â v y a m ) it still does not mean that they went for their examples to this non-literary literature. Visvanätha comas closest when he says : v â k y a m ra sâ tm a k a m k a v y a m t but even he never uses the vast litorature thut true obedience to such a phrase would make available. It was only the Bengal school of VaiÿUavism that opened itBelf to the influence of religious literature, but its purpose was more religious than it was aesthetic, and was confined, for the most part, to such works as the B h ü y a v a ta p u r â n a, ( One thinks of some of the fino examples that Madhusüdana Sarasvati, a strict 'Advaitin, chose from the B h â y a v a la p u r â n a in his B h a g a v a d b h a k tir a s d y a n a m )."},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"123raised to the status of a rasai1 That state of mind just described is indeed the st/uiyibhava of santa. But one must consider what its name is. Some say that it is complete detachment (nirveda—world-weariness )1 2 that is born from a knowledge of truth. For this detachment is quite different from the detachment that arises from poverty, etc., because its cause, viz. knowledge of the truth, is different. It was for this very reason ( i. e. because nirveda is the sthàyibhàva of santa ) that it has been mentioned ( by Bharata) midway between the sthayibhàvas and the sancàribhàvas ( i. e. vyabhicàribhàvas ).3 * * * * * * * *1. There seems to us do doubt in reading through the objectious made against éà ntaraaa that the objectors had a real point.

It is not like the other rattaat which simply enrich us, provide great scope for our imagi­nation, refine our sensibilities, in short do all the thiugs that great literary experi­ences are supposod to do. It is not that it demands a suspension of judgment us do the other rasas, a momentary identification with different emotions. It means a complete reversal of our personality, what the Buddhists call pa rete riti ( see the con­troversial article on this word hv A. Coomaruswamy, *( Transformation, Regeneration, Anagogy M, in F e s t s c h r i f t E r n s t \\ Y in te r n itz > 1933 ). We believe that it was this difference, this sense of the “ complotoly other ” in i j j i that bothered so many literary critics iu ancient lndiu. While one sympathises with their hesitation, one can also understand the point of view of people like Abbinava, for whom those religious ex­periences were an integral part of their everyday life and especially of their literary life. Witness the groat number of hymns attributed to people like Sankara, and the surviving ones of Abhiuava and A umida. The coullict, the real conflict, which we see as one between the secular-minded literary critic and the religious-minded literary critic, never really came out into the opeu, except iu this one argument overfor it was assumed, by all, that nearly everybody was religions. From our perspec­tive, however, it is clear that some critics Mere more religious than others.2. X i r t e d a can mean two things ; it can have an ordinary, everyday sense of “ disgust ” , and it can have the more subtle und religious sense of total detach­ment ” from the world. Abbinava is here implicilty referring to this distinction.3. This is a very curious, and we believe, u very weak argument : Bharata hasbegun his list of the v y a b h ic à r ib h à v a s ( VII. 28, p. 35b ) with n ir v e d a at the top ( ta tr an ir v e d o n à m a d â r i d r y a v y â d h i, etc. ). Now, it is said by “ some people ” as reported by Abhiuava, that Bharata had great respect for the idea of the marinala, that is, begin­ning a new topic with an auspicious word. N i r v e d a is not an auspicious word,therefore, Bharata ( since he cannot be presumed to be iu error ), must have hud somespecial intention in mind. According to these “ some people11 it is to show thatn ir v e d a is actaally a s th y d y ib h d v a und also a t y a b b i c a r ib h d v a.

When Bharata forbade the use of disgust ( jugupsà ) as a vyabhicàribhàva of srhgàra, he sanctioned ( by implication )l the interchangability of the characters of the sthàyibhàvas, the sahcàribhàvas, the sàttvikabhàvas, and the anubhàvas, in the case of all the 49 bhàvas as demanded by the requirements of a parti­cular situation and as presented by the power of words and their senses. Nirveda arises from knowledge of the truth and overwhelms the other sthàyins. For only that ( emotion ) which is more highly stable than any of the other sthàyins such as love etc. which can tolerate co-existence with a variety of emotions,1 2 that alone (namely nirveda), they say, can overwhelm other sthàyins.They also raise the following objection : if nirveda which arises from knowledge of the truth, is said to be the sthàyibhàva of sànta, [ this amounts to saying that knowledge of the truth is the vibhàva ( i. c. cause) of nirveda ], in which case how could vairàgya ( detachment ) and similar other things3 ( e. g. samàdhiì which have been mentioned as vibhàvas of nirveda ) be the vibhàva of nirveda ? If one were to claim that detachment, etc., become the vibhàva of nirveda because they are the means of attaining to the knowledge of the truth, then it would mean that you are giving the name vibhàva to that which is the cause of another cause,4 and that would involve you in a great absurdity ( since vibhàva means the direct cause of a sthàyibhàva and not the distant or remote cause ). Moreover nirveda is an attitude of reject­ing everything( i. e. an attitude of not being attached to anything), and it1. The point is that normally jugu psà is the sthàyibhàva of bibhatsa. It is not given in the list of the thirty-three vyabhicàribhàoax, but the very fact that Bharata says that it should not be used in love shows that he felt that it could be a vyabhicàri* bhdva as well as a sthyàyibhàva. He therefore, felt that under certain circumstances, \"ordinary vyabhicàribhàvas could become sthàyibhàvas, And sthàyibhàvas could be* come vyabbicaribhàvas. This Ì9 an important point. Abhinava bus expressed a similar view in the Locana on tho third U ddyota of the D h vanyàloka, while commenting on bahünüm saniavetändm, on p. 38b of the B. P. ed.2.

'‘ So what ? ” \" Well, vairàgya and nirveda are the same thing1 ( and therefore, nirveda is the sthàyin and tattvajfiàna is a vibhàva ) Who says so ? For nirveda is a certain state of mind which is characterised by a flow of sadness, where­as vairàgya is the complete destruction of ràga, etc. ( including soka, i. e. vairàgya is a higher form of detachment than is nirveda, for the latter is often used non-technically to mean simply \"weariness” or \"disgust” ). Even granting that vairàgya and nirveda are indentical, still Gautama placed it in the midst of several ( other causes of moksa ) and did not mention it as the immediate cause of moksa ( for it is only the remote cause ), ( and so it does not follow that according to Aksapäda nirveda, that is, vairàgya, is the sthàyibhàva of sànta). Moreover2 to say that nirveda arising from tattva-Continued from previous page )» fttra of Aksapäda is that m ithyàjüànàpacaya leads to tattvajfiàna and tatlvajflâna leads to vairàgya. The opponent thinks that vairàgya is the same thing as nirveda. Hence according to Akçapâda rhe causal chain Ì9 : m ithyâjüânàpacaya gives rise to tattvd- jilàna which gives rise to nirveda. So, this means that according to Akçapâda, nirveda leads to moksa and hence, nirveda (and not tatlvaj nana) must be regarded as the sthàyi- bhâva of ê'inta. Now, the opponent challenges the position that vairàgya and nirveda are identical, and then proceeds to point out the difference between nirveda and vairàgya. He says that nirveda is a particular attitude of mind which Ì9 of the nature of unbroken sadness { hikaprarähaprasara ), while vairàgya Ì9 the destruction of räga> dvesa, m ohat etc. The opponent of keeinmata ( this refers to the view mentioned on p. 105 of Ragliavano text, that nirveda born of tattvajfiàna is the sthàyibhàva of sànta, see foot-note 2, p. 123, above ) first challenges the position that vairàgya and nirveda are identical. But then he concedes it for the sake of argument in the sentence bhavatu và vairägyam eva nirvedah. Even granting that nirveda and vairagya are identical, it does not follow that according to Akçapâda nirveda ( i. e. vairagya ) is the sthàyi­bhàva of kàvta. For although nirveda has a place in the causul sequence given above [ the whole chain is : m ithyàjilànàpaeaya ) ( i. e. tattvajfiàna {leads to dosàpàya ( i. e- nirveda or vairàgya ), which leads to pravH tyapâya, which leads to janm àpàya, which leads to duhkhàpàyaì which leads to moksa ], still it is not actually stated in the Sutra to be the direct cause leading to moksat but rather it is given as a remote cause ( mokse eàdhye sûtrasthàniyatâ na pratyapàdi dear y eva ). Thus According to the opponent of keeinm ata, the authority of Akçapâda cannot be cited in support of the view that nirveda is the ithàyibhàva of frànta.

Here is a Sahgrahakàrìkà on this matter :“ Santa rasa is to be known as that which arises from a desire to secure the liberation of the Self, which leads to a knowledge of the Truth, and is connected with the property of highest happiness 31.

We can also translate the sentence 3 etc., asfollows : “ Since sàn ta is impossible, what else can be excluded but êrn gü ra and h à sya ì by the phrase ‘ viz. the D im a has as its source ( i. e. is based on ) an exciting theme ’ ?

Objection : “ This quarter stanza ( diptarasa- kàvyayonih ) excludes koruna, bibhatsa and bhayânaka as predominant rasas. ” This is not true, because when (he says) that the ( Dima) is associated with the styles called Sàttvatì and Àrabhatì* they are automatically excluded ( since they belong to the style Kaikiki ). But kanta uses only the Sàttvatì style, and therefore this ( qualification ) alone would not be enough to exclude it. And therefore the definition of the Dima, far from arguing against the existence of kànta, is evidence for its existence. Srngâra however would be possible ( in a Dima ) because ( demons ) make love in a violent manner.3 Hàsya is helpful to srngâra and therefore only their exclusion was specifically mentioned, because both are possible ( and only a possible thing can be excluded, but not an impossible thing such as kànta).Because (kànta) is common to all (rasas), it would be improper to name especially a colour4 or god5 ( that is appropriate to it, as one has * 1 2 3 4 5C on tin u ed f r o m p r e v i o u s p a g e )Abhinava’a point is this : all the six ra sa * are d i p t a r a s a s , except for tónta. This word, therefore, excludes tónta, for otherwise there would be no point in saying d ip ia r a s a, ßince that is just what the other six are ( though this is in fact wrong, since there is no reason to believe that Bharata uses each adjective to exclude something ). Surely this «4 tautologous in the sense that it is an explanation of m adrasa. Bharata is not so subtle as Abhinava wants him to be.1.

And so the reasonableness1 of sànta has been shown. Its true nature is hàsya. ( ? ! ) * 2 Vira and bibhatsa tend to lead towards it.3 Therefore there is in the case of sànta the advice about the practice of yama, niyama, meditation on God, etc. It stands to reason that it leads to a great result ( i. e. moksa ), as it eschews enjoyment ( of worldly objects) ( anupabhogitayà ),4- that it is more important than any other (rasa), and that it pervades the entire plot (? ). And so enough of further elaboration.What is the nature of its true relish ? It is the following : The nature of the soul is tinged by utsàha, rati, etc., which are capable of imparting their ( peculiar ) tinges to it. It is like a very white thread that shines through the interstices of sparsely threaded jewels. It assumes the forms of all the various feelings like love, etc., ( which are superimposed on it ), because all these feelings are capable of imparting their tinges to it. Even then ( tathà- bhàvenàpi ) it shines out ( through them ), according to the maxim that once this Atman shines, ( it shines for ever).5 It is devoid of the entire collection of miseries which consist in ( i. e. which result from ) turning away ( from the Atman ). It is identical with the consciousness of the realisation of the highest bliss. It takes its effect through the process of generalisation6 in poetry and drama. It makes such a heart ( i. e. the heart of the sensitive spectator or reader ) the receptacle of an other-worldly bliss7 by inducing a peculiar kind of introspection ( antarmukhàvasthàbheda ).There are only these nine rasas, because only they deserve to be taught, as they are useful to the ( four ) goals of life or are exceptionally pleasant.♦ •» 1.

This will be explained in the chapter on the bhàvas. It is wrong to say that affection, with a sthàyibhàva of being moved ( àrdratà ) can be a rasa, because affection is ( nothing other than ) attachment, and all attachment culminates in rati, utsàha ( or some other such accepted sthàyibhàva ). For instance, the love of a child for its mother and father terminates in ( i. e. can be included under ) “ fear ”.2 The affection of a young man for his friends terminates in rati. The affection, as of Laksmana, etc., for his brother terminates in ( i. e. can be included under ) dharmàvîra. The same is true ( of the affection ) of an old man for his son, etc.3 The so-called rasa “ cupidity” with the sthàyibhàva of \"greed’* can be refuted in the same manner, because it will terminate in some other ( sthàyibhàva ) such as hàsa or rati.

The P u rva p a k x in is objecting to Dhanaiijaya’s definition of the dhira- éâ n ta n â ya k a ( II, 4 ). He says that this definition is not realistic, but only technical. For it says that the d h ir a ê â n la n â y a k a is endowed with the general qualities of a n ä ya ka . These include such qualities as v in ila tv a , m a d h u r a tv a, d a k ça tva , etc. Now these qualities are uot all possible in the case of a d h ira kâ n ta hero, because they are inconsistent with the state of being without desires which follows from his being a d h ira k â n ta hero. It is only technical or formal since it is a consequence of his being a hero ( in general ). Since the possession of the general qualities is thus unreal io the case of a d h ira kân ta hero, it cannot be said to distinguish him from the other types qf heroes ( abhedakam ). This means that according to the P ilrv a p a k sin } the definition of the d h ira kâ n ta hero as given by Dhananjaya is unscientific. One cannot help agreeing, for surely the dillerentiatiou that Dhananjaya makes ( namely that he is a d v ija and ha9 the general characteristics of a hero ) is hardly consistent with ódnta io any form. It is, therefore, most surprising that Dhanika, although he takes up and answers all the other objections, does not deal with this one ! It is almost as if he were admitting its justice. Could this possibly mean that he is himself criticising his brother under the guise of a P u r va p a k x in ?2. ò'a/mwÉafà, V, 7."},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"ABHINAVA 8 PHILOSOPHY OF AESTHETICS149*a sàrtia ( i. e. a dhlrasinta ) hero.

Some say there is no santarasa because Bharata did not mention its vibhàvas, etc., and because he did not define it. Others, however argue that ( regardless of whether Bharata mentioned it or not ) in actual reality it cannot exist, because, ( they claim ), it is impossible to root out love and hate which have been continously cultivated (inside man) from time immemorial. Others claim that it can be included within vira, blbhatsa, etc. Those who speak this way do not accept even kama ( as a sthàvibhàva ). Accept whichever opinion you like ( yatìià tathàstu) ), in all events, however, we cannot allow kama to be a sthìyibhàva in a Nàtakay etc., where acting is essential, because, after all, sama consists in the complete cessation of all activity and therefore cannot be acted out. As for what some have claimed, namely that in the Nàgànanday etc,, soma is a sthàyibhàva, this is contrary to the portrayal of Jïmfitavàhana’s love for Malayavati, which persists right through thé entire play and is also opposed to his ( finally ) obtaining the universal sovereignity of the Vidyàdharas.1 2 For we never come acoss both love for1.

He does absolutely nothing to achieve this.

This stanza is the utterance of the author ( Ananda), who began by first being a devotee of God, and then, simply out of curiosity, adopted both the view­points of the poet and the philosopher ( but found them ultimately unsatisfy­ing ) and once again came to believe that rest in devotion to God was in­evitable (yuktà).*For we have already explained1 2 that the happiness which results from ( conceptual understanding ) of both seen and unseen objects which are ascertained ( parinkeita ), by all the means of valid cognition ( i. e. philosophy ) or even that transcendent joy which consists in relishing an aesthetic experience-to both of these the bliss that comes from finding rest in God is far superior (pmkrsynte- ); and that aesthetic pleasure ( imamnla ) is only the reflection ( mwbhcttfi ) of a drop ( vijnus ) of that mystic bliss.Bui ordinary worldly happiness is for the most part (prâya) inferior to even that aesthetic delight, because it is mixed with abundant ( bahutara ) suffering as well. This is the essence of what he means. **This then, is Abhinava’s final position. To have provided a coherent philosophy of aesthetic experience is no small achievement. Clearly it was owing to Abhinava’s influence that so many later writers ( primarily among the àlankàrikasy and only very rarely among pure philosophers, for reasons that still puzzle us) were able to draw upon this precious analogy of religious experience and aesthetic experience, and to make their own contributions.

But here Abbinava says that Ananda w a s ß r a t a devotee, then went through a middle period of interest in poetry and philosophy, aod finally came back to religion. This is too unusual to be simply invented, and we think that the likelihood of Abhinava reporting an actual detail of Ananda’s life is strong. Otherwise tho expression p r a th a m a m would be out of place, since there is nothing in the verse itself to warrant this assumption.

One is found in the Vyaktiviveka of Mahimabhatta.1 Mahima is objecting to the use of the word visesa by Änandavardhana in the expres­sion kàvyavisesa in Kàrlkà 13 of the first Uddyota : “ It is also not possible to speak of excellence ( vise sa i. e. atisaya) in the case of poetry, for kàvya ( i. e. rasa ) consists in the relish of the highest happiness ”.1 2 Mahima means that one cannot use the expression kàvyaviiesa, since all poetry is rasàtmaka and is therefore in and by itself nirati say asukhàsvàdalak sana. ( He is thus not referring to the division of poetry into uttama, madhyama, etc.). In support of his contention he quotes the following very interesting verse : 3 4 544 When, from the recitation* and singing of the Dhruvà songs, rasa reaches its peak ( i. e. the spectator is filled with rasa ), he turns his attention inwards ( antarmukha ) for the moment, concentrated entirely on enjoying that profusion ( bhara ) ( of rasa ) and becomes delighted. At that moment ( tatah ) when ( he ) is immersed in his own true nature ( svampa ) and he is unaware of any outside object ( nirvisaya ), his own deep flow ( nisyanda ) of joy becomes manifest, by which even Yogins are pleased ”.6tMadhusûdanasarasvati in his Sribhagavadbhaktirasàyanam, I. 12, differentiates between rasâsvàda and brahmàsvâda. He says that whereas brahman is sat (existence) and ajrnta (unknown by ordinary people), worldly objects like a beautiful woman, etc., are knowable (meya) by means of valid knowledge. But a beautiful woman, etc., as presented in literary works appears to the sahrdaya in the form of pure consciousness ( caiianya ) as limited by the beautiful woman, etc., when the covering mantle disappears (màyàvrtitirodhàne, paraphrased in the commentary as vyàvarana-1.

This is equally true of any higher ecstatic experience.(2) During an actual dramatic performance, we forget the self.(3) We have no hope of material gain from art. The same is true on the religious level, since to become seriously religious in India generally means abandoning one's acquired wealth.(4) Both experiences are alaukika. We have seen how often Abhinava uses this term.(5) Both experiences are ànandaìkaghana.(6) In both cases, the distance between the subject and the object is removed. Thus Abhinava stressed that rasa is not objective.(7) Time and space disappear for the duration of the experience. We are not conscious of our surroundings during a drama, or at least we ought not to be, according to Abhinava.(8) During both experiences there is total immersion. In the case of samàdhi there is vyutthâna, which could correspond ( perhaps forcibly, however ) to leaving the theatre and re-entering ordinary life. We have all certainly experienced the curious feeling of being let-down, even of depression, upon leaving a theatre.(9) In both cases, special preparation is necessary : music and dance in the theatre, and perhaps one might include bhajans and other parapher­nalia of bhakti in the case of religion.(10) In both cases, what appears is not something that is \" created” anew, but something that is i4 manifested ” , or “ suggested ” . Rasa is not \" produced ” , it is “ suggested So also, the identity of the àtman and1. Soo also the Rrahmaaiddhi of Mandanamiéra, Ch. 1, p. 6, Kuppusw&miShastri’s edition : ^ l2.

( p. 53 ) also deals with the distinction betweenrasâsvâda and brahmâavâda and then ends by saying :S'äradätanaya, as is clear from Ch. I, p. 26-27, and Ch. II, p. 47, does not accept éâ n ta . However, at II, p. 48, a certain Vâsuki is quoted who does accept é â n la. On this problem, see Uagbavan, The Nvmber o f Raaaa” p. II."},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"162brahman is only a question of removing ignorance ( i. e. nothing \" new ” is to be acquired). In Vedànta the term abhivyakti is often used for this process, just as both Ànanda and Abbinava use the same expression for rasa.(11) In Vedànta, avidyà is removed by means of sravana, manana etc. In rasanispatti, Abhinava emphasises how the vighnas must be removed before rasa can manifest itself.(12) In both cases there is a sense of rest ( vibranti), of having reached the goal (cf. the Vedàntic expression krtakrtya) beyond which there is nothing to be accomplished.(13) In the aesthetic experience, Ànanda(and Abhinava) make light of the 41 means ” that have brought it about, especially of the vàcya sense, which is compared to a lamp ( D. ÂL I. 9 ) which is useful for illuminating objects, but which is not the goal of our efforts. Similarly, in Vedanta, Sankara speaks of the upàyas as being similar to a raft which we leave behind after our destination has been reached.DIFFERENCESThe differences are no less striking, and certainly ought not to be lightly dismissed. Abhinava himself makes the distinction in a difficult passage in the Àbhinavabhàratï : 1“ Aesthetic experience ( carvam ) is different from the perception of love, etc., that arises because of ordinary valid means of cognition such as direct perception ( pratyaksa ), inference ( anumana ), textual authority ( àgama ), simile ( upamhna ) and others. It is also ( an experience ) different from the indifferent ( tatastha ) knowledge of another person’s thoughts that - arises from direct vision in a Yogin, and from the experience that consists of a single mass of the bliss (ànandaikaghana ) of one’s own Self that belongs to the •highest Yogin and which, being pure ( suddha), is devoid of contact ( uparàga) with any object of the senses. The reason why aesthetic experience differs from all the above, is because of the absence of beauty caused respectively by the appearance of distractions such as the desire to acquire ( arjanàdi ),: the absence of active participation, the absence of clarity ( asphutatva ), and being at the mercy of the object ( of contemplation ). ”I. A . I t h . 1 , 2 8 5 . G noli, p. 21 :ht ^ I"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"CONCLUSION163Other differences are :( 1 ) The final state in Vedànta is almost always described ( ! ) as ineffable,1 whereas Ânanda is clear that such an adjective can never be predi­cated of dhvani. Whether Abhinava agreed or not is not evident.( 2 ) The Adhikärin in the case of liberation is much more strictly defined that he is for literature. After all, children are perfectly capable of watching a drama, though they might not take away as much as a qualified adult. Sahrdayatm is a much more worldly and concrete qualification than is .mumuksà.( 3 ) The drama is not expected ( at least Abhinava never says any­thing about this ) to change one’s life radically. To have a profound aesthe­tic experience is simply satisfying and does not imply that one will be in any sense profoundly altered. One cannot say the same for mystic experiences. Quite apart from the concept of sadyomukti, any deep religious experience is very likely to make a manifest, sometimes drastic, change in a person’s out­ward life.(4 ) It is significant that most writers, (Abhinava is an exception), do not use the term ânanda to describe the purpose of poetry as often as they use the less ethereal term priti and even more often vinoday “ entertainment It •is perfectly legitimate to give curiosity as the reason for wishing to see any given drama. But to say the same of religious experience would be unthink, able, at least in ancient India.( 5 ) With the exception of Abhinava, (who has highly “ spiritual” 'ideas about love, see p. 14) most writers regard the highest expression of drama to be sexual love, without any philosophical implications.In spite of these differences, such sentiments in regard to aesthetic experience as Abhinava provided, became very common. For instance in the Alankàramahodadhi of Narendraprabha Suri we read :1. E. g. Gaudapâda, III, 47 : ^ 4 \" 9 ^ 5 ^ ^ 1 Ânanda-vardhana is quite clear that such an adjective can never be predicated of d h v a n i :Sahrdayahrdayasamvcdyam is not ambiguous and cannot be Ananda’s own position, for if it were, this would in no way prove that dhvani was ‘ £ epeakable” but only tbat it was “ knowable ” which is not the same thing at all. Moreover, this is confirmed by the passage in the D . /U., p. 33, where this adjective is given as part of the andkhyeyavâda, We feel that it is quite possible that Abhinava himself, however, did not really agree with this position. It is interesting that he does not oomment extensively on the andkhyeyaoada except to hint that it is a Buddhist position, with which Ânanda has dealt elsewhere ( Locana, p. 519 ). ^"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"16444 ( Aesthetic experience is that state ) wherein the mind sinks for a moment, where it bathes with ambrosia for a moment, where it gets drunk for a moment, where it melts away for a moment 1Even such a staunchly Vedànta work as the Pancadati of Vidyàranya seems to have been influenced by aesthetic speculations in four lovely verses :44 The lamp which is in the theatre lights up equally the manager, the audience and the dancer.

There are two areas in which we are inte­rested : säntarasa and rasäsväda. The Kävyaprakäsa is quite brief on sànta- rasa. At IV. 29 Mammata says :“ Srngära, häsya, karuna, raudra, vira, bhayànaka, blbhatsa and adbhuta—these are stated to be the eight rasas in drama. ”Later, at IV. 35 he says :t“ Santa is the ninth rasa, of which nirveda is the sthàyibhàva” and then he gives the stanza ahau và hàre va kusumasayane va drsadi vô as an example of kàntarasa.1 It would seem therefore that according to Mammata, säntarasa has no place in drama, but only in kàvya. But his statement is not un­ambiguous, and it is possible to interpret him to mean that generally only eight rasas are admitted, but that he would admit also sànta as a ninth.Visvanàtha, in the Sàhityadarpana, III. 45 ff., has the following remarks on SR :Sàhityadarpana III. 245-250 :3TC 5TFcl: -stftt: ii31 ft1 ISHRÏU 5 31 IIq w ïï^ r ^ 1? 31 Ig o q i « r a ç f t 3: il1.

Its alambana- vibhäva is the emptiness ( or vanity ) of all things because of their transient nature, or it is the nature of the supreme Self.

Santa, how­ever, cannot be included under dayàvira, etc., because its exclusive nature is the extinction of egoism in every way. Hence the view that in the Nàgànanda, sànta is the dominant sentiment, is refuted.It may be objected as follows :“ Where there is neither pain, nor pleasure, nor worry, nor hatred, nor affection, that is styled as iàntarasa by the chief among the sages, that which consists in equality towards all objects 1How can sàntarasa which is of the nature described above, and which manifests itself only in the state of emancipation ( moksa ), where there is the complete absence of the auxiliary feelings (and the abiding mental moods such as love, etc. ) be regarded as a rasa ?

It would not be proper to say that as the actor ( himself ) is devoid of sama9 he cannot be capable of acting in a manner congenial to sama. For in that case, it will have to be accepted that, since an actor is devoid of ( genuine) fear and (genuine) anger, etc., he would not be capable of acting in a manner congenial to fear, anger, etc. also. Now, if there is nothing objectionable in the actor’s being able to manifest, through special training, repeated practice, etc., the artificial effects of anger, etc., although there is no possibility in his case of the real effects of anger, etc., i.e. although he cannot actually kill or imprison ( the object of his anger ), then the same should apply in the case of sama as well. It may now be asked : “ How can there be the emergence ( udreka ) of sànta in the minds of spectators (of a drama), since there is in a drama vocal and instrumental music( etc., all of which are opposed (to the suggestion of the sthyàyìbhàva sama), and since sàrtia is by its nature averse to the contemplation of worldly objects (e.g. music, dance, etc. ) ? ” The reply is that those who admit the existence of sànta in drama, do not believe that the presence of vocal and instrumental music in a drama acts as a hindrance to the emergence of sànta, for the very reason that the result (namely the emergence of sänta) is actually experienced (phala- balàt ). If now it is maintained ( by the opponent ) that the contemplation of any worldly object is detrimental to the emergence of sànta, then ( even in the case of non-dramatic poetry ), the àlambanavibhàva of sama such as the transitory nature of worldly existence, and its uddipanavibhàvas such as listen­ing to the recitation of the Purànas, association with saintly people, visiting sacred penance-groves and holy places ( tlrtha ), being worldly objects ( after all ), will have to be regarded as detrimental to the emergence of sànta ( in the minds of the readers of non-dramatic poetry ). It is for this very reason that in the last chapter of the Sangìtaratnàkara, it has been said :“ Some have urged that in dramatic compositions ( nàtyesu) there are only eight rasas. But that is not ( at all ) correct ( acaru — unconvincing ), because no actor ever actually relishes any rasa whatsoever ” . 21. Jagannatha does not accept the fact that the actor has r a s a .

Even those who hold the view that sàntarasa has no place in dramatic poetry ( mtya ) will have necessarily to accept its existence in non-dramatic poetry ( kàvya ), ( firstly ) because there are no such objections ( to its acceptance in non- dramatic poetry) as given earlier, and (secondly) because it has been establish­ed on the strength of all people’s actual experience that works like she Mahà- bharata have sàntarasa as their dominant emotional mood. It is for this very reason that ( a great schoiar like ) Mammatabhatta first opened his discussion (on the number of rasas) with the words *' eight are the rasas in drama” 1 and concluded his treatment of the subject with the remark : “ sànta too has to be admitted as the ninth rasa ( in non-dramatic poetry ) 2Of these — love, sorrow, disaffection, anger, enthusiasm, wonder mirth, fear and disgust are the abiding mental moods respectively ” .3On the sthòyàbhàva of shnta( The sthàyibhàva of sànta, namely ) nirveda* ( “ world-weariness ” ) is a peculiar state-of-mind ( cittavrttivisesa ) which is also called by the name visayavtràga ( \" aversion to worldly objects of enjoyment ” ) arising from con­templation on the eternal Reality ( nityavastn) and the non-eternal phenomenal appearances in the world ( anityavastu ).

This cognition of a sthäyibhäva ( such as rati, etc.,) is the result of an extraordinary function ( of words and senses ) ( i. e. it is brought by the function called suggestion ). ( This suggestion ) is produced ( pràdurbhàvita ) by the appropriate alambana- ribhàvasy uddìpanavibhàvas, anubhàvas and vyabhicâribhàvas ( described in the poem or represented on the stage) acting jointly and simultaneously ( sambhuya ). The extraordinary function ( namely suggestion ) which is thus brought into play as a result of the vibhävas, etc., immediately removes the ignorance which acts as a screen (or veil) covering up ( or obscuring ) the blissful consciousness of the Self. And when the screen of ignorance is thus removed, the cogniser rises superior to and becomes divested of his peculiar properties such as being a limited cogniser ( etc. ).The vibhävas, anubhàvas and vyabhicâribhàvas are first presented by the poet or dramatist to the reader ( or spectator ) through the medium of the poem ( or drama ) which is charming because of the appropriate and beautiful literary style ( adopted for conveying the vibhàvas, anubhàvas and vyabhicâribhàvas ). These vibhävas, etc., enter ( i. e., make an impression on ) the mind of the appreciative, sympathetic reader ( or spectator ). Then by the power of the peculiar mental reflection ( on the vibhävas etc. ), on the part of the reader and in cooperation with his appreciative attitude, the vibhävas etc., become divested of their individualistic limitations and become univer-tsalised ( or generalised ), and vibhävas like Dusyanta and Sakuntalâ lose their individualistic natures as Dusyanta and éakuntalà and stand out before us in the universal character of manhood and womanhood in general. In the realm of poetics, fundamental causal factors like Sakuntalâ, exciting causal factors like moonlight, effect-factors like the shedding of tears and collateral, accessory effect-factors, like anxiety etc., are designated by the names àlambanavibhàva, udd ìpanavi b h ï va, anubhàva and vyabhicàribhàva res­pectively. They are extraworldly ( alaukika, i. e. they are idealised ( and not presented as they exist in ordinary life ) so as to serve the purpose of awaken­ing and nourishing a particular mental mood ( such as love etc. ). In the ordinary world they are called àiambanakàrana, uddïpakàrana, kàrya and sahakàrin, but when idealised so as to suit the atmosphere of poetry and drama, they are known by the names vibhävas, anubhàvas and vyabhicàri- bhävas.“ For it has been said that a sthäyibhäva revealed ( or suggested ) by the vibhävas etc. is called by the name of rasa ” .1 Revealed ( or suggested ) means 44 made the object of revelation ( or suggestion ) ” .

Just as a lamp covered by an earthen bowl (or wicker-basket) begins to shine by it self, and illumines nearby objects as soon as the cover is taken away, in the same way pure consciousness in the form of the àtman( i. e. the àtman who is pure consciousness and supreme bliss), which is covered by ignorance, desire etc. begins to shine on its own (svayam prakàsate) and illumines the sthàyibhàvas like rati, etc., along with ( appropriate ) vibhàvas, etc. For the sthàyibhàvas like rati are the properties (or attributes) of the mind (in as much as they are of the form of mental impressions or instincts embedded in the mind) and hence they arc admitted (by rhetoricians and Vedàntins) to be capable of being illumined by the sàksin ( i. e. the àtman consisting of pure consciousness ) ( as soon as the enveloping veil in the form of ignorance, desire etc., is removed). There should be no difficulty in accepting that even the vibhàvas, anubhävas and vyabhicàribhàvas are illumined by the àtman ( although they possess an objective character and are objective entitities like ghata, pat a. etc. ), on the analogy of the horse etc. seen ina dream, or on the analogy of the silver (erroneously) perceived in a piece of tin ( rangarajata). According to this view rasa is nothing but the subtle, latent instincts like love etc. As these instincts are permanent moods of the mind, rasa also is permanent in character. Now the question arises, how rasa is said to come into existence and cease to exist if it is permanent in its nature. The answer is that origination ( utpatti) and cessation ( vinosa) really belong to the aesthetic experience ( canoni) of the vibhàvas, anubhàvas and vyabhicàribhàvas which are the suggestors of the rasa. Or origination and cessation may be said to belong to the àvaranabhanga (removal of the screen in the form of ignorance, desire etc. which covers up the blissful con- ciousness ). But the origination and cessation are metaphorically transferred to rasa by laksanà (rase upacaryete). For this an illustration is given from the sphota doctrine of the grammarians. The letters in the form of sphota are really eternal. But they are in ordinary language spoken of as subject to origination and cessation, only in a metaphorical sense. They are said to be subject to origination and cessation because of the origination and cessa­tion of the contacts between the places of articulation ( palate etc. ) and the articulators (tip of the tongue etc.). The duration of the removal of the screen of ignorance, desire, worldly distractions etc., is conditioned by the enjoyment (carvana) of the vibhàvas, anubhàvas and vyabhicàribhàvas ( i. e. the removal of the screen of ignorance etc., lasts only so long as the enjoy­ment of the vibhàvas etc., last ). The moment the enjoyment of the vibhàvas etc., comes to an end, the light of one’s own blissful consciousness be­comes veiled once again by the power of ignorance, desire, worldly distrac­tions etc., and the light of consciousness that until now illumined the sthàyi*"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"APPENDIX175bhàvas being itself enveloped, the sthàyibhàvas though permanent ( i. e. though present and exisiting all along), do not shine any longer, and their enjoyment comes to an end. This is the reason why, and this is the sense in which, rasa is said to be subject to origination and cessation.Or we may say as follows : because of the enjoyment of the vibhàvas, anubhàvas and vyabhicàribhàvas, which enjoyment is evoked ( or is called into play, unmisita ) by the sympathetic attitude of the appreciative reader or spectator), the mind of the appreciative reader or spectator dwelling on the various sthàyibhàvas, becomes transformed into the blissful consciousness which is the nature of the àtman, just as in the case of a Yogin, his mind becomes transformed into blissful consciousness during deep meditation ( satmdhi ). This transformation of the mind into the blissful consciousness (which is the real nature of the àtman) amounts to the identification of the mind with blissful consciousness (tanmayibhavana). Now this bliss is not comparable with any of the ordinary worldly joys; because ordinary worldly joys are a property of the mind ( antahkarana ), ( while this bliss, kàvyànanda^ is the essence of the àtman itself). (Really speaking kàvyànanda is not identical with brahmànanda or brahmàsvàda, because it is produced by the laukikasàmagrij such as the contemplation of the vibhàvas, anubhàvas and vyabhicàribhàvas as described in a poem or exhibited in a drama, and so it is essentially laukika. But still it is alaukika in the sense that it is not com­parable to any of the joys of this world. At the time of experiencing worldly joys, the àtman enters into contact with the mind so that laukikànanda is cittavçttisamyuktacaitanyasvarûpa. But Kàvyànanda-or rasacarvanàjanyànanda- is suddhacaitanyarùpa, i. e. at the time of experiencing rasàsvàda the cittavrtti itself becomes transformed into the bliss of pure consciousness ). Jagannàtha sums up the view of Abhinavagupta and his followers on rasa realisation as follows :“ Thus in the light of the real intention ( svàrasya i.e. abhipràya) of the works of Abhinavagupta and of Mammata and others, rasa is a sthàyibhàva such as rati, characterised by blissful consciousness ( i. e. becoming the object of pure, blissful consciousness which is the àtman's real nature ) from which the covering lid has been removed ( bhagnàvarànacidvisistah, i. e. bhagnàvaranacidvisayabhütah). But, says Jagannâtha, really speaking the view of Abhinavagupta and Mammata ought to be stated as follows : rasa is the blissful consciousness itself from which the covering lid ( of ignorance, desire and worldly distractions ) has been removed and of which the sthàyi­bhàvas like rati have become the object ( ratyàdyavacchinnà bhagnàvaranà cid eva rasah). This emended statement of the view of Abhinavagupta and Mammata is based on the bruti passage : raso vai sah. rasam hy evàyam labdhvà ànandì bhavati. The difference between the two statements of Abhinava- XXV"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"1763TFclT*ïgupta’s and Mammata’ s view consists in the shifting of the vi'sesanavisesya- bhàva. According to the first statement bhagnàvaranà cid becomes the visesana and ratyàdisthàyibhàva becomes the visesya. According to the second state­ment, ratyàdisthàyibhàva becomes the visesana and bhagnàvaranà cid becomes the visesya. But according to Jagannàtha, the second statement is much more in harmony with the sruti passage quoted above, although the first statement is in keeping with what Abhinavagupta and Mammata have actually said in their works. “ But in any case, (i.e. under both the statements) the element of con­sciousness ( cidamsa ) is either a visesana ( in the first statement ) or a visesya (in the second statement), and one thing is certain ( or established ) that rasa is eternal (nitya) and self-luminous ( svaprakasa ), because rasa is vitally con­nected with the cidamsa ( either as visesana or as visesya ) and the cidamsa is eternal and self-luminous. Thus from the point of view of the cidamka, rasa is eternal and self-luminous, though from the point of view of the ratyàdisthâyi- bhàva it is non-eternal ( anitya ) and illumined by something else ( para- prakasa or itarabhasya )” . ( Hence both the remarks, namely rasah nityahsvaprakàkak ca and rasah anityah itarabhàsyas ca, are justifiable from their respective viewpoints. )Jagannàtha then goes on to say that the relishing of rasa is nothing but the breaking off ( or withdrawal ) of the screen ( or mantle ) ( of ignorance, etc.) covering the pure consciousness (cidgatàvaranabhahgah) or the trans­formation of the mind into the bliss of pure consciousness which is the nature of the àtman ( tadàkàrà, i. e. svasarûpànandàkàrà, antahkaranavrttih ). Now this aesthetic enjoyment (rasacarvam) is different from (and is not identical with ) the meditational trance ( samàdhi or brahmasvada ). For it has for its object ( älambana ) the bliss of pure consciousness blended with the cognition ( or consciousness ) of the vibhàvas, anubhàvas and vyabhicàri- bhävas—which are worldly or mundane matters ( visaya, i. e. sàmsàrikapadà- rtha). But brahmasvada or parabrahmasaksatkara is not mixed or blended with the cognition ( or consciousness ) of worldly matters. ( It is visuddha- brahmavisayaka or atmanandavisayaka ). Further, aesthetic enjoyment ( rasa- svada or rasacarvam ) is the outcome of the special function, namely vyahjam peculiar to poetry, while brahmàsvàda is the outcome of the process laid down in the Upanisads, viz. sravana, manana, nididhyàsana, etc. [ Thus there is a difference between rasàsvàda and brahmasvada with regard to the visaya ( object ) and the means ( karana or sadhana ) ].We translate the next section ( beginning : athàsyam sukhàm’sabhàn$,etc. ) :“ Objection : what evidence or authority ( mànam ) is there for holding that in rasàsvàda (or rasacarvam) there is the experience of an element of happiness (joy or pleasure) (sukhàmka)!"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"APPENDIX177Reply : A similar counter-question ( paryanuyoga ) could be raised in regard to samàdhi ( or brahmàsvàda ). In other words it may be asked : what is the evidence ( or authority ) for saying that in meditational trance also there is the experience of happiness ( or bliss ) ?Objection: Why, there is the following evidence (in the form of a quotation from the Bhagavadgìtà, to prove that in brahmàsvàda there is the experience of bliss). The Gità says (VI. 21 ) : sukham àtyantikam yat tad buddhigràhyam atindriyam—which means that brahmàsvàda is full of happi­ness which is super-sensuous, which is perceptible directly by the intellect ( intuition ) and which is àtyantika, i. e. transcending every other kind of mundane joy.Reply : we ( too ) have the authority of a scriptural ( upanisadic ) state­ment to prove that rasàsvàda is full of happiness. The scriptural statement is : raso vai sah. rasam hy evàyam labdhvà ànandi bhavati.”[ Actually, however, this scriptural statement refers to the àtman and not to aesthetic experience. The proper meaning of the statement is : ‘‘ That {àtman) is surely ( vai) rasa (jo y or bliss). Having realised the ( àtman which is ) rasa (bliss) he becomes happy or blissful.77 In the first part of the quotation, the àtman is equated with rasa ( i. e. ananda — supreme joy or bliss ). In the second part o f the quotation it is said that having realised that àtman which is rasarnpa or ànandarûpa, he, i. e. the spiritual aspirant (sàdhaka), becomes supremely happy {ànandi bhavati). But Jagannàtha seems to have understood both parts of the quotation as referring to rasa in poetry or drama, i. e. as referring to aesthetic experience. He understood the second part to mean : “ having realised rasa7 i. e. the emotional flavour, he ( i. e. the sahrdaya or sàmòjika ) becomes supremely happy ” . But we doubt very much if the quotation from the Upanisad is capable of such an interpretation ].“ In addition to this scriptural statement serving as evidence to show that rasàsvàda is ànandarûpa, the ànandampatva of rasàsvàda is borne out by a second authority, namely the direct experience of the sahrdaya.” Jagan­natha means that just as the ànandampatva of the brahmàsvàda is supported by the quotation from the Bhagavadgìtà, and by actual experience of the Yogins, in the same way the ànandampatva of rasàsvàda is supported by the scriptural passage given above ( namely : raso vai sah. rasam hy evàyam labdhvà ànandi bhavati ) and by the direct experience of the sahrdaya.Here is our translation of the next section : yeyam dvitiyapakse, etc. :“ The rasacarvanà (or rasàsvàda) which has been described by us above in connection with the second statement of Abhinavagupta’s view as consist­ing in a mental condition transformed into the bliss which is the àtman% well,"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"178that rasacarvanä (or rasäsväda) is both säbda (verbal) and aparoksa (i. e. of the nature of direct experience — pratyaksarupa ) Jagannâtha means that it is säbda because it is induced by sabdavyäpära, namely vyahjanär, and by abhidhä which always precedes vyanjanä. Rasacarvanä (or rasäsväda) is aparoksa ( i. e. pratyaksarupa ) because its object is ätmänanda ( aparoksa- sukhälambanatvät ). Thus rasäsväda is both säbda ( i. e. sabdavyäpärabfiävya) and aparoksa, just as the knowledge of the identity between the jïvàtman and the paratmtman, arising out of the Upanisadic statement—tat tvam asi—, is säbda in so far as it is the outcome of the sentence tat tvam asi, and is also aparoksa (i. e. pratyaksarupa) as it is a matter of direct, actual experience ( säkstkära ) for the spiritual aspirant (yogin )."},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"BIBLIOGRAPHYAbhinavabhàrati : See Nâtyasàstra.Agnipuräna : Ànandàs'rama Edition, No. 41, Poona, 1900.Alankärakaustubha of Kavjkarnapûra : ed. with an old commentary and-a gloss by Sivaprasada Bhattacharya, Varendra Research Society, Rajshahi, Bengal, December, 1926.Alankàrasarvasva of Ruyyaka : edited with the commentary of Jayaratha, by G.

Mâdhava ( Vidyaranya ) does not mention the legend in the Sankaradigvijaya even though he does tell the story of his seeking sexual knowledge in order to respond to the questions of Säradä, Mandanamis'ra’s wife. After having studied and put into practice Vâtsyàyana’s Kàmasùtra, he is also credited with a work on erotics :svayam vyadhattàbhinavàrthagarbham nibandham ekäm nrpavesadhàrì /( from Naràyana Ràmàcàrya’s Bhümikà, p. 1 to the Amaru).The most commonly held belief o f the Vedàntasampradàya in relation to sexual love is expressed very graphically by Vidyaranya in his Sankaradig­vijaya, VIII. 25 ( p. 303, Ânandâs’rama ed. ) :yàsàm stanyam tvayà pltam yàsàm jàto 'si yonitah / tàsu mûrkhatama strisu pasuvad ramose katham //But then, with the honorable exception of Kashmir Saivism, what religious system has been fair to women ?P. XIV, line 11 : Abhinava uses this same simile again in the Locana, p. 2 1 2 and adds : akalusodakadrstàntena, on the analogy of a clean piece of cloth that is dipped into clear water and absorbs all the water. In the same way the sensitive reader absorbs poetry.P. 2, fn. 1 : On p. 223, Vol. II of the A. Bh., Abhinava disagrees with Bhattatauta. It should be noted that Ananda too is not bound by tradition. Thus on p. 340 of the D. Â1. he says that it is a mistake to slavishly follow the doctrine of Bharata :......................na tu kevalam sàstrasthitisampàdanecchayà, and again.......................bharatamatànusaranamàtrecchayà ghatanam.P. 2, fn. 3, line 7 : There is no doubt that Anandavardhana knew Vàkpatiràja’s poem, for on p. 173 (B .

Unfortunately, his commentary on the 7th Adhyàya has not been found yet.P. 22, line 1 : Note Abhinava in Voi. III. p. 124 of the A. Bh. on the paramàtman and drama.P. 24, fn. 3, line 11: Cf. A. Bh.

What Professor Pandey actually wrote ( in a personal letter to Mr. Masson, May 1, 1969) is: Bhàskara Kantha, the author of the commentaryBhàskari on thelsvara Pratyabhijnà Vimarsini of Abhinavagupta wrote a long commentary on it, the fragment of which I saw in Srinagar which his descendants possess.”P. 34, fn. 1 : Ànandavardhana, on p. 487 of the D. À1. quotes a stanza which earlier writers claimed to be an example of vyâjastuti ( which Änanda rejects, since there can be no gunlbhùtayahgyatà in V. and Änanda regards this verse as an ex. of aprastutaprasamsà ). On page 489 he says that the stanza is commonly attributed to Dharmakïrti: tatha càyam dharmaklrteh sloka iti prasiddhih. He then goes on to say that that is perfectly possible in the light of another stanza ( which he quotes ) that is definitely ( Locana: nirvivàdatadìyasloka ) by Dharmakïrti.P. 34. fn. 1, line 10 : Tat tanmataparïksàyâm granthàntare nirûpayi- syàmah means : “ We will deal with this in another work, in the examination of the Buddhist views ” .

Abhinava’s remarks, which are based on first-hand knowledge, are confusing. Dharmottara wrote a commentary on Dharmakirti’s Pramana- viniscaya called the Viniscayatlka, that has been preserved in the Tibetan Tanjur, though not in Sanskrit ( see Dharmottaraprad'ipa, Tibetan Sanskrit Works Series, Vol. II, Patna, 1955-W e are indebted to Professor J. W. de Jong for this information). Vivrtican either mean“ an explanation” in general, or it can be an actual commentary ( e. g. Nàtyavedavivrtiy and Pratyabhijnàvivrti ). We could translate Abhinava’s remarks as follows : “ Another work ” refers to the commentary (vivrti) called Dharmottarion the Viniscayatìkà by the author of this work ( i. e. the D. ÀI., that is, Ânanda- vardhana). This ( issue ) has been explained in that w ork.” Or Dharmo­ttari could be the name of the commentary on the Viniscaya ( i.e. Darmakirti’s Pramanaviniscaya ). In this case the meaning would be : “ That issue has been discussed in the gloss which was written by this author (namely Ananda ) on the Dharmottari, a commentary on the Viniscaya. ” This would mean that Ânanda wrote an actual commentary on a Buddhist text. To our knowledge, there is no commentary by a Hindu writer on a Buddhist text. The work, therefore, would be unique. But we have seen that much of what Ànandavardhana did was unique, and this need not deter us from explaining the lines in the manner we have. Jacobi ( ZDMG Voi. 57, p. 328 ) writes : Nach Abhinavagupta in Niscayatlka, bei der Erklärung der Dharmottara. Es scheint nämlich dharmottamäyä statt dharmottamäyäm gelesen werden zu müssen. ” The reading dharmottamäyä is found in the KM ed. of the D.

But we find * it curious that Abhinava is silent on the many passages where Bharata speaks of all eight rasas but omits sànta. For instance : in XX. 72, Voi.

In chapter XVII verses 128-129, the various forms of khku are mentioned for each rasa, excluding sänta, and again Abhinava ( Vol. II. p. 396 ) has no explanation. The same is true of XVII 103-104, where the svaras are mentioned for each rasa, and Vol. II, p. 398, where the pàthos are given for each rasa, excluding iànta.P. 139, fn, 2 line: This might refer to a pâthàntara of the NS textitself.rP. 145, line : We drop nanu as in the NSP ed. of the Dasarûpaka.P. 150, note 3 : We cannot agree with Dr. Raghavan and the late S. K. De when they hold that Dhanika did not allow santarasa even in poetry. We think he did. Clearly both scholars have followed the NSP edition, which reads, in the avataranikä to verse 45 (ch. VI) nanu before santarasasya ( as well as anabhidheyatvât in place of anabhineyatvàt ), which would turn this passage into the words of the Pürvapaksin. Thus the final phrase : kâvyavisayatvam na nivaryate is the position of the Pürva­paksin. Now comes the difficulty : who speaks the words atas tad ucyate! If we suppose that this is the Pürvapaksin, who is seeking support in the line o f Dhanafijaya, then the pürvapaksa must continue with santo hi yadi tävat up till svàdayitàrali santi. But these two positions are contradictory : in the first part, sänta is admitted in poetry, and in the second part it is excluded. So the words atas tad ucyate must be the words of Dhanika. But this also makes bad sense, because if Dhanika is responding to the pürva­paksa, he would be interpreting verse 45 to mean that there is no santarasa at all. In that case, what would the words at the end of the paragraph: taduk- tyaiva sàntarasàsvàdo nirüpitah mean? Obviously they are meant to esta­blish some sort of existence for santarasa. In view of these arguments, we feel that the reading nanu is not correct, since it seems to us clear, both from our interpretation of VI. 45, and from the concluding lines of the Avaloka thereon, that Dhanika did accept santarasa in poetry. Without nanu, the avataranikä is by Dhanika himself, and is meant to introduce the notion of sàntararasa in kàvya. Atas tad ucyate follows most logically : Therefore,the following is said:” . Now the words santo hi yadi tâvat represent Dhanika’s objections to the description o f santarasa given in the verse na yatra duhkham etc. He ends his objection by saying: na ca tathàbhütasya santarasasya sahrdayàh svàdayitàrah santi, “ There are no sensitive readers who could enjoy such a santarasa. ” In the Gujerati Press ed. the next words are athàpi, namely, “ nonetheless” , i. e. in spite of this definition o f santarasa, we can admit its existence by understanding it to be, not an indescribable state, but one in which there is mudità etc. In other words, Dhanika accepts"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"‘194STITCHsântarasa, but he refuses to characterise it as negative the way the definition he quotes does. The reading of the NSP ed., simply atha, makes bad sense, for this would have to be part of the purvapaksa, which would, in that case, never be answered by the siddhànta. It is clear from IV. 45, that Dhananjaya accepted some form of santarasa. We accept the reading anirvàcya, since nirvâcya would mean simply: It can be defined, or explained. But if this is what Dhananjaya felt, why did he not mention it among the 8 sthàyibhàvas? The reason is that it follows automatically, since it consists of muditâ etc., which are the same as vistara, vikàsa, etc. which were already mentioned in IV. 43, and so there is no need to mention it separately. This is what is meant by anirvàcya. If Raghavan and De are correct, how would they explain the line in the Avaloka : taduktyaiva santarasâsvàdo nirüpitah, which clearly indicates that santarasa can be aesthetically enjoyed ?"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"INDEXReferences are to page numbers, with n after a number indicating that it is found in the notes.
