It is a brief treatise in which the author outlines the doctrine of which he is a notable exponent, namely non- dualistic Éaivism, which he designates in his works as the Trika, or ‘Triad* of three principles: £iva, Éakti and the embodied soul (nara).The main interest of the Paramarthasara is not only that it serves as an intro­duction to the established doctrine of a tradition, but also advances the notion of jlvanmukti, ‘liberation in this life*, as its core theme. Further, it does not confine itself to an exposition of the doctrine as such but at times hints at a second sense lying beneath the evident sense, namely esoteric techniques and practices that are at the heart of the philosophical discourse. Its commentator, Yogarâja (eleventh century), excels in detecting and clarifying those various levels of meaning.An Introduction to Tantric Philosophy presents, along with a critically revised Sanskrit text, the first annotated English translation of both Abhinavagupta*s Paramarthasara and Yogaraja’s commentary.This book will be of interest to Indologists, as well as to specialists and students of Religion, Tantric studies and Philosophy.Lyne Bansat-Boudon is Professor in the Section des sciences religieuses at the École Pratique des Hautes Études (EPHE) in Paris, and an Honorary Senior Member of the Institut Universitaire de France (IUF).

The series aims to promote the serious study of both Hindu and Buddhist tantric traditions through the publication of anthropological and textual studies and will not be limited to any one method. Indeed, the series would hope to promote the view that anthropological studies can be informed by texts and textual studies informed by anthropology. The series will therefore publish contempo­rary ethnographies from different regions, philological studies, philosoph­ical studies, and historical studies of different periods which contribute to the academic endeavour to understand the role of tantric texts and their meaning in particular cultural contexts. In this way, the series will hope to establish what the continuities and divergencies are between Buddhist and Hindu tantric traditions and between different regions.

However, it has been judged desirable to make the basic vocabulary of the doctrine visible to the reader. Thus, the Sanskrit term is instanced— when it designates a key notion of the Trika, or one of its favorite metaphors, and at its first occurrence,— when it is required in order to grasp the sense of a gloss (e.g., ad 33, where krida is glossed by khela)y— in order to take note of the more or less uniform translation of di­verse, but essentially synonymous, Sanskrit terms, e.g., X Y Z, all of which have been translated by ‘consciousness* (note, especially, the variety of terms for ‘liberation*),— mutatis mutandis, in order to take note of the polysemy of certain crucial Sanskrit terms, paramarsa, paramartha, smrti, etc.Certain Sanskrit terms of wider, but often technical usage, whose meaning is not easily grasped, or which are expanded upon, have been treated in the notes. Literal translations are likewise to be found there.Sanskrit terms that have become, or are used as, English words are left in Roman, and may accept a plural suffix: karika, sloka, mantra, avatara- nika, guru, karman, etc.Likewise, marks of suppletions have been limited as much as possible to those necessary to make sense of an often laconic Sanskrit, especially as concerns the many technical explanations of concepts and terms. The frequently occurring aha, referring always to Abhinavagupta, has been rendered by ‘the master says’.Glosses or terms to be understood as such are enclosed in single quo­tation marks.

The two ParamârthasâraThe Paramârthasâra, or ‘Essence of Ultimate Reality*, is a work of the Kashmirian polymath Abhinavagupta (end of the tenth, beginning of the eleventh century). It is a brief treatise,1 a compendium2 in which the author outlines the doctrine of which he is a notable exponent (indeed, the most fecund), namely nondualistic Saivism, which he designates in his works as the ‘Trika*, or ‘Triad* of three principles: Siva, Sakti and the embodied soul (nara).3According to Yogaraja (second half of the eleventh century), the au­thor of its commentary, Vivrti, the Paramârthasâra is of the nature of a prakararia,4 a ‘manual* or ‘précis* serving as introduction to the estab­lished doctrine of a tradition.5 The work, appropriately, begins by1The commentary ad 104 uses the term éâstra.2samk$epa or samgraha. See 2nd mahgalâcarana of the commentary (paramârthasârasam- Açepa), Paramârthasâra [PS] 104 (idam... samksepam), 105 (tad idam samksiptam iâstrasâram) and the colophon of the commentary (paramârthasârasamgrahavivfti).3See, for instance, Tantrâloka (TÀ) X 1, XIII 348 and (as the periphrastic expression ‘çadardha’, ‘half of six’) TÀ XIII 301 (where is established the supremacy of the Trika over all Saiva currents), XVI158, XXXVII 26, 68, etc. I use the term ‘Trika’ here in this sense. On the historical development of the Trika and other symbolic meanings of the term itself, see Sanderson 1995: 672; 2007. The preeminent concern of this essay, ‘nondualistic’ or ‘non­dual’ (advaita) Saivism of Kashmir, will be, when the context does not tend to confusion, referred to simply as Kashmir Saivism or even as Saivism. On this ‘Triad*, see avataranikà [avat.) ad PS 41 (n. 875) and 46.4 See avat. ad PS 2-3 and 105, and n. 276 on prakarana.5As YR puts it in his commentary ad 104, the theme underlying the entire text is ‘[that brahman], in reference to which a concise summary (samkfepa) containing the essential pur­port (tàtparya) [of our doctrine] has been stated, and explained, by Abhinavagupta, whose name is to be mentioned with reverence [i.e., celebrated)’. In his gloss of PS 105, YR under­lines as well the esoteric dimension of such a tradition, thus “revealed”, at least in part, to the1"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"2INTRODUCTIONfeaturing a mumuksu, one who ‘aspires to liberation’, a student desirous of learning from a master the means whereby he may put an end to his dolorous wanderings through the cycles of rebirth.6The Paramarthasara shares with the vast majority of Indian philosoph­ical texts this propaedeutic purpose that is encoded as well in the title of the work, which may equally be understood as signifying ‘The Core of the Teachings on Ultimate Reality’, as Yogaraja explains in his gloss of the second and third verses.71.1. The Paramarthasara of AdisesaWhat makes the Paramarthasara of Abhinavagupta unique is the nature of its exposition of the doctrine. It does not in all respects correspond to the ordinary model of a prakarana. 8In its second and third verses, which recount its “myth of origin”, this Paramarthasara is presented as a saivite reworking of another Paramar­thasara, attributed to Adisesa, also called Adhara 9 (sixth or seventh cen­sincere adept: ‘This core of the teaching astrasara), that is, that essence Csatattva) spread throughout numerous texts, has been condensed by me; that is, has been stated [by Abhina­vagupta] after having mastered it himself, within the small span of hundred verses, though it can hardly be explained in a thousand texts. By this is stated [as well] the resourcefulness [of the author’s] luminous consciousness (pratibha)’.6See YR ad 101, where the gods say, apropos the ‘failed’ aspirant (yogabhrasta): [...] yasya svatmani jijnasdrtham prdgjanmani udyamo ’bhut, ‘It is he [after all] whose striving in a previous life was motivated by a desire to know regarding his own Self.7The polysemy of the term artha makes other interpretations possible: ‘The Essence of Ultimate Meaning’ (see PS 59 and YR ad loc.), or, more pregnantly, ‘Principles essential in attaining the Supreme Goal of life’, namely mok$a — see PS 103 and YRad 104, quoted p. 33. The term ‘sara’ (lit., ‘sap’, ‘vivifying juice’) itself participates in the pun, expressing on the one hand the ‘kernel’ or ‘core* of the Real, from which the inessential has been stripped away, and on the other, the ‘heart* of the teaching, from which superfluous or ancillary discussion has been abstracted.8See p. 19.9A1so Ananta — all these being synonymous with £e$a, Vi$nu’s serpent. Hence the al­ternative titles of the work: Adhdrakdrikd, or Anantakarika, to which is sometimes added a descriptive title: Aryapancdfiti, ‘The [work composed of] eighty-five aryas*. The tradition also makes this identification, conferring on the author a quasi-divine status (cf. the epi­thet jagadadhara, ‘support of the world’, v. 87). And so, Raghavananda [R], a late Advaitin (probably 16th cent.), author of the Paramdrthasdravivarana [APSV], the only commentary on the first PS to have come down to us, observes, in his gloss on v. 87: iesah anantas tu na yah ko ’pi vipaicit, ‘¿e$a, namely Ananta, not some sage or other*. But, in his gloss on v. 3, he qualifies this same Ananta as jivanmuktam guruvaram (papraccha), ‘[he asks) the most excellent teacher, liberated while alive ...’ The same ambiguity is seen in YR’s commentary, which sometimes presents Adhara as a sage (muni), a mortal, but also associates Adhara or iesa directly with a divine figure, Anantanatha — ‘Lord Ananta’— sometimes termed also the ‘presiding deity of Maya’ (TA VIII 323a, with the commentary of Jayaratha [JR] (fl. ca. 1250; see Sanderson 2007: 418-419), the Tontrdlokaviveka [TAV]; references toTAV will be made to Dwivedi and Rastogi’s ed. 1987).

Another thread of the tradition (in fact, the edition of the text, published in the Pandit, 1871) identifies Se$a with Patanjali: ¿rimadbhagavacche$ak[târyâpahcà£ïtih samàptâ (colophon) vs. inmadbhagavatpatanjaliviraci- târyâh (incipit). The Western mentality will of course attem pt to resolve the ambiguity: the author is one Àdtée$a, so named, who is a devotee of Visnu. The line between divinity and honored predecessor being always difficult to draw in India, such identifications serve as well as ways of claiming greater authority for the text in question. In these notes, the Paramâr- thasàra of Âdiie$a will be designated by the abbreviation ÀPS [ = Àdi£e$aparamârthasàra], the Paramârthasâra of Abhinavagupta, by PS.10The Yuktidipikâ ad Sâmkhyakârikâ [SK] 2 cites v. 83 of ÂPS. This anonymous commentary is situated ca. 550 Ad by Frauwallner (1973, vol.

In accordance with [these] sentences, as pronounced in the foregoing, explain to me Primordial Nature and Soul!’ (tr. Danielson — as are all translations from ÀPS cited here, unless otherwise specified).13See, notably, Bouy Agamaiâstra [Àé]: 23-28; Mahadevan 1975: 16-22; Bhattacharya AS: LXXIXff.14See ÀPS 27. Àdtée$a shares notably with Bhartjprapanca the conception of a saprapati- cabrahman, in virtue of which brahman, in the course of evolution, passes through different states (avast/id), eight in number, according to Bhartjprapanca (see Hiriyanna 1924), five, according to Àdtéeça (v. 27).15See APS 31.16Thus, by some authors, the PS of Àdiéesa has been identified as essentially vedàntic, in reference, particularly, to v. 31, whose terminology is indubitably vedàntic, and to the last verse (which may nevertheless be a late interpolation): vedântaJâstram akhilam vilokya ée$as tu [...] (Ganapati Sâstrî ÀPS: preface; Suryanarayana Sastri ÀPS: VII; Bhatttacharya À& LXXX; Bouy ÀS: 18, 27; note that the ¿abdakalpadruma identifies the text of the Paramâr­thasâra as the ‘work of ¿esanàga’, in 79 âryàs, s.v. vedânta); note also that the later vedàntic tradition, represented notably by the Jîvanmuktiviveka (14th c e n t) appropriates the first Paramârthasâra for its demonstration of jivanmukti, presuming to ignore £aiva arguments entirely on that notion. Others consider it as more akin to Sâmkhya (Pandey 1963: 63; Sil- bum PS: 19: ‘un Sâmkhya teinté de Vi$nouisme (sic), par conséquent théiste’), or vaiçnavite (Bamett PS: 708). P. Hacker (1965: 154) treats the ÀPS as one of the texts ‘that profess Vai$navism and teach radical advaitism at the same time’. For Danielson (ÀPÎ>: 4, 6, 10),"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"4INTRODUCTIONThe doctrine that emerges from the earlier Paramdrthasara reflects at least a part of the conceptual apparatus of Samkhya evolutionism, placing it within the general framework of a vedantic metaphysics that posits from the start the unreality of the phenomenal w orld,17 itself the result of the all-powerful maya of Visnu — a deity who, however, seems little but the personification of a principle that the text terms equally brahman, dtman, or paramatman. This doctrine, evidently eclectic, is none the less suffi­ciently coherent to be qualified as “synthetic”. The text attempts, in effect, to integrate both the perspectives (darsana) of Samkhya and of Vedanta, rather than considering them as alternatives, unifying them within the rubric of a Vaisnavism whose “divinity”, whatever his name, serves as unique principle — thus, in effect, privileging the nondual aspect of the doctrine and placing it squarely within the currents of early devotional- ism .18A programmatic verse at the beginning of Adhara’s response to the disciple sketches the basic outlines of such a doctrine: T shall propound this “Essence of Supreme Truth” (paramdrthasara) after making obeisance to that Upendra [ = Visnu], by whom this unreal world was made from Primordial Matter as something seemingly real’. 19Moreover, one has the feeling that the questions put by the disciple are principally framed in terms of Samkhya,20 whereas the responses of the teacher are usually couched in advaitic terms, even though the latter continues to utilize (in order to make himself better understood?) several Samkhya concepts — always careful, however, to establish equivalences, where possible, with key notions of the other system — for instanceprakfti, persistently identified with the maya of Visnu.21 As a matter of fact, the disciple poses two questions: how liberation is achieved (w . 4 and 6 ),22 and how he is to grasp what is at issue in distinguishing purusa and prakrti (v. 7). It is the master who, in the course of his response, unifies the twodespite numerous Samkhya traits, ‘the work as a whole belongs to a tradition of Vedanta, and one we may call Bhedabhedadvaita’.17APS 2: atmamburasau nikhilo 'pi loko magno 'pi nacamati neksate caj alcaryam etan mf- gaq^nikabhe bhavamburalau ramate m jfaiva//, ‘The whole world, though submerged in the ocean of the Self (atman), neither drinks from nor looks at it. It is a mystery that [the world] just blindly lusts for the ocean of existences, which is like a mirage’; also APS 9, cited infra.18It might be said that the same tactic is employed in all the manifestos of devotionalism, including the Gita, which may well have served as model for those that followed.19APS 9: satyam iva jagad asatyam mulaprakfter idam kftam yena/ tarp pranipatyopendram vaksye paramdrthasaram idam //.20Even if he addresses (APS 4) a master whom he celebrates as ‘one who has mastered Veda and Vedanga’, as him ‘who speaks the truth’ (ptavaktf) — that is, comments R, who knows ‘the complete meaning of Vedanta [viz., of the upani$ads], formed by the words of the Lord, Brahma, etc.’.21 APS 10b: maydmayi pravfttih samhriyata iyam punah kram aiah//, ‘[Then] this Manifes­tation, which consists of Magic (mdyd), is absorbed again in [reverse] order’.22APS 4: saifisdrdmavataranaprasnam ppcchamy aham bhagavam"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"I. THE TWO PARAMARTHASARA5requests by introducing a third term, brahman (or âtmari) ,23 an upanisadic notion, hence vedàntic, qualified as advaita in verse 5 7 .24Thus, doubtless, the liminary caution of the master, who warns the student that the response will be difficult, and who exhorts him to make the necessary effort to understand it: ‘Although that which is to be said [about this] in the following is very hard to penetrate into even for those who have knowledge, do you hear it nevertheless!’25One may wonder whether Àdisesa’s preamble offers the occasion for apprehending the manner in which the transition between the two systems may have taken place. The transition is conceptual, if not chronological, which may have been the work of a thinker or group of thinkers — though we must not infer from this any anteriority of one system vis-à-vis the other, be it Sàmkhya dualism or the nondualism of the Vedanta.26 Thus the analogy of the chrysalis, which the student employs to illustrate the problematic of liberation from bondage,27 may also apply to the manner in which one doctrine emerges from the other — the same doctrine, to be sure, yet different, indeed perfected.Nevertheless, as he arrives at the end of the exposition, the reader no­tices that the doctrine — despite its apparently composite character — takes great care to designate and to present itself as a sarvâtmavâda, a ‘doctrine of the Universal Self or a ‘doctrine holding that all is the Self 28 — a term that proclaims the doctrine’s coherence by allying it with a long-established tradition that sees the Ultimate as both immanent and transcendent, but which in effect amounts to asserting another type of nondualism. The sarvâtmavâda of Àdisesa, in effect, finds its place within the lineages of Advaita and the traditions of Kashmir Saivism — monisms that proclaim, in consonance with many upanisads, that ‘the Self is AH’: ‘[There is] not a single doubt as to this, [viz., the fact that] this all is only the Self. Only when one realizes [this Self] as both having and not having parts, does one become free from the impenetrable darkness of Delusion,23In particular, APS 13 (àtman), 16-18, 19 {brahman), etc.24An advaitabrahman further described as sakataniskala, an oxymoron that R interprets as referring both to the saprapaňcabrahman of pre-Šaňkara Vedànta and to brahman as sat, cit, ánanda.25APS 8: ity âdhàro bhagaván pfitah šisyena tam sa hovâca/ viduçàm apy atigahanam vak- tavyam idam špiu tathàpi tvam //,26See Shastri PS: IX.

THE TWO PARAMARTHASARA71.2. Rewriting1.2.1. AppropriationHowever that may be, the claim made by the £aiva Paramdrthasdra to have rewritten the older Paramdrthasdra is quite unheard of in the history of Indian literature — where neither borrowing nor unattributed copying are much frowned upon 35 — for in this case it is not merely a matter of reproducing a text of well-known reputation,36 making here and there a few adjustments or innovations, but rather of appropriating, transforming, even investing another text, to make it better able to express an improved doctrine. This appropriation is justified on the assumption that the im­proved doctrine (in effect, Trika Saivism) is already present in seed form in the older doctrine (of AdiSesa), and that it is nothing but the accom­plishment of that older doctrine, from which it has erased all trace of dualism.The second Paramdrthasdra is thus a work that sees itself as the quint­essential distillation of another — though, to be fair, in formal terms, it is also an expansion, having added twenty or so verses — which process Yo- garaja illustrates by the analogy of butter extracted from clotted m ilk,37 an analogy that cuts two ways. For, in effect, while the clotting of milk represents a transformation that is spontaneous, given the right circum­stances, the production of butter requires will and effort. On the other hand, according to the Samkhya doctrine of causality, satkaiyavada, the effect is pre-existent in the cause, and so may the Trika itself, which adopts the same satkdryavdda, be understood by its advocates as already present in the ‘clotted milk* of Adiiesa’s “Samkhya”. What remains is that the transformation implies a supplementary effort, as well as a perfectioning — a threefold effort composed of reasoning (yukti), acquisition of experi­ence (anubhava), and scriptural exegesis (agama), as Yogaraja is fond of repeating.38Thus the process of rewriting at work in the second Paramdrthasdra35See Kdvyamimamsd, chapters XI-XII — or Dhvanyaloka, chapter IV.•^See, for instance, the different versions of the Madanapardjaya, The Defeat o f Love (Balbir, Osier 2004: 21 ff.).37‘That very Anantanatha, wise in teaching all the doctrines without exception, imparted instruction to the disciple, saying: “ [Knowledge of] brahman, the ultimate, may be attained through the text entitled Paramdrthasdra, also called the Verses of Adhdra, via the discrimina­tion of puru$a from prakfti, according to the principles of the Samkhya system\". The teacher (guni, viz., Abhinavagupta), motivated by the need to show favor to others, [now] expounds the essence of it, just as one extracts butter from curds; that is, he expounds the essence of teachings on ultimate reality (paramdrthopadeda) in keeping with the £aiva principle of ultim ate [or transcendent] nonduality, in order to show favor to all creatures’ (translations of AG’s PS and its commentary are the author’s).38With, sometimes, a fourth term: meditative practice (paridilana); see YR ad 8, 10-11, 79-80."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"8INTRODUCTIONmakes it appear that the debate with Samkhya has really never taken place, which justifies nondual £aivism of Kashmir in borrowing the theory of the tattvaSy all the while adapting it to the needs of a monistic system.39 Even though it is true that the doctrine set forth in the Saiva Paramdrthasara is framed polemically, as the commentary frequently attempts to demon­strate, 40 it is essentially directed against the Buddhists, particularly Dhar- maklrti, and against Vedanta, referred to by Yogaraja as Brahmavada at large, or as Santabrahmavada.41 I will return to this point later.In support of this interpretation of the exercise of rewriting — in ad­dition to the clotted milk analogy — I might point to the passage of the commentary where the term guruh of the third verse is understood to refer both to Adhara and to Abhinavagupta. Yogaraja's exegesis is supported by several liminary considerations: — the attribution of the first Paramar- thasdra to an author designated not only as Se$a but as Patanjali; — the traditional identification of Patanjali (whether he be the author of the Afa- habhasya, or of the Yogasutra [YS], or of both) with Se?a, in virtue of the epithetical designation bhujangavibhu, implying that Patanjali is a devotee39See p. 54. On the Saiddh5ntika treatm ent of the raftvas, see Tdntrikdbhidhdnakoia [TAK], s.v. tattva.40See, esp., PS 32 and the commentary ad loc., which, in the course of discussing rival conceptions of the Self, refers explicitly to the MImamsa (see n. 738, 740).41 See, for example, YR ad 10-11, 15, 27, 32 (where the ‘Brahmavada’ is referred to for its version of the ¿unyavada: neti neri), and 35. YR’s gloss permits us to complete Sanderson’s observation: ‘When Vedanta is expounded by its opponents in Kashmirian sources of our period it is the doctrine of M andanamiira which is generally in mind (...]. To my knowledge no source betrays familiarity with the doctrines of Sankara’ (1985: 210, n. 41 — Sander­son refers here, notably, to the commentary of Ramakan{ha on the Paramokfanirdsakdrikd of Sadyojyotis). It is in fact quite difficult to decide whether Saiva authors discuss or are aware of the niceties involved in distinguishing Mandana’s from Sankara’s doctrines. They nowhere deal with the issues dividing later vedantic schools; how then is it possible to know definitely which particular version of Vedanta they have in mind? All one can reasonably say, at least as regards the PS and its commentary, is that YR assigns to the ‘Brahmavada’ category both the Vedanta stricto sensu — which he also refers to as the S5ntabrahmav3da (ad 10-11) — and the Sabdabrahmavada of Bhartfhari and his followers. Accordingly, YR ad 27 refutes the conception of Self of the ‘Brahmavadins’ and that of the ‘Pranabrahm avadins’, viz., of Bhartfhari. And YR ad 35 applies the word ‘Brahmavadin’ to Bhartfhari. Bhartfhari (ca. 650 Ad), of course, is substantially prior both to Mandana and Sankara, who are more or less contemporaneous with each other. The distinction between these two sorts o f ‘Brah­mavada* seems much clearer in YR’s text than any putative distinction between the doctrines of Mandana and Sankara. One may wonder whether the Saivas of the lO th - llth cent, were aware of or interested in doctrinal differences among later vedantic “schools”, which may not have come into vogue in any case much before the time of Vacaspati and his great com­mentary, the Bhamati. It may be added that one of the main points of contention between Saivas and Advaitins, according to YR, concerns their respective interpretations of the ep­ithet ianta as applied to brahman: Idnta, for YR, does not mean ‘inert’, in the m anner of a stone, b u t ' “serene”, reposing [ever] in its absolute nature, in unison with its Sakti, for there is no disturbance arising from the dichotomy between the knower and the known’ (YR ad 10-11).

THE TWO PARAMARTHASARA9of the Serpent,42 and thus, in some degree, its incarnation; — the evi­dence of a south Indian tradition, which holds Abhinavagupta also to be an incarnation of Sesa,43 on the basis of a pun on his name when suffixed with the honorific -pada: abhinava-guptapada, ‘he, utterly novel, whose feet are hidden’. Though the attribution may appear fanciful, this line of argument does suggest, if ‘guru’ is to be understood as referring to more than one teacher in this passage, that Abhinavagupta and Adhara were also sometimes understood as the same teacher. The passage in question might then be translated: ‘The Teacher [Adhara] replied to him by [recit­ing] the Adharakdrika of which [as] Abhinavagupta, [he now] expounds the essence from the point of view of the Saiva teachings’.It should be noted also that verse 50 of Abhinavagupta’s Paramdrtha- sara: ‘Though not an agent, it is I who compose the wonderfully varied Siddhantas, Agamas and Tarkas’, besides echoing APS 65, amounts to an implicit proclamation of the superiority of the Trika doctrine. Thus is dis­closed one of the main purposes served, from the Trika point of view, by rewriting the Adisesa’s text: to put an end once and for all to the disputes of precedence among the schools, by affirming the uncontested supremacy of the Trika. At the same time, PS 50 provides another, as it were “meta­physical”, clue as to that rewriting: the true author of the Paramdrthasara, whether he be called Adi£esa or Abhinavagupta, is none other than Siva himself, the sole Agent, who is one’s own Self in the form of the absolute ‘I’. ‘Thus, says Siva, in Yogaraja’s commentary, though not myself their creator, it is / who cause the multitudinous wonders that are the Siddhan­tas, etc., [to come into being], having entered into the intentions of gods, sages and men, being [already] in essence their inner intuition (antahpra- tibha) and desirous of expounding [these doctrines] either in abridgement or in more elaborate form’. 441.2.2. Reasons fo r a choice1.2.2.1. DESTINY OF THE FIRST PARAMARTHASARA Why has the Paramdrthasara of AdiSesa been chosen as a text to be recomposed? It was, evidently, a text that enjoyed some celebrity in the Indian tradition — and may already have acquired by Abhinavagupta’s time the status of a iruti. Might one suppose that Abhinavagupta, in “rewriting” it, expected some transfer of its authority in his favor? 4542Note that TA XXVIII 285b, in quoting the pratika of YS IV 27, refers to the author of the YS as ‘Bhujag5dhl$a’, ‘Lord of the serpents’. Similarly, TA XXVIII 309b refers to AdiJe$a, author of the first PS, as Ahliana, v. 81 of whose work TA XXVIII 312 quotes.43See Pandey 1963: 10-11.44See n. 946.

Abhina- vagupta himself refers to Adisesa’s work elsewhere, citing twice its verse 81 in his Gltarthasamgraha [GAS] ad VIII6 (where it is termed a iruti) and ad VIII14, as well as in TA XXVIII 312.46 The same verse will be repeated verbatim by Abhinavagupta in his Paramdrthasara, as its verse 83. And when Vamadeva, probably a disciple of Yogaraja,47 quotes it (p. 21), he attributes it to 4bhagavan bhogipatih\\ 48 the ‘Lord of the serpents’, that is, presumably, Adisesa.Similarly, the older Paramdrthasara was well known in circles that practiced a syncretistic version of Saivism and Vaisnavism. Thus, the Span- dapradipika [SpP], a commentary on the Spandakarika [SpK], the founda­tional text of the Spanda school, cites verse 66 (which has no direct cor­respondent in the Saiva Paramdrthasara) .49 The Spandapradipikd, a work of Utpalavaisnava (also known as Utpalacarya, Bhagavata Utpala,50 ninth -tenth century), testifies to the same spirit of syncretism as does the Ci- cchaktisamstuti of Yoginatha (probably same period),51 a Sakta who was familiar with the Spanda, and who as well cites Adisesa’s verse 33 for its evocation of the maya of Visnu.52Before this, the Paramdrthasara of Adisesa was authoritative for Sam- khya, as evidenced by the citation of its verse 83 in the YuktidTpika, a work composed sometime between the sixth and ninth centuries, of unknown authorship, but probably of Samkhya affiliation. This verse, which the Yuktidipikd attributes to the ‘tradition’ (amnaya), is cited in support of its interpretation of SK 2, according to which interpretation ‘liberation is ob­tained by knowledge* (jhdnan moksah) — the knowledge, that is, whereby purusa is discriminated from prakfti: ‘Just as a man falls to the ground from the top of a tree involuntarily, once he has lost his foothold, sim­ilarly, someone who knows the Qualities and the Soul (purusa) becomes “separate” (iceva/a), even involuntarily’. 53Even Advaitins make use of the first Paramdrthasara.

And numerous are the Indianists who take the Paramdrthasara of AdiSesa to be a possible source for the Agamaiastra of Gaudapada, the chef-d’oeuvre of pre-£arikara Advaita.55In addition, the Candrika (sixteenth century) on the Prabodhacandro- daya (ad V, v. 33) cites APS 18, ascribing the verse to £esa (yathoktam bhagavata ¿esena).56 Finally, in the eighteenth, the famous grammarian Nagesabhatta cites it several times in his Vaiydkaranasiddhantalaghuman- jusa, while discussing the status of error.57The first Paramdrthasara has thus enjoyed a long and significant des­tiny, of which the most striking indication is no doubt its having been rewritten by a philosopher of another persuasion.1.2.2.2. DIVERGENCES/CONVERGENCES The identification of Abhinavagupta, the ‘new £esa’, with the author of the first Paramdrthasara is just the emblem, the mythical clothing, of a more profound affinity.After all, nondual Saivism of Kashmir, which Abhinavagupta has brought to its finished state, aims, just as did the work of Adisesa, at the integration of two points of view seemingly incompatible: realistic dual­ism — that of the Samkhya, from which it borrows the hierarchy o f ‘prin­ciples’ (tattva) — and idealistic nondualism, of which it retains the core notion of the ‘world as appearance’. Even if the modalities of realization are different, the principle of integration is the same in both projects.But, just as evidently, the fact that the two doctrines are analogous does not make them strictly commensurable. For the version of Kashmir Saivism that eventuates in the Trika is a system of thought of considerable scope and coherence, lacking common measure with the relatively impov­erished system of the older Paramdrthasara — which, as we said before, has not given rise to a discrete tradition.Above all, the Trika, to which the Paramdrthasara of Abhinavagupta is intended to serve as introduction, is a Saiva doctrine, whose greater purpose is that of synthesizing the older currents of Saivism itself.

Let me mention only a few most worthy of note. For the text of Adisesa has already forged a number of concepts that will become integral to the Trika.sarvatmanIn the first place, the notion of sarvatmany the universal Self, inherited from the upani$ads, is fundamental to the doctrine of Adisesa. And though the Trika describes itself using terms other than sarvdtmavada, the idea of sarvatman is nevertheless at the heart of its doctrine — as the principle ex­plaining the double status of the Self, serving also as divinity: both imma­nent and transcendent. And so Ksemaraja teaches, in his auto-commentary to Pratyabhijnahrdaya [PH] (v. 8), that the notion of the double status of the Self is the criterion of excellence that places the Trika above all the other systems, even those of the Tantrikas and Kaulas.59Numerous are the occurrences of the notion of sarvatman in the Saiva Paramdrthasara. Here are just two examples: verse 73, which serves to define the jlvanmukta, and whose first hemistich implies the notion of sar- vatman: *There is nothing at all separate from the [knower of the Self] to be honored with an oblation or to be praised; would then he, who is liberated, who has no use for homages or ritual formulae, be satisfied with hymns of praise, etc.?’; 60 and verse 82, which repeats almost verbatim verse 80 of the first Paramdrthasara: ‘He who knows the Self of all, thus described — [source of] supreme and incomparable bliss, omnipresent, utterly devoid of diversity — becomes one with that S e lf.61^ N o te the recurrent reference in these texts to the notion of rahasya, ‘secret*.59K$emariija cites from an Agama: vidvottirnam dtmatattvam id tdntrikah/ vidvamayam id kulddyamnayanivistah/ vidvottirnam vidvamayam ca id trikadidardanavidah/ , ‘The Tantrikas maintain that the dtman principle transcends the universe. Those who are followers of the Kula tradition, etc., consider the dtman principle as immanent in [or ‘constitutive o f] the universe. The Knowers of the Trika system, etc., consider it as both transcendent and im­m anent’ (Pratyabhijndhfdayavptd [PHvf] 8). Similarly, YR ad 82 explains: ‘He is the “Self of all” (sarvatman), the Self of all that cognizes and is cognized; or [taking the compound as a bahuvrihi] he is that whose Self is [composed of] the entirety of knowers and things known; in other words, he is both the transcendent and the immanent*.60 PS 73: stutyam vd hotavyam ndsti vyatiriktam asya kimcana ca/ stotrddina sa tusyen muktas tannimamaskfdva^atkah//.61 PS 82: vydpinam abhihitam ittham sarvdtmdnam vidhutandndtvam/ nirupamaparamanan- dam yo vetti sa tanmayo bhavad/ / ; cf.

See also YR ad 69, which discusses the double meaning of sarvabhutdtman."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"1. THE TWO PARAMARTHASARA13kridaAnother point of convergence is supplied by the notion o f ‘play* (krida), which serves to explain, in the first Paramdrthasara, the double move­ment of phenomenal manifestation — away from, and return to, the One that is both immanent and transcendent, both extroverted and introverted: ‘Having displayed himself, like a mirage, employing the infinite varieties of breath [and the other principles], Vasudeva withdraws again [all into himself] through his own power, as if playing*.62 Here the idea o f ‘play* is associated with the notion of svavibhuti, which anticipates the saivite notion of svatantrya, ‘freedom* or ‘independence*. Note also that Raghava- nanda glosses svavibhutya, ‘by one’s own sovereignty*, as svatantryasaktya mayaya, ‘by virtue of may a, the energy of freedom* — saivite terminology indeed, and which does take the reader aback coming from an Advaitin! Nevertheless, though the theme o f ‘divine play* is common to £aivism and to Advaita (even pre-Sankaran), it should be noted that Advaitins privilege the term ZiZd, whereas Saivas prefer krida, as does AdiSesa.63sakrdvibhata atmaEqually remarkable is the presence of a phrase in Adisesa’s text destined to find its place in the treasury of Saivite maxims: sakrd vibha- tab, ‘having appeared once [and for all]*: ‘The Self is devoid of all con­cepts, pure, [always and forever] waked, unageing, immortal, calm, spot­less, having appeared once [and forever], spiritual, [and] pervasive, like space*.64This very verse finds a parallel in the second Paramdrthasara, in refer­ence to its verses 10 and 11, which attempt as well a definition of the Self. Yogaraja, after explaining that the compound ‘devoid of dissolution and creation* (layodayavihinam) means ‘eternal* (sanatanam), goes on to cite the formula sakrd vibhato yam atma, ‘The Self appears once and for all*.62APS 30: pranadyanantabhedair dimdnam samvitatya jalam iva/ samharati vasudevah sva- vibhutya kridamdna iv a // (translation is mine; cf. Danielson: 'After having extended himself through infinite varieties, viz., breath, etc., like [a feat of] magic, Vasudeva [= Vi$nu], by his own sovereignty, reabsorbs [everything] as if playing’). R reads akridamana iva.63In the Brahmasutra [BS] ( I I 1,33), creation itself is free play {lila): lokavattulilakaivalyam, ‘But [Brahman’s creative activity] is mere sport, such as we see in ordinary life’ (tr. Thibaut). One should distinguish this theory from the teleological theory according to which the Lord creates in order to play; Sankara in his Bhd$ya [BSBh] II 1, 33 observes: ‘Analogously, the activity of the Lord also may be supposed to be mere sport, proceeding from his own nature, without reference to any purpose’ (tr. Thibaut, who adds in note: ‘The nature (svabhava) of the Lord is, the commentators say, M5y§ joined with time and karmari). This is equally the view of AS I 9. R ad APS 30, while commenting on the word he reads as dkridamdna, cites as well BS II 1, 33. And he adds: svdrdjyasamfddhimanto narendra yatha svavibhutya kridand tadvad atmandtmany eva vihartukama iva, ‘Just as princes whose dominion is complete [continue to] play [at being kings] by exercising their majesty, so also [does Vi?nu], for he loves to sport, in and by him self.64 APS 25: sarvavikalpanahinah iuddho buddho ’jaramarah idntah/ amalah sakfd vibhdtad cetana dtmd khavad vyapi/ / (tr.

Its origin is perhaps to be found also in the upanisads, as for instance, in ChU VIII 4 ,1 -2 , where the ‘world of brahman* is qualified as sakrdvibhâtah. As far as the ontological implication of the formula is concerned, namely that this Self‘once and for all appearing* is the source of the appearance of all other things, is the ‘unique Real*, Râghavànanda, while commenting on Âdtéesa’s verse 25, recalls that the formula is already alluded to in Mundakopanisad [MuU] II 2,11: ‘Every thing shines only af­ter that shining light. His shining illumines all this world*.65 Such an idea is also present in one of the leitmotifs of the Trika, the formula nâprakâiah prakâsate, ‘That which is not luminous cannot manifest itse lf,66 with its complex network of implications.In a saivite perspective, the epithet sakrdvibhâtah in effect establishes not only the etemality of the Self, but the contemporaneity of the Selfs revelation and the advent of liberation — and as well that the experience itself is perennial. This is the truth, when apprehended, that “astounds** like a flash of lightning (the root sphur) — the sudden and simultaneous realization both of the Self and of one*s liberation; on it is grounded the otherwise paradoxical idea of liberation in this life (jïvanmukti). For if the experience of the Self takes place in this life, the same must be said of liber­ation, whose realization is thereupon dependent. Such is the Traika usage of the old epithet applying to the Self, sakrdvibhâtah — a usage that the second Paramârthasâra illustrates: ‘Similarly, the [knower*s] own essen­tial Self remains in the condition it was in when it became manifest once and for all at the moment knowledge was acquired; it does not become otherwise when the body falls away*.67Liberation through gnosis The principle of ‘liberation through gnosis* appears as the first correl­ative of the doctrine of sarvâtmavâda: to know that all is the Self is to be instantaneously liberated. Several verses of the two Paramârthasâra propound this principle.68 Two are particularly worthy of attention — if only for the way in which the second Paramârthasâra borrows from the first. Àdisesa*s verse 73 reads: ‘There is neither any place for Release, nor [does Release consist in] going elsewhere. Breaking the fetter which consists of ignorance: that is what one knows as Release*.69 It is taken up65ChU VIII 4, 1-2 is quoted n. 455.

THE TWO PARAMARTHASARA15by verse 60 of Abhinavagupta’s Paramdrthasdra, whose first hemistich is identical, but which shows ¿aivite modifications in the second: ‘Neither has liberation any abode, nor does it involve a going elsewhere. Libera­tion is the manifestation of one’s own energies realized by cutting the knot of ignorance’. 70Similarly, Adi§esa’s verse 8 1 71 is repeated verbatim as verse 83 of Abhi- navagupta’s work — constituting one of the rare cases of word-for-word citation in the second Paramdrthasdra: ‘Whether he gives up his body in a place of pilgrimage or in the hut of an outcaste, be he conscious or not, he goes [thence] to a condition of transcendent Isolation, his grieving at an end, for he was liberated at the very moment he acquired knowledge’. 72There is no better example of the affinity of the two texts, inasmuch as, prompted, almost fortuitously, by the epithet nastasmftih, the later Para- marthasara introduces another point of convergence: once acquired in this life, the fact of liberation cannot be abolished, even by the mindlessness and disorder of the final agony. Verse 81 of the initial Paramdrthasara just alludes to that question, which, as is well known, is much debated in Indian speculation. But the Saiva Paramdrthasdra, in the person of Abhi- navagupta, develops the issue at length, over several verses, followed by Yogaraja who proceeds even to reinterpret in a Saivite sense several par­allel passages of the Bhagavadgtta. 73Meditative realization (bhdvana)The means whereby one accedes to that final knowledge of the Self (or of brahman), according to the first Paramdrthasara, is ‘meditation’ (5/ia- vana), or rather, as we have translated the term as it occurs in the second Paramdrthasdra, ‘meditative realization’. This is also the means privileged by the Saiva Paramdrthasdra, to the extent that it is this means that prevails in the iaktopaya, the ‘way of energy’ — of the four ‘ways’ the one whose perspective is chiefly adopted by Abhinavagupta in his Paramdrthasdra. 74 Indeed, the notion is found as well in other doctrines (though sometimes in another context, or with different implication or significance),75 but its understanding is here direcdy inherited from the older text.The first Paramdrthasdra devotes, in effect, three verses to bhavana: ‘After one has discarded Illusion, which, being delusive, has the nature of fallacy [in that it produces] the idea of plurality, let him realize Brahman,which is without plurality, being both with and without parts.

If in that way, the sum total of plurality has receded into the state of Brahman by meditation {bhávaná), no delusion, no sorrow [remains] for him, as he looks on everything as Brahman'.76After an encomium of bhávaná (v. 41), the second Paramárthasára con­denses in a single verse (v. 51) the teaching of its predecessor's verses 57-58: ‘Thus, once the postulation of duality has ceased, [the adept] after overcoming the bewildering power of illusion, should merge in brahman as milk merges in milk, and water in w ater',77 and in concatenation repro­duces verse 59 of the first Paramárthasára, verbally modified to suit šaivite metaphysics: ‘Thus, once the host of principles has been reintegrated into Siva through meditative realization, what sorrow is there, what delusion for him who views everything as brahman?’78For its part, the first Paramárthasára returns (v. 64) to the notion of bhávaná, in the guise of the causative verb bhávayati, which it associates with the idea of liberation (paramesvaribhutah, ‘he becomes the Supreme Lord').79 And, in verse 66, the term itself, though not mentioned as such, is ably etymologized as follows: ‘By whichever appearance the Lord, who has all forms, is meditated upon, that appearance he adopts, as he is like a jewel [fulfilling all] wishes'.80Similarly, at verse 68, the second Paramárthasára associates again this notion with that of liberation: ‘Thus awakened by the winds of his med­itative realization, as he pours an oblation of all his thought constructs into the blazing Fire of the Self, he becomes Fire itse lf.81 And we note that the metaphor ‘winds of meditative realization', which serves as ma­76ÁPS 57-59: evarp dvaitavikalpaip brahmasvarúpám vimohaním m áyám / utsjjya sa~ kalaniskalam advaitam bhávayed brahma// yadvat salile salilam ksire kslram samlrane váyuh/ tadvad brahmani vimale bhávanayá tanmayatvam upáyati// ittharp dvaitasam uhe bhávanayá brahmabhuyam upayáte/ ko mohah kah šokah sarvaip brahm ávalokayatah//-77PS 51: ittharp dva/mvikalpe galite pravilaňghya mohanlip m áyám / salile salilam k$Tre kslram iva brahmani layi syát//.78PS 52: ittharp řařřvasamúhe bhávanayá ítVamayatvam abhiyáte/ kah šokah ko mohah sarvaip brahm ávalokayatah//.

THE TWO PARAMARTHASARA17trix to the extended metaphor of the verse, may well be a reemployment of a segment of Adisesa’s verse 58, not otherwise utilized, [...] samirane vayuh, ‘As [...] wind becomes one with wind’ — verse 51 of the Saiva Pa- ramdrthasara having retained, in its exercise of transposition, only the two initial images: water and milk.The £aiva Paramdrthasdra thus puts equal emphasis on the idea of bha- vanat but with the difference that the notion is there placed among prac­tices of an agamic yoga, in which the Trika sets great store. Associated with mantric practice, with kundalinl yoga and with the practice of the mu- draSy bhavana is the spiritual exercise par excellence, thanks to which the mumuksu accedes simultaneously to knowledge and to liberation, while he yet lives.82jivanmukti‘Liberation in this life* is indeed the common project of the two Pa- ramarthasaray even though the second reserves to it a more explicit treat­ment. It provides also, doubtless, the first among the motives for rewriting the text itself. The £aiva Paramdrthasdra transposes the Paramdrthasdra of Adisesa precisely because it has apprehended there the foundation for the doctrine of jivanmukti. It is a jivanmukti that does not speak its name clearly in the first Paramdrthasaray but which is there recognized by many indications, when viewed in the light of later developments, once the de­bate provoked by the oxymoron of the term itself (‘jivan* while living / ‘mukti* liberation [from this life]) finally subsided, conferring on the notion its general legitimacy. Raghavananda, the Advaitin exegete mentioned earlier, makes no mistake when, in his commentary on verse 3, he presents Adisesa as a jlvanmukta. 83The entire labor of Abhinavagupta and Yogaraja is aimed at bringing to light that very truth: the ‘liberation’ that is at issue in the older Para­mdrthasdra is already the ‘liberation in this life’ that Abhinavagupta makes into the issue of the second. In this sense, the saivite transposition is also an exegetical project. Underscoring the soteriological vocation of the first Paramdrthasaray the transposition reveals in addition that the soteriology, based doubly on Samkhya and Advaita, establishes the notion of jivan­mukti.Thus the Paramdrthasdra of Abhinavagupta makes the text of Adisesa into a treatise on liberation in this life. The best proof that may be given of this is that the stanzas of Adisesa’s work cited in later literature — with82See YR ad 9, 61, 62, 64-66, 83, 86, 96.83APSV 3: [...] Qtmatattvas&kfdd bodhavaniam jlvanmukiam guruvaram yathavidhy upagam• ya baddhanjalih papraccheti, '[...] having approached in a proper way and with a gesture of salutation the most excellent teacher [Adi£e$a], who is liberated while still living and who possesses an intuitive grasp of the reality of the Self [or 'and who possesses an evident mastery of the reality of the Self], he asks"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"18INTRODUCTIONthe possible exception of Nagesa’s grammatical reference — concern more or less the idea of jivanmukti. Two among them (especially 81, the most famously cited in any case) are part of the demonstration of jivanmukti propounded by the Jlvanmuktiviveka; moreover, the quasi-totality of the second Paramdrthasara's borrowings from the first concern liberation — and that means, as the commentary incessantly attempts to show, ‘libera­tion in this life’.Even if the term ‘jivanmukti* appears no more often in the second Para- marthasara than it does in the first, it is possible to read it there in outline, twice, by the bias of periphrases where the concessive ‘api* points to and resolves in one gesture the oxymoron that the notion represents. Thus, at verse 61: ‘He who has cut the knot of ignorance, whose doubts have vanished, who has put aside error, whose merits and demerits have been destroyed, is liberated, though still joined with his body*,84 and at verse 86: ‘In the same manner, consciousness, once it has been separated from the complex of sheaths [that is the body, etc.], is [forever] completely alien to their touch, even though, as a liberated Self, it remains there [for a time] due to root impressions [previously accumulated]’. 85Moreover, in comparing the strategies of composition of the two Para- marthasara, one notes that, beginning with verse 76 of the first ( = verse 69 of the second), the textual parallelism grows more obvious, the corres­pondences are more patent, and succeed one another in a rhythm that cannot be ignored. Whole sequences of verses are repeated verbatim or almost so, in many cases.86 One observes also that verse 75 of the first Paramdrthasaray strongly colored with Samkhya and not as such taken up by Abhinavagupta, itself clearly postulates the notion of jivanmukti, via a periphrasis, and as such introduces the long concatenation of symmetrical verses in the two texts: ‘As soon as the Soul has understood Matter as dif­ferent [from itself], it becomes, [even though it still] exists in the midst of Transmigration, free from all acts, as a lotus leaf [is free] from the water [in which grows the lotus plant]*.87The first Paramdrthasdra even takes up the matter of obstacles to lib­eration as represented by the notion of the yogabhrasta, the acolyte ‘fallen from discipline* (w . 84-85). Thus going out of its way, the text promises even to such as he access to the liberation that had been to him for so long a time denied (v. 86).This is, in its way, also a manner of establishing the legitimacy of the84 PS 61: bhinnajnanagranthir gatasamdehah pardkftabhrantih/ prakfinapunyapdpo vigra- hayoge ’py asau m u k ta h // (the words at issue are in roman).85 PS 86: tadvat kancukapatatlprthakkptd samvid atra samskarat/ tistbaty api muktatmd tatsparlavivarjita bhavati//.^C om pare APS 76-78 and PS 69-71; APS 79-82 and PS 81-84.87APS 75: buddhva vibhaktam prakftirp puru^ah saipsaramadhyago b h av ati/ nirmuktah sar- vakarmabhir ambujapaltram yathd scdilaih//."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"2. THE PARAMARTHASARA OF ABHINA VAGUPTA19notion — that of envisaging equally all the obstacles that might be alleged to interfere between the mumuksu and his liberation. And so a “rhetoric of solicitude” is put in place that Abhinavagupta also makes use of — his verses 100-101 repeating almost verbatim Adisesa’s verses 84-85, while his verse 102 transposes Adisesa’s 86, the principal difference being es- chewal of any reference to Visnu. And finally, this last point of conver­gence: the theistic dimension of the two doctrines, so evident that it often suffices, in the exercise of transposition, to replace references to Visnu with those corresponding to Siva.881.2.2.3. DESTINY OF THE SECOND PARAMARTHASARA In the same way most modem accounts take little note of the contribution of Saivism to the issue of liberation — liberation in this life or not — likewise later Indian tradition, notably inspired by Vedanta, is careful to avoid Saiva reasonings. Perhaps, for the orthodox, it is due to the reticence aroused by suspicion of tantric leanings.89When the Jivanmuktmveka invokes, in the fourteenth century, the au­thority of the Paramdrthasara, it is the first Paramdrthasara that its author has in mind, though the Paramdrthasara of Abhinavagupta contains the same verse, hardly modified: later tradition, it is true — Abhinavagupta included — accords to the first Paramdrthasara the status of sruti.I have found references to the Paramdrthasara of Abhinavagupta only in works of saivite tendency: the TAV ad I 3 7 ,1 39-40, and IX 50, as well as the Parimala [PM] ad Maharthamanjan [MM] 25 (probably thirteenth century),90 which cite, respectively, w . 15-16a, w . 16b-17, v. 14 and v. 26. Note as well that, when Abhinavagupta cites APS 81 in his TA XXVIII 312, and explains it in the following verses, it is as though he were using his treatment of Adisesa’s work in order to comment, though allusively, on his own PS 83.And so the destiny of Abhinavagupta’s Paramdrthasara has been limited to Saiva circles.2. The Paramdrthasara of Abhinavagupta2.1. The text and its commentatorYogaraja describes as a prakarana the text he is commenting on. Though the text of Abhinavagupta does conform to the strictures of the genre in“ This is not the place to pursue the discussion of the elder Paramarthasdra and its relation- ship to the younger.

At least, it is how the system perceives itself: Thus, the supremely recondite core of the teaching (sástrasáram atigHdham) has now been condensed in one hundred arya-verses by me, Abhinavagupta, illu­mined [viz., inspired] by remembrance of Siva*s feet* (v. 105). Yogarája never fails to expand upon that ‘supremely recondite core of the teaching*, the spiritual realization of nondualism — which is the ultimate truth of the system — and the means or ways to attain it. He refers frequently to the ‘secret* (rahasya) that consists in the ‘knowledge of one’s own Self Csvátmajñánarahasya, w . 87-88), in other words, in recognizing that one’s own Self is not different from Maheávara (v. 81).91Even though he has not the breadth of Abhinavagupta, who commented on many of the key texts of the tradition, or of Jayaratha, who felt able to confront the monumental Tantráloka, Yogaraja is nevertheless a pro­found exegete, sometimes even audacious — despite what Lilian Silbum says.92 Not only is he sensitive to the subtle and ever reciprocal transi­tions in the text between the cosmic Self and the individual self, between Siva and the ‘knower* (jñánin), both of which appear in our text under the guise of the pronoun i* that verses 47-50 are at pains to represent, but he shows himself capable of decoding the double entendres. Thus he deciphers references to the articulation of the mantra SAUH throughout verses 41-46, and to the symbolic signification of its elements. As well, in his commentary on verse 104: idam abhinavaguptoditasamksepam dhya- yatah param brahma/ acirád eva sivatvam nijahfdayáveáam abhyeti, ‘To him who meditates on this transcendental brahman, as concisely expounded by Abhinavagupta, áivahood comes without delay, once it has pervaded his own heart* — the apparently straightforward authorial signature is91 See YR ad 14 (rahasyanaya), 75 (rahasyavid), 81 (rahasyam paramárthamahesvarákhyam ... upalabhya), 87-88 (svátmajñánarahasya)t 96 (svátmasambodhamukhámnáyarahasya) and 104 (parabrahmarahasyátiéaya).92‘Contrairement aux grands commentateurs de cette école philosophique, Yogarája n ’est qiTun simple exégéte qui ne posséde aucune originalité; c’est la raison pour laquelle nous ne donnons qu’un résumé de sa glose’ (Silbum PS: 20)."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"2. THE PARAMARTHASARA OF ABHINAVAGUPTA21reinterpreted metonymically,93 as a copulative compound (dvandva) of adjectives that qualify the term ‘brahman1: T o him who meditates on this transcendental brahman in reference to which a concise summary has now been stated, [such that brahman is now understood as both] quite novel (abhinava), and [heretofore] hidden (gupta), Sivahood comes without de­lay [...]’. Moreover, Yogaraja proves himself very accurate when he finds in the discussion of liberation of verse 60 a reference to the Trika denun­ciation of the practice of yogic suicide (utkranti), which is also condemned at greater length in the Tantraloka — though with some misgivings, as the practice was taught in the Mdlinlvijayottaratantra [MVT], the text that is otherwise considered authoritative in the Trika.94It is equally obvious that Yogaraja is familiar with the immense litera­ture of nondualist £aiva tradition, which he cites abundantly, and without much regard to tendency — which in effect establishes his au­thority to comment on the Paramdrthasara. Nevertheless, a predilection for a Krama-oriented exegesis is felt in his commentary, in the manner of his guru, Ksemaraja (1000-1050), who repeatedly concerns himself with the Krama doctrine, celebrated as the highest of all systems.95 Yogaraja himself was probably initiated into Krama, as may be inferred from an­other text ascribed to him, the recently discovered Sivastaka. 96 This hymn to Caitanyasiva, ‘Siva as consciousness’, is of Krama affiliation and justi­fies our recognizing, at various places in the Paramdrthasara, Yogaraja’s references as having a Krama coloration. For example, after referring to the Kalikdkrama in his gloss on PS 41, Yogaraja, ad 42, quotes the text of Kallata that Ksemaraja himself quotes in his vrtti ad PH 18 — a verse that is instrumental in defining saktivikasa, the ‘blossoming of energy’, also called bhairavimudrdy which, as the context shows, implies a reference to Krama practice.97 It is one example among many of Yogaraja’s hinting at esoteric aspects of the doctrine (‘esoteric’ being understood in its narrow, technical sense), expanding on the diversity of yogic practices where the base text merely alludes to them.Thus, within the apparent linearity of the Paramdrthasdra's philosoph­ical discourse, Yogaraja finds many occasions to bring out more or less93Trika literature abounds in such reinterpretations of the name ‘Abhinavagupta’.94See n. 1031. Note that AG also finds a veiled reference to that practice while commenting on BhG VIII 13-14.95See his Spandanirnaya [SpN] ad I 1 (Kaul ShastrT SpK: 6, 1. 5); his quotations of the Kdlikakrama in the ¿ivasutravimarfini [fcV]; his auto-commentary ad PH 15, where he rev­erently cites ‘the Kramasutras composed by ancient teachers in their own characteristic lan­guage’ (tad uktam purvagurubhih svabhdsdmayesu kramasutresu), and ad 19, in which he refers again to the Kramasutras, which he not only quotes, but explains at length, in dealing with the notion of kramamudra, or mudrdkrama; see also Sanderson 2007: 398ff.%See Sanderson 2007: 380, n. 483.^ S e e also, inter aliaf the reference to the notion of ‘great Void beyond the Void’ (ma* hdfunyatidunya), in YR ad 14 (n. 495)."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"22INTRODUCTIONcryptic references to the notion of supreme Speech, to the doctrine of phonemic emanation and the role of the mátrkás (w . 10-11), to mudrás (v. 42), to mantric practice (w . 41-46), to the placing of the thirty-six tattvas on the body of the guru and of the initiand (v. 74), and to the kundalim, 98 understood notably in its association with the articulation of the mantra HAMSAH (v. 78).However, the major contribution of Yogarája to the understanding of the text is his emphasis, beginning with the commentary on verse 9, on what he considers its core issue, jlvanmukti. He does adopt a style that is his own — conscious doubtless of the reticences and the disagreements surrounding the notion, he makes constant reference to the interior ex­perience of the yogin, of the jlvanmukta so incomprehensible to ordinary men. Of course, the framework is well known, both in the literature of Kashmir Saivism (and in the Paramárthasára itself; see v. 59), and in pan- Indian tradition, beginning with the upanisads — but Yogarája gives its exposition a particular twist. For instance, he accents his account with a series of phrases in the first-person singular, presumably to be attributed to the yogin himself, wherein the yogin formulates the content of his “in­communicable” realization.99Such are the originality and the lucidity of this commentary that it truly merits its appellation as a viyrti, an ‘elaborate explanation*.100It might be noted also that Yogarája could have figured in roles other than that of Ksemarája’s disciple, exegete of the Paramárthasára, and au­thor of the Sivástaka, if he is the Yogesvara or Yogesvarácárya that Vá- madeva, the author of the Janmamaranavicára, salutes as his master — thus furthering a preceptorial lineage or parampará. 101Thus read in the light of its commentary, the text of Abhinavagupta presents a remarkably exhaustive exposition of Trika doctrine, which Yo­garája attempts to position, as much within the vast saivite tradition as in the perspective of other Indian systems — sometimes in order to ap­propriate the others, as in the case of the Bhagavadgitá and the Mahábhá- rata, sometimes in order to achieve distance from them, as in the case of idealistic monisms of the Advaita or the Buddhist Vijñánaváda sort, and98Covertly ad PS 78, more explicitly ad PS 97, again ad PS 98-99, through one allusion.\"P h ra se s that 1 have thought interesting enough to collect in an ‘Anthology of spiritual experience’ (see p. 461), to which should be added the Mahamstuti” that constitute verses 47-50 of the PS itself; see p. 25, and p. 55.1 \" T h a n k s to this commentary, we have been able to make sense out of such puzzling pas­sages as kárikás 2 7 ,6 3 ,7 8 or 84-85, to cite only a few; see, for instance, the way YR discloses the ‘implication’ (íáfparya) of ká 63 (n. 1065).101 Such is the hypothesis of Shástri, in the preface to his edition of the Janmamaranavicára — an hypothesis that might be corroborated by a few additional indices: 1) the occurrence of the image of the water-wheel (araghatfaghafiyantra), in a similar context in both YR's com­mentary ad 47 and in the Janmamaranavicára: 18-19; 2) Vámadeva’s citation (pp. 20-21) of the same two verses that YR had quoted in his commentary ad 83."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"2.

It becomes, in the second, a doxo- graphy in miniature.Thus the Paramârthasâra of Abhinavagupta achieves a double goal: it rewrites an older text without compromising its own point of view, and it makes of itself both a doctrinal synthesis and a defense of jivanmukti. And it does this within the confines of a tight argument, the articulations of which Yogaraja is at pains to emphasize, taking particular note of the various implicit objections to which such or such a verse may be said to be a response.2.2. Structure of the textThe structure of the text is governed by a dialectic between bondage and liberation — a dialectic that is articulated in terms of instruction as to the means of abolishing bondage.V. 1: programmatic verse, in which Yogaraja, following a well- known procedure, alludes not only to the essential principles of the system, but also, if covertly, to what constitutes its major theme, and that of the Paramârthasâra itself: the notion of jivanmukti.Vv. 2-3: the myth of origin of the Paramârthasâra of Abhinava­gupta, structured in terms of the myth of origin of the Paramârthasâra of Àdisesa.Vv. 4-13: condensed exposé of the system’s nondualism: phenom­enal diversity understood as the manifestation of the Lord’s energies; successive and concentric manifestation of the four envelopes, or cosmic spheres (anda, v. 4), which comprehend the multiplicity of worlds and fi­nite creatures; reaffirmation of nondualism: the pasu is none other than Siva incarnate, who assumes as actor the infinity of roles in terms of which the theater of the world is characterized (5); series of examples (6-9, 12-13); doctrine o f ‘reflection’ (pratibimba; 12-13) and the related doctrine of ‘difference-and-non-difference’ (bhedâbheda). Yogaraja intro­duces (ad 9) for the first time the figure of the jivanmukta, which he reads allusively in the notion of grace there set forth. Vv. 10-11, proposing to define the Self (or supreme principle), anticipate the later definitions of the jivanmukta.102See p. 52.103In supposing that the interpretation of YR reflects the views of AG."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"24INTRODUCTIONVv. 14-22: exposé of the thirty-six ‘principles’ (tattva), ontological categories or principles constitutive of the ‘pure path’ and the ‘impure path’, that are graduated manifestation of the Self, itself designated in what follows as brahman, or as ‘supreme principle’ (paratattva), or as ‘Siva beyond [the principles]’ (paramasiva — Siva seen as the thirty-seventh principle). These principles, arranged progressively, explain the genesis of finitude — as they do in the prototypical Sâmkhya, which serves as basis for this and other Indian theories of “objectivity”. Allusions to the theme of error appear from v. 15 onward, where is introduced the notion of ‘fallacious creative power’ (mâyâ vimohinï).Vv. 23-27: characterization of finitude as a ‘sheath’, ‘constriction’, or ‘impurity’ — all realizations of error, and consequences of mâyâ; al­lusive reference to three of the four ‘envelopes/spheres’ (anda, 23), the three ‘impurities’ (mala, 24); the fundamental misapprehension of taking the Self for the non-Self, expression of ‘nescience’ (avidyâ), termed as well ‘ignorance’ (ajnâna) — in other words, Self-forgetfulness and the advent of subject-object dualism in the form of ‘dualizing thought’ (vikalpa, 25); nondualism reaffirmed (26); refutation of competing theories of the Self, all of which partake of error, though in different degrees (27, reprised in 32).Vv. 28-32: introduction of the theme of ‘all-powerful error’, de­scribed as the obfuscation of the truth (‘the darkness of error’, 30), the constriction of the immemorial and eternal freedom of the Self (32); a theme that is omnipresent, inasmuch as on the dissolution of that error depends liberation in this life — the major issue here treated. Traika innovation: notion of the sequentiality of the two errors, that of taking the Self for the non-Self being prior to and more fundamental than that of taking the non-Self for the Self (3 1 ).104 The two errors constitute the mithyâjnâna of PS 53, ‘false/apparent knowledge’. Similarly, ‘dualizing thought’ (vikalpa.), which includes all the false constructions of the rela­tion of Self and non-Self espoused by rival systems, is condemned as ‘false’ (mithyâ, 32).Vv. 33-38: reversibility of finitude and liberation, of which the freedom of the Lord is the explicative principle: Abhinavagupta’s introduc­tion of the theme o f ‘divine play’ (krîdâ), expression of the Lord’s sovereign freedom; beginning of the treatment of liberation, which is obtained by reversing the process that is instrumental in generating bondage; libera­tion prescribed in v. 33: ‘One should unveil his proper S e lf...’, to which one accedes, symmetrically, by unveiling, by purification, by reconquest or recognition o f ‘Self-knowledge’ (svajnâna); correspondence established between macrocosmic (creation, etc.) and microcosmic (the four states, waking, etc.) modes of the Self (34); justification of the apparent para­104 See n. 848, ad PS 39."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"2. THE PARAMARTHASARA OF ABHINAVAGUPTA25dox of a Self (or a brahman) both one and many (35); refutation of the objection that the Self is polluted by its particular realizations (36) and that the Self is compromised by the variety of its states of consciousness; refutation of the objection that the Self is subject to affectations: the “psy­chologization” of the Self being a mere matter of metaphor (38). Verse 38, which describes the Self‘as it is in reality* (paramarthatah), anticipates the descriptions of jivanmukti that follow.Vv. 39-40: eradication of the twofold error (bhrantidvaya, avat. ad 40) and the simultaneous advent of knowledge and liberation. The same freedom of the Supreme Lord — that is, one’s own Self (svatmamahesvara) — which has the power to subjugate has also the power to liberate (ad 39). The liberation that was prescribed in v. 33 is acquired in v. 40, with the necessary implication that it is a liberation acquired in this life: ‘In this way, when these twin delusions have been cut off, along with their roots, there is no penchant at all on the part of the supreme adept who has attained his goal to accomplish anything else*. Here we find, in Abhina- vagupta’s text, the first reference, even though veiled, to the jivanmukta, described as the ‘supreme adept* (parayogin). Yogaraja interprets v. 40 as implying a denunciation of external rites, preparing thus the way for an esoteric account of mantric practice (vv. 41-46) exemplifying the ‘interi- orized rite* (antarydga).Vv. 41-46: change of tone in the commentary that focuses on an esoteric and mystical interpretation of the philosophical concepts treated above (bhedabheda, etc.).105 The stress is put upon the means of simultane­ous access to both knowledge and liberation, by presenting, in terms that are ambiguous, a ‘discipline* (yoga) based on scriptural sources (agama) that is proper to the ‘way of energy* (sdktopaya), this latter also called the ‘way of knowledge* (jhanopaya) — the way of interiorizing ritual that is characterized by ‘meditative realization’ (bhavana) and mantric practice, notably that based on the mantra SAUH; description of the jivanmukta as a yogin embarked on the way of energy. Vv. 41-46 constitute thus an es­oteric parenthesis (or the beginning of such a parenthesis) in a discourse that is primarily philosophical — whose esoterism is recognized by its par­tial presentation and by the dissemination of occult teachings (YR ad 43, notably); symbolic correspondence between this section of the treatise — which describes the heart (hfdaya), that is, ‘energy*, as well as the ‘seed of the heart* (hrdayabija), that is, the mantra SAUH — and its place in the center of the treatise.Vv. 47-50: self-proclamation of the T as ultimate principle, on the model of the vedic ‘self-praise* (atmastud) . 106 The realization of the ab­105See n. 865.106I call it ahamstuti, ‘[self-]praise of the WI” \\ Note that the first appearances of the key notion of the absolute ‘I* are to be found in YR’s commentary ad 6 (see n. 369), with the con­"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"26INTRODUCTIONsolute T (aham), equally that of the yogin and that of the Lord, is char­acteristic of the ‘way of Sambhu' (iambhavopaya), defined, as well, as the ‘direct way* (saksadupaya) . 107 In consequence, the first-person pronoun expresses the ‘undeniable' (anapahavanlya, YR ad 47, 50) faculty of ex­perience (or consciousness) present in all beings. This T , the mode of affirmation of the ‘Great Lord that is the Self of each person' Csvatmamah- eivara), reduces all the other modes of valid knowing (including revealed texts, Agamas), to a position of externality and relativity (YR ad 5 0 ).108 This self-praise of the T ‘stamps the yogin in the way of 6ambhu', as is said in Tantraloka. 109 On another level of interpretation, it is not the m eta­physical principle of the T that is solely at issue here, but the mantra AHAM as well, which represents that principle symbolically. Vv. 47-50 would in that case constitute a follow-up to the esoteric parenthesis of w . 41-46, devoted to mantric practice and articulated in terms of the mantra SAUH. The mantra AHAM, defined elsewhere as the ‘supreme great mantra' (paramahamantra), source of all the other mantras' efficiency (vuya)f is thus in effect the counterpart, in the way of 6ambhu, of the mantra SAUH that pertains to the way of energy.Vv. 51-59: the esoteric parenthesis is brief. From v. 51 onwards, we return to a properly philosophical account. At the very moment that knowledge is acquired (v. 51, ‘after overcoming the bewildering rndya ...'), the yogin is liberated. He is henceforth a ‘knower' (jndniny YR ad 51 [first occurrence]). After this sketch of the yogin in majesty as the ‘master of the Wheel of energies' (v. 47), that is, of the yogin following the sambha- vopaya, we return to the depiction of the yogin in majesty according to the iaktopaya: the avataranika ad 51 places in the mouth of the yogin, at the moment of his awakening, the proclamation of IPK IV 12: ‘This might is all mine'. The portrait of the jivanmukta presented in w . 51-59 answers the implicit objection that the notion of ‘liberation while living' is incompatible with the karmic destiny that must be attributed to the yo­gin in virtue of his incarnate state. The response is that subjection to thecept of ahantacamatkara, and ad 8, with the concept of ahampratiti, the cognitive experience of the ‘first person* (see n. 397).107See TA 1 142.108Cf.

THE PARAMARTHASARA OF ABH1NAVAGUPTA27law of karman is the product of ‘faulty knowledge’. In consequence, the advent of ‘true knowledge’ suffices to free one from that law (53), with­out it being necessary to distinguish between acts dating from before the awakening and those posterior to it: in both cases, it is a question of de­taching the consequence from the act, seen not as a momentary event, but as the setting in motion of a long process eventuating in its proper fruit (in MTmamsaka terms, it is thus the apurva, generated by the act and linking it with its fruit, that “disappears”). For him who has been conse­crated ‘liberated while living* by his awakening, those fruits in process of maturation (prarabdhakarman) are consumed by the fire of awakening it­self (v. 55), while those set in motion after the awakening eventuate in no consequence, inasmuch as ‘awakening’ signifies the abolition of the desire for fruition (v. 56). The jnanin frees himself thus from all the modes of karmic realization (v. 58), the principal indicator and effect of which is his emancipation from all sorrow.V. 60: this initial portrait of the ‘knower* culminates in the Traika definition of liberation as ‘the manifestation of one’s own energies realized by cutting the knot of nescience’, in other words, as liberation while liv­ing — against a backdrop of “dualistic” definitions of liberation, rejected because they account only for liberation at death.Vv. 61-67: less allusive mention, in the karikas, of jlvanmukd — albeit via a periphrasis: ‘[...] he is liberated though still joined with his body’ (v. 61); sketch, in the commentary to 61, of a distinction between liberation in this life, jlvanmukti, and liberation at death, which later tra­ditions, among them post-Sankara Vedanta, will term videhamukti; reiter­ation of the principle underlying the notion of jivanmukti: it is access to knowledge, that is, the recognition of one’s own self as the universal Self (or the Lord, or Pure Consciousness), that sets aside the negative effects of the law of karman, together with the fatality of transmigration (61-62). Vv. 63-66 respond to this apparent paradox by contesting the necessity of any convergence between a mechanistic application of the law of karman and the so-called fatality of reincarnation. Such “fatality” applies only to the embodied soul laboring under the control of nescience, which obliges him to act in view of a fruit or result. As soon as his nescience dissipates and his identity with the universal Self is recognized, the ‘knower’ — in­carnate, as he is (at least in the eyes of others) — accedes to a state of ‘disincamation’ (adariratva), synonym of liberation110 — responses that are hardly more than common places used by the commentator to further his demonstration. As proof that the benefit of an act may not pertain to the agent, v. 67, borrowing from ordinary experience, proposes the gram­matical example of the verb yaj- ‘to sacrifice’, which, when inflected inU0Cf. BSBh I 1, 4: afariratvam mokfakhyam; See YR ad 63, 70, 72 (and n. 1062), 79-80 (and n. 1212)."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"28INTRODUCTIONthe middle voice (yajate), implies that the yajamana, the patron of the sac­rifice, is its beneficiary, but, when inflected in the active voice (yajati), implies that the ya/afca, the officiating priest, acts without acquiring that particular benefit which belongs to his patron. The yajaka thus becomes a metaphor for the man ‘liberated while living’.Vv. 68-73: exonerated henceforth from the corruption of his acts, the jlvanmukta can now be described in the light of the very acts that compose his daily life — indifferent to the injunctions and prohibitions that are the meat of the ordinary man, appearing to others not unlike a madman, wandering hither and yon, so deviant is he from the usual standard (71). His rituals of consecration are interior, metaphorical (68): the ‘knower’ makes oblation of his dualizing thoughts in the fire of his consciousness, fanned by the wind of meditative realization (bhavand) — the mention here of bhavand signals that the path taken by the ‘knower’, in this section of the Paramdrthasara, is that of ‘energy’. Regardless of the accidents that may affect his life and acts henceforth, the characteristic of the ‘knower’ is his purity (70), unalterable because innate.Vv. 74-80: description of the mystic practice of the ‘knower’ de­voted to the way of energy; metaphorical extensions of the inner-outer parallelism noted above: construction of the body as temple (devagr/ia, 74); one’s own self as the divinity (devata, 75); thought as oblation (ha- vana, 76); unshakable awareness of the Ultimate as his own meditation (dhyana, 77); contemplation of supreme ipseity as his silent (or whis­pered) recitation (japa, 78); surpassing of all duality as his vow (vrata, 79-80). The description of practice culminates with a characterization of the jlvanmukta as a Kapalika (79-80) — although his vow, qualified as ‘otherworldly’ (alaukika) by Yogaraja, goes well beyond that of the ordi­nary kapalika, whose practices are soiled by duality despite their terrifying rigor; pursuit of these images: the transmigratory world where abides the jlvanmukta is quite as terrifying as the burning-ground of the kapalika; the symbolic khatvahga of the latter, a staff surmounted by a skull, be­comes, literally, the body of the former, the kapalika's begging-bowl, in the form of a shard of skull, becomes the ‘shred’ of the knowable that sus­tains equally the jlvanmukta; the kapalika's liquor is the other’s ‘essence of the universe’. In sum, the jlvanmukta is ‘liberated’ because he is ex­empt from duality. Yogaraja concludes: ‘Such is the vow of him who has cultivated the lotus feet of a true teacher. Beyond that is nothing but the desiccation of the body’ — a comment that serves also to introduce a new motif (extensively developed in w . 89-102), that death does not interrupt or modify the fact of liberation.Vv. 81-88: new portrait of the jlvanmukta, again in quasi-philosoph- ical terms (81): the commentary borrowing from the Sdmkhyakdrika the famous image of the potter’s wheel (without however acknowledging the"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"2.

Here, the impulsion is the inertia provided by acts previously undertaken (prarabdhakarman), whose motion continues unrestrained: it explains why and how liberation occurs within this w orld;111 introduction of two new elements defining jivan- mukti (82): that the experience is blissful (that is, positively felicitous, not merely absent of sorrow), and that it is open to all, without ritual prerequi­sites — and therefore does not require the social ‘perfectioning’ (samskara) implied in the caste system. In his commentary to v. 83, Yogaraja sketches the distinction between liberation in this life and liberation at d eath ,112 and alludes to a theme that will be later developed (w . 90-95): the signifi­cance of the yogin’s final moments for his already acquired liberation. The vanity of injunctions and prohibitions is again noted (83-84). A new ob­jection is raised (avat ad 85-86), which, while admitting the simultaneity of ‘knowledge’ and liberation, denies the possibility of continuing to ‘live in a body’, for this is necessarily polluting — liberation being possible, in other words, only at the moment of death. In response, it is pointed out (85-86) that ‘enlightenment’ implies the disappearance of the three impurities that are responsible for the soul’s finitude and transmigration. The persistence of a body does not compromise in any way the liberated status of the jivanmukta — and his liberation is irreversible, established once and for all, according to the Saiva maxim: sakrd vibhato yam. A con­cession is made nevertheless to the adversary (YR ad 85-86): a gradation, or perhaps a sequencing, of two orders of liberation: liberation in this life, corresponding to the ‘Fourth state’ (turya), and liberation at death, corresponding to the ‘state beyond the Fourth’ (turyatxta) . 113Vv. 89-95: theme of the irreversibility of liberation developed in detail. A paradoxical argument justifies this irreversibility by appealing to the law of karman — the same law that, for the ordinary man, condemns him to the fatality of transmigration. One becomes, in effect, that which111 The notion of jivanmukti itself represents in all likelihood an effort to resolve the dilemma thus posed: how can “fruits” of action be abolished at the moment of awakening, and yet the motion imposed on the body during the period before awakening continue until the death of the body? To affirm both is in a sense to claim that certain acts or manners of acting have no result, nor do they propose any goal (see PS 67). The figure of the potter and his wheel seems to exclude another possible resolution of this dilemma — that seemingly adopted by the Gita and by Mahayana Buddhism — that the fruits of such acts can be conveyed to others, more w orthy or capable of receiving them, Kj§na, in the former case, a bodhisattva in the latter. A ‘god’ is indeed a convenient adjunction to any such system of thought.112i... in other words, after the destruction of his body, he attains a condition of Isolation Ckevalatd) that is beyond the Fourth state [of consciousness], composed solely of blissful consciousness [...]*.113‘This being the case, the [mind of the] knower of the Self (jnant), while living (Jivann eva), is formed by the Fourth; and he transcends even that Fourth, once his body no longer exists*."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"30INTRODUCTIONone has always been — whether he be a bound soul (pasu) or a ‘knower’ (jnanin). No intervening accident, no unexpected shock is sufficient to de­flect one from the destiny he has sought.114 Such is the teaching of v. 89, which on its face seems to concern only the bound soul; it is the commen­tary that supplies the missing link with this saivite interpretation of the law of karman. In virtue of this principle, the final agony of the ‘knower’, whatever disorder of mind or body may accompany it, does not bring into question his status as ‘liberated' (90-95). One reading of v. 91 suggests the possibility of comparing the opacity of the ‘knower's’ final moments to the condition of certain animals as they confront death (cf. the episode of gajendramoksa, for example, taken up by YR): the animal condition itself does not obstruct the state of liberation to which the animal may have been entitled.Vv. 96-97: jlvanmukd is now philosophically established. One ques­tion remains: why are some aspirants, though genuinely desirous of lib­eration, not accorded their release in this life? In other words, how does one account for “gradations\" or “degrees\" of liberation — and sometimes even failures? The response, even though it may appear not entirely sat­isfactory, makes appeal to ‘divine grace' in the form of a ‘descent of energy' Ciaktipdta): it is that ‘descent of energy' of the Supreme Lord, un­conditioned, unrestricted,115 and yet varied, that liberates. This apparent gradation of “descents\" is of course correlated with the abilities of the as­pirant, which notion would be difficult to see as anything but a restating of the question, rather than an “answer\". In fact, a shift in point of view is in course: at the end of the treatise, it is solely diva's perspective that is at issue — paramarthatah — in terms of which the perspective provided by the law of karman is merely instrumental, and ultimately to be cast aside, as mere vyavahara, inasmuch as it is valid for the embodied agent, who acts only by proxy; the sole real agent is Siva. The ‘descent of energy’ thus amounts to the acquisition (or ‘recognition') of a ‘freedom' that is one’s already — inasmuch as Siva is here conceived as ‘freedom’ itself. Given the degrees of grace, one cannot escape the idea that different degrees of effort are also called for — on the part of different aspirants — and so the text, in these final sections, shifts from an emphasis on the jnanin to one on the yogin, he who is engaged in a ‘discipline’ (yoga) leading to114*On the other hand, comments YR ad 89, when his body falls away, nothing at all befalls the man [viz., the jnanin] who has rehearsed no [acts engendering] latent dispositions; in­deed, with whatever intention the cognizer rehearses (abhyasyad) [his actions], he becomes one with that [intention], and at the moment of death the object that he desires with clar­ity comes into evidence for the cognizer.

THE PARAMARTHASARA OF ABHINAVAGUPTA31emancipation. If the echo of the Gita is clear, the term ‘yogin’ implies as well a reference to the £aiva system of upayas. A reading of w . 96-97 — without any reference to the commentary — finds there easily a descrip­tion of Jivanmukti and the three ‘ways* capable of leading to it. In 96 is described an aspirant who, benefiting from a grace that is ‘very intense’ (atitfvra), follows the ‘way of Sambhu’, the immediate or direct path to liberation, characterized through the analogy of copper changed alchemi- cally into gold by contact with mercury; such an aspirant accedes to final enlightenment, as it were, ‘effortlessly’ and in this life — the only media­tion required being that of the teacher. V. 97 envisages an aspirant who has devoted himself to the sequential practices of the ‘way of energy* (sa/e- topaya) — and probably, to the ‘way of the finite soul’ (anavopaya). The element that is common to w . 96-97 is their reference to a yogin who has or will have succeeded in his quest, who has acquired liberation in this life or will in the next.Vv. 98-102 are devoted to a lengthy exposition of the unsuccessful aspirant, the aspirant who has ‘fallen from discipline’ (yogabhrasta), typ­ically, by an unexpected death that has interrupted his practice — and who thus sees his liberation deferred. Vv. 98-99 promise to such a one a residence in ‘divine worlds’ and a rebirth that is guaranteed to produce a salutary result. Not only is no effort wasted, but his practice is taken up at just the point it was interrupted. Vv. 100-102 describe an aspirant even more imperfect, whose practice has utterly failed, who has, for in­stance, failed to grasp what has been clearly explained to him. After a sojourn lasting even longer in the divine worlds, he too is promised an ultimate liberation, but only after a subsequent death. The source of the notion of the yogabhrasta is doubtless the Gita (VI 37-49), as Yogaraja notes ad 102. The notion, strangely enough, is largely absent in other texts of nondual Saivism of Kashmir — with the single exception of TA XXXVII 65 (which uses the synonym yogacyuta while referring to Kjsna’s teaching apropos the yogabhrasta) and Tantralokaviveka ad loc., where the term yogabhrasta figures in a citation of those very verses (viz., BhG VI 41b-43, in vol. VIII: 3713). Why this Paramdrthasara's remarkable and quite detailed exception? In part, the answer must lie in the fact that Abhinavagupta’s Paramdrthasara is the rewriting of an extra-Saiva text, the Adisesa’s Paramdrthasara, of which the last verses (w . 84-86) have been reproduced quasi verbatim in Abhinavagupta’s verses 100-102 — preced­ing which, however, comes a preamble that refers, even though covertly, to the Traika notion of the three ‘ways’ (w . 96-97) and supplies a philo­sophical foundation for the notion of the yogabhrasta (w . 98-99). This brings into focus, perhaps, the strategy of rewriting at issue here, where sometimes fidelity and coherence must be reconciled somewhat loosely. This borrowing from the older text does serve Abhinavagupta, however, in"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"32INTRODUCTIONfacilitating his claim that liberation is universally accessible — witness the vibrant plea of Yogaraja in favor of the effort to obtain liberation (103).V. 103: This verse contains the “moral” to be derived from w . 96 -102, which is that of the entire treatise: every effort bears fruit, provided that it be sincere; liberation is certain, be it now or later. Neither must the aspirant fear presumption: not only is his effort promised success, but it is legitimate.Vv. 104-105: As expected at the end of a treatise like the Para- marthasara, v. 104 returns to the text itself and its author, and finds an additional reason to believe in the inevitability of liberation: it is even more certain now that it has been explained in the best of all possible treatises, namely, the Paramdrthasara of Abhinavagupta. V. 105 goes even further, celebrating the work for its concision, and the author for his au­thority, conferred by the unequalled splendor of his mystical realization, in which he is likened to none other than Mahesvara himself.2.3. Sketch of the doctrineOn the model of a doctrine that places in tandem servitude and eman­cipation, the text of the Paramdrthasara is constructed dialectically: to verse 24, which describes the installation of impurities, corresponds verse 57, which contemplates their abolition;116 to verses 4-5, which introduce the motif of the ‘sheaths’ or ‘envelopes’ (anda), whose unfurling causes finitude, correspond verses 41-46, which describe the manner in which mantric practice proceeds to their being stowed away; to verses 30-31, which set forth the notion of twofold error, correspond verses 39-40, which consecrate its eradication; verse 15, which defines maya, is re­flected in verse 51, which makes maya's dissipation the precondition of liberation.In effect, finitude and liberation are nothing but appearances, have no “reality” apart from worldly convention and linguistic usage.117 To the extent that Siva’s game brings them into play, they assume alternating roles, endlessly, in a world that has no other destiny than transmigration, subject only to Siva’s will: ‘Thus does the Supreme Siva extend [within116Theme taken up again at w . 85-88.117See YR ad 60: ‘In just this way, consciousness, [when] constricted by the limitations deriving from the conceit that locates the Self in the body, etc., is said to be “as if bound” Cbaddham iva); and similarly, once the bondage that consists of the conceit attributing to the body, etc., the capacity to cognize has come to an end through the manifestation of the knowledge of one’s own nature, that same [consciousness] is said to be “as if liberated” (muktam iva), [since now it is] fully deployed through the discrimination of its own energies [of independence, etc.] [...].

THE PARAMARTHASARA OF ABHINAVAGUPTA33our sphere] his play [made] wonderful by [the alternation of] bondage and liberation’. 118On the level of ultimate reality (paramarthatah), in contrast, there ex­ist neither servitude nor emancipation — just sovereign freedom, which is manifest in the play of the god, who is pleased sometimes to conceal himself, sometimes to reveal himself, rhythmically, in accordance with his two ‘energies’ (£akti)y that of obscuration (tirodhanafakti) and that of his grace or favor (anugrahatakti) . 119Everything, in this system of thought, extending even to notions and entities of little value, is a product of an ‘energy’ of the god. The doctrine is well suited then to the needs of the mumuksu, the acolyte aspiring to emancipation, for it accords him assurance that he will reach his goal: even in the sphere of finite interests, there is nothing set in stone, nothing irremediable — even finitude itself is finite.In this sense, emancipation is defined not so much as a motivated effort to undo bondage, as it is a positive recognition (pratyabhijna) that one is al­ready free — if anything, the paradoxical acquisition of a freedom that one has never lost. Although this paradox is, in some way, common to most Indian radical monisms, this school affirms in particular that the recogni­tion at issue takes the form of the ‘full deployment of one’s own energies’ (svatmadaktivikasvarata, YR ad v. 60). With the introduction of the notion of saktiy the Trika affirms both its doctrinal coherence (the other systems do not have recourse to such a notion in order to describe liberation) and its taste for paradox — a way to shore up a counterfactual view of the human condition. Liberation is freedom: in other words, there exists no liberation, but a freedom that plays at hiding itself.At the heart of the doctrine, as we have seen, is the notion of jivanmukti, ‘liberation [from life] while one yet lives’, the oxymoron par excellence — and scandalous as well for ordinary reasonable men, concerned, as all men should be, with executing their religious and ethical duties. The numerous objections to the notion point to that scandal, objections for the most part implicit in the texts themselves, but which the commentators delight in bringing out.The challenge that jivanmukti represents as well for the Paramartha- sara itself can be ascertained subliminally in the polysemy of the work’s title, where paramartha signifies not only ‘ultimate (parama) reality (or truth, artha)\\ but (as the commentary to v. 104 at the end of the treatise somewhat belatedly reveals) ‘the highest (parama) of the four goals (artha, scil., purusartha) of human life*, namely emancipation (moksa): ‘Now the author [Abhinavagupta] proceeds to sum up the purpose of the text, say­ing that “it alone is the teaching that serves as a means for realizing the118PS 33.n 9 See YR ad 60 and 69."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"34INTRODUCTIONhighest among the goals of human life.” *Likewise, in his commentary on the first verse, Yogaraja appears to descry a reference, albeit concealed, to jivanmukti in the name ‘Sambhu’, which he interprets etymologically as signifying ‘whose nature is unsur­passed felicity*120 — a not uncommon ploy, witness the similar readings of the name ‘Sankara* (cf. SpP 1, quoted below). He continues: ‘With this summary sentence, which teaches that the supreme state to be attained is absorption in [what is already] one*s own essence, the teacher has stated in abbreviated form the purport of the text in its entirety*.In this system, the only freedom to which one should aspire, is eman­cipation in this life121 — a notion that appears to follow from nondualism itself, if one understands by ‘emancipation* going beyond the contraries and reintegration within the One: there is no reason why a person, in this world, should not be as free as is Siva, for he is not-different from him, pro­vided that he undertakes the real labor of recognizing that tru th .122 The existential difficulty of becoming Siva may be read, in effect, between the lines of the doctrine of the four upayas — which doctrine includes, nev­ertheless, at least for a handful of individuals, either the possibility of the ‘non-means* (anupaya), that is, the absence of all existential difficulty in realizing one’s own identity with £iva; or that of the quasi-instantaneous ‘way of ¿ambhu*.Indeed, one has the sense that Kashmir Saivism is one of the first sys­tems to seek to justify doctrinally the notion of jivanmukti. As such, the treatment of the notion and its representation as a philosophical issue con­stitute in their own way major contributions to the development of Indian thought.The theme of abandoning karmic life is nearly as old as Indian civi­lization itself, and has given rise to a debate that is a persistent leitmotif of Indian intellectual history. The asperity of that debate might be due as much to a lingering suspicion that Brahmanism had already surrendered too much to Buddhist influence, as to the newly popular devotionalism and its reinvigorated sense of ritual, menaced by any abandoning of worldly life.The menace represented by the abandonment of karmic life had been first manifest in the late-vedic critique of the efficacity of the sacrifice itself (see, for instance, MuU I 2, 10-11). That critique was at least partially disarmed by the notion of the four stages of life (dsramad/iarma), relegating samnyasa to the end of life, well after the householder had fulfilled his120anuttaraJreyahsvabhava — or ‘[appropriation of] whose nature becomes [for the aspirant] the ultim ate goal*.121 See SpP 1 [ = ad 1 1, in the textual organization of SpN]: iha hi jivanmuktataiva mok$ah.1 ^C oncerning the conception of Jivanmukti in the Siddhanta, which is dualist at the time of the Kashmirian exegetes, see, especially, Brunner, Somaiambhupaddhati [SSP], vol.

In the same way, the ideal of liberation (moksa) was superadded to the three “normal” goals of human life, corresponding to this new “extra-human” condition.From a strictly philosophical point of view, the debates that are echoed in the Saiva texts on the degrees of liberation relate to a narrower issue, rather more technical in nature: can liberation — accepted by nearly everyone at the time — be reconciled with karmic life, or must one wait for the end of life in order to accede thereto? That is, is the notion of jlvanmukti defensible?Many scholars, Renou among them, have remarked on the Indian ge­nius for synthesis, reconciliation — a spirit that refuses to regard any con­tradiction as final. In this sense, the tension between the life of the hermit and worldly life is not a recent phenomenon, nor a fatality — and the notion of jlvanmukti offers once again the opportunity to palliate it. The dynamism of Indian intellectual history depends in large part on that di­alectic, where compromises have been numerous (and not all congenial to Western fashions of thought), such as the interiorization of complex ex­ternal rites, the Brahmanico-Buddhist amalgam, the notion of the ‘guru*, both “free” and socially engaged.The quarrel reflected in these Saiva texts is thus far from original, but is nevertheless felt as irremediably crucial.As far as the terms jlvanmukti/0mukta are concerned, most modem in­terpreters consider them as relatively recent. To date, they have been noticed in several Advaita or Advaita-like texts of the epoch, such as the Yogavasistha (also it seems from Kashmir, and presenting several Saiva traits), that some (including Dasgupta 1975, vol. II: 231) would attribute to the ninth century; and the Atmabodha, traditionally assigned to Sankara himself — though erroneously, according to the same authorities.123The terms figure as well in Saiva texts of the same period, as I will attempt to show, but their more certain dating should not hide the fact that the idea of jlvanmukti had long ago found its way into the conceptual apparatus of monists (of whatever stripe) — it is there in the Gita, 1 2 4 as well as in some older upanisads,125 and recognized as such by Sankara.1261230 n the notion of jlvanmukti in the dvaitaveddnta of Madhva (13th or 14th cent.), see R.

Prof. RaffaeleTorella has kindly referred me to the epic usage of jivanmuktat or rather jivan... muktah, to which Prof. Minoru Hara has devoted an article (1996). It is to be noted, however, that in the Epic the term does not occur as such, but rather as variations on a stock phrase, usually (in the MBh) in the neg­ative: na me jivan vimoksyase, ‘You will not escape from me alive’, a phrase which expresses only the hero’s determination not (na) to let his foe escape (muktah) alive (jivan) from the battle.

The context here is clearly n o tamuktT"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"36INTRODUCTIONEven its technical interpretation is there: are ‘free while alive’ those that “act” no more, but are obliged to live out their prârabdhakarman, because (as indicated by Sankara and others) a karman once set in motion is not easily annulled.Yet, the contribution of the vast šivaite literature to the debate on jlvan- mukti cannot be ignored, as has been mainly the case, not only by modem scholarship (at least beyond the field of Šaiva studies),127 but also by later Indian tradition. In effect, one can say without exaggeration that the Šaiva authors give us one of the first more or less complete accounts of an idea that had taken root for some time in Indian absolutist thought — although they do not deviate from the commonly received opinion as concerns the general character and importance of liberation itself, as shown by their constant references to prior discussions of this issue, and most notably to the Gïtâ,There is no doubt as to the soteriological orientation of the quasi­totality of developed Indian philosophical systems — be they monist or dualist, as the Sâmkhya — but the novelty of the Trika’s approach lies in its viewing, indeed reevaluating, muká in the light of its metaphysics, showing that, for instance, on the level of the absolute, there is no libera­tion, inasmuch as bondage exists only on the empirical level. A view with Màdhyamika overtones, it is true, but freed from the eristic and negative character of the latter — bondage itself being resolved in the absolute free­dom of the Self, a state of dynamic plenitude (among other names, Trika confers upon itself that of pûrnatâvâda) that suffices to define liberation as freedom itself. Thus, the Trika organizes under the heading of a ‘doctrine of freedom’ (svâtantryavâda) the elements of the immemorial dialog on the liberated man.Another important emphasis of the Trika, perhaps even an innovation, is, as I have already indicated, its privileging the acquisition of jïvanmukd, even to the point of denigrating the older notion o f ‘liberation at death’. 128Jayaratha, in his commentary on TÀ I 21— the concluding verse of the text’s introit — observes, in effect, that ‘the objective [of this treatise] is to confer emancipation in this life by recognizing the Self as such, by employing progressively such means as will be described in what follows’, and that this goal ‘although developed through the long sequence of verses that follow, is directly declared by the present verse (21), which begins(as it is later understood) but the very worldly issue of a kfatriya's humiliation. M. Hara is of course justified in raising the question of the relationship between the philosophical and epic variants of the locution Mjîvan m u k ta hit seems more appropriate, however, to see the two as distinct developments, different not only in context but in syntactic usage.127See Oberhammer 1994: 15, with reference to BhGBh VI 27: ‘Selon toute apparence, ce texte est la plus ancienne référence à la jïvarunuktih et peut-être le seul passage où Šaňkara emploie le terme technique de jïvanmukta\\128See Utpalavaiçnava’s exegesis, p. 41."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"2. THE PARAMARTHASARA OF ABHINAVAGUPTA37with “Šrišambhunátha” 129At the other extreme of the treatise, verses 32-33a of chapter XXXVII confirm: ‘This treatise [concerning the] Real, [wherein is declared] the essence of the Trika itself, is evidently to be taken up [and studied], pro­viding as it does without great effort the supreme benefit that is emanci­pation in this life, and arranged in such a way as to convey the highest satisfactions just as desired’. 130Jayaratha (ad TÁ XXXVII 32-33a) does not fail to stress the coher­ence of the treatise on which he comments, by relating these verses to those of the first chapter ‘Thus, [with the articulation of w . 32-33a of ch. XXXVII] the main purpose of the work is accomplished, which had been set forth in [vv. 284b-286a of ch. I]: “The sage who continually occupies himself with [this work] of thirty-seven chapters will become an incarnate Bhairava; since he whose knowledge has been completed in [study of] these thirty-seven will become Bhairava, why should one be surprised when even finite creatures, by contemplation of him, attain to the state of Bhairava?” *131 Recalling thus, in his commentary on verses 32-33 of the final chapter, the passage in the initial chapter where the jivanmukta is described, along with his vocation of helping others on the same path, Jayaratha reaffirms that the theme of emancipation in this life is the thread of Ariadne stringing together the entire text — and I might add, the entire doctrine.In effect, the key notions of the system — ‘grace* Cšaktipáta), the ‘means* o r ‘ways* of liberation (upáya)f the triad o f‘impurities* (mala), to cite only a few — enter into its soteriological project. We learn, for instance, from the Tantrálokďs treatment, and to a lesser extent, that of the Paramárthasára, that jivanmukti is accessible in the three inferior ‘ways’. Supporting this notion is the alchemical metaphor, which is one of the Trika’s favorite topoi.132 According to Yogaraja (ad 96) the process at work in attaining jivanmukti by the quasi-instantaneous ‘way of Sambhu* is similar to that involved in transmuting copper into gold by means of mercury — viz., the pašu into Siva by the ‘verbal transmission* (ámnáya) of Šaiva doctrine. By ámnáya is here meant, somewhat atypically, the direct audition of the doctrine, arguably once only, from the mouth of the teacher.

At the very beginning of his treatment, Abhinavagupta relies on the authority of various Agamas on the question of emancipation, and particularly on that of emancipation in this life — notably, the Rauravaf Svayambhuva, Matahga, etc. (I 4 6 ).133 The Nisatana is cited in TA I 50-51 as positing in unambiguous terms the distinction between liberation at death and liberation in this life.134 In these same verses one can also detect a sketch of the notions of pau- rusajhana and bauddhajhana, to which TA I 36ff. has just devoted a novel treatment: ‘He whose mind remains subject to dualizing thoughts becomes Siva after the dissolution of the body; but the other [who is not so subject] becomes [Siva] in this very life — such is the main teaching of the sastra [viz., the NiiatanaY. 135 In TA XIV 44b-45, Abhinavagupta alludes again to this passage of the Nisatana, which Jayaratha cites more elaborately, concluding: ‘Thus it has been demonstrated that liberation is only for the living whose mode of being lacks dualizing thought constructs; but, as for the rest, it will be when the body falls away*.136 Similarly, the passages TA IV 213-221 a and 259-270 rely on the Malinlvijayottaratantra, a supreme authority for the Trika, in order to develop their notion of jivanmukti as obtained via the ‘way of energy* — a ‘way* that implies the interiorization of ritual (MVT XVIII 74-82, TA IV 212).Again, reference is made, in the texts of this school, to other Tantras or Agamas, notably the Svacchandatantra [SvT], theMrtyunjit (or Netratantra) [NT], the Kularatnamala and the Kalikdkrama, profusely cited by the Siva- sutravimajiinl (see n. 881) and the Spandanirnaya [SpN], works of Kse- maraja, who as well commented on the Svacchandatantra and the Ne­tratantra. In some of these citations, the notion of jivanmukti is explicitly formulated, notably: SvT VII 259a (in SpN II 6-7): [...] jivann eva vimukto133In the context of treating pauru$ajhdna and bauddhajnana.

The last work is later than the fifth century Ad, as Sanderson 2006: 78 also shows. We can also affirm with a fair amount of certainty that all these texts, as well as all other known scriptural sources, postdate the early layers of the Nisvasa, which is probably the earliest of all known Tantras. Goodall and Isaacson (2007) have established 450-550 for the early NiSvasa, thus 550 is a very likely terminus post quem for most of our sources (675 being the terminus ante quem).The case of the Malinivijayottara is less straightforward, for Sadyo- jyotis’s references or allusions to it are not established beyond doubt.138 However, it is more likely than not that he indeed knew the Malinivija- yottara, whose date can be tentatively established before 675 (and after 550). The Svacchanda, which is often considered relatively la te ,139 may also come from this period (sixth-seventh century). For the Malinivijayot- tara knows and claims to be based on the Siddhayogesvarimata, whose short recension declares itself to be an abridged Svacchanda.140 Since the dating of the Malinivijayottara is itself problematic and the Siddhayogesvarimata survives only in its short recension, we are not on firm ground here. Never­theless, both the Siddhayogesvarimata and its near contemporary, the Brah- mayamala, of the Vidyapltha canon, are likely to have been composed in or around the seventh century for various other reasons.141 The Brahmaya- mala also includes transformations of the cult of Svacchandabhairava,142137I am grateful to Dr Judit Torzsok for detailed discussions on the subject.138See Torzsok Siddhayogesvarimata [SYMJ: 14 citing Sanderson.,39See Goodall: ‘Tentative sketch of a possible relative chronology of some early Tantric works and authors, principally of the Saivasiddhanta’, 14th World Sanskrit Conference, Kyoto, September 1-5, 2009.H0T6rzsok SYM: 16 and 262.141See especially Hatley 2007: 200ff., establishing the period of composition o f the Brah- mayamala from the 6th to the 8th c e n t142Hatley 2007: 223."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"40INTRODUCTIONwhich suggests again that the Svacchandatantra, the scripture of that cult, predates the Vidyapitha. As to the Netratantra, also referred to in the con­text of jivanmukti by Kashmirian exegetes, Sanderson has concluded from iconographical evidence that it was composed between Ad 700 and 850, probably toward the end of that period.143Concerning the Nisátana, the Kularatnamálá and the Kálikákrama, 144 the dating of these texts has been discussed much less extensively than the above mentioned titles. Given their Kaula and Krama affiliations, they are likely to be later than the above listed works of the Siddhánta and the Vidyapitha,145 possibly going back only to the eighth century or later. In any case, they must predate the Kashmirian exegetes of the tenth.This tentative dating of the relevant scriptural sources indicates that not only the idea, but also the very terms jivanmukti, jivanmuktay etc., were present at an early date in the Saiva tradition.The figure of the jivanmukta is also present in the more easily datable texts of the Spanda and the Pratyabhijňá, all of which were composed within the span of one century, between 875 and 9 7 5 .146It is only hinted at in the Šivasútra, particularly in the third section devoted (according to Ksemaraja’s exegesis) to the ánavopáya (III 9ff., Ill 18-45), and it is the text’s Vimarsini that develops the idea, either through citations (notably Kálikákrama, in ŠSV III 31; see supra), or directly, as in III 42, which describes the state of the jivanmukta. 147But the term itself is employed in the Spandakáriká (II 5 ) .148 Even bet­ter, jlvanmukti is the real subject of the treatise, as both the SpP and the SpN emphasize, and the jivanmukta is described in the manner of the sak- ticakrešvara, ‘Lord of the Wheel of energies’.

To be precise, SpP 30 attacks dualistic con­ceptions of emancipation, which recognize only emancipation at death, as well as practices such as utkrând that aim at achieving such a d eath .151As well, K$emaraja, in his explanation of the first and last verses, states that jïvanmukti is the goal of the Spandakârikà: ‘What is to be taught in this treatise is that absorption in the [Lord] has for its fruit liberation while living’ (ad I 1 );152 and commenting on the cakreévara of III 19, he observes: ‘Thus he becomes the Lord, that is, the Master, of the Wheel of energies described in the first sütra. In other words, he attains the supreme sovereignty in this very body’. 153Finally, the notion of jïvanmukti is at play in IPK IV 12-16, and partic­ularly in IV 12: ‘All this might is mine’, 154 and in the treatise’s conclusion (IV 16), which Utpaladeva’s vftti glosses: ‘He who by applying himself in­tensely to this enters into the nature of 3iva, becomes in this very life a liberated soul’. 155Utpalavaisnava’s sarcastic dismissal of the yogic notion of utkrânti (re­layed by YR ad 60) testifies also to the sharp debates that must have taken place on the question of jïvanmukti, not only in Saiva precincts, but also149According to the Kaula, the iaktis are not yogints, as is the case in the Vidyâpï{ha and in the Bhairava-tantras, but internal energies.

These debates proceed, in the first place, from the incredulity and skep­ticism that the notion arouses: given the iron law of karman, jivanmukti offends common sense. The jlvanmukta is a walking paradox. And thus does the Paramärthasära describe him as mad, a vagabond living a life of randomness — at least as the ordinary man sees him (w . 69,71). Both text and commentary are keen to stress that essential misunderstanding.156Perhaps, as I have already indicated, resistance to the idea of jivan­mukti is related as well to its implied evicting of dharma from the system of values, or at least to paying it only an optional respect: ‘Whether he performs a hundred thousand horse sacrifices, or kills a hundred thou­sand brahmins, he who knows ultimate reality is not affected by merits or demerits. He is stainless* (PS 7 0 ).157 The scandal would be greater had the Saivas not found a way to defuse it by relativizing their rejection of conduct universally admitted. Such could be one of the implications of the famous maxim describing the Saiva brahmin: ‘Kaula within, Saiva without, Vedic for worldly affairs — like the coconut, the essential is kept within*,158 which is also a way of recalling the esoteric dimension of the doctrine. In the same spirit of reconciliation, Yogaraja (ad PS 40) refers to the pan-brahmanical authority of the Yajnavalkyasmrti in order to distin­guish between ordinary and supreme dharma. Whereas ordinary dharma consists of sacrifice, good conduct, and the like, ‘the supreme dharma is to see the Self through discipline’ (Yäjnavalkyasmfti I 8). Thus is the jl­vanmukta justified in neglecting the lower dharma in pursuit of the higher one, that of his inner realization.Alone among the texts of the system, it seems, the Tanträloka develops, in the context of emancipation, the original doctrine of double-ignorance (136ff.): ‘spiritual* (paurusäjnäna) and ‘intellectual* (bauddhäjnäna) — and along with it its positive counterpart, the doctrine of double-awakening: ‘spiritual* (paurusajnana) and ‘intellectual* (bauddhajnäna). If the ratio­nale for these concepts is present in the Saiva Ägamas, the terminology, which presents overtones of the Sämkhya, seems to be a creation of the Tanträloka. It is in this doctrinal context that appears the definition of jivanmukti that figures as an epigraph to this introduction.159156See YR ad 83: ‘Moreover, by whom [else] can the last moment of the knower of the Self be directly experienced, apart from the witness (säksin) that is his own experience? — On the strength of which [witness] one might posit the existence in him of consciousness or its opposite, inasmuch as “those who see horizontally” [viz., fettered subjects] are not privy to any such realm of experience?

THE PARAMARTHASARA OF ABHINAVAGUPTA43The Paramdrthasdra refers not to these symmetric pairings. One may infer, however, from the citations that Jayaratha makes of w . 16b-17 of the Paramdrthasdra, in his commentary on the passages of the Tantraloka (ad I 39-40) that concern paurusajnana and bauddhajndna, that these pairs correspond in the Paramdrthasdra to the conjoined placement of finitude and double error. The paurusajnana corresponds to the anavamala, the im­purity of deeming oneself finite, that is, the wholly deceitful ‘atomization’ of universal consciousness — itself the product of maya (PS 15) — and to the constitution of the purusa, finite (or mundane) man (PS 16a); the bauddhajndna to the quintuple constriction of the kancukas (PS 16b-17).Still, the articulation of these notions in the Tantraloka, and the rigor with which they are argued, constitute a singular contribution to their understanding. When spiritual ignorance, the metaphysical ignorance proper to incarnate man consisting in mistaking the Self for the non-Self, is dissolved by initation (dflcsa), that is, by ritual, there subsists still an intellectual ignorance, marked by the unleashing of ‘dichotomous think­ing* (vikalpa). In consequence, spiritual ignorance by itself can be an in­strument of liberation only at death, when the body (and so the buddhi, locus of vikalpa) is no more. On the other hand, when intellectual ignor­ance, consisting in mistaking the non-Self for the Self, is abolished by the study of the treatises and practices that they teach, this does not suffice for attaining emancipation in this life, nor in the following. It is spiritual knowledge, accompanied by (or preceded by) intellectual knowledge, that is the instrument of liberation in this life. In any case, it is intellectual knowledge that is decisive for determining whether or not one reaches enlightenment in this life.160 By paurusajnana, in effect, the pasu-purusa is delivered in essence, but, existentially, continues under the domination of his ‘dualizing thoughts’.Apart from the fact that these arguments seal the alliance of ritual and gnosis, they confirm that jivanmukti is nothing else than the reconciliation of the plans of essence and existence.For its part, the Paramdrthasdra — at least as YR ad 85-86 reads it — introduces a correspondence unknown to the Tantraloka, which is es­tablished between the two kinds of liberation — seemingly “consecutive”: that obtained while living and that secured at death — and the two final ‘states of consciousness* (avastha), the ‘Fourth’ (turya) and ‘Trans-Fourth’160See TA I 45: dlk$api bauddhavijndnapurvd satyam vimocika/ tena tatrdpi bauddhasya jna- nasydsti pradhanatd// and TAV, avat. ad I 44: nanu yady evam diksayd dehdnta eva muktir bhavet, tat katham “jivann eva vimukto ’sau\" ityady uktam ity dSaiikydha/."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"44INTRODUCTION(turyatita) 161 — the latter appearing as a £aiva innovation.162 From the moment the ‘state of liberation* (moksa) found a home in life existential (jivanmukti), the insertion of the latter in the pan-Indian schema of the four states, and its designation there as the ‘fourth* obliged the promotion of the old ‘fourth’ — ‘liberation’ universally understood as ‘liberation at death’ — to a ‘fifth’, or rather to a ‘Trans-Fourth’, position in the hierar­chy of states having no name of its own, yet retaining something of its previous status.163As mentioned above, the term itself (jivanmukti, or jlvanmukta) makes some of its first appearances in tantric texts, whose aim was, among other things, to supersede the orthodox ritual system. As Sanderson (1995: 25ff. and 1988: 660ff.) shows, tantric doctrine and ritual attempted to demon­strate their superiority compared to orthopraxy in several ways, which included that tantrism presented itself as a more efficient means to the same end: on the whole, it proposed to liberate one through tantric initi­ation (even if liberation was not immediately fully effective). This meant that the average initiate could be considered liberated already in this life and did not need to make any particular effort for the attainment of moksa subsequently. Therefore it is not surprising that the term and the concept of jivanmukti were not unknown to the early tantric tradition.However, when nondualist Kashmirian exegetes make use of this no­tion, they tend to do so from the Kaula point of view, which is anti­ritualist. 164 Consequently, one is liberated in this world through inter­nal realization, and ultimately through knowledge, rather than through ritual action. The jlvanmukta is a jhanin. This kind of liberation in life was in turn seen by proponents of the orthodox brahmanical religion as a paradox, and it is on their behalf that avat. ad PS 85-86 asks the follow­ing question: ‘How can one continue to act after enlightenment, without accumulating further consequences of those acts? In effect, liberation is possible only at the moment of death*.The fact that tantrism proposed more efficient means of liberation did161A correspondence already sketched in ¿SV III 25 and &S in 41.

However tit may be added that], with the perishing of the body, complete (puma) liberation is attained*, and ad 83: ‘ “He goes to a condition of transcendent Isolation” (kaivalya) [viz., reaches ‘separation’ from the limited world of bondage] through knowledge of the Self alone; that is, in other words, after the destruction of his body, he attains a condition of Isolation that is beyond the Fourth state [of consciousness] (tuiydtitarupdip kevalaiam yati), composed solely of blissful consciousness’.162The term appears in some late upani$ads of tantric coloration.163See also YR ad 35.164See p. 51.

THE PARAMÀRTHASÀRA OF ABHINAVAGUPTA45not imply that arguments of the brahmanical orthodoxy were refused by Kashmirian exegetes. The Trika, as set forth by the Paramârthasâra and its commentary, employs a rather virtuoso strategy that uses the law of karman in order to subvert that same law. And so the last portion of our text, from v. 89 onwards, multiplies references to the properly MT- mâmsaka notion of apurva165 in arguments intended to establish not only the possibility of jïvanmukti, but its very legitimacy.In parallel, the Trika is not loath to invoke authorities (pramâna) out­side its own tradition,166 though, to be fair, its readings are usually favorable to its own theses. In the first place, the Bhagavadgûâ, whose omnipresence in Yogarâja’s commentary and in other texts of the system is perhaps intended chiefly to affirm how the this-worldly ascesis167 rec­ommended by the Gïtâ is, in fact, this-worldly liberation.Similarly, several indices furnished by the Paramârthasâra and its com­mentary permit apprehension of the relation of inheritance that Trika sus­tains with Sâmkhya on the question of liberation: the commentary to PS 81 (which paraphrases without attribution SK 67) and 83, where we find mention of the potter’s wheel; the reutilization of Sâmkhya notions of kaivalya (at v. 83, itself the reprise of APS 81) and of apavarga (YR ad 33); the important role assigned to the antahkarana in the process of liberation (YR ad 90-91, 92-93); the citation of SK 44 by YR ad 92-93.It is true that Sâmkhya and Trika start from the same postulate: liber­ation is not accessible by ritual (SK 1), but rather by discriminating know­ledge (vijnâna, SK 2). There comes to the surface, in the usage that the Paramârthasâra makes of these Sâmkhya notions, a Traika rereading of Sâmkhya doctrine according to which the notion of jïvanmukti, or at least a type of this-worldly release that has not yet received that name, is already germinating in the Sâmkhyakârikâ, in re w . 6 7 -6 8 .168 As such, the Trika proposes an interpretation of SK 67 that is not all that distant from that of Gaudapâda.169 The Gaudapâdïyabhâsya [GBh] on the Sâmkhyakârikâ, in effect, brings out the dynamic organization of the ensemble constituted by165See p. 29. Compare the transformation of the Mïmàmsaka notion of bhàvanà, ‘efficient force’ (PS 63) into the Traika notion of bhàvanà, 'meditative realization’ (PS 41, 52, 68).166For instance, the ¿aiva Àgamas, such as the Triéirobhairava (cited TÀ XXVIII 320b-324a), and the Gità (cited TÂ XXVIII 324b, and 325-326a) are put on the same level.167This is an attem pt to translate into English the formula: ‘ascèse intra-mondaine’, coined by Hulin (2001: 268) apropos the BhG.168A rereading implicit in YR’s borrowing from SK 67, while commenting on the paradox­ical condition of the jïvanmukta, as described by PS 81. This Traika rereading of liberation according to Sàipkhya appears equally in the TÀ, notably in IV 212, which associates explic­itly the notion of kaivalya with that of jïvanmukti, and in XXVIII 307-320 and TÀV ad loc. (in particular, ad 317, which cites also SK 67). Hiriyanna (1995: 116, and 1993: 297) finds as well allusion to the notion of jïvanmukti in SK 67-68.169 Probably not the Gaudapâda, author of the Àgamaiàstra; see Frauwallner 1973: 226; Larson 1998: 148-149."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"46INTRODUCTIONw . 67-68: contrasting the ‘incarnate* state of v. 67 with the ‘disincamate’ state of v. 68 (prâpte éanrabhede) — life and death in effect Moreover, the liberation that occurs ‘when the body falls away* (GBh 67: éarirapâte) is the liberation that v. 68 terms kaivalya, described as ‘total* (aikântika), that is, according to the Gaudapàdîyabhâsya, ‘necessary* (avasya), and ‘definitive* (ätyantika), or ‘which encounters no obstacle* (anantarhita) — the princi­pal obstacle being the body, which no longer, in any way shape or form, afflicts the spirit, now liberated, of the departed. In sum, v. 67 refers to jf- vanmukti, v. 68 to kaivalya, ‘absolute* liberation, in the etymological sense o f ‘ab-solvo*, ‘loosen from*.The Trika pretends however to ignore the appropriation of this grada­tion by the Advaita inspired by Sankara. At the very most, one notices, especially in Yogaräja’s commentary, the vedäntic idea of aéarïratva, the ‘disincamation* that characterizes the jïvanmukta in that he ceases to con­fuse his body with the Self.170Another element of the definition of ‘liberation’ that Trika shares with Advaita, and which dissociates it from Sämkhya, is the notion o f ‘felicity* (onanda) that accompanies the experience of liberation. That Sâmkhya has ignored this ‘felicity’ is a reproach made by Sankara ad BÄU III 9, 28, 7: ‘Some, like the partisans of Sämkhya or Vatéesika, opine that in liberation, one tastes no kind of joy*. The Trika does not confront Sämkhya directly on this point, but never ceases to stress the aspect of ‘felicity’, associating with it an aspect of experience that is absent from advaitic arguments: the ‘marvelous* (camatkdra), a notion that Saiva metaphysics shares with Saiva aesthetics.171Whatever may be the case with these similarities and differences, the Trika develops an original doctrine regarding liberation, of which a singu­lar trait is the postulate that liberation in this life is inconceivable in the absence of the Lord’s grace, described here as a ‘descent of energy* (sa/cri- pata). It is this subordination of liberation to ‘grace* that, according to TÄ XIII 276b-279a, constitutes the superiority of the Saiva path in relation to other systems. As André Padoux observes, ‘[... la grâce] détermine la voie parcourue, le maître rencontré, l’initiation reçue et jusqu’au système religieux auquel on accorde sa foi*.172170See p. 27, as well as YR ad 63, 70, 79-80 (and n. 1212), and 85-86: ‘The corporeal sheath is effective only so long as a relation with the sheaths of the [three] impurities [...] that arise from ignorance exists. But since the sheath created by ignorance has already been destroyed by [the guru’s] instruction regarding knowledge of one’s own [true] Self, how can any such corporeal sheath, [even] moribund, effect any control over the knower of the true Self at the end?’ The idea of adariratva culminates in the idea (which is as well an experience) that the universe becomes, as it were, the perm anent body (svängakalpa) of the yogin now freed from his transitory body; see, esp., YR ad 87-88.171 See p. 55.172Silbum, Padoux TÄ: 47.

THE PARAMÁRTHASÁRA OF ABH1NAVAGUPTA47From this point of view, Trika may be considered as a “mystique of grace”. In this vein, the Paramárthasára proposes at the very beginning (v. 9) that the key to the system is Siva’s grace Csivaáaktipáta) . 173 Even if that mystique resonates perfectly with the emotional effusion proper to bhakti — an experience that is omnipresent in Trika literature174 — it is still subject to reasoning and to argumentation. We observe in effect an attempt to theorize that mystique of grace, which not only adduces a com­plex hierarchization of its “degrees”, set forth in ch. XIII of Tantráloka, 175 but also establishes correspondences with the doctrine of the ‘means’ or ‘ways’ (upáya) of liberation. The progressive extenuation of grace is re­flected, in effect, in the descending hierarchy of the ‘means’ — distinctions, of course, as we have seen, that apply only at the mundane level.176 As the first five chapters of the Tantraloka affirm, the ‘ways’ of liberation are themselves subordinated to the degree of grace accorded to the adept — in other words, to his relative capacity of receiving that grace.177Such a conception of grace implies for the Trika the abandonment of social and ritual requisites, measured in terms of the acquisition of merit and demerit. No particular ‘qualification’ (adhikára) is postulated: access to jlvanmukd is thus open to everyone, if only he make a sustained effort in that direction.178It is thus clear that the Paramárthasára articulates the quasi-totality of the doctrine it seeks to abridge around its defense and characterization of liberation. But this project is not without its costs, as certain accents are displaced that are required in order to establish the coherence of the work. On the one hand, an emphasis is put on the notion of the andasapropos the doctrine of Ramanuja: ‘The word (viz., prapatti) points to a belief that salvation is obtained through free grace. It is described as éaranágaú, flinging oneself on God’s com­passion (...]. In one of its forms described as ‘resignation in extreme distress’ (árta prapatti), it is believed to bring liberation immediately. A single moment of seriousness and sincerity is considered enough [...]*.173Which motif is taken up again by YR, notably ad 18: ‘When the bound soul becomes of purified heart, due to the Supreme Lord’s grace, then the veil of sheaths that afflict us with finitude spontaneously disappears, on account of the coming into being of the knowledge of one’s own Self (svátmajñána) (consisting in the insight:] “I am myself the Great Lord.” ’174See, for instance, YR ad 94-95, 100-101, as well as the rich stotra literature.175See Silbum, Padoux TÁ: 44-47.1760 n the doctrine of the upáyas, see n. 858. For the m anner in which a practice engenders a practice associated with the immediately inferior path, or another practice of the same path, see TÁ V 155b-157. The process is comparable to the unfolding of the tnrrvas, and like it, is reversible. The yogin who is not accorded a ‘very intense’ grace (alone associated with the anupáya), may raise himself from one path to the next, seen as levels — from meditation to bhávaná, for instance, and, as TÁ III 174 says, from bhávaná to the experience of the ‘I’, characteristic of the éámbhavopáya.

For, as the Tantraloka insists, in the last analysis, little matters the way; it is the end that counts182 — namely, absorption in Siva (or in the Self),183 that is, liberation itself. Indeed, it is to liberation in this life that lead the three inferior ways, for, in the ‘non-way’ (anupaya), there is neither servitude nor liberation (TA III 273).For this reason, all the ways have a degree of legitimacy. Whether one enters without delay into one of the two superior ways (anupaya, sam- bhavopaya), thanks to a spectacular ‘descent’ of grace that makes any fur­ther mediation unnecessary or useless,184 or whether one raises himself progressively from one way to the next (excluding, of course, the ‘non­way’), each way is instrumental either as such or as transitional, in virtue of a functional hierarchy that is, however, not a hierarchy of value. In ef­fect, even the lowest way, that of the finite soul (anavopdya) is not without value. Apart from the fact that Abhinavagupta says that he was himself initiated into that way by his master Sam bhunatha,185 it emerges from the organization of the Tantraloka itself that the treatment of the anavopdya is not confined to the fifth chapter, but is prolonged well beyond that, even to179It is YR who makes it explicit.180As A. Sanderson (1983: 160) observes: ‘The upayas [...] out of their humble origin in the Malinivijayottaratantra (2.21-23) I...] had become in his [AG’s] exegesis the defining core of his entire system, more than a thousand verses being devoted to their definition in his T antralokasee n. 858.181 See n. 865. Note that, according to YR’s commentary, PS 96 alludes to the idmbhavopdya: ‘The acquisition of the knowledge of one’s own Self has for its unique means (updya) the favor of the Supreme Lord. Here, such [acts] as silent recitation, meditation, offering sacrifice, etc., which arise thanks to the [Lord’s] power of causal constraint, are ineffectual as m eans’, whereas PS 97 implies a reference to the two other ways: the Idktopdya and the anavopdya (see n. 1376).182TA III 293, IV 273-275a, V 153b-155a.183See TA V 151: [...] taddtmyam ydty ananyadhih/ iivena hematdm yadvat tamram sutena vedhitam//.184See TA I 58a as well as PS 96 and YR ad loc.185At least into two practices typical of that path, namely, reflection on the Wheel of ener­gies, and raising the energy of breath (TA V 41, 50b-52)."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"2. THE PARAMARTHASARA OF ABH1NAVAGUPTA49the final chapter.186 In the last analysis, the differentiation of the various ways is not very significant, in the sense that ‘everything is Siva’. 187 That is why the motif of jivanmukti is associated with the three inferior ways in the chapters of the Tantraloka devoted to them, whereas it is absent from the chapter devoted to the anupaya.Another indication of the porosity of the ways and their partial over­lapping is the reciprocity of yogic and mystic practices. In effect, the same practices postulate different modes of realization according to the way in which they are put into effect. Thus are present in the three ways mantric practice,188 kundalini (also utilized considerably in the anavopaya) , 189 and meditation on the Wheel of energies,190 whereas mudras are shared by the saktopaya (TA IV 194-211) and the anavopaya (TA V 79-85). In this sense, the ‘ways’ are so many ‘approaches’ to or specific points of view on the same content of experience. Texts like the Vijnanabhairava [VBh] show how, within the confines of the same practice, the yogin raises him­self from one means to another. So does the commentary on PS 41-46 (avat.).191Still, though perhaps covertly, the Paramarthasdra privileges, it would seem, the point of view of the saktopaya (or jnanopaya, ‘way of know­ledge’), which allows in principle a certain plurality of practice, though one practice suffices.192 This is one of the matters in which the saktopaya is distinguished from the anavopaya, in which a plurality of practices186See TA I 231 and Silbum, Padoux TA: 31.187TA IV 273-375a.188See, respectively, TA III 200b-208a, 223b-225 (which cites Siddhayogeivarimata), on the mantra AHAM; IV 181b-193 {SAUH and KHPHREM); V 54-100 {SAUH); V 131b-155a CSAUH and others).189In the context of a complex practice associated with raising the energy of breath (V 43-53), with the uccara of SAUH (V 54-70 and 141-145), with the fusion proper to sexual union (V 70-74), and with mudras (V 79-85); vv. 86-95, a citation from Tritirobhairava, again evoke it, as well as V 100b-128a, where it is again associated with sexual practice. For the kundalini in the iambhavopaya, see TA III 137b-141a (which cites TrUirobhairava), and III 220-223a (which cites Siddhayogedvarimata), where it is described as phonemic energy, and identical with the totality of word (vac). In the saktopaya, the kundalini is merely alluded to, in a citation from Yogasamcaratantra (TA IV 136-144) which evokes the kutila, the ‘coiled (serpent)’ (IV 142), in its association with sexual practice (see Silbum, Padoux TA: 230), and with the practice of hamsoccara (IV 135-136). Similarly JR apprehends, sub IV 153-157, a reference to the sarpharakundalini, and, sub IV 200, a reference to the moment where the kundalini arrives at the form of mystic drunkenness which is its culmination.,90See TA III 248a-267, IV122b-147, TA V 26b-42.191 See VBh 28-31, for instance, and TA XXXIV 2, quoted n. 868.192Similarly, according to ¿SV III 4, the iaktopaya is the principal focus of the SpK: iti inpur- vaidstre dhyanadi eva dnavatvena uktam/ etac ca sthulatvat ¿oktopdyaprakasdtmani spandaJastre na samgfhitam, ‘In the ¿ripurvafdstra [viz., the MVT] meditation, etc., are spoken of only in relation to the finite soul [viz., to the way of the finite soul); they, because of their gross character, are not referenced in this Spandafdstra, which is devoted to the exposition of the way of energy’."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"50INTRODUCTIONis of the essence, associated with an intense sensory activity. Among the indications corroborating that interpretation: the emphasis placed on ‘knowledge* (jhana) and on the ‘knower’ (jnaniri), as well as the impor­tance attributed to the notion of bhavana (not present in the two superior w ays).193On the other hand, the mantric practice that Yogaraja discerns in w . 41-46 is that prescribed by the saktopaya: 194 not only does he apprehend, in the adjectives sdntam and amrtam of v. 43, an occult reference to the mantra SAUHy 195 which evokes Para, the divinity proper to the iaktopdya, but he emphasizes the effectiveness (virya) of mantras in general (avat. ad 41) — one of the main themes of the iaktopaya. An effectiveness that is not merely a function of correct enunciation, but presupposes the in- teriorization of a mystic realization. The yogin engaged on the ‘way of energy* identifies, not with the divinity that the mantra expresses, as is the case with the Siddhanta, but with ‘the universal sense of the mantra* (mantrdrthasarvatmya, TA IV 258b-259a). In other words, for this yogin, the mantra is not a simple formula for ritual usage, but represents ultimate reality itself.196Mantric practice and bhavana have as their consequence conversion of a discursive mode of thought into an intuitive and non-discursive aware­ness focused (if that is the word) on ultimate reality, an awareness of ‘difference-and-non-difference* (bhedabheda) . 197 Mantric practice and bha- vana concern the interiorized sacrifice (antaryaga), drawn from the Kaula tradition, which itself involves the promise of liberation in this life.198 This ‘interiorized sacrifice’ — touted by the saktopaya199 — defies description and is never better portrayed than by analogy. Thus, as I have already shown, w . 74-80 of the Paramarthasara transform the procedures of the “mundane” ritual metaphorically into their interiorized counterparts — in other words, transform practices proper to the dnavopaya into those suit­able to the saktopaya. 200 Vv. 79-80 are particularly exemplary of this, to the extent that Yogaraja evokes the figure of the Kapalika ascetic in order to oppose to him the figure of the jivanmukta Traika. This also shows how the Trika of the exegetes has been able to integrate, while domesticating and purifying, the older tradition of the Kapalikas, which reserved the most extreme practices to its virtuosi (vira).

THE PARAMARTHASARA OF ABHINAVAGUPTA51trates this dearly: the ascetic who follows the Trika path is as worthy, or perhaps even more worthy, of the title of vtra, for he observes an other- wordly vow, whereas the Kapalika’s is merely mundaneThe privileged place accorded to the iaktopaya in the Paramdrthasara derives as well from the fact that it is presented there as ‘easier*. Such is the teaching of TA IV 257b-258a: ‘[The Siddhanta recommends], in order to identify [with £iva], giving oneself up to restrictive practices such as wearing the topknot. The Kula prescribes their abandonment, for it teaches an easy way’, or of PS 76: ‘For him who is engaged in offering into the blazing fire of consciousness all the great seeds of difference [that blossom forth] on the presupposition of inner versus outer, the oblation is made without effort*.201 Similarly, when PS 80 describes the vow of the yogin engaged on the ‘way of energy* as ‘both easy and very difficult’, it signifies that the iaktopaya is both easier and more difficult than the anavopdya: easier in that the practitioner need no longer concern himself with the panoply of rites prescribed in the anava nor acquire their requisite ingredients and votive objects; more difficult in that all rites must be interiorized successfully. The iaktopaya is thus the way that occupies the middle ground between the idmbhavopaya and the anavopdya, just as the bhedabheda, the experience to which it gives access, occupies the middle ground between the abheda of the idmbhavopaya and the bheda of the anavopdya.The two other ways are not for all that absent in the presentation of the Paramdrthasaraf and the exhortation in the commentary to verse 103 to ‘use all means* in order to accede to the supreme human goal is perhaps to be understood in that sense.202201 See also PS 77: ‘And unceasing is his meditation [...]’ and YR ad loc.: ‘Therefore, the meditation of such a yogin arises naturally (svarasodita)\\ as well as PS 78 and YR ad loc: 'emerging naturally, [the energy of the middle breath] is said to be an innate [kind of] rosary, as it comprehends all the senses’.^ R e fe re n c e s to Bhairava (TA III 1, and passim), to Bhairava as dabdaradi, 'mass of sounds’ (TA III 198-200a), and to the ‘condition/nature of Bhairava’ (bhairavibhava, III 271, 277)— a term for jivanmukti realized in the manner of the ddmbhavopaya (see JR ad 271) — are characteristic of the darpbhavopdya. As well, are the analogy of the m irror (TA III 1-66; 268-293), the m antra AHAM (TA III 20b-206), the celebration of the absolute T (TA III 207-208a, 280-281), and the motif of the Wheel of energies (TA III 248a-267). The same themes may be read sub PS 9-13, 43, 47-50, 96. The avat. ad 41 refers to the m anner in which the yogin raises himself from the daktopdya to the ddmbhavopaya. The point of view of the anavopdya, with its profusion of practices, is relatively rarely adopted in the PS. This point of view appears only by implication in the description of the daktopdya (w . 74-80)— the practices of concern to the dnava are those that the daktopdya transforms — and in that of the ddmbhavopaya — the enlightenment that v. 96 describes has as its ‘m eans’ (upaya) the grace of ¿iva alone, not the collection of means that characterizes the anavopdya: ‘Now the purport of this is as follows: the acquisition of the knowledge of one’s own Self has for its unique means (upaya) the favor of the Supreme Lord.

The only positive reference"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"52INTRODUCTIONThe manner in which the Paramârthasàra positions itself in relation to other systems deserves also to be noted in brief. With the signal excep­tion of verse 27, which is a doxography in miniature, the only evident criticism of other systems is aimed at the rival idealisms of Advaita and Vijnânavâda — as though the dualism of the Sâmkhya were nothing but a venial sin, destined to dissolve itself in the “complete” soteriology of the Trika. Once Sâmkhya dualism is refuted in the commentary to verses 2-3, Yogarâja makes no further reference to that system, apart from some veiled borrowings of elements in its theory of liberation, such as the ana­logy of the potter and his w heel,203 and the very terms of SK 47, of which he offers (ad PS 83) a Traika interpretation.204It is interesting that the Paramârthasàra prefers to efface such differ­ences in order better to bring out the relationship of one tradition to the other. The Sâmkhya is not only a system that the Trika considers to have stopped short in working out the aspiration toward enlightenment and liberation; it is also a system with which the Trika sustains an affinity, indicated by its having adopted the doctrine of the tattvas, together with the notion of their evolution.205For the Sâmkhya doctrine of the tattvas implies two corollaries: on the one hand, that the empirical world is given a value 206 — by the ‘enumera­tion’ Csamkhyd) that is made of its forms; on the other hand, that the world thus evaluated is also instrumentalized in the quest for liberation.According to the Sâmkhyakàrikà (and the commentary of Gaudapâda particularly) the same attractions of the world that subject the purusa to incarnate existence — understood as both intellectual and sensible expe­rience — and to the cycle of rebirths have also the vocation of conducting the purusa to its liberation — which amounts to establishing the final cause as a fundamental principle of the system. That is even their raison d ’être: prakrti deploys the creation (understood as the twenty-three remaining tattvas) only for the sake of the purusa's separation from herself. She worksto the ‘way of the finite soul’ is perhaps found in the following verse. YR ad 97 describes, in effect, the stages of the elevation of the kundalini, a practice present in the three ways, but whose discursivity seems to attach, here, to the ‘way of the finite soul’.^ S K 67 seems to be the origin of this image, which soon becomes a topos; see BSBh IV 1, 15.204In the same way, TÀV XXVIII 312 cites SK 67.205The Trika’s affinity with Sâmkhya is again manifested by its adoption of the satkâryavâd(L^ I n contrast with its devaluation, presented by the Advaita as necessary, to the extent that on that devaluation depends the status of brahman itself (see Hulin 2001: 83). The advaitic devaluation of the phenomenal world extends even to acosmism — the ajànvàda, ‘view that [the world] never came into existence’ — which serves the view that brahman only “truly” exists (Hulin 2001: 56; 102-103; Bouy ÀS: 48-49, 249-254, 266-272). Dasgupta (1975, vol. 1: 423), however, finds an ajâtivàda in Gautjapâda’s Kàrikàs, and considers this an indication of G audapàda’s putative Buddhism — a point of view much debated (on this debate, see Bouy Â& 42-43)."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"2. THE PARAMARTHASARA OF ABHINA VAGUPTA53indefatigably (vv. 56-58) to that end, or better, she displays the creation before the purusa, as an actress before an audience (v. 59). Such would be the meaning of the arresting and sustained analogy of the pra/crti-actress playing before the purusa-spectator (w . 59, 61, 65-66). The same “theater of the world” in which the purusa is imbricated so long as he is deprived of discernment is also the locale of his liberation, for that liberation is sub­ordinated to the acquisition o f ‘discriminating knowledge* (vijnana): once Creation is grasped as a complex of organized constituents, which must therefore be ‘for another*, the purusa is ipso facto ‘differentiated* from it and from the complex; it is ‘free’, it recognizes itself as the independent term, ‘that for which*.207The purusa, in its essence freed of any taint of objectivity — objectiv­ity as summed up in the twenty-four remaining tattvas — is that differ­ence. And that discriminating principle is made the fundamental index of the Samkhyakdrikd's soteriology, from its second karika onwards, which enjoins the fundamental distinction between the ‘manifest’ (vyakta), the ‘unmanifest* (avyakta) and ‘the knower’ (jna — lit., ‘knowing’) — that is, between the twenty-three ‘produced* tattvas, beginning with the buddhi, and the two ‘unproduced’ or original tattvas — primal “m atter” (prakrti), designated as the unmanifest (avyakta)y and primal “spirit” (purusa), the former also frequently referred to as pradhanay the ‘base*, ‘placed-before*.This is taken up by Gaudapada in his Bhasyay who cites the following verse: ‘He who knows the twenty-five principles, whatever his style of life, whether his hair be plaited or in a topknot, or his head shaven, is liberated — no doubt about it!*208Thus, in the Samkhyakdrikd's manner of setting forth the tattvas can be seen in ovo the principle of reversibility of servitude and liberation. One has the feeling that Saivism (nondualist and dualist) takes up this prin­ciple and puts it into practice sequentially, introducing two symmetrical movements of installation and ‘dis’installation of the tattvas, now thirty-six in number. The Saiva innovation consists in the reversal of these tattvas, from gross to subtle, in the ascending movement of the selFs recognition of its Self.209 Of course, the idea is similar to the strategy of the com­bined Samkhya-Yoga, according to which the process of awakening, for207GBh 55: [...] pancavimdantattvajnanam syat sattvapurusdnyaihdkhyatilaksanam idam pro- dhanam iyam buddhir ayam ahahkara imdni panca mahabhutdni yebhyo 'nyah pumso visadpda iti/, ‘The knowledge of the twenty-five principles is marked by the otherness of spirit and existence: “this is m atter”, “this is m ind”, “this is ego”, “these are the great elements” — from all of which alien spirit is dissimilar’; see also GBh 60 and 64.208GBh 1: pancavimdatitattvajno yatra tatradrame vaset/ jati mundl vapi mucyate natra samda- yah//> repeated ad 2.^ S e e S p N I I I 19: [...] dharddidivantasamagrabhogyakavalanena paromapramdtptdm sadm eva pratyabhijnanakramendvalambate/, ‘By gulping down the entire range of things to enjoy, from earth to Siva, he reaches gradually through the process of recognition the state of supreme subject, which exists unconditionally’; see also PTLvf 21-24, quoted n. 621."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"54INTRODUCTIONthe yogin, is in some manner the reverse (pratisarga, or pratiprasava, YS IV 34) of the process described in Samkhya, resulting in the world of our experience. Still, Yoga has not developed the notion of a “reversion” of the tattvas, one after another, as a means of access, or rather, of ascent to liberation. Therefore one can speak of a Saiva “innovation”, 210 at least in a technical sense. Besides, such a reversal of the tattvas is implied in the doctrine’s logic of the system to the extent that it can be considered as conditioned on the introduction of the notion of iakti, which is itself dependent on the introduction of eleven supplementary tattvas whereby a dualism is converted into a monism. In effect, the idea of a “reversion” of the tattvas can only be conceived of dynamically, at the cost of a consid­erable effort capable of establishing the notion the Saivas call adhvasud- dhU ‘purification of the paths’. It is a reversal that is implicit in the term adhvan, ‘path’, given to the differentiated manifestation of the Supreme Lord.211 Apart from the fact that the ‘world as path’ lends itself to direc­tionality, it seems destined to point to a “return path”. In effect, in virtue of a folk etymology that derives adhvan from the root ad, ‘eat’, the path is not just a process, a moving toward something, it is also that which ‘should be consumed’, that is, the expected result of that movement: the ‘path’ (analogy of the empirical manifestation), which the act of returning itself abolishes.212With the insertion of maya and the ‘sheaths’ (kahcuka) associated with it, not only is the dualism of Samkhya made to mesh with Saiva non­dualism, but, inversely, Saiva nondualism attempts to fortify itself against logical defect to the extent that it is careful, in its philosophical discourse, to present maya as one of the modes of realization of the Sakti. With the addition of the eleven superior tattvas, of which the first five repre­sent the ‘pure path’ Csuddhadhvan), £aivism reconciles the level of essence (suddhadhvan) with that of existence (aduddhadhvan).Moreover, the Saiva setting forth of the eleven superior tattvas permits the resolution of another problem that is raised by the borrowing from Samkhya of the notion of the tattvas: the idea of evolution itself, in effect, is in principle incompatible with most Indian idealistic systems, which, establishing an equivalence between “change” and the “unreal”, consider the very idea of evolution in and of itself faulty, erroneous.The Trika’s reconciliation of idealism with the “realistic” approach im­plied by the idea of evolution goes even to the extent of revising the notion of bhedabheda, ‘difference-and-non-difference’. Evolutionism in effect can­210One that could be old; see, for instance, the notion of tattvajaya, ‘conquest of the tattvas*, in MVT (Vasudeva MVT: 149).211 Not only the luddhddhvan and the aluddhddhvan, but the notion of fadadhvan, the ‘six paths’.212See TA VI 30 and TAV ad loc. cited n. 1387."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"2. THE PARAMÀRTHASÀRA OF ABHINAVAGUPTA55not be maintained apart from the notion of bhedàbheda, for such an idea is implied in any theory of causation linking a cause with its effect, different from that cause, but in some sense also the same, for it is not the case that any cause can produce any effect. Thus the quadripartite distinction of the tattvas proposed by classical Sâmkhya reposes implicitly on the notion of bhedàbheda: that which, not produced, produces (prakrti); those which are produced but produce nothing (the mahàbhütas); those that both produce and are produced (from mahat to the tanmâtras); and that which neither produces nor is produced (purusa).In the last analysis, the Saiva treatment of bhedàbheda, illustrated, somewhat atypically,213 by the metaphor of the mirror and its reflection (PS 12-13), would derive as much from a doctrinal constraint — that of an idealistic system — as it does from the external constraint imposed by integrating a “realistic” evolutionism within an “idealistic” evolution­ism. For that, the notion of evolution itself had to be reconsidered. While Sâmkhya makes it dependent on prakrti alone, active but unconscious, presented to a purusa conscious but inactive, Saivism subordinates evolu­tion (where the purusa is relegated to the ‘impure path’) to the agent par excellence, the unique ultimate principle, Siva animated by his Sakti — in other terms, consciousness indissociable from self-consciousness. This agency expresses itself as the absolute T (aham), which is given a central place in the Paramàrthasâra itself, via the “ahamstuti” of verses 47-50, the self-proclamation of the T as the ultimate Real.214 Thus the idea of the ultimate principle as itself agent seals the difference, on the ontological plane, between Sâmkhya and Trika, or rather consecrates the integration of the first in the second.215The Trika distinguishes itself also from Sâmkhya in that the réévalua­tion of the sensible world culminates in a sense of marvel (camatkara)y a ‘marveling’ that borders always on joy (dnanda), and which characterizes both the regard the yogin casts upon this marvelously variegated world and the open-eyed delight with which he contemplates his identity with that world and with the Lord.216We find here perhaps the source of one of the characteristic features of the nondual Saivism of Kashmir, which has developed, alongside a reli­gious philosophy and a mysticism, an aesthetics that has become one of the leitmotifs of Indian speculation, and compelling enough as an aesthetics to overshadow all its rivals. A series of writers, preeminently ¿aivite, among213In Advaita, the same analogy illustrates the notion o f ‘appearance’, bhedàbheda being rejected by ¿ahkara as a logical contradiction; see p. 57.214See, esp., Tantrasàra [TS] VIII (p. 86) quoted n. 594, and TS VIII (p. 87), quoted n. 605, which speaks of the ‘agentive part’ (kartromia) of the ahankàra, itself nothing else than the devaluated form of the absolute laham\\215See also PS 10-11, PS 14, PS 45, and YR ad loc.; also ÎPvj* III 2, 5, quoted n. 515.216See YR ad 75 and 79-80."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"56INTRODUCTIONwhom Abhinavagupta was probably the most influential,217 developed a “theory of beauty”, or rather, of “aesthetic experience”, that remains one of the jewels of Kashmir to this day.Not only is aesthetic emotion described in the very terms that Kash­mirian Saivas apply to spiritual experience — rasa, ‘savor*, ananda, ‘bliss*, camatkara, ‘wonder’, dtmavtfranti, ‘repose in the Self— but the ‘amaze­ment* (vismaya) of ordinary experience is transmuted into the ‘sentiment* (rasa), as aesthetical as it is spiritual, of the ‘Marvelous* (adbhuta). The yogin and the spectator of drama have in common the ‘recognition* of the Self, or, what amounts to the same thing, their identification with the uni­verse — a transitory experience for the spectator but established once and for all for the yogin,218 who is thus nothing but an ‘emancipated specta­tor*.219What about the relation of Trika with Advaita? It is obvious that the former shares with the latter the notion of maya (already present in the first Paramdrthasara) and its faculty of ‘veiling* (avarana), inherited from the tradition; after all, even in its vedic occurrences, and in conformity with its etymology, maya is a ‘power of fabrication*, and as such can be seen as to represent the advaitic version of the Saiva iakti. Yet, whatever may be their fundamental affinity in this regard, it is still the case that the two systems differ considerably in their manner of treating maya.In the Paramdrthasara, we find, in effect, a polemical attack on Vedan­ta’s views regarding sakti and maya. Yogaraja (ad 15) reproaches the ‘Brahmavadins* for having considered maya distinct from brahmany where­as, from the Saiva point of view, maya is nothing but a realization of Siva’s ia/cri, understood initially as ‘energy of freedom* Csvatantryasakti). It is be­cause of this failure to recognize the essential freedom of the supreme217See Bansat-Boudon 2004: 273ff.218See Uvarapratyabhijnavimariim [IPV] 1 1 ,1 , vol.

THE PARAMÁRTHASÁRA OF ABHINAVAGUPTA57principle that Yogarája (ad 27) finds fault with these Brahmavádins, even though such an account of the vedántic system (especially that of Sankara) must be taken as a serious abridgement, which fails to take note of the important cosmological role played therein by Isvara, or of the complex interplay of máyá and the jiva in its account of the “perceptible” world.As a consequence, one observes that the Traika view of the “real world” differs somewhat from that of Sankara’s Advaita, where notions of the “real” are based exclusively on the single unchanging Real, brahman (sat, to ov), which can never be other than it is (in later Advaita usage, termed páramárthikam sat). By contrast, the “absolutely unreal” (prátibhásika) can appear only verbally, is always other than it is (asat) — the ‘son of a barren woman’ (a contradiction in terms) or the ‘horn of a hare’ (an imaginary as­sociation). Between these two extremes is the “real world” (vyávahárika) — or what we like to call the “real world” — which is ‘inexplicable’ (anirva- canlya) in the sense that it is neither absolutely real nor absolutely unreal (sadasadvilaksana) — the world, in other words, of change, where rules of cause and effect apply. Sankara prefers the formula sadasadvilaksana to the older bhedabheda (different-and-not-different) for he considers this last a contradiction in terms.While the Saivas and the Advaitins agree in not denying a provisional reality to the world of normal experience, they seem to part company in their view of the “absolutely unreal”, which notion has disappeared from the Saiva lexicon, leaving us with a “bi-polar” universe consisting of the God on one side and his “creation” on the other. Such “entities” as sky-flowers and square circles are accorded no special status, for as ideas they “exist” in the same created universe.220 In a sense, we have returned to a more Sámkhya-oriented view of the Real, where the created world is legitimated as a function of the absolute, no doubt motivated by the áaivas* view that action is part and parcel of that absolute, conceived as inseparable from its Sakti.Thus, in the schema of the Trika, áakti appears twice, as the consort of áiva, that is, as self-consciousness still indistinct from pure consciousness, and as the subtly “degraded” form of máyá — which, it will be remem­bered, figures as the sixth in the procession of the tattvas. In this sense, one can say that the Trika substitutes for the pair brahman/máyá of Advaita the couple Siva/áakti, once máyá, or more precisely, the goddess Máyá, is taken as a hypostasis of Sakti. It being understood that, in a Traika per­spective, the dissociation Sakti/máyá is valid only in a worldly perspective,^ S e e PS 44 and n. 915. Trika theory holds that consciousness contains everything within its fold. Only that which is known exists; w hatever is not an object of knowledge does not exist. It is curious that the same formulation of the relation of the idea and its object may be found also in the most extreme realistic doctrines — notably Prábhákaramímámsá — where it cannot be admitted that an idea (even an erroneous one) has “nothing\" for its object; see also n. 265."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"58INTRODUCTIONvertically; it has no reality from the ultimate point of view, when envis­aged horizontally. In some ways, it could be said that the Trika conception of maya is closer to that of the Gita — or in any case, to the version of the Gita as commented upon by Abhinavagupta. Besides, it should be noted that the philosophical discourse of Advaita, though founded on the pair brahman-maya, does not assign to the tattvas the soteriological role which is their due in Samkhya and in Trika — although in varying ways.As regards the integration of Samkhya into the Trika, certain displace­ments are in evidence: the maya of the Trika represents functionally the prakrti of Samkhya with the major difference that the former now embod­ies a goddess and is not an ‘unconscious* principle; in contrast, the prakrti of the Trika is a devalued form of the Samkhya prakrti, reduced to its tri- gunatmaka function. Likewise, the purusa of the Samkhya becomes, in the Trika hierarchy, little more than the archetype of the finite, bound soul.It is true that Indian soteriologies have as their principle the abroga­tion of a condition deemed unhappy, and one can argue that they are all organized around a dialectic of servitude and liberation. Still, the way pro­posed by Saivism is distinguished from other systems by the dynamism and discursivity of that dialectic. A quality that relates evidently to its notion of the Absolute (called Siva), which the throbbing essence of its energy predisposes to a series (limited in number) of manifestations. The geneses of finitude and of liberation operate, dynamically, by a progressive instal­lation and disinstallation of the tattvas, by the emanation of diversity and its reabsorption. Thus does Saivism interpret both Samkhya and Advaita.The thought-universe of the Trika is indeed that of an idealism based on the notion of universal consciousness, of which many variants exist, in the West as well. Still, the wide range and the complexity of the system make it unique, inasmuch as it develops, as a coherent tradition, over several centuries, and is graced by the works of some of the most acute thinkers of the Indian past.Lyne Bansat-Boudon Saint-Aubin-sur-mer, June 3, 2009"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"TranslationSalutation to the one having the form of ultimate reality, which is the Self, which is consciousness.Now beginsthe Paramdrthasara, the ‘Essence of Ultimate Reality*,221 composed by the revered master, Abhinavagupta, most eminent among the great Saiva teachers222 together with the commentary of the revered master Yogaraja221 The compound paramartha is equivocal as is the final term artha, which may be under­stood according to anyone of its various meanings, such as ‘goal’, ‘object*, ‘truth’, ‘reality’; see Intr., n. 7.^mdhedvarfic&rya — li t, 'preceptor in the lineage of [teachers] devoted to Mahe^vara’.59"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"60TRANSLATION1. To the One who, although nothing but a mass of conscious­ness,223 is yet solidified in the form of the world,224 to the unborn One who is proficient in the play225 of concealing226223cidghana: the image, much exploited in the Saivism of Kashmir, of consciousness as ‘solid’ or ‘compact* {ghana) is translated here more or less literally, though it probably seems quite paradoxical to the Western reader, as ‘solidity’ is normally associated with physical objects, especially weighty ones, not with events of the mind. But it also appears to be the case that ¿aiva authors were quite aware of the paradox as well, and had good reason to stress it. Even in modem Sanskrit, the term ghana continues to be associated with the gross, rather than the subtle, as for instance ‘ice’ is commonly referred to as *ghanibhutam jalam*. Several rationales can be adduced for this strange metaphorical usage, among them the fact of paradox itself, which may serve (as it often does in Advaita and MSdhyamika explanations) to shock the mind out of its usual habits and to prepare it for supra-mundane insights. It may also be the case, especially for Kashmirian ¿aivas — who do not dismiss the ‘solid’ world as a purely illusory phenomenon (as is usually done by Advaitins), but see it as an activity of the Lord himself — that, by this paradox, attributes normally associated with the effect are transferred to the cause, emphasizing thus the cause’s truly substantial reality. Which suggests a third rationale for the usage, which is simply that it is the overtones suggested by the literal ‘solidity’ that are at issue — thus consciousness is ‘compact’, ‘uniform’, ‘pervasive’, etc. And finally, in stressing what amounts to the materiality of consciousness, our authors may be making a point that is often associated with the 'material cause’ (in Aristotelian terms), namely, that, qua matter, all form is superadded and ipso facto extrinsic. As Chdndogya says, what is ‘real’ is the clay, not the pot or the dish or the toy formed of it. Mutatis mutandis, the clay (as matter) is ‘inexpressible’ except as or through form — one cannot encounter clay as such, and yet all clay objects are nothing but clay. Taken together, these interpretive possibilities present a strong justification for this apparently anomalous metaphor. However that may be, the formula has upani$adic antecedents: cf. BAU IV 5, 13: evam vd are yam dtma [...] kftsnah prajhanaghana eva, and BAU I I 4,1 2 : idam mahad bhutam [...] vijnanaghana eva; also MaU 5, referred to n. 792; see also n. 234 on cidanandaikaghana.224jaganmurti: in spite of the solidity implied by the term ghana, the same cit is seen as rasa, fluidity (cf. the expression ‘cidrasa’ in PH 4, quoted below), which, when oriented toward objectivity in the process of bhedavyakti, ‘manifestation as difference’, is again described in terms of gradual solidification, or crystallization, which process ends in pjthivftattva. Solidi­fication is also emphasized through terms such as iydna (or aiyana, or praiyana) and murti. In the sense of ‘image’, murti (derived from the root murch, ‘to solidify’, ‘to coagulate’) sig­nifies the coagulation of the essential fluidity of the divinity. In this mahgala, YR seems to echo the words of his direct guru K$emar3ja’s auto-commentary on PH 4, pp. 55-56: inpara- maiivah [...] cidrasasydnatdrupdiesatattvabhuvanabhdvatattatpramdtrddydtmataydpiprathate/, ‘Paramasiva (...) manifests (lit., ‘displays’] himself both as the totality of principles, worlds and entities and as their respective experiencers, that are only a solidified form of the es­sential fluidity of consciousness’.

Quoted in Utpalavai?nava’s SpP (£astri Isl&mpurkar 6), the Cicchaktisamstuti, which develops the image, uses the same terminology: prdiydnai cidrasasyoghah sakaratvam upa- gatah/ avaiydyah prabodhdrke tudite svasvabhavabhak//, ‘The stream of the essential fluidity of consciousness solidifies, assuming (concrete) forms. However, it recovers its own essential nature (i.e., its fluidity], as does the morning dew, when the Sun of consciousness rises’.225kridd — a key term of the doctrine.226pracchadana points here to a central concept of the ¿aivism of Kashmir the tirodhana- iakti, power (or energy) of concealment of the Lord, itself a realization of his svatantryaiakti, his energy of absolute freedom.

We have tended to prefer ‘know’ and its derivatives for the former, and ‘cognize’, etc., for the latter — although both translations are etymologically closer to Skt. jňá than either is to the original sense of má, ‘to measure, determ ine’. Rather than become embroiled in the Germanic / Latinate constrast, some have preferred the Greek- based ‘gnosis’ for jňána, for obvious reasons (Skt. jňáti would be an exact transposition of this term), but of course this too is, etymologically, just another variant of the IE root *gnó. To the extent, however, that the terms based on the root md retain an associative nuance with their origins in the Naiyáyika-Bauddha debates on ‘valid means of cognition*, it was thought at least permissible to employ here the rather more ‘academic’ associations of ‘cognize’, reserving the solid Germanic ‘know’ for jňá and its derivatives — whose applications are both mundane and esoteric, but less often “technical” — in the sense of serving to disambiguate the concrete problems of the “knower” enmeshed in the trammels of m undane awareness. Along with pramátf ‘cognizer’ must be accounted an entire family of terms that serve to characterize the problematic of the concrete knower — prameya, ‘object of cognition’ (for the Nyáya, there is no ‘knowledge’ without a corresponding object — a position common to most “realisms”); pramána, ‘m eans’ of establishing a correct relation between the prior two; and pramá, the ‘valid’ cognition thus derived. If these associations are to be thus retained, the distinction in translation may to that extent be justified. In some contexts, however, stylistic and other constraints may operate to suggest a less rigid adherence to this strict distinction. See PS 30-31, 39-40, 60-61 concerning the two levels of error, as sources of bondage.232pravanatá — lit., ‘his [constant] submission’. Cf. ÍPV 1 1 (vol. 1:18ff.), in which prahvatá is synonymous with the pravanatá found here. Commenting upon Utpaladeva’s first words: kimcid ásádya mahešvarasya dásyám [...], ‘Having somehow realised my condition as being M aheivara’s servant [...]’, ÍPV 11,1 (vol.

Pandey); see Sanderson 2005: 89ff.^ Í P V 11,1 (vol. I: 21) explains that the salutation and the vow, or celebration, of divine victory it implies, w hether expressed or not, are interrelated: šuddhaprakášarp [...] pra- khyopákhyákramena svátmaparávabhásavisayabhávajigamLfayá nihŠe$otkar$ábhidhiyijayatyádi~ šabdánuvedhena parámaršaniyam, ‘Pure Light [i.e., consciousness, or the Lord] (...) should however be clearly apprehended by calling to mind some words like “jayati\", “he is vic­torious”, which stands for all-surpassing greatness, with the intention of bringing it before one’s own as well as others’ consciousness by means of inner visualisation and its external expression [through the utterance of the salutation itself] respectively’ (tr. Pandey, vol. Ill: 2, modified).234cidánandaikaghana — lit., ‘mass consisting solely of consciousness and bliss’ (if the com­pound cidánanda be understood as a dvandva, as is generally the case); or 'mass consisting solely of the bliss that is consciousness’ or 'mass consisting solely of the bliss of conscious­ness’ (if the compound be understood as a karmadháraya or tatpurufa). For an inventory of more-or-less equivalent expressions gleaned from the commentary (cidekaghana, cidekavapus, cidekamurti, cinmurti, cinmurtatva, cinrůpa, citsvarúpa, cidghana, abhinnacidghana) suggests, beneath the diversity of style, an insistence on (1) the sole reality of cit — by appropriating qualifications normally associated with its “objects”, viz., vapus, múrti, růpa, etc.; (2) the materiality of cit, as the sole basis of the visible world. The mention ánanda in the longer versions of the compound seems destined to add a “sensible” dimension to that uniqueness. All of which might be alleged to favor the interpretation of the compound itself, not as a dvandva, but as a karmadháraya or tatpuru$a — for, precisely, cit and ánanda are not two; therefore our translation: ‘a uniform mass of blissful consciousness*."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"KARIKA 163condition of finite cognizer (parimitapramatr) has been overcome:2351.

The Pandit edition of the APS omits those first two stanzas, beginning directly with the long narrative frame (garbha- grha*...) that precedes the exposition proper. Thus is the title Arydpancaliti justified: if the concluding verse is excepted, the text does consist of 85 aryas; see Intr., n. 16.^ T h e term sphuratta is one of the key words of the Trika. Mayrhofer, Monier-Williams CSanskrit-English dictionary [MW]), and other authorities consider the roots sphurt sphar, and sphay more or less related; the various senses that may attach individually to each root are often confounded in the usage of all, extending from ‘be enorm ous’ to ‘explode’. By reason of the frequency of their occurrences alone, and given the preponderance of the notion of light in this doctrine, the roots [pra-]kadf [p r avi-, ava-]bha, bhds, sphurt etc., appear to be employed w ithout major differentiation of meaning. Thus, we have preferred to translate them in a more or less anodyne fashion and indifferently with terms such as ‘appear’, ‘be­come evident’, ‘become patent’, ‘manifest’, etc. A passage from TAV V 123 supports this interpretation: commenting on bhasate durghapd iaktir of the verse, JR says: bhdsate svat- maikatmyena prathate, ‘[and so, that energy] “manifests itself*, [that is] it extends itself [as everything visible] inasmuch as it is [ever] identical with itself [viz., incapable of abolishing its own n ature]’ (see the entire passage, n. 872); also TAV IV 14, where sphutayet is glossed as sakfdtkurydL However, to fully understand the connotations of these usages will require a complete exposition of the Saiva doctrine, which is rather the business of PS itself. The term sphuratta appears in IPK I 5, 13-14, in the context of defining citi — ‘consciousness’, or, as translated by Pandey, ‘sentiency’, or 'principle of consciousness’ (IPK, vol. Ill: 73), a term that is glossed by the Vimariini as yd citih citikriya tasydh pratyavamariah, ‘the act of consciousness which has self-reference’ (tr. Pandey, vol. Ill: 73). Being essentially reflec­tive awareness (pratyavamaiia), consciousness (ciri) is represented also as ‘supreme Speech’ (paravac), ‘freedom’ (svatantrya) and ‘sovereignty’ (atfvarya) of the supreme Self (paramat- man) (IPK I 5 13); as the ‘manifestation’ (sphuratta), ‘absolute being’ (mahasatta), and ‘heart’ fhfdaya) of the Supreme Lord (IPK I 5 14). IPV I 5 ,1 4 glosses again mahasatta as mahadevit through the citation (vol. I: 261): mahasatta mahddevi vtfvajivanam ucyate. On the Vai$e$ika and VaiySkarana concept of mahasatta, see Appendix 15, p. 339. Here, the use of the root sphur in the sense o f ‘to manifest’ is significant, for the Trika phenomenal world is neither an illusory appearance (viva/ta), as Advaitins hold, nor a real transform (parinama), as stated by followers of Samkhya and P&hcaratra, but the luminous manifestation of the Lord (or spanda principle) that is implicit in every act of consciousness and which “surges forth” periodically as the insight determining even the possibility of awareness.

One might suspect here a play on the word sreyas — a term commonly used by the MTmamsakas in the sense ‘the goal par excellence’; that is to say, the reward, in the largest sense, deriving from strict performance of the sacrifice: the maintenance of the good order of things (dharma) and, ultimately, the personal reward thereto pertinent, long life and, at its conclusion, residence among the gods. Where the text declares no explicit purpose deriving from the ritual, the Mimamsakas posit this “general” end, for every act should be undertaken in view of some result, whatever it may be. So, in later loose usage, ireyas becomes a term for the ‘purpose of purposes’, something akin to the Platonic ‘Good’, human felicity in its most abstract form, or (even better) ‘heaven’ — but generally to be distinguished from the ‘other-worldly’ purpose (which is not an “end”), mukti, liberation. In our text, however, some occurrences of ireyas appear to refer to mukti; see also n. 150 and 1421.2Aliambhum svatmadevatakaram eva prapadye na ca punar mdyanta£cdrinam kimcid bhinnam devam.

Cf. IPV 11,1 quoted n. 241.243The syntax of commentaries on versified texts is relatively free; two exegetical proce­dures are followed: the dandanvaya, ‘rod-like syntactic construction’, and the khanddnvayat ‘syntactic construction [made clear] by [having recourse to its] elements (khanda)’. Begin­ning with the subject (if expressed), ending with the verbal form, the dandanvaya method places the intermediary words in their respective cases in keeping with the normal prose or­der. Such is the style of M allinatha’s commentaries on Kalidasa’s works. Here, and through­out his commentary, YR follows the khandanvaya style: the long sentence constituting the entire karika is first reduced to its core sentence: tvam eva £ambhurp £aranam [prapadye = ] sam£raye, which is then explained in the order of its words. Then, the exegete explains the other words of the sentence — all here adjectives qualifying ‘iambhum’ — by asking questions that elicit the qualifications as responses: ‘what sort [of Sam bhu]?’ One will find excellent illustrative examples of this style in YR’s commentary ad 98-99. Note that the question: ‘what sort [of Sambhu]?’ (kim bhutam) will be again answered in karikas 10-11, 43, and, even more elaborately, in karikas 64-66. At the same time, YR’s commentary adheres to the general principles of Indian hermeneutics in stressing the inner coherence Csamgati) of the text, and in raising possible objections and offering solutions (akfepasya samadhdnam); cf.

According to R, the adjective gahana (lit., ‘dense’, ‘impenetrable’), as qualifying the noun bandhana, means ‘difficult to destroy’ (duruccheda). In this under­standing, APS 6b means: ‘How is the limited soul to be delivered from bondage, [which is] difficult to eradicate because of the darkness that is delusion?’ (We differ from Danielson’s understanding of the verse.) See also TÀ VIII 322a, which associates máyátattva with ga­hana: máyátattvam vibhu kila gahanam arupam samastavilayapadam/ , ‘màyàtatt\\>a is indeed pervasive, impenetrable, formless. It is the abode of dissolution of the entire universe’. This rather cryptic statem ent is further explained by JR: vibhu vyàpakam ata eva gahanam/ arûpam iti sûksmatvât/ samastavilayapadam iti sûksmena kramenátra viévasyávasthánát, ' vibhu means “pervasive”, therefore “impenetrable” (gahana). It [viz., máyátattva] is “formless”, due to its subtlety. It is the “abode of dissolution of the entire universe”, for the entire universe re­mains there in a subtle sequence’. In other words, since phenomenal diversity in its entirety (meya) arises from the tattva named máyá, it is considered to abide there in a subtle form. As such, máyáguhá is also defined, in TÀ VIII 308a, as jagadyoni, the ‘womb of universe’. We will devote a separate study on the Trika notion of a threefold máyá, namely, máyágranthi, the ‘knot’ (or máyábila, the ‘cavity’), máyátattva, the ‘principle’ (or máyáguhá, the ‘cavern’) and máyáéakti, described in PS 15.

The first five tattvas are grouped together as the éuddhàdhvan, the pure path; the aéuddhádhvan includes the other 31. On máyátattva, see also n. 246.248This notion accounts for that ideal, or internal, level of manifestation, which has not yet materialized into actual creation. As Michel Hulin (1978: 305) states, at the level of the éuddhádhvan, ‘áiva [fait], si l’on ose dire, le tour de sa nature* (‘Siva, so to speak, takes an overall view of his own nature’)."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"66TRANSLATIONtiated, when manifesting various states of consciousness,249 he does not deviate from his transcendent nature, which is all-encompassing.As it has been said in the SpandaÉâstra:Even though different [states of consciousness, such as] wak­ing, etc.,250 that are not [truly] different from him ,251 proceed from h im ,252 he never departs from his own nature, which is that of pure agent of experience (upalabdhr) .253249Reflecting on the states of consciousness (avasthâ) — waking (jägrat), dream (svapna), deep sleep Csusupti) — has, from the time of the earliest upaniçads, the BÄU and ChU, been a way of discovering the inner àtman, for susupti is taken to be the stage (avasthâ or sthàna) w here objectivity resolves into its source, as it were. See BÄU I I 1 ,1 5 -1 9 (svapna and sufupti), IV 3, 9-34 (jâgrat, svapna and susupti), with the famous image (IV 3 ,1 8 ) of the âtman/purufa continuously wandering through the two states of waking and sleep, as a great fish swims from one bank of the river to the other, see also BÄU (II 1, 15-19, IV 3, 9-20); ChU IV 3, 3; VIII 6, 1-3; VIII 10-11; KauBU III 13; ¿B X 3 3, 6 and 5 2, 11-15; BSBh I 1, 4 and I 1, 23. In accordance with a recurring pattern where + 1 completes a series of three in an enum eration (see Malamoud 1989: 140ff.), some texts, like MuU III 2 8 (quoted by R ad ÄPS 70), postulate a state (not yet designated as the ‘Fourth’, turiya or turya) transcending all three: vidvân nâmarùpâd vimuktah parât param purusam upaiti divyam, ‘He who knows, delivered from name and form, attains the divine Being, higher than the highest’; see also ChU VII 2 4 ,1 : yatra nänyat paiyati [...] sa bhümà. It is MäU 7 and 12 that, for the first time, explicitly adduces a caturtha, ‘fourth’ state (on the MäU and its exposition by Gautjapada, who lived before ¿ankara, see PS 35 and YR’s gloss). The ¿aivism of Kashmir adds a fifth, turyâtita, ‘beyond the Fourth’, the ‘trans-fourth’ state. Thus is developed the logic of transcendence, in consequence of which the ¿aivism of Kashmir postulates above Siva himself, Paramaiiva; see YR ad 14 (and n. 513), which establishes the correspondence of turya with the ‘pure path’ (iuddhadhvan), i.e., the totality of the first five tattvas; also YR ad 15 and 85-86.^ A c c o rd in g to the SpN (Singh: 34), ‘etc.’ includes not only dream (svapna) and deep sleep (susupti), states of consciousness common to all (lokaprasiddha), but also concentration (dhâranâ), meditation (dhyâna) and intense absorption (samâdhi) that are proper to yogins. SpN 13 seems to establish a term-by-term correspondence between waking / dhâranâ, dream / dhyâna, and deep sleep / samâdhi. On this point, see éSV I 8 -1 0 (Singh: 43).251 According to SpN I 3, tadabhinne may be understood as a hetugarbhavtiefana, an ‘ad­jective containing an implicit reason’. Thus one could understand: ‘Even though different [states of consciousness such as] waking, e tc , proceed [from him], he never departs from his own nature, which is that of a [pure] agent of experience (upalabdhf), for those [states of consciousness] are not [truly] different from him ’.^ O r else (according to the gloss prasarpati = pravahati sati): 'flow on’, i.e., ‘go on appear­ing’. However, our translation of prasarpati as ‘proceed from’ is also supported by the SpN which emphasizes the process of manifestation, expression of the Lord’s absolute freedom: anena câtidurghatakâritvam eva bhagavato dhvanitam/ yasmâj jâgarâdivibhedam ca prakàiayati tatraiva ca svâbhedam iü bhedâtmanâ tadabhedâtmanobhayâtmanà ca rùpenàparâparâparâpa- râ&aktitrayasvarüpena sphurati, ‘This [adjective ‘tadabhinne’] suggests that the Lord accom­plishes [what is otherwise] difficult to construe. Inasmuch as he [is the one who] manifests (prakàiayati) the different states, waking, etc., [he manifests] his own lack of difference vis-à-vis that [manifestation of difference]. Thus, he manifests himself as differentiated, as non-differentiated and as both differentiated and non-differentiated when he assumes the form of the triad of his energies, viz., non-supreme, supreme, supreme-non-supreme’.^ S p K I 3. Ancient commentators, as well as modem scholars, have variously interpreted this verse (see Silbum, Singh, Dyczkowski ad SpK), largely for the reason that the syntactic construction of the first hemistich may be analyzed in two ways, as shown by Kçemarâja in"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"KÁRIKÁ 167Beginningless means ‘ancient’, 254 due to the presumption of priority Cádisiddhatva) 255 [that necessarily devolves] from his status as thehis Spandanirnaya. In the first interpretation, the first hemistich is to be taken as a locative absolute in which the tatpurusa compound tadabhinne is an adjective qualifying jágradádivi- bhede ’pi, and prasarpati is the locative of the present participle« We have preferred to retain this interpretation in our translation inasmuch as Ksemarája also seems to prefer it (see the beginning of the gloss: lokaprasiddhe [...] bhede yogaprasiddhe ’pi vá [...] prasarpaty anyán- yarvpe pravahati sati arthát tat tattvam [...] naiva nivartate). In the second interpretation, tad becomes an autonomous pronoun, and the subject of the present indicative prasarpati. tat would then refer to the spanda principle, and the meaning would be: ‘Although that [spanda principle] flows on (prasarpati = prasarati) [i.e., ‘assumes diversity’ (vaicitryam gfhrtáti)] in different [states of consciousness such as] waking, etc., which are not [truly] different from it, it never departs from its own nature which is that of a [pure] agent of experience’ (see Silbum SpK: 71); or else, if one retains the alternative understanding of jágradádivibhede ’pi as jágradádivibhede *pi sati, offered by SpN: ‘Although that [spanda principle] flows on [i.e., ‘assumes diversity’], when different [states of consciousness such as] waking, etc., take place [...] ’. The two interpretations — equally supported by SpN — are not fundamentally dif­ferent, except for the emphasis that the first puts on the absolute freedom of the Lord. The káriká means that ¿iva, or the spanda principle, is the condition permitting such states of con­sciousness; the essential nature of ¿iva is that of pure agent of experience (upalabdhf), and this persists even when one dreams, or is in deep sleep. In other words, states of experience such as waking, etc., may differ phenomenally, but ¿iva, as Experiencer, remains one and the same as consciousness. See SpN I 3: nivartate niján naiva svabhávád upalabdhftah: tat tattvam nijád anapáyinah sarvasyátmabhútác cánubhaviqrúpát svabháván naiva nivartate, ‘This [spanda] principle never departs from its immutable nature, which consists in being the universal Self and the [pure] agent of experience’ (on the meaning of upalabdhf, glossed as anubhavitf, see n. 337). As observed by SpN, this metaphysical truth has its practical counterpart in spiritual practice and experience: ataá ca jágarádidaáávasthito ’py evam imam svasvabhávam pariáilayan yaá cinute sa iañkara evety upadijtam bhavati, ‘Thus, this verse teaches that, although himself the basis of differentiated states, such as waking, etc., he who persists essentially (cinute) while contemplating his own undifferentiated nature is that very ¿añkara’. PM ad MM 19 [PM 19] quotes SpK I 3.254Cf. BÁU IV 4, 18: te nicikyur brahma puránam agryam, ‘They have realised the ancient primordial Brahman’.^ S e e Utpaladeva’s iPvj-1 1 ,2 , where the term ádisiddha of the káriká, lit., ‘established from the beginning’, or ‘logically prior’, is glossed both by pürvasiddha ‘formerly established’ and purána ‘ancient’. It means that the cognizer is prior to the cognition, that he is its condition sine qua non. The subject precedes the object, which is but the object of his cognition, and as such is established (siddha) first. This question of the Lord’s ádisiddhatva is discussed at length in SpN I 2, while answering the Buddhist objection that there is no Self, no ultimately real Knower, that which we consider real is, for want of a better word (cf. SpN 14) a continuum, a series, of cognitions (jñánasantána). K$emarája demonstrates that a denying subject is needed for denying the Self; in other words, that without a denying Self, there cannot be denial of the Self, for this denial would be then a painting without a canvas (abhittikam etac citram). The proof of the reality of the Lord is precisely his manifestation as denying subject Therefore the text can conclude: bhagaván ádisiddhasvaprakááamürtir asóti, ‘The Lord, being logically prior (ádisiddha), and in the form of self-luminosity, does exist’. Such arguments as to the logical priority of the Self or consciousness are found in all the Indian idealisms: cf. ¿añkara’s Upadeáasáhasri 97: siddhá tarhy átmanahpramátuhsvatahsiddhihpramánanirapeksatayaiva. In ÍP W 11,2 (vol. 1:51), AG, while answering the objection that in the case of fire inferred from smoke, it is smoke that is established first, contrasts that sort of priority with the priority of the Self, which is qualified as purána, since there cannot be any objectification of the Self, the pure subject.

Thus IPK (I 1,2) affirms the logical priority of the Self, i.e., the spanda: ata eveivarapratyabhijnaydm ddisiddhir ity uktam (correcting a misprint [adisidd/iarj in Dyczkowski’s edition). In IPV 11,2 (vol. I: 55), AG glosses the term adisiddha with avicchinnaprakala, ‘of uninterrupted light’, and relates it to the next word of the karika, maheivara, the ‘sovereign Lord’ — who is such on account of his being uninterrupted light, manifesting himself thereby as omniscient (/ndtf*) and omnipotent (kartr). AG attributes the meaning ‘eternal’ (see Pandey’s transl., p. 10), or ‘eternally present’, to adisiddha — a meaning that can be retained in YR’s commentary, where adisiddha glosses anddi, ‘beginningless’. On purdna, see YR ad 7; also the avat. ad 47-50, which refers to the concept of ddisiddhatd.256The expression addresses the problem common to all monisms: how can one reconcile the oneness of the Lord, the only Real, with phenomenal diversity? The Lord’s immanence consists in his being the consciousness of each and every finite being, from the Rudras to the ksetrajnas. guha, ‘cavern’, is a designation of maya, 'power of differentiation’, or ‘delusion’. It is not to be taken as a mere metaphor, rather, it is a technical term that designates one aspect or level of maya, seen as threefold; see n. 246.257The phrase associating rudras and ksetrajnas recurs as a motif in Trika texts; cf. YR ad 5, 6, 14, 23 and SSV, mahgalacarana: rudraksetrajnavargah samudayari yato yatra visrantim fcched [...] caitanyam ¿ahkaram taj jayati, ‘Victory to this consciousness of ¿ahkara from which proceeds the host of Rudras and ksetrajnas, and in which they come to rest’. It is a way of classifying the multitude of cognizers (pramatf) — or, as stated by PS 5, of ‘enjoyers’ (bhoktf) — endowed with bodies (or, more generally, ‘forms’), faculties (karana) and the corresponding attributes iguna), into a hierarchy of categories, according to the degrees of excellence of their faculties: gods (Rudra, etc., viz., Brahma and Vi$nu), men (among which the yogins enjoy extraordinary faculties and powers), and 'anim als’, this latter category in­cluding stationary beings (sthdvara) such as plants; see Appendix 1, p. 317.258The analogy of the actor is recurrent in Indian speculation, one of the better-known examples being the danseuse (or actress) of the Samkhyakdrikd. The theory of the seven subjects (saptapramdq) is implicitly referred to here. See YR ad 14, and SpN I 1 quoted in Appendix 10, p. 330. For the same analogy of £iva as an actor, see YR ad 5 and 26.^ T h e juxtaposition of the two epithets sarvalaya and sarvacaracarastha points once again to the simultaneous transcendence and immanence of the Lord. The epithet sarvalaya is another formulation of SpK I 2: yatra sthitam idarn saivarp karyam [...], ‘[The One, i.e.,"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"KARIKA 169The foundation, the place of repose (viérântisthâna) of all this u n i­verse (sarva) [viz., ‘the place whereon reposes’, that is, ‘on which depends’, all this universe] — namely, this [manifest] world (Jagat), con­sisting of all cognizers, whether they be Rudras or ordinary souls, and, as well, of all objects of cognition (prameya) . 260For is it not well known 261 that this universe, which indeed is grounded in the universal knower (pürnapramâtf) [viz., the Lord, or conscious­ness],262 is nevertheless referred to in various ways, manifesting (prakàsa- maria) itself through difference, as though emerging263 [from the placid sea of unity], urged on by a pressing need 264 to articulate everything into pairs of knowers and knowns (grâhyagràhaka)?If this were not the case, this universe would not exist at all — for it would be on such hypothesis other than Light (prakàsa) .265Consciousness] in whom is situated all this product, i.e., all this world [produced by that Agent who is the Lord, or Consciousness ...] ’.260On jagat, see, esp., n. 465.2blkila — see Emeneau 1969: 2 4 Iff.

This fundamental principle will come up again in the discussion of kâ. 5, 7 and 8, as well as in kâ. 30 and its commentary, where it will be given as a formula, unfortunately truncated, quoted by YR: [...] nàprakâfah prakàfate, *[...] That which is not luminous cannot manifest itself [lit., ‘illu­mine’]’. — or ‘the absence of appearance does not appear’. Cf. SpN I 2: iha yat kincit [...] tadyadi na prakàJate na kincit, ‘Whatever is here, in this world, [...] if it does not shine forth [viz., appear], it is nothing [i.e., it does not exist]’; again in PS 49; also ÏPK I 5, 3b (quoted in SpN 1 5): prakctfâtmâ prakàéyo ’rtho nàprakàéaé ca siddhyad//, ‘The object that is made manifest [lit., ‘that is illumined’] has Light/consciousness for its essence.

The context in which ÎPV 11,5 quotes this verse (second hemistich) may aid in its understanding: paratvam kevalam upâdher de- hâdeh sa càpi vicàrito yàvan nànya iti vidvah pramàqvargah paramàrthata ekah pramàtà sa eva câsti/ tad üktam prakàfa evâsti svâtmanah svaparàtmabhir iti/ tatas ca bhagavân sadàfivo jà- nâtlty atahprabhfti krimir api jànàtityantam eka eva pramàtà, ‘Otherness only derives from limiting conditions such as the body, and these [limiting conditions themselves], as soon as they are investigated, [turn out] not [to be] different [from the universal Self]; therefore the"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"70TRANSLATIONReflection 266 on the pronoun [‘all’ (sarva)]267 gives rise to the ques­tion: ‘whence emerges this all (visva)?’268Yet, for all that, the nature of the Lord is not merely transcendent Csamuttirna); therefore the master says: ‘[You] w ho abide in all th a t m oves and all th a t moves n o t’, for he is ever present also in the form of this sentient and insentient universe, as has been said:Since You are indeed the creator of All, O You, who permeate all, therefore,You alone are this All.269In accordance with this rule, it makes no sense to posit as an effect some other unmanifest (aprakdiamana) entity that is not part of that [manifest­ing cause].270According to the Spandakarika:It is the [Lord] himself as the enjoyer who is, always and every­where, established in and through the objects of enjoyment,271it is the Lord himself who appears (cakasti), now one way, now another.entire crowd of knowers is, in truth, one knower, and this [knower] alone exists.

For the reasoning, see SpN I 2, quoted n. 265. See also the lost commentary of Somananda on the Pardtniika [PT], quoted in Paratrttikdvivarana [PTV] 4 (Singh PTV: 32, Skt. text): kim bahuna sarvam evdnuttaram anuttaratvat, ‘Why say more? All [this universe] is unsurpassed, because he [the Lord] is unsurpassed’.270For if it were an effect, it would ipso facto be manifest. YR presumes here a “w orld” that would not be part of the Lord, which would be nothing but an “effect” separated from him and therefore devoid of “luminosity”. But such a supposition contradicts itself, for how would such a “world” make itself known?

The term characterizes both an aesthetics (rasasvada) and a mystical experience (brahmasvada) — which are ‘analogically related, but differentiable’ (Gerow 1994: 188) — via a shared aspect: that o f ‘w onder’, ‘won­derm ent’. In the attem pt to understand or describe and name this experience, other concepts have been forged that emphasize its other dimensions, involving two main semantic fields: nirvjti, ‘serenity’, ananda, ‘bliss’, atmavUrdnti, ‘repose in the Self, on the one hand, and rasa, ‘flavor’, carvand, ‘delectation’ (lit., ‘mastication’), on the other. All these terms are com­mon to both fields of experience, even if they appear to have greater scope in aesthetics; see ABh ad VI 31, vol. I: 279, which justifies such technical terms on the basis of their common use: tatha hi loke sakalavighnavinirmukta samvittir eva camatkdranirveJarasandsvd- danabhogasamdpattilayavUrdntyddidabdair abhidhiyate, ‘For, in ordinary life, by the various words “w onderm ent” (camatkara), “immersion” (nirveda), “relishing” (rasand), “tasting” (d- svadana), “perfect realization of enjoyment” (bhogasamapattft, “absorption” (laya) [lit., ‘dis­solution’], “resting” (vtirdnti), etc., is expressed that [form of] consciousness which is free from any obstacle’; see Appendix 3, p. 320.273That is, by instrumentalizing the adventitious, ‘manifest’, ego in the quest for transcen­dence.

In fact, the primary sense of prakarana is ‘topic’ (asmin prakaranet etc.), but the term is employed, by synecdoche, to designate a text that introduces a topic, which therefore constitutes an ‘introduction’ to it that is considered elementary; the term also designates one of the ten types of rúpakaf which has for its subject “topical” m at­ters, that is, does not deal with otherworldly gods or heroes.

Here is an example of the methodology of Indian hermeneutics, whose objective is to establish, at the threshold of the text to be commented upon, the anubandhas, that is the 'preliminary considerations’ or ‘requisites’ as Hiriyanna translates the term in his edition of the Vedántasára (pp. 20 and 45), without which no study of šástra should be undertaken.

[The Lord] is the source (prabhava) [of this glorious display], its cause. Thus, the Lord mutually joins and disjoins, in an infinity of ways, all objective phenomena (âbhâsa) [lit., ‘appearances’, ‘manifestations’], which are [in reality] of the nature of consciousness and exist within him as identical with him [for they are noth­ing but his éaktis). He is [in that way] the cause of the manifestation and dissolution of the universe’. According to this interpretation, the conjunction, or fusion, of the Lord’s energies — of phenomena — amounts to the dissolution of the world, whereas their disjunction, or diffusion, amounts to the creation of the world in all its wonderful diversity. Such is also the explanation of Ràmakanfha: according to the SpV (p. 3) on the same SpK 1 1, the manifesta­tion (udaya) and the reabsorption (pralaya) of the world take place, respectively, through the extension (prasara) and the reabsorption (pralaya) of the Lord’s energies. In keeping with one of the traditional exegeses of SpK 11, Râmakantha demonstrates that the members of the two compounds unmefanimefàbhyâm and pralayodayau are organized as a chiasmus, with unmefa related to udaya and nime$a to pralaya: yasyonmesanimesâbhyâm iaktiprasarapralayâbhyàm jagato viivasya pralayodayau vinâiaprâdur bhâvau/ atra yathàsamkhyam na vivaksitam iti vak- çyàmah, ‘The reabsorption and the manifestation, that is, the end and the generation, of the world take place through the opening and shutting of his eye-lids, i.e., by the expansion and reabsorption ('prasarapralaya) of his energies. The meaning intended here involves a reversal in the order of words’. Note that the term yathàsamkhyam designates a principle of ordering two parallel lists in such a way that the terms of the second list mimic in order those in the first: ABCD abed (see P. I 3, 10). Ràmakanüia, here, observes that this principle is not ob­served in the present case. Moreover, YR commenting upon nijasaktivaibhavabharàt uses the same terminology, vaibhava explained as vicitrah prasarah. On the Wheel of energies whose circumference is the universe and the hub the divine Heart, see Ksemaraja (Spandasamdoha [SpS] ad SpK 1 1), and AG’s Dehasthadevatàcakrastotra, along with its extensive commentary by Silbum (pp. 89-97).

Creation, viewed as a tetrad of spheres, is a novel idea proper to Àgamas such as MVT. Although this concept of andacatusfaya may be seen as implicit in Sâipkhya, insofar as it is related to the doctrine of the tattvas that Sâmkhya does develop, it occurs here in an altogether different context, with an altogether different import: the tetrad of spheres is an ontological requirement of the system (see Appendix 5, p. 323)."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"78TRANSLATION(vastupinda), is so called inasmuch as it covers306 the universe as does a sheath (koša).

The term vastu is further explained in TÁ itself (VIII 176b-177a): [...] vastudabdena tanvak$a- bhuvanátmakam// růpam uktam yatas tena tatsamúho 'nda ucyate/ , ‘The word “entity** (vastu) refers to a form (rúpa) of bodies, faculties, or worlds. Thus, by this term, their assemblage is referred to, called anda, “envelope** [lit, “egg”]’. Thus, here, YR quotes a part of the much longer definition that TÁ VIII 169-170 borrows from the Raurava[ágama] . This cryp­tic quote is further glossed by TÁ X I171-172, which provides the key for understanding the concept: vastupinda iti proktarji divadaktisamúhabhák/ andah syád iti tadvyaktau sanunukhib- háva ucyate// tathápi divamagnánám daktinám andatd bhavet/ tadartham vdkyam aparam td hi na cyutadaktitah/ / , ‘Since this anda, which is (essentially] an assemblage of ¿iva’s energies, has been described as “aggregate of entities”, it is spoken of as their (energies’] objectifi­cation, in the process of manifestation. Even so (one may object], the condition of being anda could be predicated of the energies that are immersed in [i.e., that are one with] Šiva. For that reason [i.e., in order to avoid the fault of a too wide definition], another syntagm [qualifying anda, has been given, namely, pracyutah dakttivpatah, from which it may be in­ferred that] those [energies] have not deviated from their nature as energies [viz., being one with Siva]*. It results from such a definition that the anda, assuming the form of an ‘aggregate of entities’, namely, bodies, faculties, and worlds, is the first extemalization, or objectification, of the host of Šiva’s daktis. Furthermore, as the concretization of the Lord’s daktis, the anda is seen as a form given to the formless, hence as a cover, veiling the pure Light of the Self/consciousness, and further covering the world that it encompasses. Thus, the other aspect of the definition of anda consists in its being a cover (ácchádaka), a sheath (koda), as explained here by YR. Therefore, the definition given by YR synthesizes the two main features of anda: it represents a constriction permitting concretization of the Lord’s daktis; see Appendix 5, p. 323.308bhavanakarqtd, ‘[the Lord’s free] agency of becoming’ [lit, ‘faculty of exerting his power of becoming’], is the key word here, expressing the paradox of an Absolute (Paramaiiva, pure Being, perfect plenitude) who coexists with his own creation, necessarily external to him. The concept of an active being is thus adum brated, suitable for an Absolute that is both consciousness (prakdda) and self-consciousness (vimarda), self-consciousness seen as spanda, ‘vibration, pulsation*. The term occurs in ÍPvj I 5, 14 defining citi, ‘consciousness’, or ‘prin­ciple of consciousness’: sattd bhavattd bhavanakarqtd [...], ‘It [viz., consciousness, cm] is being, becoming, and agency of becoming* (compare Torella IPK: 122: i t is existing, being, the subject of the action of being’).

From both passages (IPvj-1 5, 14 and IPV IV 1, 6), it appears that bhavanakartfta stands as a synonym for sattd and sphuratta, the latter very closely related to spanda. As such it designates the highest iakti of the Lord, for sphuratta and spanda con­sist of nearly imperceptible, or extremely subtle, movement: kimciccalana. The kimcit’ tells us rather that the ‘movement’ at issue is not otherwise distinguished, which implies that it would be ascertainable only with difficulty, for to perceive it would be to impute to it some characteristics, a direction, an intensity, etc. — thus justifying the translation gener­ally adopted, ‘imperceptible* or ‘subtle’ (movement).

While explaining this notion to K. D. Tripathi orally, Rame^vara Jha used to add that this negation (nisedha) was a ‘pure negation’ (duddhananartha), for, at this stage, nega­tion does not require any opposing reference (pradyogin): there is nothing else than the Self to be negated. See also YR ad 10-11.315The form of experience that takes place at the junction of the dakdtattva and the sadddi- vatattva is named Anairitaiiva, ‘¿iva unrelated [to the universe]’; see Appendix 7, p. 327.316anda is not merely the ‘envelope’, which, limiting the ultimate reality, determines dif­ferent levels of experience; it is also seen as a fullyfledged loka, a ‘sphere’, as it is often translated (Silbum PS), inhabited by a multitude of beings and things, under the control of presiding deities, and related to the hierarchy of the tattvas.

The master answers: ‘[a continuum of] w o n ­derfully varied [bodies, faculties, and w orlds]’.By bodies, he means shapes characterized by various arrangements of face, hands, feet, etc., and differing [from each other] according to the [in­finite] varieties of [beings, from] Rudras to ordinary souls,327 all of which are made wonderful by the manner of their differentiated conditions.328Similarly, faculties, such as eyes, have [degrees of] excellence due to the difference from one to another [being].For instance, endowed as they are with a host of attributes,329 such as omniscience, the faculties of cognizers on the order of Rudras (rudrapra- mâtr) are unsurpassed. This universe is indeed instantly and simultane­ously known and created by such faculties.On the contrary, this universe is neither known nor made by the [cor­responding] faculties of ordinary souls which are capable only of knowing and making objects such as jars, for they are restricted [in their function] by the power of [causal] constraint [that is, the constraint imposed by causal consecution, the sequence of cause and effect] (niyatisakti) 330 be­longing to the Supreme Lord.And even there [viz., among ordinary souls], ascetics (yogin) are seenfrom the Rauravâgama (or from its commentary by Sadyojyotis, as proposed by Gnoli TÂ: 183, n. 4), as is made clear by the commentary. Then comes AG’s own explanation, in TÀ V III171-174.327See Appendix 1, p. 317. Both categories are ‘em bodied’ (dehin) subjects, yet the differ­ence between them is established on the basis of the hierarchy of the faculties and knowledge. Being omniscient (sarvajfia), Rudras will not be reborn after dissolution, unlike kçetrajnas, whose limited Knowledge (they take the body to be the Self) destines them to be reborn. Rudra [or the Rudras], as a type of being, signifies those who have reached, after the model of Rudra, a level of experience where one is able to reabsorb within himself all cognizable reality. Hence they will be described in the following lines of the commentary as possessed of unsurpassed knowledge and powers (see, n. 324, the definition of bhagavat), whereas the knowledge and the faculties of the kçetrajna are limited. Nevertheless, the yogin possesses relatively more powers. The same may be said, to some extent, of beasts, for they may be more powerful physically than men, even if their knowledge is not superior. PS 49 develops the theme of the variety of bodies.328samsthâna.329guna.330The Self, within the realm of mâyâ, is enclosed by five kancukas, among which is niyati, the restriction of the freedom of the Lord: the One beyond causal relationship is now limited by the law of causality, which is ‘at the root of the law of karm an’ (niyatir yatah karmano mûlabhümih) (ÎP W III 2, 3, vol. Ill: 312). Cf. ÏPvj- III 2, 2: màyîyah [...] pramâtà niyatyà karmàdhïnah samsàri, ‘The màyic cognizer [...] depending on the karma because of the law of necessity is in the power of the samsara [...]’ (tr. Torella ÎPK: 197). Hence the translations of niyati as ‘determinism’ (Mtéra 1993: 175), ‘causal restriction’ (Silbum PS: index), ‘necessity’ (Torella IPK: 197). Yet, one can see, even so, a difference between niyati and niyatidakti: inasmuch as everything arises from the Lord, niyati as a category is called ‘tatrva’, whereas niyatiiakti is a potentiality of the Lord.

Thus one may infer that there is everywhere a wonderful variety of faculties.Similarly, there are w orlds (bhuvana), well known to the Ágamas, that are distinguished [from the norm] by their circular, triangular, quadran­gular, semilunar and parasol-like shapes.333Thus the universe is such that within it is contained an u n in terru p ted continuum , an unobstructed flowing stream ,334 of bodies, faculties and w orlds — [bodies, faculties and worlds that are] w onderfully varied, or of a marvelous nature, due to their varied extraordinary qualities.Here, in such a universe, whose nature it is to be enjoyed, an enjoyer must be presumed. Therefore, the master says: ‘And, therein, the e n ­joyer, endow ed w ith a body [is Siva himself]*.Being the abode wherein are enjoyed [the results of past actions], the body belonging to the finite soul (anu)335 is affected by the three impu­331 Cf. SK 7, which enumerates eight causes making perception impossible, among which are adduratva, ‘excessive distance’, and vyavadhdna, ‘interposition [of an object between an organ and the object to be perceived]’. This question will be taken up again by YR ad 17, in the course of explaining vidydtattva. viprakfsta is opposed to samnik[$ta, whose philosophical implication is the proximity of an organ of sense to its object.332For an elaborate discussion of this point, see SpP 39 [= ad 111 7, in the textual organi­zation of SpN].333See SvT X 99a: chatrákáráni sarvání te$ám vai bhuvandni tu. On the various descriptions of and ways of counting bhuvanas in the Ágamas, see Appendix 5, p. 323, and YR ad 78.334However, the four spheres themselves, within which the entirety of the various worlds, along with their specific bodies and organs, is created and dissolved, remain immovable.335First occurrence of this concept in the commentary. The use of ‘anu’ here recalls the term ’s usage in Vaiie$ika, where it designates the ultimate and individible constituents of all “things” — ipso facto therefrom composed. By extension, it designates also the ‘atom ic’ soul (or rather “souls”), indivisible and reproducible infinitely, the constituents of the psychic universe. If our present authors are using the term in cognizance of its Vai¿e$ika origins, it would indicate then consciousness that is not omniscient, which functions in the inadequacy of always partial awareness — not only limited but also incompetent. According to Gonda (1960-1964, vol. II: 235ff.), the notion of the ‘anu’ — which is common to all the versions of"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"KARIKA585rities. That [finite soul is thus said to be] em bodied (dehin), that is, is endowed with a body (saririn) ,336 whose nature consists in the experience of pleasure and pain, etc.In this universe consisting of pleasure and pain, etc., that [embodied soul] is also called the ‘enjoyer* {bhoktr), that is, who experiences {ana- bhavitr) 337 pleasure and pain, etc. — the fettered subject (pafupramatr).Now, one may object: — inasmuch as there is [according to you] no difference attaching even to that which appears infinitesimal — as far as the transcendental cognizer (parapramdtr) is concerned) — 338 how indeed can this worthless thing we call ‘embodied’ be different from him? For, as has been said:Even a part represents the universality of brahman [viz., its capacity to assume all forms]. Neither has it been exceeded, nor can it be diminished.339¿aivism — is not so much understood as a concrete existent, as it may well have been in the Vaise$ika, as a designation of a principle in terms of which is explained an aspect — in any case illegitimate — of the soul’s existence: the soul, which is in reality unlimited, identical with brahman, sees itself as detached therefrom, enclosed in a body. It is that very soul, seen in this way as ‘anu’, ‘atomic’, that constitutes the dnavamala.336A traditional etymology derives ia n ra, ‘body’, from //: iiryata id ¿arirah, ‘That which decays, is the body’.337Derived from bhuj, ‘to enjoy, possess, eat, consume’, the term bhoktf designates the ‘en- joyer’ of an object, its possessor, whether it be internal (as pleasure and pain) or external (as the color blue). Thus he is the subject of sense experiences, bound to experience those objects, w hether agreeable or not. In general usage, anubhava is also conceived of as an em ­pirical experience, even though, when contrasted with bhoga, it signifies an experience more receptive than acquisitive, in which the ego does not assume the dominant role, or, at least, in which personal interest is not primary. Nevertheless, such an experience is considered “mine”, that is, does not exceed the ambit of the finite subject. The Trika system appears to invest the notion with a meaning different from ordinary usage, to the extent that it as­sociates anubhava with the ultimate principle, which has the result of dissociating this type of experience from corporeal enjoyments, in principle at least. Hence the recurring contrast between bhoga and anubhava, between bhoktf and anubhavitp the anubhavitf is also an ex- periencer, but of ideal objects only — his “use” of them is ideational, rather than corporeal. This is confirmed by SpN 1 3 (quoted n. 253), where anubhavitf glosses upalabdhf, whose meaning, in the context of SpK I 3, is that of ‘pure agent of experience’; cf. SpV I 5, p. 30: grdhako fpi mayiyah pramata atra vivak$ito na tattvika upalabdhpndtrasvarupah, ‘By “subject” (grahaka), what is meant here is the empirical subject (mayiyah pramata), not the real one, who is the pure agent of experience’.338That is, given that the Lord is [according to you] absolutely undifferentiated, how would [in that case] one be able to conceive even the atom as differing from him? By the same token as applying to “Parama&va” or uparabrahmann, the term parapramatf is also hyperbolic, for, at this ultim ate level, there is no other “pramdtf ” possible. However, given the origins of the term and its cognates in discussions elsewhere of concrete and therefore limited experience, the term parapramatf does have the flavor here of an oxymoron, plainly accepted in the Kashmiri schools in order to distinguish ¿iva’s unlimited cognition from that of ordinary knowers — in reference to whom the term “pramatf” may be understood literally — albeit that the limitations on their “knowledge”, being self-imposed, are on no wise inherent.339avikalpya — li t, ‘dichotomized, subject to altem ativity’.

In our interpretation of the verse, we differ from Silbum, Padoux TÀ: 148: ‘Le propre du brahman, c’est de prendre toutes les formes, d ’être insurpassable et sans qualités’ [— ‘What is proper to brahman is to assume all the forms, to be unsurpassable and devoid of qualities’]. Formulated in the manner of a sütra, this verse (of uncertain provenance) has been variously cited and interpreted. The logic that seems to underlie it is that the ‘part’ in truth does not exist, for all ‘parts’ are already the Lord; each ‘part’ then, being incipiently the ‘all* may accept qualifications normally reserved to the ‘all’, such as avikalpya ‘not subject to mental constructs, or to altem ativity’. Some citations of the verse (AG’s, in his commentary ad BhG XV 7, in particular) do not include avikalpya, but end with anatikrantah, which suggests that the participle may have been understood in active voice (with sârvarûpyam as its direct object); cited however in conjunction with avikalpya (so YR), the passive construction appears more likely. YR cites again the same verse in his gloss ad 43. This verse occurs, shortened and slightly altered, in PTV 5-8, where it is followed by the same maxim as is here quoted by the fancied objector pradeéamàtram api brahmanah sarvarüpam/ekaikatrâpi ca tattve fattrimJatiattvamayatvam éâstresu nirüpitam/, ‘Even a part of brahman is endowed with all forms [here we differ from Singh who translates: ‘Even a limited space contains the entire form of the Brahman’]. The A stras have stated that each tattva has the characteristics of all thirty-six tattvas'. AG quotes it again (pradeéo ’pi brahmanah sârvarûpyam anatikrantah) in his gloss ad BhG XV 7, explaining that references to a ‘part’ (amia, in v. 7) of the partless brahman are intended for heuristic purposes only. In the form in which it appears in YR’s commentary, the statem ent is more than once referred to by TÀV1 165, III 45-46, IV 98, XII5, XXVIII375 (in the context of aesthetic experience). In TÀV III 45-46, in the course of expounding the pratibimbavâda, it is referred to in the way it is found here, in YR’s commentary, that is, immediately followed by the second maxim (with variant: ekaikasyâpi tattvasya (...]). We surmise that the statem ent might derive from the Kashmirian nondualist Saiva tradition, since TÀV IV 98, while explaining the PTV’s reference to Castras’, introduces it as follows: yad vâ parâdvayadariane, ‘Or, as is said in the doctrine of transcendent nonduality [ ...]’. However, AG, in his gloss ad BhG XV 7, introduces it as belonging to éruti.340For other citations of the text, see previous note, and PM 25 which attributes it to TÀ. According to one etymology, each and every tattva is the ‘extension’ (tanana < tan) of ¿iva (see YR ad 10-11 and n. 433). Therefore, from Siva to earth, every tattva has the form of the thirty-six tattvas. The theory of causality espoused here is the satkâryavâda, developed at length in PTV 5-8 (Singh: 45-48 (Skt. text], 113-118 [transi.]), according to which the effect preexists potentially in the cause. Therefore, every tattva is present in the others, either as potency (pfthivf, the final tattva, is latent in £iva, the first one) or as manifestation (when manifested, p/thivi is nothing but ¿iva).

There is, in consequence, nothing to which language can refer345 that is other than Šiva.346Moreover, it is the Lord himself, it is Šiva, who makes manifest the pair of cognizer and object of cognition [again] characterized as enjoyer and object of enjoyment, in his freedom, as if they were toys for playing (kridanaka).341 Example of reducdo ad absurdum.342kimparatvena.343satattva.

YR’s usage seems consistent with this general principle inasmuch as, here, the very multiplicity of the attested world (including all substances, attributes, and actions) is viewed as freely (but not necessarily) ‘conditioned’ on the Lord’s will.

This pair of verses has been variously interpreted by Buddhist commentators themselves: among them, Manorathanandin (whom we have followed in our translation) and Prajnàkaragupta, followed by Masahiro Inami, in an article entitled ‘Non­dual Cognition’ to appear in Proceedings of the Fourth International Dharmakïrti Conference (Vienna, forthcoming), which has been brought to our attention by Prof. Eli Franco, one of the editors. Inami translates the verses as follows (cited with the author’s permission): ‘In a variegated cognition, a color such as blue, which is a qualifier of the cognition, cannot be known to be unaccompanied by other [colors]. One who distinguishes it [from other colors] is focusing on the [external] objects [not on the cognition] [III 220]. The cognition is experienced exactly in the manner in which it appears. Therefore, the variegated image in cognition should be singular [or, as suggested by Eli Franco: ‘the cognition which has a variegated form is singular (viz., it is the cognition which is said to be singular, not the form)’] [III 221]’. The major difference of interpretation relates to the term ananyabhàk, which Inami subordinates in idea to the following compound, alakyadarsanah, understand­ing it (as it were) as expressing the content of that ‘cognition’ that is impossible — ‘cannot be known [d/tf- here understood as jnd-] to be unaccompanied by other [colors]’ — whereas we have related it to the verse’s subject, jnànopàdhih, as, apparently, does Manoratha also.

But this is only the377Cf. APS 17, evidently followed here by our author — although its first hemistich is slightly different, as the sun is there mentioned rather than the moon. As the moon does not depend for its existence upon the w ater in which it is reflected, so the Lord does not depend upon the play of differentiation. It is diversity that fluctuates, not the Lord. Silbum translates bimba by 'reflet’ (‘reflection’), and omits iva. Our translation is based on the commentary, which develops the meaning of iva, and clearly distinguishes bimba from pratibimba ‘reflec­tion’. In fact, the logic of the complete simile requires to understand himakarabimbam as the ‘orb of the moon’, instead of the ‘reflection of the moon’, as does Silbum, for what has to be dem onstrated is the absolute, eternal, nature of the Lord, or Self. Thus the complete simile is to be understood as follows: the moon stands for the Lord, or the Absolute, its reflection for the limited Self, water for the phenomenal world. Cf. SpP 3 (p. 13), in the context of the discussion on avasthas: vellatsu pratibimbesu jalaspandanuvanisu/ yathendor na kriydveJas tatha ’tra paramatmanah//, ‘Although its moving reflections dance in consonance with the vibrations of w ater, the moon does not indulge in any action.

Thus nàyam bhütvà bhavità và na bhùyah is a way of emphasizing and unpacking the first statem ent — na jàyate mriyate và kadàcit — by making it clear that this Self is beyond temporality, i.e., beyond the sequentiality hinted at here by the double use of the absolutive and of the periphrastic future — although one has to be suspicious of this interpretation, for abhavità cannot be a periphrastic future, according to Pâninean grammar. The negative form of such a future would be na bhavità (see Renou 1968: §134, for some ex­ceptions). For this reason, Edgerton finds £’s explanation implausible, é's commentary is the following: yasmâd ayam àtmà bhütvà bhavakriyàm anübhùya pafcàd abhavità ’bhàvam gantà na bhùyah punas tasmàn na mriyate/ yo hi bhütvà na bhavità sa mriyate ity ucyate loke, ‘Since it is not that this Self, after having come into being, i.e., after having experienced the process of existence, will thereafter cease to be, i.e., will thereafter (bhùyah = punah) become non­existent, therefore it does not die.

There­fore it is not bom. [For] the one who comes into existence, after having been non-existent, is said to be bom. The Self is not like this; therefore it is not b om ’. Cf. AG’s commentary on the same passage, where the exegete proves to be a more scrupulous grammarian than é, although he offers essentially the same explanation: na jàyate mriyate và kadàcit/ etad eva sphutayati — nàyam bhùtveti/ ayam àtmà na na bhütvà bhavitàpi tu bhütvaiva/ ato na jàyate na ca mriyate / yato bhütvà na na bhavitàpi tu bhavitaiva/, * “Neither is this [Self] ever bom nor does it ever die”.

Finally, in the last statement: ‘this Self is not destroyed (or ‘killed’ (hanyate)i ‘slained’, as Edgerton translates], when the body is destroyed*, hanyate is to be understood as ‘transformed’, in order to avoid a tautology with mriyate in the first line.

The Self is apprehended only in course of the cognitive process, that is, when it is reflected in the mirror of the intellect, for, in statements such as ‘I hear a sound’, ‘I’ stands for the Self/consciousness, even though this *1’ represents but the limited self. This amounts to saying that universal consciousness, although all-pervasive, becomes manifest in the puryaftakapramdtf only, i.e., in the finite being endowed with subtle body, as will be further explained by YR. This puryastaka is the aggregate of the five tanmatras, here termed visayas, and the three constituents of the antahkarana (buddhi, manas, ahankara) — thus meriting its name, ‘octad in the fortress’, viz., the eightfold, or eight-factored, sub­tle body within the gross body, itself seen as the ‘fortress’ of the purusa. The list of eight constituents of the puryastaka differs from text to text, cf. B&R, s.v. (which quotes a medi­cal text): bhutendriya/mano/buddhi/vasand/karma/vayu, and, as the eighth, avidya\\ see also Torella IPK: 204-205. The puryastaka is responsible for the patu's experience, or cognition, formed of the complex of objects (visaya) and their corresponding faculties of cognition (jna- nendriya), through which the limited cognizer comes to know himself as ‘I* in virtue of the experience: i hear a sound’.

Both the jnanendriyas and the tanmatras proceed from the antahkarana, and especially from the ahahkara, for the jnanendriyas, realized in the form ‘I hear*, necessarily refer to an T (YR ad 20).

On speculations about this process, and the functions which it implies, see PS 19; also YR ad 94-95, which, through a striking description of the dysfunction of antahkarana and bahyakaranas at the moment of death, is very useful for understanding their role in the cognitive process.402sthitah son sphutarupah.403tamas is darkness, lethargy, as well as metaphorical darkness, ignorance.

Or let us suppose them not endowed with such knowledge [viz., that of the Self], there being no basis for any distinction [among knowers].409Yet, even at the level of phenomenal existence, there are some who, having attained the knowledge of their proper Self (svdtmajfidna) are liber­ated while still living [in a physical body] (jivanmukta), and are endowed with omniscience and omnipotence;410 and there are some who are wor­thy of attaining the knowledge of their proper Self and are desirous of making the ascent,411 whereas others, lacking the knowledge of their ownditions.

These two functions, or energies/powers (spoken of as tirodhánašakti and anugrahašakti) respectively explain bondage — the manifes­tation of ¿iva as the host of the sentient limited souls and the insentient objects of the world — and liberation.

On this account, these [others] are called ‘tethered’ [an­imals, pasu] and ‘bound to transmigrate’ (samsarika).And still others are cognizers desirous of ascending, because of the con­junction of both energies [that of obscuration and that of grace, bestowed on them by the Lord].Thus, in all such cases, the variation in [the Lord’s] grace may be pre­417The translation reflects, for these three notions, the same point of view, which is that of the fettered subject; the three ‘stains’ are certainly erroneous but at the same time are voluntary, imposed on ourselves by ourselves, and by no other, of w hatever sort; see n. 317, an hypothesis on the correspondence of the three malas with three forms of being: sattd, bhavatta, bhavanakartftd.

For nothing that is based on difference is suited to serve as means to that [liberation, viz., identity with the Self], since the Self has passed beyond rndya. 421As it has been sung:Not by the Vedas, nor by austerity,/ Nor by gifts or acts of worship,/ Can I [be seen in such a guise,/ As thou hast seen M e].422Therefore, accordingly, the favor of the Supreme Lord is the only gen­uine (akrtrima) cause [of liberation for] those whose intellects are worthy420‘Variation in [the Lord’s) grace’ here refers, not to to differing intensities of the Lord’s grace, but to the levels of receptivity of the adept. Similarly, the same fire will have quite different effects on dry and wet paper. We have here, admittedly, an explanation of the inexplicable: on one hand, divine grace is the same for all, unconditioned (višpňkhala); on the other, nevertheless, is observed in the “real” world a hierarchy of subjects, which is a function of each subject’s degree of aptitude in receiving that grace. Thus YR distinguishes three large categories: on one extreme, the jivanmukta, on the other, the pašu or samsárin, whose submission to worldly concerns makes him insensible to the actions of grace, and be­tween these two extremes, the árurukfu (or mumuksu), whose efforts toward delivrance open him up to the Lord’s grace, but whom diverse factors — his native intelligence, or chance interruptions in his practice (see ká. 98-102) — deter from an efficacious and immediate reception of grace. We have here another version of the Mtwo truths”: the paramárthasatya and the samvpisatya, transcendent truth, and empirical truth. The distinction between the subject destined to liberation and the subject condemned to be reborn is not a function of the intention of the god — so says the text cited below by YR himself: ‘As far as the Lord’s grace is concerned, his intention (d/u) requires nothing [as a precondition), for it proclaims his independence (svatantrata) [...)*. There remains the question of the distinction between anugrahašakti and tirodhánašakti. The former is manifested in the form of the ‘descent of en­ergy’ (Šaktipáta). The second is instrumental in effectuating mdyd, which is responsible for the finitude of the samsárin. But the principle underlying the exercise of either šaktí is the sovereign liberty of the Lord. Similarly, the term višpikhala, applied to šaktipáta in the avat., may also be understood in this sense: the grace dispensed by the Lord is ‘free’, not merely in that it is unconditioned, but also in that it has no other cause than the sovereign liberty of the divinity. An explanation that may well be opened to the objection that it explains nothing, but to which one might respond that the dogma of the Lord’s liberty is at the very heart of Trika doctrine. The same debate, expressed in almost the same terms, occurs in the commentary on ká. 96-102; see, esp., the avat. to 96 and 97.421 Cf. YR ad 18 and 96: ‘the acquisition of the knowledge of one’s own Self has for its unique means the favor of the Supreme Lord’.422BhG XI 53.

That is to say, though manifesting itself (cakasat), it is shown by reasoning not to be different from that [principle]. Now, as to this view, [the following objection may be raised:]— [The word tattva is thus derived:] ‘that where the whole (sarva) con­sisting of bodies, etc. [scil., faculties and worlds], is spread out (tanyate) [is called “tattva”]’; 433 alternatively, because of its ‘extension’ (tananat), it is what ‘extends’ (tat) up until [the world’s] dissolution; “tat-tva” is then ‘the state or condition of that [extended thing, viz., the ultimate princi­ple]’. 434In either case, the word tattva conveys something insentient.435 How,432Compare PS 11 with APS 25: sarvavikalpanahmah iuddho buddho 'jardmarah iantah/ amalah sakfd vibhatas cetana atma khavad vydpf//.433Both derivations of the word tattva referred to here by the purvapak$in are from the root tan, ‘to spread, extend, expand’. The first, in passive voice, makes tattva an object, an effect of the Lord’s activity. However, the word does not designate concrete diversity per se, but rather ‘where the entire manifestation is extended’ — the categories whereby the infinite va­rieties of phenomena are ordered; tattva is thus a factor of classification (vargjkarananimitta), an element unifying a collection of distinct entities, as stated in IPV III 1, 2, vol. II: 219: yatha girivfksapuraprabhfdnam nadisarahsagarddinam ca pfthivtrupatvam abrupatvam ced, ‘For instance, mountain, tree, city, etc., are earth by essence, whereas river, lake, ocean, e tc , are w ater by essence’.434K$emaraja’s definition of tattva in his Svacchandatantroddyota [SvTU] ad SvT IV 241-242 (vol. II: 74) — the terminology is almost the same — makes YR’s commentary more intelligi­ble by adopting the exegetic method associated with nirukti: tasya bhavas tananat tattvam id vyutpattyd niruktyd ca, ‘tattva is so called for it is “extension” (tanana), according to etymol­ogy (niruktya); and from the point of view of morphological derivation (vyutpattyd), it means the state or condition of that [which “extends” (tat))’ — that is, tattva is derived from the root tan. It is (barely) possible that this tat could have been understood as the root noun of the root tan (tanod), in weak grade (and so shorn of its nasal, cf. ga-ta), with tugdgama (that is — the stem-extension t[uk)), as would be normal after a short vowel (cf. viiva-kf-t). See also TAVIX 1, vol. IV: 1637: tanod sarvam id tatparam rupam tasya bhavas tattvam ity arthah, ‘[The term] tattva is thus explained: [the element] tat means ‘that which extends to every­thing’, [namely) the ultim ate form [of the universe); [by affixing thereto the abstract suffix -tva, one obtains the sense:] ‘the state (or condition) of that [extended entity (or supreme form) — that is, the principle of expansion itself]’. Thus, tattva refers either to classified objectivity, or to transcendental subjectivity, although, ultimately, all tattvas are absorbed into that wherefrom they proceed, the Supreme Lord, or ultim ate principle (paratattva), de­fined as ‘that which expands’. See also n. 506. Historical linguistics of the modem sort of course does not approve such etymologies, preferring the straightforward derivation tat-tva ‘this-ness’.435W hether phenomenal category or ultim ate principle, tattva is always understood as exist­ing in space and time (as paratattva, it ‘expands till dissolution’). As demonstrated elsewhere (YR ad 6 and 10-11), spatiality and temporality are insentient, unless taken as the very powers of the Lord.

It is that w hose form, whose proper nature, is radiance, is Light: of it the form is that of great Light: that is the meaning.And, it is com plete [or all-encom passing] (paripurna), that is, it wants nothing [to complete itself, is free of dependency] (nirakanksa).437 [In this respect, it might be alleged:] — but also are free of dependency such things as crystal-gems, mirrors, etc., which are insentient.Therefore, the master says: ‘suprem ely blissful (mahdnanda) on ac­co u n t o f reposing in itself’, that is, it is endowed with great bliss, with supreme felicity,438 due to the fact that it reposes in its own true nature, [informed by] the delight (rasa) that arises from the state of unfragmented wonder that is [supreme] ipseity (akhandahantacamatkdra) .439Thus, because its essence is supreme, beatific splendor (sphuratta), [which needs no other source of light], its difference is [sufficiently] stated in respect of inanimate entities such as crystal, which must be illumined [from without].Therefore the master says further: ‘suffused w ith th e [energies of] Will, Knowledge and Action*.The energies of Will, Knowledge, and Action440 constitute its nature;festation, being nothing but phenomenal plurality, implies that the Lord has abandoned his own essential nature, pure consciousness. In this way, plurality implies insentience.436Same term and discussion in YR ad 14.437Barnett and Silbum translate paripurna as ‘perfect*. But ‘complete* appears more ap­propriate here, in the light of the commentary which explains it as nirakarikfa, ‘desireless, wanting nothing [to fill it up, viz., complete]*. The term akdhksa, ‘expectation’, borrowed from grammar, designates that which — like a transitive verb — “expects** a complement — its “direct object** — and is therefore in itself incomplete. Commenting upon both ic- chdsamvitkaranair nirbharitam and anancaJaktiparipurnam, YR again understands the term to mean ‘completely filled with innumerable energies’. Same sequence in YR ad 65.438His freedom from dependency is not just a negative condition. He is also characterized as supreme bliss itself; see Intr., p. 29, and p. 46.439Similarly IPK I 5, 11 makes reflective awareness (vimaria/pratyavamatia), experienced as wonder (camatkara), the factor distinguishing the Lord or universal consciousness from insentient objects such as crystal. Although the latter are colored by objects just as con­sciousness is, they are not aware of it.440Paramaiiva is inseparable from his supreme energy {paraiakti), which is also named svatantryadakti, energy of absolute freedom. Since this svatantryalakti transforms itself into icchdfaka, jnanaiakti and kriyadakti, in succession, Param aiiva may be said to be ‘of the nature of the energies of Will (tcc/td), Knowledge (jnana), and Action (kriyd)’.

These 'innum erable (ananta or aše$a) energies’ are also termed the 'Wheel of energies’ (šakticakra), which SpN III 13, while defining parávác, describes as ‘composed of enlargements of the \"six paths” — [enlarged] by means of innumerable words and objects to which they refer [appear­ing and disappearing to the rhythm] of uninterrupted series of manifestation and disso­lution [...]* ([..,] svikftánantavácyavácakarúpasadadhvaspháramayášesašaktícakrakrodikárán- tahk[tanihše$asargapralayádiparampará[...]).

SpK III 13 em pha­sizes, as explained by the Nirnaya, the deluding power of those verbal šaktis, responsible for the servitude of the pašu, ‘deprived of his might by limited words and ideas’ (saipkuci- taih šabdair jňánaiš ca viluptavibhavah).

The Lord’s svátantryašakú, seen as parávác, supreme Speech, having divided itself into the three energies of Will, Knowledge and Action, assumes the forms of vowels and consonants. Thus it becomes Mátfká, the ‘Mother’ of phonemes, w hether uttered or not, and presides over the deities, such as Mahesvari, etc., who reign over the eight groups of phonemes, also called mátpkás. The name máqká, w hether applied to a single entity or to many, connotes not only the ‘m other’ of the words, but also of the worlds, inasmuch as the multitude of words entails the multitude of objects by them denoted. As shown by MVT III 5-13 (see Appendix 9, p. 329), Brahml, e tc , seen as energies, spring forth from the triad of icchá,jňána and kriyá. Similar development in YR ad 64-66; also ŠSV III 19, TA III 198-200a.444ŠSV II 13 defines the Lord as ‘šabdaráši, mass [lit., ‘heap’, implying an undifferentiated totality] of sounds, whose essence consists of a pulsating radiance, the nature of which is the reflective awareness of the fullness of the [absolute] “I”, inseparable from the totality of the universe’ (bhagaván šabdaráših tasyayá sattá ašefavišvábhedamayapúrnáhamvimaršanátmá sphurattá); tr.

But aprakáša becomes prakáša as soon as one supposes it to be aprakáša. AU is Light, and this Light is ultimately pure ipseity, as such free of all mental constructs.

The meaning of the term vyavacchedaka is best grasped in the context of the notion of the pratiyogin — for it too is a relational term, whose pratiyogin is the vyavacchedya. The relation is that of ‘qualification to thing qualified’, understood in a way such that the existence of the one is somehow determined or limited by the existence of the other — for example, the ‘Indian cow’ and the ‘dew lap’ (whose relationship appears to be without exception, and therefore may serve in a definition), or the ‘bird’ and the ‘branch’ (on which it perches, which relationship is merely occasional, and therefore serves only to distinguish the bird from other birds). The relation is thus (as are all relations) shared by the two relata, and belongs to neither one exclusively, w hatever be the manner of their coexistence. In the present context, this language is used to emphasize that “light” (prakada) can have n opratiyogint and is therefore “unqualified” absolute. Cf. V&mana, quoted in SpN II 3-4 (see n. 902).452SpK II 3b.

Since the exposition of the pratibimbavâda is dealt with in the TÀ in the context of the exposition of the éâmbhâvopàyat and is placed there under the aegis of Bhairava, it may be inferred that PS 12-13 amounts to a cryptic exposition of the éâmbhâvopâya — in order to be liberated inthe ‘way of Sambhu’, one must realize mystically that the universe has no nature apart from being a reflection in the divine consciousness.

On the other hand, one of the glosses of the word given the same dictionaries is jangama, which suggests that a sentim ent of intensification has also been associated with jagat. Thus the word sug­gests, even more strongly than sarva, that the “world” is here to be understood distributively, as the ‘incessant going and coming’ of differentiated being; see its frequent occurrence in the phrase: $attrimfatattvatmakam jagat, for instance in avat. ad 14, YR ad 1 and 46 (avat.).466It is only in the mirror that the appearance of multiplicity is possible; without the mirror, there would be no presentation of multiplicity. In order for the comparison to support the thesis here propounded, and in order to understand the verse above, one must forget that a “real” mirror implies objects beyond or outside it. In this mirror reflections alone are at issue, and, qua reflections, their sole support is the mirror itself; see TA III 21b: [...] vastu bhavati tato *py anyatra napy alam/ / , ‘[the reflected image] is a [real] thing, which does not exist apart from that [mirror]*.AS7svayam."},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"114TRANSLATIONreflected in the mirror, appear as different [from each other], inasmuch as they are also different from the m irror.468For, although the mirror is composed of those various reflections, it appears (cakasti) as [different] from those reflections, for its own nature transcends them. And it is not understood as composed of them in such a way as to convey the idea that no mirror exists.Everyone has an unsublated perception that ‘this is a mirror’, even as he apprehends the various objects therein reflected. Nor is it the case that the [image of the] jar, etc., qualifies the mirror in such fashion that the essential nature [of the mirror] would be abrogated [— as it would if one were to say]: ‘this mirror is suitable for [reflecting] a j a r ’ [scil., ‘... and not a cloth’], and ‘this mirror is suitable for [reflecting] a cloth’ [‘... and not a j a r ’]. The difference consequent upon time and space [‘causes’ of the variability of the reflections] does not thus eventuate in the loss of the [mirror’s] essential n ature.469 Therefore, being tolerant of those reflections, the mirror remains nothing but a mirror, as regards itself.470 There is thus no defect attaching to the doctrine of reflection [viz., of the reflected image] (pratibimbavdda).Now, it might be said that this reflection is nothing but an error (bhran- ti). Indeed, when an elephant is perceived in the mirror, it is not that an elephant is found in the mirror [rather, there is something like an elephant, in the form of its reflection], for, since no consequence which is fruitful471 [can be attributed to the elephant in the mirror] such as would in fact [pertain to an actual elephant], the conclusion (niicaya) [that ‘this is an elephant’] would be simply an error.[Let it be said here only that] the example is valid to the extent that the doctrine of reflection is valid.

Thus the illustration is complete — the reflections of objects, however numerous they are, also need the mirror.469Were it necessary to employ a special m irror to reflect each different object, then, of course, it would have been legitimate to say that its 'nature’ had indeed been affected by the nature of the object470svdtmani — o r '... its nature’.471 arthakriyd.472It will be explained later what is an error, and how reflection is not an error.473The example (dtffanta) has been explained.

Yet, it is not the case that they serve to differentiate the very nature [of consciousness]. Therefore, consciousness, although appearing both one and multiple, is one only, just as variegated cognitions are grasped by [one] consciousness.474Nevertheless, between the Light of consciousness (citprakafa) — en­dowed as it is with the state of wonder [that is supreme ipseity] 475 — and the light of the mirror, there is the following difference — viz., the city, etc., that is judged to be different [from the mirror] as a reflection, appears in the perfectly pure mirror only as external to it, but is in no way created by the mirror. Thus the conclusion that ‘this is an elephant’ [as applying to what is seen] in the mirror would be erroneous.476On the other hand, Light [viz., consciousness], whose essence is the marvelous experience of itself, makes manifest (abhdsayati) on its own surface Csvatmabhitti), and out of its own free will, the universe, whose material cause is that same consciousness, by considering (paramrsat) that474All variety — the city itself — is comprehended in and by consciousness, single and unique, which serves as the basis of that variety. Compare the elegant argum ent on this issue developed by ¿ahkara in his Upadedasahasn.475l.e., endowed with vimaria, or spanda. Consciousness, or Light, vibrates, realizing itself as consciousness, whereas the insentient mirror is neither aware of itself nor of the reflections it receives from outside.476This remark follows from the discussion of arthakriyd, above. The “image\" (usually des­ignated by the term dkdra) of the elephant, w hether that of the mirror or a picture, represents only its exterior form (and to that extent is shared with the “real” elephant), but lacks all other qualities (which we may call “real\") of the animal: one cannot travel on the back of a picture (for example). Here, this difference is exploited in order to emphasize that the “reality\" of the elephant is elsewhere, and does not derive from the mirror, which is not true of “objects\" created by £iva.

Nevertheless, consciousness knows the uni­verse by means of its own essential power of awareness (vi- marsa), whereas the mirror doesn’t know it in that w ay.479Thus, from the point of view of the Supreme Lord, since the host of objects480 has been created within his own body, there is no illusion of difference (bhedabhranti) at all [that is, we cannot logically consider the Lord as different from the universe].However, from the point of view of the cognizer under the domin­ion of maya (maydpramdtr), the appearance of difference [or, difference which itself is but an appearance] (bhedavabhasa) is nothing but a con­fusion on his part that consists in his failing to recognize his plenitude (purnatvdkhyati) .481477In the example (dptanta), the substratum is the mirror. In the ddptdntika, the substra­tum is consciousness. There is a unique difference between the dpfdnta and the dapfdntika. In the dfsfanta, there is something present as an archetype that is reflected in the substra­tum, whereas, in the darstantika, it is consciousness that appears both as substratum and archetype (as the manifold world), for the archetype is but the creation of the substratum. The world thus created is consciousness, he who manifests it is consciousness, and the sur­face, or screen (bhitn), on which it is manifested, or projected, is also consciousness.

But, of course, this would not be the first case of an opportune remorphemicization in the interests of “clarity”; see, for instance, sura issued from asura understood as a-sura.494bijabhumi.495Probably a Krama technical term, which implicidy refers to the Goddess VyomavameS* vari (‘She who Vomits the [Five] Voids’), worshiped in the first phase of the pentadic cycle of the Five Voids, who represents ‘the initial and eternal vibration of thoughtless consciousness* (Sanderson 1988: 696-697). Thus is Vyomavamesvarl at the level of ¿akti. See the Krama text, the Mahdnayaprakaia (39b-40a) of Arnasimha, which describes Vyomavameivari: ma• hdtunydttfunyatvat samyakiantatarapi y d // sarvavyomdni vdmanti vyomavdmefvari tusd/, ‘She who, though extremely at peace for she is “great Void beyond the Void” {mahdiunydtiiunya), vomits all Voids is Vyomavamesvarf (manuscript transcribed by Marc Dyczkowski, made available by the Muktabodha Indological Research Institute). The term mahdiunya appears in SvTU I I 154 (which cites VBh 149 and Kubjikamatatcmira [KMT] V I23), SvTU IV 209, and IV 369; since SvTU IV 209 relates mahasunya with the ddntddtakald, which corresponds to the level of ¿iva/^akti, the notion might be equated with that of mahasunydtidunya. It is to be distinguished from the notion of /unyaddunya, the ‘Void beyond the Void’, which, according to SvT X 707, corresponds to the dakd named mahamayd (see SvTU VII 6 (two times), X 707, X 1213, X 1278, XI 16; TAV VI 10, XI 20, NT VII 21, XXI 61 (two times), XXII 43, XXU 44); nevertheless PHvf 4 [Singh: 55] offers a different correspondence, which makes dunydtidunya a synonym for AnSiritaiiva — a level of experience at the junction of ¿akti and SadSiiva, i.e., at the junction of the one and the many Canddritadivaparydyadunydtidunya*) — inasmuch as such ‘experience’ (if it can be called that) precedes all concrete or material creation (on these notions, see Appendix 7, p. 327).496purndhantdmayo yah camatkarah.497aham idam.498Trika texts develop a sort of norm which correlates icchddakti with SadaSiva, jndnadakd with fevara and kriyadakti with duddhavidya (see PS 14, TAIX 50b-51a, IPV III 1 ,7 (avat.) and Torella IPK: 193, n. 13). Nevertheless, as emphasized by TA IX 51b-52a (quoted n. 485), it is more a question of the predominance of one specific dakd in a specific tattva than a regular correspondence, the other daktis being also present in every tattva, even though in a subordinated way. This principle suffices to explain the relative discrepancies between the texts. In effect, according to some, it is jnanadakti that operates in Sadaiiva, and kriyadakti in I$vara, whereas a residual trace of kriyadakti is in action in duddhavidya, icchddakti being correlated with £akti; see ¿D I 29b-31, TA VI 43-44, and the rather enigmatic statem ent of the IPK III 1, 2, thus explained by the Vimardini: antari jndnarupaya data tasya udrekdbhdsane sddakhyam [...] bahirbhavasya kriyttfakiimayasya [...] udrekabhdse sad [...] Uvaratattvam,"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"KARIKA 14121Here reside the class of cognizers called the MantramaheSvaras, the ‘Great Lords of Mantras’. 499Likewise, it is at this very stage [i.e., on the level of the tattva SadaSi- va], thanks to the absence of difference expressed in the judgment i am this’, 500 that the condition termed ‘Isvara’ is reached, consisting in the marvelous experience of one’s own Self,501 for now the two moments of ip-‘When the preponderance (udreka) of the internal condition characterized as “knowledge” (jnana) becomes evident, there arises the tattva Sadakhya.

Those categories, to whom YR will refer in commenting on this karik3 and karika 23, represent different levels, or modes, of consciousness.500aham idam.501 Here, YR does not relate the Uvaratattva to a specific ¿akti, be it jndnasakti, as is generally the case, or kriyd/akd (see n. 498). Moreover his exposition of the Uvaratattva differs from w hat appears to be the norm. Most Trika texts establish symmetry between the SadSiiva and the Hvara states, to the extent that they even explain them through the contrastive metaphor of shutting and opening the eyes (nimefa/unmefa), as in iPK 111 1 ,3 . In both tattvas, it is the experience of aham idam, 'I am this*, with a difference of emphasis: on ‘1* (or intemality), in Sadaiiva; on ‘this* (or externality), in fevara. In S ad^iva, T overcomes ‘this*, since conscious­ness equates the universe with itself, in the movement of nimefa, while closing, as it were, its eyes. According to IP W , vol. Ill: 264, the word itself — Sadaiiva, ‘Eternal ¿iva’ — means that Siva remains £iva, i.e., consciousness, even if the object begins to emerge within him. Symmetrically, in Hvara, ‘this’ overcomes ‘I*, since now consciousness equates itself with the universe, thus making differentiation more evident, as the universe is, in effect, its own negation. On these reasonings, see IPV III 1, 2-3: [...] yada aham ity asya yadadhikaranam cinmatrarupam tatraivedaqi samullasayati tada tasyasphufatvdt saddfivata aham idam id / idam aham id tu idamityamie sphutibhute ’dhikarane yadahamamiavimariam nijincati tadeJvarata — id vibhdgah, ‘When the substratum of the “I**, namely, pure consciousness, makes appear in that (“I**) a “that**, then such (conscious] state is called “Sadasiva”, because the “that** (though appearing] is not there manifested clearly (i.e., as other than the “I\"], viz., “I am this”; on the other hand, when, as [captioned in the phrase] “this is I**, the “that**-aspect has achieved clarification as the substratum, then such [conscious] state is called “Hvara”, for in such [awareness] [the “that**] is anointed with an awareness of the “I**-aspect [that is, the “object** is endowed with the grace of consciousness] — such is the difference [between the two stages]’. See IPK III 1, 2-3; also IPK III 1, 5 and vptd ad loc., wherein is coined the con­cept of ‘perfect-imperfect state* (pardparadaSd; pardpardvasthd) in order to account for these two ambiguous tattvas, whose perfection of consciousness (that of the i*) is slightly altered by the mere presence of a 'this*: atredantamater aparatvam ahantayd sarvasya vedyasyacchd- danat parateti pardparavasthaifd, ‘Here there is imperfection because there is the notion of ‘this’, perfection because all the cognizable is veiled by the T ; this is therefore the perfect- imperfect condition* (tr.

On the other hand, YR, though adm itting the simultaneous presence of ipseity and objectivity at the level of livara, chooses to emphasize the perfection of the experience in which there is no sense of alterity.

Yet, as the Bhdskan explains, it is so formulated for fear of prolixity (vistarabhiya), but in reality apart from this passage, the pre-eminence of the ‘I-principle’ is associated only with the sadalivatattva (nanu tarhi sadadivatattve samadhftat- ulaputanyayo na yuktah, satyam, vistarabhiya atraivam uktam anyatha tu sadadivatattve aham- bhavasya pradhanyam eva vartate ity alam).S03aham aham/idam idam — some texts formulate the experience as ‘aham ca idam ca’ or ‘aham idam ca\\^ T h e illustration is most likely intended to reflect the infant’s “point of view” — which, mutatis mutandis, is that of the Lord: the infant confounds the external world with himself (or his own body), and is unable to designate it other than by pointing to his own head.505In duddhavidya, the ‘this’, although now clearly apparent, still remains within the fold of the T , inasmuch as it is but the projection of the ‘I’ within itself. Thus, although at this stage some duality appears, that duality does not present itself in the form of alterity, to be subject to which is the destiny of the finite beings (PralaySkalas and Sakalas) living in the world of mutually exclusive subjects and objects. In the duddhavidya, even though the subject regards now the object as other, he does not deviate for all that from his perfect mergence with pure consciousness. Though apprehended, objects are known as they are in essence: as nothing but consciousness (cinmatrasdra, in iPvj- III 1, 4 = bodhasara in YR ad 14). This is where the ‘purity’ o f ‘pure’ Knowledge resides, as explained in iPvj- in 1, 4. At this stage, the ‘this’ appears as “distinct” from the T , but not “different” from it, inasmuch as it is just an aspect of the T . It is noteworthy that YR uses the same term camatkara, ‘wonder’, in describing each of the three levels of experience corresponding, respectively, to Sadaiiva, I^vara and duddhavidya. On duddhavidya and its relation to the concept of dakdcakramahedvaratva, see n. 942.^ T h e sequentiality implied in the ordering of the duddhatattvas is intended to clarify the process of creation, first as an immaterial extroversion of vibrating consciousness, then, from maya onwards, as a material one. In this ‘pure path’ (duddhadhvan), consciousness is the only reality; creation takes place within consciousness: it is in fact a projection of consciousness. In this sense, it is right to apply the term tattva to the five stages of consciousness, which are ‘principles’ or ‘reality-levels’, rather than ‘facts’ — and this usage is equally justified even ifthe term be understood in the etymological sense of ‘extension’, ‘projection’, as Indian com­mentators are wont to do (see YR ad 10-11, n. 433 and 434).

At the level of £uddhavidya, comments AG in his avat. ad IPK III 1, 6, the manifestation of difference cannot be explained without the intervention of maya. Yet, difference is still ‘known’ — an aspect of ‘knowledge’ (vidyd). Therefore the mdya that operates there is, however, ‘not fully developed’ (aprarudhd) mayd, feeble (‘¿ithila’, so glossed by the Bhaskari) — an attenuated form of mayd, called mahdmdyd in the Raurava: tata evaprarudhamdyakalpatvdn mahdmdyeyam £nrauravadigurubhir upadista. YR’s manner of exposition implies that the incomplete quote that follows (mdyopari mahd­mdyd) is likely borrowed from the Raurava; see n. below. Anyhow, it is in this sense, because the Mantras and the Vidyeivaras are ‘perm eated’ (as stated here by YR) by the mahdmdyd, that is, are contaminated by its vicinity, that they are affected by the mayiyamala; but it does not mean that they are located in the mahdmdyd; rather, it is the next level of subjectivity, that of the Vijnanakalas, which resides in the mahdmdyd. Moreover, it should be noted that YR’s differs here from Utpaladeva’s view, as formulated in IPK III 1, 3, that ‘I’ and ‘this’ are, in the £uddhavidya, in a relation of co-referentiality (samdnddhikaranya).509mdyopari mahdmdyd [...]. Cf. Rauravagama, Vidyapada, IV 28b: mdyopari mahdmdyd sar- vakaranakdranam. It must be noted that the Vidyapada part of the printed Rauravagama [RA] is in fact part of the Rauravasutrasamgraha [RSS], which probably dates from a much earlier period than the printed Kriydpada of the Rauravdgama. The printed Kriyapada belongs to a different stratum of composition and was transmitted exclusively in South India (moreover, there is no Vidyapdda at all in the South Indian RA). In the RSS, citations from the old Rau­rava are found, among them: mdyopari mahdmdyd. For more information and a discussion of the dating and the relation of the two texts, see Goodall (Kiranavjtti: xl, n. 92, and xlviii-xlix). A similar line is cited by AG in his PTV 5 -8 with attribution to the Kubjikamata, but the verse is not found in the transmission of the Kubjikamata (see Sanderson 2002: 2): mdyopari ma­hdmdyd trikonanandarupini, ‘Above maya is mahdmdyd, the embodiement of the bliss of the triangle’ (Singh PTV [Skt text: 64; transl.: 176]; Gnoli PTV: 249); compare YR’s quote with that of PTV 5-9 (PTV [Skt text: 40; transl.: 101]) and TAVIX 91a: mayordhve £uddhavidya- dhah santi vijndnakevaldh, ‘Above mayd and below £uddhavidya are the Vijnanakevalas’ (see"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"124TRANSLATIONHence [it is only in that limited sense that] the Mantras residing there are said to be finite souls, for they are penetrated by mahamaya. 510Above the maya-principle and below the suddhavidya are the cognizers termed Vijnanakalas,511 who retain the impurity of deeming oneself finiten. 511).

At this stage, YR’s exegesis intro­duces the concept of mahamdyd. The issue is that of explaining the paradox of a subjectivity unmodified by objectivity; such “objectivity” as there is remains under the dominion of the “subject”; it cannot be the product of maya, but rather of this quasi-mdya. The paradox is brought out in the characterization of the Mantras and the Vidyeivaras, who, though be­longing to the duddhadhvan, are nonetheless subject to the mayiyamala (see Appendix 10, p. 332). On mahamdya, see also n. 495 and Vasudeva MVT: 170.510The implication being that they are considered as finite souls (anu) inasmuch as they are subject to the mdyiyamala. YR refers here implicitly to iPvj III 2, 9, which states, as regards the V i d y e i v a r ae$dm anutvam api sydt. Another characteristic of the Mantras and Vidyeivaras (which distinguishes them from the Vijndndkalas) is that they are endowed with agency (kartftva; IPK III 2, 9) — a feature which is only alluded to in YR’s exegesis, when he presents that category of subjects as ‘signifiers* (vacaka), that is, ‘agents of sig­nification’, who are able ‘to free the bound souls’. As for the Vidyeivaras, they are also agents, inasmuch as several Agamas present them as instigators of the cosmic functions, later termed pahcakptya, the ‘five functions’, but here restricted to four. Scriptures differ as to the act they are exempted from; see Vimalavati I la , Parakhyatantra II 96b, RSS I 15b, and MVT I 20b-21: etdn astau sthiddhvamsaraksanugrahakarinah// mantramantresvare duddhe samniyojya tatah punah/ mantrdndm asjjat tadvat saptakotih samandalah//, ‘Having accorded [the status of] pure M antram antreivaras to these eight [Vidyeivaras] in charge of preservation/creation (sthiti), destruction (dhvamsa), obscuration/protection (rak$a) and grace (anugraha), he then created in the same way seventy million Mantras with their respec­tive spheres of influence/manda/os’ (tr. Vasudeva, modified; see Vasudeva MVT: 158-161, for an interpretation of the passage). Thus, as observes iPvj* III 1, 9, the Vidyeivaras are endowed with a partial agency, such that they are ‘different from the Lord and from one another’, and as such ‘they too must be considered as “anu” * — which is just another way of formulating the reason justifying the anutva of this category of subjects, the mayiyamala being the cause of their partial agency. One observes here YR’s emphasis on the level of subjectivity represented by the Mantras and the Vidyeivaras, who reside in iuddhavidyd. By underlining the Mantras’ role as vdcakas and the liberating vocation of both the Mantras and the Vidyeivaras, YR anticipates the account of mantric practice he will give in ka. 41-46, where those pramatfs named Mantras are also the personifications of the m antras of the tantric practice.s n This sentence is to be read as a paraphrase of the quote (probably an Agama, although given without explicit attribution): mayordhve duddhavidyadhah sand vijnanakevaldh, which completes the argum ent of PTV 5 -9 (and in TAV IX 90b-92a; see below).

Therefore, if mahamayd is not [accepted as a category], then, since the abode of the Pralayakevalas is in the domain of maya, and that of the Vidyeivaras, etc., is in the domain of [duddhajvidya, in which domain would abide the VijfiSnakevalas?’ By allud-"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"KAR1KA 14125[after shaking off the two other im purities].512This form of Siva, who is [in essence] one only, is yet spoken of in terms of a pentad of principles, i.e., as the Fourth state (txuya), although he transcends the Fourth state (turyadta) . 513Hence this independent agent (icartjr) manifests himself as one only. Therefore, this [¿iva], unique and autonomous, appears (prakasate) as the agent [of creation], the Light [viz., consciousness] of whom, at the level of Sada&va and Isvara, consists in the thought: ‘I am this’. 514 Iting here to the PTV, YR refers implicitly to the notion of mahdmayd he has just dealt with, thus completing its definition. This additional level, which has no name of its own in the quoted text, is to be identified as mahdmayd and interpreted, spatially, as a full-fledged tattva. This is another argum ent in favor of the introduction of mahdmayd in the general scheme of tattvas and pramatfs: an additional tattva has to be postulated in order to make room for the Vijnanakalas. TA IX 90b-92a confirms that line of reasoning, providing it with an ontolog­ical foundation: the VijnSn&kala is stationed mid-way between the pure and impure paths, for, being affected by anavamala, he cannot ascend, while, being free both from karmamala, inasmuch as he is exempt from action (nifkarma, v. 90b), and from mayiyamala, inasmuch as he ‘resides only in pure consciousness’ (iuddhacinmatrasamsthita, v. 92a), he cannot de­scend. As TAV ad loc. says: [...] asau ‘mdyordhve iuddhavidyadhah sand vijndnakevalah’ ityddyuktayuktya ¿uddhdJuddhadhvamadhyavaru £uddhabodhaikasvabhavo ’pi svdtantryahaneh— dnavamalarrdakfiasya svarupasamkocasya sambhavdt [...], *[...] that one, according to the reasoning at work in the statement: “Above mayd and below £uddhavidya, are the Vijnanake- valas\", abides between the pure and impure paths, although he is essentially pure knowledge— [a paradox] due to the loss of freedom, that is, due to the presence of the contraction of his own essential nature brought about by a trace of the anavamala’. On such grounds, the ap­parently contradictory statements of Vasudeva (MVT: 170), namely, ‘Abhinavagupta locates the Vijnanakalas in MahSmayatattva [...) but he is unable or unwilling to cite an author­itative scriptural passage substantiating this’, and ‘an unidentified Saiva scripture quoted by Abhinavagupta and Jayaratha also places the Vijnanakalas in the interstice between the pure and impure universes’, may be reconciled. For further details on the Vijn3nakalas, see Appendix 10, p. 330.512Here YR briefly evokes the VijnSn§kalas, who do not belong to the £uddhadhvan, the subject of the karika. Yet, he must refer to them at this point of his exposition, because of their interm ediate status and location between £uddhddhvan and aiuddhddhvan. Thus, YR, following AG, reorganizes the various arrangements observed in previous texts of the Saiva tradition. He locates here three categories of subjects unambiguously on the scale of the tattvas: the Mantras (along with the Vidyeivaras), the Vijnanakalas and the Pralayakalas being respectively assigned to £uddhavidyd, mahdmayd and maya. He will take up the de­scription of the last two categories of subjects, the Pralayakalas and the Sakalas, in his gloss on PS 23.513The ‘Fourth state’ (turya) is Siva’s experience of perfect, blissful, consciousness, tran­scending waking (jagrat), dream (svapna) and deep sleep (sufupd); cf. PS 35 and YR ad loc.; turyddta, the 'one transcending the Fourth’, is a still higher state, for turya is not completely free from contingent conditions (upddhi) such as the body or breath. Here the question of the existence of a thirty-seventh tattva is implicitly referred to by YR in agreem ent with IPK III and Bhaskara’s commentary. According to Bhaskara, though Siva and Param aiiva are not different in essence, Siva is meant to refer to his specific nature (svarupanirde£a) while Paramaiiva is the all-inclusive form, which implies his pervading (vydpaka) the whole scale of the tattvas. However, Param aiiva is not to be considered a thirty-seventh tattva: he who pervades (vydpaka) cannot be located in the same series as those pervaded (vydpya).

It amounts to five possible interpretations, among which the main difference is w hether durghata qualifies as an adjective the process of manifesting objectivity, or designates objectivity itself (‘that which is difficult to construe’); 1) as a KD — ‘which is a difficult accomplishing’, as an apposition to svatantryam; 2) as a TP — ‘which is the accomplishing of what is difficult to construe’; 3) as a TP understanding sampddana in the sense of sampddaka (see YR: prdptiprapdkam, and Renou 1968: §§ 168, 180) — ‘which accomplishes what is difficult to construe’; 4) as a BV based on a KD (see 1) — ‘whose ac­complishing [as the dichotomy of subjects and objects] is difficult’; 5) as a BV, based on a TP (see 2) — ‘which accomplishes what is difficult to construe*.

The theme of the divine play (tila, in Advaita and Vai$nava traditions, fcrida, in Trika) culminates in the somewhat paradoxical notion that the freedom of the Lord is not complete unless he is able to obscure and delimit himself (cf. Hulin 1978: 306). In f>SV I 2, the Lord’s freedom is defined as jndnakriydsvatantrya, freedom to know and to do everything. Here, the kriya aspect of the Lord’s freedom is referred to, since the exposition now takes up the aiuddhddhvan, the ‘impure path’, namely, actual (as opposed to virtual) creation.524 YR gives here two traditional etymological explanations of the term maya, both of which seem to presume the root ma (passive mlyate) ‘measure ou t’: maya is, on the one hand, the capacity to ‘produce’ forms, images, objects, and on the other, to ‘deceive’ thereby. For a summary of recent discussions of the problem, see Mayrhofer (EWA II: 349-350), who takes it as ‘wahrscheinlich’ that the term derives from the root ma ‘construct’, contra, inter aliat Thieme (ZDMG 95: 112ff., Anm. 1), who would derive it from the root mi ‘alter’. As Mayrhofer points out (see also KEWA 11:625; III: 777), recourse to the root ml does not appear at all necessary, inasmuch as the sense ‘capacity to deceive’ (mohakata) can easily be deduced as an extension of ‘the capacity to m easure’, that is, to construct forms that are in the last analysis illusory. Such acceptations are in evidence in the earliest period, as indro mayabhih pururOpa lyate, ‘Indra assumes many forms through his powers (of representation] (mayabhih)' ($S VI 47, 18; $B XIV 5, 5, 19; BAU II 5, 19; JUB I 44, 1, 4), quoted by R ad APS 1 (while commenting on niviftam bahudha guhasu), by BhSskara in his gloss ad IPV, mahgalacarana 2, p. 13, and by A3 III 24a (through its pratfka), in order to dem onstrate that creation takes place in an illusory fashion; see also n. 528, the quotation in IPV n 3 ,1 7 (vol.

PTV (Skt. text: p. 3), which enumerates the meanings of the root div: divu kridavijigisdvyavahdradyutistutigatisu, ‘The root div is used in the senses “play”, “desire to conquer”, “worldly pursuits”, “splendor”, “adoration”, “m ovement” ’. Dhatupatha IV 1 gives some more meanings: divu krida-vijigisd- vyavahdra-dyuti-stuti-moda-mdda-svapna-kdnti-gatisu. Here, maya is devf in a limited sense, as playful (kridaSila), and she is playful because, as one of God’s energies/powers, she belongs to him, who is himself playful, according to one etymology of the name deva.

The master answers: ‘w hich accom plishes w h a t is difficult to construe*.[By ‘difficult to c o n stru e ’] he means ‘able to be effected [only] with difficulty*;527 [through this freedom takes place] the accom plishing (sam- pàdana) of th a t difficult (durghata) result, consisting in [the totality of relations between] cognizers and objects of cognition — that is, such free­dom effects the attestation of [such a universe].528propre félicité’ (tr. Silbum, Padoux TÀ: 97 — ‘[He is God, deva, because he plays] without caring for what has to be sought and what has to be rejected. His play is springing up as an undivided mass of his own bliss’).526The Brahmavàdins referred to here are those who hold that brahman, understood as free of all activity (iànta/nihkriya), is the only reality. For Sankara, the very language of ‘cause’ and ‘effect’ is soiled by mâyà. Therefore, the relation between the level of mâyà and that of brahman is ‘difficult to be expressed’ (anirvacantya). Furthermore, since the ‘world’ is not a ‘result’ of brahman, it cannot be anything other than an ‘appearance’, like that of a rose in a mirror. Therefore, the Saiva exposition given here of the Advaita doctrine should be treated with circumspection: according to Advaita, there is nothing “different” from brahman; at the same time, what appears as “different” is such only as erroneous ‘manifestation’ (as “different”, it is not brahman — and therefore does not exist), mâyà is thus a principle both independent and false, which cannot belonc to brahman as such. Nevertheless, it should be observed that for the “Idealists” of the Sankara school of Vedanta, the cause of error has retroverted to brahman itself, from considerations of logical consistency: for the jlva cannot be, as Mamjana maintains, both the result and the source of illusion. ÀPSV 56, p. 29, explains mâyà as a transformation of the Lord who produces it, ‘just as snow, foam, etc., are produced from w ater only as its transformations’ (yathâ jalàddhimaphenàdayas tathâ tathà parinamanasvabhàvatvàd eva jàyante). However, the mâyà that is thus produced is ‘not meant for any purpose, because the Lord cannot desire anything, having already all his desires satisfied’ (na kim api prayojanam uddifya, tasyâptakàmatvena kasmimf cid icchâsambhavâd ity arthah). In contrast, the Trika considers mâyà a power (éakti) of the Lord partaking of his essence, and defines it as the Lord’s desire (icchà) of diversity. YR will take up again this criticism of the Brahmavàda in his commentary ad 27, emphasizing that this system does not take into consideration the sovereign freedom of the Lord, which is itself responsible for duality.527See TÀ XV 272b: atidurgha^aghatàsvatanorecchàvaààd ayam, ‘This is due to the force of the free desire [of the Lord] to construe what is difficult to construe’, and TÀV ad loc., which explains ghatà as ghaumam, and refers to P. Ill 3, 104 (sidbhidàdibhyo Vi): ghatanam ghafeti bhidàditvàdah.528prâptipràpaka — lit.,'brings it to discemibility’. In this context, it is inviting to under­stand pràpti in its ‘gram matical’ or ‘(psycho)logical’ sense o f ‘the given’ — what is presented to the observer as he contemplates his next step, w hether it be the provisional stage of a w ord’s derivation as it awaits the application of the following rule, or that which presents itself to the organs of sense as their immediate content, suitable or unsuitable. The two pos­sibilities amount to the same thing here, for all intents and purposes, for it is the creative power of the Lord that ‘causes to appear’ (prâpaka) before our eyes that which ‘appears’ there as unconditioned (pràpti). YR implies here that the internal division of the single principle into innumerable subjects and objects is the problem — either that such a division is difficult to justify reasonably, or that the result is difficult to effect within the unity. The notion of durghatasampàdanam is a leitm otif in Trika literature, as shown by parallel passages in which appear such terms as durghatakàrin (TÀV V 123), atidurghatakàrin (TÀ I 92, TÀV IV 173a,"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"KARIKA 16129This maya is th e covering of Siva’s ow n Self — when, out of his free will, he assumes the state of a bound soul.

Cf. iPvjf ID 2, 3, where the term puipstva is found in the same sense. The term ‘individuation’ should not be understood in any sociological (or even psychological) sense, implying what has come to be designated as the “individual” of modem societies — it has rather to do here with the idea of the ami, or the anavamala, the wholly deceitful ‘atom ization’ of universal consciousness. Among the many discussions of the Indian “individual” — or whether such a term is at all appropriate in characterizing the pre-modem “person” — is Louis Dumont’s Homo Hierarchicus, q.v.531 Lit., ‘in its proper form’.532The usual denomination of this tattva is vidyat meaning ‘[limited] Knowledge’. The first hemistich is quoted, along with k5. 15, in TAV I 37-38. The second is quoted immediately thereafter, along with PS 17, in TAV I 39-40. The term kala, here translated ‘[limited] Agency’, expresses more literally this sense of limitation, its primary meaning being ‘segment, phase (of the moon), etc.’.533bodha is the universal divine consciousness, whose characteristics, according to PTLvj (p. 2), are avikalpatvam, ‘not subject to thought-constructs’, and pumatvam, ‘completeness’, ‘lack of internal division or external condition*.

Such flaws are ‘antaranga’ — a term used here with overtones of its grammatical meaning — in the sense that they find their ‘existential’ occasions before another ‘rule’ is applied or whose causes are found within the domain of another rule — for instance, the rule here promulgated, thanks to which we may be liberated from such flaws.

Dwivedi Kdvyaprakada: 3, modified). The commentary Sampraddyaprakddinl by ¿rividyacakravartin contrasts this creation of the poet with that of the Creator (brahman), attributing to the former an eminence com para­ble to the latter’s: niyatidaktyd niyatarupd sukhaduhkhamohasvabhavd paramdnvddyupddana- karmddisahakdrikdranaparatantrd fadrasa na ca hfdyaiva taih tadpdi brahmano nirmitir nir- manam, ‘Formed into a definite shape by the power of niyati, characterized by pleasure, pain and delusion, dependent on material causes such as atoms and auxiliary causes such as action (karman), possessed of [only] six flavours and not invariably pleasant by these — such is the creation or production of the Creator’ (tr. Dwivedi Kavyaprakdda: 3). According to AG’s mahgalacarana to the Locana, the poet — the metaphor of the Supreme Lord — can create anything he wishes, such as a celestial flower, w ithout abiding by the ordinary law of causality, i.e., w ithout requiring any other cause than his own genius (pratibha), which may be seen as the totality of the causes: apurvam yad vastu prathayati vind karanakaldm [...], ‘[The poet] manifests entirely new objects without requiring the least cause [...]*. Which affords yet another example in Kashmirian £aiva thought of the close parallel between the Lord’s powers and the poet’s — and indeed between moksaddstra and kavyadastra. Note that, in the Trika, pratibha, often translated as ‘genius’ in a poetic context, is both self-luminous consciousness (svaprakdda) and self-consciousness (vimarda).5S9niyamena [...] niyamyate — for a similar usage, also in a context of physical determinism, namely, the successive rising and setting of the moon and sun, suggestive of human destinies, see ¿akuntala, IV, st. 2.5S9samkalpa — the law of karman is one aspect of this general law of causation. Sanderson (1986: 179) translates niyad as ‘causality of karma*.S60sarvdtmana.561 I.e., ‘let me not lose the capacity of being an enjoyeri.

The logical cum causal nuance of these terms should be kept in mind: the fifth fetter to which the subject is prone is here termed niyati; the unfettered Lord vis-à-vis the subject so fettered is described as vyápaka. The term niyati here intends specifically the type of connection that is called \"causal\": from \"smoke\" we are obliged to conclude \"fire\", and the reason for this is that the domain of \"smoky things” is without exception included (yyàpyà) in the domain of “fiery things\" (yyâpaka); such relation of inclusion is termed vyàpti, often translated as 'pervasion*. Here the Lord is the ultimate vyápaka, for he includes everything possible, and therefore everything can indifferently be termed a vyápya. The relation of yyápti is therefore \"truistical\" for the Lord, and no niyati can be said to characterize his relation to any effect — which relation does most definitely ap­ply to his \"fettered” subjects.

The series of external and internal instruments has thirteen aspects and the effects are of ten kinds, being divided into gross and subtle’ (on avibhâgarûpin, cf. Pandey, IPK, vol. Ill: 199). The exposition of the meya ends with kà. 22.585Cf. SK 33. ‘antahkarana’ is a term found also in Advaita, where it represents the ‘subjec­tive’ side of the provisionally real, corresponding to the ‘objective’ mâyâ. Under its aegis are grouped together, as in Sâipkhya, the intellective functions of buddhi, ahahkàra, and manas. The sequence found in the kàrikâ does not imply that the Trika presumes for the “organs” an order of evolution different from that of the Sàipkhya. By it is merely signified that the three “organs” correspond to and are explained by the three functions: nifcaya, samkalpa, abhimâna. The translation differs somewhat from L Silbum’s interpretation: 'Ainsi la nature consistant uniquement en plaisir, en souffrance et en égarem ent constitue l’organe interne fait de décision, de volition et de présomption qui appartiennent dans l’ordre à l’intellect, au sens interne et à l’agent d ’individuation’.s^sâmânyam rûpam — the same notion is conveyed by sâmyâvasthà in GBh 16: tatkim uktam bhavati sattvarajastamasàm sâmyâvasthà pradhânam, and GBh 23: iyam prakptih sattvarajas­tamasàm sâmyâvasthà. According to the Sâmkhya, when the equilibrium of the gunas — by which equilibrium prakpti as such is defined — is disturbed by the mere proximity of puru$a, the process of creation takes place. However, the Trika develops its own notions on the sequence of tattvas that starts from prakpti, postulating, notably, an additional principle, the gunatattva; see Appendix 11, p. 334."},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"KARIKA 19139tamas where no dominance or dependence 587 [of any of the three] is ap­prehended, is termed prakrti, the primal cause (mulakarana) .588The master says, beginning with the words ‘decision, e t c / , 589 that from prakfti proceeds the inner organ (antahkarana) — which has the form of its [viz., of prakrti] effect.By decision (niicaya) 590 the master means the notion that ‘this is such and such’. 591By ratio cin atio n Csamkalpana) 592 he means ‘organizational thinking’ (manana) .593587 ahgahgibhdva.^ T h i s notion of mulakdrana is common to both Saipkhya (SK 3) and Trika (see n. 584). However, in the Trika, praiqti is mulakarana in a secondary sense, for prakfd is not the supreme principle, as it is in the Saipkhya, but a manifestation of the Lord’s supreme energy.^ H e r e begins the definition of the several ’functions’ (vftd) of buddhi, manas and ahankara. Cf. GBh 27: tatra manasah ka vfttir in*/ samkalpo vjttih. £SV III 1 uses also the term vydpara, ‘activity’: [...] adhyavasdyddivydpdrabuddhyahankpvnanorupam cittam, ‘citta consists of bud­dhi, manas and ahankara; its activity consists in ascertaining, etc.’.590Cf. the Saipkhya definition (SK 23), where adhyavasdya is a synonym of niicaya (see also £SV UI 1, quoted n. 589). On adhyavasaya/niicaya as the function of the buddhi, see n. 401, n. 591, and p. 294; also, TAI 38b-40 and TAV ad loc. (p. 76): adhyavasayo buddhih; TA I 215, IX 238. However, there is a definition of buddhi specific to the Trika, which is expounded in TS VIII, pp. 85-86: tato gunatattvad buddhitattvam yatra pumprakdio visayai ca pratibimbam arpayatah, ‘Thereafter, from gunatattva, buddhitattva emerges, in which the light of puru$a [i.e., consciousness] reflects itself, as well as objects’. On niicaya, see also YR ad 32 and 63.591 That is, it is ‘just this’ and not ‘something else’. It is the faculty of distinguishing between objects and ascertaining their specific nature. The buddhi evaluates as well as discerns; it re­acts in relation to the T : why indeed discriminate objects? The buddhi comes into play when a response of the subject is called for. Note that the buddhi is the initial evolute of prakfti, where the notion o f ‘activity’ is lodged. Thus the buddhi is not solely an intellective function, but also a volition, a desire to act, be it simply the ‘act’ of preferring one object to another. GBh 23 gives an example similar to that of YR: ayam ghato *yajji pata ity evam sad yd sa bud- dhir id lakfyate, ‘When one says: “This is a ja r, this is a piece of cloth”, this is what is defined as volition (buddhi)\\ In the Saipkhya, it is to the manas that is given the task of representing to us the world of the senses, which appears both as external and internal, providing thus the groundwork for involving the individual (the ‘a/iam’) in actions. Thus is explained the characteristic function of the buddhi, adhyavasdya, that is, choosing, even willing (cf. the notion of aiivarya, ‘sovereignty, power’, as a property of buddhi — buddhidharma — in SK 23 and Vacaspati’s TK thereon, even though the word has acquired a supra-human refer­ence), on the basis of the data that are given to it by the manas. The buddhi makes its own the content delivered to it by the manas, thus anticipating the individuations represented by the ahankara and the host of the sense-organs, and to which the latter are instrumental; cf. TK 23: sarvo vyavahartdlocya matvd ham atrddhikfta ity abhimatya kartavyam etan mayety adhyavasyati atai ca pravartata id lokasiddham, ‘It is well known that a man who is to act, considers [the situation], ponders over it, agrees that he is entitled to do it, determines that he should do it and then does it’.5920 r ‘projection’ — of an entity where there exist only the disjointed data of the five senses. Cf. SK 27, where manas is defined as samkalpaka.593As is obvious, AG follows here verbatim the “evolution” of the categories as expounded in l£varakf$na’s Saipkhya; there, the function of manas is clearly that of collecting the senses’ data — scattered as such under the five domains of the individual organs — so that unique"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"140TRANSLATIONBy conceit of self [or self-referentiality] (abhimâna) the master means ‘possessive behavior’ (mamatâ) .594“objects\" appear clearly before us, each of them endowed with the properties of the five senses — length, odor, color, etc. Thus is manas the common “theater\" where all the five gather — much akin to the “common sense\" of the English philosophers, which itself has an­tecedents in Aristotle’s KOivq aïaO ncru;. Advaitins, on the other hand, use the term manana in another sense. Here, as well, it belongs to a triad, sravana, manana, nididhyàsana, which evoke the way one appropriates the truths of the system — first, they are ‘heard’ under the guidance of an enlightened teacher, then, one strives to convince oneself of their validity by efficient ‘argum ents’, thus setting aside opposing theses as well as doubts originating in the “real\" world; finally, they are incorporated in a new apprehension of the “real\", which is now intuitive. Note that manana plays here as well the part of an intermediary between “external\" and “internal\" thought. TS VIII (p. 87) explains how manas proceeds from the sàttvikâhankâra, along with the buddhindriyas and karmendriyas: tatra sâttviko yasmâd ma- nai ca buddhindriyapancakam ca, ‘From the sàttvika [ahankàra] manas and the pentad of the buddhindriyas proceed’, and (p. 88): sàttvikâd eva ahahkâràt karmendriyapancakam. Never­theless, TS VIII (p. 89) mentions other views: according to some, manas proceeds from the râjasàhahkàra (anye tu ràjasân mana tty âhuh); according to others, manas proceeds from the sàttvikâhankâra, whereas indriyas proceed from the ràjasàhankàra (anye tu sàttvikâd mono rri- jasàc ca indriyânïti); see n. 605 and 613. In a similar fashion, Vâcaspati considers the buddhi to be polyvalent — in some, it is sâttvikapradhàna, in others, tâmasapradhâna (TK 23).594Lit., ‘the idea that “all this is mine, or for me.\" ’ Similar definition in YR ad 70.

Judging by the term tanmatra ‘just that’, we should conceive of these ‘entities* not only as ‘archetypal’ or ‘generic* (Torella IPK; see the term samanya in TS VIII, quoted n. 613), but also as ‘pure’, considered in and of themselves, without admixture of the other four, that together make up the complex that constitute the normal condition of perception — an ‘intellective’ object, but an ‘object’ nonetheless. The tanmatra is then the obverse or the ground of the “real**, required by the very hypothesis that postulates in the gross elements various degrees of elemental “mixture**. This view, which seems originally to have been developed in the Vaiie$ika (Frauwallner 1973: 280), is not, of course, universally accepted (see n. 616).607Here, light (mahas) replaces the usual rupa, probably in order to emphasize the relation­ship, which will be set forth in the following k5rik§, between rupa as tanmatra, and tejas as mahabhuta.608See YR ad 79-80.^ S K 38 defines the tanmatras as avide$at ‘non-specific*, contrasting them with the bhutas defined as videsa, ‘specific*: tanmdtrdny avidefds tebhyo bhutani panca pancabhyah/ ete smftd videsah danta ghorad ca mudhad c a //t ‘The Rudimentary Elements are “non-specific”. From these five proceed the five gross elements; these latter are said to be “specific”, because they are calm, turbulent and deluding’ (tr. G. Jha). According to Vacaspati ad loc. (tanmdtrdni tv asmadadibhih parasparavydvjttani nanubhuyante ity avidesah suksma iti cocyante) the criterion for distinguishing the bhutas from the tanmatras is the capacity of each of the former to set aside instances of the others (parasparavydvjttya) — whereas, evidently, ‘sound as such’ (dabdatanmatra) cannot set aside or cancel ‘form as such’ (rupatanmatra). The bhutas are capable of entering into the field of our experience as distinct from one another, inasmuch as ‘they are calm, turbulent and deluding’, that is, inasmuch as they abound in various degrees of sattva or rajas or tamas. They are therefore considered as both ‘specific* (videsa) and ‘gross’ (st/m/a). That is not to say that one cannot experience the ‘subtle’ object — for if one did not, one would not experience anything at all; all that can be said is that the ‘subtle’ objects (tanmatra) are not experienced in their ‘pure’ state — except perhaps by yogins — but only when they are exemplified through the ‘gross’ elements (mahabhuta). As such, the tanmatras are said to be non-specific (avide$a) and subtle (suksma).610The te rm s'jneya-kdryataya’ and ‘evam anydni* suggest that the commentary intends here the domains both of the buddhlndriyas and the karmendriyas, although the emphasis is put on the tanmatras, the domain proper to the buddhlndriyas.611 paraspardpekfitva — lit., 'mutual expectancy*."},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"144TRANSLATIONtive] witness,612 th e p en tad o f a b stract entities derives, as do the organs [of cognition and action], from the [principle of] ego.613Karika 22Earth, etc., are the result arrived at by a mutual commingling of those [sensible] domains [viz., the tanmatras].

SK 25, which distinguishes the indriyas that presume (along with the manas) a sdttvika, or ‘luminous’, form of the ego from the tanmatras, that presume a tdmasa, or ‘dark’, form of the ego, with the result that manas and the indriyas are ‘apt to fulfil their specific function’ (svavifayasamartha). Moreover, according to GBh 25, the ego ‘is said to be tdmasa to the extent that it is the origin also of the bhutas, which abound in tamas’ (bhutanam adibhu- tas tamobahulas tenoktah sa tdmasa in). In fact the ego is the ‘origin of the bhutas abounding in tamas’ only in an indirect way: in the Samkhya doctrine of evolution, the bhutas proceed from the tanmatras, which are the evolutes of the tdmasa ego. Cf. TS VIII (pp. 89-90): dab- davifefdnam hi ksobhatmanam yad ekam aksobhdtmakam prdgbhavi samanyam aviie$dtmakam tat iabdatanmatram/ evam gandhdnte *pi vacyam, ‘That which is the undisturbed, unique, [principle] of specific sounds whose nature has been disturbed, such a universal (samdnya) of a non-specific nature, which is prior to them, is called iabdatanmdtra, “sound as such\".

SK 38 quoted n. 609.6lsbhutas, or mahabhutas — lit., ‘great (or gross) entities/beings’.616According to GBh 38, one bhuta proceeds from one tanmatra: ether from sound, air from touch, water from savor, fire from form, earth from odor. However, this does not contradict the definition of PS 22, which agrees, as does the theoretical section (vidyapdda) of the Agamas (e.g. Kdlonara, Pau$kara, etc.), with the classical Sarpkhya thesis (see Yuktidipikd ad SK 38) of the tanmatras’ progressive accumulation, that is, that the physical elements are categorized by the adjunction one-by-one of sensible qualities, for it remains the case that each bhuta has one tanmatra as its primary quality (see Torella ¡PK: 196); see Appendix 13, p. 337."},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"KARIKA 23145proceeds earth .6,7 Such are the five ‘great’ [that is, gross, physical] ele­ments (mahabhuta).618In consideration of the maxim, ‘the effect has the qualities of the cause’, 619 [it follows that the mahabhutas] have qualities that increase [in complexity] one-by-one [— each more complex element, in other words, has one more quality than the preceding simpler element].Thus is prakrti, whose nature is that of cause and effect,620 transformed into something that can be enjoyed by the mundane man (purusa), through the Will of the Supreme Lord.

The same logic underlies the theory of the progressive accumulation of tanmatras within the bhutas as they increase in grossness (see IPV III 1, 10-11, in Appendix 13, p. 337).620See Frauwallner 1973: 304ff. From the Trika point of view, prakfti is also an effect, inasmuch as its proceeds from mdyd, which is, in turn, nothing but the Lord’s energy of freedom.621 Here ends the description of the thirty-six tattvas.

It represents the reduction of infinite free consciousness to a minimal, ‘atomic’, state. In the realm of expe­rience, as stated in $SV I 4, the dnavamala is the ‘presumption (or intuition) of limitedness’ (apurnammanyata), which makes the limited soul think: apurno ’smi, ‘I am not full [viz., ‘I am imperfect’]’ (ibid.). Same definition in PHvj- 9 (p. 72). Note that mala often signifies, by synecdoche, dnavamala, particularly in Siddhanta.629The term tdddtmya is used by Advaitins as a way of rationalizing their inability to describe in conventional terms the relationship between brahman and mayd — neither identity, nor difference, nor both (viz., the notion of bhedabheda, dear to the parinamavdda, but abjured by Advaita). It might be said that the Advaitin speaks of tdddtmya in a way resembling N3garjuna’s use of the catuskop — viz., in order to assert that the Absolute is ineffable. In the same fashion, here, even though it cannot be said why the flaw is within the gold, its presence therein is both irrefutable and “given” (ni/a). Here, tadatmyena glosses the epithet antarahga, glossed previously as nija, ‘innate’ (YR ad 17).^ O n e might allege here a certain inconsistency in YR’s use of metaphors. In AG’s text, in effect, the analogy of the inedible bran (kambuka) of the grain is affected to the mayiyamala (k5. 17-18). Yet, commenting (ad k3. 17) on the ‘antarangatva’ of the hexad of sheaths that constitutes the mayiyamala, YR introduces the analogy of the flaw within the gold (kd/ika) — an analogy which, in his commentary ad 24, is affected to the dnavamala, whereas that of the bran is affected to the mayiyamala. The following interpretation may solve the dif­ficulty: in YR ad 17, the analogy of the flaw within the gold is affected to the mdyiyamala only secondarily, inasmuch as the mdyiyamala presupposes the dnavamala, which is indeed implied by the term ‘anu’, in the genitive: mdydsahitam kancuka$atkam anor antarahgam idam uktam (17b); see YR ad loc.

And those objects are endowed with samsáradharmas, ‘phenom enal attributes’ (ÁSVI I 17-18), or samsáralakfanas, ‘phenomenal characteristics’ (ÁSV II 19), such as cause and effect, exteriority, interiority, decay, death, etc., from which, as established by scripture (sarvopani^ad, in ÁáV I I 17; éostra, in ÁSV I I 18) through the via negationis, the átman is altogether distinct (Á¿V I I 17 is quoted n. 667).660And, ipso facto, the doctrines that expound them.661 This enumeration of different conceptions of the Real is rather unusual in Trika litera­ture. The canonical scheme appears to be that of PS 32, which enumerates deha, body, prána, breath, buddhi, intellect or volition, and nabhas (or iünya), the Void. A list that matches that of ÍPK I 6, 4, and of ¿SV I 1, which, commenting on caitanyam átmá, explicitly attributes these different conceptions of the Real to their respective exponents or schools of thought: atha cátmá ka iti jijñásün upadesyán prati bodhayitum na áarírapránabuddhiáünyáni laukikacár- vákavaidikayogácáramádhyamikádyabhyupagatány átmápi tu yathoktam caitanyam eva, ‘And so, in order to explain to inquisitive disciples what the Self is, the author says: “It is not the body, as maintained by the Materialists (laukikacárváka), not Breath {prána), as maintained by the followers of the Vedas, not the intellect {buddhi), as maintained by the Yogácáras, nor the Void (áünya), as maintained by the Madhyamikas, but, as already said, it is pure con­sciousness {caitanyaY (tr. Singh, modified). For parallel passages, see Appendix 14, p. 338. The enumeration of ká. 27a may have been occasioned by ÁPS 27a, first hemistich, of which it is an exact borrowing. However, the perspectives of the two texts are altogether different. On the basis of their common terminology and approach, it appears that, as a Vedántin, Adi- ¿e$a agrees with Bhartjprapañca’s conception of brahman, or paramátman, passing through different states, or stages {avasthá), in the process of evolution, the ultimate reality becoming differentiated into the manifold objects of experience that are both identical to and different from it. These stages, or modes, of the saprapañcabrahman, to which the infinite variety of the universe is reduced, are eight in number, according to Bhartjprapañca. In descending order, the hypostases, or ‘transformations’ {parináma) of brahman, are (see Hiriyanna 1924: 79-80): 1) antaryámin; 2) sákfin; 3) avyákjta; 4) sütra; 5) viráj; 6) daiva; 7) játi; 8) pinda. Thus, as Hiriyanna concludes (p. 80): ‘the whole brahman may be said to evolve in two distinct lines — one (1-2) the spiritual, and the other (3-8) the material, which constitutes either the adjunct or the environment of the spiritual’. In APS 27a, those avasthás are said to be five, if one relies on R, who takes játipinda as a unit, glossing it “vyaffideháh”, doubtless to be taken in its Sáipkhya acceptation, which designates the particular ‘body’ only insofar as it constitutes a part of a larger whole. Thus Ádiáe$a enumerates vijñána, antaryámin, prána, viráddeha, and játipinda, even though those states imputed to the Self are in truth unreal, for it is only one, as established by ChU VI 2 ,1 quoted by R ad APS 27. Despite the similarity of their first hemistichs, verses 26 and 27 differ as to their purport in the two Paramárthasára. In APS, ká. 26 and 27 form a pair expounding the view common to Bhartjprapañca and Ádtéesa of the evolutionary relationship between paramátman (or saprapañcabrahman) and the modes in which the universe appears: rasaphánita¿arkarikágu<jakhan<)á vikftayo yathaivekjoh/ tad- vad avasthábhedáh paramátmany eva bahurúpáh/ / vijñánántaryámipránaviráddehajátipindán- táh/ vyavahárás tasyátmany ete 'vastháviáesáh syuh//. On the contrary, AG’s PS distinguishes 26 from 27, which contrast is signaled also by the supplementary -ádyáh. Verse 26 is indeed an adaptation of ÁPS 26 (besides the adjunction of -ádi, note the suppression of vikpti in a; the greater alteration of b). Verse 27 then becomes the doctrinal exposition of different conceptions of the Self, at the cost of making a few alterations in the half verse: vijñánán- taryámipránaviráddehajátipindántáh/ vyavaháramátram etat paramárthena tu na santy eva//.

A separate monograph will be devoted to a detailed interpretation of this kàrikâ and its commentary.^ T h e question of how to translate the term is taken up in May 1971: 305. The term (one of whose synonyms is citta) is understood contextually as ‘cognition*, ‘pensée* (‘thought’), or ‘conscience* (‘consciousness*); May translates cinamàtravâda, one of the appelations given to the Vijnànavâda, as ‘doctrine du rien-que-pensée*, ‘doctrine de la pensée sans plus’ (EPU II, s.v. citta). Cf. Âé II 25b and BSBh II 2, 28.663anupâdhi.664From BÀU I 6, 3, the syntagm ‘name and form’ signifies phenomenal reality as veiling the immortal àtman, equated with prâna. Therefore, it designates the objective aspect of consciousness. “Name** refers to the “designating** subject, “form** to the “signified** object; in their opposition, they refer to a world conceived of as a totality half-objective and half- subjective.665nfla, ‘blue* [or yellow (pita), etc.], is the standard example of the external form grasped by the sense-organs, whereas sukha, ‘pleasure’, is that of the internal, grasped by the antahkarana (see YR ad 30). Therefore, the syntagm nilasukhâdi represents the ‘knowable’ (vedya), or 'objectivity* insofar as it is an object of consciousness, w hether external or internal. Such reasonings are common to Buddhist idealists and to the Trika, even though the latter (see SpK I 4) reaches the opposite conclusion: the existence of a perm anent Subject, a substratum for the impermanent, incidental experiences of pleasure and pain, etc. On the Vijnànavâda, see Bouy Âé: 229-235, 261-263 (who refers to Lévi 1911, Bareau 1966, Bugault 1968, Yamada 1977, Dasgupta 1969, Mahadevan 1975); see also May 1971: 265-323.666YR reproduces here the very terms of IPK I 5, 5, which formulates the Vijnànavâda doc­trine through its refutation — to which Trika adheres — by the Bàhyârthànumeyavàdins: na vâsanàprabodho ftra vicitro hetutâm iyât/ tasyâpi tatprabodhasya vaicitrye kim nibandhanam//, ‘Not [even] a varied reawakening of the dispositions can be taken to be the cause here [viz., of the multiform world of phenomena], for in such case, what would be the cause of the variety of their reawakening [if not the existence of material entities outside the plane of thought]?’ (tr.

In the same way, YR (ad vijnàna and an- taryàmin) treats as equivalent the Vijnànavàda and the Sàntabrahmavàda, glossing over their many similarities and differences, insofar as he emphasizes that both have erred equally in not recognizing the absolute freedom of the Lord as cause of creation. Thus perhaps YR echoes the criticism of the Vijnânavâdins as formulated by the Mâdhyamikas. In effect, ac­cording to the Mâdhyamikas, the Vijnànavàda theory of cognition, involving the concept of àlayavijnàna, ‘consciousness-receptade*, has surreptitiously reintroduced the germ of a substantiality which they [viz., the Mâdhyamikas] denounced as a resurrection of the brah- manical àtman (see Bareau 1966: 196 and Bouy Aé: 320) into Buddhist speculations that had been characterized by the doctrine of anàtman [Pâli anatta] (viz., the non-existence of an imperishable àtman); see ÎPK I 5, 5, quoted n. 666.^ B y the term ‘Brahmavâdin’ YR may refer here to ¿aiikara’s Advaita or to preéankarite Vedànta, and most probably, to the Vaiçnava stream of preéankarite Vedànta, as represented by Bhartfprapanca and Àdtéesa — the reference made here to the purusasükta (ÇS X 90) would corroborate such a hypothesis; on the identification of that Brahmavâda, see n. 41.X 90, 2.

BÄU III 7 (1-23) consists, in its entirety, of the definition, in the form of a litany, of the ätman as antarydmin, ‘the inner controller from within who controls this world and the next and all things’ (ya imam ca lokám param ca lokám sarvdni ca bhútány antaro yamayati), who is ‘that thread by which this world, the other world and all beings are held together’ (fat siitram yasminn ayam ca lokah paraš ca bkah sarväni ca bhütäni sarpdfbdhäni bhavanti) [BÄU III 7 ,1 ]. The litany concludes (v. 23): nänyo 'to *sti draftä, nänyo 'fo ’so irotä, nänyo *to ’sti mantä, nänyo *to 'so vijnätä/ e$a ta átmántaryámy ampah, ‘There is no other seer but he, there is no other hearer but he, there is no other perceiver but he, there is no other thinker but he.

Thus, the earliest references to the notion of antaryämin are to be found in the Šatapathabráhmana and the upani$ads, especially in the ChU and BÄU, from which is quoted ‘There is not the least diversity here [in brahman]*. In Vai$nava Vedanta, the antaryämin, which occurs first in the enum eration of the states or modes of the paramdtman, appears as a tattva. Different is the later vedäntic conception of the antaryämin; see, for instance, Pancadáši V I236; also BSBh 12, 5 ,1 8 (which discusses BÄU III 7), in which Šaňkara holds that the antaryämin is effectively the ätman, and is distinguished, at least provisionally, from the jiva (this being wholly determined by mdyd), whereas what one has called the antaryämin represents the core of what is real in the heart"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"KÂRIKÂ27157conscious principle has been formulated as supreme], what has not been recognized is the freedom of that conscious principle (vedana), which, en­dowed with life,672 becomes the efficient cause673 of the construction of the universe.674However, others, the Prànabrahmavâdins [viz., the Brahmavádins who hold that brahman is cosmic Breath], maintain that the entire universe has come into being in accordance with the act of breathing (prànana), once the resolve [of creating the universe] has been formed (âgùrya) [or, once [the brahman-prana] has proclaimed it].675 And since, according toof the living being — impossible to slough off. Evidently, the antaryámin is ‘considered from the vyávahárika point of view’, but, at the same time, transcends that point of view — it is not the jfva, and to it is not attributed any ‘creative* role. Similarly, Ramanuja identifies the antaryámin with Nàràyana, arguing against a púrvapaksa which would have it the same as the jiva.672jivitabhûta — such terminology implicitly contests the vedântic’s view that brahman is sànta.673hetu — efficient or ‘impelling’ cause (according to the grammatical acceptation of the term — specifically, the causative 'agent* as contrasted with the embedded ‘agent*: P. 14,55).

Kallafa’s Tattvavicâra quoted in SpP 1, p. 9: áaktiprasarasaňkocanibaddháv udayavyayau/ yasyâtmâ sa čivo jňeyah sarvabhávapravartakah//, ‘[All things] arise and fall away in conso­nance with the extension and withdrawal of [Siva’s] power. Know that their essential nature is Šiva, Who impels all things* (tr. Dyczkowski SpK: 145).674According to the Trika, the inadequacy of the ¿àntabrahm avâda consists in its consid­ering brahman as pure prakáša, inherently luminous consciousness, devoid of self-awareness (vimaria), or dynamic freedom (svàtantrya); see SpN ad I 5. Same argument in YR ad 15. See also SpN I 4, quoted in Appendix 16, p. 340. It is TÀV I 33 which, in order to establish the svátantryaváda, develops his criticisms of the Vijňánaváda.675The entire passage is quite puzzling. A number of texts refer to those named Pranavids, or Prânâtmavàdins. For instance, according to ŠSV I 1 (quoted n. 661), they are Vaidikas. Cf. AŠ II 20, dealing with the different conceptions of the átman: ‘Comme étant l’Énergie pneumatique [le] conçoivent ceux qui connaissent l’énergie pneum atique’ (tr. Bouy — ‘It is conceived as pneumatic energy (prána) by those who know pneumatic energy’). According to Anubhûtisvarupa, Anandagiri and Svayaipprakâiànanda ad loc., the Prànavids are the Hairanyagarbhas, worshipers of the Hiranyagarbha eulogized in ÇS X 121, who take the prána to be the ‘creator of the world’ (jagatkartf), or, if prána is taken to be íšvara, the Lord, those who, like the Vaiieçikas, consider the Lord as the efficient cause (see Bouy AŠ: 127). Nevertheless, such an identification creates a problem: can these Hairanyagarbhas, whoever they may be, be understood as the savimaršašabdabrahmavádins of YR’s commentary? There remains the possibility that these Brahmavádins are to be identified with Bhartj*hari and his followers — the key to the puzzle being the reference here to the word ágůr(ya)t although the word is itself as puzzling as the entire passage. However that may be, the different usages of the term agree with the sense, well attested in the older language, of the root gur/gur (related to the root gf or gf by the majority of philologists): at issue is the articulation of a formula with ritual function in the course of a rite of some sort. Later lexicographers add the nuance of ‘proposition’, inasmuch as the majority of such formulae am ount to invitations or to requests for actions. It should not then be surprising that the term figures here in the dissection of theses attributed to the Prànabrahmavâdins, who would derive the cosmos from a similar ‘proposition’ articulated quasi-verbally by “(Šabda)brahman”. It is perhaps due to that ambiguity that our text does not specify the agent of the act of elocution, but the doctrinal context allows one to suppose that it is either brahman or the force of “breath” that brahman represents. Thus, it seems that YR expounds here the view (shared by Bhartjhari and others) that words precede the things they name in the order of creation. Such speculations echo the šaňkarite exegesis of ChU 111, 4-5, whose conclusion is that *prána is brahman*"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"158TRANSLATIONthem, brahman has no form other than Breath, brahman is Word [itself] (šabdabrahman) endowed with self-awareness (savimarfa).676 Others are agreed that the true form of brahman is the Sovereign Body (viràddeha)677 [that is, the cosmic body {deha), or creation] that has as­sumed the shape of Viráj (vairaja) — in accordance with such texts as: The One, of whom fire is the mouth, heaven the head, sky [space] the navel, earth the feet, the sun the eye, directions the ears, homage to him who is in the form of the universe.678(BSBh I 1, 9, 23). Though Bhartj-hari’s philosophy does not give as much emphasis to the notion as it receives here, the view espoused is in conformity with his theory of four stages of enunciation — pašyanti, etc. (see, nevertheless, VP I 117: tasya práne ca yá šaktiryá ca buddhau vyavasthità). According to Bharti-hari, whom YR is probably following here, prána plays a prominent role at the fourth and third levels of linguistic activity: vaikhari — where takes place articulation into phonemes, as prána, in its gross or physical form, strikes against the various organs of articulation (cf. VP 1 122) — and madhyamá — in which intentions are formulated mentally. Consequently, prána represents as much the differentiated world as the cosmic principle from which it proceeds (on this question, see Iyer 1992: 123ff., 143-146, 106ff.). It seems, therefore, that the views attributed by YR to the Prânabrahmavâdins agree with Bhartfhari’s theory according to which things are produced by word: chandobhya eva prathamam etad višvam vyavartata (VP I 120); see also Ruegg 1959: 61 (n. 2c), 76-79. Moreover, such speculations may also imply a tradition of exegesis in which vedic speech, represented by the syllable om, is considered to be at the core of the cosmic process — a tradition going back perhaps to ÇS X 121 (Max Müller’s hymn to ‘Deo ignoto’), in which Hiranyagarbha, identified with Breath (asu)t is said to be the effective source of creation, therefore associated (though later) with Prajâpati. In the same way, Breath is extolled as the cosmic principle in Atharvaveda XI 4, whose last stanza (possibly a later addition) compares it to Hiranyagarbha. Thus, the Prânabrahmavâdins, in YR’s commentary, are less likely to be Hairanyagarbhas (commonly referred to as Prànavids, or Prânâtmavâdins) than followers of Bhartfhari, described in our text as identifying prána as the source of the entire cosmos.6760 n the notion of šabdabrahman, see also Sámbapaňcášiká 21 (along with K$emarâja ad loc., in Padoux Sámbapaňcášiká: 569): yac tad vedyam kim api paramam šabdatattvam tvam [...] tat sad vyaktim jigimifu [...] avyaktena pranavavapusá [...] sacchabdabrahmaoccarati karanavyañjitam vácakam re//, ‘Quant à Ta nature ineffable, qu’il faut connaître, c’est que Tu es la réalité intérieure suprême de la Parole (paramam šabdatattvam) [...] voulant de­venir manifeste à partir de l’essence immanifeste du pranava.

[...] Once the organs of Speech are [internally] manifested, the true šabdabrahman, which is what expresses You, enunciates itself].677The Sovereign Body (viràddeha) is the cosmic body, seen as the creation (deha) of Virâj, the cosmic ‘Sovereign’. The viráj is, according to the traditional etymology, the ‘all resplen­dent’, or the ‘Sovereign (per se)’: višesena rájate id viráj. On viráj, considered both as a meter of ten syllables and as a demiurge, see ChU IV 3, 7-8. Senart observes (ChU: 49) that ‘Vi­ráj’, the cosmic ‘Sovereign’ seems to correspond to the totality of the sensible world (n. 2), whereas the meter ‘virâj’ is to be considered as the expression of this world (n. 4).

It is characterized [in this doctrine] by using terms such as ‘universal’ (sâmânya) and ‘being as such’ [or the ‘universal per se’] (ma- hâsattâ).681Others maintain682 that particulars (pinda = vyakti)663 are ultimatelyof consciousness coincide with the four elements or instants of the syllable om. According to À$V 3 — which establishes the correspondence between the divine Viraj and the lowest level of the âtman, the vaüvànara — to take brahman to be Viraj signifies, even in a vedàntic context, that one’s course has been interrupted on the way to liberation.679The opposition vyakti/âkfti, ‘particular [thing)/com m on [form]’ has been subjected to much scrutiny by Vaiie$ikas, Naiyàyikas, MImamsakas and Vaiyâkaranas, as have been the related notions of jâti, sàmânya, pinda and dravya. For the Mîmàmsà, cf. ¿àbarabhâsya 13, 30: kà punar âkptih kà vyaktir in / dravyagunakarmanàm sâmànyamàtram âkptih/ asâdhâranaviéeçà vyaktih, ‘Qu’est-ce que Vakpa? Qu’est-ce que la vyakti? Vakfti, ce n ’est rien d ’autre que le trait commun — sâmânya — aux substances, aux qualités et aux actions. Quant à la vyakti, c’est la particularité individuelle — asâdhâranavüefa’ (tr. Biardeau 1964: 167) [— ‘What is àkfti? What is vyakti? The àkfti is nothing else than the feature common Csâmânya) to substances, qualities and actions. The vyakti is the uncommon particular — asàdhàranavife$a']\\ cf. also Mahàbhàfya I 2 6, opposing vyakdvâdin and àkftivàdin. Biardeau observes [1964: 292ff.) that Bhartj-hari, in dealing with the same notions, transforms the views of Patanjali and of the Mïmâmsâ. On these questions, see Biardeau 1964: 68-100; 155-203; 229-247; 292ff.680paramàrthasat is a term not well suited to a Vaiieçika context, implying as it does, degrees of “reality”. ‘Ultimately real’ may serve as a translation if one understands ‘w hat is real in and of itself, w ithout qualification’. The problem of translation is essentially unresolvable because one cannot set aside the fact that here a partisan of monism is speaking of systems that are in no wise monist.681YR’s account partly agrees with Vai$e$ika doctrine according to which ‘being’ (satta), as the ultim ate form of commonness (parasâmànya), represents the category of commonness (sâmânya) as such (cf. Frauwallner 1973, vol. II: 104 and 175-177). See Appendix 15, p. 339.682The passage seems, in quarrels with the other schools on the ‘meaning of the sentence’ (iâbdabodha), to echo the position of the later Nyâya-Vatée$ika, which has insisted that the word refers literally only to the vyakti, and secondarily to the jati. In this sense, a £aiva such as YR may have understood that the Vyaktivàdins considered the vyakti an ultimate principle. See Nyàyabhàfya [NBh) II 2, 58-69, in which the Vyaktivàdin is perhaps a fol­lower of Vyâ<ji, an early grammarian, many of whose notions have been refuted by later Pànintyas; Vyâdi teaches that the word refers to dravya, the ‘particular’, understood as a concrete thing (see Frauwallner 1973, vol. II: 101-102); on Vyâdi, see Ruegg 1959: 32-34; Renou 1940: intr., p. 19. As well, the point of view expressed here is consonant with that of the Càrvàkas, according to the few authentic records of that school — a single authen­tic text of that “school” is thought to survive, the Tattvopaplavasimha; other references are found in always hostile compendia, such as the Sarvadarianasamgjraha — where an attem pt is made to dem onstrate (ironically?) that ‘perception’ (pratyaksa) alone, which is always restricted to particulars, guarantees any semblance of validity, and that no ‘inference’ can be deemed certain, inasmuch as the universal (vyàpd) on which it depends can never extend, given our limited purview, to all possible instances. May also be intended here (so Ruegg, private communication) the Buddhist Pramânavàda (Dignâga, Dharmaklrti, etc.), where the universal (sâmânya, jâti), as opposed to svalaksana (the term vyakti not being employed in this school) is not real.

[In conclusion] we hold that ‘all these are for purposes of disputation only’. Since, in this doctrine of [Siva’s absolute] freedom (svatantryavada), the self-manifesting (pra/casa- mana) reality cannot be concealed,687 those different categories do appear [also] as relative truths (samvrtisatya), but, in ultimate terms, none of them exist [as characterizations of the Ultimate], that is, they do not exist in essence [i.e., in truth];688 they do exist as categories postulated in other systems of thought.Therefore, it is the one Great Lord — namely, [one’s own] conscious­ness, the supremely real, the ultimate Light, the utterly free — who appears (cakaste) variously [i.e., who appears as manifold], for there is nothing other than he that is different from him, and hence lacking in illumination, that can manifest itself.689Biardeau (1964: 33) — synonym of vyakti, see Sabarabhdsya I 6, 6, 19.684Cf.

Thus, YR’s phrase — ‘Ordinary usage (vyavahdra) [which deals exclusively] with particulars (vyakti), is sufficient’ — can be seen as a resume of NBh I I 2, 59ff., which enum er­ates the following worldly pursuits and usages and makes the same point for each of them: group (samuha), gift (tyaga), possession (parigraha), number (samkhya), increase (vpddhi), diminution (apacaya), color (varna), compound (samasa), lineage (anubandha); cf.

These systems are classified into ten types according to the level of reality they have been able to reach, a level again roughly related to the áaiva scale of the ratrvas. These levels (sthiri), which other systems have failed to go beyond, are to be understood as different modes of identification with the inner, ultimate reality. Moreover, in accordance with the recurrent metaphor of the Lord-actor, they are taken to be the dif­ferent roles through which the divine Actor manifests his essence. As the seven categories of subjects are seen as roles (bhumika) assumed by the Lord in SpN I 1 (see Appendix 10, p. 330), so it is with the forms of the Self presumed by the different schools of thought, as stated by PHvj- 8: evam ekasyaiva cidatmano bhagavatah svátantryávabhásitáh sarvá imá bhúmikáh svátantryapracchádanonmñanatáratamyabheditáh/ ata eka eva etávad vyáptika átmá, ‘Thus, the divine one, whose essence is consciousness, in his absolute freedom displays all these roles.

The usage of the term here indicates that the terms cit and dnanda are in this sense unqualified, inasmuch as they are universal and cannot be limited by anything whatsoever (which, if it were supposed, would contradict their comprehensiveness); see the use of the positive avacchinna in YR ad 58.702That is, the first level of error consisting in taking the Self as non-Self; in other words, not recognizing one’s own essential plenitude, giving therefore rise to the belief in otherness.

In this absolute, nondual state, whose nature is that of Light, who is there other [than he]?*709This extremely condensed statem ent includes an objection, which is not explicitly indi­cated as such, and its answer. The position of the Traika siddhdntin is that no entity can exist, absent its cognition, and that there can be no cognition without a persisting factor, which is consciousness: whatever exists, i.e., whatever is known, is nothing but Light/consciousness, or, to put it differently, Light/consciousness is the unique cause of the appearance of an entity. The siddhdntin answers here the objection of a purvapakfin according to whom some other cause independent of Light/consciousness, such as the latent dispositions (vasand), may explain this shining, or cognition, w hether true or erroneous. For, if we try to reconstruct the objector’s argument, why does one see a snake, and not a garland, in a rope? In other words, why are things known in a particular way, sometimes differing from one individual to another? The objector would answer that one’s own vdsanas produce the erroneous cogni­tion as well as the fear it involves: the latent impression of a snake lies in us, along with the disposition of fear, when conditions are brought together, this latent impression makes the snake appear in our consciousness, instead of the rope, and this implies the correlated terror. The siddhantin's refutation follows the same fundamental assumption: the cognition (hence the existence) of an object necessarily depends on consciousness. In other words, conscious­ness is both luminous in and of itself (svaprakafa) and object-illuminating (arthaprakafa) (cf. IPVI 3, 6-7). The opponent who would have recourse to vdsanas (presumably removed from present sentience) as the cause of this cognition would have to admit that vdsanas themselves are ultimately not different from consciousness. The reference is probably to Buddhists (par­ticularly the Vijnanavadins; see n. 666) and Vedantins, who take beginningless avidya, or, what is the same thing, beginningless dispositions, to be the cause of the illusory phenom e­nal world.

Upade/asahasri 51: avidyd nama anyasminn anyadharmadhyd- ropand, ‘Nescience is [defined as] the superimposition of the qualities of [one] thing upon another’.

Thinking that ‘whatsoever appears, I am not that’, they maintain that the Self is but that Void, defined as the absence of any [cognizable] content whatsoever,742 whose essence is the negation of all [definite cognition]. [This Void] is expressed here by the term ‘sky’ (nabhas).But there is another ‘Void’ (iunya) — that of the Brahmavada743 —each school developing its own views on the way buddhi stands for the Self. It seems likely, therefore, that here, the ‘etc.’ refers to YogScSras and NaiySyikas.738The MTmamsakas’ purpose is to disclose the rationality inherent in the law of karman: the doer and the experiencer are one and the same person, even if the fruits of his acts are experienced after some delay, in another birth even. Therefore, they postulate a ‘soul’, puryastaka, which transmigrates from one birth to another. Thus the puryastaka, composed of eight elements, among which the subdest is buddhi, both acts and experiences the fruits of its actions, in the form of pleasure and pain. SpN I 4 presents a similar exposition of the MTmamsaka view of the Self (see n. 740). In addition, it shows that such a view, although not fully satisfactory, implies its own completion. In effect, to consider the Self as the expe­riencer, or the T , o f ‘1 am happy’, ‘1 am sad’, is undoubtedly a progress with regard to those, Carv&kas and the untutored, who take the body to be the Self, and thus know only ‘1 am thin’, i am fat’.739buddhidharma — here, buddhidharma appears to be understood in the sense of buddhyu- padhit ‘extrinsic affectation of the intellect* (and not in the sense of the eight buddhidharmas: dharma, jnana, vairagya, aiivarya, and their opposites), since pleasure and pain are so char­acterized in Trika texts — cf.

SpK I 4 and SpV ad loc. speak of [buddhyjavasthd.740 It may be interesting to compare this passage with Ksemaraja’s refutation — from the Trika point of view — of MIm&msaka doctrine, ad SpK I 4: aham sukhl ca duhkhl ca raktaf ca ityddisomvidah/ sukhddyavasthanusyute vartante ’nyatra tdh sphutam/ / , ‘ MI am happy, I am sad, I am devoted” — these and other cognitions have evidently their basis in some other [substratum] (anyatra) threaded through the states of happiness, etc., [like jewels on a neck­lace, or flowers on the string of a garland]’; note that SpN I 4 glosses sukhddyavasthanusyute of the ka. as: antahsraksutrakalpataya sthitet ‘which is like the cord within [and binding to­gether] the garland of flowers’; cf.

The difference appears to be but a question of method— Buddhists say that the Void is the Void, namely, that it is apprehended only as such, whereas Advaitins want to particularize it, as it were, by distributing it over several acts of negation, in keeping with the formula ‘neti netf. Thus it seems that YR wants to associate the Advaitins to the iunyavada while distinguishing them from the Madhyamikas, by taking recourse to a literal reading of ‘neri nea’, which seems to pluralize the notion of Void."},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"172TRANSLATIONwhose partisans maintain that, in the process of meditation Csamadhana), when it is realized that ‘here is another absence Ofunya) [that] is not my­self, they then posit that other absence as the Self,744 in accordance with the formula ‘not this, not this’; 745 this amounts to giving up one partic­ular Void and grasping [in its place] another, in series, as the essence of the Void.These [latter speculations] have been characterized as ‘th e expanse of th e Void*746 in the karika.Furthermore, because they have not determined the nature [of the Self] to be consciousness, those ascetics (yogiri) who take the Void to be the Self — themselves insentient747 and confused, immersed as they are in the cave of deep sleep — fetter the Self with insentience, the Self that is essentially consciousness.748744‘When, at the moment [or in the process] of meditation (samadhana) [...]’: here, the con­cept of abhavasamadhi, ‘absorption in the Void*, that the ¿aivas ascribe to such ‘nihilists* as the Vedantins and the Madhyamikas, is referred to and refuted, as is also done in SpK 1 12-13, SpN and SpP ad loc.

See Appendix 18, p. 342.746SpN 1 12-13 (Kaul Shastri: 28) denounces it as an ‘unfathomable abyss of supreme delu­sion’ (agadhe mahamohe) into which the ¿unyavadins throw themselves and others.747Cf. SpK I 13a: atas tat kftrimam jneyam sausuptapadavat [...]/, ‘Hence, that [viz., non- being (abhava)] should be considered a factitious [state] similar to deep sleep’; in other words, the abhavasamadhi is taken to be a state of naught and insentience only in a hyperbolic or transitory sense, as is the case w ith deep sleep. For when one awakes from deep sleep, one knows that he has experienced, adventitiously, that state of naught and insentience; cf. SpN 113a: ato mohavasthaiva sa kalpita tatha smaryamanatvat sa cdnubhuyamanatvad anubhavituh pramatur avasthatprupasya pratyuta sattdm avedayate na tv abhavam iti, ‘Hence, that state of insentience is but a presumption (kalpita), since thus it is recollected (smaryamana). On the contrary, the fact that such a state is experienced attests to the existence (satta) of the experiencer (anubhavitp), of the cognizer (pramatp), who is the substratum (avasthatf) of that experience, and not of any non-being (abhava) [or Void]’.748The experience of the Void remains an intelligible experience (pratipatti), which the yogin thus construes, after he has emerged from samadhi: ‘I was profoundly unconscious’ (gddhamudho ’ham as am). Therefore the experience is not possible without an experiencer, that is to say, without consciousness itself. Insentience cannot as a consequence characterize such an experience. Thus the Trika has formulated three objections against the iunyavada: 1) Taking the Self as a Void, defining it negatively, amounts to a regressus ad infinitum, for this involves the aporia that the object negated has by that fact been adm itted. 2) Taking the Self as a Void implies its insentience. 3) From the Trika perspective, it is impossible to conceive the all-vibrating and fulgurating Self or consciousness as inert and insentient. On this argum ent as to the intrinsic dynamism of the Self or consciousness and the correl­ative principle of its sovereign freedom, see YR ad 27: ‘In both these [doctrines, though the conscious principle has been formulated as supreme], w hat has not been recognized is the freedom (svatantrya) of that conscious principle which, endowed with life, becomes the [efficient] cause of the construction of the universe’; see also K$emaraja’s discussion on the"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"KARIKA33173How strange! — that is, how astonishing this all is!

As observed by Mahadevan (1975: 21), it seems that srçtisthiti- samhàra, ‘creation, maintenance and dissolution’, are paraphrases of àdimadhyanidhana, ‘be­ginning, middle and end’, in apposition with vidvataijasapràjna, in APS 31.765... for it is the force behind their appearance.

Silbum adopts the first possibility: ‘Pourtant (ce quatrièm e) ne se révèle plus lorsqu’il est recouvert par ces (diverses conditions)’. We prefer the second as does YR. The negation then includes àvftam rather than excludes it. The ambiguity of the verse is perhaps not foreign to AG’s purposes, for reading it in one way expresses the standpoint of the padu, and in the other that of the Lord. The latter interpretation is supported by Râghavànanda's Vivarana (p. 18) on the slightly different form of the kârikâ in ÀPS (kâ. 31, quoted above): bhramabhütair iti jâgradâdinâm mithyâbhütatvân na vastutais turyam tiraskftam ràhunevâdityah, ‘By saying [that the three anterior states] “have become illusion”, it is meant that, since waking, etc., are false, the Fourth state is not in reality concealed by them — as is the sun by Ràhu’. châditam, here, is to be read in relation to bhramabhütais, so that châditam assumes in effect the meaning of achâditam — if the Fourth state is concealed by something unreal, it is in fact not concealed.

Not only does the dreaming subject ‘experience the subtle’: praviviktabhuj (ÄS I 3), but also ‘the sub­tle satisfies him’: tarpayate [...] viviktam tu taijasam (ÁŠ I 4). This is the state of internal cognition: antahprajüä (MäU 4; AŠ 1 1). Compare the following upani$adic passages, which predate the formulation of the notion of tejas/taijasa and its incorporation into the doctrine of the ätman's quadripartition: BÄU IV 3, 9: sa [purusah] yatra prasvapiti asya lokasya sarvävato mäträm apädäya svayam vihatya svayam nirmäya svena bhäsä svena jyotisä prasvapiti/ atrayaip purusah svayam jyotir bhavati, ‘When he goes to sleep, he takes along the material (mäträ) of this all-embracing world, himself tears it apart, himself builds it up; he sleeps (dreams) by his own brightness, by his own light. In that state the person becomes self-illuminated’; and BÄU IV 3 ,1 4 : atho khaiv áhuh jágaritadeéa eväsyai$ah/ yäni hy eva jägrat pašyaú táni supta id/ aträyam puru$ah svayam jyotir bhavati, ‘Others, however, say that (the state of sleep) is just his waking state for w hatever objects he sees when awake, those too, he sees, when asleep; (not so) for in the dream-state the person is self-illuminated’.781 This Light is the manifesting power of brahman.782Cf. BÄU IV 3, 11: svapnena šáríram abhiprahatya/ asuptah suptán abhicáka&i//, ‘Having struck down in sleep what belongs to the body, he himself sleepless looks down, on the sleeping (senses)’.783For avidyä operates in the “objective” world, whereas the cause of whatever is experi­enced within a dream is to be found in dreaming itself or in the dreamer. The discussion will be taken up again in YR ad 48. Cf. BÄUBh IV 3, 9: the dream is circumscribed by the body of the dreamer, a ‘dream body’ (svapnadeha), ‘constituted of latent dispositions’ (vásanámaya), ‘like a mäyic (or magic) body’ (máyámayam iva) — ‘svayam nirmáya’nirmánam kftvá vásaná- mayam svapnadeham máyámayam iva. According to Hiriyanna, Šaňkara’s máyá and avidyá are to be understood as more or less referring to the same thing. If a distinction is to be forced, one may be taken to represent the “objective” side of the phenomenal world, the other its “subjective” side — but the distinction itself illustrates the force of mdya, and a fortiori, of avidyä. In other words, bound souls are the substratum of avidyá; whereas the substratum of máyá is íšvara, who casts illusions on the bound souls as does a magician who is not trapped by it. And such is the deeply rooted effect of máyá that each bound soul clings to his ignorance; máyá is meant for elseone, not for íšvara.784The passage explains in what m anner the dreaming subject experiences phenomena in their subtle form. See AŠ II 1-5, which discusses the unreality of dream-phenomena from a logical perspective.78SCf.

To the sovereign freedom of the Lord corresponds the equal freedom of the finite dreamer.791 Quoted in Vdkyapadtyaxjtti [VPvj*] I 119. The reading is vedànteçu, in KSTS and in all our manuscripts, except for the Wilson MS, which reads veddntisu. We have opted for the reading veddntesu — in any case more satisfactory grammatically. This verse is found as a quote in VPvj I 119 [119 Iyer = 127 Biardeau], with one variant: pravartate instead of prakddate. Iyer translates (p. 115): ‘The Lord of All, the All-embracing, the Enjoyer, after dividing Himself and after having created many different things, proceeds to sleep’. Biardeau has (p. 163): ‘Se divisant lui-même et créant des objets de toutes sortes, le sujet devient, dans le rêve, souverain de toutes choses et fait de toutes choses’ [— ‘Dividing himself and creating objects of all kinds, the subject becomes, in dreaming, the sovereign of all things and is made of all things’]. The verse seems to have been famous in the ¿aiva circles, for Ràmakantha quotes it — although with two variants: sarvadaktih, ‘endowed with all powers’ (for sarvamayah) and prapadyate (for pravartate) — in his Vivpti to SpK III 1-2 (p. 102), in"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"KARIKA 35181Thus, the cause here [viz., of what is experienced in dream] is the glo­rification (mâhâtmya) of his Light alone [that is, the glorification implicit in his power of manifestation].Therefore, the dream of brahman is the condition termed ‘Splendor’ (te- jas) [namely, ‘dream’ (in the kârikâ) refers to the luminous state of brah­man[].Likewise, th e state of sleep is [th a t of] the [pure] Knower.The state o f sleep (suptävasthä), that is the deep sleep (susupta) of all cognizers is called the ‘Know er’ (prâjna) ,792 meaning that it is the knowing state (prâjnâvasthâ) of brahman.That is to say, in deep sleep, only the Wisdom (prajhâ) 793 of brahmanthe context of the Lord’s revealing himself in dream to the yogin. Now, what is the source of this verse? Ramakanfha attributes it to Bhartjfhari, from which statem ent we may infer that Ramakan(ha, and probably other Kashmirian ¿aivites, considered BhartjTiari to be the author of the Vftti. The question that remains is whether Bhartjhari too cites the verse, or w hether it is his own (see Biardeau [VP: 1621, who observes that the northern manuscripts attribute the verse to Bhartjhari himself)- Although, as observed by Biardeau (p. 163), the text sounds rather upani$adic (‘La résonance en est plutôt upaniçadique’), the verse has not been traced in the upaniçadic corpus. Taking into account three indices, it may be inferred that this passage of YR’s commentary on the dream state reflects the views of the Grammarians, whose affinity with the Trika is so marked that YR believes himself able to reformulate in Traika terms Bhartfhari’s positions: the three are 1) the source of the quote (VPvj 1 119 [ = 127]; 2) die presence of the same key*term, pravibhajya, both in YR’s gloss and in the quote supporting it; and 3) the frequency of the dream metaphor in the VP and in its Vjm — see, besides VP 119 and its Vftti quoted here, VPvj-11: [...] vivartah / svapnavisayapratibhasavat, ‘Phenomenal manifestation is like the appearances in a dream ’; VPvj I 4: ekasya hi brahmartas [...] svapnavijnânapurufavad abahistattvâh [...] bhoktfbhoktavyabhogagfanthayo vivartante, ‘In this One brahman [...], “knots” of the nature of subject, object and experience manifest, having no external reality, like the beings perceived in dream ’. It seems indubitable, then, that in introducing a citation that is to be found ‘vedäntesu’, YR is referring to a commentary on Bhartj-hari (and, perhaps, of Bhartfhari); it follows that the ‘Brahmavadin’ whose doctrine is supported by the quote is a ¿abdabrahm avadin, that is, a grammarian of the school of Bhartfhari. Moreover, it is noteworthy that early (preiahkarite) Vedanta, the VP widi its Vftti, and the Trika, all have a similar conception of diversity: they hold that phenomenal muldplicity is not illusory, that, in its subtle form, it is the Lord’s ‘manifestation’ (pratibhâsa, in VP; âbhàsa, in Trika), wherein the Lord as consciousness — as in a dream — appears as the triad of subject, object and experience itself.792prajna — the term is variously translated: ‘Understanding’ (Barnett PS: 731); the ‘Cogni- tional’ (Hume BÄU: 392); ‘wise’ and ‘intelligent’ (Bhattacharya ÄS);4 “serenely” aware* (Fort 1990: 151); the ‘enlightened’, the ‘knower’ (Gupta Âé: 180, 181); ‘le Percipient’ (Bouy Àé: 86). The first occurrence of the term is probably found at BÄU IV 3, 21, which describes deep sleep through the m etaphor of the man who “knows nothing without or w ithin” while in the arms of his beloved.

It is the state o f ‘massive cognition’, variously termed prajnânaghana (MäU 5) (‘masse de pure conscience objectale’, so Bouy, p. 86), ghanaprajna (Ä£ I 1), and jnânaghana, as here, in PS 35.793So generally Conze 1974; Bugault 1968 translates ‘la sapience’."},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"182TRANSLATIONremains, who has become thus the seed of the universe.794[Deep sleep] is the great Void (mahasunya) ,795 where objects, etc., are dissolved, where root impressions796 only remain, inasmuch as phenom­enal display has vanished for all knowers, [along with] the dichotomy of knower and known.

It is found in TAV V 8a (citing the first verse: yady apy arthasthitih...), IPV I 3 ,7 (vol. 1:143; first verse), IPV 18, 9 (vol. I: 420; citing the same verse and a half as in YR), IP W I 3, 7 (vol. I: 287; citing the pratika: yady apy arthasthitih), iP W I 8 ,1 0 (vol. II: 433; citing the pratika), and PM 19. There is no explicit attribution (w hether title or author) in TAV V 8a, nor in IP W I 3, 7. Nevertheless, IP W I 8 ,1 0 attributes it explicitly to the APS, as does the PM. On the other hand, IPV I 3, 7 cites it as that of ‘the dcdrya* (*yad uktam acaryenaiva' — which is glossed by Bhaskara: ‘atrdcaryasammatim aha’), and IPV 18, 10 as that of ‘the granthakpt' Cyathoktam granthakptaiva' — glossed by Bhaskara: €atra drimad utpaladevasya sammadm aha’ and: ‘granthakrtd — drimad utpaladevena’). From these occurrences, it can be inferred that the author of the verse is Utpala, and that the text from which it is borrowed is the APS, rather than the NV — inasmuch as AG almost always refers explicitly to the NV when he cites it: *yan Naredvaravivekah* or *tathd Naredvaravivekah’, as observed by A. Sanderson (pri­vate correspondence). Despite the manuscripts of the Paramdrthasdravivptti [PSV], there is little chance that the verse here cited by YR belongs to the NV, unless we admit that the verse is present in the two texts. Still, YR attributes this verse to his paramesfhin, the guru of the guru of his guru, that is, to Utpala (if the parampard is as follows: K$emaraja, Abhi- navagupta, Utpaladeva) — unless it is to Laksmanagupta that the verse is to be attributed, as proposed by A. Sanderson. On this basis, it might be supposed that YR could have been mistaken in the m atter of the text’s name, and that the source of that confusion might be that the two texts had the same author, Utpaladeva — a mistake that could easily have happened, inasmuch as the two passages in the Vimardini where the verse here cited by YR appears refer only to the author, and that only generically, as dcdrya or granthakpt, and not to the work’s title. The hypothesis that the NV be attributed to Utpala would explain as well the evident doctrinal relationship of the NV and the IPK, and the many times the IPK cites the NV. It re­mains surprising, however, that AG cites the NV w ithout ever mentioning that it is the work of Utpala (or of another of his teachers). R. Torella (private correspondence), recognizing an ‘Utpala-like’ character in the NV, may be mentioned as providing further support for this thesis."},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"KARIKA 37187Although common experience,824 is conditioned825 by refer­ence to embodied souls limited by breath and the subtle body, yet it is anchored also in the supreme Self.

The fumigation or perfuming of the space in the jar, which makes the space unique, corresponds, as upameya in the analogy, to the vâsanâs, the dispositions responsible for the seeming individuations of the universal àtman. YR is playing here, at the end, on the etymological ambiguity of the terms vàsanâ and adhivàsita, which may be derived either from the root vas, ‘to dwell’ (a more probable etymo­logy, according to Renou 1997, vol. II: 778, who translates ‘residence’), or vás, ‘to perfume*.832Note the unique character of space (ákála) among the elements enum erated by the Vaiie$ikas; it is said not to be a sámánya, ‘universal*, precisely because, unlike all the other elements, it has no instances.833ÁŠ III 6 formulates the same truth: rûpakâryasamâkhyâà ca bhidyante tatra tatra vai/ ákášasya na bhcdo 'sti tadvaj jîveçu nirnayah/ / , ‘The form, the function and the denomination [of the spaces contained in jars, etc.] differ indeed from one to another, although difference cannot be predicated of space itself.

Symmetrically, karikas 39-40 expound the reverse process, that of liberation through knowledge, or enlightenment, i.e., through the realization, or ‘recognition’, of ultim ate reality.848There are two levels or grades of the error that constitutes human finitude (see, infra, TAV V 105b-107a, vol. Ill: 1032). The first, described in PS 25 and 30, consists in taking the Self to be the non-Self, i.e., in forgetting one’s own plenitude and in apprehending oneself as a finite subject, defined in relation to an object. Thereupon intervenes the second level of e rr o r taking the non-Self (body, buddhi, etc.) to be the Self, that is, predicating the Self of the non-Self, so that we assert ‘I am fat*, *1 am intelligent’, etc. As PS 31 formulates it, it is error heaped upon error (Tengr^gement de m al\\ to borrow from L’Avane), ‘darkness upon darkness’ (timirdd api timiram idem), or, having recourse to another analogy: ‘a great “pustule upon a boil” ’ (gandasyopari mahdn ayam sphotah). Similar speculations on the two grades of error are seen throughout the PS (see YR ad 53, 60) and are also present in texts such as I 11, 13, 15.

The doctrine of the updyas has been con­siderably developed in the Trika at the instigation of AG who dedicates to their exposition, partly or entirely, the first five chapters of his TA. InTA 1 167-170, AG presents the doctrine as derived from the MVT, the authoritative Scripture in this system, of which he quotes three verses (MVT II 23, 22 and 21), and says (TA I 213) that he received this system of classifica­tion from his teacher Sambhunatha. To the original threefold classification, AG adds a fourth category, the anupaya, or ‘non-means’, ‘non-way’. TA I 171-232 expounds in detail the four updyas, anavopaya, daktopaya, Iambhavopaya and anupaya, beginning with the lowest (on the four, see TA I-V, Silbum, Padoux TA: 52-60). That the daktopaya is alluded to within the span of karikas 39-46 is shown by the avat. ad 39, which states that ‘the error is completely uprooted in the process of achieving enlightenment (jnaptikramena)’. For what distinguishes the ¿aktopaya from the higher ddmbhavopdya is precisely its discursive and sequential charac­ter, inseparable from recourse to ‘enlightenment’ and the practice of yoga. The daktopaya is also called jnanopaya, ‘means (or way) of knowledge’, thus named, for Siva, as ‘possessor of the dakti' (daktimat), is known through his dakti, who further divides herself into Will {iccha), Knowledge (Jnana) and Action (kriya). It is also called jnanadaktyupaya, ‘means of cognitive energy’, for it consists in the yogin’s transforming his jnanadakti, his cognitive energy, into an intuition, a mystical realization — bhavana in this system, ddmbhavopdya is characterized by non-discursivity and immediacy; daktopaya by discursivity and mediacy. ddmbhavopdya and daktopaya are respectively the effects of an ‘extremely intense grace’ (tivrativrasaktipata) and of a ‘moderately intense grace’ (tivramadhyadaktipdta). Thus, TAV (ad III 292, vol. II: 693) adduces the absence of ‘extremely intense grace’ as reason for the inability to follow the ‘way of ¿am bhu’, and later observes (TAV IV 276b) that ‘the one purified by the most intense grace’ is purified (pavitrita) with the ddmbhavopdya: kadcid eva tivratamadaktipdta’ pavitritah* The repeated definition of the ddmbhavopdya is Makimciccintana\", the ‘thought of nothing’, that is, the experience of non-discursive consciousness (see TA I 168a = MVT II 23, which defines him who attains the ddmbhavopdya as “akimciccintaka\"; I 171; V 156b), whereas the meditative or mystical realization (bhavand), discursive by nature, character­izes the daktopaya; cf.

Silbum 1981: 194), which concludes: na hi éuddhir vastuno rûpam nilatvavat, anyatra tasyaiva aéuddhicodanàt, ‘Purity indeed does not constitute the essence of the thing, as does the blue color, for, elsewhere [viz., in other schools], the same thing would be declared as impure and as such the object of an injunction’.861 Yâjnavalkyasmfti [YàjS] 18. The complete verse is: ijyàcâradamàhimsâdànasvàdhyàyakar- manam/ ayam tu paramo dharmo yad yogenàtmadaréanam//, ‘There are [dharmic] actions such as sacrifice, good conduct, restraint of the senses, non-violence, liberality, study of the Vedas, but above all, there is a supreme dharma, which is the witnessing of the Self through discipline’. YR’s version of the third pâda differs in a few particulars.^ T h e yoga referred to in the éàktopâya should not be mistaken for the type of practice proper to the ânavopàya; cf. TÀ IV 8 8 -1 09a, particularly 106-109a, which quotes MVT XVIII 74 (partly) and 78-79. TS IV, p. 27, defines the yoga proper to the éàktopâya: yad anapekçi- tavikalpam svàbhàvikam paramàrthatattvam prakàéate tasyaiva sanàtanatathâvidhaprakàéamd- tratàrùdhaye tatsvarûpânusandhànâtmà vikalpaviéeso yogah, lYoga [here] means a particular [mental discipline, the mind exercising itself] vis-à-vis alternatives (vikalpaviéesa), whose essence is concentration (anusandhàna) on the nature of the supreme truth that shines [in us] naturally and without alternative (anapekfitavikalpa), and is intended for confirming [or 'making commonplace’: rutfhi) that [truth] as nothing but that sempiternel shining (prakâéa) as such’.863The reference to yoga and buddhi is an additional sign that the éàktopâya is at stake here; see TÀ I 214-215.864BhG II 52.

Such a yogin — on whom acts cannot possibly be enjoined or forbidden (cf. TA IV 212-221 a — quotation from the MVT XVIII7 4-82 — and IV 271-278a) is thus a jivanmukta. Through one of the numerous etymological plays on the name Abhinavagupta, celebrated as the jivanmukta par excellence, TAV IV 278a further defines the jivanmukta as ‘the one protected Cgupta = parirakfita) everywhere (abhC = abhitah), i.e., from all differentiation, by the praise Cnava = stava) [of his own Self]’, who is therefore an ‘extraordinary’ (Jco ’pi, glossed as alaukikah) sage, ‘qualified [for that sacrifice (asmin... ydgavidhau) that is the practice of the idktopaya] ’.865From here, the style changes, now imbued with a mystical lyricism, equally evident in the karikas (notably 47-50, with the striking entrance into the discourse of the first person) and in the commentary (in 41-46, m etaphor follows upon metaphor and alliterations are frequent). As well, it is noteworthy that w . 39-49 have no corresponding verses in the APS, thus constituting a long parenthesis devoted to the esoteric teachings of the Trika. The correspondences resume with PS 50, which corresponds to APS 50 and APS 62. The syntax of this passage is complex. Grammatically, the entire avat. is one sentence, of which the main clause is our final paragraph (‘In su m ...’); what precedes is structured as three dependent clauses organized in three times around a gerund (abhidhdya, implying relative past time), a present participle (abhidadhat, implying correlation with the main verb, here simply aha), and a future participle (unmilayi$yat, implying intention), which we have separated also by paragraph indications. The avat. makes reference implicitly to the doctrine of the upayas, and particularly to two among them: the ¿dmbhava* and the ¿dkta\\ to which the terms idrpbhavapada and idktabhumika allude. It is in this context, implicitly established by ka. 38-40, that ka. 41-46 deal, sometimes allusively, with tantric practice, including mantras and mudrds, with special emphasis on the significance and potency of the m antra SAUH, which is also, according to AG, the esoteric purport of the entire PT, the text referred to by YR ad 43. According to the separate avat. to 43 and 46, what is at stake here, in these five karikas, is the esoteric mantric tradition (mantrasampradaya), especially that related to the m antra SAUH. Karikas 43-46 disclose (with the help of the commentary) the potency (virya) proper to the mantra SAUH, which itself depends on the higher potency of the supreme and primordial mantra, AHAM, which encloses in itself‘the full power of all the phonemes, from A to HA, of which mantras consist’ and draws them together ‘in a single point of concentrated energy, the bindu, M, its final letter)’ (Padoux 1992: 386); see n. 876.866tadabhedamayatd — cf.

Singh SpK: 11). Cf. the hymns of the Krama-Mahartha that celebrate the Kalis, emanations of the supreme Kali, who are also worshiped in the Wheel of energies: ¿nkalikastotra 11; Kramastotra 1; AG’s Kramastotra 10 (Silbum Anuttardsfikd).S73unmiiayisyat.874I.e., the pulsating Absolute, as invoked in the mangalacarana of Ksemar5ja’s Parapraveiikd: visvatmakdm tadutdrnam hrdayam parameiituh/ paradiiaktirupena sphurantim samvidam num ah//, ‘Adoration to the Heart (hfdaya) of the Supreme Lord, the absolute con­sciousness immanent in the universe and [as well] transcendent that manifests (sphuranti) in the form of the Supreme Sakti (pardiakti) and (in lesser powers], as well’. Thus, hfdaya is the Anuttara, the ‘unsurpassable’ in which Siva and Sakti unite, that is, the luminous con­sciousness (prakasa) and the Light of Light, the ‘self-referential consciousness’ (to borrow the term of Muller-Ortega 1997), named vimaria, of which spanda is one of the numerous synonyms. See also SpN IV 2: prakaiavimariatmakam hrdayam eva. Definitions of the divine Heart emphasize sometimes its Sakti dimension, sometimes its prakaia aspect, and some­times they combine both. Nevertheless, the Heart, or Absolute, is to be seen as a triangle, for, as will be stressed by YR in his commentary on 41, this Heart-Absolute is the place in which merge not only Siva and Sakti, but also nara, the finite soul, that is, the entire phenomenal world (Jagat). It is also what is taught by the gloss on the Parapraveiikd quoted above, but from the point of view of emanation: iha khalu parameivarah prakdiatma prakdidi ca vimariasvabhdvah [...] svayamprakaianipah parameivarah pdrameivaryd iaktya sivddidha- ranyantajagadatmana sphurati prakdiate ca, ‘The Supreme Lord who is luminous in and of himself (svayamprakdia) appears and shines forth thanks to Sakti, his consort, as the world, starting from Siva and ending in earth [— viz., the subtlest and the grossest forms of ex­istence]’. On the Heart in Saiva texts, see particularly Muller-Ortega 1997, Padoux PTLvp 65-66; 1992: 387, 417-419. The mantra SAUH — whose essence isAHAM, th eparamantra, ‘supreme m antra’ — is the phonic form of this pulsating Absolute. Symbolizing the pulsating Absolute, this mantra is also a means to attain that Absolute, through the mystical realization (bhavana) proper to the idktopaya. Cf. YR ad 43, which quotes PT 9-10, where the mantra SAUH is said to be the ‘Heart’ (hfdaya) ‘of the nature of Bhairava/supreme consciousness’ (bhairavatman).875Here is one of the symbolic justifications of the term ‘Trika’, the ‘Triad’: nara, Sakti and Siva stand respectively for the knowable ([vedya, or the ‘object to be known’), knowledge (vedana), and the knower (vedaka), again symbolically equated with the phonemes S, AU and H; see PTLvj 21-24: tad etad vedyavedanavedakaviirantitrayam ayam varnatrayasvarupam tat trayam, ‘Such is the nature of the three phonemes [S-AI/-H].

It also indicates how the symbolic meaning of the mantra is to be construed, constituent by constituent Kâ. 41-42 allude thus to S(dJ, the first phoneme of SAUH; kâ. 43 associates AU with S; kà. 44 deals then with AU specifically; kà. 45 alludes to H, which completes the mantra, whose enunciation reflects the movement whereby the world is internalized within consciousness; kà. 46 represents the enunciation of SAUH in the reverse movement of externalizing the world by the same consciousness.877Glossing hi of 41b with yasmdt, YR’s commentary emphasizes the logical link between kârikàs 40 and 41: ‘There is no penchant at all on the part of the supreme adept who has attained his goal to accomplish anything else* (40), ‘for’, by the power of bhâvanà, he sees phenomenal diversity as ‘a residue of pure Being’ (41).878As shown by the gloss, three of the four andas are referred to here.879*àpatita.880advaitabhàvana — note the usage here of the neuter (bhâvanà), in the verse and com­mentary, for metrical reasons, instead of the more common feminine form (on bhâvanà as meditative realization, see YR ad PS 52 and 68). Kàrikâ 41 deals with the meditative realization in which the ¿àktopâya culminates. The last sentence of the general avat. ad 41-46 amounts to a description of that experience: i n sum, he declares that the universe is made one through the procedure of synthesizing the natures of the three spheres’. It is YR’s commentary that develops the esoteric meaning of the kàrikâ. It will take up the question again while explaining kà. 43, revealing more explicitly that mystical realization is obtained through meditation on the mantra SAUH. Therefore, by implication, it appears that kàrikà 41 aims at giving a cryptically symbolic interpretation of S [ = sat, ‘pure Being’], the first phonem e of SAUH.

It is interesting to note that YR quotes here a text of a Krama background; see Intr., p. 21.882We translate jnana as ‘cognition/consciousness’ in the light of K$emaraja’s commentary on the parallel passage of the NT (also quoted in ¿SV III 30). jnanamaya, epithet of the Lord, is there glossed as cinmdtraparamdrthah, ‘whose ultimate meaning is that it is “nothing but cognition/consciousness.” ’^ C o n scio u sn ess appears externally as objective experience: of the jar, or the color blue, etc., and internally as subjective experience: of pleasure, pain, etc.884At issue is the thesis that phenomenal diversity is not ontologically different from pure Being.

Other conceptions of ultimate reality that am ount to taking as real what is but transitory (such as the Buddhist view of a continuum of instanta­neous cognitions) are therefore unreal from the viewpoint of the Absolute (see Appendix 14, p. 338, the discussion in its entirety).

Let us summarize: 1. idntam = fa; 2. what ‘follows that [sa]’ (tatah param) is sa; 3. sa, in S- A(/-H, represents brahman as sat, ‘Being’, ‘existing’ — which, as such, is also termed the ‘third brahman\\ as stated by PT 9, quoted further in YR’s commentary ad 43. In a passage dealing with phonemic emanation, TA III 167 defines the phoneme SA as ‘the undivided supreme brahman’ (tad eva brahma paramam avibhaktam). TAV ad loc., after quoting ChU III 14, 1: sarvam khalv idam brahma, has recourse to BhG XVII 23, which establishes the traditional nomenclature of brahman: aum tat sad id nirdeio brahmanas trividhah smptah/ (verse again quoted by TAV ad V 142-144, a passage which deals again with the mantra SAUH, from the point of view of the dnavopaya). Thus, sat is the third brahman (coming after om and tat in the enumeration). Therefore, SA [or S], the initial of sat, or the third brahmant is also symbolically designated as such.905amftabija, ‘ambrosial seed’, stands here for SA, and is not to be taken here in its strictly technical sense, namely, as the name given to the four cerebral vowels — /* // i — (see TA III 91-92a).

Same term (sadakhya) in IPK III 1, 2; IPV III 1, 2 (vol. II: 217-218) explains the word sadakhya from a nominal base sadakhya, of which the second element akhya is understood in the sense of prakhya, ‘appear­ance, manifestation', which gives the result: ‘the manifestation (prakhya) from this moment on of “sat\" (yatah prabhpti sad id prakhya)*. Such an explanation reinforces the connection with Sadaiiva of whose element *sada* is derived from the same root. It is possible that YR employs sadakhya here as sadasiva in order to bring out the element *sat* in the *sanmatra’ of the preceding commentary, this particular derivation given by AG having become a common place of the tradition. This explanation would also serve as a reply to those who understand the name sadakhya according to a more straightforward etymology as 'concerning him whose name contains the element sada (adj.)’, thus, by implication, sadadiva. According to IP W (vol. Ill: 264), sada in Sadasiva means that the nature of £iva (divata) persists, even if, at this level, objectivity (idanta) begins to appear (idantonmese *pi divatehi sadadabdena uktam). The experience of duddhabrahman takes place in the third tattva, that of Sadasiva. When the entire universe is experienced as sanmdtrat this experience is called the abode, or state, of Sadasiva.

Moreover, the PTV gives even more interpretations for each term of the ¿loka 9, including the sixteen interpretations given in reference to each of the sixteen phonemes, from a to h.

The translation reflects what we have taken to be the most direct and, indeed, logical, reading — which seeks to link the two key terms of verse 47, aham T and deva ‘god*, in such a way as to establish their identity.

As has been stated:If the existence of Siva [as consciousness] is all-pervasive, what purpose is there in terminal Egress (utkranti)? If the ultimate principle [— scil., ‘of reality*] is not all-pervasive, what pur­pose is there in terminal Egress?1032There are, as well, many other varieties of liberation of such sort, pos­tulated by other schools. Were they to be dilated upon here, they would bring with them the danger of an overly prolix text. Hence, they will not be dilated upon. [In summary, however, we may say that] in all such cases [viz., other types of liberation], because they are open to the im­purity of dualism (dvaitamala), the desire for liberation (moksalipsa) [has been redirected] to what is not liberation (amoksa), resulting in the mere appearance of liberation (moksabhasa) . 1033What then is the definition of liberation? The master says in reply: ... ‘[by cutting the knot of] ignorance, etc.*.Ignorance is that delusion generated by the nescience implicit in the conceit that locates the Self in the non-Self — the body, etc. — whose antecedent is the conceit that locates the non-Self in the Self.1034practice of utkranti any salutary virtue, AG tries to resolve the paradox represented by the fact that utkranti is nevertheless taught in the MVT, a text that is authoritative for the nondualistic doctrine of the Trika. The disapprobation here of “yogic suicide” is one with the view that becoming ¿iva does not require the destruction of a body that is in any case not different from Siva. Moreover, the idea that suicide is a means to liberation clashes with the notion of jivanmukti, the core teaching of the PS. Dissociating itself from older notions of liberation, involving a ‘going elsewhere’ at the moment of death, Trika adopts a view more in line with its doctrine of / akti — ‘Liberation is the manifestation of one’s own energies [realized] by cutting the knot of ignorance’, as says PS 60. At the same time, Trika thereby clarifies the sense in which jivanmukti itself is a necessary consequence of this “cutting”: at the very instant the yogin severs the knot of nescience, he accedes to liberation, once and for all. A similar refutation of utkranti is found in SpP 30, quoted in Intr., n. 151. Note also the generalized euphemistic sense of utkranti, ‘the flight or passage of the soul (out of the body), death’ (Apte, citing B S II3 ,1 9 ), of which this “yogic” application is little but a specialization.1032The reference has not been found, although the text is very close to the passage from the Urmikaula[arnava] (or Urmimahakula), quoted by TAV XIV 33b-35a (vol.

It is a compilation, in the form of embedded dialogues and narratives, belonging to ‘the liturgical literature of early Visnuism’ as stated by Griinen- dahl (Visnudharma: IX). Its date is uncertain: between the 3rd and 11th cent. Ad, as proposed by Griinendahl (pp. 72-73), which is corroborated by Ramanuja’s ¿drirakamimdmsdbhd$ya (11 th—12th cent.), which quotes the text, as well as by the present citation, from the same period. RamSnuja’s reference to the Visnudharma mitigates somewhat Griinendahl’s skep­ticism regarding the text’s ‘alleged authority among the £rivai$navas’ (Visnudharma, pt 3: 61-63).1041 The first stanza of the puzzling verse, cited verbatim by R&manuja, is so translated by Thibaut (¿ribhdsya, p t 3: 758), who takes the apparent hapax jalambara (‘water-garment’) as “rain w ater” — perhaps understanding the ‘sheet of w ater’ that makes an Indian downpour sometimes seem as substantial as a veil. Many variants occur, however, in the manuscripts (see note below), indicating that the image (whatever it was) was not universally grasped. Thibaut does not explain his translation further. Several other infelicities mar the Sanskrit of these lines, making the overall sense less than certain. In any case, if the citation is relevant to the present argument, YR probably understands the ‘expanse of w ater’ and the ‘well’ (that is, a ‘water-enclosure’) to function here much in the same way as he does the ‘expanse of space’ and the ‘ja r’ (that is, a ‘space-enclosure’) of the following illustration.

It is noteworthy that the first ¿loka appears to have been popular, for it is often quoted, as, for instance, in the Atmasiddhi and in Ramanuja’s £drirakamimdmsabhd$ya IV 4, 3, two texts that have the same reading of the verse (in NarasimhSdirya’s edition (1910) of the ¿drirakamimamsabhdsya, this verse is identified as Vi$nudharma 104, 56). In the light of the edition of the Visnudharma and the passage quoted by Ramanuja, it would seem that YR has altered the text, omit­ting the correlative phrase of the first ¿loka, and joining to it an anterior verse. The original text, as quoted in Narasimhacarya’s and Abhyankar’s editions of the ¿>drirakamimdmsdbhdfya, reads as follows: yatha na kriyate jyotsnd malapraksalanan maneh/ dosaprahanan na jnanam dtmanah kriyate tathd// yathodapanakarandt kriyate na jalambaram/ sad eva niyate vyaktim asatah sambhavah kutah// yatha [tathd, in Vasudev Shastri Abhyankar ed., Bombay Sanskrit and Prakrit Series, LXVIII, pt I, 1914] heyagunadhvamsad avabodhadayo gunah/ prakafyante na janyante nitya evdtmano hi te //t ‘As the luster of the gem is not created by the act of polishing, so the essential intelligence of the Self is not created by the putting off of im­perfections.

N. Pandit: ‘An individual finite I-consciousness, having a deep rooted conception of finitude with regard to itself, is lead (sic) by the impression of its future body, formed in accordance with its deeds, to the consequent position after the end of its current form’. These three interpretations appear to be based on a specifically Šaiva sense of bhàvanàt the spiritual realization preceding moksa itself — which in any case is not that far removed from the original MImarnsaka meaning. According to the MImàmsà, the act does not end with its material result (which may be nothing but the ashes of the sacrifice), but is prolonged, through its ‘efficient force’ up to the moment of its “real” fruition: the ful­filled wish of the performer. Even this “real” result depends on the ‘efficient force’ generated by the previous ritual a c t Those questioning this sacrificial model (cf. BÀU VI 2, 15-16; MuU I 2, 5-11) noted that since the previous (ritual) act is occasional, impermanent, its ‘ef­ficient force’ (needed to maintain the sacrificer ‘in heaven’, for example) cannot be thought itself to be perm anent, and must itself be destined to exhaustion in its turn, becoming then but another element in an endless series of impermanent causes and effects. Later on, YR will emphasize that this ‘efficient force’ is articulated through the vásanás produced in the mind by ritual acts; see n. 1060. Cf. BhG n 66, where Edgerton’s interpretation of bhâvanà, ‘efficient-force’, should no doubt be understood in a more spiritual sense; cf.

The projection, in the process ofTantrika meditation, of the thirty-six tattvas upon the body transforms it into a microcosm; it is therefore a ritual notion, present in the oldest Tantras. The body as shrine appears to be a notion proper to the Kula branch, wherein the lineages (kula) o fyoginls are viewed as (extensions of) the sense-organs. We might observe here that the body-shrine of the karika, along with its architectural details, is possibly a late metaphor, inasmuch as the older Tantras do not generally mention statues, nor temples for public worship; see, nevertheless, the fourth chapter of the Brahmayamala for references to images of wood or other substances used for worship. Hidden from the larger society bien-pensant, tantric rituals were originally celebrated in disused places, and were probably not housed in any perm anent structure — although there was a ‘sanctum*(yagagfha), a retinue of deities surrounding the site (bahyaparivara), and deities guarding its entrance; see Sanderson 1986: 173-174. Whenever AG speaks of daily external worship, its substratum is mainly a smooth mirror-like surface — for instance, a mirror or a sword- blade; it may also be ‘a linga (provided it is private, moveable, not of fashioned stone, nor of any metal but gold), a rosary (ak$osutram), a skull-cup (mahapatram), a skull-staff"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"KAR1KA 74253then] th e body of an o th er, o r even an object, such as a j a r . 1149For th a t knower of the Self, his own body or that of another [external to h im ],1,50 is the abode of the deity, for it is the substratum of everything that is to be enjoyed [viz., external objects] by the deity that is his own Self.However, external locales, such as [temples of the] Meru [type],1151 etc., become abodes of a deity, whenever they are so determined by a teacher through the adjunction (kalana) of the thirty-six principles, mak­ing them coextensive with a body.1152Once the [image of the] deity dwelling there, though external [to one’s own Self], is comprehended as formed of consciousness (cidghana) through being pervaded by one’s own Self, then even that [image] becomes the deity there.Otherwise, how could either one or the other [viz., the temple or the image], both inert, mere bits of rock, save [viz., free] (uddharet) devotees [from transmigratory experience], or conduct the dead into [the deity’s] proximity, etc.?1153Thus, the body itself is, in a direct sense,1154 the abode of the deity, for it is the dwelling place of consciousness.

Ad 950-1000; see Sander­son 2007: 411), the author of the SpV (and possibly of the Sarvatobhadra, a commentary on the BhG), is referred to in different sources. He presents himself, in the second conclusive stanza of his SpV, as the direct disciple of Utpaladeva (ca. 925-975; see Sanderson 2007: 352). Rajanaka Rama is to be distinguished from two Bhat(a Ramakantha: Ramakantha I, the author of a now lost Sadvjtti, who was the guru of Ramakantha IPs grandfather, and Ramakantha II (fl. ca. Ad 950-1000), the com mentator on the Kiranatantra (see Goodall, Kiranavftti: IX). In his SpV (p. 164), Rajanaka Ramakantha quotes a verse from a stotra that he says he composed himself; similarly, PHvj* 11 quotes a verse found in SpV, p. 135, ascrib­ing it to ¿rirama. Rajanaka Ramakantha may also be identified as the ‘¿rl RamabhattSraka’ referred to in Vamadeva’s Janmamaranavicara (p. 21). From such indices, it may be con­cluded that he was also a poet, author of devotional hymns. If he may be identified with the author of the Sarvatobhadra, a commentary on the BhG (see Goodall Kiranavftti: IX), he has also laid claim to some poetical skill, referring to himself (p. 404) as the ‘king of the poets’ (kavindra). ‘Rajanaka’ occurs frequently in titles of Kashmirian £aiva teachers; see, for instance, colophons of K$emaraja or Jayaratha, respectively to PH and TA. See Stein (ad Rajatarahgini [RT] VI 108) RT: 244 (n.. 117): ‘The title Rajanaka, meaning literally “almost a king”, used to be given for services rendered to the king. (...) The title has survived in the form of Razdan as a family name of very frequent occurrence among the Brahmans of Kaimlr’.

YRad 83: paramâdvayadfé.1177kalana has a specialized meaning in the Trika. Padoux translates: ‘dynamisme limita- teur’, ‘limiting dynamism’. Most traditional etymologies presume a link with fcd/a, ‘time’, which, according to Mayrhofer (s.v.) is illusory (he cites Lat. celer, Gk. keXXoü ‘impel’, which agrees nicely with the sense proposed here). Compare the term’s often attested (but also contested) medical meaning, ‘the “thrust” of the embryo in the womb’. The meaning should be something like ‘determ ine’, ‘compel to be precise’; it is the annihilation of that “thrust” toward determination, that “need” to distinguish, that “distinguishes” the mental oblation of the yogin. The notion of kalana would then be related to the ‘sheath’ (kancuka) termed here fcald, ‘tendency to act in respect of a determ inate agent’; cf. kalà vàyurûpâ kim- citkartftvena prerikà (PTLvf 5ff.). Finally, ‘determ ination’ appears to capture the different meanings implied by Padoux’s excellent ‘dynamisme lim itateur’.

Dyczkowski gives several arguments 1) Vâmanadatta, author of the SamvitprakdJa, presents himself as a Pàhcarâtrin, whereas the epithet ‘vira’ generally applies to éaivas; 2) the sacrifice there described is more of a £aiva than of a Vai$nava model; 3) the verse quoted by YR cannot be traced in the manuscripts of the Samvitprakafa (although it might be supposed that those MSS are incomplete, or that the verse is quoted from another work of the same Vâmanadatta).

And those recitations may be counted by means of the rosary1194 accompanied by the [practitioner’s] permeation with the energy of breath (pránašakti), by [the simple device of] sequencing the turning of its “beads” [i.e., turning them one after the other].However, for the yogin [experiencing] ultimate [or transcendent] non­duality, his own energy of breathing has become the thread [of the ros­a ry ],1195 reverberating (nadaná) with the flow [of respirations] in theposing that its moments are the ‘beads* of a rosary, of which breathing itself constitutes the thread. The madhyamaprána is that prána which rises without deviating through the su$umná canal, in the form of kundalini; as such, it is called udána, the ‘rising breath*. Ac­cording to K$emaraja ad SvT VII 10, the madhyamaprána is that prána which rises in the ‘middle* nádi: madhyanádyášrayamadhyamaprána*.

See also TÁ XXIX 236, where the term madhyamaprána appears in the context of the vedhadikfá (a dik$á made by piercing the different cakras by means of the madhyamaprána). On the five pránas, see Padoux 1992: 136, n. 140, and Olivelle BÁU: L-LI. On japa and its association with prána, see SvT II 140a: japah pránasamah káryah; also Padoux 1987, and TAK II, s.v. japa. U93bindu and náda are different levels of the articulation (uccára) of a mantra (see n. 1375). The commentary thus establishes that the káriká refers to mantric practice, and associates that practice with kundalini breathing techniques; see Padoux 1992: 83, according to whom phonic energy ‘gradually condenses, and passing through an initial “resonance** (ndda), be­comes a drop (bindu) of phonic energy, divides, and subsequently gives birth to the matrix of the phonemes (mátpká), then to the phonemes themselves (varna), and to words. This sound process is “that which expresses” (vácaka), and induces thereby the emergence of “that which is expressed” (vácya), namely, the world of objects (artha) or of the meanings that it expresses. The phonic energy is symbolized by the kundalini, in her twin aspect, hu­man and cosmic, connected with “breath” (prána)\\ Padoux (YH: 375) translates náda as ‘vibration phonique subtile’ [— ‘subtle phonic vibration*], or (1992): ‘phonic resonance*, ‘subtle sound*.U94ak$amálá.1195Note that the word tantu is often used to describe the middle šakti, which is compared to a fibre of the lotus stalk (mpnálatantu); see Kubjikámatatantra [KMT] XXIV 120-121, where the Goddess, in the form of šakti, the mother of the three worlds, situated in [the middle"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"264TRANSLATIONmiddle breath; emerging naturally, [this energy] is said to be an innate [kind of] rosary, as it comprehends all the senses.1196Since all this world is [composed of] objects to be expressed, [and] given that the universe consisting of thirty-six principles1197 is established in this very same energy of breath, the Goddess (bhagavaS), who is su­preme [awareness] (pardsvabhdva — viz., paravac as paraJaktQ, assumes the form of vital breath via the sequence of arousal and release [that fol­low] at each exhalation of [the yogin’s] breath.

In conformity with the two cardinal truths of the doctrine, 1) that everything is verbal (vacya), and 2) that the world is founded on breath (prdna), the Goddess assumes herself the form of breath (an hypostasis that the conception of breath as energy justifies), and becomes indissociable from the japa as such. Thus the Goddess is at once breath, japa, and the energy that utilises the yogin to execute the japa, to the extent that she inhabits and animates him in every limb. Thus is the yogin ‘enthusiasmed’, as it were, in the original sense of the word, that is, ‘possessed by the deity’.X]\"¿aivopanisad [ = VBh 156]. Reference is made here to the mantra 4HAM SAIf, that is, to the natural japa of a mantra that is the cycle of breathing itself, with its double move­ment of inspiration (ha) and exhalation (sa). The computation is effected thusly: if each cycle of inspiration and exhalation lasts for four seconds, there are fifteen cycles per minute, nine hundred per hour (15 x 60), and 21,600 per day (of 24 hours); the same computation is found in SvT VII 54-55a, and TA VII 47-52a (see Gnoli TA: 165). The practice of the hamsoccdra is associated with the worship of the kundalini, one of whose modalities is the madhyapranakundalini (see TA V 135-136; and TAK il, s.v.). This ¿loka (VBh 156) is quoted (with some alterations) in K$emaraja ad SvT VII 56, who attributes it to VBh; also in SSV III 27, but preceded by a verse that is absent of ¿ivopadhyaya’s commentary ad VBh: sakarena bahirydti hakdrena viiet punah/ hamsahamsety amum man tram jivo japati nityaiah//, ‘[Breath] exhales with the sound sa and inhales with the sound ha.

In effect, the upper portion, or “head”, of a bed’s leg, in the shape of a paral- lelepipede, is pierced with three holes, through which the cords are threaded that constitute the supports of the traditional Indian bed. The two upper holes, parallel to the floor and slightly apart, can be seen as the orbital cavities of a cranium, while the third, below and between them, resembles a mouth. The term khatvanga appears (in the guise of the adjec­tive khafvdngin) once only in the Mdnanavadharmalastra [MDhS] XI 105, doubtless in its literal sense ‘bed-post’; perhaps MDh£ XI 72 (kftvd iavaliro dhvajam, ‘having made the head of a corpse his em blem’) refers to our khatvanga, as an attribute of the ascetic (see, infra, Baudhayanadharmasutra [BADhS] I 1, 3); see also YajS III 243, which describes the mendi­cant ascetic ‘carrying a bowl which is a skull’ (iirahkapalin) ‘with his em blem’ (dhvajavant); cf. Apastambadharmasutra [= ApDhS] I 10, 29, 1, khatvangamdanddrthe [...], *[...] taking a khatvanga as his walking stick’; the com mentator H aradatta (14th-15th cent.) mentions the two interpretations of the term: either khatvanga is a ‘part of a bed’ or ‘it is to be taken in the sense well known in the Tantra of the Kapalikas’ (khafvaya angam khatvangam [...] kapdlikatantraprasiddhasya khatvdngasya va grahanam); also: Gautamadharmasutra III 4, 4, 4, where the penitent is described as having two attributes: the khafvanga and the begging-bowl made of a skull (khatvdngakapalapanir), and BADhS I 1, 3: kapali kha^vang [...] dhvajam iavaiirah kjtva, ‘carrying a skull and a khatvanga, [...] having made the head of a corpse his em blem’. Iconographically, the khatvanga is sometimes a stick surmounted by a skull (or by many skulls, as in Buddhist representations), sometimes a kind of stick or mace whose superior portion is sculpted in the form of a skull (see Illustration).1202On kapdla, see MDh£ VIII93 (kapalena ca bhik$arthi where the term signifies simply ‘begging-bowl’, as it does in vedic texts (see, for instance, ApDhS II 9, 23-10, BADhS II 10, 17, 23 — in the context of the agnihotra); cf.

That is, he understands [his aware­ness] to be situated in the midst [of a cremation ground], made extremely frightful in virtue of the fact that whatever has come into being is subject to destruction.1210He who takes a [mundane] vow (vratin) dwells, does he not, in a cre­mation ground; but he who lives by an other-worldly (alaukika) vow takes up residence in this world of transmigration — itself [a veritable] crema­tion ground made frightening by the fact that all cognizers and objects1205Cf.

The proposition is false as it stands, for the phenomenon of “smokeless” fire is well-attested. To correct the proposition, it suf­fices to add the upadhi ‘provided that the fuel is moist’. Properly speaking, the upadhi in this sense belongs to the argument, not to the object, but because anything that serves to differentiate one entity from another may be considered an upadhi (as the branch that serves to distinguish one bird from another), the upadhi is often more or less loosely attached to the object, as in the present case. The upadhit or ‘contingent qualification’, concerns then any circumstantial condition that cannot be said to belong to the object in terms of its very being, such as the weight of the lead, etc. The yogin’s consciousness is devoid of such contingencies (that is, is deficient in upadhi) — nothing limits it, nothing circumscribes it.1279While referring to the lapidary phrasing of the karika, YR reformulates the line in more normal syntax."},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"284TRANSLATIONthe adjunction of any number of other contingencies [such as dust, etc.], so likewise, consciousness, though freed from the contingency of the body, will still be impure, if it should receive, like the gem, another contingent qualification, inasmuch as it is affected by that contingency.The master anticipates this objection by saying: ‘[consciousness is] freed as well from all o th er contingencies’.The parallelism 1280 between the example and that which has been ex­emplified by it is not complete in all respects.1281 After the falling away of the [yogin's] body — his only shape now the great Light formed of ul­timate nonduality — all this [universe] becomes [for the yogin] his own body, as it were (svângakalpa) — [which] had been thought to be a mere contingency.And, further, he [the yogin] cannot be qualified by any other con­tingency, for there is no contingency whatever standing apart from this [plenitude].1282Thus, there is no [absolute] parallelism between [consciousness and] the gem as to the manner in which they accept contingent qualification. The acceptance of the contingency of a body is rooted, is it not, in ig­norance, but once that ignorance has been cut off by the axe of Self- knowledge,1283 how can there again be contact with any [further] contingency?As it is said in the revered Gîtâ:Knowledge is obscured by ignorance;/ By that creatures are de­lu d ed .// But if by knowledge that ignorance/ Of men's souls is destroyed,/ Their knowledge like the sun/ Illumines that High­est. 1284Therefore, the yogin's own consciousness is ever pure, and pure only, for he knows his own true nature [as being the Self of all things].1285X2BOsamycL1281 The universe becomes the permanent body of the yogin now freed from his transitory body.

So much is the difference [between gnat and God].Thus the corporeal properties of the knower and of him who is not a knower (ajñánin) are perforce similar; but not for all that, is there any similarity of consequence.Such a truth has been stated in the revered Gita:One acts in conformity with his ow n/ Material nature, 1352 —even the wise m a n ;/1353 Beings follow (their own) nature;/What will restraint accomplish?13541351The episode is narrated in MBh XVI 5, 19-20.1352Such is the explanation of Sankara: prakftir náma pürvakftadharmádharmádisamskáráh vartamánajanmádau abhivyaktáh sá prakftih [according to the text published in the POS, p. 59], 4prakfti means the modifications [or perfectionings] (samskára), such as piety and impiety, etc., acquired during past [lives] that become manifest in this present life'.1353The explanation of Sankara is as follows: jñánaván api kim punar múrkhah, 4Even a wise man [so acts] — what indeed will a fool [do]?’1354BhG III 33. Commenting nigrahah kim karifyati, 4What will restraint do here?’, ¿añkara adds, putting these words in the mouth of Kf$na, mama vá anyasya, ‘[What will restraint do here] from Me or anyone else?’ The impressions of merit and demerit shape the nature (prakfti) of every being, therefore they are also prakfti, and the individual self behaves in keeping with this. It is common to both, jñánin and ajñánin, even if the result is not the same: the jñánin is able to move against prakfti and, determining his own course, to attain liberation, whereas the non Jñánin falls prey to his own prakfti determined by his own samskáras. The quotation from the Gita substantiates the first part of the statement: when there is a body, the logic of the body will be there, w hether it is the body of the jñánin, or of the one who is not a jñánin; this body will have to undergo all its attributes, or conditions, and no intervention, from any side, will be able to do anything. As far as the body is concerned, no control is possible: one cannot make one’s body eternal. However, the situation is a different thing when it comes to consciousness, the perennial substratum of the transitory body. Trying to overcome both hatred and attachm ent, i.e., all kinds of samskáras, the jñánin is able to restrain, to control himself (it is the nigraha referred to in BhG), thus to transgress prakfti — if not in the realm of differentiation, at least at the level of unity, when he strives for it — and to attain liberation. GAS ad III 33 explains this verse in a very clear way: yo *pi ca jñáni na tasya vyavaháre bhojanádau viparyásah kaácit/ api tu so *pi sattvádyucitam eva ce$¡ate evam eva jánan/ ato bhütánám pfthivyádinám prakftau vilayah átmá cákartá nityamukta id kasya janmádinigrahah, ‘He also who is a knower of the Self will be in no way averse to such worldly activities as eating, etc. Rather he acts properly in accordance with the sattva, etc., (that predominates in him) and he knows that “after this the elements such as earth, e tc , will dissolve in prakfti, but the átman, which is a non-agent [a ‘non-actor’, as translated by Sharma] (akartf), is eternally free”.

Those usages that tend toward ‘elegantly, gracefully’, etc., seem to be either contextual interpretations or late acceptations.

In the present context, mercury, which is celebrated at length as a means to acquire an enduring body, is also seen as a means of attaining the highest goal, liberation; see Sarvadcuianasaijigraha IX, where, at the outset, it is explained that ‘mercury is called pdrada, because it is a means of conveyance beyond the series of transmigratory states’, and the citation, there, of the Rasasiddhanta: ‘One not living cannot know the knowable, and therefore there is and must be life*.

The 'bulb*, kanda (or medhrakanda), also named guhyasthana, the ‘secret place*, is the opening of the muladhdra (the ‘radical support*, the lowest of the cakras, at the base of the spine, in the area of the genitals, where the different nadls, or canals of vital energy, join). In fact, represented as a triangle in tantric accounts, the muladhdra may be turned downwards (then called adhovaktra, the ‘downwards opening’), or upwards, and called kanda. Located at the root of the sexual organ [Avalon says ‘between the genitals and the anus’] (i.e., five fingers below the navel, and two fingers above the membrum virile), near the anus, it allows the virile power to pass into the central channel; at that point, it is called trikona, the ‘triangular sanctuary*, inasmuch as it is made of the three divine iaktis: iccha,jhana and kriya. See Silbum 1983: 43.1374Rather, lampikd (or lambikd, li t, ‘which hangs down’) is the uvula, the flexible extremity of the soft palate. It is also called talu, or catuhpada, for it is seen as the intersection of four ways, and, as such, symbolized by a lotus with four petals where the two ways of the ordi­nary external breath (one descending in the lungs, the other going up through the trachea) cross the two ways specific to the interiorized breath of the kundalini (one descending to the muladhdra, the other going up to the brahmarandhra). Described as located below the brahmarandhra, and turned toward the bhrumadhya, the lampikd, as is the case with the lalafa (in the middle of the forehead) or the triveni (also situated at the level of the bhrumadhya), is not a cakra. Rather it is a place where air gathers in such a way that breath changes its nature, and, becoming tenuous, is a source of peace and bliss.

Then the dissolution of this sonorous vibration goes on, within iakti itself, with three more stages which are not referred to here, by YR, viz., vyapini, the ‘Pervading*, samand, the ‘Conscious*, and unmana, the ‘Transmental level*. On this entire process, see Padoux PTLvp 83ff., and Sanderson 1986: 178-180 (from whom we borrow the translation of vyapini, samand and unmana).1376Thus, according to the commentary, kundaliniyoga seems to be referred to in the k5rik§ (see also the a v a t which speaks of yogakramd). Unless (though less probably) one is to understand that AG meant another ascent: perhaps from an inferior practice, such as the visualization of deities, to the superior one of the PT, as AG understood it, meditation on sounds, etc. (see PT: 265-266, where occurs the desiderative noun aruruksuh, ‘the one who desires to ascend’). This process of the ascending kundalini is indissociable from the yogin’s ascent through successive levels of phonic energy, experienced in the articulation of a mantra (probably the parabija SAUH, as may be inferred from the similar passage of TA V 54b-62a); such is suggested by the reference to bindut nada and iakti. This ascent also coincides with the process of the reabsorption of the differentiated into pure consciousness (itself correlating with the cosmic reabsorption of the entire phenomenal manifestation). What is hinted at, here, is a complex and most elaborate practice involving the differentiated stages, up to the ndbhiy of the anavopaya, the ‘means, or way, of the finite soul*, and the idktopaya, the ‘means, or way, of energy*, referring to the ascent of the subtle energy through five stages (hfd, kantha, tdlUy bhrumadhya and lalafa) before reaching the supreme phases that start from nada (see Silbum VBh: 82). As stated above, PS 97 may be compared to TA V 56b-57a, not only because both passages use the term sopana, but also because they appear to describe the same process. By enum erating bindu, nada and iakti, YR*s commentary seems to echo TA V 56b-57a, where the kundalini, explicitly mentioned, is seen as ‘blossoming into a garland (malika) [of subtle energies] going, through successive stages, from bindu, in the middle of the eye-brows, to nadanta and iaktC.

The meaning is that those who have approached [or mastered] the principle of pure conscious­ness (samvittattva) [the 36th] have transformed everything into their own self [have “eaten” everything]; such is the meaning.

The words might also refer to a notion of liberation comparable to that of RSmanuja, who considers mukti to be a devotee’s residence without end in the proximity of the Lord — a notion more in conformity with the requirements of bhakti — where the idea of an ‘identification’ with the Lord is seen rather as arrogance or lise-majesti.

Such an interpretation, where ‘residence’ occupies the place of ‘liberation’, might hold in the case of the first PS, strongly colored by Vaisnava devotionalism (though even this interpretation is debatable), but it cannot be held in the context of the second PS, strongly nondualist. The substitu­tion, by the second PS, of yasmad avartate na punah for yat tat paramam padam visnoh of the first (APS 86) is well conceived for dispelling the ambiguity introduced by divyam amp- tam. YR’s commentary, as well as the organization of the textual ensemble of ka. 97-102, leaves little room for doubt as to the interpretation of what is intended by these words. This ‘divine immortality from which one does not return’ is a periphrasis, unusual indeed, for ‘liberation’. We have seen that ka. 100-102 evoke a type of inferior ascetic ‘fallen from discipline’ (yogabhrasta), whose practice is entirely unsatifactory. To him, whose aspiration to achieve liberation in this life has failed, is ascribed delightful (and lengthier) residence in ‘divine worlds’ (ka. 100-101); he is then reborn, takes up the practice of yoga where he had left it, and is ‘freed’ at the end of his second life, without however experiencing jivan- mukti (ka. 102). Similarly, YR observes that ‘divine im mortality’ (divyam amrtam), is ‘of the nature of the supreme principle’, and concludes by citing the Gita (VI 45): ‘perfected thru many rebirths,/ [he] Then (finally) goes to the highest goal’. Thus ka. 103 may fairly end by assuring the devotee that he will reach the ‘condition of £iva’ (iivatva), that is, ‘libera­tion*, designated in the commentary of YR ad loc. by terms such as prakr$tamukti, ireyas, paraireyas, and paramapurusartha. As well, it is noteworthy that ka. 103 summarizes ka. 97-102. Cf. BAU IV 4, 7 (quoted n. 1062), where the adjective ‘im mortal’ (ampta) has been interpreted by Sankara as designating a state of jivanmukti. Cf. also BAU IV 4, 8, under­stood by Radhakrishnan in the light of £ ad loc.: tena dhlra apiyanti brahmavidah svargam lokam ita urdhvam vimuktah/ / , ‘By it, the wise, the knowers of Brahman go up to the heav­enly world after the fall of this body [&: itah: asmac charirapatat], being freed (even while living) [£: jivanta eva vimuktah santah]\\ and Sankara’s exegesis of svargam lokam: apiyanti apigacchanti brahmavidyaphalam moksam svargam lokam/ svargalokatabdah trivistapavacyapi son iha prakarandt mokfdbhidhayakah/ itah asmac chanrapatat urdhvam jivanta eva vimuktah santah/, *[...] they go to the heavenly sphere, or liberation, which is the result of the knowledge of Brahman — ‘Heavenly sphere’ generally means heaven, the abode of gods, but here from the context it means liberation — after the fall of this body, being freed even while living’ (tr.

The gloss dviiya indicates this as well, and the fact that YR does not take âveéam as the direct object of the verb. He also prefaces his gloss of nijahpdayàvedam with the adverb katham, implying a circumstantial function of the compound. The namul is generally employed, as Renou observes, in order to emphasize ‘la rapidité du procès’ — which suits very well here the sense of the kàrikà: aciràd eva [...]. We differ therefore from other translators, who apparently understand àveéam as an accusative; cf. Barnett: ‘The being of ¿iva speedily comes to penetrate the very heart of him who meditates [...]’; Silbum: ‘Lorsqu’il médite [...], avant peu la nature de éiva pénétrera dans son propre cœ ur’; B. N.

The ‘kjtvâ’ that follows in the commentary the pratikà (nijahfdayâvedam) is a gloss intended to flag the odd gerund; it functions thus as a parenthesis, to note that a noun is not at issue, that is, as a grammatical notation of the usage itself.1433That is, his core consciousness.

The participle dhyayatah is best understood as a genitivus commodi, which implies the ellipsis of the object, for, according to YR, ¿ivatvam (as subject) ‘comes to’ him who meditates (requiring an accusative in Sanskrit); such ¿ivatvam is not ‘his’ (genitive); sec Renou 1968: §222IL This is probably why the object of abhyeti is not mentioned — being clearly, by a sort of uha, understood as the underlying subject of the participle. The construction ¿ivatvam ... abhyeti invites normally the reverse parsing: ‘goes to Sivahood’ (see previous ka.: ... eti sa Iivatvam). Abhinavagupta may have changed this on purpose, for two reasons. First, to show that Sivahood is produced by itself, and that the meditating subject does not need to act any further. Second, the structure of the whole sentence may avoid the subject/object relation deliberately, to express in grammatical terms that such dichotomy cannot characterize the relation of one’s self and Sivahood. The Self is Siva, and, accordingly, the sentence has only a subject, without any object.1434The translation reflects one of the several possible constructions of this first line of the commentary — one that goes somewhat against expectations, prathamanam is not taken as the incipit of a gloss of idam (which would then refer at least indirectly to ‘this’ world, brahman in its ‘extended’ form), but is simply an unglossed quotation of the idam of the karik5, pointing to brahman itself.

Rudra (YR ad 1)In rudraksetrajna, Rudra, or, rather, the Rudras, emblematically repre­sent the category of the adhipatis, presiding deities of the ‘spheres’ (.anda) constituting the universe, which are at the same time levels of subjectiv­ity and experience; on Rudras, see TAV VIII 306 (so ’vyaktam adhisthdya prakaroti jagan niyogatah iambhoh/ ¿uddhasuddhasroto ’dhikarahetuh £ivo yasmat //) : tacchakdti tacchabdendnantaparamanah / anena ca na kevala- mayam ksetrajnanam eva sthitim vidhatteyavad rudrdndm api — ity uktam //, and MVT V 12. Thus Rudra is ‘the one who presides over the condition of pure [limited] subjectivity represented by the Void or by an extremely subtle body formed by the puryastaka — in other words, over the condition in which there is a reabsorption of every other cognizable reality’ (iPvy III 2 ,1 , tr. Torella IPK: 197). The deity presiding over a given level of subjec­tivity and experience brings his devotees to this plane. Therefore, Rudra is also the model for such a subject: he who is able to reabsorb within himself all cognizable reality, he is Pralayakala seen in his divine dimen­sion (on Pralayakala, see YR ad 14 and 23, n. 625, and Appendix 10, p. 330). Responsible for the withdrawal from phenomenal world, Rudra is thus ontologically higher than Brahma and Visnu, ‘who preside over the manifestation of differentiated cognizable reality, the former causing creation and the latter continuity’ (IPvy III 2, 1, tr. Torella: 197). In the hierarchy of the cognizers, the line is clearly drawn between Rudra (or the Rudras) and the ksetrajnas. Rudra(s) as well as Brahma, Visnu, etc., belong to the category of the Lords (pad), for, as stated by IPK III 2, 3, ‘they see things (bhdva) [i.e., the universe (viiva)] as their own body (svangarupa) [i.e., as their own Self]’. Thus, they transcend the ordinary dichotomy of subject and object, as do yogins; cf. SSV114, which comments on dr£yam £anram, ‘[The yogin’s] body is the perceptible’, in almost the same terms: yadyad drsyam [...] tat tat sarvam [...] svangakalpam asya sphurati na bhe- dena, ‘Whatever is perceptible, all that [...] appears to him [...] as his own body [i.e., as his own Self], and not as different from him’. Therefore, the Lords are endowed with ‘sovereignty’ (aiivarya); see IPvy III 2, 3. As such,317"},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"318APPENDIXLords (pati) rule over their subjects, who thus deserve to be called ‘catde’ (pašu, viz., ‘fettered souls’, according to the traditional etymology — TÁV IX 144b-145a): pášyatvát pašur ity ucyate, ‘He is called pašu for he has to be fettered’ (see also YR ad 5) — for not only do they abide by the law of their Lord, but also by the law of difference. The concluding verse of TS IV, p. 32 (quoted by YR ad 33), shows that the pašu is a potential pati and vice versa. It is the supreme pati, Paramešvara, who opts for servitude, in the free movement of his play. Taking their bodies — as the locus of all worldly experience — to be the Self (or the cognizing subject), instead of consciousness, they are also called ksetrajňa or ksetravid, lit., ‘knower of the field [viz., of the body in which pure consciousness finds a substratum]’. The notion is defined by BhG XIII 1-2: idam šariram kaunteya ksetram a- bhidhiyate/ etad yo vetti tam prahuh ksetrajňa iti tadvidah// ksetrajňam cápi mám viddhi sarvaksetresu bhárata/ ksetraksetrajňayor jňánam yat taj jňánam matam m am a//, ‘This body, son of KuntI,/ Is called the Field./ Who knows this, he is called/ Field-knower by those who know him ./ Know also that I am the Field-knower/ In all Fields, son of Bharata./ Knowledge of the Field and Field-knower,/ This I hold to be (true) knowledge’. AG comments on these two verses, adding a third verse found only in some versions of the Kashmiri recension of the BhG (see Schrader 1930). For the detailed and most intricate demonstration, see Sharma’s translation of the entire pas­sage (GAS: 182-183). We quote here only AG’s development of the ksetra m etaphor samsárinám šariram ksetram yatra karmabijaprarohah, ‘For those involved in the process of santsára, the body is the field (ksetra), wherein the seed of karman sprouts’ (tr. Sharma). See a similar explanation in TÁV IX 144b-145a: karmabljaprarohdvaham ksetram šariram evátmatvena jánánah, ‘He who takes the body, i.e., the field bringing about the sprout­ing of the seed of karman, to be the Self [is called ksetrajňa or ksetravid]’. As such, the ksetrajňa belongs to the category of the anu, the finite soul, thus defined by TÁ IX 144b-145a: anavo náma naiványat prakášátmá ma- hešvarah// cidacidrúpatábhási pudgalah ksetravit pašuh/, ‘The finite souls, indeed, are not different from the supreme Lord who is of the nature of Light. When he manifests his conscious as well as unconscious state, he is [known as] pudgala, ksetravit or pašu’.

Ramakantha quotes (and comments on) it in order to establish the essential meaning of the BhG, which he formulates (p. 3) as: atmaivedam sarvam, ‘This entire [world] is the Self, thus agreeing with the upanisadic statement: idam sarvam yad ayam atma (BAU II 4, 6 [= IV 5, 7]). He emphasizes the interplay of the two pronouns, yat and sarva, showing how the Lord, rep­resented by yat, is described in terms of the [Lord’s] relation to the uni­verse (sarva): tasmai yac chabdapancakavisistavtfesanapratipadyasvarupaya sarvatmane namah, ‘Salutation to him, who is of the nature of the All [viz., the universe], and whose essence is to be expounded in terms of qualifi­cations determined by the pentad of the word yat [i.e., in terms of five relative clauses declining the different modalities that presuppose a com­monality of essence between the Lord and the world]’. YV VI 36, 18 also quotes the verse in the chapter entitled Paramesvaravarnana. In turn, AG quotes it, segment after segment, as a part of his argument, while com­menting on PT 4 (see PTV: 27-32, S kt text). It is noteworthy that, in the same passage, AG also cites SpK I 2: yatra sthitam idam sarvam karyam yasmac ca nirgatam/ tasydnavrtarupatvan na nirodho fsti kutracit, which es­tablishes the transcendence of the Lord ‘in whom all this world (sarva) rests and from whom it has come forth [as an ‘effect’, karya]\\ SpN I 2 first develops the logic of the inherent presence of the effect in the cause; cf. SpP ad loc., p. 13 of Dyczkowski ed. (1898 ed. omits it): satkaryatvat It establishes that the world (sarva) as an ‘effect’ (karya), i.e., a product, is produced by the action of an agent, not by any insentient cause, for the word karya, as a gerundive (kftya), presupposes the activity of a sen­tient agent: karyapadena cedam eva dhvanitam kartuh kriyaya nispadyam hi karyam ucyate na tu jadakdrananantarabhavi, ‘The word karya, “effect”, suggests only this much: that is said to be an “effect” which is to be ac­complished by the action of an agent, and not that which is consequential to an insentient cause’. On this point, £aivites differ from Buddhists, for whom the inevitable priority and posteriority of cause and effect demon­strate, not the logical priority of the agent, but a mere temporal succes­sion. Then, in the same passage, he demonstrates that the Lord, being all, does not require anything additional in order to create the ‘All’ (sarva) — that is, any material cause, viewed as different from the agent — as does the potter, who needs clay: sarvasabdenopaddnddinairapeksyam kar- tur dhvanitam, ‘The word [viz., the pronoun] sarva, “all”, suggests that the agent is independent of any material cause, etc.’.

(p. 33), ‘innate’ (sahaja), insofar as it is ‘not dependent on any material cause or other auxiliary cause [in achieving its object]’ (na tupaddnasahakdryddikdrandntarapeksini). Similar reflections on sarva are found in BhG X 8, which SpV IV 21 (= ad III 19) quotes (along with BhG X 9-11) in the Kashmiri recension, in support of the karika celebrating the advent of the supreme Subject (bhoktr) as the Lord of the Wheel (cakrei- vara): ayam sarvasya prabhava itah sarvam pravartate// [for aham sarvasya prabhavo mattah sarvam pravartate//]/ id maty a bhajante mam budha bha- vasamanvitah//, ‘ “This is the source of all and all things evolve out of this”.

It seems that the first occurrences of the concept (also in the form of its synonym: camatkrti) are to be found in Anandavardhana’s vrtti ad DhAl IV 16, quoted below (the only occurrence of camatkrti in DhAl), and in Utpaladeva: IPvj I 5, 11; SDvr I 8, where camatkaray defined as svarupa- paramarsarupahy ‘awareness of one’s own essence*, glosses dmoda of the karika; and SSA XIII 41 (camatkrti). The usual explanation of the term ’s etymology takes camat9 as an exclamation of wonder, probably an ono­matopoeia. According to V. Raghavan (1942: 269), ‘[...] originally the word camatkara was an onomatopoeic word referring to the clicking sound we make with our tongue when we taste something snappy, and in the course of its semantic enlargements, camatkara came to mean a sudden fillip relating to any feeling of a pleasurable type’. However, on the basis of ABh ad VI 31, vol. I: 278, and at the cost of correcting the manuscript — camatah karanamy instead of ca manahkaranam — Gnoli (1968: 59-60) has proposed taking camat as the present participle of the root cam, ‘to sip’; camatkara then would be the ‘action of one who tastes’. Such an"},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"321etymology appears doubtful: not only the -kara here is much more likely the same -kara we have in omkara, etc., but the reading ca manahkaranam makes perfect sense (see, below, the complete text). Various characteriza­tions of camatkara have been given. See, for instance, very probably the first description of the experience, that of the vrtti ad DhAl IV 16: sphu- raneyam kacid iti sahrdayanam camatkrtir utpadyate, ‘ “Here some extraor­dinary [meaning] flashes forth” — such is the wonderment that arises in sensitive readers’. Cf. YR ad 75, who develops the notion in the context of speculations proper to PS. It is noteworthy that two texts of AG, the ABh and the IP W , one from the sphere of aesthetics, one from Pratyabhijna, give almost the same definition of the term; compare ABh ad VI 31, vol. I: 278: bhunjanasyddbhutabhogaspandavistasya ca manahkaranam camatkara iti, T h e word camatkara, indeed, properly means the mental activity of the enjoying subject (bhunjdna) who is immersed in the vibration of a marvelous enjoyment (bhoga)’, and IP W I 5, 11 (vol. II: 177): camatkrtir hi bhunjanasya yd kriya bhogasamapattimaya anandah, lcamatkrti means the action of an enjoying subject (bhunjdna), that is the bliss (ananda) consist­ing in the perfect realization of enjoyment (bhogasamapatti)\\ Later on, IP W I 5, 11 (vol. II: 179) enumerates a few glosses for paramarsay among which is camatkara: [...] rasanaikaghanataya paramarsah paramanando nirvptii camatkara ucyatey ‘Since it is indistinguishable from rasa [lit., ‘be­ing of one mass with rasa’], reflective awareness is called “supreme bliss” (paramananda), “serenity” (nirvra), “wonderment” (camatkara)*. The im­mediately preceding passage of the ABh ad VI 31, vol. I: 278 deserves to be quoted. Defining camatkara as ‘the form of consciousness that is de­void of obstacles’ (sa /*..J avighna samvit)y it adds: tajjo ’pi kampapulakol- lukasanadir vikarad camatkarah/ yatha “ajja vi hart camakkai kaha kaha vi na mamdarena daliaim/ camdakaldkamdalasacchahaim lacchum am gaim y/ tatha hi sa trptivyatirekenacchinno bhogavesa ity ucyate, ‘The changes pro­ceeding from it, namely, trembling, horripilation, joyful movements of the limbs, etc., are also called camatkara. For instance: “Hari is still in a state of wonder: How, o how is it that the limbs of LaksmI, which are as beau­tiful as fragments of the moon, have not been broken by Mount Mandara [churning the ocean]?” Indeed, this [camatkara may be] likewise [defined as] immersion in an enjoyment that can never achieve satiation and is thus uninterrupted’ (tr. Gnoli 1968: 59, modified). Note that such a statement would justify the reading ca manahkaranam, since it contrasts the mental aspect of camatkara (referred to as ‘mental activity’ or ‘consciousness free from obstacles’) with its physical effects (trembling, horripilation, etc.).

See also Utpaladeva’s ŠDvf III 18-20: 107 (pratika of the second hemistich: šaktayas tu jagat krtsnam; see below), Ksemaraja’s SSV III 8, III 30 (půda c) as well as Varadaraja’s ŠSvá III 30 (second hemistich), Abhinavagupta’s PTV 1, on khecarísamatům vrajet (second hemistich, in Singh, p. 13), as well as TÁVI 112 (vol.

The Sarvamaňgalů is given as the source of the quotation by YR as well as by the authors of SSV III 8 and TÁ V 40; the latter quotes the entire second hemistich and attributes it to the ‘Atfcm- galašůstra’ expounded by Šrikantha. As observed by Torella (ÍPK: XXX, n. 43), the Maňgalů ‘is included in the list of Bhairavatantra given by the Šnkanthísamhitď. According to Padoux (TÁ: 270), the Sarvamaňgalůšůs- tra, known only through this quotation, could be a hymn in praise of Siva, whose names include Šrikantha. Citing the full verse, the SpV (ad 1, p. 9) refers to the Půramešvara[šůstra]; this does not however permit us to con­clude that the same work is referred to under a different title; it should be noted that SpV (p. 9), quoted above, attributes the statement to Šiva him­self, by referring to the text it quotes as půramešvara, and that TÁV IX 154 uses the term udghosyate, ‘is proclaimed’ (yad abhiprůyenaiva šaktayo ’sya jagat krtsnam ityůdyudghosyate). Other texts make allusions to its source as ůmnůya, ‘Tradition’ (in SSV III 30), Agama (in SpN: 7, SpS: 14-15, and Varadaraja’s ŠSvá III 30), and rahasyašůstra, ‘esoteric Scripture’ (in SpP: 12).

Empowered in this way, Siva exerts himself to create objects of his own free will.

The source of such Trika notions might be MVTII 2a, quoted by TAV I 196: iaktimacchaktibhedena dharatattvam vibhidyate/, ‘The tattva ‘earth* divides into energy and possessor of energy [or energies]*.5. andas, tattvas, adhvans, bhuvanas (YR ad 4)Quoted in TAV XI 8, MVT II 49 enumerates the four andas: parthivam prakrtam caiva mayiyam iaktyam eva ca / id samksepatah proktam etad andacatustayam//. The word anda, lit, ‘egg* or ‘envelope’, connotes a form which is both impenetrable and constrictive. Underlined by TA VIII 169-170 and XI 12b-14a, constriction is a main feature of the andas, in terms of which the infinite is reduced to the finite. Thus Paramasiva be­comes a paiu, rather all the varieties of pasus. Defined in YR ad 4 (by citing TA VIII 169) as an ‘aggregate of entities’, i.e., as an aggregate of bodies, faculties and worlds, and clearly described in YR’s commentary as four sheaths fitted within one another, these andas are not only to be seen as cosmic spheres. They are also metaphors for the different grades of experience, whether this experience takes place at the level of pure man­ifestation, or pure subjectivity, which is that of iaktyanda, or at the level of phenomenal manifestation and embodied subjectivity which mdydnda, prakrtyanda and ppthvyanda account for. Everything starts with saktyanda, lit., the ‘sphere of Energy*. In fact, iakti, the very power of the Lord, once transformed by him, out of his absolute freedom, into the power of negat­ing his own essential nature, which is plenitude, gives rise to the other three levels of experience which are, as saktyanda itself, as many levels of bondage.Why is this theory of the andas set forth at the very outset of the exposi­tion? It is because the entire text, considering the main problem of empiri­cal being to be that of delimitation, aims at explaining how diversity takes place so as to enable the reversal of the process and the recognition and re- experience of one’s own fundamental plenitude. This reversal of process takes place through adhvafuddhi, the ‘purification of the paths’. In karikas"},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"324APPENDIX14-22, the PS enumerates in decreasing order Paramasiva’s “manifesta­tions”, the thirty-six principles that the methodical analysis of perceptual diversity reveals. Nevertheless, before broadening the analysis of the con­stituents of external and internal reality meant to explain Creation itself, the treatise endeavors to apprehend the manifestation of sensible experi­ence in its totality, in its seemingly paradoxical relation to the deity, the unique entity, the supreme reality, which is defined by its essential free­dom. Thus, it is an essentially philosophical effort that produces the theory of the four andas, or concentric ‘envelopes’, through which the exposition seeks to account for the organization of the Creation — thus giving rise to the concept of the cosmic ‘sphere’ — as well as to account for the degrees of experience understood as degrees of finitude and bondage, which are to be overcome in order to regain one’s essential plenitude. This is the reason why saktyanda, the first of the four andasf is composed of the three inferior tattvas of the ‘pure path’ (suddhadhvan), starting with Sadäsiva, where first emerges ‘this’ as an ideal potentiality. Yet it is a finitude and a bondage altogether relative, for what is at stake, at this level of nond­uality, is the pure manifestation that has not yet materialized itself into actual creation. As Michel Hulin states: Siva follows the pure path ‘pour faire, si l’on ose dire, le tour de sa nature’ [— ‘... so as to, so to speak, take an overall view of his own nature*] (1978: 305). The position of the suddhadhvan is, for the nondual Saivism of Kashmir, a way of showing that consciousness ‘does call for cosmic manifestation’ and that ‘far from being defilement and degradation, its relationship to multiplicity is enjoyment, because it expresses its inmost possibility’ (Hulin 1978: 286). This is why YR states, in his avat. ad 4, that ‘this universe is nothing but the blossom­ing of the Lord’s energies’, and later on, that ‘the universe is in essence nothing but the marvel of supreme ipseity’. BÄU I 4, 1-3 describes of the Primordial Androgyne as one who ‘evokes in imagination a possible cos­mic multiplicity and rejoices in realizing that he already encompasses all of it* (Hulin 1978: 302). The same description is appropriate for Para- masiva, pure consciousness, itself understood in this system as the unity of prakaia and vimarfa. Yet such a consciousness ‘cannot be satisfied to contain the objects as “a bag contains nuts”; it possesses them only if it recovers them at every moment’ (Hulin 1978: 301; note that the image is present in SpN I 2, where it is said that the world ‘has not come out of him [the Lord], as does a walnut from a bag’ — na prasevakäd iväk- sotädi tat tasmän nirgatam apf). Thus there is a double movement: on the one hand, cosmic dispersion, when consciousness, disaggregating its host of energies, brings about the creation of the universe; on the other, its reabsorption within consciousness. Moreover, such delimitation, seen as bondage, is nothing else than the alteration, freely chosen by Siva, of his own saktiy energy or power. Hence, his omnipotence, in play (we meet"},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"325here the notion of divine krîdâ) reducing itself so as a ‘this* emerges as antagonist to the T , appears as the altered and constrictive form of the éaktyanda, the ‘sphere/envelope of Energy’, that is the reduced, as well as reducing, energy (or power) of the Lord.Actual creation begins with the power of division and dichotomiza- tion that is mdya, associated with the five kancukas. Thus is constituted mâyânda, the ‘sphere of mâyâ, or Illusion’. Its seven tattvas, from mâyà to purusa, stand for that level of experience where the one who was pure subject starts seeking, in illusion and delusion, for what is outside of him. As such mâyânda is the condition required for the manifestation of prakrtyanda, the ‘sphere of Nature’, which, beginning with prakrti and consisting of the following twenty-three tattvas, offers the complete delin­eation of cognizable reality (meya) divided into drastr, the ‘seer’ (who is but his karanas), and drsya, the ‘seen’, viz., the five tanmdtras and the five bhütas.At the core of prakrtyanda, the last ‘sphere/envelope’ is to be found — which coincides with the grossest tattva, earth — which stands for the body itself, according to reasonings first put forth by Sâmkhya (see kâ. 22 on this point). Thus is constituted the prthvyanda, the ‘Terrestrial sphere’. It represents the grossest level of experience, where one mistakes the body for the Self, i.e., when pure consciousness fully appropriates to itself those fictitious contents, the body and so forth (buddhi, etc.), that are extrinsic to it. Thus the way the four andas are fit into each other expresses the pro­gressive constriction of pure, free, ever-radiating consciousness, in other words, a ‘genesis of bondage’, to borrow the formula coined by Hulin (‘une genèse de la servitude’) in the context of the theory of the thirty-six tattvas (1978: 304).Since the entire manifestation exists within the four andas, they may be seen as encompassing an infinite variety of worlds and their inhabi­tants. Again those inhabitants are endowed with an infinite variety of bodies and faculties which may differ from world to world, as well as, within the same world, from one level of being to another (see YR ad 5). The eighth chapter of the TÀ deals with the bhuvanas (as well as with the notion of anda, in 168b-174) in the course of expounding the desddhvan, ‘Path of space’, of which the bhuvanas represent the most concretized as­pect. As recorded by TÀ itself, their number varies widely from text to text, although they are fundamentally innumerable, as indicated by SvT X, which posits universes along with their subuniverses. Quoting SvT X 2-5a, JR observes, in his avat. to TÀ VIII 9, that ‘since there is an in­finite number of bhuvanas, there is an infinite number of their presiding deities also. Therefore, nobody would attain the Absolute ever, by medi­tating on each of them, even if one devoted innumerable births to it. Such a practice would be thus impractical’ (bhuvanânâm ânantye tadadhïsânâm"},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"326APPENDIXapi anantyam/ in tesam pratyekam evam anusamdhane janmasahasrair api na kascit param yayat/ ity etad asakhydnusthdnam). In a reply to such reserva­tions, TA VIII9-10 refers to Srikanthanatha’s Diksottaratantra (XIII63-67), according to which there are just five bhuvanas, presided over by Brahma, Visnu, Rudra, livara and Anasritasiva respectively. However, according to SvT IV, TA VIII407-427 reckons 224 bhuvanas. TA VIII 428-434a refers to the account of the bhuvanas in the Matahgatantra. At the end, TA VIII 436-452 adopts the count of the MVT (V 1-33), which TA VIII 436b reaf­firms to be the main authority in the Kashmirian nondual Saivism. Thus 118 bhuvanas are enumerated, related to just four of the five kalasy since the fifth kalay in MVT, does not contain any bhuvana (contrary to the SvT which attributes 16 bhuvanas to the fifth kala). JR offers an explanation (avat. to TA VIII 428) for such discrepancy of classification: the bhuvanas are expounded in keeping with the specific prakriya, or process of initia­tion (diksa)y adopted by such and such authoritative text, the difference of the prakriyas corresponding to the difference of the aspirants’ entitle­ments. However, the common feature of all these expositions is that they are made in the context of diksa, which SvTU V 88a (vol. Ill: 38) defines as atmasamskdra, ‘perfecting the Self; thus the Vth chapter of the MVT is entitled diksaprakarana, and the Xth chapter of the SvT: bhuvanadhva- diksaviddhi. This process of diksa implies the process of the ‘purification of the paths’ (adhvaduddhi), whose lower level is the ‘purification of the universes’ (bhuvanasuddhi).Apprehended in the light of these spatial correspondences, the four andas are evidently to be seen as cosmic spheres, all the more so as a presiding deity rules over each of them.Vv. 41-46 of the PS (esp. 41 and 46) deal again with the andas, as related to the mantra SAUH, the hfdayabija, which stands for the whole, inasmuch as it is posited that the first three andas (or kalas) are pervaded by SAy and the fourth by AUy whereas the fifth kald is pervaded by the vis- arga H: such is the teaching (see MVT IV 25 and PTLvj 21-24 in Padoux 1975: 11Off., n. 241 and 275). The correspondences do not end here since, in the context of the ritual of absorption within the hfdayabija (PTLvj 27-28), the four andas are again related to four limbs or organs of the body, according to their place and function. In the PTLvj, the correspon­dences are just alluded to. Nevertheless, according to Swami Laksman Joo quoted by Padoux in his translation (PTLvj: 118, n. 303), the four andas — from pfthvyanda, the lowest one — are respectively related to pada, hasta, pani and mukha, an interpretation that requires a slight alteration in the order of the text which reads: padapdnihastamukha\\ Similarly, correspon­dences are established between kalas and parts of the body (see Brunner SSP, vol. Ill: fig. Ill, IV), as well as between tattvas and parts of the body, in the process of internal worship (see Padoux 1986: 178-180)."},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"3276. spanda (YR ad 4)On the notion of spanda, see AG’s definitions in ÎPV III 1, 3 (vol. II: 221-222): ¿uddho yam spandah [...] kimciccalanâtmatayâ sphuradrupa- tvât, ‘[Sadâsiva] is pure spanda, for he manifests himself in a form which is subtle movement’, and TÀ IV 184-186a: kimciccalanam etdvad ananya- sphuranam hiyat, '[spanda] is subtle movement, autonomous glitter’ (see also Torella ÎPK: 121). The same definition of spanda is found in SpN I 1: citsvdbhâvyâd acalasyâpi áríbhagavatah svâtantryasaktir [...] kimcic- calattàtmakadhâtvarthànugamàt spanda ity abhihità, ‘The svátantrya¿akti of the Lord, though he moves not, being of the nature of consciousness, is known as spanda in accordance with the root-meaning of the word signi­fying “subtle movement” (kimciccalattd)'. That this movement be imper­ceptible is required in order to prevent the objection that the dynamism of the ultimate principle, consciousness, implies its perishability (for activ­ity implies the transformation of the cause, hence its perishability). The Trika postulates self-awareness in the form of a vibration, or a pulsation, that is, a movement that is not a movement, continuous, yet unchanging, and therefore imperceptible. ÏPV I 5, 14 (vol. I: 256-257) develops this line of thought: spandanas ca kimciccalanam/ esaiva ca kimcidrûpatâ yad acalanam api calam âbhàsata ity/ prakàéasvarûpam hi manâg api nátiricyate ’tiricyata iveti tad acalam evàbhàsabhedayuktam iva ca bhàti/, ‘spanda means imperceptible movement. And this imperceptibility [of the movement] consists in this, that what is surely motionless appears as if in motion. For, although the essential nature of consciousness is not to change, it ap­pears to change; [in other words,] that [essential nature of consciousness] which shines as motionless appears as endowed with an infinity of man­ifestations’. Similarly, TÀ IV 183b defines spanda as svdtmanyucchalana, ‘expansion in one’s own self, before developing it (TÀ IV 184b) through the metaphor of the wave that is not different from the ocean (quoted n. 872).7. Anâsritasiva (YR ad 4)See TÀ Vin 10, giving the exposition of the bhuvanas according to the Diksottaratantra: [...] anàsritah sivas tasmâd [viz., sâdâkhyagocaràd] vyàptà f..J, ‘Anâàritasiva pervades [the tattvas] beyond [the realm of Sâdâkhya, viz., beyond éuddhavidyà, Isvara and Sâdâkhya (or Sadâàiva)]’.

As observed by Silbum (Kâlikâstotra: 37) this yogin does not possess the form of perfect consciousness, which, consist­ing of the free play of exteriority (idantâ) within interiority (ahantâ) and"},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"328APPENDIXvice versa, enjoys cosmic bliss (jagadananda). Cosmic bliss, as defined by TA V 50-52a, implies a relation of the Self with the universe, in the form of their co-essentiality. It is in this sense that the yogin deprived of this experience of jagadananda is deemed ‘unrelated [to the universe]’: cidaikyakhyatimay anasritasiva0, ‘[...] Anasritasiva does not experience the unity of absolute consciousness [in which the universe is identified with consciousness]’ (PHvr 4). Nevertheless, Anasritasiva is the stage of expe­rience in which the universe yet to come, that is, empirical manifestation, is prepared, since it is the state (avastha) in which Sakti begins to veil the Self temporarily, and, separating the universe from it, to produce akhyati, nescience, or failure to recognize the real nature of the Self. This is the reason why sunyatiiunya, the ‘Void beyond the Void’, or ‘absolute Void’, is given in PHvr 4 (p. 55) as a synonym for AnaSritaSiva: cidaikydkhyati- maydndfritasivaparydyaiunydtiiunydtmataya [...]. Parama&va, the Whole having nothing outside himself, has to create a Void within himself in order to make room for the universe that he wishes to manifest as dif­ferent from himself. And it is this Void that will assume the form of the objective universe. Cf. TA VIII 402: ancrtritam tu vyapare nimittam hetur ucyate, ‘In the process [of creation], the cause that is not dependent (anasrita) is called the impelling [cause] (hetu)\\ and TAV ad loc.: vya- pdre iti srstyadikriydyam/ iha hi sa eva parah parameivarah svasvatantryat prathamam sunydtmatam avabhasaycm anasritadirupataya prathitah, i n the “activity”, i.e., in the act of creation, etc., the Supreme one, Paramesvara, out of his freedom, first manifests himself as Void, and, manifest in that form, is known as Anasrita’. In terms of mystical experience, Anasritasiva represents the yogin’s stage of passive samadhi, or extasis (cf. Silbum Kalikastotra: 27, 36-37). SSV I 2, quoted n. 226, whose phraseology is similar to that of YR here, describes Anasritasiva as the first manifestation of auto-limitation, freely chosen by Paramaiiva, which eventuates in the maydpramatr.8. Gahana (YR ad 4)TA VIII 317-319 has Gahana the first among the six Rudras occupying the lower fold/cavity (puta) of the mayagranthi, the gross level of maya: madhye putatrayam tasya rudrah sad adhare ’ntare/ eka urdhve ca pance- ti dvadaiaite nirupitah// gahanasadhyau hariharadaieivarau trikalagopad sad ime/ madhye ’nantah ksemo dvijesavidyetavisvasivah// satsu ca putagesu tatpardvfttya/ parivarttate sthitih kila devo 'nantas tu sarvatha madhye//, ‘Within that [mayagranthi], there is a triad of folds/cavities (puta). In the lower one, there are six Rudras, in the middle there is one, in the upper one there are five. Thus twelve Rudras have been described. The six [Rudras] are Gahana, Asadhya, Harihara, Daiesvara, Trikala, Gopati. Ananta is in the middle.

[Regarding those five] and those six [Rudras] remain­ing in their [respective] folds/cavities, the location is liable to change, for they are interchangable. Nevertheless, Lord Ananta always remains in the middle’. Those two lines are a paraphrase of SvT X 1124-1127, as shown by TÀV VIII 317-319, which quotes it (p. 1566). Although SvT X 1124-1127 enumerates thirteen Rudras, placing six Rudras in the up­per fold, among which Ananta (to be distinguished from the Ananteia in the middle fold, who is defined as jagatpati, the ‘Lord of the world*), the two lists are parallel: Dasesâna in SvT corresponds to Dasesvara in TÀ; Ksemeéa to Ksema; Bràhmanasvàmin, the ‘Lord of the Brâhmanas*, to Dvi- jesa; Vidyesâna to Vidyesa, and Visvesa to Visva. One observes that JR*s reading of SvT 1124-1127 allows emendation of the SvT ed.: brahmana- svâmï instead of brahmanah svâmï (since Bràhmanasvàmin is the synonym of DvijeSa), viiveia instead of vidyesa (since Vtévesa is the synonym of Visva).9. Phonemic emanation (YR ad 10-11)Such speculations appear to be quite in keeping with those of VP 1 1-2 and its vjtti, which establish that since, in our cognition, we identify the objects with their words, the objects are essentially of the nature of the word. Cf. VP I 1-2: anddinidhanarn brahma sabdatattvam yad aksaram/ vivartate 'rthabhdvena prakriya jagato ya ta h // ekam eva yad dmndtam bhin- naiakdvyapdsraydt/ aprthaktve 'pi saktibhyah prthaktveneva vartate/ / , ‘Ce Brahman sans commencement ni fin, Parole principielle, Phonème (im­périssable), qui se manifeste sous la forme des objets et d’où procède le monde animé, Lui qui, révélé comme un, est le support de pouvoirs dif­férents et paraît divisé sous l’effet de ses pouvoirs, quoi qu’il soit indivis [...]’, which may be summarized as follows: brahmanf which is Word- principle (sabdatattva), ‘appears as the objects’ (vivartate 'rthabhdvena). Thus, the creation of the world proceeds from it. The brahman is the one appearing as many, for it is the holder [lit., ‘substratum’] of a multiplicity of powers (sa/ctz). Though not different from its powers, it seems to be so. As Biardeau (VP: 25, n. 1) puts it: ‘C’est l’Absolu lui-même qui se mani­feste sous la forme des phénomènes par l’intermédiaire de ses pouvoirs. Le éabdabrahmavàda est donc un monisme de type bheddbheda' [— ‘It is the Absolute itself which manifests in the form of phenomena through its powers. Therefore, the sabdabrahmavàda is a monism of the bheddbheda category’]. Here also, the process of the Lord’s manifestation is nothing but the progressive display and differentiation of his supreme energy — a notion which MVT III 5-9a, quoted in both SpN III 13 and SSV III 19, clearly develops: yd sà éaktir jagaddhdtuh kathitd samavdyinl/ icchdtvam ta- sya sà devf sispksoh pratipadyate// saikâpi saty anekatvam yathà gacchati tac chrnu/ evam etad id jneyam ndnyathed suniscitam// jndpayand jagaty atra"},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"330APPENDIXjnanaSakdr nigadyate/ evam bhavatv idam sarvam id karyonmukhi ya d d // jd- ta tadaiva tad vastu kurvaty atra kriyocyate/ evam esa dvirupapi punar bhedair anantatam/ arthopadhivaJad yati cintamanir iveivan//, ‘When the Master of the world wishes to create, his [supreme] isakti, the Goddess who is said to be inherent in him, becomes Will [viz., energy of Will]. Listen how she, though one, becomes many. Similarly, when she makes the knowable known as definitely “this” and not as something else, she is named in this world “energy of Knowledge”. Similarly, when she becomes intent on act­ing, considering: “Let all this come to be [just as I have willed and known it]”, [that same energy], arisen at the very moment she creates the object, is then named the “[energy of] Action”. Thus, though [already] of two forms [Knowledge and Action], she differentiates herself again, becoming innumerable, thanks to those objects, which [function as her] contingent attributes. Therefore, this sovereign Goddess is to be compared to the thought-gem that yields all desires’. MVT III 9b-13a goes on to describe the form assumed by the supreme Sakti when considered from the point of view of phonemic emanation: becoming Matfka, she shifts from the level of paravac to that of pasyand, again dividing herself into different phonemes or groups of phonemes, grouped into eight vargas and presided over by eight matrkas. Thus emerge from one another in succession the Lord’s energies, seen as a ‘wheel’ — a multitude assuming the forms of all possible words and things.10. saptapramatrs (YR ad 14)The notion of a hierarchy of subjects — usually seven in number, but not uniformly — is common to all schools of isaivism, including those that are dualistic. The notion itself of a ‘heptad of subjects’ (pramatpaptaka) seems to be mainly of Saiddhantika origin, as is suggested in TAV X 7-8 (avat.), wherein a Traika adept questions the need for the seven just men­tioned (TA X 6-7a): nanv asmaddarsane naraJaktisivatmakam eva viivam id sarvatrodghosyate tat katham iha siddhdntadarianadisamucitam pramatrbhe- dam avalambyaitad uktam [...], ‘But, one might object, is it not everywhere proclaimed, in our school, that the world consists of nara, Sakti and Siva? So why has this [doctrine of the seven pramatp] been stated here [in TA X 6-7a] by adopting the types of pramatp congenial to schools such as the Siddhanta?’The seven subjects represent different levels, or modes, of conscious­ness, that is, of cognitive experience, as is made clear by the metaphor of SpN 1 1, in which they are said to be different ‘roles’ (bhumika) assumed by i>iva: s'rundn mahesvaro hi svatantryasaktya sivamantramahedvaramantres- varamantravijndndkalapralaydkalasakaldntam pramdtrbhumikam tadvedya- bhumikam ca grhnanah, ‘By his power of absolute freedom, the glorious Great Lord assumes [on the subjective level] the cognitive roles of Siva,"},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"331the Mantramahe^varas, the Mantresvaras, the Mantras, the Vijnânâkalas, the Pralayâkalas and the Sakalas [, whereas, on the objective level,] he as­sumes the roles [of the objects that are] made known thereby’.

HI: 175): devah parâvâksaktimayah sivabhattâraka eva sadâJiva id gfhitatattadbbûmikah svayam gurusisyapade sthitveti, ‘Sadâiiva is Lord Siva [half-]made of that sakti that is supreme Speech (parâvâc). And the fact that “he adopts by himself the [double] posture of the teacher and the pupil (guruéisyapade sthitvâ)” means that “he [alone] assumes each of those roles (bhûmikâ).” ’ As modes of consciousness, the seven categories of subject are related to the tattvas understood as different levels of expe­rience.So variable are Saiva texts, both in describing the levels of subjectivity and in locating them on the scale of the tattvas that it would be difficult, within the limits of our exposé, to give an account of them in detail (see, notably, Torella ÏPK: 199ff., Vasudeva MVT: 151-178). It is, however, possible to account for the more systematic classification of the ‘heptad of subjects’ later proposed by AG and his immediate followers, which is modeled on the MVT (114ff., I I 1-9), itself reformulated in IPK III 2, 6-20. And it should be noted that AG, particularly in his TÀ, emphasizes the reg­ular correspondence not only between the levels of subjectivity and those of manifestation (tattvas), but also between the levels of subjectivity and the three impurities (mala), or, more exactly, between those levels and the stages of the process by which the aspirant gradually frees himself from those impurities (see TÂ IX 93b-96, translated by Vasudeva MVT: 172). AG elaborates, and, indeed, rationalizes the Saiva doctrine of a hierar­chy of subjects in TÀ IX 84-96, X 6ff. (he refers again to that doctrine elsewhere, such as TÀ XV 339-341, etc.), TS IX, PTV 5-9b, ÎPV III 2 and ÎP W ad loc. (vol. Ill: 319-323) and ad I 7, 14 (vol. II: 404-405). So do, on the one hand, his exegetes, Jayaratha ad TÂ and YR ad PS (see kàrikâs 14 and 23), and, on the other hand, Ksemarâja, in his PH (sütra 3) with auto-commentary, and in several other commentaries (SpN I 1, quoted above, !>SV I 2-3, etc.). We sketch here the hierarchy of the seven subjects in descending order, as does YR in his gloss to PS 14, dealing with the first five, and in his gloss to PS 23, dealing with the last two, according to the distinction between éuddhâdhvan and aiuddhàdhvan: 1) As pure, undivided, vibrating consciousness, Siva (i.e., Siva/Sakti) is the highest subject. 2) The Mantramahesvaras, the ‘Great Lords of Mantras’, are located at the level of Sadâéiva. Thus the level of Sadâsiva is that very high level of consciousness where ‘this’, although appearing at the hori­zon of consciousness, remains immersed within the ‘I’. Nevertheless, the essential unity of consciousness has been somehow fragmented, as shown"},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"332APPENDIXby the plural applied to those Mantramahesvaras. 3) Then come, a grade below, the 118 MantreSvaras, the ‘Lords of Mantras’. Located at the level of livara, they represent the level of consciousness that operates there. Whatever may be the interpretation of the experience which the Isvara state symbolizes (see YR’s exegesis ad PS 14, which differs in some way of the classical one), it is the level of consciousness corresponding to the state in which one experiences more distinctly the emergence of an ideal objectivity, without deviating from one’s own essential ipseity. As differ­ent modes of this essential ipseity, Siva, the Mantramahesvaras and the Mantresvaras are free of all impurity. 4) Being located at the level of sud- dhavidya, pure, perfect Knowledge, the Mantras still belong to the plane of the suddhadhvan. Nevertheless, although ideal, the clear introduction of differentiation, which characterizes the stage of iuddhavidya, implies the presence of maya, even if not yet fully developed (aprarudha), inasmuch as no sense of alterity is generated (see n. 508). Therefore, the experi- encers located at this level, the Mantras, are affected by the mayiyamala (see iPK III 2, 9 on the Vidyesvaras, with Utpaladeva’s vrtti). They are associated with the Vidyesvaras, a group of eight deities (SpN II 2 men­tions two of them: Anantabhattaraka and Vyomavyapin; see also IPV III 1, 6: vidyesvara bbagavanto ’nantadya vartante), whose specific task is that of accomplishing four of the five cosmic functions (pancakrtya), as well as striving for the liberation of limited souls, ‘acting as intermediaries in the revelation of the teachings of Siva, etc.’ (Torella IPK: 201, n. 14); see n. 510. Being etymologically ‘those who ideate [creation]’, the Mantras are perfect instruments for the Vidyesvaras who employ them in this dou­ble task. Thus the plane occupied by the crowd of the seventy million Mantras headed by the Vidyesvaras represents ‘the mode of conscious­ness in which vast but internally differentiated segments of the universe flash into view’ (Sanderson 1986: 192). Facing a reality considered other than themselves, the Vidyesvaras, residing at the plane of iuddhavidya, are omniscient inasmuch as ‘they are identified with consciousness’ (iPvf III 2, 9). For the same reason, since that consciousness is made of both prakaia and vimarsa (that dynamic principle which manifests itself as the activity of the ‘I’ and receives therefore the name of kartfta, ‘agency’), they are endowed with agency, as is shown by their accomplishing four of the five ‘duties’ (krtya). Yet, since they conceive the objects of their action as different from themselves, due to the mayiyamala, such agency is partial (IPK III 2, 9), and can be contrasted with the omnipotence of the Mantresvaras and Mantramahesvaras. ‘Therefore, IPvf III 2, 9 con­cludes, they too must be considered finite souls (anutva)’; see n. 510. 5) The presence of agency, even though partial, is what distinguishes the Vidyesvaras/Mantras from the next level of consciousness, namely the Vi- jnanakalas (or Vijnanakevalas) — defined (iPK III 2, 6-7) as pure con­"},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"333sciousness (iuddhabodha), in the sense that ‘they no longer contaminate self-representation with the projection of the impure tattvas from maya to earth (prthiviy (Sanderson 1986: 191). In other words, they no longer consider what is not the Self, viz., the body, the mind, etc., as the Self (a mode of consciousness which is that of the Sakalas). Therefore, in contrast to the VidyeSvaras, the Vijnanakalas are free of the mayiyamala, the impu­rity of differentiation, and in contrast to the following states, Pralayakalas and Sakalas, they are also free of the karmamala, the impregnating of con­sciousness with impressions left by one’s good or bad actions; thus do not transmigrate any longer. On the other hand, they are completely de­void of agency (kartrta), i.e., of ¡-consciousness (vimarsa, or spanda), with the result that they consider themselves incomplete or deficient. Thus, they are subject to the anavamala, the impurity consisting of the intuition of limitedness, that is, they fail to recognize their own creative freedom Csvatantrya) and own essential plenitude (purnata). Their name, ‘those In­ert in Gnosis’ as Sanderson translates it, accounts for those two symmetric features. So does their location on the scale of the rattvas, since, accord­ing to some texts (notably YR ad 14, and PTV 5-9b quoted n. 511), they hang suspended between the pure Csuddhadhvan) and the impure universe (asuddhadhvan), being placed below iuddhavidya and above maya, in an intermediary tattva, created ad hoc for purposes specific to 6aiva specu­lation, namely, the mahdmdya, the ‘Great Illusion’. Thus the Vijnanakala represents the mode of consciousness belonging to the yogin engaged on the path leading to liberation. According to the IP W (vol. Ill: 322), it is a kind of experience (bhogaviiesa) which may be attained through a special initiation intended to facilitate leaving [behind] the realm of ma- ya, either through meditative realization (Wiavana), or through concen­tration (dharana), contemplation (dhyana) or absorption Csamadhi) that have maya for their object (cf. Torella IPK: 200, n. 12). Thus, PTV (Skt. text: p. 57) teaches that ‘the Vijnanakalas and the Pralayakalas do not have the idea of mama, “[this is] mine”, [in certain states as samadhi] ’ (yijnandkaldndm pralaydkalanam ca [...] mameti vyatiriktam nasti). 6) The Pralayakalas, or Pralayakevalas, ‘those Inert in Dissolution’, represent the mode of consciousness in which the Self is suspended in a state of iner­tia, which explains the common analogy of deep, i.e., dreamless, sleep. On the meaning of the term ‘Pralayakala*, see IPV III 2, 8 (vol. II: 252), quoted n. 625. The ‘dissolution’ of their name is a metaphor for the state of total absorption found in deep sleep, which is itself further analyzed as twofold, according to whether some internal sensation (savedya or prana) persists or not, the latter stage being that of real absorption or ‘dissolu­tion’. Thus the doctrine distinguishes between two levels of Pralayakalas (IPK III 2, 8). Sanderson (1986: 191) defines the lower one, as ‘analo­gous to dreamless but blissful sleep Csavedyapralaydkalata) and the other to"},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"334APPENDIXdreamless sleep completely void of sensation (apavedyapralayâkalatâ)’. In Utpaladeva’s fourfold division of the limited self (mâyâpramâtr), the lower Pralayâkala is also termed prânapramâtr, for he experiences the Self as an internal sensation (prâna), and the higher one is termed éûnyapramâtr, for he experiences the Self as the Void (sûnya). In the prânapramâtr, the ma- yïyamala persists, whereas it is transcended in the éûnyapramâtry with the complete, although transitory, dissolution of the mâyic world. However, kârmamala remains at both levels, for, though all actions have dissolved in the perfect inertia of deep sleep, ‘the impressions of past actions remain, waiting to regenerate world-experience' (Sanderson 1986: 191) when the period of dissolution comes to an end, that is, when one awakes. Thus, as is the immediately inferior Sakala, the lower Pralayâkala is subject to the three impurities, whereas the higher Pralayâkala is free of the mqyi- yamala. See also YR ad 23, who defines the Pralayàkalas as the ones ‘who are freed from the particular [that is, from gross materiality] and from the body*. 7) At the bottom of the ladder, the Sakala, ‘endowed with factors of fragmentation (kala)\\ is the ordinary limited consciousness existing solely in the states of waking and dream, immersed in the mâyic world, taking as the Self what is not the Self, and denied even the transitory redemption of dreamless sleep. See YR ad 23: ‘Are called Sakalas those cognizing sub­jects who are of a bodily nature because of the factors of fragmentation (kalâ), beginning with the faculties in their “pure” state [that is, without adjunction of object] (indriyamâtra) and ending with particular [objects] [that is, with the mahâbhütas]\\ For a detailed exposition of the reverse process, through which the meditator, gradually freeing himself from the sentiment of differentiation, aims at reaching the intuition of identity with the deity, that is, consciousness itself, see TÀ IX 90b-97a, XIII 275b-76; also Sanderson 1986: 190-193.11. gunatattva (YR ad 19)In Sâmkhya, unconscious nature (prakfti) is the “cause” (at least in the sense of the material cause) of the world; in Trika, consciousness itself is that cause, the world being nothing but its external manifestation. The Trika explains the phenomenal world as resulting from the progressive obscuration and constriction of the Lord's supreme energy, which is his freedom. Thus it establishes a ‘genesis of bondage' (Hulin 1978: 304 — une ‘genèse de la servitude') against the background of an essential vibra­tion which, though progressively weakened, or so it seems, never ceases to tremble. Sakti is the fundamental principle that distinguishes Trika from Sâmkhya, despite similarities in the cosmologies of the two systems. The Trika understands empirical diversity in terms of the dichotomy of enjoyer (bhoktr) and object of enjoyment (bhogya). In this context, purusa is the enjoyer whereas prakrd represents the totality of such objects — an"},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"335argument similar to that of the Samkhya concerning the purusa, who “con­templates” prakrti as though she were a dancer, or an actress, performing before him (SK 59). prakfti offers the entire objective world to the en- joyer, although its objectivity is as yet potential. Thus TS VIII, p. 83 con­trasts the actualized world (prakrtitattvasya sargah), with prakrti defined as the homogeneous and quiescent aggregate of the three gunas. prakrti is not only creation in potentia, it is also the fundamental principle persist­ing in each and every particular object of enjoyment, once creation has taken place: [...] esa eva sukhaduhkhamohdtmakabhogyavHesdnusyutasya sdmdnyamatrasya tadgunasdmydparandmnah prakrtitattvasya sargah, ‘[...] Such is the creation pertaining to prakrtitattva; this prakrtitattva, which is nothing else than the common principle (samanya) inherent (anusyuta) in [each] specific object of enjoyment made of pleasure, pain and delusion, is also termed the equilibrium of those gunas (tadgunasdmya)\\ The TS (pp. 84-85) gives an alternative definition of prakrti as bhogyasdmdnya, ‘state of equilibrium of the objects of enjoyment’, which makes it the archetype of objectivity itself. Some disturbance of this ideal equilibrium is necessary so that actual objectivity emerges from its potential “cause”. So TS (p. 85): evam ksubdhat pradhanat kartavyantarodayo naksubdhad iti, ‘Thus other effects [buddhi, etc.] emerge from the disturbed pradhana, and not from the undisturbed one*. The point is of so much importance that the TS postulates additionally a gunatattva: ksobho Vafyam eva antarale 1bhyupagantavya id siddham samkhydparidrstam prthagbhutam gunatattvam, ‘One must necessarily accept that this disturbance takes place in-between [the two principles]. Thus has a gunatattva distinct [from prakrti and bud­dhi] been established, which Samkhya has failed to discern’. The term ‘fcsob/ia’ has itself been borrowed from the Samkhya, more precisely from late Samkhya, where it appears intended to gloss over a glaring lapsus in the system — for the initial coming into contact of two utterly unlike principles (for so it conceives purusa and prakrti) is indeed difficult to jus­tify. A true dualism is thus difficult to maintain, and this may have been the reason for the introduction of the three qualities, which are never, in fact, in a state of equilibrium; their ‘resting’ being then nothing but an hy­pothesis motivated by the doctrine itself. This means that, regarding the gunas, the loss of equilibrium is as much a category in its own right as the equilibrium itself, and thus deserves to receive a name, that of gunatattva.12. Evolution of the phenomenal world (YR ad 19)In the Samkhya (see SK 22), whereas purusa stands isolated, neither an effect, nor a cause, buddhi and ahahkara proceed successively from prakrti, the primal cause; cf. also SK 3, which defines four types of entities by hav­ing recourse to the opposition ‘producer-product’ (prakrti-vikrti). Then, from ahahkara, the ‘group of sixteen’ emerges, which includes manas, the"},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"336APPENDIXfive buddhuidriyas, the five karmendriyas and the five tanmatras. A fur­ther analysis (SK 25) distinguishes the ‘group of eleven* (manas and all the ten indriyas), effect of the sattvikahahkara (also named vaikrta), from the five tanmatras, products of the tamasdhahkara (also named bhutadi, for it is the secondary cause of the bhutas); see n. 593. And all of them are di­rectly, i.e., horizontally, related to ahankara, instead of vertically evolving from one another (SK 25-28). As for the five bhutas, they proceed from the five tanmatras; see Hulin 1978: 73ff. and Larson 1979: 179ff., 236 (chart). On the other hand, although SK 33 defines the antahkarana as threefold, its identity as a whole is not fixed, buddhi, ahankara and manas being clearly distinguished from each other and endowed with different status. The Trika also derives the manas and the ten indriyas from the sattvikahahkara (see n. 593), whereas the five tanmatras proceed from the aspect of the sattvikahahkara in which tamas assumes predominance, as shown by two parallel passages of TS VIII. See TS VIII, p. 87: tatra sattviko yasmad manas ca buddhlndriyapahcakam ca, tatra manasi janye sarvatanma- trajananasamarthyayuktah sa janakah, ‘From the sattvika [ahankara] manas and the pentad of the buddhuidriyas proceed. Once the manas is evolved [from the sattvikahahkara], the same ahankara [in the aspect in which tamas is predominant] becomes the cause capable of giving rise to all the tanmatras’, and TS VIII, p. 89: bhoktramfacchadakat tu tamahpradha- nahahkarat tanmatrani vedyaikarupanipahca, ‘However, from the [aspect of the sattvika] ahankara in which tamas assumes predominance, and which veils the enjoyer’s part [viz., the subjectivity], proceed the five tanmatras, which are only object of knowledge (vedya) [and which do no partake of the knower, as is the case with the manas and the indriyas]\\ This concep­tion of the tanmatras originating from the sattvikahahkara (even though it is from its tamasa part) is an innovation as regards the Samkhya scheme. In fact, in the Trika reasonings, the sattvikahahkara itself is trigunatmaka: although it abounds in sattva, some traces of the two other gunas remain; see Mukund Ram Shastri ad TS VIII, p. 87, n. 80 (ad tatra sattviko yasmad manas ca...): sattvikah sattvapradhano yato guntbhutataya rajastamasor api sambhava ity arthah. Therefore, one has to understand that, once the manas has emerged from the sattvikdhankdra equally characterized by the three gunas, the five tanmatras are produced from the subordinated tamoguna of the sattvikahahkara. The Trika agrees again with the Samkhya by making the bhutas directly emerge from the tanmatras. However, its perspective is altogether different, since it emphasizes, with the concept of ksobha, ‘dis­turbance*, the persistence of vibrating consciousness within all the levels of phenomenal diversity. Thus, the entire process of the manifestation of the tattvas takes place according to the principle that the cause in its disturbed form is called the effect (see TS VIII, p. 90, in Appendix 13)."},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":"337Each tanmatra is considered to be the quintessential form of the cor­responding mahabhuta, inasmuch as it constitutes its distinctive quality. Thus sound is associated with ether, or cosmic space, considered to be the substratum of the propagation of waves; touch with air, etc. Yet, with the exception of ether which has sound for its unique quality, one has to admit that other mahabhutas possess more than one sensible qual­ity, or, to put it differently, that one tanmatra may be present in more than one mahabhuta: for instance sound is present in all the mahabhutas. Thus classical Samkhya (e.g., Yuktidipika 38) has elaborated the theory of the progressive accumulation of the qualities, furthermore explained — just as in YR ad 22 — as the cumulative combination of the tanmatras, according to the principle that the effect is proportionate to the cause. Hence, if space is experienced as sonorous, air as sonorous and tangi­ble, fire as sonorous, tangible and visible, water as sonorous, tangible, visible and savory, earth as sonorous, tangible, visible, savory and fra­grant, it is because space proceeds from sound, air from sound and con­tact, etc. This is also the position of the Trika (see YR’s commentary itself) with the difference that emphasis is once more laid on the prin­ciple of ksobha, as shown by TS VIII, p. 90 (emending sabdatanmatram to sparsatanmatram): tatra sabdatanmatrat ksubhitad avakdsaddnavyaparam nabhah — sabdasya vacyddhydsdvakdsasahatvat/ sparsa(sabda)tanmatram ksubhitam vayuh sabdas tv asya nabhasa virahitdbhavat/ rupam ksubhitam tejah purvagunau tu purvavat/ rasah ksubhita apah purve trayah purvavat/ gandhah ksubhito dhara purve catvarah purvavat/ anye sabdasparsabhyam vayuh ityadikramena pancabhyo dharany iti manyante/ gunasamudayama- tram ca prthivi nanyo gunl kascit/, ‘From disturbed (ksubhita) sound (iab- datanmatra) emerges the ether [or space] (nabhas), with its function of providing space — for the word [as articulated sound] gives place to the expressed meaning. Air (vayu) is nothing else than disturbed touch Csparsa); however, sound (sabda) is also present, for air cannot exist with­out space (nabhas) [whose quintessential quality is sound]. Fire (tejas) is nothing else than disturbed form (rupa); however, the two preceding prin­ciples [i.e., tanmatras] are also present, as in the previous scheme. Wa­ter (apas) is nothing else than disturbed savor (rasa); however, the three preceding principles are also present, as in the previous scheme. Earth (dhara) is nothing else than disturbed odor (gandha); however, the four preceding principles are also present, as in the previous scheme. Others maintain that earth proceeds from [all] the five [tanmatras] in keeping with a scheme according to which air proceeds from both sound and tan­gibility. Moreover earth is merely the aggregate of the qualities [i.e., of the tanmatras] and there is no substratum of qualities (gunin) which would be different from [earth as aggregate of the qualities]’.

This is why the Samkhya contends that, during the process of cosmic dissolution, each mahabhuta is reabsorbed into the tanmatra from which it proceeds, and all the tanma- tras are in turn reabsorbed into ahankara. IPV III 1, 10-11, vol. II: 242, synthesizes the Trika’s viewpoint not only on the entire meya, that cog­nizable reality made of twenty-three elements (the thirteen karanas and the ten karyas) whose cause is prakrti, but also on the entire ‘genesis of bondage* which starts with mdya. Observing that, in IPK III 1, 11, the bhutas are mentioned first, before the tanmatras, AG develops all the im­plications of such an order: sthulam karyam prthivy apah tejo vdyur nabha iti panca bhutani/ suksmam esam eva rupam gandho raso rupam spariah sabda iti/ tatraikaikagunam akasady ekaikavrddhagunam veti darianabhe- da id na vivecito 'nupayogat/ tatra sthulam vibhaktam avibhagasydnumd- pakam iti sthularupopakramam uktam/ atra pfthivyddyabhdsa eva misrTbhuya ghatadisvalaksanibhutdh karmendriyair upasarpita buddhuidriyair alocita an- tahkaranena samkalpitdbhimataniicitarupa vidyaya vivecitah kaladibhir anu- ranjitah pramatari visramyanti/ id tatparyam, ‘The gross effect [manifests itself] as the five physical elements Cbhuta): earth, water, fire, air and ether.

But others maintain that each item, in the order given here, has one quality more than the item succeeding. However, since this point is not very important, it has not been discussed here. The gross, which presents the state of differentiation, is the means of inferring the undifferentiated state. Hence the gross categories are stated here first. According to this system [i.e., to the Trika], the manifested principles (abhasa) such as earth, etc., mixing with one another, assume the form of a definite object, such as jar, etc. They come to rest in the subject as they are approached by the organs of action, or perceived by the cognitive organs, synthesized, taken as one’s own, and ascertained by [the manas, the ahankara and the buddhi constitutive of] the antahkarana, differentiated by circumstancial Knowledge (vidya) and affected by [the other kahcukas as] kala, etc. This is the implied meaning* (tr.

Vaisesika and Vaiyâkarana concepts of jâti, sàmânya, sattâ, and mahâsattâ (YR ad 27)It is a typically Vaisesika notion that even the ‘universal* Csâmânya) must be distinguished into at least two varieties: ‘being* (sattâ) — which is devoid of external distinction, therefore, unqualified — and what comes to be known as jâti, ‘genus* — which is common to various individuals but differs from genus to genus, on which distinctions depends our behavior in the world. Frauwallner observes, apropos (II: 104), that what are called sâmânyaviéesa, ‘Gemeinsamkeit-Besonderheit* Ogenerality-particularity*), occupy the logical space between sâmànya as such, that is, sattâ, ‘being* (untouched by particularity), and viéesa as such, the ‘particular’ (the ‘at­om’, untouched by any universal). This ‘sâmânyavisesa* was by the Vai- sesikas then termed jâ ti1, so as not to confuse it with their ‘d/c/ti*, which for them did not mean ‘common form* (op. cit: 102). YR seems however to confound ‘genus* (jâti) with ‘universal* (sâmânya), which, according to Frauwallner, should be distinguished, mahâsattâ as such is not a Vaisesika term. It appears in the grammatical tradition, particularly in Helârâja’s commentary on Bhartfhari (avat. to VP III 1, 33), in a characterization of the ladvayanaya\\ presumably the advaya of Bhartrhari: [...] adva- yanaye paramârthasatyekaiva jâtir mahâsattâkhyâ parabrahmasvabhâvâ, ‘In a monistic doctrine, this jâti termed mahâsattâ is of the nature of para- brahman, the highest brahman, the only ultimate reality (paramârthasad)\\ The term mahâsattâ appears also in the Trika; see IPK I 5, 13-14 (quoted n. 238), which passage characterizes consciousness endowed with aware­ness as supreme Speech (parâvâk), freedom (svâtantrya), sovereignty (atf- varya) of the supreme Self, fulguration (sphurattâ), ‘great being* (mahâsat­tâ), unmodified by space and time (deiakâlâviéesinï). In the Trika tradition, the mahâ- of mahâsattâ may be understood as a reference, somewhat cor­rupted, to Vaisesika and Vyâkarana doctrine, ‘great* signifying ‘par excel­lence*, vis-à-vis all the other ‘sâmânyas* that are tinged with particularity — as ‘great* in the English idiom “God is the one great cause”.

II: 194): [...] khalu kanada dtmatva- bhisambandhad atma ityadina dharmirupam atmdnam nirupya [...], ‘Verily, the followers of Kanada, having explained that the atman is “that which supports the attributes” (dharmin), according to the statement: “The Self (atman) is such due to its connexion with Selfhood (dtmatva)”. [...]’ — meaning that, for Vaisesikas, atman is considered a dravya, a substance, and as such is connected with its jati, namely, dtmatva, as well as with its qualities (guna), namely, jnana, sukhaduhkha, etc., and is thus a dharmin distinct from its attributes (dharma). JR concludes his gloss by affirming the Trika position: na vastutah kascit iaktitadvator bhedah, ‘In reality, there is no difference between energy (iakti) and its possessor [viz., saktimat]’.16. MTmamsaka position on the Self, according to the Trika (YR ad 32)After interpreting SpK 14 from the Trika viewpoint, according to which anyatra, ‘elsewhere’, refers to the Supreme Lord, or supreme Self, Kse- maraja shows that the verse may also be understood both as formulating the MTmamsaka doctrine and as its implicit and logical refutation, ‘any­atra’ thus refers to the puryastaka — a position conditionally adopted by Ksemaraja in order to demonstrate that one must not stop at that under­standing, but should rather recognize, within this puryastaka, a transcen­dental Subject who is Sankara or Siva, as a ‘[uniform] mass of blissful consciousness’ (cidanandaghana); see SpN I 4: mmdmsakaparihdraya tv etad inham vyakhydtavyam/ aham sukhityadisamvido yds ta anyatreti pur- yastakasvarupepramatari sukhadyavasthdbhir anusyute otaprotarupe [...] na tv asmadabhyupagate fsmimi cidanandaghane sahkaratmani svasvabhave — iti na sarvada sukhadyupadhitiraskrto \\yam atmapi tu cinmayah/ yada tu ni- jasuddhya vaksyamanayayam svasvarupam guhayitva tisthati tada puryasta- kadyavasthdydm sukhitvadirupatasya tatrapi na nirodhas taih sukhadibhir asya [...]/ aham krio bam sthula ityadipratltiparihdrena aham sukhi duhkhi- tyadi vadato yam asayah, ‘In order to refute the MTmamsakas, this [i.e., the term atman] should be interpreted as follows.

[But] it does not signify for the [MT- mamsakas] that essential nature which is accepted by us, namely, Sankara [Siva] as a uniform mass of blissful consciousness. [As a consequence of our definition], this Self [according to us] is not always veiled by contin­gent attributes (upadhi) of pleasure, etc. [as MTmamsakas say]; rather, it is pure consciousness (cinmaya). When, through his own impurity (aiuddhi) [that we will later expound], he conceals his own nature and appears [con­ditionally] (tisthati), he then, being in that state of puryastaka, etc., takes on the form of [the experiencer of] pleasure, etc. Even in this state, there is no obstruction [of his real nature] by those experiences of pleasure, etc. [...]. This is the real intention of him [viz., the MTmamsaka] who says: “I am happy”, “I am sad”, etc., in rejection of assertions such as “I am thin”, “I am fat”, etc. [as characterizations of the Self]’; in other words, from the Trika point of view, the MTmamsaka’s real intention is that the sub­stratum of such experiences is a transcendent Self, defined as one mass of consciousness and bliss. Showing thus that the MTmamsaka view implies within itself its own completion, Ksemaraja adds that one has only to sub­merge the puryastaka along with phenomenal diversity within the supreme Self (SpN I 4): sukhitvadipratitisambhinndm puryastakabhumim antarmukhe pade nimajjayams tadanusatigena bahyasyapi dehaghatader galanat pratya- bhijanaty eva svam £ivasvabhavatvamy ‘Indeed, one recognizes (pratyabhija- nati) one’s own essential nature as Siva by submerging one’s own condi­tion, that of puryastaka, replete with experiences of pleasure, etc., in the inner state [viz., the Self], and by dissolving along with it the externality that consists of body, jar, etc.’ (tr. Singh, modified).17. sunyavada (YR ad 32)According to the avat. of SpN 112-13, the Sunyavadins are ‘the Vedan- tins Cirutyantavid), the Naiyayikas (viz., Aksapada) and the Madhyamikas, for whom remains only the principle of naught or universal destruction’ (visvocchedarupam abhavdtmakam eva tattvam avasisyate). The Vedantins (or Brahmavadins) are otherwise called Abhavabrahmavadins, as this is developed by PHvj* 8: asad evedam asld ity abhdvabrahmavadinah iunyabhu- vam avagahya sthitah, ‘The Brahmavadins, adepts of non-Being (abhava), descend into the region of Void (sunyabhu) on the basis of [ChU VI 2, 1]: “In the beginning, this [world] was just Non-being” and remain [there]*. The discussion of SpN I 12-13 starts with the same quote from the ChU, whose full form is: sad eva saumya idam agrasid ekam evadvitiyam/ tad- dhaika ahur asad evedam agrasid ekam evadvitiyam/ tasmad asatah sad ajayateti, ‘In the beginning, my dear, this was Being alone, one only without a second.

SpN I 5 describes the Mâdhyamikas as sarvesäm ab- hävavädinah, ‘those who assert the non-existence of everything’, whereas SpN 1 12-13 quotes and refutes Nägärjuna. See also ÄS II 23, which char­acterizes the Mâdhyamikas as those who take the âtman to be amûrta, ‘without form’, which, according to the commentaries, means nihsvabhâva, ‘devoid of essence’.18. neti neti (YR ad 32)This apophatic phrase comes first as a litany in the BÄU at the mo­ment of celebrating the âtman. Cf. BÄU II 3, 6: athâta ädeso neti neti/ na hy etasmâd iti nety anyat param asti, ‘Now therefore there is the teaching not this, not this for there is nothing higher than this, that he is not this’, and S ad loc.; also BÄU III 9, 26: sa esa neti nety ätmögrhyo na hi grhyate ’siryo na hi Siryate ’sango na hi sajyate ’sito na vyathate, na risyati, ‘That self is not this, not this. It is incomprehensible, for it is not comprehended. It is indestructible, for it is never destroyed. It is unattached, for it does not attach itself. It is unfettered. It does not suffer. It is not injured’; same text in BÄU IV 2, 4; IV 4, 22; IV 5, 15. See also MäU 7 and ÄS III 26 (which quotes the pratika of BÄU III 9, 26): sa esa neti netîti vyâkhyâ- tam nihnute yatah/ sarvam agrâhyabhâvena hetunâjam prakâsate//, ‘De ce que [le passage scripturaire:] “Il n’est, quant à lui, ni ainsi, ni a in s i...” nie tout ce qui avait été exposé en détail, en invoquant comme raison [son] insaisissabilité, il appert clairement que le [brahman est] non-né’ (tr. Bouy — ‘Since, by stating: “It is not this, it is not that”, [the Sruti] denies what it had elaborately expounded, giving as a reason that [the brahman] is entirely ungraspable, it clearly appears that this [brahman] is unborn’); also ÄS IV 83a, where the Sünyavädins’ position is alluded to by [...] nästi näsßti [...], in the course of referring to various conceptions of the Self {âtman), considered quâ its being or existence. As observed by Änandagiri ad loc., the repetition (ripsd) of nâsti is meant to signify the Void as absolute (âtyantika). Note that the Yogäcäras have accused the Mâdhyamikas of professing nihilism (cf. Bouy ÄS: 295-296). So do the £aivas, as YR demonstrates here. They hold that not only does nihilism amount to an aporia, but also that it has for its corollary the superimposi­tion of a false insentience on the Self. Even though the Mâdhyamikas deny the accusation of nihilism, claiming rather that their doctrine of sûnyatâ is catuskotivinirmuktâ, ‘free from the tetralemma’ — that is, the four alter­native propositions: idam sat, ...asat, ...sadasat, ...na sadasat, ‘X exists’, ‘...does not exist’, ‘...both exists and does not exist’, ‘...neither exists nor does not exist’, Saivas take all this to be mere empty logic."},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"343As stated in the auto-commentary, PH 18 deals with mystical tech­niques alternative to ‘the rigorous disciplines that are prandyama, mudra, bandha, etc.’. Ksemaraja quotes Kallata in the context of the exposition of the saktivikdsa, ‘blossoming of energy’, which he presents as extrane­ous to Pratyabhijna doctrine (iaktisankocadayas tu yady api pratyabhijna- yam na pratipaditah), and as ‘resorting to the sacred tradition* (amnayika), which the context further allows us to identify as the Krama (see PHvf 19, which refers to the Kramasutras). Kallata’s line appears there as an apho­ristic definition of the saktivikdsa, a technique of inner absorption with external expansion of the senses, also called bhairavunudra (bhairavimu- dranupravesayuktya bahih prasaranam), and described as iakter vikasah an- tamigddhdya akramam eva sakalakaranacakravispharanena, ‘The blossom­ing of the energy hidden internally results from the simultaneous opening of the entire wheel of sense-organs’. It is again defined by the Kaksyas- totra cited in the same passage (also quoted in SpN I 11): sarvah iaktii cetasa darsanadyah sve sve vedye yaugapadyena visvak/ ksiptva madhye hata- kastambhabhutas tisthan viivddhdra eko 'vabhasi/ / , ‘Throwing by will all the powers like seeing, etc., simultaneously and on all sides into their respec­tive objects and remaining [unmoved] within, like a gold pillar (hataka- stambha), you [O Siva] alone appear as the foundation of the universe’ (tr. Singh). Later on, the vjtd relates the iaktivikasa to the practices at work in the urdhvakundalini, according to a process requiring ‘the restraint of the prana between the two eyebrows, which [restraint] is accomplished by the energy of the subtle prana which develops gradually through the regulation of the vibrations in the cavities of the nose’ (nasaputaspandakra- monmisatsuksmaprdnasaktya bhrubhedanena; tr. Singh, modified); on the details of this esoteric and complex procedure, see the lengthy exposition of PHvf 18, Singh PH: 41-42,150-152. It is noteworthy that the saktivikd­sa resorts to the saktopaya (Singh PH: 30), inasmuch as the exposition of PS 41-46 is mainly made from this viewpoint. Therefore, Kallata’s aphoristic statement means that the ‘blossoming of energy’ takes place by means of the transformation of extroverted into introverted consciousness, at the very moment that consciousness turns outward, simultaneously opening all the sense-organs; a paradoxical practice that consists in reaching the greatest interiorization at the moment of, and through, the widest exter- nalization.The hemistich quoted here by YR is not found in the Spandakarika, if in­deed the text is to be attributed to Kallata at all: according to some, among whom Bhaskara (SSva I 4-5: 2-3), and Utpalavaisnava (SpP, 7th liminary verse), Kallata is the author of the SpK, whereas Ksemaraja ($SV II 4-7) ascribes the authorship of the SpK to Vasugupta (on this question, see Dy- czkowski SpK: 21-24, and Sanderson 2007: 405-407, who concludes in19. Kallata (YR ad 42)"},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"344APPENDIXfavor of Kallata’s authorship). Nor is the hemistich found in Kallata’s vrtti to the Spandakarika — a brief gloss, which he himself calls Spandasarvasva in his first concluding stanza. According to AG (IPW , vol. II: 30), Kallata is also the author of two commentaries on the Ss, the Tattvdrthacintamani [TAC] and the Madhuvahinl, of which the TAC is most often referred to and quoted (see Sanderson 2007: 405, n. 578). From all those quotes, it ap­pears that the TAC had a section dealing with the movement and spiritual properties of breath; cf. TA X 187-227, and probably TA XXVIII 338-340, on which JR comments by citing three sutras (among which: prak samvit prane parinata, also quoted in TAV III 141, V 6, V 44—48a, XV 303, XVII 85, XXVIII 293, 338-339), which he ascribes to Kallata, although with­out giving a source. It appears also that the TAC dealt with a peculiar method of animal sacrifice involving the withdrawal and absorption by the officiant of the animal’s breath, referred to in TA XVI 36-45 and in Ksemaraja’s NTU XX 27ff. (vol. I: 226), where the teaching of this tech­nique is ascribed to Kallata’s TAC. The TAC seems also to have been famous for its exposition of the mystical practice of tutipata, the ‘fall of the mo­ment’. It is indirectly referred to by TA X 208 (vol. V: 2026), which names Kallata, while JR quotes from TAC: tutipate sarvajnatadayah; SpP 22 [ = ad I 22]: 31, quotes it more extensively, although not referring explicitly to TAC: tutipate sarvajnatvasarvakartrtvasarvesitadayah/ esa ca gurupadeie- nadarat pariksyah, ‘It is during the “fall of the moment” that omniscience, omnipotence and mastery of all things, etc., (become clearly manifest) and (so) that should be examined with reverence in accord with the Master’s teachings’ (tr. Dyczkowski SpK: 159, modified); same quote in PTV 5-9a (Gnoli PTV: 61). Let us note that Utpalavaisnava takes Kallata, whom he considers to be the author of the SpK, to be the author of two other works: the Tattvavicara and the Svasvabhavasambodha, from which he quotes (in SpP 1: 9, and SpP 30 [= II 4a]: 38-39, for the former; in SpP 1: 7-8, for the latter). For lack of other clues, we may only advance the hypoth­esis that the line from Kallata quoted by YR and Ksemaraja may belong to the TAC, insofar as the verse that SpP 21 [= I 21], p. 30, draws from the TAC agrees with the context in which the PHvj (ad 18: 98, in Singh ed.) quotes that same line of Kallata, namely the description of mystical techniques of inner absorption responding to the Krama doctrine. This is this verse from the TAC: ittbam tattadanalpamobadalanaprdptasvarupodayo yogi nityam andtmabhdvavirahat svatmasthito nirvrtab/ drsyadrastprivekavid bhavapadavyapi vimuktamayo vyutthane ’pi samadhibbag bhavati san moksa- iriyah karanam//, ‘Thus, blissful is the yogin who, cutting through each of the many [forms of] ignorance, has attained the dawning of his own nature.

He delights in contemplation (samàdhi) even when he rises from [his meditation] (vyutthdna), and so is the fount of the glory of true liberation* (tr. Dyczkowski SpK: 158, modified). Similarly, as we have seen, PHvj* 18 quotes Kallata in order to support its definition of the bhai- ravîmudrâ, a Krama practice, and PH 19 describes the great yogin whose samddhi-state persists even in vyutthàna, i.e., even when he rises from his meditation, which is exactly the purport of the TÀC quoted above. More­over, Utpalavaisnava*s SpP 43 [ = III 11] might offer a clue as to whether the line of Kallata (quoted in YR ad 42 and in PHvj* 18) that deals with the practice of the bhairavvmudrd should be ascribed to the TÀC. In ef­fect, Utpalavaisnava identifies the yogin’s state described in SpK III 11 as the vikàsavfttiy ‘process of expansion*, in other words as the bhairavï- mudrâ or saktivikdsa described also in PHvj* 18 and SpN 111. In support of his interpretation, Utpalavaisnava not only quotes the passage of the Kaksyastotra that is also quoted in PHvj* 18 and SpN 1 11, but he explicitly refers to the TÀC as a text describing the same state (st/utz), which is called there ‘secret mudrd* (rahasyamudrd): yd caisd sthitih saiva tattvdrthacintd- manau rahasyamudrety ukta. In addition, one should consider Ksemaraja’s assertion (SpN 11:6) according to which his first two interpretations of éakticakravibhavaprabhava (in SpK 1 1) [the first taking the saktis to be the twelve Kàlîs of the Wheel of energies; the second re-establishing the abso­lute sovereignty of the Lord] agree with the very terms of Kallata*s yrttz: tad uktam snbhattakallatena vijndnadehdtmakasya sakticakraisvaryasya ut- pattihetutvam/ ity etad vrttyaksardndm atra vydkhyddvaye 'py anurûpyamy ‘The revered Kallata has said: “It is he, whose soul and substance are [nothing but] consciousness, who has [therefore] mastery of the Wheel of energies, who is the cause of the production [of the universe]**. The two interpretations given here [by me] agree with the wording of his gloss*; cf. Kallata’s vrtd ad SpK 1 1 quoted above, where Siva is said to be ‘the cause of the generation of the Wheel of energies*, and his Tattvavicdra quoted in SpP 1: 9: saktiprasarasahkocanibaddhdv udayavyayau/ yasydtmd sa sivo jneyah sarvabhdvapravartakah//) ‘[All things] arise and fall away in con­sonance with the extension and withdrawal of [Siva*s] power.

Ill: 629). Similarly, TAV IV 13, vol. Ill: 629: sa eva hi mahatmanam dehadyalocanena yatha- yathamabhydsatiiaydt vikalpaiuddhim adadhanah, param kastham upagatah san, bhavanatmakatdm yayat, yenasphutam api samvidrupam sphutatam asa- dayet//, ‘Indeed, after [reasoning] has effected the purification of the thought constructs (vikalpasuddhi) through one or another of the ways of reaching the end of the stage of repeated practice — [in other words] by studying the revered great Masters’ [teachings] concerning the body, etc. — [that reasoning,] thereby reaching its ultimate limit, becomes bhavana, by which [process] what was unclear, even though of the form of con­sciousness, reaches clarity’. This passage of JR’s commentary sheds light on the organization of PS 39-41, for ‘the revered great Masters’ [teach­ings] concerning the body, etc.’ alludes to the eradication of the double error expounded in PS 39-40; once that process of eradication is com­plete (that is, when reasoning has reached its ultimate limit, annulling all idea of difference), that certitude becomes bhavana (the m atter at issue in PS 41), the fulgurating awareness of one’s own essence as consciousness. Thus is formulated the experience that transforms the yogin into a jivan- mvkta (YR ad 39): ‘I alone manifest myself as the Self of the universe’. See also the definition of bhavana given by SpN I I 6-7: 52-53, quoting the SvT: [...] sarvam sivasaktimayam smaret [v.l. (KSTS 44) sarvam iivamayam smaret] (SvT VII 244b) / / [...] jivann eva vimukto ’sauyasyeyam [v.l. (KSTS 44)yasyaisa] bhavana sada/yah sivam bhavayen nityam na kalah kalayet tu tarn [v.l.

[...] He becomes liberated, even in this life, who gives himself over once and for all to that realization (bhavana), for time could not act on him who would realize (bhavayet) Siva continously’. Thus bhavana is defined as the ‘realization that everything is made of Siva and Sakti’, that is, as per­fect knowledge: tad eva paramam jhanam bhavandmayam isyate, ‘Supreme knowledge consists of bhavana’ (quoted in TAV IV 14, vol. Ill: 630). As such, bhavana is characterized as instrumental in attaining the state of jl- vanmukti. Also Silbum 1981: 191; Chenet 1987, and 1998-1999, vol.

Almost all Sarada MSS agree with the KSTS, except the original reading of N, which was then corrected by a second hand. Therefore, it seems possible that aksaya was a Kashmirian variant in this passage of the Gita. This is also corroborated by the fact that the distribution of the variants seems somewhat unusual compared to other cases, which may be explicable if one assumes that some scribes, per­haps mostly of non-Kashmirian origin, wrote down the passage relying on their memory rather than on their exemplar. However, we have not been able to confirm the Kashmirian provenance of this variant with parallels. For Abhinavagupta does not gloss this word in his Gitdrthasajngrahay and the variant does not appear in the critical edition of the Mahabharatay nor in Schrader BhG. Whatever is the case, it is quite certain that Yogaraja’s text had aksayam.*p. 82,1. 4:ajadapramatrsiddhav KSTS: naresvaraviveke Codd Although the identification of the work referred to by the manuscript is problematic (see our notes to the translation), the KSTS’s conjecture does not seem justified to us.p. 82,1. 7:niruddha KSTS PiP2NS: nibaddha WI: ont the whole line P3P4Since all other citations of this passage have niruddha (see notes to thetranslation), we have kept the KSTS’s reading.*p. 83,1. 13-14:gaganataya tathava£isyate KSTS P ^ P2P3 S: gaganataya tatha viSisyate P4* gaganataya tatha tatha visisyate WI: gaganataya tatha tathavasisyate"},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"350SANSKRIT TEXTP i1*- gaganatathavaSisyate NWe have accepted the reading of P4, for avasisyate does not yield good sense. The confusion of a and i is unexceptional. Since W and I have usually secondary readings, we have adopted a single tathd, attested by all the other manuscripts.

Our best MSS, S, N (before a secondary correction) and P3, all attest that the shorter reading is authentic; their readings differ only on minor points: N omits the priva­tive prefix, while P3 misses the anusvara. The KSTS agrees with the group of manuscripts we have rejected elsewhere as secondary: I and W. Fur­thermore, the shorter version fits the context much better, for the passage expounds the ignorance of the individual when he identifies himself with what he is not, i.e., when he considers himself the performer of a sacrifice. The original expression was perhaps expanded first as a marginal note and then came to be included in the text. This is not surprising, given that a similar sequence of words and ideas can be found in Abhinavagupta’s text itself, see karika 39.*p. 146,1. 15:bhattaSriviravamanakah KSTS: bhattasriviravamanah W P1P3P4S: [bra]- Sriviravamanah P2: bhattaviravamanah IGiven the manuscript evidence, we accept the form of this proper name without the suffix -ka.

First of all, we have found no other occurrence of 240 bhuvanas instead of the standard 224, and it is unlikely that Yogaraja should use an obscure number of bhuvanas in this gloss. The Malinivijayottara, which differs from other texts on this point, also has only 118. Although the relevant folio is missing in our copy of N, two of our best manuscripts, S and P3, both of them in £arada, have the number 224. The corruption is explicable, since the two words are quite similar. However, it is curious that the editors of the KSTS preferred 240.

We can infer their existence from the occasional footnotes referring to manuscripts designated as Ka, Kha, Ga and Gha. Judging from the very small number of variants given, they were probably not fully collated. However, sometimes they provide us with important variants of manuscripts that are probably no longer in existence or no longer accessible.Other manuscripts we have been able to consult include Sarada and Devanagari ones described below. Since we have not prepared a critical edition, we have not attempted to define their relation to each other or to a supposed archetype. Not surprisingly, Devanagari manuscripts show many errors and corruptions, while the Sarada manuscripts tend to be more correct. None of these manuscripts is identical with any of those used for the KSTS edition and all of them are independent witnesses, there are no identifiable apographs. Two manuscripts, W and I, share readings against all the others several times, which shows that they may form a subgroup (W being generally more corrupt than I).1.
