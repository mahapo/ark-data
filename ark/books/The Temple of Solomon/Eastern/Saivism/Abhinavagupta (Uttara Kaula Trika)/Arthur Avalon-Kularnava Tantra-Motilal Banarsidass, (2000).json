Tantra seeks to synthesize the monism of the Advaita with the dualism of the Samkhya, enrich Jnana with the rasa of Bhakti, join Nature to her Lord in the person of the human individual, harmonize the claims of the Spirit with the rights of Matter. It recovers the lost heritage of the ancient Veda which lays emphasis upon the commonalty of man, Nature and God and the equality of status between Mother Earth and Father Heaven. The principle of Tantra is to reject nothing that God has created, to utilize every means to raise the human consciousness to the Divine. Unlike many of the older systems Tantra is highly rational in its approach; it asks for no faith in advance. It is a self-verifying science of the development of natural energies into their supernatural terms leading to a cosmic enjoyment of life in a spiritual consciousness. In a word it is the highway of mukti and bhukti in the highest sense. The Kularnava is an important text in one of the tradi-tions of Tantra with a pronouncedly practical bent of thought. It calls upon man to wake up to the rare privilege that has been given to him, e.g. human birth in which the being becomes conscious of himself and is offered a choice: a choice between stagnation and rapid progression towards his Godhead. He is warned of the consequences of losing himself in the rounds of transient excitements and pleasures He is also put on guard against the many pseudo-paths that abound in this world. He is"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"viii PREFACE asked to purify himself and told how to do it. In un-ambiguous terms he is told that a wine-drinker is different from the drinkers of ecstasy; the union of delight is between the ascending Sakti and the presiding Lord above, and not between man and woman. In issuing these warnings, the adepts of the Tantra would seem to have anticipated the modern turn of mixing up sex with spirituality. It is a pity that a text like this has not received adequate publicity in the west where tantra-enthusiasts are on the wrong track. The Kulanarva prescribes the modes of preparation for the high quest; it draws upon ethics, religion, philosophy, yoga to elevate human life gradually to the level of godly life. It comprehends the multiple personality of man and provides for the healthy growth of his mental faculties, purification of his emotions and passions, orientation of his physical faculties through ritual, japa, mantra and upasana. Who is fit for the path of Tantra? Who is competent to guide the novice on the double-edged razor path? What is the responsibility of a Guru to a disciple? These and other relevant questions are raised and answered in a satisfying manner. An attempt has been made in the following selections to present such contents as are eminently helpful to the needs of the awakened man of today. Portions relating to rituals, technicalities of special types of japa, etc. have been kept out of the treatment so as not to tax the aspi-rant of the present times who has little time or energies to devote himself to those practices, especially when it is possible to achieve the same results by more psychological means suited to the modern age and so elegantly presen-ted in this text. Definitions of most of the important concepts and terms in the Tantra Sastra, as given in the text, will be found highly educative. M. P.

It enjoys a great reputation amongst works of its class and as such is constantly cited as an authority. The Chapters of the Text here published number seventeen and the verses total 2058 according as there are included or not vv. 123-144 in the tenth Chapter. The Colophon however states that the portion here printed is only the fifth part of the whole Tantra consisting of 1,25,000 verses. Thus the Colophon of the first Chapter runs - \"End of the first Chapter being the first portion of the fifth part entitled Urdhvamnaya Tantra of the great Mystery and most excellent among Agamas containing, 1,25,000 verses entitled the Kularnava Tantra.\" If this statement be correct I have not on enquiry been able to discover the whole work. Every Ms. which I have come across contains the seventeen Chapters only here printed. Either then the rest of the book is lost or possibly exists under some different names. The Kaulavali which is a compendium by Jnanananda Paramhamsa quotes long passages as from the Kularnava which do not occur in any of the texts consulted in the preparation of the present volume. The work has been already twice printed and therefore would not in the ordinary course have found place in these texts according to the original design of the publi-cation. It was found however that the previous editions of this and other Tantras were in general so incorrect that the present edition is"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"4 KULARNAVA TANTRA not unnecessary. The former editions were those of Rasik Mohana Chattopadhyaya and of Pandit Jivananda Vidyasagara. The former published at Calcutta the Tantrasara and Tantras in parts, the first of which appeared in the Bengali year 1285 (1878-79) and the edition of the latter was published at the same place in the year 1882. In Rasik Mohana Chattopadhyaya's and Pandit Jivananda's edition of the Kularnava there are twenty-one verses at the end of the Tenth Chapter which do not occur in any of the four Mss. which have been consulted. These have been printed. Both these editions seem to have been based on a single Ms. without any attempt to correct obvious errors in the text. In the preparation of the present texts four Mss. have been consulted lettered and the texts above mentioned which are based on a Ms. which may be identified as Of these is the property of Pandit Amulya Charana Vidya-bhushana. belongs to the Rajshahi College. and have been lent by the Varendra Anusan-dhana Samiti of which I have the honour to be a member.

It is however not claimed for the present edition that every difficult passage has been made clear but the obscurities have been so considerably reduced as to render the present edition a practical working text. Another inducement for its publication was the"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 5 fact that there is in hand an English translation of the present work and if it is found possible to publish this the Sanskrit-knowing reader can compare the English translation with the Text on which it is based. For this reason the size of the present edition of the Text is that of the proposed translation, which, if published, will be the same format as the Mahanirvana. The Kularnava is worthy of a close study-by those who would understand the tenets and practices of the School of which it is a Shastra. Having however regard to the fact that it is hoped to publish a translation of the entire text I have not thought it necessary to give such a detailed analysis of the Tantra as in the absence of such a translation it would have deserved. I therefore only here give such a summary as under the circumstances stated seems sufficient. The first chapter opens with some fine verses (vv. 1-121). Devi tells Shiva of how men are suffering and asks the means whereby they may be liberated. Ishvara in reply speaks of the Brahman and of the creatures who encircled by Maya are like sparks of fire parts of him. Of these man is the greatest. He is a self-killer who having attained man's estate yet seeks not his true good. \"He who does not cure himself of the disease of Hell what will he do when he yet suffering from such disease goes to a place where there is no medicament?\" (v. 24). The Lord then dwells on the transitoriness of life and of all things therein. \"Prosperity is like a dream, youth is like a flower. Life is seen and is then gone like lightning. How can anyone who knows this yet remain content?\" (v 30). Moreover the world is full of evils which arise"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"6  KULARNAVA TANTRA from attachment (v 55). Shiva says \"Oh Beloved to sleep, to copulate, to eat and other such func-tions are common to all animals. Man alone is possessed of knowledge. He who is devoid of it is a beast\" (v 69). Shun him who is addicted to the pleasures of the world and who yet boasts Brahman knowledge. There are other impostors also. Liberation is not to be got by merely smearing oneself with ashes, feeding on husks and water, exposure to heat and cold and the like. \"Donkeys and other animals go about naked. Are they therefore Yogins?\" (vv 79-86). No: then gain true knowledge and avoid idle talk. What is the use of Vedas, Agamas and Puranas if one knows not the supreme object of life - (v 89)? \"Renowned men dispute among themselves - some saying the truth is ahead and some that it is behind, others again say it is on either side. Some say it is like this, others like that \"(v 99). All such bewilder themselves with Scriptures and talk. They lack realization (Pratyakshagrahanam) (v 100). The Sastras are numberless: one should master their essential truth and then put them aside just as he who seeks the grain of paddy throws away the husk and straw (v 103). Real knowledge alone liberates. Ritual and austerities are needful only so long as the Real and the true are not known (v 113). Shiva concludes \"What is the use of many words? It is Kuladharma which liberates. Beloved, I have spoken to Thee in brief of the creature and how he should live\" (v 121). Chapter II deals with the greatness of Kula-dharma which Shiva has extracted after churning the great ocean of the Vedas and"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 7 Agamas (v 10) and which excels all others as the light of the Sun surpasses that of the firefly (v 16). The Yogi cannot enjoy; and he who enjoys cannot know Yoga but in Kuladharma there is both Bhoga and Yoga (v 23). But Kaula know-ledge can only be gained by one whose mind is pure and who has controlled his senses (v 33). In v 84-85 Shiva says that the six philosophies are the six limbs of Kula. The Kaula Shastras are based on Veda. \"Tasmat vedatmakam shastrang vidhi kaulatmakang priye (v 85).\" Many however being ignorant of the traditional teaching of Kuladharma cheat people by their false know-ledge (v 116). Moreover the Kula path is full of dangers (v 122). So also the Buddhist Vajrayana is (I may add) compared to a hollow bamboo in which a serpent is placed. It must go up at peril of falling down. He who fails on this path is likely to go to Hell. The Pashu should there-fore avoid this method (v 124). Vv 140, 141 cite authorities from Shruti (Rigveda) in support of the doctrine taught. The third Chapter treats of the Paraprasada mantra that is Hamsah which, as the great Cosmic Breath, pervades the world, opening (v 4) with the assertion that Vedas, Puranas and other Shastras may be preached abroad; whereas the Shaiva and Shakta Agamas are mysteries (v 4). V 10 refers to the four Amnayas or traditions, some portions of which appear in the Tantra Shastras. Urddhvamnaya is not to be learnt by study of the Shastras but from its masters (v30). Chapter IV which is a difficult one deals with Mahashodhanyasa. From it as well as other parts of the work may be learnt how rigorous"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"8 KULARNAVA TANTRA the Sadhana is which is required of those who are entitled to participate in the Kaula rites. The fifth Chapter treats of the greatness of Kula. It contains a description of the Kaula substances; the making of wine; the various kinds of wine; its use as Chitta-shodhana-sadhana so that the mind may become Bramagah. V 48 enumerates the fundamental doctrines of this school that \"success is attained by those very things which lead to fall\" (Yaireva pata-nang dravyaih siddhistaireva chodita). V 50 refers to animal sacrifice: and vv 67, 68 to the necessity of wine and meat in the various forms of worship including the Buddha. V 90 Says \"As soma has been ordained a Brahmana should drink;\" which other Tantras are said to deny. If this however be done in the ordinary animal way even a Vira will go to Hell (v. 93). Nectar drinking is the union of Kundali Shakti with the Moonchit (Chichchandra). Others are but wine drinkers (vv. 107-108). The true meat eater is he who has merged his Chitta in the Supreme (v. 109). He who controls his senses and unites them with Atma is a fish-eater. The rest do but kill animals (v. 110). True sexual union is the union of Para Shakti that is Kundali with Atma; others do but have carnal connection with women (vv 111, 112). The sixth Chapter deals with the characteris-tics of the worshipper, of worship and purifi-cation of Kaula substances. Vv 37-46 deal with the lunar, solar, fiery Kalas orginating from the vowels, the consonants Ka-kha to Tha-da and the Yavarga respectively; the Kalas of Kavarga and Chavarga, Tavarga, Thavarga, Pavarga and Yavarga and Shavarga. Then follow several"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 9 mantras. Vv 63-67 give the Gurus. Yantra is defined in vv 85-86. Chapter VII describes worship of Vatuka, Shakti and others. In vv. 42-44 the eight kinds of Kula Shakti are enumerated. Vv. 70-75 are noteworthy for they refer to the 36 Shaiva Tattvas and not the Sangkhyan 24 thereby denoting the connection of this Tantra with the former philosophical Darshana. V. 96 prohibits drinking in excess so as to produce unsteadiness of mind. V. 99 contains the oft quoted verse \"Drink and drink again\" which some erro-neously suppose is an invitation to drunkenness: notwithstanding the previous injunction and the warning that he who disobeys it is likely to go to Hell. The verse refers to Yoga \"drinking.\" Chapter VIII deals with the Chakra and the various forms of Bliss. The Sadhaka passes through these from Arambha to Praudhanta in which state the Chakra is held to Unmana and then to Tata. In Praudhanta everything which is done is an offering to Bhairava (v. 59). Unmana is the state in which the Sadhaka is no longer affected and Tata is the very self of the Supreme Mantra (vv. 83-84), The states up to Praudhanta are waking (Jagrat). Unmana is is dreaming (Svapna). Anavastha is dreamless sleep (Sushupti). The seventh Ullasa is Libera-tion (vv. 94, 95). (Turiyavastha). Yoga is treated of in Chapter IX. Advaita doctrine in its form Aham Brahmasmi is accep-ted (v. 32). Jiva is Shiva and Shiva Jiva: the only difference is that one is in bondage and the other not (v. 42). A noteworthy passage which explains some acts which disconcert others say \"the Kulayogi behaves in such a way that men"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"10 KULARNAVA TANTRA laugh at him and reproach and revile and shun him\" (v. 4). But himself doing acts of kindness to all, he roams the earth (v. 75). Kaulika. is denned in v. 88. \"Oh Thou of beautiful eyes I dwell not in Kailasa or in Meru or in Mandara but I am wherever the knowers of Kula are \" (v. 94.). The tenth Chapter treats of worship on special days and the eleventh with the rules of Kulachara which should be carefully concealed (v. 84). The twelfth Chapter treats of the Paduka Mantra. V. 58 prohibits discussion with Atheists or unbelievers in Veda (Nastika). The subject of the Guru is dealt with at some length. The next Chapter (XIII) continues the subject of Guru (v. 41) and disciple (vv. 1-40) and their qualifi-cations. Amongst other defective persons, men who are lewd, given to drink and stupid are to be rejected. The Guru should realise that he is inseparate (avichhinna) that is one with the Brahman which pervades the whole universe (vv. 67-68). V. 82 refers to the Lingas in the bodily centres and v. 90 gives the eight bonds (Pasha) which bind the Pashu. The Guru is he who by destroying the pleasures of the senses gives Brahman-Bliss (v. 97). Chapter XIV deals with the testing (Pariksha) of the qualifications of Guru and disciple; and Chapter XV treats of Purashcharana and other matters. Pranayama is dealt with (v. 35 et seq). Vv. 65-69 mention the \"defects\" of Mantras and vv. 71-72 state the purificatory rites which remove them. The various kinds of Mantras, Siddha, Sadhya and the like are described. V. 96 classifies the letters according to the Mahabhutas. When doing Japa a man should control his"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 11 animal propensites, eat sparingly, live hardly, cultivate faith and devotion and fix his mind and heart solely on \"That\" (vv. 110-113). Chapter XVI deals with rites done for the attainment of various objects of desire. Chapter XVII gives the meaning of a large number of words such as Guru, Acharya, Deshika and so forth and con-tains a Dhyana of the Guru. At the end of the seventeenth Chapter there is a remarkable passage (v. 103) prohibiting (ordinary persons) from reading the portions of this work dealing with Asavollasa. This prohibition doubtless has been prompted by the desire that such per-sons should not be led astray and take to practices which might lead to their moral ruin. For it is to be noted that according to the Shastra the Rahasyapuja is not for all and any but for such whom the Guru may consider qualified and have been duly initiated. Except under the conditions prescribed the Sadhana with wine and so forth is prohibited and its accomplish-ment is admittedly harmful. But under the conditions prescribed this Sadhana is said to be the practical application of the principles of Advaitavada which the Agamas of this school teach.

Written in the simplest possible style - as indeed all the great agamas are - with telling metaphors and imagery, incorporating many of the gnomic passages in the Tantras, this work of seventeen chapters consists of a little over two thousand verses ranging over a wide variety of topics but always stressing the practical side of the agamic wisdom and calling attention to the urgency of following it in this very life. The text opens with a question by the Devi, the compassionate Mother of the universe,to Her * Ullasa 1 † Of the many derivations of the word kaula, the following cited by Bhaskara Raya (in his celebrated commentary on the Lalita) seems to us the most happy: kulam Saktiriti proktam, akulam Siva ucyate; kule akulasya sambandhah kaulamityabhidiyate. Kula, Shakti; Akula, Shiva; the relation of Akula with Kula i.e. the harmoni-ous relation of Shiva and Shakti is Kaula.

The Purana declares that the very gods have to come down on earth and embody * For man, below the god, above the brute, Is given the calm reason as his guide ; He is not driven by an unthinking will As are actions of the bird and beast; He is not moved by stark Necessity Like the senseless motion of inconscient things.

It is only on this earth - and that too in a human body endowed with a soul - that one can choose one's line of development and take the means to progress accordingly. It is the articulate soul of man that holds the impulse to progress and gives the direction that makes for his superiority over other orders in creation. But not all are aware of the precious oppor-tunity afforded by this human birth which is verily the ladder to liberation, sopanabhuta moksasya. The value of the human body which is the base for progress and realisation is not fully recognised.

Handed down from mouth to mouth in the long stretch of holy tradition, the Doctrine of Kaula is the highest and the most guarded from the profane and the unqualified.

The second, higher than the first, is the Vaishnava path in which devotion to the Lord, bhakti, plays a greater role than works and is meant for a higher competence. Third, the Shaiva which is more a path of meditation and jnana, knowledge, than anything else. These three orders or successive stages of discipline are meant for the ordinary category of seekers, without any special qualification, the pasu, creature who is bound by the bonds of existence, pasa. The fourth is the Dakshina, the path where karma, bhakti, jnana are skilfully harmonised and synthesised; the fruits of the first three are organised and conserved. Higher than the Dakshina is the Varna, the reverse path where the natural turn outwards, pravritti, is turned inward, nivritti, to the source of all and every-thing in creation is looked upon and used as the means for the return to the One Consciousness that bases all and governs all.

Still higher than Vama is the Siddhanta, the stage or path where things are finally determined as to their real nature and the direction of one's own goal and the knowledge so arrived at is prepared to be embodied in all the parts of the being and in all one's consciousness. This stage and the one that succeeds, the last, is for the highest type of the seeker, the divya, the godly type, who is superbly fitted to tread the highest path in a consciousness that is rapidly nearing the divine Consciousness itself. This highest of all is the Kaula, the most secret, the most preeminent Path. There is nothing higher than the Kaula which is the essence of all essences, the very Shiva, the Holy Doctrine that has come down heard from ear to ear. It has been extracted from the Ocean of the Vedas and Agamas with the churning rod of Jnana by Shiva himself who knows the essence of all. Into this Kula-dharma lead all other paths. As the footprints of all animals get lost in the footprint of the elephant so do all philosophies get absorbed in this Doctrine. No doctrine, no path can really compare with this Sun of Kaula.

Even the Gods of the higher worlds like Indra, Rudra, Brahma follow this path of Harmony of Shiva-Shakti, Pure Consciousness and manifesting Power, what to speak of men! So, should you aspire for Fulfilment, give up all other creeds, all other ways, and take to the Kula. But the Kula is not to be had by any one and every one. There are certain conditions to be ready before the truth of the Kula could be revealed. One must have matured in mind and nature as a result of study and discipline under-gone in the previous lives. Only to such a person does the Knowledge dawn without being taught and explained by others. For one's mind, one's inclination and proclivity depend entirely upon what has gone before, what has been prepared in the past births. According to that preparation, that evolution, forms the readiness of man. External instruction is of little avail. The second factor is the degree of purification and subtilisation of consciousness that one has under-gone as a result of japa, repetition of sacred mantras of whatever persuasion.* Third, the extent to which one is freed from the deforming elements of Ignorance and Ego as a combined * Shaivite, Vaishnavite, Shakta, Ganapatya, Saura etc."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"GLORY OF KULA-DHARMA 33 result of previous austerity, self-giving, sacri-fice, repetition of holy names, observances and similar acts aimed at ridding oneself of animal propensities and the like.

Thus to one of purified consciousness, calm, active in the ways of the spirit, devoted intensely to the Lord and His Revelation of the Kula, of high faith, humility, cheerfulness, dedicated in life to Truth and obedient to the commands of the Guru, does the Kula Knowledge reveal itself. It is not attained by the undeserving nor does it stay with them. The Guru should first awaken the disciple, prepare him and then reveal this high Knowledge productive of the highest good for both, and effective for immediate liberation in this very birth. Alone by itself, unaccompanied by ritual, observances of aSramas, the Kula-Dharma is capable of leading to the final Release. Even if you lack the full knowledge of this Doctrine, faith and dedication to it is enough to deliver. Break the Kuladharma, it will break you; guard it, it will guard you; adore it, revere it, it will show you the same conside-ration. The right attitude for the seeker of the Truth of this lofty Path is: ' Let my people look askance; let my wife and children forsake me; let men deride; let the kings punish; but I shall be steadfast, O Supreme Deity, I shall serve and ever serve Thee with mind, speech, body and act, I shall not leave Thy Law.'

These comprise, in the Kaulachara, madya, wine, mamsa, meat, matsya, fish, mudra, grain, maithuna, woman, well known as the Five M's, panca makaras (each item beginning with ma). The Sastra prescribes in meticulous detail, the types of vessels to be used on different occasions, the metal or substance of which they are made, their dimensions; the several kinds of grain, the proportion of their mixing and the manner of their cooking; the preparation of different kinds of wine from different substances according to different formulas. Wine here is primarily used as an agent for the release of the senses from their engrossment in their outer objects. The surface faculties and sensibilities constantly exposed to the shocks and occupations of every-day life are temporarily suspended and the deeper, the larger, the subliminal ranges of consciousness are opened up making it easier for the practicant to get a hold in the inner recesses and work for the culture and the purifi-cation of the being.

The several kinds of meat are also specified. But it is made clear that meat is to be used only for the purposes of this ritual. No creature shall be harmed for one's own sake, one's own enjoy-ment. All depends upon the purpose; not even a blade of grass shall be cut without a worthy purpose. What is called sin becomes a merit if it is done for a higher purpose even as what is considered uplifting becomes a force for binding if done in disregard of the higher Truth. Rightly used, rightly directed, the very means of fall become the means for rise, yaireva patanam dravyaih siddhistaireva. What is impor-tant is the spirit in which things are used, the ceremonies conducted and worship offered; it is the inner consecration and not the outer ritual that is paramount; they are beloved of the Gods who are dedicated in the inner sacrifice, antaryaga-nistha priyah. It is when these ingredients are consecrated and offered with devotion that there stirs in the heart of the sadhaka, the supreme form of the Lord and His Spouse in the figure of Sat-Chit-Ananda. This Bliss experienced within is not seizable by thought or speech. In this condition there is as it were an invasion, a possession, by the Dynamic Shiva, Bhairava, and there ensues an equality of eye towards all.

Wine is not to be taken as wine nor flesh as flesh; nor is it permissible to partake in the ceremonies as a mere human animal ridden with greed and desire. The Wine is the Shakti, the Divine Dynamism, Flesh the Shiva, the Divine Substance, and he who partakes is none other than Bhairava himself, the Divine Enjoyer. The bliss, Ananda that arises when all these three are fused in the consciousness of the practicant is real release, moksa. Ananda is the intimate form of Brahman and it is there installed in each individual body; wine brings out, releases into manifestation this indwelling Bliss. This is the reason why yogins take in the sanctified wine. There are conditions to be fulfilled before one is fit to take this wine. One must be free from all doubt, free from fear, brave of spirit, above dualities, above curiosity, one must have arrived at a definite and conclusive understand-ing of the wisdom of the Scripture. In such a person alone the partaking of wine, processed and sanctified by the charge of the Mantra, awakens the sense of godhood which unties the knots of life. To be otherwise, to do otherwise, is simply to be drunk.

He verily sins who drinks out of desire. Wine is to be taken for the flashing of the meaning of the Mantra and for the concentration of the mind and for the removal of the bonds of birth. He sins who takes to wine and the like for pleasure. Wine, says another Tantra, should be taken only as long as the mind remains merged in the Deity (yavat syan manolayah). The Mahanirvana lays it down that wine is to be taken only as long as the mind is not shaken and the sight is not affected. To drink more is to drink animally. Completely free from greed or desire in yourself, with love make the Deity partake, prasayet, make Her drink, not drink it yourself. Partaking of these ingredients, says the Tantra, at any other time except on this holy occasion of dedication and worship is condemnable. Then, in a significant passage, the text declares that just as the partaking of Soma is enjoined upon the Wise in the Sacrifices of the Veda, so is Wine to be partaken on these occasions (of worship), Wine that gives both bliss and release. Now, Soma in the Vedic context means, as all know, not merely the juice extracted from the plant of that name. It is that only externally. The sap that is extrac-ted from the plant and offered to the God is only a symbol and an outer figure for the delight of all life-experience distilled by the soul of the Yajamana. and offered to the Divine for its acceptance as the acme of its consecration.

The outer substance is merely a supporting figure, an occasion and impulsion to the inner experi-ence. This will be still more clear a little further on. The wine, says the Tantra, is not to be drunk in the manner of the animal drinking, paSupana vidhau. Unless the Dynamic Lord is invoked, worshipped and the dedication is sanctified by the prescribed ritual of Mantras which includes their repetition, invocation of the Deities presiding over them, identification of oneself with them and the merging of oneself in their rhythms - a too elaborate and exhaus-tive preliminary, one should think, for the mere pleasure of a drink! - unless the Feet of the Supreme Guru are invoked and duly worship-ped, unless the science of the Divine worship is thoroughly known, one has no right to partici-pate in this ritual. To hell he goes who dares to infringe these conditions and seeks to enjoy the wine. Such a sinner, libertine that he is, shall be shunned. For him there is fulfilment neither here nor there. Drinking of wine that is not sanctified is as reprehensible as rape. One whose being is overcome by intoxica-tion is aware of nothing; for him there is no meditation, no tapas, no worship, no dharma, no activity of merit, no good, no Guru, no thought of his self; he cannot be a votary of this path; addicted only to sense-enjoyment he, verily, falls.

In a crowning peroration of memorable import, the Kularnava declares unequivocally: From the Muladhara at the base go up again and again to the Brahmarandhra at the crown; bliss issues out of this meet of the Kundali Shakti and the Moon of Pure-Consciousness. What flows from this Lotus in the supreme Ether above is the wine, this is the real wine to be tasted by man; what is drunk otherwise is only liquor. The animal that is killed is the notion of good and bad, merit and demerit, the animal of duality which is cut asunder by the knower of yoga with the sword of knowledge. And the consciousness so freed is merged in the supreme. This is the true eating of meat. The host of the senses must be brought under the mind's control and yoked to the self; this is the true eating of fish. The others merely hurt the creatures. And the woman to be waited upon is none other than the inner Shakti that is lying asleep in the ordinary animal man and is awake in the Kaula.* This is the 'Shakti' to be served, attended to. The rush of Ananda that ensues on the meeting of this Divine Pair, the Supreme Shakti and the Supreme Self, the Lord that waits above, that is the real maithuna, the final ma.

Fish (matsya) are the two fishes moving in Ganga and Yamuna i.e. the two currents of breath, expiration and inspiration, constantly moving in Ida and the Pingala; they are eaten i.e. controlled by psycho-physical disciplines like Pranayama; or it means refined knowledge by which through the feeling or ' Mine' mat one identifies oneself with the universal life. Mudra is the knowledge of the luminous Atman, Self, in the thousand petalled Lotus above; or it means abondonment of one's participation in evil that goes to bind.

The Mahanirvana Tantra lays it down: When the Kali age is in full sway, in the case of the householder whose mind is entirely engrossed with domestic desires, the three sweets should be substituted in the place of the first element of worship. Milk, sugar and honey are the three sweets They should be deemed to be the image of wine, and as such offered to the Deity. Those born in Kali age are by their nature weak in intellect, and their minds are distracted by lust. By reason of this, they do not recognise the Shakti to be the image of the Deity.

It is then that the worship of the Great Sri Chakra, Abode of the mighty Puissance of the Divine Mother, can be performed effec-tively by means of Mantra-Yoga. Not merely chanting of Mantras, but by yoga of mantra i.e. by a deep identification with the soul of the Mantra that is repeated. Such worship, says the Lord, He accepts with distinction along with Her. And when the worshipper enters into the Ritual, he must realise and come into a state of consciousness that feels divine. To truly commune with the Divine and to offer oneself to the Divine, one must become aware of one's own state of divinity. Such a worshipper attains Fulfilment as well as Release. Worship must be performed in a place which is free from distractions and disturbances, free from crowd.

Prior to beginning the ceremony he shall, with an un-agitated mind, visualise himself seated in the jewelled abode of the Divine Mother in the Ocean of Immortality with all the high paraphernalia required for the worship and perform the Puja according to the command of the Guru.

The substances used for worship shall be purified by prescribed methods of sprinkling with sanctified water reciting the Mantras, with mudra etc. The Mantras that are used are to be purified* by appropriate means. And lastly, the Deity to be worshipped is also to be purified, by placing it on the seat, making it whole, i.e. by invoking the life of the Deity into it, sprinkling with sanctified water along with recital of the Mulamantra, performance of nyasa etc. in the prescribed manner. Adorning it with ornaments, offering of incense, lights etc. follow afterwards.

She who dwells in the cluster of Lotuses, Who is the Form of Causal Delight, ever active for the good of all, the Divine Mother is fervently called into coming and beseeched to stay as long as the worship is in progress. And the worship is offered with an exclusive concentration. The Divine, say the philosophies, is really without form, without any features. Then how is it, it may be asked, that It is enjoined to be worshipped in so many kinds of form and lauded in Its features in the various scriptures? The Agama gives the answer. The Brahman is indeed the Immeasurable, the Impersonal, without attribute, a sheer Consciousness. Yet for the benefit of the aspir-ing, of those who seek for It, Brahman assumes forms, determines Itself in a way as to be cognisable and accessible. It takes Form but certainly It is not limited by that Form or any number of Forms. Thus, though the Supreme manavaugha, the human order. The 6rst, the divine order, consists of Adinatha and His Shakti, Sadasiva and his consort, Ishwara and his consort, Rudra and his consort, Vishnu and his beloved, Brahma and his wife - in all twelve.

The third, the ordinary, is of gods who apparently occupy a subordinate position in this scheme: Narasimha, Mahesha, Bhaskara, Mahendra, Madhava, Vishnu - in all six.

Just as though milk is formed from the constituents all over the body of the cow, it flows out only through the teats of its udder, similarly the Divine who is all pervading shines specially resplendent in Images and the like. The Presence of the Divine in the Form is deter-mined in its intensity by the appropriateness of that Form, specially of the worship offered and by the faith of the worshipper.

The Divine is likewise there spread in each body; but with-out proper adoration and evocation, upasana, it does not yield fruit to man. All the pranas of the Deity are to be sum-moned together, the limbs enlivened, all instal-led in the Image and then is the live Deity to be worshipped. Otherwise worship is fruitless. There may be defect of Mantra, defect of ritual, defect of process; still if this installation is done in the proper manner, the worship bears fruit.

Because it regulates, subdues, niyantrana, all misery arising from desire, anger and other failings. As the body is to the jiva, soul, as oil is to the lamp, the Yantra is the established seat of all the Deities. Therefore draw the Yantra, meditate upon Her auspicious form, know everything from the mouth of the Guru and worship according to rule. If worship be done without proper Yantra then it can only entail the curse of the Deity. Each Deity is to be carefully installed in its own Yantra and worshipped with all its parapher-nalia.

The Tantra seeks to weave it into every detail of life, give a different meaning to each of man's activities by making all of them means for the effectuation and expression of the inner yoga of progression from the human into the divine.

The grosser kind of medita-tion with Form is resorted to when the mind is very unsteady and needs to be given a prop, a concrete object on which to fix itself so that it may not wander away. But the object of both the gross and subtle kinds of Dhyana is the same: steadiness, immobility of mind. When the Divine is conceived with form, it is contemplated upon in its several limbs, feet, hands etc., in the prescribed manner. When it is conceived as without form, it is con-templated upon as the Sacchidananda, all-luminous, without parts. It neither rises nor sets, neither waxes nor wanes, it shines by itself and enshines others without effort.

And when the Reality so shines on its own, one instantly becomes That Itself. He who is as if asleep whether in the condition of dream or of waking, neither breathing in nor breathing out, immobile, he is truly freed. Whose senses are without stir, whose mind and breath are absorbed in his self, who is like one dead, he is called the Jivanmukta, liberated while yet living. He neither hears nor smells nor touches nor sees, neither he knows pleasure and pain, neither he exercises the mind. Like a log of wood, he cognises nothing nor is aware of anything; he is only absorbed in Shiva, he is in samadhi. As with water thrown into water, milk into milk, ghee into ghee, no difference remains, similarly no difference there remains between the jivatma and the Paramatma, the soul and the Lord. Even as the insect becomes a bee by force of concentration, so can man become Brahman by dint of samadhi. And once the self is separated from the gunas, it is never the same again, just as butter extracted from milk even when thrown again into the milk does not get into the old state.

As the power of poison is killed by Mantra or by medicine, so does the knower of Mantra sever in a trice the bonds of the pasu by dlksa From this extensive bondage diksa alone liberates, by pointing out the supreme station and leads to the ancient divine Abode. Diksa, given according to the prescribed mode, burns up in a moment all ill-omens and great sins in their millions. That by which the pasus (animal men) have their eyes opened and become Shivas, is the diksa which liberates from the bonds of the paSus. That which instantly generates faith and conviction is diksa; the rest are only pleasing to the populace. That diksa without which there is no fulfil ment even with a hundred upasanas, should be obtained from a holy Guru for the success of the Mantra.

For one who is initiated there is nothing to be achieved by tapas, regulations and observan-ces, pilgrimages and regulative controls of the body.

All other means can be left out and only the means of mantra i.e. japa of mantra resorted to which is sure to yield success if carried out without blemish But if it is allowed to be tarnished with fault then its fruit is indeed inauspicious. Japa is the happy giver of enjoyment, salvation, self-fulfilling wish. Therefore practise the Yoga of Japa and Dhyana. All blemishes due to transgressions of rule, from the Jiva up to the Brahma, done know-ingly or unknowingly, are wiped away by Japa. Should you desire fulfilment in this life ridden heavily with unhappiness, doing Japa of the Mantra with the five-limbed upasana you will attain happiness. Daily puja at the three prescribed hours - in the morning, noon and evening - japa, tarpana (offering of libation), homa and feeding the Brahmanas is this fivefold upasana called purascarana. If any of these limbs are lacking, make up for it with appro-priate increase of Japa as prescribed.
