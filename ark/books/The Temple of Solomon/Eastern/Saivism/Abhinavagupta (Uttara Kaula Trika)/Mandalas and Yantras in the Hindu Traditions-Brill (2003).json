The main focus o f such interest has been directed toward Tibetan mandalas, specimens of which have been included in num e­rous publications. But mandalas are found across a wide spectrum of South Asian religious traditions, including those of the Hindus and Jains. Mandalas are also part of East Asian Buddhist traditions.In South Asia, mandalas have been used mainly in occasional rites o f worship. In these rites deities are invoked into mandalas with the aid of mantras. The construction of a mandala is specially important in Tantric initiation (dlksa) rites, In esoteric teaching, a mandala may be visualized as present in the practitioner’s body by correlating the cosmic symbolism of the mandala with the practitioner’s body parts. Mandala patterns have had other far-reaching influences. They have, for example, had an impact on ancient town-planning. The use of mandalas is also documented in alchemy.'The South Asian tradition of preparing and worshipping mandalas and yantras continues up to the present. On the level o f folk art the kohbar mandalas, which decorate the walls o f the nuptial chamber in the Mithila region of north Bihar (India) and Nepal, are a good example of this, So are the auspicious floor designs prepared with rice flour or coloured powders and regionally know n as rahgoll, alpana, m u g g u lu or kolam , which have been influenced by mandala and yantra patterns.Yantras have been employed especially in rites o f magic. Their use has been recommended in astrology and, to some extent, in Ayur-Veda. The yantra o f a deity is customarily placed under the deity’s statue at the time of its installation in a temple.

In the citrabandha compositions in Sanskrit, for example, text can be arranged in yantra-like shapes.2Like mandalas, yantras continue to be worshipped in South Asia. The sricakra or sriyantra, which is a configuration of a ccntral point and sets of triangles surrounded by lotus petals, circles and a square, is widely worshipped in contemporary India and Nepal. It is installed and worshipped, among other places, in the Srngcri m atha, which claims to uphold Samkara’s tradition. In Nepal, it decorates roofs of shrines. The sricakra is now also sold as a pendant to be worn around the neck, and is printed on popular wall calendars. A numerical yantra, the visoyantra,3 is currently worshipped in Ambaji, Gujarat.4 Popular books promote yantras for miscellaneous mundane purposes, including safe driving. Copper yantras from India can easily be purchased over the Internet for similar purposes.Patterns typical of mandalas and yantras have inspired modern Indian architecture, art and dance, The Mumbai-based contemporary architect Charles Correa has been guided by mandala designs in his layout o f buildings, such as the new State Assembly (Vidhan Bhavan) in Bhopal. Inspired by a navagrahamandala pattern, Correa designed the Jawahar Kala Kendra, a cultural centre in Jaipur. Correa’s Surya Kund in Delhi is said to be based on a mandala plan featuring the sricakra in its centre.5 Inspired mainly by the sricakra, the 20th-century Indian artist Nirad M ajum dar created his ink drawing Yantra.h The contemporary dancer Chandralekha acknow­2 Some authorities do not rccognize these compositions as poetry.

Descriptions of mandalas in ancient texts are barely studied, and usually left untranslated. Descriptions of them in popular books often appear to be confused, since many authors apply the same terminology to what appear to be somewhat similar structures without differentiating between traditions. Psychoanalysts and psychologists endeavour to interpret the mandala by applying their own categories, These approaches are of limited value for an understanding of the structures and functions of mandalas in the context of South Asian traditions. Since mandalas are not objects of art p e r se but are embedded in a ritual context, a purely art-historical approach to the subject will not do justice to them either.Thanks to advances in the study o f Tantric texts over the past decades and the increased availability of objects from South Asia, new materials have becom e available which put us in a better position than previous scholars to carry out research on mandalas and yantras. But museums are usually not the places to look for mandalas and yantras, since the latter are ritual rather than art objects, and so executed by craftsm en rather than artists. An exception is the collection of about 60 copper yantras from Bengal in the Museum fiir indische Kunst, Berlin. The private collection of yantras and mandalas of Robert Clark, Barcelona, is documented in Stadtner 1998.Drawings of yantras are often found in South Asian manuscripts and printed books dealing with magical and Tantric rituals, and in art catalogues as w ell.7 The yantra designs found in these sources are7 See, for example, S otheby’s London: Catalogue o f Islamic, Indian, Tibetan, N epalese and South-East Asian Decorative and O ther W orks o f Art, also A nti­quities.

One problem is the authenticity of mandala and yantra designs. Yantras are frequently executed on copperplates as ordered by a practitioner. They are copied from drawings in manuscripts, sketchbooks (Nepal) or printed books. Their structures and the mantras inscribed in them often contain errors that go unnoticed due to the ignorance of craftsmen, copyists and practi­tioners. Pranavananda <1977>: 75-79 examines nearly 200 tiricakras from various parts of India and concludes that most of them show major or minor flaws in their designs or other irregularities, and so do not tally with the descriptions in ancient texts. According to this author (Pranavananda <1977>: 4, 109), certain changes were made to the structure of the sricakra early on and these errors have been perpetuated blindly by tradition. Artists in popular tourist spots in Rajasthan and Nepal paint mostly for the tourist industry. They freely mix elements from different traditions and copy designs from books and museum catalogues printed in the West. Their products often do not represent a continuation of ancient traditions. During a recent visit to Bhaktapur in Nepal I interviewed a painter about the use of the sarvatobhadras and lingatobhadras in his country. He had not seen these mandalas, and indeed eagerly photocopied my diagrams. I would not be surprised if painted bhadramandalas, are soon being sold in the shops of Bhaktapur as traditional Nepalese mandalas. Customers will then use them as wall decorations, although such mandalas were never intended to be hung on the wall but were traditionally prepared on the ground from powders or grains as supports for deities invoked into them. The Indigo Gallery in Kathmandu was already recently displaying a painted lingatobhadra which, along with another mandala, had been copied from Madhu Khanna’s book ‘Yantra: The Tantric Symbol of Cosmic Unity.’Previous Scholarship on Hindu M andalas and YantrasAmong the early studies of mandalas and yantras the works of H. Zimmer and P.H. Pott should be mentioned. Based on works by Sir J. Woodroffe (alias A. Avalon) (1865-1936) and his collaborators,8H.

Zimmer argues that icons o f deities or ‘figurative sacred im ages’(pratima) can be subsumed under the category yantra, and in fact are essentially and functionally identical with yantras, cakras and mandalas (1984: 28-29). P.H. Pott’s ‘Yoga and Yantra’ (1946) takes a different approach. Even though he recurs to his predecessors J. Woodroffe and H, Zimmer, Pott’s goal is to explain the function yantras have within the context of Tantric Yoga. Like Zimmer, Pott refers to both Buddhist and Hindu texts throughout his work. A classic work is G. Tucci’s ‘The Theory and Practice of the Mandala, W ith S p ecia l R e fe re n ce to the M odern P sy c h o lo g y o f the S u b ­co n scio u s,’ published in 1949 in Italian but translated into English only in 1961.

Khanna entitled ‘Yantra: The Tantric Symbol of Cosmic U nity,’ published in 1979, and S.K.R. R ao’s small work ‘The Y antras,’ which appeared in 1988. Rao also authored a two-volume book on mandalas entitled ‘Mandalas in Temple W orship’ (1988-1990).In 1986 A. Padoux edited ‘Mantras et diagrammes rituels dans l’hindouisme,’ which is a collection of scholarly articles on mantras, mandalas and yantras em ployed in the Hindu traditions.

The plan to publish a book on mandalas and yantras in the Hindu traditions took shape over time as I observed the growing popular interest in Tibetan Buddhist mandalas. Unlike the many Tibetan mandalas which include pictorial representations of multiple deities, most published mandalas in the Hindu traditions appear to be simpler and more abstract in design. However, Hindu mandalas, especially from Nepal and Rajasthan, often include painted images of deities.15 Complex mandalas are also described in texts, and the practitioner is instructed to visualize multiple deities in the mandalas, although these deities may not be represented. This volume reproduces several mandala designs, some of which have been reconstructed from texts. Since texts often do not specify all details of the mandalas, such reconstructions necessarily remain tentative.With the exception o f the gricakra, which has attracted con­siderable interest, adequate attention has not been devoted to manda­las and yantras in the Hindu traditions and their multiple uses. Unlike the approaches of earlier books, which indiscriminately deal with Buddhist and Hindu mandalas and which often arrive at generalized conclusions, this book attempts to clarify important aspects of man­dalas and yantras in specific Hindu traditions through investigations by specialists. In the present state o f research it is best to avoid generalizations and broad comparisons across traditions that rarely take into account existing differences, and often turn out on closer examination to be inaccurate. The complex Buddhist mandalas for their part merit a separate study. Nevertheless I hope that this book will indirectly contribute to a better understanding of the mandala in other South Asian traditions, and will lay the foundation for future inquiries.The essays in this book explore some aspects o f mandalas and yantras in the Smarta, Pancaratra, Saiva and &akta traditions. An essay on the vastupurusamandala and its relationship to architecture is also included. It would have been useful to have essays on the use15 In Nepal, even the sricakra occasionally includes painted images o f deities; see, for example, Illustration 43 in Kreijger 1999: 110-111.

It was, however, not possible to find qualified authors who could write these essays within the given time frame. Thus this book is a contribution to the study of an area of South Asian culture which has hardly been researched, but it is not an exhaustive treatment. This would have been an unrealistic goal, given the extant mass of material on the topic.In secondary sources, mandalas (and yantras) have been described too uniformly as aids to meditation or visualization.16 While they certainly function as meditational devices in some traditions (as, for instance, the sricakra frequently does), this use of mandalas is but one aspect o f a larger picture. In this regard I I. Brunner’s paper in this volume is significant, since she sets out to examine some popular notions about mandalas critically and to emphasize other uses o f mandalas in ritual. In architecture, the notion o f an ‘all- governing m andala’ of symbolically significant dimensions which underlies all buildings is frequently met with in the literature, and has recently been challenged by Bafna 2000: 4 2 -4 3 ,17The first essay in this book is designed as an introduction to the topic. Referring to H. Brunner and others, I discuss the meanings of mandala, yantra and cakra, and suggest distinctions among these terms. This is followed by a treatment of different categories of mandalas, yantras and cakras and their constituent parts.In the next essay, I focus on mandala-like structures and actual mandalas and yantras currently employed in the ritual practice in Maharastra. In its first part, I discuss mandala-like arrangements, such as the baljliaranacakra and pancayatana shrines, along with the navagrahamandala as an example of a mandala with a lotus design. A description o f two yantra structures follows. Together with the previous essay, this section is intended to introduce the reader to basic concepts and mandala designs in the Hindu traditions. The second part of the essay focuses on a specific category of mandala called bhadramandalas. These are square-shaped mandalas employed mainly in concluding ceremonies of religious observances (vrata).16 For a critical examination o f the claim that mandalas in Shingon Buddhism arc aids or ‘supports’ for visualization practiccs, see Sharf 2 0 0 1.17 See M.

She then discusses the multiple functions of mandalas in Pancaratra rituals, The choice of a mandala for a rite is guided by the desire to achieve specific results. It depends on the suitability of a mandala for a certain rite and the main deity worshipped in it. The use o f man­dalas in initiations (diksa) is treated elaborately. Some details of the ritual, such as the casting of a flower onto a mandala by the blind­folded initiand, have parallels in Buddhist Tantric initiation rituals.18 The deity is made to be present in a mandala by imposing the deity’s mantras on the mandala structure. Two important mandalas in the Pancaratra tradition are the cakrabjamandala and the navapadma- mandala. The Pancaratra Samhitas consider the mandala a represen­tation of the deity’s body, and o f the universe as well. According to some Samhitas, emancipation is only possible through mandala worship. Rastelli further discusses the significance of yantras in the Pancaratra tradition. She focuses especially on the saudarsana- yantra'9 which is considered so powerful that the person who wears it requires another yantra, the ‘yantra of the wearer’ (dharakayantra), to keep its power in check. As in the case of mandalas, the material from which yantras are made is considered essential for the efficacy of the rite. Different materials are believed to produce different results, (The texts of the Saiva Siddhanta that Brunner examines em­phasize the varying efficacy of the materials from which mandalas are constructed, from precious stones on downwards.)The three following essays deal with aspects o f the Saiva traditions. Helene Brunner has been researching Saivagamas for more than thirty years. M ost o f her work is written in French and therefore accessible to a more limited readership. For this volume, her French paper, originally published in Padoux’s edited volume, ‘Mantras et diagrammes rituels dans 1’hindouisme,’ (1986: 11-35), was translated into English by R. Prevereau, M.A,, and completelyThis topic has been dealt with repeatedly; for a description o f the disciple’s entrance into the mandala and his casting o f a flower, see, for example, W ayman 1974.19 The saudarsanayantra appears to be identical with the sudarsanayantra (see section 2.3.3 of the following essay)."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"10GUDRUN BUHNEMANNrevised and enlarged, Brunner’s essay is divided into two parts. The first part attempts to clarify the meaning and use of the terms mandala, yantra and cakra. Her classification of different types of mandalas based on their ritual application is of special interest. (I have taken up B runner’s discussion o f the different types of mandalas in the following essay [section 1.2], as has Torzsok in her own.) The second part describes the use of mandalas in the ritual worship of Siva. Brunner reconstructs the sarvatobhadramandaki described in chapter 3 of the Saradatilaka, which is used in an initiation (diksa) ritual, and analyzes its structure in detail. Finally, she discusses the signi ficance of mandalas in the Siddhanta School.Judit Torzsok examines pre-1 Ith-century Saiva mandalas as icons which express a relationship between certain branches o f Saivism and between Saiva and non-Saiva groups. In the first part of her paper she deals with the uses of the terms mandala and cakra, a topic also taken up by Brunner. This leads into a discussion on how the circles (cakra) of deities are present in a mandala. Torzsok then focuses on two kinds of mandalas: mandalas used in initiations (diksa) and mandalas (and yantras) for the acquisition of supernatural powers (siddhi). Giving examples from the Svacchandatantra, she shows how mandalas can visually represent doctrines of other Saiva groups and teachings of non-Saivas. Torzsok. specifies three major strategies (specialization, expansion and substitution) which are employed to adapt mandalas to a specific purpose, such as the acquisition of supernatural powers, In the Appendices, Torzsok attempts to reconstruct four mandalas from textual descriptions. The reconstruction of two mandalas (see Colour Plates 18-19) is tentative and does not show the outer boundaries that are characteristic of mandala designs. These boundaries are not specifically mentioned in the texts, but are likely to have been assumed.Andre Padoux’s first essay in this volume examines descriptions of mandalas and their use in Abhinavagupta’s Tantraloka (early 11th century). Basing himself mainly on material from various sections of the text, Padoux portrays the uses of such mandalas as the tri$ulabja- mandala and trilris u la bja ina n da hr in rites, including the different forms of the initiation (diksa) and the practitioner’s daily ritual wor­ship, in which the mandala is visualized as being present in his body.Andre Padoux’s second essay deals with the sricakra as described in the first chapter of the (most likely) 1'lth-century Yoginlhrdaya."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"IN T R O D U C T I O N11This chapter offers a description of the ‘descent’ (avatara) o f the sricakra as a cosmic process and manifestation of divine power, which the practitioner visualizes and experiences in his body.

For the names o f many places and temples, popular transliterations are already in circulation which may not conform to scholarly standards. I have in many instances retained the popular transliteration of such words in order to avoid burdening the reader with unusual spellings of names. The transliteration of words from Nevari poses its own problems, since there is often more than one current spelling of a word. I am aware of minor inconsisten-211 For a discussion o f the problems associated with the term Hinduism, see, for instance, Smith 1987.21 Padoux 1987b, Verardi 1994: 52-53 and Urban 1999, am ong others, have discussed these problematic terms."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"12GUDRUN BUHNEMANNcies in spellings of words from Indian languages used by the diffe­rent authors, and also their divergent treatment of parentheses.

In Tantric tra­ditions, the term mandala often refers to a space with a special struc­ture that is enclosed and delimited by a circumferential line and into which a deity or deities are invited by means of mantras. This space is often a circle, but may also appear as a square, a triangle or another shape.2 The various shapes and structures o f mandalas are based on the traditions of the.different schools, ritual applications, the deities worshipped and the practitioner’s qualification and goal. Mandalas themselves are prepared from various materials, including1 For a discussion o f the uncertain etymology o f the word mandala, see Mayr- hofer 1986-2001, volum e 2: 294, A religious etymology o f the word appears in Kularnava-Tantra 17.59:mangalatvac ca dakinya yoginiganasarnsrayat /lalitatvac ca dcvesi m andalam parikirtitam l/“O mistress of the gods, it is called mandala because it is auspicious (nrangalatva), because it is the abode of the group o f Yoginis of the Dakini, and because of (its) beauty (lalitatvii),”For an etym ology of the w ord m andala, which divides the w ord into the components manda (explained as sara [essence]) and la (from the verbal root la [to take]), see Tantraloka 37.21 with Jayaratha’s commentary, referred to in Padoux, p. 227); Buddhist texts also divide the word mandala into these two components, but different interpretations are given to them; cf. the discussions in W aym an 1999, Lessing/Wayman 1978: 270, note 1, Toganoo 1971: 150-160, Rambelli 1991: 9-13 and Tribe 1994: 127.2 Brunner, p. 157, note 5 and Torzsok, p. 208 also refer to semi-circular mandalas and mandalas having the (triangular) shape of a vulva (yo n i), among others."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"14GUDRUN BUHNEM ANNcoloured powders, precious stones, fruits and leaves, and fragrant substances.3 It must be emphasized, however, that the mandala is not merely a physical structure with a specific design. A mandala is the place in which the practitioner beholds the deities who have been invoked into it and so have become an integral part of the structure.4 Mandalas figure among the places into which deities can be invoked. These include statues, vessels and lire.5Mandalas are required in occasional (not daily) rituals, such as festivals or religious observances (vrntii) and more importantly Tantric initiation (diksa) rites, in which latter the viewing of the mandala is an essential clement/' At the time of initiation the man­dala structure functions as a place in which the deities bccome visible to the initiate for the first time, thereby confirming the initiate’s new identity (Torzsok, pp. 183-184, 189, 190). The m andala structure can function as an important device for representing the pantheon of deities in a system or school, and expressing the hierarchy of deities within the system. This hierarchy can even include deities of other systems as pari of a ‘lower revelation,’ and can indicate a cosmic order as well (Torzsok, p. 196). Further, mandalas, like yantras, are used in rituals leading to the attainment of supernatura l powers (siddhi).7While most mandalas follow the common pattern of a concentric arrangement of deities in order to express a hierarchy, the trident mandala of the Trika also features a vertical ascent. The mandala’s trident is seen as rising three-dimensionally from a central lotus, as if coming out of the mandala’s surface (Torzsok, p. 196). We do not know whether three-dimensional mandalas were actually construc­ted. Such mandalas are known from Buddhist texts and traditions. The Visnu-Samhita (cf. Rastelli, p, 123) instructs the practitioner to make the lines of a mandala in varying thicknesses, with the centre3 For materials listed in the Pancaralra SamhitFis, see Rastelli, p. 123; for mandalas made from fragrant substances (gandhainandalu), sec Padoux, p. 226.4 See the discussion in Torzsok, pp. 183-184 for more details.5 Rastelli, p. 126 discusscs the worship o f the deity in four places (catuhstlulna) attested to in the younger Pancaralra Samhitas. These placcs arc a mandala, a vessel, fire and a statue. Torzsok, p. 193, note 60, quoting the Tantraloka, lists 11 supports of external worship, including a rosary, manuscript and mirror.6 Cf. Rastelli, pp. 130ff., Torzsok, pp. 185ff. and Padoux, pp. 227ff. for this aspect o f mandalas.1 See Torzsok, pp. 2 0 1-20 9 for a description of such use o f mandalas in early Saiva Tantras."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"M A N D A L A , Y A N T R A A N D C A K R A15o f the mandala its most elevated part, which could be taken to presuppose the concept of three-dimensionality. Three-dimensional yantras are not uncommon in the Hindu traditions, and are described below in section 2.1.Different theological interpretations have been applied to m an­dalas, the structural parts and deities being correlated with doctrines of different systems. Interpretations are extremely varied, and even one text may provide more than one interpretation of the parts of a mandala.Patterns exhibited by mandalas have had widespread influence. Mandala patterns of cities have frequently been described.8 H ow ­ever, it often remains unclear what the connection between a m an­dala and a city or temple really means, as Bafna 2000: 26 notes. Problems arise when one attempts to correlate mandala structures and actual building plans. Gutschow 1982: 179, 185 argues that con­temporary drawings of mandalas of cities, such as the mandala o f the city of Bhaktapur in Nepal, usually do not reflect ancient guidelines for town-planning but rather represent a specific interpretation of existing urban conditions. A mandala pattern is thus projected onto the city by establishing connections between already existing buil­dings. These connections may not be immediately intelligible to the outside observer, and are indeed open to interpretation.The terms cakra and yantra are sometimes used as synonyms for mandala, and all three terms are often translated indiscriminately as ‘(mystical) diagrams.’ The fact that the geometric designs of man­dalas, yantras and cakras are similar contributes to confusion among the three. Not only Western authors confuse the terms, even later Sanskrit texts often use ‘m andala’ and ‘yantra’ rather loosely as synonyms. Occasionally metrical considerations and constraints may have played a role in the choice o f a word, as when a text uses the word pura (‘city’), for example, as a synonym for m andala.9 Others See, for example, Gutschow/Kolver 1975, where the authors describe the layout o f the city o f Bhaktapur in Nepal; see also Zanen 1986: 148-150, relating to the N evar town Sankhu, For a critical approach to a m andala as a concept said to underlie town-planning, see Roy 1977, who discusses the layout o f Jaipur, and Tillotson 1987: 81-83, who focuses on the palaces o f Bundelkhand.9 For the use o f the w ord pura ( ‘city ’) as a synonym for m andala, see the discussion among T.

Kramrisch 1946, volume 1:11 defines ‘mandala’ as a yantra when she writes about the vastupurusamandala: “The Vastupurusamandala, the diagram of the temple, is a Yantra....” Lieberl 1976: 168 does the same when she defines the word as the name “of a kind of y a n tr a ”'2 Similarly, Renou/Filliozat 1947-1953, volume 1: 568 state that yantras in which a more or less decorated circle predominates are called cakra or mandala. In addition, some authors assume that yantras are the counterparts of mandalas in the Hindu traditions. This erroneously implies that mandalas arc rarely part o f the Hindu traditions and that yantras are not found in the Buddhist traditions. 13 Thus Tucci (1949) 1961: 46 states: “in Hinduism, however, yantras, purely linear designs expressing the same principles, are usually substituted for mandalas ...;” 14 and Eliade 1969: 219 writes: “The simplest mandala is the yantra, employed by Hinduism....”Several scholars have attempted to establish semantic distinctions among the three terms mandala, yantra and cakra.15 One approach attempts to establish distinctions on the basis o f the structure and constituent parts of these objects. Rao 1914-1916, volume 1: 330 states that a cakra “is defined in the Tantras as a figure consisting of10 Rastclli, p. 1 19, note 1, reports that the Pauskara-Samhitn uses the word yfig a synonymously with mandala.11 For a discussion of the terms b havam t/bhuviw a, vesm an and p ith n a s synonyms for mandala, sec Torzsok, p. 182.12 A similar statement is found in Bernier 1979: 120: “Every m andala is essentially a yantra....\"13 Bizot 1981 describes Buddhist yantras in South-east Asia, especially Cambodia and Thailand. Yantra are also described in Buddhist Sanskrit texts, such as the Vimalaprabha commentary on the Kalacakratantra, chapter 3 (Vimalaprabhatika o f Kalkin Srlpundarika on Srilaghukalacakratanlraraja by £rimaiYju£riya&as, volume 2, edited by V.

Mandala and yantra often have the same geometrical forms, but the yantra may also have different forms..., The yantra is more worshipped than meditated upon.

In this quotation the word angle (asra) is synonymous with the Sanskrit word corner (k o n a) as used in the terms triangle (trikona) or hexagram (satkona). The expression 'petal-like parts’ renders the Sanskrit word patra. The above distinction between cakra and yantra, however, appears to be purely theoretical and may be applicable only in a specific tradition. It does not account for the many yantras which are commonly described as consisting of petal­like parts. Zimmer (1926) 1984: 28-29 translates the three terms cakra, mandala and yantra as ‘circle-shape’ designs (cakra), ‘ring- shaped’ designs (mandala) and linear figures (yantra). It is not explained, however, exactly what is meant by these terms and what the differences between the ‘circle-shaped’ and ‘ring-shaped’ designs would be. Gaeffke 1987: 155 notes that “it has become customary to call the simpler designs for daily worship yantras, and to reserve the term mandala for the larger ones in public ceremonies where the whole cosmos has to be present.” Another approach attempts to establish distinctions between mandalas, yantras and cakras on the basis o f the deities invoked into these objects. W oodroffe 1914, volume 2: 285, note 13 makes a very generalized statement, which is applicable only to few mandalas, when he asserts that the “difference between a Mandala and a Yantra is that the former is used in the case o f any Devata, whereas a Yantra is appropriate to a specific Devata only.” 16 The following formulation by Shankaranarayanan 1970: 9 is a variation o f W oodroffe’s statement, and is equally problematic: “The Mandala is used in the case of any deity while the Chakra is specifically intended for a particular deity.” Shankaranarayanan apparently replaced the word yantra in W oodroffe’s definition with the word cakra. Schneider 1988: 100 attempts to make a distinction between mandala and yantra on the basis of the number o f deities invoked. He suggests that a mandala represents the microcosm and accom m odates a pantheon of deities who are positioned in it according to rank. A yantra, on the other hand, is the domain o f a single deity, but may include that deity’s retinue. This distinctionMANDALA, YANTRA AND CAKRA 1716 The same, apparently widespread, definition also appears in Jhavery 1944: 71, Woodroffe 1956: 91, note 2 and in Kane 1968-1977, volume 5: 1135."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"18GUDRUNBUHNEMANNappears to be based on a statement by Pott (1946) 1966: 71, who describes “a mandala as a co sm ic configuration in the centre of which is an image or symbolic substitute of a prominent god surrounded by those of a number of deities of lower rank ordered hierarchically both among themselves and in relation to the chief figures, which configuration may be used as an aid to m editation and in ritual as a receptacle for the g o d s.” l ie adds thal a mandala is “distinguished from a yantra by a more graphic representat ion of the deities or of their symbols and by a richer elaboration of the details.” This last statement by Pott also takes the structure of mandalas and yantras into consideration and is somewhat more satisfactory than the definitions of his predecessors.Yet another approach looks at the ritual use of mandalas and yan­tras. Thus Vergati 1986: 37, 44-45 observes that mandalas are used in secret as well as public ceremonies of the Hindus and Buddhists in Nepal, whereas the yantras, which always represent the goddess, have more restricted uses. It has also been noted that mandalas are usually objects for temporary ritual use. The deities are invoked into them and dismissed at the end of the ritual, after which the mandala is dismantled. Yantras made of permanent materials into which a deity has been invoked are usually kept in the temple or shrine for continued worship (Sharma 1994: 423-424). It must be added, how­ever, that many yantras are made for temporary use, like mandalas. Rastelli, p. 144 notes yet another feature that sets mandalas and yantras apart in the Pancaralra tradition. She states that mantras are already inscribed on yantras at the time of manufacturing the yantra. The drawing of the lines of the structure and the writing of the mantras are a single process, which may indicate that a yantra repre­sents one integrated unit in which the deity is worshipped. Mandalas, however, are constructed first and the deities are invoked into them with mantras only later. It must be added, however, that later texts enjoin that yantras be first prepared and then infused with life in a special ritual, the pranapratistha, with the help of mantras. It is not possible to summarize all attempts at defining ‘m andala,’ ‘yantra’ and ‘cakra’ in the literature. The use and functions of these terms are complex and it will be impossible to arrive at a universally valid definition. An in-depth study of the use of the terms in texts of different religious systems and time periods would be required to"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"MANDALA, YANTRA AND CAKRA19determine how the terms have been employed by different authors and how the use of these terms has changed over time.1.2 Types o f M andalas according to H. BrunnerH. Brunner’s contribution to this book describes uses of the word mandala based on her study of pre-13th-century Saiva manuals. Even though she confines herself to an analysis o f the texts o f the Siddhanta School of Saivism, her observations on the use o f the terms mandala, yantra and cakra appear to have a somewhat wider application. Brunner takes the term mandala to signify a limited, not necessarily round, surface, and distinguishes four basic types of mandalas:Type 1: Limited surfaces without a clear structure, which are commonly employed as seats for divinities, men or objects during ritual, such as mandalas o f cow-dung smeared on the ground. They can be called ‘seat-mandalas,’Type 2: Limited surfaces with geometrical designs prepared from coloured powders, which serve as supports for the regular or occasional worship of deities. These mandalas are for temporary use, being destroyed after the ritual. They are constructed in a ritual, with close adherence to directional orientation. Commonly three, four or five different colours are employed. These mandalas, often called ‘powder mandalas’ (rajom andala), may be large-sized and so allow for the priest to enter through the doors and move around in ‘streets.’ According to Brunner, such mandalas are temporarily constructed divine icons and can be called ‘im age-mandalas’ (the term is not used in any texts).Type 3: Limited surfaces divided into a certain number of squares or units called padas, domains into which divine or demonic powers are invoked to receive food offerings (ball). Their construction usually does not involve the use of colours. The best known mandala in this category is the vastum andala. Brunner also includes in this category geometrical figures divided into boxes among which objects are distributed. She refers to the mandalas in this category as ‘distributive diagrams.’Type 4. The term mandala is also used to designate the symbolic shapes of the five elements and the spheres/orbs of the sun, moon"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"20GUDRUN BUHNEMANNand fire. The shapes of the elements are visualized, for example, in the Tantric rite of purification of the elements (bhutasuddhi) of the performer’s body. Since the shapes of the elements and the spheres of the sun, moon and fire are neither concrete material objects nor supports for worship in the way that the previously discussed mandalas are, they do not really fit the present context and are therefore excluded from further discussion.Concerning Brunner’s first category of mandalas, I would like to add that in other traditions ‘seat-mandala’ appears to be more commonly used for ritual objects than for persons. The function of these mandalas is to protect ritual objects placed on them. Such supports, made of various materials, may feature simple geometric patterns, and can be referred to as mandalas or ‘yantras for (establishing) a foundation’ (stbapanayantra) (see 2.2.1).The name of the second category, ‘ im age-mandala,’ may be somewhat misleading, since it suggests the presence o f a pictorial representation of the deity in the mandala— which is not intended. What is meant is that the entire mandala is the principal support for worship and is present as an image/icon for the duration of the ritual. These mandalas are also called ‘powder mandalas’ (.rajomandala) (but they may also be made from other materials, such as grains) and can be characterized as supports into which deities axe invited in order to receive worship.Brunner’s classification of types of mandalas and their ritual use in the Saiva tradition is valuable. In all attempts at classification, however, we need to be aware of the fact that in both texts and ritual practice the distinction among the types o f mandalas is not always that clear. Any classification can therefore only be o f limited practical value, and is often applicable only within one particular system.1.3 S o m e Structural Elem ents o f MandalasMandalas display different shapes and patterns, and are made up of various constituent parts, depending on the tradition they come from. In the following I will describe two basic structural elements of mandalas, the lotus design and square grid. In the next essay, I will provide concrete examples of these structures from the Smarta tra-"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"MANDALA, YANTRA AND CAKRA21dition of Maharastra. Geometric figures like the triangle and hexa­gram, which occasionally also appear in mandalas, will be described in section 2.3 in connection with yantras. In the following I will look at mandala patterns of different periods and traditions simultane­ously, without attempting to treat the topic historically.1.3.1 Lotus DesignsLotus designs appear commonly in Indian art as well as in mandalas and in yantras. The lotus is a common South Asian symbol of creation, purity, transcendence and the sphere of the absolute, 17 but is especially known as a symbol of the female reproductive organ. It has also been connected with water symbolism since ancient times, as already indicated by a statement in Satapatha-Brahmana 7.4.1.8: “The lotus is the waters.” Indeed, in descriptions of the symbolic shapes (mandala) of the elements (bhuta)]S the lotus represents the element water.19In mandalas and yantras o f lotus design, the central deity is positioned in the pericarp (karnika), and the emanations or subordi­nate deities in the petals.20 A lotus design may have one ring or several concentric rings of petals. The petals of an eight-petalled lotus ideally point in the cardinal and intermediate directions, but we find numerous specimens in books and coins in which it is the spaces between two petals that are oriented to the points of the compass. This orientation may be due to the ignorance o f the craftsmen who prepared the yantras. Bunce 2001: 28 explains that this latter orien­tation signifies power and the feminine element, but I am doubtful whether it is described in ancient texts. The eight-petalled lotus whose petals do the pointing is a shape which is well suited for positioning deities in their respective directions. This purpose is not served when two petals point in each o f the cardinal directions and none in the intermediate directions. The relationship between direc­tions and lotus petals is borne out by a statement in Maitrayaniya-17 For a recent and detailed discussion of the symbolism of the lotus, see Garzilli 2000; for the lotus motive in architecture, see Gutschow 1997: 248ff.18 The symbolic shapes of the elements are classified as mandalas of type 4 in Brunner’s aforementionedclassification of mandalas (see section 1.2).19 See, for example, Saradatilaka 1.23-24, where a lotus with a half moon represents water.a) For a description of the construction of the various shapes of petals, see Bunce 2001:26."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"22GUDRUN BOIINEMANNUpanisad 6.2 which identifies the lotus (of the heart) with space (akasa), and its eight petals with the four cardinal and intermediate directions. Eight-petal led lotus designs commonly appear in the centre of Buddhist mandalas, such as in the mandalas of the eight great Bodhisattvas.21 They are also found on Nepalese coins o f the Malla period22 and on Indian23 coins. An eight-pointed star24 can serve the same ritual function as the cight-petallcd lotus, but is less common.In addition to eight-petal led lotuses, lotuses with two, four, 10, 12, 16, 24, 32, 100, 1000 or more petals appear in mandalas and yantras. The number o f petals is mostly even, but yantras with an odd number o f petals (for example, five) are also found, in which case their directional orientation may not be of any obvious relevance. A special kind of six-petalled lotus is the va/ra-lotus described in the Kubjikamata-Tantra. This is an eight-pet a lied lotus from which two petals have been removed. Its shape resembles a vajra with three peaks on either side.25 Nepalese coins of the Malla period also depict four-petalled,26 five-petalled27 and six-petalled2K lotuses.Some texts prescribe that the lotus petals should have different shapes depending on the purpose o f the associated rite. Thus the petals may be curved along their edges, and with or without pointed tips, and so forth (Torzsok, p. 207).The lotus pattern is commonly found in current ritual practice, for example, in Maharastra. An eight-petal led (astudala) lotus, prepared from grains or coloured powders, frequently functions as a support for ritual vessels. Atop the vessel is ‘a dish filled (with grains)’ (pur- napatra), especially uncooked rice, that serves as the scat of the main deity of the rite. In Nepal, lotus designs can also be found on stones21 See, for example, Leidy/Thurman 1997: 26-28.72 See Rhodes/Gabrisch/f della Rocchctta 1989, Plate 16, nos. 281-285, 289— 297, Plate 17, nos, 298-299, 303-304, 313-318, 327-329, 338-344, Plate 18, nos. 345-346, 361, ctc.23 See Sircar 1968, Plate xxiii, nos. 9 and 10 rev,24 Sec Rhodes/Gabrisch/t della Rocchctta 1989, Plate 29, no. 596 rev., Plate 30, no. 656 rev., Plate 33, no. 825 rev., Plate 35, no, 936 rev,, Plate 36, no, 978 rev.25 For a description and a drawing of the va/ra-lotus, see Hcilijgers-Scclen 1994: 131-132.26 See Rhodes/Gabrisch/t della Rocchctta 1989, Plate 23, nos, 450 rev., 459-465 obv., Plate 24, nos. 466-467 obv.27 See Rhodes/Gabrisch/t della Rocchctta 1989, Plate 22, nos. 438 rev., 444 rev.28 See Rhodes/Gabrisch/f della Rocchctta 1989, Plate 21, no. 418 rev., Plate 22, nos. 445 obv., 446 obv., Plate 35, no. 953 rev."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"MANDALA, YANTRA AND CAKRA23near thresholds, on roads or in public places. These stones, which have been termed 'lotus stones’ by some authors (Auer/Gutschow 1974: 29, 32, 33, 124), serve special functions in the Nevar religious tradition.29A pattern o f nine lotuses arranged in groups o f three placed one above the other appears in several important mandalas. These in­clude the Pancaratra navapadm am andala (see Colour Plate 15), the Saiva navanabhamandala (Colour Plate 18) and several versions of the Buddhist vajradhatumandala,30In the context of specific mandalas and yantras, different inter­pretations of the lotus design and the lotus petals are given. The (most likely seventh-century) Ganesapurvatapaniya-Upanisad, sec­tion 3 gives an interpretation of the constituent parts o f a yantra of Ganesa. The yantra’s innermost ring of eight lotus petals is taken to represent the eight-syllabled gayatri; the adjacent ring o f 12 petals, the 12 Adityas and the vowels; and the following ring of 16 petals, the purusa who consists of 16 parts (kala), and the consonants, Misra 1959: 482-483 interprets an unidentified Sakta yantra as represen­ting the process of creation, and takes the eight petals o f its lotus to signify the five elements, m a n a s, buddhi and ahamkara. Some29 We know of several types of stones with engraved lotus designs. One type is described as a guardian stone (Nevari pikhalakhu, sometimes considered syno­nymous with Nevari chetrapala) in front of thresholds (Gutschow/Kolver/Shrestha- carya 1987: 35, 54-55, 92, 120 and Kolver/Shresthacarya 1994; 101, 209). Accor­ding to Toffin 1999: 42, the pikhalakhu protective stone is considered the abode of the deity Pikhalakhudyah, whom both Buddhists and Hindus identify with Kumara/Skanda. This stone reportedly has different functions in ritual: offerings are deposited on it; it receives worship as part of the marriage ceremony, at which time it may be smeared with cow-dung; or else a diagram may be drawn on it (Toffin 1999: 43). For a photograph of one such stone, see Gutschow/Kolver/Shresthacarya 1987: 120, no. 121. Another type of stone is called chvasa (Gutsehow/Kolver/ Shresthacarya 1987: 35 and Kolver/Shresthacarya 1994: 105). This is a deified stone found at crossroads on which ritually impure (ucchista) objects are discarded (Gutschow 1982: 105). The grandmother-goddess (ajima) is propitiated there. For a photograph, see Gutschow/Kolver/Shresthacarya 1987: 92, no. 14. A third type of stone is called mandalVmamdah (Nevari) because of its mandala-like design (Gut- schow/K51ver/Shresthacarya 1987: 65, 120 and Kolver/Shresthacarya 1994: 258). This stone may be covered with brass.

INIiMANNPancaratra texts identify the mandala with the deity’s body and its constituent parts with the deity’s body parts. Thus the Satvata-Sam- hita (Rastelli, p. 139) takes the lotus to represent the deity’s intellect (dhi = buddhi). The Visnu-Samhita provides yet another interpreta­tion of the lotus, equating it with the deity’s heart,The central lotuses in mandalas or yantras often have triangles and hexagram s inscribed in their pericarps. In a two-dim ensional structure, the lotuses are usually surrounded by a square enclosure, often termed a seat or throne (plilui), adjacent to which may be a corridor or passage (vlthl) for circumambulation (prndnksina). In a three-dimensional structure, the pitha would be the support o f the lotus and project beyond it. Between one and three concentric circles and a square (with often three nested lines) frequently surround the central lotus on the outside. These geometrical structures will be discussed separately in section 2.3 in the context of yantras. In mandala designs, lotuses also appear in combination with Siva’s trident(s).31 A central lotus in a mandala may be replaced by a wheel (cakra)?2 The deities are then assigned to the hub and the spokes of the wheel. A wheel can also appear in combination with a lotus design.331.3,2 The Square GridA common structural device of certain mandalas is the square grid, which may incorporate a lotus design (made of squares) in its centre. Examples of this structure are the bhadram andalas employed in Smarta ritual, which are analyzed in the next essay. The square grid is obtained by drawing a certain number of vertical and horizontal base lines to form squares on a surface. The squares, called pada or kostha, are assembled into different shapes and parts by filling them with coloured powders or grains.

The three lines are identified with sattva, rajas and ta m a s35 and coloured white, red and black respectively from the inside to the outside.36 In addition to these parts, the Hngatobhadras contain one or more phallic symbols (linga) of Siva, which are themselves called Rudra or Siva. Some hngatobhadras contain additional parts, such as a corridor or passage (vithi) for circumambulation which surrounds a throne (pitha) and miniature creepers (laghuvallT) and miniature chains (laghusrnkhala). The characteristic element of the ra m a tobhadras is the ‘seal’ of Rama, which usually consists of the inscribed words raja rama. The ganesa- and suryabhadras feature images o f Ganesa and the sun respectively.1.3.3 Other DesignsThe sarvatobhadra reconstructed by Brunner in this book belongs to a different mandala tradition from the aforementioned sarvatobhadra, and consists o f different constituents. Structurally, the mandala represents a combination of the square grid seen in the bhadra- mandalas and a rounded lotus shape on a throne in the centre. The lotus consists o f the pericarp (karnika), filaments (kesara), petals (patra, dala) and the tips of the petals (dalagra). The throne (pitha) has four ‘feet’ (pada) and four ‘limbs’ or ‘bodies’(gatra), that is, side parts in the form o f the bodies of men and animals (Brunner, pp. 167-168). There is a corridor or passage ( v ith i) for circum ­ambulation (pradaksina) and an outer enclosure consisting of entry and exit passages (dvara). In addition, we find parts called sobha and upasobha 37 and ‘corners’ (k o n a ). Other mandalas, such as theM In architectural terminology, the term bhadra designates an offset projection common to North Indian temple plans.35 This interpretation is also given to mandalas of the Paiicaratra tradition (see Rastelli, p. 139).•v’For the outer square as part of yantras, see section 2.3,8.37 These terms are also written sobha/upasobha in the Pauskara-Samhita (cf. Rastelli, p. 139). For an explanation of these terms, see Appendix 2 to Torzsok’s contribution. Brunner, p. 169 interprets sobha as a ‘door’ or ‘entrance pavilion of the first enclosure of a palace or temple’ and upasobha as possibly signifying a ‘pavilion"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"26GUDRUN BUHMKMANNtirimandala and the navanabliamandala reconslructed in Torzsok (sec her Appendices 1-2 and Colour Plates 16 and 18), feature additional constituent parts. These include door segments termed kantha (the upper part of a door) and npakantha ((lie lower part of a door). The upakantha is also called kapola in some texts.Different interpretations are given to the constituent parts of these mandalas. The Srimandala reconstructed by Torzsok (see her Appen­dix 1 and Colour Plates 16-17) is surrounded by a square with five nested lines coloured transparent, yellow, black, red and white from the inside to the outside. These five lines are identified with the five kala,s which constitute the Saiva universe. In the Pancaratra tradition the mandala is sometimes identified with the deity’s body. Inter­preting one o f these mandalas, the Satvata-Samhita equates the sobhiis with the deity’s organs of action (karana), the upaSobhas with the subtle elements (tanmatra), and the corners and gates with the deity’s sense organs (cf. Rastelli, p. 139). In the Pancaratra tradition the mandala also becomes a representation of the universe, when its constituent parts are equated with cosmic principles and divine powers. Thus the Visnu-Samhita, for example, identifies the five colours used in the mandala with the live elements (see Rastelli, p. 141).1.4 The Question o f the Origin and Date o f MandalasSeveral scholars have suggested that Tantric mandalas arc rooted in Vedic traditions. The layout of Vedic altars is taken as indicative of an early interest in geometric designs endowed with cosmological symbolism (Gaefkc 1987: 153). The method of determining the lines o f the compass for the construction o f sacrificial altars, the consecration of bricks on the surface of a cayana altar by means of mantras and the locating of deities on those bricks arc essential features o f Vedic rituals (Apte 1926: 2-3 ), and aspects of these rituals recur in the practice of constructing mandalas and invoking deities into their parts. The sacred space of mandalas and yantras can be seen as a continuation of the Vedic sacrificial site (Schneideron top o f a secondary door.’ The translation ‘offset design’ for Aoblul and ‘recess design’ for u p a to b h fi is used by P.P.

But the similarities between the two traditions appear to end here. Authors like Mitra 1958: 11238 are going too far when they assume that patterns displayed by yantras and mandalas can be traced back to the Sulba-Sutras of the Vedangas (which prescribe the way to construct sacrificial altar diagrams), since the patterns displayed by Tantric mandalas are distinctly different. So are the mantras and the deities invoked into mandalas and the details of the rites. The problem of the similarities and differences between Vedic and Tantric traditions is complex and needs to be explored in greater detail in a separate study. Such an investigation would have to trace the influences of other traditions on mandalas as well.The oldest Hindu mandalas may date back to before the sixth century A.D. Among the oldest mandalas that can be dated are two types of vastupurusamandalas described in V araham ihira’s Brhat- Samhita. This text is commonly placed in the middle of the sixth century. The two vastupurusamandalas are described in chapter 53, but were obviously not created by V araham ihira but rather incorporated from older unidentified sources. Apte 1987: 141 notes that the first type o f vastupurusamandala is described in the Pauskara-Samhita of the Pancaratra, which he dates to ca. 400 A.D. (Apte 1986: 3, 1999: 18) or at least 450 A.D. (Apte 1987), while M atsubara 1994: 34 assigns the Pauskara to 500 A.D. However, these early dates are highly speculative, the upper limit for the composition of the Pauskara-Samhita being only the tenth century. Moreover, dating a Samhita as a whole is problematic, since these texts were constantly revised and reworked by redactors, Sanderson 2001: 38, note 50 states that he found evidence that the Pauskara- Samhita (along with the Jayakhya-Sarnhita and the Satvata-Samhita) were influenced by Tantric Saiva systems. At this time the complex descriptions of mandalas found in the Pauskara-Samhita cannot be dated with certainty. We do not have clear evidence for establishing dates for the developm ent o f yantras either. Brooks 1992: 34 considers the possibility that the m ost famous o f yantras, the sricakra/M yantra, developed before the sixth century.38 Chattopadhyaya 1978: 80, too, suggests a connection between yantras and shapes of sacrificial diagrams used in the Vedic tradition."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"28GUDRUN bDMNI-MANN2 Ynntrn2.1 General R em arksThe word yantra designates an instrument, machine,'™ mechanical device or appliance (especially one used in warfare), and also a magic diagram.

It is an artifice in which the ground (bhumi) is converted into the extent of the manifested universe,” For two religious etymologies of the word yantra, see the following verses from two different chapters of the Kulfirnava-Tantra.

In contrast, mandalas vary in size and can be large enough to allow for priests or initiands to enter them through doors and to walk around in them, for example, during an initiation (diksa). With the exception of yantras placed below temple statues at the time of their consecration and yantras installed permanently for worship in m athas or temples, and a few other eases,41 yantras are generally mobile, whereas man­dalas are not. While mandalas can employ different colour schemes, the use of colour is less common if not indeed irrelevant in the case o f most yantras. Texts may prescribe that the lines of a yantra be traced with a specific colour, for example, with turmeric or blood, but the space inside a yantra is never filled with colours as it is in the case of mandalas. And while pictorial representations o f deities can appear in mandalas, such images are generally not found in yantras.42 Like mandalas, yantras are believed to be effective only when wor­shipped. However, some texts claim that the act o f merely viewing a mandala43 or drawing or recollecting a yantra44 brings about bene­ficial results. However, according to Kalivilasa-Tantra 7.9cd-10ab and 2 7 .2 lab, worship of a deity in a yantra is n o t recommended in the present ka li era.Based on an analysis of texts of the Trika School of Kashmir, Brunner, p. 162 briefly defines a yantra as a linear representation on a specific surface, such as birch-bark. She adds that yantras almost inevitably have letters, seed (bija) syllables or mantras inscribed in them. Since mantras frequently employ verbs in the imperative to express an order, Brunner suggests the translation ‘coercive dia­gram s’ for yantras. Similarly, Rastelli, p. 142 concludes from her study o f the Pancaratra texts that yantras have inscribed mantras.Another etymology o f ‘yantra’ is found in Kalivilasa-Tantra 33.1:b ijm iim ko n a vijn iiim m yatn a ta s trayate yatah /ten a yantra iti khyiita isananmkhanihsrtah //“Because it with effort protects the knowledge of the angles/corners (of the drawing) (reserved) for the seed (syllables), which (knowledge) came forth from ISana’s (that is, Siva’s) mouth, therefore it is called yantra,”(The form °srta h— the text reads erroneously °sm rtah— can be explained as an example of ease attraction; °srta m is the cxpected form.)41 Sec Rastelli, p. 143 for yantras described in the Aniruddha-Samhita, which are drawn and then worshipped on a platform and are therefore not mobiie.42 The saudarfanayantra (sec Rastelli, pp. 148-150), which is a combination o f a yantra and a figure o f Visnu, is an exceptional case.43 See the Suprabheda quoted in Brunner, p. 175, note 53.44 Sec the description in Rastelli, p. 146."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"30GUDRUN BOllNBMANNAuthors such as Kscmariija,<5 consider il characteristic of certain yantras that mantras arc inscribed in them.

She asserts that mandalas are employed in rituals to obtain the deity’s favour, but without the presence of a magical element.

This section will discuss attempts to classify yantras. Renou/Filliozat 1947-1953, volume 1: 568 attempt to distinguish between two types o f yantras. The first type of yantra is supposed to be purely linear-geometric, and to be employed in temples for purposes of permanent worship. The second type reportedly features a linear design with iconic representations and is used in temporary and individual worship rites. N o examples or further details are given, and in the absence o f explanations and textual evidence this unusual distinction remains unclear.In a book on yantras written for a general readership, S.K.R. Rao 1988: 14-15 distinguishes the following three types of yantras:1. yantras for worship or for actualizing a deity (pujanayantra),2, yantras for magical protection (raksayantra) and2) Meru-Prashtha Yantra: three-dimensional form composed of metal or stone or gcm-stonos and shaped like a pyramid, having a broad base and narrowing gradually toward the top like a mountain (mcru).3) Fatal Yantra: deeply engraved—exactly the reverse of the pyramid yantra.4) Mcru-Prastar Yantra: composed of picces that are glued or welded to each other instead of being one solid piccc.”Metal iricakus supported by a tortoise pedestal are commercially sold in India as kurmaprstha-Mcakras. Brooks 1990: 107 lists only the two-dimensional bhuprastara (‘spreading over the earth’) iricakra as a category along with the fully three- dimensional mcru or sumcru form and the more flattened, elongated kailasa form. Rao 1990: 118 refers to a classification of sricakns into bhuprstha, kacchapaprstha and meruprstha When a cakra is drawn on a flat surface, it is called bhuprstha. When “supported by a dwarf pedestal, raised like the back of a tortoise” it is referred to as kacchapaprstha. When the cakra has the form of a mountain with different elevations it is known as meruprstha. Umanandanatha in his Nityotsava (written in 1745 A.D.), p. 65, 4-9, lists one type of bhuprastara-sricakra in which the lines of the cakra are elevated, and three types of meruprastara-sricakras in which specific parts of the structure arc elevated. Pranavananda <1977>: 35-39 classifies sricakras into the following three categories:1) bhuprastara or bhukrama;2) kunnaprastara or kurmaprstha and3) mcrukrama, mcruprastara or meruprstha.According to this author, the first kind is a Mcakra whose complete design is engraved or embossed. The sricakras of the second type all feature nine triangles in a slightly elevated position. Such a cakra may also be placcd on the back of a tortoise (and hence the name kurmaprastara or kurmaprstha).

The third type of yantra in the first list will be discussed below. The third category in the second list appears to refer to certain Buddhist mandalas (Rao 1988: 27). Even though descriptive details are missing and the categories arc presented in a somewhat unsystematic way, R ao’s classification is helpful, but clearly not sufficient. Rao has pointed the reader in the right direction by taking the ritual function of yantras into consideration when attempting to classify them.Building on Brunner’s and R ao’s work as well as on the basis of my study of Tantric texts o f the later period, 1 would like to suggest the following tentative classification of yantras as a guideline. This classification, according to the distinctive features and ritual use of yantras, is not intended to be exhaustive and may not be applicable to all South Asian Tantric traditions.1. Yanlras which function as supports for ritual implements during a worship ritual, being referred to as ‘yantras for (establishing) a foundation’ (stlm panayanlm),2. yantras employed in a practitioner’s regular Tantric worship of a deity, often referred to as ‘yanlras (which arc supports) for wor­ship’ (pujayantra, pujadharayanira) and named for tlicir presiding deity, for example, ‘yantra for the worship o f G anapati’ (,ganapa iipujayan tra), and3. yantras employed in optional dcsirc-oricntcd rites, which arc performed on special occasions. Yantras used in a special ritual for a certain deity arc included here as well as yantras which are prepared for specific magical rites, and which are often named for these rites, for example, ‘yantra for attraction’ (akarsana-"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"MANDALA, YANTRA AND CAKRA33yantra) (Illustration 1). After the ritual is complete, the instruc­tions may recommend that these yantras consecrated for magical purposes be made into amulets and worn on the body (dharana- yantra) in order to obtain the desired results, such as protection or the acquisition of power and wealth. Among these yantras, the yantras for protection (raksayantra) figure prominently in texts. In the category of yantras for desire-oriented rites I also include magic (number) squares.47 These are diagrams with numbers inscribed, the sum of which remains the same, regardless of the direction in which one adds them up.These three categories are detailed below.2.2.1 Type 1: Yantras for Establishing a FoundationThese yantras feature simple geometric shapes, such as a triangle or a circle. They function as supports for ritual implements, such as lamps or vessels, in special desire-oriented (kam ya) or magical rites. Such supports also figure in the regular Tantric puja, in which they appear to be referred to as mandalas (see Illustration 2).48 Their function can be compared to that of the ‘seat-mandalas’ in Brunner’s m andala classification (section 1.2); however, B ru n n er’s ‘seat- mandalas, ’ which are made of cow-dung and similar materials, are without any clearly recognizable structure.2.2.2 Type 2: Yantras Employed in Regular WorshipYantras o f this type usually feature common geometric shapes, but generally do not have mantras inscribed, at least according to the later Tantric texts that I have studied. However, the deity and her/his emanations are invoked into the yantra with mantras. A few yantras have the names of these emanations or surrounding deities inscribed following the expression ‘salutation to ’ (namah). Regardless of whether the mantras are only used to invoke the deity or whether they are also inscribed in the yantra, they are o f utmost importance. It is for this reason that the Kularnava-Tantra states that a yantra47 For magic (number) squares, sec, for example, the illustrations in Abbott 1932: 515-521 and the discussion in Cammann 1969.4,1 The mandala in Illustration 2 serves as a support for the v a rd h in l'/ v a rd h a n i vessel in a Tantric pujn."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"34GUDRUN BUHNKMANNconsists of the deity’s m a n tra .Y a n lra s employed in regular worship are often made of durable materials, such as copper.In this category of yantras 1 would also include the .sricukra, also called sriyantra. In addition to being worshipped in ritual, this cakra is also visualized and experienced in the practitioner’s body as a manifestation of the cosmic proccss o f creation and resorption with spatial and mantric aspects, as Padoux explains in his contribution to this book.2.2.3 Type 3: Yantras Employed in Optional Desire-Oriented Rites The third category of yantras is required for the performance of optional rites, such as specific magical rites, and they arc often made o f perishable materials, such as birch-bark or paper. These yantras are drawn, according to the instructions, with special writing materials and substances, such as animal or human blood or ashes from a cremation ground. Johari 1986: 63 reports that such yantras may be made from wheat flower, rice paste, beans or (grains of) rice.5\" They may also be incised on more permanent materials, such as metal plates. Discussions of the various styluses used and the materials on which protective yantras can be written are commonly found in texts. The materials are considered extremely important for the success o f the ritual, and correspond to the nature of the rite performed. Thus cruel rites require repulsive materials, and the yantra used in the rite o f liquidation (m firnnn) as described in M ahldhara’s 16th-century Mantramahodadhi 25,56ab and 25.59ab should be written on human bone with certain poisonous substances.General instructions for drawing yanlras for different purposes, including reducing fever, keeping snakes away and countering the effects of poison, can be found in various texts, such as chapter 24 of Laksmanadesika’s Saradatilaka (10th-11th century), which is based4,1 Cf.

Yantras featuring Hanumat are sold in India for the safety of one’s vehicle (vahanasuraksayantra). Other yantras are used for curing diseases at the recommendation of astrologers.52Yantras used in magical rites may be ritually destroyed after their use, inserted into a statue o f a deity that will then undergo burial, or be crushed and eaten, tied to a tree or concealed in the intended person’s home, depending on the instructions.

These lockets can be attached to the necks o f animals, such as cows, for their protection. Yantras may also be attached to protective dolls hung near the entrance to a home or be placed above a door.Yantras employed in desire-oriented rites may be similar in design to the yantras for establishing a foundation (type 1), but they often have mantras inscribed. The mantras can be seed syllables (bija) combined with verbs in the second person singular imperative, such as ‘subjugate’ (va slk u ru), which ask the deity to carry out the magical effects of a rite on its recipient. The centre of the yantra is frequently inscribed with the name of the person to be influenced, termed the recipient or intended person (sftdhya). The place in which the person’s name is to be written is often indicated by the name Devadatta. The recipient’s name is either surrounded by, or its syllables are intertwined with, the syllables of the mantra,Yantras may also contain longer mantras*’ or even well-known hymns (stotra, stud). The composition and ritual use of hymns or devotional poems in praise o f deities has a long history in South Asia. Such hymns arc found in the Purana literature and the Tantras, and in independent collections attributed to sages or seers as well. To reinforce the efficacy of hymn-recitation in bringing about the promised material benefits, the practice arose of reciting hymns a given number of times. This practice is modelled on that o f repeating powerful mantras. In time, hymns came to be regarded as powerful magical formulas. Whereas the shorter mantras may be repeated millions of times to achieve a particular result, hymns are recited at most hundreds or thousands of times. Hymns employed for such purposes include hymns for protection. These hymns often include in their titles such terms as ‘armour’ (kavaca), ‘protection’ (raksa), or ‘cage’ (panjara).

The different parts, from head to feet, are systematically enumerated. For each part o f the body, the practitioner addresses the deity using a different descriptive epithet, which is often connected with the respective body part. The deity’s names are assigned to and ‘deposited’ on the body parts o f the practitioner, and are believed to protect him like divine armour. As well as being recited, these hymns can be arranged in the form of yantras. For those who cannot themselves recite the hymn, a yantra with the hymn inscribed in it is thought to bring about the same beneficial effects as recitation. An exam ple of a yantra in this category is the ramaraksayantra, which represents in a graphic mode the Ramaraksastotra ascribed to Budhakausika.

The hexagram is surrounded by concentric circles and by squares, the first o f which has elaborate gate structures which open in the four cardinal directions. The innermost square contains the text of a version o f the Ram araksa­stotra,57In addition to yantras containing the text o f entire hymns, there are also yantras which are associated with individual stanzas of hymns o f praise. Well-known' examples are the yantras associated with the Saundaryalahari and the Bhaktamarastotra. The Saundarya­lahari is a hymn to the Tantric goddess Tripurasundari in 100 (some­times 103) stanzas, It is traditionally ascribed to Samkaracarya, iden­tified with the Advaitin Samkara. The Bhaktamarastotra by the Jain poet Manaturiga is a hymn to the first Jina Rsabha in 44 stanzas according to the Svetambara version, or 48 stanzas in the Digambara version. Each verse of the Saundaryalahari became associated with a specific seed (blja) syllable, which is inscribed in a yantra shape, such as a square, a hexagram, a triangle, a lotus, and so forth (for example, Illustration 4), Only one o f these yantras has the name of the intended person (sadbya) o f the rite inscribed on it, and only one57 Different versions o f the hymn are presented and dicussed in Buhnem ann 1983.

The mantras often contain second person singular imperative verbs. In a similar fashion individual yantras are also associated with the 47 stanzas of the Jain Kalyanamandiraslotra. The yantras associated with the stanzas of these three hymns were obviously created later, their connection with the stanzas not being evident from the text itself.511The general instructions require that yantras be infused with life in the rite o f pranapratistha, which is also performed on statues o f deities. According to Raghavabhatta’s 15th-century commentary on the Saradatilaka and texts such as the M antram ahodadhi, the pranapratistha rite entails that certain mantras are inscribed in the yantras. These mantras can be seen in some yantras which are prepared on permanent materials, such as metal plates. The two ramaraksayantras reproduced in Buhnemann 1983: 93 and 107 also contain them. The mantras include the syllable hsauh, which repre­sents the soul (jiva) of the yantra; the syllables hamsah so 'ham (“I am that goose”), which represent its life breath (pnina); the vowels i/i, which represent the yantra’s eyes, and the syllables u/tJ, which represent its ears; and the seed syllables lam ram main ksa m vain ya m sam ham lirim am o f the ten directional guardians, beginning with Indra in the east, which represent the heart ( h relay a) of the yantra.

Therefore may the yantra inspire us.”Texts such as B rahm anandagiri’s 16th-century Saktananda- tarahgini, pp. 264, 6ff. also enjoin that certain purificatory rites (samskara) be performed on yantras, just as they are performed to purify mantras.In this section I have suggested a classification o f yantras into three types: 1 yantras for establishing a foundation, functioning as supports for ritual implements; 2 yantras employed in regular Tantric worship; 3 yantras employed in optional desire-oriented rites. The three types of yantras can be distinguished according to their ritual functions. The first and second types have similar geometric designs but usually no mantras inscribed. Yantras of type 2 usually consist of more complex geometric designs than type 1 yantras. Both types differ in ritual function. The first type is used as a support for objects in rituals, while the second type is the main object o f worship. Yantras of type 1 are similar in function to the aforementioned ‘seat- m andalas’ (see Brunner’s category 1 described in section 1.2) and are occasionally also referred to as mandalas (see 2.2.1). But they differ from B runner’s ‘seat-m andalas’ o f cow-dung and similar materials which have no clearly recognizable structure. Yantras of type 3 are used in desire-oriented m agical rites, usually have inscribed mantras and may have unusual designs.2.3 S o m e C onstituent Parts o f YantrasYantra and mandala designs commonly feature a triangle and/or a hexagram, inscribed in one or several lotuses (padma) o f four, eight,10, 12, 16, 100, 1000 or more petals (dala). The lotus petals are often surrounded by one circle or three concentric circles (vrtta) and a square (caturasra) with sometimes three nested lines. In yantras of the Saiva and §akt:a traditions the lines of triangles or a square may be formed by tridents whose prongs project beyond the lines o f these shapes (see Colour Plate 1).The main deity is worshipped in the centre o f the yantra at a ‘point’ (bindu) which may be visible or remain invisible/unmanifest, while his/her retinue is worshipped in various parts of the structure (see Illustration 6).

The most important surrounding deities or emanations are invoked into the parts of the yantra closest lo the centre. One obvious advantage of a yantra compared to an icon is that a yantra allows for the deities who surround the main deily in enclosures (iivarann, iivrti, literally ‘covering’ or ‘veil’) to be worshipped in it as well.The structural elements of yantras vary, as do the interpretations given to these elements. Some important constituent parts are described in the following, together with examples of interpretations from texts. Most descriptions and interpretations of the constituent parts of yantras found in the literature concern the titiymUni or §ncakra, the most important and influential of yantras.'’1Preliminary studies of the constituent parts of yantras are found in the works by A. Danielou. The author’s ‘Hindu Polytheism,’ 1964: 351-354 contains an enlarged and revised version of the scction on yantras printed in Danielou’s older French edition of the book, ‘Le polytheisme hindou,’ 1960: 525-539. Danielou docs not indicate the sources of his interpretations of the yantra designs clearly, but it can be inferred that he draws on articles in Hindi.1'2 In his later work on the Hindu temple (Danielou 1977: 26-28 [2001: 37-38]), the author takes up the discussion of the constituent parts o f yantras once again. Danielou’s interpretations of yantra constituents continue to beU) Special terminology is used in connection with (he Sricnkru. The three circles outside of the overlapping triangles are referred to as throe girdles or belts ( valaya): a point of intersection between two lines is called sum dhi\\ a point o f intersection between three lines is known as m a rm n n ( ‘vital point’), and a point o f intersection between a sa m d h i and m a rm n n is termed granthi (‘knot’); sec Bhaskararaya’s Sctu- bandha, p. 31, 9 and Umanandanatha’s Nityotsava, p. 64, 4 -5.fil Detailed notes on different interpretations that have been given to the constituents o f the Grictikra and a critical evaluation o f these interpretations arc provided by Pranavananda <I977>.“ Dcvaraj V idyavacaspati’s article entitled ‘Tantra mem yantra aur m antra,’ printed in the magazine Kalyfin, published by the Gita Press (Gorakhpur), Sakti ai'ika, 1934: 387-397, is cited in Danielou 1964: 353. The original article does not indicate the sources on which Dcvaraj Vidyavacaspati’s interpretations are based.

Danielou erroneously refers to the author as ‘Kalika-prasada Dabriil’ and specifies the page number as 591. However, the author’s name is Lalitiiprasad Dabral and the article is found on pp. 592-609.

It is often interpreted as the principle from which all form and creation radiates (for exam ple, Shankaranarayanan 1970: 29). Verses 11-12 of the first chapter of the Yoginlhrdaya describe the point as “throbbing consciousness whose supreme nature is light and which is united with the flashing flow [of divine power], the seat (baindavasana) w hich is the [birthjplace of the flow made up of the three m atrka s” (Padoux, p. 241). According to Danielou 1964: 351, the point represents the element ether. The most likely seventh-century Ganesapurvatapa- niya-Upanisad, section 3 equates the central point with the void of space.2.3.2 The Triangle (trikona, tryasra)The triangle is a common constituent of yantras. It can be either downward-oriented or upward-oriented, and less frequently oriented toward the right or left sides.63 The downward-pointing or inverted triangle is known as a symbol o f the female pubic triangle and the female sex-organ or womb (yoni, bhaga)M The letter e is identified with it because of its triangular shape (in certain Indian scripts).65 This triangle is known as a symbol of the feminine in other cultures as well. In Buddhist Tantric texts the downward-pointing triangle is referred to as the dharm odayaldharm odaya, ‘the origin o f existents (dhanna).’*6 This triangle is visualized in sadhanm as the place in which everything originates. The downward-pointing triangle also symbolizes water/ ’7 This symbolic significance is known from other“ Bunce 2001: 28 considers triangles whose apexes point to the left or right sides as constituent parts o f yantras.M See, for example, Jayaratha’s com m entary on Tantraloka 3.94.

D anidou 1977: 26 (2001: 37) further explains the downward-pointing triangle as a symbol of Visnu.Tantric texts commonly describe the reverse triangle, that is, a triangle sitting on its base with its apex upwards, as the symbolic shape of the element fire,'lK The apex of the upward-pointing triangle indicates the direction of the flame. In Nepal, upward-pointing equilateral or isosceles triangles cut into stone or metal are fre­quently seen in shrines and temples. The triangular hole69 is considered a symbol of the Nevar god of music, dance and drama, Nasahdyah, who is sometimes identified with NarteSvara or Nrtya- natha.In connection with the irlcakra, authors such as Bhaskararaya70 refer to the downward-pointing (a d h o m u kh a ) triangles as Sakti triangles and the upward-pointing (urdhvum ukha) triangles as fire (vahni) or Siva triangles. The inverted triangle is also taken as representing prakrti; the upright triangle, purusa (Danielou 1964: 352). Both types of triangles are intertwined in the hexagram (see 2.3.3). In yantras o f Kali, five triangles appear in the centre. In other traditions, triangles are represented with a protruding ‘gate’ on each side,71 These gates are identical in shape with the T-shaped gates o f the outer square o f yantras (see section 2.3.8).The triangle is naturally connected with the symbolism of the number three. Its three lines are usually interpreted as tripartite units (most commonly, metaphysical concepts). Thus Shankaranarayanan interprets the lines of the central or primary (m u/a) triangle (when understood as the ka m a ka la n) in the gricakra as representing the powers (gakti) of will (iccha), cognition (jnana) and activity (kriya) (1970: 37), following an interpretation already attested, for instance, in Jayaratha’s commentary on Tantraloka 3,94.

Chattopadhyaya 1973: 300-301 asserts that not only the triangle inside of yantras but the yantra in general represents the female reproductive organ when he writes: “A Tantrika, w hen he really confides in you, will frankly confess that these diagrams are but representations of the female organ.” In support of this statement, he cites Bhandarkar 1965: 140, who makes the following remark about the ritual worship (puja) o f the Sricakra: “ [The Cakrapuja] consists in the worship of a picture of the female organ drawn in the centre o f another consisting of a representation of nine such organs, the whole of which forms the Sricakra.” In a somewhat generalized statement D. Chattopadhyaya 1973: 301 adds that “there are in Tantrism various yantras... bearing different names... but the essen­tial feature in all of them is the same. It consists in the representation o f the female organ either by the picture of a lotus (padm a) or by the diagram of a triangle, usually by both.” This author is correct when he observes that both the triangle and the lotus are symbols o f the female reproductive organ, and that both are important constituent elements of yantras. But he goes too far when he takes every yantra as a representation o f the female organ. This claim has rightly been challenged by S. Chattopadhyaya 1978: 81, who emphasizes the fact that not all yantras contain triangles.2.3.3 The Hexagram (satkona, sadara, tara73)The hexagram consists o f two equilateral triangles with the same centre but pointing in opposite directions, usually upwards and downwards. The apexes o f the two triangles o f the hexagram can also be oriented to the right and left sides.74 The triangles are shown either lying one on the other or intertwined with one another. The downward-pointing and upward-pointing triangles (see also 2.3.2) symbolize the sexual union o f the female and male principles, of13 The word ‘star’ (tara) appears as a synonym for sa tko n a in Ahirbudhnya-Sam- hita 26,5 and ParameSvara-Samhita 23.29, as Begley 1973: 85 notes.74 For two illustrations, see, for exam ple, E ncyclopaedia Judaica (N ew York: Macmillan Company, 1971), volume 11: 690, Figure 2; and 693, Figure 10."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"44GUDRUN BUHNIMANNSakti and Siva, of water and (Ire,75 In Buddhist Tantrism, the word evam is thought to be represented by two intertwined triangles, symbolizing the union o f ‘insight’ (pnijnii) and ‘means’ (upaya).

Occasionally a six-pointed star7* or a six- petalled lotus, such as the va/ra-lotus, can replace the hexagram in rituals (Heilijgers-Seelen 1994: 131).

In addition, the syllabic vn is the seed syllable o f the word vajra, which can signify the penis (English 2002: 150).77 The symbolic shapes o f the other elements are according to §arad ltilaka 1.23-24: a square with thunderbolts (vajra) - the earth element; a lotus with a half moon - water; a triangle with svastikas - fire; a circle with six dots, that is, a hexagram - wind; and a circle - ether,n For Nepalese coins of the Malla period showing the six-pointed star, see Rhodes/Gabrisch/[‘ della Rocchctta 1989, Plate 31, no, 724 rev., Plate 33, no. 826 rev.w For interpretations of the sa tk o n a current in Nepal, sec Joshi 1981 and Deep 1993: 98-100.

Pahcaratra Samhilas interpret the three nested lines o f the outermost square as representative of the three constituents (guna) o f primary matter (prakrti) in the Samkhya system, namely saliva, rajas and lamas. This interpretation is also attested for the three nested lines of the outer square of the bhadram andalas of the Smarta tradition, which are white, red and dark and symbolize respectively saliva, rajas and lamas.VH The square also appears on Nepalese coins of the Malla period.4''Influenced by C.G, Jung, Dehcjia 1986: 42 would have us recognize the mediaeval alchemists’ motif of the ‘squaring o f the circle’ ( quadratura circuit) in South Asian mandalas and yantras which feature a circle surrounded by a square. Such an interpretation docs not find support in the South Asian traditions. Moreover, in mediaeval European drawings of this m otif the square always touches the circle. In contrast, South Asian mandalas and yantras show a significant gap between the circle and the square that surrounds it.Gupta 1988: 39-41 offers the hypothesis that the square enclosure of mandalas represents a Tantric analogue to the sacred fire altar and thus has Vedic origins (see section 1.4).2.3.9 Other Structural ElementsIt is not possible to survey all constituent elements of yantras, which include shapes such as the heptagon.1™ One unusual design is found in a yantra of Guhyakall from Nepal (see Colour Plate 1).

In this function, the wheel can either substitute for a lotus or appear in combination with it (cf. section 1.3.1).2. The term cakra can refer to a group or circle of deities invoked into a mandala or yantra structure.3. Some later authors appear to use ‘cakra’ synonymously with ‘yantra’ and ‘mandala.’ 1054. The word cakra also refers to a diagram/tabular device employed in ritual.5. A well-known use of the word cakra is with reference to the ‘wheels’ or ‘lotuses’ believed to be located in the human body.In the following, only the meanings 2, 4 and 5 are discussed.3.1 Cakra as a Circle o f DeitiesThe term cakra refers to a group of deities invoked into a mandala or yantra.106 At the same time, the term also denotes the support for these deities in the form of a specific surface.\"1' This is most likely the reason why the word cakra appears synonymously with yantra and mandala in later texts— a use of the term that requires further investigation. It also explains why the parts of the .tiicakra, which consist of a variety of shapes such as triangles and lotus petals, are referred to as the nine cakras.1115 See Brunner, p. 163 and Padoux 1987a: 4, Torzsnk, p. 181 expresses some reservation about the intcrchangeabilily o f the terms cakra and m andala in early £aiva texts. The Srividya’s synonymous use of the terms cakra and yantra in the iricakral iriyantra indicates a looser use o f these terms (cf. Sanderson's remark in Padoux 1986; 33).

They are referred to either as ‘w heels’ (cakra) or as ‘lotuses’ (padm a).m In some systems these cakras have lotus shapes and are populated by deities. The lotuses may also have inscribed geometric figures (triangle, hexagram). The number of cakras and their location in the body varies according to traditions.

It draws on my observation of rituals in that part of India as well as on the study of ritual manuals, This paper is divided into two parts, Part one is designed to introduce the reader to common structures o f mandalas and yantras in the Smarta tradition. As an example of an early mandala-like structure, the baliharana- cakra o f the vaisvadeva rite is described. This opens the discussion on the directional orientation and basic designs of mandalas. Descri­bing specific mandalas and yantras currently used by Smarta Brahmins, I analyze the navagrahamandala, the saptasatlniahayantra (which originally belonged to the Sakta tradition) and the rudrapitha- mahayantra. Part two of this paper describes a category of mandalas called bhadramandalas.Initially a brief explanation of the word Smarta may be in order, Smarta is a rather loosely used term which refers to a Brahmin who is an ‘adherent of the Srnrti’ and of the tradition which is ‘based on the Smrti.’ The Smarta tradition considers itself to be based on the Vedic heritage and the ancient orthodox texts in the Vedic tradition, such as the Dharmasastras and the Smrtis. It claims to be neither exclusively Siva-oriented (Saiva) nor exclusively Visnu-oriented (Vaisnava), and often combines the worship of five deities,1 Despite the rejection o f Tantric elements in rituals by some Smarta1 For a discussion of the term Smarta and of the Smarta tradition, see Buhnemann 2 0 0 3 ."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"58GUDRUN BUI INHMANNauthorities,2 the Smarta tradition has incorporated such elements, including yantras.2 The M andala-likc Arrangem ent in the linlilm vnncakraThe baliharanacakra* or balihamnamandala appears to be among the earliest mandala-likc arrangements of the Smartas. In current ritual practice o f Maharaslrian Rg-Vcdins, it is a circular arrangement formed by food offerings (bah) (see Colour Plate 2) placed on the ground in the bhutayajha, pitryajha and m anusyayajha rites. These three rites arc variously considered parts of, or appendices to, the vaisvadeva * rite. The vaisvndcva, which is a ritual offering of cooked food before eating, is prescribed twice daily, in the morning and in the evening. There is little difference between these two ritual procedures, In current M aharaslrian practice, the cooked food, usually rice, is divided into three portions. The offerings from the first portion of food are made to the sacred domestic fire to deities as part o f the sacrificial worship of deities (dcvayajha) of the vaisva­deva rite. The offerings o f the second and third portions of food are balis, that is, offerings made outside the sacred fire. They are placed, strewn or thrown on the ground. Bali offerings arc made to deities and other beings as part of the sacrificial worship of beings (bhuta- yajha), and to the ancestors as part of the sacrificial worship o f ancestors (pitryajna). The final offering forms part of the honouring of guests (m anusyayajna), The ten deities worshipped as part of the devayajna are identical with the first ten of the group of 32 deities,52 The nyasa rite, for example, which forms part of the current Smarta puja, is rejected by some as Tantric; see Biihnemann 1988a: 12!.3 In the previous essay the terms mandala, yantra and cakra are discussed. Section3 deals cspccially with the meanings o f the word cakra. The term cakra in the com ­pound baliharanacakra appears to refer both to the circular layout o f the offerings o f rice which arc placcd on the ground and to the group of deities and other beings who are invoked while setting down the offerings. In some texts the term baliharana- m andala is used synonymously with baliharanacakra but is more appropriate in the context of the Yajur-Vcda tradition in Mnhiirastra, where its layout is square. In that tradition fewer deities arc invoked and some o f their names vary.4 For details on the vaiSvadcva ritual as it is dcscribcd in ancicnt texts, sec Kane 1968-1977, volume 2: 741-748, and Gonda 1980: 417-418.5 I follow here the text printed in R gvcdiyabrahm akarm asam uccaya, fols. 29a.l0-30b.3.

This clockwise m ovem ent represents the usual order o f m ovem ent in rituals, counter-clockwise movement being used, for example, in rites for the dead.In the mandala-like structure of the baliharanacakra, offerings are placed in a circle, attention being paid to directional orientation.

The pancayatana worship focuses on the icons or aniconic representations of five deities, and became popular in the mediaeval period. In modern times, the five deities are the Vedic sun god Surya; the goddess called Devi or Durga; Visnu; the elephant-headed Ganesa (Ganapati); and Siva (MaheSvara). In earlier sources we find evidence for the worship of Brahma instead of Durga or Ganesa. Worshipping these five deities is referred to as the five-fold worship (pahcopnsana), or the puja of the five shrines (pahcayatanapuja). The concept of the five-fold worship is also reflected in temple architecture. Pancayatana temples in North India9 place the main deity in the centra! shrine and (bur subordinate deities in smaller shrines at the corners of the square. In domestic worship, the positions of the four other deities vary with the central deity10 (see Illustration 2). A contemporary tivapanciiyalana in a Maharas- trian home, for example, may feature a sivalihga in the centre and the icons of Balakrsna (representing Visnu), the sun, Ganapati (a red stone) and the goddess (a ‘metallic’ stone) respectively in the north­east, south-east, south-west and north-west (see Colour Plate 3). W hen GaneSa occupies the ccntrc, Visnu, Siva, Surya and the goddess will be placcd respectively in the north-east;, south-east, south-west and north-west.It is remarkable that in this pattern one deity is positioned in the centre and the four others in the intermediate rather than the cardinal directions, as is commonly seen in mandala-like structures. Perhaps the practitioner wanted to be able to face all the deities at the time of worship. One should keep in mind that the four deities who are worshipped along with the central deity arc not considered to be9 For a study o f pancayatana temples in North India, see Reitz 1998.10 The arrangement o f the deities in domestic worship follows patterns prescribed in a stanza which has been attributed to Bopadcva’s YamalaprakiiSa and is cited in many texts, such as MitramiSra’s Pujaprakasa, Kamalakarabhattfi's Nirnayasindhu and contemporary ritual manuals.

The lotus pattern and the symbolism of the lotus have already been described in section 1.3.1 of the previous essay. In this structure, the main deity is positioned in the centre and the surrounding (avarana) deities are placed on the petals, and sometimes also on the filaments o f the lotus. The surrounding deities are positioned in the four cardinal and intermediate directions, and occasionally they are also placed at the zenith and nadir o f the mandala. The zenith and nadir are then indicated by special markings placed near two o f the intermediate directions in the mandalas. The surrounding deities may form one or several circles around the central deity, following the common concentric pattern. Frequently the deities are not invoked into icons but into areca nuts (puglphala), which are readily available and can be used repeatedly.A commonly employed mandala with an interior lotus design in the contemporary Maharastrian Smarta tradition is the navagraha­mandala, which features the nine heavenly bodies. The navagraha­m andala is constructed and worshipped to propitiate the evil con­stellations of heavenly bodies and to remove obstacles. It is em ­ployed in the gralm makha or grahayajna, the ‘sacrificial worship of the heavenly bodies,’ a preparatory rite preceding major rituals, such as the vastuSanti or the life-cyle rituals (samskara) . 11In this mandala, each heavenly body (graha) is typically repre­sented by a specific symbolic shape and is prepared from grains or coloured powders. The grains used for each shape may be a different colour.

The eight-petalled lotus with its petals pointing in the directions is especially well suited for placing the deities in their respective directions. The group of eight (and some­times ten) directional guardians is also invoked into parts of the outer structures of other yantras, such as the two yantras described below.5 Yantra StructuresI will now address the structure o f two yantras, the saptasatl- mahayantra and the rudraplthamahayantra, in some detail. Both yan­tras belong to the category of yantras which are employed in optional desire-oriented rituals (see type 3 described in section 2.2.3 of the previous essay).5.1 The SaptasatimahayantraThe durgasaptasathnahayantra, abbreviated saptasatim ahayantra, is a yantra which originally was exclusive to the Sakta tradition. It is comparatively well known in Maharastra and is printed in the Rg- vediyabrahm akarm asam uccaya, the manual com m only used by priests in the Rg-Vedic tradition (Illustration 4).13 The yantra became increasingly important as the popularity of the Durgasaptasatl (also called Devimahatmya or Candi) grew. This text eulogizes the deeds o f Durga in approximately 700 stanzas. It dates back to ca. 500-600 A.D. and is attributed to the M arkandeya-Purana. The yantra is employed in the ritual worship o f the goddess known as candlyaga, especially for Durga worship during the Navaratri festival.Although used by Smartas, the yantra shows typical Tantric elements both in its structure and in the use o f the seed (blja) syllables inscribed in it. As noted in section 2.2.3 o f the preceding essay, yantras em ployed in optional desire-oriented rites often contain seed syllables. These are one-syllabled mantras frequently derived from the first letter of a deity’s name to which a nasal sound, the anusvara or anunasika, is added. A total of 85 deities are invoked13 For a simpler version of the yantra, cf.

BHADRAMANDALAS 11 IntroductionBhadramandalas are square-shaped mandalas that are divided into a grid of squares.2 Specific shapes are traced within the framework of these squares. In the course o f the ritual, deities are invoked into different parts of these shapes, The mandalas are used mainly as supports (pitha) for vessels (kalasa). The vessels function as seats for icons of deities. The bhadram andalas are employed mainly in the concluding ceremonies of religious observances (vratodyapana). It is believed that a ritual performed without the support of a bhadra is fruitless, whereas a ritual employing such a support is thought to yield excellent results (Bhadramartanda, fol. 2a.5-6). The con­struction of the b h a d ram andalas is still alive in M aharastra and described in ritual handbooks of priests. In the following I will explore the different types and structures of these mandalas. My main textual source here is the 19th-century Bhadramartanda written by Harikrsna, a text which has not been analyzed previously. M ost3 o f the mandalas found in the printed edition of the Bhadramartanda have been reproduced in this book.1 In my paper entitled ‘Bhadramandalas in the Ritual Practice,’ published in the W iener Zcitschrift fiir die Kundc Siidasicns in 1987, 1 discuss sarvatobhadras and several types of lingatobhadras, the deities invoked into them and the ritual em ploym ent o f the bhadram andalas. The paper includes diagrams o f m andalas and photographs o f stages in their construction, together with translations o f text passages and num erous rcfcrcnccs in the notes. This inform ation has not been duplicated here. While the earlier paper refers only briefly to some modifications of these mandalas, such as the ram atobhadras, these modifications are described here in greater detail. Thus this essay complements my earlier paper.2 The square grid is described in section 1.3.2 of the previous essay.3 The printed edition docs not illustrate all m andalas described in the text. Illustrations of m andalas 36, 38, 5 3-65 are missing. Moreover, som e m andala drawings arc incomplete (24-25, 39-40 and 50-51) and have therefore not been rcproduccd in this book."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"74GUDRUN BUI INKMANN2 The Bhadramartanda and its A uthorThe Bhadramartanda (BM) is, to my knowledge, the most com pre­hensive compendium on hhadram andalas. The text describes as many as 76 bhndras, which are to be employed by the ‘followers o f the Veda’ (vaidika).The BM forms chapter (adhyaya) 17 of the sixth skandha o f the Brhajjyotisarnava, written by the astrologer (jyotirvid) Harikrsna in 1871 A.D. Harikrsna’s father was Vehkatarama, an m id Icy a Brahmin of Gujarat of the audicya-sahasra branch who resided in Aurangabad. Venkatarama belonged to the vajasancya-sakha of the White Yajur- Veda and the gautania-gotra.To date, only parts of the comprehensive Brhajjyotisarnava have been printed by the VehkateSvar Press (also known as Khemraj Sri- krsnadas). The printed parts o f the text include the B atuka- bhairavopasana (Bombay 1909), the 124th adhyaya in the dharma- skandha o f the work; the CakravalLsamgraha (Bombay 1900), inclu­ded in the sixth skandha; the KridakauSalya (Bombay 1901), the 20th adhyaya in the sixth skandha, the Hanumadupasana (Bombay 1899), the 114th adhyaya of the upasanastabaka in the eighth skandha; and the Durgopasanakalpadruma (Bombay 1907), the 128th adhyaya in the eighth skandha. Harikrsna is also the author of the Karttika- masamahatmyatika and the VaiSakhamasamahatmyatika.Although Harikrsna’s compilation is recent, descriptions of most o f the mandalas included in the BM can be traced back to older sources, such as the vratakhanda of Hemadri’s Caturvargacintamani (ca. 1260-1270 A.D.), the manoharakiinda of the Anandaramayana (AR) and to several other texts on vra/as and dharma.4 Among these texts, the A R5 is the most important source for the BM. Bulcke 1962: 73 assigns this text to ca. 1500 A.D. According to Raghavan ( t) 1998: 121, the AR was most likely produced during the Maratha rule4 Harikrsna names the following texts as his sources: the <A nanda->Ram ayana; the Vrataraja; the Santisara; the Taltvasagara-Samhita; 'the Pancaraira;’ H cm adri<‘s vratakhanda in his Caturvargacinlamani>; ‘the Puranas,’ cspccially ‘the Skanda’ and ‘the Laiiiga;’ the Mandalasamgraha; ‘the Tantras,’ cspccially the Rudrayamala; the Rudrapaddhati, a text that may be identical with the M aharudrapaddhati, or the Rudranusthanapaddhati (Aufrccht !: 530), which was authored by Narayanabhatta, son o f Ramc£varabhatta; and the ‘K aum udi,’ which may be identical with the Vratodyapanakaumudl.5 For a summary o f the narrative contents o f the AR, see Raghavan (f) 1998: 72-124."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"MANDALAS AND YANTRAS IN SMARTA RITUAL II75in South India, between the end of the 17th and beginning of the 18th centuries. This later date is more likely. Several of the mandalas Harikrsna describes are detailed in contemporary ritual handbooks of priests in Maharastra, and are currently employed in rituals.3 The Structure o f the Bhadramartanda and its M andalasThe BM has been out of print for a long time and it is difficult to obtain copies. The work, comprising 36 printed folios, is written in verse with occasional brief prose explanations. M ost verses consist o f quotations from other texts. The work begins with a general section that provides definitions and explanations (paribhasa), and then proceeds with technical instructions for drawing the mandalas. The 76 bhadras described in the text are divided into the following main categories:1) sarvatobhadras2) lihgatobhadras for Siva, including bhadras for GaurT3) bhadras for Rama4) the pancabhadra5) bhadras for Surya6) the bhadra for Ganapati/Ganesa7) the cakraravindamandala8) the svastikamandala.A complete list of mandalas described in the BM is found in the appendix at the end o f this paper.Sarvatobhadra means ‘auspicious from all sides’6 and most likely refers to the symmetry of the mandala design.7 The name has beenDakshinaranjan Shastri 1940: 171 translates the nam e as ‘beautiful in every a s p e c t,’ Brunner, p. 167 as ‘thoroughly au sp icio us’ and Rastelli, p. 124 as ‘auspicious in every w ay.’7 Sarvatobhadra is also the name o f a bandha composition in literature, in which verse quarters can be read in all four directions, forwards, backwards, horizontally and vertically. As Licnhard demonstrates, names o f bandhas can be traced back to certain army formations (vyu h a ), A sa rv a to b h a d ra v y u h a can attack an enem y from all sides (Lienhard 1997: 346, 350, 351). For a drawing of a sarvatobhadra stanza, sec Licnhard 1997: 353. The term sarvatobhadra is used in architecture to denote a house with a veranda all around (Brhat-Sarnhita 53.31) and a type of temple (Brhat-Sarnhita 56.18, 56. 27). In town-planning the term refers to an oblong or square­shaped town.

For example, the variations of this mandala in the BM differ from descriptions in some other texts,” for example, the sa rva to b h a d ra according to the third chapter of the Saradatilaka, which Brunner reconstructs in her contribution. The sarvatobhadra, o f which four types are explained in the BM (Illustrations 1-4), is the most versa­tile o f all the bhadras in application. It can be employed in all the religious observances (vra/a), regardless of whether the principal deity is Visnu, Siva or another deity. But it is believed to be particularly well suited for Vaisnava rites. One type of sarvatobhadra described in the BM (Illustration 3) is an eight-petalled (astadaia) lotus, which functions as a substitute for a bhadramandala.The terms lihgatobhadra, ramatobhadra and so forth are derived analogically from the term sarvatobhadra. The term Iihgato<bhadra>, ‘<auspicious> because of a lih g a /lih g a sis used synonymously with lihgasamudbhava, ‘<auspicious(ness)> arisen from a lihga/lihgas.'’The lihgatobhadras described in the main section of the BM fall into many subcategories. The subcategories are named according to the number of phallic symbols of Siva (lihga) they depict, ranging from one to 1,008. In addition to their number, the arrangement o f the lingas within the mandalas is significant, as is the number of lines drawn while constructing the mandalas. As one would expect, the lihgatobhadras are employed in vratas connected with deities of the Saiva tradition. Three lihgatobhadras that are named gauritilaka 9 (Illustrations 5-7) are prescribed for vratas connected with Siva's* For other types o f sarvatobhadra, sec the references in Biihnemann 1987: 43, note 2 and, in addition, the colour diagram in Banerji 1978: 17(H- and the line drawing in V.V, Dwivcd/J, Pandey/S.S, Baluilkar (Bharatiya Tantra&istra, Sarnath, Varanasi: Central Institute of Higher Tibetan Studies, 1995): 682.

Combinations of the sarvato- bhadra and the lingatobhadra are frequently termed harihara(atma- kajlihgatobhadras, ‘lingatobhadras (consisting) of Hari and H ara’ (for example, Illustrations 19-21). The sarvatobhadra, which usually appears in the centre of these mandalas, represents Hari/Visnu, while the lingatobhadra on the outside represents Hara/Siva. The harihara- Ungatobhadras can be employed in both Vaisnava and in Saiva rites. Lingatobhadras are also combined with the auspicious svastika symbol. Five additional lingatobhadras, which are used on special occasions, such as festivals, and in rites performed for the attainment o f specific goals, are described separately in the final section o f the BM. The total number of lingatobhadras described in the text is 41.The 25 bhadras for Rama, called ram atobhadras, ‘auspicious because of <the ‘seal’ of > Rama,’ are employed in rituals for Rama and Visnu. They are mandalas inscribed with one or several ‘seals’ (m udra). ‘The seal’ is defined as the words raja rama (‘King Ram a’) (see Table, Figure 9), or, in reverse order, rama raja. The bhadras for Ram a may also be inscribed with the name (naman) rama rama. In such cases, they are classified as ramanamatobhadras (cf. AR, m a n o- harakanda 4.49-45). Alternatively, they can be inscribed with the nam es rama ram a, in which rama refers to R am a’s wife. Some bhadras are inscribed with the seal raja rama together with lihgas. These bhadras are termed ramalingatobhadras (see Colour Plates 6 -7) .10 Various bhadras for Rama, such as ramatobhadras and rama- Jihgatobhadras, many of which contain a sarvatobhadra in their centre, are elaborately described in sargas 4 and 5 of the m anohara- kanda o f the AR. Combining a ramamudra and a sivalihga in the same mandala poses no doctrinal problems. Rama is said to have worshipped Siva and established lihgas (cf. AR, sarakanda 10.124), which are often called ramalihgas in M aharastra and Karnataka. Siva, on the other hand, is said to utter a ram am antra called tarakamantra for the benefit of those who pass away in Varanasi. AR, rajyakanda 18.19 refers to a stone inscribed with the ramamudra in Ramanathapura, a site close to Ramesvara.

In the AR the power o f the ramamudra is eulogized repeatedly. When a mandala that combines ramamudras and sivalihgas is employed for the worship of Rama, the ramamudra becomes the object of worship and the lingii/Siva acts as the worshipper.\" But when the same mandala is used in a ritual worshipping Siva, the Hnga becomes the object of worship, and the ramamudra, the worshipper. A ramatobhadra is employed in rites for Visnu, while a ramalingatoblmdra is suitable for either Visnu or Siva. A bhadra inscribed with the ‘seal’ rama rama is used for the goddess.'2Two types of suryabhadras (Illustrations 67-68) are described for use in vratas connected with the sun. Bach one contains 12 images o f the sun, 12 being the number that symbolizes the sun, since it corresponds to the 12 months of the year and the 12 zodiac signs. The two bhadras differ in the number of lines drawn and in the way the icons are placed. The bhadra (Colour Plate 10) from Rajasthan can be identified as the suryabhadra with 20 lines corresponding to Illustration 67 from the BM.The BM describes only one bhadra for Ganapati/Ganesa (see Illustration 69). It is a bhadra with a total of five icons of Ganapati, four in the cardinal directions and one in the centre (see Colour Plate8 ).13 But we know from other texts that several other types o f ganapatibhadras exist.1'1 One o f these features 21 icons o f Ganapati, 21 being an important number in the worship of the deity (see Colour Plate 9).11 Cf. AR, m anoharakanda, 4.6 and 5.90cd-91ab,12 Cf. AR, m anoharakanda, 5.375; BM, fol. 3a.8-9,13 The mandala is rcproduccd from GancSkoS (edited by A. Gadgil, Pune: §rtram Book Agcncy, 1981): 477. The ganesabhadra rcproduccd in the BM features four icons of GaneSa in the cardinal directions but no icon (only a lotus) in the centre. This ganesabhadra is rcproduccd in colour in S.D.

The svastika also appears in other mandalas, such as some lingatobhadras in combination with lingas, lotuses or other symbols. It is an ancient auspicious symbol which Auer/Gutschow 1974: 22, 38 consider an abstract form of a m andala whose ‘arm s’ establish the unity of the m andala’s four parts.4 C onstituent Parts o f the BhadrasBhadras are constructed by drawing a certain number of vertical and horizontal base lines (reklia) that form square grids. The squares are called pada or kostha (see Table, Figure 1). The mandala is made up o f padas that are assembled to form different shapes. The sarvato­bhadra usually has the following parts (see Table, Figures 2-9):‘enclosure’ (paridhi) (Figure 2)‘w ell’ (vapi) (Figure 3)15 A more complex mandala of this type is the cakrabjam andala. The Pauskara-Sarnhita, which contains a description o f the mandala in chapter 8, stales in verse 2ab that multiple variants o f this mandala exist. For a description o f the c a k ra b ja ­m a n d a la , see Padma-Samhita, ca rya p a d a , chapter 2. The mandala is discussed in volum e 1, Appendix 10: 53-54 o f the edited text (with references to parallel texts) and in volume 2: 569-571; sec also Colour Plate 14 in this book (reproduced from a plate inserted in the back o f volume 1) and the sketch in volum e 2: 568. Another variant o f the mandala is reproduced in the appendix to G u pta’s translation o f the Laksm l-Tantra (= Diagram IV); in the mandala reproduction the tips o f the lotus petals are not oriented to the points o f the compass. G upta’s diagram is reprinted in black and white in Khanna 1979: 93. For a sketch o f a som ew hat different cakrabjam andala, see Rao 1988-1992, volume 5: 27.

The number o f lingas ranges from 1 to 1,008, Other constituent parts found in some lihgatobhadras are a passage (vith i) for circumambulation, which surrounds a throne (pitha), miniature creepers (laghuval.lt) and minia­ture chains (laghusm khahi).19As noted before, a ramatobhadra may contain lingas and/or a sarvatobhadra, but it mainly depicts the ‘seal’ of Rama (Table, Figure 9), usually the words raja rama. The gancsib and suryabhad- ras feature images of Ganesa and the sun.The parts of the mandala arc usually one of five colours:20 the enclosure is yellow; the well, white; the bhadra, red; the creeper, dark green/blue; the chain, black; and the crescent moon, white. On the outside, the mandala is enclosed by a square with three nested lines which are named after the three constituents (guna) of primary matter (prakrti) in the Samkbya system: sattva, rajas and tamas. These lines are coloured white, red and black in accordance with the symbolism of the gunas. The lotus in the centre of the mandalas often has a yellow pericarp and while petals, while the lingas are black and the ramamudra is white.The BM recommends that one construct these mandalas from powders or grains. The grains include unbroken rice grains (aksata) (white), red lentils (red), chick-peas (yellow), black beans (dark) and moong gram (mudga) (Phaseolus mungo) (green) (BM, fol. 3a. 1-2).

This tradition has con­tinued until the present. The size of the mandalas can vary. In M aha­rastra, the bhadras are frequently prepared on a low square table used in worship (caurahga) and are comparatively small in size. After the m andala is constructed, the deities are invoked into areca nuts (puglphala) that have been placed in parts of the mandala (see Colour Plate 12) and worshipped with such offerings as flowers. According to BM fol. 3b. 1, the deities invoked into the ramatobhadras and the lingatobhadras are said to be the same as those in the sarvatobhadra, but other texts appear to differ.21 The group o f deities invoked into the sarvatobhadra is a specific group led by Brahma (brahmadi- m andaladevata)22 After the offerings, a vessel (kalasa) filled with water and auspicious objects is placed in the centre of the mandala; additional vessels may be placed in the four comers. A flat dish filled with unbroken rice grains is placed on top of the vessel, which becomes the throne of the principal deity of the vrata (see Colour Plate 13).In addition to being used in concluding rites o f vratas, a bhadra can be em ployed as a seat for a deity in a p u j a ritual. The sarvatobhadra can be used in the rite of infusing life (pranapratistha) into a statue, in rites for the heavenly bodies (such as the graha- m akha) and in rites of pacification (santi).23 Vergati 1982: 57 reports that in Nepal the sarvatobhadra is covered with a piece of cloth on which a vessel (kalasa) is placed. The mandala is used in the seven- day ritual recitation of the Bhagavata-Purana (bhagavata-saptaha) and in the nine-day ritual recitation (navaha) of the Ramayana and other texts for Rama. As noted above, the sarvatobhadra is employed for rites centring on Visnu, but it can also be used for any other21 For the deities invoked into several lingatobhadras, sec Biihnemann 1987' 5 8 -5 9 ,6 5 -7 0 .

The lihgaiobhadnE arc employed in Saiva rituals, and a subcategory of them, the gaurltilnkas, in rituals for Siva’s consort, Gauri.The tradition o f constructing b h a d ram andalas is still alive in Maharastra and other parts of South Asia, including Nepal, although it is disappearing fast. The time-consuming construction, from the drawing of the lines with the help of threads to the filling o f the squares with powders or grains of different colours, is now often obviated by the use of commercially produced charts, which can easily be called back into service.2'1 Such coloured charts of one or more types of sarvatobhadra, lingatobhadra, grahamandala, ksetra- palamandala and matrkamandaia arc reportedly sold in shops in Varanasi for use by priests. The printing and distribution o f such charts promotes the standardization of certain variations o f these mandalas, just as the printing of a certain recension of a text does.6 Concluding Rem arksIt appears that the Smartas included the bhadram andalas in their ritual practices under the influence of mandala riluals performed by Tantric practitioners and mandala patterns described in Tantric texts. The Pancaratra and the Tantras are referred to among the sources for the BM. One such source may have been the UanaSivagurudeva- paddhati by ISanaSivagurudevamisra, an 11th- or 12th-century Saiva manual of temple worship in four sections (piida). This text describes m andalas nam ed bhadraka, sarvatobhadra, piirvaifkanta (asta- lihgalatapadmavithiprakara), latalihgodbhava, pancabrahmaniandala- gauritilaka, svastikabjadvaya, svastikasarvatobhadra, cakrabja,25 mayacakra and tripuram andala.11' Some of these names are also included in the BM. One can observe structural similarities between some bhadramandalas and the mandalas reconstructed by Apte in his24 Brunner makes a similar observation regarding the mandala tradition in South India (Brunner, pp. 165-166, note 28).25 These mandalas arc described twicc in the ISanaSivagurudcvapaddhati, in two very similar passages.

The sources for this investigation are the Pancaratra Samhitas as far as they have been edited and were available to me.Both mandalas and yantras are diagram-like, often symmetric drawings that are invested with mantras. A mandala, also called pura, ya g a, and cakra,' is usually prepared by means of applying powder upon an immobile place. It serves as a place of worship. The deity is made present in the mandala by imposing mantras that represent him and his aspects upon it, and he can then be ritually worshipped there.A yantra is usually drawn upon a mobile material and can thus be carried around. Mantras are written on it, and the drawing and the mantras form an integrated whole that represents the deity or one of his aspects. Yantras are often used as amulets, which protect their wearers and help them to the fulfilment of their wishes.The Construction o f M andalasBefore drawing a mandala, the practitioner must determine a suitable place and prepare it. The Pauskara-Samhita, which is to a great part‘ I am grateful to Cynthia Peck-Kubaczek for reading the English manuscript and suggesting various corrections.1 For llic usage of the term pura for mandalas, cf. Rastelli 2000b: 375, note 57. The term yaga is used mainly in the Pauskara-Samhita, sec, e.g., PausSj 2.8c, 4.13d, 14d, 96a, 5.5a. If not indicated otherwise, I use the Pauskara-Sam hita’s edition from 1934, as the new edition from 1991 contains only the first 26 adhyayas. The usage of cakra in the sense o f mandala is rare (examples arc Parama-Samhita 7.68b, 8.7c, 8c, Param civani-Sam hita 17.499a, 501a). In the context o f mandalas, cakra more often designates a circlc that form s a part o f a mandala (Jayakhya-Sam hita 30.51c, Parama-Samhita 6.23b, Padma-Samhita, caryFipada 2 5 .134a)."},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"120MARION RASTELLIdevoted to mandala construction,2 provides very elaborate instruc­tions on how this should be done. Places that are suitable for the construction of a mandala arc a mountaintop, a cave at the mountaintop, a pleasant forest abounding with trees and herbs, a lovely grove, a lotus-lake, a rivcrbank, a confluence of two rivers, a ford (tirtha), a temple (dcvatiiyatana), a meeting place (gostha), and a hermitage of Brahmins that is free from evil beings, thieves, diseases, and dangers.'1 In general, these places are considered sacred, and similar lists arc also given for places that arc suitable for worship of the deity’s descents (avafara).4It is important that the chosen place is without any faults as otherwise worship performed there would not bring the desired results.5 Free from any faults means, according to the Pauskara- Samhita, that the place should be provided with auspicious trees, fruits, flowers, soft young grass, tender herbs, and various species of lotuses. It should be pleasant to the touch and be supplied with cooling water, fragrances, and good flavours. It should not be saline, burnt by fire, a meteor or sunrays, or vile-smelling. The place should bestow ease, peace, and delight like the sight of one’s beloved, It should be inhabited by beautiful birds, cows, deer, tigers, elephants, and human beings, and should be free of evil creatures. East of the place there should be a lake, west of it a forest of mango trees, north of it a large thicket and south of it a mountain. Moreover, in the north or north-east of it there should be a well or a water tank. The soil should be even and incl ined to the north-cast, of a single colour and free of serpents and similar crcaturcs. In the summer it should be as cool as the moon, in the winter, hot, and in the rainy season, without moisture,62 M andala construction has been given the same attention in the Pauskara- Samhita as temple construction has been given in the later Padma-Samhita.3 PausS] 2.4-7b.

Other Samhitas, being more realistic, make less heavy demands on the place for a mandala and only prescribe that it should be pleasant, even, oriented toward the north-east, and free from thorns and other faults.7 Even the Pauskara-Samhita concedes that if one cannot find a place with all the described qualities, one can also make do with an ordinary one.xBefore the construction of the mandala, the soil is tested and prepared just as before the construction of a building.9 The Pauskara- Samhita describes several methods for testing the suitability of the soil (bhupanksa), One of these methods is digging a hole and filling it again with the earth taken out of it. The best result is if the earth overfills the hole. It is acceptable if the ground is even after filling the hole, but if the hole cannot be filled with the earth again, the place should be avoided.1\" Another method is to sow a seed. The soil is most suitable if it shoots forth within three days, a medium result is if it shoots forth within five days, the worst if it shoots forth within seven days.11The place is to be worshipped with mantras and oblations and, on an auspicious day, ritually acquired. For this ritual acquisition, one must first distribute bali offerings for the cruel beings who are present there in all quarters, and ask them to go away.12 Then one digs the ground to the water limit and fills it again. After that one grows grass, rice, and shoots of trees. Then one puts a herd of cattle out to pasture for three days. After the three days, the ground is ploughed and filled with burnt bricks. Upon them one scatters gold dust, silver dust, and jewel dust, fragrant flowers, grain, rice, fruits7 E.g., Jayakhya-Samhita 23.69cd, Visnu-Samhita 9.2.* PausS i 2.27.v Cf. PausS] 2.7c—8: “At the beginning, he should test if the soil there, which [he has] exam ined well, is endowed with favourable signs for the sake o f a house o f gods, for the sake o f a village for Brahmins, etc., for the sake o f worshipping ya g a s (i.e., m andalas), for the sake o f a house o f a householder.” (tatra b h u m im p a rlk sy iid a u la k sa n a d h y a m s u la k sita m II 1 d c v a n a m a la ya rth a n i tu g ra m firth a m bralvnanadisu / yajanartham tu ya g a n a m grhartham g rb a m ed b in a m // 8)10 This procedure is meant to test w hether the land is very loose or sandy; cf.

This square is divided into several other squares in which the various elements of the mandala are drawn.17 The preliminary grid is made by means of threads that are besmeared with a substance and thus leave lines on the floor when laid on it. 18 The mandala is drawn by means of strewn powder (rajas). First the lines are drawn, and then the pattern is filled with powders in various colours. 1'7While strewing the powder, one must be very careful lo apply it evenly. The Visnu-Samhita describes in detail how the mandala should be drawn and which mistakes are to be avoided; “Many faults [arise] through protuberances, [lines that are] crooked, [too] thin, and [too] thick, cavities, elevations, irregularities, and holes.

The elevated lines are threefold, namely, equal to the little finger, to the middle finger, and to the thumb. The diminution of the [lines] with regard to the highest, the middle, and the lowest [elevation] should be modified in the order beginning with the lotus.”22The powders used for drawing the mandala are made of various materials such as herbs, jewels, stones, leaves, fruits, seeds, fragrant substances, wood, metals, and minerals.23 The Naradlya-Samhita and the Bhargava-Tantra state in detail which materials should be used for which colours: ground rice or sandalwood powder for white, safflower for red, pure turmeric or turmeric mixed with a bit of white substance for yellow, burnt rice or sacrificial charcoal for black, and green leaves for green (gyama).24 Apart from powder, materials such as whole seeds (mustard seeds, sesame seeds, grain) or flowers can also be used.25 Flowers are especially used for mandalas employed during initiation (dlksa) or a festival (utsava)u211 D rawing m andalas is prim arily a task o f the tcacher (guru, aca rya ), who belongs to the highest level of initiation {cf.

The Pauskara- Samhita, for example, gives a great choice of varying mandalas.27 The mandala that is most often mentioned in the Pancaratra texts is the cakrabjamandala, also callcd bhadrakam andala.2K The centre of this mandala consists of a combi nation of a wheel (cakra) and a lotus (abja) that is then surrounded by three square enclosures with doors in the four quarters. The ccnlral combination of a wheel and a lotus is made up of five concentric circles. The innermost circle is the pericarp (karnika) of the lotus. In the second circle are the lotus’ filaments (kesara), its petals (dala), and the hub (nabhi) of the wheel. In the third and the fourth circle are the spokes (ara) of the wheel, and the fifth circle is the felly of the wheel. In the two inner enclosures around the five circles, there are twelve lotuses each, one in each corner and on the left and right of the doors (dvara). Conch shells (Sanklia) are drawn in each of the corners of the outermost enclosure.29The use of different mandalas in worship effects different results. Thus, the kind of mandala may be chosen according to the result one desires to achieve. The Pauskara-Samhita, for example, distinguishes the mandalas described in it as follows: “The first mandala is known as ‘auspicious in every way’ as it causes prosperity. The second [mandala] is called ‘liberating from sins’ as at the sight of it, the sin acquired in many births comes to an end. The third [mandala] is the ‘good path’ and shows the way of the dharma. The fourth [mandala] is called dharma. On account of [its] worship, it bestows the dharma. The fifth [mandala] is the ‘womb of wealth’ [and] effects the increase of the bhaktas’ wealth.

This is relevant especially with regard to the ritual of the sadhaka who worships a particular mantra or deity in order to gain siddhis. The mandalas used here are specific to the mantras worshipped, and sometimes their shape even corresponds to the mantra that is worshipped in it. Thus, the mandala of the sankha- m antra, for example, has the shape of the conch shell or the mandala of the gadamantra is surrounded by eight maces.32The Use o f M andalasA mandala serves as a place where the deity can be invited and then worshipped.33 In addition to a mandala, there are several other places that can be employed for this purpose. Pots (kum bha, kalasa)y statues (b im b a , pratim a), and fire (vahni, agni) are most often used, but also other places are possible such as the disk of the sun or a rosary (aksasutra).M Often the deity is worshipped in several places one after the other.

Then the practitioner visualizes that the mantras being present upon the mandala enter the gross (sthula) body of the main mantra, i.e., that of Visnu himself.

It was used in diverse rites of the diksa and so the meaning ascribed to it also varied.The Pauskara-Samhita distinguishes four kinds of mandalas according to the rank of initiation.

Through this act, the teacher, who is identified with the deity himself,66 liberates the disciple from transmigration: “Having recog­nized that the devotee is helpless and plunged into the ocean of sorrow, he should draw [him] out by means of the yaga handafraid o f transmigration [and] is truly a devotee o f Visnu, the teacher should be gracious (i.e., perform the initiation for him/her) only with seeds, sesame, and clarified butter [that are oblatcd to the god who is present] in the fire, [and] for [a person] who is deprived of any substanccs, [he should be gracious] only by means o f a word (i.e., a m antra).” ( m ah a m an d a la y a g c n a v itta d h y a n a m tu k a r a y e t 11 4 v itia y o g a v im u k ta sy a sva lp a vitta sya d e h in a h l sa m sarabhayabhitasya visn u b h a kta sya tattvatah H 5 agnau c a jy a n v ita ir bljnih sa tila ih k e v a la ih tatha / d ra vya h m a sya vai k u ry a d vacaivanugraham guru h 11 6) Cf. also Laksmi-Tantra 41,9-1 Ob for a variant o f this passage.

It: is known that this teacher is similar to me (i.e., Visnu).” 67 This procedure is called yfigadiksa, ‘initiation into the yaga (i.e., mandala).’ After it, the teacher destroys the disciple’s past, present, and future bonds68 by sacrificing them into the fire, and causes the disciple to become identical to the deity.m The diksa is completed.After the diksa, the devotees belonging to the various ranks of initiation vary in their worship of the mandala. The sa m a y in only looks at and worships the mandala on the twelfth tit hi of every half (paksa) of a lunar month. After one year he may become a putraka. A putraka should look at, worship and visualize the mandala within his heart for another year. Then he may become a sadhaka. Me should worship and visualize the mandala for three months minus five days. If he is successful in this, he may undergo the initiation for an acarya. After having worshipped and visualized the mandala for four years, he may reach final emancipation.71’ According to the Pauskara- Samhita, emancipation can be attained only by means of mandala worship: “The ocean of wordly existence is not passable by any other [means] than the y a g a ”7'In the diksa according to the Sanatkumara-Samhita, the mandala plays an even more central role than in the Pauskara-Samhita. In this text, ‘one should undergo the initiation’ is expressed by the phrase p ra vised diksam cakramandale, ‘one should attain the initiation in the cakramandala, ’72 which shows the centrality of the mandala in the diksa. The initiation ritual as described in the Sanatkumara- Samhita is very simple.

Then the teacher has the disciple approach the mandala and worship it with offerings of fragrances, flowers, etc. Following this he teaches him the rules that must be observed and makes him enter the mandala. How far he may enter into the mandala depends on his varna and his/her sex. A Brahmin may enter into the inner­most enclosure (prathamavarana), a ksairiya into the second enclo­sure, and a vaiSya into the third enclosure. Sudras and women must stay outside the mandala and are not allowed to enter it. 75 In the mandala, the disciple is told three mantras, a Vedic one (vaidika), a Tantric one (tantrika), and one that is both Vedic and Tantric (vaidikatantrika). These mantras can be used in the various rituals henceforward.76 With this the initiation is completed.In other Samhitas the initiation ceremonies are much more elaborate. In the following description, only the rites concerning the mandala will be discussed. A rite in the diksa that is described very often in the texts is the tossing of one or more flowers, and sometimes also other substances such as fragrances and arghya, onto the mandala. Usually, the disciple is led blindfolded around the mandala and then given two handfuls (anjah) of flowers and other substances, or only one flower, which he must toss onto the mandala. Then the blindfold is removed and the disciple may see the mandala.The older Samhitas do not: clarify explicitly the meaning of this rite. The Jayakhya-Samhita reads: “Having prepared an anjali of flowers (puspanjaii) [for each of the disciples] in sequence, he should have [the disciples], whose eyes are blindfolded as before, toss [the flowers] that are endowed with gold, jewels, and pearls. Then he should unveil [their] eyes and show [them] everything.” 77 The Satvata-Samhita states: “Taking the [disciple] by the hand, he should go near the god’s abode (i.e., the mandala). Having placed [him] on his left side and again blindfolded [his] eyes, he should have [him], who is deprived of [his] eyesight [now], toss a rg h ya [from] the aiijaii. [Then the disciple] may see the mantra’s highest abode, which75 Also the kind o f mandala varies with regard to the disciple’s vam a or sex; cf. Sanatkumara-Sanihila, rsiratra 5.40c-43.7f> Sanatkumara-Samhila, rsiratra 5.30c-4Qb.77 Jayakhya-Samhita 16,217 c - 2 18:k r a im tp u s p a n ja lim krtva baddhanctram s ca p u rv a v a t I I217 ksc p a y e c ca hiran ya d h ya m m a n im u kta p h a la n vita m / udghatya n a ya n e pascfid akhilum sam pradarSayct 1/ 218"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"134MARION RASTELLIbestows the fruit of [the fulfilment of every] wish.”71' The reason for tossing flowers and other offerings onto the mandala may be that the disciple, prior to seeing the mandala, must worship the deity present in it in order to dispose him favourably, and that only then does he grant him his favour. This can be concluded from the Satvata- Samhita’s statement that the mandala that has been looked upon by the disciple, fulfills every wish.A passage in the ISvara-Samhita also shows that the tossing of flowers, etc., brings the disciple into contact with the deity present in the mandala. This contact causes or increases his devotion (b h a kti) and purifies his internal organ (antahkarana) as a result of the deity’s grace: “Me should have him, with a bowed head, toss the a njahYs contents] into the god’s abode. If he sees that [the disciple], whose eyes have [then] been unveiled, who has not been seen by any other person [and] who has entered the auspicious path, [shows] the sign of devotion (bhaktilaksana), which involves bristling of the hair, eagerness, joy, tears of bliss, prostrations, exclamations of ‘victory’(jaya), and circumambulations in [all] quarters (‘Idikpradaksina), [and] if he has understood that [the disciple’s] internal organ is purified, he should recognize that he is suitable. When [all this has happened], then [the disciple] has received grace (anugrhlta) through this (i.e., the teacher’s) thought, which is named Acyuta (i.e., Visnu).”7<) A passage from the Tantraloka, although from the Kash­mirian Trika tradition, may help further to understand the idea that is behind the described ritual.

As described above (pp. 127f), varying mantras are placed on the different constituent parts of the mandala. The mantra that is present on the place where the flower tossed by the disciple falls is then his personal mantra or gives him his name. The Parama-Samhita describes the first variant: “He should blindfold the disciple by means of a cloth, take [his] hand and enter the mandala through its door. He should lead [the disciple around the mandala,] turning their right sides towards [it] and have [the disciple] bow down before the guardians of the quarters. On which flowed' this flower falls by chance, this [flower’s] mantra is for his protection and prosperity. Having effected [his] faculty of seeing [again], he should show him the cakramandala.” K2 Several younger Samhitas indicate that the purpose of tossing flowers onto the mandala while blindfolded is to give the disciple a name (namakarana), Among these texts is the Padma-Samhita, which states: “Directed by the teacher, [the disciple] should toss the flowers onto the mandala. [The teacher] should assign to the disciple the names of the manifestations (m urti) such as Kesava, etc., that are the sovereigns of that place upon which most of the flowers fall of their own accord. The word bhagavata or bhattaraka is to be joined to the end of the name if [the disciple] is am l A 15.451c^t52b. Cf, also Sanderson 1986: 169 and Takashima 1992: 5 If.Sl Obviously, the mantras arc invoked in flowers being placed on the various parts o f the mandala. Biihnemann 1987: 47 describes a similar method using areca nuts for invoking mantras. This passage presumably does not mean that the mandala is m ade o f flowers (cf. p. 123), because the verses Param a-Sam hita 8 .7e-9b prescribe that the mandala is to be drawn with paint in the case o f a sa m a ya d iksa and w ith pow d er during the ta n tra d ik sa (Param a-Sam hita 8.9b tatra d ik s ifa h em. tantradiksitah).10 Parama-Samhita 8.44—46:vastram cka m upadaya sisy a m ba<d>dhva m u k h a n ta re l h aste g rh itva p in v isc t svena dvfirena m a n d a la m /l 44 n itva p radaksinam caiva dikpalan pranipatayet / tat p u sp a m n ip a tct p u sp c y a sm in n cva yadrcchaya 1145 sa m antras tasya raksayam u d ayc ca v id h iy a te / utpadya caksu si cainam darsaycc ca kra m a n d a la tn l/ 46"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"136MARION RASTELLIBrahmin.

This can be seen in the .layakhya-Samhita that prescribes the name-giving ceremony as being at another moment of the initation than that of the first showing of the mandala, and prescribes the ceremony being done with the help of a platform made of earth (sthala) upon which a mandala is only imagined.85 In the Satvata-Samhita, although the name-giving immediately follows the tossing of the puspanjali upon the mandala, the purpose of the tossing act is not to give a name. It is just done on the same occasion. The passage Satvata-Samhita 19.39d-41b quoted above (pp. 133f,) continues as follows: “On this occasion, he should give [him] a10 I.e., a sudra; cf.

Thus, the rite of name-giving originally was not connected with the act of tossing flowers onto the mandala.At the end of this section on the diksa, I would again like to consider the placing of the teacher’s hand on the disciple that was mentioned above (pp. 13If.) as being part of the initiation. This placing of the teacher’s hand can be done either before revealing the mandala to the disciple or after,80 The hand is mentally invested with the deity’s power that is then transferred to the disciple. Investing with the deity’s power is done either by imposing a mantra90 or visualizing a mandala on the hand: “On [his] right hand, he should visualize all principal deities as illuminating [it] by their rays of light [and] being in their respective supreme abodes in the centre of the cakrabja[mandala].

If a mandala is visualized on the hand, it is called yaga hand (i.e., mandala hand; yagahasta)!’2 In both cases it can also be called Visnu hand (visnuhasta) (or Acyuta hand as in the passage just quoted) as in both cases Visnu is present on the hand: “The hand on which Visnu is present is called Visnu hand.”w According lo the Visnu- Samhita it destroys all sins that were ever accumulated: “All sins that were formerly accumulated in thousands of other births are dissolved without doubt by the mere touch.”'M According to the Pauskara- Samhita it liberates one from the world of transmigration (cf. pp. 131 f).All the examples of various Samhitas given show that the mandala plays a central role during the initiation, although its meaning and function vary in the different texts. First of all, the first viewing and first worship of the mandala is the initiation into mandala worship, which is in the centre of the devotee’s religious practice in the Pauskara-Samhita especially but also in other Samhitas. But the mandala as a place of the deity’s presence is also a means for encountering the deity: by worshipping him there in order to dispose him favourably, but also by experiencing his favour by the mere sight of the mandala, by obtaining a name and a mantra that were not chosen by a human being, but by the powers present in the mandala, and last but not least, by the physical contact with him through the Visnu hand.Wl TSvara-Samhitii 21.134c— 136b:sm a rcd daksinapanau tu cakram bunihaniadhyagnm // 134 pradhanadcvatabrndam s v e s v e d h a m n i pare sth ita m l svam aricigancnaisa d yotayantam tu c;lkhi!am H 135 tenacyutakarcim iva sodakcnalabhcta tarn /Cf. also PausS] 1.28 (quoted on pp. 13 I f.), Padma-Samhita, caryapada 2.66-67b, Visnu-Samhita 10.46c-52b, ViSvamitra-Sarnhilii 9,75c~76a.®Cf.

As a place of the deity’s presence, the mandala is considered to be his body and thus, the mandala’s constituent parts are considered to be the constituents of the body. Since the body’s constituents, i.e., the principles (tattva) arising from the primary matter (prakrti), also constitute the universe, the mandala is also a representation of the universe.Such a conception is found in the Satvata-Samhita, which is also adopted by the Isvara-Samhita: “Having thus constructed [the man­dala], he should consider [it] as having the nature of the universe like a body.

The differences noted by Brunner may also apply to Pancaratra, but 1 have not yet found evidence for this in the texts.112 Jayakhya-Samhita 26.97b, 29.96b, 164a, Padm a-Sam hita, caryapada 25.102c32.46b. ’113 Padma-Samhita, caryapada 32.92c, Ahirbudhnya-Samhita 26,3ab, 74cd, 85cd.114 According to Apte 1957 (s .v . g o ro ca n a ), rocana is “a bright yellow pigm ent prepared from the urine or bile o f a cow, or found in the head o f a cow.”115 A q u ila ria a gallocha.

For example, a yantra made of gold, jewels, corals, and pearls bestows sovereignty, or a yantra made of birch-bark and drawn with saffron and sandalwood, when worn on the head, effects the fulfilment of all wishes.IJIAs already mentioned, when a yantra is prepared, drawing the diagram and writing (he mantras are done in a single process. The following is an exemplary prescription for the preparation of a yantra that is used for paralyzing (stambhnna) divine beings: “Furnished with rocana and saffron, he should write [the divine being’s] name intertwined121 with the [mukijiminlrn in the centre of a [drawn] kaustubha that contains sixteen sixteenth parts (knla). Previously each sixteenth part has been provided with nectar,122 o sage. Above the sixteenth parts of nectar he should place [the mulamantra], which resembles the moon’s rays, resting on the viSvapyaya (= la). Outside of the [mulaimmtra], he should draw an eight-petalled lotus with a pericarp. [Then] he should write the god’s ;i/ig;i[jmi/7i'ras] on the petals just as in worship.”12'11The drawing and writing of the yantra are seen as a unit. The drawing is not just a place for making the deity present by means of mantras, but the yantra’s drawing and writing as a unit is a representation of the deity, The deity assumes the form of the yantra.IW Ahirbudhnya-Samhita 26.3.™ Ahirbudhnya-Samhita 26.74c~77.121 There arc several interpretations o f what vidarbha or v id a rb b ita means.

One is called jyo tirm a yl, ‘consisting of light,’ and the other vanm ayl, ‘con­sisting of language.’The first is a wheel (cakra) whose constituent parts are repre­sented by divine beings and their activities. The brahm an is con­sidered as being the wheel’s axle, the sakti as its hub, the saktPs five activities, viz., disappearance (tirobhava). creation, maintenance, destruction, and favour, as its spokes, the Vyuhas and Vyuhantaras as its felly, and the Vibhavas as flames outside the felly. It is obvious that this kind of raksa can only be visualized mentally,126The safeguard that consists of language (v a n m a y l raksa) is a wheel (cakra) whose shape is formed by writing mantras instead of drawing lines. The Ahirbudhnya-Samhita describes several forms of this kind of safeguard.127Nowhere in the Ahirbudhnya-Samhita’s text are these two kinds of safeguards called yantra. The term yantra is mentioned in the title lines of chapters 23 and 24 of the Ahirbudhnya-Samhita and in two subtitles on p. 218 of the first volume of the Ahirbudhnya-Samhita’s edition,1211 but not in the body of the text itself. Thus the two kinds of raksa probably cannot be interpreted as yantras in the actual sense.However, these safeguards, which are very similar to yantras, can help to clarify the meaning of yantra as representation of the deity. Both the raksa ‘consisting of light’ and the one ‘consisting of language’ are direct representations of the divine power, the first having divine beings as its constituent parts, the latter consisting124 Ahirbudhnya-Samhita 47.21 cd:m a d h y c d eva in pratisthiipya yantrarupadharam p ra b h u m //125 Ahirbudhnya-Samhita 47.56d and 65a.]% Ahirbudhnya-Samhita 21,4-29b.127 Ahirbudhnya-Samhita 22-24.I2fl Ahirbudhnya-Sam hita 23 is called vasudevadiyantranirupana, A hirbudhnya- Samhita 24, yanlradcvatadhyiinanirupana."},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"146MARION RASTF.LLImerely of mantras that arc manifestations of the deity and his aspects. These raksiis are not places where the deity can be made present, but they are the deity’s presence itself The same is true of yantras, which, in this aspect, are much more similar lo the two kinds of raksiis just described than lo mandalas.However, seeing yantras as representations of the deity is not the only notion found in Pfulcaratra Samhitas, According to the Padma- Samhita, after the preparation of a yantra, the deity should be invited into it in order to worship him there.I2y Here, similar to a mandala, the yantra is treated as being a place for the deity’s worship.What purpose do yantras have and how are they used? It is often emphasized that mere visualization of a yantra or concentration upon it is enough to reach a certain goal; for example: “Me who recollects it in danger, in a battle, or in a dispute has victory in his hands; here there should not be any doubt.” Or: “This yantra, o excellent sage, destroys all calamities. There is nothing that cannot be obtained by wearing, recollecting, [and] visualizing [it].” 1'10 Also the yantra’s mere drawing can have effect: “Everything accrues to the people through its mere drawing.” 131 In general, however, worshipping it with offerings, oblations and ablutions is seen as the prerequisite for the e ffect of a yantra.112Yantras are frequently worn on the body as amulets, often bound with thread and/or covered with metal. Using them in this way, yantras are considered to protect and to have positive effects: “He should wrap this yantra with a five-coloured thread [and] put it into a golden casket. [If] he puts [it] on [his] right arm ora woman between [her] breasts he/she is liked forever, even among enemies.

This is the dharakayantra, the ‘yantra of the wearer,’ i.e., the wearer of the saudarsanayantra. The power of the saudarsanayantra is considered to be so great that a human being cannot wear it without additionally having a dharakayantra: “[Narada:] ‘Who wears this very wonderful divine ornament? If it is worn, 1 do not notice the power (takti) of anything. Please remove [my] doubt [that has arisen] on account of its excessive power.’ Ahirbudhnya: ‘Truly, no one can wear this [yantra] of great splendour without [also wearing] the following, other yantra that is full of power, o divine seer. Hear now its nature [and] energy, o best sage.’ The dharakayantra’s most exterior part is the squareearth mandala with the seed syllable (blja) of the earth on each corner and two Nagas on each side.

Generally, such drawings are called mandalas, but also yantras and cakras, with little consideration as to whether these terms are synonyms or not.This paper essentially aims at clarifying this terminology, and this will be done in the first part. In the second part, I will discuss the mandalas used in the cult of Siva: analyzing a simple example, I will describe their general structure and indicate how exactly they are used in the rituals.It is first out of personal interest that I began investigating the subject on which I here report my conclusions. Perplexed, undoub-\" This paper is, broadly, a remake o f an article published in French som e fifteen years ago (Brunner 1986).

Not only did 1 eliminate the oral character o f the presentation, but 1 also modified several expressions that seemed correct in 1984 but that progress in the study of Saivism now shows to be incxact. 1 also reworked some long passages by introducing useful precisions, added many references and inserted some comments in part inspired by the discussion (not reproduced here) that followed the lecture in Paris. It was, however, not possible for me to extend my research. Therefore, works on the subjcct which appeared after 1986 arc not taken into consideration.Note by G. Biihnemann: In this articlc the author uses the term ‘cult’ in the sense of ‘sectarian affiliation’ and lw o rsh ip 7 lritual,’ The word is not used in a derogatory sense."},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"154I IliLliNl.i DRUNNFRledly like many other scholars, by the coexislcnce of three terms that modern authors rarely distinguish and often translate, in English, as well as in French, by the same word ‘diagram,’ I had developed the habit over the years of taking note of the ritual contexts in which those terms appeared. Soon enough, I realized that mediaeval authors did not use the terms so freely as we do and thought that it would be good if we imitated their precision instead of creating confusion where it did not exist by using a single word in our translations (and I also accept this criticism). I was therefore pleased to seize the opportunity provided by a conference held on this theme in Paris in 1984 to expand my research and submit the result of my reflections to the participants. Their reactions inspired some of the additions that I have made to the original French paper.I must insist at the outset on the fact that my research does not cover all Hindu schools, not even all Tantric sects. Rather, 1 limited myself to the following texts:(1) the fundamental texts of the Siddhanta School, 1 those that have come to be called Saivagamas or even simply Agamas (Mulagamas and Upagamas), but could just as well be called Tantras since they often present themselves as such.2 1 looked at1 W c must stop calling this school the ‘Southern School,’ for while it is true that it is the South of India that has kept its heritage alive, wc now know that its most ancicnl texts come from the North (including the pn d d h n ti of Somaiamblui, see my introduction to SP4, pp. xliii-xlv). Wc could call il the £>aiva-Siddhanta School, but since this term was borrowed from the Sanskrit School of that denomination by the Tamil School that followed it and profoundly modified it, and since the name has remained attached to the latter, wc should call il more precisely: ‘Sniva-Siddhanta School o f Sanskrit expression’ or simply ‘Sanskrit Saiva-Siddhfuita School.’ That is what I keep repeating (see, for example, Brunner 1977: 114-1 15 and 1992: 38, note 2). This appellation is here shortened into ‘Siddhanta’ for the sake o f simplicity.2 See, for example, p. xix o f the introduction to my translation o f Mrgcndragama, kriyapada and caryapfida, and more recently G oodall’s introduction to his edition o f the Kiranavrtli, pp. xxxvi-xxxix, It is useful lo note here that, among the Tantras o f the Siddhanta that have reached us, rare are the texts that date from before the ninth century. Except for the Kirana, the Mrgendra and the MatarigaparameSvara, those that were published in India, including those excellently edited by N.R.

The following handbooks, written in the South, depend more or less directly on this work: the Aghorasivacaryapaddhati, called Kriyakramadyotika, of the 12th century; the yet unpublished Jnanaratnavali, the Siddhantasekhara and the Siddhantasaravali, all three probably dating from the 13th century; and finally the Isanasivagurudevapaddhati, a later work which is nonetheless better known since it was edited early in the 20th century and reprinted in 1988;(4) some handbooks from the Trika School, such as the Tantraloka (TA) of Abhinavagupta and the Saradatilaka (ST) of Laksmanadesika.All these sources converge, so much so that the results of my research do not only concern the Saivism of the Siddhanta School, as the title of this paper carefully suggests, but could probably apply to a wider range of traditions. It is not certain, however, that my conclusions could, without further precautions, be extrapolated to all Tantric schools, for example, to Saktism or to Pancaratra, nor to all periods, for example, to the more recent Tantrism.Nonetheless, I should note that the non-synonymy of the terms mandala and yantra is accepted by the Sabdakalpadruma (s.v. yantra) which quotes the following passage from the Yoginltantra,3 where the possible supports for the cult of the goddess are discussed: lingastham p u ja yed devlm pustakastham tathaiva ca / m andalasthani nm ham ayam yantrastham pratim asu ca II jalastham va silastham va pu ja yef param esvarim /3 Text dating from the 16th century (sec G oudriaan in Goudriaan/G upta 1981: 85-86)."},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"156HELENEBRUNNERI. Occurrence o f Ihc Three Terms in (he Ritual TextsA . MandalaLet us now look at the first point, which conccrns the occurrence of the terms mandala, yantra and cakra in the ritual texts. I will begin with the one that is by far the most frequent in the standard rituals: ‘mandala’— a term that wc spontaneously associate with those splendid drawings so characteristic of Tibetan Buddhism and of which we have seen a large diffusion over the last decades.When and how do the Saiva texts use this word? We must obviously set aside right from the start the rather banal meaning of ‘circle’ (construction circle or any other disk) as well as that of ‘territory’ or ‘province,’ with which wc are not concerned here, at least not directly. 1 shall therefore consider only the specific ritual objects that the texts call ‘mandalas.’ All appear as limited surfaces, of which I find three main types:First type: a limited surface deprived of structure.For example: the ‘cow-dung mandala’ enjoined on numerous occasions to serve either as the scat for a god (for example, Nalesvara, when he is called to preside over the dances performed by the Devadasis in front of Siva), for a man (the disciple, before his initiation), or for a revered object (the cooking pot for the deity’s rice, when it is removed from the fire and placed on the ground).4Such mandalas arc made by smearing a generally circular portion of the ground with a semi-liquid paste made of cow-dung or sandalwood. I will call them ‘seat-mandalas.>Second type: a limited surface showing a drawing generally made of the accumulation of coloured powders,This is the most interesting type of mandala, one that we must: most carefully distinguish from those other drawings called ‘yantras,’ because they bear some resemblance. Here are its characteristics:• These mandalas serve as supports for the worship of divinities. They have no other use.• They are temporary, being destroyed once the ceremony for which they were built is completed.4 Sec SP3, Index, p. 737, s.v. “ mandala (qiiclconque).”"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"MANDALA AND YANTRA IN THE SIDDHANTA 157• They are constructed on a plane and purified area, and oriented. The drawing (made with strings and compass) is geometrical; it often shows a central symmetry (or, if one prefers, an axial symmetry, with reference lo an axis perpendicular to the plane and going through the centre);5 and it is entirely covered with coloured powders (three, four or five different colours)— hence the exact name of these objects: rajomandalas/’• Their dimensions are sometimes considerable since they vary, depending on the type or the text, from one to eight (according to the Mrgendra) 7 or even eighteen cubits (according to the Matarigaparamesvara), that is to say from half a metre to about four or even nine metres. The officiant is there described entering and leaving through ‘doors,’ moving around along ‘streets’— instructions that must be taken literally for the bigger structures.Let us go over the first of these characteristics; namely, that these mandalas serve as supports for worship. The way to perform this cult will be described in the second part of this paper, but it will be good at this point to specify the nature of the worship in question. Here the texts from the Siddhanta diverge from those of the Trika. While the latter recommend doing all the cults, including the daily cults,8 on a mandala, the vast majority of the texts of the Siddhanta insist on using the mandala only for the occasional (naim ittika) rituals9— such5 The square mandala, o f central symmetry, with, at its centre, an eight-petalled lotus, is by far the most common mandala, at least in the normal cult of Siva. For the other gods, the mandala may take other shapes. For exam ple, according to the M rgendragam a (kriyfipiida 8.36c-37b), the mandala o f Canda is semi-circular, and that o f the goddesses invoked to seduce women takes the form o f a vulva, an eye or an arc. The shape and colour also vary according to the purpose o f the ritual (Mrgendragama, kriyfipiida 8.37c-38).u There arc, as we will see, drawings that, by their aspect and their use, partake of the nature o f the mandala, but that arc not constructed by the accum ulation o f powders.7 See M rgendragama, kriyfipiida 8.30 and M atangaparamcsvaragama, k riy a p a d a 1.26a.* Sec, for example, S v T i, chapter 2, introduction to verse 155.

Finally, the d iksih are said to be ‘occasional’ only from the point of view of the guru performing the rite; those that are conferred upon the sadhakan to let them acquire siddhis should logically count among the ka m ya rituals. One should note that these long rituals (which spread over several days, o f which the first days arc used for preparatory rites designated by the general term adhivasa) can be performed only by the acarya, if they are public rituals, or by the sadhaka, if they are private cults (on the sadhaka, see Brunner 1975), and that il is only these high ranked initiates who can tracc and use the rajomamlalas.10 The only mandala described in the SardhatriAatikalottara (7. lab) is presented in the context of the ka /vya ka n n a n , and this shows, according to its commentator, that it conccrns only the sadlmka.

The later works take in general a more radical position. Quoting the Purva-Kfiranagama, chapter 30, will suffice, In the first passage (30.2c-3b), that text lists the different supports for the private cult: the personal linga given by the g u m , the sthandila-, oneself; a temporary (k sa n ik a ) linga\\ a m andala; the water. Immediately afterwards (30.3c-4b), and in a som ew hat different list, it assigns a value to the cults performed on these supports: the cult performed on a mandala is rated at 100; at 1000 if performed on a sthandila-, at 10,000 on a k a u tu k a (probably a narrow stripe of cloth with drawings, later called pata), and at 10 billion on a linga.dalle ca guruna lingo sihandilc sva ya m a tm a n i / / k sa n ik c m a ndate to yc 'p y iitm arthayajannm sm rtatn / im n d a lc tu Satam p u n y a m sthandilc tu sahasnikam // ayulam ka u lu kc lingc k o liko tig n n a m bhavct /(30 .2c—4b)The same work takes up again the problem a little farther (30,7-8), and establishes the following scries, listing the cults in an increasing order in terms of their value: the mental cult; the cult on a mandala; on a temporary linga\\ on a stripe o f cloth (with drawings? pata)\\ on a painted image (? a b h a sa )\\ on an image in the round (bim ba); on a lin g a (with faces, to distinguish it from the next one); on a linga deprived of anthropomorphic traits (niskala-tinga}.m anasan m andalam srcslhm n m andalat ksa n ika m param /ksa n ika t p h a la m u tk fsta m patam caiva (atah param //p atad abhiisam utkrstam abhasat h im h a m ucyalc /b im b a d vai lingam utkrstam lingad vai n iskalam param / /(30.7-8)"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"MANDALA AND YANTRA IN THE SIDDHANTA 159the occasional rituals, especially the diksa, that the Siddhanta texts give a description of the mandala: some will describe only one, like the Mrgendra ( kriyapada 8.25c-53) and the Sardhatrisatikalottara (chapter 7), but in general several kinds of mandalas are suggested for the officiant to choose from (see below), All these mandalas have a complex structure, are rather long to elaborate, and remain present for the complete duration of the ritual for which they are used. When one considers using a mandala for the daily cult of Siva, 12 the mandala, which will have to be drawn each day, is of course much simpler. It is limited to the eight-petalled lotus that occupies the centre of the larger mandalas. According to the Suprabheda (kriya ­pada 8.8), it is drawn on a portion of the ground previously smeared with cow-dung, while according to other texts it is drawn on a square platform made of sand and grains named sthandila (thus the frequent confusion between sthandila and mandala). But there is never any mention of coloured powders, The same instructions apply to the mandalas used in the daily cult of the secondary divinities, such as Surya (see SP1, p. 71, under [Id]).In all cases, this second type of mandala corresponds to the following definition; it is a temporary divine image traced, with some exceptions, by the accumulation of coloured powders and which must be beautiful to rejoice men and gods, I will call it the ‘image-mandala.’Third type: a limited surface that is squared but has no drawing. We also find under the name mandala some square surfaces suitably squared and in the boxes of which the officiant (rapidly) invokesThe idea, as wc can see, is to exalt the linga as the ideal support for the private cult. As for the temple cull, the question does not crop up: it can only take a permanent image as its support, that is to say a fixed lihga for &iva, a sculpted image for the goddess.12 There arc circumstances when one has to. That is what IsanaSivagurudeva explains (see TSanaSivagurudevapaddhati, k n y iip iid a 20.23-27 [= volum e 3, p. 200, 6-15]): if the adept is affectcd by a family impurity, he cannot touch the linga, nor the fire; he must therefore have someone else perform the public cult, while mentally reciting the mantras; then he must him self perform his daily cult (compulsory) on a m andala, always mentally reciting the mantras. One could ask if that rule can be explained by the fact that, the mandala being temporary, no impurity coming from the officiant can impinge on it definitively, while it would have a lasting effect on the permanent linga; or if it can be explained simply by some essential inferiority of the m andala compared to the lihga: the simple mandala used here w ould be less precious than any linga, even the temporary lihga that w ould be allowed in the first hypothesis.

The best known of these is certainly the one called vastumandala, where 45 gods and 8 demons are worshipped (and fed) before any construction, as well as a( some critical moments associated with a given site. The works of Stella Kramrisch13 made it famous and loaded it with a symbolism that 1 for one have some difficulty seeing but on which 1 do not have to elaborate here. What I would like to emphasize, however, is that the term vastumnndala, which we use systematically, is rare in the texts with which I am most familiar.14 In the vast majority of cases, these texts prefer the terms pada and p adavinyasn to refer to these squared surfaces and their construction; the same terms arc used when they describe the division of any square area (the ground of a sacrificial pavilion, the site of an agglomeration, etc.) in four concentric zones destined to serve as guides for the ulterior arrangement of the site.15 In all these cases, we must take the term pada in the sense of ‘domain’ and understand padavinyasa as the attribution of their respective domain to different entities. However, it will happen that the term mandala be used in this context, and that is why I refer to these squared surfaces as a third type of mandala— the only one, in fact, for which the translation ‘diagram’ is appropriate.I will include in the same category some simple geometrical figures allowing for the distribution of objects, for example, the square divided in nine boxes which, according to some texts, serve to fix (with the fall of a flower) the name of a Saiva initiate;1'’ or the11 See Kramrisch 1946, volume 1: 29-97.14 It is not found in this contcxt in the following Agamas: the Piirva-Kamika, theSuprabhcda, the Ajita and the Kirana nor is it found in the Mayamata or the Brhat- Samhita.

The mandalas of which 1 am thinking are not, by the way, material objects used for concrete rituals. Even though we can draw them, they are mental objects that the imagination must create and which, under certain specific circumstances, serve as supports of meditation. This is the case with the mandalas of the five elements mentioned in the descriptions of bhutasuddhi as well as the descrip­tions of the subtle body; this is also the case with the three mandalas of the moon, the sun, and fire (to which a saktimandala is sometimes added) that appear at the upper end of the throne of Siva. The idea of cosmic domain is there inseparable from that of a geometric symbol, so that the inclusion of these mandalas with the preceding ones becomes impossible and all attempts at a translation fail.We therefore arrive at three well defined types of mandalas: the seats, the divine images and the distributive diagrams.18B. Yantra and CakraI now resume my terminological exploration by looking at the terms yantra and cakra, on which I will not elaborate so much. But first, here are two preliminary remarks.The first one is negative: to my knowledge, the mandalas that I have just discussed, no matter the type, are never called yantras or cakras in the Agamas. I, however, found one exception: the Upa-o f the six ‘m em b ers’ (angas). The point o f fall o f the flow er determ ines the beginning o f the name o f the initiate, see SP3, p. 102.17 See SP2, p. 320.18 The distinctions between the three types o f mandalas are certainly not as clear as this paper leads lo believe. In particular, a quick outline of a lotus or any other adequate drawing can transform a ‘scat’ into an ‘im age;’ just as a drawing that is a little complex, made, for example, with hulled grains on a raw grains background, transforms a sthandila (see above) into something that could be called a mandala. On the other hand, it also happens (§T 3 .17c-18a) that the v a stu m a n d a la are covered with coloured pow ders— a fact that brings them closer to the second category o f m andalas and could create confusion if wc forget this essential difference: the vastum andalas do not serve as supports for the cult of a main god— they are not even conncctcd to any particular form of Hinduism."},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"162I IELENE BRUNNERgame named Vatulasuddha describes in its third chapter, under the title cakrabhedapatala, what is, in fact, an imagc-mandala; it calls it cakra throughout the description, even once yantra. The explanation for this infringement is doubtlessly contained in the final lines of that section, where it is said that the cakra can be drawn on a bark and kept as an amulet. The Sricakra represents a better known exception.My second remark will again contrast the texts of the Siddhanta with those of other schools; the terms yantra and cakra are rarely encountered in the Siddhanta (these terms do not appear in the lists of appropriate supports for the cult of §iva), while they are frequent elsewhere. It is therefore from the Tantras of the Trika, in particular the SvT and the NT, that I draw the characteristics of these objects.191) Yanlras are drawings that differ in several ways from mandalas:• They serve only for the kam ya rituals, the desire-oriented rites, and therefore conccrn essentially the sadhaka. The cult based on yantras in fact only marks the first, stage of their use. Indeed, the yantras are generally kept after the cult and worn as amulets; or buried for subsequent magic rituals; or eaten, after crushing the support and mixing the resulting powder with milk or honey.• They are traced on durable materials: birch-bark (bburjatvac, bhurjapattra), copperplates, pieces of cloth, and now paper; they are therefore small and mobile.• The representations they carry arc linear.1,1 On the basis o f these same two Tantras and their commentaries by Kscmaraja, Professor Alexis Sanderson commented, at (he conference mentioned above (sec Padoux 1986: 33), that they confirmed the distinction that ! made between mandala and yantra: “...Your prccisc distinction between yantra and m andala is confirmed by Kscmaraja who defines the former (in its more complex form) as a collection o f mantras written in a particular pattern (on N’I'2 20.59c: yn n tra ca kra m v iiis ta - sam nivc& ilikliito m anlrasam uhah), while in its most basic form it is simply a spell written on a piece of birch-bark (b h u rja p a tra m ),...\" And he continued with a very pertinent remark concerning the more subtle distinction between mandala and cakra: “ As for the subtler distinction between m aintain and ca kra if the m a n d a la is the adharah (locus) and the cakra (of deities/mantras) the a d h c y a m (locatcd), then it would follow that it is only the former that one can ‘Iracc’ and that when one speaks o f the m a n d a la to includc the circle o f deities (dcvaiacakrnm ) or mantras (m antra- cakram ) worshipped in it, then this is by extension of'the primary sense.”Wc find a number o f drawings of yantras in the handbooks of popular Tanlrism, in Hindi, abundantly distributed by Indian bookstores. O f more refined art, the drawings o f the Balinese sorcerers (see the posthumous book, l looykaas 1980) also have something of (he yantra."},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"MANDALA AND YANTRA IN THE SIDDHANTA163• The drawing is engraved (rare) or (more often) traced with a liquid— some ink— made from a variety of often surprising substances, such as blood and the bile of a corpse in some cases of black magic.• The drawing is always completed with the inscription of letters, of bljas, each of which makes a divinity present, and of mantras often containing imperative orders such as: “Kill such and such!”, “Heal such and such!”• Their layout and use are secret.The dominant idea of the yantra is contained in its name, derived from the root yam: with a yantra, the sadhaka ‘constrains’ a divinity to carry out a certain action for him.20 Just as those other machines bearing the same name, the ritual yantra is first an ingenious instrument.The NT keeps mentioning these yantras among the sovereign remedies (for example, NTi 19.198b) and among the weapons of magicians or sorcerers (NT] 18.88c).2) The use of the term cakra is much less precise. Apparently, it does not refer to a category of objects different from the mandalas and the yantras.Sometimes, the idea of ‘wheel’ is obvious, as in the case of the cakra of thirty-two Saktis included in the mandala of the Svacchandatantra (9.16ab and 9.24). But the term often simply expresses the idea of a ‘collection’ or a ‘mass:’ the mass of the divinities assembled on the same limited surface. Finally, cakra is frequently used as a synonym for yantra, though we cannot always tell if this practice is due to a lack of rigour in the vocabulary or to a change of perspective. In those cases, the author may be talking of cakra to refer to the mass of the divinities that are present, or to their configuration, while using the word yantra to refer to the use of the object. But more research than what I was able to do would be necessary to arrive at a convincing conclusion on this point.Let us note, however, that the term mandala is never used in the designation of these magic figures (will we call them ‘coercive20 Sec another analysis o f the term in Kularnava-Tantra 6.86 cited in the Sabda- kalpadruma (s.v, yantra) as coming from another source: kamakrodhadidosotthasarvaduhkhaniyantranat / yantram ity lilnir ctasmin dcvah prinati pujitah //"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"16411 ELI'Nil BRUNNIiRdiagrams’?)—cxcept, of course, for the construction circles or round elements of the total yant ra,II.

The chosen mandala is constructed on the altar { vedi) that stands in the centre of the pavilion (m andapa, more exactly yagam andapa) where the ritual is taking place and it serves as the principal31 support for the worship of &iva during the few days of the ceremony. It is therefore present as a divine image, and only as a divine image; that explains why, though that would not be considered a good solution, the mandala can be substituted with a mobile lihga placed on a sthandila,B. VarietiesThere are tens of well differentiated forms of mandalas, each being designated with a specific term that sometimes expresses a characteristic of the drawing, sometimes the virtue of the object. The list found in ISanasivagurudevapaddhati, kriya p a d a 8.31-123 (= volume 3, pp. 77, 8 ~ 85, 6) comes down to seven terms: bhadra, sarvatobhadra, parva tika n ta , lataiihgodbhava, sv a stika b ja d va y a, svastikasarvatobhadra and cakrabja.22 But some other texts are more prolix, such as the ArnSumat, which gives twenty names or so.2321 ‘Principal,’ sincc there arc other supports on which &iva must be worshipped during the cercmony that uses the mandala. In the m a n d a p a itself, aside from the guru and eventually the disciple, there are, firstly, a vase o f water placed on the north-eastern corner where §iva is installed as the guardian o f the sacrificc and, secondly, the fire (see SP2, pp. 58—80; pp. 86-88 and Plates I-1V). If the cercmony is organized by a temple, the god of the sanctuary nonetheless continues to rcceivc his cult, so that the priests often feel the need to remind through a special ritual the essential identity o f all these apparently distinct Siva(s).22 The list o f the Rauravagama (kriyfipiida 25.59-62) also counts seven terms, but is somewhat different. There, N.R. Bhatt gives in the notes the construction of each of these mandalas, as found in the hitherto unpublished Saivagamnpaddhnti.11 See Am&umat 43.40-47, quoted in Rauravagama, volume I, p. 158, note 11.

The selection is even more limited if we distinguish the private (atm artha) pratistha from the public (parartha) pratistha and, in the case of the public pratistha, if we take into account the nature of the linga, which can be self­manifest (svayam bhuva), established by the gods or other supernatural beings (daivikadi), or established by men (m a n u sa).24 Elsewhere, we are asked to take into account the season or other contingencies of that order25 or, if it is a diksa, the social class of the initiate.26 But even if we accept all these restrictions (which not all texts do mention), the definitive choice theoretically remains quite vast, and in the end it is probably some traditions of the schools that were decisive, each master most probably mastering the construction of only a small number of these structures.27C.

These boxes are grouped in four zones, the exact dimensions of which are given in padas in the text and reproduced in the legend that accompanies my drawing.1) The central zone (A) is called ‘lotus’ (padma) because its space is fully occupied by an eight-petalled lotus, the full geometrical description of which is found in the text. Like all of the lotuses appearing in the mandalas,” this one counts four parts; namely, starting from the centre: the pericarp (karnika); the stamen (kesara), covering the base of the petals; the petals (patra, da7a), or rather the region where they are visible and knitted together; and the tips of the petals (d a lagra), not knitted together and whose form varies in accordance with the goal in view.2) The next zone (B), the width of a pada, is called pitha, a term that must be translated, as we will see, by ‘throne.’ This pitha is made of four padas and four gatras, and it is the interpretation of these terms that will give its meaning to the whole structure.Indeed, while pada evidently means ‘foot,’ the meaning of gatra is far from obvious. I understood it only when I found a text (Siddhantasaravali, verse 76) that gives the colours of these parts as follows, starting from the east: black and white; white and red; red and yellow; yellow and black. That reminded me of the description of the second section of the throne of Siva, the simhasana which rests upon the anantasana. That asana is similar to a low square tableo f the same mandala, see: Prakrti: The Integral Vision. Volum e 3: The A gam ic Tradition and the Arts (edited by B. Baumer, N ew Delhi: D.K. Printworld (P) Ltd., 1995): 193+, ‘Illustration’s P.P. Apte 1,1.’33 The big mandalas, such as the one found in the M rgendra (see note 30) or the m ahatnandala o f the Matariga, usually contain many lotuses: a central lotus for Siva, eight peripheral lotuses for the divinities o f the first ‘circle’ (most o f the time the VidycSvaras), and sometimes still others."},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"168HELENE BRUNNERwhose four tegs (padas), situated at the corners, each take a different colour. It has on its sides four edgewise boards, named gatras (because they are imagined as the bodies of men or animals), that are often referred to as bicolour because each half borrows its colour from the leg to which it is attached.M We should therefore under­stand the pitha of the mandala to correspond to the simhasana of the throne constructed for the cult of 6iva.'15 A full confirmation of this parallelism is given in the Saradatilaka, since upon following its instructions to draw the mandala, wc find the padas and gatras appearing where wc would expect them to appear if we accepted the preceding hypothesis.It is worth noting that, if the pitha is equivalent to the sim hasana, it is the entire square that should be called this way, and not only the zone that projects beyond the lotus. And this is indeed what we find in many works.Now to come back to the lotus itself, one will understand that it is nothing other than the lotus in full bloom, with eight petals, that forms the upper part of the throne of Siva, the one generally called padmasana (see SPl, p. 154, note 1) on which the god is seated in order to be worshipped. We therefore arrive at a first conclusion: the central part of the mandala (the lotus and its pitha) represents the throne of Siva reduced to its two essential parts; not as it could materially be constructed, but as the practitioner mentally creates it during the cult lo project it on the material pedestal of the image that he uses,36 Except for that— a better faithfulness to the ritual model— this central part is equivalent to the pedestal (pitha) of the linga, in particular the lin g a of a sanctuary. And since the plane projection of the linga itself would superpose on the karnika, we canvt See S P l, p, 162, note 1, quoting AghoraSivacaryapaddhati, n ity a k a rm a v id h i 35 (p, 88 o f the grantha edition),3S In fact, to justify the colours of the g ;ltm of the mandala, the com m entator o f the Siddhantasaravali (a certain AnantaSambhu) quotes two lines appearing in the p a d d h a ti o f AghoraSiva in the context of the a sa n a p u ja and which wc will find quoted, with the half-;ilo ka that follows them, in S P l, p. 163, under [50b].

It is therefore certain that the Saiva masters o f old were fully aware o f the identification at which I painfully arrived— that the pitha of the lotus in a mandala represents the simhasana.See the a sa n a p u ja in S P l, pp. 154-176 or SvT [ 2.55e-82.

And, just as the architecture of a temple can become complicated with the addition of successive enclosures, so the mandala can become complicated, the bigger ones presenting up to four enclosures (with two doors on each side, for a total of 32).40 In the end we get a kind of citadel.37 The dvara6obha is the entrance pavilion o f the first enclosure of a palace or temple, see Acharya 1946: 158, 243 and Mayamata 24.2-22 (the w ord is sometimes abbreviated to sobha).* Since so b h a is sometimes used for dvarasobha, the word u p a so b h a probably refers to the pavilions that top the secondary doors (for the upadvaras, see Mayamata 9.58-59b), which should be called upadvarasobhas.39 In 6T 3 .1 12a, which announces that the two most external zones o f p a d as are reserved fordvaras, sobhas, upasobhas and astras. Can we invoke here the tridents often seen on the walls o f temples, at the corners?* We must be careful not to push the parallelism too far. In particular, the successive enclosures o f a m andala host the circles’ divinities (avaranadevadatas) that the ritual places around Siva, not those that, according to our Agamas, reside in the cnclosurcs o f temples, Anyway, it is clear that the mandala is not made in the image o f the temple (the opposite would be more likely): there are simply between the two a certain number o f essential correspondences that have to be kept in mind,"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"170HHLIiNE BRUNNHRSuch an assimilation is warranted by the usual appellations of the mandalas that arc presented as ‘houses’ (bhnvanas) of Siva; and, for the bigger ones, as towns or citadels (puma). II is confirmed also by the fact that many names given to particular mandalas are also the names of some types of towns. H is not likely, however, that we would have arrived at any result in trying lo interpret our mandala and explain the technical terms that come up in its description if we had started from that observation, since we would not have thought of trying to understand the central pari of the mandala via the ritual.As far as I am concerned, the work of interpretation is not complete. However, a clarification of the technical terms which have not yet been explained would essentially not modify the general vision of the mandala that I was keen to present.D. Construct ion o f the MandalaI now leave the narrow context of the Saradatilaka to present in a more general manner the ritual activity associated with mandalas.First, their construction. This must be done on the same day of the ceremony that requires them41 and includes the following steps:1. The a a iry a must first purify the ground'12 (leveled and prepared beforehand) and locate appropriately the north-south and east- west directions.2. He or his assistant carefully then traces the axes of the future square, then its sides, and finally the chosen drawing, all of this with the help of simple instruments: a cord, white powder and a piece of chalk. For the straight lines, one stretches between two fixed points the cord covered with powder and, pulling it up by its middle, immediately lets it go so that it hits the ground, leaving a tracc; for the circles, one improvises a compass with a cord of the desired length and a piece of chalk attached to one extremity, the other being held fixed. The drawing must be precise and respect scrupulously the given measurements.41 So, for lhe big rituals, after the ndhivasit, sec SvT] 3.90e-91b with com m en­tary and 4.34-35; or SP3, p. 228, note 155,42 This instruction is not incompatible with the fact that the mandala is generally traced on a v e d i: the vccli is made of beaten earth and must undergo the same purifi­cation proccss as any portion of ihc ground destined to a ritual use,"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"MANDALA AND YANTRA IN THE SIDDHANTA1713. The acarya then pours some coloured powders on the drawing, in sufficient quantity to form a notably thick layer. Each part of the lotus and each of the other elements of the whole receives a particular colour, duly specified in the text that is followed. Finally, everything must be covered, even the lanes, according to some of our texts.The fingers used to pour the powders and the way in which to proceed depend on the goal in view.43 The same principle applies to the materials used to get the three, four or five necessary colours. While some Agamas, such as the Kirana, have modest demands in this regard (cereal flour for white, minium or crushed cooked bricks for red, coal or burnt chaff for black, curcuma or ochre for yellow, crashed leaves for green) ,4'1 others, like the Mrgendra, accept these substances only in the case of ordinary dlksas, adding that if one wishes for special powers or good fortune (and this must be applicable to other rituals than the diksa for which this is said), precious materials must be used; namely, pearls, coral, gold and cat’s eye for white, red, yellow and black respectively; whereas some impure or harmful substances are well indicated for black magic.45 Finally, some works offer different solutions (a good one, a middle one and an inferior one) according to the financial possibilities of people;46 but we are then brought back to the opinion of the Mrgendra since it is agreed that in all these cases the one who wishes to get a precise favour from a divinity must not mind the expenses.47See, for example, TSanaSivagurudevapaddhati, kriyapada 8.45c-47b (= volume 3, p. 78, 16-21) (emend the first word b h u k ty -to m u k ty -),44 See Kiranagama 20.15—17 b : y a va g o d h u m a ja is curnaii salitandulajais sitam / dhatusindurajam raktam m rd b h ih p a k v e sta k a ir b h a v e t/ / krsnam rajas tusair dagdhair angarair va sucurnitam / haridrasam bhavam p ita m g a iriko d b h a va m eva v a / / haritam curnitaih patrair haritais tat p ra ka lp a yet /4i See Mrgcndragama, kriyapada 8.39—40.46 For example, Suprabhedagama, caryapada 3.61c-65 successively proposes for white, red, black and yellow:a) pearls, rubies, sapphires, gold;b) shells, ja tilin g a (?), collyrium (krsnanjana), realgar (m anassila);c) ricc flour, cooked bricks, burnt cereals, curcuma.All o f this must o f course be crushed.47 That is why the passages that enjoin the use of precious stones and gold m ust not be considered merely as theoretical. To be sure, most o f the adepts, in order to meet with these textual injunctions, must have been satisfied with mixing, for each"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"172IIliLLiNIl BRUNNERThese precisions provide us with a double teaching. The first is that the use of mandalas was a standard practice for the desire- oriented rituals. This is amply confirmed by a number of other instructions concerning (lie form of the tips of the petals, the thickness of the lines, the number of ‘circles’ of divinities to be worshipped around Siva, etc. The insistence on these details could lead one to believe that despite the Agamic passages systematically associating the mandalas with occasional rituals, it is for the ka m ya rites that these multicoloured drawings were first conceived. But that does not assimilate the mandalas to the yantras. Contrary to the yantra, the mandala used in a kfunyn ritual certainly is not the direct instrument in the action to be performed: it is not a magician’s tool, but simply a means, for the sadlmku, to obtain the favour of a chosen deity. By worshipping it on a splendid and costly support, he improves his chances of pleasing the deity and, as a consequence, of obtaining the boons that he craves.The second teaching to get from these same passages is essential: our authors believed in the intrinsic virtue of the materials used in the fabrication of the powders. In general, they seem to consider as obvious the fact that precious substances bring good fortune,^ and harmful substances misfortune. In addition to that, some texts give a more precise teaching concerning the correspondence between thecolour, a pinch of a precious material with a chcapcr one; but there must have been others rich enough to cover at least a small, or even a big, mandala with these costly powders. We must recall, when reading our texts, that there was no lack of m oney in Middle Age Indin, cspccially among the kings or princes who, more often than not, were those w ho sponsored the important rituals. That is why 1 tend to believe that m andalas m ade o f prccious stones were actually constructed; not frequently o f coursc, and they were probably not very big, but I do not believe that their descriptions arc purely theoretical. We should also note that these materials were not lost for everybody; they became the property of I he main officiant, like all the rest o f the material used in the yiigam andapa (see SP4, p. 251, verse 72bc). To think that some ficiirya could have pushed their rich disciples to engage in such sumptuous expenses is a step that we may or may not want to lake.Note also that financial considerations already play a role in the choice o f the mandala, the bigger and more complex ones requiring bigger quantities o f coloured powders. Sec Rauravagama, kriyftpuda 25.60(1 which, after describing seven m an­dalas, adds that one will choose a mandala according to his own means (y a th a - vibhavam ).4* It must be noted here that each of the precious stones possesses a given virtue, but that docs not seem to be the first reason for their use in the mandala."},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"MANDALA AND YANTRA IN THE SIDDHANTA173colours, some deities and some fortunate effects;49 but these indica­tions vary too much between the sources to speak of a solid tradition and a real conviction. The only point on which everybody agrees is that these powders make the mandala powerful— an idea repeated over and over.E. W orship o f Siva on the M andalaNo mantra is enjoined during the construction of the mandala. Once completed, the mandala therefore is not yet a divine image— no more than a carved linga, before the pratistha ceremony. It will become one when the cult will have brought Siva and the powers that accompany him down on the mandala.That cult, again, is a cult of Siva on the mandala, not a cult of the mandala as such, despite the term mandalapuja sometimes used. It is performed like the lihgapuja, a cult of Siva on a linga:50• The stages of the puja are the same, with the difference that, the support being temporary, the invitation (avahana) and the dismissal (visarjana) of the god must be understood in the strictest sense. It goes without saying that the ablutions are made mentally.• The mantras recited are also the same, most especially the phonic seeds (bijas) that are their essential part since, properly pronounced, they make present the divinities of which they are49 See, for exam ple, the passage o f the M ahakapilapancaratra quoted by Raghavabhatta (p. 123, 17-22) in his commentary on ST 3.124. Each colour— five, in that text— is conncctcd with an element, placed under the influence of a divinity and supposed to bring a specific effect. These effects, in reality, are all o f the same order, that is to say the destruction of demonic powers; the result is simply that “the gods are happy.”The position o f the Suprabhedagam a ( caryapada 3.56c-59) is different but not much more convincing. That text, even though it suggests five colours for the mandala, only speaks of the symbolism o f the colours white, red and black, which it naturally connects to the three gunas and the three goddesses (Varna, Jyestha and Raudrl). In a last passage it says that the yellow is added “ in order to obtain the fruit from the yaga.\"On the symbolism o f colours and their magic use, sec Goudriaan 1978, chapter 4.S) That cult is described in all the Tantras and handbooks. See the num erous references given by N.R. Bhatt in his edition o f the Ajita, chapter 20, note 1. Among the texts quoted there, only the Kirana, the Matahgaparamesvara and the M rgendra are earlier than the Som a§am bhupaddhati whose description (S P l, section HI), though concisc, is complete, logical and one o f the most reliable ones we have."},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"174HELENE BRUNNERthe sound body. The officiant imposes them (by means of flowers) unto the mandala as he would do on a linga and its pedestal. The result is that the group of divinities that inhabit the mandala when all the invocations are completed is identical to the group of divinities who inhabit the sanctuary of a temple (or what stands for it in a private cult) during the cult of Siva. That these divinities be represented or not on the mandala by a parti­cular symbol (lotus, svaslika, etc.) is of no importance whatso­ever.• The meditations and visualizations are (hose involved in any cult; they have no special features that would link them to the particular structure of the mandala. Moreover, the texts do not mention any mental ‘coursc,’ leading, for example, from the periphery to the centre, as is enjoined in other traditions. There is indeed a motion, but it is on the whole a centrifugal one imposed by the normal enacting of the puja. Starting from the central lotus, where the throne of the god, then the god, arc successively worshipped, the cult progressively includes the peripheral deities by enlarging cach time the concerned circle (iivararui). These remarks remain true in the case of a diksa: though said to be indispensable, the mandala is treated like any other cult support, without any particular role; and it is used as it would be in the context of another ritual, a pavitrarohana, for example. In other words, the Saiva diksa does not take advantage of the particular form of the mandala of which it requires the construction.51F. Virtues and S ym b o lism o f the MandalaIf the Saiva mandalas are neither privileged means of reintegration, nor direct instruments of initiation, then what proper quality do they possess that makes them more appropriate for some rituals than other cult supports?I already mentioned the particular virtue attributed to the powders of which they are made, and the incessantly repeated affirmation that, because of them, the mandala is a powerful image. Another characteristic often advanced is its beauty, due to the brightness and51 Some texts, such as the Mrgendra and the SvT, suggest the use o f the big mandala to fix the name of the initiated disciple. But this ritual can be done on a very simple ‘distributive’ mandala, and it is certainly not for this purpose that the rajom andala is constructed."},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"MANDALA AND YANTRA IN THE SIDDHANTA175the richness of the colours used, The initiate who constructs the mandala is asked to make it “as beautiful as possible.” Through the fineness and exactitude of the drawing, the precision of the colouring and the good taste evinced in the confection of the ornaments that are left to his initiative, the officiant must strive to create a perfect image. Is it to rejoice men, as it is sometimes suggested— or to charm the gods, as other texts would have it? 52 Probably both. Faced with a splendid mandala, men are happy and feel their love of the gods growing,53 and the gods are better disposed toward men. We must admit that for cults that are performed in an open pavilion, exposed to the view, beauty and brightness of the support are no negligible qualities. However, it seems that a statue or a richly draped lihga54 would be just as impressive to the spectators (and probably also to the gods and I tend to believe that, despite the importance given to aesthetics in the Agamas, the choice of a mandala as the support of a cult is more dictated by faith in its intrinsic power than by the desire to create beauty.55Or could there be more pertinent reasons? One would hope to find further justification for the eulogy of the mandala through other considerations than the nature of the pulverized materials and the brightness of their colours, to dig out of the arid texts the profound signification of these objects that other traditions have loaded with so many virtues .We naturally think of the cosmic symbolism56 on which all the authors who discussed the question have insisted. And, certainly, we cannot deny that even the very simple mandala that I tried to analyze possesses one. But that same symbolism exists in the pair formed by52 See TA 31.4led.53 The Suprabhedagam a goes further: the mere vision o f the mandala cleanses from all sins (caryapada 3.2); the soul is delivered from all the fetters that turned it into a p a in (ca ryapada 3.41 ab). Such passages, which o f course must not be taken literally, at least show the importance o f the v isio n o f the mandala— never equated, to my knowledge, to the dartiana o f the god who inhabits it: the idea is to see the exterior form itself.54 Just as the mandala, but contrary to the fixed linga o f the sanctuary o f a temple, these mobile images can be seen by all.55 W hy then is the mandala disqualified for the daily ritual, at least in the Siddhanta? I can only see one logical reason for this: the fact that the mandalas used for daily rituals are, as we have seen, necessarily simple, probably deprived o f coloured powders, and therefore share none of the virtues attributed to the rajom andalas. The question, however, merits further investigations.% On the symbolism o f colours, see note 49."},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"176liHLHNF.

We must be careful not to give in to our imagination or our desires and add to the texts that we have at our disposal; and these texts do not encourage us to do so. To my knowledge, they do not even make explicit the immediate symbolism that makes the mandala a miniature temple or even a city, though it is suggested by their vocabulary. They dwell even less on that cosmic symbolism with which we Westerners are so obsessed. It is not that they ignore it, but they leave it to the description of the ritual as such to bring out the correspondences between the different parts of the mandala and the cosmic realities, and it seems vain or even dangerous to want to add more. It is by orienting the research in that direction, that is, by analyzing closely the rituals that have mandalas as their support or pretext, that we must attempt to bring some precision to those symbolisms, instead of desperately trying to make them come out of the static structure of these same objects.ConclusionI am afraid that many readers will be disappointed, or even shocked, by my stripping the ancient Saiva mandalas of everything that the imagination, drawing from other sources, had superimposed on them. However, by bringing them back to what I consider their real status, that of divine images, no more and no less charged with symbolism than the others, but characterized by the special power provided by the powders of which they are made and by the power of seduction that results from their beauty, I have not deprived the mandalas of all signification. Rather to the contrary.

Sanderson’s excellent article (Sanderson 1986) on the way in which various texts of the Trika school of Saivism encoded their superiority to other schools in their mandalas. It aims at examining some Saiva mandalas not examined by Sanderson, most of which are not based on the trident image used in the Trika. I shall try to explore how these images represent the relationship of certain branches of Saivism with other Saivas as well as with non-Saivas and how these relationships are visually translated in the image of the mandala. The discussion on mandalas as icons of inclusivism is preceded by a short termi­nological investigation and a summary of some problems concerning initiation mandalas.Most of the texts considered here and consequently the mandalas they describe date from before the Kashmirian exegetes, i.e., before the 1 Oth-11th century A.D. Occasional reference is made to later texts such as the IsanaSivagurudevapaddhati. Although evidence has been brought together from various branches of Saivism, there are a number of demonstrably early Tantras that have been omitted from the discussion.1 Thus, this study does not present a synthesis of all* I would like to thank Paul and Guillaume Coatalen for having prepared the mandala illustrations, and I dedicate this essay to them. I thank Professor Alexis Sanderson for a printout of a draft articlc on mandalas he gave me some years ago, which I have lost unfortunately and thus cannot cite. 1 have tried to avoid topics I remember he discusscs there in detail and hope not to have plagiarized anything unconsciously.

This, to some extent arbitrary, choice of sources means that whatever conclusion is drawn here is limited and needs to be tested on further evidence. Moreover, the discussion on mandalas as icons of inclusivism focuses only on two texts teaching the worship of Bhairava: the Svacchandatantra (SvT) and the Netratantra (NT).1 Mandalas and CakrasThe Sanskrit term mandala and its several meanings have been ana­lyzed in detail in the Saiva context by Brunner 1986: 13-18 (cf. Brunner, pp. 156-161), and the word has been subjected to some analysis in almost everything that has been written on mandalas. Without reiterating the arguments and all the meanings here, there is one point which is perhaps not unnecessary to reconsider: the question of the difference between the terms mandala and cakra. Both words have the general meaning of circle, and thus by ex­tension they can both denote a circle of deit ies or mantras (which are the same, since Tantric deities are mantras and spoken of as such): devatacakra. That in this meaning the two words are interchangeable can be shown by a number of passages, for instance, in the Siddha- yogesvarimata,2 in which both terms arc used when the visualization of a circle of Yoginis or mothers (matr) is proscribed.1' But the inter­changeability of these terms is reflected in more than their use in the same context. Looking at the description of the circles of Yoginis in the same text, it is somewhat confusing for the reader that in the same passage, the central deity— usually a Bhairava— is described as placed on the pericarp of a lotus or on the hub of a wheel, and the surrounding deities are said to be on the petals of a lotus or on thejnanottara, whose full text is available only in manuscripts to which 1 have no acccss; and the Kirana, whose only edition (Devakottai 1932) is also unavailable to me at present. For the dating of early Siddhantas, see Gooilall’s introduction to his edition of the Kiranavrtti, pp. xxxviff. 1 have also omitted mandalas of two texts teaching more csotcric Yamala and goddess worship: the Brahmayamala and the Jayadrathayamala. They teach several mandalas, some of which have been discussed in Sanderson 1986. Moreover, no Kaula sources are included,2 The SiddhayogeSvarrmata is one of the root-texts of the Kashmirian Trika, which I have very tentatively dated to around the seventh century A.D. in Torzsok 1999a: vii.3 See, for instance, verses 22.23 and 28,40 for mandala and 21.1 for cakra,"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"ICONS OF INCLUSIVISM181spokes of a wheel. The words describing the circle of deities as a wheel or as a lotus are mixed up, showing that what matters here is simply a circular arrangement: the lotus terminology recalling a typi­cal mandala with the lotus in its centre and the wheel terminology confirming that the same arrangement can be called a cakra.4However, in spite of this confusion of lotuses and wheels only the word mandala is commonly used when an actual drawing is described or referred to in a text, i.e., one following a rather precise outline and coloured with powders. This confirms what was stated by Sanderson in a discussion recorded in Padoux 1986: 33: the fact that mandala normally denotes the locus of worship (adhara) and the cakra [of deities or mantras] is what is located on it (adheya). Therefore, instructions to trace or draw (likh-) a diagram and to fill it with coloured powders are given for mandalas, but not for cakras.5 This is not contradicted by the fact that the circle of deities is sometimes called mandala as an alternative, for that can be considered a metaphoric usage as noted above. But the consistent use of mandala and the lack of the word cakra in contexts of elaborate drawings show that the former does indeed denote the locus of worship, at least in an early stratum of texts.6There are nevertheless a few examples in which it seems that instruction is given to draw a cakra. However, in these cases the cakra is not the full circle of deities, for what is enjoined is that one is to draw an actual wheel with a hub, spokes and a circumference. Such instruction is given, e.g., in SvT2 9.16ff., prescribing that a wheel is to be drawn outside the central lotus of the mandala.7 Thus, this cakra is an equivalent image of the lo tu s rather than that of theJ Sec, for example, a description starting with verse 22.25 mentioning a lotus (padma) and finishing with the wheel terminology in verses 28-31.5 As noted in the same discussion by Sanderson, the terminology of the Srividya is a special case, and probably reflects a later and looser use«f the terms cakra and yantra.6 This was questioned by Brunner in the same discussion, referring to the SvT and the NT, which allegedly use the word cakra for the drawing itself. Since no references are given there, and since 1 myself have not found any appropriate examples— only actual wheels which are to be drawn inside a mandala or yantra and which are discussed below— it seems doubtful whether such confusion of cakra and mandala is present in these texts. Nevertheless, no firm conclusion can be drawn until all these texts are available in electronic form to facilitate such terminological searches.7 This passage is mentioned as an example for the meaning ‘wheel’ in Brunner 1986: 20 (cf. Brunner, p. 163)."},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"182JUDiT TORZSOKmandala, and when its drawing is enjoined, it forms part of a mandala, but does not replace it.A similar idea may underlie the combined lotus-wheel image described in the Isanasivagiirudevapaddhati, kriyapada 8.106-123, which calls it a mandala of the wheel and the lotus (cakrambuja- mandala). The text is rather corrupt and appears to give several alternatives at the same time. However, it is clear from verse 109 that at least in one of the versions, there is a lotus in the centre, and the lines drawn from the centre to the tips of the petals and to where the petals are joined are to be lengthened further, outside the lotus, to form the spokes of a wheel/ Here again, one has to draw a wheel just as one is to draw a lotus, but the result, the whole of the image, which includes the passageway outside it (vlth i), the doors, etc., is called a mandala.That the mandala is the whole of the drawing itself is also confirmed by the synonyms used for it: b h a v a n a v e s m a n ,w and pura\"— words denoting house or abode, i.e., the place where the deities reside.12 It appears that the mandala is also identified as the seat (pitha) of the deity or deities, probably in the sense that it is the locus of the deities,13 although this very word also denotes a central part of the mandala.14* Note that it is pointed out in verse 106 that in this case there is no pitha in the sense given in Appendix 1, i.e., the ccntral circular image is not surrounded by a square-shaped scat. This is probably bccause the lotus is surrounded by the wheel itself, which may be considered to rcplacc the scat.9 Mentioned in Brunner 1986: 25 (cf. Brunner, p. 170) without examples; see, e.g., SvT2 5,34d. A similar word, bhuvana is used in the NiSvasa, fol. 25v5ff., which I understand to be a varia Icctio for bhavana.10 E.g., SvT2 5.19.\" See, for example, SvT2 5.19.12 While the first two words mean abode or residence in their first sense, pura denotes a town or city as its first meaning. This may be the reason why Brunner 1986: 25 (cf. Brunner, p. 170) interprets the term to denote larger mandalas (without giving examples). However, as Brunner remarks, larger mandalas do not show any special relation to city plans or anything related to towns. Therefore, it seems quite possible that pura is used in the sense ‘abode’ rather than ‘town’ in the context of mandalas, especially if we consider that as the above examples show, the SvT uses pura as a synonym of other designations without any apparent distinction. Moreover, Siddhayoge^varlmata 25.8 and Mrgcndra, kriya p a d a 8.29c use the term pura to denote square mandalas of 2, 3 or 4 hastas on each side, which arc definitely not of extraordinary size.13 This is how I understand the use of the word in apposition to mandala in a citation of the SiddhayogeSvarlmata given by Jayaratha ac/TA 31.8b. The Siddha- yogeSvarimata seems to identify p;7/iawith mandala in a mctonymic way. Note that"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"ICONS OF INCLUS1VISM183In short, the term cakra does not seem to be particularly vague and its use does not appear particularly inconsistent; it has primary and secondary as well as metaphoric meanings just as the term mandala. But as far as the terminology of mandalas as more complex images is concerned, I think it can be safely affirmed that mandala usually denotes the whole of a particular image onto which deities are placed. Cakra either denotes an actual wheel as part of such drawings or refers to the deities themselves. Moreover, cakras are not necessarily associated with yantras— small drawings on durable material including mantra syllables, used as charms— in particular. 15 They are only associated with yantras inasmuch as mantra-deities or rather their seed syllables (bija) can be incised in a circular design (cakra) on these charms.This short terminological investigation leads us to the question of how these circles of mantra-deities are present on a mandala. This subject, the visualization and placement of mantra deities on the mandala, is usually treated as a topic distinct from the drawing of the mandala, for indeed the mandala is only one of the supports onto which deities can be projected and visualized. Moreover, the way in which deities are to be seen or meditated upon does not depend on the support, but on the purpose of the ritual. The same deity or deities can be visualized as more frightful for rites to acquire lower supernatural powers and as milder for appeasement and the like. 16 Even if the visualization of deities can vary considerably for siddhis, there appears to be a standard visualization for initiation. And in the context of initiation, it should be remembered that what the practitioner of a ritual is supposed to see in a mandala is not only the geometric drawing, but the deities placed on it. Consequently, when texts emphasize how the initiate is impressed by seeing the mandala for the first time, especially at the time of his preliminary initiation (sam ayadiksa), it is not the precision of the drawing or the beauty of the colours that produce this effect, but the fact that the initiate seesthis passage is not found in the short recension edited in Torzsok 1999a and Torzsok forthcoming.14 Sec Appendix 1, Illustration 1 and Colour Plates 16-17.15 As suggested by a summary in Brunner 1986: 18-20 (cf.

Furthermore, Ksemaraja also explains ad SvT2 3.128 that when the blindfold of a new initiate is removed and he sees the mandala, he is enlightened, and is thus able to see the deity.19 The text of the Tantra itselF suggests the interpretation that the removal of the blindfold is symbolic, as if it was the removal of the darkness of ignorance. The Tantra also states that what the initiate sees are the deities.2” Ksemaraja goes on to say that since this is the first time the initiate sees the Lord after thousands of births, he is very much surprised, looks at him again and again and falls on the ground. This shows that he can be possessed by Siva, for he has discarded the [false] perception of identifying his self with the body and so forth [instead of Siva] .21What is important in the above lines of the SvT and its commentary is not simply the fact that the deities are present in the mandala (which is quite obvious), but that for initiates they are visible there. Therefore the deities should be considered to form part of the visual appearance of the mandala once they are installed on it.22 Moreover, it must also be remembered that these deities are normally not represented by icons because they are too powerful and consequently too dangerous to be depicted.2'’ Thus, it is when they are installed on a mandala that their visual aspect seems to be the17 This aspcct is worth emphasizing, for Brunner 1986: 30 (cf.

It is there that each of them is represented in drawing by his or her distinct place such as a petal of a lotus, which serves not only as a locus or support of worship, but perhaps also as a crutch for those who perform the elaborate visualization.The moment of seeing the mandala with the deities is considered so important that its mention can metaphorically refer to the whole ritual of initiation.24 However, mandalas are not used exclusively at the time of initiation, although for some— or possibly even for most— initiates the ritual of initiation may actually be the only time they see a mandala.25 As pointed out in a number of studies,26 mandalas are mentioned as optional supports for daily worship and they figure quite prominently in rites to acquire supernatural powers (siddhi). No special mandalas are prescribed for regular worship; the mandalas used in regular worship are just small-size reproductions of initiation mandalas. In what follows, focus will be laid on initiation mandalas and mandalas used for the acquisition of supernatural powers.2 Initiation M andalas and their R o lei. The Tw o Initiation M andalasIt has been pointed out in various discussions27 that just as there are two major parts of Saiva initiation,28 there are two different mandalas24 See, e.g., Paratrim£ika 19 and -laghuvrtti ad loc. The text says that even without seeing the mandala, one who knows the doctrine of this text becomes initiated. The seeing of the mandala is thus considered the principal element of initiation, as the commentary confirms, saying that it includes rites from the night spent at the place of worship (adhivasana) up to the fire ritual, i.e., initiation proper. The SiddhayogeSvarimata has the colophon samayamandala at the end of the chapter describing the whole samaya rite, which also suggests that the principal element of the rite is considered to be the mandala itself.25 This may be the case of someone who aspires only for liberation and who does not take the trouble to draw up a mandala for daily worship, which was probably a rather laborious procedure (on this, see Sanderson 1986: 170, note 3). At some point this was perhaps the most common category of initiates.26 E.g., Brunner 1986: 20-21 (cf. Brunner, pp. 164-165) and Sanderson 1986: 169-170.27 See, for instance, Padoux 1986: 34, Sanderson 1986: 196, note 128 and Brunner in SP3, pp. xxx-xliii.a In some traditions, there is also a third part between what I call here the preliminary initiation {samayadiksa) and initiation proper (diksa). It is termed special preliminary initiation (vitesasamayadlksa), and is found in the Somasambhu-"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"186JUDIT T O R ZS O Kdrawn for these occasions. It seems that according to most ritual manuals, the first mandala, which is drawn for the preliminary initiation or sam ayadiksa, is not at all elaborate. It is made without coloured powders, including only a basic outline, for which sandalwood paste is used. The details of this basic drawing usually dubbed as gandhamandala (‘scent mandala’) 29 or mandataka (‘small mandala’)31* are not given. However, one can often read detailed descriptions of what is called the powder mandala (rajomandala). This is a larger drawing filled with coloured powders, to be used for what is initiation proper, sometimes also called nirvanadiksa, for it bestows final liberation.While manuals seem to share their opinion on these two mandalas as given above, canonical texts differ on several points. These differences concern not only the mandalas, but to some extent also the way in which the two initiation rituals are performed.31The first or preliminary initiation— which is not always named initiation32— consists mainly of a symbolic rite of entry into the Saiva community. It involves the seeing of the mandala and ends with the announcement of the rules (samaya) the neophyte is to observe as a new member of this community. This initiation can be termed preliminary initiation because it is a prerequisite to initiation proper, which follows after a night spent on the grounds of worship together with the guru (adhivasa) ”Initiation proper is performed next day for those who can and want to receive it. It involves the rites of purification, deification of the body, etc., as well as a rite of prognostication, which is based onpaddhati as well as in South Indian manuals, As Brunner points out in SP3, p. xxxv, it seems to be a 'rite batard’ containing elements of the diksa itself,29 Sec, e.g., TA 15.387. ’3(1 See, e.g., SvT2 3.90c.31 It would require a separate study to discuss all the details and problems concerning the samayadiksa. Therefore I shall only point out problems pertaining to the use of mandalas. For a more detailed discussion, see Brunner in SP3, pp. xxxff. and Torzsok 1999b.32 I have shown elsewhere that this rite is not callcd initiation (diksii) in a considerable number of early texts including the Svayambhuvasutrasamgraha, the Brahmayamala, the SiddhayogeSvarTmata and the Malinivijaya. For details of alter­native terminology, see Torzsok 1999b.33 An important cxccption is the VinaSikhatantra, which knows only of one initiation, preceded by the adhiviisa In this text, the rite of entry using the mandala is performed on the same day as initiation proper, and the rules (samaya) are announced only at the end of the latter (verse 49)."},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"ICONS OF INCLUSIVISM187the neophytes’ dreams and on the way in which their tooth twigs34 fall on the ground. Then another mandala is prepared and another variant of the same kind of rite of entry is performed as the day before, but this time without being followed by the announcement of the rules. It is then that the main part of initiation is done. This is basically a rather complex ritual of purification of the ‘bound soul’ and its detachment from lower levels of existence. The rite involves fire offerings at the completion of which the soul of the initiand is joined to Siva.As even this brief summary shows, there is a repetition with variants of what appears to be essentially the same rite, whose culmination is the seeing of the mandala. Most texts agree that there are two mandalas and two rites, the first of which usually gives people the right to perform Saiva worship using the mantras of the cult they are initiated into. However, the texts diverge on very significant details.35Some texts36 prescribe that the first mandala should be the simple one drawn with sandalwood paste as mentioned above. When the initiand is led to it blindfolded, he is to throw a flower or flowers there. He then sees the mandala, which has a profound effect on him. The mandala drawn up the following day is larger, more elaborate and decorated with coloured powders, etc. The same person or persons are led to it blindfolded, but this time they toss one flower on the drawing each. The name of the deity on whose part of the mandala the flower falls will form part of the person’s initiatory name, thus suggesting that the initiate was chosen as it were by the deity who attracted his flower on the empowered diagram.Some other texts, which may prescribe a smaller mandala for the first rite, clearly envisage a colour mandala even for the first rite of entry. This mandala is probably identical to the second mandala except perhaps for its size. Moreover, the guru is instructed to perform the name-giving as part of the first rite, while nothing particular is said about the second mandala.3734 These arc twigs used for cleaning one’s teeth.35 The VTnaSikha differs as pointed out above, knowing only one mandala rite.y' Such as SvT, chapter 3.37 The SiddhayogeSvarimata, for instance, prescribes a colour mandala for the samaya rite as 6.13 shows. But the second mandala— although seemingly elaborate, for it can be double the size of the former— is not described in detail; the reader is referred to a manual instead (8.11)."},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"188JUDIT T O R ZS O KThere are yet other versions of these twin-ritcs. They involve a sandalwood paste mandala in the first rite, which is nevertheless used for performing the name-giving.'™ 11 is tempting to argue'19 that the second version given above, which prescribes the use of the colour mandala and the name-giving in the samaya rite, appears more functional40 and is perhaps the primary version. However, it may be more important to consider the fact that the first version of the rites appears in the SvT, a text which is relatively old among the demonstrably early Tantras.Without trying to establish which order and method of performance of the twin-rites is primary, it can be stated that the two rites resemble each other very much and thus may reflect; the doubling of a ritual which was originally one,41 Moreover, since there is an early Tantra, the VinaSikha, which knows only of one combined initiation ending with the announcement of samayas, it may represent a very early stage of development, when even the samaya rite was not yet independent or separable.42 Judging from the stage represented by this text, il seems a possible development that first the mandala rite and initiation proper became separated, which was followed by the doubling of the mandala rite. An additional argument for the theory of doubling could be that as some later developments show, a further extension of the preliminary initiation occurs43 under the name of visesasamayadiksa. To this a new repe­tition of the mandala rite is added by AghoraSiva’s commentator, Nirmalamani, who prescribes it if too much time has el lapsed since3,1 As in SP3, pp. 37 and 103.w In Torzsok 1999b I tried to establish a possible chronology and development of this rite in various texts, but I am no longer sure if there is enough justification for all my hypotheses. An attempt at reconstruction has been made by Brunner in SP3, pp. xxxi-xxxiii in a more general way, omitting details of the mandala.4(1 I.e., it seems to be more appropriate to draw up an elaborate mandala for a rite which focuses on this instrument. Furthermore, it could be argued that the seeing of the uncolourcd mandala in the SvT, without the name-giving ritual, appears to be odd. Why should one be impressed by the sandalwood paste mandala rather than by the coloured mandala? What is the point here in casting flowers on the diagram if the name-giving is omitted? For a discussion of these problems, see Arraj 1988:144ff. and Torzsok 1999b.41 For this hypothesis and arguments in the case of the Siddhanta, sec Brunner in SP3, pp. xxxi-xxxiii.42 This confirms Brunner’s hypothesis in SP3, pp. xxxi.43 This is the case, for example, in the SomaSambhupaddhati and the Aghora- 3ivapaddhati."},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"ICONS OF INCLUSIVISM189the performance of the samaya ritual/ ' 1 Thus, the samaya rite seems to be particularly liable to doubling and expansion.In spite of these possibilities, it must be reiterated that no early Tantra apart from the very brief Vinasikha seems to refer only to one mandala.45 If a redoubling took place at some point, we have no way o f knowing how exactly it happened and through what stages.This means that the role of initiation mandalas cannot be determined in general by covering the descriptions and versions of all early texts. However, a number of significant points can be summarized concerning their nature and importance in this ritual.461. It is the mandala— either in its simpler or its more colourful and elaborate version— and the ritual connected to it that usually determine the initiation names of initiates and thus not only qualify them to use the mantras of the cult, but also give them a new identity in their Saiva community. The initiate comes to be chosen as it were by one particular deity of that tradition, who attracts the flower he casts on the mandala.472. After the disciple’s blindfold is removed, the seeing of the mandala— no matter which kind is used— with the deities on it is usually considered to have a profound effect on him, for this is\" Sec AghoraSivapaddhati 254.45 It must also be added that the VTnaSikha does not mention the name-giving itself, but the editor of the text, T. Goudriaan, supposes that it was understood (cf. p. 139 and p. 16).4,1 In what follows, I assume that the more elaborate mandala is a larger and expanded version of the colourless or smaller one. This is suggested in all texts which describe only one of them. To my knowledge, the only text according to which the two mandalas arc explicitly very different is the TA. But that exceptional choice is probably motivated by Abhinavagupta’s intent to integrate various levels of the Trika in a hierarchy of initiations. For more information on this topic, see Sanderson 1986: 196,47 While texts contradict each other on whether the elaborate colour mandala or the simpler g a n d h a m a n d a la is used for this rite, one could perhaps find more evidence by examining initiation names. From initiation names found in inscriptions in Darasuram, it seems that names of the VidyeSvaras, aiigamantras and mantras of the throne were used as well as the brahmamantras (sec Srinivasan 1987, and the evidence summarized in Goodall 2000: 207). The name of SomaSambhu may show that even lokapiilas were perhaps included in the initiation mandala, which was then probably a more elaborate one. But since the above inscriptional evidence comes from the tradition of the Siddhanta in the Cola country of the 12th century, its testimony cannot be taken for what happened in other regions and periods."},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"190JUDIT T O R Z S O Khis first contact with the deities of his chosen school.'18 In the daily rites which he is obliged to perform ever after the initiation, the disciple is in fact supposed to recreate this first sight of the deities in visualizations.'193. The seeing of the deities in the course of initiation is not the privilege of some, but is experienced by all categories of initiates. In a number of texts, the name-giving is also performed for all candidates as part of the initiation.4. While there are Vedic parallels to initiation proper (diksa) as a whole, the central part of the samaya rite performed at the mandala has no such obvious Vedic predecessor.50ii. The Initiation M andala as the Largest D etailed Representation o f Esoteric D eitiesThe paragraphs above do little more than summarize what has already been analyzed in detail in Sanderson 1986 concerning the Trika, namely the fact that the mandala plays a particularly important role in creating and maintaining a new, Saiva and sectarian, identity of the initiate. This identity is then repeatedly confirmed in the course of the performance of daily worship. This must be one of the reasons why the moment of seeing the mandala is considered so important. But in addition to this, there may be yet another reason. It is not mentioned or expressed explicitly, but is perhaps still an important factor here, at least as far as early texts and practices of Bhairavatantras51 are concerned. The initiation mandala, in addition4S Even if only the name-giving version is described for the samaya rite, as in the Tantrasadbhava, for example, it is made clear that the initiate is duly impressed and falls on his knees. See 9,124d, where the subjcct must be the initiate or the initiate with the guru.m For this process in the Trika, see Sanderson 1986: 169-170.Sl Brunner in SP3, pp. xxxvi draws a parallel between the samayadiksa and theupanayana rather than between diksa proper and Vedic rites. However, what is similar in the upanayana and in the samayadlksii is not the nature but the function of the two rites, for both bestow the qualification to study the scriptures. Moreover, il isonly the visesasamayadiksa that creates a twice-born in the same way as theupanayana does, and this is not common to all versions of the samayadlksii. My point in drawing a parallel between diksii proper and Vedic rites is that fire ritual has obvious Vedic predecessors, while the rile involving the mandala is rather unique to the Tantric context,51 The term is used here for Tantras teaching the worship of Bhairava as well as for Yamalatantras and Tantras teaching goddess worship.

This point requires a brief investigation into the question of what objects were used for the worship of esoteric deities and how: the nature of worship and what substrates it may require, the role and scope of lihga worship, the question of anthropomorphic images and what size various substrates were prescribed to have.52Most Bhairavatantric ritual prescriptions envisage that ritual is performed in an abandoned place specially prepared for this purpose, and not in a permanent building with permanently installed images in it. This suggests that at least in the case of some esoteric cults (in the Bhairavatantras and ‘above5) and at a relatively early period, near the composition of the earliest Tantras, no permanent building or image was used to perform ritual.53 It must also be noted that the list of supports for daily worship given by Abhinavagupta54 mostly includes various small objects as supports for visualization which do not actually depict the deities of the cult. He mentions, for instance, a rosary, a mirror or a sword-blade as well as a private lihga. When images are mentioned, they are small ones made of painted clay (perhaps what is meant is terra-cotta), deodar wood or gold or images painted on a piece of cloth or drawn on a skull. They are images of small size for private worship, never larger ones made of stone. Moreover, early Bhairavatantras do not normally include references to rituals which empower icons made for common worship (pratistha).55categories, see Sanderson 1988. For the fact that Tantras teaching goddess worship also categorize themselves as Bhairavatantras in a broader sense, see, e.g., Siddha- yogeSvarimata 1,19d and 8.4cd, the latter passage reading mahabbairavatantre ’sm in s idd hnyng cs v a rim ate.52 An appropriate treatment of the subject would require a monograph. Therefore, what is presented below is only a brief summary of a few points relevant to the present discussion on mandalas in some early Saiva Tantras, without a full presen­tation of all the evidence. It is hoped that the study ‘Idols and Other Substrates of Worship in the Trika’ announced in Sanderson 1990 shall be soon available.53 This hypothesis would of course need further investigation and a full presen­tation of the early sources on the subject.54 See TA 26.32ff. and Tantrasara 179-189 and the summary of these passages in Sanderson 1986: 170.55 The only such text I know of is the unedited Pihgalamata referred to in Sanderson 1990: 40 and citcd on the visualization of the deities of the Trika.

They were used only by members of the particular community (inatha) for individual worship. As Brunner observes in her study and translation of the pratistha section of the SomaSambhu- paddhati (SP4, p. v), at the time of the writing of this manual, no public temple rites were performed, 56 What is envisaged by Soma- sambhu is that when a linga is established in a matha, for example, it is worshipped by several people one after the other.57Private, portable (cala) lingas were also used in more esoteric cults, as mentioned above, even if the worship of larger, shared lingas, does not seem to be mentioned in Bhairavatantras,5K Moreover, as Abhinavagupta writes in Tantraloka (TA) 27.2-3, these shared lingas— even if envisaged for Bhairavalantric worship— are not to be installed with secret, i.e., esotcric, mantras; for those mantra-deities possess their power in their esoteric nature and onceNepalese manuscript is reported to be dated A.D. 1169-1170.

Although the text claims to be part of the Bhairava canon as Goudriaan 1981: 46 points out, it mainly deals with temple construction and installation of lingas. Goudriaan 1981: 46 also observes that “Sakta tendencies arc almost completely absent” in this work, which would explain why a Saiddhftntika author, Vidyakantlia II (pupil of Ramakantha II), refers to it many times in his Bhavacudamani (for details, sec Goodall’s introduction to his edition of the Kiranavrtti, pp. xxvi-xxvii). From the above citcd accounts of the contents of this text, it seems that only its chaptcr 5 on painting (and possibly some passages in its chaptcr 4 on icons) could be relevant in a Bhairavalantric context. These passages sccni to give the iconography of paintings made on cloth, a substrate for private worship mentioned by Abhinavagupta in the above citations. The NT also gives some details in a few verses, which arc discussed below.*’Onc of the few, relatively detailed, surviving passages about the installation of lingas and small size statues is found in the Mataiiga, kriyiipiida 13-14, the only longer passage pointed out in the above edition as a parallel.

Therefore, stable or larger lihgas are to be installed with the mantras o f the Siddhanta, even if other deities can be invoked in them temporarily. Furthermore, following the Sarvajnanottara, Abhinava- gupta adds that secret mantras should be avoided especially in case one installs a so-called manifest (vyaktarupin) image-—a warning which shows that what is to be avoided here is first of all an anthropomorphic or figurative image.59Nevertheless, there was one, undoubtedly ‘anthropomorphic image’ which was not excluded from communal esoteric worship and even recommended for certain days: the body of the guru, that of other Saivas and certain women. In the list of 11 possible substrates of external worship given in TA 6.3,60 the last one, m u rti, a word that could possibly refer to an icon in similar contexts, is glossed by the commentator as “the body belonging to the guru or others” (m urtir gurvadisam bandhini). The long description of what is called ‘The Worship of Embodiments’ (m urtiyaga) or ‘The Worship of the Circle’ (cakrayaga), which makes this somewhat enigmatic gloss clearer, is then given in chapter 28.60ff. by Abhinavagupta: it is a rite in which the preceptor, various other practitioners, their wivesw The exceptional installation of a Bhairavagamic mantra in NTj 18,119-121 is discussed by Sanderson 1990: 78, who understands the passage of the Tantra to prescribe the installation of an cctypc of the esoteric mantra of Svacchandabhairava in the icon. He then argues that Abhinavagupta in TA 27.8 in fact contorts the intended meaning of the Tantra by interpreting the passage to refer to the installation of a non-Bhairavagamic mantra such as that of Netranatha, so that the prescription should conform to the fundamental rules of pratistha. A lthough Abhinavagupta’s interpretation does seem forccd, it must be noted that the passage of the Tantra itself refers back (by saying pragvidhanatah) to some previous verses on general rules about pratistha. These verses, 18.104c—109, prescribe the installation of the non­esoteric AmrteSa/Netranatha alone or with the also non-esoteric goddess Maha- laksmi. Even if this is not enough to support Abhinavagupta’s interpretation, it is significant that installation is generally envisaged here using non-esoteric mantras, in spite of the general tendency of the NT to mix up various Agamic prescriptions (for which see NT2 13.45-46).H) These substrates are a mandala, leveled ground, a vessel, a rosary, a manuscript [of 6aiva scripture], a lingo, a skull, a piece of cloth (no details given), a clay/terra­cotta image (not discusscd in any detail, but mentioned in 27.19 as coloured [citra]), a mirror (or any mirror-like surface, such as a sword mentioned in 27.44) and a murti:mandalam sthandilam piitram aksasutram sapustakam / lihgam turam patah pustam pratima murtir cva ca //"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"194JUDIT TORZSOKand women of lower castes or prostitutes are propitiated by alcohol and offerings which include meat and fish/ ’1Even when an apparently figurative image or anthropomorphic icon seems to be mentioned in a Bhairavatantra, such as a ‘Daksina- murti’ in the SvT, commentators understand such references as denoting something which is different from an icon as an embodi­ment.62As for the size of images used, icons of deities in the Siddhanta are described, e.g., in the Matahga, kriyapada, chapter 14 as being between ten ahgulas, and one hast a (0.2-0.45 metre)/’1 The size of a linga is said to be three hastas (1.35 metre) in the same text (13.9),64 which would be the size of the smallest mandalas.The initiation mandala used by all the in it iands is thus the largest image (as envisaged in a number of Bhairavatantras) or one of the largest images (if we consider shared lingas) a Tantrika may see and use, for its side usually measures at least three or four hastas (eight or nine is also recommended), that is at least 1.35—1.8 metres. But unlike the other communal or shared support of a relatively large size, the linga, it contains a clear visual mapping of the esoteric deities of one’s tradition.Among objects used as supports for the worship of esoteric deities, portable images used for private worship are small. Therefore, even if kept over a longer period of time, they can be hidden from the uninitiated. Other supports such as a mirror or a sword are not easily recognizable as religious objects. But an image as large as an initiation mandala is not so easy to hide, and this is perhaps one of the reasons why it has to be temporary: a mandala drawn up for the occasion and effaced ritually after it has served its purpose.Note that according to Abhinavagupta his summary of this yaga is based on the SiddhayogeSvarimata.

Thus, when the trident image, which includes the full cosmic hierarchy from earth up to the three goddesses on the tips of the trident, is installed in the line of inner sensation in regular worship, it reveals “the Trika’s supremacy by taking [the practitioner] through and beyond the mandala-thrones of all other Saiva claimants to the worship and assimilation of absolute power.”In the same article, reference is made to the ranking of the doctrines of outsiders, i.e., non-Saivas, in scriptural sources as well as in the Kashmirian exegetical literature.66 In what follows, I shall take up this line of inquiry with special reference to the SvT, which gives a particularly detailed account of its relation to other doctrines, in order to illustrate the following two features of its initiation mandala.1. While the trident image of the Trika creates its hierarchy and encodes its supremacy to others in a vertical ascent, the SvT as well as a number of other texts and their mandalas use a concentric image and arrangement of deities to express their domination:67 they place the supreme deity of their system in the middle of the mandala, surrounded by other deities often representing other schools of thought. This method of concentric encoding seems to be more common than that of the trident image of the Trika, whose mandala is in fact quite exceptional in that it is to be seen as three-dimensional, building its central trident upon the usual concentric image of other Tantras. For in the trident mandala, the central lotus is not the seat of thew For an illustration of one of the several versions of the trident mandala of the Trika, see Colour Plate 19.See Sanderson 1986: 172, especially note 8.67 This idea is also referred to briefly in Sanderson 1986: 172,"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"196JUDIT T O R Z S O Kprincipal deity but is the lotus of gnosis, from which the trident of the three goddesses arises and is seen as coming out of the surface of the mandala.2. The example of the SvT also shows that the mandala can visually represent and include not just other brandies of Saivism, but also non-Saiva doctrines or traditions in the form of lower revelation. In this respect, the SvT is a special case, because it seems to be the only Bhairavatantra to include a relatively detailed discussion of other, non-&aiva and early Saiva (Pasupata, etc.), doctrines and to include them in its cosmic hierarchy.The SvT ranks the doctrines of outsiders in its 11th chapter (11.6 8ff.), which seems to have become something of a lo cu s classicus on the subject later on, judging from the series of citations given by Jayaratha ad TA 1.33.fiS In this passage of the Tantra, schools of thought are assigned various levels of the universe or principles (tattva), from intellect (bu ddhi) to Sada£iva. The equi­valences with the tattvas are not explained in a fully systematic way, for while some tattvas are not assigned to any school,69 others are said to represent the level of liberation or consciousness of several schools at the same time.70 In addition, there are also principles which are not tattvas but are nevertheless said to be the place of certain schools. 71 It should be noted that these inconsistencies may be due to the fact that it is not uncommon in early Tantras that the number of ta ttv as fluctuates. Such fluctuations can be explained on the one hand as a result of redactional cutting-and-pasting, on the other by the fact that it was perhaps not felt to be necessary to fix the number of tattvas at an earl ier stage of doctrinal development.72m The citations arc not identified in the edition. Jayaratha quotes SvT211.68c—71 d.None of the five coverings (kancuka) is mentioned explicitly in the list, nor is the level of pure knowledge (guddhavidya) above maya.711 Two sects, the Mausulas and the Karukas arc both given the 30th level, that of mayfr, and the level of is vara also represents several sccts.71 Thus, the Jainas arc said to be established in the three strands of material existence (guna), which do not form a tattva. However, guna is sometimes listed as a tattva, such as in the Parakhya recorded in Goodall’s introduction to his edition of the Kiranavrtti, pp. liii.71 For a detailed discussion on the number of tattvas in the Siddhanta and what they may imply, sec Goodall’s introduction to his edition of the Kiranavrtti, pp. li-lv. ' '"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"ICONS OF INCLUSIVISM197In spite of these inconsistencies, a number of elements of the hierarchy are very clearly defined and some of them correspond to other ranking systems. Thus, while Ksemaraja adopts a different hierarchy in his Pratyabhijnahrdaya (ad sutra 8), he also assigns the level of intellect (buddhi) to the Buddhists.In the ranking of the SvT, non-Brahminical schools are placed the lowest, below the 24th level, that of material cause (prakrti): the Buddhists are made to reside in buddhi and the Jainas are at the level o f the three gunas of sattva, rajas and tamas. Now it could be said that the gunas and material cause are at the same level, for the gunas are the three strands of prakrti. However, in this passage, they seem to be treated as separate from and inferior to prakrti.73 It should also be noted that in verse 68ab, buddhi itself is said to be produced from the three gunas, suggesting a direct relationship between these two principles and possibly between the schools placed at these levels.7'1The 24th principle, prakrti, is assigned to ‘Promulgators of the Veda,’ which is interpreted to allude to the Vedanta by Ksemaraja ad Joe.,75 but could just refer to anyone for whom the Veda is the highest revelation. The 25th principle, purusa, is the highest reality for the Samkhya, which seems quite natural.76 Above them, the 26th principle is the highest level for the Yoga. This is normally the level of niya ti,11 causal determination, but in this passage, the SvT does not speak explicitly about any of the five coverings, of which niyati is normally the first.This exposition is followed by the placement of various schools of the Saiva Atimarga, schools of Paiupatas and Lakulas, in the cosmic hierarchy. First, the pasupata-vrata is equated with the 33rd level of Isvara. Following Ksemaraja, this expression refers to the doctrine expounded by Lakullsa. Then the text returns to a lower level, the 30th. It is the level of m aya, which is the highest level for Mausulas73 In the same way, (he Kiranatantra also lists the gunas below prakrti, as reported in Goodall’s introduction to his edition of the Kiranavrtti, pp. lv,74 Note that Buddhist schools arc distinguished, but in fact all are placcd at the level of maya in TA 4.29-30. Kscmaraja puts the Saugatas together with the Mlmamsakas, Naiyayikas and Carvakas at the level of buddhi, while the Vedantins and Madhyamakas arc above them.75 This can be inferred from the fact that he citcs the SvctaSvatara-U panisad.76 However, Kscmaraja upgrades them to the level of m ahamaya in the Pratyabhijnahrdaya.J 1 That Yoga must be then at the level of niyati is also confirmed by Jayaratha ad TA 1.33: tesam [i.e., patanjalanam] pumstattvordhvavartiniyatitattvapraptir ukta."},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"198JUDIT TORZSOKand Karukas, who arc followers of disciples of LakulTSa, according to Ksemaraja.

It is then stated that Vaimala and Pramana (or Pancartha) Pasupalas can rcacli up to the level of Tsvara, identified with their highest deities, Tejesa and Dhruvesa. After this, §aivas— probably in the general sense meaning Saiddhantikas as well as those of other currents— arc mentioned and declared to be above the rest.Further in the same chapter, another passage discusses doctrines of other schools, this lime without ranking them in an unambiguous way. The categorization of other doctrines is based on their relation to dharmal adharma, detachment/lack of dclachmcnt (vairagyafavai- ragya), knowledge/ignorance (jhana/ajhana) and powerfulness/lack of power (aisvtuya! anai&varya), According to verse 186, these eight concepts make the wheel of the samsara turn round incessantly as eight spokes. In this passage, non-^aiva and other &aiva schools are hierarchized in the following way. Verses 174-179b describe trea­tises of logic (heiusasira) and declare them to be characterized by adharma, lack of detachment, ignorance and lack of power. It seems they receive the lowest grade here; for, as the SvT says: they are devoid of knowledge, Yoga and deities, and arc useless for the attainment of any of the four goals of men in life.7\" After this, all the other schools are described mentioning at least one good point about their teachings. Mundane or common knowledge'—covering agri­culture, politics, etc., as Ksemaraja points out— is characterized by dharma, while the doctrines of both the Pancaratrikas and the Vaidi- kas involve dharma as well as knowledge. Buddhist as well as Jaina doctrine is endowed with detachment, while the school of Samkhya possesses both detachment and knowledge. The bcst-placed of the non-Saivas is again the doctrine of Yoga, which is associated with knowledge, detachment and power at the same time. The only doctrine exhibiting all the good characteristics, and which thus goes beyond (ati-) the others, is the Saiva doctrine of the Atimarga. For78 This particularly low ranking of the scicncc of logic is not followed by the excgetcs. Ksemaraja places the Nyaya in the same group as the Mlmamsa and the Buddhists both in the Pratyabhijiiahrdaya and in Spandanirnaya ad 4 and 12-13. In the latter work, he placcs even the Samkhya and the Vedanta at the same level. It could be argued that Hetu£astra is not the same as the school of Nyaya. Nevertheless, in general statements of the above kind, (hey may not be differentiated in a very precisc manner."},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"ICONS OF INCLUS1VISM199adherents of the Atimarga, i.e., those who practice the Skull obser­vance, and the Pasupatas (verse 184), there is no further creation, they are established in Isvara/DhruveSa. The ranking stops here, and no other Saivas are mentioned.This way of ranking of other doctrines reveals two important distinguishing features of the SvT. One is that it includes all Brahminical schools of thoughts from the level of prakrti upwards. Now, it may be argued that the Pancaratrikas are omitted from the hierarchy of levels. However, it is arguable that they are understood next to the Vaidikas, which is demonstrated in two other passages. One is the verse referred to above, which states that the doctrine of both Vaidikas and Pancaratrikas is characterized by d h a rm a and knowledge. Another passage (5.44-46) prescribes that one should not condemn Bhairava, his and other Sastras, the latter including the Samkhya, Yoga, Pancaratra and the Vedas, for they have all come forth from Siva himself and bestow liberation.79 These passages show that the Vaidikas, Pancaratrikas and the adherents of the Samkhya and Yoga are all consciously felt to be very closely related to Saiva doctrine, and consequently they are placed at the level of p rakrti and above.80Secondly, the SvT also gives a particularly detailed account of how it sees itself in relation to the Atimarga. Judging from the number of Pasupata branches, they must have been flourishing or recognized at the time of the redaction of this Tantra. It is also noteworthy that the SvT particularly insists on the superiority of the Atimarga, leaving the doctrine about the superiority of Bhairavatantras vis-a-vis other Saivas implicit. It sees itself as the continuation of the Atimarga rather than of the Siddhanta.81The whole issue of ranking other doctrines according to the tattvas gains particular significance in connection with the worship of the deities on the mandala. The drawing of the mandala of nine lotusesw Kscmaraja reports a reading from ‘old manuscripts,’ which states in the last line that everything comes forth from &iva and bestows the fruit of [reaching] Siva’s abode.80 Although doctrinal affinities remain important, other texts do not state this relationship so explicitly.81 Ksemaraja (commenting on 11.184c) seems somewhat uncomfortable with the fact that the ranking stops at the level of the Atimarga. He supplies an additional statement to the effect that if followers of the Atimarga are liberated, then how much more the Saivas. He also understands the word ca in the sense of api in order to read this meaning into the text."},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"200JUDIT TORZSOK(navanabha) for initiation is described in chapter 5 (from verse 19), followed by an explanation conccrning (he deities to be worshipped on it (from 5.37c).

The eight Bhairavas arc placed on the petals as eight mantra-syllablcs extracted from the nnviitmabija,S1 In what follows (verse 40), the text points out that one should recognize these deities as standing for [the principles] from SadaSiva down to p r a k r ti and they are also worshipped on the pericarps of the surrounding lotuses.84 By including the principles from prakrti up to Sada^iva in the mandala as secondary deities, the Brahminical schools from the Vedavadins upwards are also implicitly included and their levels represented by Vidyaraja and the other Bhairavas.85Thus, doctrinal inclusivism also appears implicitly in a cult image in a fairly consistent way, since iion-Brahminical schools, the Buddhists and the Jainas represented by ta ttv a s below p r a k r ti, are left out of the mandala and its deities. The SvT’s example also illustrates the common way to express the superiority of a tradition in a concen­tric icon, in which the supreme deity of the school is worshipped in the centre, surrounded by its ret inue of deities (parivani) standing for lower levels of the universe and lower revelation.Kf’B For a reconstruction and illustration of (his mandala, sec Appendix 2 and Colour Plate 18.10 See Kscmaraja’s comrncnlary on hakiircna: It A for K apalisa, RA for Sikhi- vtlhana, KSA for Krodharaja, MA for Vikarala, LA for Mnnmatha, VA for Megha- nada, YA for Somaraja and 0 for Vidyaraja.M They swap placcs with Svacehanda as the text and (he commentary clarify further on.*s Wc do not necessarily need to follow Kscmaraja here, who assigns the tattvas of Sadasiva, Isvara, vidyii, nvly;l kala, niyati, purusu and prakrti to the eight deities, for the text itself simply specifics that they represent levels from SadaSiva down to prakrti.

The ways in which mandalas are transformed or visualized differently for siddhi can be divided into three groups:i.

The diagram translates into an image of what is elsewhere insisted upon in doctrinal passages: the idea that the supreme deity ultimately controls the whole universe, even if lower levels are assigned to other Bhairavas as their regents, and thus it is this supreme deity that is able to bestow full power upon the practitioner.However, the other eight Bhairavas of the initiation mandala are not forgotten in the context of siddhi, cither. But while the worship of Svacchanda is prescribed on a mandala as a support, the other Bhairavas are placed and worshipped on small charms written on pieces of birch-bark (yantras or niksas'>). They are worshipped for the attainment of much more specific goals than the control of the whole universe.The first yantras described arc those of the first and last Bhairava, Vidyaraja and KapalTsa, who can protect the practitioner from death. Their mantras are to be incised in the centre of a wheel, and the spokes are occupied by the 32 goddesses starting with Aruna, just as in the mandala of Svacchanda above. The other yantras are based on the same model, with one Bhairava in the middle and the goddesses around him, except that in each case, some additional details are“ Following verse 16, which states that the wheel is outside the lotus, Ksemaraja remarks at verse 24 that there arc four goddesses in cach o f the eight directions, and that they arc outside the lotus. However, the text of verse 24— contrarily to 16— suggests that the lotus and the wheel somehow overlap, bccausc it says that the goddesses are on the petals and the spokes at the same time.w As the examples below show, ruksu is not always a protective amulet, despite its name."},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"ICONS OF 1NCLUSIV1SM203given. These include instructions to incise the name of the person who is to be protected, controlled or killed in the middle; or the addition of other mantras to the whole yantra which envelope or inflame it, or the use of substances collected in the cremation ground (9.64-65). Among the other Bhairavas, Sikhivahana is employed to cause one’s enemy to suffer; Krodharaja can kill someone or make him mad; Vikarala can frighten one’s enemy; Manmatha is invoked for subjugation; Meghanada to exile someone and Somaraja to acquire wealth.The resemblance between the mandala of Svacchanda and the yantras of the other Bhairavas shows that in spite of the differences between mandalas and yantras, they are closely related, especially in the context of siddhis. Just as Svacchanda represents the truest doctrine of all Brahminical doctrines which are included in the initiation mandala, so here, too, he stands for all-encompassing power. Other Bhairavas are seen as specializing in more specific tasks. The initiation mandala of the nine lotuses includes all these Bhairavas as different levels of reality, for its purpose is to bestow qualification upon the initiate who can subsequently employ any of these Bhairavas for whatever goal he may want to. But for specific aims, he is to use only the Bhairava most appropriate for his purpose. Judging from the construction of these mandalas and yantras in the SvT, siddhi is viewed here as the specific application of the power acquired in an all-inclusive way at the time of initiation.ii. E xpansionThis view of the SvT is not shared unanimously by all Tantras. In a number of texts, the mandalas prescribed for siddhis contain several circles of deities who are not necessarily present in the initiation mandala. The Mrgendratantra, for instance, allows an initiation mandala of just the central group of five deities or brahmamantras,90This is referred to in kriyapada 8.44 as an option, although it is em phasized in the preceding verse that one should try and make a mandala with several circles of deities. Verses 8.52-53 also suggest that all the deities m ay not be present inside the mandala, which should ideally include three circlcs o f deities (avarana) around the central group. In ease o f these smaller mandalas, one can worship the outer circles on ornamental elements, such as sva stika s, lotuses or dots, or one can just worship Siva on the four-pctalled lotus. This last solution is interpreted by Narayanakantha to be used in case o f lack of time, place or material means."},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"204JUDIT TORZSOKbut prescribes additional outer circlcs of deities lo be worshipped for certain supernatural powers. For the acquisition of knowledge, it is sufficient to worship the Vidyesvaras around the central group o f five brahmamantras. For ‘divine’ supernatural powers one should add the circle of the GancSas. For ‘middle’ siddhis—probably meaning attracting women and the like— the guardians of directions should be further added outside the GaneSa circlc. For ‘lower’ powers— such as killing— all the gods should be there, extending outward to the guardians’ weapons on the periphery of the mandala.91 Moreover, according to kriyapada 8.46, in case the practi­tioner has various aims of different kinds, he is to worship the central deity surrounded by three or four outer circlcs of deities on a saktimandala, which is endowed with an additional circle of the mothers.92 These mothers are not present on any version of the ini­tiation mandala, yet they arc employed lor siddhis of all kinds, in an extension of what is or could be the same as the initiation mandala.93These prescriptions of the M rgendra show that the outer circles of deities in its mandala are responsible (or siddhis of increasingly low kinds. However, they are not worshipped on their own for these specific functions, but always remain in the outer circles of the mandala whose centre is occupied by Siva in the form of the five brahmamantras. This visual arrangement implies that various siddhis are not specific functions of the central deities (as was the case in the SvT), but rather that the bestowing of supernatural powers is seen as an extended function of these deities, who do not bestow siddhis themselves, but delegate lower gods, lokapalas and the like, for these tasks.941,1 Cf. kriya p a d a 8.45. Note that according to Narayanakantha, in cacli case only one circlc is to be worshipped around the ccntrc and not several circlcs extending outward to the circlc including those deities. The ccntrc with the live m antra-deities and the guardians, for instance, should be worshipped for ‘m iddle’ sid d h is, omitting the VidyeSvaras and GancSvaras in between.

However, it is unlikely that culls, especially"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"ICONS OF INCLUSIVISM205iii. SubstitutionThe third way of changing the initiation mandala for s id d h i can be illustrated by two examples taken from the Siddhayogesvarimata. Chapter 25 first describes the initiation mandala in a rather cursory way. Its side measures three or four hastas and it lias a 32-inch lotus with eight petals in the middle— thus resembling the basic type reconstructed in Illustration 1 and Colour Plates 16-17 (following the more detailed prescriptions of the srimandala in the NT).95 After a brief statement of how the p lacement of mantras is to be performed on the body, the text appears to shift subject to give details of rites to acquire supernatural powers which are to be performed in the cremation ground. The placement of the mantras is followed by the filling of the mandala outline with powders. Verse 34 specifies that white powder is to be produced from powderized human bones and red from blood. Then, the practitioner is to place a human skull on the pericarp of the lotus and on the eight petals and should write the mantra of Bhairava with his consort on the central skull with blood taken from his left arm. This Bhairava holds a trident in his right hand, on which the three principal goddesses of the Trika, Para, Parapara and Apara, should be projected. On the remaining eight skulls the eight mantra-goddesses who form the retinue of Parapara should be written, starting with Aghora.So far, this siddhimandala basically follows the arrangement of deities prescribed in chapter 6 for the samaya rite; the three goddesses occupy the prongs of the trident and the group of eight isearly ones, were based on such principles. For the problem o f dualism and non­dualism in scriptural sources, sec Sanderson 1992: 282ff.95 The same type of mandala is given in another Trika text, the Tantrasadbhava (9.104ff), which calls it the sarvatobhadra(ka). Although the Siddhayogesvarimata seems to agree with the Tantrasadbhfiva on this matter rather than with a third surviving Trika text, the Malinlvijaya (which gives a mandala of a trident and the lotuses), the subsequent verses on sid d h i show that there is a trident present on the mandala o f the Siddhayogesvarimata, too: but instead o f being drawn on the ground inside the m andala, it is draw n in blood on a skull placed in the middle. Nevertheless, it must be m entioned that the text docs not give an unam biguous account o f the mandalas. This chapter as well as chapters 7 and 8 suggest that the initiation mandala (diksamandalci) may well resemble the Tantrasadbhava’s sarvato­bhadra, without the trident, even though chapter 6 clearly prescribes the mandala with the trident for the sam aya rite. Moreover, A bhinavagupta’s sum m ary o f the principal mandala o f this text— on the basis of which I have attempted to reconstruct the mandala in Colour Plate 19, but which is not included in the surviving short recension— unambiguously gives one with the trident,"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"206JUDIT TORZSOKplaced on the petals of the lotus. However, after giving the bijam an tras for the goddesses and promising the successful invo­cation of Yoginis, verses 53-55 give a new set of eight goddesses one can equally worship with the same or other bijas on the diagram. Their names indicate that they arc probably recommended for lower siddhis such as killing,% The diagram itself becomes a framework which can accommodate various groups of deities depending on the siddhi envisaged.A procedure similar to this seems to be at work in chapters 21 and 22 of the same text. Chapter 21 describes, again very briefly, a wheel-diagram with 12 spokes, which appears to be recommended for worship in various months of the year. Twelve Rudras of different names are placed on the spokes, and a Bhairava, identified with one’s self, performs the churning of the nectar of immortality in the middle. Subsequently, the text gives a summary in a few verses of a samaya type ritual, in which this very whccl-diagram is em­ployed to determine the gotra name of the initiates (verses 20—21), implying that the wheel is used as the central image of a mandala. The wheel is to be drawn red, with a mixture including blood. Now a passage in the next chapter prescribes the visualization of the same kind of wheel as the one mentioned for the golra attribution. However, this time the wheel, whose basic colour is red and which is to be visualized in the middle of an Ocean of Blood, is mentally pro­jected in the air. Instead of 12 Rudras, 12 frightening Yoginis— or optionally six Yoginis accompanied by six Rudras as consorts97— are to be placed on the spokes. They churn amrtn from the Ocean of Blood and bestow success upon the practitioner.The wheel-diagram used for a golra name-giving initiatory rite and recommended for monthly worship is thus employed as a framework on which more fierce fill deities are installed to gain supernatural powers, just as the lotus mandala of the main goddesses can also accommodate goddesses associated with black magic (abhicara).Although the above examples are fairly representative of the major ways in which the initiation mandala can be transformed to bestow sid d h h , they are not exhaustive.

This is followed by the statement that for rites of propitiation or appeasement as well as for prosperity, one should use the square or circular type; the semi-circle should be used for the mandala of Candesa and the triangular type, for black magic.118A different sort of graphical change is prescribed for the worship of various deities and for the acquisition of siddhis in the Mrgendra, which draws the shape of the petals of the lotus in the mandala differently for different purposes.1” For supernatural powers in general (b huti), the petals should have curled-up tips; they should be even for liberation (m u k ti) 'no For the worship of Kamesvara and other deities bestowing good fortune, the petals are to have pointed tips, while if one worships the iokapalas, the grahas, the ganas, CandeSa or Ganesa, the petals must be broad and curved at the edges.1111 The ganas are also given round-shaped petals in another verse. The worship of the Vidyesvaras requires petals shaped like cow’s ears, and Gauri, the goddess of speech (vak) and the Rudras are to be worshipped on lotuses whose petals look like the leaves of the Asvattha tree.In the subsequent verses, the Mrgendra gives yet more alternatives, which concern the shape of the mandala and its colour according to the deities or the purpose of the worship. Thus, agreeing with the NiSvasa, it prescribes a semi-circular mandala for worshipping Candesa, but it adds the worship of the Amrtavidyas102 to this category and specifies that the colour of the diagram should98 vartulam caturasram va siin tike p a u stik e tatha /ardhacandrani tu ca ndese abhicarc trikonakam // fol, 26r3,(The reading of the manuscript c a n d l e has been emended to candese.) v> See Mrgendra, kriyapada 8.31-33.I follow N arayanakantha’s interpretation o f the verse, who understands the som ew hat enigmatic sp h u ta m to mean a nim nonnatagram sa m a nl.mi Following Narayanakantha’s interpretation o f the w ord m antharagrakam . \"“ These are female mantra-deities bestowing immortality and the like."},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"208JUDIT TORZSOKbe while. The mandala of the Saubhagyavidyas111'1 is said to be red and vulva-shaped or bow-shaped. The description continues with further options for purposes of well-being, for rain and for the worship of the VidycSvaras.The materials used for (lie preparation of the mandala should also be different when used for liberation and when employed for lower supernatural powers (abhiciira) according to Ihc same passage of the Mrgendra (kriyapada 8.4Q):I,M the coloured powders are to be made from pearls, corals, gold and the like for liberation, but they are to be produced using substances from the cremation ground for the lower powers.However, if the same mandala is used for liberation as well as for the acquisition of supernatural powers,\"15 the Mrgendra instructs practitioners to make white powder from rice flour, red from red mineral from mountains— vermillion or red chalk according to the commentator— , yellow from yellow orpiment or turmeric106 and black from burnt barley and the like. Since initiation mandalas used for several people should not be made for a specific sid d h i, this general type is probably what the text envisages for diksa.It must also be noted that a more esoteric text teaching goddess worship, the SiddhayogeSvarimata, does not prescribe impure substances for specific siddhis as obligatory. At the same time it allows these substances as alternatives for initiation as well. Thus, in 6.12, the text gives the choice to the guru if lie wants to use ashes (probably meant to be collected in a cremation ground) or flour for the samayamandala, and in 8.8 it also gives alternatives without restriction for the making of the thread to be used to prepare the outline of the mandala: it can be made of human hair (n a ra k e sa - sam utthena, again probably obtained from corpses) or of cotton and the like.

However, in all these cases the deities worshipped remain those taught in the Saiva systems: forms of Siva or Bhairava, various Yoginis or groups of deities forming their retinue such as the lokapalas. It could be argued that for siddhis, the SvT employs Bhairavas who embody lower levels of the universe in the initiation mandala, and who consequently represent lower, non-^aiva revelation: Vidyaraja who is employed to conquer death, for instance, stands for the level of prakrti and by implication embodies the level attributed to Vedavadins. However, the deity remains a Saiva mantra-deity with a visual appearance and name of a Bhairava, In this respect, the NT stands apart from other early texts in that for siddhis it prescribes the alternative worship of deities who clearly belong to other systems, by substituting the central god of the cult, Mrtyumjaya/Netranatha (as well as his consort), with non-Saiva deities.After describing the drawing and decoration of the mandala, the NT lists the deities to be worshipped in its centre, on the pericarp of the lotus. First, the principal deity of the cult, Mrtyumjaya is mentioned (18.62), who is to be worshipped with the goddess of prosperity, Sri, as his consort.

Visualizations of Visnu ore described at the beginning of chapter 13, in which a number of Vaisnava forms arc listed which include various incarnations such ;is the Man-lion (Narasimha), the Boar (Varaha) and the Dwarf (Vamana). But the list of alternatives does not stop here, for the text continues by giving the visualization of Surya, forms of Rudra, Marihara, Ardhanarisvara, Brahma, and finally the Buddha, who is said to specialize in granting liberation to women. The commentator, Kscmaraja, introduces this passage109 by saying that the text enumerates various alternative forms of Mrtyumjaya, They can all be worshipped on a mandala, too, which is first shown in the prescription according to which Surya is to be placed in the middle of a lotus (verse 23), and later by the mention of various loci of worship in 28. These deities or— following Ksema­raja— forms of Mrtyumjaya can be visualized on the ground, in fire or water, on the top of a mountain, or in any other place which is pleasing to the mind and shall all bestow the desired success. This is further confirmed in another passage of verses 37-43, which states that all kinds of deities lead to success if they arc worshipped as prescribed. The text explicitly says that deities of other Tantric traditions can be invoked as well as those of the Nyaya, the Buddhists,110 the Yoga, Vedic deities, etc.\"1 The list shows that the Buddha is not visualized and regarded as a manifestation of Vijmu— which could also be the case— but is considered to be the Buddha of the Buddhists and is invoked as such.What is most striking in the inclusivism of the NT is that it does not stop at the level of Vedic revelation and Brahminical darsanas, but includes the Buddhists, and that it allows the worship of forms of Visnu and the Buddha as principal deities.Now the SvT also includes the visualization of Brahminical deities who are not Saiva strictly speaking, and who represent lower levels of the Saiva universe situated below forms of Siva. An example for such inclusion can be seen in the description of internal worship, in the course of building up the Saiva universe internally. When visualizing the lotus of gnosis (vidyapadnm) on top of thel(HCf. the commentary before SvT2 13.17.1111 The N T2 uses the irregular or aisn form iirahata as docs the SvT.111 The ‘etc.’ in the text is interpreted by Kscmaraja lo mean Puranic deities.

This is followed by the placement of three circles (mandalas/ m andalakas) on this lotus o f gnosis: the circle o f the sun on the petals, that of the moon on the filaments and the circle o f fire on the pericarp.112 Then the visualizations of three deities (o f Puranic appearance) as regents o f these three circles or spheres are prescribed: Brahma, Visnu and Rudra placed on the outer, middle and inner circles o f the petals, filam ents and the pericarp respectively. It is on top o f Rudra, still on the pericarp, that the laughing Sadasiva/M ahapreta is then to be projected before the visualization and worship of Svacchanda’s throne and o f Svacchanda himself.The difference between the place and role o f Visnu in the NT compared to the SvT is that on the one hand, the NT prescribes the worship o f forms of Visnu as the central deity, and on the other that it gives several alternative forms o f Visnu, which indicates its som ew hat unusual interest for this deity in a Saiva context. \" 3 M oreover, the appearance o f the B uddha as central deity is undoubtedly unique here.

The above mentioned passage about treatises o f logic is long in that no other school o f thought is treated or criticized in such detail in the text. See SvT 11.167—179b on what it calls Hctu&islra, while all other traditions are dealt with in verses 1 7 9 c -185.IW Something to this effect is stated in 13.44-46. This passage confirms that the principal deity of this cult is the soul o f all mantras, and therefore there is no infringement o f the rules prescribing that rites of different schools should not be mixed up. Ksemaraja’s commentary a d loc. adds a more strongly non-dualistic inter­pretation o f this statement."},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"ICONS OF INCLUSIVISM213cosm ic symbolism of the mandala, and the fact that the drawing itself is an empty framework.Although the initiation mandala may not depict the Saiva cosmos in a more explicit way than other supports of w orship, 120 its con­centric or vertical image of a hierarchy of deities and other elements is often seen as representing a cosmic hierarchy, too, Thus, the image o f the mandala is identified with the cosmic hierarchy in scriptural sources: the trident o f the Trika is understood to represent the universe from earth to Siva, the deities of the SvT represent levels from pra kiti up to Siva-Bhairava and the five outer lines drawn around the mandala o f the NT stand for the five kalas which constitute the &aiva universe (see Appendix 1). This identification is continued by Ksemaraja in his commentary on the SvT, in which he states that the 224 inches of the side of the mandala represent the w orlds o f the Saiva universe. Since the m andala is seen as representing the cosmic hierarchy, it includes lower revelation. Thus, at least for purposes of siddhi, deities of these lower revelations may be used effectively. They of course do not fully deprive the central deities of their importance and place in the hierarchy: for example, employing the Buddha’s power is recommended mainly for women.A second feature of mandalas which may have contributed to the substitution and inclusion of non-Saiva deities is that they do not actually depict the deities themselves.121 Although Tantric deities can be visualized for worship, their identity lies first and foremost in their mantric form, as pointed out in Sanderson 1990: 78. In a number o f texts, this means that they can be visualized in somewhat120 As Brunner 1986: 30 (cf. Brunner, p, 175) points out. However, as I have tried to argue above, the mandala is a spccial case compared to the lin g a or a tem ple in that it gives a mapping o f the deities of one’s tradition.121 I think there is a practical reason for this, apart from the doctrinal reasons already mentioned. Sincc these mandalas arc mostly made o f coloured powders, it would require an extremely !arge-sizc mandala to be able to depict deities in detail on it. Such figurative images in coloured powders are made even today in Kerala. An exam ple is the Kajam Eluttu, which depicts Bhadrakall before the performance o f a Mutiycttu. This shows that even a single deity requires a rather large diagram. T he construction of such a diagram would be quite unpractical for rites such as the name-giving sam aya ritual. However, what is missing on the Saiva Tantric image can be amply provided by detailed visualization, the result o f which may not be as different from some Tibetan Buddhist mandalas as Brunner 1986: 31 (cf. Brunner, p.176) claims. W ithout trying to draw too many parallels between these two traditions, I would just like to em phasize again that the Saiva m andala is not simply the drawing itself, but the drawing and the visualization."},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"214JUDIT T O R ZSO Kdiffering forms according to one’s purpose, and thus the goddess Para, for instance, is given a rosary and a manuscript as attri­butes— similarly to the goddess of speech, Sarasvatl122— when visualized to obtain eloquence, but she is pictured as pouring out the nectar o f immortality to conquer death, 121 Taken to the extreme, this principle implies that any visualization can suit a mantra-deity, who may well take up the appearance of the Buddha if needed. The m andala is quite w ell-adapted for such radical ch an g es in visualization, for it does not depict the deities in their concrete forms. If one uses the geometrical framework of the mandala, changing the deity’s appearance in visualizations does not necessitate any change in the traditional mandala, drawn according to Saiva scriptural prescriptions.In a final remark, it could be concluded that what renders the identity o f Bhairavic mantra-deitics weak is in fact their pow er­fulness. It is because they arc too powerful and dangerous to be depicted with their iconographic features (TA 27.23) on objects such as the mandala that their visualized images can be changed or replaced by the images of other deities; and it is this iconographic interchangeability that allows ritual inclusivism or eclecticism. 124122 For this identification, see Sanderson 1990: 43.123 See Siddhayoge£varimata, chapters 1 1 and 12.124 It would require an altogether separate paper or monograph to explore why such eclecticism takes place in the NT in particular, which exhibits a som ew hat lax attitude towards mixing prescriptions o f different traditions (tanirasainkara in 13.46). In addition to an investigation into the changing religious sccnc of different periods, a rather precise chronology of the scriptural sources would also be needed."},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"ICONS OF INCLUSIVISM215A ppendicesA p p e n d ix 1: The Construction o f the SrimandalaB elow is a brief description of how a simple mandala is constructed, following the prescription of the NT with Ksemaraja’s commentary. N ote that without the commentary it would be im possible to reconstruct the mandala. Technical terms are given with illustrations so that this summary can serve as a basis for the reconstruction o f other mandalas. Their descriptions seem to follow mostly the same general terminology with a few minor differences. Some o f these differences will be pointed out below. Ways in which the cardinal directions are determ ined on the ground, details concerning measurements, some problems pertaining to the actual drawing with the help of threads and the colouring with powders are not discussed here. However, it must be born in mind that these factors, too, form part o f the process of mandala construction, and are sometimes detailed in the middle o f the description of the drawing. A good example is the discussion o f how to establish the directions in SvT2 5.29ff. W hat follows concerns only the actual drawing and the colours applied according to N T2 18.3Iff. A similar mandala was reconstructed in Brunner 1986 (cf Brunner, p, 177) on the basis of a later text, the Saradatilaka and Raghavabhatta’s commentary, but without explanations of all the technical terms. For the construction o f the srimandala, see Illustration 1, while the final result o f the con­struction can be seen in Colour Plates 16 and 17 according to two versions.The drawing of the mandala starts with the construction o f a grid, in which the size and number of the cells vary . The shape of the grid is square (caturasra) and its lines are always drawn along the north- south and east-west axes. A cell is called a kostha or kosthaka, and the length of one o f its sides is a bhaga. In the NT, the grid of 324 cells has 18 bhagas on each side. There is an eight-petalled lotus in the middle occupying eight times eight cells.In most mandalas, the construction o f a lotus follows the way in which this central lotus is produced in the NT. First, four concentric circles are drawn in the middle of the central square o f the lotus. The first one has a radius o f one bhaga and is the circle o f the pericarp o f the lotus (karnika). The second circle has a radius o f two bhagas and"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"216JUDIT TORZSOKmarks out where the fibres will end (kcsariigra). The third circle has a radius of three bluigaa to show where the petals will be joined to one another (dalasamdhi). The last circle has a radius of four bhagas, to mark where the tips of the petals should end (dalagra).This is followed by the drawing of the lines where the petals o f the lotus will meet. This means that first, one should draw eight lines from the centre in the cardinal and intermediate directions. These lines will intersect the outermost circle at the points where the tips o f the petals arc to be. Then one draws eight additional lines w hich must be in the middle of those eight radii. This halving is done in the same way as at the establishing of the square of the mandala. In this case it is done by halving the line which one could draw between two petal lips, starling with the lips of the north-eastern and the northern petals. It is obvious from the description that since these latter lines represent the sides of the petals, they will be visible from outside the circle of the pcricarp up to the third (dalasam dhi) circle. It is also mentioned that the petals have three fibres each (drawn from the pericarp up to the second circle).The next step is the drawing of the outlines of the petals outside the d alasam dhi(i.e., the third) circle. Ksemaraja says that one should draw two arcs with the help of a thread, fixing the thread with the left hand in between the line in the middle of the petal (m adhyasutra) and the line on the side of the petal (parSvasutra). Then one should draw two arcs on both sides [of the petal] with the right hand, starting from the point where the petals should intersect (already established by the intersection of the third circle and the parSvasutras).After the description of the lotus, the text gives the colours for its various parts. It continues by stating that a white circle is to be drawn, its thickness measuring one inch, around the lotus. This is the so-called ‘air-line’ (vyo m a w kh a). Outside this circle, a square should be made, with a yellow line which is one inch (ariguki) thick. This is the inner part of what is called the ‘seat’ (pitha), which is a square band occupying one bhaga outside the inner square. (The width is mentioned by Ksemaraja in his commentary on 43cd.) Then this surrounding band is to be divided into the corners (kona) and the so- called ‘limbs’ (gatraka). These limbs are formed here by leaving two bhagas on each side for the corners. Thus the ‘limbs’ occupy four cells each, as Ksemaraja makes it clear. He also gives a b rie f definition of the ‘limbs:’ they are particular segments which should"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"ICONS OF INCLUSIVISM2 1 7fall in between corners, outside the ‘air-line’ (gatrakani konantara- laga avayavavisesa vyom arekhaya bahye karyani).Next, one should leave a band which is two bhagas wide around the ‘seat,’ This is the terrace or passage (vith i). In K sem araja’s explanation the passage is the place to conduct the p u ja. Outside o f this is the area where the doors are to be drawn, on a surrounding two bhaga wide band.The door has two parts, here called kantha and upakantha. The form er is the upper part, i.e., the part closer to the centre of the mandala. In this mandala it occupies four cells, as K sem araja explains. He understands the prescription of two cells in the text to apply on both sides.

Ksemaraja gives a definition of both kantha and upakantha: ka ntham dvarordhvagam a v a y a v a v is e s a m u p a k a n th a in kanthadho- ga m avayavavisesam . Note that in a number o f texts, this base is not called upakantha, but k a p o k i125Next to the door, there is an ornamental part which has the shape o f the door turned upside down. 120 The smaller and outer part of this element is called the goblia and the wider upper part is the upasobha. Again, their measurements are based on K sem araja’s commentary, who him self mentions that some details are left out and understood to be supplied by the reader. Note that the sobha and upasobha are called kapola and u p a k a p o la in the Isanasivagurudevapaddhati (kriyapada 8.58), in which they are also defined as having the shape o f doors turned upside down and being placed next to them ( tatparsvatas tadvipantavaktras tadvat kapolopakapolakah syuh).When the doors are ready, the text mentions that one is to draw three circles (inside the doors?), leaving out the western door, which faces the deity. This is not commented upon by Ksemaraja, but there is a brief mention of a circle in the context o f the door in TA 31.83, in which the door is said to be circular optionally. In the context of the NT, however, it seems that the function o f these circles is to125 Sec, e.g., Svl'2 5.34ff., Malinivijaya 9.3 lab and TA 31.39, 31.84cd.Sec Kscmaraja on 44d: dvaraparsvayoh paravrttadva ra sa m n ivesa ka ren a “tatha so b h opa sobha k c \" k ft rnyct."},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"2 1 8JUDIT TORZSOKclose, cover or seal the doors, and this is probably the reason why the western door facing the deity has no circlc.

All colours are given in detail except those for the outer corners; and it is also not clear if the decorations in the vithi should be black or the vithi itself. Since all parts o f a mandala have to be covered with coloured powder so that the ground should not be seen,127 it can be assumed that the corners also had some colouring.

The grid measures 224 x 224 ahgulaa and is divided into 7 x 7 large bhagas. Ksemaraja remarks that the number 224 reflects the number of bluivam n. Mere again, the drawing starts at the centre, where one is to draw a lotus in the same way as described in the N T above in the central kostha. The di fference is that the scat o f the lotus here is the outline of the ccntral kostha itsel f without the construction of the gatrakas. The eight other lotuses arc constructed in the same way around the ccntral lotus, leaving one kostha in between them. The various parts o f the surrounding area, the sobha, upasobha, and kantha are all said to be half the size of the v ith i. K sem araja understands this to refer to the vith i around the lotuses, which has been obtained by halving the space between the lotuses and the edges (see 33cd-34 and commentary). The text itself must refer to the height of these elements, while their varying widths arc given by Ksemaraja. The two parts of the doors are termed here kantha (the thinner, i.e., inner part) and kapoJa (the wider part). The elements next to the door are termed upasobha (the wider or inner part next to the kantha) and sobha (the thinner or outer part being next to the kapola). According to Ksemaraja, the height and the width o f the kantha is the same, measuring half of the vithi. This means it is a small square whose side is equal to the quarter of the side o f a lotus- seat. Although the size of the kapola is not defined by the text, Ksemaraja— referring to other scriptural prescriptions— understands it to be of the size o f half a vithi by one vithi. This means it occupies twice the space o f the kantha as reconstructed in Colour Plate 18, Verse 34ab informs us that, there are eight doors, and Ksemaraja explains that they are in between the lotuses. Since the size and places of the doors are determined, what is left between two doors on each side is the §obha with the upasobha. After constructing the sobhas and the upa£obhas of the same size on each side of each door, the remaining parts form the four corners.However, it is possible that in the text, kapola means what is added to the size o f the kantha outside the kantha.

On the colours, he cites the Saiddhantika Parakhya, which has the same prescription for the lotuses as the NT, but adds that the space between lotus petals is green and the corners are red. The fibres are slightly different, having the colours white, yellow and red starting from inside. I have made the doors and the vith i white, as in the case o f the N T ’s mandala, and the sobhas and upasobhas red and yellow.

The outline is to he made on a square of three hastas on each side, to which a surrounding hand of 12 angulas is added for the doors. The square of three hastas on each side is divided into nine large cells, one square hasta each, and these are further divided into 6 x 6, i.e., 36 small cells each, so that each small cell measures four angulas on each side. The lotus in the middle, similar lo the one described in Appendix 1, measures one hasta on each side.The trident is drawn in the large cell in the middle, i.e., leaving three small bhagas untouched below. 1111 On both sides, two h a lf circles are to be drawn downwards, in the neighbouring two bhaga s. This implies that the radius of the smaller half-circles is half a bhaga, and the radius of the larger half-circles is one bhaga. The smaller half-circles continue in small arcs of quartcr-circles above. The tip of the middle prong should end half a hasta inside the large kostha above the kostha of the central lotus, i.e., half a hasta below the door. The tips of the two other prongs should fall on the side-lines of the large kosthas, i.e., on the lengthened side-lines o f the square of the central lotus. I have made these tips by lengthening the lines that could be drawn between the centre point of the mandala and the points where the two small arcs end. The two points where these lines intersect the side-lines of the large kostha arc the tips of the side-prongs. However, the exact drawing of the tips of the prongs are left to the reader’s decision to some extent.In addition to problems concerning the formation of the prongs of the trident, I have also had problems in interpreting the way in which the staff is to be drawn. As for its length, it readies down as far as the edge of the outer square.111 It is said to be three hastas long counting from the tip of the middle prong, if I understand the text correctly. This means that the distance between the top of the trident and the bottom end of the staff is three hastas, which is indeed the case if the staff reaches down to the edge of the outer square. Its thickness is two angulas, which is probably to be applied on each130 Jayaratha states: tatra m a d h yu d adhastanam bhagatrayain lyaktva.131 See Jayaratha’s statement: parivarjilabahyadvrida& lngiilaiitani."},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"ICONS OF INCLUSIVISM223side, i.e., its full thickness is four angulas.132 The staff should not cover the lotus, of course. It is not mentioned that the bottom end o f the staff has got the thick ring called amalasaraka as in the MalinT- vijaya’s version of the mandala, nor that the staff is pointed below. However, it is unlikely that the staff ended abruptly at the bottom, and one is probably to draw the pointed tip as well as the amalasaraka. I have done so, assigning one bhaga to the pointed tip as well as to the amalasaraka.The lotuses on the tips of the trident measure half a hasta, i.e., their radius is half o f the radius of the central lotus. layaratha mentions that the doors and the rest are to be fashioned as before. The last uncertainty concerns the central seat or pitha, which is not mentioned, but which I have supplied, for to my knowledge there are no occurrences of a central lotus without a pitha around it. 1 have chosen the seat to be one bhaga thick, which would be a standard measurement, similar to the measurement o f the p ith a in the NT, which is described in Appendix 1, I have not drawn the small stick­like element under the central prong called g a n d ik a , which is prescribed for the Malinivijaya’s trident in 31.67cd-68ab.The colours are set out in verses 147ff. The colours for the central lotus are the same as in the NT. I have also followed the NT when colouring the doors and their surroundings. The pitha is coloured again as in the NT, for its prescription is the same as that of the Malinlvijayottara in TA 31.80-81. I have followed verse 31.82 for the colouring of the trident, which is to be red, while its staff is black and the amalasaraka is yellow. However, the vith i is prescribed red in verse 149 following the lost. Trisirobhairava. For the lotuses on the tips of the prongs, there may be two possibilities. One is that they are the same colours as the central lotus. The other is that their colours agree with the colours prescribed in the Trisirobhairava: red, red- black/brown and white for Parapara, Apara and Para respectively, i.e., on the right, left and in the centre,133 1 have followed the Trisirobhairava concerning the colours of the small lotuses, but I021 interpret the text to prescribe that the two vertical lines which form the staff are to be marked out on three points: in the lower, middle and upper part.

However, while the whole of chapter 31 in this work is devoted to these ritual diagrams, no general view is given there of the theory and practice of the mandalas. It is only through his descriptions o f how mandalas are made use o f in different rituals, and especially in the initiation (diksa) ritual, that Abhinavagupta’s conception of the nature of these devices appears.Chapter 31 (163 slokas), on the nature of mandalas (.m andala- svarupam), does not describe their nature, merely how to draw them. It consists almost entirely of quotations from earlier Tantras. It describes five different types of mandalas, four o f which are made of tridents and lotuses (sulabjamandala), while one includes a svastika. The descriptions are those of four different Tantras, three o f which have not come down to us: the Trikasadbhava (also called Tantra­sadbhava), the Devyayamalatantra, and the Trisirobhairavatantra. The fourth description is taken from chapter 9 (6-30) o f the Malinivijaya, the Tantra on which according to Abhinavagupta the teaching o f the TA is based; this text is still extant. 1 W hile the descriptions of the Trikasadbhava and the M alinivijaya are clear enough, those drawn from the two other Tantras are difficult to understand (even with the help o f Jayaratha’s commentary).

Coloured powders may be added once the pattern is drawn, so as to make it more beautiful, which is something the deities like (9.41-42): “one who knows how to do this is a real master o f the Trika,” says sloka 5 1. There arc also mandalas made o f perfumed substances, called g a n d h a m a n d a la, and less frequently used.What strikes one when looking at these diagrams is that they do not conform to the pattern generally considered as normal for mandalas, which are usually centred geometrical structures which the user is to contemplate— and/or to use for his worship— by going mentally from their outward portion to their middle point; that is, ontologically, from an outer lower plane to the higher central plane o f the deity: it is a centripetal move. Here the mandalas are o f a different type. On a square ground the main element is Siva’s trident ( sula or trisula), whose staff goes vertically from the lower part of the mandala to its centre, where it expands in the form of a lotus, above which its three prongs rise. On the tips of each o f these is a full blown lotus— this is the trisuklbjam andala, the mandala o f the trident and lotuses described in the Malinlvijaya. Or else it may consist of a vertical trident blossoming, in the centre of the diagram, into a lotus from which emerge on top and on the sides three lotus- topped tridents, thus forming the tritrisulabjamandala, the mandala of the three tridents and [seven] lotuses (see Illustration I):1 The mental m ovem ent o f the user thus appears as an ascending one, or as centrifugal: the mandala does not draw the user who meditates it to its centre, but appears to invite (and induce) a fusion through ascent to a higher level, or absorption into the shimmering luminousness of a radiating divine surface (a m andala being always the recep­tacle— the adhara— of mantras/deities who are by nature luminous). While these mandalas are different in their pattern, their ritual (and2 This was done by Stephanie Sanderson for Professor Alexis Sanderson’s 1986 article ‘M andala and Agamic Identity in the Trika o f K ashm ir.’ This very erudite paper is to date the only thorough study of the subject: the present brief survey is very largely indebted to it.

This role of mandala as a means of fusion w ith the godhead is underscored by Abhinavagupta w ho— for the m andalas described in the TA— goes as far as to identify the mandala a n d the supreme deity in TA 37.21 where he says: “because the term m a n d a [forms the word] mandala this word expresses the essence, it m e a n s Siva” (m andalam saram uktam hi m andasrutya sivahvayam ). A s Jayaratha explains, the mandala gives (la d—because of la) the essen ce which designates Siva: m andalam id m andam siva h va ya m lailtyarthah.T he TA prescribes the use of mandalas in various rituals. The m andala is mentioned in TA 6.2-4 as one o f the sthanas, the ‘places’ o n or with which rites are performed or mental concentration is practiced (the case in this chapter being the transcending o f time). F o r the TA as for all other Tantras, the mandala is the ritually d elim ited and consecrated surface where deities and supernatural entities are installed by their mantras and on which rites are to be performed. If, however, a mandala is to be used in various rituals and in ritual worship (puja), its more important use, in this treatise, is in initiation (diksa) rites. Its role is so essential to initiation that seeing the mandala may mean being initiated. TA 4.49 and 13.152 quote thus from slo ka 18 o f the Paratrimsika: adrstam andalo ’p i “even if he has not seen the mandala,” which can be understood as meaning ‘even if he is not initiated.5 In this case, however, as Abhinavagupta explains in his commentary o f the Paratrimsika, the word may be given several interpretations: it can be taken as referring to the system o f bodily cakras or wheels of power where deities reside; or to the secret ritual meeting of Tantric initiates and Yoginis (m elaka), w here the participants usually form a circle; or to the trisuiabja- m andala seen during worship or initiation, or perceived in o n e’s body (as we shall see below).

The procedure is a comparatively simple one. For this, the sacrificial surface, the sthandila, is prepared by placing mantras on it and worshipping them, installing powers and offerings in vases, and then tracing a trisiilabjam andala, a mandala o f one trident and lotuses (described in TA 31.62-85, see Illustration 2), which in this case is a gandhamandala (15.387),4 not traced with coloured powders but with perfumed substances, The initiating guru is to worship on it the three goddesses of the Trika “alone or with their consorts, or a mantradevatH’ (388), which he has installed there by their mantras. He must then blindfold the initiand with a cloth on which mantras have been placed and lead him to the mandala, make him fall on his knees and cast flowers on the mandala, after which the cloth is swiftly removed: “The initiand, suddenly seeing the sacrificial area illuminated by the supernatural power of the mantras (m antraprabhavoJlasite sthale), is possessed by them and identifies w ith th e m ” (tadavesavasac c ch isy a s ta n m a ya tva m p r a p y a te) (15.451b^452a). “As a lover perceives directly the virtues o f his beloved, in the same way [the initiand], made perfect by the descent of divine grace (saktipatasamskrtah), experiences the presence of the mantras (m antrasannidhi)” (452). This direct luminous and purifying vision of a mantra pantheon5 enclosed in the mandala is only the first step in the initiation ritual, but it can be seen as the basic one since this initial empowerment of the initiate will not only make him a m em ber o f the sect, but will also induce a perm anent state of identification with the deities of the mandala, a state that will henceforth form the basis of his initiatic spiritual life.

The ritual begins w ith the drawing of a (ritrisulabjanMiidala: “When the master wishes to promote a sam ayin to the slate of putraka, of sadhaka, or o f master (d e sik a), he must first perform the preliminary purification, then, the n e x t day, draw the mandala in the same way as for the composed sacrifice (sam udayikayageY' and elsewhere” (1—2a). The use here of th is m ore complex mandalic structure, where more deities are installed, may be taken as showing that this initiation is of a higher order than the first one. Once the mandala is drawn, the triad o f the T rika supreme goddesses, Para, Parapara and Apara, are to be placed (by their mantras) on the prongs of the three tridents and be fully w o rshipped (purnam sam pujitam ). Then, the m andala (which is apparently not made with powders) must be cleaned with a perfumed cloth (7b). After which the master, having bathed, worships, in front o f the mandala, the deities o f the external retinue, then, on its ‘d o o rs,’ the deities of the doors (dvaradevata), then, going from the north-east to the south-east, he worships Ganesa and other gods “ d o w n to the ksetrapaias” (8-9). We may note here that such prescriptions as these show that the m andala is a rather large structure. The guru is now to worship with flowers, incense and other offerings the deities installed in the m andala, starting with the adharasakti, at the base o f the trident, and up to Siva at the tip o f the tridents, the ritual being performed on each o f the three tridents. Para, Parapara and Apara with their accompanying Bhairavas are thus worshipped on the lotuses which are on the tips o f the three tridents, then the transcendent goddess M atrsadbhava— who is also P ara— in the central lotus where she abides accom panied by B hairavasadbhava.

Several deities present in the m andala are now to be worshipped. Several other rites follow, meant to infuse in the initiand the power o f the goddesses of the mandala7 and bring him to enter the path of non-duality. A practice is also described (23-26) by which the initiating master, penetrating then leaving mentally (through a pranayama practice) the deity present in the mandala, experiences an identification of his self with it (m an d a - latm aikyanusandhana), to use Jayaratha’s expression (volume 10, p. 10). Thus pervaded with the power of the mandala,8 that is, the power o f the mantras placed in this diagram, he will be all the more able to transmit this transforming power to the initiand, leading him from the lower condition of a sam ayin (or samayadiksita) to the higher one of putraka (or to the state of sadhaka, if he is a bubhuksu, one who seeks power or supernatural rewards through the mastery of a mantra).Mandalas are also used in other forms of initiation described in the TA. A mandala is used, for instance, in the funeral rite (antyesp), a kind of initiation rite, where it is to be drawn in the house o f the dead person (24.10-12) before the funeral rites are performed. It is used, too, in the initiation of somebody who is absent (whether away or dead), briefly described in chapter 2 1. In this case, after preliminary purifications o f the ritual place, o f the rice used in the ritual, of the disciple and of the mandala, the latter is used to bring about the presence o f the m antras and to satisfy them (m antrasam nidhisam trpti), since these are the powers that are to be propitiated to initiate the disciple who is absent: as Jayaratha comments, the mandala protects the disciple even if it is not seen by him. It is useful in spite of the fact that it is only one among eleven elements used to perform that initiation (21.13-15), the ritual having to be performed as richly as possible so as to satisfy fully the powers invoked in the mandala. This mandala is the trilrisuiabjaimndala, which, Abhinavagupta says (21.19-20), is so powerful that simply by seeing it, without even propitiating the mantras placed on it, [the disciple] becomes a sam ayin (m antraniandale anahute ’p i drstam sat1 Sanderson 1986: 197 shows how Abhinavagupta superimposes on the Trika deities o f the mandala the fourfold sequence o f the Krama tradition and even the system o f the twelve Kalis.*TA 17.1-3 underlines the identification of the initiating guru and the mandala."},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"sam ayitvasadhanani)— this sentence, however, is probably not to be ta k e n literally.

After the mandala has been drawn and the deity worshipped, a d d s the TA (22b-24), the guru must make with kusa grass and cow- d u n g an image of the disciple he is to initiate, in which he will instil th a t disciple’s mind (citta) so as to liberate him from his fetters b efo re the rest of the ritual is performed.T he same mandala is used for the initiation described in chapter 2 9 , which is that of the Kaula Trika. This initiation is different from th e one given to ordinary disciples. It is given by the Kaula guru to a fe w chosen disciples only— one in a hundred thousand, according to T A 29.187— that is, those who are able to perform rites (the Kaula sacrifice, kulayaga)9 where a feminine partner (dutl) plays a role and w h e r e the offerings include meat and liquor, and also sexual secretions.'\" Such rites are in contradiction to the generally admitted rules o f purity the Trika adept is supposed to respect in his outer social behavior. It is therefore to be kept secret. This is repeated several times in this chapter by Abhinavagupta, who states before describing the part of the ritual where the mandala is used (29.169): “this cannot be described clearly by me because it is secret” (na p a th y a te rahasyatvat spastaih sabdair m aya). The passage which follow s (170-174) is indeed quite obscure. I have not been able to render it very clearly in spite o f the help extended to me by Professor A lexis Sanderson whom I consulted on the subject. As Jayaratha explains in his commentary on a preceding sloka (p. 114), A bhina­vagupta refers here implicitly to the doctrine that the teachings of B hairava have four foundations, namely mantra, vidya, m udra and m andala,\" the case here being that o f the m andala, w hich is identified with the body of the performer o f the rite.

M udras, in A bhinavagupta’s view (see TA, chapter 32) bring about the identification o f the perform er with the deity which is m ade present by arising from the image (p ra tib im b a ) thus produced.

It is this [body] which is the supreme mandala, made of the three tridents, the [seven] lotuses, wheels or voids (kha) .12 There and nowhere else must the wheel o f deities be constantly w orshipped, externally and internally (1 7 2 ).13 [The performer] should first concentrate mentally on the mantra o f each [deity] (svasvam antraparamarsapurvam ), then touch [himself] with the richly blissful fluids that are produced from [the body,14 this being done] following the order o f emission and that o f resorption (srstisam haravidhina) (173).15 By these contacts, the field o f one’s consciousness is awakened and, becoming the master of that [field], one reaches the highest domain (paramam dharnan), having satisfied all the deities [which animate his senses and body] (174).

Abhinavagupta then sings the praises o f the mandala-body: “In the divine abode o f the body (dehadeva- sadane), I worship you together, o my god and goddess, night and day, with the blissful nectar that fills the vase o f offering of the heart, with the unmediated flowers of the spirit which spread their native natural fragrance, and by sprinkling over the world, bearer o f all, with the pure essence of my wondering ecstasy (Gamath-ti'rasa)”The use of mandalas is prescribed not only for initiations but also for the performance of other rituals.

W h a t is the pattern of this svastikamandala is not specified there, but i t is probably the pattern described in chapter 31, 132-154. Slokas 1 4 7 —154 o f that chapter give precise details of the aspects and c o lo u rs o f the lotus petals and svastikas of the mandala, which must n o t only be brightly coloured but also adorned with precious stones. T h e passage ends: “the sanctuary o f the god of gods who satisfies all d e s ire s must be outwardly all red and shining (jvalaruna).” That the m a n d a la should be bright, shining, is often said, but it is difficult to g a u g e how ‘bright’ these diagrams really were.

T h e re , the mandala is not identified with the body. It is felt to rise w ith in it and then to overgrow it, thus bringing about a total surpassing o f bodily existence and consciousness. This takes place d u rin g the first part of the daily ritual worship of the Saiva adept, w h o , before performing the external phase (bahya) of the worship, th e p u ja , is to place mentally in his body the pantheon o f the mandala and to identify himself mentally with it: as the saying goes, nadevo d e v a m arcayet: the officiant cannot worship a deity if he is not first form ally deified. Here, however, the deification is o f a very parti­cular and especially intense sort since the adept is expected to trans­cend mentally his identity and limited consciousness by realizing it to be identical with the non-individual divine consciousness, a process that will fuse him with the unlimited power o f the supreme godhead. Through this practice, to quote Alexis Sanderson, the p erfo rm er “ritually internalizes a metaphysical ontology.” 16 The d ia g ra m w hich is used to this end is the trisulabjamandala (Illustration 2), to be visualized by the adept as present in his body,MANDALAS IN ABHINAVAGUPTA’S TANTRALOKA 233lfi S anderson 1986: 172; pp. 172-182 o f this study describe and explain thoroughly the process and meaning o f this ritual mental worship."},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"234ANDRE PADOUXwith all the cosmic entities and deities present in it. The procedure is as follows: first, controlling his vital breaths, the adept fuses his prana and apana breaths in the samana breath, which is then burnt by the ascending udana breath blazing up from below his navel along the susum na up to the dvadasanta (or urdhvakundalini), the subtle centre deem ed to be placed twelve finger-spaces above the brahmarandhra, therefore above his body. This awakening and rising o f the kundalini is the preliminary condition for the internal installation of the mandala and for the worship of its deities. In this Yogic state o f trance, which cuts him off entirely from the surrounding world, the adept is to visualize the iris id a bjama n da 1 a as present in his body (see Illustration 3). Four fingers below his navel, he places mentally the swelling at the base of the trident and worships it as being the adharasakti, the power which supports the cosmos which he feels as present within him. Then he imagines (and worships as an ascending movement toward the deity) the staff of the trident which he sees mentally as rising in his body above the navel along the vertical axis o f the susumna up to the subtle centre of the palate (talu) through the 25 tattvas constituting the world, from the earth-tattva to those of purusa and the kancukas, which are tiered along it. Thus all the constituents of the manifest, impure (asuddha) world are present in the adept, constituting the throne o f the Trika deities. Above the palate, he visualizes the ‘knot’ (granthi) o f the trident, identified with the m aya-tattva, then he visualizes its ‘plinth’(catuskika) together with the suddha-vidya-tattva, the first level of the pure universe (suddhadhvan) which begins there and extends above m aya up to Siva. On this plinth he imagines an eight-petalled ‘lotus of gnosis’ (vidyapadm a) as the Isvara-tattva. In the centre of that lotus the adept now mentally installs Sadasiva (the 34th tattva), visualizing him as a blazing corpse (the so-called M ahapreta), emaciated because he is void o f the cosmos, gazing upward toward the light o f the absolute and laughing boisterously (attahasa).17 Sadasiva must be worshipped as made up of two and a half syllables' 8 and as dominating everything, The adept is now to visualize the three prongs of the trident rising up through his cranial aperture (on the phonic level of nadanta) from Sadasiva’s navel and17 This mad laughter is a characteristic trait o f fearsome Tantric deities.

On these he first enthrones the mantras of three Bhairavas, conceived o f as lying on the lotuses, and then, seated on the Bhairavas, the three supreme goddesses o f the Trika: first, on the central prong, Para, the supreme, white, luminous, benevolent, pouring amrta; then, on her left, Para­para, the intermediate, red and wrathful; and on her other side, A para, the lower, dark-red, furious, terrifying. The three goddesses are garlanded with skulls, hold the skull-staff, etc. Now, the adept, seeing these goddesses mentally, must worship them together with their retinues, offering them (since this is a purely mental process) the transcendental consciousness he has of the fact that the universe is an expansion of the divine power and that his own consciousness is totally fused into this divine, omnipresent reality. To perform this Yogic practice of the mandala is thus to experience the identity o f the self and of the absolute. All the fantasmagory visualized in this w ay leads the Yogin to feel dissolved into the transcendental void o f the absolute whilst being also inhabited in his body by the cosmos and its presiding deities. It is an interesting, but strange, process. If w e consider that this Yogic, visionary trance-like state o f bodily consciousness is to be experienced every day by the Saiva adept, we m ay well wonder what psychological condition is thus induced in him, what kind of perception of the world he lives with. Can one feel fused with the absolute after having filled one’s mind with such a fantastic scenery and still behave ‘normally’? O f course, these ritual practices may have been performed merely in imagination without any real inner participation of the Yogin, They may even have been limited to the mere recitation o f the mantras evoking the tattvas and the deities (mantraprayoga). But what if they were really expe­rienced? What if the Kaula adept, practising the ritual at least once every day, carried always in him this scenery? This is an interesting question— but not one to be answered here.19 On the subtle levels of enunciation (uccara) o f a bijamantra, from bindu to unmana, see Padoux 1990a: 404-411.

It is indeed so well known that ritual diagrams are often believed to be all of the same type— i.e., centred mandalic cosmic symbols— though, as Helene Brunner explained in her article, this is not at all the case. The mandalas of the Tantraloka, also described in this book, are likewise o f a different type. Cosmic diagrams of the same sort as the Sricakra are to be found in the Kubjikamatatantra, chapters 14-16, where they are to be visualized in the body, but not, apparently, to be materially drawn and used for w orship.1 This resemblance may be due to the links existing between the ancient Kubjika tradition and the somewhat more recent Srlvidya, 2 to which the Y oginlhrdaya (YH) belongs— it being, together w ith the Vam akesvarimata/Nityasodasikarnava, one o f its two basic texts. The description o f the sricakra in the first patala of the YH is worth m entioning because, rather surprisingly, it does not say how the diagram looks and how to draw it,3 but describes its apparition, its ‘descent’ (cakravatara), as a divine cosmic process, an outward cosmic manifestation of the power of the godhead which is to be meditated, visualized, and even bodily experienced by the adept. The sricakra is shown here as a diagrammatic cosmic vision rather than‘ The English o f this paper has been-— as usual— kindly checked by Mrs Barbara Bray to whom I am as always very grateful.1 See Heilijgcrs-Seelen 1994.2 This tradition is also called TripuradarSana or Saubhagyasampradaya.

The theological, metaphysical bias of the Y H ’s description is emphasized by the earliest of the three known commentaries of the YH: the DIpika of Amrtananda (13th or 14th century), w hose thought was very much influenced by the Kashm irian non-dualist Pratyabhijna system, though he was probably from South India. The YH itself is in all likelihood a work from Kashmir, and may date from the 1 1th century.'1The srlcakra, as is well known, is made up of a central triangle with a dot (bindu) in the middle, surrounded by four concentric series of triangles, themselves encircled by two concentric rows of lotus petals which in turn are encompassed by a threefold circle enclosed in a square ground forming the outer portion (see Illustration 1): nine parts altogether, each of which is called a cakra. These nine constitutive parts of the srlca kra are regarded as an expansion o f the divine power of the goddess, wherein abide all her different energies and all the deities emanating from her and forming her retinue. (These supernatural entities embody and relay her power, infiasing the srlcakra with it and therefore somehow constituting it.5) The srlcakra as shown here is thus not a mere outline, nor a mere consecrated area, but a cosmic event and reality, to be meditated, realized, interiorized by the adept through the practice of bhavana; that is, by creative identifying meditation, a practice the fundamental importance o f which in this context must be emphasized: the cosmic event, the expansion and unfolding of power o f the cakravatara is to be so intensely visualized, imagined, and felt to unfold in the cosmos as well as in the adept’s mind and body, that he identifies with it.An interesting aspect of the Y H ’s approach to the srlcakra is that its three chapters are called sam keta, the first one being the cakrasamketa. The use of this term, which means agreem ent, appointm ent, meeting, underlines the fact that what is being described there is not a mere diagram, but the diagrammatic aspect and result of the meeting, the union o f the goddess Tripurasundari4 See Padoux 1994: 42ff.

This, as suggested by Sanderson in his com m ents on B runner’s contribution to Padoux 1986: 33, would have as a consequence that it is only the structure that one can ‘trace,’ that is the mandala, and that (I quote) “when one speaks of the mandala to include the circle o f deities (devatacakram) or mantras (mantracakram) worshipped in it, then this is by extension of the primary sense,”"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"THE S R IC A K R A241a n d o f her consort, &iva/Bhairava, the common united presence of th e se two aspects of the supreme godhead in the sricakra bringing a b o u t its apparition and endowing it with their unlimited glory and pow er.After eight introductory stanzas, the first chapter begins: “When she, the supreme power, [becoming] by her own free will embodied as all that exists (visvarupinl), perceives her own throbbing radiance (sphuratta), the cakra is then being produced.” 6 It is a cosmic event: th e goddess is taking on her cosmic form.7 The YH then describes th e development and play of the divine energies of the goddess, from th e bindu in the centre to the outer square delimiting the sricakra. T h e bindu is said to issue from the initial, void (sunya) phoneme a, w h ich is the absolute. It is described (slokas 11-12), not as a mere dot, nor as the place in which to visualize the goddess, but as “throbbing consciousness whose supreme nature is light and which is u n ited with the flashing flow [of divine power],” being “the seat (baindavasana) which is the [birth]place of the flow made up o f the three m atrkas.” It thus assumes the form o f the ‘threefold m atrka w hich is to say the three planes of the word, pasyanti, m adhyam a and va ikh a rl which appear together with the inner triangle o f the sricakra.

The cakras correspond, too, to the divisions o f the cosmos called kala, from the santyatltakala, the highest, in the centre, to the nivrttikala, that o f the earth, in the square part.

The ‘descending5 cosmic structure of the srlcakra appears also in the fact that its nine cakras are regarded as forms or creations of the powers (sakti) of Siva and from this point of view are considered as divided into three groups, deemed respectively to correspond to the powers of will (iccha), knowledge (jnana) and activity (kriya) of the deity,8 “The cakra,” concludes sloka 24, “ is thus threefold. It is an aspect of ka m a ka la9 and is in reality and essence expansion (pra- saraparamarthatah).'nAfter this first cosmogonic phase, this cosmic vision, the adept must now (slokas 25—36) turn to a different sort of mental exercise. He is to ‘meditate’ (bhavayet), that is, visualize the nine portions of the srlcakra, from the outer square to the central bindu, as present in nine centres (here called padnia) of his Yogic ‘subtle’ body. 10 These nine centres are to be visualized with their shapes, colours and residing deities as tiered along the susum na, from the akulapadm a,1' situated at its base, where he mentally places the outer square (called the trailokyamohanacakra), to the ajna, between the eyebrows, where he imagines the central bindu. The movement is therefore now centripetal: the adept not only feels identified with the srlcakra and imagines or perceives it in himself; he also follows mentally, linked with his Yogic imaginary inner structure or ‘body,’ an ascending movement towards the centre of the srlcakra and thus to the supreme goddess. The movement does not, however, stop in this centre but takes on a different and more subtle (niskala) form, for the adept is now to meditate the kalas, the subtle phonic ‘parts’— the subtle8 These are— in this order of decreasing status— the three powers or energies of Siva through which he manifests the universe.9 To say that the srlcakra is kamakala is to say that it is made up o f the combined presence of Siva (kama) and Sakti (kala).10 The pattern of centres (cakra or granthi) and canals (nadf) which the Yogin is to visualize as present in his body and where the prana or the mantras flow, is often called the ‘subtle body,’ because it is a visionary, not an anatomically existing structure.

This meditation is in fact not purely phonic since all the kalas have a visual aspect or symbol which is also to be evoked: these aspects are described in slokas 27—34, which also mention the length o f time during which they are to be m entally ‘uttered ’ (uccaranakala). These fractions of time are so minute (ranging from l/4 th to l/256th of a m atra'4) that they cannot possibly correspond to any actual utterance. They rather suggest the uccara\"s growing degree of subtleness. They express or correspond to a progression of the Yogin towards a total transcending o f all empirical reality either o f form or of sound/word. The adept is indeed finally to reach the transcendent plane o f what is called m ahabindu, where he is to m editate and fuse with (to quote Amrtananda) “the supreme Siva, supreme light, the power of supreme awareness that is the supreme goddess M ahatripurasundari.” It is therefore a totally non-material (n iskala), m ystical experience o f the suprem e godhead. This transition from a diagrammatic, spatial or visual dim ension o f meditative practice to a phonic, mantric one, with the attainment of the supreme plane of the deity, is expressed in sloka 36, which is as follow s: “ W hen this suprem e energy (param a kala) sees the effulgence of the self (atm anah sphuranam), she assumes the aspect o f Ambika: the supreme word (para vak) is being uttered.” 15The notion that the meditation of a mandala should lead the adept to see or participate in the power of a deity is not uncommon.

The sadhaka having mentally attained this level is now (slo ktB 37-49) to imagine again the supreme goddess’s intent on manifesting the universe with all it contains, a cosmic process conceived, however, as developing along the pattern of the srlcakra. To quote slokas 37-40, “When she is about to manifest the universe which [she holds within herself] as a germ, assuming an oblique aspect, [she becomes] Varna because she vomits the universe (visvasya vamanat). Then, as the energy of will (icchasakti), she has the visionary [word] (pasyantf) as her body. When she is the power of cognition (jhanasakti), she is Jyestha, and the intermediate word ( m adhyam a vak) is then uttered. When the maintaining of the universe prevails, her figure spreads out into a straight line. Then, in the state of resorption she takes on the shape of the bindu. When the reverse process takes place, her body becomes [shaped like] a srngataka.'6 She is then the pow er o f activity (kriya sa kd): she is Raudri, the corporeal [word] (vaikhari), appearing as the universe.”What the adept is to realize here is the first creative movement o f the supreme goddess manifesting the inner triangle, together with four forms of energy and four divine forms o f herself, while retaining all this within herself—hence the fourth goddess, Raudri, and the return to the inner bindu.In or around this central triangle other entities are now to appear, who like the preceding ones are to be conceived o f both as existing in the cosmos and as abiding in the Srlcakra. First (slokas 41-43) are produced the four plthas, the sacred seats of the goddess, Kamarupa, Purnagiri, Jalandhara and Qdyana, described here not as abiding in the central triangle (called the sarvasiddhimayacakra) but as being in the Yogic imaginary body (in the m uladhara, the heart, the bhru- m adhya and the brahmarandhra) of the adept: the process, as we have already noted, is inseparably cosmic, diagrammatic and Yogic, these three aspects being both imagined, visualized (the colours and shapes o f the plthas are described) and bodily experienced.244 ANDRE PADOUXThe srngataka is the trapa bispinosa, the w atcr-chestnut, w hose fruit is triangular in shape.

All these elements, the m a trka , the plthas and the lingas, are described as being ‘expressed’ (va cya) by (that is, as produced by) the mantra of the goddess, the srividyo, which is taken as being fourfold (that is, the mantra as a w hole plus its three parts), and are considered as corresponding to th e five conditions or states of consciousness (avastha), jagrat, svapna, susupti, turya and turyatita. The adept thus has a vision of the srlcakra in its cosmic diversity and power. This is expressed by slo ka 50: “ [This] universe which has come forth as the cosmic outline born from her own will is consciousness, the [visible] form o f the self, uncreated bliss and beauty,” 18 Then the goddess herself, suprem e consciousness, is to be visualized in the centre o f the srlcakra embracing her consort Kamesvara, 19 both holding the goad and the noose “made up of the energy o f will” (icchasaktim aya), the bow and the arrow “which are energy of action” (kriyasaktim aya), so that the two, male and female, aspects of the supreme deity are seen as present in the diagram which they pervade and animate, as they do the cosmos, by their united power and will. To quote sloka 55: “Such is the supreme splendour, the srlcakra as her cosmic body (vapuh), surrounded by the dazzling waves of her multitudinous pow er,”20 a vision which fills the adept with wonder and awe.Having thus visualized the M cakra in its cosmic aspect over­flowing with the glory o f the goddess, the adept is now to visualize and understand the role of another group o f powers or deities resi­ding in this diagram, the Mudras, which are ten in number (slokas17 A Saiva lih g a is not necessarily o f a more or less phallic shape.

Though this is another phase in the vision and practice of the sricakra by the adept, it is not described by the YH as something he is to do, but as a development taking place in the supreme conscious­ness, in the goddess, who now takes on the aspects o f these ten goddesses, the Mudras, who incarnate and express ten different phases of her cosmic activity and power. To quote slokas 56—57: “When [the goddess] becomes luminously aware o f the universe [appearing] on the screen of her own consciousness (cidatm abhittau prakasamarsane), being fully possessed by the will to act, she acts by her own free will. [Such is] the power o f activity which, because it gladdens the universe and causes it to flow, is called m udra.” The last sentence of this stanza explains the name mudra: these deities are so called because they gladden (m odanat [V m ud]) and cause to flow (rodanat [V ru]), hence mud-ra.The first Mudra is said to pervade (vyapaka) the whole sricakra. The nine others abide each in one of the constituting cakras o f the diagram, going from the outer square to the centre: the movement is centripetal because these deities, born from the play of the powers of the goddess, incarnate or symbolize nine stages of the return of the cosmos to its unmanifest source. The adept, therefore, visualizing them and identifying somehow with each of them, realizes that “this is how the play o f the godhead’s energy of activity (k riy a), whose nature is pure consciousness, is identical with the sricakra” (k iiy a caitanyarupatvad evam cakram ayam sthitam—sloka 71). But what the adept must first and foremost always intensely meditate (sarvada bhavayet) is the supreme luminous power (param tejas) which is the willpower (iccha) o f the godhead— his attention is to be focused on the supreme, on the source of all that exists. The YH merely des­cribes these Mudras as luminous deities to be visualized as they are described, and quotes their cosmic functions. What is prescribed here is therefore only one more perception and realization o f the presence and play (here tending toward the resorption of the cosmos [sam- hara]) o f the goddess in and as her cakra: the practice by the adept remains a purely mental, meditative one. It is, however, worth noting that in his commentary on these stanzas Amrtananda describes the mudras as hand gestures the adept is to display so as to identify with the role of each o f the Mudras, so that these mudras, in practice, are at the same time deities to be visualized and worshipped and hand- gestures— an act o f mental and bodily participation and identification"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"t h e Sr ic a k r a247o f the adept with the deities: this aspect of the practice o f the sricakra s h o u ld not be overlooked.T he chapter ends by prescribing two other ways of perceiving the srica kra in meditation, first by considering it as divided into three portions each comprised of three cakras, going from the centre to the o u te r part, and then as consisting of its nine cakras, going from the o u te r part to the centre. The adept thus follows the process first of em anation then of resorption.T he chapter concludes (slokas 85-86): “This is where the great g o d d ess Mahatripurasundari is to be worshipped. [Such is] in its a b s o lu te fullness the great cakra, giver of eternal youth and im m ortality. Thus has been said, o supreme goddess, the practice (sa m k e ta) o f the great cakra of the goddess Tripura, bestower o f liberation while still in life.”T o conclude, we may note that this chapter, which at first sight looks rather disorderly, is in fact rationally constructed, emanation and resorption succeeding each other and every successive moment in creasing the awareness of and identification with the cosmic dynam ism of the sricakra. First is expounded the succession of the different parts of the sricakra (8-21), then the play o f energies that m anifest the cosmos (22-24): this is an outward tending movement m anifesting the world. After which, the bhavana of the kalas of hrim (25—36) and eventually the Mudras (56ff.) turn the attention o f the adept towards resorption, towards the centre of the diagram that is, tow ards liberation. The description of all the deities and entities present in the sricakra also manifests its power o f creation and of resorption. The adept, by visualizing and meditatively identifying w ith this cosmic play, progresses towards liberation. As an active cosm ic symbol (or as a display of the goddess’s creative and salvific action and power), the sricakra appears very efficacious.W e m ay finally note that the origin o f the sricakra remains shrouded in mystery. This ritual diagram is to be found in the older texts of the Traipuradarsana (which is the less ancient of the Kaula traditions), but where does it come from and when did it appear? We do not know. The source is probably to be looked for in the older Kubjika tradition, though this is not certain.21 A South Indian origin,21 M ark D yczkowski (personal com m unication) believes that some aspects at least o f this cakra come from the Sritantrasadbhava, a long (about 5000 stanzas) and yet unedited text which he is currently studying."},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"248ANDRE PADOUXtoo, has been suggested by some, but this theory has so far not been conclusively proved.

By the sixth century A.D., these layers had been combined to provide a tool, both religious and practical, for the constitution o f a shelter for deities and w orshippers— the temple— as a new form of Hindu worship began. T his paper explores evidence found by recent scholarship in built m onum ents for the application of such diagrams to the construction, validation, proportioning, and designing of such shelters for the first early centuries of their use.Indus Valley cities, with their gridded street plans dating from the third to second millennium B.C., have been cited as early examples o f the city as ‘pivot o f the four quarters’ (W heatley 1971) even though their rhomboidal layouts and orientation only approximate a cardinal grid. They should perhaps remain in the pre-history of South Asian urban planning (Kenoyer 1998).The mystic cosmogony of the Atharva-Veda, on the other hand, from early in the first millennium B.C., does provide us with a paradigm for cosmic planning in South Asia. In book 15 o f the Atharva-Veda, cosmic speculation and the body of man were made into a formal homology, as well as being described as if a three­dimensional m andala.1 There a vratya ascetic ‘belonging to an unorthodox order’2 is described as confronting his own divinity as1 W hitney 1905: 769 com m ents that the Culika-Upanisad “ reckons the vratya as one am ong the many forms in which Brahman is celebrated in AV., mentioning in the same verse with vratya (celebrated in AV. xv.) also the brahm acarin and the s k a m b h a and the palita.\"2 Heestcrm an 1962: 36, on the other hand, concludcd that the vrafyas were “ authentic Vcdic Aryan ... predecessors] o f the diksita.”"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"252M IC H A E L W.

In Stella Kramrisch’s retelling, “[t]he transfiguration of the Vratya has three phases: the birth of the god, the vision of that god, and the building o f his monument” (Kramrisch 1981: 89). She describes the ‘Sole V ratya’ as “a choreographed monument of deity built up by the words of hymns,” having “a mandala for a pattern” (Kramrisch 1981: 95, 93): “He moves out on his vehicle, the mind, first toward the east, then toward the south, toward the west, and finally toward the north.... [He] incorporates into his presence the four directions of the extended universe” (Kramrisch 1981: 93).Kramrisch saw this vision of the vratya ascetic—-already in the second millennium B.C.— as a forecast of her dictum that the Hindu temple of a much later period could be described as a ‘monument o f m anifestation’ (Kramrisch 1946: passim), characterizing what the vratya saw as the “lord o f the space-time universe, him self the central pillar of a four-sided pyramid” (Kramrisch 1981: 96). Yet such a ‘vision’ did not then constitute architecture nor represent a developed practice.O f several versions of the origin of the uni verse in the Vedas, “the simplest is that the creator built the universe with timber, as a carpenter builds a house” (Encyclopaedia Britannica on-line; Brown 1942, 1965). Indeed the rituals surrounding the making o f Vedic shelters provide a vocabulary for wood and reed construction (Renou 1998) and suggest the presence of a cosmography (Bodewitz 1979) by having central and cardinal orientations, but do not define a ‘generative tool’ (Bafna 2000: 45) for architecture, as may mandalas of a later period.In the building of altars (Staal 1984), bricks were laid to form an orthogonal frame, and altered to make a variety of shapes to suit different ritual purposes. Perhaps the grid o f later mandalas has one source in the piled bricks of such sacrificial surfaces. We have few texts to suggest this. We do, however, have quite early texts, Sulba- Sutras (Datta 1932), o f ca. the third-fourth centuries B.C., that provide the geometric construction, using cords to draw circles, needed to locate the square and cardinal orientation essential for the plot of a sacrificial altar (Apte 1926; Bag 1971) (Illustration 1).

[who] was subdued by the host o f gods and hurled do wn. O f the several parts of his body, each is subjected to the particular deity by which it was attacked. It is that Being of immortal substance, who ... was destined to be the dwelling-house personified [the vastupurusa].”5 He then goes on for a number o f verses (53.4-41) to describe a variety of house structures, their class linkage, orientation, storeys, balconies, etc., as if this architecture were an elaboration of the vernacular shelters of Vedic India (Renou 1998).Only at 53.42 does he introduce the division o f the plan into squares to fit the rite of sacrifice and the placement of deities from the older myth (Illustration 2): “In order to divide (the ground-plan o f a house) into eighty-one squares, draw ten lines from east to west, and ten others from north to south.”6 He discusses the placement o f 45 deities over the body of the vastupurusa for 13 verses (53.42-31 refer to K ern’s translation throughout.4 K ram risch 1946: 79 com m ents that the “ sym bolism o f the V astu p u ru sa­m andala” was “a residue o f traditions still known and practiced though no longer realized in all their import.”5 Kramrisch 1946: 73, 78 makes the important distinction that “ Vastupurusa as support of the building ... is described as lying with his face down ... whereas Agni Prajapati o f the Vedic altar lies facing upwards ” His head should lie to the north­east,'' He does not describe the location of the square required by the geometry of the Sulba-Sutras."},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"54),7 then introduces an alternative practical mandala for c o n ­struction: “One may also, should one prefer it, divide the area into sixty-four compartments” (53.55).For the remainder of this chapter (53.57-125) Varahamihira discusses vulnerable crossings (m arm an), displacement of pillars, and a range of magical associations and consequences still part o f traditional wood architectural practice today (Libersat 1988), with the significant dictum that “ [t]hc householder ... should carefully preserve Brahman, who is stationed in the centre of the dwelling, from injury ...” (53.66).8I take this time to lay out Varahamihira’s order of presentation because it is he who first puts together vastu (building), purusa (‘m an,’ but as a trace of sacrifice), and mandala (diagram), summing up many centuries of speculation on the rituals of building (53.98): “At a period indicated by the astrologer, let the householder go to a piece of ground which has been ploughed, abounds with seed grown up, has served as a resting-place of cows, or has got the approval o f the Brahmans.” He gives us a sense of the range of caste patrons (53.100): “Then— touching his head, if he be a Brahman; the breast, if a Kshatriya; the thigh, if a Vaigya; the foot, if a Sudra— let him draw a line, the first act when a house is to be built ...” and of the important role of a proficient “holder of the measuring line,” the architect or Sutradhara (53.110): “ By the measuring line snapping asunder may be predicted death; by the plug drooping its top, great sickness; by the house-owner and architect falling short in their memory, death.” Kern, Varahamihira’s translator, accused him o f having “the habit of un-critically copying his authorities” (1872: 292, note 1), and yet he is not merely summing up a m illennium of building, but marking a major transition. A new practice o f stone construction to make temples to shelter images of deities was just beginning (Meister 1986) and the utility of the vastupurusamandala was about to be given a new life (Meister 1979).254 M IC H A E L W.

Then, in a chapter (56: 1-31) with only 31 verses, he provided a brief ‘description of various temples,’ which he begins(56.1): “Having made great water reservoirs and laid out gardens, let one build a temple, to heighten one’s reputation and merit.” “The gods used to haunt those spots which by nature or artifice are furnished with water and pleasure-gardens” (56.3), he writes, then describes these in loving detail (56.4-8). He comments that the soils he had indicated “when treating o f house-building ... are likewise recommended to persons of the different classes, when they wish to erect temples” (56.9), and then, in a significant verse, he specifies (56.10): “Let the area of a temple always be divided into sixty-four squares, while it is highly commendable to place the middle door in one o f the four cardinal points.”9 It is this dictum that seems to define a new millennium o f vastupurusamandalas, to be used in practice (Illustration 3) as well as ritual.M ost remarkable to me, at the time of Varahamihira’s writing in the sixth century, is how few stone temples—-and how experimental their architecture— had by then been built (M eister 1981a). Varahamihira was on the forward cusp of a new, even ‘m odern,’ architecture meant to shelter newly manifest images (Meister 1990).The remainder of Varahamihira’s chapter is a listing o f ‘twenty kinds of shrines’ (56.17), with varied plans, storeys, turrets, and dormer windows that probably existed not in stone but in w ood.10 As he casually concluded (56.31): “Herewith are the characteristics o f temples described in compendious form.... O f the voluminous works by Manu, etc., have I, in writing this chapter, only taken notice in as much as I remembered.”The distinction between a proportional system, which the ritual vastupurusamandala is for the universe, and a constructional device, such as Varahamihira stipulates for the temple, was drawn some time ago (Panofsky 1955).n “ The notion that magical diagrams called9 Bafna 2000: 38 is not correct in stating that V arahamihira’s chapter on temples “ does not even mention the diagrams.”10 At least one engineer (Pram ar 1985) has attempted to analyze and apply a mandala designed for wooden structures to the building of stone temples.11 Panofsky distinguishes between a theory o f proportions and a practical system o f construction."},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"256M IC H A E L W.

Bafna 2000: 31 has put it another way: “ [W]hat connection could be posited within diagrams associated with a marginal religious cult [he is referring to Tantrism] and those associated with a practical profession [architecture]?” Yet it is preci­sely about the division of the plan that Varahamihira is most explicit and practical (53.42): “[D]raw ten lines from east to west, and ten others from north to south.” He is writing about a constructional device related to a proportioning system.Kramrisch herself was unsure how such a device might have w orked (Kramrisch 1946: 58): “The V astum andala is a p ro g ­nostication, a forecast and ‘ tonic’ of the contents that will be built up in the temple; it is in a literal sense, its programme. This does not imply an identity of the actual plan of the temple, with the mandala.” While she found some relationship between the simplified 16-square grid in the Matsya-Purana (Kramrisch 1946: 228), “here, it seems to have been suggested by the simplicity o f the shrine; its plain, thick walls, without buttresses, belong to small structural temples in central India of the Gupta Age ...,” of later temples she had little doubt: “W hen the great temples were built, after the ninth century and which still stand, the drawing of the Vastupurusamandala had become an architectural rite without necessarily coinciding with the laying out o f the ground plan of the Prasada.” Her conclusion was"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"V A S T U P U R U S A M A N D A L A S257n o t so different from one scholar’s recent attempt to compare square T antric painted mandalas to the elaborated ground plan o f a temple in Orissa, “ [i]f we were to accept that the mandala was typically used as a design tool, then actual built examples must show evidence of planning based on the mandala” (Bafna 2000: 38).It is, of course, this sort of evidence, collected in the field, that has gradually been accumulating over the past half century (M eister 1979, 1985; Pichard 1995; Thakur 1996).12 Buildings have perhaps proved more reliable than texts as historical documents recording the methodologies that built them (Meister 1989). This is in part because o f the multiple uses over time to which the vastupurusamandala was p u t— ritual, astrological, meditational, devotional, but also con­structional.13Referring to the Pauskara-Samhita, Apte 1987: 129 comments that “M andala worship, in those days was not a part of the temple ritual only, but often maintained its independent existence like the sacri­ficial institution (Yajna). And for that ritual ... a special pandal used to be erected on a chosen site— may be on a mountain or in a forest or by the side of a hermitage or on the bank of a river or inside tem ple premises” (Pauskara-Samhita 2,4-5). This is not so much different from the shelter set up for the ritual painting of dhulicitra in K erala— a form of ‘ bhaum ika citra’ or ‘earth painting’ (Jones 1981: 71): “ [T]he ceremonial drawing in powders may also be performed at night in an appropriate space within the precincts o f a Mambutiri Brahmana household or in a palace of a Samanta or Kshatriya ruling family. The designated area ... is traditionally covered by a canopy constructed of four slim areca logs, wrapped in new unbleached cloth, supported by pillars o f the same wood, similarly wrapped, which form the boundaries of the sacred drawing.” The image of the goddess or another deity is built up in coloured powders, then destroyed through ecstatic dance.A small but significant side current of stone temple architecture that may reflect such tem porary pandals are the thin-w alled niandapika shrines set up as funereal memorials in Central India12 See also, however, my cautionary review (Meister 1999).13 A recent review (Bafna 2000: 47) is correct to conclude that w e m ust “ look upon the V a stu p u r u s a m a n d a la as an idea that has been constantly redefined and exploited through history” but his caveat that “w hat we have m ade o f it now is merely a recently constructed understanding” may best be applied to himself."},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"258M IC H A E L W.

(Meister 1978).14 These stand in sharp contrast to the thick-walled “temples ... of the Gupta age” (Kramrisch 1946: 228), their inner sancta only twice in width the thickness of their walls. Those, at the very beginning of the stone tradition, measured their inner sacred space by the demands o f the mandala, not their walls by the efficiencies of stone (Illustration 3 A).Actual physical yantras or metal mandala plaques are buried in the foundation of structures as tools to sanctify the building. As the label to two such metal plaques recently on display in the American M useum of Natural History, New York, put it (Huyler 1999), “Yantra are specific mandala created to attract Divine Energy o f a deity into a sacred space. Made of metal or stone, yantra are buried beneath a temple’s inner sanctum during construction.” Such yantras are also drawn at significant points o f the plan in late Orissan practice (B oner 1975), but should not be confused w ith the vastupurusamandala as a whole.15To look for the application of the vastupurusamandala introduced by Varahamihira as a constructional tool or planning device in the sixth century, it is necessary to measure standing temples. Bafna 2000: 4 1 -4 2 is m istaken in claim ing “ a troubling lack o f corroborating evidence from surviving built structures.” There have been both ‘detailed studies o f individual plans’ as well as what he calls ‘comparative morphological studies’ that go well beyond im posing a ‘constraining orthogonality’ (M eister 1982, 1983a; Thakur 1990).From my own experience, however, certain procedures are important (M eister 1979, 1999). The square Gupta temples of K ram risch’s reference— Sanchi 17, Tigawa, Nachna, even Deo- garh— use thick masonry walls to surround an inner sanctum ca. half the width of the whole (Meister/Dhaky/Deva 1988). Early seventh- century shrines in Orissa (Illustration 3 A) with developed latina nagara superstructures and a cross-plan with closed doorways on14 An inscription on the seventh-century m a n d a p ik S shrine at Mahua refers to a ‘stone m a n d a p ika’ set up in honour o f a local ruler’s deceased parents.15 “The square grid would then simply be an instrument— a yantra— used for the depiction o f the vastu deities” (Bafna 2000: 45). B afna’s reference to “yantras embedded within the traditional drawings of temple plans,” however, begs the issue that no such drawings survive before the modern period."},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"V A S T U P U R U S A M A N D A L A S259three walls,16 precisely fit a constructing grid of 64 squares when measured at the root of their wall mouldings (the khura hoof o f the vedibandha)— that is, where the mandala could be drawn on the stone foundation that formed the floor level of the sanctum. These shrines well fit Varahamihira’s dictum to let “the area of a temple always be divided into sixty-four squares” and “to place the middle door in one of the four cardinal points” (56.10),In my own fieldwork (Meister 1979) I first began to measure tem ple plans thinking they would only confirm Kramrisch’s intuition that the vastumandalas specified by Varahamihira and by later texts “ had becom e an architectural rite,” as tem ples becam e more elaborate after the ninth century, “without necessarily coinciding with the laying out of the ground plan” (Kramrisch 1946: 228). However, directly measuring the mouldings of a group o f seventh- and eighth-century temples in Madhya Pradesh— in particular the seventh-century nagara temple at M ahua— first gave me evidence that architects o f this region and in this period were using a new procedure (Illustration 3 B). Standing above two levels of a stone foundation, the sanctum walls of this Siva temple measured ca. 556 cm from corner to corner (ca. 114 cm for karna and bhadra piers; 57 cm for intermediate pratirathas) at the khura hoof o f the vedibandha mouldings, which was the floor level of the sanctum. The inner space o f the sanctum measured ca. 228 cm in width.These m easurem ents embody a new paradigm for both the concept and construction o f the m ultiplying wall offsets that distinguish nagara temples in this period (Illustration 3 C). Central bhadras on the outer walls project the measure of the brahmasthana, flanking pratiratha offsets mark the dimensions o f the inner sanctum. Such a system 1 found also rigorously applied to other temples in the Gwalior region (Meister 1979). Such a use o f the mandala was new, practical, and expanded the m andala’s meaning to the temple, as a physical expression of its plan.17As a test o f the ‘constraining orthogonality,’ as Bafna 2000: 41 put it, I also measured and analyzed rectangular temples in this region and century, as well as those beginning to experiment withlf’ Kramrisch 1946: 271 interprets sadasra to be this type: “ [T]he ground plan ... has six faces, for each o f its three sides has a central buttress which is set o ff from the wall....”17 Sinha 2000 has extended this analysis o f the ‘ bhadra cluster’ to vesara temples in the Deccan."},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"260M IC H A E L W.

Rotating plans superimpose one turned square on the other, moving toward the circle (Illustration 7) that constitutes a mandala’s pre-existent form (and which surrounds the square gated palaces in the painted mandalas o f B afna’s article).18Kramrisch 1946: 62, while pointing out that “earlier texts ... do not record circular Vastus” reported that “Utpala, the tenth century commentator o f the ‘Brhat Sam hita’ describes in detail the con­struction of circular sites.... This appears a development around the principal Vastu, which is and must remain square....” She also cited Agni-Purana 93.40: “In. the middle of the six sided, three sided, and circular plan, should be the square.” Referring to Vastuvidya 7.6 and 10.15, she also observed (Kramrisch 1946: 62, note 105): “as the months advance the Vastupurusa moves ... The spatial order o f the 8 directions simultaneously denotes a temporal order; the Vastu is the time piece,... This rotating Vastu is called Caravastu and isKramrisch 1946: 41 remarked that the “square symbol o f the extended world in its order has precedencc over the circle of time, the second ornament.”"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"V A S T U P U R U S A M A N D A L A S261distinguished from the Sthira-vastu, whose position is fixed.... Temples are meant to last and are always built [i.e., founded] on the Sthiravastu.”Experiments with embedded octagons— from the octagonal stone tem ple at Mundesvari and brick temples in Daksina Kosala o f the seventh century (M eister 1981b, 1984) to the great m israka superstructure o f the Chola tem ple at G ahgaikondacolapuram (Pichard 1995)— might suggest that architects at an early period also thought in such terms of their temples (and their construction).M y own work for a period of time focused on m easuring and analyzing monuments that could provide test cases for the limits of mandala planning. I had thought that the application o f the grid of the mandala and its significance to the proportioning o f temples in the seventh and eighth centuries could not explain the variations found in the ninth and tenth. What 1 discovered, however, in Central India was a shift in construction of the temple that preserved the relation of bhadra and pratirathas to sanctum and brahmasthana while pulling the bulk of the temple within the grid (Illustration 3 D ),19 This bhadravyasa measure allowed the fabric o f the temple to be reduced, proportions in the wall to be more balanced, and new plans to emerge (Meister 1979, 1985). That the grid o f the mandala could continue to have a practical utility, even in complex and huge tem ples o f the 11th century, as at K hajuraho, was startling (Illustration 5).20 No longer fixed at the foundation as in earlier shrines (Illustration 3), yet still governing the walls enclosing the inner sanctum, the continuing presence of these proportions in the fabric of these stone monuments is perhaps our strongest surviving evidence for the “notion of a geometrical device with symbolic dimensions underlying all architectural production” (Bafna 2000: 42).21I think Bafna 2000: 43 is right that “ [p]ractically speaking, a grid is a cumbersome and complicated tool for the laying out of plans; it19 Bafna 2000: 41 mistakenly attributes this change to the seventh century instead o f the ninth.20 “ M e ister’s argum ent is sophisticated and pursuasive: the grid is only a regulative tool and the very act o f embedding it is auspicious.... But in formulating this idea, he seems to have moved a good deal away from the strict orientation and hierarchy o f the V astupurusam andala\" (Bafna 2000: 41).21 Bafna, however, resolves that the “ idea o f the governing m an dala” ... “ is merely a recently constructed understanding” (Bafna 2000: 42, 47)."},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"262M IC H A E L W.

From the time of the Sulba-Sutras, the geometry and tools for laying out a plan were known. If the Sutradhara was controller of the cord— “let him draw a line, the first act ...” as Varahamihira 53.100 had put it— he also controlled the geometry that the use of the compass made possible (Illustrations 1, 7). Such geometric con­struction gives precision; a grid establishes proportion; reference to the vastupurusamandala maintains ritual authority.Bafna 2000: 39, 41, however, calls such construction “an alternative ‘peg-and-string’ geometry” and comments that “ [t]here are no indications within the literature on the history of Indian mathematics, or within vastusastra texts, that there were two separate techniques o f geometrical constructions prevalent at any time.” Yet the constructive geometry prevalent from the time o f the Sulba- Sutras must itself be seen as the source both of the m andala’s ‘constraining orthogonality,’ in Bafna’s terms, and o f a certain freedom from it. Bafna 2000: 41 admits, “some silpa manuals specifically record peg-and-string operations to ensure a precisely oriented construction of the square perimeter of the Vastupurusa­mandala itself.”My analysis of temples with turned-square plans (Meister 1982, 1983b, 1984, 1989) beginning with the remarkable mid-eighth- century Gargaj M ahadeva temple at Indor in M adhya Pradesh (Illustration 6 B), can demonstrate both the continuing ‘ortho­gonality’ o f temple planning and its freedom from constraint. Bafna 2 0 0 0: 41 refers to ‘stellate’ plans with a ‘nonorthogonal profile,’ yet the angled buttresses of these temples must be observed as right­angled corners of turned squares22 (that is, as orthogonality unconstrained).The ground plan o f the Gargaj M ahadeva temple at Indor combines what Kramrisch 1946: 62, using Vastuvidya, has identified as sthiravastu and caravastu, marking the temple’s functions as both cosmogram and chronogram. On the walls of the temple at Indor, Siva and his family mark fixed cardinal directions; eight dikpalas,22 Previous scholars have often not observed this. Willis 1997: 60, for example, describes Indor as having a “stellate shape” with “ square and acutc projections” while his plans show obtuse corners rather than right-angled ones."},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"V A S T U P U R U S A M A N D A L A S263guardians of the quarters, stand on the intermediate rotating bhadras, facing sub-cardinal points (Illustration 6 B).23That architects— from the seventh century in Daksina Kosala to11 th- to 13th-century Karnataka, Maharashtra, and 16th-century R a ja sth a n — took the great trouble to build such com plexly constructed turned-square monuments in brick and stone (Illustration 7) must be the best evidence for “some special symbolism associated w ith the composition.”2,1 It cannot be in doubt that the constructional m echanism making possible such compositions was the simple g eo m etry o f the Sulba-Sutras—-not the grid itself, w hich is consequent— that had located sacred ground for so many centuries. Perhaps that is what the vastupurusam andala hid. B afna’s comments th at “buildings can both provide a structure for an embedded m andala, and also serve to hide it” (Bafna 2001: 46) is valid, but I would reverse his conclusion.25 It is the building that acts in place of the grid, becoming the mandala. As Kramrisch, citing the Maha- bharata, had pointed out for the palaces o f the three worlds the tem ple mimics, “ [t]hey revolved, each on its own level; they were part o f a revolving universe” (Kramrisch 1981: 414).23 This geometry, as with all p ra sa d a s, is interrupted by th ep ra g g rlva entrance to the interior sanctum.24 Bafna 2000; 44, however, calls this “ problematic.”25 “T he grid acts in p la c e o fth e building, rather than serving a s the b a sis o f i f ' (Bafna 2000: 44)."},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"264M IC H A E L W .
