Is it possible for Godto create a rock that is so heavy that even He cannot move it? So often, thisquestion is dismissed it seems, because for one, the mind cannot completely wrapitself around the question. Another reason, though, is because no matter if theanswer is “yes” or “no,” it seems to limit the abilities or power of God.Furthermore, this question seems to simply be a logical impossibility.Abhinavagupta’s form of pratyabhijñå philosophy/theology answers thisquestion, however, with a resounding “yes!” How can Abhinava claim this? Afterall, is he not claiming that God’s power and abilities are limited, even if they areonly limited by Himself, or at least compared to Himself? The answer to thisquestion is actually “yes” as well. How can this be compatible with anomnipotent Íiva? This paper is partly an endeavor to address these types ofquestions, as they apply to the pratyabhijñå philosophy of Abhinavagupta. Andin this effort, it will be revealed that the freedom, or svåtantrya, of the HighestLord (paråmeßvara) is an integral aspect in understanding how this is possible.This then, is the heart of this thesis: an attempt to come to a developedunderstanding of the idea of svåtantrya within the context of Abhinava’spratyabhijñå philosophy.In exploring what svåtantrya is for Abhinava, it will be shown that itcontains some important similarities with the traditions of Vedånta and Såμkhya."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"2This is expressed in the fact that all three categorize their specific concept of theabsolute as being free from limitations and obstacles. However, for Abhinava,svåtantrya still has many differences from the other traditions, most noticeablywith its connection to action. Because of this, unlike a tradition like Vedånta, theultimate principle is seen as having agency.At the root of explaining how Íiva has agency, Abhinava articulates thatconsciousness (prakåßa), unlike for Vedånta, has the innate capacity for self-referral (vimarßa), and therefore self-consciousness. He identifies this aspect ofÍiva as being that which allows Him to have complete svåtantrya, which mustinclude agency. Furthermore, because of action’s unified nature with knowledge,svåtantrya also entails the power of knowledge. This investigation eventuallyleads to the understanding that Íiva, as explained by his svåtantrya, is able toaccomplish the impossible. It is this propensity for the impossible, then, due tothe svåtantrya of Íiva, that creation occurs, which can be defined as the self-limitation of the unlimited Lord. It is because of this svåtantrya that Íiva is ableto create a rock that even He cannot move, and this is most thoroughly expressedby the fact the Íiva is the limited and bound soul (the paßu).Within the duration of this endeavor, there will be two primary texts ofAbhinava’s used. One is the third section of the Áßvara Pratyabhijñå Viv®tiVimarßin¥ (IPVV), which is a commentary on the commentary by Utpaladeva onhis own Áßvara Pratyabhijñå Kårikå. The other text is the Áßvara PratyabhijñåVimarßin¥ (IPV), which is a commentary on the actual Áßvara Pratyabhijñå Kårikåof Utpaladeva."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"3When dealing with works like Abhinavagupta’s philosophy/theology, it isimportant to acknowledge their unique and peculiar nature. Abhinava’s writing isnot meant to purely be used for intellectual inquiry and debate, although it doessupply plenty of opportunity to do so. Harvey Alper, in his illuminating essayabout the concept of prakåßa in Abhinava’s thought, highlights this aspect of thewritings. “For Abhinava metaphysical argument is no end in itself; the finalarbiter of an argument’s success has to be not whether it compels agreement, butwhether it induces an appropriate religious response.”1 This sense of prioritysubordinates the goal of a nice and tidy systematic and thoroughly logicallyconsistent exposition. Alper, although thinking it is possible, is even ambivalentas to whether Abhinava articulates an actual system.2 I would proffer the ideathat because of Abhinava’s sense of priority, his style of writing can be confusingand seemingly contradictory at times because of several reasons, all which relateto the spiritual, intellectual, and religious context of the works.First of all, these texts grew out of a context in which oral tradition carriedgreat import. Of course, there are a number of reasons why this was the case, butprominent among them certainly is the importance of the role of the guru in thesetraditions. From initiation to spiritual guidance, the guru is often understood as anecessary aspect of being a disciple within Kaßmir Íaivism. One cannot get this,obviously, from a text. According to Douglas Brooks, “in every case, the   1 Harvey Alper, “Íiva and the Ubiquity of Consciousness: the Spaciousness of an ArtfulYogi,” Journal of Indian Philosophy 7 (1979), 382.2 Alper, 383: “Does Abhinava have a system in the strict sense? I think so, though I amnot certain.”"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"4presence of the living guru is assumed to be the final arbiter of tradition.”3Therefore, according to Brooks, one is dependent on the guru in order to properlyunderstand the meaning of Kaßmir Íaivaite texts. In essence, in order to preserve,protect, and to assure the greatest level of accuracy in interpretation, the texts areseen by many to be intertwined with the guidance of a living teacher. Without theproper teacher, there may be aspects of the text that remain in the dark for thereader, or worse, wrongly understood.It also seems that Abhinava writes in such a way that he purposelyconfuses the reader. This is rather easily facilitated by that fact that Abhinavadoes not reject the “every-day” experiences of human beings. He accepts thatthey are real. He does want to change our understanding of them, though, basedon his understanding of reality. In this process, the reader may actually have toaccept, at least hypothetically, Ahbinava’s recontextualizing of every-day life.This is not easy for the reader. What this serves as a testament to is the greatdifficulty of restructuring the way an individual imagines and experiences reality.With Abhinava, much of this reorientation deals with helping the reader get pastthe dualistic way of thinking, which is fundamental to the state of being a boundindividual, a paßu. Because of this non-dual, but very dynamic worldview, onemust be able to see things differently, in a way that overcomes isolationism andneat, tidy categories, as indicated by Alper: “One of the goals of his theology is,therefore, to demonstrate at one and the same time the diversity of connotation   3 Quoted in the foreword to Hughes, by Lance E.

It is the claim by Paul Muller-Ortega, KamalakarMishra, Lakshman Jee, and even Abhinava that one cannot even understand theteachings fully unless that person has also experienced what the texts are talkingabout. Muller-Ortega is so adamant about this that it is worthwhile to quote himat length:Moreover, as we shall see, the Kaula teachings are not so much aphilosophy as they are a method for the attainment of enlightenmentexperiences. While one might wish to garner from initiation someinsights to assist in deciphering difficult points of doctrine and obscuretechnical terms, in fact, the esotericism of the tradition does not actuallylie so much with doctrine. Instead, the tradition’s esoteric nature relatesto its discussion and description of nonordinary states of reality. Thus itis not appropriate to approach Abhinavagupta’s tantric formulations asone would approach a rational system.... Thus the tradition is esoteric inlarge measure because ultimately it is necessary to undergo the processof experiential replication before the symbols will speak to uscompletely. Abhinavagupta makes this precise point in stating that onlywhen the lotus of the Heart has been opened by the “descent of energy”will the truth be revealed. Not even the most acute reasoning powers inthe world could produce this revelation. Once the Heart has been“opened,” continues Abhinavagupta, discursive thought can penetrateever more closely to the Ultimate.5With that being said, however, analyzing Abhinava’s writing within thescholarly context is not necessarily a fruitless endeavor. Abhinava did not meanfor his writings to only be spiritual guidance for his disciples, because his writings   4 Alper, 3485 Paul Eduardo Muller-Ortega, The Triadic Heart of Íiva: Kaula Tantricism ofAbhinavagupta in the Non-Dual Shaivism of Kashmir (Albany: SUNY Press, 1989), 14."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"6like the IPVV and the IPV include the literary form of refuting opposingtraditions, like Buddhism, Såμkhya, Vedånta, and VaißeΩika.All three, Såμkhya, Vedånta, and VaißeΩika, are classical Indiantraditions. Såμkhya is a dualistic tradition that reduces all of reality down to twoessential entities: PuruΩa and Prak®ti.

We may not be able to paint a complete portraitof Abhinava’s life, but there is some useful information known. Abhinava wasborn in Kashmir sometime in the mid- to late- 10th century.6 According toJayaratha’s commentary on Abhinava’s Tantråloka, he was a yogin¥bh ̈, orsomeone whose father is a siddha and mother is a yogin¥.7 This lets us know thatAbhinava was born into a pious family, and indeed, he grew up within the Íaivatradition. He became a voracious student of a multitude of traditions, to the pointof actually studying under recognized masters of even competing traditions to hisown.8 His abilities were undeniable. Eventually he became a master in his ownright and administered to his own students, for whom much of his writing wasmeant.9 His scholarly acumen was of great renown, as even today, he isrecognized as one of the great Indian thinkers and writers of philosophy, ritual,and ascetics. Despite this, his greatness is often times overlooked. Paul Muller-Ortega sees him as, “A figure who is perhaps second in importance and influence   6 K.C. Pandey, Abhinavagupta: An Historical & Philosophical Study (Varanasi:Chaukhamba Amarabharati Prakashan, 2000), 6. According to K.C.

Hisreputation grew to the point where, “he was recognized to be the spiritual head ofall Íaiva sects.... For this purpose there was a great congregation of greatspiritualists, both male and female, in Kashmir.”11 Abhinavagupta alsorecognized this spiritual aspect of himself. “By the time he started to write hisÁßvara Pratyabhijñå Viv®ti Vimarßin¥ he had attained the state of j¥vanmukta.”12 Aj¥vanmukta is one who has attained liberation, or mokΩa, in the body. In otherwords, throughout many traditions including Kaßmir Íaivism, an individual canbecome free from the cycle of rebirth and reach the highest religious goal whilestill living as a human being. “He himself says in the beginning of the abovework [IPVV] that the present body is the last of his earthly existence.”13 WhatAbhinava implies in this claim is that he believed himself to have reached Íiva-realization, the goal in a Íaivaite’s life, but while still in the body. Allowing forliberation in the body was one way that the non-dual Íaiva traditions of Kaßmirasserted their superiority over their competitors, the dualist Íaiva Siddhåntatradition that only allowed for liberation after death. Therefore, Abhinava wouldno longer be reborn, and that was his last earthly body. Indeed, he was evenrecognized as an “incarnation of Ír¥kaˆ†ha.”14   10 Muller-Ortega, 19.11 Pandey, 20.12 Pandey, 23.13 Pandey, 23.14 Pandey, 20.

He is still revered today as a philosopher and a spiritual figure.From a philosophical standpoint, what is of the greatest importance inAbhinavagupta’s thought, and indeed, Kaßmir Íaivism as a whole, is the finalsyncretic product. The foundational ideas that make up the final product,however, have been primarily extracted from other traditions. “In one sense thereis nothing new in the Íaivism of Kaßmir at all. One could argue that in it nofundamental innovation appears, yet the arrangement of traditional elements isstrikingly original.” 15 In a way, Abhinava’s life as a sponge-like student16mirrors the historical reality of these traditions and their syncretic nature. Andjust like the other traditions which surrounded Kaßmir Íaivism as it developed,Abhinava’s worldview implements and expands upon the cosmologicalframework formally instigated by Såμkhya.Now I will define some basic terms while giving a broad overview ofAbhinava’s pratyabhijñå thought.The Såμkhya, as well as Abhinava’s, cosmological framework is based ona collection of tattvas. “Tattva” can be translated with a number of differentwords, including element, principle, archetype, or category. Essentially, they are   15 Alper, 347.16 “His Tantråloka is a living testimony of the great zeal with which he pursued the studyof the ÅAgamas and of the unparalleled proficiency which he acquired in them” (Pandey,14)."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"10understood as those general categories that make up all of creation (at leastaccording to Såμkhya). According to K.C. Pandey:A Tattva is that which lasts through the ‘small dissolution’ of theuniverse and is always present in its effects, in its collocations, or in thebeings marked by certain characteristics peculiar to itself. It is pervasivein so far as it forms the basis of all the collocations belonging to thatcreation, of which it is the chief constituent.17The tattvas, then, form the template from which all of creation is made.Abhinava’s philosophy, like other forms of Kaßmir Íaivism, does includethe twenty-five tattvas as articulated by the Såμkhya. However, that does notmean the understanding of these twenty-five tattvas is the same for both.For Såμkhya, the two foundational tattvas are PuruΩa (Person, in thesense of soul) and Prak®ti (Nature). The ultimate goal is to isolate PuruΩa, themasculine element, from Prak®ti, which is understood as feminine. Thisseparation and isolation is called kaivalya. Therefore, precedence is given toPuruΩa, and a spirit-matter dualism is created. Even though Abhinava acceptsboth categories, instead of accepted the schism between the two, he, to a certaindegree, subordinates PuruΩa to Prak®ti:[Etymologically defining the word Pradhåna, the primary, a synonym forPrak®ti],18 the prefix ‘pra’ indicates it is prathama, first, while the “dhå”means placed. The world is placed first in Nature, [not PuruΩa], in the   17 Pandey, 357.18 One may notice the extensive use of bracketing in Biernacki’s translation of the IPVV.It is used for a number of reasons including the following: filling in the blanks, so tospeak, of implied words and phrases within the Sanskrit; pointing out relevantimplications of the current statements; as well as, offering commentary or interpretationsof difficult passages. Also significant is the fact that the IPVV is a commentary on a lostcommentary, and so there is much to be added and explained."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"11process of creation. And it is absorbed in the dissolution (pralaya) intoNature (Pradhåna).19Instead of being separate in quality, PuruΩa is actually seen rooted in Prak®ti.This is confirmed in the following quote:[the puruΩa] is approached from the perspective of Nature and there itsexistence is from and in the world.20This conflation has drastic ramifications on Abhinava’s understanding of thetwenty-five tattvas, which will primarily be addressed later. For now, though, itis relevant to point out that Abhinava is denying the “ultimate” quality given to itby Såμkhya. Instead of it being the highest Subject, according to Abhinava, thePuruΩa is the limited soul connected to subjectivity that cannot separate from thebinds of Prak®ti. Indeed, the PuruΩa is made up of Prak®ti, of nature, for it isentrenched within the framework of Prak®ti, and therefore, its existence isdependent upon it.Combined with this placing of the nature of PuruΩa within the context ofPrak®ti is the fact that, unlike Såμkhya, for Abhinava, PuruΩa is not seen as oneof the highest tattvas. We will see eventually that, in fact, PuruΩa is within therealm of impure creation. Effectively, what Abhinava does is accept the highest   19 All translations from the IPVV are taken from Loriliai Biernacki, “The ÁßvaraPratyabhijñå Viv®ti Vimarßin¥” (Ph.D. diss., University of Pennsylvania; UMIDissertations, Michigan, 2000), 302.

Abhinava essentially demotes the Såμkhya PuruΩa.From this PuruΩa- Prak®ti foundation flow the final 23 tattvas, accordingto both Såμkhya and Kaßmir Íaivism. It may be worth pointing out that thetattvas are those principles that make up the pattern to be followed in theconstruction of all creation. Everything in creation is subsumed under one groupor another, and each group has a corresponding tattva that pervades throughout allmembers of its group. For instance, the earth tattva pervades throughout all thoseobjects that are defined by the earth tattva, such as a pot, a tree, etc. Some tattvassuch as Prak®ti pervades throughout a much larger group, since it pervades allevolutes that extend from it, including the earth tattva. In this way, the cosmos iscreated and effectively categorized, from stars to mantras. We will now gothrough them. The fact that Prak®ti is the basis for PuruΩa points to part of the essenceof the Prak®ti tattva. Prak®ti is the root of all the rest of the twenty-three tattvas asespoused by Såμkhya, meaning the other tattvas come from, or out of Prak®ti.This is related to the fact that in the order of manifestation, the grosser elementsalways are preceded by the more subtle.21 Furthermore, each subsequent tattvaproceeds from the immediately preceding tattva, as well as Prak®ti.   21 IPVV, 304. The definition that the IPVV gives for “subtle” is not something that issmall, “but rather a form which is devoid of constituent parts, has a very fine nature andwith regard to the whole class of products, effects, has a form which is pervasive. The‘gross’ should be considered to be the opposite of this” (IPVV, 296)."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"13After Prak®ti and PuruΩa, then, comes the tattvas that make up the innerorgan of the individual: buddhi (intellect), ahaμkara (ego), and manas (mind).Following this group are the indriyas, both of knowledge (buddh¥driyas) andaction (karmendriyas). Next come the tanmåtras (subtle elements), and finallythe mahåbh ̈tas (the great, or gross, elements).Starting in reverse order from the order of creation (or manifestation,arising from Prak®ti), the grossest tattvas are the mahåbh ̈tas, which are five intotal (again, starting from the grossest, to the most subtle of the mahåbh ̈tas):earth, water, fire, air, and ether. These help to make up the material objects allaround in the world.The tanmåtras are smell, taste, form, touch, and sound. “Tanmåtras aresubtle elements, and potential states that exist as the ground of the five grosselements.”22 There is a resemblance here to the forms of Plato.More subtle than the tanmåtras are the five karmendriyas, or organs ofaction: genitals, anus, feet, hands, and voice. One misunderstanding of thekarmendriyas is that they are the actual physical organs of the body. Abhinavacorrects this error:The organs of action are especially designated and appointed to differentparts of the body, and each perform their unique activities, but thefunctions themselves pervade the whole body. Therefore if the hand isbroken, the two arms can also take things, and so on.23In other words, the karmendriyas really are the mode of action, as opposed to thephysical body part, for those would be connected to the mahåbh ̈tas.   22 Hughes, 63.23 Hughes, 301."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"14The buddh¥ndriyas come next, and like the other groups, consists of fivetattvas as well: nose, tongue, eye, skin, and ear. These are the tattvas that gatherknowledge from the world, but again, are not the actual physical organs. While the buddh¥ndriyas act as the means to perception, the manas (mind)sorts through and arranges the knowledge gathered through the senses. Thesecond tattva within the inner organ is the ahaμkåra (literally, the “I-maker”),which is responsible for forming the ego, which is the idea most people living inthe world have of themselves, of who they are. Because of the ahaμkåra, peoplehave the impression “This is me, I am so-and-so.” The final tattva within theinner organ is the buddhi, or the intellect, which is involved in conceptualknowledge.Unlike Såμkhya, however, Abhinava does not stop with just these twenty-five tattvas. Directly preceding PuruΩa and Prak®ti are the five24 kañcukas, orcovers. All five of them are niyati, kåla, råga, kalå, and vidyå.Niyati is sometimes translated as fate, and it is a restricting action upon theSubject (i.e. PuruΩa) as well as every object. “It is that power that limits thecausal efficiency of every thing. It is because of this that fire only burns and thesesame sprout comes out of the sesame seed only.”25 Kåla is the limitation of time, and may be compared to Kant’s idea oftime, where the subject imposes upon the objective world time. Because of this,   24 Sometimes, the kañcukas are known as six, then including Måyå with the other five.25 Pandey, 375."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"15then, the subject sees the world through the “lens” of time.26 The normal humanbeing has difficulty trying to imagine the world outside of the parameters of time,and this, according to Abhinava, is due to the covering kåla.Råga is the covering translated as “attachment”. This tattva includes bothattachment and aversion, which often results in desire. It is demonstrated by theperson, “who says, ‘let it be so, let this be mine.’”27The fourth and fifth coverings are: kalå, the limitation of one’s capacity for action and vidyå, the limitationof one’s capacity to know....28It is because of the kalå and vidyå kañcukas that people can only do so much, andonly know so much too.As one can gather from the individual definitions, the covers arelimitations on all objects and individual souls, thus the use of the word “cover.”They literally cover, or box in and limit. However, even though limitations, theyalso are what give what limited power each individual actually has:Time and the limitations of action and so on, [the five sheaths] fill outthe individuality of the subject, giving each individual its own nature.29We see here how Abhinava has already gone well beyond the conception ofPuruΩa being the highest tattva that Såμkhya has. By subordinating the PuruΩabelow even the kañcukas, Abhinava gives a strong critique of the Såμkhya notionof the isolation (kaivalya) of PuruΩa.   26 For Kant, the same thing applies for space as well. According to Swami LakshmanJee, it is the niyati tattva that encompasses the idea of the limitation of space.27 IPVV, 291.28 IPVV, 291.29 IPVV, 294."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"16Directly preceding the kañcukas in the order of succession within thehierarchy of tattvas is Måyå. Måyå is also sometimes seen as a sixth kañcuka aswell, for it is actually the root and foundation for them. Furthermore, Måyå is thefoundation of the whole world, of every tattva articulated within the Såμkhyasystem:But having agreed with the Archetypes [in Patañjali’s doctrine] it isappropriate to designate them as Energies of Måyå.30At this point, it is necessary to point out, in order to gain a broaderappreciation of the essence of Måyå, that reality according to Abhinava is non-dual. It is not erroneous to say that within this tradition of Kaßmir Íaivism, onlyÍiva exists, or is real. After exploring all the tattvas up to Måyå, it is a legitimategripe to wonder how all this can be just one. Why speak of all these other tattvasthen? Måyå is part of the answer to this question:The Archetype of Måyå, is not accepted merely as the material cause inthe body and as separate [from the Lord, as in the case in Såμkhya withPrak®ti], but rather is considered as the inseparable Energy (Íakti) of theSupreme Lord. In fact the categories of earth and so on are only justforms of the Energy of the Supreme Lord.31In other words:Hence in this way all beings have Íiva as their inherent nature, becausewithout him they would lack any real inherent nature.32This, then, is one of the absolute foundational truths about reality, according toAbhinavagupta.   30 IPVV, 303.31 IPVV, 270.32 IPVV, 270."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"17However, the tattvas really do exist, and Måyå, in fact, serves as thebeginning of the impure creation, as opposed to the pure creation. This meansthat everything from earth to Måyå makes up the impure creation. The reasonwhy it is the impure and “lower” creation is because it is the realm of duality. “Inthe former the idea of unity predominates, but in the latter that of duality orplurality preponderates. This may be considered to be a typical point ofdistinction between the pure and the impure creations.”33 The reason for thecreation of this duality is, in fact, Måyå, for it is the principle of obscuration andlimitation:By nature [Måyå] only conceals.34It conceals the fact that reality is non-dual, and that is Íiva.We have now completed the description of the impure creation with Måyå,even though hierarchically speaking, this part of creation actually begins withMåyå. For the description of the pure creation, we will start with the top of thehierarchy from the most subtle, and work our way down to the least subtle. At thetop of the hierarchy of those tattvas in the pure creation is Íiva, the highest of alltattvas. Even more, Íiva is ultimately the only principle. The references in theIPVV to this truth are numerous:he shows that everything is the Archetype of Íiva alone and this highesttruth—Íiva—is the reality of all beings.35   33 Pandey, 370-371.34 IPVV, 278.35 IPVV, 256."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"18The Íiva Archetype alone is the [real] essence, the body of all entities.36“On the wall [of the world which is itself Íiva] the shining of the pictureof all beings”—This statement indicates the effort of the author toascertain the nature of all these.... And the purport of the entire corpus ofscriptures means to indicate that the Íiva Archetype alone is [all this].37At this level, there is only pure subjectivity, and its nature is pure consciousness(cit). Here, the experience is simply “I,” it is described as pure and unadulterated“I-ness.”Íakti tattva is understood as the energy of Íiva, and so really, is notdifferent. In fact, often times one sees this fact indicated by the term Íiva- Íakti,to indicate one is not greater or even different than the other. For how can oneseparate the energy of Íiva from Íiva? Therefore, the impression here is still only“I.”After Íiva- Íakti comes Sadåßiva, which is the next step lower, or “moregross” level. At this level, the world (“This”) is just starting to sprout, but in anindistinct manner. However, there definitely is the slight manifesting of “This,”so the experience is understood to be “I am this,” with the emphasis on the “I-ness.” Because of this indistinctness of the world at the level of Sadåßiva, it isconnected with the action of withdrawal (of the world):These elements [and Subjects and objects] resting in the state ofSadåßiva do have a slight portion of contact with “This-ness” [unlike inthe state of Íiva where “This”-ness appears not at all].

At this level the “I” gets reemphasized,so the experience is “I am This.”[This level is said to be pure] because [even though here in theArchetype of Pure Science, Íuddhavidyå] things have reached the levelof object, of “thing” to be perceived, the state of “This”—[still] byexamining and perceiving them accurately their real existence asawareness, as pure consciousness streams out.40The defining feature of the pure creation is that it is devoid of duality, whereas theimpure entails that a duality exists, albeit only in the consciousness of thosebeings within the impure creation.

Yet its action ismuch different, as disclosed in the following verse:The Energy of [pure – Íuddhavidyå] Science illuminates his real inherentnature of lordship for the one in a state of bondage. On the other hand,that which obscures is called Måyå.44Indeed, it is Íuddhavidyå that allows one to overcome the oppression of Måyå andbreak through from the impure creation to the pure creation, from duality to non-duality.So [Måyå] is in fact different from the Energy, which is vidyå, Science,Wisdom, which illuminates one’s true form.45At the risk of overemphasizing the notion of non-duality, again, Íiva is theone, true reality of Abhinava’s philosophy/theology. There is no “other.” In anydiscussion of Abhinava’s philosophy, Íiva truly is the only subject! There being   41 IPVV, 274.42 IPVV, 274.43 “because they are firmly rooted in a state of ‘This-ness’, they are inferior” (IPVV, 276).44 IPVV, 277.45 IPVV, 278."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"21only Íiva, Íiva is the creator, that which is created, and also the way that creationoccurs. The one reality is pure consciousness (cit), and therefore, every tattva,every aspect of creation has at least a latent trace of consciousness in it. On thislevel of discussion, there is really nothing more to be said that could add to one’sunderstanding of the non-dual nature of Abhinava’s thought.There is, however, much more to be said about Abhinava’s philosophy.Íiva is often spoken as having a two-fold nature:Although the form of the conscious is in its highest reality the nature ofthe expanse of Light (prakåßa) and an Active Awareness....46Despite this two-fold nature, it is important to point out that the two-fold naturedoes not designate two different entities, nor does it even designate two differentparts of a single entity. So an analogy such as “two sides of the same coin,” doesnot fit here. The analogy of a fire works much better.In this analogy, prakåßa is the light, or the illuminating quality of a fire.Thus, Biernacki tends to translate it as “Light,” and Alper translates it as“illumination.” Like so many other terms, prakåßa can be translated with aplethora of English words, but without any single one necessarily encompassingthe full meaning of the relevant term. Perhaps it is best if we would translateprakåßa as “shining, illuminating light”! For Íiva is self-shining (indeed it mustbe in order to be non-dual), just like fire. Íiva also illuminates objects, like fire(although a different dynamic is involved since Íiva actually is illuminatingpurely itself when “other” objects are illuminated). However, prakåßa’s essence   46 IPVV, 257."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"22as a shining, illuminating light is more than the normal understanding would be oflight. Alper points out that, “while ultimately identical to the subject, to Íiva, tocit, as cosmogonic prakåßa serves as the impersonal prime ‘matter’ out of whichand within which multiplicity is chiseled.”47 In other words, prakåßa serves asthe conceptual matrix and material cause of creation. “In this sense prakåßa isstructurally parallel to such notions as prak®ti in Såμkhya, and måyå in some sortsof Vedånta.”48Vimarßa, then, would necessarily serve as the efficient cause. It isimportant to mention, though, that ultimately, there is no difference between theefficient and material cause, for there is no difference between prakåßa andvimarßa. “Abhinava’s vision of the cosmic process as ultimate, just like theVedåntin’s analysis of Brahman, tends to undercut any ultimate distinctionbetween an efficient (nimatta) and a material (upådåna) cause.”49 Therefore, thematerial cause is the efficient cause. In other words, vimarßa is the aspect of Íivaconnected with action. Just as the shining, illuminating fire is able to change itsown form, and even the form of objects it comes in contact with, vimarßa is theaspect that indicates Íiva’s ability to actively create (albeit in His own image). Itis a reflective awareness that includes agency. This is ratified by the followingcitations from the IPVV:This is because of the mutual inseparability of jñåna, Knowledge andkriyå, Activity which have the respective natures of expansive Light andActive Awareness.50 And “that” alone is the highest ultimate nature ofall entities. Because of this the Lord does have the freedom to manifest   47 Alper, 376.48 Alper, 398.49 Alper, 365.50 “Active Awareness” is how Biernacki translates vimarßa."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"23this expansion [which is the universe] and to perform all the five acts [ofcreation, maintenance, etc.] by means of accepting the power of kriyå,action.51Action, which is really the nature of Active Awareness....”52This power of Íiva, action, which has as its nature vimarßa, points to themajor difference between Abhinavan thought and Advaita Vedånta. Vedåntadoes admit the ultimacy of consciousness, but it denies it any self-consciousnessand action. Therefore, the picture it paints is of a static Brahman (its absolute, theparallel of Íiva) as the only true reality. The question then becomes, “whatcreated this world, even if it is illusion?” According to the Vedåntin, it is due toMåyå, but because Brahman does not have any agency, Måyå must either be thepower of some other entity, or it is an independent power in its own right. Eitherway, according to the critics of Advaita Vedånta, Brahman is not only adepressing concept (for who wants the ultimate goal to not include action andself-consciousness), but also leads to a dualism, one of the things that is meant tobe avoided.Because of the agency of Íiva, however, Abhinava is able to explain thecreation of the world without introducing another category or concept. Due to itspower (ßakti), Íiva creates the multiplicity of the universe, all of which can becategorized as åbhåsas. Often times translated as “appearance”, or“manifestation”, åbhåsas really do encompass everything in creation:   51 IPVV, 257.52 IPVV, 261."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"24All that appears; all that forms the object of perception or conception; allthat is within the reach of the external senses or the internal mind; all thatwe are conscious of when the senses and the mind cease to work, as inthe state of trance or deep sleep; all that human consciousness, limited asit is, cannot ordinarily be conscious of and, therefore, is simply an objectof self-realisation; in short all that is i.e. all that can be said to exist inany way and with regard to which the use of any kind of language ispossible, be it the subject, the object, the means of knowledge or theknowledge itself, is ÅAbhåsa.53Some people, however, have not taken the proper “shining” toward theidea of åbhåsas, and even though they accept them as the nature of all creation,they tend to present them as an appearance in the sense of an image, copy, orreplication of another object.54 There is the idea that åbhåsas, within Abhinava’sthought, are actually not real, and perhaps even illusory.55 This may bemisleading, even if it is more a matter of emphasis than ontological claim.According to Alper, “Abhinava by and large repudiates those theories ofappearance which emphasize the secondary or unreal nature of that whichappears, which portray appearances as being no more real than ghostly objectsreflected in glass.”56   53 Pandey, 320.54 One example is Kamalakar Mishra who claims that, “At the very start it should bemade clear that when Abhinavagupta calls the åbhåsa real, he never means to suggestthat the åbhåsa is a real material thing and not an illusory appearance.... Abhinavaguptadoes not grant ontological reality to the world like that of a material thing.” KamalakarMishra, Kashmir Íaivism: The Central Philosophy of Tantrism (Delhi: SriSatguruPublications, 1999), 209.55 In fact, this is a not too uncommon problem in the understanding of Abhinava’sthought. There is a tendency of some to implement a Vedåntic understanding of theworld within an interpretation of Kaßmir Íaivism. This is unfortunate since part ofAbhinava’s work was polemical against the Vedåntists, Buddhists, etc. For a shortcriticism of this modern tendency to read a Vedåntic interpretation into Abhinava, seeLarson, Gerald J, “L.N. Sharma, Kashmir Íaivism,” Philosophy East and West 18 (1979).56 Alper, 361."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"25Instead, to maintain the non-dual nature of Abhinava’s thought, åbhåsasmust be understood to have Íiva as their very nature. In fact, it is not just tomaintain the non-dual reality, but it is Abhinava’s claim that to know anything atall, there must necessarily be a non-dualism, and therefore, “for knowledge to bepossible the svar ̈pa [nature] of the object must be prakåßa [illuminating light].”57In other words, åbhåsas have for their nature (svar ̈pa) Íiva, as He serves as thematerial cause for all creation.This may entail the true reality of åbhåsas, but their nature is still not soblack and white. Alper illustrates this thoughtfully:It is difficult to find a happy English equivalent for åbhåsa. Bytranslating it as ‘appearance’ I do not mean to imply that it means ‘whatsomething looks like.” On the contrary, åbhåsa is the objective aspect ofevery cognitive event, it is ‘that which has appeared’. As Abhinava usesthe term, an åbhåsa is never the ‘image’ of something else, it is itself theultimate objective element in the cognitive world. Hence, åbhåsa isclosely allied with prakåßa: to say that objects are illumined is to say thatåbhåsas appear. To say that god appears as the world (or that objectsarise in god) is to say that god is constantly becoming the stream ofåbhåsas. How god generates åbhåsas and how our view of them isdistorted by måyå so that we see them in isolation from god are separatequestions which are not directly relevant here. It should, however, beobserved that, in accordance with his two-level (really multi-level) visionof reality, Abhinava seems to hold that åbhåsas are only relativelyultimate, that is, they are ultimate within the sphere of the perceptible,cognitive world, but they are sublatable by consciousness as such (orgod) which in some sense does transcend them.58This loaded statement captures some of the ambiguity involved in thenature of “things,” of åbhåsas, but this is not necessarily a bad thing. Theambiguity of Abhinava’s thought is sometimes necessary and intentional on hispart. It is hard for a human being to imagine the world as Abhinava describes it:   57 Alper, 354.58 Alper, 392-393."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"26as a fluid and dynamic ever-changing divine event. However, I would suggestthat Alper’s claim that our view of åbhåsas being distorted by Måyå as beingirrelevant to the task at hand is not completely right. For it is that very distortionby Måyå that makes our understanding of åbhåsas ambiguous! The reason, then,why åbhåsas can be claimed as “relatively ultimate” is because most people seeobjects as finite, independent entities, when really they are the absolute ultimate,for their nature is Íiva.When one truly sees all åbhåsas as themselves, when he or she breaksdown the boundary between “I” and “This,” the true nature is then realized—“Iam Íiva!” This is Íiva-realization, the closest thing to a goal according toAbhinava’s teachings. Really, though, everyone is already realized, and so Íiva-realization is not a goal, for there is nothing to be accomplished, nothing to strivefor. It is simply in realizing that “I” am “Íiva,” and that everything in creation issimply caused by my own agency, by way of limiting myself, that one realizes thepoint to life is already at hand. This, then, is another way of approaching creationwithin Abhinava’s teachings. Creation is a form of self-limitation. The problemis that at some point, the power of Måyå (which ultimately is my own power)clouds my own powers, including knowledge and action, and the result is thelimited self, the individual, the human being.So it is necessary to note that in Abhinava’s thought, there are really twofoundational points that must be acknowledged.

This aspect may be alluded to as a “freedom-from”. This relates to thefact that svåtantrya refers ultimately to the fact that Íiva is not limited by anyother thing. There are no obstacles to impede the svåtantrya of the Lord; He isnot dependent on any other thing. Before getting into that, however, it needs to bepointed out that in discussing this aspect of svåtantrya, the language can beinterpreted in a misleading fashion.Abhinava realized the great difficulty in treating this aspect of his system,as demonstrated in the following passage:The word pratyabhijñå means, “to recognize, to realize your Selfspontaneously once again.” Here you have only to realize, you do nothave to practice. There are no upåyas (means) in the Pratyabhijñåsystem. You must simply recognize who you are.59This quote refers back to one of the points made at the end of the last chapter. Ithighlights the aspect of Abhinava’s teaching that the individual is already Íiva,with nothing needed to be done or gained to accomplish the highest goal.60 So inthe ultimate sense, there is no need for transformation, or any change at all.Instead, the individual is Íiva, and it only takes recognition of that truth to be ableto utilize one’s own unlimited powers.   59 Swami Lakshman Jee, Kashmir Shaivism: The Secret Supreme (Albany: The UniversalShaiva Trust-SUNY Press, 1988), 132.60 For a non-compromising modern account of this idea, see U.G. Krishnamurti."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"29This is fine and good, but it is obvious that most people do not recognizetheir true nature as Íiva. Because of this, Kaßmir Íaivite texts use language thatindicate a goal, or the need to overcome obstacles, such as in the followingpassage from Abhinavagupta:The person attaining that consciousness, because he is free from thebonds which cause rebirth becomes liberated even while in the body.However, when the body goes, there is only Íiva. Then who can be saidto be liberated? But since what existed earlier, that person, becomesfreed, becomes Íiva, [compared to the state he was in before], thescriptures like to use this type of language.61It is important to point this issue out because when dealing with the individual-as-Íiva, this kind of language is inevitable. One should not, however, erroneouslytreat all of this language on a purely surface level. In regards to the concept ofsvåtantrya, it is important to keep this in mind, because there will be discussion ofÍiva having freedom from all obstacles. In regards to the limited being realizingthat she is Íiva, language is used that refers to an overcoming of obstacles andlimitations.In this way, Abhinava’s conception of Íiva mirrors that of other Indiantraditions, where the absolute62 is characterized by a freedom from obstacles andlimitations. For instance, in Såμkhya, the PuruΩa is in its ultimate sense notrestricted by Prak®ti once the individual attains kaivalya. According to GeraldLarson, attaining kaivalya is an intuitive process of discrimination that leads to asort of “negative” knowledge, “the content of which is the realization that puruΩais separate from prak®ti. This realization is the basis of the Såμkhya doctrine of   61 IPVV, 310.62 For our purposes, whatever is the ultimate principle, whether it is personal or non-personal, is the absolute."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"30freedom, and this realization leads ultimately to a condition of ‘isolation’(kaivalya).”63 For many Vedåntins, Brahman is not limited by any qualities orattributes whatsoever. As Natalia Isayeva articulates, the negation leaves only apure consciousness that has nothing to do with creation:In Ía∫kara’s Advaita the higher Brahman is regarded as essentiallyineffable (anirvacan¥ya), devoid of qualities or attributes (nirguˆa), assomething that stays beyond any possibility of evolution (apariˆåma)and is nothing but pure consciousness itself (caitanya, vidyå).64To show how this relates to Abhinavagupta’s conception of Íiva, first itmust be affirmed that an understanding of Íiva must include freedom, orsvåtantrya. Abhinava unequivocally points out that freedom is, indeed, at thevery heart of understanding the central concept of Kaßmir Íaivism:This very Freedom (svåtantrya) is the essential nature ofconsciousness.65It is that very consciousness that is Íiva, and so svåtantrya is understood to be thevery essence of the highest lord:That lord’s highest essential nature is svåtantrya, with the form ofunbounded prakåßa and bliss.66   63 Gerald Larson, Classical Såμkhya: An Interpretation of its History and Meaning(Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1969), 235.64 Natalia Isayeva, From Early Vedanta to Kashmir Shaivism: Gaudapada, Bhartrhari,and Abhinavagupta (Albany: SUNY Press, 1995), 134.65 Áßvara-Pratyabhijñå-Vimarßin¥ of Abhinavagupta: Doctrine of Divine Recognition,vols.

It has complete independence. Remaining consistentwith Indian tradition, Íiva is that being (assuming such a word is appropriate)who is not dependent on any other being, but is that which other beings aredependent on, for He creates them:this freedom (svåtantrya) is fully not dependent on another, [and is] agreat lordship [power, that] created the lordship of brahma, viΩˆu, rudra,etc. This is indeed ‘the body of consciousness.’68This freedom, which is “the body of consciousness” that is Íiva, is completelyautonomous, and furthermore, is the source of all other power. This citation isinteresting for it contextualizes the deities of brahma and viΩˆu, and indeed, theconnotation includes all other deities. All deities have Íiva as their source, asÍiva, because of His freedom, is independent of everything. This, of course, isnecessary and obvious, for Íiva is ultimately everything.This leads to another point of ambiguity with Abhinava. On one hand,everything has the nature of consciousness. But on the other hand, he dividescreation up into two different categories. First, there are those creatures with   67 IPV, vol.1, 53.68 IPV, vol.1, 144."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"32sentiency (aja∂a). These are distinguished from those things that are categorizedas insentients (ja∂a). Alper explains further:Since Abhinava pictures the ultimate (Íiva-who-is-consciousness) as thatcomprehensive reality which takes form as both the subject and theobject, he is impelled to hold that everything which appears is, in somesense, conscious, even though he does not want to obviate the distinctionwhich holds true on a penultimate plane between the sentient (aja∂a) andthe insentient (ja∂a). For example, this is discussed in JÍÅA 11 whereAbhinava observes that “because an object such as a crystal is unable tocognize (paråmraΩ†um) either itself (åtmanam) or an object such as a potit is insentient (ja∂a ̇)” (198: 3ff.), but then goes on to conclude that“ultimately everything in the world is clearly sentient (aja∂am eva)”(199: 1-3).69Even though I think that this is one case of a “paradoxical-tension” that shows upin Abhinava’s writings, one way of looking at it is that ultimately, from thehighest points-of-view, everything is sentient. But for those stuck within thegrasp of Måyå, there is a definite difference between the sentients and insentients.In fact, svåtantrya, or the lack thereof, is one way of categorizing the insentients:The power which is the nature of action, has as its very life svåtantrya.In this way, on this level it is impossible for the insentient to have [thatfreedom (svåtantrya)].70So for the purposes of exploring the “freedom-from” aspect of svåtantrya, there isa dichotomy between those who are sentient, and those who are not; as well as,those who have freedom, and those who do not. Ultimately, though, all creativepower goes back to Íiva, as does svåtantrya. Because of this, Íiva, by virtue ofhaving for His nature svåtantrya, is beyond all obstacles and limitations:This very consciousness, in this way, is admitted as freedom (svåtantrya)because it is defined as unrestrained and because of the force of its   69 Alper, 393.70 IPV, vol.1, 60."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"33particular will. Of that consciousness it is believed to be boundlessbecause it is without obstacles remaining within, existing “as this,”which is the multitude of beings.71One explanation, then, for Íiva being free is that He is beyond theobscuring powers of Måyå. The limited individual, however, is not. Therefore,he or she is indicated by the word “paßu,” which literally means cattle, or beast,but in this context connotes that the limited being is a slave to his or her ownignorance and limitations. Abhinava writes:And he [the Subject] has as his pure nature, Íiva-self. But, [when] on thelevel of Måyå, it is a paßu [limited being], one whose natural state iscontracted.72The preceding quote points out that the root of being bound, or a limitedbeing, is that the consciousness is contracted, or limits itself. In its pure andnatural state, the Subject is free. However, when the Subject loses its ownfreedom, and when consciousness loses its predominance, then the Subjectbecomes a paßu. This is the root of the misunderstanding that human beings have,as to why they do not ascertain their true nature. According to Abhinava:This said, it is the case that in dualistic conceptualization the Self shinesas “this”, not I, whereas when the root awareness is only in “I-ness” thenthe Self rests in the unity of subject on the highest level.73When the Self shines as “this” it brings itself down to the level of object.Here, the idea of the object rings true, that it is a separate entity unto itself. Withthat separation comes limitation, for a pot is a pot as opposed to everything else in   71 IPV, vol.1, 228.72 IPV, vol.2, 42.73 IPVV, 295."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"34the universe. More appropriately for most human beings, the conception is, “I amthis combination of body and mind.” This, however, is a limitation:Because of this consciousness becomes contracted and is made into anobject through the state of being absorbed in the object as body etc. andfallen to the level of being a “this”. Then one says, “the one who ispale”, “the one who is happy”, “the one who is thirsty”, “the one who isdevoid of all forms”—“I am that one in fact”.74So when one says, “I am thirsty,” it is a product of a contracted consciousness.The Subject is identifying with the body/mind that is hungry. But according toAbhinavagupta, ultimately, this is similar to saying, “I am this pot,” because bothare an inaccurate apprehension of one’s own true nature. Even though they aredifferent types of misidentifications, they both are still limitations.The irony of this last statement is that it could be true, or not true,depending upon the level of realization for the individual, or to the degree that heor she is conscious. In other words, from the highest perspectives, one mightascertain the åbhåsa known by humans as a pot. To Íiva, though, that åbhåsa is areflection of His own divine nature, and so not different from Him. It is only amanifestation of the dynamic quality of Íiva. However, for the limited humanbeing, that åbhåsa that he understands to be a pot is something that is separate andother. According to Abhinava, this is due to the deluding powers of Måyå:The Subject is called a master when he understands [other objects andentities] to be [merely] the forms of his own limbs. But when he [sees]the divisions coming from Måyå [as real] he becomes bound, a beast ofburden....75   74 IPVV, 327.75 IPVV, 311."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"35This issue actually harkens back to the issue of åbhåsas that was coveredbefore, where normally, the individual’s conception of an åbhåsa is erroneous. Itis not an independent entity unto itself, but it is only because of the limited scopeof consciousness that an individual sees it as such. However, an åbhåsa isindependent insofar as it is understood to be a part of Íiva. The same principle isin effect with viewing all the world to be just the “limbs” of oneself. Otherwise,the limited being picks out something to make up his own limited self, and seesthe rest as separate from his own self.This misapprehension does not occur in the pure creation. The beings ofthe pure creation have a greater svåtantrya, therefore, because they are not boundby those limitations. As was illustrated earlier, at the beginning of the process ofcreation, there is no dualism to be found, as in the impure creation. Instead, theworld is in its incipient stage at the level of Sadåßiva. It first becomes distinct atthe level of Áßvara, and at the level of Íuddhavidya, the world may be manifest,but the realization that it is still “I,” as in “I am This,” remains.At the root of understanding the reason for the individual not knowing hisor her own true nature, and therefore being categorized as having a deficiency insvåtantrya, is what are known as malas, or impurities. They have their source inMåyå Íakti. According to Abhinava:with Måyå Íakti, then, there are three kinds [of mala].76   76 IPV, vol.2, 248."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"36They are not a physical substance, however, but affect the individualconsciousness of the paßu into thinking that he or she is limited. “The åˆava,måyiya and karma maculations completely lose their original nature of‘substances’ that physically obstruct the self of the paßu from without and resolvethemselves into erroneous attitudes of the individual consciousness.”77For Abhinava, the malas have a complex relationship with one another.So even though Måyå is seen as the source for all three, on a certain level, onemala takes precedence over the other two:in the sequence of creation, the impurity of Måyå is the root source [ofimpurity]. On the other hand, from the reference point of the knowledgeof the nature of pure awareness, Smallness impurity is [the source ofimpurity].78Even though from different perspectives, a different mala may have precedence,we will start with åˆava mala because logically speaking, it is the foundationalone. It means “small,” or “smallness,” for that is the effect caused by åˆavamala. It causes the Subject to see itself as limited (not infinite, boundless, andperfectly free). There are two ways that this happens, and therefore, according toAbhinava, there are two kinds of åˆava mala:The impurity called åˆava is of two types. One is due to the loss ofone’s true nature via the destruction of one’s freedom, even whileawareness remains. The other occurs through the loss of awareness,even though freedom remains.79   77 Raffaele Torella, The Áßvarapratyabhijñåkårikå of Utpaladeva with the Author’s V®tti,critical edition (Roma: Istituto Italiano per il Medio ed Estremo Oriente, 1994), XXXI-II.This is a translation of Utpaladeva’s text, that text which Abhinava wrote his commentaryon.78 IPVV, 318.79 IPVV, 313."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"37This appears misleading on a certain level, though, for how can one losesvåtantrya while maintaining bodha (awareness), as well as vice versa? Howcould one be perfectly free without awareness, and vice versa? The reason this isis because with åˆava mala, even when one has great svåtantrya, withoutawareness it is not a full svåtantrya. The same applies for awareness whensvåtantrya is gone. This seems to be Biernacki’s estimation as well in her glossof the IPPV:The words, “by its universality” mean that even the collection ofqualities, attributes such as freedom etc. don’t manifest in theirfullness [in the case where another quality, such as awareness, islacking. (?)].80The extrapolation from this is that when any attribute is missing, none of the otherqualities can be full and perfected. The Subject is ultimately either perfect in allrespects, or is incomplete in every respect, even if certain ones are predominant.In other words, only Íiva truly has full svåtantrya or bodha. The limited subject,although really having Íiva-nature, is deluded into thinking otherwise.This should not be much of a surprise, or considered a stretch in theunderstanding of åˆava mala, for that is what the mala is by definition. It issmallness. That smallness applies to whatever attribute the Subject does have aswell. For ultimately, svåtantrya and bodha are the same for Abhinava:Freedom is awareness. This is the reality. There, the impurity occurs bydestroying [freedom] through making separate portions, because this is infact removing its essential nature.

The Subject who does not haveawareness can have freedom, but only a limited freedom, for to have one withoutthe other is not possible.After the Subject perceives itself to be limited, and not infinite andboundless, the next mala that deludes it is Måyå mala:When both types of Smallness (åˆava) impurity exist there, they set inmotion the contraction of one’s real form. Then the division, the dualitywhich spreads out is called Måyå.82Måyå mala causes the Subject to see duality in the world because it seesthe objects of the world as separate from itself. Måyå mala, then, is the directcause for the duality that we see in the world.Karma mala, then, is that impurity that directly ties one to the world ofbirth and rebirth. For Abhinava, it also is the cause of the limited experiences inthat cycle of birth and rebirth:Nevertheless, the impurity called karma is the cause of happiness andunhappiness, of the various experiences, of the length of life, of one’sparticular fate and type of birth.83The malas, then, are at the heart of what needs to be overcome by theSubject in order to enter the realm of the pure creation. Therefore, part of thedefining feature of svåtantrya is that it is beyond the limitations instantiated as themalas. In order for the Subject to become completely free, and to overcome allobstacles, according to Abhinava it must overcome all three of the malas:   82 IPVV, 317.83 IPVV, 317."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"39The Gods, etc. have the nature of freedom which is the Principle ofconsciousness in the form of awareness which has pushed aside impurityby allowing the portion of doership to come to the fore.84With this then, we learn that the svåtantrya of Íiva entails that it is notlimited by anything.   84 IPVV, 326."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"40Chapter 3:Svåtantrya as “Freedom-to”The previous section focused on the fact that Íiva is beyond all obstaclesand limitations due to His svåtantrya. Íiva is not bound by anything, and He hasabsolute independence and self-autonomy. On the highest level, this is ratherquite obvious, for Íiva is the only reality, so how could there be anything to limitHim? However, this “freedom-from” is not the only characteristic of thatsvåtantrya. In fact, unlike other traditions, like Vedånta and Såμkhya, thesvåtantrya of Abhinava’s thought does not even see “freedom-from” as thecharacteristic most worthy of emphasis. This is of the utmost importance, for thisis at the heart of the greatest difference between Kaßmir Íaivism and thetraditions of Vedånta and Såμkhya. Without understanding this difference, whichcan be articulated as the addition of “freedom-to,” meaning the freedom toaccomplish or do activity, to the “freedom-from,” one cannot come to even abasic understanding of Íiva according to Abhinavagupta. It is “freedom-to” thatallows Íiva to have action. In fact, according to Kamalakar Mishra, “Unless thereis also ‘freedom-to,’ the freedom of the Absolute cannot be complete. ‘Freedom’implies the ability to act. If Íiva is not free to act, He is then really limited; Íivabecomes just like the bound individual.”85 Mishra points out a very profoundidea.

Be that as it may, “freedom-to” for Abhinavagupta starts with thatall-important differentiation between his thought and that of other traditions:agency. Recall that in other traditions, action is seen as something which theabsolute has freedom from. In other word, action is seen by traditions likeSåμkhya and Vedånta as a limitation that must be overcome. For instance, withinthe Såμkhya tradition, there is the famous image of a lame man carrying a blindman on his shoulders. The blind man represents Prak®ti, and the lame manrepresents PuruΩa. The blind man lacking sight represents the fact that Prak®tilacks consciousness. Meanwhile, the lame man indicates the fact that PuruΩa iswithout the ability to act. As we learned from the last chapter, the goal ofSåμkhya is to isolate PuruΩa from Prak®ti, and therefore, kaivalya entails a stateof “freedom-from” action.For Abhinava, however, svåtantrya is inextricably related to action. Infact, a lack of action would be tantamount to having a lack of freedom. Action, oragency, is crucial for the proper understanding of Abhinava’s idea of svåtantrya.Recall in the last chapter the discussion on sentient and non-sentientbeings. It was declared by Abhinava that:The power which is the nature of action, has as its very life svåtantrya.In this way, on this level it is impossible for the insentient to have [thatfreedom (svåtantrya)].86   86 IPV, vol.1, 60."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"42Last time this quote was cited, it was to point out the fact that the insentientobjects lack the svåtantrya that sentient beings have. Within this context, asyllogism can be set up to further explain both the sentients, as well as svåtantrya.The insentients do not have svåtantrya. Svåtantrya is the life (pråˆå) of action.Therefore, insentients are also understood as being without action, or agency. Onthe other hand, sentients have at least a certain level of svåtantrya, because theyalso have a certain level of agency. Abhinava is claiming that without thepropensity for action, one actually has an absence of svåtantrya. Action, then, isone of the telltale signs of the existence of svåtantrya.Ahambhåva87 is indeed said to be the vißrånti 88 of the self of prakåßa.And indeed, this vißrånti is said to be the confinement in regard toeverything. Now, the chief attribute of svåtantrya is doership, andmoreover, it is the state of lordship.89This profound statement reveals a number of things. First, the pure “I-feeling”(abhambhåva) is the repose of the self in the ultimate sense, because that self is ofthe nature of prakåßa, which is the shining, illuminative light that isconsciousness. That vißrånti (the rest, or abiding) of the self, then, indicates theblocking of the manifestation of everything. In Jaideva Singh’s commentary onthis quotation, which is used in the Paråtr¥ßikå-Vivarana, the ahambhåva has todo with the withdrawal of the manifold creation, and the eventual coming to restin the unmanifest Íiva.90 The most important thing to point out of the secondsentence of the passage, though, is that the self is at a state of rest, what many   87 Ahambhåva, according to Biernacki, is the Pure “I”. According to Jaideva Singh’scommentary on the Paråtr¥ßikå-Vivarana, the ahambhåva is the “real I-feeling.”88 rest, repose, abiding.89 IPV, vol.1, 35.90 Singh, 55."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"43would see as a state of inactivity. The final sentence highlights the fact that actionis seen as a defining feature of svåtantrya. When someone exercises the powersof agency, svåtantrya is being demonstrated. Furthermore, this attribute ofsvåtantrya, doership, is what defines one’s claim to having lordship. It is,therefore, up to each individual being and his own svåtantrya that allows for himto act, to actually make himself into a lord (one who has lordship):But they [all those with lordship] become lords by the sparks of thelordship, belonging to them [selves].91The final thing to be said about the quote regarding svåtantrya and vißråntiis to point out the seeming juxtaposition that occurs. First, Abhinava is writingabout rest, the seeming lack of action. One might conclude from that, that whenthe self is characterized by vißrånti, it loses its svåtantrya. This is not the case,however. Perhaps in anticipation of this, in the Bhåskar¥ (the commentary onAbhinava’s commentary on the kårikås of Utpaladeva), the following question isasked and answered:What is vißrånti? “Svåtantrya.”92How can vißrånti be considered svåtantrya? What the Bhåskar¥ is pointing out isthat rest is actually at heart simply a form of activity. That is why it is fitting thatvißrånti can be translated with the more traditionally active word “abiding”. Theextension of this, then, is that in Abhinava’s thought, there is a constant sense ofactivity if even rest is considered a result of agency.

Såμkhya may not deny the reality of it likeVedånta, but similarly, it does see action as something to be overcome to reachthe state of kaivalya. For Abhinava, it is not just a matter of making a valuestatement about action (which he does, that it is important), but he points out theinaccuracy of claiming it is possible to be without action while maintaining anylevel of svåtantrya.In fact, there is a branch of Kaßmir Íaivism that puts an emphasis on theconstant movement of Íiva.93 While Abhinava is not known to have commentedon the texts of the Spanda school of Kaßmir Íaivism, “the term spanda occursfrequently in his writings.”94 Spanda is at the heart of explaining why Abhinava’sidea of reality is different than Vedånta’s, for it also is an explanation for howeven vißrånti can be categorized as action.Spanda is the primordial vibration that is internal to consciousness.According to Muller-Ortega:The Heart of Íiva is not a static or inert absolute, however. In fact, thenon-dual Kashmir Shaiva tradition considers it to be in a state ofperpetual movement, a state of vibration (spanda) in which it iscontinuously contracting and expanding (samkoca-vikåsa), opening andclosing (unmeΩa-nimeΩa), trembling (ullasitå), quivering (sphuritå),throbbing, waving, and sparkling (ucchalatå). The intensity and speed ofthis movement is such that paradoxically it is simultaneously a perfectdynamic stillness.95   93 Often called the Spanda branch, school, or tradition. This would include the two earlyfigures, Vasugupta and Kalla†a.94 Muller-Ortega, 118.95 Muller-Ortega, 83."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"45From this we learn that motion has its basis in spanda, which is the originalmovement that has no beginning or end. Connecting motion to spanda is one wayof showing that motion is grounded in Íiva, for it is spanda that explains howmotion is an inherent part of His nature. Through spanda, then, motion is shownas connected to svåtantrya, for it is spanda that explains how Íiva has svåtantrya,and it is by this primordial motion that His svåtantrya is expressed. ForAbhinava, one implies the other. It is then in the externalization andgrossification of the central spanda that all other motions materialize. Muller-Ortega point out that the constant internal dynamism is the source of all othermotion, or movement. “This internal dynamism serves as the source for theexternal movement that results in the process of manifestation.”96 Action, then, isdefined by this movement, for it is action that is the cause of manifestation, orcreation; and therefore, action is the external movement that has as its basis theinternalized movement of spanda, which is inseperable from svåtantrya. It is inthe flow from the internal movement to the external action that one sees theconnection between, spanda, action, and svåtantrya.This spanda is at the heart of reality, and it explains why Íiva is not likethe static Brahman of Vedånta, but is instead fluid and dynamic. Change andmultiplicity are simply the result of the overflowing of and in the Self.97Furthermore, Muller-Ortega connects this spanda to svåtantrya: “This vibration isthe power found in the Heart, which consists essentially of an undivided self-   96 Muller-Ortega, 120.97 Muller-Ortega, 119."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"46referential consciousness (avibhåga-paråmarßar ̈pa), which is complete freedom(svåtantrya).”98Recall that earlier a distinction was made in regard to the two aspects ofÍiva. One was prakåßa, the aspect of light, or shining. The other was vimarßa(active awareness), which is the active and reflective quality of that light that isÍiva. Recall also, that the claim was made that both prakåßa and vimarßa wererelated to knowledge and action, respectively:This is because of the mutual inseparability of jñåna, Knowledge andkriyå, Activity which have the respective natures of expansive Light andActive Awareness. And “that” alone is the highest ultimate nature of allentities. Because of this the Lord does have the freedom to manifest thisexpansion [which is the universe] and to perform all the five acts [ofcreation, maintenance, etc.] by means of accepting the power of kriyå,action.99We have just shown how Abhinava relates svåtantrya as the essence ofaction. Therefore, it is a reasonable conclusion that svåtantrya, to the extent thatthe two aspects are distinguished from one another, is related to the vimarßaaspect of Íiva. When one compares Abhinava’s system to that of Vedånta, it isthe idea of vimarßa that distinguishes one from the other. It is vimarßa that givesÍiva the freedom appearing as action. Indeed, Pandey even sometimes translatesvimarßa as “freedom.”100 Abhinava explicitly verifies this connection betweenvimarßa, svåtantrya, and action:Knowledge is the form of prakåßa there, and thus, action is the form ofvimarßa, which has the essence of svåtantrya.101   98 Muller-Ortega, 91.99 IPVV, 257.100 For instance, see IPV, vol.3, 118; cf.

The first part of answering this is to pointout again that ultimately, prakåßa and vimarßa are not two different entities, orparts of Íiva. They are one in the highest sense. Logically speaking, then, if theroot of two powers is ultimately one, would that not mean that the two powers, inthis case knowledge and action, are ultimately the same? This is affirmed by oneof Utpaladeva’s kårikås that Abhinava comments on:In this way, kriyå, Activity, functions both internally and externallyfollowing a temporal sequence. It belongs to the Subject alone.Knowledge and actions are inseparably mutually associated with that[Subject].102We learn from this passage that knowledge and action are only related tothe Subject, which makes perfect sense. After all, one does not attribute thepowers of knowing or doing to objects. Most importantly for us, however, is theaffirmation that knowledge and action are connected.So in the ultimate sense, in regards to consciousness, which is the ultimateprinciple that makes up all of reality, knowledge and action are encompassed bythat one true reality:Here, this is the true form of the state of consciousness to the extent thatit is the form of the doer and the knower.103So it is that Íiva has the two powers unseparated:It is correct that God who is really the Supreme [transcendent] Íiva, eventhough existing [at this highest level] without sequence [still] has theEnergies of Knowledge and Activity joined.104   102 IPVV, 257.103 IPV, vol.2, 248.104 IPVV, 262."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"48So not only is svåtantrya connected to action, but also to knowledge.Abhinava explicitly affirms this:Thus knowing of this, the Self is the form of the Lord and when notexcluded from the Self, there is the form of only freedom (svåtantrya),which is both knowledge and action. Being in this way, that is theSelf.105This passage shows that the Self, or the subject, has the form of the Lord, whichalready indicates that it has agency. But here svåtantrya is described as beingconnected to knowledge and action. Specifically, it is the Self that has svåtantrya,and it is because of that very fact that the Self has not just agency, but alsoknowledge. In fact this passage actually sets up the equation of the two powersbeing of the form of svåtantrya. It is because the Self has svåtantrya that it canhave knowledge and action.Once the limited individual realizes this connection, or establishes him orherself in svåtantrya, that individual is then able to realize that he or she is Íiva:He who is indeed established in freedom (svåtantrya) of both knowledgeand action, he is the Lord who is talked about in the puråˆas, siddhånta,etc. And you are thus [that].106From this we learn that in order to be the Lord, one must not have anylimitations upon his powers of knowledge and action. By being established insvåtantrya, the Lord must essentially be omniscient, and not just omnipotent.One cannot be Lord just by having action. There must be both.

The reader is in reality the same Íiva that is glorified and madefamous in the scriptures (“puråˆas, siddhånta, etc”).Abhinava again tries to bring the point out that the reader really does havesvåtantrya, and that it is demonstrated within the realm of both action andknowledge: One’s very own lordship is made visible as characterized by svåtantryaof action, “he does,” and knowledge, “he knows.”107When someone does something, that is evidence of svåtantrya. When someoneknows something, there again is evidence of svåtantrya.Because of this, svåtantrya is not simply limited to the ultimate, or just tothe highest Íiva. Wherever there is action or knowledge, svåtantrya is also there.In reality everywhere doership belongs to Íiva alone. Even so becauseof the will of the Lord from the notion of personal ego it is said of othersthat they have doership.108Even though in this passage it only says that, “doership belongs to Íiva alone,” wenow know that knowership is inseparable from doership. Therefore, it can be saidthat the others, meaning limited beings (any beings other than Íiva), have bothknowership and doership. On the mundane level that many people accept asreality, there is still svåtantrya, for there is still action and knowledge, and theystill are not separate from each other. This even applies to the lowly insect: However, even [though it exists as a unity] a manifestation ofdistinctness is not extremely impossible. He shows this by the word“whole”.

Abhinava explicitly affirms both knowledge andaction for the human being, who is the same thing as the paßu, or bound soul:So it is correct to say that even for bound souls, knowledge and actionare mutually inseparably present.111Abhinava gives an example of this “mundane”, or incomplete (ap ̈rˆa)svåtantrya in the form of a response to the Buddhists who would deny suchfreedom of the individual:In this way, the state of being a cognizer is more than mere cognition[i.e. perception]. The causing of the joining or detaching with /ofcognitions according to taste is svåtantrya, and that is what is calledbeing a doer.112This passage proclaims that human beings have svåtantrya, even if it is limited;and it is demonstrated by the fact that humans have some control over what theythink. Humans can select what to think, or decide to observe one thing overanother. To that extent, a human does and knows.With that said, however, it is important to reiterate that ultimately, it isonly Íiva that acts or knows:   109 IPVV, 260.110 Biernacki points out that this knowledge is not a “thinking,” so much as it is a“visceral awarness” (Biernacki, 11).111 IPVV, 260.112 IPV, vol.1, 164-165."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"51Maheßvara [the Great Lord—Íiva] is the doer and the knower in thisdesignation also.113For even though the limited jiva (limited soul, which is to say the paßu) does havethe capacity for limited knowledge and action, ultimately, only Íiva has actionand knowledge. For Maheßvara is indeed the same as the paßu. However,Maheßvara is the Self in its fullness, where it does not see duality. Rather, it seesall the world as an extension of itself. However, that same being in its state ofpaßu sees duality all around. It sees the things of the world as manifest separatelyfrom itself due to the obscuring power of Måyå.To merely equate action and knowledge, however, as nothing but the samething, in a one to one relationship, i.e., A=A, is an oversimplication of the powerof Íiva, and of ourselves. For Abhinava does, indeed, give a certain level ofpriority in the consideration of knowledge, as opposed to action. Abhinava quoteshis own Tantråloka to point this out in the IPVV:So, even that which is called Action is really only just knowledge.114Here he seems to conflate action into the category of knowledge.Elsewhere, Abhinava is actually more descriptive and metaphorical in hisconnecting action to knowledge:Indeed, action will be described as being essentially a sprout115 ofknowledge.116   113 IPV, vol.1, 54.114 IPVV, 259, quoted from Tantråloka, 1/155.115 pallava: sprout, or blossom, which has the connotation of spreading, or expansion.116 IPV, vol.1, 53-54."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"52To a certain degree, here, I think a parallel can be made comparing thenon-dual relationship between knowledge and action, and the relationshipbetween prakåßa and vimarßa.

For instance,the following statement:And vimarßa is prakåßa made internal.117Hypothetically speaking, it is possible to have just prakåßa without vimarßa. Thisis what would be favored by the Vedåntist, where there would just be a pureshining. But Abhinava revolts against this idea of a pure shining consciousness:If [it, one’s own nature] is with the form of a mere perfectedconsciousness, then the separating of cognitions and the non-duality ofdistinctions by internal arranging may not be possible.118In other words, if consciousness is a strict monistic purity, then how does oneexplain the world, the inner workings of the mind, or the multiplicity that is allaround? This is the dilemma that Vedånta finds itself in.

This gets at the heart of the matter of how “vimarßa is prakåßa madeinternal.” It gives consciousness the quality of self-awareness and allows it tomaintain the unity even in diversity. Paul Muller-Ortega points out that this isessential to understanding what consciousness is:Abhinavagupta begins by underscoring the inherent capacity for self-referral (vimarßa) that is, according to tradition, the essentialcharacteristic of consciousness. This doubling back of consciousness onitself does not represent a separate moment in consciousness, but israther a continuous and inescapable component of consciousness,intrinsic to the sheer appearance of consciousness (prakåßa).120The reason why all of this seems applicable to the discussion of the unityof knowledge and action, is because logically speaking, both relationships givepriority to one term over the other. For consciousness, prakåßa has the logicalpriority because, as was mentioned before, one can imagine a hypotheticalsituation where there is just the shining light (prakåßa). On the flip side, onecannot imagine a self-reflecting quality (vimarßa) on its own. Self-reflecting mustfirst have a self!

Áßvara isthe next tattva, where “Thisness” becomes distinct.It is important to point out that even though they are separate tattvas,helping to make the template of creation, Sadåßiva and Áßvara really are notseparate entities. Instead, they are descriptive of two ways of being for Íiva.Biernacki helps to make this point more clear after the following passage fromAbhinava:Sadåßiva and Áßvara are not different from the Archetype of Íiva; [theyrepresent two modes within it, the latter with distinctly formed objectsand the former without them].122Sadåßiva is that state where objects are in an incipient form, for there is only theinitial stirring of creation.

However, the object is stillcontained within the Subject, or the “I”. “When this universe, which is to becreated, has sprouted in fullness, and yet is still wrapped with the I-Consciousnessof Lord Íiva, this is the element ¥ßvara.”123 It is the state where the world isactually formed, if only within the Subject. These two tattvas, instead of beingseparate entities, are really two stages within the one process of creation anddissolution.Similar to this relation between Sadåßiva and Áßvara, knowledge andaction, instead of representing separate powers, take on the role of the samepower. However, the mode of the one and the other are different, which allowsfor some level of distinction, but not separation.Biernacki likes to think of action and knowledge as being on a continuumwhere there is a flow, one to the other, as well as vice versa. “Abhinavaguptameticulously strives to reconfigure the relationship between knowledge and actionnot as oppositional, but rather as the flow of a continuum, where action flows intoknowledge and knowledge flows into action.”124 Instead of separate things andentities, then, it is better to think of these as differing actions along the samefoundation. With that said, though, knowledge still has some level of priorityover action, and it is because knowledge is the source of that activity. Biernackishows how this works:Action, which at its core incorporates a notion of time, forAbhinavagupta, starts out as consciousness, i.e., knowledge which stirsin the heart. This knowledge is not necessarily the articulation of athought, what we [in the 20th century West] might call consciousness;   123 Hughes, 60.124 Biernacki, 6-7."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"56worms certainly do not think. [In the view of Kaßmir Íaivism] Rather itis a visceral awareness, which through its movement in stages becomesintent which then gets externalized as a deed.125It is that externalization that indicates action within this context. Notice that thisis just like the relationship of action to spanda, where action is seen as theexternalization of the internal movement of spanda.According to Abhinava, not only is externalization an indication of action,so is the idea of an increased determination:When the Energy manifest inwardly, naturally it is called the Energy ofKnowledge. However, when it expands in stages with its activeawareness gradually becoming more firm and fixed, then it manifestexternally. This is pointed as the Energy of Activity.126It is the motion, or flow of the Energy, which really is consciousness, thatdetermines knowledge and action. Because of this, one really can say, that actionis knowledge.Now that we have explored the nature of knowledge and activity, as wellas the relation of one to the other, I want to backtrack just a little. Earlier, therelation of prakåßa and vimarßa was compared to knowledge and action. Eventhough there is the parallel between the two, I do not see the relations as exactlythe same, and the following is the reason why.It is true that both prakåßa and knowledge serve as the base for theircounterpart, and to that extent Abhinava says that knowledge has the nature ofprakåßa. Action follows in the same way, in its relationship to vimarßa, for theyboth are the “adjectives” of their counterparts. However, the relation between   125 Biernacki, 11-12.126 IPVV, 262."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"57knowledge and action is a flow along a continuum. As we have already seen,knowledge, though, takes priority for it is that which action is an extension of.Action flows out of knowledge, and the reverse may be true, but knowledge is theoriginal impetus. It is the flow that allows for the continuity and non-dualitybetween action and knowledge.With prakåßa and vimarßa, however, there is not this same relationship offlow. Even though logically speaking prakåßa may have priority, in reality therenever was a prakåßa without vimarßa. Because of this, vimarßa does not “flow”out of or back into prakåßa. Vimarßa may be the explanation of why prakåßa isimbued with motion and externality, but it itself is not an “extension” of prakåßa.It is the reflective capacity of prakåßa. Because of this, one can agree, likeAbhinava, that vimarßa is the essence of prakåßa:and that prakåßa has as its essence vimarßa...127However, it is misleading, if not erroneous, to say that action is theessence of knowledge. For Abhinava makes it clear that there is a real priority ofknowledge over action, even if ultimately they are the same power. As far as I amaware of, the closest Abhinava comes to prioritizing prakåßa is by saying vimarßais its essence. This is not really prioritizing one over the other, though. It issimply pointing out the vitality and dynamism that is the shining illuminativelight, which is prakåßa.   127 IPV, vol.1, 273."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"58It is because of the svåtantrya of Íiva that Abhinava is able to distinguishbetween his philosophy and that of Vedånta, while at the same time, keeping thequality of “absoluteness,” or ultimacy that is necessary to maintain the non-dualism that is one of the hallmarks of these systems. Without svåtantrya,Abhinava’s Íiva, like the Vedåntic Brahman, would fall into the torpor of a staticreality. While there may be an aesthetic appeal to the unchanging Brahman, tomany such as Abhinava, this reality is akin to death. This is why Muller-Ortegawrites that, “To wish to define the Ultimate reality as a silence that transcends allcharacterizations would be to distort and demote the absolute into a powerless anduseless ultimate.”128 Due to svåtantrya, Abhinava’s idea of Íiva necessitates adynamic reality characterized by change, fluidity, and motion. It is because ofsvåtantrya that things are possible:the one who is free is the one who can exist in whatever way he or shedesires, unimpeded, unrestricted. And God does indeed have thisfreedom, he has the fullness of everything as his own.129Íiva, of course, is the one who is free, and because of this, there are no limitationsupon what can be done. This brings out the idea that really, the aspect ofsvåtantrya discussed in the second chapter, is really just a complementaryapproach to that result which we find in this current chapter. In other words,svåtantrya as “freedom-from” ultimately leads to the same conclusion about thenature of svåtantrya, as “freedom-to” does. They may emphasize differentaspects, but is not infinite freedom the same as absolutely unlimited freedom?   128 Muller-Ortega, 120.129 IPVV, 320."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"59This verse seems to ratify this conclusion, for Íiva can “exist in whatever way,”for there are no restrictions upon what Íiva can exist as. Íiva contains withinHimself every possibility, for, “he has the fullness of everything as his own.”This encompasses those possibilities that seem illogical, or go against theunderstood laws of nature. According to Biernacki in her gloss of the followingquote from Abhinavagupta, what happens does so because of the will of Íiva, andnot because it satisfies one’s desire for logical consistency within the natural lawsof nature:Having stated the topic in this way because of its applicability, [we seethat] at the time of perceiving one's own self, happiness and pain, etc., asobjects to be known, exist without reference to the expansion andoutflow of the external world. [I.e., happiness etc., exist primarily in themind and not outside us]. He relates this idea on this occasion, saying,\"and of minds also”. In this way [what is created with] the outflow ofpråˆa which is by its inherent nature the gross expansion and outflow ofthe world and which is preceded by perception, this really does not existeven when there is an [external] object there. This is stated. However,that which is made by the will of the Lord, since it does not begin with[mere] intellect, is like the blowing of a bellows. That exists even whenthere is no object there. [I believe that what Abhinava is saying here isthat our interpretations of “things” in the world when they arise merelyfrom mental cogitation have no actual real validity; they are not “truestatements” in any practical or effective sense of the word. In contrast,what God wills, since it comes from a much deeper level than mere mindor intellect, has the force of reality even when it seems contrary to thephysical laws of the universe.]130This really should come to no surprise, for the physical laws of the universewould be dependent upon Íiva’s will, upon Him having svåtantrya. They areÍiva’s laws, and since He has no limitation, and is perfectly free to do and bewhatever, Íiva would only be restrained by such laws if that were His choice.Otherwise, they are not an obstacle to the svåtantrya of the Lord.   130 IPVV, 349."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"60Because of this, it is Íiva’s svåtantrya that is at the root of all creation:These souls, [not having attained the highest] are created as separate likea pot etc., [is created as something separate from the potter]. They arecreated by the Nourisher, the supreme Lord who by his own freedomunceasingly nourishes them, and who by this freedom desired to existseparately from the presence of His own Self. In that way they arecreated separately, like a pot, etc.131 Here, Abhinava is referring to the limited souls and their creation. Their creationis a direct effect of the svåtantrya of the Lord, and the reason for their creation isbecause of the desire of the Lord to be separate from Himself. The root of thisdesire and the ensuing separation is due to that same svåtantrya that creates. Soboth the impetus and the instrument for creation are rooted within the svåtantryaof Íiva.Concerning that individual [and separate] soul called “paßu” is surely notany other than the “I”. But also, that is the one dense mass of the oneprakåßa that includes [both] the object and the subject. That highest is infact I, and He is, in fact I. There is no other. From this, even themanifold [dual, multiple] creation is a characteristic of svåtantrya, “mygreatness/majesty”.132This verse further points out that Íiva runs the gamut, as He is the Subject [the“I”], and that includes the limited and bound soul, or the paßu. He runs the gamutin that not only is He the limited subject, but also is the object which is implied bythat limited subject. There is no difference between Íiva and the Subject, that “I”that is experienced by every being. For ultimately, there is only one. Thisprocess of limiting and expanding, of obscuring and revealing, is the process ofcreation. And that is only a part of the Lord’s svåtantrya. That process of   131 IPVV, 319.132 IPVV, vol.2, 348-349."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"61creation, then, is in fact that which is singled out as the “greatness/majesty” of theLord.This again, is a major difference between Abhinava’s system, and theVedånta. For creation is treated by the latter as ultimately not real. It is illusory,and is only an obstacle on the way to true enlightenment. That same attitude ofVedånta can be attributed to Såμkhya also, for although it does not deny thereality of creation, it does advise that it is something to be ignored. Abhinava,however, sees creation as one with Íiva, just as the power of Måyå is:The Archetype of Måyå, is not accepted merely as the material cause inthe body and as separate [from the Lord, as is the case in Såμkhya withPrak®ti], but rather is considered as the inseparable Energy (Íakti) of theSupreme Lord.133It is because of Måyå, the power of the Lord, that creation occurs, in the sense ofseparate appearances. Multiplicity happens. This is the way that Abhinavaexplains the works of the creation of duality, of how the many have their source inthe one:However, when by the power of Måyå, which is the form of freedom(svåtantrya) appearing as divided, then this [referring to the åbhåsas]manifest externally.134Not only is Måyå the source of all creation, which is the external manifestation, italso is svåtantrya in the form of division, of multiplicity. Måyå is a form ofsvåtantrya. So within the inner workings of creation, it is freedom known asMåyå that is responsible for multiplicity.   133 IPVV, 270.134 IPV, vol.1, 416."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"62But it does not stop there, because for Abhinava, it is not just the creationof the “This” that creates a duality. It is not simply in having appearances thatthere is duality. Duality is also dependent on how those appearances, or åbhåsas,are apprehended. As was pointed out earlier in this thesis, it is in theapprehending of the object, that which is not “I,” that limitation and duality occur.According to Abhinava’s quoting of Utpaladeva:However, one single essence pervades through this duality—that isseeing what is not-Self as the I—whether it be the Void or in the intellector in the body. This is the Energy of Måyå yawning open.135Thus, Måyå is the root of error, for it is the power of obscuring. However,it is a power due to the svåtantrya of the Lord. In fact, as the following quoteshows, the reason for the existence of Måyå is rooted in the fact that the Lord hasthe desire to conceal or hide itself from itself. And once again, Måyå is a form offreedom:But in the obscuration of that not-shining from non-difference is the formof the desire for the concealing of one’s own nature of the Highest Lord.[This] is the form of error, and the power of måyå is the cause, which isthe form of svåtantrya.136In the introduction, the question was asked about whether it was possiblefor God to create a rock so heavy that even He could not move it. It is because ofthis action of Måyå, which is rooted in svåtantrya, that Abhinava is able to answerin the affirmative. For in this system, the paßu is the metaphorical rock, and thecrux on which the answer to the question stands. In fact, for Abhinava, the moreprofound question would be about whether God can limit Himself to the point that   135 IPVV, 280.136 IPV, vol.1, 315-316."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"63He cannot lift an ordinary boulder. For this, too, Abhinava answers affirmatively.The connotations of this are manifold. Because all possibilities are containedwithin the svåtantrya of Íiva, God, the one and only Subject—even reality, canlimit and delude Himself, due to the power of Måyå:And it has been ascertained that he [the Subject] is free. And he has ashis pure nature, Íiva-self. But, [when] on the level of Måyå, it is paßu,one whose nature is contracted [or limited].137Where other theologians dare not go, Abhinava boldly claims that God can indeeddo anything, even those things that many would deem as illogical, unreasonable,or even blasphemous. But it is in this affirmation that Abhinava can maintain thenon-duality of reality, while not denying the life of “ordinary experience.” At thevery center of this system, that which makes all of it possible is svåtantrya, thefreedom of Íiva.   137 IPV, vol.2, 42."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"64ConclusionAll the major concepts that have been explored in this thesis can beunderstood as having svåtantrya as their hub, or central concept. This is not tosay that one cannot give a portrayal of the central concepts with something otherthan svåtantrya as the center. One certainly could do so with many otherconcepts. However, if Abhinava’s concept of svåtantrya were taken away, whatwould be left? The system would be completely changed, just like if the idea ofconsciousness (cit) were taken away. Svåtantrya, then, is one of the necessarycentral concepts, among many, that helps to demonstrate the “diversity ofconnotation and the actual co-referentiality of the various terms that designateultimacy.”138 One cannot understand svåtantrya without also having anunderstanding of such concepts as prakåßa, vimarßa, jñåna (knowledge), andkriyå (action). When this understanding is reached, however, a beautifullyvibrant, alive, and considerate system is revealed.Svåtantrya is the most relevant focus, however, for the purposes of thisthesis in its exploration of the central theological question that was proposed atthe beginning. It is because svåtantrya so directly and deeply addresses the issueof “impossibility,” which is so central to our theological dilemma that it isessential to come to a certain understanding of Abhinava’s idea of freedom.Indeed, it is in the process of creation that one can claim that Abhinava sees   138 Alper, 348."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"65svåtantrya as the justification, starting off point, and center for Íivaaccomplishing the seemingly impossible:Here, that ultimate freedom is of the highest Lord, in which we are,accomplishing the very difficult, which is impossible in the particularstate of being a paßu, which comes earlier. And here, what will be verydifficult? When one’s own prakåßa is shining as undivided identity, thatshining is appearing as the negation of the act of shining. Therefore, thatultimate freedom of the highest Lord, in that way, is not shining whenthat form, by the name of paßu, is manifest. [This] establishes theportion of the subject, and by means of that, the object also blossoms [or,comes into being]. That is called the power of Måyå of the Lord. Thus ithas been spoken: the deluder is, by name, Måyå. This, in this way,because of the freedom (svåtantrya), which is the power of Måyå, it [thepaßu] is that way.139Creation happens because Íiva can accomplish the impossible. In theprevious quote, Abhinava says that the exact nature of impossibility is making theshining appear as not shining. This means that Íiva can limit His ownconsciousness so that He appears as a limited and bound soul (paßu), even thoughultimately He is still Íiva. Human beings exist as they understand themselves tobe because Íiva can accomplish the impossible. This is so because, in actuality,there is nothing that is impossible for Íiva. There is only impossibility for lesserbeings, or more accurately, modes of being, such as human beings, the paßus. Onthe level of Íiva, however, what will be impossible? In short, the answer isnothing. For everything is only the free expression of Íiva, as symbolized byNataråja, one of the most popular images of Íiva, depicting Him doing Hiscosmic dance.How is this possible though? Is Abhinava not trying to stride both sides ofthe metaphysical fence? How can Abhinava maintain that both the ultimate, as   139 IPV, vol.2, 141-142."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"66well as the limited, ordinary world are true and valid? If one affirms the reality ofthe mundane world as real, as well as everything in it, does this not compromisethe infinitude of Íiva? How can He take on the flesh, blood, and mind of a humanbeing and still maintain the unblemished nature of that same God? How can thesame God accept the limitations of all of creation, and still proclaim the nature ofhaving perfect freedom? How can one completely affirm the mundane, andcompletely affirm the highest of idealist metaphysics, while at the same affirmingthe non-dual nature connecting the two. Is this idea of svåtantrya not just an adhoc effort on the part of Abhinava to have his cake and to eat it too?Certainly, Abhinava is not able to answer all critiques with a thoroughlylogical and convincing rebuttal, and neither is that his ultimate intent, since hisworks are first of all for the spiritual edification of his disciples. However, healso does not leave the inquiring mind with nothing. It is through hisrecontextualizing and recoding of everything within the scope of a single, realconsciousness, defined by its svåtantrya, that allows for him to address thesechallenges.For instead of focusing on a static and eternally pure consciousness,Abhinava proclaims that Íiva is a dynamic reality due to its svåtantrya.Furthermore, Abhinava affirms that knowledge and action are not really separatefrom each other, but are connected and ultimately one. You cannot have onewithout the other to have complete freedom. Once the individual realizes this,that those powers are infinite, and that those powers are one’s own, he or she isable to realize that Íiva is his or her own true Self. When this is realized, one"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"67knows that all possibilities are contained within and due to their own svåtantrya,the svåtantrya of the Lord. This includes the possibility of Íiva creating the rockthat even He cannot move.All of this can be understood as revolving around, and made possible, bythe concept of svåtantrya. Svåtantrya is what allows an unlimited God to becomelimited, which at the same time does not change the eternal nature of that God. Itis svåtantrya that allows the ideals of the highest to be brought together with themundane, every-day life without effacing the essential ideas of either one.Instead, in Abhinava’s understanding of reality all the possibilities are legitimateand real. The eternal bliss (ånanda) is affirmed, while the everyday ebb and tideof human emotions is still understood as valid. It is because of svåtantrya that wetoo, according to Abhinavagupta, can have our cake and eat it too."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"68BibliographyAbhinavagupta.
