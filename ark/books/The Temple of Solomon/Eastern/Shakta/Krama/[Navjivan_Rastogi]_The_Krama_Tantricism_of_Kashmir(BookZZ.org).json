SWAMI MUKTANANDA"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"PREFACE Perhaps the author owes an apology for publishing a work on the Krama system which has not been, unfortunately, noticed by any traditional author of the available compendia like the Sarva-darsana-samgraha etc. It is rather equally curious to see the modern studies on the Indian philosophy in general and Tantricisrn in particular turn totally apathetic to such a system of philosophy barring a few honourable exceptions. The latter include the second edition of Dr. K.C. Pandey's study on Abhinavagupta incorporating a chapter on the Krama system and discussing the same in broad outlines. In addition, one has one or two paragraphs from M.M. Dr. Gopinath Kaviraj on the same briefly dwelling upon some or its major aspects. (Vide his Preface to the Second edition, Tripura Rahasya, Jnana Khanda, p. iii., Tantrika Vanmaya me Sakta Drsti, Prastavana, p. 4.) It augurs well that the studies on the Kashmir Saivism as well as on Tantricisrn have come to gain - slightly greater mom-entum since Woodroffe first undertook to enter the forbidden land. Yet it is unfortunate that dearth of analytical thinking coupled with detailed exploratory investigations into specific fields remains a constant handicap of a modern student. The net result is that a great deal of the Saiva, Sakta and Tantric wisdom is now lost to us and many of their important theses now look completely strange. M.M. Dr. G.N. Kaviraj in his recently published work Tantrika Vanmaya me Sakta Drsti, (Pra-stavana, p. 4) gives an eloquent expression to it : In this context due stress may be laid on the fact that the concepts of Krama, Paduka, Bhasa and Kalana exclusively belong to the Krama system."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"( x ) While writing a dissertation on the Stotras of Abhinava-gupta for his M.A. examination the author was particularly attracted by the Kramastotra of Abhinava. This marks the first point of his interest in the system. The paucity of material for the study of the Stotra and the difficulty in interpreting the same inspired the author to undertake a comprehensive study of the same for his doctoral dissertation. The interest and fear both grew with each passing day when the author was able to grasp the enormity of the task taken up by him. Now this study is submitted for what it is worth to the discerning judgement of the reader. The Krama system has triple significance. First, it is a Tantric system. Second, it is a monistic Saiva system. Third, it marks the emergence of the Sakta tendency in the Saiva philosophy. It has, therefore, developed into a synthetic and complex whole in which the Saiva philosophy, the Sakta eso-tericism and the Tantric synoptic view of life are inter-knitted together. It has been a difficult test for the author to appreciate their distinct implications and yet retain their synthesis. The Krama system is therefore not only a system of pure philosophy revelling in epistemic and ontological issues but also an esoteric discipline of spirituality constituting an important ingredient of wider Tantric culture. The reader is earnestly urged to bear this aspect in mind while going through the pages of this work. The complex character of the Krama system has consi-derably influenced and defined the basic plan of this work. It has been divided into two parts, the first giving out a general and historical survey and the second the analytical exposition of the Krama philosophy. The second part does not deal with the ontology, epistemology, mysticism and esotericism of the Krama system under separate sections, because such a water-tight division was neither possible nor worth-while in the very nature of the Krama system. The chapters, therefore, follow the traditional scheme of the Nine Prameyas (i.e., objects of discussion) and Cakras (forms of cyclic consciousness). Because by adopting this method alone justice could be done to the complex character of the Krama system. Special care has"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"( xi ) been taken to highlight the real philosophical and epistemic nature of apparently esoteric issues in the relevant contexts. Owing to an earnest desire to make the work as thorough and authentic as possible the author has added five indices (together with a Corrigendum incorporating major corrections) to the Volume One including a classified Bibliography which because of its comprehensive and up-to-date coverage may be found of special interest. The other index titled \"Chronological tree of the Krama authors\" offers a brief tabular account of the historical evolution of the system through the ages. The Volume Two carries with it an appendix incorporat-ing a few of the unpublished small but important texts having direct bearing on the system. In this volume the author has further appended tables or tabular charts wherever necessary in order to afford a synoptic peep into the complex and varied contents covered in a particular chapter. It is, however, imper-ative to keep in mind that the two volumes together form an integral whole and need be perused as such. The capacity of the author has several limitations. First of all, the lack of tradition is to be extremely regretted because the precise tantric spirit has lain under the cloud of mystic jargon. Second, the system has failed to catch the notice of the modern student of Kashmir Saivism and Tantricism. Third, all the printed texts are either incomplete or require critical editing. Fourth, the bulk of the extant Krama literature is still in manuscript form. Most of it is inaccessible today. Luckily, despite great hardships, the author could lay his hand on certain unnoticed manuscripts but for which many aspects of the system would have remained a question mark. And even these manuscripts are mostly in Sarada characters. Of the lost texts, the loss of the Krama-keli of Abhinavagupta is a very serious loss to the system. In the above circumstances and in the absence of any previous groundwork as well as for the reasons of space, it was not possible for the author to take up a thoroughly critical study of the Krama system. The author has confined himself to making an analytical investigation into and exposition of the system. He has adopted a critico-comparative method, wherever"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"( xii ) it was feasible, in the specific frame-work of the Tantric discip-line. This work is intended basically to serve as a groundwork for the future studies of the Krama system and allied Saiva Tantricism of Kashmir. In works of such a type as this it is practically impossible to do away with obscurity of expression, more so on account of the occult language and esoteric phraseology in which the system is couched, apart from the author's own limitations. The indulgence of the reader is craved for any incovenience he is put to in this behalf. It is difficult to lay claim to absolute originality in regard to an indological study like this, but it will be worth-while to draw attention of the reader to the new ground covered by the author. In the first place, the author has ventured to touch upon an almost neglected area of Kashmir Saivism in general and Tantricism in particular. In the second place, the author has utilized the opportun-ity to go through all published texts on the Kashmir Saivism as well as the Krama system. He has also tried to utilize a large number of important manuscripts on the system which would be testified to by the bibliography appended to this work as well as the profuse excerpts from them given throughout the work. The author has also sought to lay his hands upon all relevant historical as well as literary texts. Moreover, the author has also taken due cognizance of relevant literature in original, belonging to other Tantric cults, specially Tripura, having anything in common with the Kashmir Saivism and the Krama system. It may, however, also be pointed out that the author has done his best to go through all the available secondary literature, whether published or unpublished, known and acces-sible to him on the Kashmir Saivism and other cognate Tantric schools. In the third place, the author has essayed the task of reconstructing the history of the Krama system - not consider-ing the chronology of the authors or works only, but tracing out the historical and logical growth of the Krama notions as well - in the larger context of the history of the Kashmir Saivism. Besides, virtually discovering quite a few of the Krama authors"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"( xiii ) such as Gandhamadana, Siddhanatha, Cakrapani, Devabhatta, Ramyadeva, Losthadeva, Srivatsa, Somaputra, Ananta Sakti-pada and Bhattaraka, the Krama associations of the known Spanda and Trika authors have also been brought out. These include the famous Vasugupta, Kallata, Pradyumna Bhatta, Ksemaraja, Varadaraja, Jayaratha, Sivopadhyaya and a host of others. Some already established dates and genealogical relationships have been re-examined in the light of fresh material and additional collateral evidence. In this connection the dates of Sivananda - the first preceptor, Varadaraja, Hras-vanatha, Bhojaraja, Cakrabhanu, Mahesvarananda deserve particular mention. Similarly on the basis of a new interpre-tation of the terms Atmaja and Santati parental ties between Somananda and Utpala and those between Utpala and Laks-managupta have been rejected and preceptorial relationships re-affirmed instead. These modifications will go a longway in determining the final course of the history of Kashmir Saivism yet to be reconstructed fully by future scholars. In the fourth place, the author has tried to reconstruct the precise Krama metaphysics, its answer to various philosophi-cal problems and the basic values that have permeated the length and width of its spiritual approach. The author has also attempted to determine the place of Krama in the compact whole of Kashmir Saivism and evaluate its positive contri-bution. It has also been pointed out how the Krama developed along two basically different lines under the impact of Northern and Southern schools, if such a loose expression be permitted to be used, and how they conditioned the entire growth of the Krama philosophy. In the fifth place, the work refers to many texts including manuscripts for the first time and makes extensive use of a number of them. The two Mahanaya Prakasas, one of unknown authorship (attributed to Sivananda II by us) and the other of Sitikantha, the Bhavopahara of Cakrapani and its gloss by Ramyadeva, and the Krama-stotra of Abninava are among the primed texts that have been studied for the first time.

The delay in publication enabled the author to revise the typescript once again and to incorporate additional material wherever necessary. The author wishes to voice his earnest ap-preciation of the interest evinced by the publishers M/S Motilal Banarsidass. But for constant demands of their energetic directors, Mr. N. Prakash Jain and Mr.J.P. Jain, the publication of the work, that too in such a nice get up, might have been delayed further. In this connection he has all admiration for M/S Ram Lal and D.P.

The author cannot help re-member the debt he owes to his wife Dr. Sudha Rastogi, Ph.D., who not only proved to be a constant source of inspiration in the hours of distress but also prepared all the indices in the book.

Krama: A system of Saiva philosophy in its own right While sharing much in common with the Pratyabhijna and Kula systems of Kashmir Saiva monism, the Krama system has much of its own to justify its recognition as an indepen-dent system of philosophy. The phrase Kashmir Saivism generally stands for the Pratyabhijna system, whereas in fact it has a much wider application comprising as it does all the monis-tic trends of Saivite speculation having their home in Kashmir. In spite of the fact that all these systems have common funda-mental data since they spring from the same source of Saiva philosophy, they retain their intrinsic individual genius and appeal. In consequence, when a system is presented in its own merit, the idea is not to decry its integral character under a wider perspective, but to emphasize and analyse its real worth and significance. It is in this sense that the Krama system, despite its close affinities with the sister trends of thought, claims recognition as a system of philosophy. 2. Traditional recognition of its independence Historically as well, Krama has been regarded as an independent system. Mankha in his Srikanthacarita mentions Mahanaya, another name of Krama, as a distinct philosophical school where the act of creation5 follows that of withdrawal,"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"2   Krama Tantricism of Kashmir implying that the Krama system ardently adheres to the cyclic notion of Reality. This allusion to Krama in a literary work of the eleventh century is a sufficient proof of the popularity of the Krama school, even beyond the philosophical circles, in Kashmir. Abhinavagupta recalls the same fact in unmistakable terms in the Malinivijayavartika.l In the Tantraloka also this very fact has been reiterated.2 In his Viveka on the Tantraloka Jayaratha talks of the Krama system to be an independent one.3 The treatment of the Krama system in the fourth Ahnika has been prefaced by him with a similar remark.4 It is significant to note that in the last autobiographical verse, marking the conclusion of his Viveka, he declares 'Trika' and 'Krama' as two different systems.5 The author of the Mahanaya-Prakasa clearly stresses its individuality8 and independent status among the varied schools of philosophy.7 Mahesvarananda, too, does"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Krama as a Distinct System   3   not forget to record his appreciation of the Pratyabhijna and the Krama as two separate systems1 even when he means to pin-point their common characters.2 3. External evidence establishing its individuality Apart from the unanimous verdict of the Krama authors, there is external evidence also which establishes its indepen-dent status. It differs from other systems in point of its origin, its history, and its literature. Just as the Pratyabhijna has its first preceptor in Somananda, the Trika in Vasugupta, and the Kula in Macchanda, the Krama [has the same in Sivananda. The Krama system is further distinguished by the place of its origin. Its very conception took place in Kashmir, while all others somehow or the other, with the exception of the Spanda system, were imported into Kashmir by their preceptors or descendants and followers thereof. 4. Main Features We, however, have to distinguish between what others say of it and what the system says of itself. A brief account and comparative analysis of its salient features are attempted here to substantiate its unique character. (a) Krama as a Sakti-oriented and Tantric system The Krama system at the outset appears to reflect a systematic emergence of the Sakta tendencies in the monistic Saivism of Kashmir.3 As such it gives rise to many interesting developments and leads to many adjustments in the history of the Krama thought. The most important of such developments is the split of the system into two schools, one having its accent on the supremacy of the Siva aspect and the other on the Sakti"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"4   Krama Tantricism of Kashmir aspect of the Supreme Consciousness.1 Thus, while all other systems including the Kula, Pratyabhijna and Trika of Kash-mir Saivism are Siva-oriented, the Krama is Sakti-oriented.2 The Spanda system is an exception in the sense that it marks the transition between the two ideologies. But, at the same time, it has a natural leaning towards Sakti, the dynamic aspect of Reality. The important distinction beween the Spanda and the Krama lies in the fact that while the latter is a Tantric system, the former is not. It is perhaps the reason why Abhinava-gupta, in his Tantraloka, deals with the Krama system under the Saktopaya as a distinct system of thought and does not accord a separate treatment to the Spanda school, though it (the Tantraloka) is full of references to and extracts from the Spanda authors and works.3 The fact that the Pratyabhijna has secured a separate treatment under the Anupaya in the Tantraloka unlike the Spanda, the latter approximates to the former in respect of metaphysics rather than mysticism and 1. Likewise, the Kula and Tripura too are known to be different systems, but in fact they complement each other with the difference that while the Tripura lays stress on Sakti, the Feminine aspect, the Kula on Siva, the Masculine. 2. It may not entirely be out of point to connect this tremendous empha-sis of the Sakti aspect with the spiritual activity undertaken by the female preceptors. The importance of the role played by the female teachers may be assessed from the fact that the system is said to have originated from the mouth of the Yoginis (lady ascetics) It is difficult to establish a \"cause and effect\" relation-ship between the Sakti-orientations and early preachings by female ascetics, yet it is a factor to be reckoned with. We have tried to deal with this phenomenon while disscussing the tantric character as well as the historical development of the system. This may, however, be taken as a practical translation of the theoretical orientation. 3. Howsoever strange it may appear, it is important to note that Abhi-navagupta who wrote so profusely and copiously on almost all the matters relating to Kashmir Saivism did not write a single indepen-dent work bearing on the Spanda branch. This fact has been noticed by Ksemaraja. Vide,"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Krama as a Distinct System   5   esotericism.1 On the contrary, the Kula and the Krama, both being Tantric in origin and form, are more mystic than meta-physical. Yet, with all their differences they constitute together what is precisely meant by monistic Saivism of Kashmir. (b) Leaning towards monistic-dualistic character of Reality: its implication and consequences Another aspect which distinguishes the Krama system from other associate schools is its proneness towards the moni-stic-dualistic character of Reality at the pre-realization stage. As a spiritual discipline it has been specially designated as Bhedabhedopaya in order to bring out the importance it attaches to the idea of dualism or diversity within the general framework of monism or unity. The Krama system in the above role does not seek to confuse or mix up the two polarities (duality-cum-unity) but instead, unearths unity in the phenomenal duality as its intrinsic character (unity in duality - Bhede abhe-dah).2 In other words the Krama is more closely connected with the immanent reality and interprets immanence as an essential expression of transcendence. Against this, the Pratyabhijna and Kula systems are immediately concerned with reality as unity (abheda) or the transcendental aspect of Reality. Whenever there appears a difference in the systems it is only the diffe-rence of approach or the general outlook. Even when the Bhe-dabhedavadin (in practice) is a real monist (in theory), he justifies the individuality of his approach by his utmost tolerance towards the other cognate systems.3 It eschews its dogmatism in this respect. In fact, the Krama system regards both duality and non-duality as irrelevant, since such a concept of Reality cannot be anything but relative. As a consequence, the system is very very critical of the concepts of Bandha 1. In incorporating the Pratyabhijna as an inalienable part of the basic plan of the Tantraloka Abhinava was possibly motivated by its enorm-ous metaphysical value. Because it is the notion of Pratyabhijnana (recognition) that is the most significant single constituent of all the monistic Saiva systems of Kashmir. 2. Cf. Pt II, Ch. I under \"The Defining Features of Saktopaya\" etc. and \"Multiplicity of Approaches: A Special Feature\". 3. Cf. Ibid., under \"The Krama versus Other Systems\" etc."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"6   Krama Tantricism of Kashmir (fetters) versus Moksa (freedom).1 Thus the Kula system prohibits the rituals and the Siddhanta Saivism advocates them. But the Krama and the Trika systems look upon the concepts of prohibition and injunction or negation and predication as external to the nature of Reality.2 (c) Spiritual progression and moksa as synthesis of bhoga and moksa : Key features Moreover the definition of the Kula and Krama systems in terms of Sambhavopaya and Saktopaya is enough to focus their mutual points of difference and agreement. This point will be discussed on the occasion of the study of the Krama system as Saktopaya.3 It is however, necessary to remember that the Pratyabhijna and the Kula do not subscribe to the idea of spiritual progression. But, the concept of spiritual prog-ression is the very life-blood of the Krama system and its theory of the refinement of the thought-constructs (Vikalpa-samskara). The very term Krama denotes what is called spiritual progres-sion. Similarly the term Kula (i.e., an organic whole) justifies its nomenclature by its non-adherence to the theory of Vikalpa and succession in self-realization. Thus the tantric ideal of self-realization as synthesis of Bhoga and Moksa, better termed as Bhoga-moksa-samarasya, is realizable in the Krama system alone.4 It is solely the Krama system which by virtue of its 1.

I, under \"Problem of Purity and Impurity in Relation to Consciousness\". 3. Cf. Pt II, Ch. I, under \"The Defining Features of Saktopaya\"."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Krama as a Distinct System    7    theory of progressive refinement of Vikalpas lays equal empha-sis on each and every step of self-realization as an embodi-ment of spirituality. The Kula and Pratyabhijna are not opposed or averse to such an ideal, but they do not have proper scope for it, since they adhere to the concept of instant-aneous and immediate self-revelation. The image of the Krama system becomes clear only when we see through its concept of the Samarasya of Dhama-Varna (Name and Form) and Cit (consciousness).1 (d) Absolutic functionalism : A signficant aspect In this context a minor but significant point, though not entirely relevant, may also be adverted to. The functionalistic doctrine of the Trika i.e., five functions of the Absolute, has been adjusted suitably to the requirements of the Krama system. Thus the last two of the five Absolutic acts namely, Tirodhana and Anugraha, have been replaced by Anakhya and Bhasa.2 (e) Positive emphasis on the epistemic side of our experience Krama is a system with a positive epistemic bias. The epistemic undertones of the system form its special character and contrast it from the other systems.3 It has just been noted that the Pratyabhijna and Spanda Schools are more metaphysi-cal in intent. And though the Kula and the Krama, in common, have esoteric and mystical appearance, it is the Krama that lays more positive emphasis on the cognitive and the epistemic 2. Cf. Pt. II. Ch. I, under \"The Discovery of One's Potencies as a means to Self-discovery; Ch. III, under \"The Relevance of the Present Treatment to Saktopaya and its Metaphysics\". 3. Cf. Pt. II, Ch.

III, under \"Core of the Problem with reference to Cognitive Processes Examined\"."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"8   Krama Tantricism of Kashmir aspect. This is perhaps the basic philosophical value of the Krama as a system of philosophy. (f) Preference for Prakrta and certain minor features A reference to another unique Krama phenomenon would not be out of place here. It is really a characteristic feature of the Krama school that it favours Prakrta1 in place of Samskrta for the presentation of its tenets. There is positive evidence to show that works like the Krama-sutra, both of the Mahanaya-Prakasas, Mahartha-Manjari, Chumma-sampradaya, Prakrta-trimsikavivarana and works of a few other authors were written in some form of the Prakrta or local vernaculars. Mahesvarananda is the first authority who takes note of it. There is only one other Tantric system which also evinces a preference for the use of Prakrta. But that is a Sakta system, not Saiva, famed as Tripura.2 It, however, does not mean that the use of Samskrta was rare and unusual. On the contrary, the bulk of the literature, presently available, is in Samskrta. Likewise, a sweeping conclusion that the Krama had more popular appeal than other systems will probably be some-what remote from truth. What is the possible source of such a phenomenon is a question that is proposed to be taken up in our study of the historical forces that gave the Krama a shape and a figure. Similarly the division of entire monistic Saiva thought into two classes namely, Traiyambaka and Ardha-traiyambaka, will also be considered under our study of Krama's tantric character. In this connection it may be noticed that while Kula is considered to be the Ardhatraiyam-baka, the Krama, Kula and Pratyabhijna belong to the Trai-yambaka category. The only justification for alluding to it here But this has again to be noted that no work on the Tripura, which is in Prakrta, has come to our notice, whereas at least three of the above mentioned Krama works e.g., M. P, (S), C.S. (MS) and M. M. have come down to us."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Krama as a Distinct System   9   lies in the nature of the present enquiry which particularly aims at projecting the individual character of the Krama system. It should now be clear that internal as well as historical evidence is weighty enough to substantiate that the Krama is a system of tantric philosophy which merits a sincere considera-tion in its own right."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"CHAPTER II ON THE NOMENCLATURE OF THE SYSTEM A study into the philosophical basis of the various names of the system and their significance The Krama system is variously styled as Kramanaya, Mahartha-naya etc., etc. Let us take each seriatim. 1. Krama-Naya The first ever definite reference to the Krama as a system of philosophy, as we have already seen, is found in Abhinava. But it is rather amusing that he did not try to define the word symbolizing a particular system. It is Jayaratha who identifies it with the theory that confides in the fourfold functionalism of the Absolute.1 This interpretation is not Jayaratha's own, but traditional one. For even before Abhinava, Utpala, popularly called Utpala Vaisnava and a contemporary of his teachers, interpreted the term in traditional phraseology of Kramacatuska (fourfold succession).2 This is borne out by a statement of Ksemaraja who takes the word Krama to stand for the succession of the cyclic consciousness of emanation (Srsti), Similarly Sivananda. the grand teacher of Mahesvarananda, has nearly the same definition:"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"On the Nomenclature of the System   11   sustenance (Sthiti) and withdrawal (Samhrti).1 While explaining the words \"Krama-mudra\" and \"Mudra-krama\" from the Krama-Sutras he also defines the word Krama in the context of the system. According to him, it is called Krama because it (i) causes emanation etc. to appear in succession (Krama) and (ii) itself constitutes the very nature of that (as well as their) successive appearance.2 Hence Krama is the system that deals with such a phenomenon exclusively, all other aspects remaining subordinate to it. Let us consider in brief its precise bearing on the problem. One of the most basic tenets of the entire monistic Saiva thought of Kashmir is its theory of the five acts of the Absolute, namely, Srsti (ema-nation or emergence), Sthiti (sustenance), Samhara (withdra-wal or submergence), Tirodhana (concealment), and Anugraha (dispensing grace). The functionalistic doctrine, in question, maintains that the Absolute is unceasingly busy in bringing about these five acts, be it phenomenal order of existence or the trans-phenomenal one. It is the unfoldment of his being. Therefore, those who always reflect upon this pentadic activity of the Godhead, knowing the universe as an unfoldment and expression of the essential nature of Awareness, never fail to attain perfection and realize their true self in this very life. Those, for whom the objective content of their experience does not partake of the godly essence, continue to remain under the binding influence of ignorance.3 The greatest advantage of this theory consists in its distinguishing the Kashmir Saiva monism from the Vedantic one.4 Now the Krama is the system that"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"12   Krama Tantricism of Kashmir specially builds on this theme.1 So active has been its interest in the problem that the system saw the emergence of two divergent opinions with respect to the exact meaning of the word Krama. These theories later crystallized into what are known as Four-function (Catustayartha) and Five-function (Pancartha) theories. We however refrain from entering into controversy except making some necessary references since the same has been enlarged upon in the sequel.2 Samvit or Awareness-reality itself is succession or Krama. Whether it is a process of empirical cognition or that of reflect-ive meditation or cosmic emanation, it is Samvit that defines and undergoes the process of succession (Krama). This process of succession is also termed Mahakrama.3 Owing to varying traditions the entire process might be said to entertain four4 or five5 phases. In the four fold scheme the fifth function namely, Bhasa, is excluded while the fivefold scheme comprises all the acts. Whatever the case, these phases presuppose the cyclic notion of reality whose flow remains uninterrupted and uniform throughout. The genesis of numerical difference and successive phases lies in the intrinsic dynamism of the reality itself. The unitary flow appears to be divided due to the four acts that come in a succession. This divisive flow of the inherent 1. Cf. Pt. If, Ch. I, under 'Rise of the Cycle of Awareness\"; Ch. III, under \"Anakhya Cakra as Samviccakra and Saktopaya\". 2. Cf. Pt. II, Ch. III, under \"Krama as Pancartha and Catustayartha\" etc."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"On the Nomenclature of the  System  13  dynamism itself constitutes the Krama or succession.1 Sometimes the place of the godly function is annexed by the godly potencies with little material effect on our stand.2 The conception and structural niceties of the Samviccakra can only be explained with reference to this definition of the Krama and its implications, too, regarding the cyclic idea of reality resulting from its dynamic character. Because the twelve Kalis are the epistemic-metaphysical-mystic transformation of the fourfold (or fivefold) functionalism with regard to the object, subject and means of knowing or the first three acts,3 in epistemic and cosmogonical settings respectively. This provides the proper context where the Krama system brings the real synthesis between the successive process of cosmic emergence and the trans-successive monistic principle - the primal origin of the ensuing succession. Unity and continuity of the absolutic (and hence subjective) dynamism can be realized only when the seeming gaps between the discrete modes viz., creation etc., of the absolutic manifestation are conserved and transformed into the real links that not only join but build the synthetic whole. This is done by tracing out the inner unity that pervades all these functional cycles. It is why the one, who has developed an intuitive insight into the essential character of the succession characterising the cyclic movement of the absolutic agency, earns a claim to emancipation during one's lifetime.4 3. The first three acts, like Pancartha and Catustayartha, may be designated as Tryartha . This is possibly suggested by the following extract:-See for detailed discussion, Pt. II, Ch. I, under \"Mutua relationship of the five cycles and conclusion\"; Ch. III, under \"Two Relevant Sub-features of Liberation.\""},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"14 Krama Tantircism of Kashmir The Krama has been further defined, under the spell of the Kashmir Saivism in general, in terms of time (Kala) and has been doubly designated as Kalakrama1 as well as Kala.2 Kalakrama is a tautological expression because in its verbal analysis it is rendered as the succession called time (Kala-khyah Kramah) and not as succession of time (Kalasya Kramah). The Krama as time is responsible for the manifest-ation of total objectivity and absence thereof.3 It rather partakes of such a manifestation or non-manifestation as the case may be. In all fairness, it must be admitted that the present definition is not meant to explain the Krama's special status as a system of Saiva monism.4 The sole underlying idea is to expatiate upon and account for the phenomenon of succes-sion in our routine experiences ranging from the microcosmic level to the macrocosmic one, and also how the discrete units coming in a series flow from the non-dual supra-sequential source. Because it is the objective world that is characterised and determined by succession and not the Absolute. In the context of the absolute reality the word Kala would not mean simple sequential time, but creative time, the potential for the emergent reality of emanation.5 Hence the interpretation of the 4.

Accordingly, the word Krama may be employed in two different ways e.g., the relative as well as the absolute. As a relative expression it calls for its counter-entity (Pratiyogin) in Akrama (trans-sequential) and signifies a particular phenomenon of our experience. In the phenomenal realm when the different opera-tions of our cognitive apparatus and psychoses are directed to the grasp of external multiplicity, the whole situation is reckoned as Krama. Likewise, when the phenomenal level is transcended by diverting the same mechanism towards the trans-phenomenal, non-dual, undifferentiated reality, everything is automatically realized in its essentially trans-sequential cha-racter. This phenomenon is designated as Akrama.2 On the other hand, as an absolute expression the word Krama stands for the same 'Akrama' reality which remains always continuous, contd.] 1. See Pt. II, Ch. II. Quoted from an Agama, T. A. V, III, p. 132. Be it noted that the expression Devatah stands for the Karanesvaris.

Thus the main accent of all those attempts, that dwelt on the Krama as a specific system, appears to have been on the modus operandi of the principle of awareness (Cit-Krama). By fully appreciating the course and process adopted for the manifestation and realization of self we are made to fathom the inner depths of consciousness i.e., Reality per se. Thus the Krama, in simple language, may be identified with Cit-krama or Bodha-krama.4 (a) Anuttara-Krama Sometimes the word Krama is qualified by or prefixed with some other appellation or epithet in order to lay special emphasis on a particular aspect of the system without interfer-ing with its actual signification. Thus, for instance, it has been"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"On the Nomenclature of the System   17   described as Anuttara Krama (metempirical order) bringing into focus the transcendental character of the supreme experi-ence as twin-accomplishment in which lay the two poles of ob-jective enjoyment and subjective freedom in perfect harmony.1 (b) Anupaya-Krama Exactly on similar lines the Krama has been designated as Anupaya Krama2 marking the highest spiritual and yogic attain-ment. The Anupaya-krama precisely has the same meaning as one conveyed by the word Krama when employed in its absolute sense of the ultimate ideal, as seen above. (c) Devata-Krama Similarly it has been styled as Devata-krama (order of the divinities) emphasizing that the inner significance of all the stages of cosmic emanation and spiritual advancement and, for that matter, of the Samviccakra lies in their divine character. Each step in the process, therefore, represents a divinity.3 (d) Mahakrama In the opening pages, Mahakrama as a synonym of Krama4 has been looked into. This title has been probably coined in the wake of another name of the Krama system i.e., Mahartha, which is proposed to be discussed below and which literally means 'the great reality' or 'the great meaning'.

Since a reference has also been made to Sivananda,3 the earliest preceptor, whose name is associated with Kashmir, it appears a feasible reason to call the Krama system by the name of the Auttara Krama or the Auttara Tattva. Another factor that might have contributed to such a nomenclature is Krama's inclusion under Uttaramnaya. According to the traditional lore Uttaramnaya stands for the teachings proceeding from the Northern mouth of Siva, that is, the 'Vamamarga', because the Northern face is to the left. According to Dr. Pandey,4 this interpretation agrees with the fact that the Krama enjoins the Dutiyaga5 and the use of liquor, woman and meat as essentials6 of worship which are necessary ingredients of the Vamamarga. It is, however, difficult to say that this is the precise suggestion of dubbing the Krama as practising the Vamamarga. Although in the later form of the Krama system, which is chiefly presented by Mahesvarananda, such apparently immoral tendencies did crop up and earned a respectable place for themselves, yet the main stress laid by the Krama has always been on the spiritual side. Moreover the Krama is not called Uttaramnaya, but the cream and essence of the Uttaramnaya.7 In fact, the entire monistic current of 3. M. M. P , 197. 4. Cf.

The difficulty is aggravated by Raghava Bhatta, who in his commentary on a verse of the Saradatilaka,4 remarks that the first half of the verse incorporates the Praty-abhijna doctrine as propounded by the Siva-sutra and Trika-bheda etc., whereas the second half represents the Uttaram-naya view.5 He quotes from a certain source to substantiate his contention but does not name the work. If one abides by the thesis of Raghava Bhatta, he will have to admit that the Trika and the Uttaramnaya are two different things and reject the previously held view that the Uttaramnaya is another name for the monistic trend of the Saivite speculation of Kashmir. As a compromise formula it may be suggested that while distingu-"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"On the Nomenclature of the System   21   ishing between the two (Pratyabhijna and Uttaramnaya) the commentator (as well as the author) wants to pinpoint their classical and agamic nature respectively. But as the things are, the Uttaramnaya view, in question, is nearer to the Krama than to the Pratyabhijna. Still, as has been said, it is difficult to state anything categorically in such a confused state of affairs.1 Nevertheless, though we may not be certain about the exact significance of the term Uttaramnaya, the appellation Auttara Krama, from its geographical perspective, does not pose a problem. 2. Mahartha or Mahartha-Naya The other equally meaningful and popular denomination of the system is Mahartha. In its most current form the word Mahartha is used to denote the system,2 but occasionally the word Drsti (i.e., point of view or philosophy)3 or Naya4 (i. e. 1. It might be useful to quote the following observation of M. M. Gopinath Kaviraj:"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"22   Krama Tantricism of Kashmir system) has also been added to give it a more compact look. Historically the term Mahartha as a substitute for the word Krama meaning a system is a later development and perhaps the earliest allusion to the system in this form may be traced to Ksemaraja.1 And as the system grew, the word Mahartha rather overshadowed the usage of the word Krama in later literature2 and gained the status of a full-fledged system, as the use of the word siddhanta3 for it would indicate. In this con-text it is necessary to note that this word is employed to convey two different, though complementary, senses. In the first place it is a name of a philosophical system4 and in the second, it stands for the ideal or value the system deems to be ultimate and, consequently, harnesses its entire machinery to attain the same.5 Really speaking the first sense is derived from the second one and, hence, stands for that system which deals with the principle of Mahartha. 1.

M.P., pp. 179, 194, 197, 201."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"On the Nomenclature of the System   23   It may, however, be noted in passing that the word Mahartha seems to have been formulated under the tantric impact, particularly that of the Tripura system. It is conceived to serve as the basic substrate for the totality of the sixfold reality or meaning as envisaged in the Sakta tantras. A peep into a statement1 of Mahesvarananda would perhaps explain the basis of the present contention. Let us, now, enquire into the precise meaning and nature of the Mahartha. Why is it that it is preferred to name the principle of fundamental reality as Mahartha? The obvious reason seems to be that the tantric philosophy usually holds that the ultimate reality has two aspects - word and meaning (vacaka and vacya). The entire stretch of our field of experi-ence, whether mundane or meta-mundane, is subsumed under these two aspects which are knit together by the relation of significand-significans (vacaka-vacya-bhava). Thus the ultimate reality, in its aspect as the Logos i.e., word, is the Vacaka and so is it with regard to its ontological being and formal becom-ing, the Import i.e., Vacya. Vacya and Artha being synonym-ous, it is the absolute or the basic reality that is termed as Mahartha.2 Thus the term Mahartha, as denotative of the \"great principle of meaning or reality\" brings into relief the emergent nature of reality as containing the total possibilities of self-becoming. This has an explicit reference to the dynamic aspect of reality which comprehends and accounts for the cosmic expansion of the Absolutic personality. The Krama is necessarily related with this emergence and expression of Reality.3 Sitikantha, the celebrated author of the Mahanaya-"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"24   Krama Tantricism of Kashmir Prakasa has devoted the first and third chapters (Udayas) of his treatise exclusively to discuss and determine the precise meaning of the term Mahartha. A few aspects of the problem have again been looked into in the fourth and eleventh chapters. For want . of space it is not possible to go into each detail, but an attempt will be made to study his important observations in this regard. He himself poses the problem - what can be said to be the great meaning denoted by the word Mahartha1 and proceeds to answer. His primary contention is that in view of the moni-stic ideology, none else than the reality itself which is one with consciousness, can be the true import of the term. But when it comes to adopting an analytical attitude towards reality, there are five things that may afford to be called Mahartha. These five are - (i) the indivisible and partless reality, (ii) aspects of that reality, (iii) approaches leading to the attainment of the reality or (iv) to that of the aspect thereof, and (v) ancillary approaches that are instrumental to the fruition or fructification of the primary approaches indicated above.2 Of course, it is the reality proper which may be called Mahartha in its own right, while the rest are so called only indirectly or second-arily.3 After interpreting\" the term Mahartha from the point of view of reality, he now goes ahead to define the same from the point of view of our experience, spiritual or otherwise. He again puts the question - what is this Mahartha, is it meditating upon the cycles and their presiding deities? No, it denotes the"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"On the Nomenclature of the system   25   condition when one is completely possessed of the feeling of self-sameness1 with the Absolute. He takes up eight instances2 for the sake of illustration and each instance in their ultimate analysis is found to culminate in or turn out as the experience of unity and non-duality with the self. Thus by Mahartha we are to understand that state of mind or spiritual awakening which never loses the sight of ultimate non-duality in all sorts of experiences, whatever the realm of existence they might belong to3 because everything that can be thought of is but an instance of the basically monistic principle. In other words, therefore, the perfect state of mind or the state of self-fulfilment may be equally designated as Mahartha - that dispels even the slightest tinge of distinction between 'I' and 'you' i.e., the self and the not-self.4 The same state of self-perfection is identified with the Anakhya stage in the doctrinal parlance which, too, is said to be characterised by harmony and utter want of duality.5 It, thus, may be logically concluded that these items i.e., the unitary character of reality and the basically non-dual harmonious experience etc., form the main subject-matter of the system. Hence the name Mahartha. 3.

The one is just referred to above and the other is by Sitikantha. The other references to it, indicative of its denoting a system, are found in Jayaratha,2 Sitikantha3 and Ananta Saktipada.4 It has got exactly the same meaning as its counterpart, Mahartha. At least once it has been stated that the word 'Maha' (Mahan) in the compound stands for \"Artha\" i.e., reality.5 It may also be surmised following the present line of thinking that the word Mahanaya was probably a condensed or abridged form of the phrase Maharthanaya wherein 'Mahan' stood for reality (as conceived by the Krama system) and 'Naya' for the system. 4. Mahasara We are not absolutely certain that the word Mahasara stood for the Krama system. But the context, in which this phrase6 is found, is weighty enough to support the hypothesis that Ksemaraja wants us to believe that it was another way of presenting the Mahartha ideal. Because the phrase immediately"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"On the Nomenclature of the System   27   follows his remark that the Stotra in question (i.e., Divya-krida-bahumanastotra) is replete with the statements bearing upon the Maharthatattva.1 Moreover, his qualifying the word Mahasara with the epithet Stiman,2 as he usually does with Mahartha when he wishes to refer to the system,3 strengthens our conjecture. 5. Atinaya On the authority of an extract cited by Jayaratha in order to demonstrate the lack of complete unanimity with regard to the precise line of the Krama teachers, it may be concluded that the Krama system was also known as Atinaya.4 In Sitikantha one finds this position categorically endorsed.5 Here a problem poses itself which escapes a definite solu-tion for the present. Abhinavagupta, while enumerating different systems of the Kashmir Saiva group, also mentions a system named Atimarga.6 Since the Atimarga is mentioned side by side the Krama and Kula, it is natural to treat them as the separate lines of thought. But, curiously enough, Jayaratha cites a passage7 which presents Atimarga as Kula, because the reference is being made to Sumatinatha, the great-grand-teacher of Abhinava in the Kula system. Now the problem can briefly be put as under -"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"28   Krama Tantricism of Kashmir (a) Do the two terms namely, Atinaya and Atimarga, stand for one and the same system? If so which is that system, since (i) Atimarga is different from the Krama and Kula systems according to Abhinava, (ii) Atinaya is identified with the Krama, as has been noted above, (iii) Atimarga is identified with the Kula system by an authority approvingly quoted by Jayaratha. There are two probable alternatives. First, the Atimarga may be taken as constituting a common trait of all the monistic systems of Kashmir which, according to the unanimous verdict of the tradition, are inherently superior (atinaya - nayam atikramya) to other systems. Hence its equation with either of the Kula and Krama does not cause much difficulty. The separate identity of the Kula and Krama withers away when the Krama ultimately culminates in the Kula. This contention has a purely hypothetical value in the absence of any positive evidence to bear it out. The second alternative is suggested by a cue from Sitikantha. The Atinaya, accordingly, may be identified with the Samaya-Vidya i.e., Tripura system, in the sense that the highest ideal of the Krama system is also the supreme goal of the Samaya-vidya marking the culmination of the entire panorama of the Krama.1 This alternative seems more plausible, because Kashmir's contribution to the Tripura system is immense and in no measure less than that to the Kula etc. The Krama system may also be viewed as a transitionary link between the Kula, a Saiva system, and the Tripura, a Sakta system, with no fundamental difference except one in their varying emphasis on one of the two aspects. When Abhi-navagupta refers to the Atimarga as independent of the Kula, he might have intended to highlight the individual status of the two systems (Tripura and Kula). And where Atinaya is identi-"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"On the Nomenclature of the System   29   fied with Krama or Atimarga with Kula, the emphasis seems to be on their agreements. We however leave the question open for future research with the comment that there was a time in the history of the Krama thought when the word Atinaya signified the Krama system. Thus the controversy view comes to address itself to the feasibility and tenability of the equation between the Atimarga and the Atinaya. 6. Devatanaya or Devinaya From the context it is obvious that Jayaratha interprets the word Devinaya in terms of the Krama system.1 The doctrine that holds the female divinity (the female aspect of reality i e., Sakti or Kali) as the ultimate principle is designated as Devata-naya.2 The main thesis of the system consists in the capacity of reality (in its female aspect) to come out and chisel the entire multiplicity even without the support of a canvas. The term Devatanaya is more palatable to those who subscribe to the theory of the absolute ultimacy of the female aspect and relegate the male aspect of reality (i.e., Siva) to a slightly inferior position. They believe in the basic identity of the two aspects, yet feel that whatever their difference, howsoever minute, is worthy of careful attention for the infallible and correct appre-ciation of reality. To them, therefore, the Paramesvara (or the Lord-Absolute) marks the end of the traffic of time (Kala), whereas the Devi (the Lady-Absolute) is the repository or the culminating point of that end itself.3 Sitikantha cites certain **Avagraha (s) after Apte has been added by us to make the line intelligible."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"30   Krama Tantricism of Kashmir agamic source to suggest that the Devatanaya (i.e., system of the goddess) is the system that revolves round the divine func-tionalism and where the functions e.g., Srsti, etc. are the other names of the powers of the Absolute such as volition etc.1 7. Kalinaya There are no particular reasons for naming it as Kalinaya other than those adduced above. The Devi, which is the absolute ontological principle, is designated as Kali or Kala-Samkarsini.3 Another possible reason might lie in its adherence to the Anakhya- krama or Samviccakra which accounts for cosmic emanation in terms of the twelve (or thirteen) Kalis.4 8. Conclusion There are a few other designations of the Krama system which are not considered for fear of unnecessary details. More-over, those appellations do not have the common approval of the Krama authors. If they are coined and also referred to, the intention always has been to reflect on the nexus between the Krama system and the particular context in which they figure.

The entire growth of the Krama thought has undergone a radical process of transformation from philosophy to tantricism or a journey from the metaphysical speculation to the tantric practice and symbolism or, to be more exact, from the philosophic tantricism to the esoteric tantricism. From the earliest phase devoted to the analysis and ex-amination of the functional and activistic character of the Absolutic dynamism, one comes to an era of pure tantricism in Mahesvarananda who describes his work as a Tantra1 with a sense of pride.

Tantra-Prakriya Versus Kula-Prakriya:Krama as a part of the Tantra-Prakriya in the Tantraloka The very fact that Abhinavagupta deals with the Krama system in the Tantraloka (lit., the light of the Tantras) makes out a strong case in support of its tantric build up. This con-clusion does not take into account the circumstantial evidence alone. It is, in fact, implied, according to Jayaratha, in the very scheme of the Tantraloka. He says, the whole subject-matter of the Tantraloka falls under two heads viz., Tantra-Prakriya and Kula-Prakriya.1 One is not immediately concerned with Abhinava's comparatively more favourable disposition towards the Kula. What is significant is the fact that the mainstream of the monistic thought has been split into two currents. The first current namely, the Tantra-Prakriya, is traced to Traiyam-baka and the other one namely, the Kula-Prakriya, to Ardha-traiyambaka.2 As the tradition has it, there were four preceptorial schools (or lines of teachers) technically known as Mathikas. The schools founded by Amardaka and Srinatha and continued by their spiritual descendants related to the dualistic and dualis-tic-cum-monistic trends of thought respectively. Traiyambaka was responsible for propagation of the monistic thought. In his case the most peculiar thing is that he is credited with having inspired two monistic schools - one, which he propagated directly, was called the Traiyambaka Mathika and the other, which was founded by a descendant on his daughter's side, won the title of the Ardha-traiyambaka Mathika.3 It is these two 3.

But it is quite likely that one may miss the precise implications of the above contention with regard to the Krama system. It may be noted that while the Kula system is accorded a separate identity as constituting Ardha-traiyambaka line of thinking, all other monistic systems, namely, Trika, Krama and Pratyabhijna (Spanda excluded) are subsumed under the Tantra-Prakriya or the Traiyambaka school.1 It is further to be noted that the fact of such inclusion has not been admitted openly, but the conclusion becomes irres-istible when one finds the entire Sadardha-krama-vijnana (one of the typical ways of presenting the monistic-Saiva thinking of Kashmir in general)2 being identified with the Traiyambaka school. It may also be noted that although the Krama and Trika etc. have different secular history, they seem to be one in the matter of their origin. One factor consists in the generally acclaimed close affinity between the Trika and the Krama.3 The assertion that the Krama system finally culmi-nates in the Kula refers more to the ultimate spiritual possibili-ties of the Krama system than to their apparent structure, while the identity between the Trika and Krama system ensues from their present character. The other factor happens to be that Abhinava learnt Krama from that very set of teachers led by Be it noted that while dwelling upon the Krama concept of parity between predication and negation  Jayaratha gene-rally refers to Krama as Trika, as if the two were one.

And yet both the Tantra and Kula Prakriyas join each other as a part and parcel of a monolithic monistic complex evolved by Abhinavagupta. This may be perhaps due to: (i) the descent of divine revelation of the monistic brand through the same source, namely, Traiyambaka (either directly or indirectly), and (ii) the Kula's unflinching adherence to the agamic wisdom in common with the fellow doctrines, as contained in the Malini-Vijayottara Tantra and thus inclusion of the Kula under the broader Trika scheme.2 3.

Thus, the ultimate reality is transcendental to the Tantrikas, immanent to the Kaulas and transcendent-immanent to the Trikas. This view of Ksemaraja, apparently, comes in direct conflict with the stand adopted by Abhinavagupta that the word Tantra Prakriya is comprehensive enough so as to include all the varying shades of Trika, Krama and Pratyabhijna within its ambit. It is very strange that all the editions of the Pratyabhijnahrdaya and their respective editors are silent on this point - in fact it does not seem to bother any one of them. It, however, appears to the present author that Ksema-raja does not use the word Tantra and Kula in the same technical sense as is used by Abhinava. For, the views ascribed to the Tantra and Kula systems by him are not exactly those as they are known to have held on the basis of the available literature. So far as the con-cept of the ultimate reality is concerned, all the systems - those which are assigned under Tantra-prakriya and those which are not (i e., those which subscribe to Kula-prakriya) - unreservedly take it to be both, transcendent as well as immanent. This view is essentially one which has been ascribed by Ksemaraja to the adherents of the Trika and its like systems (note the word 'adi' in Trikadi). It is, therefore, plausible to conclude that the words Tantra and Kula as used by Ksemaraja do not stand for their counterparts within the fold of Kashmir Saiva Monism, in-stead they represent alien forces. The word Trikadi, in fact, stands for the monistic Saivism of Kashmir in general which is further sub-divided into Tantra and Kula Prakriyas.

For fuller grasp of the subject and comparative analysis of the common features of the tantras Woodroffe's following observation will be helpful:-\"As instances of general ideas I may cite the following: the conception of Deity as a Supreme Personality (Parahamta) and of the double aspect of God in one of which He really is or becomes the Universe; a true emanation from Him in His creative aspect; successive emana-tions (Abhasa, Vyuha) as of \"fire from fire\" from subtle to gross; doctrine of Sakti: pure and impure creation; the denial of uncon-scious Maya, such as Samkara teachers; doctrine of Maya Kosa and the Kancukas (the six Saiva Kancukas being, as Dr. Schrader says, represented by the possibly earlier classification in the Pancaratra of the three Samkocas); the carrying of the origin of things up and beyond Purusa-Prakrti, the Samkhyan Gunas, and evolution of Tatt-vas as applied to the doctrine of Sakti; affirmation of the reality of the Universe; emphasis on devotion (Bhakti); provision for all castes and both sexes. \"Instances of common practice are for example Mantra, Bija, Yantra, Mudra, Nyasa, Bhutasuddhi, Kundaliniyoga, construction and consecration of temples and images (Kriya), religious and social observances (Carya) such as Ahnika, Varnasrama Dharma, Utsava; and practical magic (Mayayoga).

Characteristic Features of Krama as a Tantric System Thus it is evident that the Krama as a tantric system, rests upon intuition and discourages dialectic. In doing so it approximates to some modern tendencies of the Western philo-sophy. The tantric character seeks its fulfilment in the harmo-nious reconcilement of intuition with practical realization. It is why, by the fourfold divisions of tantric subject matter (Jnana, Yoga, Kriya, Carya) Jnana is linked up with Kriya and Carya through Yoga. It also explains the reason behind acclaiming the Malini Tantra as the chief source of inspiration, because it struck a balance between speculation and practice3 Likewise,"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"42   The Krama Tantricism of Kashmir synthesis of Bhoga and Moksa - the sine qua non of the tantric philosophy is the tantric rendering of harmony between know-ledge and action. The key objective of the Tantraloka is to expound this theme through an exposition of the four upayas that are the tantric adaptations of the various systems under the Trika.1 This synthesis is achieved by leading intuition, according to the tantra, into higher and higher possibilities by means of Sadhana i.e., practice, whose result is the gradual unfolding of the spirit's latent potencies. Thus philosophy of the tantra is a practical philosophy which, according to an eminent Indian author, \"not merely 'argues' but 'experi-ments'.\"2 4. Two Phases of the Krama-Tantricism In the earlier phase which comes to a close with Ksema-raja or Varadaraja, the Krama system was marked by a definite-proclivity towards philosophical and intuitional issues. In tantric phraseology the aspects Jnana and Yoga remained superior to those of Carya and Kriya. It is in fact its main plank against the Kula and Siddhanta doctrines as subsequent study would reveal. But later on the emphasis was reversed and the ritualistic aspect came on the threshold. Mysticism and metaphysics were made to serve the interests of esotericism and ritualism. The tendency makes deeprooted strides as we drift close to Mahesvarananda and Sitikantha. Sometimes the author is so lost in esoteric jargon that it becomes a test for a modern student3 to carry on his perusal. However, the later phase 2. Sakti and Sakta, p. 03.

Similarly the Pitha, the spiritual seat, which attracted only passing references before, now comes to be eulogised as constituting the most vital element in the system.3 It is just an instance, Sitikantha's work, in particular abounds in such expressions. The above lines do not try to ascertain the exact number of spiritual seats (Pithas) according to the Krama system. But according to the material available, the indications are that they did not deviate much from these in the other traditions. In support we reproduce an ex-tract from the History of Dharmasastra, by P. V. Kane (Vol 5, Pt. 2, p. 1038, fn. No. 1673) which brings into open a comparative estimate of tantric thinking in regard to the Pithas. It reads: \"It appears that in some Tantra works five Pithas are named (accord-ing to H. P. Sastri's Cat. of Nepal Palm-leaf and selected paper MSS in the Nepal Durbar Library. Calcutta, 1905, p. LXXX) viz., Odiyana (in Orissa, says H.P. Sastri), Jala (in Jalandhar), Purna Matanga in Srisaila and Kamakhya in Assam...The Sadhanamala (Vol. II, pp. 453 and 455) mentions Uddipana, Purnagiri, Kamakhya and Sripitha. The Kulacudamanitantra (Tantrik Texts, Vol. IV, in 6th Patala, verses 3-7) refers to five Pithas viz., Uddiyana, Kamarupa, Kamakhya, Jalandhara and and Purnagiri (Vide also 3rd Patala, 59-"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"44   The Krama Tantricism of Kashmir 61).\" Also vide \"The first two are respectively identified with Kama-khya or Kamarupa (three miles from Gauhati) and modern Sylhet. The exact situation of the other two (Kamakhya and Kamarupa are identical according to others) is a controversial matter. M M.H.P. Sastri identified Uddiyana with Orissa. His son Dr. B. Bhattacharya furnishes good ground for holding that Uddiyana was near Swat valley in N.W. India and Grousset In the footsteps of Buddha pp 109-110 holds the same view\" (ibid., pp. 1038-39). For the sake of relevancy it may be pointed out that Mahesvar-ananda does not treat Sripitha and Uddiyana as two separate pithas. Though Oddiyana is a subordinate pitha 'yet it ranks supreme in its effectiveness as spiritual seat. Sitikantha echoes the same view (vide, M.P.(S) pp. 2 and 50). It may be mentioned that the former belonged to Chola in Kerala, whereas the latter to Kashmir. The Cidgagana-Candrika, extols Purnapitha as the highest C.GC.4. 128). There is mention of another Pitha e.g., Uttarapitha which is identical with present Kashmir -Really speaking Krama is called Uttaramnaya because it arose in and spread out from Uttarapitha. This Pitha has escaped the notice of other Tantric works. There is still another view which tends to identify Kashmir, indeed by implication, with Oddiyana. On this view, which banks on Sivananda's statement in the Rjuvimarsini and has been quoted by Mahesvarananda (MM.P., p. 193), Tripura and Krama both the systems would originate from one place. However, the spokesman of this view would seem to take Uttarapitha and Uddiyana as one."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Krama as a Tantric System   45   The Krama subscribes to the general tantric belief that their philosophy was revealed through the Yoginis. This belief is a legacy of the earlier stages1 and has been retained even afterwards.2 Such a convention suits Krama more than any other system. Because, as we are likely to see, the first recipi-ents of the Krama wisdom were the female ascetics. Similarly, in one of mythical accounts of the system's origin, it is traced to Makaradevi. Even the famous twelve Kalikas are sometimes described as Yoginis.3 In this connection liberty may be taken for hazarding a suggestion that Mahesvarananda's story of divine inspiration from a female ascetic in a dream might be a left-over of this tradition. In the beginning the Krama system was intended to cater to the spiritual urges of all strata of human society and hence it envisaged a scheme of graded emancipation. But gradually, as the time passed, greater and greater secrecy came to shroud it and it did not, perhaps, allow common man the same easy access to it as he was accustomed to enjoy. It might be one of the factors, other than historical ones, that led the system to oblivion. Some statements amply testify to it.4 One of possible causes of such a tendency might be ascribed to the general tantric practice of total reliance on one's preceptorial lineage.

So much so that even the most characteristic theories of Vrnda Cakra etc are not traceable to Abhinava or to the Tantraloka. But gradually the importance of the Cakras like many other aspects grew and the system came to be designated as the Cakra-krama-sampradaya (school of the cyclic order),2 or the Navacakra-Sampradaya (school of the nine cycles).3 The Nava-cakras include the five functional cycles (i.e., Srsti, Sthiti etc.) three cycles of the optical trinity (Trinetra) i.e., Prakasa, Ananda and Murti and the Vrnda Cakra. Similarly another esoteric appellation of the system is found in the phrase \"Ady-"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Krama as a Tantric System    47    aksara Sampradaya\" (the school of the first letter).1 In fact the Akara (A) is deemed to be the most important part of the entire alphabet according to the esoteric symbolism. Akara, accordingly, is said to have four crests and represents the first stage of manifestation and assumes the cosmic dimensions.2 It is, however, gratifying to note that the Krama system, though in later stages advocating3 the use of wine and woman etc., which constitute the Pancatattva of the tantras, does not preach licentiousness. And a comparatively rarer reference has been made to this aspect. The Krama authors had to subscribe to it, because they aimed at complete self-control demonstrated not only through abstinence from but also through participation in the objects of enjoyments. But the fact remains that Abhinava does not take cognizance of these things in his presentation of the Samviccakra and dwells on the spiritual bearing of the same through an analysis of epistemic experience. In contrast, Sivananda II is prone to incorporate the wine etc. in the context of Samvic-cakra (anakhya cakra) marking out a diversion of emphasis from spiritual inquiry to mystic experimentalism. But even here this form of worship was pre-scribed only at a very advanced stage of spiritual development when the things that usually lure one away could create no mental digression. 5.

Experience (Samvit) and Reality (Sat, being) are essentially one. Hence the method preferred is not to bifurcate reality owing to the limitations of the dialectic and logic in comprehending the whole of reality, but to experience i.e., intuitively realize, the self (sat, being). Thus 'being' spells the content of 'experience' and 'experience' defines the nature and method of 'being'. In the typical Trika phraseology it is described as realization of Prakasa through Vimarsa. In still other words self-realization is nothing but the realization of Prakasa as being involved in the very nature of Vimarsa. Precisely the unity of the self and the Supreme Self  is arrived at through unity of the being (Prakasa, Sat) and its inherent possibilities of becom-ing (Vimarsa, Sakti)  This is the logic behind the most cherished method enjoined in terms of discovering the essential identity between the agenthood of the empirical sub-ject and that of the Absolute (Pancaknya-parisilana). Hence the experience of self is not a simple act of knowing but a complex one of re-knowing (Pratyabhijna). Since logic fails us in our hopes of attaining our alogical character, the intuitive realization turns out to be a process of mystic experiencing. It is why the mystic side of our self-expe-rience has been so ardently embarked upon.1 Moreover, in the nature of things, a priori awareness leading us to the intrinsic self-experience is bound to be mystical both in and out.

It is only when the true significance of intuitive realization is lost sight of due to deficient and hastily inculcated spiritual vision of the aspirant, the esotericism becomes the rule of the day, the method and means replacing and discarding their very ideal.1 A close study of the Tantras will demonstrate, why the Tantras give prefer-ence to what is called the inner worship (Antaryaga)2 and to pure reflection (Bhavana), which in the Krama system synchro-nizes with the highest level of Sattarka, the principle of Right Logic. And the various rites in Krama worship will be found, as will be seen later, conducive to such a realization on the graduated scale.3 This may be the only rationally possible implication of the process of the refinement of determinate ideality (Vikalpa-Samskara), in the context of the tantric sub-structure of the system. Even the tantric worship aims at harmonizing the deity whom one worships and the macrocosm over which she presides.

Nature and Scope of the Proposed Enquiry Here we intend to concentrate upon an examination of the nature and extent of the influence exercised by the other systems of thought on the Krama system and vice versa with special reference to the specific trends evinced by Krama, naturally excluding those ideas that subscribe to the general build-up of all the tantric systems. Thus, the admission of the Samkhya scheme of tattvas to the thirty-six-category scheme of all the Saiva and Sakta tantric systems and the tantric transforma-tion of the Sadrsa-parinamavada doctrine into the theory of Abhasa-vada etc are ruled out from the present treatment; Similarly an analysis of the doctrinal Krama attitude towards the Veda and Vedic systems and their comparative validity is also excluded since it has been dealt with on a subsequent occasion.1 The sole and ultimate purpose of the present treat-ment is to pick up and point out the source of influences that directly or indirectly inspired particular doctrines or esoteric tendencies in the system without attempting a comparative estimate of the various systems as such. 2. Krama versus Spanda with Regard to the Concepts of Reality and Fourfold Absolutic Functionalism Let us begin with a glance at the immediate surroundings of the Krama system. The attention has already been invited to the fact that Krama was a Saiva system with basically Sakta 1. Cf. Pt. II, Ch. 1."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"52   The Krama Tantricism of Kashmir leanings. It becomes evident from the Krama accent on Sakti, the dynamic aspect of the Male Polarity i.e., the Lord. The word Spanda (from Spadi - to throb, the palpitate, to move slightly) is an exact counterpart in Samskrta of the word 'dynamism' in English. The two commentators on the Spanda- Karikas, namely, Utpala-Vaisnava and Ksemaraja, are the first authors to discover the close correlation between the two systems with regard to their two particular theses. While explaining the first Karika1 in his Nimaya Ksemaraja takes the phrase \"Svasakti-cakravibhava-prabhavam\" as repre-senting the Krama or Mahartha ideal of the fivefold Abso-lutic functioning occasioned through the agency of the deities headed by Srsti Kali etc.2 He further endorses his thesis by observing that the highest Mahartha ideal is contained in the first and the last Karika of the Spanda-Karikta.3 The essence of the Spanda doctrine is best represented in the Mahartha concept of the supreme reality that consists in realis-ing the self as \"power-ful\" (Saktiman) through unearthing real nature of his \"powers\" (Sakti) by way of five acts. This view is reiterated in his Vimarsini4 on the Siva-Sutra l.6.5 Our other author Utpala Vaisnava, who is more thorough-going a Spanda-vadin, suggests in his commentary on the forty-fourth"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"Mutual Exchange with Philosophical and Tantric Systems 53 Karika1 that this Karika embodies the essence of Krama teaching that one develops a state of continuous realization of the principle of Spanda through one's recourse to various methods of self-reflection.2 And on the forty-second Karika3 he makes it absolutely certain that the Spanda concepts of Bindu, Nada, Rupa and Rasa are the exact Spanda corres-pondents of the four functions of the Absolute in the Krama system.4 Now it is difficult to ascertain as to which of the either school is indebted to which, yet a few conclusions may tentative-ly be drawn. Despite the fact that both the schools are wedded to the doctrine of dynamic Absolutism, the Krama appears to pursue it with more vigour. Hence, the Spanda system might be indebted to the Krama system for these ideas. Reasons for hazarding such a guess are as under :-(i) Krama, being the earliest monistic Saiva System of Kashmir, is earlier than Spanda also. (ii) The supremacy of the Absolute vis-a-vis the same of the Absolutic Dynamism i.e., Sakti or Kali, is a matter of controversy in view of the fundamental role assumed by the latter in the Krama system, whereas the ultimacy of the Absolute has never been questioned in the Spanda with all its accent on the dynamic aspect i.e., Spanda, that is Sakti.

(iv) The fortysecond and fortyfourth Karikas have not been accorded with the Krama interpretation by Ksemaraja unlike Utpala Vaisnava indicating the same as in (iii) above. (v) Yet, both the sub-schools of the Spanda system - the one headed by Ksemaraja and the other by Utpala -recognize the element of the Krama theses as latent in the Spanda dicta. 3. Krama and Kula: Bilateral Process of Influence Coming to the Kula system one finds that the process of influence has gone on a bilateral scale. It has been noted earlier that the Krama system, under the spell of its maintain-ing a parity between affirmation and negation both, adopts a completely indifferent attitude towards rituals like phallus-worship, the putting on of the matted hair and sacred ashes on the body, observance of religious vows, worship of deities, and the spiritual efficacy of Ksetra (station) as well as Pithas1 (seat). Such an attitude comes in sharp contrast to that of the Siddhanta and Kula systems with their enjoining and prohibiting these respectively. However, with regard to the phenomenon of Pitha etc. Kula does not prohibit but advocates them, while they stand negated by the Mata system. Likewise, while Kula pres-cribes Samayacara2 and worship of Ovallis, Mudra, Chumma etc., the Mata Sastra prohibits the same. And Krama, as usual, does not bother itself.3 But this equilibrium of mind and posture 2. The discrimination between what one ought to do and what one ought not is the essence of the Samayacara— 3. T. A.4. 258-269."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Mutual Exchange with Philosophical and Tantric Systems 55 of neutrality is not maintained for long. The Pitha, rituals, Ovallis, Ghara, Pallis etc. are injected into the system under the Kula influence and we come to know of a few Ovallis at least, namely, Mahananda1 and Kularani2 in the Krama. Similarly the line of teachers under Kula system including Yuganathas and Rajaputras, which initially did not find favour with Krama, later became acceptable inasmuch as their worship was advocated in Sthiti-cakra. This question has been discussed at its proper place subsequently.3 Even in later history we do hear a few discordant notes,4 but once an influence has interpo-lated itself it is difficult to pull it out. These later developments took place in the wake of the Kula system, because there came a stage when the Kula was thought to be superior to the Krama system One has already seen that Abhinava himself elevates the Kula-prakriya as compared with the Tantra-Prakriya.5 The process was logically extended to the point when Kula came to be acknowledged as constituting the crowning point of the Krama ideology6 and even the Krama works were referred to as the Kula texts.7 A natural outcome of such a tendency was that the Krama authors were gradually led to imbibe and import all those Kula theses that could be fitted in the Krama plan. 3.

M.P.(S)., pp. 107-108."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"56   The Krama Tantricism of Kashmir But at the same time, the Kula system also could not remain immune from the impact coming from the opposite direction i.e., Krama. The most important exchange took place with regard to the theory of the twelve Kalis or Samviddevis constituting the power-cycle (Sakti-cakra).1 This process did not remain confined to the Kula system alone but infected other systems as well, the Sara system in particular.2 As a natural corollary, the Anakhya-krama forced its way into the Kula fold.3 4. Krama and Tripura: Reciprocal Impact The other cognate creed that seems to have shaped and inspired quite a few theses of Krama is the Tripura system in spite of its not being a Saiva ideology. Krama owing to its temperamental attachment to the Sakti is rather soft to Tripura, a Sakta system. Sitikantha is most alive to this influence when he defines the scope of Mahartha as ranging from the Pitha (Spiritual seat) to the Samayavidya i.e., Tripura philosophy.4 But for its Saiva associations, Krama is certainly a Sakta system. He says that the Samaya-vidya is one because it marks the summit of all Krama achievement and the total variety of the Kramas is finally reposed here.5 Hence he describes Anakhya and Bhasa as Anakhya-Samayesvari and Bhasa-Sama-yesvari.6 Similarly, Vrnda-cakra, which according to Mahe-svarananda is the most important single aspect of the Krama 5.

There is some evidence to show that the con-cept of Vrnda-cakra was not completely unknown to the Tripura authors. The anonymous commentary on the Kama-kalavilasa (Kashmir edition) of Punyananda refers to two types of Vrnda-cakra viz., Pada-viksepa and Kramodaya.3 The former represents the Absolutic capacity for infinite possibilities of self-becoming and the latter with the traditional history. It is our impression that while Sri-cakra may be held responsible for the very inspiration of Vrnda-cakra, the notion of Vrnda-cakra is an export from the Krama into Tripura. Because in early stages we do not have any record of Vrnda in Krama, Vrnda being a later development. But on the other hand, Sri-cakra starts from the initial stages of the Tripura history. Tri-pura, the highest ideal of the Tripura system, is sought to be identified with Kala-Samkarsini4 - the Ultimate in Krama. As has been said earlier, Jayaratha leaves no doubt about the Tripura's identity with the Kula system.5 If such contention be accepted without reservation, the Kula and, for that matter, the Tripura might be said to have exercised tremendous influ-ence on the Krama. But Tripura has received also in return."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"58   The Krama Tantricism of Kashmir Anakhya, the fourth act of the Absolute - and also Reality as such according to the four-function theory1 (Krama-catuska) of the Krama system -, is probably borrowed from the latter.2 Jayaratha also suggests that Krama advocated Srsti-cakra and Samhara-cakra as independent from each other. Tripura borrowed and employed this doctrine with regard to the other theories of the system. For instance, the eighth and ninth cakras in Tripura are also independent cakras.3 This phenome-non is equally discernible in certain other spheres as well. The concept of Sattarka (Right Logic) for instance, seems to have been borrowed by the Tripura system from the Krama despite the fact that at both the places it is brought forth as an agamic notion.4 Likewise, the unusual fondness of Krama for Prakrta languages is a legacy from Tripura. Mahesvarananda's citing a statement from Rjuvimarsini, a Tripura text, in support of Krama's explicit preference for Prakrta would probably evince the veracity of this statement. 5. Impact of Buddhist Tantricism on Krama: Sadanga-yoga, Anakhya and some other Minor Doctrines The introduction of the Sadanga-yoga (six-limbed yoga) in place of Patanjali's Astanga (eightfold) Yoga marks a 4. Cf. Pt. II, Ch. 1."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"Mutual Exchange with Philosophical and Tantric Systems 59 curious departure from the general trend in the history of the Krama thought and has evaded a satisfactory answer so far. Because each of the monistic Saiva doctrines of Kashmir abides by the Patanjala discipline of the eightfold path. Even Abhinava-gupta, who is interpreted by Jayaratha as subscribing to the theory of Sadanga-yoga, does not, in fact, expressly commit himself to the said thesis From a close study of him it will be found that he actually dwells on the eightfold yogic discipline. This incongruity is deliberate and is explained by Jayaratha in terms of Abhinava's underlying motive. According to Jayaratha, Abhinava wants to suggest that the number of parts as eight of the Yoga is, in any case, final and cannot be enhanced further.1 Abhinava actually supplants Sattarka for the highest stage of the Krama process of Yoga and castigates the first five items as futile by virtue of their being external and adventitious in character. It is Jayaratha who cites a verse in order to describe the six-limbed doctrine from an unnamed source.2 The extract in question eliminates the first three parts namely, Yama, Niyama and Asana, from the original eightfold scheme3 and adds Tarka or Sattarka, thus bringing the total to six. It is queer that he nowhere attempts to define the six members of the scheme individually, instead all the definitions are drawn verbatim from the Toga Sutras of Patanjali. In such circumstan-ces one is prone to believe that the doctrine of six-limbed Yoga was an interpolation which may possibly be traced to the Tant ric Buddhism.4 In the Sri-guhya-samajatantra (Ch. xvIII) the 4. J. Ensink however differs from the present author. He does not think the doctrine of Sadanga Yoga to be an off-shoot of Tantric Buddhism, instead it may be traced to some older tradition to which the Javano-Balinese literature is also indebted.

Except the additional aspect i.e., Tarka or Anusmrti, in their respective presentations there is virtually no difference. And one may even be tempted to go so far as to say that Jaya-ratha has borrowed verbatim from the Guhya-samaja only sub-stituting the phrase \"Tarkascaiva\" for Anusmrtih\".4 The possibility of the Guhya-samaja being indebted to Krama is very slender, because (i) the Guhya-samaja, according to its editor, B.

The only doubtful line that demarcates the two schools is the place of Sattarka and Anusmrti in their respective schemes. In the verse cited above Jayaratha follows the original order of the Guhya-samaja which places Anusmrti just before Samadhi. In this way Tarka should also precede Samadhi. But from a critical perusal of Jayaratha, it will be discovered that Jayaratha and Abhinava both regard Tarka1 as the best and highest part of Yoga and treat all other parts as subordinate to Sattarka, which alone is the direct means of self-realization. The other difference of detail consists in the concepts of Anusmrti2 and Sattarka.3 Anusmrti is the remembrance of the realisation of previous stages, while Tarka is the pure knowledge that can discern the spiritually meaningful from what is spiritually spurious.

Refinement of determinacy (Vikalpa-Samskara), for example, evinces considerable impact of the Buddhist law of contradiction (Apohana) and theory of instantaneous being (Ksanikavada). This question has been considered in the sequel separately.1 The enormous influence exercised by Buddhism is also evinced by the Krama doctrine of Anakhya. The term Anakhya standing for a coveted stage of self-accomplishment, is possibly a positive Krama interpretation of the wholesale nihilism (Sunyata-vada) of the Madhyamikas.2 In fact, the twin notions of Sunyata are mutually different owing to their posi-tive and negative character respectively. But what is important here, is to note the inspirational value of the Sunyata-doctrine in so far as the concept of Anakhya is concerned. The ultimate reality being free from temporal and spatial affiliations is beyond the reach of words and, hence, is inscrutable. This is the precise implication of word Anakhya.3 The Sunyata-doctrine, which is based on the original Buddhist maxim i.e., \"all is void\" (Sarvam Sunyam), was not adopted from the Mahayanic philosophers direct but through the esoteric Buddhists who tried to give it a positive accent instead of its all-devouring nihilistic thesis pleading the essencelessness and sheer absurdity of the universe of our discourse. Thus, of the four gradations in the Sunyata doctrine suggested by Nagarjuna in his Panca-krama the final one viz., Sarva-sunya, is identified with supreme omniscience.

Sivopadhyaya, in fact, has noted this difference.3 6. Bhartrhari's Impact on Krama Yet another single source that must be credited with supplying the bulk of the sub-structural material of the Krama system is met in Bhartrhari. His is the unique contribution. Because, the basic pattern of the process of the Vikalpa-sams-kara has been largely determined by that of his Sabda-samskara and Sabda-purva-yoga.

Kashmir Saivism and Pancaratra : Certain Unsettled Issues Let us advert to a slightly different issue. We know of one more agamic system, that is, the Pancaratra system. It is yet one of the big question marks of the history of Indian thought as to what was the exact nexus between the Kashmir Saivism and the Pancaratra. We find Pancaratra bracketed with Buddhists etc. for the purpose of criticism in the Saiva works.2 They are assigned to the realm of Avyakta, i.e., Prakrti, in the Saiva scheme.3 Similarly the Pancaratra have been grouped into two classes e.g., Samkarsana Pancaratra and Samhita-Pancaratra.4 These references go to indicate that the Kashmir Saivism was fully familiar with the Pancaratra doctrine, - whatever be the cause of such familiarity. What is more remarkable is to find signs which suggest, though do not define, that some sort of relation and exchange did subsist between the two. In support, an appeal may be made to the extracts cited from the Panca-ratra works.

In the Pancaratra tradition the Rahasyamnaya is identified with the Ekayana-veda.4 According to Vedanta Desika the central theme of the Kasmir-agama-pramanya has been to expound and establish the impersonal origin of the Ekayana-veda.5 Pt. V. Krishnamacarya, the editor of the Adyar edition of the Laksmitantra, is of the view that the alleged extracts from the Pancaratra-Sruti and Panca-ratra-upanisad etc. in the Spanda-Pradipika by Utpala Vaisnava are most probably taken from the Ekayana-veda, that is, Rahasy-amnaya.6 It is unfortunate that the text of the Rahasyamnaya is now lost to us. It is very difficult to assert that the two Raha-syamnayas (one in the system and other in the Pancaratra) are one. Because the extracts ascribed to the Rahasyamnaya in the Saiva works are more of esoteric nature and the pattern suggest-ed is that of an agamic treatise. It is, therefore, fraught with serious obstacles to the precise relationship between the Kashmir Saivism and the Pancaratra.

Potential Richness of the Krama System The value of a philosophical system is determined by its capacity to divergent and manifold ways of reacting to the pre-sented data or stimuli. If a system, within its confines, can inspire many a mode of looking at the problems posed to or by it, without affecting its consistency adversely, its vitality and richness would require no further testimony. Judging on this criterion the Krama would emerge as a potentially creative and substantially rich system. The contention turns into a con-viction when a keen eye discovers not only the presence of different traditions but also the rise of a few sub-schools inside the Krama-fold. This enquiry, therefore, is directed to examin-ing the identity of such schools and nature of the differing traditions. In the Kashmir Saivism one encounters two texts namely, the Vatula-natha-sutrani and the Chumma-Sampradaya ascribed to two sub-schools, namely, the Sahasa-school and the Chumma-school. It may, however, be held that these two schools positively belong to the Krama system. Let us see how and why. 2. The Sahasa Sub-School With regard to the Vatula-natha-sutrani it is explicitly averred that its main theme is to propound that one's real nature is acquired by the firm stay in the pre-eminent Sahasa.1"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"68   The Krama Tantricism of Kashmir Hence, the commentator Ananta Saktipada styles the system as Maha-sahasa-carca-sampradaya (School dealing with the great Sahasa).1 In his enthusiasm to focus the attention on the individuality of the system he offers his benedictory salutation to the principle of Sahasa.2 Sahasa literally means an unexpected or forceful happen-ing. Therefore, from the Saivistic point of view, it stands for the highest state of inspiration or self-revelation which needs no preliminary preparation and which is said to take place often under the shadow of extremely intense bestowal of the divine grace. It transcends deterministic order and is a purely indeter-minate state of self-intuiting awareness.3 The notion of Sahasa as underlining the sudden and forceful self-realization has never been unknown to the Kashmir Saivism. The concepts of Hathapaka and Alamgrasa owe their being to the principle of Sahasa4 Likewise, it may also be noted that one of the eight approaches to the Vrnda-cakra is spelt by Mudra-krama which carries five Mudras under it to be discussed subsequently.5 Of these five Mudras, Khecari is deemed to be the highest and belongs to the realm of Sambhava-siddhas. All other Mudras are derived from Khecari, the For these concepts of. Pt. II, Ch. 5, \"The Place of Vrnda Cakra and Significance of the Hathapaka Process.\" 6. Cf. Pt.

In this school the Khecari Mudra has eight varieties, the highest going by the title of Vira-bhairava.4 This is on a par with the Khecari proper. The Vira-bhairava Mudra, which is nothing short of Khecari, con-sists in one's entry or entrenchment in the state, technically known as Sahasa. Hence it is also portrayed as Sahasa Mudra.5 The striking analogue between the Sahasa-mudra as an em-bodiment of Khecari of the Bhargasikha on the one hand, and the Sahasa-principle as incumbent upon the Khecara-doctrine of the Vatula-natha-sutra on the other, gives one further insight into the more antique beginnings of the concept that later bloomed in the form of a sub-system. The principle of Great Sahasa has always remained charged with the responsibility of sub-merging The phrase Maha-vismaya-Mudra in the 13th sutra of the Vatalanatha-sutra has been explained in the following manner -"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"70   The Krama Tantricism of Kashmir our total associations with the world of objectivity.1 This marks the climax of the Kramic ascent and, for that matter, the highest stage of the Kula achievement as well. It appears that the Sahasa school owed its origin to the internal motive of those who intended to emphasize the unique and irresistible vigour of the Sahasa method. Now Sahasa as Sunyata-samavesa, that is, immersion of the self in great vacuity, is no doubt a Krama phenomenon. Anantasaktipada is quite assertive on this point when he depicts the above viewpoint as the gist of the Mahanaya school.2 The other factor strengthening one's belief in the equation of Sahasa with Krama stems from the fact that the entire spiritual wealth of the book is attributed to Niskriyananda-natha who is avowedly a Krama author,3 as will be pointed out later. Moreover, the text employs the typical Krama idiom while describing the fivefold Absolutic functioning etc.4 In addition to its oral tradi-tion being traced back to the female monastic deities (Pitha-devis) who took some accomplished aspirant in their favour.6 This, too, is also a Krama characteristic. 3.

Nowhere in the text itself has an attempt been made to interpret the word. In the Tantraloka the word Chumma comes twice. At one place,1 it is used as a technical concept and is intended to suggest that Chummas and Mudras, like Palli and Ghara etc, change with the change of preceptor-ial line. In the other place he enumerates six Chummas2 with-out caring, in the least, for the nature and meaning of the word Chumma. From the nature of these, the Chummas probably mean the physiological centres of spirituality. A slightly clearer idea is furnished by Ksemaraja in his commentary on the Svac-chanda Tantra 3 He says, Chummaka is a technical name (Pari-bhasiki Samjna) and represents the system one belongs to.4 The main purport of the Chumma theory is to preserve the secretive and esoteric nature of the system and to present the same as well.5The word Sarma might be its synonym.6 The Chumma Quoted from the Kula-Kridavatara, T.A.V., XI, pp. 228-29. 6.

Needless to say that the work abounds in esoteric symbolism and hence the mysterious and secretive aspect of the system is well preserved. In this respect both the texts stand on the same footing. Yet, one can smell that the Chummas were reduced to two categories - secondary and ultimate. Although the attitude of the Chumma Sampradaya towards the secondary Chummas, which include the above Chummas of Abhinava and Ksema-raja, is not known, no doubt is left with regard to the primary Chumma which has been designated as the Paryanta Chumma. Now this is interesting to see that the notion of the ultimate Chumma has been explained in terms of Sahasa2 which is the continuous transcendental principle. 4. Sahasa and Chumma are Identical The equation of Sahasa and Paryanta-Chumma offers a strong ground for arriving at the identity of the Chumma with the Krama. Another phase of interest in respect of this equa-tion is their unflinching adherence to oral nature of their res-pective traditions. In pursuance to this tendency the Sahasa school is termed \"Vaktramnaya\" (oral revelation or tradition)3 and the Chumma-school is depicted as having been handed down exclusively through the medium of oral transmission.4 The hypothesis is further vindicated by the fact that the author-ship of the Chumma Sampradaya, too, is attributed to Niskriya-3.

This adds a touch of conclusiveness to the conclusions: that there is no basic difference between the concepts of Chumma and Sahasa, in their final analysis and shape; that both of the Sahasa and Chumma belong to the realm of Krama tantricism; and that Niskriyananda may be credited with elevating the ordinary notions of the system to the rank and status of a sub-system. But one must not forget that this process must have taken time and hence such a development seems to be a later phenomenon. Moreso, when we already know that the Chummas etc. were not so favourably viewed in the earlier phase of the Krama system. 5. Another Sub-School of Krama There is an oblique reference to another sub-school of the Krama in the 29th Ahnika of the Tantraloka. This school has not been named as such but is said to be a progeny of a mixture of the two theses, one propounded in the Derya-yamala and other in the Madhavakula, which by itself is a part of the Tantraraja-bhattaraka.2 In this school, spearheaded by a section of teachers, worship and adoration of one's preceptorial line along with Pitha, Ksetra etc. are not altogether vanished.3 In accordance with the thesis, the Pithas have been assigned to the different parts of the body,4 details of which bear no rele-vance to the problem in question. This mode of veneration pro-vides the aspirant to contemplate and, therefore, visualize the 1. Cf. Ch. 6. 4.

Because it simply depends upon how we interpret the word \"Matantara\" (Mata=view, ideology) em-ployed by Jayaratha in this connection.2 Since the entire 29th Ahnika deals with the Kula system,3 \"Matantara\" must mean something different from the main thesis under discussion. If 'Mata' stands for a view, it will mean \"a different view from the general choir of the Kula system\"; and if we take 'Mata' to convey the sense of an ideology, it will mean \"the different ideology\". In the first case, it is a simple deviation within the Kula system itself. In the second case, it is another system. If we are in for the second meaning, the only system that occupies the focus happens to be the Krama. For the reference to the concepts of Krama-catustaya4 and Kalasamkarsini5 does not require further explanation for our holding so. Of these the former concept belongs to the Madhavakula, while the latter to the Deviyamala. I. Ibid., 29. 64.

Divergent Traditions and Tendencies with Regard to the Specific Problems Coming back to the Krama system proper, we find the volume of controversies and differences of opinion on many a question does not appear to shrink instead swells up.1 The following lines will bear this out. (a) Two Traditions Regarding the Nature and Status of the Absolute and its Consequences There are two definite schools or traditions with reference to the nature and status of the Absolute. These tendencies seem to have their root in the Krama agamas from the beginning, as will be pointed out at the appropriate occasion, which resulted in two categories of agamas - Devi oriented and Siva-oriented. The scholars affiliated with Somananda and his spiritual des-cendants regarded Siva to be the ultimate reality.2 The rest differed and reckoned Kali or Devi to be the ultimate truth. The very term \"Kali-naya\" as an equivalent for the Krama-naya smacks of reaction on the part of those who revolted against Siva's supremacy. Somananda's obsession with the grammarian's convention reducing the feminine gender to be a particular form of the masculine was, to some extent, respons-ible for his opposition to the female personality of the Supreme Being. Reference to the female form anywhere, were the out-come of the intensive devotion of the devotee to the deity.3 On the basis of the material provided by Somananda and Utpala, it appears that a real confrontation took place between the two"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"76   The Krama Tantricism of Kashmir opposing protagonists.1 But such a difference of emphasis has more far-reaching implications than is generally recognised, because this is a Krama transformation of the general Saiva problem that calls for the evaluation of the precise relation bet-ween Prakasa and Vimarsa aspects of Reality. In this context Prakasa is called as Paramesvara, Manthana or Manthana-bhairava; and Sakti or Vimarsa as Kali, Devi or Kala-Samkar-sini. Consequently, those who declare Siva to be the ultimate, treat Kali or Sakti as His manifestation and hence relegate it (Sakti) as slightly subsidiary. In this case Bhasa and Anakhya in their respective domains come to be regarded as His func-tions. Vyomesvari or Vyoma-vamesvari, under Pancavaha (five flow doctrine) are also deduced from Him. In this connection it is amusing to watch the exponents of the ultimacy of the male aspect subscribing to the twelve-aspect theory (Dvadasa Kalis) under Samviccakra. Likewise, these schoolmen are also con-strained to prescribe only sixty-four aspects, excepting five vahas, under Vrnda Cakra. On the other hand, the other section of the scholars wedded to supremacy of the female aspect naturally deviates from the above premises. For them Sakti i.e., Absolutic dynamism, itself turns out to be the Dynamic Reality. It is the Absolute per se. In their case Siva is rendered some-what secondary to Devi or Kali. Bhasa or Anakhya, as the case may be, is identified with reality as such. Similarly, the supreme Vaha called Vyoma-vamesvari is not distinguished from Kali as such. Interestingly enough, again the members of this school subscribe to the thirteen-aspect theory (Trayodasa Kalis) under Anakhya cakra i.e., Samviccakra. The conse-quences may be multiplied. Instead of sixty-four they propound sixty-five mystic categories as constituting Vrnda-cakra. In fact, in such cases the ultimate reality is treated as forming part of the whole episode, whereas in the Siva-oriented doctrine the ultimate is treated separately. (b) These two traditions vis-a-vis Pentadic and Quartic tendencies with special reference to the absolutic functioning Sometimes, though not necessarily, a handsome distance"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"Different Traditions and Sub-Schools   77   is tried to be maintained between the two schools even with reference to the Absolutic functioning. Accordingly, the believ-ers in the ultimacy of Kali are thought to subscribe to the five-function theory, whereas the others, who believe in the abso-luteness of Siva, to the four-function one.1 But these are over-lappings and no uniform rule can be laid down in this regard. Although divergence of views on the nature and number of the Absolute's functions itself constitutes a very vital schism in the ranks of the system and accounts for several developments. This difference is vital in the sense that it has direct bearings on the meaning of the word Krama, as has been hinted earlier.2 This is in fact the original source of pentadic and quartic tendencies in general that have gone a long way in determining the general outlines of the system. It may be recalled that the entire Kashmir Saivism (monistic branch) subscribes to the theory of the five functions of the Absolute, but barring a tacit accept-ance a serious attempt has never been made to explore and study the philosophic and esoteric bearings of the theory. The two tendencies referred to above are the logical outcome of such an analysis, both conscious and sub-conscious, on the part of the Krama thinker. (c) Quartic Tendency Thus under the quartic tendency an attempt is made to present the system's basic concepts in terms of four or groups of four. In this case the fifth function (Anugraha or Bhasa) is subsumed under the fourth act (Tirodhana or Anakhya). In consequence, the fifth power (Cit) of the Absolute is again sub-sumed under the fourth one (Ananda). Factually, the fourth state marks the synthesis. As a natural upshot, the ultimate reality in this case comes to be designated as Anakhya and not Bhasa. Nevertheless, from the arrangement of the twelve Kalikas in the three groups of four each as presented by Jaya-ratha it appears that Abhinava too was inclined to favour the four-function theory.3 According to him, the four godly acts 1.

II, Ch.3."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"78   The Krama Tantricism of Kashmir Srsti, Sthiti, Samhara and Anakhya in relation to each of the subject, object and the means of knowledge respectively give us the twelve deities. Again under this scheme the functional cycles such as Srsti-cakra etc. number four and end with the Anakhya cakra. Likewise, a deeper significance is attached to the four cycles e.g., Pancavaha, Prakasa, Ananda and Murti.1 The biggest impact of the quartic tendency is seen in the theory of speech. Despite the efforts to introduce Suksma, as we shall subsequently see, to augment the number of the aspects of speech to five, the sizeable majority of the Krama thinkers has always sided with the theory of fourfold speech.2 (d) Pentadic Tendency Yet the pentadic tendency appears to have been a greater favourite of the Krama system in general The tendency is manifest in attempts to present the concepts of the systems in terms of five or groups of five notions. Thus the primary pentad goes by the name of Pancavaha representing the five flows of the self-emanative spiritual energy ranging from Vyoma-vame-svari to Bhucari. The functions of the Absolute which this section fervently expounds are five - Srsti, Sthiti, Pralaya, Anakhya and Bhasa. The Absolutic powers are also five - Cit, Ananda, Iccha, Jnana and Kriya. Mahesvarananda under the influence of this tendency adds Suksma to the fourfold division of speech maintained hitherto by the system. Now these run as - Para, Suksma, Pasyanti, Madhyama and Vaikhari. The esoterically and metaphysically symbolic groups, which are enjoined for contemplation, also number five - Sripitha, Panca-vaha, Netratraya, Vrnda Cakra and Gurupankti.3 Of these the Vrnda-cakra, which according to Mahesvarananda represents quintessence of the Krama thinking, contains 2. Vide Pt. II, Ch. 7, \"The Stages of Vak etc.\""},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"Different Traditions and Sub-Schools   79   many a pentad.1 The entire Vrnda Cakra centres round the five Siddhas and their numerous significations. These Sid-dhas are - Jnana, Mantra, Melapa, Sakta and Sambhava. Under the Vrnda-cakra the Dhama-krama lays down five dhamas as respective abodes of these Siddhas. They are - Kanda, Nabhi, Hrt, Kantha, and Bhrumadhya. In the same strain Mudra-Krama speaks of five Mudras i.e., Physical postures, - Kara-nkini, Krodhani, Bhairavi, Lelihana and Khecari. The concept of 'five letters' technically spoken of as Panca-pindas under Varna-krama too reflects the same tendency. Exactly on these lines the five cycles namely, Prakasa, Ananda, Murti, Panca-vaha and Vrnda go to erect the superstructure of Divyaugha.2 This pentadic tendency characterizes the efforts to identify even those groups, which admittedly consist of more than five ingredients, with the basic pentad termed Pancavaha. Thus Sripitha has nine constituents (Kala) - (1) primal subjective stir (Adya Spanda) (2) extrovert subjective tendency, (3) the stir of the means of perception, (4) the rise of tendency in the means of knowledge to apprehend determinately, and (5-9) awareness of the objective which is fivefold in accordance with the five elements (Bhutas). By ignoring the division of the objective into five elements this group of nine is rendered iden-tical with the five Vahas.3 (e) Dispute about the Exact Number of Parts of the Krama Toga The ideological antagonism has often touched other fron-tiers of the system as well. If one recapitulates what has been said about the Sadanga Yoga, it will be found that unanimity was wanting with regard to the precise number of the parts of"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"80   The Krama Tantricism of Kashmir the Yoga. Although Jayaratha mentions the theory of sixfold Yoga, he does not appear to take it very seriously. Abhinava himself feels more at home with the eightfold doctrine. A minor unpublished Krama text entitled Jnana-kriya-dvaya-sataka makes no pretentions about its abiding by the eightfold path.1 (f) Several minor controversies referred to These pages do not consider it advisable to dilate upon the minor controversies. In spite of their enormous magnitude and wide range, their treatment may be conveniently postponed for future consideration in their respective contexts. Such con-troversies in the main include e.g., exact number of divinities to be reflected upon in the Anakhya-cakra; serial order of the five functional cycles for the purpose of adoration; inclusion of Yuganathas and Rajaputras in the Krama system; precise serial order of the five flows (Pancavaha); equation of Prakasa, Ananda and Murti cakras with five flows; the serial order of Prakasa, Ananda and Murti cakras; concept of Puryastaka; precise number of aspects of the Vrnda cakra; Mudras and Mudra-krama of Vrnda-cakra; stages of speech, their nature and number. These problems are culled here with the sole desire to give the reader an idea of the extent these divergences reach out to. 7. Sources of the Quartic and Pentadic Tendencies The only question in this connection, that now remains to be considered, is to locate the probable cause of such a pentadic or quartic tendency. According to Pandey, this pentadic ten-dency is not the exclusive property of the Krama system alone. It has been anticipated by an earlier system of dualistic-cum-monistic Saivism which is known as Lakulisa Pasupata.2 In this case the pentadic tendency was aroused by the five Mantras of the Taittiriya Aranyaka, which provided the back-drop for the conception of the five aspects of Siva to be contemplated at the five stages on the path to final salvation. This trend was 2. Cf. Bhaskari, III, pp. CXII and CXXXIV."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"Different Traditions and Sub-Schools   81   maintained in the Gana-karika which summarises the whole system through the medium of eight pentads.1 However, the pentadic (or quartic) tendency of the Krama system seems to have been inspired by the quinary functionalism of Absolute. Even these five functions of the absolute owe their genesis to the five modes of Absolutic dynamism known as Kalana. The very basis of designating the ultimate reality as Kali is, in fact, supplied by its capacity to effect five types of kalana, namely, Ksepa (projection), Jnana (knowledge), Prasankhyana (determination), Gati (self-identification) and Nada (pure awareness).2 1.

He says it is only Kashmir which has the unique privilege of producing saffron filaments together with the poetic ingenuity.1 And, were one to add that Kashmir is equally the land of philosophical originality as it is a country of saffron flowers, he need not be afraid of being accused of exag-geration. The Krama system, with its long history and volumi-nous literature, only goes to exemplify the above statement. Jayaratha has not failed to take note of these twin peculiarities2 of Kashmir, the seat of the goddess of learning,3 with special"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"Sources and Literature    83    reference to Kashmir Saiva monism. Even the plan and design of the city of Srinagar has been patterned on that of the Sri Cakra, according to a tradition current even today.1 In this con-nection it is of special interest to remember, as has also been pointed out whenever the occasion so warranted, that of all the systems of monistic Saivism associated with Kashmir the Krama is the lone system that arose from the soil of Kashmir. We have repeated this again in view of its extreme significance. The name \"Auttara Krama\" is only an acknowledgment of the fact because Sivananda, who is the first preceptor of the system and hence is called 'the originator'2 (Avatarakanatha), is said to have received his spiritual lessons in Kashmir, the Uttarapitha.3 Jayaratha appears to have hinted at Sivananda's possible associa-tion with Kamarupa,4 renowned for its great tantric affiliations, when he is presented to have been blessed by Jaya etc. the deities. But this observation, as per its context, is not intended to explain his relation with the Krama system. Jayaratha, who is in fact reproducing the account as given in the Kramakeli of Abhinavagupta, is very categorical about the fact that the Krama secrets were revealed to him in Kashmir.5 The enormous 1.

It spread even as far as Cola-desa (modern Karnatak). Krama's association with various Pithas like Oddiyana,3 Puma Pitha4 etc., is a sign of its prevalence even beyond the boundaries of Kashmir. The correct geogra-phical identification of these pithas will no doubt add to certi-tude of our knowledge about Krama. 2. Origin and Early History The exact record of origin and initial phases of the system is clouded in the labyrinth of the mythical, mystical and sym-bolical accounts. The Krama practice of worshipping the pre-ceptorial line at the end of Vrnda-cakra5 has proved to be an asset in view of its supplying the traditional records of the historical data, if any. More so, the general tantric convention which makes it imperative for an author to begin his venture with homage to his teachers6 also helps one inculcate a rather coherent historical view. At the same time, this practice has also contributed to confusion and complicated the issues since such an account, for want of historical perspective and purport, leaves many gaps unfilled and many more questions un-answered. (a) Esoteric symbolism as part of the Krama History: Theory of Three Oghas But the tantric, and for the matter of that, the Kramic notion of history is drastically different from one we generally hold, because it makes esoteric symbolism as a part and parcel 3.

Krama, treading the current tantric line, arranges the entire course of history in three succeeding phases under the names of Divyaugha, Siddhaugha and Manavaugha standing for the traditions of the divine, the semi-divine or sacred, and the humans respectively.1 Among these the second occasionally and the third usually are historically relevant. These three may roughly be compared with the three phases namely, Sruti, Smrti and Purana of the orthodox account of history. The word Ogha, which forms the substantive part of the words denoting the three phases, means a community of those possessing similar character.2 By implication, the members displaying a common personality make-up have been classed accordingly under three groups. This is corroborated by another interpretation of the word 'Ogha' in terms of creation.3 Accord-ingly, the three, terms e.g., Divyaugha, Siddhaugha and Manavaugha, may be said to represent the orders of creation pertaining to the divine, to the accomplished and to the humans respectively with special respect to the preceptorial line. (b) Various traditional accounts of the initial phase of the Krama System Besides occasionally conflicting versions among the various traditions, our only regret is that nowhere has a consistent account of three stages been maintained.

Mahesvarananda records yet another tradition of the Krama and suggests the coverage of all three stages by it. The first ever revelation is said to have proceeded from Bhairava, Parma Siva, who delivered it to Bhairavi, the Iccha Sakti.5 With the passage of time it was imparted to Sivananda and further through a series of teachers it was finally handed down to Mahesvarananda.6 It is strange that an author of his eminence"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"Sources and Literature   87   and acumen does not attempt to indicate the precise com-position of the three phases e.g., Divyaugha etc. Even on other occasions, particularly while discussing the lineage of his pre-ceptors (gurupankti), he merely reiterates, but does not add to, what he has already said except introducing Mangala Devi in place of Bhairavi or Iccha Sakti.1 Only at one place does he tell of his immediate preceptorial succession in the order e.g., Sivananda, Mahaprakasa and Mahesvarananda.2 This Siva-nanda is indeed different from one mentioned above as the first human recipient of the Krama dicta. His immediate ancestry appears to have been suggested in the benedictory verses of the Parimala commentary.3 Coming back to the original problem, we may systematize the above account by placing Bhairava, Bhairavi etc. under Divyaugha, and Sivananda etc. under Manavaugha. His taciternity leaves us in dark about his view of the Siddhaugha, although he talks of those elements in different contexts that go to constitute the Siddhaugha according to other authors. Thus for instance, Abhinava in his Tantraloka refers to a tradition of the Siddhas (Siddha-santati) beginning with Khagendra and ending with Mina,4 which has been adored by Mahesvarananda in the Sthiti-Krama.5 This view of reckon-ing the four Yuganathas comprising the Siddha tradition (Siddhaugha) also seems to have been endorsed by the Maha-naya-Prakasa6 which, we shall see, is a work of Sivananda II, 6.

But the Siddhaugha of this type is not approved by the other stalwarts of the system notably Abhinava and Sitikantha. Abhinava does not regard the Siddha-santati as essentially a Krama phenomenon, because prescribing or denying such a tradition is not in conformity with the Krama tendency of absolute monism.1 He, however, makes it absolutely clear elsewhere that the Siddha-tradition at issue is exclusively a Kula phenomenon.2 Sitikantha, too, is vocal about it and vehemently opposes it. He positively holds that such a tradition (ayatikrama) is an imposition of an exotic doctrine on the Krama.3 He rejects even the slightest occasion for such a thesis in the system and holds that the four Siddha-groups represented by Jnana, Mantra, Melapa and Sakta under the Vrnda-cakra would, of necessity, supply the basic content and material of the Sthitikrama.4 Since these are esoteric notions and symbolize the mystic concepts, the Siddhaugha loses most of its historical value.

The professed identity between the triad of cycles comprising Ananda, Murti and Prakasa and Divyaugha is a pointer in this direction.3 In fact, Sitikantha talks of five Oghas (traditions)4 namely, Para-ugha, Divyaugha, Mahaugha, Siddhaugha and Manavaugha, but the first three can be conveniently subsumed under Divya-ugha. Hence the primary classification of the three Oghas is not disturbed. Adverting to Siddhaugha we find that it begins with Makaradevi.5 The rest has already been seen in the pre-ceding paragraph. The only thing of dubious historical signific-ance is a reference to some Jnananetranatha who is said to have directly inherited the spiritual fortune from Mangala or Makara-devi.6 A reference has also been made to some Sri-natha.7 The similarity of context tends heavily in favour of identi-fying the two, though it is also a case of doubtful equation. However, this equation cannot be dismissed as wholly unfound-ed because Sivananda, the author of the other Mahanaya-Prakasa, too, makes an explicit reference to one Antarnetranatha who seems to have unravelled the mystery of the highest Pitha.8"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"90   The Krama Tantricism of Kashmir For, there is no basic difference in the meaning of the Jnana-netra or Antarnetra and twisting of names without interfering with their meaning is not uncommon among Sanskrit authors, their identity cannot be brushed aside without proper scrutiny. It appears that, in spite of their probable historicity, these Nathas (or Natha, to be more exact) were assigned to Siddhau-gha which is succeeded by Manavaugha in chronological order. The Manavaugha or human phase is traced to some Hrasvanatha and is terminated with Cakrabhanu.1 The Mana-vaugha has a further sub-division i.e., Sisyaugha2 (lineage of the disciples), which starts with Cakrabhanu and closes with Sitikantha.3 Now this Manavaugha or human phase has imme-diate bearings on the historical character of the Krama system. The exact significance will be examined at the proper occasion in the sequal but it may not escape our notice that Sitikantha's presentation, though by far the most comprehensive, is by all means incomplete and sketchy. (c) Consistent account of the early history of the system One must feel grateful to Jayaratha who, though citing from the Kramakeli, has preserved to us the account of early history of the system.4 It goes to his credit that his is the first rational and consistent effort to supply the links left missing in the cryptic statements of the authors including Mahesvara-nanda. The Kramakeli acknowledges the earliest preceptorial status of Sivananda having received his lessons in the Uttara-pitha. The close affinity between the Kramakeli's and the Mahanaya-Prakasa's accounts forces us not to unduly distinguish Sivananda from Srinatha, although it has nowhere been so explicitly asserted. Sivananda handed over the spiritual wealth to three of his female disciples namely, Keyuravati, Madanika 3. Ibid., p. 107. i. Vide. T.A.V., III, pp. 192-93."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"Sources and Literature    91    and Kalyanika. Next in the line are Govindaraja, Bhanuka and Eraka to whom were revealed the Krama secrets by these female ascetics simultaneously. The first two e.g., Govindaraja and Bhanuka, marked the beginning of the two different tradi-tions of the Krama scholars. Somananda was connected with Govindaraja who trasmitted the creed of Krama to the former, and Bhanuka headed the other tradition to which later belonged Ujjata and Udbhata. The latter tradition came down intact to Jayaratha. The third, Eraka, did not bother about forming a school of his own, instead he thought it better to propound the system all alone. Thus, it may be noted that Sivananda's position as the first preceptor of the system is in no way compromised. But a quotation from the Devi-pancasatika, again our thanks go to Jayaratha, alludes to three precursors of Sivananda along with their spouses as under:1 Niskriyananda — Jnanadipti, Vidyananda — Rakta, Saktyananda — Mahananda, and Sivananda — Samaya.2 2. Jayaratha suggests that this Krama tradition has a stamp of conclusive-ness about it. He, in his prefatory remark on T.A. 29.43, raises a question as to why other teachers such as those mentioned in the Devipancasatika are not referred to here in the 'present' context (because these teachers are different from those that are being alluded to presently). Here the present context means the Kula system Jayaratha's explanation bints at the impossibility of explicitly mention-ing the teachers that have nothing to do with Kula. These teachers enjoy a detailed treatment in the Kali-kula, but they need not be worshipped instead, remembered only in the Kula context for the simple reason that these do not come under the purview of the Kula system. The word (see the preceding note) is very pregnant and"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"92   The Krama Tantricism of Kashmir In the interest of logicality, if one could establish the identity of the present Sivananda with one recognised as the inventor of the system, one will have adequate ground to believe that Krama had earlier beginnings. Two strong considerations lend their weight to the surmise that these two are one. First, the Devipancasatika is a recognised textual authority on Krama as the following pages would reveal. And secondly, Ananta-sakti-pada, a commentator on a later Krama text 'Vatulanatha Sutra\",1 and Sivopadhyaya, the learned author of the Uddyota comment-ary on the Vijnanabhairava,2 record the opinion of some Niskriya-nandanatha who is nowhere taken note of in the Kashmir Saiva texts even once except in the Devipancasatika. If this contention be true, Niskriyanandanatha should be recognized as the first thinker of the Krama system. If he is not so recog-nized in place of Sivananda, it is perhaps because he did not build up a system. The process of even greater antiquity of the system does not end here. Niskriyanandanatha is preceded by some Gandhamadana Siddha who took the former in his personal favour.3 Gandhamadana probably had a book4 which he showed to Niskriyananda and divulged its contents to him. Thus, historically Krama seeds were sown much earlier than one is apt to believe. One may also ascertain the approxi-mate historical status of these early thinkers. From the account furnished by Jayaratha, Sivananda was removed by two inter-vening generations (i.e., Keyuravati and Govindaraja) from Somananda, whose chronological position is almost certain. He is assigned towards the close of the ninth century. By assigning purposive. It meant that the Devipancasatika speaks of teachers other than those described above in the Kula context. Now Devipancasatika is a Krama text, hence the 'other' system than 'the present one' is bound to be the Krama. Hence Niskriyananda etc., are automatically related to the Krama system. Vide, T.A.V.

Gandhamadana, who is by four generations older to Sivananda, has to be assigned towards the beginning of the eighth or the last quarter of the seventh century. Ostensibly enough, the Krama system dates back fairly early. In a sense it is the earliest system amongst the monistic Saiva systems of Kashmir, because all other systems arose or emerged somewhere around the beginning of the ninth century. Such a hoary antiquity of the system is further established by collateral evidence. The Haravijaya of Ratnakara who is attributed to middle of ninth century by the scholars because he flourished during the reign of Avantivarman,1 eulogizes the ultimate deity as Samkarsini2 in course of offering prayers to Sakti. A student of the Krama philosophy is fully well aware of the implications of this term. It is a typical Krama method of naming the Absolute. The word Samkarsini and Kala-samkarsini have no semantic difference. They stand for the one and the same principle.3 This reference helps one recognize the basic issue that the Krama dicta began to gain currency fairly early.

Creative period of the Krama system - Rise and Decay (9-18th century) It may now be in the fitness of things to advert to the study of the creative phase of the Krama history which one encounters in the immediate succession. It is here that one finds himself face to face with remarkable scholars and out-standing personalities like Utpala, Laksmanagupta, Hrasvanatha, Siddhanatha, Pradyumna Bhatta, Utpala Vaisnava and Bhas-kara etc. This community of scholars is further joined by even the persons of the eminence of Abhinavagupta, Ksemaraja and Ramyadeva etc. Really speaking, once the creative stream starts flowing, its current does not lose its rigour till it comes to Devabhatta. But the force of the central current is again restor-ed after a brief pause in the personalities of Sivananda II, Jayaratha and Mahesvarananda. With Mahesvarananda one enters into the thirteenth century. These names form the galaxy of important Krama authors in addition to numberless those who have made humbler contributions. To this period belongs the illustrious tradition of Cakrabhanu, Hrasvanatha, Bhojaraja, Somaraja and Srivatsa who have made a hall-mark in the history of the Krama system by departing from the old rut and by making fresh contributions. It is the tradition which has escaped the certitude of historical accuracy for want of requisite material. From the historical point of view, the Krama history un-rolls a vast panorama that stretches from the 9th to the 18th century. There comes a lull after the 13th century and a vacuum obscures the creative arena, if any, from our sight. To be frank, a period of decadence looms large with the exit of Jayaratha and Mahesvarananda. And the vacuum is only partly and sporadically filled. Only two names, e.g., Sitikantha (1575-1625 A.D.) and Sivopadhyaya (1725-1775 A.D.) arrest our attention for their brilliant attempt to revive and preserve the system. To this period may be assigned Anantasaktipada, the commentator upon the Vatula-natha-sutrani, and the author of the Chumma-Sampradaya whose exact chronological status is not yet beyond doubt."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"Sources and Literature    95    The period ranging from the 9th to 12th century is most creative. The creative vitality is reflected not only by the number of authors and texts, but also the impact it made on the other systems. This period witnesses a big community of authors who not only share their greatness, but also enjoy blood-affili-ations; and consequently, we are in the midst of not only the rich preceptorial traditions but also family traditions. In the subsequent study we shall have sufficient opportunity to expa-tiate upon this contention. This period evinces a positive philoso-phical aptitude to be replaced by deep esoteric tendencies to-wards decaying finale of the system. A transitional compromise is easily perceptible among the authors flourishing towards the conclusion of the primary creative phases e.g., Mahesvara-nanda etc. The system did not degenerate overnight. The long process had started fairly early. By the close of the 12-13th century, the cracks start showing in the erstwhile cemented wall of the system. One can easily feel the pressure of surging winds in Jayaratha. His diatribe at his opponents is indicative of the fact that they had lost touch with the traditional secret of the system.1 But Jayaratha's criticism is so lively and retains its contemporary flavour to such an extent that by his time Krama continued to be a living force. Even a superficial perusal would convince one of this. Similarly Sivananda II, the author of the Mahanaya-prakasa, has castigated such people hinting at the growing ignorance of the system among the votaries of the system themselves.2 The tendency gradually turned into a fact.

He, at one place, bemoans the forgetful"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"96   The Krama Tantricism of Kashmir public memory.1 The Jnanakriyadvaya-sataka, a stotra of Krama leanings and much later origin, gives a very vivid and graphic description of degeneration of the noble tenets of the system at the hands of its followers. It is a lengthy caricature (verses 37-63) and indicates how they lost any sense of the ethical pro-portions, social decorum and spiritual values in pursuing their carnal, sensual and mercenary motives.2 4. Historical backdrop of these Phases If one reviews the Krama history against the general backdrop of the history of Kashmir, it would be clear to him that the period covering the creative phase of the Krama system is in fact reflective of the renaissance that overtook and enervat-ed every field of intellectual activity. This period has given us many classics in different branches of learning e.g., philosophy, poetics, religion and literature. The process of patronizing the intellectuals and creative geniuses that started with King Lalit-aditya (7th century) went unabated till the time of Jayasimha (1127-1149 A.D.) with a few exceptions. There was a great impotus for the composition of new and original works in Kashmir. Works on poetics practically commenced from the 8th century A.D. with Udbhata and Vamana. Works on the Trika system of philosophy began to be written about the same time and historical works also fall in the same period. The reasons for this are not far to seek. Firstly the literary glory and creative upsurge of Kashmir was at its peak during this period and was largely responsible for creating an intellectually fertile atmosphere in which nothing mean could ever aspire for recognition. Sociologically knowledge-seeking and intellectual activity were the values supremely cherished by the society and individuals alike. According to the social psychology deep-rooted 2. The stotra is still unpublished. See \"classified bibliography\" for particulars."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"Sources and Literature    97    values in the subconscious-mind of society act as a formative principle and impart a direction, depth and meaning to the cultural and creative adventures of the age. Knowledge-seeking became the cult of the then India, not to talk of Kashmir alone. Secondly, foreign emissaries like Hiuen-tsang and I-tsing visited India so that there was ample opportunity for exchange of ideas between the great nations like China, Persia, Greece and India. Thirdly, Kashmir Saivism emerged as a critique of the Vaibhasika and Yogacara schools of Buddhism and a construct-ive continuator of Bhartrhari's philosophy of language which had attained a high degree of intellectual advancement. Fourth-ly, the kings like Jayapida (779-813 A.D.) and Avantivarman (855-883 A.D.) were enlightened and generous and they kept the flame of learning ever kindled during their reign. A king's popularity and success were measured in terms of his respect for learning. Kalhana has stated that during his time king Jayapida, like his remote precursor Lalitaditya, invited scholars from all parts of India in large numbers. Of Avantivarman Kalhana says that during his reign Siddhas such as Bhatt Kallata were born for the benefit of the world.1 King Yasaskare who has won the laurels from Kalhana for his flawless admini-stration in maintaining the integrity of the housewives,2 was also a patron of many a scholar. He was a Seme contemporary of Abhinava (950-1020 A.D.). Vallabha, the grandfather of Kama who was Abhinava's favourite studen and Puma Mano-ratha, the first known ancestor of Jayaratha, were ministers of Yasaskara. Similarly in Sussala (1101-1197 A.D:) we meet a great patron of learning. Mankha has paid high tributes to him.3 Practically all the brothers of Mankha including himself"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"98   The Krama Tantricism of Kashmir were under the employment of Sussala. Mankha's elder brother Alamkara,1 who himself was a great patron of learning, was a high state official under Sussala. Ramyadeva and Losthala -both Krama authors, Ruyyaka - the famous poetician, and a host of others were regular members of Alamkara's literary club. Jaya Simha (1127-1155 A.D.), whose court poet was Kalhana, stepped into the shoes of his father and closely followed his foot-prints. Mankha has very high opinion about him.2 Jaya-ratha, ostensibly one of the most remarkable figures of the system, was a son of Srngararatha, the court-minister of Jaya-simha who has been probably referred to as Rajaraja.3 En-couragement from the rulers and a creatively lively academic environment made Kashmir a virtual seat of learning which bewitched scholars from every corner of the country.4 And consequently and rightly, too, an adage earned currency among the scholars that the real test of the scholarship lay in Kashmir. Particular mention may be made, in this connection, of the encouragement that was given to Sanskrit learning during the later part of this period (which has been called as the period of decadence) even by Muslim rulers such as King Zain-ul-Abidin (1420-1459 A.D.), Sultan Hasan Shah (1472-1484 A.D.) and Emperor Akbar. Zain-ul-Abidin made a history by pro-claiming a total ban on cow-slaughter by reducing ziziah to a 1. Kalhana refers to Alamkara in glowing terms :"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"Sources and Literature    99    nought. Hasan Shah was the patron of Sitikantha - author of the Mahanaya-prakasa, and Srivara Pandita - author of the later edition of the Raja-tarangini. All the three rulers ordered the translations of Sanskrit works into Persian and Arabic and vice versa, so that the exchange of ideas was mutual and not unilate-ral. But there was a great difference between the initial and final periods of the creative phase. These Muslim rulers of the final period, however, were not the rule but exceptions who gave a fillip and stimulus to Sanskrit learning in brilliant contrast to the wicked performance of the Muslim rulers in general who took it as a religious duty to destroy the culture of Kashmir; whereas in the initial period such rulers were excep-tion as were not generous, nor enlightened. This difference among the rulers speaks by itself of the difference between the two periods. The dazzling flame of classical Sanskrit tradition ultimately began to flicker and extinguish after the death of king Zain-ul-Abidin. The Hindu society in Kashmir began to disintegrate marking the decline of Sanskrit study. Persian language began to spread its influence. The place of Sanskrit was usurped by Kashmiri which was born afresh by a mixture of Persian and Sanskrit. Its magnificent examples are found in the pithy sayings of Lalla, Mahanaya-prakasa of Sitikantha and Chumma-Sampradaya. It is a pity that the land which was a living shrine of the goddess of learning succumbed to foreign influences and was forced to pass through a process of complete degeneration and total eclipse of its cultural identity. The process has been so thorough and its after-effects so severe that the Kashmiris today have yet to realize their real cultural identity. However the rich heritage that has flowed through blood among the Kashmirians down to the present day is visible in the comment-aries of Sivopadhyaya on the Vijnanabhairava, of Ratnakantha on the Stuti-Kusumanjali, and of Bhaskarakantha on the Isvara-pratyabhijna-vimarsini and in the Devinamavilasa of Sahib Kaul. The first and third works speak of the original calibre of their authors.

Chronological Position and Contribution of the Individual Authors As is logical, one may now proceed to determine the chronological status as well as examine the contribution of the Krama authors individually. Such an attempt will possibly facilitate better understanding of the system. The place of an author in the proposed treatment corresponds to his exact or approximate position in chronology. Cases of doubtful or unknown authorship have been treated along the same lines except agamic works to which a separate section has been devoted. (i) Vatulanatha (675-725 A.D.) Little is known about him. It is also difficult to say whether he belonged to the Siddha tradition (Siddhaugha) or the Human one (Manavaugha) although he is referred to as a 'Siddha'. If he is a historical personality he should be placed before Niskriyanandanatha whose period falls about 700-750 A.D., because the tradition (not the authorship) as presented in the Vatulanatha-Sutrani is traced to some Vatulanatha.1 The main thesis, according to him, is to negate duality and uphold unity of the various categories of spiritual experience i.e., the adorer, the adored and the adoration. He is the first exponent of the Sahasa school."},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"Sources and Literature    101    (ii) Gandhamadana (700-750 A.D.) He is known from a brief reference1 where he is repre-sented to have shown an unauthored (probably of divine origin or received traditionally) book to Niskriyananda while taking the latter into his personal favour. He is also said to be a Siddha i.e., the accomplished one. The text Vatula-natha-sutra is sup-posed to be a detailed exposition of these teachings. Coming before Niskriyananda he may be placed in the vicinity of the first two quarters of the eighth century. He also subscribed to the Sahasa branch of the Krama system. (iii) Niskriyandanatha (725-775 A.D.) During the hoary antiquity of the system Niskriyananda appears to be the most important author. He is the first among the four preceptorial dignities mentioned by the Pancasatika.2 He is mentioned alongwith his consort i.e., Jnanadipti. His importance becomes self-manifest the moment one finds at least two works ascribed to him. As has already been noted in our study of the Sahasa school, these works are the Chumma-Sam-pradaya3 and the Vatulanatha-Sutrani. It is to be noted that one does not meet such explicit declaration of his authorship of these two works. To be more precise and exact, he may be said to be the author of the Chumma-Sampradaya, whereas he transpires to be a recipient of the Sahasa doctrine from some Gandhamadana resulting in the form of the Vatulanatha-Sutrani.

He also seems to have written a commentary called \"Prakasa\" on it which is also in manuscript form.3 In this connection it is perhaps significant to remember that all these works as they are available today convey an impression of their being of much later date. This conclusion is derived from three facts viz., (i) these works are nowhere referred to in the earlier literature. Even Mahesvarananda and Jayaratha do not take any notice of them, (ii) the prevalence of Prakrta in the Chumma-Sampradaya and esoteric symbolism in the Vatulanatha-Sutrani are definitely later characteristics of the system; and (iii) the only other reference one gets after the Pancasatika is by Sivopadhyaya (18th century).

Generally he is acclaimed as the first systematic exponent of the school1 and for that reason is known as \"Avatarakanatha\"2 in the doctrinal circles. He, as has al-ready been pointed out, belongs to the opening era of the ninth century. This date is arrived at from basing our calculations on the dates of Somananda (875-925 A.D.) and Abhinavagupta (950-1000 AD.). He is removed by two generations from the former and by five from the latter. He hailed from Kashmir, the Uttarapitha, which was also the seat of his spiritual initia-tion.3 He also visited Kamarupa where he was taken into personal favour of the deities of the Jaya class.4 The circum-stances pertaining to his visit perhaps have a bearing on his relation, if any, with the Kula system. He had three female ascetics as his immediate pupils who bore the burden of pro-pounding the Krama dicta. They were known as Keyuravati, Madanika and Kalyanika respectively.5 In Jayaratha's time there raged a controversy with regard to the total number of Sivananda's actual disciples.

It is unfortunate that his views on various philosophical questions have not come down to us except on one question i.e., the number of Kalis to be worshipped in Anakhya-cakra. It appears there were two interpretations in tune with the doctrinal demands of his views. The tradition is interpreted by one group to mean that he advocated the number of Kalis to be thirteen and two verses are cited from him in support of their thesis.2 The other group headed by Jayaratha, instead, holds the number to be twelve which, he declares, has descended to him direct from Govindaraja and cites a verse to substantiate his contention.3 Jayaratha presents it as an uncontrovertible fact that the twelve goddesses alone were intended by the teacher-sage.4 Today it is difficult to objectively"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"106   The Krama Tantricism of Kashmir determine his precise views with regard to this or that issue.

It may also be taken to be implied that he subscribed to the thesis of four-function doctrine (Krama- catustaya). A student of the Krama history is familiar with one more Sivananda (generally referred to by us as Sivananda III, the grand teacher of Mahesvarananda, who belongs to a period as late as the twelfth century.

The tone of the citation also lends weight to the above hypothetical value at present. If such a contention has any force, it is probable that Sivananda wrote some work or works too. Earlier, in this very chapter, the identity of Sivananda with Srinatha, Antarnetranatha and Jnananetranatha has been suggested Here one would like to consider additional evidence which could not be adduced there for want of space and rele-vance. The immediate transmission of the Krama tenets by Mangala Devi to jnananetranatha2 in Sitikantha finds a close analogue in Sivananda's receiving the spiritual secrets from Mangala Devi in the Maharthamanjari.3 Moreover, Antarnetra-natha is the first preceptor ever to be mentioned in connection with the Northern Seat by the Mahanayaprakasa.4 This, again, 2.

About his per-sonal life we know nothing except that Samaya, according to the Pancasatika, was his spouse. (vii) Vasugupta (800-850 A.D.) Among the authors ascribed to this period the claim of Vasugupta must be considered, who is primarily a Trika as well as a Spanda author and is nowhere mentioned as the Krama author. But a close perusal of his Siva-Sutras as well as the Spanda-Karikas would reveal his contribution to the cause of the Krama system too. There are two schools with regard to the interpretation of the Siva-Sutras. Bhaskara repre-sents one school that explains it as embodying the Spanda doctrine and divides the work into three Prakaranas or Prakasas, In so doing he steps into the shoes of Kallata who got the Sivasutras in four divisions, the first three of which he explained by his Spanda-Karikas and the last one by a commentary called Tattvartha-cintamani.1 Bhaskara comments on the first three chapters only. Here in his interpretations his taciturnity regard-ing the Krama system does not permit one to form a definite view. But the other school represented by Ksemaraja and Varadaraja interprets the Sivasutras in the light of the Trika system or so to say, the Kashmir Saivism in general and divides the whole work into the three sections in accordance with the three Upayas. Thus the second section deals with Saktopaya which is the traditional way of presenting the Krama system.

Similarly Ksemaraja, who ascribes authorship of the Spanda-Karikas2 to Vasugupta, presents the basic theme of the Karikas as consisting in the enunciation of the Mahartha doctrine.3 We have also seen Utpala, the author of the Spanda-Pradipika, referring to the common features between the Spanda and Krama systems. Hence this study. The date of Vasugupta does not present much difficulty. We know Kallata was the direct disciple of Vasugupta. According to Kalhana,4 Kallata was a contemporary of king Avantivarman whose period of reign extends from 855 to 883 A.D. It is, therefore, reasonable to believe that Vasugupta, the teacher of Kallata, belonged to the preceding generation which might have been alive and active during the first half of the ninth century. Besides the two works alluded to above, the three other books ascribed to Vasugupta are the (i) Spandamrta,5 (ii) Vasavi Tika and (iii) Siddhantacandrika. The claim of the first work as an independent treatise is now rejected by the modern scholars.6 It is supposed to be identical with the Spanda-Karikas with difference in the title only, because the word Spandamrta seems to be more of a metaphorical expression. The Vasavi Tika is a commentary on the Bhagavadgita. A complete manuscript of it has not yet been discovered.

Ksemaraja, in his Spanda Sandoha, quotes two Siva-Sutras which are not traceable to the published text.3 Abhinavagupta also refers to one such Sutra in his Isvara-pratyabhijna-vivrti Vimarsini.4 It is possible that these Sutras belong to the fourth division of the Sivasutras which has not been commented upon by any author except Kallata who is depicted by Bhaskara to have written the Tattvartha Cintamani commentary on it.

These three were responsible for imparting the Krama tenets to Sri Govindaraja, Bhanuka and Eraka.3 Besides this, Jayaratha has preserved some more information about Keyuravati. The historical value of the information will be determined later while discussing Cakrabhanu. In addition to these three, namely, Govindaraja etc.4 she is said to have three other disciples as well whose names are not known.5 Yet the preceptorial traditions ensued from the latter three students. Hence they are depicted as 'Savamsas'. It is impossible to identify these people today. At another place also from Keyu-ravati down to the pupil of Cakrabhanu, sixteen generations of the Krama teachers are said to have flourished.6 But validity of such a view is somewhat dubious, because the intention of Jayaratha behind alluding to these views is to suggest the con-flicting nature of hearsays with regard to one and the same person or author and impossibility of construing any definite conclusion from such a scattered mass.

The only justification for considering him under Krama lies in his valued contribution to the Krama system through the Spanda-karika as well as his commentaries thereon. On the authority of Ksemaraja and Bhatta Utpala one comes to know the amount of the Krama wisdom as contained in the Spanda-karika. Abhinavagupta presents Kallata as indirectly propounding a Krama doctrine.1 Being a contemporary of king Avantivarman (855-883 A.D.) his date covers the second and third quarters of the ninth century. Kalhana calls him a great Siddha born for emanci-pating the suffering masses. Historically he occupies a unique position and from him ensue the two laudable traditions of the Spanda branch. One begins with Pradyumna Bhatta and is continued up to Bhaskara who is also a teacher of Abhinava-gupta, and the other starts with Mahabala and is carried up to Utpala Bhatta. Pradyumna Bhatta and Utpala Bhatta are famous for their contributions to Krama as well. Computing backwards from Abhinava (960-1020 A.D.) who is a student of Bhaskara, one arrives at exactly the same period, since five intervening generations have filled the gap from Kallata to Abhinavagupta. Kallata, apart from being a spiritual and religious per-sonality, was also a man of versatile genius and wide interests. Besides his numerous philosophical major and minor treatises he is credited with the composition of literary pieces as well. A few verses have come down to us through anthologies2 and some 2.

It is apparent from Abhinava's reference to him in a positively Kula context.2 It is difficult to say whether or not he wrote separate treatises on Kula and Krama. But he did ventilate his views regarding problems pertaining to these systems. Such wide erudition he could command due to his curi-osity and unextinguishable thirst for knowledge. He calls himself as \"a student of all\" and naturally he never suffered from dearth of people readily telling him everything. After the typical slang \"Every Tom, Dick and Harry\", we take it, he avers that his teachership ranged from Tapana to Motaka.3 Abhinavagupta quotes this verse in his Tantraloka with slight modification4 and admits the debt of Kallata without reservation in one respect. He (Abhinava) also flanked the doors of all sorts of teachers even in branches of learning inferior to his own, out of sheer curiosity and quest for knowledge. In this he was largely inspir-ed by Kallata's example.5 The salient factor behind Kallata's peerless renown con-sists in his controversial authorship of the Spanda-karikas.

In fact this is the heritage that they have received from Abhinava - his (Abhinava's) own statement testifies to it.3 Abhinava and Ksemaraja both seem to base their judgment on the authority of the following verse found in their recension as retained by Ksemaraja in his Spanda Nirnaya: Strangely enough, this verse is not found in the recension of Bhatta Utpala, author of the Spanda-pradipika, who ascribes its authorship to Kallata.

In the beginning of his Pradipika1 Utpala emphati-cally asserts his position that Vasugupta revealed the Spanda secrets to Kallata who wrote a compendium in fifty verses for the sake of easy understanding by his pupils. He, in this con-nection, also records a slight modification in the tradition in respect of the Siva-sutras to the effect that the Siva-sutras were revealed to Vasugupta by a Siddha and not by Siva himself as held by Ksemaraja etc.2 Bhatta Utpala is supported by a host of scholars including Bhaskara, the author of the Varttika on the Siva-sutras, and Ramakantha who wrote a Vrtti on the Spanda-karikas. According to Bhaskara, Kallata got from his teacher four divisions of the Siva-sutras on the first three of which he wrote his Spanda-karikas or Spanda-sutras, and on the last one a commentary called the Tattvarthacintamani.3 Probably the Spanda-karikas, intended to be a commentary on the first three divisions, was known as Madhu-vahini.4 Because both of them, according to Abhinava, are commentaries on the Siva Sutras and are mentioned by him in the order that conforms to Bhaskara's stand. Thus the following facts emerge from the above discus-sion Both the schools concurred that -Sp.P., Introductory verses.

And the two schools disagreed with regard to -(i) its authorship - an issue Vasugupta versus Kallata, (ii) origin of the Siva-sutras - Divine i.e., received from Siva, or Secular i.e., revealed by a Siddha, (iii) recension of the Spanda-karikas - mutual black-out of the verses pertaining to authorship and their number e g., fifty-one or fifty, in their respective re-censions, and (iv) divisions of the Siva-sutras - three or four. On the basis of the material produced above there should be no doubt that one does not have extant today the original text of the Spanda-karikas. What one has must be an edited text - rendered and modified by the schoolmen in order to cater to their doctrinal requisites. If one sets out to locate its cause, one has to make a study in the motives of these schoolmen before he can positively conclude anything. It has been frequently repeated that the Spanda system is nearest to the Krama for its unmistakable emphasis on the dynamic aspect of reality which technically passes under the name of Sakti or Spanda or Vimarsa. If this be granted, the Spanda-karika must propound a system that is Sakta in nature. It is why the Spanda-karika, despite the fact that it is a com-mentary on the Sivasutras, is considered to be the Bible of the Spanda system, whereas the Sivasutras are concerned with the Trika in general.

Be-cause that would mean leaving the Saiva system in the hands of the Saktas who, though kith and kin of the former, tread a different line. Hence Somananda and his fellow-travellers ac-cepted Vasugupta to be the author of the Spanda-karikas and accordingly modified their edition in so far as it threw what-ever feeble light on its authorship. Kallata, it appears, was the original author, for the simple reason that even before Soma-nanda his system happens to show a marked softness to Sakta tendencies. It was for this reason that his direct disciple falls a victim to the tirade launched by Somananda. Moreover Ksema-raja refers to Bhatta Lollata, who was a precursor of Abhinava and wrote a commentary on the Spanda-karikas and suggests that Lollata explained them in conformity with the gloss of Bhatta Kallata, whereas he (Ksemaraja) has not always done so.2 Even elsewhere Ksemaraja clearly professes to have taken an independent line.3 In this connection it is also to be noted, to which attention has been drawn earlier too, that Abhinava -the prolific master author - did not write anything on the Spanda-karikas4 in spite of his numerous reverential references to"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"118   The Krama Tantricism of Kashmir Kallata. This we know on the authority of Ksemaraja. The only logical and irresistible conclusion that follows in the wake of such strong evidence is to admit the original authorship of the Spanda-karikas as belonging to Kallata. Besides his Spanda-karika which is most probably identical with the Spanda-sutras mentioned by Bhaskara,1 which again is perhaps identical with his Madhuvahini, he wrote several other works. Amongst which a brief commentary on the Spanda-karikas known as Spanda-Vrtti has come down to us and has been published in combined IV-Vth volumes of Kashmir Series of Texts and Studies. What is today known as the Spanda-sarvasva is not a different text but probably a name for the Vrtti and Karikas together.2 This is clear from the concluding verses of his Vrtti. Kallata also makes it clear in the second concluding verse that he owes the Spanda-thesis to Vasugupta who got it in the form of Siva-sutras from the Lord in a dream, but the credit of bringing it before the public must go to him (Kallata).3 This statement from Kallata also goes to favour the present ascription of authorship of the Karikas to himself.

He has re-ferred twice to the Tattvavicara as another work of the author.2 From the perusal of the quoted verses it appears to be a meta-physical treatise and an independent work not a commentary, by Kallata who gave expression to the outcome of his philoso-phical reflections in it. Whatever little material we have in our possession is sufficient to indicate that in addition to his known works he attempted several other works. Attention has already been invited to his ventures in the spheres of the Kula system as well as the litreature. Jayaratha, while explaining a reference by Abhinava to Kallata,3 cites three sutras4 and attributes them to the latter without assigning actual textual source.

The unitary mainstream drifts into various sub-currents and the foundation of multilateral develop-ment is laid.3 This multiplicity of traditions was kept alive till the time of Jayaratha.4 Both Govindaraja and Bhanuka head the two rich traditions. Govindaraja taught Somananda while Bhanuka was responsible for founding a different line of teachers of the eminence of Ujjata and Udbhata etc. Jayaratha came in this line of teachers and was in possession of the traditional and scholastic secrets.5 Since only one generation intervened between these three and Sivananda and since Somananda came in the immediate next generation, their time is almost certain. They may easily be assigned to the second half, or to be more exact, the third quarter of the ninth century.

Unfortunately none of his stotras could survive the atrocities of time. Only two verses of his have come down to us. In one of them he adores Kala-samkarsini and describes it as an inevitable outcome of one's attaining the ultimate state.6 In the second he extols the spiritual attainment of Keyuravati, his preceptor, who by virtue of her realizing the Khecari state is said to remain in constant unison with the cosmic reality.7 Jayaratha has recorded a verse from some other source which speaks highly of Eraka as one having scored victory over the dualistic consciousness.8 In fact"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"122   The Krama Tantricism of Kashmir it is a glowing tribute to his spiritual eminence.

While dealing with his own genealogy and preceptorial succes-sion in the concluding portion of the Tantraloka, Abhinava mentions one Eraka4 who is a Desika (teacher) and father of a Vamanatha. The question is whether the two can be identified. Vamanatha is mentioned as a teacher of Abhinava and Eraka happens to be his father. Eraka is, therefore, removed by one generation from Abhinava. One has to bear in mind that the first Eraka is a class-fellow and, for that reason, a contem-porary of Govindaraja and Bhanuka and hence is removed by three generations (e.g., Somananda, Utpala, Laks-managupta). The other Eraka naturally seems to be a contem-porary of Utpala, the grand teacher of Abhinava. It is difficult to reject the theory of Eraka's being a classfellow of Govinda-raja in view of their much insisted synchronous initiation. It is therefore, perhaps reasonable to take the two Erakas as diffe-rent. (xi) Pradyumna Bhatta (850-900 A.D.) In his essay on the Tripura system Braj Vallabha Dwivedi has observed in categorical terms that the Tattvagarbha, a stotra by Pradyumna Bhatta, was a Krama work,5 The ground for his contention has been supplied by the theme of the 3.

Before the veracity of this statement is examined, a few words about the work and its author appear called for. Pradyumna Bhatta's importance may be gauged from the very fact that he has been referred to in some way or the other by every author right from Somananda to Ksemaraja. He was bitterly opposed by Somananda for his Sakta predisposition inside the Saiva fold. Utpala elucidates what has already been said by his master. Abhinava and Ksemaraja cite him in their support. He was a worthy student of his worthy teacher Kallata and also a maternal cousin of the latter.1 Bhaskara, in the prefatory part of the Siva-sutra-vartika, gives out his preceptorial lineage as below:2 Vasugupta | Kallata | Pradyumna Bhatta (maternal cousin of Kallata) | Prajnarjuna (son of Pradyumna Bhatta) | Mahadeva Bhatta | Srikantha Bhatta (son of Mahadeva Bhatta) | Bhaskara Even on a cursory glance it would be obvious that he is remov-ed from Vasugupta by a generation only. And although he was a direct disciple of Kallata, he must have been his junior contemporary too, since he was his (Kallata's) maternal cousin. Between him and Bhaskara three generations intervened. Bhaskara was Abhinava's teacher.3 On the other hand,"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"124   The Krama Tantricism of Kashmir Pradyumna Bhatta preceded Somananda as the latter criticizes him. Of all these, Kallata and Abhinava are of definite dates, hence Pradyumna Bhatta's time is almost certain. He is somewhere between Kallata and Somananda. He may, there-fore, be conveniently placed during the latter half of the ninth century. Excepting the Tattvagarbha-stotra1 no other work of his has yet come to our notice. On Utpala's authority we know that it was his work.2 That Somananda does not refer to any-one else except Pradyumna Bhatta becomes obvious from Utpala's testimony, though he nowhere mentions Somananda by name. The verses that have been cited in this connection by Utpala are prefaced with the phrase \"Tairuktam\" (lit. said by them3 i.e., him). Here \"Tair\" (lit. they i.e., he), according to him, stands for the author who propounded the ultimacy of Sakti and also interpreted the Saktistage (state of Sakti tattva) in terms of slight swelling up (Kinciducchunata).4 Besides Pradyumnabhatta none else has done so.5 Hence, in course of Somananda's criticism of the Saktivadin, all the references and citations are deemed to be from Pradyumna Bhatta, and for the matter of that, from the Tattvagarbha. Owing to paucity of material the task of forming a well-knit view of his philosophy is rendered more onerous. Yet 1. Dr. V.S. Agrawala had told the author about the presence of one manuscript of the Tattvagarbha in the Hindu University. It was a recent find. But before the present author could have managed to look into the MS personally Dr.Agrawata, unfortunately, passed away.

The first premise of his philosophy is to reckon Sakti as the Ultimate and yet continue to be a monist.1 He stuck to his view in spite of the odds of his Saiva affiliations. Hence he was a Saktivadin though he clung to the Saiva dis-cipline.2 The Mother Divine, who is the Divinity par transcend-ence, is pure luminosity and passes under the name of Siva also.3 He, in a slight deviation from the general practice of identifying Sakti with Ananda and in apparent agreement with Somananda, equated the Sakti-category with \"little swelling\" which is identical with proneness (Aunmukhya).4 This Sakti-stage came just after the ultimate stage which is akin to the Mother Divine5 - this view was used as a counter-argument by Soma-nanda against Pradyumna Bhatta. The latter held the absolute female principle as identical with Siva with the reservation that it was Mother Divine who was also known as Siva. Hence, while dealing with the various stages of speech he proclaimed that there was no such form of speech as was not present in Siva, a name of the Mother, marking the Para or transcendent-al stage.6 All the three lower aspects of speech namely, Pasy-4.

Likewise, he was of the opinion that the entire stretch of the category kingdom encompassing the thirty-six categories is, in essence, an unfoldment of the Sakti suggesting that the godly freedom remains inevitably inherent even in the world of logical constructions.1 Possibly this was the recurring theme of the Tattvagarbha.2 It is, therefore, due to the force of rectitude of the reflective awareness that one is able to realize everything at will.3 This rectitude is incumbent upon one's recognition of one's potencies of knowledge and action. The main plank of the adverse criticism heaped on him by Somananda consists in the latter's stand that the position of Siva, as the ultimate principle, cannot be compromised. To say that Sakti appears as Siva is a statement made in a fit of devotional ecstasy.4 Otherwise, Sakti in utter isolation from its prius (Saktiman) is beyond conception. Nevertheless, if Sakti with utter disregard to its substrate is thought of, the one holding such a view may be anything but a Saiva.5 It is argued that not only Somananda argues against him but he (Pradyumna bhatta) himself tacitly"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"Sources and Literature    127    acquiesces in the supremacy of Siva by expounding that all the stages of speech finally culminate in Siva.1 However, the cri-ticism by Somananda is very brief and bereft of constructive logic. In fairness to Pradyumna Bhatta, one must be cautioned that Somananda's last plank is slightly misleading since the former has steered his position clear by recognizing Siva as an expression for or an appellation of the Mother Divine. Let us now be back to our original question. Is Pradyu-mna Bhatta a Krama author? The answer is difficult indeed. According to the testimony of Bhaskara, a spiritual descendant of Pradyumna Bhatta, he inherited the Spanda wisdom from Kallata. While discussing Kallata, it was also noticed that Somananda and his followers were rather cut-off from the Spanda school and it is the reason why one does not get any contribution from his group to the Spanda system before Ksemaraja. Pradyumna Bhatta's name nowhere appears in the later Krama literature. Moreover Somananda himself was a man initiated in the Krama discipline, why should he criticize another Krama author? Why then he (Pradyumna Bhatta) be not treated as a Spanda author rather than a Krama author? As has been said, a categorical commitment is impossible and also uncalled for. But for a fuller and better perspective one must look to the other side of the picture as well. Bhaskara's observation is no doubt a limited but not a negative one. He does not reject Pradyumna Bhatta's claim to Krama. Soma-nanda himself, before the critical study and thorough survey of the Krama system as such, was not known to be a Krama thinker. Neither he (Somananda) has been mentioned in the later literature as a Krama author and nor has any work come down to us from his pen on Krama, yet he is a Krama precep-tor. Moreover teachers of the early phase, excepting Sivananda, have seldom been remembered in the later literature. Hence"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"128   The Krama Tantricism of Kashmir this argument loses much of its force. The reasons for putting forward Pradyumna Bhatta as a Krama author lie in the central theme of the Tattvagarbha and its relatively deeper proclivity towards Krama. The Tattvagarbha is a hymn paying obeisance to the Cosmic Mother. Earlier it was pointed out that despite Sakta leanings Spanda considered Siva to be the Ultimate principle, as will be testified to by the very first and last verses of the Spanda-karika. That is, the Spanda system retained its Saiva fervour in spite of its Sakta tendencies. But in the case of Krama the things were different. There were two distinct schools which occasionally and often necessarily enter-tained divergent trends. Their most fundamental line of demar-cation was drawn by their respective emphases on the Siva or Sakti aspects. The natural outcome of it was to treat either of them as the Supreme Reality, all other things being derived from it. Since the school holding the supremacy of the female deity was in ascendence, Krama has also acquired the name of Devinaya or Kalinaya. Further, it has to be noted that there was a lot of mutual digging at between the two schools, hence criticism by Somananda, the mouth-piece of the \"Siva is the Supreme\" - theory, of the opposite \"Sakti is the Supreme\" - thesis is understandable, because in his entire chain of argument he takes strongest objection to the supremacy of Sakti alone. In view of the above argumentation it appears that Pradyumna Bhatta belonged to the line of the Krama thinkers opposite to Somananda's. Hence Pradyumna Bhatta's claim to the Krama authorship requires a careful examination whatever decision one may ultimately arrive at. (xii) Somananda (875-925 A.D.) It may be recalled that Somananda was the immediate successor of Govindaraja who, at his last moment, transmitted all the doctrinal mysteries of Krama to the former.1 All inform-ation about Somananda's associations with the Krama is miserably confined to this cryptic sentence from the Kramakeli as recorded by Jayaratha. Nothing is known whether he ever"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"Sources and Literature    129    attempted a work on the Krama except that Abhinava received his lessons in the Devi-Pancasatika, a Krama text, from him through Utpala and Laksmanagupta.1 The determination of his date, although recognized to be an untedious affair by the scholars, is slightly perplexing because of a few bottlenecks in the form of at least five preceptorial traditions that invite our attention in this behalf. On the basis of the following two parallel traditions Somananda emerges as a contemporary of Kallata2 : Somananda3  Kallata4   | | Utpala  Mukula Bhatta | | Laksmanagupta  Bhattenduraja5   | | Abhinavagupta  Abhinavagupta.  The truth of this tradition is further corroborated by a state-ment of Raghava Bhatta, the commentator on the Sarada Tilaka, wherein Somananda is represented to be a direct dis-ciple of Vasugupta6 - one simply has to recollect that Kallata, too, is an immediate student of Vasugupta. But the greatest anomaly entailed by such an admission would jeopardise the dates of Sivananda, Keyuravati etc. Because according to the original calculation the two were loosely contemporary of Quoted from Bhtteaduraja's conmentary on the Karyalankara-Sara and Mukula's Abbidha-vrtti matrka, Abhi., p. 137."},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"130   The Krama Tantricism of Kashmir Vasugupta and Kallata respectively. However both these tra-ditions agree with regard to a gap of two generations subsisting between Somananda and Abhinava or that of three generations between Vasugupta and Abhinava. Since Kallata's date is fixed owing to his flourish during the reign of Avantivarman (855-883 A.D.), there should not be a gap of more than fifty years between Somananda and Abhinava. The implication being that Abhinava should be placed somewhere 900-950 A.D. instead of 950-1000 A.D., his commonly agreed date. Abhinava's accepted date is further established by the fact that he belonged to the next generation of King Yasaskara who ruled in 839 A.D. and the grandson (i.e., Sura) of whose mini-ster Vallabha was Abhinava's student. Hence Abhinava's date cannot be advanced earlier. Let us see how one can emerge from this dilemma. The other three traditions, given below, widen the gap between Abhinava and Kallata by at least four generations in place of two as noted above. These traditions are : Mahabala1 Mahabala2 (Vasugupta) | | | Acarya Pandita Trivikrama3 (Kallata)4  | (grandson of   |   Srikrsna Mahabala on Pradyumna | daughter's side)  Bhatta (maternal Laksmanagupta |  cousin of Kallata) |  Bhatta Utpala | Abhinava (author of the Prajnarjuna Spanda Pradipika) | |  Mahadeva Bhatta (Abhinava)  |  Srikantha Bhatta | Bhaskara | Abhinava 4. S.SV., 1. 3-9."},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"Sources and Literature    131    Among these family or preceptorial trees, the one rang-ing from Kallata to Bhaskara (Abhinava's teacher) involves at least three intermediary generations even if one takes Prad-yumna Bhatta, Kallata's first disciple, as the latter's contem-porary by virtue of the former's being his maternal cousin. We have already seen Somananda criticising the view and work of Pradyumna Bhatta and he must have taken time in attaining eminence of the kind that he could elicit criticism from Soma-nanda. Thus Somananda is bound to be a junior contemporary, if not a successor, of Pradyumna Bhatta who himself was a disciple of Kallata. In the other tradition ranging from Maha-bala to Laksmanagupta, the celebrated teacher of Abhinava in Krama and Pratyabhijna, the latter is separated from the for-mer by two generations or from Abhinava, for that matter, by three generations. This distance between Mahabala and Abhinava is substantiated by yet another tradition starting from Mahabala and coming up to Bhatta Utpala who transpires to be a contemporary of Laksmanagupta on the basis of the temporal equation of the two exactly parallel lines. If these latter twin traditions are correct - they ought to be correct because they come from different sources and yet speak of the same thing -, Somananda being the grand-teacher of Laksman-agupta must be a contemporary of the latter's grand-father, Acarya Pandita, and may at best be a successor to or a junior contemporary of Mahabala. Stretching the present logic a little further one may conclude that Mahabala himself was Kallata's successor or in any case a contemporary of Pradyumna Bhatta. But one should not feel baffled because such a complex analogue is found even within the traditional account of the Krama system itself. It has been made absolutely clear that Bhanuka was a contemporary of Govindaraja, teacher of Soma-nanda in Krama, and was at the head of the tradition which had immediate successors in Ujjata and Udbhata. This Udbhata was perhaps identical with one mentioned by Abhinava as his teacher, thus the gap between Bhanuka and Abhinava has been further shrunk from three to two generations, if one abides by the first two traditions mentioned in the beginning."},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"132   The Krama Tantricism of Kashmir In the face of such yawning incongruities it is difficult to give a year to year account. One has to make allowance for marginal errors in calculations because the requisite material is not available in its entirety. Keeping this in view, it will be found that, barring the scope of minor adjustments always, our basic stand with regard to respective dates need not be revised. Because, though twentyfive years are allowed for a generation by the historians, one's actual age has no fixed span and may even cross the barriers of middle age or long age. Abhinava himself was known to have enjoyed a long life going well beyond eighty years. Likewise, Mahabala taught Trivi-krama, his grandson, implying the old age of the former. In view of all these considerations Somananda seems to have enjoyed a fairly long life. Moreover, he was a very junior, if at all, contemporary of Kallata whose successors in literature too must have enjoyed a considerably long age, otherwise the two generations on the one side and the four on the other covering the same expanse of time is beyond logical compre-hension. Here, in this study, twentyfive years have been allowed for each generation with a margin of another twenty-five years for computing one's period and date without prejudice to one's other claims. This practice has additional advantage of making allowance for long age as well. Somananda, therefore, has been assigned to the last quarter of the ninth and the first of the tenth century. This period is always open to minor revisions as researches proceed to make headway. He is known to have written several works. But only the incomplete texts of the Siva Drsti is extant today. One of his minor works i.e., Saktavijnana has also been brought out by the Research Department of Kashmir Government. His other two works, both commentaries, are known from references only. One of them is said to be on the Siva Drsti - this view has, however, been rejected by Dr. Stein. The other was on the Pira Trims ka according to the statements of Abhinava.1 Let us 1.

We are completely ignorant about the other aspects of his personality. (xiv) Utpala (900-950 A.D.)

There are indications that Utpala perhaps attempted several other works also. A manuscript entitled as \"Mantrasara\" No. 501 of 1895-98, BORI, Poona ascribed to Utpala Deva3 has come to our notice. The MS in all has 11 pages and 21 folios. It abounds in scribal errors and has later, from P. 8. onwards, been mixed with some portions of Ksemaraja's Pratya-bhijna-hrdaya. But the original work differs from the latter. It seems to be a commentary on the Paratrisika and contains an account of successive emergence of Sanskrit alphabet with its symbolic mysticism and descriptive definitions of various cate-gories followed by a discussion on Guna, Substance and various types of subjects (Pramatrs). These lines refrain from drawing any premature conclusions as to its authorship except advancing the hypothesis for future scrutiny. Utpala's probable date does not present any problem. He, being the pupil of Somananda and the grand-teacher of Abhinava, may safely be assigned to the first half of the tenth century. 1.

According to them Utpala was both the son and pupil of Somananda.1 Besides, he was the father and teacher of Laksmanagupta.2 This lineage is said to have been derived from Abhinava's own statement: [Somananda, his son Utpala and his son Laksmanagupta recline on the ocean of the lineage pertaining to Tryambaka]. The conclusion seems to be in order on the face of Abhinava's statement. But if one accepts it, one is trapped in another anomalous situation. Utpala himself names his father as Udayakara in the last verse of his Isvara-pratyabhijna-karika4 and refers to Soma-nanda as his great and illustrious teacher.5 If Somananda was his father as alleged above, he could have utilized the opportunity to assert the same. In addition, Abhinava-gupta commenting on the last Karika does not dispute Utpala's version but readily confirms the same.6 Even on the issue of 1. Abhi., p. 160, 162; Contribution.

There was all the more reason to refer to Laksmanagupta in this context, because it was the latter who initiated Abhinava into the Sivadrsti. And if Utpala be accused of misleading the posterity, Abhinava had the opportunity to make corrective amends which he did not do. There is an additional collateral evidence to substantiate the present contention that Laksmanagupta was not Utpala's son. According to the Saradatilaka Tantra he (Laksmanagupta) was the son of some Srikrsna, grandson of Acarya Pandita and great-grand-son of Mahabala.2 This point would be examined in detail when we discuss Laksmanagupta. Then, should Abhinava be held guilty of misguiding the people by his statement on which the conclusion at issue is based? It is not the case. In fact, Abhinava is here alluding to his teachers3 and is discussing their 'Santatikrama' (lit., geneology) which as a technical expression stands for their pre-ceptorial lineage, implying that the unity of a tradition depends upon the extent of its continuity.

Thus Utpala's parental and preceptorial traditions would take the following forms respectively: (xv) Udbhatta (900-950 A.D.) He is supposed to be the grand pupil of Bhanuka and successor to Ujjata.

The other Udbhata, in question, is one mentioned by Abhinava as his teacher.2 Of these two, the latter may be identified with the Krama author. However, this personality-equation is being advanced as a tentative measure, for Jaya-ratha actually reads Udbhatta and not Udbhata.3 But this might be due to scribal mistake also. If this equation be grant-ed, he must have been of fairly advanced age when Abhinava approached him for instruction. He may also be placed in the first half of the tenth century. (xvi) Stotrakara i.e. Sidha Natha (900-950 A.D.) The authorship issue of the famous Krama stotra is a crucial question in the history of Krama thought. The tantric history has recorded the presence of about four Krama-stutis. One is attributed to Samkara, son of Kamalakara, and is taken note of by Kaivalyasrama in his Saubhagya-vardhini on the Ananda Lahari.4 The other is a work of Abhinavagupta and was composed in the years 990-991 A.D. which will be dealt with during our treatment of Abhinava. Uncertainty prevails about the third Krama stuti a reference to which has been made by Monier Williams under the word \"Krama\" in his dictionary without giving further details or source of information. The fourth is one in question whose authorship is the subject-matter of the present enquiry. We are not aware if the third and fourth works are one and identical. The first Krama stuti is presently beyond our scope owing to its adherence to the Tripura system. The third, too, is left out in the absence of necessary and rele-vant data. Hence we concentrate on the fourth Krama stuti whose author is yet a matter of speculation. 1. R.T., 4.495. 3. T.A.V., III, p. 192. 4. S.L.

He is always described and presented as the Stotrakara.1 Since the questions of his identity and date cannot be investigated in isolation from each other, the only course open is to treat them together. The earliest author who refers to the Krama stotra is Abhinava himself who, on his own information, wrote commen-tary on it called Kramakeli.2 His date is definite i.e., second half of the tenth century, and he himself composed a Krama stotra emulating his precursor's example during the year 990-991 A.D. Therefore, the lower limit of the Krama stotra is set by the date of Abhinava. It, therefore, must have been compo-sed prior to 950-975 A.D. A dive into Jayaratha's account would reveal that various commentaries had come up by his time and certain doubts were being raised about its precise content and number of verses comprising it. Different interpretations were advanced and a state of confusion tends to overtake us. Jaya-ratha draws our attention to at least two such expositions.3 The other cue in Jayaratha's treatment traces the tradi-tional line of the Stotrakara in descending order as the Author of the Stotra, Bhaskara and Kuladhara.4 Of these, Bhaskara is comparatively familiar figure and is perhaps the same as Abhinava's teacher of the same name. This possibility gains firmer ground in view of the absence of any other Bhaskara prior to Abhinava. Since the Stotrakara preceded Bhaskara, he must belong to the first quarter or the first half, in any case, of the tenth century. In other words, his date should not be later than Bhaskara's. This is the time to which Laksmana-"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"140   The Krama Tantricism of Kashmir gupta and Sambhunatha, Abhinava's teachers in Krama and Kula respectively, belonged. On the other hand, the upper limit of the Krama stotra does not extend beyond Eraka who, as a contemporary of Govindaraja and Bhanuka, is assigned to the third quarter or the second half of the ninth century. Because, the first ever credit of writing the stotras in the Krama history goes to Eraka who made it a mission of his life to popularise the Krama system through his stotras. Hence the probable time of the Krama stotra and, for this matter, its author must fall somewhere within 850-950 A.D. From the tentative fixation of the probable period of the Stotrakara let us now proceed to discover the identity of the author. The Cidgagana-candrika, which on its own authority is a commentary on the Krama stotra, attributes the authorship to some Siddhanatha1 or Siddhinatha.2 There is no reason what-soever to deny the account as furnished by the Cidgagana-cand-rika.

Avalon, the editor of the Cidgagana-candrika, in identifying the two.1 But let us be careful. The odds against this personality-equation are equally heavy. First, Sambhunatha is famous for his teachings in the Kula system and not in the Krama. Though it is not unusual for a Kula teacher to be proficient in any other cognate philosophical system Abhinava, who is so scrupulous in mentioning the minutest possible details about his teachers, should not have failed to record this aspect of his teacher's personality. Secondly, this Siddhanatha alias Sambhunatha of Prthvidharacarya should necessarily precede the latter as it is the latter who refers to the former. As we know, Prthvidharacarya came in the tradition of the Samkaracaryas. The manuscript of the Balarcanavidhi in the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society2 gives out the preceptorial lineage of the Srngerimatha in this sequence - Gaudapada, Govinda, Samkaracarya, Prthvi-dharacarya, Brahma Caitanya, Ananda Caitanya etc. etc. Thus Prthvidharacarya is placed next to the Samkaracarya who is assigned to the 8th century.3 As Samkara died early, Prthvi-dharacarya's period too falls in the vicinity of his predecessor's. Therefore his date cannot be stretched beyond the first quarter and, at any rate, the second quarter of the ninth century. Hence Sambhunatha of Prthvidharacarya transpires to be a contempo-rary of Samkara. But Sambhunatha, the teacher of Abhinava, cannot be put back beyond the first half of the century. In fact, in view of his being Abhinava's teacher, he need not be pushed back beyond the second quarter of the tenth century.

In the wake of these discrepancies it is fraught with grave misgivings to identify the two Sambhunathas. It may, therefore, be firmly held that the two are two different persons and the editor of the Gidgagana candrika has been misled by the identity of names. But the author of the Cidgagana-candrika is perfectly right when he names one Siddhinatha to be the author of the Krama stotra. Fortunately, the name of one Siddhanatha in the annals of the Kashmir Saivism has come down to us and, for this, our thanks go to Bhatta Utpala whose Spanda Pradipika has proved to be a mine of information so far as the early phase of the Krama history is concerned. According to Bhatta Utpala, this Siddhanatha was the author of the work entitled Abhed-artha Karika from which a passage has also been cited.3 Since Bhatta Utpala is a contemporary of Laksmanagupta, Siddha-natha may be said to have belonged to any generation earlier to Bhatta Utpala's. But we are not required to go back farther. Because according to the Krama tradition, recorded by Jaya-ratha and referred to earlier, Bhaskara, the teacher of Abhinava, is an immediate successor to the Stotrakara.

It is by a happy chance that the Krama stotra, almost complete, has survived to this date in the pages of the Viveka of Jayaratha.1 In all about twelve verses are accessible. But the chances are that it contained a few verses more, because some-times two verses instead of one were addressed to certain Kalis, for instance, Rudrakali and Yamakali.2 Coming to the contents of the Krama stotra we see that there was correspondence in the root idea between the Krama stotra and the Pancasatika, though they disagreed in one field. While the Pancasatika retained the name of Sukali in the list of Kalis to be adored and thus main-tained the total number of Kalis at thirteen in Anakhyacakra, the Krama stotra excluded Sukali and numbered them twelve. Jayaratha also pointed out a misunderstanding current in a section of the followers that the Krama stotra went by the Krama Sadbhava4 in its treatment of the Kills in Anakhyacakra. Jaya-ratha rejects any such possibility and holds, instead, that it did emulate some Agama though quoted but not named by him.5 It disagreed with the Sardasatika regarding the order of the Kalis. While Sardhasatika, as elsewhere, discusses Sthitikali after Srstikali, the Krama stotra first takes up Raktakali in lieu of Sthitikali. The primary object in doing so is to present the real Samvitkrama. No incongruity attaches to it. Since, in the Agama the order is modified or reversed so as to conceal . the Samvit-krama as is done in the Pancasatika with regard to the Sthitikrama.

Jayaratha has no sympathy with former group which had a different text or the reading of the Stotra together with a different arrangement of the verses, as is testified to by another commentary called Vivarana. But possibly Jayaratha's group could not make much headway in appealing to the reason of the opponents as is evinced by the compromise formula evolved by Jayaratha that one should better go in for that reading which has the sanction and approval of one's preceptor.2 Abhinavagupta and Sivopadhyaya both have invited our attention to the metaphysical richness of the Krama stotra. Abhinava presents it as advocating the elimination of doubt, which as principle of limitation is the primal cause of mundane duality, for realizing the true self.3 For Sivopadhyaya the central theme of the Stotra is to prevail upon one to attain the Ultimate Divinity which uproots the limitations accruing from time and space and finds own counterpart in the Prajna-Paramita of Buddhism.4 (xvii) Bhaskara (925-975 A.D.)

He is generally included among the authors of the Spanda branch, in the light of which he wrote his famous Varttika on the Sivasutras. The only reason for making a reference to him, here, consists in the fact that he is presented as the immediate successor to the Stotrakara and as trans-mitting the latter's doctrinal dicta to the next generation. There was a doctrinal scuffle between the two opposite groups as to whether or not the Stotrakara followed the Krama-Sadbhava. Jayaratha rejects any such adherence on the part of the Stotra-kara, while the other school acquiesced into the giving out the tradition of the Stotrakara.1 Bhaskara is a student of Srikantha in the Spanda branch2 and of the Stotrakara in the Krama. He is the son of Divakara as stated by him.3 Abhinava's reference to one son of Divakara and author of the Vivekanjana is meant for him.4 Yogaraja also refers to a son of Divakara as the author of the Kaksyastotra.5 A verse from this work has figured in the Pratyabhijnahrdaya of Ksemaraja.6 Abhinava has generally referred to him as Bhatta Divakaravatsa.7 These references indicate that Bhaskara was more popular as the son of Divakara than by his personal name. As Abhinava has frequently referred to him not only as Divakaravatsa but as Bhatta Bhaskara8 also, he is supposed to be earlier than Abhinava.

Apart from three works enumerated above he is also cre-dited with the authorship of two more works namely, the Mimamsa-samgraha-kaumudi and Padyamrtasopana. This sugges-tion is advanced by Natarajan in his valued thesis who has relied on the information supplied by the Madhya-Yugina-Caritrakosa, p. 585. There is no evidence either to affirm or deny the statement. Bhaskara is, however, most renowned for his Varttika on the Sivasutras. In this connection it is to be noted that not only his approach is different from Ksemaraja's but even their versions of the text of the original Sivasutras sometimes vary. Pt. M.S.

Com-menting on the word 'Anyatha' of T.A. 15.246, Jayaratha indi-cates that Laksmanagupta advocated a different type of Nyasa-vidhi from one advanced by Sambhunatha.3 His main thesis is to analyse the six-fold Sakta-nyasa, which again is one of the six original Nyasas, in order to invoke and realize Kalasamkar-sini.4 This, as we know, is a typical Krama concept. From this one gets inclined to concede that he definitely wrote a few works. The only definite word in this behalf is met with in a statement where he is stated to have produced a work called \"Srisastra\".5 It seems improbable to make out anything definite out of such random and cryptic statements.

The account of Laksmana's parentage also goes a long way to vouchsafe the veracity of the present thesis. At the end of the book he says that his father was Srikrsna, his grand-father Acarya Pandita and great-grand father Mahabala.1 All of them, he says, were men of great piety and erudition and enjoyed great reputation for the same. Of all his ancestors, fortunately, Mahabala, his great-grand father, is known to us. He is the author of the Rahasyagarbha-stotra and also the great-grand father of Bhatta Utpala on the daughter's side.2 Maha-bala, as we have already noted during our study on Utpala and Somananda, is a contemporary of Pradyumna Bhatta and Somananda. Laksmanagupta and Bhatta Utpala both being grandsons, one on the son's side and the other on the daughter's, of Mahabala are contemporaries and have blood affiliations. In the history of Kashmir Saivism we have no other Laksrnana except one, the teacher of Abhinava, whose time exactly coin-cides with that of the author of the Saradatilaka Tantra. Care has been taken to make it absolutely clear that Laksmanagupta was only a pupil and not a son of Utpala as has been made out in some scholarly circles.3 Thus, one may be inclined to hold Laksmanagupta as identical with Laksrnana Desikendra and his Srisastra with the Saradatilaka.

He is different from his namesake predecessor, the teacher of Laksmanagupta, and in contrast to bare Utpala, is known as Bhatta Utpala or Utpala Vaisnava.

According to a modern scholar the Spanda-pradipika is a commentary on the Spanda Karikas on Vaisnava lines.3 This might have been a probable source of his fame as \"Vaisnava\".

Bhutiraja is a very important name in the history of the Krama thought despite the unfortunate fact that none of his works is extant today. There are four Bhutirajas that attract our notice in the whole range of the Kashmir Saivism. The first happens to be a teacher of Abhinava in Brahmavidya. The second is the father of Bhatta Induraja. The third is the father of Helaraja, the illustrious commentator on the Vakyapadiya. And the fourth is a pupil of Cakrabhanu, a Krama celebrity, and who rather proved to be the focal point of a heated con-troversy in Jayaratha's time. We are presently concerned with the number one Bhuti-raja because, while quoting him in the Krama context, Abhi-nava refers to him as his teacher.3 But there should be no misunderstanding, he did not teach the Krama system to Abhinava.

Jayaratha explicitly admits that Bhutiraja was a teacher of Abhinava but what he objects to is that the Krama system or any text pertaining to Krama e.g., the Devipancasatika, was not his specific field of instruction.3 But at the same time, he did make some solid contribution to the Krama system in his own right which is borne out by the two extracts attributed to him. In one he derives the word Kali from the root Kalana meaning Ksepa and Jnana4 and in the other he asserts the sameness of Mantra with the trans-cendental principle of Awareness owing to its all-encompassing capacity.5 Besides the above two sciences, he also initiated Abhinava in three mystic disciplines6 pertaining to Pranava Maya and Bindu.7 He also entertained definite views of his own regarding Bhuvanadhvan8 and Pratistha Kala.9 Abhinava had an extremely high sense of respect for his, teacher so that he respected his teacher more than his father.10 7.

Jayaratha had to justify the mention of Bhutiraja's name by Abhinava in the Tantraloka2 while paying obeisance to his teachers, as the Tan-traloka having a defined aim and scope need not refer to persons from the outer circles.3 Bhutiraja, by dint of being Abhinava's teacher, may be bracketed with his other teachers and therefore may be said to have belonged to the previous generation of Abhinava. But his date may be pushed a little earlier, because Abhinava was not a student of Bhutiraja alone but of his son as well.4 Hence he must have been of fairly old age when Abhinava approached him. He may, therefore, be assigned to the first half of the tenth century. He is also identical with the Bhutiraja Number Two who has been referred to as father of Bhattenduraja who, in addition to Dhvanisastra, initiated Abhinava in the mysteries of the Gita. The genealogy of Induraja given by Abhinava in the concluding portion of his Bhagvadgitartha-samgraha is self-explanatory.

Be-cause Helaraja, in the colophon to each section of his commen-tary on the Vakyapadiya, regularly refers to himself as the son of Bhutiraja (Bhutirajatanaya).1 Abhinava has included one Bhutirajatanaya whom he does not name among his teachers.2 He came in the lineage of Srinatha, the first exponent of dua-listic philosophy, and was possibly taught by his father. By im-plication, he educated Abhinava in the dualistic Saivism. The two Bhutirajas may be identified since, (i) Abhinava does not refer to his teacher in Saiva dualism by name but by his parental description i.e., Bhutirajatanaya, (ii) Except Helaraja nobody else refers to himself as Bhutirajatanaya, (iii) Abhinava evinces great familiarity with Bhartrhan's system as presented by Helaraja specially in respect of the Kalasakti that acted as harbinger of the Krama concept of Kali. If that be so, the two Bhutirajas, too, become one and Induraja and Helaraja happen to be brothers, one shining as the literary critic and the other as a philosopher. In this connection attention may be drawn to a reference by Sitikantha to some Dutirajatanaya who, in spite of his not belonging to the Krama system, had inherited different versions regarding the Yuganathas and tried to thrust them on the Krama system proper.3 Sitikantha has criticised such beha-viour. Our contention is that this Dutirajatanaya is none else than Bhutirajatanaya. 'Du' and 'Bhu' in hastily written Sarada characters are difficult to distinguish, hence the scribal mistake.

For the simple reason that Cakrabhanu, as will be seen in the sequel, is historically posterior (i.e., circa 1050-1100 A.D.) to Abhinava-gupta. Hence to say that his pupil (circa 1075-1125 A.D.) was a teacher of Abhinava would be a historical absurdity.1 More-over, the method of worship advocated by this Bhutiraja is said to be based on the Pancasatika, according to which the number of deities to be worshipped is not twelve. It, therefore, seems logically incongruous to treat Bhutiraja, a spokesman of the not-twelve doctrine, as a teacher of Abhinava, a staunch pro-tagonist of the twelve-deity doctrine.2 Thus these two Bhutirajas seem to be two different personalities, though both having definite relationship with the Krama system.

In view of his vast erudition acquired through personal approaches to almost every teacher in all the then possible branches of learning, if he is allowed a preparatory period to thirty to thirtyfive years before he could embark upon writing, he may be said to have flourished and lived during 950-1020 A.D. One will arrive at approximately similar dates from a different source as well. Kama, one of his favoured students, was the grandson of Vallabha, the court-minister of King Yasaskara, who definitely reigned in the year 939 A.D.5 It is a strange coincidence that Purna Manoratha, the first known ancestor of Jayaratha, was a colleague of Vallabha in the court of the same king.6 Vallabha's son Sauri (who was also a minister) and daughter-in-law Vatsalika7 were Abhinava's contemporaries and the latter was looked after by Vatsalika when he was engaged in writing his Tantraloka.8 In addition, Yogesvaridatta, the son of Karna, came of age and displayed merits equal to his name before the eyes of Abhinava.9 Thus Quoted from an unspecified source, Contribution, p. 342. 2.

But the way Abhinava refers to it and the context in which it finds a place, make it quite probable that Abhinava might have attempted a work under this name.

The system has pro-fited by him in at least four positive ways - firstly, as an indi-spensable respository of tradition and thought; secondly, as a sourcebook of authors and their works preceding him; thirdly, as a commentator on the few important Krama texts; and finally, as an original thinker of enviable value who fostered the thought with a critical analysis and insight. But for him, we, today, would have missed the richness of the entire tradi-tional intellectual development.5 He assimilated the tradition and then enriched it by exposition and embellishment. In the history of the Krama thought only two names can be cited to match him in the enormity of historical allusions. They are Jayaratha, his own commentator, and Mahesvarananda. But for Abhinava's Kramakeli the early history of the system would have remained the \"pre-history\" for a modern student. As a commentator he has produced the Kramakeli on the Kramastotra 1.

His other commentary Vivarana is an expo-sition of his own Prakarana Stotra. The Tantraloka, Krama Stotra, Prakarana Stotra and Tantrasara are his original contributions to the system. The Tantraloka covers a vast expanse and, in its mas-sive efforts 10 preserve and present the Kashmir Saiva thought in its fullness, deals with the Krama dicta and theses to almost perfection. The Tantrasara tries to do the same in brief. His Krama works will be taken up for a fuller treatment. When he diverted his attention from literature to the study of Saiva monism, Krama was his first love in philosophy. The earliest date of the Krama Stotra bears ample testimony to it. The first verse of the Krama Stotra makes it obvious that he was rest-less and had no peace of mind before he turned to Krama.1 Abhinava attained his proficiency in Kramic experiments and went very far in realizing the true spirit of the system. He him-self affirms it.2 Apart from his specific Krama treatises, there are certain other texts namely, the Malinivijqya-varttika, Paryanta Pancasika and Paratrimsika-vivarana wherein he occasionally dwells on the Krama tenets at length. Among his Krama works, the Krama Stotra is his first contribution in the chronological order as its earliest date would vindicate.3 After ventilation of his views about the nature and purpose of devotional prayer, the Stotra grows through four stages viz., (i) the background of the Kramic emanation, (ii) rise and emergence of Kramic evolution through twelve Kalikas, (iii) repose of Krama in the Absolute, and (iv) the epilogue invoking the Godhead's grace"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"Sources and Literature    163    on humanity. The order in which the various stages i.e., Kalis, succeed each other is in consonance with the metaphysical aspect (Samvit-krama) of it and not with the ritualistic one (Pujana-krama). The ante-penultimate verse indicates Abhi-nava's unmistakable adherence to the school that held Siva as the ultimate reality.1 The Prakarana Stotra is known today only from a reference to it by Abhinava in the Tantrasara.2 Its chief purpose was to dwell on the concept of Kali with an accent upon its etymological implications. The Prakarana Vivarana3 was in all probability a commentary by Abhinava himself on the said Stotra. Both of these works were intended to cover in detail the nature of the dynamic Absolutism and its modus operandi echoing the manifold derivative significance of the word 'Kalana.' A word of caution may be added. Abhinava does not give out the name of this text as the Prakarana Vivarana. He simply says Vivarana. It is not known whether he meant by it the Krama-keli, a commentary on the Krama Stotra, or an independent com-mentary on the Prakaranastotra itself. In such a fluid state of affairs one has to base one's hypothesis on the contextual evidence and should press it only to that extent, no further. In this connec-tion, it may be noted that he wrote another work called the Prakunaka-vivarana.4 It is yet hypothetical to say that the two were identical Dr. Pandey appears to take them as two separate works.5 Nagarajan follows Dr. Pandey.6 But on a close perusal Jayaratha explains the word 'Anyatra' thus -5.

Let us, however, await the verdict of future investigation on it. The single work called Tantraloka is sufficient to make him the doyen of the monistic philosophers of Kashmir.

Its Ahnikas 4 and 13 are particularly relevant. The former presents a masterly epitome of the Krama ideals. The Kramakeli2 is an important Krama text.

Jayaratha is very insistent that the Krama Stotra (of Siddhanatha), and for that matter Abhinava, did not budge an inch from the twelve-kali theory.3 But on the other hand, Mahesvarananda tends to show him as supporting thirteen-kali theory.4 Nevertheless, so far as the question of interpreting Abhinava is concerned, it is more advisable to abide by Jayaratha not only because of his Viveka on the Tantraloka, but also because of his claim that he was in possession of the original tradition which started with Sivananda and was actuated by Abhinavagupta. A brief explanation would perhaps be necessary for exclusion of the Dehartha-devata-cakra-stotra from amongst the Krama works, since the same has been taken as a Krama text by some authors.5 The stotra, in question, eulogizes the physi-cal body as an abode of spirituality, and each constituent organ of the body has a particular divinity stationed in it. This theme is taken to be a particular aspect of the Krama system. In fact, the things do not appear to be so. This is a general feature of the Kashmir Saivism and consequently all the systems com-prising it share this notion.6 Hence it has not been considered to be a Krama work. 1.

First, he wrote the Spanda Samdoha followed by the Spanda Nirnaya in which he perceptibly deviated from the traditional Spanda schoolmen. The Pratyabhijna was his next field in which he produced his two famous works namely, Pratyabhijnahrdaya and Svacchanda-tantlra-uddyota. This was followed by his illustrious commentary on the Siva-sutra called Vimarsini. Similarly his commentaries on the Stava-cintamani and Netra Tantra, too, came after that on the Svacchanda Tantra. During this period he con-tinued his other literary and philosophical minor ventures allusions to which are splashed through all his works.8 He has tremendous respect for his teacher and has closely drawn on him for whatever has passed through under his pen.

The date of Varadaraja may be settled easily. On the basis of a probable interpretation of the phrase used by Madhuraja e.g, \"Siddha-visakha-krpamrta-varse\", Dr. Pandey hypothetically places Madhuraja in the Saptarsi year 4167 (1093 AD.) when he was eighty years of age.3 And if it is interpreted in terms of Kali era, the year of his birth comes to be 4087 Kali On this latter calculation, he would be 28 years old during the year 4115 of Kali era (1014-15 A D.) when the Isvara-Pratyabhijnavivrti-vimarsini of Abhinava was completed.4 This would naturally place Varadaraja somewhere between 1020-1080 A.D. But on certain additional evidence Varadaraja seems to have flourished little earlier.

This would be probably stretching the date of Abhinava beyond proportions. Moreover Varadaraja, though closely following Ksemaraja, does not introduce himself as latter's pupil. Instead, he flashes a subtle hint that he was taught by Abhinava and Madhuraja both. In that case, he might have been of mature age when his father approached Abhinava, because then his father himself was 74. Since he follows the Vimarsini of Ksema-raja which was among the latter's last works, he comes to be his slightly junior contemporary and may be placed around 1000-1050 A.D. It therefore seems likely that the interpretation of the verse, alluded to above, requires a further probe. In this con-nection we may suggest as a tentative measure that if the word Visakha be interpreted as standing for number 'one' represent-ing Karttikeya (himself) instead of 'six' (representing his six faces) as taken by Dr. Pandey, we find the phrase \"Siddha-visakha-krpamrtavarse\" will mean \"in the year 4117 (and not 4167).\" This will further mean that Madhuraja was eighty years old in 4117 (1016-17 A.D.) of Kali era. Thus he would be 78 years when Abhinavagupta completed his Brhari-vimarsini. Accordingly all events connected with Madhuraja, on this inter-pretation, will go back by 50 years.

Sura is mentioned as a pupil of Ksemaraja. The author of this Gurupankti is one Deva Bhatta who describes himself as a pupil of Sura.2 We are not aware whether or not Devapani can be equated with this Devabhatta, Bhatta being an honorific title or surname. There is another name ending with the word Pani e.g., Cakrapani, among the Krama authors to be discussed subsequently. He has also been referred to as Cakranatha instead of Cakrapani.3 Hence, it does not seem utterly irrelevant to view Devapani's whereabouts in this perspective.4 If, at all, such possibility is conceded, Devapani's (?) date is fairly certain, since he comes next to Sura, the pupil of Ksemaraja (975-1025 A.D.) and may, therefore, be assigned to a period about 1025-1075 A.D . But, it may be repeated, it is a mere hypothesis. (xxvii) Hrasvanatha (1025-1075 A.D.) With Hrasvanatha one enters into one of the most com-plicated arenas of the Krama history. His advent is a landmark 1. \"The Works of Abhinavagupta\", JOR, XIV-IV, p. 327. 4.

The forthcoming paragraphs are addressed to examin-ing the relevant data to the extent available and allowing each factor and evidence to suggest its own conclusion. It may, however, be pointed out that Cakrabhanu's date is a key-factor in deciding the date of Hrasvanatha. Let us take these data one by one. (i) Jayaratha (1150-1200 A.D.) refers to Hrasvanatha, Bhojaraja and Somaraja in a succession.1 Hrasvanatha, there-fore, must precede Jayaratha and, in view of the intervening generations, be placed around 1075-1125 A.D. In other words he should not be later than this date. (ii) According to a tradition current in Jayaratha's time,2 the series of the Krama teachers from Keyuravati (825-875 A.D.) to Bhutiraja, the pupil of Cakrabhanu, (both inclusive) account for sixteen generations of Krama. In other words, the distance between Keyuravati and Cakrabhanu (both exclusive) spreads over thirteen generations. Allowing 25 years to each generation (i.e. about 325 years) he may be placed around 1150-1175 A.D. since Keyuravati belongs to the second and third quarters of the ninth century. But at this point we encounter another tradition recorded by Jayaratha.3 It does not take the first six"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"178   The Krama Tantricism of Kashmir pupils of Keyuravati in vertical order but in horizontal one, that is, the first six pupils were mutually contem-porary. Hence, Cakrabhanu's removal from Keyuravati is cut short from 13 to 8 generations (13-6=7, +1 repre-senting all the six disciples). The approximate date of Cakrabhanu may, therefore, be put in the vicinity of 1025-1075 A.D. This conclusion is further substantiated by Jayaratha's final premise1 that twenty generations account for the entire preceptorial tradition from Sivananda to Bhutiraja, pupil of Cakrabhanu. Among these, first generation has three teachers (Keyuravati etc) and the second six (Govindaraja etc.). Thus Cakrabhanu (and not his pupil) is removed from Sivananda not by twenty but by ten generations (both exclu-sive). Ten we say, because between Sivananda and Cakrabhanu seventeen (excluding both as well as Cakrabhanu's pupil) generations have intervened. If we deduct seven generations (not nine because three pupils would account for one and the other six for the other generation) from seventeen the gap is reduced to ten. Computing it from Sivananda (800-850 A.D.) upto Cakrabhanu, a period of 250 years seems to have elapsed. Cakrabhanu, therefore, comes close to the era (1050-1100 A.D.) as discussed above. (iii) Jayaratha has drawn our attention to the fact that Hrasvanatha either possessed a commentary in manuscript form on the Krama Stotra (of Siddhanatha) or else wrote a comment-ary on it.2 Whatever be the case, Hrasvanatha therefore cannot be placed earlier than 925-975 A.D., the date of the Stotrakara. From Jayaratha's description it is obvious that people had started speculating about the number of the verses in and the central theme of the Krama Stotra and, consequently,"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"Sources and Literature    179    numerous commentaries had come into existence.1 Therefore an allowance has to be made for the adequate lapse of time between the Stotra and Hrasvanatha so as to give rise to the controversies with regard to the Stotra. A hundred years' gap may be sufficient to account for the confusion. Consequently his date falls about 1025-1075 A.D. On this count, Bhojaraja and Somaraja being the consecutive successors would natu-rally be placed around 1050-1100 A.D. and 1075-1125 A.D. respectively. (iv) Jayaratha quotes two verses from Somaraja describ-ing his preceptorial ancestry.2 It is to be noted that Hrasva-natha was removed from Somaraja only by one generation e.g., Bhojaraja. It was natural for Soma to come at the end of the tradition since he himself is recording the tradition.3 (v) In this connection the Cidgaganacandrika also traces the origin of the tradition to Sivananda and places Soma at the end of the tradition4 The place of Cakrabhanu comes in between and he is referred to as the pilot (ananagra) among the pupils It is therefore implicit in it that Soma came at the end of that tradition which was presided over by Cakrabhanu. (vi) Cakrabhanu is described by Sitikantha as marking the end of human tradition (Manavaugha) but constituting the beginning of the line of disciples (Sisyaugha). With Hrasva-natha the human tradition begins.5 In other words Hrasvanatha"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"180  The Krama Tantricism of Kashmir precedes Cakrabhanu. This tradition was in course of time handed down to Sitikantha. (vii) Since (a) Hrasvanatha precedes Cakrabhanu,1 (b) Soma or Somaraja comes at the end of the tradition presided by Cakrabhanu,2 and (c) only one generation intervenes bet-ween Hrasvanatha and Somaraja,3 the gap between Hrasva-natha and Somaraja is necessarily filled in by Cakrabhanu on the one hand and Bhojaraja on the other. (viii) To come back to dates again. It has been seen that the Cidgaganacandrika takes note of a tradition headed by Siva-nanda and concluded with Soma. The author of the Cidgagana-candrika claims to have learnt the secrets of the system from Somaputra i.e, Soma's son.4 That is, the author of the Cidgaganacandrika chronologically succeeds the son of Soma. This text has been frequently quoted by Mahesvarananda in his Parimala on the Maharthamanjari.5 Mahesvarananda is assigned to the close of the twelfth or the beginning of the thirteenth (1175-1225 A D.) century. In the circumstances, the following picture of the authors' chronological succession emerges : Cakrabhanu | Soma | Somaputra | Author of the C.G.C. (Srivatsa?) | Mahesvarananda (1175-1225 A.D.) Thus one arrives at Cakrabhanu's probable period which falls about 1075-1125 A.D. Hrasvanatha, owing to his historical priority, would naturally belong to 1050-1100 A.D. 1. Ibid. 2. C.G.C, 4.121. 3.

The last verse of the Cidgaganacandrika mentions the name of its author as Srivatsa.1 If this Srivatsa is taken to be identical with one who is Mankha's friend and contemporary,2 Srivatsa would be placed round about 1125-1175 A.D.; because Mankha was a court-minister of King Jayasimha3 (1127-1151 A.D.). In that case the son of Soma, Soma and Cakrabhanu would naturally come around 1100-1150, 1075-1125 and 1075-1100 A.D. respectively. Contemporaneous with Cakrabhanu, Bhojaraja would also be placed during 1050-1100 A.D. Hrasvanatha being an immediate precursor of Cakrabhanu would automatically date back by a generation i.e., 1025-1075 A.D. Thus from all these considerations Hrasvanatha may be assigned to the second and third quarters of the eleventh century. Similarly Bhutiraja, the pupil of Cakrabhanu, may be bracketed with Soma (1075-1125 A.D.). Corning to his creative side, one is not placed in a very happy position to say much about his scholarship and contri-bution. He was also known by another name i.e., Viranatha-pada.4If one abides by Dr. Pandey's suggested modification of 'Hrasvanathenapi' into 'Hrasvanathasyapi',5 one may be able to say that Hrasvanatha wrote a commentary on the Krama Stotra in his own hand-writing and the same was accessible to Jayaratha. If, however, the original construction is retained, one would have an occasion to say that Hrasvanatha had his own manuscript copy of a commentary on the Krama Stotra.

Hrasvanatha, too, was not free from the complications of a controversy Jayaratha criticises a verse that gave the number of his pupils as five, whereas Jayaratha points out that he had six students, the sixth being Bhojaraja.2 The controversy, however, clarifies the issue of the precise number of his students. There is one more Hrasvanatha, who is said to have written a work entitled Advayasampatti. His father's name was Harsadatta.3 The problem is whether the two could be In the Library of BORI, Poona, (here is a manuscript of (no. 472 of 1875-76) a work called Bodhavilasa. Its author is some Harsadatta-sunu (i.e., son of Harsadatta). The colophon reads -It is a small work in Sarada characters. Its author is the son of some Harsadatta very proficient in the Mimamsa system. But the compari-son of the text with that quoted by Sivopadhyaya from Advayasampatti ascribed to Vamananatha vide V.Bh.V., pp. 78-79 shows their verbatim affinity barring a few minor variations. The only difference between the two texts consists in the four additional verses contained in Bodha-vilasa, two in the beginning and two towards the close. Keeping in view the arguments advanced above it leads one to formulate the following views - (i) Bodhavilasa was an additional title of the Advaya-sampatti, (ii) the MS as it is, has been copied from the Vivrti of Sivopa-dhyaya, appending four extra verses to it, (iii) whatever the name of the text it was written by the son of Harsadatta, possibly also known as Vamananatha, (v) the work was intended to be a commentary on"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"Sources and Literature    183    identified. Abhinava refers to one Vamana, author of a com-mentary on the Advayasamparti, called Advayasampatti-varttika.1 If there is a Varttika on the Advaya-sampatti of Hrasvanatha, son of Harsadatta, he gets even remoter and older than Abhinava. Naturally the two cannot be identified. There is an additional support for the above contention. The same quotation is attributed to Vamananatha by Sivopadhyaya who attributes Advayavartrika to Hrasvanatha, the son of Harsadatta, in a different context.2 Here he is spoken of as the author of Dvayasampatti. Actually initial 'A' is missing owing to the scribe's omission. Thus Hrasvanatha alias Viranathapada is different from Hrasvanatha at issue who was considerably older than the former. (xxviii) Cakrabhanu (1050-1100 A.D.) A comparative estimate of the various opinions expressed about Cakrabhanu elevates his stature in the eyes of the reader as an eminent Krama author. The problem of his date has already been settled by us in the foregoing pages. 'He seems to have flourished around the second half of the eleventh century. It is to be regretted that no work of his either in reference, manuscript or print has come down today. Hence it is extre-mely difficult to ascertain the magnitude and nature of his contribution. A few scattered allusions to him are one's only-guide. With him the main human pedigree (Manavaugha) of teachers comes to an end and an intra-human series of disciples (Sisyaugha) begins. He enjoys an position of unchallenged superiority among all the persons that constitute the chain of the Advayasampatti, since Vamananatha wrote another commentary in addition to the existing one by somebody else, and (vi) the commen-tary also went by the name of the original text as the two extracts cited by Sivopadhyaya prove. This is all that may be said at present."},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"184 The Krama Tantricism of Kashmir disciples (Sisyaugha).1 He was possibly a student of Hrasva-natha, because he belongs to the tradition of Soma,2 the grand pupil of the former, and because the former had six pupils one of them being Bhojaraja, the teacher of Somaraja.3 The envi-able status enjoyed by Cakrabhanu among the tradition of the disciples is possible only when he is at the helm of the tradition. That this is so has been confirmed by Sitikantha4 and the Cidgaganacandrika.5 Since Somaraja is separated from Hrasva-natha by one generation, Cakrabhanu together with Bhojaraja in all probability be a pupil of Hrasvanatha. Although he belonged to a different tradition from one subscribed to by Jayaratha and Mahesvarananda etc., he came direct in the original tradition of Keyuravati.6 As after Keyura-vati etc , many a tradition became afloat within the precincts of the Krama system, Cakrabhanu might be associated with one of those traditions. He, through tradition, might be linked with any of the three unnamed disciples of Keyuravati,7 since the whereabouts of other remaining three are well known. Cakrabhanu had eight pupils, himself being the master of them. Amongst these a lady ascetic called Isana was respons-ible for a fresh tradition which continued uninterrupted till the time of Sitikantha.8 His (Cakrabhanu's) role as a Krama teacher has elicited extreme admiration from Sitikantha.9 Till the time of Jayaratha his importance had blurred the precise view of his actual contribution, so much so that his pupil Bhutiraja was confused with one of the same name who 2.

Jayaratha even goes to the extent of decrying the claim of Bhutiraja as a pupil of Cakra-bhanu. Cakrabhanu's abstinence from such type of teaching has been the main source of confusion and consequently numerous interpretations of his views.2 Thus the respective stands taken by Jayaratha and Siti-kantha tend to appear paradoxical. In view of the weighty collateral evidence frequently referred to, it is difficult to agree with Jayaratha that he never taught anybody. He, therefore, might be construed to mean that Cakrabhanu never taught any Bhutiraja and thus the paradox be tentatively reconciled. Possi-bly this will be a more reasonable attitude towards Jayaratha too. (xxix) Cakrapani (1050-1100/1075-1125 A.D.) According to the original plan Cakrapani was to be discussed among the authors of the next generation, but this deviation appears necessary in view of the foregoing discussion impelling us to hazard certain suggestions in the context. The Research Department of Kashmir Government has brought out as the 14th volume of Kashmir Series of Texts and Studies a work called Bhavopahara ascribed to one Cakrapani with a commentary by Ramyadeva. The Bhavopahara, on going through its contents, transpires to be a Krama stotra. Ramya-deva's commentary totally actuated by the Krama ideology leaves no doubt about it. Its precise philosophical views have been fully taken into account at appropriate occasions luring the course of philosophical treatment. Ramyadeva, in the open-ing verses of his commentary3 and in his commentary4 on the"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"186   The Krama Tantricism of Kashmir last verse1 of the Stotra, gives out the name of the author of the Stotra as Cakrapani who has been variously called Cakranatha and Cakresa etc. Coming to the personal details and time of Cakrapani one finds a veil of mystery surrounding it. Let us try to pierce through it. The commentator of the work is Ramyadeva who refers to a work of his son also.2 Now both of these, father and son, are described by Mankha as members of his brother's (Lankaka's) intellectual club.3 Ramyadeva, therefore, appears to be a senior contemporary of Mankha (1125-1175 A.D.) and may be assigned to the twelfth century (1100-1150 A.D.). The Bhavopahara, in the fitness of things, would precede this period, that is, the lower limit of the Bhavopahara's period would not go below 1075-1125 A.D. The work cannot be much older, because no Krama author beyond Devabhatta (1025-1075 A.D.) takes note of it. Moreover the language of the Stotra and the contents both have a greater imprint of mysticism and esoteric symbolism which are definitely signs of the later phase of the Krama system. During this period there is only one person, except Cakra-pani, who has the word Cakra forming part of his name. He is Cakrabhanu. He is a known Krama author. Will it, there-fore, be incongruous and without basis to identify Cakrapani with Cakrabhanu? Cakrabhanu's time is about 1050-1100 A.D. Cakrapani's probable time is not later than 1075-1125 A.D. Thus a gap of twentyfive years is not an unbridgeable gap and since there is rather greater certainty about Cakrabhanu's date, it will be better to push the date of Cakrapani slightly back. If this equation be conceded, one would be in a better position to appreciate the creative aspect of Cakrabhanu's genius. 2. B.U.V., p. 6. 3.

A few points of information alone remain to be given here. As seen already, Bhojaraja as the sixth student of Hrasvanatha and a contemporary of Cakrabhanu belongs to the latter half of the eleventh century. He was also known by his other name i.e, Vamanabhanu. Somaraja, from whom Jayaratha quotes, while giving out his preceptorial pedi-gree in two verses figuratively suggests that Bhojaraja perhaps wrote a work, the Kramakamala by name, on the system. Because in both the passages he is portrayed as an adept in letting the Kramakamala, bloom. One knows of a similar title e.g., Kula-kamala, belonging to the Kula system. Hence it is not at all improbable that he might have written some such work. He was a man of high spiritual attainments.1 Sri Braj Vallabha Dwivedi in his essay on the Tripura Darsana2 raises an important question in this regard. According to him, the Rjuvimarsini by Sivananda refers to one Dipakanatha who was ostensibly influenced by Bhojaraja. This Dipakanatha is one among the Tripura teachers preceding Jayaratha. According to the Tripura tradition, Dipakanatha is posterior to Dharmacarya who is the author of the Laghustava, and for that matter, the Pancastavi, on the authority of Amrta-nanda, the author of the Saubhagyasudhodaya. The 18th verse of the third Stava has been quoted by Bhojaraja in the fifth chapter of Sarasvatikanthabharana and a verse from the same Stava has also been cited by Mammata in the 10th chapter of"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"188   The Krama Tantricism of Kashmir his Kavya Prakasa. Thus Dharmacarya is definitely anterior to Bhojaraja and Mammata. His successor (not necessarily imme-diate) Dipakanatha is said to have been demonstrably influenced by Bhojaraja. Now the question is who is this Bhojaraja - the author of the Sarasvatikanthabharana or a different one. Mr. Dwivedi has raised an important problem. It is diffi-cult to say that the problem can be answered easily. Yet, an annexure may be added to the question itself. From the above presentation it is definite that whosoever this Bhojaraja might be, he does belong to the same period as do Dipakanatha etc. The author of the Sarasvatikanthabharana and the Tattva-prakasika (a Saiva Siddhanta text) is identified with the king Bhoja of Dhara whose period is taken to be 1010-1060 A.D. by Smith.1 Now this Bhojaraja, the Krama author, has been assigned above to the period 1050-1100 A.D. It is, however, not definitely known whether all these Bhojas are one or different. But as a hypothesis one must consider the issue if Bhojaraja, the Krama author, can lay any claim to influencing Dipakanatha. In the history of the tantric system, however, such cross-influences or synthetic personalities do not present an unusual spectacle. (xxxi) Somaraja (1075-1125 A.D.) Somaraja came next to Hrasvanatha, his teacher, in order of succession. He probably wrote a work which included the details of his preceptorial ancestry. The two verses cited and ascribed by Jayaratha2 to him are probably from this work. He was the last teacher in the tradition that came direct from Sivananda3 and was punctuated with the teachers of the emine-nce of Cakrabhanu. He had a son who later transmitted the mysteries of the system to the author of the Cidgaganacandrika4 He, as discussed earlier, may be assigned to the close of the eleventh and beginning of the twelfth century. 1.

The Paramesthi guru of Jayaratha is mentioned only once and a verse is also attributed to him by Jayaratha.1 In fact the verse is very popular among the authors of Kashmir Saivism and appears in many a text as a benedictory verse. Jayaratha gives the three interpretations of the first verse of the Tantraloka in accordance with its bearings upon the Kula and Krama systems and Abhinava's parentage respectively. It is in the context of the second i.e., Krama interpretation, that the verse is cited in support of his presentation of the Ultimate Aware-ness technically called Anakhya. Fortunately Jayaratha gives in full both of his genealogies2 - parental as well as preceptorial. In the line of his teachers one finds only one person, Visvadatta, who could perhaps be equated with Jayaratha's Paramesthi guru in question.3 Visva-datta is the father of Tribhuvanadatta and the grandfather of Subhatadatta who is credited with having performed Jaya-ratha's initiation. If one puts the two genealogies side by side, it will be apparent that Visvadatta was a contemporary of the two great grandfathers of Jayaratha, namely, Gunaratha and Devaratha. They themselves were grandsons of Utpalaratha who was a minister of the king Ananta (1028-1063 A.D.) and their eldest uncle Sivaratha was a minister of king Ucchala (1101-1111 A.D.).

When he attained the age, Utpalaratha got a residence erected for him opposite the temple constructed by some Kanakadatta and gave him sufficient resources - movable and immovable both - in order to relieve him from worldly worries.4 It was this Visvadatta who is possibly referred to as Jayaratha's greatgrand teacher. It is really striking to observe that from the very beginning the teacher and the taught relationship had been obtaining between the two ancestral lines - one preceptorial and the other parental - of Jayaratha.

The first appears to be an independent work dealing with the Krama system.

From Mankha we know that his name was Losthadeva.7 The fact that his son was mature enough so that his father might quote him leads one to think that Ramyadeva wrote this Vivarana at quite an advanced age. As has been hinted earlier, Ramyadeva was an older con-temporary of Mankha. According to Mankha, Ramyadeva was a man of ascetic temperament. He had thorough command over Vedanta and his action bore the imprints of his thought. He was an extremely proficient and generous teacher. He was"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"Sources and Literature    193    specially at home in the Kathavalli and was a successful expon-ent of the Vedanta text called Istasiddhi. These autobiographi-cal touches no doubt lend special richness to Ramyadeva's manifold personality. It is strange that Mankha does not refer to Ramyadeva's attainments in Krama though he was fully conversant with the system.1 Maybe Mankha is referring to that aspect only with which people were not so conversant, or else Mankha is taking note of only those aspects of the author's personality that won recognition in the intellectual circle. Both, Ramyadeva and his son Losthadeva, are mentioned in the company of Lankaka, Lankata or Alamkara, Mankha's elder brother.2 Lankaka was a minister statesman under the king Sussala of Kashmir (1112-1127 A.D.).3 The Raja-tarangini refers to him as a man of martial achievements.4 Mankha was an officer-in-charge of state administration under king Jayasimha, the son and successor of Sussala.5 The reign of Jayasimha falls between 1126-1159 A.D. Thus the literary circle of his elder brother must have been a long affair spread over 1112-1159 A.D. Since Ramyadeva is mentioned along with his son, he must be of ripe age when an audience took place between him and Alamkara.

Being tortured by worldly trammels he diverted his attention from poetry to spiritualism. His work pertaining to Krama might be a product of this period. Mankha has spoken highly of his linguistic accomplish-ment.

The time of the author of the Cidgaganacandrika is not so puzzling as his identity. The Candrika is a commentary des-cribed as Pancika by him, on the Krama Stotra of Siddhanatha. And in autobiographical references he too introduces himself as Kalidasa.2 The proposition ascribing the Candrika's author-ship to Kalidasa has been reiterated and echoed several times.3 In addition, the last line of the second opening verse is practi-cally the same as the last line of the opening verse of the Malavikagnimitra of Kalidasa.4 These factors have led the editor of the Calcutta edition of the Cidgaganacandrika to con-cede its authorship to Kalidasa.5 Karra Agnihotra Sastri, the erudite modern commentator on the text, fully endorses the"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"196   The Krama Tantricism of Kashmir views of Svami Trivikrama Tirtha, the editor of the Calcutta edition. Besides, Sastri advances a few more arguments in favour of his contention.1 As his entire methodology consists in finding analogues between the present and the original Kalidasa and interpreting them to suit his convictions, it is not very relevant for us to go into whole of it here. However, to cite an instance, he finds an implicit reaffirmation of the Abhijnana-sakuntala's eightfold Purls in the eightfold structure of the Vrnda-cakra. Even to the last verse, where the name of some Srivatsa occurs, he accords an entirely mystic interpre-tation taking him as a crest of meaning called Srivatsa. This is the verse which is of key importance in connection with the authorship-issue. The only difference between Sastri and Trivikrama Tirtha revolves round the identity of this Kalidasa. The former insists that the present Kalidasa is identical with the original one,2 while the latter is prepared to concede to the existence of some later Kalidasa who seems to have flourished before Abhinavagupta.3 The testimony of the tradition also lends weighty support to the present thesis. The passages from the Cidgaganacandrika quoted by Bhaskararaya in his commentary famed as Saubhagya-bhaskara on the Lalitasahasranama have been acknowledged by him to be the assertions of Kalidasa occasionally with reference to the name of this text.4 Similarly, Sastri has invoked the support of a Tantric text called Hrdayacandrika by Kavi Cakra-vartin which explicitly identifies the author of the Cidgagana--andrika with Kalidasa.5 But it must be frankly stated that a host of scholars, who have profusely quoted from the text in 1.

Among these are Mahesvarananda,1 Amrtanandanatha2 and Kaivalyasrama.3 A modern student, however, finds it difficult to swallow the claim for the original Kalidasa's authorship of the Cidgagana-candrika. To begin with, the author mentions some Siva as a pioneer of the preceptorial line, Cakrabhanu as an eminent teacher and Soma as the concluding figure of the lineage to which the author pledges his allegiance. The author received his tuitions in Krama from the son of Soma. It simply means that he is not the legendary Kalidasa, but a different person. Cakrabhanu and Somaraja, and for that matter his son, more or less have a definite chronological status that puts them within a century's bracket running from 1050 to 1150 A.D. as they come in preceptorial hierarchy. Even the earliest limit cannot go beyond the tenth century, because the author of the Krama Stotra i.e., Siddhanatha, belongs to the first half of the tenth century. But since the author maintains direct doctrinal and scholastic affiliation to Cakrabhanu etc , his date need not be pushed back from the point of actual occurrence which falls in the vicinity of the temporal bracket mentioned above. Besides, the earliest references made to this work are by Mahesvara-nanda who belongs to the close of the twelfth and beginning of the thirteenth century. Therefore his date cannot be advanced either, barring the modifications by a margin of 25 to 50 years on each side. Had he flourished much earlier, the early texts could not afford to ignore him altogether. Therefore, on every count, the present author is different from the great poet. Coming to the other aspect of the question, let us try to find out who this Kalidasa was. 1. MM.P., pp. 27, 53, 71, 73, 93,94, 96, 99, 102, 103, 104,110,124, 130, 154, 167. 2.

However, from the historical perspective, many authors have quite frequently allowed to envelop their true personalities due to this practice in India. In order to cater to his vanity it has been natural for an author to emphasise his title as compared with his name. The present thesis with regard to the Candrika's author-ship becomes more convincing, if something with regard to the historicity of the author named Srivatsa be available. Fortu-nately, exactly during this period, one Srivatsa arrests one's attention. Mankha refers to a pair of the two celibates namely Bhudda and Srivatsa3 in course of his description of the literary circle of his brother and heaps an exceedingly high praise on both of them for unparalleled poetic richness and beauty of their verses - as if the Goddess Muse herself put a stamp on the wealth of their poetic art. Mankha, being a con-temporary of king Jayasimha (1127-1151 A.D.) is ascribed to the second and third quarters of the twelfth century. Srivatsa, too, therefore, would belong to the same period.

He was known as Kalidasa for his literary genius. The verse containing the line from the Malavikagnimitra is spurious and a later interpolation. He was a pupil of Soma's son who perhaps was also known as Gupta.1 He belonged to Purnapitha, the centre of his spiritual activity, where he wrote this Pancika on the Krama Stotra.2 The whole work, according to the author, comprises three hundred and nine verses in traistubha metre.3 However, there are in all three hundred and twelve verses in the printed edition and the first two verses are not in the above metre. Thus the total number of verses in the above metre amounts to three hundred and ten and if the last verse pertaining to the author himself is excluded, the total corresponds to the figure mentioned by the author.

Since this view was conveyed to Jayaratha by his teacher, Ojaraja might have been a predecessor or contemporary of the former's teacher. His date is quite uncertain.

The only drawback that has obscured his exuberant personality is the non-availability of his works in print. In him one is able to trace a systematic deve-lopment of the post-Ksemaraja form of the Krama system for which Mahesvarananda fully leans on him.

One may, in other words, still say that their contribution was immense and so powerful that they succeeded in evolving a sort of Southern school of the Krama system - though it is not stated nor claimed anywhere.

The other work i.e., the Stotrabhattaraka,4 as well as the Mahanaya-prakasa5 have been frequently quoted by Mahesvarananda.

(iii) The Samvit-stotra has been ascribed to his grand tea-cher by Mahesvarananda. Hence, by implication, these two works should also be credited to the same authorship. (iv) Mahesvarananda's reticence with regard to the two works is suggestive, yet it is not necessarily a negative gesture. Because in the case of the Sambhavaikya-dipika it was pointed out that it is also a work of Sivananda, the grand teacher of Mahesvarananda, in spite of the fact that he (Mahesvarananda) keeps silent about its authorship, too. (v) The work named Stotrabhattaraka cannot be dismissed as spurious1 since (a) it has been quoted by Mahes-varananda as well as Jayaratha2 besides Sivananda, and (b) there is complete correspondence between the Mahanayaprakasa and the Stotrabhattaraka on the issues e.g., the thirteen Kalis, unity of Prakasa and Ananda, Mantra as Supreme awareness, etc.3 (vi) Sivananda in his Rjuvimarsini has elevated Prakrta as the official language of the Tripura school. This view was endorsed and its application extended to the Krama system by Mahesvarananda.4 There is an unmistakable evidence to suggest that the Mahanaya-prakasa was written originally in vernacular (Bhasaya 1. Abhi., pp. 478-479. 2. T.A.V., III. p. 223. 3. M.M.P., pp. 105, 116, 127. 4.

(vii) Even if, for a second, this authorship-equation is not granted there is absolutely no doubt that both - the author of the Samvit-stotra, as well as that of the Mahanayaprakasa - occupy the same point on chrono-logical scale because the author of the latter refers to the former and the grandson of the author of the former refers to the latter. In fact this historical coincidence in point of time is additional evidence in favour of the present contention establishing identity of the two. In this connection one may agree with Dr. Pandey2 in rejecting the ascription of the Mahanayaprakasa to Abhinava-gupta by Sambasiva Sastri.3 The contention is utterly untenable in the face of the Mahanayaprakasa clearly betraying the influ-ence of Ksemaraja.4 Let us now revert to the period of Sivananda. The latest author referred to by Sivananda is Ksemaraja in the Rjuvimar-sini.5 The books referred to are the Sambapancasika and Pratya-bhijna-hrdaya Sutra. The precise implication is that Ksema-raja marks Sivananda's upper time-limit. Amrtananda, the author of the Dipika on the Yogini Hrdaya and a pupil of Punya-nanda, refers to the Subhagodayavasana (i.e., Krama-vasana) of Sivananda.8 Although Amrtananda's time has not been finally 2.

It is, therefore, neces-sary that whatever probable period of Sivananda's existence one may arrive at, it must account for both of them. Sivananda is removed from Mahesvarananda only by a generation. Since the latter refers to the Cidgaganacandrika, his upper limit must be determined by this fact, that is, Mahesvarananda cannot belong to an earlier period than 1125-1175 A.D. On the other hand, Sivananda, by virtue of his being alluded to by Jayaratha, is not supposed to cross the period 1150-1200 A.D. In other words the upper limit of Sivananda does not extend beyond 1075-1125 A.D. (As it is 1125-1175 A.D. for Mahesvarananda) The lower limit of Sivananda is almost decided, as noted above. Hence Sivananda must flourish somewhere between 1075-1125 A.D. to 1125-1200 A.D. In order that Jayaratha might be able to refer to him he must be placed, at least by a generation above Jayaratha i.e., 1125-1175 A.D.

The last verse of his Viveka on the Tantraloka proclaims him to be a thinker of pro-found merit and matchless standing in Krama in addition to all the then important branches of learning.3 And it is not a boastful or conceited statement, since it is well known that his contribution covers a vast field ranging from all the schools under Kashmir Saivism and Tripura System to literature.

Jayaratha probably understood the value of viewing a scholar, for fuller appreciation, against his historical background. He, therefore, provides us with a suffi-ciently detailed account of his ancestral as well as preceptorial lineage which may be given in these tables.3 (see pp. 211, 212) From these tables it may be clear that his time poses no difficulty. The dates of his three ancestors are known. From Utpalaratha II (1028-63 A.D.) he is away by four genera-tions and from Sivaratha (1101-11 A.D.) he is separated by three generations. Srngararatha, his father and a minister of Raja-raja, who is generally identified with king Jayasimha (1127-1151 AD.), is succeeded by him immediately. On the preceptor-ial plane, he is removed by two generations from Visvadatta, his great-grand teacher and a younger contemporary of Utpala-ratha II (1028-1063 A.D.), who brought the former up after the death of his father. After giving due allowance for the inter-vening generations, he may be safely assigned to the second half of the twelfth century (i.e.,1150-1200 A.D.). This is further confirmed by the fact that he in his Vimarsini refers to the Prthvirajavijaya4 of Jayanaka. According to the general consensus of historians Prthviraja died in the year 1193 A.D. and before his death the work had been written. This is vindi-cated still further by the fact that Jayaratha wrote his Vimar-sini on the Alamkara Sarvasva of Ruyyaka who was a senior (Seep. 211) 2.

This attempt of his reflects the impact of the Tantraloka which marks an essay in synthesis and not in isolated analysis of the Trika systems. His original name was Goraksa, but on his baptism he was named Mahesvarananda3 by his teacher. He is apparently different from his various namesakes in tantric philosophy.* The traditional Krama philosophy was inherited by him and he came direct in the line of the Krama teachers.5 He hailed from Cola, modern Karnatak, on the banks of Kaveri (southern Mysore).

As mentioned by him, he travelled far and wide in almost every direction before he took to writing the Maharthamanjari.3 He belongs to the close of the twelfth or the beginning of the thirteenth century (1175-1225 A.D.).

Regarding the rest of the works that comprise Kundalabharana, Mukundakeli and Nakhapra-tapa, the absence of extracts therefrom and Mahesvarananda's wholesale taciturnity make it extremely difficult to be definite about them. But the contextual evidence does demonstrate his emphasis on the literary merit of these works.2 Probably these were the pieces of literature. Although the Komalavallistava and Parimala have also figured in along with these, they have been shown to be Krama works. The Maharthamanjari was the practical realization of a divine vision. The story has it that he was impelled by a Yogini, in whom he visualized Kalasamkarsini, to undertake the writing of the Maharthamanjari.3 Obviously, according to Prof. A.N.

Paduka is identical with the Power-absolute which consists in pure bliss and tends to eliminate the sense of duality between self and notself.3 It is purely a Krama concept.4 Mahesvarananda has considerably influenced the subsequent tantric literature. For instance, Sivopadhyaya leans on him for supporting his several statements.5 Ramesvara, the commentator on Parasu-rama-kalpa-sutra, refers to him on no less than three occasions.6 Kaivalyasrama quotes from his Parimala in the Saubhagyavar-dhini on the Ananda-Lahari,7 Rajanakalaksmirama, an 18th cen-tury commentator on Paratrimsika quotes the Maharthamanjari in his commentary styled as lagku-Vrtti.8 Saubhagyavardhi i also refers to some Parastotra and cites from it.9 It is not known if it was identical with one composed by our author. It is to be noted that Jayarasi Bhatta, the author of the Tattvopaplava-simha styles his work as the Maharthodaya.10 But it is definitely a different work, because (i) Jayarasi Bhatta is much anterior to Mahesvarananda, and (ii) the work by the former is addressed to the Lokayata system, whereas the latter's deals with the Krama system.

He is remotely blood-related to Jagaddhara. He is son of the daughter's daughter of the great-grandson of Jagaddhara.1 And he wrote his Nyasa during the reign of Hasan Shah, the son of Haider Shah.2 Sri Mahavira Prasad Dwivedi basing his conclusions on the various statements of the Nyasa points out that before he undertook to write the Nyasa, he visited Gujarat and was warmly received by the king Mohammad Shah.3 According to the Kasmirakusuma by Hariscandra, Husain Shah came to throne in 4583 Kali year equivalent to 1482 A.D. This date is confirmed, with slight modification, by Srivara who puts the period of reign of Hasan Shah from 1472 to 1484 A.D.4 and, according to the Rasamala,5 Mohammad Shah ruled over Gujarat from 1458 to 1511 A.D. On the basis of these historical data it is easy to find out his place in the chronology. He had visited Gujarat before he wrote his commentary; and while he started writing, king Hasan Shah was at the helm. Hence he must have begun his work by 1480-82 A.D. Allowing a margin of about thirty years for intellectual equipment he may be assigned to the latter half of the loth century. That is, he seems to have flourished during 1450-1500 A.D.

Not much is known about Bhattaraka except that he was the author of the work named Prakrtatrimsika-vivarana. The frequent discussion on the nature of the Vrndacakra was the main feature of the book3 - this is all that Sivopadhyaya tells us. The fact that the text primarily deals with the Vrnda-cakra is enough to prove that it was a Krama text. From the pattern of the title of the text, it may be conjured up that it was probably an exposition of some text in Pakrta language modelled on the pattern of the Para Trimsika in Sanskrit. Since it is from Sivopadhyaya's reference that one comes to know of him, he may be tentatively placed prior to Sivopadhyaya who is assigned to the period 1725-1775 A.D.

He belonged to Kasthula province of Kashmir which, though escaping a definite identification, was a village or township on the banks of Jhelam (Vitasta)1.

Naturally, Sivopadhyaya is fully justified in his extra emphasis on the class-title, because it reflected his still higher social status and superb intellectual achievement.1 His time is almost certain. According to him, he com-pleted his commentary on the Vijnana-bhairava when Kashmir was being ruled by King Sukha-Jivana.2 According to historians king Sukhajivana reigned over Kashmir from 1754 to 1762 A.D.

The first type consists of the revealed i.e., Agamic literature and the second includes the works of human authorship. In the first category there are again two subtypes. One pertains to the Agamic Saiva literature of Kashmir in general which every system of the Kashmir Saivism feels impelled to draw upon, and which in its deliberations anticipates many Krama doctrines. The other relates to the exclusive Krama Agamas that are mainly responsible for the rise of divergent traditions with regard to the important Krama theses. Owing to the enormity of the literature of the first type it is not possible to discuss them here, more so in view of their having been resorted to wherever called for in the philosophical part of the thesis. This category includes such esteemed agamas as the Malinivijaya, Sarvajnan-ottara, Brahmayamala, Tantraraja and Kiranagama, etc. etc. The other type comprises the Krama agamas alone. They are but a few in number and the relevance of introducing them need not be questioned. The next category of works includes the works of human origin and though their names are known from references, their authors are not known and the texts are not extant. In view of the importance attached to them in the system, a reference to them seems justified. It is proposed to take up the agamas first and then, the other works. (a) The Krama Agamas Before the discussion of the individual agamas is embark-ed upon, it may be noted that the Krama agamas as such are of a comparatively later date than their counterparts in the general field. In this connection it is also interesting to note that they generally belong to the 'Nigama' class of the tantric classification.

In fact these two classes of agamas in the strict Krama parlance, represent the two tendencies distinguished by their respective emphasis on the supremacy of the either of Siva and Sakti. Let us now advert to the agamas proper in their probable chronological order. (i) Pancasatika or Devipancasatika1 The Pancasatika is one of the earliest or the earliest known Krama agama. Jayaratha explicitly tells us that this agama was known to Somananda.2 Abhinava also seems to have referred to it.3 It was also known as Devipancasatika.4 A fairly definite date can be assigned to it. Since the Pancasatika contains the name of the first four teachers of the Krama including the last one i.e., Sivananda,5 and also since it was known to Soma-nanda also, it may be placed somewhere in between them. 1. It has been included among \"the works of Early Teachers\" by Dr. Pandey, Vide Abhi., pp. 471, 474. But it is not so. That it is an agama is proved by its construction and that it was taken to be so, is esta-blished by Jayaratha's own statement. In a passage quoted from it (T.A.V., iii, p. 181) Devi is the speaker and Siva is being addressed, vide   For a similar passage also see p. 169. Likewise, Jayaratha is very clear on its being an Agama. Vide 5.

It is, therefore, quite likely that this agama would have come up towards the middle of the ninth century. Coming to the views of the Pancasatika one finds that the Rudrakali, which signifies the nature of withdrawal with reference to the means of knowledge in Anakhya cakra, was termed Bhadrakali by it without any change in the meaning.1 One of the important implications of Jayaratha's discussion on the pancasatika is that by including the name of Sukali in the list, the text seems to subscribe to the thirteen-kali theory.2 This marks a sharp contrast from the Kramastotra which sticks to the twelve-kali doctrine. The opponents of Jayaratha object as to how he (Jayaratha) still maintains that the Kramastotra follows the Pancasatika. First, Jayaratha side-tracks the issue by calling attention to the original question - whether or not the Kramastotra adhered to the twelve-kali thesis3 - and then, retorts that if the opponent persists in his accusation he does not even know the meaning of the Pancasatika4. However, this goes to evince amply that its tradition had suffered a great setback by the time of Jayaratha. Even its text started having variants and naturally became liable to varying interpretations. Jayaratha has cited one such instance, while referring to Ojaraja's inter-pretation of a portion of it.5 Besides these it maintained a topsyturvy manner in Sthitikrama so as to hide the real Samvit-krama. In designing Pujakrama the Krama authors rather emulated it.6 Similarly it maintained the separate identity 1. Ibid. p. 173. 2. Ibid., p. 189. 3. T.A.V., III, pp. 190-91, 4. Ibid., p. 194. 5.

And, therefore it always mentioned Sthitikali after Srstikali. On the contrary, in the Kramastotra Rakta-kali and not Sthitikali is made to follow Srstikali. An objection is raised by the opponent as to whether it is not a clear violation of the agamic authority.2 The context makes it abundantly clear that Sardhasatika, too, was an equally authoritative Krama agama as the Pancasatika, otherwise sanction of the same would not have been invoked on an exclusively Krama issue. The only other available reference to it has figured in a similar context.3 It appears to be a fairly old agama. On the basis of dialogue between it and the Pancasatika it may be assigned to the same period subject to future investigations in the field.

It is referred to only once by Abhinava.4 It may, therefore, be"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"233 Sources and Literature concluded that this agama may not be as old as the Pancasatika, but its antiquity does go beyond Abhinava. Abhinava quotes it in a Kula context in order to show how the emphases vary from system to system. In Kula rituals wine is said to be of utmost importance. But, the Krama-rahasya is represented to hold the other view and, instead, attaches the supreme impor-tance to the trio of Arghapatra, Yagadhama and Dipa Now which else can this other system be? Obviously it ought to be Krama as is suggested by the very nomenclature of the text. That it belonged to the agama's category is confirmed by the fact that it was the Lord Himself who expounded this view in the Krama-rahasya. Perhaps, it mainly concentrated on the ritualistic part of the system. (iv) Kramasadbhava The Krama-sadbhava is again an agama of the Nigama type, because it is in the form of a dialogue between Parvati and Siva.1 Authors of the rank and file of Abhinavagupta, Jayaratha, Mahesvarananda and Sitikanthacarya have referred to it. It was possibly known as Krama also. While reasoning out the necessity of the removal of doubt, Abhinava looks up to the agamas as well. Among the other agamas the name of the Krama also appears.2 Jayaratha's immediate interpretation of the word is in terms of the Krama philosophy, but soon after he quotes from each agama at issue and it is the Krama-The address \"Mahadeva\" may be noted.

Consequently this agama, too, belongs to the period preceding Abhinava. By the time of Jayaratha, people appear to have lost direct touch with the text. Evidently some confusion prevailed in respect of its actual stand on the number of Kalis to be adored in Anakhya-cakra. At one place, while invoking its authority in support of the Sodasara Cakra Jayaratha takes their number to be sixteen,4 while at other place the statement ascribed to it recognizes their number to be seventeen.5 Due to the unity of their source it is difficult to know today what its actual stand was. Yet, it is sure that it did not agree with the projected number of the deities at twelve or thirteen. Despite the controversy with regard to the real allegiance of the Kramastotra, there is no doubt that the Kramastotra took a different line from that of the Kramasadbhava The view, therefore, that the Stotrakara closely followed this agama is erroneous and misleading.6 It coined a few phrases to describe"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"Sources  and  Literature  235  certain deities. Thus Sthitikali is termed as Sthiti-nasakali1 and Bhadrakali as Rudrakali.2 According to Sitikantha, the Kramasadbhava discussed Vrnda Cakra in detail.3 This is borne out by at least one passage, cited from it by Mahesvarananda, that deals with the Patakrama under Vrndacakra.4 The Krama Sadbhava is quoted again in support of his view that the order of the five functions of the Absolute, in which they ought to be worshipped, begins with Creation and ends with Bhasa.5 A few minor views also have been ascribed to the Kramasadbhava, which are not referred to here.6 (v) Kalikakrama The utterances quoted from the Kalikakrama are marked by their genuine philosophical aptitude unnoticed in any of the agamas discussed so far. It is the reason why Ksemaraja7 quotes so profusely from it in his Vimarsini on the Sivasutras 6. Ibid., pp. 88, 101. 7.

Among the later authors are included Yogaraja, Sivananda (the author of the Mahanayaprakasa), Jayaratha and Mahesvarananda. The work also passed in the name of the Devikakrama. For, while quoting the some passage as hinted above, Mahesvarananda attributes it to the Devikakrama.2 The very first look at the extracts conveys the impression of their being from some philosophical treatise and not from an Agama. But a passage cited from it by Ksemaraja3 leaves no scope for doubting its agamic character. In this extract the work is said to be of divine origin, that is, the philosophical truths herein are revealed by Bhairava. Coining to its time some broad outlines may be indicated. Till Abhinava there is no trace of the work; it is learnt from Ksemaraja for the first time. Since Ksemaraja claims to have received all his knowledge from Abhinava, it may be surmised that Abhinava at least knew of it. Even otherwise, the text might be contemporaneous with or slightly later than Abhinava, because one has already seen that Vimarsini is the last work of Ksemaraja. As to its philosophical contents, one may begin with the most famous passage to which attention has been drawn. As its first premise it declares the entire manifold - whether in-ternal or external - to be of the nature of pure awareness. It is awareness that assumes the form of respective objects."},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"Sources and Literature   237   Nobody has even visualised the objective world unless it has become a fact of his experience. Since awareness does not proceed without its object, just as affirmation is meaningless without negation; and, since the two are always simultaneously realised, the awareness and its object are bound to be one in essence. It is why the Krama system views the objective variety as an expression of the Absolutic dynamism.1 In another similarly popular passage it draws one's attention to the nature of the Absolute as supreme awareness and that of its power, called Vimarsa, as omniscience. In fact the two cannot be visualised analytically. Thus the process of Japa, if undertaken by a yogin, transpires to be self-reflection on the self-divinity.2 In a similar strain it is insisted upon that one, who could realize knowledge - without its referent and -as consisting in self-consciousness, achieves true freedom even during the embodied span of life.3 Ignorance and knowledge, both being the manifestations of the ultimate reality, the talk of destruction of either is meaningless. Because, even when the interplay of nescience is said to have been eliminated, the real nature of it remains intact.

A yogin is advised to pierce through this great illusion of duality so as to attain the real fruit of the yoga.2 In fact, the entire objective paraphernalia beginning with the categories of the pure order such as Siva etc. is the logical corollary of the loss of knowledge coupled with the rise of mental constructions. And all the good or bad objects stem from the same. What one calls evil, leads one to pain and hell because of its character as sheer intellectual fabrication.3 It is, therefore, imperative for one to eliminate all the empiri-cal as well as imaginary associations (Vrtti), to rest on the inner plane, to relinquish the empirical network of mental constructs through one's monistic attitude, and then to remain self-composed and ever prepared to kill the element of time, if he cares to reach the highest stage of his existence consisting in freedom.

(vi) Krama-siddhi The Kramasiddhi is an agama of a later origin. It is difficult to ascertain its exact period but it was known to none of Abhinava, Ksemaraja and Jayaratha. Throughout the history of the Krama thought it is Mahesvarananda alone who draws our attention to it.2 It, therefore, appears likely that the work did not come into light until the lapse of the 1lth century. The lower limit may further be stretched upto the time of Jayaratha. It may also interest one to note that even in later Krama or other tannic literature one does not hear of this work. It, therefore, must have been a minor work. It chose the form of a dialogue between two - the God and the Goddess. But it is doubtful who really played the role of teacher and who that of disciple. Because, of all the four extracts cited by Mahesvarananda only two have some bearing on this point. In one Siva is addressed by Devi who imparts to him the secrets of the Samvitkrama.3 whereas in the other Siva is approached by Devi and he tells her the esoteric S.S.Vi., pp. 133-34. 2.

Certain other views, beside those described above, have come down to us. There were varying opinions about the pre-cise order of the five flows (Pancavaha) of the Universal Energy. The order followed by Mahesvarananda was the one laid down by the Kramasiddhi.2 The question has been fully considered in connection with this study on the Pancavaha. In another passage, the Kramasiddhi is represented to have prescribed a specific type of the Patakrama. The Patakrama is one of the constituents of the eightfold approach to the Vrnda Cakra. The Pata consists in finding out the basic iden-tity between Pancavaha and Vrndacakra. But the same may be found to consist in the identity between the five siddhas namely, Jnanasiddhas etc., and the five Absolutic functions ranging from Srsti to Bhasa.3 He also explains the logic behind naming a particular power.

The milk, though present in whole of a cow's body, drips down through her udder only. Likewise, the power of the Lord is all-pervasive and all-inclusive, yet it spreads fully through one power.1 All these concepts predominate the later phase of the Krama system. This also testifies to its recency in origin. With this agama one comes to the close of the Krama list of the agamas. But this simply shows the limitations of our knowledge and information at this stage. Numerous refer-ences, made to and extracts quoted from the anonymous sources, simply labelled as the agama,2 will perhaps bear out the above statement. In this connection it may also be pointed out that the agamas named Brahmayamala, Tantraraja Bhattaraka etc., have not been included among the Krama agamas, as has been done in certain quarters.3 Because in the first place, they belong to the general category of agamas and, in the second place, the contents of the manuscript of the Brahmayamala, available in the library of Asiatic Society of Bengal4 and the study made by John Woodroffe of the Tantraraja5 do not present them as exclusive Krama agamas. It is of course a different matter that they do contain useful material on the Krama system too, but not as the Krama system as such but as a part of the wider tantra literature.

It was probably written in the Sutra style as the title and the two extracts go to show. The most significant thing about it seems that it was originally written in the own vernacular of the author.1 The necessary implication being that the Sanskrit version or rendering cited by him was done either by him or was done in his time. If this hypothesis be true, the Krama-Sutra in its original form might have been an older text than Abhinava. But, in any case, it must belong to the same period as Abhinava does. This also shows that the trend of composing the Krama works in vernaculars, which later on was acknowledged to be a salient feature of the Krama literature, had its seeds in the early stages of the Krama history. The first of the two Sutras quoted by Ksemaraja asks the aspirant to consume the objects of the sense which act like fetters, just as the fire set ablaze consumes fuel.2 The second Sutra lays down the twofold path towards self-realization. The first, which is characterized by inwardness, is known as the Krama Mudra. This consists in turning from the outward to the inward. The second, which is called Mudra-krama, consists in looking from the inward to the outward, that is, in looking upon the worldly objectivity as an expansion of the inner self.3 Both these types are the spontaneous outcome of Samavesa. The second Sutra has been commented upon by Ksemaraja.4 Mahesvarananda also"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"Sources and Literature    243    refers to the second Sutra and quotes it together with its expla-nation by Ksemaraja.1 But it looks quite feasible that Mahesva-rananda did not have the actual text before him, because he does not appear to quote from the original itself but from the Pratyabhijnahrdaya instead, which contains both the Sutras as well as its exposition. Moreover, he does not add a word of his own to it. (ii) Siddhasutra It is referred to only once in the Mahanayaprakasa (T). There were two traditions with regard to the proper order in which the various cycles were supposed to succeed one another for the purpose of worship One of the traditions placed Ana-khyacakra immediately after Vrnda-cakra and discarded the worship of the three cycles such as Srsti etc. This was probably the tradition followed by Jayaratha etc. One may infer this from Jayaratha's criticism of the Mahanayaprakasa's attitude as representing opponent's tradition. The Mahanayaprakasa did not agree with his view and maintained that after Vrnda-cakra these cycles must be worshipped in order to ensure the total completion of Pujana that results in acquisition of the tremend-ous capacity. In this context the Siddha-Sutra is quoted in support.2 It holds that the worship of all these cakras leads to the attainment of the Khecara state. And as a secondary out-come of the self-knowledge one is able to command the Siddhis like Anima etc. on their own accord. In this connection it is to be specially noted that Siti-kantha also refers to the Subhasita (pithy or noble sayings) of some Siddha.3 He has quoted some Siddhapada earlier. Both,"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"244   The Krama Tantricism of Kashmir however, appear to be one, owing to the identity of the extracts attributed to them. It is not known if the Siddha-sutras have to do anything with the Siddha-subhasitas, if one is permitted to present them in this way. The only hurdle seems to be the language. Because, the Subhasitas have been composed in Prakrta, whereas the Siddhasutra is apparently a Sanskrit work. However, this is left out as an unsettled question. The work, in question, belongs to a later date. Siva-nanda II, the author of Mahanayaprakasa (T) is assigned to the second and third quarter of the twelfth century. The work, therefore, may be assigned to a slightly earlier period. (iii) Mahanaya-paddhati It was a minor work and is referred to only once by Mahesvarananda.1 It is quoted to substantiate the contention that the external formalities amount to plain mockery. According to it, the strong and abiding reflection on the ultimate reality unobscured by anything constitutes the genuine form of worship. This is a peculiar Krama thesis. In addition, the title of the text goes to prove its Kramic complexion. It might be chronologically slightly anterior to Mahesvarananda who alone refers to it. (iv) Kramodaya The Kramodaya seems to be an important work. Two extracts from it appear in the Parimala on the Maharthaman-jari.2 Amrtananda in his Yogini-hrdayadipika3 refers to it twice, though citing the same passage. Bhaskaracarya in the Setuban-dha4 commentary on the above also alludes to the work repeating the quotation just mentioned. 2. MM.P., pp. 50, 87. 3. Y.H.D., pp. 266, 283. 4.

However, in one passage it refers to the five limiting conditions of the individual subject as such as Raga, Kala etc., due to which the universal self appears as personal self.1 In the other, he calls upon the aspirant to perform Duti-yaga before he embarks upon the worship of nine powers stationed in the body.2 The stress on ritualism was so predominant that fivefold esoteric worship (Pancamakara) seems to have overshadowed other things. Like sex in the former, wine occupies a place of emi-nence in yet another extract. According to it once the liquor, which is a sort of final oblation (Purnahuti) and is defined by harmony of 'I' and 'this' experience, gets in, it obliterates the duality; and the resulting pleasure comes to persist even though there is visibly no object to cause pleasure.3 Hence, it is meant to suggest that one should worship the external cycles only when one's mind has become stable and poised.

Mahesvarananda also refers to the Mahanayaprakasa. That means the two were different works. Now the question is which is the borrower. The whole situation is confusing. The answer depends upon another question - which work is earlier? If the kramodaya is earlier the Mahanayaprakasa must have borrowed from it, and if later, the Kramodaya must be the borrower. But, since (i) Sivananda II the author of the Mahanayaprakasa, belongs to the 2nd and 3rd quarters of the 12th century, (ii) the Kramodaya is earliest referred to towards the close of the 12th or the begin-ning of the 13th century, and (iii) the verse in question is a part of the text and fits well in the context and conforms to the construction of the text, one may be tempted, for the time-being, to conclude that it is Kramodaya which appears to have borrowed from the Mahanayaprakasa(T). (v) Amavasyatrimsika The Amavasyatrimisika seems to be an important text of the age of decadence. It was produced during the lull between Mahesvarananda and Sitikantha who refers to it.2 What was the real purport behind such nomenclature is a matter of guess today. Either it contained thirty verses or. like the Paratrimsika, dealt with the three Absolutic powers. Sitikantha has elsewhere quoted a verse bringing out the etymological meaning of the word Amavasya.3 The verse is self-explanatory.

A perusal of the extract reveals that the book probably owed its name to the three aspects of the ultimate power of the Lord, the three aspects being Will, Knowledge and Action. The present judgement is based on the second verse of the passage. In other words it speaks of the transcendence-plus-immanence, all-perva-siveness, infinitude, ubiquity and equanimity of the Absolute. The innate power of the Lord is all-powerful and. though one in herself, she accounts for the multiplicity by virtue of Her constituting the powers such as Will, Knowledge and Action. But this duality is nothing but functional when She is at work.

(vi) Rajika This seems to be a minor work of very late origin and has been mentioned once only by Sitikantha. As to the nature of the contents, it will suffice to say that it dealt with the real character of the great Yaga, otherwise known as Madhya-yaga also. It has three varieties namely, gross, subtle and the ulti-mate. In the first stage mind, intellect and ego-feeling are withdrawn in order to put an end to the emergence of mental uprisings (Cittavrttis). In the second round the vital airs are withdrawn. Ultimately Prakrti, the principle of pure awareness, makes an anxious present of herself to the Lord finding Him half-satiated. This is the land of unison, harmony. It is in this connection a verse is cited from the Rajika.1 In the Viveka, Jayaratha refers to certain Rahasyarajikayoginis who were blessed, due to the grace of Divinity, with a beatific vision and attainment of true knowledge. What one is not supposed to miss in this context is that Rajikayoginis have been referred to as belonging to the \"different\" system. Since the context is primarily occupied with the Kula system, the 'different' system means \"other than the Kula\". Hence, in the Kula context these Rajikayoginis are to be remembered only and not worshipped.2 It is not known if the Rajikayoginis and the Rajika text are correlated.

I. Overall Perspective of Synthesis between Saiva Metaphysics and Tantricism Throughout all these pages an attempt has been made to point out and gauge the quantum of the contribution made by the Krama system to the cause of metaphysics and mysticism of monism against the background of its twin personalities con-densed into one. These two aspects are its being a part of the philosophical complex known as Kashmir Saivism in the first place and, at the same time, retaining the general Tantric character in the second place. In this section, therefore, our main task would be to see how this synthesis is arrived at. In other words, an effort will be made to examine the perspective in which the sixfold Tantric approach defined by the Arthas is coordinated with or corresponds to the fourfold approach of the Kashmir Saivism spelt by the Upayas And in so doing the place of Krama is to be determined in this perspective. 2. Jayaratha's Consistent Approach to the Problem Mahesvarananda and Jayaratha, the two savants of the Krama system, take up the issue. Mahesvarananda regards the Mahartha or Krama system as the ultimate among all the philosophical disciplines and the culminating point of all the"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"250   The Krama Tantricism of Kashmir six stages of Tantric culture.1 But this is hardly a scientific approach. In fact it is dismissing outright the very issue out of the doctrinal enthusiasm.

Sixfold Artha Defining the Six Approaches to Tantric Understanding The six ways or approaches to the understanding of the Tantra, as outlined by the Yogini-hrdaya, are - (i) Bhavartha. (ii) Sampradayartha, (iii) Nigarbhartha, (iv) Kaulikartha, (v) Sarvarahasyartha, and (vi) Mahatattvartha.3 All being technical concepts it is no use rendering them into the English language. Let us see what they stand for. Jayaratha, at the very outset, cautions that thetraditional-ists should not look for the reproduction of the orthodox and conventional views. He is approaching them entirely from the point of view of their precise implications.4 Except the methodology, he toes the line adopted by the Yogini-hrdaya Tantra.5"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"Krama, its General Tantric Character   251   Bhavartha consists in the literal meaning according to the intention of the speaker at the time. It may even belong to the other sciences than the Tantra proper. The same, despite its externality, is to be regarded as Sampradayartha, if it is meant for enlightenment owing to the exposition of self-knowledge etc. The only conditions it must comply with are that it should be consistent with the Saiva teachings and uncensured by the teachers. Vedic passages like   and   furnish fine examples of the same. But there is one difficulty. The self in the above quoted passages is represented to have shone only once (Sakrdvibhata), whereas Siva is a continuously manifest principle. Similarly, these passages depict the self as knowable (Jnatavya) and thus reduce it to the status of an object. Consequently it would deserve its reference as 'this' instead of 'I', while the self-luminous Siva is always a subject, an agent. According to Jayaratha no funda-mental incongruity is involved here. In fact, Siva, the principle of reality, never forsakes its agenthood even when he manifests the objectivity within because the objective multiplicity is an . expression of his unfettered freedom. Since Siva himself be-comes an object, there is no discrepancy if he is referred to by 'this' pronoun.1 The viewing of the manifold variety as essen-tially one with Siva becomes possible only when objectivity is there. It is why the third type named Nigarbhartha consists in its emphasis on realisation of the internal character of multi-plicity as Siva by the pure self2 which may be Siva, the teacher, or the aspiring self. If this process is continued, a stage comes"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"252 The Krama Tantricism of Kashmir when the Universal Self is instinctively realized as principle of self-luminous pure awareness even in our empirical and pheno-menal experiences. Since the prius of such awareness is self and the same is technically known as Kula,1 the fourth type passes by the name of Kaulikartha.2 In the above noted stages what happens is that the emphasis is gradually shifted from 'this' to 'I'. In the first instance, the aspirant has to exert himself to realize this identity, whereas in the second this identity of the self with objectivity itself becomes a fact of experience. Here, too, once this process is rigorously pursued further, immediate self-revelation takes place-the objectivity not being identified with but transformed into pure subjectivity.3 Since it is impossible for an unaccom-plished layman to appreciate it, it is termed as Rahasyartha (Secret meaning), the fifth type. When even this stage is trans-cended and pure, alogical, irrelational immediacy prevails and there being no further destiny, it is designated as Maha-parama-tattvartha,4 the sixth type. 4. Synthesis between six Arthas and four Upayas arrived at Now, it may be noted that the first two stages, types or approaches obviously find an analogue in the Anava Upaya5 which, with the aid of external means, tries to unfold the aspirant's real nature. The extrinsic means include, inter alia,"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"Krama, its General Tantric Character  253  usage of sacred syllables etc. Similarly, Nigarbhartha and Kaulikartha find their counterpart in the Saktopaya1 because the Saktopaya consists in processes designed to achieve the refinement of Vikalpas (logical constructions) The purification of logical construction or dualistic consciousness, by definition. means a thorough overhauling of the perspective with reference to objectivity. In simple words, the Saktopaya consists in realising 'this' as an expression of 'I' (Sarvo mamayam vibhavah). Yet, despite this transformation, the Vikalpa remains. The Saktopaya elevates the relation of duality into that of unity and harmony, but the relation itself does not vanish. Therefore, then comes Sambhava which corresponds to-the fifth type i.e., Rahasyarthaor Sarvarahasyartha and consists in the indeterminate self-realization.2 And the last stage i.e., Mahaparamatattvartha is equalled by Anupaya which is the reality per se - Awareness pure and simple. In fact Sambhava and Anupaya are not generally distinguished because the Anupaya reflects the highest stage of the Sambhava. In that case the Sambhava would stand for both of the final types. 5. Conclusion : Nigarbhartha and Kaulikartha Versus Saktopaya i.e., Krama Thus we see how the synthesis between the fundamental structure of the Kashmir Saivism and that of the Tantra in general is brought about. It is to be noted that Krama is gene-rally identified with Saktopaya. Hence Saktopaya on the one hand and Nigarbhartha along with Kaulikartha on the other, provide the common ground where the Tantra and Kashmir Saivism meet. It is, however, beyond the scope of this section to go into the intricacies of the Saktopaya etc., because the same is taken up for detailed analysis in the very first chapter of the philosophical study. These lines are, therefore, intended"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"254   The Krama Tantricism of Kashmir to serve as a preliminary to the following section. But for Jayaratha it would not have been possible to find out the traditional, yet logical, attitude towards the two independent literatures - Tantra and Kashmir Saivism - which have more points of contact than those of departure."},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"APPENDIX 'A'"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"APPENDIX \"B\" CLASSIFIED BIBLIOGRAPHY ORIGINAL SOURCES* A.
