DeviBhagavata, Durga Saptashati in Markandeya Purana by the sage Vyasa and TripuraRahasya narrated by the Lord Dattatreya are of this category. Not only that. ManyTantra books pertain to this pious theme.The rituals of worship and spiritual practices to attain the grace of Para Shakti aremultifarious. Among them some methods of Samayachara (benign rituals) andVamachara (wild rituals) are still in vogue in India. There are some mutualcontradictions among these rituals.Lalita Sahasranama Stotra, the hymn of 1000 names of Lalita is the best onevenerated by the followers of all the traditions. There is not a single ritual, whichhas any difference of opinion on this hymn, which is found in the Brahmanda Purana.The spiritual masters of the past have written several commentaries on the LalitaSahasranama Stotra. They have firmly established that the hymn contains theessence of the Mantra Shastra (the science of holy chants) of the entire world. Theyhave thoroughly analysed and described each name of the hymn from variousaspects.The first set of 100 names of the hymn describes in detail the story of Lalita. Takefor example, the fourth name “Chidagnikunda Sambhuta” which means the Divinemother manifested from the fire-pit of the Supreme Knowledge. Where can we findsuch a fire pit?Consider another name “Kamesha baddha Mangalya sutra sobhita kandhara” i.e.One with the Mangala sutra tied around her neck by Kameshwara. (Mangala sutra isthe holy thread with a golden pendent tied around the neck of a bride by thebridegroom) Who is Kameshwara?We find another name “Kameshwarastra nirdagdha sa Bhandasura sunyaka”. Thismeans that the Divine Mother has burnt to ashes both the demon Bhanda and hiscapital city of Sunyaka using the weapon of Kameshwara. Who is the demonBhanda?First of all we said Lalitasahasra. Who is Lalita?"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"2All these questions are answered in detail in the Lalitopakhyana in the BrahmandaPurana. The narration is written in the form of conversation between Hayagreevaand the sage Agastya. Hayagreeva in this context is a seer. There is a celestial ofthe same name. Who are they? We get the reply for this also in the text.There is a detailed description in the book establishing the harmonious synthesis ofthe aspects of the three deities Shiva, Vishnu and the Divine Mother.In the past several devotees used to daily recite Lalitopakhyana, the detailed story ofLalita. This pious story contains the inner meanings of the several technical terms ofthe spiritual science and the finer aspects of the Mantra Shastra (the science of holychants). Let us enjoy the feast of nectar by listening to this pious story with deepdevotion.Penance of AgastyaLong ago, the mountain Vindhya (central India) started growing upward in giganticproportion due to egoism. The sage Agastya decided to subdue the pride ofVindhya. For this purpose, he came from Varanasi (Uttara Pradesh, India) andsettled in South India. By the divine presence of the sage Agastya, the entire SouthIndia gradually became prosperous and pious.Eventually the Kali Yuga started (As per the tradition of India, Kali Yuga is the fourthAge, the others being Kruta, Treta and Dvapara). Inspite of the severe inspection ofthe sage Agastya, the evil traits of the Kali Yuga started sprouting slowly. Noting thistrend, the sage felt sad and proceeded on a pilgrimage.The strange and unrighteous ways of the people made him quite unhappy. Therewas rampant selfishness and sensuousness prevalent everywhere. “How can thesepeople attain liberation?” – This was his nagging grief.After reaching Kanchi (Tamil Nadu – South India) he was unable to bear the burdenof the grief, and performed severe penance meditating on Varadaraja (The Best ofthe boon givers – a synonym of Vishnu).God’s ways are mysterious! His power of illusion is incomprehensible! Vishnuappeared to the sage in the form of Hayagreeva. Agastya asked Hayagreeva “OhLord! What is the path of salvation to these ignorant people”?Hayagreeva replied “There are two paths for this. They are:a) After renouncing everything, one can attain the knowledge of the, attributelessaspect of God. This is a very difficult way.b) The second method is to worship the Divine Mother who is the form of Vishnuwith attributes. Even a sinner can do the worship. There is another advantage inthis type. The devotee can simultaneously get enjoyment and salvation byfollowing this path”.Further, Vishnu ordered to the sage Agastya “You have to propagate this divinesecret in the entire world”."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"3The sage asked, “Lord Vishnu! Kindly narrate the story of Para Shakti (The UltimatePower, the Divine Mother) who is your aspect with attributes ”. At this stage, Vishnuasked sage Hayagreeva (born with the Lord’s aspects) to tell the detailed story toAgastya.The Divine Mother emanated from meditation of Brahma (the Creator). Her namethen was Prakruti (The nature).Mohini AvataraFor the second time, the Divine Mother manifested as Mohini at the time of thechurning the ocean by the celestials and the demons (to obtain Amruta-nectar). Letus see how it happened.Once upon a time, Indra (the Lord of the Heaven was overpowered by the pride ofhis prosperity. His reverence to even Shiva gradually diminished. Observing this,Shiva asked the sage Durvasa to meet Indra in the Heaven. The sage started takingthe path of Gandharvas (the celestial singers), which was very beautiful. The sageappeared uglier than a beggar. Anyway he proceeded ahead pompously.On the way the sage saw a celestial lady holding a fragrant garland of divine flowers.The ugly looking sage asked the beautiful lady, “Where did you get this garland”?She observed him keenly and realised that he was a sage. She prostrated to himand replied humbly “Sir! I am just now returning after doing the worship of theDivine Mother, who manifested and gave me this garland as Prasadam”Jumping joyously, the sage asked her to give the garland to him. She happilyhanded it over to the sage and, prostrated to him. The sage blessed her “May yourdevotion to the Divine mother be firm”. Taking leave of the sage, she went away.By this incident, the sage realised that it was not difficult to others to recognise him,even if he was in any ugly appearance. He was satisfied with this thought andproceeded further.After a while, he saw Indra riding the elephant Iravata. The sage approached Indra,who did not appear to recognise and prostrate to the sage. However, the sage didnot get angry and said, “Indra! This is the garland given by the Divine MotherHerself. Take it. Saying so, the sage presented the garland to Indra.Indra didn’t refuse. He received the garland with disgust and threw the same on thehead of the elephant, which proceeded ahead. A little latter, the elephant threwdown the garland with its trunk and trampled over it.Looking at this, the sage Durvasa became very furious and cursed Indra, “Oh!Egoistic fellow! You have not recognised me. Not only that. You have not evenrespected the Prasadam of the Divine mother. Due to this, May your prosperityvanish!”With these words, Indra’s pride was humbled. He got down the elephant andprostrated to the feet of the angry sage Durvasa. However, the sage went awaysilently."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"4Then Indra’s troubles started one by one. He saw bad omens in the Heaven. Afraidof them, Indra asked the sage Bruhaspati (the Spiritual Master of the celestials) toreveal the cause of the bad omens. The sage replied, “The effect of your sins followsyou as a shadow. Saying so, the sage narrated a fine story."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"5Lalitopakhyana – II(11-10-99 - 2nd Day)Long long ago, there was a thief by name Vajra in Kanchipuram (Tamil Nadu, SouthIndia). He used to steal small things and gradually amassed large quantum ofmoney. As the wealth accumulated considerably, he wanted to hide it safely andwent to the nearby forest to do so. In a dense part of the forest, he dug a deep pitand secured the money therein.However, a hunter by name Veeradanta, sitting on a tall tree observed all this, quiteunexpectedly. After the thief has left the place, the hunter dug out the pit and aftertaking only one tenth of the money, he covered the pit, without causing any doubt toanyone. The hunter’s wife saw the money and knowing how her husband got it, shesaid, “It is customary that many Brahmanas visit the home of my parents.Whenever they saw me, they used to forecast “You will get rich quite suddenly.Their prediction came true now”.The hunter Veeradanta planned to purchase meat and wine with the money.However his wife said, “The Brahmana visitors of my parents’ home used to tellsomething more. They cautioned that hard-earned money only will give durableenjoyment and that the easy money was sinful. Hence let us use this unexpectedand unearned money for charities. After prolonged discussions, the wife’s opinionwon.Then Veeradanta selected a place of water scarcity and arranged the digging a bigwater tank for public use. While the work was in progress, further plans were madeand accordingly, he started the construction of temples for Vishnu and Shiva by theside of the tank.When the projects were half way, the money was exhausted. Hence Veeradantastarted spying like a detective to find out the several places at which the thief Vajrawas hiding the stolen wealth. Without causing any doubt to the thief, the hunterused to take out money little by little from the pits and continued the constructionwithout interruptions. Along with this, he started to donate the money. Howeverthe hunter did not use the money for himself or his family.Thus, constantly encouraged by his wife, his charities developed. The Brahmanas ofKanchi were glad and gave the titles “Dvijavarma” and “Shilavati” to the hunter andhis wife. These titles eventually became their names in vogue.Some time later, the hunter planned and constructed a city. Instead of giving it hisown name, the hunter named it as “Devaratapura”, as a mark of respect to his guru“Devarata”.After a few years, the hunter and his wife died at the same time. The messengers ofYama (The God of death and the Lord of Hell), and Shiva and Vishnu arrived to takeaway the Jivas (the subtle form of life of the dead). Their debate as to who can takethe Jivas could not be settled.At that time, the sage Narada arrived there. He asked the three groups ofmessengers to stop the arguments and revealed another aspect of the code of"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"6righteousness thus, “The hunter has performed the deeds of merit (Punya) likecharities, with the money stolen by him. Hence as per the rules of righteousness, hemust move about in the form of a ghost until the death of all the owners of thestolen wealth. Hence none of you have the right to take away the Jiva.“Next, his wife was great. She didn’t commit any sin. As she was a devotee ofShiva, the messengers of the Lord can take away her Jiva.”Listening to this ruling, Shilavati’s Jiva sat down obstinately, saying “I won’t go toKailasha, the abode of Shiva, leaving my husband in the form of a ghost”. Sheprayed to the sage Narada, “Sir! Kindly direct me what I have to do to unburden myhusband’s sins”.Narada was very much pleased with her chastity and fidelity and gave initiation ofShiva mantra (chant) to her. By her penance, the husband and wife attained thegrace of Shiva and were accepted to stay in Kailasha (Shiva’s abode).Sometime later, the thief Vajra and the persons from whom he stole the money died.All the Jivas reached the Hell, the abode of Yama, the god of death, He asked all ofthem to assemble and said, “Though you did not intend to do the acts of Punya(merit), they were performed with your money. Hence you are eligible to stay inKailasha (abode of Shiva) for sometime. Hence I ask you whether you choose toexperience either the effect of Punya (merit) or Papa (sin) in the first instance. Theyreplied in chorus “we opt to experience the effect of merit first. By doing so, we willhave a chance of association with the pious which in turn will wipe out past sins”.Yama felt glad by their choice and sent them all as the attendants of Dvijavarma atKailasha. By his good association, all their sins were washed off and they settled inKailasha happily.Preaching of BruhaspatiAfter narrating the story, Bruhaspati said, “Indra! Now you think of your sins”. Indraonce again prostrated to the sage and requested. “Sir! I am unable to realise mysins. Kindly give me details”. Bruhaspati replied “In the distant past, ‘Diti’, thesecond wife of Kashyapa gave birth to a son by name Danu and a daughter namedRupavati. Danu is the predecessor of the race of Danavas (demons). Rupavati wasmarried to Brahma (the Creator). Her son was Vishwarupa. He did severe penance.He had many divine aspects. However he was a nephew of the demons. He wasaffectionate towards both the races – the celestials and the demons.After a while, Indra chose Vishwarupa as his Guru (at that time, Bruhaspati was notthe Guru of the celestials). Indra expected that Vishwarupa would be partial towardsthe celestials and that he would destroy the demons. However Vishwarupa wasfriendly towards all.Observing this, Indra suspected that being a friend of the demons, Vishwarupa washarming the celestials. One day, Indra suddenly went to Vishwarupa and cut off allhis three heads. By doing so, Indra was afflicted by the sin of Brahmahatya (killingBrahmana). Not only that. Aggrieved by the death of His son, Brahma (the Creator)cursed Indra. Terrified by these two (Brahmahatya and curse of Brahma), Indraaccompanied by all the celestials, sought refuge at the feet of Vishnu, who"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"7contemplated deeply and allocated the effect of Indra’s sins to the earth, the treesand the women.As compensation, Vishnu gave the power that the pits of earth could be filled up, thepower that even the trees once cut off could revive and the power of women tobeget children. Thus Indra was relieved of the effect of the sin of Brahmahatya(killing a Brahmin). However, the curse of Brahma (the Creator) still persisted.Vishnu called for Brahma and requested Him on behalf of Indra for relief from thecurse. Brahma thought over the same and said, “OK. For the present my cursewon’t take effect”. Vishnu said nothing.Again Indra became prosperous. However, very soon his pride increased. This time,Indra was affected by the anger of Shiva and so he was cursed by the sageDurvasa”.Listening to all this, Indra recollected the past events and sadly asked Bruhaspati“Master! What have I to do now”? When the guru was about to reply, a demonnamed Malaka invaded the Heaven with a huge army and seized the kingdom. Indrahad to escape in a great hurry.He went straight to Brahma and prayed to Him for mercy, who also pitied Indra.However even the Creator could not decide what to do and approached Vishnu alongwith Indra and the celestials.Vishnu thought of the problem deeply and advised them, “You churn the ocean toget the Goddess of prosperity”. For this purpose, Indra made reconciliation with thedemons and taking their help, he and the celestials churned the ocean. During thechurning, very valuable things emanated from the ocean. At last, Dhanvantari (theGod of Healing) came out holding the pot of Amruta (nectar). Looking at him, thedemons grabbed the pot and started running away with it.A bitter battle started between the celestials and the demons. There was utterconfusion. Even Brahma and Shiva escaped and reached their abodes.Observing all this, Vishnu went to a secluded spot and started meditation of Sri LalitaDevi, who dwells within Him as the aspect of power. Due to this meditation hemanifested as a form of Lalita Devi. Taking this incarnation as an embodiment oferoticism, Vishnu approached the celestials and demons.The celestials could realise the form as divine and auspicious. However, due to theirpredominating trait of Tamas (ignorance), the demons were enchanted by thebeauty of the form and stopped fighting. She mesmerised them and took the pot ofAmruta (nectar) from them, taking their consent to her to serve the nectar to all.She asked the celestials and the demons to sit in separate rows. She started to givethe nectar to the celestials only first. Allured by her, the demons sat still stupefied.By the time the nectar was given to the celestials, the stock exhausted. Shedisappeared suddenly.The demons again started to fight with the celestials. However as the celestials havealready drunk the nectar by then, the demons were defeated."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"8Thus, the Divine Mother who manifested and enchanted the demons was calledMOHINI (the divine entrantress). Shiva, staying in Kailasha came to know of theseevents and wanted to note the speciality of the new form of Vishnu. Along with hisconsort Parvati, Shiva went to Vaikuntha, the abode of Vishnu and pressed Him toshow the form of Mohini. Vishnu suddenly disappeared without saying yes or no.While Shiva was searching for Vishnu, he happened to reach a new place where hecontinued to search.There he heard the music of Veena. He saw a beautiful young lady. Unable to resisthis infatuation, Shiva embraced her. At once a son was born. He was named SASTA(one who rules). He became a commander in Shiva’s army.At once the lady disappeared. Shiva realised that she was none else than Mohini, aform of Vishnu. He applauded her beauty and returned to Kailasha along withParvati.Thus the Divine Mother incarnated as Mohini and granted success of the activities ofthe celestials."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"9Lalitopakhyana – III(12-10-99 – 3rd Day)Agastya heard the story and said, “Hayagreeva! Kindly let me know in detail whichform of Para Shakti (The Divine Mother, the Supreme Power) will bestow both foodand salvation to the devotees in the Kali Yuga”. Hayagreeva replied, “Lalita Devi isthe only Goddess who has the power to do so. Listen to her story”.In the distant past, Sati Devi, a daughter of Daksha was married to Shiva. Howevergradually, Daksha developed hatred towards Shiva. Due to this ill will, Dakshaintended to perform a Yaga (fire sacrifice) without making any offering to Shiva. Hedidn’t invite even his daughter Sati Devi to the Yaga.She came to know of the forth-coming great Yaga to be done by her father. Shedidn’t know other details. However, overjoyed by the news of the ritual her fatherwas going to perform, he went to the Yaga, in spite of Shiva’s disapproval of hervisit.Sati Deha Tyaga (Self-immolation of Sati)Ignoring the natural affection to his daughter, Daksha insulted her and repeatedlyabused Shiva. Unable to bear the insult to Shiva, Sati Devi burnt her body in the firecreated by her power of yoga. Knowing about this calamity, Shiva became furious.Creating the terrific Veerabhadra out of the locks of hair of His head, Shiva sent himto attack Daksha. Veerabhadra destroyed the hall of Yaga, swallowed even theChakra (the circular weapon of Vishnu) and beheaded Daksha. The wives of Dakshaprayed to Veerabhadra who was pacified and revived Daksha back to life by joiningthe head of a goat to the trunk. Daksha repented and prayed to Shiva for pardon.Sati Devi was born as the daughter of Himavanta (Himalaya Mountain) and Menaka,as the couple did penance for 150 million years with the intention to beget her astheir child. The newborn was named Parvati (daughter of Parvata-mountain) andbrought Her up with love and affection.One day, the sage Narada visited Himavanta and said, “You are very fortunate. TheDivine Mother is born as your daughter; Shiva is doing penance in your mountainrange in his “Sthanu Ashrama” (abode of stones). After the departure of Sati Devi,He has become an ascetic. It will benefit you considerably if you send your daughterto serve Him”.Himavanta’s joy knew no bounds on hearing Narada’s words. He went to the abodeof Shiva along with his daughter. After taking Nandi’s (the Ox which is the vehicle ofShiva) permission, he approached Shiva, worshipped Him and prayed to Him to allowParvati to serve him. Shiva said, “OK. She may do so”. Then onwards, Parvati usedto render services to Shiva for hours together. However, Shiva used to be in a stateof ecstasy of yoga continuously.Kama Dahana (Burning of Cupid)This being so, a demon by name Taraka invaded and occupied the Heaven along withhis army and started to hurt and pester the celestials. All of them approached"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"10Brahma for relief, who said, “The son born to Shiva and Parvati only can kill thedemon. Hence you make such efforts that the marriage will be performed”.Indra, the Lord of the celestials called for Manmatha (Cupid-the god of love). Hepraised Cupid and asked him to see that Shiva’s ascetic attitude was lessened andthat He would start to love Parvati. Manmatha was exuberated by praises andagreed to do as directed.Ratidevi, the spouse of Manmatha came to know of this new assignment and triedher best to dissuade cupid from embarking on the hazardous venture. In spite of it,Cupid proceeded to Shiva’s abode “Sthanu Ashrama”.There he suddenly created the alluring atmosphere of the spring season. ThePramathaganas (the armies of Shiva) were very much disturbed in their minds withthe erotic feelings. Observing this, Nandi (Ox-the vehicle of Shiva) disciplined them.In the meantime, Cupid entered the abode of Shiva stealthily and saw Shiva seatedin the state of ecstasy of meditation. The very sight of Shiva in the posture suddenlyunnerved Cupid. At the same moment, Parvati came there. Looking at Her, Cupidrecovered his courage.While Parvati was getting up after bending low to prostrate to Shiva, Her uppergarment slipped a bit. Exactly at that moment, Manmatha aimed an arrow (of lust)on Shiva, whose mind was affected a bit. Observing this, Parvati feet a gush of joyinwardly.However Shiva analysed His feeling immediately and looked around to know why ithappened so. Shiva saw Cupid hiding behind the bushes. At once, Shiva’s third eye(in between the eyebrows) opened and the fire rushing therefrom reduced Cupid toashes. Parvati closed her eyes out of fear. By the time She opened Her eyes in amoment, Shiva disappeared with all His attendants. Himavanta came there, consoledHer and took Her home. Ratidevi wept bitterly due to the death of her husbandManmatha. Vasanta, the god of spring approached Ratidevi, consoled her andreminded her of the curse of Brahma to Manmatha.Curse of Brahma to Manmatha:Once upon a time, there were two demons by name Sunda and Upasunda,who were brothers. They did penance meditating on Brahma and obtained a strangeboon that their death could not be caused by anyone else except by themselvesonly. They were very much fond of one another. Hence they expected that no mutualharm would be possible.Thereafter they created havoc by their terrific acts in the three worlds. All thecelestials prayed to Brahma who thought of a strategy to destroy the demons. Heaccumulated the essence of beauty of all the fine things in the world and created awoman of exquisite beauty. As she was created with a gingelly aspect of beauty ineverything, she was called Tilottama (Tila-gingelly; Uttama-Best)Her beauty enchanted even the celestials. Brahma checked up keenly whether herbeauty was superb in all aspects. Manmatha, who happened to be there at that time,wanted to play a practical joke. Hence he aimed an arrow (of lust) at Brahma. Dueto this, Brahma forgetting that she was His daughter chased her lustily. As a last"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"11resort, Tilottama started running taking the form of a deer. Brahma also followed herin the form of a deer. The celestials were highly agitated by this untoward event.Observing this impending danger, Shiva manifested as a hunter and holding a bowand arrows came near Brahma who was in the form of a deer.Looking at the fierce form of Shiva, Brahma came to senses. He prostrated to Hisfeet and prayed for pardon. By then, the celestials and Tilottama arrived there.Everyone was pacified. After taking Shiva’s permission, the celestials sent Tilottamato meet Sunda and Upasunda looking at Tilottama going about in a garden, bothSunda and Upasunda competed to enjoy with her and at last the demons killed andanother.Tilottama returned to Brahma, who felt happy and sent her to the Heaven with apermanent status as one of the Apsaras(celestial dancers).After the entire affair was over, Brahma recollected what all had happened and sentfor Manmatha and said “You fellow! Blinded by the power bestowed to you, how dareyou aim your arrows (of lust) at one and all, disregarding their age? Do you intendto destroy the code of righteousness? I am saved of grievous sin due to the timelyarrival and protection of Shiva. Hence, one day you will be burnt to ashes by the fireof Shiva’s third eye. Beware!”Hearing the curse, Rati and Manmatha were frightened and prayed to Brahma forrelief of the curse.Brahma regained His composure and said, “The Divine Mother will manifest asLalitadevi. She will marry Shiva. After the marriage, She will revive Manmatha tolife”After narrating the story, Vasanta (the god of spring season) consoled Ratidevi,saying, “Sister-in-law! It is a must for everyone, however great he is, to undergo thesuffering of a curse. However as predicted by Brahma, my brother Manmatha will berevived to life soon. Until then, be bold and continue to pray to Lalitadevi.Ratidevi left the place and followed the advice."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"12Lalitopakhyana – IV(13-10-99 – 4th Day)Birth of Bhandasura150. At this point of time, Chitrakarma, the commander of one of the Rudra Ganas(Gana = troupe) one day started toying with the ash of the burnt Manmatha andprepared a doll out of it. He took this doll to Lord Shiva.151. Lord Shiva’s intentions are indeed unfathomable. As soon as the doll nearedLord Shiva, it sprang to life and the boy thus born prostrated before Lord Shiva andChitrakarma.152. Chitrakarma was overwhelmed with joy. He gave the boy the Upadesha ofShata-Rudreeya Mantra and asked him to undertake penance.153. When the penance reached the stage of fruition, Lord Shiva appeared beforehim. He asked Lord Shiva to grant him a special boon “anyone who fights against meshould immediately lose half of his strength and that strength should be added to mystrength. None of the weapons of my opponents should be able to bind me” was hisrequest. Immediately Lord Shiva granted the boon and added, “I am also bestowingon you the boon of ruling the kingdom for sixty thousand years”. After giving theseboons, Lord Shiva disappeared.154. He became surprised and a bit apprehensive by the words of Lord Shiva. Butsoon he forgot it.155. Lord Brahma, who was witnessing all this, grew frustrated and swore “Bhand”“Bhand” (meaning shame, shame). From then on, he got the name “Bhanda”.Because of his qualities he became an Asura (demon) and entered the domain ofAsuras. This is how he got the name ‘Bhandasura’.156. In the mean time, from the remnants of the ash of Manmatha were born twodemons – Vishukra and Vishanga. These two became the main brothers ofBhandasura.157. In addition, thousands of Rakshasas (demons) were born out of the ash ofManmatha. All of them became followers of Bhandasura. They formed a strong armyof 300 Akshouhinis (one Akshouhini consists of 21870 elephants, 65610 horses and109350 soldiers).158. Having come to know about the birth of thousands of Rakshasas, Shukracharya(the guru of Rakshasas) came there and assumed the role of the Guru for all thoseRakshasas and initiated them to undertake regular Anushthanas (daily rituals).159. He also summoned Maya, the architect-builder of demons and asked him tocreate a new city in the province of Mahendra Mountains. He named the city as‘Shoonyaka Pattana’"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"13160. Shukracharya asked all the demons to move to the new city. He crownedBhandasura as the king of the newly formed kingdom and made Vishukra andVishanga the Yuvarajas (princes) of that kingdom.161. Bhandasura had four wives. 1. Sammohini, 2. Kumudini, 3. Chitrangi 4.Sundari.162. Under the guidance of Shukracharya, activities like fire sacrifices, Vediceducation and penance went on uninterruptedly in every house.Tormenting of the three worlds:163. When the kingdom was well established, Bhandasura called for a meeting of hisbrothers and ministers and said :A) Devatas (Gods) are our enemies. As long as Manmatha was alive, theirlineage continued without any problems. They also enjoyed manypleasures.B) Now, because of our luck, we have taken birth from the ashes ofManmatha. The gods are trying to see that Manmatha is born again. Weshould not allow that to happen. Before they try anything like that, weshould kill the Devatas.C) But, if we go in our present form, we can not win. Let us therefore assumethe form of air and enter their bodies.D) After having so entered their bodies, let us dry up their body fluids,especially the semen.E) If semen dries up, the strength of other tissues and organs willautomatically diminish. Then they will automatically be annihilated.F) Let us torment the beings of all the three worlds by entering their bodies inthe form of air and by drying up their body fluids.164. Hearing this, the entire army of the demons cheered with joy.165. Without wasting much time, Bhandasura and his army of 1000 Akshouhinisassumed the invisible form of air and entered the heaven.166. First of all, they entered the minds of the angels and dried up their mentalfaculties.167. Subsequently they entered the face of the angels, robbed them of their beautyand made them ugly looking.168. All the women and men in the heaven became impotent and sterile.169. Not only that, their love for one another was also lost. They lost enthusiasm todo anything.170. Even the plants and animals suffered the same fate.171. Vishukra, along with his troupes entered Bhooloka (earth) and meted out thesame treatment to the beings there."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"14172. People on the planet earth stopped smiling. They lost all happiness. No one hadany respect for another. No one thought of helping the other. They lost interest intheir activities. The situation was stone-like, devoid of any life and feelings.173. Vishanga, along with his troupes entered Rasaatala (one of the seven netherworlds). He created similar havoc there also.174. In the Naga Loka (land of serpents) everyone became afflicted with grief for noapparent reason. Everyone started hating everyone else. Everyone became drainedof energy and potency.175. Rasa, the fluid principle is the basis for the accomplishment of the four-foldaims of life (Purusharthas). Let us see how.A. Rasa itself is the form of Paramatma, the Almighty.B. From Rasa are created Shukla (sperm) and Shonita (ovum). These two arecollectively called as Veerya.C. From Veerya comes Kanti (radiance), Utsaaha (enthusiasm), Ullasa(happiness), Dharma (righteousness), Daya (compassion), Preeti (love),Buddhi (intellectual capabilities), Vikasa (development), Parakrama (valour)Shastra Vijnana (scientific knowledge), Kala Asakti (interest in arts),Soundarya Drishti (proper concept of beauty) etc.D. In plants, the Rasa enhances the fire energy, which is hidden in them. Onlywhen the fire energy is harnessed, the plants can branch out and bearflowers and fruits. Because of this fire principle, the dried logs catch fireeasily and burn.E. The Vedas have declared that beings can experience happiness only if Rasais present.F. Rasa is nothing but Prana (vital energy).G. Having known all these secrets, Bhandasura devised the plan of enteringthe bodies of all beings in the form of air and drying them up.176. Vasanta, the close friend and associate of Manmatha observed this immediatelyand consoled Rati (Manmatha’s wife). He said “Even the sun, the moon and the starshave lost their brilliance. Even Goddess Parvati seems to have become dull and hasengaged in Tapas. Therefore, the day when your dead husband will come to lifeagain is not very far. That day will come very soon. So, stop grieving.”177. On hearing this, Rati Devi prepared to undertake penance.178. In the heaven, all the Devatas including Brahma, could not comprehend whatwas going on and what had caused the situation. Not knowing the remedy for theirhardship, they approached Lord Sri Hari.179. When they finally reached the abode of Lord Sri Hari, they saw that even Hewas sitting still with his eyes closed. It appeared as though He was merged in thebliss of Sushupti. After the angels praised His glory for a long time, Lord Sri Harislowly opened His eyes.180. “What is this? Why are you all looking drained of your energies?” asked Lord SriHari. He called everyone by their names and said :A. Your present condition is due to the invisible foul play of Bhandasura."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"15B. Even I have lost the affinity for Goddess Lakshmi. What to say about otherlesser beings?C. Myself, Brahma and Rudra are Karana Purushas (causal beings for themanifest creation).

He is called Maha Shambhu. Parashakti is constantly in HisCompany.E. He is devoid of form. He is not dependent on anything. He has nomodifications. He is greater than the greatest. He is the ultimate.F. He is not influenced by the foul play of Bhandasura, who is born from theashes of Manmatha.G. He can rescue us from our difficulties. Therefore, let us all take refuge inHim and praise Him. Follow me.181. So saying, Sri Hari led all the angels to the brim of the Brahmanda (Universe).There was a huge wall like fence there.182. The angels summoned the celestial elephants to break the wall. After toilingcontinuously for one year, a breach was formed in the wall.183. After passing through the breach, they saw Chinmaya Akasha, which wasNiralamba (independent), Nirajnana (untainted) and which was devoid of the fiveelements.184. They all stood in that Chinmaya Akasha and sang the glory of Maha Shambhu,who was of the form of Chidakasha.185. Then Maha Shambhu appeared before them. He was dark like clouds. He hadtwo hands. He was holding a Shoola (spear) in one hand and a Kapala (skull) in theother. He had three eyes.186. Parashakti also appeared before them. She was holding Aksha Mala (rosary ofbeads) and Pustaka (book) in Her hands. She was bright and cool like the moon."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"16Lalitopakhyana – V(14-10-99 – 5th Day)Maha Yaga187. The great Maha Shambhu smiled and saidA. I am aware why you have all come here.B. Pralaya (destruction) is of three types. (i) Avaantara Pralaya (ii) MahaPralaya and (iii) Kama Pralaya.C. I am the one who is responsible to rescue the world from Maha Pralaya.Vishnu is the one who rescues from Aavantara Pralaya. It is LalitaParameshwari who rescues from Kama Pralaya.D. These three kinds of Pralaya take place in a cyclic pattern in every Kalpa.Now, Kaamika Pralaya has taken place because of the destruction of Kamaand subsequently due to the actions of Bhandasura.E. Only Lalita Devi can rescue from this situation. Parashakti alone can createanother Lalita Devi. Therefore, take shelter in her. Beg her to help you.188. Hearing this, the Devatas did not know what to do. They again prayed to MahaShambhu to teach them the method of appeasing Parashakti.189. Maha Shambhu explained :A. This is called as Maha Yaga. (great fire sacrifice)B. I am (assuming the form of Vayu) the Hota (the priest who makes theofferings in a Homa) in this Yaga (fire sacrifice).C. My Chidagni itself is the fire in this Yaga.D. The last of the seven seas, i.e., Jala Samudra (Water Sea) has now driedup. The huge pit so formed itself is the Homa Kunda (fire pit where Homa isperformed)E. The remaining six great oceans constitute the six drops of ghee which isused as offering.F.

Human beings), (iii) AndaSrishti (creation taking place through eggs) (iv) Swedaja Srishti (creationtaking place through sweat) and (v)Udbhijja Srishti (creation taking placeby sprouting).

Parashakti and Maha Shambhu disappeared.191. The angels also returned to their abode.192. After some time, Maha Shambhunatha, accompanied by Parashakti startedchanting the Lalita Maha Mantra and entered the Universe in the form of the seven-layered Vayu (air).193. Parashakti assumed the form of His Kriya Shakti (energy of action).194. With the help of Kriya Shakti, Vayu blew the Jala Samudra with all his energy.The Jala Samudra (water ocean) became totally dry.195. In the pit thus formed He kindled the Chidagni with the help of fire emanatingfrom the third eye. This Agni raged from the Patala (a region in the nether-world) tothe Brahma Loka.196. He decorated the periphery of the Homa Kunda with the stars just as onedecorates a sacrificial fire pit with flowers.197. After this, he performed the Yaga as ordained by the Vedas. He used thePralaya Meghas (clouds appearing during Pralaya), namely Pushkala and Aavartakaas Srik and Sruva (the two spoons which are used to offer ghee in fire worship).198. As the Homa progressed, the Chidagni emanating from it spread to vast area.199. He then offered the first six oceans and then the five-fold creations to this Agni.200. In the end, the gods too decorated themselves and sat on the Srik and Sruva,ready to be offered to Agni. Maha Shambhunatha offered them to Agni.201.

At the end of the Homa, Lalita Devi came out of the Chidagni Homa Kunda,seated on a special chariot called “Chakra Raja Ratha”. Therefore, we find thedescriptions such as“Chidagnikunda sambhoota”“Deva kaarya samudyataa” and“Chakra Raja Rathaa Roodha Sarvaayudha Parishkritaa”in Lalita Sahasranama.203.

While Lalita devi was proceeding for the war, many bad omens were observedin Bhanda’s ‘Shunyaka’ town.238. Bhandasura called upon an urgent meeting along with his brothers Vishukraand Vishanga to assess and evaluate the situation.239. In the meeting vishukra spoke thusa.) All gods have burnt themselves by jumping into fire, out of despairb.) From that fire arose mother goddess, who rejuvenated all godsc.) She is coming for a war with us, along with an army of womend.) Those gods are trying to cut stones using tender leavese.) Even then we should not neglect that woman. We must send our armyimmediately240. Vishanga tolda.) Any work should only be done after properly thinking about it.b.) First we must send spies and see how powerful their army is.c.) We must not under estimate the enemies army.d.) In the past Hiranyakashipa was killed by an animal.e.) Sumbha and Nishumbha were killed by a woman.f.) So, we must get more information about herg.) Who is she ? Who is supporting or protecting her?What does she want? All these queries should be answered241.Listening to this Bhandasura shuddered the proposal with a sarcastic grin. Evenif all the gods are behind her, we have nothing to fear. Do not entertain such uselessthoughts and spoil your mind242. Immediately Bhandasura ordered ‘Kutilaksha’, Commander-in-chief of his army,to protect the fort"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"23243.

Durmada was confronted by Sampatkaridevi and her army of elephants (whoarose from Lalita devi’s spear)249. Realising that his army was being defeated Durmada himself came for the warseated on a camel250. Sampatkari devi who was seated on ‘Ranakolahala’ her elephant, faced him.251. In the ferocious battle Durmada was able to destroy one gem from the crown ofSampatkari devi.252. Angry with this, Sampatkari devi killed Durmada with her arrows which piercedhis heart253. With that the remaining demons fled back to their town out of fear.254. Listening to this Bhandasura was very angry and sent Durmada’s elder brotherKurunda for battle. He is an expert in maya yuddha(war using mystical powers)255.Full of vengeance he attacked Sampatkari devi256. In the meanwhile Ashwarudha devi who had taken birth from Lalita devi’s whipcame forward and pleaded Sampatkari devi to give her a chance to fight with thisdemon.257. Now Ashwarudha devi along with her army pounced upon Kurunda258. Ashwarudha devi mounted on ‘Aparajita’ was herself leading the army. In thatbattle she killed Kurunda by piercing his chest with her spear. Remaining demonsfled for their lives.259. Bhanda became furious. He sent a huge army this time (100 akshohini) alongwith 5 commanders.260. They materialised serpent gods by name ‘Ranashambari’ which attackedshaktisena.

Then Nakulidevi killed Ranashambari with Garudastram265. All the five commanders now attacked Nakuli devi266. Nakuli devi’s mongoose army attacked them from the rear267. In that ferocious battle Nakuli devi who was mounted on Garuda was makingaerial strikes on the demons who were not able to catch her. She killed the fivecommanders by chopping of their heads268.

In that meeting it was decided that Vishanga would attack devi’s army from itsrear side in a treacherous way (This is called Parshti grahamu). This decision wastaken because they got information from their spies that Lalita devi was having lessarmy and protection at her rear end and it was easier for them to approach Lalitadevi directly and attack her, if they approached from the rear.276. After the first day’s war, at dusk, Vishanga with a small army proceeded to therear of Lalita devi’s army noiselessly without any drums277. By then Lalita devi’s army was moving westward. Vishanga along with his armymoved north wards and then turned to reach eastern side278. He was able to see Srichakraraja chariot very near to him. Lalita devi waslooking forward observing the movement of the army. She was not having mucharmy close to her279. Taking this opportunity Vishanga attacked devi’s chariot from the rear, all of asudden.280 Anima and other gods who were present there were taken back at this suddenattack but quickly recovered themselves and prepared for a counter fight.281. Exactly at the same time Kutilaksha along with ten akshohini army attackedfrom the front side282. Seeing attack from both ends Lalita devi was a little angry. In the mean while,struck by an arrow from Vishanga, the fan present in Lalita devi’s hand fell down andbroke283. Seeing this Tithidevatas got very angry. They went and requested Lalita devithat Vahnivasini and Jwalamalini nitya devas have property and capacity of selfillumination. If they glow then the demons who are in the dark will all becomevisible.284. With the permission of Lalita devi, Vahnivasini and Jwalamalini devis startedglowing like fireballs.
