She appears in various shows ---- almost invariably as an evildemoness who the badly animated superhero has to conquer.Alone amongst all the tËntrik deities, it is KËlÌ who has captured theimagination of the West. But rather than reviled, she is revered bycountless millions of people. Ramakrishna, the famous Indian sage andsaint, was one of her devotees; Rabindranath Tagore another. It’s nocoincidence that both these great men came from Bengal, for it is there thatshe continues to receive oblations and offerings of flesh. Nevertheless,traces of her worship are found throughout India and former territories ofIndia. Her bad reputation in the West probably sprang from her associationwith the cult of the Thuggees, suppressed by the British during the days ofempire. The Thuggees ---- the word gave rise to our word thug ---- wereactually Muslims who took the goddess KËlÌ as their tutelary deity. Theyspecialised in ensnaring and then robbing and murdering travellers.Originally, they were only supposed to attack male travellers and in theirlatter days attributed their downfall to the fact they had started to killwoman travellers too.But KËlÌ pre-dates the Thuggees, possibly by several thousands of years.Some have associated her with the primordial goddess existing in Indiabefore the Aryan invaders imposed their Vedic ways and manners on thenative population. No one truly knows her origin.She does, however, have an uncanny and an ambiguous image. Modernpictures of her show her standing on the dead body of her consort Éiva,with four arms, a necklace of fifty human skulls6, a girdle of human arms,holding an axe, a trident, a severed human head and a bowl of blood.6They represent the fifty letters of the Sanskrit alphabet.this document is copyright Mike Magee 1995 my email address is now mike.magee@btinternet.com web site: www.shivashakti.com"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Around her rages a battle ---- she herself is the colour of a thundercloud.Her protruding tongue drips with the fresh blood of her enemies.But this image is simply one of many, as we shall see. She is thegoddess in her form as DakÚiÙË KËlikË ---- one of the most popular Bengaliimages of the goddess. Her guises are many, and include BhadrË(auspicious) KËlÌ, ÉmaÚanË (cremation ground) KËlÌ, and a host of others.It is only in the great tËntrik traditions that we find the real meaning ofthe gruesome images associated with KËlikË. Although Hinduism was muchreviled by early Western investigators for its idolatry and pantheisticpractices, this was really a narrow view. TËntrik texts repeatedly speak ofthe DevÌs or goddesses as being aspects of the one goddess. The sameholds true for the male aspects. As individual humans all reflect themacrocosm, it’s fair to describe the gods and goddesses of tantra asspecialised aspects of ourselves ---- and, therefore, of life itself.Yet life has its dark and its light sides. Death and love, in the tËntriktradition, are two sides of the same coin. As we look to the sky, we cansee the Sun and Moon as symbols of male and female, of Éiva and Éakti.In the tantras, the Moon is often taken as a symbol of the DevÌ ---- whetherin its dark or its bright fortnight. When She wanes, her images and hericonography become progressively more dark and fearsome. But when Shewaxes, so her images brighten. When She is full, She is DevÌ TripurË7, ahigh symbol of sexuality and life. Sir John Woodroffe (Arthur Avalon), writing in the Garland of Letters,says KËlÌ is the deity in her aspect as withdrawing time into itself. ‘‘KËlÌ isso called because She devours KËla (Time) and then resumes Her own darkformlessness.’’8 Woodroffe says some have speculated that KËlÌ wasoriginally the Goddess of the Vindhya Hills, conquered by the Aryans. Thenecklace of skulls which makes up her image, he adds, are those of whitepeople.Relying on the texts themselves, gives insight into the tËntrik idea ofKËlÌ. In the KulacÍdËmaÙÌ Tantra (KT), a nigama, Lord Éiva asks questionsanswered by DevÌ, the goddess9. It is, probably, one of the oldest tantras,according to Woodroffe, who published the Sanskrit text in his TËntrikTexts series.2Inner Secrets of a Tantrik Goddess7TripurË is a name of the goddess meaning three cities. These allude to her own triple nature as a maiden(BËlË) as a fecund woman (TripurË) and as a post-menstruating woman (TripurË BhairavÌ).8Garland of Letters, page 235.9 An Ëgama is a tantra in the form of a dialogue where Éakti asks the questions and Éiva gives the answers.A nigama is the other way round, with Éakti doing most of the talking.this document is copyright Mike Magee 1995 my email address is now mike.magee@btinternet.com web site: www.shivashakti.com"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"In eight short chapters, DevÌ expounds the essence of her worship,sometimes in the most beautiful of language. But the uncanny side of Kaulaand KËlÌ worship is dwelt on in great detail, with references to siddhis ----magical powers ---- including a mysterious process where the tËntrik adeptleaves his body at night, apparently so he can engage in sexual intercoursewith Éaktis. Animal sacrifice also has a place in this tantra, including usingthe bones of a dead black cat to make a magical powder.The siddhis play a large part in the worship of the uncanny goddessKËlÌ. The main tËntrik rites are called the six acts (Éatkarma) of pacifying,subjugating, paralysing, obstructing, driving away, and death-dealing. Butthe KT includes others such as ParapurapraveÚana, which is the power ofreviving a corpse10; Anjana, an ointment which lets a sËdhaka see throughsolid walls; Khadga which gives invulnerability to swords; KhecarÌ, whichgives the power of flying and PËduka Siddhi, magical sandals which takeyou great distances, rather like seven league boots.Certainly, the importance of having a suitable Éakti forms the essence ofthe instructions DevÌ gives to Éiva. DevÌ here takes the form ofMahiÛamardinÌ, more popularly known as DurgË, who destroyed the twoarch-demons Éumbha and NiÚumbha in an epic battle between the goddessand the throng of demons. It was at this time, according to legend, thatDurgË created KËlÌ, emanating her out of her third eye.We learn more of DurgË’s legends and myths from the KËlikËpurËÙa (KP),an influential source. The DevÌ, MahËmËyË, appeared as BhadrakËlÌ ---- identicalwith MahiÛËmardinÌ ---- in order to slay the demon MahiÛË. He had fallen into adeep sleep on a mountain and had a terrible dream in which BhadrakËlÌ cutasunder his head with her sword and drank his blood. The demon started to worship BhadrakËlÌ and when MahËmËyË appearedto him again in a later age to slaughter him again, he asked a boon of her.DevÌ replied that he could have his boon, and he asked her for the favourthat he would never leave the service of her feet again. DevÌ replied thathis boon was granted. ‘‘When you have been killed by me in the fight, Odemon MahiÛa, you shall never leave my feet, there is no doubt about it. Inevery place where worship of me takes place, there (will be worship) ofyou; as regards your body, O DËnava, it is to be worshipped and meditatedupon at the same time.’’11 For this reason, the image of MahiÛamardinÌalways has her trampling the buffalo MahiÛa.The Magic of Kali310According to some it means the ability to enter another’s living body.11KËlikËpurËÙa, ch.62, 107-108. this document is copyright Mike Magee 1995 my email address is now mike.magee@btinternet.com web site: www.shivashakti.com"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"When She, the goddess, is dark, She is DevÌ KËlikË, an equally highsymbol of death and destruction. Throughout Her different manifestationsand phases, She remains the one true goddess, Éakti, energy itself. She issymbolised by the yoni and the female cycle, which also shows waxing andwaning throughout the month. Her spouse, Éiva, is symbolised by the Sun,by the phallus, by sperm, and as an emblem of consciousness withoutattributes. According to the tËntrik phraseology ‘‘Only when Éiva is unitedwith Éakti has Éiva power to act. Otherwise he is a corpse (Éava).’’ Another black deity of the Indian sub-continent has a close connectionwith KËlÌ ---- KÎÛÙa. According to the KËlÌvilËsa Tantra (KaT), he was bornfrom the golden goddess GaurÌ, who turned black after she was hit by anarrow from the Indian Cupid, KËma.KËlÌ is Éakti, the great goddess, creating the three gunas: sattvas, rajasand tamas12. These principles are the substance of she whose play (lila) istheir modification. KËlÌ is the first and foremost of the ten aspects of thegoddess. She is pure sattvas, pure spirit.A sËdhaka (male) or a sËdhvika (female) can worship DevÌ in any of tenforms for the fruition of desires. Her ten major forms are KËlÌ, TËrË,Éodasi, BhuvaneÚvarÌ, BhairavÌ, ChinnamastË, DhÍmËvatÌ, BagalË, MËtaÔgÌand Kamala13. To a sËdhaka, to know these is to know the universe, as sheis both space and time and beyond these categories. Each form has its owndhyËna (meditation), yantra (diagram), mantra (sound form) and sËdhana(actions).MahËvidyË KËlÌ is the primordial DevÌ who is the root of all the GreatKnowledges (mahËvidyË). Worshipped by sËdhakas and sËdhvikas, her outerforms are fearful. She destroys time, is time, and is the night of eternity.KËlÌ, certainly in the left hand tËntrik tradition14, requires sexualintercourse as part of her worship. According to Sir John Woodroffe, in hisintroduction to the KarpÍrËdi Stotra (KS), for paÚus ---- those of a basedisposition ---- sexual sËdhana at night is forbidden. ‘‘The PaÚu is still boundby the paÚa (bonds) of desire, etc., and he is, therefore, not adhikËri15, forthat which, if undertaken by the unfit, will only make these bondsstronger.’’4Inner Secrets of a Tantrik Goddess12The three gunas in their various permutation create all the fabric of the universe, including the fiveelements, skin, blood, etc.13These aspects are known as the ten mahËvidyËs.14The term left hand path has been subject to much misunderstanding. According to the texts themselves, lefthand is that in which VËmË (woman and left) enters. The right hand path does not include the sexualcomponent.15This word here has the meaning of ready.this document is copyright Mike Magee 1995 my email address is now mike.magee@btinternet.com web site: www.shivashakti.com"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Verse 10 of the KS spells out the practice. ‘‘If by night, Thy devoteeunclothed, with dishevelled hair, recites whilst meditating on Thee, thymantra, when with his Éakti youthful, full-breasted, and heavy-hipped suchan one makes all powers subject to him and dwells on the earth ever aseer.’’ The KËlÌ sËdhana takes place on a Tuesday, at midnight, in thecremation ground. Here, surrounded by jackals, owls and other uncannycreatures of the night, the sËdhaka and his Úakti select a newly dead malecorpse, which should be, according to the texts, of a young man ----preferably a king, a hero or a warrior. If he has recently died in battle, somuch the better. Placing the corpse face downwards, the two draw theKËlÌyantra on his back, offer each other food, wine and other good things,and then commence the act of ritual sex. At the close of intercourse, theman offers his Éakti one of her public hairs smeared with his semen and, ifshe is menstruating, blood.Woodroffe says that the worship of KËlÌ in the paÚu mode is totallyforbidden by Éiva, quoting the influential Niruttara Tantra (NT) as hissource. ‘‘By the worship of KËlÌ without DivyabhËva and VÌrabhËva theworshipper suffers pain at every step and goes to hell. If a man who is ofthe PaÚubhËva worships KËlÌ then he goes to the Raurava Hell until thetime of final dissolution.’’As to the matter of a suitable Úakti for the sexual rites of KËlÌ, the NTsuggests that when a sËdhaka has already achieved success with his ownÚakti, he may then worship another woman. But Woodroffe claims thisother woman is the supreme Éakti in the sËdhaka’s own body.The cremation ground is often interpreted as the place where all desiresare burnt away. Before realising kaivalya (liberation), the sËdhaka mustburn away all the taboos and conditionings which prevent this liberation.The cremation ground (ÚmaÚËna) is also the supreme nËdi or channelwithin the human organism ---- the suÛumnË16, the royal road ofKundalinÌ17. On the sËdhaka within the ÚmaÚËna yantra is Éakti, bothentwined in close sexual embrace. She is the human form of KËlÌ, as he isthe human form of Éiva18. Both are forever united. The NT says (2, 27)‘‘The cremation ground is of two kinds, O DevÌ, the pyre and the renownedyoni. Éiva is the phallus, KuleÚËni! So MahËkËla said.’’The Magic of Kali516The central channel of bio-energy within the spine of a human being.17The DevÌ or goddess coiled up three and a half times at the base of the spine. When she unfolds and entersthe suÛumnË, the bliss of this cosmic orgasm causes the universe to disappear.18The witness or observer.

Verse 19 says that worshippers ofKËlÌ who sacrifice the flesh of cats, camels, sheep, buffaloes, goats andmen to her become accomplished. A commentary by a Kaula, VimalËnandaSvËmÌ, claims these animals represent the six enemies with the goatrepresenting lust, the buffalo anger, the cat greed, the sheep delusion, thecamel envy. Man represents pride. However, according to other sources,only a king may perform sacrifice of a man. At the great temple of theDevÌ at KamËkhyË in Assam20, archaeological evidence indicates that in thepast kings did perform such sacrifices.Who, then, is KËlÌ? DevÌ gives her own description in the KC.‘‘I am Great Nature, consciousness, bliss, the quintessence, devotedlypraised. Where I am, there are no BrahmË, Hara, Éambhu or other devas,nor is there creation, maintenance or dissolution. Where I am, there is noattachment, happiness, sadness, liberation, goodness, faith, atheism, guru ordisciple.‘‘When I, desiring creation, cover myself with my MËyË21 and becometriple and ecstatic in my wanton love play, I am Vikarini, giving rise to thevarious things.‘‘The five elements and the 108 liÔgams22 arise, while Brahma and theother devas, the three worlds, Bhur-Bhuvah-Svah23 spontaneously come intomanifestation.‘‘By mutual differences of Éiva and Éakti, the (three) gunas originate. Allthings, such as BrahmË and so forth, are my parts, born from my being.Dividing and blending, the various tantras, mantras and kulas manifest.After withdrawing the five fold universe, I, LalitË, become of the nature ofnirvana. Once more, men, great nature, egoism, the five elements, sattvas,rajas and tamas become manifested. This universe of parts appears and isthen dissolved.6Inner Secrets of a Tantrik Goddess19These three forms represent the powers of creation, maintenance and destruction. They have their Éakticounterparts.20The site is renowned for Éakti worship because of a legend that ViÚÙu once cut the body of Éakti into 50pieces with his discus. These parts represent the letters of the Sanskrit alphabet and are the sites of pÌthas orsacred sites of DevÌ. The yoni of Éakti fell at this spot, making it the most sacred of all.21The great power of Éakti to delude all created things through Her play.22The liÔgam is the phallus or emblem of Éiva. The allusion to the number 108 is to a cosmology in whichbreath is time.

Here, her naturebecomes clear and apparent. For an adept in the worship of KËlÌ, the wholeworld is a ÚmaÚËna (cremation ground), and She, the true form of time,who by herself creates and destroys all, is personified as the pyre.There, after life, all mortals and their wishes, dreams and reflectionscome to their fruition, a pile of worthless ashes. Yet, as with most othertËntrik symbolism, the meaning of this cremation pyre operates on multiplelevels. The pyre is also the yoni25 of the DevÌ, and the pile of ashes thesperm left after consummation of sexual intercourse. Or, inwardly, the pyreis the great fire at the end of time26, situated within the centre of the spine,generating great bliss but, at the same time, also burning up all internalillusions during the bliss of realisation.Certainly, it is a dangerous practice to look on the face of death withoutany fear. It requires heroism, so the sËdhana is the province of a vÌra27,who dares to look into KËlÌ’s three burning eyes and be consumed by herall-devouring and pitiless fire. Mere paÚus are too frightened to face the death of egoism, whethersymbolised by their mental complex or their physical form.28Some tantras go into great detail about the nature of the corpse asËdhaka should use for his sËdhana. The KaulËvalÌnirnaya says that itshould be well preserved, and the body of a healthy man who was young,24The usual days are the 8th and the 14th of the dark fortnight, held especially sacred to the goddess.25The female sexual organ, held by tËntrikas of the left hand path to be the most sacred and highest thing.See the Yoni Tantra.26When the universe ends, Hindus hold that everything in it is consumed by fire, preceding another newcreation and another new universe.27One of the three classifications of tËntrikas. The others are the Divya or divine disposition and the PaÚu oranimal nature. The hero, or VÌra, takes on the task of facing terrible things to reach liberation (Kaivalya).28 See diagram at the end of the book.

But beforea practitioner can begin to use a mantra for its purpose ---- be it simpledevotion, acts of magic or for other purposes ---- the root or basic mantramust be brought to life.For these reasons, the tantras of KËlÌ prescribe a preparatory rite(puraÚcaraÙa, see below), which has the effect of infusing the life of adevotee into a mantra.Given the peculiarly left hand emphasis of KËlÌ and her tantras, it’s notsurprising to find that there are alternative methods to simply reciting hermantra 10,000 times during the course of a day63.Her seed or bÌja mantra ---- KrÌÑ ---- has no recognisable meaning,although various tËntrik definitions are forced on it by differentcommentators. For example, Sir John Woodroffe in his Garland of Letterstranslates a verse from the VaradË Tantra saying Ka is KËlÌ, Ra is BrahmË,is MahËmËyË, NËda is the mother of the universe, and the bindu means thedispeller of sorrow. This hardly goes any distance to explaining why thesebÌja mantras of the different tËntrik devatËs have their particular forms. Forexample, the same tantra breaks HrÌÑ down into its components ---- but theletter Ra here takes on the meaning of PrakÎti64.Even Kashmir Éaivism ---- which delves deeply into the whole topic ----fails, in my view, to provide any coherent rationale behind the bÌja mantras.Nor does KËlÌ’s 22 letter mantra vidyË have any particular structure to itapart from its rythmic pattern. And KËlÌ devotees would have it no otherway. They say that the ÎÛi who first sounded the mantra gave birth to it,and that’s good enough for them. It represents KËlikË in sound form, in her63The left hand method has the Éiva and the Éakti united in sexual intercourse, during the course of whichboth recite the appropriate mantras.64The goddess as nature.this document is copyright Mike Magee 1995 my email address is now mike.magee@btinternet.com web site: www.shivashakti.com"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"entirety, and should not be expected to have any meaning beyond what it isin itself.It is possible in very broad terms to say that any DevÌ with a rootmantra including bÌjas such as HrÌÑ, HÍÑ, and PhaÖ must be alluring,powerful and forbidding. On the other hand, DevÌs with mantras includingÉrÌÑ and KlÌÑ are beneficent and sexually-oriented65.ÉrÌ VimalËnanda ÉvËmÌ, who provides an introduction and a commentaryto Woodroffe’s Hymn to KËlÌ, goes too far in his correlations betweenKrÌÑ, KÎÛÙa, and Christ. But there are connections between KÎÛÙa andKËlÌ. The KaulËvalÌnirnayatantra says that worshipping KËlÌ, TËrË andUnmukhÌ in the Kali Yuga is especially beneficial, while theÉrÌmadbhËgavata ---- according to Woodroffe ---- says that while ViÛÙuincarnated in other colours in previous Yugas, in the Kali Yuga he takes ablack form. See the illustration of KÎÛÙa as KËlÌ, as an example of this.The subsidiary KËlÌ mantras ---- many of which appear in this chapter ----are generally variations of KËlÌ’s 22 syllable root mantra.It’s worth explaining here the gloss which accompanies many suchtËntrik mantras. Each mantra, to be anything other than lifeless sound,needs to have been seen by a ÎÛi. It must also have an application, a metrefor pronouncing it, such as the GËyatrÌ form, a bÌja, a Éakti and a peg orkÌlaka. These last three need some explanation, and the inner view of the adeptsseems to be that the bÌja or seed impregnates the Éakti, while the peg isthat which holds them together. Unless a mantra has all of thesecomponents, it isn’t a mantra, it hasn’t been conceived, born, or seen by aÎÛi. The metre is straightforward enough ---- Sanskrit has a stronglydeveloped verse structure, much as Greek had Iambic pentameters and otherverse forms.Preparation of mantraDevÌ, now I declare the preparatory sËdhana (puraÚcaraÙa) which givessiddhi to a mantra.As a jÌva is weak, and not capable of all acts, he should do this.

The DevÌ can bemeditated on as sound (mantra), as a geometrical shape (yantra) or usingone of her images (murtÌ).The DevÌ yantras have certain elements in common. In the centre of thediagram there is usually a downward pointing triangle. In the centre of thistriangle there may be a dot or bindu, representing her immanent nature.Each of the points of the central triangle represents one of Her gunas orqualities of active, passive and reconciling. The triangle or group oftriangles is surrounded by one or more rings of lotus petals, circles andthen an enclosing wall (the bhupura).Unlike Tibetan maÙalas, yantras are always worshipped flat, representingthe generative organs of the goddess. They can be worshipped from theoutside in or from the inside out, depending on the nature of theÉakti.74Unless a yantra is inscribed with bÌja mantras, it is merely a design.The DakÚiÙË KËlÌ yantra conforms to the general pattern of all Éaktiyantras but has its own particular form (see diagram, facing title page). Inthe centre is a group of five triangles. Each point represents one of thefifteen KËlÌ NityËs or eternities, one for each day of the waning Moon.In the eight petals are eight Bhairavas and eight BhairavÌs, couplingtogether. Bhairava means terrifying, and these couples are particularisedaspects of DakÚiÙË KËlikË conforming to the eight tËntrik directions. This isalso the Kaula circle where males and females congregate on one of thedark days of the Moon to perform their uncanny rites. (See Chapter One).Yantras can be drawn, engraved, painted or built on a variety ofsubstances. The classical eight surfaces are gold, silver, copper, crystal,74The DevÌs giving rise to the world are worshipped from the centre to the periphery, while the DevÌs whodissolve the universe are worshipped from the outside to the centre.this document is copyright Mike Magee 1995 my email address is now mike.magee@btinternet.com web site: www.shivashakti.com"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"birch (bhurja) bark, bone, hide (which can include any kind of skin), andViÚÙu stone (salagrama).

After doing hand and limb nyËsa, the sËdhaka should meditate on thethrone of the DevÌ as being in his heart. Then he should draw the yantraand place it on a gold-coloured pedestal, installing breath into it. It can besmeared with kunda, gola or udbhava menstrual blood75, with the eightclassical tËntrik perfumes or with a man’s semen.

The flower is then placedin the centre of the yantra and at this point she is considered to be actuallypresent and is worshipped with the range of ritual accessories, perfumes,and so forth. At the end of pÍja, the DevÌ is withdrawn, using the flower,and re-installed in the heart of the sËdhaka.Carrying a yantra about the person is considered to be a highly potentway of concentrating magical power. The time to do so is determinedastrologically. The yantra is drawn using the eight perfumes. Outside it,write the root mantra and outside this write the armour (kavaca) and theDevÌ’s 1,000 names. Invoke the DevÌ into the yantra, then entwine it withgold and silver thread, place it in a metal holder and wear it.Yantras without bÌja mantras are considered to be dead.

Theyare SÎÚti KËlÌ, SaÑhËra KËlÌ, Rakta KËlÌ, Sva KËlÌ, Yama KËlÌ, MÎtyu KËlÌ,Rudra or BhadrË KËlÌ, ParamËrka KËlÌ, MËrtaÙda KËlÌ, KËlËgni Rudra KËlÌand MahË KËlÌ, with MahËbhairavaghoracanda KËlÌ being the thirteenth,according to the TantrËloka of Abhinavagupta.But whether these are identical with the other sets encountered is moot.Abhinavagupta declares these twelve forms to be the ‘great cakra of thetwelve rays’ which might well refer to a form of KËlÌ identified with thetwelve signs of the zodiac.Be that as it may, the form usually encountered in tËntrik literature isthat of DakÚiÙË KËlikË. In the KarpÍrËdistotra, she has dishevelled hair, agaping mouth trickling with blood, holding a sword in her upper left hand,a severed head in her lower left hand, dispelling fears with her upper righthand and granting boons with her lower left hand. She is very youthful, has large rising breasts, wears a necklace ofsevered heads, a girdle of dead men’s arms, and enjoys reverse sexualintercourse with MahËkËla in the cremation ground. Around them are pyres,corpses, skulls, bones and jackals.What then are we to make of this image? There are different ways ofinterpreting this powerful scene. The shamanistic rites DakÚiÙË KËlikË andMahËkËla engage in may hark back to the days before Brahminism cast itsVedic rays upon the native aboriginal traditions of the sub-continent.We should not forget either that KËlikË is the DevÌ of the Kaula sect,which flouted orthodoxy by engaging in practices not sanctioned by Vedaincluding drinking alcohol, having sex with the outcaste, and touchingimpure objects like dead bodies.Freedom, according to the precepts of this school, doesn’t depend onmonogamy, nor is it something to be achieved by following sets of rules.this document is copyright Mike Magee 1995 my email address is now mike.magee@btinternet.com web site: www.shivashakti.com"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"The gnostic Kaulas advised their disciples to look within, to a place wheregood behaviour was determined not by etiquette but by what you really are.The contrast between darkness and light is illustrated most graphicallyby KËlikË’s fifteen NityËs, or eternities, each of which corresponds to oneof the days of the waning Moon. The beneficent side of the DevÌ is shown in the fifteen NityËs of LalitË,KËlÌ’s counterpart. They represent the fifteen days of the waxing Moon84.Although She changes her form, just as the Moon waxes and wanes, Sheis one, not many. She is death (KËlÌ) and sexuality (LalitË).

BrahmË liked his daughter and wanted to couple with her. Butthat didn’t meet with the approval of Éiva, who cut off his fifth head. BrahmË and Éiva had a great fight,which the latter won. Éiva, however, had committed the sin of killing a Brahmin, an act requiring expiation.Forever afterwards, Éiva in his form of Bhairava, the terrible one, bears the fifth head of BrahmË.96So followers of Éiva have a licence to kill brahmins!

To counter these tendencies, some wrote upaniÛads to giveVedic legitimacy to what was essentially a non-Vedic religion.There arecountless so-called tËntrik upaniÛads ---- mostly small digests of the essenceof larger tantras. They are, usually, late and somewhat inferiorcompilations.The word UpaniÛad means derived from oral tradition; they are usuallywritten in extremely terse verses called sutras and for this reason can behard to follow unless you are familiar with the traditions they embody.However, this terseness can be an advantage ---- they do at least sum up aparticular tradition or school in a neat manner.The orthodox view of these texts is summed up by Dr. A.G. KrishnaWarrier in his introduction to a few, mostly ÉrÌ VidyË texts entitled ÉËktaUpaniÛads (SU). ‘‘On the whole it seems right to conjecture that the ÉËktaUpaniÛads have been composed with the definite purpose of linking theAdvaitic view of the universe with a colourful and heart-warmingceremonial, thus rescuing from evil repute a somewhat antique system ofworship whose degradation had been brought about, in course of time, bythe admixture of certain unhealthy practices. This may explain the omissionof the Kaula UpaniÛad from the list of the ÉËkta UpaniÛads.’’111This is a little straitlaced of the good professor. He means the sexualrites of the left hand path by ‘certain unhealthy practices’ and calling thetËntrik tradition ‘somewhat antique’ is more than a little disingenuous. Infact, most of the practices in mediaeval and modern Hinduism stem fromthe tËntrik works and have little or nothing to do with the Vedas. Asexamples, we can cite pÍja, temple worship, pilgrimage, sacred sites,111SU, page xiii.this document is copyright Mike Magee 1995 my email address is now mike.magee@btinternet.com web site: www.shivashakti.com"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"yantras and a host of other instances.

Itschief interest is that it contains the daily pÍjas of TËrË, KËlÌ and Éiva.PaÖala one deals with the ten mahËvidyËs114 and their consorts. DhÍmËvatÌ,the widow form, is not allocated a consort. At the close of the chapter, theessential tËntrik view that Éiva as witness is not involved in creation,maintenance or withdrawal is described.Éiva, in the second chapter, tells Éakti of yoga and describes the body asresembling a tree. There is no difference between the macrocosm or themicrocosm. The supreme mantra is haÑsa, equivalent to 21,600 breaths in aday115.In chapter three, the different forms and mantras of KËlÌ are described,along with the saÑdhya mantras116 of both KËlÌ and TËrË. KËlÌ’s daily ritesare detailed.The fourth chapter deals with TËrË’s pÍja, giving a beautiful meditationalimage of her as situated in the centre of a lovely island, seated on a lionthrone under a jewelled pavilion. Chapter five turns to ÉambhunËtha (Éiva).In this yuga, sËdhakas should not worship his form known asNÌlakaÙÖha117. One should never worship Éakti unless Éiva is firstworshipped, preferably with a clay liÔga.114The mahËvidyËs are dealt with in chapter 10 of this tantra. They are KËlÌ, TËrË, SundarÌ, BhuvaneÚvarÌ,ChinnamastË, BhairavÌ, DhÍmËvatÌ, BagalË, MËtangÌ, and KamalË. According to Alain Danielou’s HinduPolytheism, these ten aspects of Éakti are the epitome of the entire creation.115The letter Ha is Éiva while the letter Sa is Éakti. According to ancient texts, breath is time. An individualinhales once every four seconds and exhales once every four seconds. One is a solar breath and one a lunarbreath. See Tantrik Astrology.116The four tËntrik twilights of dawn, midday, sunset and midnight, when the currents of prËÙËyËma changedirection and the sËdhaka can do his pÍja knowing he is close to the in-betweenness which is the essence oftantra.117An aspect of Éiva. At the churning of the milk ocean, at the beginning of time, Éiva swallowed the poisonwhich stained his throat a deep blue. It is unclear, however, why this tantra prohibits his worship.this document is copyright Mike Magee 1995 my email address is now mike.magee@btinternet.com web site: www.shivashakti.com"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"In chapter six, Éiva gives the vËsanË or inner meanings of KËlÌ and TËrËmantras KrÌÑ and StrÌÑ. The different letters of the mantras are placed onseparate parts of the human body. The seventh chapter speaks of yoga andof the seven islands and of their locations in the body. KËmarÍpa is in themÍlËdhËra cakra. Other sacred centres are also situated in the body118.Chapter eight continues the previous topic. The body is permeated withmillions of nËdis and the elements have their place there too. In chapternine, Éiva speaks of the SundarÌ mantra. Even though Éiva has already spoken of it in the NityË Tantra, Éaktiasks him to reveal its true meaning. Éiva says that 21,600 is the head of theletters of the alphabet and the true rosary in the thousand petalled lotus.Details of the rosary follow. Using tËntrik methods, sËdhakas can be bothliberated and enjoy.The last chapter equates ViÚÙu’s ten incarnations with the tenmahËvidyËs.

He is yet to come, and when he does he will be born in Shambhala. Hewill ride a white horse and hold a sword which blazes like fire, bringing back to the planet harmony,according to the Agni and other PurËÙas.120This was the poison swalled by Éiva in his aspect as NÌlakaÙÖha (see above).

Clearly,without Éakti, the primordial god is lifeless and cannot act.PaÖala TwoÉrÌ Éiva said: Listen, O DevÌ, I will speak concisely of the essence of yoga.The body resembles a tree, with the root above and the branches below. Inthe macrocosm there are tirthas124 which also exist in the body. Themacrocosm is like the microcosm.There are thirty five million tirthas and seventy two thousand lights inthe macrocosm. In the heart of the fourteen worlds are three great lights.And, supreme DevÌ, in the middle of these is a very stable thing whichbestows liberation. MahËmËyË, the queen of all serpents, has the appearanceand shape of a serpent. Coiled up three and a half times, she is the dwellerin the seven underworlds.Now listen closely [to the names] of the underworlds. Atala, Pitala,Sutala, Talatala, Mahatala, Patala and then Rasatala. Above the last is theSatya [heaven] in which the great steady thing is situated.In the centre of Meru125 is a nËdi which is very stable and givesliberation. The macrocosm is called MahËviÛÙu or Éiva. When it manifests,it is eternally pervaded by the Queen of Serpents, who, having pierced thesix heavens, has outstretched herself as the Queen of Snakes126Above this, all the oceans extend. So, in their due order, the nËdis cometo be situated in the body. In the centre is the SuÛumnË, with the vitalbreath being in the two nËdis idË and piÔgalË127.74Inner Secrets of a Tantrik Goddess123This verse enunciates the philosophical basis of the Éakti cult. Éiva is the observer, pure awareness itself,consciousness. Éakti is the manifest universe. Only when the two are in conjunction can Éiva act throughthe triple Éaktis. Éiva is thus the bindu at the centre of the triangle in a yantra, as inseparate from Éakti asheat from a flame.124Sacred bathing spots, tanks, wells and springs125This is Mount Meru, considered to be at the centre of this mythical view of the universe. However, Hinduastronomers knew the earth rotated around the sun, and this mythocentrical cosmos described here isregarded as solely for meditation.126A description of the DevÌ as the Éakti KuÙdalinÌ.127Coiled around the central nËdi which is Sun-Moon are two other nËdis. The idË is the lunar nËdi while thepiÔgalË is the solar nadi. When breath enters the central channel, the SuÛumnË, time stops.

The last letter, KÛa, is in the fontanelle. If someone then repeats the mantra, he attains the state of immortality.When the vital breath is expelled, Kamini DevÌ leaves the body. Thereforenever recite the mantra in this state, because recitationthen means death.When breath is expelled, the rosary is cut. This is true, O Suravandita. Ihave said before that death comes from the thread being cut. So, CharmingOne, I have told you the method called MÎtyunjaya.135Otherwise, a person may fix his attention on the point at the root of hisnose concentratedly, drawing together the vital breath and expelling it withone exhalation. PËrvatÌ, if he then recites the rosary mantra, the sixteensyllable mantra or the eighteen syllable mantra 1,000 times daily, havingconquered death, fever and disease, he lives a long time. Doing other thanthis, one become greatly diseased, and the object of enjoyment is notachieved.Supreme DevÌ, the rules relating to another method are declared in theDamara (Tantra). A person should worship DevÌ BhÍtakËtyËyanÌ carefully.Doing so, he lives for 5,000 years, there is no doubt about it. So I havespoken of everything relating to the protection of the body.An enjoyer (bhogin) does not attain yoga, and a yogi does not attainenjoyment (bhoga). But, DeveÚÌ, using this tattva, a person achieves bothenjoyment (bhoga) and yoga.ÉrÌ DevÌ said: What results happen when a man recites each of therosaries. MahËdeva, speak separately about each of the fruits arising fromthe six lotus rosaries.ÉrÌ Éiva said: Reciting in the four-fold MÍlËdhËra makes one a lover onearth. From reciting in the SvËdhiÛÖhËna, one becomes greater thanMahendra and long-lived. By reciting in the MaÙipÍra, one becomeshymned in heaven. From reciting in the great anahata lotus, one achievesequality with Brahma. By reciting in the ViÚuddha, one dwells in ViÛÙu’sheaven, most certainly. If reciting in the AjÕa cakra, one dwells always inthe Tattva Island.O Supreme DevÌ, the exoteric rosaries are the famous six rosaries.

This is a reflection or shadow of the 36th tattva with a mentalapparatus which is itself also a reflection of Iccha, Jnana and Kriya ÉaktÌs.For instance, the ‘‘I’’, the ahamkar, is the reflection of Iccha.This limited individual has powers of action and powers of knowledgeand focuses on the tanmËtras, or impression objects, considering herself orhimself to be different from the five verities.In this form, she or he plays in the world until realising the 36th tattvawhich is Éiva-ÉaktÌ itself, immanent in the universe and vibrating with thepower of sound.
