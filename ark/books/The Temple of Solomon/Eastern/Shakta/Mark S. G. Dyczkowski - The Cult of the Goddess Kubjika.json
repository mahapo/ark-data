The cult of this obscure goddess1 will be compared with that of the much better known goddess Kali, and references will occasionally be made to the goddess Tripura. The latter, like Kubjika, figures prominently right from the start of her history in the Sakta Kaula Tantras,2 the former emerges initially in the Bhairava Tantras3 and as a member of the Kaula pantheon. For those interested in Nepalese studies an important common feature of these three goddesses and their ectypes is the central position they have held for several centuries in the esoteric Tantrism of high-caste Hindu Newars as their lineage (kula) deities. Thus the aim of this paper is twofold. One is to present a general overview of some salient features of the typology of these forms of the sacred. The other is to present a brief introduction to Newar Saktism as the context in which the goddess Kubjika has been worshipped for most of her history. One of the most basic features of the complex and multi-layered religion of the Newars is the thoroughness with which it has been permeated with Tantrism. This is true of both Newar Buddhism and Hinduism. In what follows I will deal exclusively * I should take this opportunity to gratefully acknowledge Prof. Wezler and the members of his team in the Nepal Research Centre who have made this publication possible. I should particularly thank Dr. Mathes for his sincere and unfailing assistance and Mr. Pierce for his excellent editorial work. Without him this publication would be far more imperfect than it is. I should also mention Nutan Sarma who has worked as an assistant for me and Pt. Gurusekara Sarma who introduced me to the living tradition of the goddess Kubjika. Thandvar Timilsina and Divii.kar Acarya who have contributed much to my understanding of Tantra by our lively discussions, Kedar Raj Rajopadhyaya who is both a dear friend and my guru in a very real sense and Niels Gutschow who generously offered his hospitality and advice. I am also grateful to Prof. Padoux who was so kind as· to read through this essay and offer his suggestions. I acknowledge with gratitude and deep sense of humility, the inspiration I received from Prof. Sanderson who some twenty years ago suggested I research the cult of the goddess Kubjika and Sviimi Lak�manju of Shrinagar, who initiated me into Kashmiri Saivism. I should not omit to mention my dear wife and children and my parents who always selflessly stood by me. The many others, such as David White and Rii.I)a Singh, who have helped and instructed me will forgive me if I do not mention them all individually and should rest assured of my sincere appreciation of their contribution to the development of this research. See Dyczkowski 1987a: 95ff. for a summary of the work published up to that time on this goddess. Since then more work has been published. See the bibliography. 2 I refer here to the Kaula Tantras as Sii.kta, not in a technical, but a descriptive sense. Sii.kta as a technical term denoting those cults, scriptures, or people associated with the worship of the goddess as Sakti (meaning literally 'power') is absent from the terminology of the Tantras prior to the eleventh century. Instead we find the term Kula and its cognate Kaula. According to Abhinavagupta (PTv pp. 32f;. see Pandey 1963: 594f.), the term Kula, is derived from the root kul which means 'coming together as a group'. Thus, in a non-technical sense, the word kula means 'family'. A wide range of symbolic meanings that refer to metaphysical and yogic concepts are found in this term by Tantric exegetes. Amongst the Newars the non-technical sense is never forgotten. Kula is not just the divine family, that is, the aggregate of the god's energies gathered together in the figure of his Tantric consort. It is also the human family of the goddess's disciples who, amongst the Newars, are also literally related. 3 Concerning the Bhairava Tantras, see Dyczkowski 1987a: 42ff., also below."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"2 THE CULT OF THE GODDESS KUBJIKA with the latter. In Nepal, as elsewhere, Hinduism displays a remarkable capacity to preserve and maintain older forms of religion alongside the newer, giving each its place in the economy of the expanded whole. Thus, for example, the present Gorkhali kings, like the Malia kings before them, are still considered to be incarnations of Vi�Qu, and Siva Pasupati remains, as he has been for centuries, the patron .god of Nepal. These gods along with the ubiquitous Bhairava, Siva's wrathful form, and the goddess Durga, otherwise known as Bhagavati, and the eight Mother goddesses (mii trka) who are arranged in protective circles around the Kathmandu Valley and its major cities, the many GaQesas who protect the quarters of Newar towns, villages and countryside are the basic constituents of the Newars' public religion. They are the.gods of the 'outside' public domain, what Levy has aptly called the 'civic space' or 'mesocosm'. Easily accessible to researchers, they have been the object of a great deal of study. But there is another 'inner' secret domain that is the Newars' 'microcosm'. This does not form a part of the sacred geography of the Newar civitas, although, from the initiates' point of view, it is the source and reason of much of it. The deities that populate this 'inner space' and their rites are closely guarded secrets and, often, they are the secret identity of the public deities, known only to initiates. The two domains complement each other. The outer is dominantly male. It is the domain of the attendants and protectors of both the civic space and the inner expanse, which is dominantly female. By this I mean that while the deities in the public domain may be both male and female, the male dominates the female, while the secret lineage deities of the higher castes are invariably femaie accompanied by male consorts. The interplay of these two polarities generates the complex structures of Newar religion. Again, this, the inner domain is layered and graded in hierarchies of deepening and more elevated esoterism that ranges from the individual to his family group, clan, caste, and out through the complex interrelationships that make up Newar society. Thus the interplay between the inner and outer domains is maintained both by the secrecy in which it is grounded and one of the most characteristic features of Newar Tantrism as a whole, namely, its close relationship to the Newar caste system.4 It is commonly accepted by Tantrics everywhere that the teachings of the Tantras should be kept secret, although in actual practice the degree to which secrecy is maintained varies and the Newars are amongst the most orthodox in this respect. 4 Quigley confirms that one of the aspects of Newar society on which everyone is more or less agreed is that \"caste divisions are underscored, as are all aspects of Newar social life, by pervasive ritual. While certain rituals bring togther all the inhabitants of a particular settlement, many others are primarily oriented to an individual or a particular kinship group - a household, for example, or a group of affines, or perhaps a lineage.\" (Gellner and Quigley 1995: 300). Especially important amongst the 'many others' for the higher castes are Tantric rituals."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"MARKS. G. DYCZKOWSKI 3 But this other feature of Newar Tantrism is in striking contrast to the precepts of the Tantras, especially the Kaula Tantras that tirelessly admonish equality.5 The qualifications required of an aspirant are not· those of birth but purity of conduct. Accordingly, the Tantras devote long sections to listing the qualities required of the disciple and those of the teacher. The teacher must examine the disciple to see if he is devoted to the teacher and the deity. Like the teacher, he must be a moral person and not deceitful. Caste status is never a consideration .. Indeed, those of low caste are believed to have a special power by virtue of their low status - thus reversing the common view that those of high caste, especially Brahmins, possess it. The Newars are well aware of this principle, which is well exemplified by the many well-known stories of the life and exploits of the Brahmin Gayapati, better known as Gayal)bajya, who was instructed in the use of mantras by an outcaste (pot,le ). 6 ft is w<;>rth stressing that although the Tantras enjoin that when initiates sit together to perform their Tantric rites there should be no caste distinctions, they become operant once more when the ritual ends. The two domains, the 'inner' Tantric and the 'outer' Sniii rta, are treated independently. Thus, for example, once the aspirant has received initiation in the Tantric cult of Svacchandabhairava, which is an important part of Newar esoterism, as it was of Kashmiri, the Svacchandabhairavatantra prescribes expiation for anyone who even mentions prior caste: pragjatyudira�d devi prayascittr bhaven nara� I (SvT 4/544b; cf. ibid. 4/414. Abhinavagupta enjoins the same for Trika Saivites in TA 15/576). Further on, however, the Tantra enjoins that 'one should not criticize the Smarta religion which teaches the path of right conduct.' smartam dharmam na nindet tu acarapathadarsakam (ibid. 5/45; see Arraj 1988: 29 - 30 fn. 2. Note, however, that at the same time strict distinctions were �aintained between initiates of di fferent Tantric traditions (see Dyczkowski 1987a: 166 fn. 34). In this aspect, as in many others, Tantric ritual is analogous to its Vedic predecessor. Thus Heesterman points out that after the conclusion of the Vedic sacrifice, \"about to leave the ritual enclosure, the sacrificer, whether king or commoner, returns to his normal, unchanged self in society: 'Here I am just as I am,' as he has to declare in his concluding mantra (SB 1111116; 1/9/3/23). Nothing has changed.\" 6 Gayal)biijya was almost certainly a historical figure. He was a Brahmin who lived in Sulimha, in the western part of the core area of Patan, in the sixteenth century. There are many stories of the miracles he performed by the powers he acquired with the help of an outcaste (po(ie). I am grateful to Nutan Sarma for giving me a copy of an unpublished paper called 'The Story of Gayal)bajya' in which he collects some of these stories and data establishing the historicity of Gayal)biijya. The following is a brief summary of one of the most famous of them (see N. Sharma 1991: Iff. and 1993: 46ff.). The pious GayaQ.bajya used to go daily for his morning ablutions to Mrtyuiijaya Ghii� ('Riverbank of the Conqueror of Death') at the confluence of the rivers Vagmati and Manohara. One day, on his way to the river, it began to rain very heavily. He took shelter under the roofing overhanging the nearest house, which happened to belong to an untouchable who was famous in Patan as a powerful Tantric. Inside the house a child was crying. The mother who had tried in every way to calm it, and became exasperated, laid hold of a knife and stabbed it to death. Soon afterwards, the father came home and seeing what had happened consoled his wife and, taking the child into another room, brought it back to life. Astonished by what he had seen, GayaQ.bajya took"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"4 THE CULT OF THE GODDESS KUBJIKA But this is the exception that proves the ride. In actual fact, Newars cannot choose their Tantric guru. Nor are they all allowed to have one. The rule is so rigidly applied that the 19th century chronicle, the Bhii�iivarhsiivali, meticulously lists the names of the castes whose members can 'receive mantra' and those who can give it.7 Significantly, these prescriptions are attributed to Sthitimalla, the fourteenth century king who was famous for having established the caste structure of Newar society. In actual fact, his contribution was more probably a reform and extension of a pre­existing caste system, which we know from references in much earlier inscriptions, predated him.8 But while some credence may be given to Sthitimalla's legislation of the caste system, we are not yet in a position to say to what degree, if any, he contributed to the formal ordering of esoteric Tantrism. Even so, we can say with confidence that the system, carefully graded and regulated by caste considerations, was well in place when the Bhii�iivarhsiivali was written and in all probability for a number of centuries prior to that. One of the reasons for this phenomenon is certainly the powerful influence Brahmins have had on the formation of the Newar, essentially Hindu, state through their influential patrons (yajamiina), especially the Newar kings and their officials. It is hard to resist this view when we observe that the system is constructed in such a way that when it is functioning in ideal circumstances, at least from the Newar to standing outside the untouchable's house for a while every day when he passed to take his bath. Although he was very curious, Gayabbajya was conscious of his status as a· Brahmin and so would never ask to be admitted. Then one day the outcaste asked him why he came daily to stand outside his house. Gayabbajya took the opportunity to ask the outcaste to reveal his Tantric secrets. The outcaste agreed and told him to come after four days with a bunch of wood apple leaves (belpatra), which Gayabbajya did. Then they. went together to the riverbank where the Brahmin bathed daily. The outcaste then told him to bathe. When Gayabbajya had finished, the outcaste squatting on a platform where ancestral offerings (sriiddha) are made, wrote mantras on the wood apple leaves and threw them into the river, telling Gayabbajya to eat them. When he had done so, he w astonishe_g to discover that he knew all the mantras. However, he had not acquired their power (siddhi). Instructed by the outcaste, Gayabbajya began to worship Bhurhc:Ie GaQesa in order to empower the mantras he had received. After some days, Gm�esa appeared to him and told him to go to the shrine of Balkumiiri on the night of the fourteenth day of the dark fortnight (piicahre) in March when the .Qiikini witches gather to prepare magic collyrium (mohani). This collyrium, GaQ.e§a told him, would give him the powers he sought. Eventually, Gayabbajya managed to acquire the collyrium and, smearing it on his forehead he attained the power (siddhi) he sought and became a great Tantric. 7 See Bhii�iivarhsiivali pp. 156ff. Slusser writes: \"The Indian caste system was in effect in the Nepal Valley from at least the beginning of the Licchavi Period [i.e. the fourth century], as inscriptions attest. Similarly, the complex system of subcastes that ordain Valley social behaviour must be viewed as the product of centuries of gradual accretion, not a sudden imposition of law. [ ... ] Nonetheless, Sthitimalla may well have codified the particular social patterns that had developed by his time, and thus given local custom the force of law\" (Slusser 1982: 59)."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"MARKS. G. DYCZKOWSKI 5 Brahmin's point of view, the Newar Brahmins are the sole dispensers of the vital initiation that allows access to it. The situation, then, is analogous to the monopoly Brahmins have striven to achieve throughout their history everywhere in South Asia, and wherever there are Hindus, as family priests (purohita) for the higher 'twice­born' castes. In this capacity they perform tlte smiirta rites of passage (sarhskara) that mark a Hindu's progress through life from -. )nception to death. In the case of the higher Newar castes who are entitled to receive it, the family Brahmin purohita or another Newar Brahmin, whose traditional office it is to do so, may give Tantric initiation to those members of the family who have passed through all the rites of passage preceding marriage and desire it. Thus a Newar Brahmin may be both purohita and Tantric guru.9 -Even so, the two priestly functions are always clearly distinguished. This is evidenced by the fact that they may be performed by two different Brahmins. But even in those cases, each extended Newar family lineage (phuki)10 of all but the lowest castes is traditionally associated with a specific Brahmin family who performs these functions. The initiation given to members of the higher castes, that is, the ones eligible to receive the sacred thread, is into the worship of one of the goddesses belonging to six Kula lineages (iimniiya) amongst which Kubjika, forms of Kali and Tripura are the most importanL She is the 'chosen deity' (i$(adevatii)11 and lineage goddess (kuladevatii, iimniiyadevatii) of the aspirant's extended family lineage (phuki). For a general account of these two aspects of the Newar Brahmin's function, see Toffin 1989. 10 Ishii provides a basic definition of the term phuki. He says that this term is \"used principally among males who have a close patrilineal relation to each other but reside in different households ... in a broad sense, all the members of the residential family of a person who is referred to as phuki can be called phuki as well.\" (Ishii 1987: 338 fn. 7) By 'residential family' Ishii means the household in which the members share the same kitchen. For a detailed discussion see Ishii 1995: 141-146. 11 In India the 'chosen deity' a person may have is literally that, a particular god or goddess to ·whom that individual feels especially attracted. Coincidentally, this deity may well be one that has been worshipped in his or her family. Indian kings regularly have such family deities. The Newar kings had several chosen deities. The Licchavis (fourth to ninth century) had Pasupati and Vi�QU and a goddess called Miinesvarl. The worship of Miinesvarl was maintained by the Malia kings. RaQ.ajitmalla (ruled 1722-1769 A.D.), for example, refers to her in his inscription on the side of the gate to his Bhaktapur palace as his 'chosen deity'. (In this inscription the king refers to himself as srlmatpasupaticara!J£lkamaladhulidhusaritasiroruhasrlmanmiinesvarl${adevatiivaralabdha-. See A. D. Sharma 1954 for a detailed notice of this inscription.) From the time of Sthitimalla the Mallas also adopted the goddess Taleju. She was their lineage goddess. However, this did not prevent them from having other 'outer' chosen deities. Siddhinarasimhamalla (1597 - 1619 A.D.) of Patan, for example, chose Kr�Qa for himself. His son, Srlniviisamalla chose Matysendraniitha who was, and still is, the 'chosen deity' of the city of Patan. Again, to close the circle as it were, the chosen deity of Matsyendranatha is Siddhilak�mi, the goddess Taleju (see below)."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"6 THE CULT OF THE GoDDESS KUBJIKA While certain Brahmins can give initiation to people who do not belong to their lineages, there is a second group of people who are empowered to dispense Tantric initiation only to their own family members. These are the Brahmin's assistants the Josis (astrologers) and Acajus, (both Kshatriya castes). The latter are also called Karmacaryas, which is an appellation derived from the Sanskrit name for a Kaula teacher, namely, Kramacarya. D. R. Regmi (1965-1966, 1, p. 715, quoted in Levy 1991: 356) defines their function as follows: \"These Acajus functioned as inferior priests in all Brahman led households. They accepted dak#IJ.ii (gifts in money) as well as food in their host's house .... But they could not chant the VeJic mantras and also could not conduct the [Vedic] rituals. These were done by Brahmans alone. The Acajus and Josis, however, were indispensable for any [complex] ritual. The Josi was concerned with the task of finding out an auspicious time for any kind of rite performed. The Acaju helped to arrange methodically the requirements of the ritual performance. He prepared the groundwork for the actual rite. It was left for the Brahman priest to use them.\" The Josi's functions may be much more complex than those described here. Indeed, nowadays the Josis who belong to families traditionally linked to the worship of Taleju, the Malla kings' lineage deity, have many rituals to perform in the Taleju temples of Kathmandu and Bhaktapur. In Kathmandu, the Taleju Brahmin who worships in the Malia kings' private chapel (iigafi) is assisted by a Josi, not a Karmacarya, although Karmacaryas do assist in the more lengthy occasional rites.12 In Bhaktapur, where both Josis and Karmacaryas have ritual functions in the Taleju temple (iigafi) of the Malla royal palace, the Josis have more to do than the Karmacaryas. This is certainly not the way it was in the past. This is clear from the fact that Karmacaryas in general have much more extensive priestly functions than. do Josis. Thus in Bhaktapur, for example, where Karmacaryas have, as elsewhere, numerous patrons (yajamiina) for whom they perform Tantric rituals, the Josis do not have any. This is the case even though Josis are generally considered to have a higher caste status than Karmacaryas. The latter are of varying status in different places. In Bhaktapur, where the status of such auxiliary priests in general is considered to be 12 The degree in which this relationship has been politicized is well illustrated by the reversal of roles that takes place in the Taleju temple (not to be confused with the iigan) of the Kathmandu Malia royal palace. There, the main daily officiant is a Karmacarya who is, apparently, assisted by a Newar Brahmin. The latter cooks the mixture of rice and pulse that is the deity's daily food offering (bhoga) because, in order to avoid pollution, a Brahmin must do this. Thus, although Karmacaryas have managed to take over almost all of the ritual functions in this temple and so pocket the money offering and take home most of the remains of the many food offerings financed by the Nepalese govemment,.they could not eliminate the Brahmin, who was originally their boss, altogether. But in this case, paradoxically, as he is the most senior because of his ritual purity, he has been reduced to the status of a cook."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"MARKS. G. DYCZKOWSKI 7 lower than in the other cities, there are also Acajus belonging to the farmer (jyiipu) castes. Their function, which they share with other Karmacaryas, is to worship the mother goddesses (miitrkii) who encircle and protect the city. Thus we find that there is a hierarchy of ritual agents of varying status graded 'amongst the Newars according to their caste and ritual functions. A cardinal feature of the situation as it is at present is the fact that Karmacaryas do not receive initiation from Brahmins. The latter do, however, continue to act as their purohitas and perform their smiirta life cycle rituals for them. There are reasons to believe, however, that they did originally take initiation from them. Karmacaryas assert, especially the ones of higher status, that they can compile liturgies when required, and probably have done so. But although there are many amongst them who assert that because they can do this they are not dependant on Brahmins, _it is they, nonetheless, who go to consult Brahmins when in doubt concerning ritual procedure, not the other way around. Moreover, their roles are always those of assistants, and they cannot give initiation to people outside their lineage. This is the case with Josis also. The Bhaktapur Josis believe that they were originally Brahmins and that this is the reason why they can initiate their own lineage members. Even so, in both cases Brahmins perform ritual functions for them that they cannot do alone. The most revealing of these from this point of view is the necessary presence of Brahmins at certain crucial junctures in the thirteen days required for the death rites (antye�ti). Although I have not as yet examined the liturgies in question, I have been reliably informed by a Rajopadhyaya of Bhaktapur that on one of these occasions, if the deceased Karmacarya was an initiate, a rite is performed aimed at returning the mantra to the deity and the guru from whom it was received. Even though the deceased Karmacarya received initiation from a senior family member, on this crucial occasion it is a Brahmin who acts as the guru, thus revealing the identity of the original point of entry of the Karmacarya's lineage to its ritual status. Smiirta Hinduism, at least that part of it concerned with the rites of passage distinguishes, in some respects, very clearly between the priest, who can perform rituals, and the layman who cannot perform them himself and so must employ a priest for this purpose. But even in that case a great deal of ritual activity in a smiirta rite is undertaken by the priest's patron (yajamiina), although he does so as directed by the priest, not independently. He can do this because he is empowered by an initiatory purification at the beginning of the rite, analogous to the Vedic initiation (df�ii) which formed a part of the preliminaries of each sacrifice (yajfia). By thus bestowing on his patron (yajamiina) the right to share in his priestly functions, the Brahmin attempted to free himself of the danger of taking his patron's impurites onto himself. Summarizing Heesterman's view on the classical Vedic sacrifice, Quigley (1993: 59) explains:"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"8 THE CULT OF THE GoDDESS KUB.JIKA In the classical ritual, the patron (yajamiina) has already been purified. Acutely aware of the dangers inherent in accepting a patron's gifts and thereby his impurity, the 'brahmin' has made his sacrificial services 'superfluous' (Heesterman 1985: p. 39). Or, put another way, the patron has become his own priest with the result that death and impurity no longer circulate between the parties. But while Newar Brahmins are aware that ritual action may defile their classical Brahminical identity, their ranking of status13 is only partially based on considerations of relative purity. This is because, in the context of Tantric ritual, · these considerations are temporarily �uspended, to be replaced by the ordinances of a different ritual universe.14 The corollary to this is that, in the context of Tantric ritual, the contact with sources of defilement (including his patron's impurities) no longer serves to depress in the same degree the status of a Brahmin or anyone who functions as a priest. Thus, even more so than in the non-Tantric context, the empowerment transmitted to the initiate from the deity through the guru and the rite of initiation enables him to begin his life as an independent ritual agent. He is, as far as the Tantric ritual to which he has gained access is concerned, his own priest and can act as a priest, for the members of his lineage at least. Thus Tantrism further blurs the distinction between priest and layman. The Tantric initiate is not like the baptised Catholic Christian layman, a passive and, at best, receptive, spectator of ritual action in which his function is hardly more than consent. Like priests of most religions, great and small, throughout the world he \"has a special and sometimes secret knowledge of the techniques of worship including incantations, prayers, sacrificial 13 Quigley pertinently points out that there is a gulf between the theory that Brahmins stand supreme in the caste hierarchy and practice where their status is, for various reasons, subordinated to that of their patrons. Quigley refers to this theory as a \"colonial interpretation of caste\" (Quigley 1993: 84) with which modem scholars often concur. But \"why,\" he asks, \"should they claim that the Briihma.Q stands supreme when, time after time, his status is shown to be intensely ambivalent, at worst vilely degrading?\" (ibid.) Quigley writes that the main reason for the \"near unanimous defence of the Brahma.Q's supremacy lies in the fact that authorities on Hinduism have, more often than not, illigitimately fused two very different concepts -jiiti and var�Ja -or caste (Brahma.Q) and [priestly] function (briihmar:z). Here they have indeed made the same mistake as colonial administrators.\" We should not forget, however, that the foremost of these authorities are the Brahmins themselves! Moreover, it is not only scholars and colonials who have been misled by these authorities but virtually all Hindus, even though many will agree that Brahmins can be, and very often are, degraded by impurity. The contrast between Brahminical theory and actual practice is the basis of the energizing tension and dynamism that characterises every Hindu society. 14 This procedure is well exemplified by the formulations of Srlvidya initiates in Bhaskararaya's tradition in Benares. Brahmins may drink the ritual offerings of wine without defilement because, according to them, as caste considerations are suspended for the duration of the rite, they are not, at that time, Brahmins."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"MARKS.

Even so, Newar Kaula initiates cannot perform rituals for others outside their lineage unless they are Brahmins /or (generally Kshatriya) Karmacaryas. The only other limitation on the common initiate's ritual activity is purely practical. He may not have the time or the knowledge to do more than perform the relatively short and simple daily obligatory rite (nityapujii). For other rituals he may therefore call the Karmacarya or Brahmin who is traditionally related to his lineage. In case there are no initiates left in the lineage or they are old, disabled or have moved to distant places (and these contingencies have nowadays become common) even the daily obligatory rite may be performed by a Karmacarya. Thus initiates can be ranged along a graded hierarchy on the basis of the degree of independence they enjoy as ritual agents. At the top stands the Taleju Rajopadhyaya, who still acts as the Malia king's purohita and guru even though the Gorkhali Shahs are ruling since 1769. He officiates at the innermost esoteric centre of the network of Hindu Newar esoterism - the Malia king's Tantric shrine where Taleju, his lineage goddess, is worshipped, as the liturgies say, for the benefit of the king, his country and his people. Ideally - and in the past this was probably the case - the Taleju Brahmin is accepted by everybody as the sole head and foundation of the entire system. He is the ultimate guru of all the gurus. In a sense, he is not only the ultimate but the sole ritual agent. All initiates are his assistants. They act in his place through the extension of his empowering authority, transmitted to them through the initiation he administers. From this uncompromisingly autocratic point of view, all those who serve clients (yajamiina) with their priestly functions have been appointed to this task by the Rajopadhyaya. Their clients are really the clients of the Rajopadhyaya who has delegated this job to them. The Taleju Rajopadhyaya insists that he can do 'everything' and 'go everywhere'. Theoretically he has access to every secret place and can perform any ritual. In actual fact, however, at present at least, he cannot. There are numerous public temples - for example, the temple of Guhyesvarl near Pasupati - where the sole officiants are Karmacaryas. Moreover, even if there are many Rajopadhyaya Brahmins who have their own traditional clients, even the 15 James 1974: 1007 quoted by Levy 1992: 346. Again, the Tantric situation reflects the earlier Vedic one in which power and authority were subject to dispersal depending on the outcome of the sacrificial contest."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"10 THE CULT OF THE GoDDESS KUBJIKA seniormost Rajopadhyaya cannot enter a fa mily's Tantric shrine (agaii) if he is not specifically authorized to do so.

This is because although he can perform every ritual action, including animal sacrifice and the consumption of liquor (ali, sudha), he may choose not to do these things.16 Moreover, there are rituals or parts of rituals that only he can perform. And so he must attend to them. Amongst them are the rituals that are considered to be the most dangerous and powerful. These are the most 'internal'. They are the rites of Taleju who is worshipped in conjunction with her innermost energizing counterpart, the goddess Kubjika, the lineage goddess of the Taleju Rajopadhyayas and, in all probability, of all the other Rajopadhyayas, Karmacaryas and Josis. Of course, matters do not seem to be this way to others. As a result of what the Rajopadhyaya may call a mass rebellion, most of these other priests consider themselves to be autonomous agents. It is possible to meet a Karmacarya who bows his head respectfully as he says in a hushed voice that he is nothing but the servant of the Rajopadhyaya, but most are fa r from this fealtyY In Bhaktapur, the Karmacaryas who serve the upper castes (thar) affirm that they lived in Bhaktapur prior to the arrival of the Rajopadhyayas, which took place only hardly nine or ten generations 16 That this is the case is clearly proved by the fact that there are rituals that only Rajopadhyayas can perform alone. The prime examples being those that require animal sacrifice that they must, therefore, do themselves even though they invariably prefer to have the actual killing done by an assistant whenever possible. 17 I am thinking in particular of an interview with a Karmacarya who, after performing the functions of the Karmacarya in the Taleju temple in Patan for many years, resigned. When asked if this was because of some quarrel with the Rajopadhyaya priests, he was surprised. \"Why should we quarrel,\" he said, \"they are our gurus and we are their assistants!\" The reason he left was quite another. The government trust that finances the Taleju and other temples in the Valley gave him only one Nepalese rupee a day as remuneration. At present this is barely the price of a cup of tea. The tone and mood of this Karmacarya was in sharp contrast with that of the main Vidyapitha Karmacarya who performs the equivalent rituals in the Bhaktapur Taleju temple. He is a senior science lecturer in Tribhuvan University and has several well-to-do patrons. Moreover, the situation in the Bhaktapur temple, although not good, is considerably better than in Patan, and so those who act as priests there are better rewarded. The Bhaktapur Karmacarya, who is in a much better financial position and, as a university lecturer, enjoys a better social status, combined with a self­assertive character, represents the kind of Karmacarya who is convinced of his own importance and resents the inferior status to which he is relegated by Rajopadhyayas. He does not talk about his caste status. He prefers to talk about his competence as a ritual agent. He goes so far as to boast that he can perform the smiirta life cycle rituals himself - which he is certainly not authorized to do. Clearly, competence to perform ritual is amongst the Newars a finely graded measure of status, no less than considerations of relative purity, which is the most basic measure of status in traditional Hindu societies."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"MARKS. G. DYCZKOWSKI 11 ago, and that they were displaced by them from their original high status.18 They point to the Tantric shrines (iigafi) where they, not Brahmins, perform rituals on behalf of the lineage members. Amongst them, they say, are the oldest ones. They are the gurus there, they say, because the Brahmins have not been able to displace them. These disputes are clearly extensions of those that take place wherever society is ordered into castes, a social order that has been aptly characterised as a \"contested hierarchy\". In this case, the gradation of ritual empowerment is the defining characteristic of status. Accordingly, it is this that is the object of contention. The status associated with Tantric ritual empowerment is reflected in the distribution of priestly functions amongst the members of Newar family lineages. Thus, although every initiate is empowered to perform all the rituals associated with his own lineage diety, in practice, the seniormost member of the lineage - the thakiili (also called niiyo) and, to a lesser degree, his wife - the nakin - have special privileges and obligations along with other elders. 19 18 The Bhaktapur Karmacaryas accept the historicity of the story of Ullasa and Allasa Raj. These were two Brahmin brothers who came to the Valley from Kanauj. Allasa Raj went to the hills where, it is said, his descendants became the hill (piirvatlya) Brahmins. UIHisa Raj came to Bhaktapur and his descendants are said to be the present Rajopadhyaya Brahmins of Bhaktapur (Levy 1992: 346ff.). Another version says that the two brothers pleased the king by their Vedic recitation and were asked to stay. One remained in Bhaktapur, and the other in Kathmandu. There are several other legends (for which see Toffin 1995: 188). Genealogies have been recovered that begin with Ullasa Raj (see Witzel 1976). Toffin writes: According to this document, this KanaujTya priest arrived in the Nepal Valley in the middle of the sixteenth century and died in 1576. He is supposedly the earliest 'Nepalese' ancestor of the family. However, these dates have to be treated with caution because other interpretations of the genealogies are possible: the original ancestor could have migrated to Nepal in the fourteenth century, at roughly the same time as Taleju was brought to Bhaktapur, or at the end of the fifteen century during the reign of Raya Malia (1482-1 505 AD). (Toffin 1995: 188) The legends vary atso for different cities, since 'Rajopadhyaya' was not originally a proper name but a title meaning the 'king's teacher', and it appears that several Brahmin families came at different times and settled in various places in the Valley. Toffin remarks: Nor does it seem that the present day Rajopadhyayas are all descended from a single ancestor as legend claims. Rather it appears that the first arrivals, no more than several families, continued to receive reinforcements until quite a late date (at least until the sixteenth or seventeenth century). The present Rajopadhyaya caste is thus more likely to have been a product of the amalgamation of successive waves of migrants than of the fission and separation of the descendants of a single ancestor (ibid. 191 ). 19 This is generally true for all Newars, whether Hindu or Buddhist. Thus, the lineages of Buddhist farmer castes (jyiipu, maharjan) in Patan and Kathmandu have a group of five elders who lead their community (Gellner and Quigley1995: 181 fn. 4)."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"12 THE CULT OF THE GODDESS KUBJIKA Significantly, the thakiili and his wife must be present fo r at least the preliminary stages of the rites of Tantric initiation of members of their lineage. Traditionally it is the thakiili who performs the worship of the lineage deity in its aniconic form as a stone (see below). He must be present and often performs priestly fu nctions in the major life cycle rites. In this he may complement the ritual activity of the fa mily purohita. The purohita who, as we have said, must be a Brahmin, performs the Sanskrit rites. The thakali may at times perform additional non­Sanskritic rites. A striking example of this is. the kaytapuja. Amongst the upper castes this is done in conjunction with the smiirta rite of passage in which a sacred thread is given to a young man as a sign of his entry into adulthood (upanayana). This part of the rite is basically the same as the one performed in India, while the other part of the rite is important enough to give its name to the whole ritual. Essentially, this consists of the donation of a loincloth -kayta - to the young man as a token of his transformed status and fu ll admission into his lineage as an adult. This is done not by the Brahmin, but by the thakiili.20 Low castes (but not the lowest)\"who are not entitled to the smarta rite of passage retain the rites associated with the offering of the kayta. I believe that these are examples of many remnants of Newar religious customs that pre-existed the · introduction of religion from India. Numerous anthropologists and histmians have noted in a large number of contexts a hard core of beliefs and ritual practice, both individual and collective, that cannot be reduced to those of scriptural Hinduism or Buddhism. This should not suq>rise us. Indeed, we perceive the existence of analogous cores throughout the Indian subcontinent and wherever these religions have spread. It is this core which gives these religions and the traditional, essentially religious societies to whose development they contribute, their particular regional and local character. Certainly there are major problems involved in identifying the exact content of this core in Newar religion and social life fo r the simple reason that Indian religions and social institutions have influenced the Newars fo r many centuries. Moreover, the subject is so extensive and controversial that it would require separate treatment. Even so, a few fe atures of this core system of beliefs that are relevant to our topic need to be provisionally and succinctly tackled here, if we are to understand the specific character of Newar religion and, more specifically, the Tantrism of the higher castes which centres on the worship of the goddesses who are the subject of this essay. To do this let us begin by returning to the figure of the thakali. There are numerous circumstances in which the thakiili fu nctions as the priest of the lineage of 20 Gellner reports that amongst the Buddhist farmer castes (maharjan): \"once a Maharjan has been through the ritual of consecration of an elder (thiikuli [= thakiili] layegu) in some circles he is considered able to act as a priest for such occasions as kaytii pii.jii (loincloth worship), thus making it unnecessary to invite the Vajra.carya, domestic priest\" (Gellner and Quigley1995: 181 fn . 4)."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"MARKS. G. 0YCZKOWSKI 13 which he is the head. Amongst the lower castes he often operates in this capacity independently. In the case of the higher castes, his role as the lineage priest is eclipsed by the Sanskritic lineage priests, the guru, purohita and Karmacarya. Nonetheless the preemenent seniority he enjoys in his lineage is concretely apparent in his priestly functions. Particularly important from the point of view of this study is his role as the chief priest in the worship of a stone as the lineage deity, because Newar Sak.tism is also centred on the worship of lineage (kula) deities. The worship of these stones and, indeed the worship of stones as deities in general, is a characteristic feature of Newar religion, both Buddhist and Hindu. When the founder of a lineage enters to settle in an inhabited space, he places a stone at its confines thus delineating the territory in which he and his descendants reside.21 This stone, often together with others in a small group, is venerated at least once a year by his descendants as their lineage deity -digu dy a/:l. On the basis of the results of the surveys carried out so far, it transpires that the main deity worshipped in the stone by the lower castes, that is, those not entitled to receive Kaula initition is male. Amongst the fa rmer (jyapu) lineages in Bhaktapur we find, amongst others, Mahadeva and Narayal).a. The potters worship Gal).esa; stone-and metal-workers (Silpakar) , Visvakarman; and the copper- and bronze-workers (tamrakar), Mahadeva. The stones are usually kept in a specific place to which lineage members go every year. The stones may be moved, or others selected elsewhere into which the deity is invoked.22 In the course of the lengthy rite of adoration the present and, if the stone 21 Vergati writes: What seemed to me specific to the Newars both Buddhists and Hindus was the relation between the lineage deity and a particular territory. The divinity was situated obligatorily in the same area as that in which the ancestors and senior members of the lineage resided. Even if people are unable to explain in detail their genealogies they always know where their lineage deity is situated. (Vergati 1995: 18) 22 A notable example of this in Bhaktapur was the shifting of the digu stone of the Taleju Rajopadhyayas. The stone was kept in a small sacred grove called Sillighari, just outside Bhaktapur, where numerous lineage stones are kept. Although the worship of digu stones is not usually done in secret, the Rajopadhyayas do not wish to be observed when they perform these, or indeed, any rites. Accordingly, they built a wall around the area where the stone was located. But the bricks were repeatedly removed from the wall, making it hard for them to keep their rites secret. Thus they decided that they should move their stone. Accordingly, some forty years ago, all adult male Rajopadhyayas of that lineage met around the stone. A ritual drawing of lots took place in order to ask the deity in the stone for its consent to move it. When the elders had decided on the basis of the outcome that this consent had been given, a new stone and companions were installed in the new location. And so now the new stone is located in a garden of the royal palace where the digu of the Malia kings is kept (see below). The potential mobility of the deities in such stones is well illustrated by the unusual case of the digu deity of the Tamrakars, the copper-and bronze-workers, of Bhaktapur. Although they always perform the rites of their digu deity at Hanuman Gha�, they do not have the usual set of"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"14 THE CULT OF THE GODDESS KUBJIKA has been shifted, previous locations of the stone are mentioned and the year of its removal. Thus it is possible to find people who know of the stone's location even several hundreds of years back. It is also possible to share the same stone with others. This is what happens in the Piill)acaQc;li temple in Patan. This and one other temple, also located in Patan,23 a_l ong with three others in Bhaktapur4 are the only open public temples to the goddess Siddhilak�mi in the Valley. Here she is represented by a large stone. Although the goddess of this temple is commonly known as Piill)aCaQQI, there can be no doubt the deity in the shrine is Siddhilak�mi, because the tympanum bears an image of this goddess. Moreover, there is a lengthy hymn dedicated to this goddess inscribed on a slab cemented onto one of the walls. The temple was built by the Rajopadhyayas of the locality (Vala). The stone in the temple serves as the digudyii/:z of a large number of families living in Patan, including all the lineages of Rajopadhyayas in Patan.Z5 The story concerning the founding of this temple is still transmitted in the Valanima lineage of Rajopadhyayas, who are relatives of the present Taleju priests.Z6 fixed digu stones. They must go to the river to collect fresh stones every time they worship their digu. They do this at random by simply closing their eyes and taking the first stones of an appropriate size they happen to touch. Eight stones are selected in this way. Seven of them represent guardians (k�etrapiila), and the remaining one, the digu. 23 The other temple is associated with the Kirantis of eastern Nepal, a people who are perhaps descendants of the Kiratas who appear in many Newar legends as the earliest known rulers of the Kathmandu Valley. Slusser informs us that \"there are two sites in Patan where the Kiranti maintain traditional ties. One of these, the Siddhilakl?mi temple near Tyagal-tol, attracts certain Kiranti families for the annual worship of their clan god, the Kuladevatii (degu, deviill)\" (Slusser 1982: 96). Although the local people do refer to the temple as one of Siddhilakl?mi, the icon is not at all that of this goddess. Moreover, no inscription found on or near the temple refers to the deity in it as being this goddess. 24 The oldest temple in Bhaktapur dedicated to Siddhilakl?mi was built by Jagatprakasamalla, who ruled between 1645 and 1672 A.D. This is located next to the Malia palace. His son, Jitamitra­malla, who ruled from 1673 to 1696 A.D., built another one next the one his father had built. The third was built by Bhiipatlndramalla (1696-1722 A.D.) in Ta:marhi square. See pis. 2 and 3. 25 Up to recent times, there were six lineages of Rajopadhyayas in Patan, collectively called the Six Families (�a{kula). They are all connected with Piiri:�aCai:�<;ll. The six families are: 1) Balima, Patukva and Gabahal. These three belong to one family. They are descendants of three brothers who took up residence in these three places in Patan. 2) Sulima. 3) Vala, also called Valanima. 4) Svatha. Their Tantric shrine (iigaii) is in the Mucherh quarter of Patan. 5) Tal;lrarhlivi. 6) NugaQ. This lineage came to an end three or four generations ago. 26 I was told this story by Nutan Sarma, a Vala Rajopadhyaya, who heard it from his grandmother who belongs to the Valanima lineage of Rajopadhyayas."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"MARKS. G. DYCZKOWSKI 15 The hero of this story is Visvanatha, the son of Gayal)bajya (see above fn. 6). He was the purohita and Tantric preceptor of King Siddhinarasirilhamalla, who ruled Patan from 1597 to 1619. Visvanatha, the story goes, found the goddess in the form of a stone in the Nakhu River, which in those days flowed next to the present location of the temple. The nearby pond is said to be a remnant of this river. Visvanatha and a certain Piill)ananda Svami, who is said to have come from Bengal, erected this temple with the help of the Malia king and other patrons. All the Rajopadhyayas of Patan go to this temple and perform digupujii in conjunction with their smiirta rites of passage, especially when their sons are given the sacred thread (vratabandha) and when they marry. They do not worship their digu otherwise. Large numbers of people, including many from Kathmandu whose ancestors lived in Patan, come to this temple during the season in which the digu is worshipped to perform the rites, using the stone in the temple as a substitute for their own digu stones. Research has revealed that as many as half the upper caste families of Patan worship their digu here.27 The number of people who make use of this stone in this way is so large that during the digupujii season they often have to wait a long time before their turn comes, and when it does they only have time to perform a brief digupujii . The animals that are customarily sacrificed may be cooked and eaten in one of the two rest houses located in the vicinity specially for this purpose. This appears to be a unique case. There are many examples of temples containing stones that serve as a substitute for digu stones. But normally in such cases the original digu stones are located elsewhere. This alternative is available to those families who have moved far fr om their original homes where their digu is located and find it hard for them to go there to worship it. Piill)aCaQ.<;II I Siddhilak�mi plays a similar role, with the important difference that, in the form of a stone, this goddess functions as the digu directly for those fa milies who have no other stone. There is an old inscription on the temple wall that establishes that the temple was indeed constructed during the reign of Siddhinarasirilhamalla. This means that this unique custom cannot predate the middle of the seventeenth century, unless there were other such stones, or indeed this one itself was being used for this purpose. If the legend concerning the fi nding of the stone in the Nakhu River is true, then the latter hypothesis can be discarded. The reason why all this is possible is because the digu stone is just a temporary dwelling place of the lineage deity. Thus an essential preliminary to digupujii is the invocation of the presence of the lineage deity into the stone. This can be done even when the stone is already 'occupied' by another deity. Indeed, Newars frequently invoke the presence of deities in various objects, including ritual diagrams, jars, and 2i ,.; Niitan ;:,anna has made a survey of more than 6,500 houses in Patan as a part of his doctoral research.

Deities may even be invoked into icons of other deities.29 Despite much controversy concerning this matter, after study of the rituals involved30 and penetrating enquiry, there can be no doubt that the higher castes invoke their lineage goddess into the digu stone.31 One or more representations of this goddess (yantra and I or icon) are 28 When powerful, secret deities need to be taken out in procession during festivals, bundles are carried around the processional route. The general public is led to believe that they contain the 'original' form of the deity. At times there are two such mysterious bundles, thus adding fu rther to the confusion and speculation. Even seasoned western researchers have been caught up in such 'intrigues'. Refering to the famous New Year's festival - Bisket Yatra -in Bhaktapur, Vergati tells us that: \"crushed in a large crowd I could watch what was happening in the Main Chowk [of the royal palace where Taleju's shrine is located] at the time of Bisket }titrii but I was never able to see the box which reputedly contains the yantra of the goddess Taleju.\" (Vergati 1995: 9) But even if Vergati had been able to see the box or even its contents, she would not have seen the deity because in actual fact, in this case as in many other such instances, the deity is not in what is being carried but within the person who carries it. Prior to his emergence in the public space the bearer has mentally extracted the deity or a part of it from its hidden location and projected it into his heart where it is safe and well hidden. 29 This is why Siddhilak�mT or Pun:�acar:u;li may not be the identity of the lineage deity of the families who worship their digu in the temple of Plirt:�acat:�<;IT referred to previously. It is common practice amongst Newars, especially if they wish the identity of the deity they are worshipping to be kept secret, to project the deity they are worshipping onto another one. In this way, it appears to the onlooker that a certain deity is being worshipped whereas, in fact, that deity simply serves as the vehicle of the deity that is really being worshipped. 30 It may appear at first sight that there are no- written liturgies for digupujii or the rites performed at large fe stivals. But this is not the case for the higher castes at least. Thus the NGMPP has microfilmed a manuscript of the liturgy prescribed for the worship of the digu of the Malia kings, Dvirhmaju. The text is simply called Dvimmajupuja and is NGMPP reel no. B 70317. In order to find the written liturgies for the secret rites performed in public festivals, one must first know the deities that are worshipped on these occasions and the rites performed at that time. During Bisket Yatra, for example, the rite performed in secret in the Malia palace in Bhaktapur is centred on the ceremonial raising of a banner in honour of the goddess Siddhilak�mi. Several manuscripts of this liturgy have been microfimed by the NGMPP. One is the siddhilak�m!kotyiihutidhvajiiroha!J.avar�avardhanavidhi�z, NGMPP reel no.

The head of the lineage (or the ritual specialist) invites the deity to take its place in the stones. An animal victim is then slaughtered .... \" (Vergati 1995: 55ff. ) A little fu rther on she describes this procedure in greater detail: \"Those who participate in the pujii stand facing the stones. The officiant is in front of them, also facing the stones. All are bare-headed, with hands joined at chest level, fingers pointing to the ground.

DYCZKOWSKI 17 normally kept in a Tantric shrine, either a separate building (iiganchem) or, more commonly, a room in the house (iigamkuthi) set aside fo r this purpose. The main officiant for this rite is the lineage elder - the thakiili. If he is not initiated or unable, the rite may be performed by another senior member of the lineage. But if none have been initiated, it must necessarily be done by the lineage priest, who may be a Brahmin or, more commonly for such rituals, a Karmacarya. As I have noted already, the lower castes who are not allowed to take Tantric initiation worship non-Tantric deities (and in some cases Bhairava) in the digu stone. The rites may also be done by a Karmacarya or a Brahmin fo r them, but it is much more usual fo r them to do it fo r themselves. Even though they do not take initiation from a Brahmin, they also maintain a room or shrine where an image of the deity is kept. But in many cases the identity of the deity is not kept as scrupulously secret as it would be by the higher castes. I believe that all these facts make sense if we postulate the existence of an original cutural substratum or substrata which predate the introduction of Buddhism and Hinduism. I believe the form of this core culture may be discerned, to some degree at least, by examining the practices and beliefs that cannot be traced to the Sanskrit texts, Buddhist or Hindu, those, that is, that are not Indian. This does not, of course exclude other possible influences, but these appear to be minor compared to those from India. The society; culture and religion of the farmer castes (jyiipu, maharjan) appears in many respects to coincide most with this ancient core, although it has undergone a steady process of Sanskritization for many centuries. As Gellner writes : It is remarkable that although nearly all other Newar caste sub-groups have a myth which traces their origin to somewhere else, usually India, the Mahatjans have no such myth. Even at the level of the sub-caste within one city there appear to be no such myths. As distinct from this, specific lineages do of course often have traditions which record their migration from some other place within the Valley. Thus, not claiming to come from outside, the Mahatjans have been seen to be the true locals. This has led some observers to see them as descendents of the original inhabitants of the Valley and to look fo r ancient survivals in their culture and social practices. (Gellner 1995: 160) This older religion appears to have been strongly centred on ancestor worship that was based on the belief that people, both men and women, acquire the status of deity as they grow old. Accordingly, Newars still undergo three succesive rites of passage (called burii jamkwa) every ten years from the time they reach the age of 77 only a stone: afterwards, it is the seat of the divinity throughout the duration of the ceremony\" (ibid. 57)."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"18 THE CULT OF THE GoDDESS KUBJIKA years 7 months 7 days 7 ghatzs (about 2 hours) and 7 palas (about 2 minutes). After this ritual a person \"leaves the world of men fo r that of the gods\" (Vergati 1995: 12). If he lives to undergo the third ritual passage he is belived to be fu lly deified. Thus the very· first member of the clan was the most senior, the most divine. I believe, although no immediately apparent trace of this belief survives, that he was the original deity whose presence was invoked in the digu stone.32 Whether this is true or not there can be no doubt that from the start this religion was domestic. The domestic unit was not the family, not even the extended joint family, as in India, but the phuki -the group of closely related patrilineal fa milies. I suggest that the priests of the phukis were the most aged ·members. They performed the rites of passage fo r the phuki members and the worship of the phuki's deities. Another important surviving feature of this religion is the worship of protectors. They are the original fo rms of the Gal}esas who protect each locality, the Bhairavas who protect whole towns and villages or large areas of them, the Mothers who encircle human settlements, and others. Like the digu deities, they have iconic counterparts which are usually kept apart except on certain occasions when the two are brought together. In Newari the Bhairavas and the Mothers can be generically referred to as Aju (lit. 'grandfather') and Ajima (lit. 'grandmother'), implying, it seems, that some of them, at least, were believed to have originally been deified human beings. Thus, according to Newar legend, some of the Bhairavas were originally kings who, as deities, continue the royal fu nction they perform as human beings of protecting their people. 33 32 l say this fully conscious of how controversial this view is. Thus Ishii writing about the Newar village of Satungal says: \"Although the digu dya/:1 is the deity of the lineage there is not the slightest suggestion of what one finds in other cultures, that the lineage god is a deified ancestor. Neither the legends about the early settlers of Satungal nor the sriiddha ceremony is related to this deity. Moreover, in some cases, the same digu dya/:1 is worshipped by many groups not patrilineally related, though all patrilineally related people worship the same digu dya/:1 \" (Ishii 1995: 146). In reply one could say that sriiddha rites belong to a separate ritual dimension. And we have seen that the same stone may be the abode of different lineage deities for different people. It is possible that the ancestral origin of the digu dya/:1 and of the other ancient deities of the early inhabitants of the Kathmandu Valley has been forgotten. 33 Anderson (1975: 156) writes that: \"The estimated five million Bhairab images in Nepal are seen in sixty-four different manifestations and forms depicting his combined human, demonic and animal characteristics.\" These sixty-four manifestations are the male counterparts of the sixty-four yogirus. This purely Tantric representation also depicts both the Bhairavas and their consorts as divinized human beings, that is, perfect Tantric adepts (siddha) and the female .adepts with which they unite. Here, as in many other instances, the representations of the Sanskrit scriptures coincide in principle with popular local beliefs. The human origin of one of the major Bhairavas in Kathmandu illustrates this thesis. He is represented by five small stones in an open temple site near the Bagmati river between Tripuresvara and Kaiimati, just south of old Kathmandu. The Newars, Anderson informs us \"conforming with legends in which many Bhairabs are identified as various Nepalese kings, say Pachali is the name of one such sovereign who ruled from Farping village near"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"MARKS. G. DYCZKOWSKI 19 All these beings were, and still are, worshipped in stones. The Sanskritized name for such stones is, appropriately, pffha, which literally means 'seat'. While the digu stones (which are never referred to as pffhas) originally marked the location of the phuki and so are moveable and had human origin, the pffha stones are markers and delineators of place common to the community as a whole. They were not placed in their locations but discovered there. They protect larger or smaller areas, according to their status, function and location, all three of which are interrelated. Thus some mark and protect areas that together cover the whole Valley. Others protect villages, sectors of towns, the roads, crossroads, houses, and courtyards, even refuse dumps. Such stones are to be found everywhere, both in the countryside and - where they are particularly profuse - in human settlements. These stones are, indeed must be, worshipped by those who live close to them. Occasionally the inhabitants of a town or village decide that they should worship all the stones in which deities or other beings reside. When this took place in Patan in 1989 Gutschow counted 442 of them.34 An important clue to the manner in which this earlier religion, centred on the worship of such stones, is incorporated into the Sanskritic religions of India, both Hindu and Buddhist, is the ritual that takes place when the iconic counterparts of the stones are brought to them. This rite is essentially a form of installation (prii1J.aprati$fhii) of the deity into the stone and the icon (or its representation), fo llowed by worship. We witness here the symbiosis of the two religions. The stone Chobar Gorge\" (ibid. 158). Another myth represents Pacali Bhairava as belonging to the Jyapu farmer caste and his lover a Khasai (butcher) girl. Chalier-Visuvalingam has published a lengthy and very detailed article on the cult of Pacali Bhairava to which the reader is referred (see bibliography). 34 Gutschow writes: The irreversible character of urban space is closely linked to the idea that essentially the quality of 'place' reveals itself through aniconic representations of gods and goddesses, namely, GaQesa, Bhairava, and Durga. In Patan there are altogether 442 such representations, which are collectively called piga, as the specific connotation remains mostly vague. These piga are unhewn stones, which emerge out of the ground and reach eventually a height of one or two meters; or they are flat stones, integrated into the regular pavement of squares and streets. These stones have first been discovered or 'found' by ritual specialists through Tantric power and in many cases the legends tied to this discovery have survived and form the base for a ritual reenactment of that detection of the sacred. (Gutschow 1995: 112ff) One may hazard the suggestion that these discoveries are more often than not colonizations of the earlier, autochthonous, deities in the stones by their Tantric counterparts brought about by these Tantric ritual specialists. Thus what Gutschow explains is the \"aniconic infrastructure of the town\" that represents \"the power of the place which enables peopJe to live there\" (ibid.) has become a network of Tantric energies wielded by the protectors of place."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"20 THE CULT OF THE GoDDESS KUBJIKA draws its life force (prar:ta) from the icon and the icon from the stone. The two must therefore, at some time at least, be worshipped together. This may take place just once a year or more often, according to custom. In the case of the royal goddess Taleju, the stone which is the digu of the Malia kings (called Dvirhmaju) must always be worshipped along with its equivalent iconic fo rm and vice versa even in the course of the daily rites (nityapuja). These rituals always involve the invocation of the deity (avahana), which can be considered, in some respects, to be a reduced fo rm of the fully developed rite of installation. We observe in this way how the Sanskrit mantras, and especially the powerful Tantric mantras, used in such rites Sanskritize the earlier aniconic fo rms and how these latter are reaffirmed in their fu nction of contributing their energy to the empowerment of the deities from which these mantras originate. Thus the ancient guardians of the Newars become the attendants of the Tantric goddesses of the higher castes, empowering them even as they are empowered by them to perform their fu nctions as protectors of place and lineage. The sources of the history of the development of these fo rms of Tantrism amongst the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley include the common sources of any aspect of Nepalese history, namely, inscriptions, chronicles, the records of land grants, business transactions, corporate trusts (guthis) and the colophons of manuscripts containing dates or dateable references. But particularly important, and as yet virtually untouched, are the immense number of liturgical works· (paddhati, pujavidhi) the Newars have written to regulate, in part at least, their very many and often extremely extensive, esoteric ritual procedures. Indeed, along with ethnological and historical studies, a study of these texts, together with the Tantras that are their primary literary sources, is essential in order to understand the specific form Newar Saktism has assumed over the past thousand years since its introduction into the Valley from India. These Hindu texts (I am not concerned with Newar Buddhism) can be broadly classified, in terms of this enquiry, into three basic types: 1) Those liturgies that are constructed entirely from materials drawn from Tantric sources, that is, from texts written in Sanskrit called Tantras or synonyms of that term. 2) Those liturgies which contain, usually in very moderate degrees, passages drawn from the Vedas which, Newar Brahmins insist, can only be recited by them. These are important but relatively few. 3) Those liturgies that contain in varying degrees material drawn from other sources that are not in written fo rm. These include an immense range of ritual activity that appears to be derived from local custom. It is worth noting that very little of this activity is, in the form it is at present, intrinsically articulate. When something is said, the speaker makes use of a language which is not local, namely, Sanskrit, even if it is"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"MARKS. G. DYCZKOWSKI 21 usually quite corrupt and, not uncommonly, mixed with Newari. In order to avoid the controversial term 'tribal', one could call these sources·, simply, non-Sanskritic. For the sake of clarity, it is worth stressing that there is also a great deal of ritual activity that takes place 'without a book', as the Newars put it. This may also be to varying degrees Sanskritic in the sense that it is both guided by the religious notions and pantheon common to Hindus throughout South Asia and/or related to forms of the sacred that are local and, therefore, non-Sanskritic. Although such non­literate ritual activity is important and, statistically, constitutes a considerable amount of the ritual activity Newars engage in, that done 'with a book' is considered to be the most powerful, however great the non-Sanskritic elements it may contain. If we examine these liturgies referring to the simple three-fold classification outlined above, we notice that the basic structure, even of those of the third type, is the one which is most coherently and systematically elaborated in the first type, to which belong liturgies constructed entirely from materials drawn from Tantric sources. In this tangible and direct manner Tantrism serves as a vehicl\"e of Sanskritization at the very core of Newar culture, radically rooted as it is in religi�n that is to a very large degree ritualistic. In this and other ways, notably its art, Tantrism is a ubiquitous part of Newar culture. For high-caste Newars, and to proportionately varying degrees as one descends the hierarchy of the Newar caste system, insofar as the degree of access to these rites is a measure of caste status, esoteric Tantric rites combine with domestic rituals including, as we have seen, the smiirta rites of passage and the worship of lineage deities (digu dya]J.). They also fo rm an invariable part of civic fe stivals. In both cases they perform the essential fu nction of energizing them from 'within' to render them effective. This esoteric Sanskritic dimension of Newar religious culture is most developed amongst the higher castes because only -they are allowed to take the initiation which authorize them to perform and attend the purely Tantric rituals in their most complete fo rm belonging to the first group. The upper sections of the lower castes have access to such rituals, although these are centred on deities who serve as attendants of the esoteric deities of the higher castes.35 Moreover, as one goes down the caste hierarchy, rituals tend to contain, as one would expect, greater proportions of non­Sanskritic elements. Although not prominent in the esoteric Tantric rituals of the higher castes, they do make their appearance in some of the more elaborate occasional Tantric rites of even Newar Brahmins. Another distinguishing fe ature of the esoteric religion of the higher castes in relation to the more exoteric religion of the lower is that the fo rmer is centred on the worship of goddesses, while the equivalent religion of the lower castes concentrates 35 These attendants - for the most part one or other of the Eight Mothers who surround and protect Newar settlements - are identified by initiates with the great lineage goddesses, especially Kubjika, because they are emanated from them."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"22 THE CULT OF THE GODDESS KUBJIKA more on their male equivalents. I must stress that I am contrasting the esoteric religion of the high castes to which access can only be had through initiation with that of the lower castes who are generally (see above p. 5) not entitled to take such initiations. But rather than examine the development of Newar Tantrism that has taken place at the hands of the Newars themselves as reflected by these liturgical works, I wish instead to explore some of the salient features and developments of the specifically Tantric traditions that are their original and most authoritative Sanskrit sources. In order to do this I will fo cus primarily on the Tantras and related material pertaining to the early period of the development of Kaula Tantrism, that is, prior to the thirteenth century of the current era.36 This is because, although the Newars continued to absorb fo rms of Tantrism from North India throughout the period of the development of Hindu, especially Sakta, Tantrism in that region, the Tantric traditions of the early period centred on the goddesses Kubjika, Kali and Tripura have remained by far the most dominant sources fo r them. 37 Amongst these three goddesses two are especially important. One is Kubjika because she appears, from the field work done so far, to be the goddess of most, if not all, of the higher-caste priests of the Hindu Newars. This is certainly true in Bhaktapur. It is probably fo r this reason, and insofar as it is the priests who have 36 It is possible to distinguish twp great periods of development of Hindu Tantric traditions. The dividing line between them are the works of the monistic Kashmiri Saiva exegetes beginning with Vasugupta (ninth century) and ending with Jayaratha (thirteenth century). For uncertain reasons, of which I believe the major one to be the disruption brought about by the progressive Muslim conquest of North India, there was a sudden catastrophic break in most of the lineages of the major Tantric traditions in northern India in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. Most of the Tantric traditions that survived this break were those found in South India at that time. One major exception of particular importance for this study is the Kubjika cult, which by this time was, it seems, well established amongst the Newars in the Kathmandu Valley and has continued to develop there since then. Another is the cult of Tripura. The new Tantrism that developed after this period in northern India was dominantly Sakta, that is, centred on goddess cults. A great deal of the contents of these cults were built up from the vague memories of the earlier ones that had been lost but which were generally more extensively and systematically developed than there successors. 37 The group of Ten Goddesses, the so-called Dasa Mahavidya, which became a very important configuration of divine forms in North India from about the 17th century onwards, are well known to the Newars. They even figure in the sacred geographies of Kathmandu, Patan and Bhaktapur. From what I have been able to gather from interviews, they are also to be found in some of the rooms or chapels (iigaii) of higher caste initiates where they worship their Tantric family goddesses (kuladevatii). Apart from the aniconic stones in which they reside (pftha) encircling Kathmandu and Patan, some of them have temples. One important temple is dedicated to the goddess Bagalamukhi. It is located in the temple complex of Kumbhesvara in Patan. Framed paintings of all ten of the Dasa Mahavidyas adorn the upper part of the outer walls."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"MARKS. G. DYCZKOWSKI 23 made the liturgies, that Kubjika functions in innumerable ways, which are still the objects of research, as the energizing centre of the Newar esoteric Sak:ta pantheon.38 The other goddess is Kali. Although goddesses have numerous forms, as do South Asian deities in general, some of Kali's forms have especially well-defined identities. Three of these figure prominently in Newar esoteric Sak:tism. These are Dak�iQ.akali, Guhyaka.II and Siddhilak�mi.39 Especially the last two are so well defined that even though they are both fo rms of Ka.II, they possess separate and extensive Tantras of their own from which the basics of their cults, that is·, their maQ.<,ialas and mantras, are drawn. These Tantras are the Guhyakiilftantra40 along 38 One striking example of the way this is done is found in most of the Newar liturgies of all these Kaula goddesses. The initial purification of the hands and body of the officiant that must precede all Tantric rituals is done by mentally projecting mantras onto the body. This transforms the body, speech, and mind of the officiant into that of a deity and so renders him fit to worship the deity. The mantra for this process (technically called nyiisa-lit. 'deposition') is invariable Kubjika's Thirty-Two-Syllable Vidya (the Newais call it 'battfst which literally means 'thirty-two-(syllabled) one'). The Kaula initiation which is most popular in Bhaktapur is called the Va$i${hadf/qiikanrwpaddhati (which is probably a misnomer for ViSi$(adf/qiikarmapaddhati). I was given a copy by a Bhairavacarya of Bhaktapur. The preparatory pha�es of the initiation which render the disciple fit to receive the mantra of his or her lineage goddess require that the teacher project the mantras of Kubjika onto the disciple's body. This is invariably the case regardless of the identity of the lineage goddess of the person receiving initiation. The basic identity of the initiate as a ritual agent is here clearly revealed to be Kubjika. I plan to deal extensively with this important and complex aspect of Newar Saktism in future publications. · 39 The correct Sanskrit name of this goddess is Siddhalak�mi, but she is known to the Newars as Siddhilak�mi. As these are her last and if not her only worshippers, certainly they are the most important ones left, I prefer the Newari form to which I am, anyway, habituated. 40 According to Divakar Acarya, whom I gratefully acknowledge for the information, there is a fo urteenth century palm leaf manuscript of this Tantra preserved in the Kaisar Library in Kathmandu. Another incomplete manuscript has been microfilmed by the NGMPP from a private collection. The root mantra of Guhyakali is taken from this Tantra. This is the form of the mantra used in the worship of Guhyakaii at night (nisiircana) that takes place at the conclusion of her procession (yiitrii) from the Taleju temple in Kathmandu to her main temple in the Pasupati area (see Micheals 1994 for details). The liturgy (the text of which is called Guhyesvarfnisiircm;zavidhi/:t NGMPP reel no. A 948/4) is centred on the Secret (guhya) Kali's secret identity, namely, Kubjika, or, to be more precise, Kubjika's Weapon. The form of the mantra itself confirms this identity by addressing the goddess as Guhyakubjika as fo llows: OM GUHYAKUBJIKE HOM PHAT MAMA SARVOPADRAVAYA YANTRAMANTRA­TANTRAC�APRAYOGADIKAM YENA �TAM KARAYITAM KARISYATI TAN SARV AN HANA HANA DAMSTRAKARALI HREM HRIM HOM HREM HOM PHAT GUHY AKUBJIKA YAI SV AHA The mantra is fo und in the tenth chapter of the KMT. By omitting OM and SV AHA the Sword Weapon (kha{igiistra) mantra is formed. This is the mantra of one of Kubjika's Maids (Diiti), namely, that of the Weapon. She is identified with Guhyakaii who is also known as Guhyesvari. The KMT goes on to inform us that the source of this mantra is the separate, independent (svatantra) Tantra called Guhyakiilf consisting of 125,000 verses (KMT 10/20-30).

Of these two Siddhilak�mi enjoys a place of special honour as the secret lineage goddess of the former Malia kings, known to the public as Taleju.43 It is worth noting that even in only that the cult of Guhyakiili pre-existed the KMT, but that it was colonized by the Kubjikii cult at a very early period of its development. As there is at least one Nepalese manuscript of the KMT belonging to the first half of the eleventh century (see below), we know that this must have taken place by that time. 41 Wright's History of Nepal (1966: 148) refers to a Tirhutiya (i.e. Maithili) Brahmin called Narasirhha Thakur who was instrumental in inducing King Pratiipamalla to found the well-known Guhyesvari temple close to the Pasupatiniitha temple near Kathmandu. This took place in 1654 A.D. According to this chronicle he found the spot where the goddess was located \"having perused the book Mahakiila Sanhitii (sic.)\". A similar reference is found in the Riijavamsiivalr (6: 4). The worship of Guhyesvari in the Valley in conjunction with Pasupati certainly predates the founding of this temple (Michaels 1994: 315). Indeed, the couple and their residence in the Valley are mentioned in several early Tantras, including those of the Kubjikii cult. She is known, for example, to the Nisisarhciiratantra, of which there is a palm leaf manuscript (see bibliography). The text is written in old Newari script which may be as old as the twelfth century or earlier. But although the text is early, the exposition of the pz{has found in this text does not agree. with that found in references from the Nisisamciira quoted in Kashmiri works (see Dyczkowski 1988: 156 fn. 25 1). Several folios of this manuscript are missing; moreover, the order of the remaining ones is badly disarranged. The reference begins on the bottom line of the first part of the fourth folio in the serial order in which the manuscript was microfilmed. The unedited text reads: nepiile samsthitan devam pasuniimm patir iD'ate I guhyesvarfsamiiyuktam sthiinapiilasamanvitam II The god who resides in Nepal is considered to be the lord of the fe ttered (i.e. Pasupati). He is linked to Guhyesvarf and is accompanied by the guardian(s) of the place. The Mahiikiilasamhitii has been published (see the bibliography). There are no early references to this text and it is virtually unknown outside the Kathmandu Valley. One wonders whether it was a Newar creation. Further research will disclose the degree of influence this Tantra, of which there are numerous Nepalese manuscripts, has exerted on the Newar cult of Guhyakiili. 42 This Tantra which, along with the Manthiinabhairavatantra of the Kubjikii school, is the longest known in existence, extends for 24,000 verses. No part of it has yet been edited and published. It was well known to the Kashmiri Saivites of the eleventh century who referred to it respectfully as 'Tantrariijabhattiiraka'- the Venerable King of Tantras. This was a major source of the Kashmiri Kiili cult (as Kiilasarhkar�arm as it is of the cult of the goddess Taleju (i.e. Siddhilak�rni) for the Newars. 43 Referring to the goddess Kiili, Sanderson (1988: 684) states that: \"the Newars, who maintain the early traditions of the region, preserve her link with the Northern Transmission. For them Guhyakiili is the embodiment of that branch of Kaulism. Linked with her in this role is the white goddess Siddhalak�mi (always written Siddhilak�rni in Nepal) one of the apotropaic deities (Pratyangirii) of the Jayadrathayiimala and the patron goddess of the Malia kings (1200 - 1768) and their descendants.\" This statement is, I suppose, based on the study of Newar Kaula liturgies. Thus, without having to ask embarrassing questions the scholar has penetrated one of the Newars' most closely guarded secrets by studying their liturgies. This is a fine example of how the work of the"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"MARKS. G. DYCZKOWSKI 25 the case of the cult of the goddess Siddhilak�mi, despite her central role in Newar Saktism, both in its most esoteric fo rms and its public manifestations, where she figures as Taleju, the goddess Kubjika operates, as elsewhere in the rich complex of Newar Saktism, as the primary source of power in numerous very secret, and hence especially powerful, ritual contexts. An example of this process is the secret connection that the Taleju priest establishes between the two goddesses. It is this connection and identification, enacted ritually at prime moments in the liturgical cycle, which keeps the king's goddess powerful. Thus the source of power and, ultimately, the most fu ndamental identity of Siddhilak�mi - the lineage goddess of the king - is Kubjika, the lineage goddess of his priest. But despite her truly extraordinary importance fo r Newar Saktas, the goddess Kubjika, unlike the popular goddesses Kali and Tripura, is virtually unknown outside the circles of her Newar initiates in the Kathmandu Valley. Even so, the Kaula Tantras concerned with her cult are numerous and extensive, as is befitting of a goddess that has been given such prominence. Her virtually total obscurity outside Nepal does not mean that Kubjika is a Nepalese goddess. The Newars have been surprisingly prolific as compilers of liturgical works fo r their own rituals, but there is, as yet, little evidence that they have composed Tantras of their own.44 It appears fr om the studies made so far that virtually all of the very many Tantras fo und in manuscripts in Nepal were labouriously copied and brought from outside the Kathmandu Valley. Despite the very rich sacred geography of the Kubjika Tantras, Nepal is only very rarely mentioned. On the other hand, innumerable references in anthropologist in the field can be usefully supplemented by that of the textual scholar. We may also note that if Sanderson is correct when he says that \"Guhyakal.I is the embodiment of the Northern Transmission\" for the Newars, it follows that the Northern Transmission has been subordinated by them to the Western Transmission belonging to the goddess Kubjikii. 44 See the end of note 41. The Kubjikopa1Ji$ad, although not technically a Tantra, is virtually so in much of its content. This text may have been produced by a Newar Brahmin. The Brahminical pseudo-Vedic character of the text is not only attested by the extensive quotations it makes from the Atharvaveda but by its own statement that \"a worshipper of Kubjikii ... should be a brahman from Parasara's clan and a teacher in the school of Pippaliida-saunaka as taught in the Atharvaveda\" (Kubjikopa1Ji$ad 10/2). The relatively late date of the text is indicated by the central place it gives to the Ten Mahiividyiis (see above fn. 36). That the text may well have been written by a Newar initiate who was acquainted with the worship of both Kubjikii and Siddhilak�mi transpires from the central place given to Siddhilak�mi as the most important of the Mahlividyiis and her identification with Kubjikii in her form as Siddhikubji. By the time the Ten Mahiividyiis became popular in India, the worship of Siddhilak�mi and other related goddesses outside the Kathmandu Valley had probably ceased. Moreover, the worship of Siddhilak�mi as one of the Ten Mahiividyiis in the primary textual sources is very rare, if not unique to this text. Thus her place of honour as the greatest, most regal of these ten 'royal' goddesses, as they are described in this text, indicates that this text may well have been written by a Newar Brahmin initiate who may have been one of the priests of the goddess Taleju I Siddhilak�mi."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"26 THE CULT OF THE GODDESS KUBJIKA the texts clearly indicate that Kubjika was originally an Indian goddess. Specifically, the Kubjika Tantras frequently refer to her as the goddess of the land of Kmikana, which corresponds to the long strip of land between the Western Ghats and the sea, and, even more specifically, to her connection with the city of Candrapura. Of the many places sacred to the goddess in India mentioned in her Tantras, only Candrapura is identified as the home (ve.Sman lit. 'house') of the Western Transmission, which is that of the Kubjika cult. The passage cited below goes so far as to identify the place with the goddess's maJ)<;lala, her most personal abode: That, indeed, is the Western House (vesman) called the City of the Moon (Candrapura). Th is is the fi rst maf},fiala and (fi rst source of) authority fo r (the initiates) who recite mantras.45 We know of two Candrapuras that fit the descriptions found in the texts. One was an important town in what is now the Garwal district of the western Himalaya. Not far from it is a mountain called Candraparvata. Moreover, both these places are approximately to the west of Kailasa which is where these places are said to be located by the KMT, the earliest and root Tantra of the Kubjika cult.46 On the basis of this and other references, and because of the goddess's many association with mountains, I have expressed the opinion in a previous publication that Candrapura was located somewhere in the Himalayas (Dyczkowski 1988a: 91). This was also the opinion of Goudriaan (Goudraain 1981: 52) but not of Schoterman (Schoterman 1982: 37) who preferred the South Indian location detailed below. The other Candrapura is located in Goa, the ancient kingdom of KoiikaQ.a. Nowadays it is called Chandor, and it was the capital of the Silaharas, who ruled this area in the fourth century A.D. At the beginning of the eleventh century, the Kadambas of Goa under Sa�thadeva (c. 1005-1050 A.D.) extended their authority over the whole of Goa, vanquishing the Silaharas. They moved the capital from Candrapura (Chandor) to Goapuri (Goa Velha) in about 1052.47 The following passage from chapter 43 of the Satsiihasrasarhhitii confirms the connection between Candrapura and the Kadamba kings. The passage talks about an important founder figure called Siddhanatha (variously named, O<;l<;lisanatha, Tu�Q.Inatha, and Kiirmanatha in the text) and his advent to the city of Candrapura, of which the Tantra says: 45 46 47 etad vai pascimarh vesma candrapuryeti niimata� I mal}{ialarh prathamedarh tu adhikiirarh tu mantrifJ(im II (KuKh 3/12) mero� pascimadigbhiige I (KMT 1/59c) S.

Like the king of the gods, he was the ruler of all the worlds. 49 The text goes on to relate how the king took initiation from the sage and was admonished by him to ensure that all his subjects did the same. The Tantra thus presents Kubjika as a goddess of a royal cult, and she is indeed one of the Newars' royal goddesses. And there seems to be little reason to doubt that, at some stage in the early development of the tradition, Kubjika was a South Indian goddess.50 However, this South Indian Candrapura may not have been the goddess's original home. The earlier KMT does refer to the land of KoilkaQ.a but does not stress its importance in the emphatic manner the later Kubjika Tantras do. In fact, as Heilijgers-Seelen (1994: 2) points out: \"the texts themselves are inconsistent with regard to the place of origin of the Kubj ika cult, but the basic text [i.e. the KMT] seems to locate this place somewhere in northern India in the western regions of the Himalayas.\" The later Tantras, namely the $atsiihasrasarhhitii and the Manthiinabhairavatantra, on the other hand, repeatedly stress the connection 48 This and the following references are taken from my, as yet, unpublished critical editions.

Mahesvarananda, who was a disciple of Vidyananda and lived in the part of South India ruled at that time by the Cholas, quotes from Kubjika sources in three places in his auto-commentary on the Mahiirthmaiijarf (two on p. 4 and one on p. 126). Although these references have not been traced in the KMT, he appears to have been acquainted with the Kubjika Tantras which, although little known, must therefore have been in circulation in South India in the fourteenth century.

These facts seem to indicate that the Kubjika cult was, as Goudriaan says, \"originally located in the Himalayan region\" (Goudriaan 1981: 52). Subsequently, probably not much after it began (which was, probably in second half of the tenth century), the centre of the cult shifted to the mid-western coastal regions of India where, by a fortunate coincidence or design, another Candrapura was located. That the cult was already established in central India by the eleventh century with its centre in this Candrapura is supported by the following inscription fr om Kart).ataka (Nelamangala taluka) dated 1030 A.D. commemorating the founding of a Siddhesvara temple: At the foot of a wonderful tree in Candrapuri, [which is] situated by the western ocean, Adinatha is installed. By merely recalling his excellent lotus fe et, the residual effects of acts committed in past lives are destroyed. His disciple ... was Chayadinatha [\"Shadow Adinatha.\" His disciple was Stambhanatha] .... His son, versed in the meaning of the Kalagama [sic. Kulagama], was the yati Dvipanatha .... His disciple was born Mauninatha munipa. The bearer of the latter's commands was Riipasiva [the priest in charge of the temple] ... devoted to the Saiviigama.51 It is possible that the Riipasiva mentioned in this inscnptlon is the same Riipasiva who wrote, or compiled, a commentary on sections of the Sarsahasrasarhhitii and the Manthiinabhairavatantra. If so, we know from the colophon of his work that he resided at some time in Kashmir2 and received initiation in Pravarapura (modem Shrinagar) where, as the colophon states, \"the venerable Vitasta joins the Indus\".53 Although the Kubjika cult was not popular in Kashmir, there is evidence attesting its presence there in the first half of the eleventh century.54 We must be catious however in making this identification because the Satsiihasrasarhhitii and the Manthiinabhairavatantra themselves cannot be dated earlier than the beginning of the eleventh century as both of them apparently refer to major Muslim invasions. Thus, the latter text states that the demon RavaQ.a incarnated in this Age of Darkness (kaliyuga) and descended onto the bank of the Indus (Dyczkowski 1987a: 12, 98ff. ).

This may be one of the reasons for the confusion between the two Candrapuras in the texts. But whether the Kubjika cult was introduced into Nepal from the Western Himalaya as Heilijgers-Seelen (1994: 2) asserts or not is a matter for further research. Nowadays, almost all the manuscripts of the Kubjika Tantras and related works are in Nepal or are of Nepalese origin. The text with by far the greatest number of manuscripts is the KMT. Sixty-six manuscripts, complete and fragmentary, of the KMT have been found and examined by the editors of the KMT. This is truly a massive number for any sort of text, especially Tantric, and represents yet another measure of the immense popularity and importance of the Kubjik� cult amongst the Newars. All of these manuscripts except one, which is in old Maithili or Gau<;II script, 57 appear to be of Nepalese origin. The oldest of these manuscripts is a short recension of the KMT called Laghvikiimniiya copied by Suhar�ajiva during the reign of Lak�rru1camadeva (1024-1040 A.D.) and is dated 1037-38 A.D.58 The colophon of a manuscript of another Kubjika Tantra, the Kularatnoddyota, informs 55 Mahmiid of Ghazni became Sultan in 997 A.D. Soon after his coming to power, he began a series of raids on India from his capital, Ghazni in Afghanistan. Historians disagree as to tlie exact number of these raids. According to Sir Henry Elliot, they were seventeen and took place almost every year (Smith 1995: 205) up to 1027 A.D. Although many of these incursions drove deep into the country, Mahmiid could do no more than annex the Punjab, or a large part of it, to the Ghazni Sultanate (ibid.: 208). 56 Sa!SS 3179cd.

There are numerous links between the Newars and the inhabitants of Mithila. These became especially close from the reign of Sthitimalla (1367-1395 A.D.). He married Rajalladevi, a member of the Bhaktapur royal family who was of Maithili origin. Indeed, scholars dispute whether Sthitimalla himself was from Mithila. But whether he was or not, it is a significant fact that the later Malia kings boasted that they were of Maithili origins. The repeated attacks on the Valley from the beginning of the Malia period onwards by Maithili raiding parties demonstrate the ease with which the Valley could be penetrated from Mithila. Again, Slusser (1982: 395) informs us that \"the script employed after the fourteenth century, now designated simply as 'Newari', is closely related to the writing of Mithila\". This fact is not only indicative of the close connection between the literate culture of the two peoples, it also renders the transition of a text from India through Mithila very easy. It is not impossible that some old manuscripts thought to be written in old forms of Newari are actually Maithili manuscripts. 58 The manuscript is NAK no. 5-877/57 = NGMPP reel no. A 4113.

(Slusser: I, 398). Thus we can safely say that the cult of the goddess Kubjika had not only reached the Valley by the beginning of the eleventh century but was already developing throughout it. Incidently, it is worth noting that it appears from the form of Vivekaratm1's name that he was a renouncer. Thus, although, as we have seen, Rajopadhyaya Brahmins became the centre and mainstay of the esoteric network of Newar Tantric Saktism, this does not necessarily mean that they were the original propagators of it in the Kathmandu Valley. Even so, they may well have played an important role in its spread, as they certainly did in its application and adaptation to Newar culture and religious life.60 59 The manuscript is NAK no. 1116 = NGMPP reel no.

If the dating of the original of this manuscript is correct and it belongs to the 11th century, then this is the earliest reference so far recovered to the place which was to fuse with its neighbouring settlements and ultimately give its name, after several centuries, to the city formed thereby.

DYCZKOWSKI 31 So far there is no evidence for the existence of the cult of Tripura in the Valley at this time. The reason for this may well be simply that the cult had not yet developed sufficiently in India. Early manuscripts of Saivasiddhanta Agamas and Paiicaratrasarhhitas establish that the Tantric cults of Siva and Vi�Q.u prescribed by these scriptures existed alongside their Pural).ic equivalents which drew extensively from them. These forms of Tantrism continue to be popular in South India but gave way to Kaula Tantrism in Nepal. The Bhairava Tantras, another important category of early Saivite Tantras, are exemplified by the (now exclusively Nepalese) manuscripts of the Brahmayiimala and the Srftantrasadbhiiva. Although these texts prescribe Bhairava cults, they are replete with rituals centred on the worship of the goddesses who are Bhairava's consorts. In this and in many other respects they represent a point of transition froni the earlier Saiva to the later Sakta cults.61 The Jayadrathayiimala, to which we have already referred as the root Tantra of the cult of Siddhilak�mi, considers itself to be a part of the Bhairava current.62 And the Srftantrasadbhiiva, as we shall see, is an important source for the Kubjika tradition. The Srftantrasadbhiiva is a Trika Tantra, that is to say, even though it is a Bhairava Tantra, as are all of the other Trika Tantras that are still extant or of which we know from references, it describes and gives special importance to the worship of a Triad (which is the literal meaning of the word 'Trika') of goddesses, namely, Para (lit. Supreme), Parapara (lit. Supreme-cum-Inferior) and A para (lit. Inferior), who are. worshipped along with their consorts the Bhairavas Bhairavasadbhava, Ratisekhara, this period, there were only two types of people who would easily have had this privilege, namely male Brahmins and ascetics. I believe that the latter were prominent in the initial stages of the formation and propagation of a wide range of Tantric cults, including those we are discussing here. In the subsequent phases of domestication and institutionalization, Brahmins played more important roles and in many places, as in the Kathmandu Valley, they became dominant. An interesting and important hybrid, which nicely combines the two, is the Brahmin renouncer. This fi gure, although unknown in the Kathmandu Valley at present, was immensely important in the development of all forms of Tantrism in India. 61 I do not mean to say that the cults prescribed by these texts led an exclusive existence apart from others. There always was, as there is now, overlapping of any one cult with others. Many of the cults of the Bhairava Tantras may have predated a large part of those of the Saivasiddhanta Agamas. The follower of one may also have been initiated into those of the other. One could say that this tendency to blend together diverse cults is the practical consequence of the radical polytheism of Hinduism as a whole. By this I mean that Hindus, like the ancient Greeks, never worship a deity alone. He or she is always accompanied by others even though, unlike the Greeks, Hindus may perceive the deity as having an ultimate, absolute identity. 62 A typical colophon found at the end of each chapter (patala) of the Jayadrathayiimala reads: iti bhairavasrotasi vidyiiptfhe siraschede jayadrathayiimale mahiitantre caturvithsatisiihasre '(this is a chapter of) the great Tantra, Jayadrathayiimala, (otherwise known as) the Sirascheda, consisting of twenty-four thousand verses which belongs to the Seat of Knowledge of the Bhairava current'.

The distinctive core of this pantheon (yaga/:l) is the three goddesses Para, Para para and A para and the two alphabet deities Sabdarasi[­bhairava] (also called Matrka[bhairava]) and Malini. Significantly Sanderson quotes a verse from a Kubjika Tantra, the Kularatnoddyota, which we have already had occasion to mention above, to support his view.64 The mantras of the three goddesses are given in the KMT,65 while Kubjika herself is occasionally identified with Siddhayogesvari, the principal goddess of the Trika system of the Siddhayogesvarfmata, one of the foremost authorities for the Kashmiri Saiva Trika.66 In the passage quoted below, Kubjika is equated with the 63 This is according to TA 15/323b-329b.

The mantra of Parapara is recorded in TA 30/20-6a, also ibid. 16/2 13-6a, where the Vidya is given in the reverse order. It consists of thirty-nine and a half syllables and is as follows: OM AGHORE HRII:I PARAMAGHORE HUM GHORARUPE HAI:I GHORAMUKHI BHIMABHI�� V AMA PillA PillA HE RU RU RA PHAT HUM HAI:I PHAT The Parapara mantra according to KMT 18/4-24 consists of forty-two and a half syllables.

Even though all three mantras in the two sources contain significant variants, we can say for both of the first two mantras, Para and Parapara, what Abhinavagupta says about Apara, namely, that \"even though it is basically the same, it presents itself in various ways\" (T A 30/28a). 66 devatai/:1. pujitii nityam brahmacaryiipariiyar.zai/:1.

This suggests that he was an initiate into this system or into a cognate one that allowed access to this Tantra. Moreover, this person or group of people was certainly influenced by the Trika system of this work. I have gone into this matter in some detail because it is exemplary of a general principle, namely that most, if not all, Tantric systems are built up at their origins by initiates of other systems. As initiates they would have a firm belief in the power of the most important mantras of those other systems and will therefore naturally tend to incorporate them into the new system they are building. Mantras and seed syllables have power in themselves: They enjoy the independent existence and identity of deities along with their attributes and limbs which, indeed, they are said to be. The incorporation of mantras into a system is thus equivalent to the incorporation of iconic fo rms. Similarly, the permutations of single mantras are equivalent to the permutations of their corresponding iconic fo rms. No Tantric system discovered to date is without similar precedents. The Saivasiddhanta incorporates in a modified form the Pasupata iconography and mantras of five-faced Sadasiva as a central part of its most original core.71 Cults expounded in the Bhairava Tantras similarly draw from the Siddhanta, maintaining, in varying degrees, a connection with it. A clear example of this is the cult of Svacchandabhairava which, although a Bhairava cult, is very close to those of Sadasiva in the Siddhantagamas and contains elements of Pasupata Saivism.72 It Srltantrasadbhiiva chapters 3, 6, and 8 .. There are three manuscripts of the Srltantrasadbhiiva, all of them preserved in Nepal. They are NAK 5/445 (A.D. 1097), 1/363 and 5/1983. I have already established the priority in time of the Trika goddesses with respect to the Kubjika Tantras in Dyczkowski 1987a: 83-85. 71 See Bhatt 1961: 22 ff. concerning the mantras of Sadasiva's five faces. 72 Arraj has examined the history and structure of the Svacchandatantra, the root text of the Svacchandabhairava cult, at length in his doctoral dissertation. See bibliography. He discerns various strata in the history of the ·svacchandatantra. These are: 1) Srauta and smiirta precepts and practice 2) Rudra: Specifically, part of the Satarudrlya has provided the Bahurilpa formula of sakala -Svacchandabhairava, used in the primary rituals throughout the Tantra (Arraj 1988: 31). 3) Vedic meta-ritualist and ascetic speculation. This includes meditation on OM (pra �va) and interiorized rituals focused on the vital breath. 4) Brahrninical siistras: Arraj sees similarities in the implicit theory of language with Bhartrhari. Other siistras include logic, astrology and medicine. Their presence is, however, not great. 5) Philosophical schools (darsana): These are, above all, Yoga and Siirhkhya, which have had great influence on the text. 6) Epics and Purfu:las: The influence of the Purfu:las is especially felt in the formulation of cosmol.ogies. 7) Vai�l).ava Paiicaratra: Its contribution may have been the modification of Sarilkhya cosmology through the addition of Maya in the theistic scheme of emanation. 8) Pa8upata: This includes what Arraj has listed separately as 'Rudra'. 9) Saiva: This group Arraj rightly, I believe, identifies with the Saivasiddhanta. Arraj and Dyczkowski (1987a: 139 fn. 24) point out that Brunner-Lachaux in her lengthy notes on her translation of the Somasambhupaddhati frequently refers, especially in the section dealing with initiation in part 3, to the Svacchandatantra and compares it at length with the statements of the Siddhantagamas and their commentators."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"MARKS. G. DYCZKOWSKI 35 appears that these layers in the formation of the cult were discerned by the Newars in their own way leading to the esoteric identification of Pasupati with a form of Svacchandabhairava. 73 The cults of the Bhairava Tantras included at least two species that were so strongly orientated towards the worship of goddesses that they were more Sakta (according to the later terminology) than Saiva. These were the Kali cults and those centred on the worship of the Three Goddesses. The next step was the move into another class of Tantra and cult. These were the Kula Tantras, which distinguished themselves from all the other types of Tantra by referring to themselves as Kaula and to the others as Tantrika collectively. The Kubjika Tantra represents a major point of transition between these two modalities. The dictates of the cult appear in many respects to be in an intermediate and mediating phase between the two. The cult of the goddess Kubjika is, as the Tantras of her cult tirelessly remind us, fu lly Kaula. Even so, they take care to recall the link with the earlier Bhairava Tantras. The goddess and her tradition is 'established in Siva's sphere' (siimbhavama�uj.alasthii). We are frequently told that the Kubjika cult appears at the end of the Kali age. This appeared to be such an important fe ature of the Kubjika cult that the KMT named it the Pascimamnaya, literally the 'Last (or 'Final) Tradition' of the Kaula cults. Even so, the initiate is admonished to respect and even worship the 'previous tradition' (purviimniiya). This consisted, collectively, of all the earlier Kaula schools. These were believed to be the earliest ones, all of which were derived from Matsyendranatha and his six disciples. As the system developed after the redaction of 73 Newar Kaulas worship Svacchandabhairava independently. But his most important role is as the consort of Kubjika. He appears in this capacity in, for example, the important Bhairava fire sacrifice called Bhairaviigniyajna. In this context he is worshipped as Sikhasvacchandabhairava. In this form he is the consort of Kubjika when she is worshipped along with six goddesses who are her attendants (dutl) and embodiments of the six limbs of her mantra. Apart from innumerable references in Newar liturgies, several references to this form of Svacchandabhairava have also been found in inscriptions. I am grateful to Niitan Sarma for pointing this out to me. Even at the initial scriptural level, when the Tantra was compiled, Svacchandabhairava served as an intermediary between the mild Sadasiva of the Siddhanta and the fierce Bhairava of the Bhairava Tantras. Subsequently, in the course of the development of his liturgies amongst the Newars, he became the esoteric identity of Pasupati. In retrospect one could hazard to say that the identification was already an open possibility in the Svacchandatantra. Arraj notes a number of Pasupata influences in the formation of the cult at the scriptural level (Arraj 1988: 40-46). Especially, important, I would say, is the close similarity in the identity of Svacchandabhairava's five faces and those of Pasupati, on the one hand, and Sadasiva of the Siddhantagamas, on the other. Thus this cult, which is very important for Newar Saktism, bridges the gap between Pasupati and Sadasiva on one side and on the other serves as an intermediary between the Bhairava and the Kaula Tantric cults. The net result is that, as the consort of Guhyakali who is worshipped secretly as an aspect of Kubjika (see above, fn. 39), Pasupati is worshipped secretly as Sikhasvacchandabhairava in conjunction with Kubjika."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"36 THE CULT OF THE GODDESS KUBJIKA the KMT, the name Pa8cimamnaya remained but the word pascima came to be understood as meaning 'western', which is its other common meaning. This was facilitated by the development of the parallel Kali cult which referred to itself as the Uttaramnaya -lit. 'Northern Tradition' or 'Higher Tradition', possibly because it did, in reality, develop in the North of India, specifically in Kashmir and the neighbouring Himalayas. As the Pascimanaya developed it came to incorporate Kali to increasing, albeit' moderate, degrees.74 However, this element, along with the addition, at a still later period, of Tripura cults,75 does not form a part of the essential core of the system. The fo rm Tantrism has assumed amongst the Newars in the Kathmandu Valley is deeply relevant to our enquiry, not only because Kubjika, who is the prime fo cus of this paper, has been made central and fundamental to the whole of Newar Saktism, but because Newar Saktism is a direct (although, of course, not the only possible) historical development of processes of synthesis and syncretism that were already at work in the development of the Tantras and their cults. In the rest of this paper I will examine some fe_atures of the exchanges, mutual influences, common fo rms, and specific identities of these cults in relation to one another and ·individually that 74 We have already observed the manner in which the KMT colonized the cult of Guhyakii.li. Also, see below. 75 The goddess Kamesvari is known to the KMT. She is said to reside in Kamariipa where Kubjikii meets her in her colonizing tour of the Indian subcontinent described in chapter 2. The following is a summary of the relevant passage. The goddess goes to a place cailed Kamika. There is a river there called Ucchu�mii which is in the forest of Mahocchu�ma. There is a lake there with the same name together with another one called Nila. The goddess delights on both sides of the banks (of these lakes?). Again the goddess (Kubjikii), whose limbs are the universe and the principles of existence, sees a goddess there who is \"proud with the pleasure of passion (kiima) and burning with the Lord of Love (vasantatilaka). She is melting and melts the three worlds with (her) desire.\" Seeing her the Mother smiles and asks her who she is and how she has come there. She calls her \"passionate one\" and is pleased with her for having shown her all these wonderful things. She tells her that she should be called Kamesvari because in this way she has obtained the fruit of the bliss of passion. Out of compassion the form of passion (kiimarupa) has been fashioned before her and so this great sacred seat (where the goddess Kamesvari resides) which is called Kiimarupa will come into existence during the Kali Age. Her consort will be Candriinanda. He will be seated on the shoulders of the Wind. Passionate, he will be Kamadeva (KMT 2/82 - 94). The Tripura cult has incorporated the identification of Kiimesvari with the early prototype of Tripura so well that most initiates into the Tripurii cult would not be able to distinguish the two. The relative antiquity of the Kubjikii cult with repect to that of Tripura is, I believe, well exemplified by the appearance of Kamesvari in this passage with no reference either here or elsewhere to Tripurii, her later, developed form. The consistent silence throughout the later Kubjika Tantras becomes strikingly eloquent when we notice the appearance of rituals centred on Tripura, in the form of Tripuriibhairavi, in the YogakhafJ4a of the Manthiinabhairavatantra. Tripura appears also in the CMSS, a relatively late Kubjikii Tantra, as the goddess of the Southern Tradition (da/cyi!Jiimniiya) where her identity with Kamesvari is evident (see Dyczkowski 1987a: 71)."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"MARKS.

The relationship the texts have with their living social, political, anthropological and cultural contexts - what they contribute to them and what they draw from them - will be examined elsewhere. Suffice it to say that we observe similar, if not the same principles operating in both dimensions, namely, the ideal one of the texts and the empirical one of their human contexts. We notice, fo r examP.le, in both cases an attempt to furnish the cult of each deity with everything that is neccessary to render it complete. Theoretically this should make it independent of all the others. But this is never the case either in the texts themselves or in their application. Indeed, in order to achieve this 'completeness' each cult assimilates elements from others. Even its most 'original' specific and specifying core is itself as much a product of a long historical process as is the uniqueness of its moment of creation. But this is not fe lt to be an opressive contingency; rather this continuity with the past is considered to be a mark of authenticity and authority. Concretely, in the case of the goddess Kubjika, we observe that in some re spects she has peculiar characteristics and traits which are virtually unique to her, while in others, she embodies many of the common characteristics of all the great goddesses of Hinduism. It is above all this fact, more even than the extent of her scriptural sources, which qualities Kubjika to be considered a great goddess - a Mahadevi- despite her extreme obscurity to the rest of Hinduism or, indeed, Hindu Tantrism in India. Thus, like all the great goddesses of Hinduism, of which the popular, Purfu,lic goddess Durga is the prime archetype,76 Kubjika incorporates into herself many other goddesses.77 Kubjika is an exclusively Kaula Tantric goddess and 76 Coburn writes concerning the Devfmiihiitmya well known as the source of the myth of origin of the goddess Durga: Of the various features of the Devfmiihiitmya, one stands preeminent. The ultimate reality in the universe is here understood to be feminine: Devi, the goddess. Moreover, the Devfmiihiitmya appears to be the first Sanskrit text to provide a comprehensive - indeed, well-nigh relentless - articulation of such a vision. From the time of the IJ.gveda onwards, of course, various goddesses had figured in the· Sanskrit tradition. But never before had ultimate reality itself been understood as Goddess.

Thus although the Kubjika Tantras do contain myths recounting the origin of the goddess KQbjika, there Is no specific myth in her case which accounts fo r the process whereby she includes other goddesses into herself as there is for the Purfu)ic goddess Durga. Even so, we can observe the results of this synthesis in her rituals, mantras, mal)(,iala, and her visualized fo rms. Accordingly, Kubjika is both a unique goddess and is exemplary in many respects of the other great Kaula Tantric goddesses, especially Tripura and Kali. Moreover, just as Kubjika's external fo rm is unique to herself, despite its composite nature, the same is true of her inner nature, that is, her metaphysical identity. Kubjika, like all the other great goddesses of the Kaula and Bhairava Tantras, is essentially the energy of universal, absolute consciousness (cicchakti) by means of which it does and is all things. Accordingly, Kubjika is said to be both creative and destructive.78 Even so, she is predominantly concerned with emanation (sr�fipradhiina). Her cult can thus be contrasted with that of Kali, which is predonlinantly concerned with withdrawal (samhiirapradhiina). Even so, the spheres of manifestation are the domains of both deities. The rituals of both goddesses represent both processes. But Kubjika, in several of her fo rms, is visualized,. like · Tripura, as a young 'erotic' goddess (see Dyczkowski: 1996), symbolizing her fe rtile creativity. Kali, on the contrary, is fi erce, thus symbolizing the reverse. Even so, both types are essentially concerned with creation, and this is symbolized by their occasional portrayal in sexual union with their male counterparts. Kubjika, as we shall see in the passage quoted below, feels shy at the prospect of her coupling even though this takes place as the necessary corollary of her marriage to the god. Kali, on the other hand, sits on top of her partner, who is reduced to such passivity by the fu ry of her passion that he can be variously portrayed as Siva in some iconic fo rms or as a corpse (sava) in others. Referring to the earthly counterparts of these divine couples, namely, the Siddha and his Tantric consort, the Y ogini, the Tantras distinguish between these two types of coupling by calling them 'pleasing union' (priyameliipa) and 'violent union' (ha[hameliipa), respectively. The fo rmer generates the lineage of accomplished adepts (siddha) and the world of sacred places in which they reside.

The special intensity and fertility of Kubjika, whose name literally means 'Humpback Lady', is further expressed by the transgressive image of the solitary80 goddess bent double in order to lick her own vulva. Thus she makes herself blissful freely and independently and is so fertile that she can generate the impregnating sperm with which she herself is to generate the universe. 81 But although both goddesses are represented in the context of their own special symbolism as independant and, hence, complete in themselves, both processes, which they respectively govern, must go together. Indeed, they are two aspects of a single process. In terms of the psychology of their symbolism only implicitely expressed in the texts, Kali is the radiantly Dark Goddess of light who is the shadow­like couterpart of the shining light blue82 Kubjika. Thus they are distinguished, even as they are integrated, both by the discerning consciousness of the renouncer yogi and by the .power of the symbolism of the householder's ritual action. Thus, Kubjika maintains her dominantly creative role, even when she is represented in her destructive mode and identified with Kali.83 In this aspect she 79 On the subject of witches - called in various parts of India by such names as I;>akini, I;>ayan, I;>ajan, Den, Dhakuni, Cetaki and Sakini - see Herrmann-Pfandt (1996) who explains that \"a husband of a human I;>akini has to cope with the danger of being sucked out or being brought to death through certain sickness.\" (ibid. p. 49). 8° Kubjika is not usually portrayed in this way as a solitary goddess (ekavtrii), although there are prescriptions in the Tantras for her worship in this form, In a passage quoted below we find another reason for her bent condition in relation to her union with her consort, in which she is portrayed in her much more common coupled condition (yiimalabhiiva). As usual, marriage and conjunction with the god tames the goddess even as it deprives her of her independence. Thus, in that situation, she is not in an uroboric state of self-regeneration but is generated from the god. 81 This aspect is evident in one of her common names, i.e. Sukriidevi, which means literally the 'Goddess Sperm'. Similarly, in a verse which is a part of the so-called Samvartiisutra (SatSS 111 and KuKh 111), which Newar initiates frequently recite in the course of their rituals to invoke Kubjika (iiviihana), she is said to be the goddess whose 'mensis is sperm' (bindupu$pii). This appellation not only symbolizes in a striking manner her androgenous nature (for which see Dyczkowski 1996) but also her powerful and independent fertility. 82 Kubjikii is said to be light blue 'like a cannabis flower' (atastpu�pasamkiisii) as is her mlll).<;iala, the Sarhvartiimlll).<;lala. 83 The root Tantra of the Kubjika cult, the Kubjikiimata, hardly refers to the goddess Kiili. Even so the connection between the two goddesses is clearly established from the beginning of the Tantra. The god Himavan has just praised the god Bhairava who has come to visit him in the hermitage in the Himalayas. Bhairava is pleased by Himaviin's devotion and offers him five boons. In response to these favours, Himaviin offers Bhairava his daughter whom he introduces as the young virgin (kumiirikii) Kiilika. We come to know that she was Umii in a pr evious life and that she is ultimately Kubjikii. In the later Manthiinabhairavatantra she is called Bhadrakiilikii.

Let us see what the texts themselves say. The first set of passages concern the goddess Kali. They are drawn from the Mahiinayaprakiisa, an important, unpublished text84 of the Kashmiri Kiilfkrama by An;tasililha, who belonged to the later part of the eleventh or beginning of the twelfth century. Extremely voracious, the network of ( Kiilf's) rays transcends both process (krama) and its absence. Abodeless and waveless, it is beyond the plane of both contact (with phenomena) and its absence.

It is the arising of the outpouring of the rays of th_at great, unconditioned consciousness which, said to be free of th'e darkness of both being and non-being, is intent on consuming (all things). 87 The fo llowing passage is drawn from a Kubjika Tantra, namely, the Kularatnoddy ota to which I have already had occasion to refer. The Tantra describes the origin of the goddess Kubjika as an embodiment of the creative desire (icchii) of the god Bhairava. Note how, even though she is the main deity, she is said to be the god's attendant as would befit a pious Hindu wife. But even so, the universe is generated from them by means of a union that is necessarily incestuous:88 Th e Will, inherent in the essential nature of the transcendent, imperceptible, supreme and supremely blissful Lord, shone fo rth (babhau). God; aroused by his own will, fa shioned a supreme body (vapu) (fo r himself). That (body) possessed every limb and was endowed with the previously (stated) attributes (of deity). Shining like billions of moons, it (was) an immense and marvellous mass of energy. Th e great lord, the venerable Kubjesa, accompanied by the encompassing attendants (iivara'f}a) of the Srfkrama (the tradition of the goddess Kubjikii), sat on the seat of the Wheel of Knowledge, adorned with the garland of Principles of Existence (tattva). Th e Lord of the gods, whose nature is beyond conception comtemplated his own imperishable, and sacred (bhiivita) nature, (the Self) of the venerable Wheel of Bliss.

Th us, 0 fa ir lady, as he contemplated himself, billions of aeons passed fo r (the god who) abides in the aloof reality (kaivalyiirtha) (of transcendence).

Bhairava represents the vital breath (priiiJ.Il). Its movement impells the motion of the mind and, with it, the flux of time. Kali is the divine consciousness who, intent on consuming the energies of manifestation that arise out of her own nature, absorbs the vital breath and with it time into her eternal nature (MP p. 7). Thus, far from being the god's pious bashful attendant, she devours him! When we couple this perception of the goddess with Ramalq�Qa's vision of the divine mother Kali devouring the children to whom she has just given birth, the reversal of perspective is virtually complete."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"42 THE CULT OF THE GODDESS KUBJIKA Abiding thus fo r a moment, he applied (his) mind (manas) to his own fo undation (sviidhi-�thiina).89 (Thus) he aroused (his) supreme power whose fo rm was coiled.

Th at 89 One of the major contributions that the Kubjikii cult has made to Siikta Tantrism as a whole is the well know system of Six Wheels (�a{cakra) visualized in the body as stations of the ascent of Kui:iC;ialini. Kubjikii is Kui:lC;ialini bent over in the form of a sleeping snake coiled in the first of these Wheels called muliidhiira -the Root Foundation. In this case, the energy within the body of Kujesa is not in this Wheel, which is located in the base of the genitals, but in the second Wheel along, namely Sviidhi�thiina - the Wheel of the Self-Supported. In this context, the collocation of this energy here is appropriate. The Wheel of the Self-Supported is the place where the erect penis makes contact with the cervix at the base of the womb during sexual intercourse. Thus this Wheel is the centre of the first point of contact in the union of Siva and Sakti from which the emission (visarga) that generates the universe originates. But although this makes sense, even so, given the prestige of the Six Wheel system in the Kubjika Tantras, which is at the very core of the cult, one wonders at the anomalous role of this Wheel here. Is it a hangover from an earlier formulation of the Six Wheels when there were only five? 90 The Tantra appears to imply that Kubjika, as Mahiimiiyii, should be identified with Durgii, the foremost public representation of the Great Goddess. Newar initiates into Kubjika's cult stress how Kubjikii is preeminent amongst all the great goddesses of Newar Siiktism because she is Mahiimiiyii in a more direct, original sense than the other goddesses, even though they are also all identified with Durgii (as Mahi�asuramardini- the Slayer of the Buffaloe Demon), who acts as their public exoteric form. 91 We notice here that the usual thirty-six principles found in the Saiva Tantras and at times also recognized in the Kubjikii Tantras, have in this passage been reduced to the more basic Sjirhkhya set of twenty-five plus one, if we include the goddess herself. The Kubjikii Tantras occasionally identify the goddess with Nature (prakrti), which is an identification found in the Pur�as and in the later Siikta Tantras. When this identification is made, Siva figures as the Person (puru�a), who is not just the individual soul of the Siirhkhya who goes by the same name, but the divine male counterpart of the goddess. The number of principles in such cases is then usually about twenty-five to twenty-eight, varying in detail according to the particular text and its cult. Is the set up in the Kubjikii cult of the Kularatnoddyota a first step towards the later conceptions or an archaic remnant of an earlier pre-Tantric theistic Siirhkhya?"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"MARKS.

G. DYCZKOWSKI 45 two cults share basic, common goals. These include a vast· range of benefits collectively referred to as accomplishments -siddhi -consisting of an amazing number of magical and yogic powers. Alongside these mundane aims, we find soteriological ones concerned with liberation (mukti). This is portrayed variously as a positive, permanently blissful condition and/or as the ultimate condition resulting from the extinction of all suffering and contingency called Nirval)a. According to the Kubjika Tantras, the source and essence of this extinction is the goddess Kubjika herself. She is the Void (vyoman, kha, akiisa ) of the energy Beyond Mind (unmanf).95 This energy moves up perpetually into the highest sphere of absolute being which this school calls 'Siva's mal)gala (sambhavama1J4ala) ', reminding us of the close association between the Saiva and the Sakta Tantras. She then flows down from it into the spheres of her emanations, while she continues to reside within it. As the goddess behaves in this way, she is called SambhaviSakti and Rudrasakti.96 Both of 95 Like other major deities of various Tantric traditions, including Siva and even Vi$QU, Kali is identified with the Void of consciousness. But her special domain is, as her very name suggests, time (kiila). Abhinavagupta explains in his Ta ntriiloka : Again, time (can be experienced) both as a succession (krama of moments) as well (as eternal time) free of succession. Both aspects abide entirely within consciousness. Thus scripture af firms that Kiilf (the Goddess of Time) is the Lord's supreme power. It is that same power which, by its spontaneous development (pra roha), manifests outside consciousness succession and its absence, encompassed within its. own nature, and so abides as the (life-giving) activity of the vital breath (prii1J-llvrtti). Consciousness alone, very pure and of the nature of light, severing objectivity from itself, manifests as the sky void of all things. That is said to be the voidness of consciousness and is the supreme state yo gins attain by reflecting on objectivized manifestation with an attitude of negation (neti neti). Th is same void Self (khiitman) is called the vital breath, the throb (spanda) and wave (urmi) of consciousness. By virtue of its inherent inner outpouring ( samucchalatva), it fa lls upon the objectivity (which it) separated from (itself) with the intention of taking possession of it. (TA 6/6-11) The identification of the goddess with the energy of the Transmental (unmani) is also not unique to the Kubjika Tantras. The Agamas (i.e. Tantras) of the Saivasiddhanta regularly prescribe the worship of Siva's consort as the power of the Transmental. As in the Kubjika Tantras, Siva's consort in such Tantric texts is also understood to be the intermediary between the spheres of emanation, which are within the purview of the mind, and the transcendent above them; beyond mind. But whereas this conception figures occasionally in these types of Tantric text, it assumes a central role in the theology of the goddess Kubjika. 96 rudrasaktil:z sadii pujyii pf(hiiniim kfrtaniid api I siddhirh sphu{ii pradiitiirf srfkujiikhyiirh niimiimy aham II I salute the venerable (goddess) called Kujii who, clearly apparent, bestows accomplishment, she who is to be constantly worshipped as Rudra 's energy and by praising the sacred seats (in which she resides).

It is said to be the absolute itself, which is called the 'Neuter'. Beyond the male Siva and the fe male Sakti,98 it is their source within which they fuse into one. This energy of bliss in its primary, unmanifest state pervades the Void of consciousness.99 At the same time, in its active manifest form, it is the triple energy (trisakti)100 of Will, knowledge and action. 97 For example, see MV 1144cd-5: ajfiiinena sahaikatvam kasyacid vinivartate II rudrasaktisamiivi$!a/:t sa yiyiisu/:t sivecchayii I bhuktimuktiprasiddhyartham nfyate sadgururii prati II (It may happen) that the unity a person has with (the condition of ) ignorance ceases. (Such a one) is penetrated by Rudra's energy. By Siva 's will, he desires to go to a true teacher and is led (to one) so that he can attain liberation and (worldly) enjoyment. Abhinavagupta considers this passage, and the correct understanding of the function of Rudrasakti, important enough to quote and comment on it twice in his Tantriiloka (see T A 4/33-5 and 131199-203). 98 The KumiirikiikhaiJ{ia of the Manthiinabhairavatantra declares that: It is neither fe male ·nor is its fo rm male, that bliss is the Neuter (absolute). (na strf [La puru$iikiiram iinandam tam napumsakam I KuKh 3/46ab). The goddess, who is the power of bliss (iinandasakti), is accordingly called Napurilsaka - the Female Eunuch. To the best of my knowledge this name is exclusive to the goddess Kubjika. Apart from this usage in the literature of the Kubjika cult, this is certainly a very rare, if not unique, form of the neuter noun napumsakam. 99 khastham nivartitiikiiram avyaktam bhairaviitmakam I evam iinandasaktis tu divyaliligii kramoditii II Located in the Sky (of consciousness), its fo rm has been completed (to perfection- nivartita) and, unmanifest, it is Bhairava. In the same way, the power of bliss is the divine (female) Liligii ( divyalingii) that has emerged from the sequence (krama - of the lineage and the liturgy). (KuKh 3/47) 100 These three energies are a standard set found not only in the Tantras but also in Purar:tic representations of Siva's energies. The triad is well known to the worshippers of the goddess Durga as the three goddesses who are the consorts of Brahma, Vi�QU, and Siva. They represent the three qualities (guJ:La) of Nature (prakrti) with which the goddess Durga is identified. Newar Kaula initiates also link their conception of these three energies with the qualities, representing this association by the respective colours of their three goddesses, who are the black Guhyakali, the red Kamesvari, and Siddhilak�mi who is white. Two pictures of this triad can be viewed in the museum in Bhaktapur. Note the conspicuous absence of Kubjika in this triad. This is because she is identified with Mahamaya, which is Nature (prakrti), their original source. Thus she is present there, in a sense, as all three. Or, to put it another way, she is their basic absolute and hence unmanifest, secret identity."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"MARKS. G. DYCZKOWSKI 47 Together these energies constitute Kubjika's nature as the generative Vulva (yoni). 101 The seed of the Vulva is the goddess's divine Command (ajfia) symbolically situated in the centre of the triangle of the Vulva, the goddess's mal).<}ala. Through this energy the world is created, and through it one attains the authority (adhikiira) to perform Tantric and Kaula rituals, initiate others and ultimately lead them to the same realization.102 The Ta ntra of the Churning Bhairava (Manthanabhairavtantra) tells us: In the centre (of the .maiJ{Jala) is the Place of Repose; it is the expansion (of emanation -prasara) and the experience (of ultimate reality), the understanding of which is one's own (spiritual) authority. 103 This same energy is also in the centre of the body, that is, between the two vital breaths of inhalation and exhalation. There, Kubjika abides in the fullness of her ambivalence. Blissful in the transcendent beyond worldly pleasure and its consequent pain, she is horrifying in her alluring beauty as the universal activity of time in her manifest universe: It is said that the power of bliss is merged between the inhaled (p raiJa) and exhaled breath ( apana). Located in the middle of the Stick of the Ca vity of Sp ace (i. e. SU$Umna), she pervades the energy of the consciousness of the individual soul. 101 yii sii saktir bhagiikhyiitii sambhor utsangagiiminz l kaulinz brahmacarye!Ja srfmiin devz napurilsakii II The energy called the Vulva (bhaga) who sits on Sambhu's Lap is, by virtue of (her) continence, Kaulinf, the venerable goddess Neuter (napurilsakii). (KuKh 3/63) The Sanskrit of these texts is not infrequently deviant. Here is a particularly interesting example of how deviant Sanskrit can be employed with a meaningful purpose. The expression 'srfmiin devf napurilsakii' combines an irregular masculine form of address ('srzmiin') and, as we have already noted, the peculiar transformation of a neuter noun into a feminine adjectival name (napurilsakii), both with reference to the goddess, to represent her multivalent nature. Other cases of deviant Sanskrit have not, and will not, be noted here. 102 This interesting and original concept, reminiscent in some ways of the Tantric Buddhist conception of Bodhicitta -'Mind of Enlightenment', is dealt with extensively solely in the Kubjika Tantras. All beings whatever their status, gods, men or demons, have spiritual authority because they have received the Command (iijnii) of the goddess Kubjika. This Command permits them to exert this authority within their jurisdiction. This doctrine may well have served to justify the configuration of Newar Kaula Tantrism around this goddess in the radical manner in which it is at present. 103 madhye visriimabhumiril prasaram anubhavaril pratyayaril sviidhikiiram II (KuKh l/3c)"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"48 THE CULT OF THE GODDESS KUBJIKA Slender, her limbs variegated by time (kiila) and moment (velii), she awakens (the initiate) to (ultimate) reality.

The sacred geography of these Tantras have much in common with those of their Hindu equivalents of the time, including the Kubjika Tantras.107 The triangle in the centre of Srlcakra is also occupied by these seats, and the siddhas who reside in them are also the same. But they are not extensively worshipped as happens in the Kubjika cult. Indeed, there are good reasons to believe, which we shall investigate in another publication, that the innermost triangle of Sricakra is the same one described in the Kubjika Tantras. It appears that the Srlvidya tradition, which post-dates the earliest Kubjika Tantras, was so inspired by the power of this triangular Y antra that it chose to incorporate it as the centre piece of its own complex Y antra, the Srlcakra. The Kalikrama also thinks of the supreme power as simultaneously emanating and being the sacred seat of its energies: 0 mother!

They have not known the supreme secret and their body is like that of the demon Mara who tormented the Buddha (Vimalaprabhii, vol. 3 pp. 146-8). This body is the triangular Vulva (bhaga) of the goddess, which this verse describes and the Kubjika Tantras teach the adept should project into his own body.

The corresponding Kali cult is the Kalikrama. The term 'krama' means literally 'sequence' and, by extension, a lineage, tradition or transmission. These are common, non-technical uses of the word. In a technical sense, 'krama' denotes a Kaula liturgy, consisting as it does of a sequence of actions and recitations of mantras. Unlike the Srikrama, the Kalikrama includes within the sequence of the rite of adoration (pujakrama) the sequences of emanation, persistence, withdrawal and the inexplicable (anakhya). The Madhavakula section of the Jayadrathayamala, to which Abhinavagupta refers in his treatment of Kaula ritual, declares that: (According to this practice), in order to attain both worldly enjoyment (bhoga) and liberation, one must worship the tetrad of emanation, persistence, withdrawal and the inexplicable together with the sacred seats and the burning grounds .109 The four moments of emanation, persistence, withdrawal and the inexplicable are worshipped as separate configurations of goddesses. The cult of Srividya, like the Saivasiddhanta, and indeed most sophisticated Tantric ritual, replicates through ritual action the cyclic creation and destruction of the universe.110 It is particularly well represented in the ritual program of the Kalikrama. Indeed, in the Kalikrama they are considered to be fundamental aspects of the goddess herself: (Oh Uma), unfolding awareness of creation, persistence and destruction! the da wning (of enlightened consciousness), unobstructed, eternal and imperishable, unfolds, illumined by (the devotion) of your devotees .... u1 Moreover, the three states are contained in a fourth one beyond them called 'Nameless' (Anakhya).

Even though Kubjika is frequently called the Nameless, she is not described as the fourth inexplicable consciousness which encompasses the triad of creation, persistence and destruction, as happens in the Kalikrama. Let us examine some sample texts in order to observe the difference this identification makes. In the following passages Kubjika is called the Nameless (Anama or Anakhya) and she is identified with the energy of consciousness called Transmental (Unmana): Th ere, at the end of the mind, there is nothing else except the (energy) which is beyond the mind (manonmanf). (And so), she is called the Transmental (unmanii), the supreme (energy), who transports the nectar (of immortality). 113 Again: Above that is the Transmental (unmanii) state; that state (corresponds to the) Siimbhava (p rinciple). (One attains it) once one has practiced (immersion in) the one Vo id where everything comes to an end. And once the Transmental at the end of the Vo id has been reached, who is it that is not freed fr om bondage?114 Emanation (sr$#) (generated) from the sequence (krama) abides alone in the Vu lva, fa cing downwards. (This energy is) the Transmental (manonmanf), the essential Being (of all things - sadbhiivii) and the great wave (of the energy of consciousness) whose fo rm is Light. 115 112 The root Tantra of the Kashmiri Kalikrama is the. Jayadrathayamala of twenty-four thousand verses to which we have already had occasion to refer as the most authoritative scripture of the Newar cult of Siddhilak�mi. The Jayadrathayamala is a very important work for many reasons. One of these is the relatively frequent reference to the phenomenology of the dynamic energy of consciousness which in this text is termed sarhvit. This term is rare in other non-Buddhist Tantras despite the fact that it is the basic term used for consciousness by Kashmiri Saivites. Even more striking, when compared to other Hindu Tantras of this period (i.e. prior to the development of Kashmiri Saivism), is its surpisingly sophisticated idealism which identifies subject and object through the act of perception. Although, the Mahiikiilasamhita is a Kall Tantra which post-dates the Jayadrathayamala and makes extensive use ofthis four-fold division of creation, persistence, destruction and a fourth state beyond them, it is devoid of the earlier idealism due to its exclusive focus on external ritual. The paradigm is so basic, whether internalized or not, that it is not surprising to discover that the Newar Kali rites are similarly dominated by this fourfold division. 113 niinyarh tatra bhavet kincin manasante manonmanf I 114 liS unmanii sa samiikhyata para hy amrtavahinf II ( KuKh 15/13) tasyordhve unmaniivasthii tadiivasthii hi sambhavam I sunyam ekarh samiibhyasya yatra sarvarh nivartate II sunyante tunmane priipte ko na mucyati bandhaniit I (KuKh 9/18-9ab) kramiit sr�ti/:t sthita yonau ekii eva hy adhomukhf I sadbhiiva sa mahan urmir jyotirupa manonmanf II (KuKh 24/44)"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"52 THE CULT OF THE GODDESS KUBJIKA Kubj ika is the energy 'beyond mind' which leads to the pure transcendent Being of her consort. She is the Inexplicable (Anakhya), Without Name (Anama) not, primarily, because she is the semper eternum of God's Being which encompasses past, present and future in its inexplicable simultaneity, although she is also this, but, above all, because she is, literally, beyond the mind. She is the final stage at the end of a vertical ascent through the expanse of immanence, at the extremity closest to transcendence. Again, the location of the multiple energies of the goddess is not only represented by the goddess's sacred seats. It also refers to the placement of the letters of the alphabet within a diagram called a prastiira. The letters of a mantra are extracted from this diagram. This is done by indicating the position of each letter in relation to other letters next to it. This process is the microcosmic parallel of creating the universe part by part from the phonemic energies that constitute the universal energy of the goddess. Thus, Kubjika, like other Kaula goddesses, is an embodiment of Speech. As such, she is both every single phonemic energy and so is the one 'Letter' (va�ii), and is also transcendent and so is called 'Devoid of Letter' (avar�ii): Vidyii, the auspicious power (sakti), residing in letter and that devoid of letter, is of two types. (One is the energy of) the syllables (of all mantras - a/cyarii). (The other is) the energy of consciousness. (By knowing this the adept attains) success (siddhi). On the path of the Vidyii is mental vigour (medha) (acquired) by action perceived (as correct) by the scrip ture. 116 Elsewhere the goddess says: She, 0 lord, is the deity and I have spoken of her as the deity. She has emerged from the cave hermitage (guhiisrama) and, devoid of sound (asvara), she transports sound ( svaraviihinf).117 The maQ.<;Iala of Samvarta, which is the fundamental maQ.<;Iala of the goddess Kubjika, develops from the triangle mentioned above. It consist of six parts which, drawing from the terminology of temple architecture are called 'prakiira'. The 'prakiiras' are the encompassing series of walls in a temple compound, or around a tree, which demarcate the sacred space around the centre where the deity resides.118 116 117 vidya niimii/cyara saktir dvidhair bhedair vyavasthita I cicchaktir iti siddhil:z syat sa van_ulvan;zaga subha II vidyamiirge ca medhas tu sastradr�tena karmar_zii I (KuKh 14/21-2ab) e�a sa devata devataya khyata maya prabho I guhasramiid vini�kranta asvara svaravahinf II (KuKh 17 /24) 118 An interesting feature of this temple is that it is not the temple of the great Sanskritic tradition, but the archaic tree shrine of popular local, folk tradition.

From this point of view, the drawing of the ma1,1<;lala symbolizes the deployment of the goddess in the time and space of eternal pervasion. This takes place by a process the Kubjika Tantras and the Kaiikrama call 'churning'. This is the process of emanation marked by the emergence of the individual energies or aspects (kala) of Kula, the universal energy with which Kubjika is identified.119 The Kubjika Tantra of the Churning Bhairava (Manthiinabhairavatantra) explains: Th us, (reality), supreme (transcendent) and inferior (immanent), is divided by the division (brought about by) the churning (manthiina) (of power and its possessor). In this way, Passion is present within emanation, the Passion which is the destruction of desire (kama). And that is Harhsa (the Gander), the Great Soul which is the nectar generated fr om the (p rimordial) fire. Th ese two are called Siva and Sakti. Th e triple universe is woven warp and woof (with them). Th is is the secret called the 'Great Ch urning ' (mahiimanthiina).120 apparently identify Kubjika with a local goddess who lived in a tree or a stone underneath it. Accordingly, her Circle (maiJ(fala) is the Circle of the Tree. The original circle being the shade of the tree of which the tree, and hence the stone, were the centre. Consistent with this symbolic representation of Kubjika's abode is her name, Siladevi- the Goddess Stone, as the goddess in the centre of this maQ<;iala. Interiorized, the Tree MaQ<;iala acquires the encompassing enclosur<fs that are normally built when the deity of the tree and the stone develop in importance. Thus the development of the Tree MaQ<;iala mirrors the development of the Hindu temple and the local, rural goddess of the Tree becomes the Great Goddess of the temple and the city who is kept hidden in her maQ<;iala. In the final section of this essay, I deal with the goddess's association with trees and vegetation. 119 The Kumarikii section of the Churning Bhairava Ta ntra defines the nature of this activity as follows: \"(The act of) churning is said to be emanation itself, which is the arising of the aspects of the (energy of) Kula (manthiinam sr�tir evoktarh kaulikam kalasambhavam II KuKh 17/35cd)\". Mahesvarananda, writing in South India during the thirteenth or twelfth century, quotes ·the Kramakeli in his Mahiirthamaiijari (p. 172). This important work by Abhinavagupta on the Kashmiri Kalikrama had, along with many other works of this tradition, reached South India from the North by that time. The same passage is also quoted by K�emaraja in his commentary, the Spandanir�Jaya (p. 6), on the Spandakiirikii. The passage explains that the god of the Kaiikrama is called Manthanabhairava, lit. the Churning Bhairava, because \"he engenders the creation etc. of all things (by arousing) and churning his own power\". In this case, the teachings of the Kaiikrama and Kubjika's Sn1a ama coincide. . 120 tasmiin manthiinabhedena bheditarh ca pariiparam II evarh sr�tigatiinaligarh analigarh kiimaniisanam I sa ca hamsam mahiitmiinarh jvalaniid amrtodbhavam II dvav etau sivasaktyakhyau otaprotamjagattrayam I etad rahasyam akhyatarh mahiimanthiinasarhjiiayii II (KuKh 24/27cd -29)"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"54 THE CULT OF THE GODDESS KUBJIKA The womb of energies, the Vulva, is, by a symbolically significant reversal and conjunction of polarities, known as the Vulva Phallus (yoniliizga) which is said to be 'churned from above'.

G. DYCZKOWSKI 55 The Newars, following a pattern common to Kaula Tantrism in general from the thirteenth or fourteenth century, classify the lineage goddesses as belonging to six traditions ($at;iiimniiya). They are symbolically arranged and worshipped in the four cardinal directions along with the nadir and the zenith. According to a representative Newar liturgy, they are: 1) Upper: Tripura 2) Lower: Hatakesvari or the Buddhist Vajrayogini 3) East: Piin:teSi 4) North: forms of Kali including Guhyakali, Siddhilak�rni and Dak�ir:1akali 5) West: Kubjika 6) South: Nisesi123 These six goddesses and consorts, or their equivalents, are worshipped in the comers of a six-sided figure formed from two triangles. One triangle faces down and represents Sakti - the lineage goddess. The other faces up and represents Siva - the goddess's consort. This figure, seen very commonly in and around Newar temples and houses symbolizes the union of opposites represented by these divine, all­embracing polarities. Union takes place between the triangles, at the comers and in the centre, which is marked by a dot, representing the fecund fusion of the vital seed of the couple. Kashmiri Saiva texts explain that this figure also represents the sexual union of the divinized human couple engaged in a special type of Kaula ritual.124 123 I have drawn this information from Pascimajye�thiimniiyakarmiircanapaddhati/J, (fols. 87b-9lb) where the worship of the deities of six traditions is described as a part of the regular rite of the western tradition (pascimiimniiya, which is that of the goddess Kubjika). It is important to note that, whatever the tradition, the deities of all six must be worshipped. Thus the initiation Newars receive not only initiates them into the worship of their own lineage deity but also into the worship of all of the others. The lineage goddess is not worshipped exclusively; but she is given pride of place. Moreover, whoever one's own lineage deity may be, the mru:tc;iala in which the deities of the six lineages are worshipped is enclosed by Kubjika's mantra (see below). Thus Kubjika, in the form of her mantra, encompasses them all and thereby energizes them. The contents of the six traditions are the ones prescribed by the Pariitantra. In 1947 a series of articles written by the Nepalese majorgeneral Dhana Sarhser Jatigabahadur Rii.Qii came out in the Hindi magazine Car:tflf. In these articles the author expounds the pantheon and related matters of these six traditions on the basis of the Pariitantra and other texts considered authoritative by Newar Siiktas. Note that the Pariitantra (chapter six) prescribes the worship of Vajrayogini as the deity of the Lower Tradition, stating that this is the tradition of the Buddhists. Newar Kaulas have replaced her with Hatakesvari who, along with her consort Hiitakdvara, governs the hell worlds. This change is in consonance with the expurgation by Newar Kaulas of Buddhist influences in their rites. 124 Referring to the symbolism of the formation of the letter AI, Abhinavagupta says that the letter E is represented by the triangle of the goddess's Vulva, which is \"beautiful with the fragrance of emission\" (visargiimodasundaram -TA 3/95a). Then: When the powers of the absolute (the letter A) and bliss (the letter A) become firmly established there (in the triangle, which is the letter E), it assumes the condition of the six-spoked (mar:tflala�aflavasthiti, i.e. AI) brought about by the union of two triangles. (TA 3/95b-6a) Jayaratha comments that \"in the process of the practice of ritual sex (caryiikrama) the condition corresponding to the Gesture of the Six Spokes (�aflaramudrii) arises by the encapsulation of the two triangles, (one being that of the) male adept"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"56 THE CULT OF THE GODDESS KUBIIKA Newar initiates are also aware of this symbolism and openly accept it. When questioned about this, one explained that this is the reason why Newars in general, and Kaula initiates in particular, prefer the householder life. Celibate renouncers cannot perform all the rituals. What such statements mean and imply exactly is never made explicit by any of the people I have interviewed. So the reader must be content, as I have to be, to wonder. Just as this six-sided figure represents the six lineages, it is also commonly found in the mru:t<;lala of the lineage goddesses, technically called the Kramamar.u ;lala. This is the case with the Kramamat:u;lala of the Western Tradition (p ascimiimniiya), which the Kubjika Tantras describe as \"the city of the illumined intellect (dhf) \"125 because it is the embodiment of the teachings of the lineage (krama) of teachers who transmit the tradition (krama) and because its constituent elements, represented by mantras, are worshipped in a fixed sequence (krama) which constitutes the liturgy -Krama. There are twenty-eight such constituents and so the rite of adoration (pujiikrama) of this mru:t<;lala is called the Sequence of Twenty-Eight (a�tavimsatikrama). These twenty-eight constituents are represented by mantras arranged in six groups consisting of four, five, six, four, five, and four parts, respectively. They are projected onto the comers of the six-sided figure. According to one interpretation (see KuKh 2/8), they are as follows: 1) The Group of Four: the intellect along with the energies of will, knowledge and action. 2) The Group of Five: the five types of sensation, namely sound, form, taste, smell, and touch. 3) The Group of Six: the five senses, namely the ear, eye, tongue, nose, skin, and the mind. 4) The Group of Four: the four states, namely waking, dreaming, deep sleep and the Fourth. 5) The Group of Five: the group of five gross elements - water, fire, earth, wind and space. 6) The Group of Four: the three qualities of Nature, namely sattva, rajas and tamas, along with Siva, their master. (siddha) and (the other that of the) yogini.\" The sides of these triangles are formed from the three channels of the vital breath (i{la, piligala and SU$umna) that come together in the genital region of each of the two partners engaged in this rite. The vital breath is impelled along these three channels by the energies of will, knowledge and action. When these extroverted energies are experienced in conjunction with the inner energies of the absolute and its bliss, as happens for a moment, at least, in sexual intercourse, the three energies and corresponding vital breaths of the partners work together to generate the emission (visarga) through which the fecund seed of the couple is projected with force through the centre. 125 yad etat kaulikarhjfiii narh kramamar.z4aladhfpuram I (KuKh 5/lab)"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"MARKS. G. DYCZKOWSKI 57 According to contemporary Newar ritual procedure, the two superimposed triangles are surrounded by an eight-petalleq lotus. Eight mother goddesses (miitrkii) are worshipped on the petals. They guard the directions and the divine couple in the centre. Outside this eight-petalled lotus is a sixteen-petalled lotus. The deities worshipped here are the eight mother goddesses again, but this time along with their consorts,· the eight Bhairavas, who are worshipped next to them. The coupling that takes place in the centre between Kubjika and her Bhairava is thus reflected in this encompassing circle which completes the periphery · of the core of the mal)<;lala energized by these couplings. This is then enclosed in the final outer circle consisting of a thirty-two-petalled lotus on the petals of which are worshipped the thirty-two goddesses who are the energies of the thirty-two syllables of Kubjika's mantra. The foundation of each sophisticated Tantric system, such as this one, is the mal)<;lala it describes. 126 It is through it that the rite of adoration of the principal deity or couple, which is in the centre of the mal)<;lala, takes place. Accordingly, we find that the six groups which are the vital core oft:he goddess's mal)<;lala recur repeatedly in the Kubjika Tantras, usually with some further reflection or addition drawing, as it were, more each time from the configuration of energies. The components of the mal)<;iala are worshipped systematically, part by part, each with its own group of mantras. The deployment of energies in space is thus parallel to their deployment in time. Both of these are held together by their sequence (krama) in time and space.127 There are three such sequences. They are the Sequence of the Child, the Youth (also called the Middle One) and the Eldest. They are also called the Sequences of the Individual Soul (ii�ava), Energy (siikta) and Siva (siimbhava).128 Kubjika is the 126 The core of a Tantric system of the early period consists of the extensive description of the mai:t�ala of its main deity and .the rites associated with it. Certainly, such Tantric systems include numerous other rituals and practices; nonetheless the system proper essentially consists of this. The many other matters that are not directly associated with the worship of the main maQ.�ala or one of its forms are accretions, additions, and appendages that may well be extensive and even significant, but th�y are not essential to the system. By this I mean that the basic system remains intact even if they were to be absent. 127 Abhinavagupta explains in his brilliantly profound manner: The extending process of diversification and development (kalanii) along the path (of the cosmic order) takes place in two ways, namely in a sequential and in a non-successive manner. Succession (krama) and its absence essentially amount to (the two ways in which fo rms are manifest) in the field of phenomenal existence. Thus this can take place either through the differentiated development of single units ( ekakalanii, as happens, fo r example, in making the transition from cause to effect) or (simultaneously of a number of units, as happens when viewing) a picture. (T A 6/6) We may note in passing that Abhinavagupta is indebted for these concepts not to any Tantric tradition but to Bhartrhari, the philosopher of grammar, for this important exegesis of the Kaula term krama (meaning literally 'sequence' or 'succession'). 128 Nobody who has studied the Trika Tantrism elaborated by Abhinavagupta can fail to notice that these three sequences bear the names of the three major categories into which Abhinavagupta,"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"58 THE CULT OF THE GODDESS KUBJIKA goddess of these sequences (kramadevl), and she manifests as and through them in the form of their mantras. This identity is acted out symbolically by the worship of a fourth sequence, which is conceived as containing the other .three, namely the Sequence of the Female Skyfarer (khecarfkrama). The energies of these sequences of mantras are further reinforced and applied in the ritual by equating the six parts of the maQ.<;iala with the goddess's six limbs and her six faces. These are worshipped in all three sequences. In this way the goddess is worshipped as all that exists both externally, in the outside world, and internally within the body. The latter aspect is represented in various ways. For example, the six parts of the maQ.<;iala represent six configurations of the phonemic energies that constitute speech and mantras present in the body of the goddess and of each person. These are the standard Six Wheels (.�atcakra) of what is nowadays commonly known as KuQ.<;ialini Yoga. This is a very important part of the ritual and cosmology of this tradition since the goddess Kubjika is essentially, is not just secondarily, identified with KuQ.<;ialini.129 Thus the texts take great pains to describe these Six Wheels. inspired by his Trika teacher Sambhunatha, has classified practice both ritual and yogic (which one could say is roughly equivalent, as Abhinavagupta presents it, to what may be called mysticism). It appears that these terms were originally used in the Tantras to denote phases in the liturgies of some of the rituals they taught, as is the case with the Kubjika Tantras. Once again one is struck by the extensive use Abhinavagupta has made of the language of ritual to talk about mysticism, that is, experience of the sacred, and to formulate philosophical and theological concepts. Indeed, he is so adept at speaking the language of ritual for such purposes that one is apt to forget that a work such as the Ta ntriiloka. is, despite its extremely rich philosophy and mystical soteriology, structured in the form of a liturgical work (paddhati). Indeed, Abhinavagupta himself tells us�ht at the beginning of his Ta ntriiloka. that it is a work not of philosophy or a treatise on Yoga but a work concerning ritual: santi paddhatayas citrii/:1 srbtobhede�u bhuyasii I anuttara�af[ardhiirthakrame tv ekiipi ne�yate II ity aharh bahusa}:! sadbhi/:1 si$)Jasabrahmaciiribhi/:ll arthito racaye spa�{tirh purr.zjirthiirh prakriyiim imam II Various are the liturgical manuals (paddhati) in use in the many diverse traditions.

(TA 1114-5) The term prakriyii may, in some contexts, mean a 'literary work' but here I take it to mean 'liturgy'. This usage coincides with that found in the expressions tantraprakriyii and kulaprakriyii. We are told by Jayaratha, the commentator on the Tantriiloka., that the rituals and practices in the Tantriiloka. belong to these two types, namely Tantric ritual and Kaula ritual. The former is centered on the god, Bhairava or Siva, and the latter on the goddess or goddesses. 129 All the major Kaula goddesses are identified with KuQ.Qalini. The goddess Kubjika differs from other Kaula goddesses in that she is not KuQ.Qalini merely by ascription. Much of her"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"MARKS. G. DYCZKOWSKI 59 This Yoga can be practiced for realization coupled with worldly enjoyment. This is termed anugraha ('grace'). It can also be practised to accomplish magical acts designed to control and harm others. This is a form of 'worldly benefit' (bhoga) called nigraha ('restraint').130 The texts warn that this should be practised only when the intended victims have seriously transgressed the rule (samaya) of the tradition. Each wheel generates and sustains one or more of the components of the body, the flesh, fat, bone, marrow and so on. Each of these components are governed by one of Kubjildi's attendants who are the mistresses (niiyikii) of each wheel. Called yoginis, these are demonic goddesses or witches who can be invoked to perform magic rites. Thus, each one of the six wheels can correspond to one of the standard six magic rites (�atkarma). A practice is recorded for each one according to the magic rite one wishes to perform. A separate vidya131 and mal).<:fala (also called yantra) is prescribed for each one. Even so, they are all linked to one of the three varieties of Kubjika's Thirty-Two syllabled mantra known as Vajrakubji. In this way, a link is maintained with the supreme goddess who is identified with KuiJ.<:falini as the energy of the vital breath and speech. Another important aspect of the deployment of the goddess's power in time and space is the transmission of her empowering Command (i,ijfiii) through initiation. The temporal sequence (krama) in this case is the lineage of the transmission. This is the goddess's family (kula, anvaya, santati) which belongs to her clan (gotra) and house (grh�).132 Thus the residence, place of initiation and preaching of the teachers mythology, iconography and ritual is moulded primarily around her personage, metaphysical identity and activity as Km:tc,lalini. It is not an extra feature of her nature which has been added on to the others from the outside, but is part of the very essence of her very specific iconic form and nature. Moreover, as Sanderson (1988: 687) points out: \"The system of six power-centres (cakras) is also characteristic of the yogic rituals of the Kubjikiimatatantra. Later it became so universal, being disseminated as part of the system of kul}{lalinfyoga beyond the boundaries of the Tantric cults, that it has been forgotten in India (and not noticed outside it) that it is quite absent in all the Tantric traditions except this one and the cult of the goddess Tripurasundari.\" It appears, moreover, that the cult of Tripura borrowed this from that of Kubjika. Evidence for this is the addition in the Tripura cult of what are clearly three extra subsidiary centres to make nine. This is because the mai).c,iala of Tripura is made of nine enclosures (iivara�Ja). Kubjika's mru:tc,lala, as we have seen, is made of six parts (prakiira) to which the six centres correspond without need of accommodation. 130 nigrahiinugrahe saktir bhavate tava niscayam I martyaloke vrajitvii tu kuru krtr;/iirh yathecchayii II It is sure that yours is the power to assist (anugraha) and to obstruct (nigraha). Once gone to the mortal world, play as you will. (KuKh 5/54) 131 Just as the male mantra embodies a god in sound form, similarly the female Vidya embodies a goddess. 132 This is a common analogy found in various forms and more or less emphasized in all Tantric traditions. Indeed it reaches back into Vedic times. The analogy became concrete fact in the not uncommon case of the Brahmin father who acted as the tutor and spiritual preceptor of his son."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"60 THE CULT OF THE GODDESS KUBJIKA in the goddess's family should all be recollected along with each teacher. The goddess gives rise in this way to the sequence which is her external manifest form. The sequence (krama) of the rite and the sequence of the lineage would not be complete without it. Accordingly, the texts prescribe that the MaQ.c;lala of the Teachers (gurumat:u;/.ala) should be drawn along with the MaQ.c;lala of Samvarta (that is, the kramamwu;Iala of this school described above), but worshipped before it. Accordingly, Newar Kaulas worship the teachers of their lineage along with the legendary founders of the cult of their lineage goddess in a maQ.c;lala that is drawn specially for this purpose as part of the preliminaries of the more elaborate rites of adoration (kramarcana).133 The worship of the lineage of teachers and sacred places transposed onto the body through the ritual of deposition (nyasa) is basic, common practice in all major Kaula schools. Thus in Abhinavagupta's presentation of Kaula ritual the worship of the maQ.c;lala with these components is an essential preliminary to ritual union with the Tantric consort. He writes: Kula is the wheel ( cakra) which consists of mantras, the (accomplished adepts and teachers of the tradition known as) Siddhas, the vital breath, (embodied) consciousness and the senses. The powerful (universal) consciousness which resides within it is here called Kulesvarf. She must be worshipped in the centre . .. either alone ( ekavfra) or together with her Lord. 134 In this context, the Brhadiira7J.yaka Upani�ad envisages the transfer of spiritual knowledge literally as a transfer of vital force from father to son at the moment of the father's death: When a fa ther thinks that he is going to die, he says to his son, \"You are Brahman, you are the sacrifice, you are the world.\" [ ... ] When a fa ther who knows this leaves this world, he penetrates his son together with speech, the mind and the vital fo rce. [ ... ] The fa ther remains in this world through the son alone. The divine and immortal organ of speech, mind and vital fo rce pervade him. (115/17; English translation drawn from The Brhadiira7J.yaka Upani�ad, Mylapore: Sri Ramakrishna I Math, 1979). Finding support from such traditions in the Brahrninical worldview, the Newars have understood the Tantric analogy between a spiritual lineage and familial one literally. 133 Vajraciiryas, the Newar Buddhist Tantric priests, do the same. Locke informs us that: \"The Guru MlU.lQala rite is a ritual performed at the beginning of every pujii performed by a Vajraciirya. The maiJ{iala in question is the Mt. Meru maiJ{iala which is offered to the gurus i.e. the Buddha, the Dharma, the Sangha and Vajrasattva.\" For a detailed account of this rite see Locke 1980: 81-95 from where this reference is drawn. 134 mantrasiddhaprii�J.QsamvitkaralJ.iitmani yii kule II cakriitmake citi/;l prabhvl proktii seha kulesvaril sii madhye ... pujyii . . .

As this syllable, Kubjika is identified in one of her forms with the goddess Para. She is thus linked to both conceptions, without coinciding exactly with either. But note that although she is frequently identified with the goddess Para she differs, in this context, from the Para Vidya of the Trika which is SAUI:I.136 AIM is one of the most important seed syllables in the mantric system of the Kubjika cult. It precedes most of the mantras and Vidyas of this school. Indeed, it is an important seed syllable for all the Kaula traditions prevelant in Nepal. Thus the Newars regularly place it in the centre of the mal)<:falas they make to house their lineage goddesses. Moreover, it is the fi rst of an important group of five seed syllables called the 'Five Brahmas (paiicabrahma)' or 'Five Instruments (paiicakara�Ja)'.

This seed syllable, or variants of the same, were known to Kashmiri Saivites from the Svacchandatantra and other sources.138 It has two forms in the cults of both Kubjika and Srividya: one is HSKSML VRYOM, which is related to the male aspect.

The Goddess of Fire Now we have dealt with some of the creative aspects of the goddess Kubjika, we should refer to the other, destructive ones. As we have noted already, while Kall destroys as she creates, Kubjika creates as she destroys. This is expressed symbolically by equating her with the all comsuming fire that bums up the universe at the end of each aeon, namely the Fire of Time (kiiliigni), here called Sarhvarta (the 'Fire of the Aeons') or Va<;lavagni (lit. 'The Fire from the Mare's (Mouth)'). According to the Purfu).as, this fire bums at the bottom of the ocean. The water it causes to evaporate falls as life-giving rain.

As the fire which bums at the end of a cosmic age and consumes all the worlds, it remains hidden in the darkness of the Void produced thereby.

He incorporates it into his own Trika system presenting it, as he usually does, with a sophisticated interpretation based on a phenomenology of universal divine consciousness acting in and through each act of perception: Th is path is worthy of being described in this way because the yogi quickly (driik) attains Bhairava's nature, contemplating the sequence of its configuration (prakriyiikrama) (contained in the initial impulse towards perception) as is explained in the Sp anda teaching. Experiencing a!l the (cosmic) path (in this way, the yogi) should dissolve it into the deities (who preside over it). They are (then merged), as before, progressively into the wheel of the body, vital breath and intellect. (Finally) all this (merges) collectively into his own consciousness. This consciousness that is fu ll of all things and is continuously worshipped (and practiced) is (like) the fire of universal destruction (which dries up) the ocean of transmigration.

In this process the goddess herself is as if transformed. Both these themes, namely the transformation of the goddess and her association with the Vedic sacrifice are explicit in one of the rare myths of this Kaula tradition. This myth is yet another of very many versions scattered throughout the sacred texts of India of the story of Dak:�a's sacrifice.142 The common nucleus of the story is simple. A Brahmin named Dak:�a sponsored a great Vedic sacrifice to which he invited all the gods except Siva of whom he disapproved even though, indeed because, he was the beloved husband of his favourite daughter, Uma. The angered god was sorely offended and, much angered, destroyed the sacrifice. Thus to Dak:�a accrued the demerit of failing to complete it. A Kubjika Tantra goes on to add its own slant to the story: When the goddess came to know of what had occurred, (she said): ,;My fa ther Dak�a's sacrifice has been destroyed by me because (its destruction was) due to me. I am the sinner (and so) will purify myself! \" She stoked the Supreme Fire, brilliant with waves of raging flames. She contemplated it burning fi ercely fr om the middle of the Mar_ujala of Oesture (mudriimaiJ�ala). She then assumed the adamantine posture and recalled to mind the energy of Aghoresvarf. She burnt herself with the Fire of Time and became (like) a smokeless, burning coal. (This) wise woman, dead and reduced to ashes, left the mortal world. 143 The goddess was then born to Himavan, the god of the Himalaya range, as Bhadrak:alika.144 Siva, recognizing her voice as that of his wife Uma, again sought and obtained her hand in marriage. Thus he united with her once more and all the polarities of existence were reunited. The multiplicity of all things fused back into their complimentary opposite pole, the one transcendent Being which is their original 142 The myth of the destruction of Dak�a's sacrifice occurs for the first time in the �gveda (115115-7). It is retold in the AitareyabriihmaiJll (13/9-10) and in the SatapathabriihmaiJll (117/3/l-4).

There he will fuse with the Supreme Goddess (Para) who, in her fierce aspect, is the Transmental (manonmanl), the energy which is the light of consciousness145 described in the following passage: Horrific (ghorti), she burns without smoke, (like) the flame on the wick of a lamp. Shining like countless millions of Rudras, she is Rudra 's energy, and is both supreme (transcendent) and inferior (immanent). (This) energy is the Drop (hindu) which is the deluge (of energy that flows) right up to the earth and contains millions of millions of Rudras. Its radiant power (tejas) is the Supreme Energy, Rudra's energy, the Great Goddess. 146 The Lunar Goddess Along with her associations with the cosmic fire, Kubjika, like Kali, Tripura and, indeed, many other goddesses, has extensive lunar associations. The moon alternates progressively between light and darkness·. It both bestows and withdraws its light. Similarly the lunar goddess shines darkly as it were. Kali, who as her name tells us with its double meaning, is both Lady Time and the Black Lady, is in apparently paradoxical manner described as radiant light (bhasa). Kubjika also possesses these two aspects. In her case however, although she is also sometimes said to be dark blue (syama) or dark blue and red (syamaru!J-a), her brightness, rather than darkness, is more frequently emphasized in the forms, myths and sacred geography associated with her. Thus, for example, she is said to reside on the Island of the Moon in the form of a lunar stone in the centre of the island symbolizing the lunar drop (hindu). Her lunar whiteness is associated with the fertilizing sperm. Her lunar power and ambigiously plural sexual nature combine, and so she is called Sukra - Female Sperm. She lives on the triple peak of the Mountain of the Moon which is identified with Meru, the mountain at the centre of the world. Her abode is the City of the Moon and her house is the House of the Moon, where perfected yogis and yoginis reside.

It is a secret inner world - the land of the mai)Qala. Set in sacred space and sacred time, the sacred house of the tradition is thought to be regenerated in and through each cosmic age. The present is a summation of the past; it is its completion. Time and space work together in the continuity of the lineage, the family and its descendants (santiina). To enter the secret, sacred places one must be a part of this process. One must be born from it, sustained by it, and ultimately merge into it. The 'process' (krama) in this case is the sequence of the phases of the incer moon. As Eliade (1974: 155) notes: The sun is always the same, always itself, never in any sense \"becoming\". The moon, on the other hand, is a body which waxes, wanes and disappears, a body whose existence is subject to the universal law of becoming, of birth and death. The moon, like man, has a career involving tragedy, for its failing, like man's, ends in death. For three nights the starry sky is without a moon. But this \"death\" is followed by a rebirth: the new moon. The moon's going out, in \"death\", is never final. One Babylonian hymn to Sin sees the moon as \"a fruit growing from itself'. It is reborn of its own substance, in pursuance of its own destined career. This perpetual return to its beginnings, and this ever-recurring cycle make the moon the heavenly body above all others concerned with the rhythms of life. In the body, the \"rhythms oflife\" are most clearly apparent in the movement of the vital breath, and it is in this movement that the goddess's lunar nature is most clearly perceived. In this context, Kubjika, the energy of consciousness (citkalii), has two aspects. One is the energy of plenitude - the Full Moon (pun;ii). The other is the energy of emptiness- the New Moon (amii): I praise (the goddess) called the Full (Moon) who resides at the end of the sixteen (digits of the moon) in the bright fo rtnight, whose fo rm is (spherical/ike) that of a bud of the Kadamba tree, 147 and nature that of nectar. I praise the goddess New Moon (amii) who resides in the centre (of the sp here of the Full Moon), she who is the lioness of the nectar of union (utsangiimrtakesarf), the original fo rm (bimba) of (the goddess) Kiilikii, and beautiful by virtue of her moonlight fo rm ( candrikiikiira). 148 147 148 See the next section for Kubjika's association with trees and vegetation. lwdambagolakiikiiriim �Ofjasiinte vyavasthitiim II suklapalcye tv aham vande pun;liikhyiimrtarupi!J.fm I tanmadhye kiilikiibimbam utsmigiimrtakesarfm II"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"MARKS. G. DYCZKOWSKI 67 The New149 and the Full Moon are the two extremities of the movement of vitality. The fullness empties out until, exhausted,. it reverts to its original potential condition which is the source of all energies. The light turns to darkness and the darkness turns to light as Kubjika reveals her dark aspect and Kaii reveals her radiance. This cosmic cycle is repeated in the movement of the breath. When it takes place mindfully, in the manner about to be described, breathing becomes the epitome of time. Its ceaseless recurrence, which is life itself, mirrors within the creation and destruction of the world, replicating thus internally the fire sacrifice (the performance of which is coordinated with the phases of the moon) through which the world is created and which marks its end. Accordingly, the Kubjika Tantras, mindful of the importance of this process, teach several versions of it, one of which should be visualized in the following manner. The first stage engages the energy of the New Moon. It is the dark phase of progressive merger. The adept should sit and direct his attention down to the genital centre where he should visualize the rotating Wheel of Birth (janmacakra). In the middle of that moving wheel, the Wheel of the Drop rotates in an anticlockwise direction, the reverse of the original pure condition. Within that is the supreme energy of consciousness, Kubjika, the Transmental (manonmanl). By contracting the anus, inhaling and then retaining the breath, this energy is raised up with, and through, the flow of vitality that travels up the central channel of vitality in the body called Su�umna. 150 Like a whirling wheel of fire, it enters first the navel and then the 149 devlrh amiim aharh vande candrikiikiirarupi1Jim I (KuKh 3/12lcd-3ab) Abhinava writes about this energy: Nectar ( amrta) in the fo rm of the moon is divided into sixteen, then again into two. The other fifteen digits are drunk by all the gods. The energy of the New Moon (amii) hidden in the cave (of the Heart), is the remnant which fills and satisfies the universe. The fif teen digits of the moon empty themselves out in this way way one after the other. But this is not the case with the empty sixteenth (digit), which nourishes as does water and nectar. (TA 6/95-7) It is worth noting that Abhinavagupta in his extensive survey of the Tantras refers only to the energy of the new moon as the source of the other lunar energies. Perhaps the symbolic combination the two, namely, the emptiness of the new moon and the plenitude of the full moon is a connection that is made only in the Kubjika Tantras. It is certainly not common, even though the symbolism of the energy of the New Moon (amiikalii) is well known to many Tantric traditions and both new moon and full moon are usually considered to be particularly important times in Indian liturgical calendars. 150 In the Upani�ads this upward movement is described as one of the ways in which the vital breath can exit the body when a person dies. It is the best way, the only one which leads to immortality. The others lead to various forms of rebirth. The Chiindogyopa1Ji�ad quotes an earlier authority as saying: There are a hundred and one channels of the heart. One of these passes up to the crown of the head. Going up by it, one goes to immortality."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"68 THE CULT OF THE GODDESS KUBnKA heart. Its movement beyond this station of expansion marks its progressive depletion as it assumes increasingly subtle forms of sound (niida). Finally at the climax of its ascent, it merges into the primary energy (iidyasakti) of the sphere of Siva's transcendental being (siimbhavamar:u;lala). Thus, through this process, the residual traces of past action are burnt away. Then follows the second phase, which involves the energy of the Full Moon. Just as the energy of the New Moon was elevated from below, this energy is 'elevated' from above. The Ta ntra of the Churning Bhairava describes this process as follows: (The adept) should elevate (the goddess) in the fo rm of semen (retas) fr om the middle of the Drop, the Upper Place. Th e same (energy) that had previously waned away (now) rains down the nectar of the Full Moon (p un;iimrta). (The adept) should contemplate that crooked energy. Endless and tranquil (saumyarupii), is (the goddess) Cificinf (i.e. Kubjikii) who is the Supreme Power and the emanation ( sr�ti) (that occurs when) the withdrawal (of phenomenal existence) takes place. (In this state this energy is round and white) like a drop of milk. (Contemplating it in this fo rm, the yogi) should lead it up to the end of the Nameless The others are fo r departing in various directions. (81616. This same stanza recurs in Kathopa1J.i$ad 6/16. See also Ta itterfyopa1J.i$ad 116 and Prasnopa1J.i$ad 317,) Su�umna is mentioned by name, perhaps for the first time, in the following interesting passage in the Ma itryupa1J.i$ad. This is one of the earliest references to the Yogic process of leading the breath upwards through this channel: Now it has elsewhere been said: \"There is a channel called the·Sushumna, leading up wards conveying the breath, piercing through the palate. Through it, by joining (yuj) the breath, the syllable OM, and the mind, one may go aloft. By causing the tip of the tongue to turn back against the palate and by binding together (sarhyojya) the senses, one may, as greatness, perceive greatness.\" Thence he goes to selflessness. Because of selflessness, one becomes a non-exp eriencer of pleasure and pain; he obtains the absolute unity (kevalatva). For thus it has been said: After having first caused to stand still The breath that has been retained, then, Having crossed beyond the limited, with the unlimited One may at last have union in the head. (Maitryupa1J.i$ad 6/21. Both these passages are Hume's translations) According to later descriptions of this process, the breath rises, taking the heat of the body up along with it (as happens when a person dies), in such a way that the central channel feels warm. Thus, su$ma-lit. She Who is Pleasingly Warm- the alternative name for this channel, occasionally found in the early Kaula Tantras, gives us a clue to the meaning of the word SU$UmnQ as perceived by Kaula Tantrics."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"MARKS. G. DYCZKOWSKI 69 ( aniimiinte ). Th en the consecration takes place by means of that same deity in its original fo rm. Once (the adept) has thus contemplated (this energy), brilliant as the full (moon), in the Wheel of the Heart, the place of the Full (Moon), he should induce (her) to enter her own Wheel by means of the mind ( citta). She who is praised (by all) and is supreme bliss, laughingly melts (dravate). She is the Na meless (aniimii), the energy which is consciousness (who resides) in the sp here of the Nameless (aniimamalJ.{iala). (Thus the yogi experiences) the contentment (trpti) of the night of the Full Moon, which arises in this way laden with nectar. Th is is the consecration of the Command, the entry (iigama) (of the breath that takes place) in the phase of emanation. Once he has purified (himself) by (this process of) entry and exit (gamiigama), (the adept) should worship the Sequence (kramiircana). 151 Such yogic visualizations of the movement of the vital breath are an important part of the Kubjika cult taught in the Kubjika Tantras, where they are numerous and strikingly sophisticated, as is this example. Even so, Newar initiates do not generally undertake such complex visualizations, although the Tantras prescribe them, as in this example, as part of the preliminary purifications that precede the regular Kaula rites (kramiircana). I have been informed, however,. that Taleju Rajopadhyayas do do so when they perform an extensive form of deposition of mantras on the body called brhadnyiisa (lit. 'Great Deposition'). As I have not had access to the liturgy that prescribes this deposition, I cannot supply precise details at present. Even so, it is clear that such elevated and internal practices are virtually the exclusive domain of only the most privileged N�war Brahmins. The reason these Brahmins advance for this is that they alone have access to the most powerful divine forms and rituals, and so need to prepare and protect themselves in additional ways not necessary for the average initiate for whom the usual, more external, ritual procedures are sufficient. 151 iirdhvasthiiniid bindumadhyiid retorupiim samuddharet I upa�fr.Ui tu yii purvam sii purf.llimrtavar#r.zf II vakrasaktir anantiitmii saumyarupii vicintayet I samhiirasyiigame sr�tis ciiicir.zf paramii kalii II iinayec ca aniimiinte tu �frakar.zikopamii I tato 'bhi�ekas tenaiva priiksvaruper.za devatii II hrccakre purr.zasamsthiine purr.zacandrasamaprabhii I evam samcintya cittena svacakre tu pravesayet II prahasantr pariinandii dravate siibhinanditii I citsvarupiitmikii saktir aniimiiniimama'.l{fale II teniimrtabharii trptil;z paurr.zamiisf pravartate I iigamam sr�tibhedena etad iijiiiibhi�ecanam II gamiigamena samsodhya pasciit kuryiit kramiircanam I (KuKh 13/134-140ab)"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"70 THE CULT OF THE GODDESS KUBflKA But to an outside observer the fe eling is irresistible that here we have yet another example of how these Brahmins have attempted to safeguard their spiritual and, hence, worldly preroga�1ves. Moreover, such manipulations of the original Tantric traditions in their favour along with the uniformly central position given to this one g9ddess, Kubjika, who is their lineage deity, suggests that it was such people who set up the complex system we find today and that has been operating for several centuries. 152 That major changes were brought about that greatly favoured them cannot be doubted. According to the legends in the Kubjika Tantras, and indeed Tantras of this sort in general, the founding figures were renouncers, not householders. The legends describe them as living a peripatetic lifestyle, wandering from one sacred place to another, and encountering in these 'meeting grounds' (meliipasthiina) other accomplisheo adepts (siddha) and yoginis. At times they would interrupt their pilgrimage to live in caves or under trees where, as the Tantras tell us, they would sit with their 'gaze averted upwards' until they were granted a visions of the goddess. This is a far cry indeed from the householder life of the Brahmin guru, his Kshatriya Karmacarya assistants and high-caste initiates! 153 The Tree Goddess The root Tantra of the Kubjika school, the Kubjikiimata, does refer to the goddess's assocation with trees, but in the later texts this association is extensively explored. The early Upani�ads had already compared the body of a man to a tree with its root the Brahman.154 Similarly, the maQc;lala of the goddess is the tree within 152 One of the aims of the preseAt on-going research is to discover how far back this system has been operating and how it evolved. A more extensive examination of Newar Tantric liturgical works, especially early ones, will hopefully supply us with new data and shed light on the matter. 153 Dumont writes: \" ... the secret of Hinduism may be found in the dialogue between the renouncer and the man-in-the-world ... In fact the man-in-the-world, and particularly the Brahman, is given the credit for the ideas which he may have adopted but not invented. Such ideas are much more relevant and they clearly belong to the thought of the renouncer. Is it really too adventurous to say that the agent of development in Indian religion and speculation, the 'creator of values' has been the renouncer? The Brahman as a scholar has mainly preserved, aggregated, and combined; he may well have created and developed special branches of knowledge. Not only the founding of sects and their maintenance, but the major ideas, the 'inventions' are due to the renouncer whose unique position gave him a sort of monopoly for putting everything in question.\" (Dumont 1980: 270, 275 quoted by Quigley 1993: 56) 154 The Brhadara1}yakopani�ad declares: As a tree of the fo rest, just so, surely, is man.

The whole tradition and its teachings are represented as the Tree of Consciousness which grows out of the Divine Current (divyogha) of the Divine Kaula tradition. This Tree is supreme bliss, its best fruit is the tradition of the Siddhas (siddhaugha) and its branches include the places that are deposited in the body, the aggregate of letters, the Rudras, Siddhas, the various types of sacred places, the divine cave, the Abyss, the Sky, and the Skyf�rer (khecara), each of which is divided into millions of aspects.155 This tree is especially represented as a tamarind (cifica) that grows on the Island of the Moon, the goddess's mal)c;lala, from the middle Of the triangle. Thus, in the later Kubjika Tantras, where this imagery is elaborated, the goddess is frequently called the Lady of the Tamarind (Cificii)I or Cifica).156 Under the shade of this ·tree, which is said to be the pure bliss present within all beings, 157 one attains the supreme liberating repose beyond pleasure and pain.158 One of the founders of the Kubjika cult was called Vrk�anatha ('the Lord of the Tree') because he achieved the perfect repose (visriima) of liberation under this tree when the goddess appeared to him. There, in the shade of the tree, she transmitted the enlightening Command (iijfiii) which gave him the authority (adhikiira) that empowered him both to attain this realization and to transmit the teachings which lead others to it. Another tree closely associated with Kubjika is the Kadamba tree. At times it is this tree, rather than the tamarind, that symbolizes the tradition and its growth from pieces of flesh are under-layers of wood. The fibre is muscle-like strong.

Kr�Q.a declares in the Bhagavadg'ftii that he is the asvattha with its roots in heaven and its branches here below. Similarly, the maQ.c.lala empowered with mantra and the goddess's energy, is the kadamba tree which, blazing with energy, emits its rays of mantric power down into the phenomenal world.160 But she is not only the source of this tree, she is also born from it. _ She is the bud of the kadamba flower. In this form she has engulfed into herself (kadambzkrta) all the energies of the maQ.c.lala and the cosmic order that it represents. Thus she contains every potential for growth and unfoldment. When the flower blossoms, she is its radiant energy which, led to the he� (the centre of one's being where the Self resides), completes the cycle.

Conclusion There are numerous other symbols associated with the goddess Kubjika. They, like the rituals, sacred geographies, mantras, fo rms of Yoga (especially those linked with the movement of the vital breath) described in her Tantras, are surprisingly rich. The texts have developed in a highly creative period of the history of Tantrism and contain numerous traces of its development. All this would be more than enough to warrant extensive research of this goddess. But there is more. The application of precept to practice is in the case of this virtually unknown goddess also surprisingly extensive.

This painting by JiHinakara Vajracarya is. based on the visualized form of the goddess Kubjika described in the Pascimajye$(hiimniiyakarmiircanapaddhati. This typical Newar liturgy represents the goddess in a form in which Newar initiates commonly visualize her. I have chosen this source accordingly. There are several variants, especially in the attributes she holds, of the corresponding form described in the Kubjika Tantras. Seven variant visualizations are described in the Manthiinabhairavatantratfkii by Riipasiva (fol. 9ff.). Others are found in the KuKh 29/33ff. and 49/25cd ff., KnT (fol. lla ff .) and KRU 8/53 ff. In this case she holds in the right hands, from top to bottom, a trident, the mirror of Karma, a vajra, a goad, arrow and flat sacrificial knife. In the corresponding left hands she holds a severed head, ascetic's staff, bell, scriptures, a bow and a skull-bowl. She wears a lion and a tiger skin and a garland of human heads and is surrounded by a circle of stars ( tii riima!J¢ala). The paddhati says that she has a large belly and is bent (kubjiirupii). She is adorned with snakes. These fe atures are emphasized in several descriptions of this form in the Tantras as well. They indicate that she is the snake goddess, KuQ<;ialini. She is seated on a lotus that grows from the navel of Siva, who lies prone below her on a throne (sirhhiisana). According to the Kubjika Tantras, the navel is the. place where she rests in the form of a coiled snake and from where she rises. The image therefore represents the goddess as KuQ<;ialini emerging from the god as his divine will (icchiisakti). Another interesting feature is the yellow colour of the fr ont (purva) face. This is not the usual colour of this face according to the texts. A few learned Newar initiates affectionately refer to Kubjika in Newari as miisukval:z miiju -the Yellow Faced Mother. A large bronze mask representing this goddess is found in a temple close to that of Vajrayogini in the vicinity of the Sanku. The Newars associate the yellow colour of her face with Brahmai).I, the first of the eight Mothers (miitrkii).

Siddhilak�mi is in the middle. To her left is Smasanabhairava and on her right Mahak:ala. Bhaktapur is unique insofar as it boasts three Siddhilak�mi temples, all three oi which originally contained stone images of the goddess. They were built by three successive Malla kings, who ruled between the middle of the seventeenth century and the first quarter of the eighteenth. This was a period when many of the most beautiful and important temple� were built in all three of the cities of the Valley. The urge to build these temples by the Bhaktapur Mallas indicates a need to externalize the cult of their lineage deity to bring her. powerful, beneficial presence into the public civic space. This urge was part of an overall resurgence of Tantrism throughout the Valley that is visibly evident by the fl owering of the vast complex of iconic forms that adorn the temples of that period. This was also the time when the liturgies of Siddhilak�mi, the goddess Taleju, that still govern the form of her secret rituals nowadays, were redacted by the gurus of the Mallas, the Taleju Rajopadhyaya Brahmins. The first of these temples is in plain red brick with a tiled roof. It was built by Jagatprakasamalla who ruled between 1643 and 1672 and is situated next to the palace. It contained a stone statue of the goddess that is now missing. His son, Jitamitramalla who reigned between 1673 and 1696 built the second temple. This is situated next to the temple built by his fa ther (see plate 1). It is a small, gray stone\" sikhara type of temple decorated with multi-armed images of forms of the goddess Mahi�asuramardini. She is the public representation of all the secret lineage goddesses and, therefore, also of Siddhilak�mi. The image inside the temple is still in place. It is about one meter high and carved in black stone. The third temple is Nyatapola, famous as the tallest temple in the Valley; Bhupatindramalla, the son of Jitamitra, who ruled between 1696-1722, built it. According to a well-known story, Bhupatindramalla had a dream in which he saw the Bhairava who resides in the temple in Ta:marhi square on a destructive rampage. When he awoke, he felt the presence of his lineage goddess who told him to build a temple to her in order to control Bhairava. Bhairava is the god of the lower castes, especially fa rmers, who made up, and still do, the majority of the population. It is hard to resist the fe eling that in actual fact Bhupatindramalla was worried about unrest amongst his subjects whose growing influence was represented in his dream by the increased destructive power of their god. In a culture where magical Tantric action is fe lt to be more powerful than the outer use of force, Bhupatindramalla"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"76 THE CULT OF THE GODDESS KUBJIKA. accordingly built his temple on six high plinths with five pagoda roofs so as to tower above the Bhairava temple to one side of it in Ta:marhi square. Indeed, just the plinths are so high that the image of the goddess in the sanctum on the first story stands above its counterpart in the Bhairava temple. She is surrounded by small wooden carvings of the sixty-four yoginis that are placed at the head and in between the supporting wooden pillars around the outside of the sanctum to intensify her fe male energy and channel it to the outside. The iconography of the goddess further reinforces her dominance over the god. She stands on Bhairava who supports her with two of his four hands. He is KaHignirudra, the embodiment of the Fire of Time that consumes the worlds at the end of each cosmic cycle. In the bronze representation reproduced here (see plate 4 ), he looks up at the goddess and has two hands joined in an attitude of devotion. As Bhairava was the esoteric identity of the Malia kings, they were the intermediaries between the common people, who worshipped Bhairava, and the goddess who was the Malia's tutelary and hence that of the entire kingdom. The hierarchy of power is mirrored for the public to see in the increase by ten of the strength of the beings represented by pairs of statues positioned on both sides of the stairs, a pair for each plinth, leading up to the sanctum. It seems that Jagatjyoti and Jitamitra were more liberal than Bhiipatindra. The image in the temple built by the first of these three may well have been accessible to the public. Again, although the second temple is a closed one, parts of the image are visible through the wooden latticewol'k of the doors. As for Nyatapola, the third temple, it is carefully sealed off from all those who are not specially permitted to enter it. These are the Taleju Rajopadhyaya Brahmins and the Taleju Karmacaryas. The latter are the main priests of this temple who perform the daily obligatory rites. When more elaborate occasional rites require it, assistants aid them. One amongst them made a rough painting· of the images inside the temple. On the basis of this painting Jfianakara Vajracarya has made the ink drawing reproduced in plate 3, the first ever published of these images. All three images are carved in black stone and are finely polished. The main image in the center of Siddhilak�mi is over two meters high. As the doors of the sanctum are considerably smaller than this image, it must have been lowered into it before the ceiling was built. Siddhilak�mi has nine heads and eighteen arms.

She makes a fear dispelling gesture with the eighth hand and, along with the ninth left hand, holds a jar (kalasa).

From left to right of the god, they are a parrot, dog, crow and a fox. Plate 5: Siddhilak�mi This plate is by courtesy of the National Museum, New Delhi. The bronze is described in Dawson, J. E. 1999: 43 as \"Svacchanda Bhairavi. Utpala, lOth century A.D. Chamba, Himachal Pradesh. Bronze, 37.0 x 24.0 x 7.0 em. Ace. No. 64.102.\" Sanderson (1990: 63ff.) has established that this is actually an image of Siddhilak�mi. I have been informed that a similar image made of eight metals (a�fadhatu) is worshipped as the tutelary of the Malia kings in the chapel (agafi) of the royal palace in Bhaktapur. The goddess in the bronze reproduced here is seated on Kalagnirudra who supports her with two hands. His other two hands are joined at the palms in a gesture of prayer. Fire comes from his mouth as he looks up at the goddess in adoration who is looking at him. The goddess has five heads and ten arms. Her right hands hold, from top to bottom, a sword, a trident, a skull-staff and a skull-bowl. The fifth hand makes a fear dispelling gesture. In the corresponding left hands she holds a goad, a manuscript, a noose, makes a wish granting gesture and holds a hatchet. Plate 6: Guhyesvari This form of Guhyesvari, painted by Jfianakara Vajracarya, is described in the Gora�asamhita (14/159-167) where she appears as the embodiment of Kubjika's weapon (astradutl). Newar initiates worship this form as the most secret aspect of Guhyesvari. The text describes her as dark blue with a large, heavy body. She wears a black garment and a garland of skulls. She has five faces and ten arms. In the right"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"78 THE CULT OF THE GODDESS KUBJIKA hands she holds, from top to bottom, a trident, mace, noose, goad and sword.

Plate 7: Tripurasundari This painting by Jfianakara Vajracarya is a typical Newar representation of the goddess Tripurasundari. This form is closely related to the goddess Kamesvari. She sits on two layers of heads. The upper layer represents the gods of the five gross elements, called the Five Causes (paiicakaral}a). They are, from left to right Brahma, Vi�1,1u, Rudra, Isvara and Sadasiva. The lower set of heads represent the seven Mothers (miitrkii). These are, fr om left to right, Brahma1,1I, Kaumari, Vai�1,1avi, Varahi, IndraQI; Camu1,1ga and Mahalak�mi. Tripura is red, beautiful and well adorned. She has one head and four arms.
