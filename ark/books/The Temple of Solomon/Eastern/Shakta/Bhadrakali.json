From the time immemorial civilisations ofEgypt, Mesopotemia, Indus et al. Owe theircontributions to eternal flow of the riverswhich fulfill the basic necessities ofhuman life.The Salandi valleyculture at Bhadrak serves aglaring example in thiscontext. The flow ofSalandi and its tributarieshave played a major rolein enriching its tradition,culture and custom. Whenwe try to reconstruct theglorious cultural heritage ofthe district the very firstthing that strikes our mindis the name of GoddessMahakali from Meghasani(origin of the river Salandi)to Bhadrakali, thedaughter of Salandi -Presiding Deity of ther e g io n - Ma ha ma yaBhadrakali.From ancient time till today the place hasits own sanctity as one of the renownedshaktipithas of Orissa. Frequent references to thisShaktipitha are found in different religious textsas well as mythologies. The premier Deity Durgabeing born out of yagna fire has assumed the nameof Bhadrakali and has blessed the region. Thepresence of Sri Jagannath (the lastincarnation of Krishna) in the sameplatform marks the peaceful co-existence of the place.Shaktipuja or worship ofShakti occupies a verysignificant position in theancient Indian tradition.Though various opinionshave been put forward bythe historians, Indologists,archaeologists about theorigin of the cult, it is auniversally accepted fact thatshakti worship constitutes avery important aspect of ourreligion.As per μDevi-Sukta¶Devi Shakti representsherself through various waysthrough deaming andknowledge in the form of Saraswati, throughwealth in the form of Laxmi, through generalbenevolence in the form of Durga or throughviolence in the form of Kali."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Orissa Review September - 2009127Mahisamardini Durga, Khiching,circa 10th-11th Century A.D.μAkeiba Shakti ParamesvarasyaBibidha badanti vyavahara kaleBhoge tu Bhavani Purushesu LaxmiShakte tu Durga Pralaye tu KaliForm ancient scriptures as well asTantrasastra it is clearly evident that from 3rd-4th century A.D. to 12th Century A.D.Shaktipithas grew into prominence in variousparts of the Country. In the Tantric ritualisticdescriptions Orissa has been regarded as one ofthe important pithas.Odrakhyam Pratham PithaDwitiya Jala SailakamiTrutiya PurnapithastuKamarupam ChathurthakamDr. Harekrushna Mahtab rightly opinesthat out of the four important Shaktipithas -Odrakha, Srihatta, Pumakoti and Kamakshya -Odrakha or Odyamsa or Orissa is the first pitha.Among the famous Devipithas of Orissa mentionmay be made of Sarala of Jhankad, Cuttack Chandiof Cuttack, Bhagavati of Banpur, Kichakeswari ofKhiching, Charchika of Banki, Mangala ofKakatapur, Vimalapitha of Puri, Viraja of Jajpur,Samaleswari ofSambalpur andBhadrakali ofBhadrak. They areall one and thesame. They are theShaktis ofMahakala Siva.The image ofgoddessBhadrakali is madeof black chloritestone. It is aroundfour feet tall. She isfour-handed andsits on a lion. In theupper right hand she holds sword and in the upperleft hand there is Kharpara. A baby (whom thedevotees accept as Balgopal Krishna) is found inthe lower right hand along with a garland of beadsin the lower left hand. The hands, feet, shoulders,neck, nose, ears and head of the Deity areornamentally carved. On both sides of mother, thereare the images of Jaya and Vijaya. The five godsof Hindu tradition such as Ganesh, Vishnu,Bhaskar(Sun), Siva and Durga are also enshrinedhere. The mythological description of the Deitygoes as follo ws :Srikali Bhadrakali danavadalini kesariPrusthasamstha,Srikrushnaka Santarupa nikhila Vayaharaniradava trinetraBakhoyordhe khadga bamechaKharparadhara Anaya bhaktavatsalaVaishnavi Vishnu maya bhabatu varada patu mamBhadrakaliMother Bhadrakali is a quite ancientmythological deity.

From Sangatgurudwar of Puruna Bazar it is around fivekilometres and from Bhadrak Kacheri Bazar it isabout seven kilometres. The place is better knownas Bhadrakali Sahi. On the Eastern side of thetemple there is a tank and an opera mandap. RiverSalandi flows in the west. On the Northern andSouthern sides there are residential complexesmeant for the devotees. Besides, a Jagannathtemple is there in the compoundof Bhadrakali temple.The popular belief goesthat this is not the original seat ofthe goddess. Different legendsalso strengthen this view. Ifhistory is the life of civilisation,legend is its soul. Even though thelegends are not research orientedfindings like history, still then theyplay a very important role inshaping history.According to one legendthe original image of Bhadrakaliwas worshipped in a verybeautiful temple at BhuyanMahala situated in the easternside of Bhadrak town. TheMuslim conquest of Orissabrought in its wake destructionof temples and places of Hindu worship. Theoriginal temple of the goddess also fell prey toMuslim invasion . The devotees of Bhuyan dynastyprayed mother who directed them in a dream toshift her place of worship.The devoteesaccordingly took the image in a boat in riverSalandi and moved eastways. Then she remainedin a hidden form in the river.Once the local kids had organised a picnicon the river bed. The kid-loving affectionategoddess overwhelmed with childlike simplicitytook food with them in disguise for which the placebecame famous as μAharapada¶ (place of takingfood).After the Muslim menace was over asmall temple was constructed. The Deity wasshifted from the water to the temple. Theparticular portion of the river Salandi is known asμBhadrakali ganda¶ till date.Legend goes that theBhuyan devotees broughtbrahmins from Siddhesvaravillage of Jajpur to worship theDeity. The small temple graduallybegan to deteriorate with theravages of time. So the presenttemple came into existence inbetween 1953 to 1959.Another legend goes onto say that the original place ofworship of the Deity was on theMeghasani hill in Mayurbhanjdistrict. This being the startingpoint of river Salandi, one tantriksage Tapas by name used toworship the Deity Bhadrakali.Oneday being overwhelmedwith the hymns of the sage milkbegan to ooze from the left breastof the Deity. The flow of milkjoined a spring and took the shape of a river. Asit flowed through a forest of Sal trees, it took thename o f Salandi.The sage Tapas became extremely happyand drank the water of the river as the blessing ofthe Deity. Then his soul mingled with eternal soul.His disciple Bhadranath created a tomb of hismaster and started worshipping the Deity."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Orissa Review September - 2009129One day surprisingly he saw that the bodyof his master had come out of the tomb. Beingperturbed he started praying. Suddenly he hearda heavenly voice that he should givepindato hismaster in the river. Further he should place theDeity in the water with pure heart. He should followthe sound of jingles attached to the feet of thegoddess. He would stop his journey where thejingle would become silent. Bhadranath didaccordingly. At a particular place he couldn¶t listenthe sound of jingles. Out of suspicion when helooked back, the heavenly voice instructed himto stop there. Bhadranath stayed there and beganto worship the Deity.The legend further tells us that once twoChauhan Maratha brothers came to PurushottamPuri for pilgrimage. They lost their way andentered a dense forest. All on a sudden they cameacross a radiant glow and followed it. At last theyreached a cottage.It was the residence of yogi Bhadranathwhere two brothers took rest. The next dayyounger brother fell ill. The elder one advised himto take rest at the sage¶s cottage and started hisjourney. The daughter of the sage treated theyounger brother with utmost care and affection,while he began to recover the two had fallen inlove.The Chauhan boy marked a peculiar thingthat everyday Bhadranath was going to anunknown place. He followed him one day andreached the spot at a distance. To his utter surprisehe found it to be a place of worship and the Deitywho was being worshipped was none else butMahamaya Bhadrakali.That particular night the youngman saw adream. The goddess gave him a flower withinstruction to walk and cover as much distanceas he could so that he would become the masterof that entire area.The next day holding the sacred flowerthe youngman proceeded being followed byMahamaya. The jingle on her feet began to ringas she walked behind. While the youngman wascovering the dry bed of the river Salandi, hecouldn¶t hear the sound. Thinking that the goddesshad deserted him, he looked back and the eternalmother took the shape of a stone image.As per the description of Ratnakosha,goddess Bhadrakali was the family deity ofBhuyan dynasty. This Maratha youngman was thefounder of Bhuyan dynasty. The name of the placewas Bhuyan Mahala which was the ancient capitalof Bhadrak. The Bhuyans were the rulers of theadjoining areas of Salandi river. They wereworshippers of mother Bhadrakali. Later on theyshifted their seat of rule to Dola Sahi after beingattacked by ferocious Afghan invaders. The placeis now well-known as Bhuyan Uasa from wheretheir successors migrated to different areas. Theyare now better familiar as Samantaray family ofTalapada, Bhuyan family of Kubera and Kanungofamily of Nadigaon.The historical background of the studyof the deity can be traced back to a fragmentaryinscription discovered from the present precinctof the Bhadrakali temple. The inscription occupiessecond place after Hatigumpha Inscription of theKharavela so far as its date is concerned. It iswritten in Pali language with Brahmi script.(Siddham) Maharaja Sri Ganasah Samvat(8) Mula japena Deva (3) Data(Adha !) Bapa 80 Mahakulapati- Aya Agni SamenamPani - Deva Dingi patichhidamAdhirasa ka Bhada apabasara ghali adasam.The archaeologists place the inscriptionat 3rd century A.D. from its language and style. Itis known from the inscription that by 3rd century"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"130Orissa Review September - 2009A.D. one king named μSri Gana¶ was ruling overthe area presently known as Bhadrak.It is evident that by 3rd century A.D. therewas Murunda rule in Tosali with its capital at UttarKalinga or Amita Tosala. Maharaja Sri Gana ofBhadrak was probably a feudatory ruler underthe Murundas because no other details areavailable due to the fragmentary nature of theinscriptio n.Dr. Harekrushna Mahtab opines thatMaharaja Sri Gana of Bhadrakali inscription wasa contemporary of the founder of Gupta dynasty- Maharaja Srigupta of 4th century A.D. Thenorthen part of Orissa alongwith Bhadrak andBalasore were under Gupta hegemony.But Bhadrakali of Bhuyan Mahala wasworshipped much earlier than the establishmentof Gupta rule in the region.1Dr. K.C. Panigrahi has given a differentversion. He is of opinion that in 3rd and 4thCentury B.C. the ruler of Bhadrak wasSurasharma. In his 8th regnal year one lady namedRangoli made some gifts for a pious lady,Parnadevi.2 But D.C. Sarkar has read the nameas Maharaja μGana¶ instead of MaharajaSurasharma.3 Dr. N.K. Sahu also opines thatMaharaja Gana of Bhadrakali inscription was afeudatory of the Murunda king of Pataliputra.Now the question arises who is thisμParnadevi¶. From legendary source we get thereference of one cottage. Is the word derivedfrom μparna kutira¶ (cottage made of leaves) or isshe the goddess Parna Sabari of Vedic Age orParna Sabari of Jain religion or Parna Devi ofBuddhism ? The riddle is yet to be solved becauseno other corroborative sources give us anyinformation in this regard.The iconographic feature of the imagedoesn¶t ascribe to 3rd Century A.D. Thedescription of the image of Bhadrakali in DeviBhagavata, Tantrasara and the hymn of meditation(Dhyanamantra) of mother Bhadrakali bear noresemblance to the present image. Rather herfeature ascribes it to Bhauma period (736 A.D.-960 A.D.). Most probably the original image ofthe deity was destroyed by the Muslim invadersand the present form appeared later on.But one thing is clear from the legendsthat in the beginning mother Bhadrakali like LordJagannath was worshipped by the non-Aryans inthe hilly region. In course of time the seat ofworship was shifted to the plains and from thenon-Aryan goddess she became the presidingdeity of the Aryan Hindus.Scholars are of opinion that the nameμBhadrak¶ has been derived from goddessBhadrakali. Bhagirathi Nanda Sharma cites theevidence that like Balasore from Basesvar,Sambalpur from Samalai, Bhubaneswar fromBhubaneswari, the name Bhadrak has also camefrom goddess Bhadrakali. Others even opine thatthe name Bhadrak may be the abridged form offull name μBhadrakali¶ like popular name Puriwhich comes from full name μPurushottam Puri¶.The word μBhadra¶ means fortune, good,auspicious,4\u0003μka¶ means to get radiant.5 So themeaning of Bhadrak is to get the radiant glow ofgoodness or welfare. Naturally the place isilluminated with the blessings of Bhadrakali.μOm μKa¶ Brahmam μKa¶ VishnuμKa¶ Devi MaheswariμKa¶ Bhadra μKa¶\u0003μKali¶Saikasha Bhadrakeswari¶Mother Bhadrakali plays a very dominantrole in the cultural life of the region.

These festivals and ceremonies duringdifferent times of the year play a very dominantrole in moulding the socio-cultural life of theregion.Mother goddess-worship is a veryancient tradition of Orissan culture. Not a singlevillage in Orissa is found where there is no placeof worship of gramadevi or the village Deity. Thevillagers take refuge under the feet of the motherto lead a happy and prosperous life.
