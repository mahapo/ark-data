[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Shakthi Mahimna Stotram (The prayer of the greatness of Shakthi) By Sage Durvasa Translated by P.R.Ramachander (Sage Durvasa was the son of Sage Athri and his wife Anasooya. His brothers are sage Dathathreya and Soma. It seems once Lord Shiva was so angry that no body dared to approach him. At that time Goddess Parvathi told him “durvasam Bhavathi may” meaning, “I am not able to live happily with you.”. Lord Shiva realized his mistake and took out all the anger from himself and placed it in the womb of Anasuya. The child born later to her was the very short tempered saint “Durvasa”. He is also called “Krodha Bhattagara”. (The personification of anger). People believe that Sage Durvasa consecrated the Kamakshi at Kanchipuram. He is the author of two great books viz Arya dwisathi and Shakthi Mahimna stotra. The later is similar to Adhi Shankara’s Soundarya Lahari in the sense that both deal with the power of Goddess Parvathi and both have two parts, the first part being philosophy of Shakthi and the second, the poetic description of Goddess Parvathi. In Shakthi Mahimna Stotra there are 61 slokas. The first part deals with Kundalini, meditation techniques, meaning and symbolism of several aspects of Shakthi worship and the second part is a very poetic description of Goddess Shakthi.
