Following the explanation given in the bookitself, the title may be rendered The Gnomon of the Zhou [dynasty]'.1 Much of thetext consists of calculations of the dimensions of the cosmos using observations of theshadow cast by a simple vertical pole gnomon. The Zhou bi follows the doctrine of thegai tian H;^ cosmography, in which an umbrella-like heaven rotates about a verticalaxis above an essentially plane earth.2 It is therefore unique in being the only rationallybased and fully mathematicised account of a flat earth cosmos.In its present form the Zhou bi certainly deserves the title of 'the principal survivingdocument of early Chinese science' given to it by A. C. Graham in his Later MohistLogic, Ethics and Science. As to its value, opinions have differed. A twentieth-centuryJapanese scholar well trained in modern science has called it 'a veritable goldentreasury of knowledge for all ages'.3 On the other hand an early seventeenth-century1 See paragraph #B15. All references to my translation take this form, in which the letter designatesthe sections into which I have divided the text, and the figure gives the number of the paragraph withinthe section. In the main translation each paragraph number is followed by a note of where the original textbegins in the edition of Qian (1963). Thus 34d refers to page 34, the fourth column counted from theright. Zhou bi is the original title of the book, but after the work became a university set text in theseventh century AD the words suan jing jtM 'mathematical classic1 were usually added. In Wade-Gilesromanisation the title will be found as Chou pi suan ching, or sometimes as Chou pei suan jing. Thereading of the second character as pinyin bi, Wade-Giles pi is supported by the earliest authority, who isLi Ji ^f| writing in the eleventh century AD: see the details given in chapter 2.2 My use of the term 'cosmography' rather than 'cosmology' is a deliberate distinction. By the first ofthese terms I mean a description that (at least ostensibly) is mainly concerned with the shape and size ofthe heavens and the earth, and with the disposition and motions of the heavenly bodies - a cosmicequivalent of geography. By the second term I mean any theory of how the universe works in a moremetaphysical sense. In China I would call discussion of Yinyang and Five Phase thinking cosmology inthis sense. Of course both terms involve prefabricated 'observer categories', and we cannot guarantee thatthey will correspond to the 'actor categories' we hope to recover by studying the writings of ancientChinese thinkers. In a case such as Plato's Timaeus the cosmographical/cosmological distinction hardlyseems to be present in the author's mind at all. But in my experience this initial distinction is a helpfulone, even if it may need revision at a later stage.3 Noda (1933), 140."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"xii   PrefaceChinese scholar, also well acquainted with the Western science of his own day, dismissedmuch of the book as 'the greatest stupidity of all time1.4 The aim of this study is tomake the Zhou bi accessible to anybody with an interest in the history of science, or inthe history of Chinese culture, so that they can judge for themselves.There is much to be said for reading a translation with a fresh mind, withoutallowing one's first impression to be influenced by the introductory discussion inwhich (with perhaps too much proprietorial zeal) the translator tells the reader whatthe ancient writer really meant, and why he wrote his book. While the language of theZhou bi is usually straightforward enough, I think that most readers will find that aninspection of the plain text will give them no more than a general and rough impressionof the concerns of the work. To supply the sense of context and purpose needed tounderstand the structure and content of the work, I have therefore provided substantialdiscussions of relevant issues.First of all, I have given a brief survey of as much of the history of early Chineseastronomy as is necessary to understand the Zhou bi. There is at present no introductorystudy in a Western language suitable for this purpose.5 With this essential foundationlaid down I have then discussed the main features of the text of the Zhou bi, andanalysed its principal themes. Next I have looked into the question of when and howthe work originated, and discussed its later history, including questions of textualtransmission. After the translation itself there follow, in conclusion, translations offour important short essays written by the first commentator on the Zhou bi around thelate third century AD.I make no claim to have deployed any very sophisticated methodology in thisbook. Half the effort required was of the old-fashioned philological and text-criticalvariety. Otherwise I had three main guiding principles before me, which I think wouldbe common to all serious historians of science nowadays. I have tried firstly to reconstructthe thought and practice of the ancient authors from their writings rather than taking itfor granted that modern categories will apply. This is of course an aim impossible ofcomplete attainment, as my use of such terms as 'astronomy' and 'mathematics' hasalready demonstrated. Secondly I have taken it as my first assumption that the variousthings people did in the past made sense to them as part of a more or less systematisedapproach to the tasks they were addressing. Naturally, in the end they may turn out tohave had the usual human capacity for confusion or self-delusion. Lastly, I have tried4 Xu Guangqi ^ytJUfc (baptised as Paul Xu), quoted in Dai Zhen's HScM introduction to the edition ofthe Zhou bi in the Siku quanshu collection: photographic reprint (1983) vol. 786, 2.5 The principal problem with the wide-ranging and scholarly treatment of astronomy in Needham(1959) is that it deliberately discounts the calendrical astronomy which is such an important element inthe Zhou bi. For a general critique, see Cullen (1980)."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Preface   xiiias far as possible not to draw boundaries which may not have seemed at all solid at thetime, or to force issues which had not yet occurred to anybody. How far I havesucceeded must be left for others to judge.I do not need to find arguments to persuade the student of the history of Chinesescience to pay attention to the Zhou bi, nor will such scholars need to be convinced ofthe need for an adequate treatment of this work in a Western language.6 Graham'sestimation of the importance of this text is clearly correct, and in addition the Zhou bihas the added interest of representing the work of an unofficial group of astronomicalthinkers, whose ideas may give us an alternative to the otherwise overwhelminglyofficial bias of Chinese astronomical literature.But what can a historian of Western science hope to gain from the encounter? Atthe most trivial level, the Zhou bi is certainly a novelty for someone from an intellectualworld where the only flat-earthers are Pre-Socratics known through a few doxographicfragments, or dogged eccentrics such as Cosmas Indicopleustes. More seriously, ancientChinese astronomical theory and practice appears to have had no significant connectionswith the worlds of Hellas, Babylon or Egypt. For once, therefore, we can cite parallelsand differences without being drawn into the old conflicts about who influencedwhom when and to what extent. The astronomy of Han China is an independent testcase. If we make proper use of the evidence it gives us we may be able to make a littleprogress towards deciding how far our perceptions are dictated by an objective naturalworld 'out there', and how far our world-view is a cultural construct. Not the smallestchallenge presented by the Zhou bi is that we have to think away the concept of thecelestial sphere that has been natural to all scientifically educated Westerners since atleast the time of Eudoxus - a transition much more difficult to make than the switchfrom a spherical to a flat earth. Such exercise is good for the mind, and sharpenshistorical perception.At some point in a preface an author has to pay his intellectual debts: as IsaacD'Israeli says, 'gratitude is not a silent virtue'. I am however in a slightly odd positionin this respect. Through the peculiarities of my initially amateur interests in thesematters, and through the imaginative tolerance of the Governing Body of the Schoolof Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), I first read the Zhou bi at a time when I knewonly classical Chinese. Modern Chinese and Japanese scholarship were initially closedto me. I was therefore in the fortunate position of forming at least a general view ofthe text fairly independently. Later, of course, I was able to read the work of No daChuryo fbBBJSjiS and Qian Baocong HIf 5f? on the Zhou bi, and I realised how much6 The pioneering French translation of Biot (1841) was successful in revealing many of the mainfeatures of the text, but has now been left behind by developments in scholarship. The treatment of thecosmography of the Zhou bi in Chatley (1938) is heavily dependent on Biot and comes to some verymisleading conclusions. It is unfortunately followed by Needham (1959), 212. Chatley's views are sparedcriticism in the otherwise excellent short review in Nakayama (1969), 25-35."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"xiv   Prefacemore there was to many problems than I had thought. I do however feel some confidencein the basic views formed in my initial state of relative ignorance, since I found mostof them confirmed in the work of these two great East Asian scholars. My debt tothem is so large that it would be tedious to footnote every instance where I have beeninfluenced by their work.Over the years I have discussed the Zhou bi with many friends and colleagues.First place must go to my PhD supervisor at SOAS, D. C. Lau, who introduced me tothe text and (I now realise) worked harder to teach me the rudiments of classicalscholarship than I had any right to expect. In the next office to D. C. Lau was AngusGraham, who also gave generously of his time. During autumn 1991 I enjoyed thehospitality of the Institute of History at National Tsing-Hua University, Taiwan whilecompleting the first draft of this book, and had the benefit of long conversations withProfessor Huang Yi-Long and Professor Fu Daiwie. A draft of the text was read andcriticised by Professor Nathan Sivin and Professor Geoffrey Lloyd, and I am mostgrateful to both of them for giving their time to this task. The responsibility for allremaining mistakes and omissions is of course my own. Finally, of course, only mywife Anne Farrer and my sons Peter and Robert are qualified to say how much myauthorial efforts have cost those around me. To them goes my deep gratitude for theircontinued tolerance and support."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"The background of the Zhou biI shall argue that the Zhou bi can best be understood as a product of the Han M age.The Han dynasty lasted from 206 BC to AD 220, with a relatively brief interruptionfrom AD 9 to 23, when a powerful courtier, Wang Mang 3Ef^, usurped the throne. Hewas the only ruler of his short-lived Xin fjf 'New' dynasty. It is usual to call the firsthalf of the dynasty 'Western Han1 and the second half 'Eastern Han', since the capitalshifted from Chang'an M^ in the west to Loyang ^Hl in the east after the Xininterregnum. The Han dynasty therefore spanned an interval as long as that whichseparates late twentieth century England from the time of Queen Elizabeth the First.Given such a long period of time, it is clear that we must be cautious in generalisingabout Han culture. Of course the analogy with English history is a little misleading.The Chinese world of the second century BC was not separated from the world of thesecond century AD by anything comparable with the scientific and industrial revolutions,the rise and dissolution of the British Empire, and the world-wide military and socialcataclysms of the twentieth century. Nevertheless the Han writers whose words havecome down to us are clearly conscious of living in a world where social, political andintellectual change are continual, sometimes for the better and sometimes for theworse.The most striking evidence of change for a Han historian was the contrast betweenhis own age and that which had preceded it. The world in which he lived was apolitical unity bound together by ideological and administrative structures unprecedentedin China. There had been previous kingdoms claiming rule over the whole country,such as the Shang j?§ in the five centuries up to about 1025 BC, or the earlier centuriesof the rule of the Zhou Mi who overthrew them. But after their capital fell to outsideenemies in 771 BC the Zhou kings were no more than nominal rulers. The real powerwas in the hands of their vassals, the lords of the great feudal states, some comparablein size with modern European countries. By the time of Confucius around 500 BCwarfare between the states was frequent, and it rose in a crescendo of scale andintensity until the western state of Qin it destroyed all its rivals and set up a unifiedempire in 221 BC.Rejecting the old Zhou system of feudal appanages, the first ruler of Qin extendedthe civil administrative system of his own state to the whole country, so that for the"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"2  The background of the Zhou bifirst time China was ruled by a non-hereditary bureaucracy. He was guided in this by avaried group of statesmen, who generally advocated a ruthless realpolitik in which thepreservation of the ruler's power and the promotion of his interests came before allelse. Chinese historians of later centuries, perhaps over-concerned to systematise thepast, tended to see these men as representatives of a self-conscious ideological movement,which they labelled retrospectively as the Fajia $kM> 'School of Laws' or 'Legalists'.The first ruler of Qin saw his conquest in cosmic terms. The world was governed bythe cyclical dominance of the Five Powers wu de E@ of Earth, Wood, Metal, Fire,Water (later commonly referred to as the wu xing Efr 'five phases') and he believedthat it was through the rise of Water that he had come to power. Lucid discussions offive phase theory will be found in Graham (1989) and Sivin (1987), and the detailsneed not detain us here since the theory does not appear in the Zhou bi..But the harsh rule of Qin was short-lived. The death of the first Qin emperor in210 BC was followed by widespread rebellion, from which by 202 BC one of themany contenders emerged with sufficient clear advantage to proclaim himself emperorof a new dynasty, the Han. This was Liu Bang HU^, originally a petty official ofpeasant origins who is better known to history by his posthumous title Gao Zu itfj^jl'The High Ancestor'.The Han dynasty mostly continued the political and administrative structures ofthe Qin. In the field of ideas, however, the situation was different. The age of theso-called 'Warring States' from the fifth century BC to the rise of Qin had been themost varied and fruitful period of Chinese thought, and, unlike the Qin, the Han hadthe time and security to create a synthesis to serve its needs. The intellectual productsof an age of semi-anarchy were transmuted into an ideology to underpin the newimperial state. By the first century BC the main lines of a new world-view had beenlaid down on the ostensible basis of the ancient texts preserved by the scholars knownas Ru {f§. This is the group usually referred to by Westerners as 'Confucians', althoughit is doubtful how far Confucius would have recognised his own voice in the doctrinestaught by the professors appointed to supervise the intellectual formation of imperialbureaucrats.He would certainly not have recognised the elaborate cosmology which was createdto underpin the moral and political orthodoxy of the centralised empire. This was theage when the ideas of Yin Hi and Yang HI and the Five Phases, and of the Book ofChange, Yi Jing US, were woven into complex schemes in which every phenomenonfound a place in an ordered cosmos, at the centre of which the Chinese emperor hadthe duty of holding the proper balance between Heaven, Earth and Man. Since theappearance of the sky was one of the clearest and most striking expressions of cosmicorder (or the lack of it), it is not surprising that an important department of theimperial bureaucracy was concerned with astronomy. It is within the context of the"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"The foundation charter   3marked changes in astronomical theory and practice under the Han that we must try tounderstand the nature and origins of the Zhou hi.What follows is an attempt to give the reader without specialist knowledge anoutline understanding of the place of astronomy in the culture of the early imperialperiod. It is not intended as a complete introduction to early Chinese astronomy, andfor the sake of brevity some points are therefore made in summary form.More detailed information on the development of Chinese astronomy from earlytimes up to the seventeenth century will be found in Needham (1959). Despite thecriticisms of Cullen (1980) this remains the best general account of the topic in aEuropean language, and its references to earlier studies are comprehensive. For thepresent purpose Needham's low estimate of the importance of calendrical astronomyin China is however a significant defect. Sivin (1969) is therefore an essential supplementfor anyone who wants to get a detailed picture of how the users of the early astronomicalsystems actually did their calculations. Yabuuchi(1969) collects (although it does notsynthesise) the researches of the twentieth century's greatest East Asian scholar in thefield of Chinese astronomy. There are a number of general histories of Chinese astronomyin Chinese. Anon. (1987) is a convenient one-volume treatment whose authors aremore scrupulous than is usual in giving references to original sources and the researchliterature.The foundation charterThe Book of Genesis stands at the beginning of the sacred canon of the Judaeo-Christiantradition. In its first chapter we are told of God's creation of the natural order, and inparticular of the creation of man. By contrast, in the earliest canonical account of thepast in the Confucian tradition we are told with equal solemnity of the creation of thesocio-political order by a human ruler. According to the first chapter of the Shu jingHIS 'Book of Documents', perhaps compiled around 400 BC, an important part ofthis process was the commission given to two hereditary lineages of star-clerks by thelegendary Emperor Yao §S in remote antiquity:Thereupon he ordered Xi ^ and He |P to accord reverently with august Heaven,and its successive phenomena, with the sun, the moon and the stellar markers, andthus respectfully to bestow the seasons on the people.7Xi and He each have two sons, who are dispatched to the four quarters of theearth with separate commissions to note the times of the summer and winter solstices,and of the spring and autumn equinoxes. Finally the Emperor turns back to the fathers:7 For text and a slightly different translation see Karlgren (1950), pp. 2 and 3."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"4  The background of the Zhou biO you Xi and He! The period is of three hundreds of days, and six tens of days,and six days. Use intercalary months to fix the four seasons correctly, and tocomplete the year.8This document has sometimes been called the foundation charter of Chineseastronomy. Whatever its historical value, it certainly does give an early indication ofthe importance attached to calendrical astronomy by the pre-modern Chinese state.Until the end of imperial China all governments maintained a staff of astronomicalspecialists. While such officials were not at the top of the bureaucratic tree, no governmentfelt it could manage without them. We must now say something about the functionsthat belonged to their office.The role of astronomyCalendrical astronomyThe essential task given to Xi and He is 'respectfully to bestow the seasons on thepeople1. They are to prepare a calendar, which will be promulgated with imperialauthority. This task was a principal concern of the official astronomical establishmentfor all the centuries during which it is known to have existed. The basic need seemsobvious enough. Clearly no government of any complexity can operate without somemeans of unambiguously designating in advance the days on which it expects toperform certain functions, or requires certain obligations to be fulfilled. But to thereader familiar only with the Gregorian system now used in most countries, thepreparation of a calendar may seem a puzzlingly trivial task to absorb the energies ofan important group of bureaucrats. In fact the problems encountered could be highlycomplex, and might demand ingenuity of a high order for their solution.A modern Gregorian style calendar gives the days of the twelve months in numberedsequence, and indicates on which days of the seven day week they fall. Once the rulesfor the placing of leap years are understood, a calendar for any given year can easilybe drawn up. The information required is simple: one must know the names of themonths in order, and the numbers of days in each (allowing for the extra day forFebruary in a leap year), and the names and order of the days of the week. Knowledgeof the day of the week for any given day of a given month in a given year enables thetwo sequences to be matched up for all other dates.As we shall see, the luni-solar nature of the ancient Chinese calendar makes theequivalent task much more difficult. The Chinese astronomers had to work with realmonths that followed lunations quite closely, as well as keeping a civil year of a wholenumber of months in step with the seasons. But in addition, from near the beginning8 Same reference."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"The role of astronomy   5of the imperial age astronomers had other tasks imposed on them. It was expected thatthe motions of the visible planets should be tabulated in detail, and that lunar eclipsesshould be predicted. More difficult still, some advance warning of the possibility ofsolar eclipses was expected. To do all this, it was essential to have a complete systemof mathematical astronomy in operation. Some of the details of such a system arediscussed in the Zhou hi. But why was all this effort considered worthwhile?The timekeeping functionIt is likely that some Chinese astronomical specialists were mainly motivated byintellectual curiosity, or perhaps by a wish to rise in their careers as successfulprofessionals. Such reasons do not explain why such specialists were felt to be anessential part of the state apparatus. One explanation frequently offered by both Chineseand Western authors runs along the following lines. China was an agrarian civilisation.Successful agriculture demands that such operations as sowing and harvesting arecarried out at the proper time. Therefore it was essential for the Chinese governmentto provide the peasantry with an accurate calendar, and indeed to make constantefforts to improve its accuracy.This explanation seems to me both misleading and inadequate. In the first place itis not much of a compliment to the Chinese peasant to suggest that without the help ofthe government he would not have known when conditions were appropriate for thework he had to do. Further, given the natural vagaries of the weather and variations inlocal conditions, it is likely that a peasant who sowed and reaped by the calendarwould do rather worse than one who trusted to observation and experience. Then wehave to face the fact that only a small part of the work of official astronomers relateddirectly to the passage of the seasons at all: once the dates of solstices have beendetermined there is in principle nothing left to say on the topic. And even then, foragricultural purposes a few days' error about (say) the date of midsummer is neitherhere nor there. The elaborate attention paid to the movements of the moon and theplanets is, according to the view criticised here, quite inexplicable.The ritual functionWhy then should Chinese astronomers have wanted precise answers to such questionsas when a lunation began? It will help if we recall the Chinese emperor's role as thepivotal element linking the human microcosm and the natural macrocosm. He isresponsible for the orderly functioning of both spheres. Visible disorder in nature is asign of a malfunction in the human order, and may thus evoke direct criticism of theemperor's rule. In the natural order celestial portents drew the most attention, and it istherefore quite understandable that Chinese astronomers tried to reduce to rule asmany astronomical phenomena as possible, with the ultimate aim of predicting everything"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"6  The background of the Zhou bipredictable. If, for instance, the occurrence of a lunar eclipse could be predicted itssignificance as a portent was much reduced. More positively, the image of the emperoras successful preserver of the cosmic order was inevitably enhanced if his governmentwas seen to comprehend the subtlest motions of the heavens.Such motivations go some way towards explaining the astronomical preoccupationsof the Chinese state. But once the astronomers had produced their detailed tabulations,did they answer any purpose beyond serving as imperial status symbols? Why shouldanyone care that the moment of winter solstice fell precisely when it did and not anhour or so later? In fact such data were seen as of the highest practical importance,both for the state and for the individual.For the state, it was necessary that certain imperial rituals should be carried out atthe proper times. Such rituals, often involving the emperor himself as celebrant werean essential contribution to the maintenance of cosmic order. If they were mistimed,they could fail to produce benefit or even do harm. If winter solstice fell a fewminutes before midnight, but the astronomers predicted it an hour later, the emperorwould be led to carry out his sacrificial ritual a whole day late. For the individual theconsequences were similar. Almost all the activities of daily life, from taking a wife toclosing a business deal, were conducted according to an elaborate divinatory schemeof lucky and unlucky days. Such schemes were an essential part of the calendar in theform most widely distributed. Commercially published almanacs giving this informationare still bought in huge numbers by modern Chinese people. If the calendar is in error,bad fortune or even serious danger might be the result.The role of portentsIt appears, then, that a great deal of what we would nowadays characterise as scientificactivity was supported by the Chinese state for motives that had little to do withmodern science. For completeness I will mention a related aspect of ancient Chineseastronomical activity. This was the observation of transient phenomena such as comets,novae and meteor showers. None could be predicted, and all were therefore potentiallyominous. As a result it fell to the official astronomers to take careful note of all suchphenomena, and of the precise times and locations at which they occurred, with theaim of ensuring that their significance was correctly deduced and reported to thethrone. Many such records have been preserved to the present day, and remain of thegreatest value to modern astronomers. The Zhou bi does not however concern itselfwith this aspect of official astronomical activity. In this it follows a division betweenportent astrology tian wen ^3t'celestial patterns' and mathematical astronomy // faM$k 'calendrical methods' which is basic to ancient literature dealing with the heavens."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"The problem of the calendar  7The problem of the calendarModern astronomical theoryQuite apart from the fact that the Chinese calendrical astronomer was expected toproduce detailed predictions of a wide range of phenomena, it has already been mentionedthat the basic nature of the Chinese calendar set him a more difficult task than runningthe Gregorian calendar demands. This was because the Chinese calendar was of theluni-solar type, which uses the moon as well as the sun as an important time-marker.In Europe the moon plays no role in the civil calendar at all, although it is stillimportant in fixing the date of Easter in the calendar of the Christian church. Thefollowing sections introduce the problems of running a luni-solar calendar, so far asthey are relevant to the concerns of the Zhou bi. I begin with a very short reminder ofsome basic astronomical facts, which may be skipped by those who do not needreminding. Fuller and very clear introductions to basic naked-eye astronomy, more orless from scratch, will be found in Kuhn (1957) and Dicks (1970).On the modern view, the earth is an almost exact spheroid of radius 6400 kmwhich rotates once daily on its axis. Once a year it completes a revolution round thesun. Its axis of daily rotation is tilted 23.5 degrees from the perpendicular to the planeof its orbit round the sun. During the course of a year the earth's tilted axis points in analmost unchanged direction in space, stabilised by the gyroscopic action of the spinningearth. Due to the effect of the sun's gravitational pull on the earth's slight equatorialbulge, over a longer period it becomes clear that this axis is in fact precessing conicallylike the axis of a child's top, so that it takes about 23 000 years to return to its originalorientation.As the earth moves in its orbit round the sun, the moon orbits round the earth. Thecombined gravitational influence of the earth and the sun make its motion relativelycomplex. Not only does its orbital speed vary, but the tilt of its orbital plane relative tothat of the earth round the sun can vary by up to about six degrees either way. Henceall lunar phenomena seem much less regular than those involving the apparent motionof the sun alone.Even the nearest stars are vast distances away compared to the radius of theearth's orbit. Over a period of many years their relative positions as seen by anobserver on the earth therefore change very little. As a result they may be taken as analmost fixed reference system against which phenomena within the solar system canbe measured. By the beginning of the Christian era astronomers in both East and Westhad come to think of the stars as fixed on the inner surface of a vast rotating celestialsphere with the human observer at (or very near) its centre. The points where thesphere's imaginary axis passes through it are the north and south celestial poles. Inreality the apparent celestial axis is simply the projection outwards into space of the"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"8  The background of the Zhou biearth's axis. Likewise the celestial equator, a great circle midway between the poles, isthe outwards projection of the earth's equator. Greek astronomers, who believed in aspherical earth, were aware of these correspondences, but since Chinese astronomerslived in a flat-earth universe the poles and the equator remained solely celestial concepts.A second great circle, the ecliptic, is inclined to the celestial equator at about 23degrees. This circle is the apparent annual path of the sun around the celestial sphereagainst the background of the stars. In reality it is simply the outward projection of theplane of the earth's orbit around the sun.Further technical details of the phenomena just outlined can be found in standardtexts such as Smart (1979). For our present purpose we are only concerned with theapparent motions of the celestial bodies as seen by an observer on the earth. Incommon with the majority of pre-Copernican inhabitants of the earth, the ancientChinese believed that they lived on a stationary body, and they therefore took theapparent motions of the sun, moon, stars and planets as real motions. Since thecoming of artificial lighting even educated people are rarely as familiar with thechanging appearance of the night sky as their ancestors would have been. Somenecessary reminders are therefore given in the course of the following discussion sofar as space will allow. The best detailed introduction to this topic is given in theopening chapters of Kuhn (1979).Days and day cyclesThe observer assumed in the Zhou bi is in a latitude close to that of the Yellow Riverbasin, around 35 degrees north. For such an observer the earth's daily rotation causesthe sun to appear to rise over his eastern horizon, climb to its highest position duesouth of him at the moment of noon, and then sink back over his western horizon.Because of the tilt of the earth's axis relative to its orbital plane (which is the plane ofthe ecliptic), the time the sun spends above the horizon and the maximum altitude itattains both vary markedly in the course of a year as the earth orbits the sun.No human society living on the surface of our planet can avoid using this repeatingcycle of light and darkness as its basic unit of time reckoning. The Zhou bi is noexception when it states that 'daylight and night make one day' (#K8).9 There havehowever been differences of practice as to when the division between days was placed.While the current civil practice in the majority of countries begins a new day atmidnight, the religious calendars of Judaism and Islam make the division at dusk.Whatever the earliest practice in China may have been, by the end of the first millenniumBC the convention of starting a new day at midnight was firmly established.The Zhou bi does not raise the question of whether or not the day is of constant9 As noted above, the reference here is to section K of the Zhou bi, paragraph 8, according to my owndivision of the text."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"The problem of the calendar  9length. The modern civil day is constant by definition, since it is taken to be precisely24 hours, and each of these hours contains 3600 seconds defined by a standard atomicclock. A day defined by the cycle of the sun's apparent movement is by no means assimple. The combination of the earth's rotation on its axis with its orbital motionround the sun means that the time interval between successive noons as measured by aclock can vary by up to twenty minutes during the course of the year. For this reasontime told by a sundial will not always be close to civil time as marked by a clock orwatch. This fact will however prove to be of only minor importance in deciding howclose the Zhou bis description of the phenomena comes to reality.In the West, the artificial seven-day cycle of the week has long played an importantrole in structuring civil and religious time. In ancient China a ten-day period, the xun>6j, played an analogous role from at least as far back as the Shang dynasty. Each daywas named using one of ten characters known as the tian gan ^^p 'heavenly stems'.There is no consensus amongst scholars as to the original significance of these characters.By systematic pairing of the ten stems with another set of twelve cyclical characters(the di zhi £&;£ 'earthly branches') a longer cycle of sixty day-names was generated:see table 1. This sexagenary cycle was used for civil dating independent of monthsand years, and seems to have run unbroken up to the present from at least as far backas the beginning of the first millennium BC. During the Han dynasty it becamecustomary to use the gan zhi -plfe cycle of sixty character pairs to designate a cycle ofsixty years in addition to its continuing use for naming days.Table 1.

All one needs to do to convert stem-branchpairs to sexagenary numbers is therefore to find the offset (remembering to countforwards through the cycle of branches until one comes level with the stem) anddivide by two to find the tens, and then take the units from the number of the stem.For an example, the reader may like to verify that bingchen HM corresponds to #53.The lunar cycleThere is no hard evidence to decide the question, but it seems probable that longbefore the sixty-day cycle came into use the lunar cycle already served as a mediumterm time unit. In the earliest records we have (Shang oracle bones of the late secondmillennium BC) both units are already used in parallel, as they were to be ever after.Before entering into calendrical matters, it may be helpful to give a brief reminder ofthe appearance of the lunar cycle for an observer on the earth.Following a lunationFigure 1 indicates the physical basis of the varying appearance of the moon during thecourse of a complete lunar cycle, or lunation. When the moon is at A, its illuminatedside is turned away from the earth, so that the observer cannot see it. This is themoment of conjunction, or 'new moon'. The Chinese term is shuo ^ 'dark'. Since themoon's orbit is in general not in the same plane as the earth's orbit round the sun, themoon is rarely exactly aligned between the sun and an observer on the earth; whenthis does happen the result is an eclipse of the sun in that observer's locality. If themoon was visible at conjunction, it would be very close to the sun in the sky, andwould rise and set at almost the same moment as the sun. On the day when the moonis at B an observer on the earth sees a half-illuminated moon. This phenomenon, iscalled xian §£ as are crescents in general. The sightlines to the sun and the moon are atright angles. As a result the moon appears to lag about a quarter of a day behind thesun in the sky. It rises near noon, reaches its highest point ('culminates') close tosunset, and sets about six hours after the sun. At C the moon is opposite the sun, andits visible side is fully illuminated. The moon now rises at about the time of sunset,and culminates close to midnight. This is the time of full moon, wang S. The rarecase of an exact sun-earth-moon alignment at full moon leads to an eclipse of themoon, as that body moves through the shadow-cone cast by the earth. Unlike aneclipse of the sun, an eclipse of the moon is seen by everyone who can see the moonat that time. At D the moon once more appears half illuminated, and is once more"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"The problem of the calendar11Figure 1. Following a lunation.designated as xian §£, but now lags three-quarters of a day behind the sun. It thereforerises about six hours before a subsequent sunrise, and culminates roughly at dawn.Finally it returns to position A, and the next new moon occurs.As I have already mentioned, the moon's orbit is subject to complex variations.The result of this is that the length of a lunation is variable. It can be as short as 29 1/4days, or as long as 29 3/4 days. The mean value is 29.5306 days, correct to sixsignificant figures.10Defining a monthAs with the day, it is necessary to make an arbitrary decision about what instant in therepeating lunar cycle is to be counted as the starting point for time reckoning. By theend of the first millennium BC, Chinese astronomers had adopted the moment of10 This quantity is technically called a mean synodic month. To avoid confusion with civil months,which contain whole numbers of days, this term is avoided in the rest of the discussion, and the term'lunation' is substituted."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"12  The background of the Zhou biconjunction for this purpose. Now for a given observer, the moment when the moon ismost closely aligned with the sun can occur at any time of day, so that the first part ofa day might fall in a different lunation from the part after conjunctionSuch a situation would be inconvenient for dating purposes. We thus meet for thefirst time the necessary distinction between the lunation and the lunar month. InChinese usage, the lunar month is a period consisting of a whole number of days,whose first day is in principle the day during which conjunction occurs; in practice, aswe shall see, various compromises and approximations are made. The lunar month issimply designated yue H 'moon1, and certain days in it are named after the lunarphenomena which fall within them, so that, for example, the first day, when conjunctionoccurs, is named shuo ff\\ 'dark', presumably because the moon is then invisible, withits illuminated side turned away from the earth. The months of the modern Gregoriancalendar have no relation to the lunar phases, although their length of about 30 daysmakes it plain that European months were once 'moons' like their Chinese counterparts.As will become clear later, by the beginning of the imperial age the decision as towhen a new lunar month began was made by calculation rather than by observation. Itis in any case impossible to observe the moment of conjunction by any simple means,except in the very rare case when the moon is precisely enough aligned with the sun tocause a solar eclipse. It is probable that at some stage in Chinese history the decisionto begin a new lunar month depended on observation rather than on calculation.11We cannot tell how this was done. It would have been possible to note the day offull moon, and guess that the next month would begin fifteen days later. More plausibly,observation could have been made closer to the end of the month. Typically there areabout three days near conjunction when the moon is not visible at all. On the precedingday a thin crescent is still just visible rising over the eastern horizon a little before thesun appears. The next day is ideally the last day of the month, and is designated hui M'dark of the moon'. Then follows the day of conjunction, shuo, the first day of the nextmonth. The second day of the month, which has no special name, is still moonless.Ideally the evening of the third day should see the first thin crescent of the moonfollowing the sun down over the western horizon at dusk. This is the day of fei M'emergence of the moon'.12In some calendars this day of first sighting of the new moon was the first day ofthe month: the Islamic fast month of Ramadan must still begin and end by directobservation of the first crescent. Perhaps at some early stage the first day of the monthin China may also have been fei rather than shuo. But if one is aiming to start the11 A possible consequence of the reduction of conjunction prediction to rule may be seen in the Analects(Lun yu It in) when (c. 500 BC) Confucius rebukes a disciple who wishes to discontinue the old customof sacrificing a sheep to announce the first day of the lunar month in the ancestral temple of the Dukes ofLu: Analects IIIA7.12 The character is composed of graphs with the meanings 'moon' and 'emerge'."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"The problem of the calendar  13month with a conjunction, it might seem reasonable enough to observe the last crescentof the preceding month, and start the new month on the next day but one. In realityhowever the visibility of the first and last crescents is highly dependent on the preciseposition of the moon relative to the sun as they near the horizon, as well as on theseason of the year and the observer's latitude, both of which affect the angle at whichthe sun and moon move through the horizon plane. Simple crescent observation andday counting will not therefore always fix the conjunction day correctly. This ishowever of little practical importance, since one is unlikely to be much more than aday out. As a result the first day of the month so defined will still be moonless,although the first crescent may be a little earlier or later than it ideally should be.Except when direct earth-moon-sun alignment produces a solar eclipse, conjunctioncannot be verified directly by the naked eye, so the error will not become obvious.During the Han period Chinese astronomers were thus able to work with a meanlunation which predicted conjunctions at fixed intervals without blatant contradictionfrom observation.The yearLike our year, the Chinese civil year began at the instant that a new day began. Ittherefore always consisted of a whole number of days. Unlike ours, it also began whena new lunar month began, and therefore always consisted of a whole number of lunarmonths, normally twelve. As we shall see, Chinese calendrical thinking has a tendencyto build up nests of cycles, so that the initial day of each one is also the initial day ofeach of the shorter cycles it contains. One of the paradigmatic problems of Chinesecalendrical theory is the attempt to find the 'Grand Origin Point' shang yuan _hfc atwhich all cycles begin together.13 A New Year's Day that was not also a new moonwould have seemed as unnatural as Easter Day on a Tuesday rather than a Sundaywould seem to most modern Christians.A series of twelve lunar months will generally turn out to be about eleven daysshorter than the annual cycle of the seasons as represented, for example, by the returnof the winter solstice.14 Left to itself, the twelve-month cycle will therefore get more13 See paragraph #K4.14 See the detailed discussion of intercalation below. To avoid confusion, it is important to distinguishthe concept of the Chinese civil year (which is a whole number of lunar months, each consisting of awhole number of days) from the so-called 'tropical year1, which is the interval at which solstices recur(strictly speaking the cycle is from one spring equinox to the next). A modern value for the tropical yearis 365.2422 mean solar days. As we shall see shortly, we must distinguish the tropical year from thesidereal year of 365.2564 days, after which the sun returns to its original position relative to the stars. Butsince Han astronomers did not yet make this distinction I use the term 'solar cycle' to refer to the period(365 1/4 days for the Zhou hi) during which it was believed both solstices and solar position would recur."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"14  The background of the Zhou biand more ahead of the seasons, so that over a few years the first month will movethrough spring, winter, autumn, and summer in turn. In some cultures this has notbeen seen as an important point. Islam uses such a pure lunar calendar, and there areno signs that either civil administration or the needs of agriculture in Islamic countrieshave suffered in consequence. And although the ancient Egyptian calendar was notlunar, its use of a fixed year-length of 365 days caused a slower but steady slippagewithout obvious signs of strain for the Egyptian peasant. In China, however, thedecision to try to keep the civil year in step with the seasons seems to have been madefrom an early period, certainly as far back as the Shang dynasty. It seems likely thatthis choice was associated in some way with the importance of seasonal ritual activitiesperformed by Chinese monarchs as part of their task of maintaining harmony betweenthe order of human society and the overall order of the cosmos.The annual cycle of nature as we perceive it is made up of many interlockingcycles, involving changes in weather, the growth cycles of plants, the breeding cyclesof animals, and the changing positions and visibility of the sun and stars. There is noobvious reason why one type of cycle should be singled out from the rest, and indeedthere is some evidence that early Chinese calendrical thought made use of the fullrange of reference cycles in defining the phenomena that ideally belong in a givenmonth.15 Human activity, whether defined as ritual or practical in modern terms, isjust one component part of the cosmic pattern. But by the end of the first millenniumBC it is clear that the primary points of reference for calendrical purposes were certaintypes of astronomical events. These were presumably favoured in part for their regularityand relative ease of observation, but we should not miss the ideological significance ofthe decisive shift towards the primacy of the heavens over mere earthly phenomena.There is certainly a link here with the cosmological underpinnings of the unifiedempire in which the emperor was to his subjects as heaven was to earth. The Zhou bidiscusses such astronomical reference points in some detail, as we shall see.Astronomical markers for seasonsAs the year passes, the sun goes through an obvious cycle of behaviour. For a northernhemisphere observer, at the winter solstice (dong zhi ^M 'winter extreme1) in midwinterit climbs above the south-eastern horizon relatively late. At noon it is still fairly low inthe sky due south, and it sets roughly south-west. As the year progresses, it risesearlier and sets later, and the points at which it crosses the horizon move northwards.15 See for example the monthly phenomena listed in the pre-Han annuaries Xia xiao zheng H7JNIE(Congshu jicheng edn) and the Yue ling JF\\X? chapters of the Lii shi chun qiu Sj5#ft (Sibu congkanedn). In the first, astronomical phenomena are only one category of seasonal indicators amongst others,including the weather, and the behaviour of plants, birds, fishes and animals. In the second, dating fromabout 239 BC, the astronomical indicators have won pride of place and are listed first, although the othersare also mentioned."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"The problem of the calendar  15The noon sun is a little higher in the south each day. When the summer solstice (xiazhi JEM 'summer extreme') is reached the day is at its longest; the sun rises in thenorth-east and sets in the north-west. At noon it reaches its greatest altitude of theyear. After the summer solstice the movement reverses, and after another wintersolstice the cycle repeats.Meanwhile a slightly less obvious cycle is taking place in the relation of the sunand the stars. If we could see the stars at the same time as the sun, we would noticethat the celestial sphere on which the stars may be imagined to lie rotates once a day,bearing the sun with it. The axis about which this apparent rotation occurs passesthrough the observer at an angle to the horizon equal to his latitude. The points wherethe axis passes through the celestial sphere are the north and south celestial poles, andhalf-way between them is the celestial equator. However, the sun does not keep to afixed position amongst the constellations. As the earth orbits round the sun, the sun isnaturally seen against a changing stellar background. As a result the sun appears totrace out a circle round the celestial sphere in the course of a year: this is the ecliptic.While this apparent solar motion cannot be directly observed, it is obvious that inconsequence the stars visible at (say) midnight will also change slightly from day today. The stars are in fact taking a little less time to return to their position relative tothe observer than the interval between successive noons or successive midnights.There is thus a typical midwinter night sky, most of whose stars will be below thehorizon during a midsummer night, and vice versa. Because of the phenomenon ofprecession the appearance of the night sky at a given season also changes slowly,passing through a complete cycle in about 23 000 years. During the period with whichwe are concerned Chinese astronomers were unaware of this fact, and assumed thatthe solar and stellar cycles had exactly the same period, so that (for example) thewinter solstice sun was always at the same position amongst the stars.16As a result, early Chinese calendrical specialists were free to observe whateverthey felt to be the most significant or convenient component of what was for them asingle cycle of astronomical phenomena. From observation of one set of phenomena,the progress of all others could be deduced. I will now briefly discuss three of themain methods used by the Zhou bi for this purpose.Noon shadows and the solstices One obvious indicator of the progress of the solarcycle is the sun's altitude above the southern horizon at noon, when it reaches itshighest point on a given day. Midwinter's day has the lowest noon sun, and midsummer'sday has the highest. These changes can be followed by the use of a simple verticalpole gnomon, whose shadow shortens and lengthens as the sun rises and falls in16 For a discussion of the difficulties that ensued when it became evident that the conventional wintersolstice position was in error, see Maeyama (1975-1976)."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"16  The background of the Zhou birelation to the horizon. Midwinter's day is marked by the longest noon shadow, andmidsummer's day by the shortest. It therefore seems a simple matter to establish thelength of the solar cycle: all one has to do is to count the days from (say) onemidwinter's day as determined by the gnomon to the next.In practice the task is not so easy. In the first place the sun's noon altitude changesquite slowly near its maximum and minimum, and it is therefore hard to be sure onexactly which days these occur. Secondly, the length of the cycle revealed by thismethod is not quite constant from year to year. Even assuming perfect accuracy inlocating the critical days, while most cycles will turn out to be 365 days long, somewill turn out to be 366 days long. Over a long enough period the average will turn outto be something like 365 1/4 days. This point is made in the Zhou bi, paragraphs #K9to #K11. Clearly the real solar cycle is about something other than what the sunhappens to be doing at noon.In the language of spherical astronomy, what is happening is that in this periodthe sun is moving once round a great circle on the celestial sphere against the backgroundof the stars. Its north-south movement is caused by the fact that this circle, theecliptic, is inclined to the celestial equator by about 23.5 degrees. Its furthest pointnorth is at the instant of summer solstice, and the furthest point south is at the instantof winter solstice. The period of this cycle is known as the tropical year; to sevensignificant figures it is 365.2422 days. The phenomena of sunrise, noon and sunset aregoverned by the apparent daily rotation of the celestial sphere relative to the observer,and it is therefore clear that the actual moments of solstice will not bear any fixedrelation to the moment of noon, so that the solar cycle will not be a whole number ofdays.As well as the two solstices there are two other obvious points of importance onthe sun's annual circuit of the stars. These are the spring and autumn equinoxes (chunfen #;£> 'division of spring' and qiu fen %kft 'division of autumn'), when the sunpasses through the celestial equator. At these times the sun rises exactly due east andsets exactly due west; it spends twelve hours above the horizon and twelve hoursbelow. During the Han dynasty it was assumed that the sun took equal amounts oftime to move through each of the four quarters into which the its path was divided bythe solstices and equinoxes, so that the seasons were of equal length.Each quarter was further divided into six equal divisions, so that the year wasdivided into 24 periods. These are the 24 qi H,, a term which is applied equally to eachperiod and to the instant of its inception. A list of them appears in paragraph #H2 ofthe Zhou bi. From the calendrical point of view, the chief function of this system is tomake it easy to check whether the lunar months bear the intended relation to theseasons. Since there are 24 qi, and a normal year contains twelve lunar months, it iseasy to see that each lunar month will tend to contain two qi within itself. In a sense,each pair of qi may be regarded as a 'solar month', but it must be remembered that"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"The problem of the calendar  17these 'months' do not have a whole number of days in them, and that the instant of qiinception can fall at any time of day. Out of the 24 qi only the solstices and equinoxesare defined by any obvious feature of the sun's behaviour.Once the length of the cycle is known the instant of each qi inception can befound as soon as one of them has been fixed. This reference point is usually taken tobe the winter solstice. Subsequent qi inceptions may be located by counting off timeintervals equal to one twenty-fourth of the solar cycle. The list of qi given in the Zhoubi is accompanied by a table of noon shadows for a standard gnomon (paragraph#H2), but most of these are theoretical constructs based on linear interpolation betweensolstitial values, and bear no direct relation to observation.Solar right ascension and longitude The origins of the qi system are linked to observationsof the sun's noon altitude through the length of shadow cast, and hence (in modernterms) to its varying declination, or distance north or south of the celestial equator. Adifferent reference system is used to deal with what we would now describe as thesun's movement in right ascension as it travels from west to east round the celestialsphere.17 This is the system of the 28 lodges, xiu ifff. The origin of the system isunclear, but it was well established by the end of the first millennium BC. If we allowourselves to think in terms of the celestial sphere (which the originators of the systemalmost certainly did not) the lodges divide the sphere into 28 slices of right ascensionlike the segments of an orange. This is however a very asymmetrical orange, since thesegments vary in width from about 1.5 degrees to about 30 degrees.18Ideally, the beginning of each lodge is marked by a reference star, although inreality the correspondence between the positions of stars and the theoretical extent ofthe lodges is not exact. The names of the lodges, with their reference stars, aretabulated in table 2. Recent archaeological evidence combined with an examination ofliterary sources has revealed the existence of an 'old system' of lodges differing inimportant respects from its successor, which seems to have been created in the great17 In terrestrial terms declination corresponds to latitude and right ascension to longitude. As terrestriallongitude is measured from the meridian of Greenwich, right ascension is measured from the position ofthe sun at the spring equinox. Confusingly, celestial longitude and latitude are not the same things as rightascension and declination, but are used in a different reference system, based on the ecliptic rather thanthe celestial equator.18 The actual Chinese unit used is the du S 'graduation1; it is close to the Western degree, since 360° =365 1/4 du. During the Western Han it was assumed that the sun moved through the system of the xiu at aconstant 1 du per day, so that it completed its circuit in 365 1/4 days."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"18The background of the Zhou biTable 2.

A celestial object is said to lie in a particular xiu if it crosses themeridian after the relevant reference star, and before the reference star of the next xiu.It is irrelevant whether the object comes close to the asterism to which the reference19 See the discussion of Wang and Liu (1989)."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"The problem of the calendar  19star belongs. The reference stars do not seem to have been chosen to lie close to eitherthe ecliptic or the celestial equator at any epoch, and they certainly did not need to doso to serve their purpose.The data for the 'new' system are taken from Needham (1959) table 24. Those forthe 'old' system are from Wang and Liu (1989), using the lodge widths to the nearestwhole du from the excavated 'lodge disc' there described. In some cases identificationsof reference stars in the old system are open to discussion. For lodges 25, 26 and 27Wang and Liu label stars as L, M and r of the relevant asterisms, evidently throughtypographical error. Lodge names are translated as in Schafer (1977) table 2.Centred stars It is not possible to observe the position of the sun amongst the lodgesdirectly, since its brightness makes it impossible to check which reference stars crossthe meridian before and after it. Any estimate of its position must necessarily involvetheoretical inference as well as observation. It is not surprising, therefore, that whatappear to be our earliest texts referring to the seasonal changes in the heavens do notrefer to the sun in direct relation to the stars. The Xia xiao zheng S7JNIE 'LesserAnnuary of the Xia' mentions fifteen stellar phenomena linked to eight of its twelvemonths, including when certain asterisms first become visible in the night sky or arelast seen, the dusk or dawn direction of the Dipper handle, and in three instancesreferences to a star being zhong tfp 'centred' at dawn or dusk.20 If later usage is aguide, this expression refers to the moment when a star crosses the observer's meridiandue south. Unfortunately the origin and date of this text are highly problematic,although it certainly resembles no text of the Han period.It was the dusk and dawn 'centring' of stars that was to become the most importantdirectly observable stellar seasonal phenomenon in early Chinese astronomy. There isno doubt that the four important stars mentioned as seasonal markers in the astronomicalfoundation charter in the Yao Dion %^ (part of the Book of Documents, perhapscomposed in the fourth century BC) are to be interpreted in this way. Despite heroicattempts from the time of Gaubil in the eighteenth century, efforts to date this textfrom the stars it mentions seem misdirected, since they discount the large number ofuncontrolled assumptions necessary to begin a quantitative analysis of such data.21The earliest datable listing of centred stars is given in the Yue ling H^? 'MonthlyOrdinances' chapters of the Lu shi chun qiu S.R#|^, completed in 239 BC. The fact20 See this short text in the Congshu jicheng edn.21 Thus we have to identify the stars concerned (which are probably asterisms of finite breadth), chooseexactly what times of the year are referred to, guess a latitude for the observer, and guess what is to countas 'dusk' and 'dawn1. Some of the difficulties involved in such calculations were (so far as I can tell) firstpointed out by Ptolemy around AD 150: see Almagest VIII.6.H203, pp. 416-17 in Toomer (1984). Onthis topic see also Yabuuchi (1969), 267. Some of the attempts to date this and related material arediscussed in Needham (1959), 245-7."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"20  The background of the Zhou bithat this listing also includes solar positions amongst the lodges warns us that the datagiven come from a time when astronomical theory may be as important an influenceas observation.The first full listing of dusk and dawn centred stars in the context of an integratedcalendrical scheme is given in the system of AD 85 in Hou Han shu WMM, zhi /£ 3,3077-8. The seasonal reference points are the twenty-four qi rather than the vaguemonths of the Lu shi chun qiu. The data are given together with the lengths of day andnight as well as the position of the sun amongst the lodges. Once again observationand theory are inextricably entwined.Observations of centred stars are for practical purposes an easy way to keep arunning check on whether or not the calendar is in close step with the heavens. Bycontrast, solstice observations require careful measurement and can only be donetwice a year. Perhaps because of its stress on the role of the gnomon for shadowobservation, the Zhou bi does not, however, discuss the use of centred stars as seasonalindicators, although it does discuss the meridian transits of stars at other times.The structure of an astronomical systemHow to forget astronomyIt is not a difficult matter to run a luni-solar calendar of the Chinese type if all one isrequired to do is to say what the date is today. The sixty-day cycle is a matter ofsimple counting, and with a little boldness in extrapolating from observation of thelast crescent to estimate the day of conjunction, it is simple to define the day of themonth. If at the end of a civil year of twelve lunar months it becomes clear that theyear is slipping seriously out of step with the appropriate phenomena amongst plants,animals, the weather and the heavenly bodies, one just adds an extra 'intercalary'month to that particular year to allow nature to catch up before reckoning the firstmonth of the New Year.The problem about this is that prediction is not part of the deal. You cannot, forinstance, tell in advance what day of the sixty-day cycle will be the next New Year'sday, although a rough guess is of course possible. This sets limits on the planning ofactivities for the year ahead, especially when state ritual activity appropriate for aparticular day is involved. At a less exalted social level, it is impossible to predictlucky and unlucky days very far in advance. It was this problem that Chinese calendricalastronomy set out to solve by creating the mathematical systems known as // M, aterm conventionally but misleadingly translated as 'calendar' (and to be distinguishedfrom the similarly romanised length unit // M). In reality these were astronomicalsystems designed to make astronomical observation superfluous by providing rules forpredicting all important celestial phenomena. Such systems were commonplace by the"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"The structure of an astronomical system  21end of the first millennium BC. Their construction demanded a measure of approximationand compromise related inversely to the mathematical and astronomical resourcesavailable to those who created them. In the Western Han, when full descriptions ofsuch systems first became available, the degree of approximation was often relativelylarge.As the discussion proceeds, it will become clear that the Zhou bi does not containa complete description of a li. It does however give the basic constants which form animportant part of all li of a particular type, the 'quarter-remainder' or si fen H^> group.It is these constants that will be used for illustration in what follows.The month and the day: long and shortOn a naive view, to predict on what day of the sixty-day cycle a future month begins,it is necessary to find on what day the appropriate conjunction of sun and moonoccurs. This is not an easy matter since, as already mentioned, the behaviour of thesun-moon-earth system is complex. The intervals between successive conjunctionscan vary between about 29.25 days and 29.75 days. Further, it must be rememberedthat the days used here are mean days. Days as actually observed with reference to thesun vary in length by about twenty minutes in the course of a year, complicatingmatters further.All this is however an anachronism if we are to look at matters from the point ofview of an ancient Chinese calendrical astronomer. All he had to do to be hailed assuccessful was not to be seen to be wrong. Since the conjunction cannot be observeddirectly, he would be safe so long as he was not much more than a day out, and thusavoided the risk of the crescent moon being visible on the alleged conjunction day. Itwill be recalled that there are generally moonless days preceding and followingconjunction. To achieve this degree of success, it is only necessary to predict the'mean lunation', that is, to find the days on which conjunctions would occur if theywere spaced at constant intervals equal to the average of the variable spacing of reallunations.The modern value of the length of the mean lunation is 29.53059 mean days,correct to seven significant figures. Since this is close to 29 1/2 days, early Chineseastronomers were able to follow the mean lunation quite closely for some time bysimply alternating 'small months' xiao yue /JN^ of twenty-nine days with large months'da yue i\\^ of thirty days. If the alternation is unbroken, one is in effect neglecting0.0306 days each month, and after about thirty months the accumulated deficit willamount to a whole day. To take account of this it is necessary to allow two largemonths in succession to occur at predetermined intervals. Precisely when this is donedepends on the value for the length of the mean lunation used by the astronomical"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"22  The background of the Zhou bisystem in question. As will be seen in the next section, the Zhou bi uses a meanlunation length of 29 499/940 days (29.53085 days to seven significant figures). Thereis however no indication of when successive large months are to be inserted.The month and the year: intercalationThe interval between successive occurrences of the same solstice changes so little thatin the present context it may be taken as constant at 365.2422 days, correct to sevensignificant figures. Chinese astronomical systems used a variety of values for thisquantity. The Zhou bi is committed to the value of 365 1/4 days for the solar cycle,22and a number of different // have this feature in common. They are therefore said to beof the 'quarter-[remainder]' si fen 0^ type.It will be recalled that twelve lunar months give a civil year about eleven daysshorter than the solar cycle, so that it is necessary to add an extra 'intercalary' monthevery three years or so to keep in step with the seasons. If precise values are assignedfor the mean lunar and solar cycles, it is possible to calculate the average frequencywith which intercalations must be made over the long term. The Zhou bi implies inparagraphs #K9 to #K11 that the solar cycle length is determined by observations ofsuccessive winter solstices over several years.The mean length of the lunar month is not however fixed independently. Instead,the Zhou bi gives logical priority to a statement of how many lunar months thereshould be in a certain number of civil years: see #12 and #K15, #K16. The implicationis that over a long enough period it should be possible to find a precise commonmultiple of the solar cycle and the mean lunar cycle. Given a value for the solar cycle,the mean lunar cycle may then be derived. The equivalence used in paragraph #12 is:19 solar cycles = 235 mean lunar cycles.Nineteen solar cycles of 365 1/4 days do not amount to a whole number of days,and hence this period cannot contain integral numbers of civil years and civil months.Perhaps for that reason the direct calculation of the month length made in #K15 and#K16 is based on the number of mean lunar cycles in 76 years, for which we may say:76 civil years= 76 solar cycles= 4 x 235 months= 4 x 235 mean lunations.22 See#D6and#Kll."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"The structure of an astronomical system  23Thus one mean lunation = 76 x (365 1/4 days) •*• (4 x 235), from which it followsthat the mean length of the lunar cycle must be 29 499/940 days.From the equivalences used here it is possible to determine the intercalation rulewhich lies behind them. If 76 years contain 4 x 235 = 940 months, then the number ofintercalary months added in this period must be:940-(76 x 12) = 28.This may be stated in its simplest terms by saying that there must be sevenintercalations in a nineteen-year period. The Zhou hi does not discuss how these extramonths are to be distributed. Indeed, it does not make any explicit mention of intercalationat all, although paragraphs #13 to #17 refer to the 'small year', 'large year' and 'meanyear1. The common term run yue fHIH 'intercalary month' does not occur in the text.The system originOn the basis of the data discussed so far, we can state the intervals at which solsticesand mean conjunctions should follow one another. But to determine when a futuresolstice or conjunction should fall we need to have a fixed point from which to startour reckoning. We would have all we needed if the instants of any solstice and anyconjunction were specified. The two events could be centuries apart without creatingany difficulties of principle. In practice, however, by the beginning of the Han dynastyit is clear that Chinese astronomers preferred to do things differently.All early li for which we have any evidence specify that all reckonings are tobegin from a single 'system origin' // yuan MjC , or epoch. At this point it is usuallyclaimed that a number of important cycles began simultaneously. In the first place, anew day begins, so that the instant of system origin is midnight. This new day maybegin the sixty-day cycle, or represent some cosmologically significant point within it.It is also usual to specify that there is a mean conjunction at midnight, so that the lunarcycle begins with the start of the new day. Thirdly some important instant of the solarcycle, perhaps the winter solstice, or at least some other qi inception, will also fall atmidnight. If the winter solstice is chosen, the month beginning will be the eleventh ofthe so-called Xia H [dynasty] count, which is still used in the traditional Chinesecalendar today.The choice of a system origin has a twofold significance. The first is a cosmicone: both the conditions at the system origin and the year in which they occur may beseen as having numerological and political importance. Secondly, the existence of acommon origin for many cycles considerably simplifies calculations: how this workswill be seen in the next section. It is striking that while the Zhou hi makes clear"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"24  The background of the Zhou bireference to the second point, it nowhere specifies a system origin. As a result itcontains insufficient information to enable actual calendrical calculations to be made.The significance of this omission will be discussed later.Resonance periodsIt was not uncommon for the system origin of a // to be fixed some centuries earlierthan the period during which the // was devised and put into practice. Since the Zhoubi does not touch on such questions, a full discussion of how a system origin waschosen would be out of place here. It has already been indicated that the choice mightbe strongly influenced by political and cosmological considerations. In addition, thecombination of the system origin and the basic constants of the li in question had toproduce an acceptable degree of success in predicting when solstices and meanconjunctions would fall during the period of currency of the given system.It is easy to see that making such predictions could involve manipulation of quitelarge numbers. Thus suppose one wished to know the day of the month on whichwinter solstice fell 330 years after the system origin. We need, in effect, the remainderfrom the following division:(330 x 365 1/4)- (29 499/940).To perform this using ancient Chinese computational procedures, the top andbottom of this fraction must be converted to integral form, obtaining:{[330 x (4 x 365 + 1)] x 940}- [(29 x 940 + 499) x 4]=(453 202 200)-(111 036)= 4081 months, with remainder 17.1 days.Fortunately such calculations are not essential, since a number of useful periodicitiesare produced by the choice of constants used in the Zhou bi and in several ancient //.Paragraph #K4 specifies these, without however stating the uses to which they mightbe put. A brief explanation is therefore given here. We may assume that we are usinga system origin at which qi inception and conjunction coincide at a given time of a dayof stated number in the sixty-day cycle. The conjunction specified is usually thatwhich begins the first month of the civil year, so that the system origin falls on NewYear's Day.(1) 19 years: one zhang M (the 'Rule Cycle').2323 In the ancient West, this period is associated with the name of Meton of Athens (fl. 430 BC): seeNeugebauer (1975) vol. 1, p. 4, and vol. 2 p. 622.

Wemay proceed as follows.330 = 76 x 4 + 26and 26 = 19+ 7.We are therefore commencing the eighth year of the second zhang of the fifth busince the system began to run (it must be noted that the first zhang, bu etc. began atsystem origin).

No more detail will be given than is necessary for discussion of theorigins of the Zhou hi.The Zhuan Xu liThe twenty-sixth regnal year of King Zheng IE of the state of Qin fjl ran from late222 BC to late 221 BC. After years of ruthless warfare Qin had overcome all rivalsand united China under a single imperial government. As part of the new dispensation,the king inaugurated a new astronomical system, the Zhuan Xu li W&kM 'Zhuan Xusystem1. Zhuan Xu was the grandson of the legendary Yellow Emperor of high antiquity,and it was from him that the royal house of Qin claimed descent. This system wasused throughout the Qin dynasty. When the first Han emperor was proclaimed in 202BC he continued to use much of the state machinery and ritual of his predecessors,including the Zhuan Xu li, which was not replaced until nearly a century later.The Zhuan Xu li was a system of the quarter-remainder type described above. Ashas already been indicated, such systems differ amongst themselves only in theirchoice of /* yuan MlC 'system origin' or epoch. According to the account given byChinese historians in the first century AD, at the time of the Qin unification there aresaid to have been six different astronomical systems in circulation (Han shu 21a, 973).Two of these, the Huang Di li WC^?M and the Zhuan Xu li SHIS®* bore the names ofsemidivine rulers of mythical antiquity, the so-called Yellow Emperor and his grandsonrespectively. The Xia li M.M , Yin li ISM and Zhou li MM were named after whatwere seen as the first three great dynasties to rule China, while the Lu li H)U wasnamed after the feudal state in which Confucius had lived. In only the last two casesdoes there seem any possibility of a real historical basis for the name. At the end ofthe first century BC the imperial library contained works said to describe all of theseastronomical systems, amounting to 82juan ^ in total (Han shu 30, 1765-6). Onlythe titles of these books remain today, but references in other works enable us to say agood deal about ancient astronomical systems in general; in the case of the Zhuan Xuli and to a lesser extent the Yin li we can fill in the details of their special features."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"28  The background of the Zhou biFrom 104 BC onwards the standard histories have preserved more or less completedetails of the successive astronomical systems in official use.The Zhuan Xu li appears to have specified the following initial conditions:26Year: 26th regnal year of Duke Xian JR of Qin, i.e. late 367 BC to late 366 BC.This year is designated as 51 in the 60-year cycle. During this year the preciseinstant of inception of the fourth qi, li chun AI#, falls at midnight and coincideswith the instant of conjunction of sun and moon, which are then in the fifth du Sof the lodge House; the day then beginning is 51 of the 60-day cycle, and themonth is the zheng yue IE^, the first of the Xia month-count.27The unit du g used here results from dividing the circumference of a circle into365 1/4 parts: the link with the length of the year is obvious. A check using modernastronomical tables shows that the astronomical events referred to all fell within thefirst twelve hours of 366 BC February 9, according to local time in the central YellowRiver basin. It is however highly unlikely that the astronomers who devised the ZhuanXu li nearly 150 years later had any reliable observational data for the day in question.The choice of a system origin would be more likely to relate in part to the accuracy ofthe system's predictions at the time of its creation and in part to the neatness ofsupposed coincidence of events under system origin conditions. Other quarter-daysystems using different // yuan might place their initial ^//conjunction/midnightcoincidence in another year altogether. In practice, however this discrepancy would dono more than shift the predicted instants of qi inceptions and conjunctions by variousfractions of a day relative to the Zhuan Xu li reckoning.The Tai Chu li and the San Tong liThe first emperor of the Han dynasty began his rule without the panoply of a newcosmic dispensation. Near the end of the second century BC the Emperor Wu jKdecided to repair the omission by a comprehensive revision of state ritual and symbolism,which naturally included a new astronomical system, which was to be known as theTai chu li ~j^MM Grand Inception system'. The motives behind this movement were26 For supporting evidence and a general discussion of the Zhuan Xu li, see Chen Jiujin and ChenMeidong (1989). The statements of initial conditions given here do not occur together in any singleancient text.27 This is the month-count which allegedly begins with the New Year of the legendary Xia dynasty.Under the Qin and early Han the civil year began in the eleventh Xia month. From 104 BC up to thepresent the year has begun on the Xia New Year's day, i.e. the beginning of the first Xia month.Nowadays this usually falls some time during February."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Calendrical astronomy under the Han  29complex, and the full story would take too long to tell here.28 So far as they concern usdirectly, the facts are fairly straightforwardIn the first place, the new system required a new system origin. This was fixed atthe winter solstice near the end of 105 BC. Under the new system this was stated tohave occurred at midnight beginning day 1 of the sixty-day cycle, and to have coincidedprecisely with the conjunction which began the 1 lth month of the Xia count. This wasalso the beginning of year 51 in the sixty-year cycle, as had been the case with theZhuan Xu li origin. The result of this new choice of system origin was to make allpredicted instants of winter solstices three and a half hours later than under the oldsystem, and to make all predicted mean conjunctions ten hours earlier.There is some evidence that the original intention was to construct a quarter-remainder type system with the new origin. It seems, however, that within three orfour years at most the new system was using basic constants which were not those ofthe quarter-remainder type to which all previous systems had belonged. The basicinnovation was the length of the mean lunation, which was revised from 29 499/940days to 29 43/81 days. The change is a very small one, since:499/940 = 42.999/81 to three decimal places.This new value was wholly motivated by the desire to have the numerologicallysignificant number 81 as the divisor in the month fraction.29 It actually makes themean lunation length move a little further away from an accurate value.30 Despite thischange, the new system retained the equivalence:19 solar cycles = 235 mean lunations.This implies that the solar cycle must be 365 385/1539 days long.These new basic constants dictated new 'resonance periods', whose lengths differedfrom those shared by the quarter-remainder systems. Briefly, they were:One zhang ^: 19 years (the 'Rule Cycle1). As in the older systems, this periodgives repetition of coincidence between a reference qi (winter solstice in this case) andmean conjunction.28 For a fuller account, see Cullen (1993).29 In the first place 81 is the square of the 9, the Yang number par excellence, and the largest number inthe Chinese multiplication table: see the Zhou bi #A2. This was also taken to be the cubic capacity inunits ofcun of the standard pitch-pipe: see Han shu 21a, 975.30 To seven significant figures, we have:True value: 29.53059 daysQuarter remainder: 29.53085 daysGrand inception: 29.53086 days."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"30  The background of the Zhou biOne tong tfc: 1539 years (the 'Concordance Cycle'). Solstice and conjunctioncoincide once more at midnight.One yuan JG: 4617 years (the 'Epoch Cycle'). Solstice and conjunction coincide atmidnight, and the day then beginning is once more number 1 of the sixty-day cycle.Clearly it was only the first of these periods that found application in solar andlunar calendrical calculations during the period of less than two centuries duringwhich the new system was in use. The basic solar and lunar constants of the GrandInception system remained in use until the late first century AD. It was not howeverimmune from criticism. In 78 BC, 27 years after the Grand Inception reform, theGrand Astrologer Zhang Shouwang iMHH submitted a memorial to the EmperorZhao 0g , at that time only 15 years old, in which he stated:The astronomical system is the great thread guiding heaven and earth, made by theSupernal Lord (Shangdi Jiitf). From the beginning of the Han [up to the GreatInception reform], the dynasty made use of the Yellow Emperor's Tiao lu li fjfSM ('astronomical system harmonising the standard pitchpipes'). Now [under thenew system] the Yin and Yang are no longer in harmony, and it is time to put rightthe faults in the astronomical system.(Han shu 21a, 978)The matter was referred for further investigation to the calendrical expert XianyuWangren Jl^^^A. After receiving no satisfactory answer to questions he had put toZhang Shouwang, Xianyu Wangren set up a program of observations which lasted forthree years and involved more than twenty persons. The result of this program was tovindicate the predictions of the Tai chu li and to show that Zhang's astronomicalsystem was seriously in error. As the Han shu points out, Zhang was quite wrong tosay that the early Han had used the system that he called the Yellow Emperor's Tiao luli, and in any case it transpired the system to which he gave this name was in fact noneother than the Yin li as recorded in the files of the Grand Astrologer's department.31Zhang did not confine his unorthodox views to calendrical matters. He was alsocondemned for holding that the time of the Yellow Emperor was more than 6000years before the time of his memorial, whereas the official view placed (presumably)the beginning of his reign 3269 years before the time Zhang wrote. He also believedthat two sovereigns had held the throne who were not in the accepted sequence, one insuccession to the founder of the Xia dynasty, and another 'between the Shang and31 If Zhang was using the Yin li under another name, this explains his claim that The Tai chu li isdefective by three quarters of a day, and has reduced the lesser remainder [i.e. the numerator of thefractional part of the day] by 705 parts' (Han shu 21a, 978). The Tai chu li system origin was indeed threequarters of a day ahead of the coincidence of conjunction and solstice according to the Yin li, and thiscertainly involves removing 705 from the lesser remainder for the conjunction, since 705/940 = 3/4."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Calendrical astronomy under the Han  31Zhou dynasties'. This second, he held, was a woman. Zhang seems to have beensomething of a crank; he was arraigned on a charge of 'Great Disrespect [to theEmperor]' equivalent in seriousness to blasphemy combined with lese majeste, but hewas eventually pardoned. Despite this good fortune he could not keep his ideas tohimself and was eventually re-arrested, after which we hear no more of him.The interest of Zhang's case is that it serves to warn us against seeing astronomicalactivity under the Han as existing only within the confines of that which was officiallysanctioned. If a man with views like Zhang could fill the office that had once beenheld by Sima Qian, and from that position champion a system of the old quarter-daytype against the new Tai chu li, what variety of thought might there not have beenamongst private students of astronomy? This is a point to which we shall return whenconsidering the origins of the Zhou hi.It was about the time of the affair of Zhang Shouwang that Liu Xiang §8] [pj (77BC-6 BC) was born. He was a member of the imperial clan, and served for a shorttime as Superintendent of the Imperial Household. Several works by him are stillextant, but the literary task for which he is best remembered is his labour in collatingand editing texts of works for the imperial library. He also wrote on calendricalastronomy:In the time of the Emperor Cheng j^c [r. 32 BC to 7 BC] Liu Xiang gave acomprehensive account of the six systems of astronomy [presumably the six ancientquarter-day systems, see above] and set out their good and bad points in his Wujilun S&Btt 'On the succession of the Five [Powers]1. (Han shu 21a, 979)Only fragments now exist of this work, and also of his Hong fan zhuan ^f5ft'Account of the Great Plan [chapter of the ancient Book of Documents]' which alsocontained material on astronomy. From his son Liu Xin §!j &K (c. 50 BC-AD 23)much more survives of relevance to the present study. Liu Xin completed his father'swork on the imperial library catalogue, a summary of which is preserved as chapter 30of the Han shu. In scholarship he followed the group of Han scholars who wereconcerned with the historical significance of ancient texts understood in human terms,rather than as inerrant scripture to be ransacked word by word for esoteric meaning.As a youth, he was a friend of Wang Mang zE^ (45 BC-AD 23), who rose topower through his family connections with the empress. In AD 9, after having beenthe effective ruler for some years, Wang caused the boy who held the throne asnominal Han sovereign to go through a ceremony of abdication in his favour, and tookthe throne as emperor with the title Xin iff 'New' for his dynasty (Han shu 99a,4099-100). Liu Xin became one of Wang's chief ministers, and provided intellectualsupport for Yang's claim to be patterning his government on the model of antiquity.Despite his membership of the old imperial clan Liu survived a number of political"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"32  The background of the Zhou bipurges during the next three decades, including some involving his own children, untilin AD 23 he was executed after the discovery of a plot to assassinate Wang andrestore the Han to power.As the founder of a new dynasty, it was imperative for Wang to adopt a newsystem of cosmic symbolism, including an astronomical system. By this time the viewof the succession of the Five Powers had changed from that held under the early Han,where the powers had succeeded one another by 'conquest' in the sequence Earth,Wood, Metal, Fire, Water (see page 2). In 104 BC the founders of Han had decidedthat the dynasty ruled in virtue of the power of Earth, having conquered the waterypower of Qin. The theory of Liu Xiang and Liu Xin, however, held that the dynasticsuccession of the Five Powers was not by conquest but by natural succession 'as froma mother to her child', in the order Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, Water; in this sequence itwas believed that the Han ruled in virtue of Fire (Han shu 25b, 1270-1). It wastherefore natural to claim that since the last Han ruler had abdicated peacefully toWang Mang, he must rule by virtue of the power which succeeds naturally to Fire,which is Earth. At his accession, therefore, Wang adopted yellow vestments and gaveprecedence to yellow in all ritual business; he also placed the beginning of the year inthe twelfth Xia month rather than the first, where it had been since the time ofEmperor Wu's Grand Inception reform (Han shu 99a, 4095).Wang did not however sponsor the creation of an entirely new astronomicalsystem. Liu Xin gave him the next best thing, which was an improved version of theGrand Inception system, preserving the basic solar and lunar constants while addingmethods for predicting planetary movements. The result was the San tong li, H^EMthe 'Triple Concordance system'. As with earlier and less ambitious systems, the Santong li began calculations from a 'system origin' at which all the elements were takento be at initial values: this usually involved a general conjunction of all celestialbodies. As we have seen, it is pointless to ask whether this actually happened at thetime of system origin, which might be many years before the system was constructed.What mattered was whether the use of the system origin together with the constantschosen for celestial periods produced acceptable predictions for astronomical eventsduring the system's currency.The greater the number of celestial bodies involved in the hypothesised generalconjunction, the further back in time one had to look to find it. According to theaccount in the Hou Han shu:In the time of Wang Mang, Liu Xin made the Triple Concordance [system], whichwent back 31 yuan jt before the Grand Inception [system origin], and obtained aconjunction of the five planets in a gengxu M$l year, which it took as its UltimateOrigin.

An account by Ban Gu JE HO based on Liu Xin's rationale of his system ispreserved in Han shu 31a, 979ff. and 31b. We cannot tell how exactly Ban Gu followsLiu's original wording. Earlier, when Ban quotes Liu Xin's summary of the proceedingsof a conference of experts on metrological numerology held under Wang Mang, weare explicitly told that Ban Gu has 'excised false wording, and selected true principles'{Han shu 32a, 955). But for our present purpose the ways in which Liu elaborated theGrand Inception system are not of major importance.The return of the quarter remainderWang Mang died in his burning palace when his short-lived dynasty fell in AD 23. Itwas not until AD 25 that a member of the Han imperial family was once again moreor less firmly on the throne. The new emperor is known to history by the posthumoustitle Guangwu jfcM 'Brilliant Martial Prowess'. There would have been little sparetime or energy for the establishment of a new calendrical system in the early years ofhis reign, and in any case there was no ideological motive for such an innovation. TheGuangwu emperor was after all restoring an old dynasty, not founding a new one. Thebasic structure of the Triple Concordance system devised for Wang Mang was stillthat of the Grand Inception system produced for Emperor Wu in the greatest days ofthe Han, and there was therefore no over-riding reason to treat it as politically tainted.As a system of mathematical astronomy, it was however beginning to show signsof strain. Even if the solar and lunar positions from which the Grand Inception systemstarted in 104 BC had been precise, by more than a century later the errors in thevalues given to solar and lunar periods had accumulated steadily until their effectswere obvious. We are not talking here about matters such as an error of a day or so inthe prediction of the date of the summer solstice: even professional astronomers wouldhave been unlikely to have been much disturbed by this alone, assuming theirobservations were careful enough to detect the error with confidence. It is clear fromthe historical record that the cause for concern stemmed from a much more obviousfailure to predict lunar phases correctly.It has already been pointed out that at this period Chinese astronomers could dono more than predict the mean lunation. But so long as this is followed fairly closely,it is unlikely that the actual appearance of the sky would reveal glaring errors. The skywould be moonless on the predicted day of conjunction, and in general for the days oneither side of it. This was no longer true in the early years of the Han restoration:"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"34  The background of the Zhou biThe [basic constants of] the Triple Concordance system had been in use from thefirst year of the Grand Inception reign period [104 BC], so it had been in action formore than a century. The calendar gradually got behind the heavens, so that theactual conjunction was occurring in advance of the calendar. Sometimes theconjunction would occur on the last day of the month, and sometimes the moonwould [already have] appeared on the first day of the month. (Hou Han shu, zhi 2,3025)Our first record of a memorial to the emperor drawing attention to this unacceptablesituation is in AD 32, but at the time it was thought that the empire was not yet in asettled enough condition for such matters to be attended to (Hou Han shu, zhi 2,3025). Thirty years later, when the discrepancy had grown worse, concern was renewed.The official calendar predicted a lunar eclipse on the sixteenth day of the seventhmonth, but in fact it occurred on the day before. Since a lunar eclipse can only occurat the true moment of opposition, the mistake was undeniable. As a result, a group ofscholars were given the task of predicting the instants of lunar phases using 'quarter-remainder methods' si fen zhi shu 1Z3^^#J. We are told that since they were unableto decide on a new system origin, this was all they could do. Presumably the implicationis that they used the old month-length value of 29 499/940 days, and simply began theday-count from some recent and well established datum point such as the lunar eclipsejust referred to. This ad hoc expedient did not therefore amount to the adoption of anew calendrical system (Hou Han shu, zhi 2, 3025).Things continued to get worse. Under the emperor Zhang j|£ in AD 85 it becameknown that the winter solstice position of the sun, an important reference point, was infact 5 du away from where the system said it should be, and that in general thecalendar was 3/4 of a day behind the heavens. The calendrical experts Bian Xin $|fjfand Li Fan $5£ were given the task of sorting matters out. They evidently felt able tocome to a more complete solution than their predecessors, for as a result of theirlabours the emperor issued an edict promulgating a new quarter-remainder system(Hou Han shu, zhi 2, 3026). In this he refers several times to the authority of the chanwei Hil apocryphal books which seem to have become current from the time ofWang Mang. As we shall see, this point is of much importance in tracing the possibleorigins of the Zhou bi. Rather confusingly from our point of view, this system isusually called the Si fen li H^M 'Quarter-remainder Astronomical System', althoughas we have seen there were several other quarter-remainder systems before its time.From a solitary mention in Hou Han shu} zhi 3, 3057 it appears that its actual title mayhave been Han li MM 'The Han system' - a name which, if common, would be asconfusing as the alternative.During the next year the new system was given some further fine tuning in respectof the alternation of long and short months, and thereafter it remained in force until"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Astronomy, cosmography and instrumentation  35the end of the dynasty in AD 220. In the subsequent Three Kingdoms period it wasused for another sixty years in the kingdom of Shu Ho, which claimed to be thelegitimate Han successor state. But we have already told more than enough of thestory for our present purpose.Astronomy, cosmography and instrumentationThe Zhou bi is commonly thought of as the main text expounding the Gai tian shuo H^:tfe, 'Doctrine of Heaven as a chariot-cover' one of the three main cosmographictheories recognised in ancient China. I intend to question this view, not with the aimof asserting that the Zhou bi does not discuss cosmographic matters, but rather ofasking just what sort of thing a cosmographic theory in ancient China might havebeen. One good way of doing this is to ask what a cosmographic theory could beexpected to do, and why anybody should have found such a thing worth thinkingabout.For better or worse, when such questions arise any Western scholar cannot avoidmaking comparisons with the ancient Mediterranean world. What, for instance, couldbe said about a comparison between the Gai tian shuo and the cosmography constructedby Ptolemy of Alexandria around AD 150? My own experience suggests that it ismuch more difficult than it seems to think comparatively without getting badly confused.In the first place, the project of making a comparison assumes that the comparanda aremore or less the same sort of things - one does not normally compare a string quartetwith a hamburger. Secondly, when as in the present case one is comparing the presumedlyfamiliar (Ptolemy) with the unfamiliar (the Gai tian shuo) it is too easy to be overconfidentof one's understanding of things that seem culturally close at hand. Before we begin tothink about China, it is therefore worth pausing for a while to consider what sort ofthings pre-modern Western cosmographies were. What indeed is any cosmographyfor?Looking back on the (pre-Einsteinian) history of cosmography during the last twothousand years, one's first impression is that the content I have provisionally allocatedto this term is well chosen - the shape and size of the heavens and the earth, and thedisposition and motions of the heavenly bodies. Moving backwards from Newton,through Kepler, through Copernicus (leaving Tycho in a perhaps undeserved backwaterfor simplicity) to Ptolemy, the story seems to be about spatial positions, displacementsand velocities. But why should these things have seemed important to thinkers sodiverse in their presuppositions? I suggest that what we have here is perhaps a case ofbackwards projection of our own assumptions.In the Newtonian universe, which most of us still inhabit when we are not forcedto remember relativity, dynamics rules all. The machine can start rolling as soon as we"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"36  The background of the Zhou biknow the masses of the bodies in the universe and have full information about whereobjects are and what they are doing when the game starts. The obvious demand for acosmography is therefore that it should give a full set of spatio-temporal data fordynamics to start from.By the time we get back to Kepler we can no longer feel so confident that weknow what is going on. The ellipses of the planetary orbits round the sun are stillthere, but the familiar dynamics has gone. Instead, the Mysterium Cosmographicumrationalises the relative sizes of the orbits by attempting to show that they fit betweenthe series of elementary regular solids, and Kepler goes on in the Harmonice Mundi tosuggest that their speeds can be related to the musical scale. Is it safe to assume thatthe spatio-temporal statements made by Newton and Kepler are simply different answersto the same question? With Copernicus (that is, the real Copernicus rather than theauthor of the imaginary simplified schemes of popular histories) my sense of alienationdeepens. The sun is still in its familiar central position, but it becomes more and moredifficult to feel that the cosmographer is simply trying to give us a snapshot of thedisposition of the major constituents of the cosmos in time and space. One of Copernicus'constraints, that his scheme should predict the observations of a terrestrial observer, isfamiliar enough. But what of the other commitment which we meet for the first timein our backwards journey, that all motions shall be produced by combinations (howevercomplex) of uniform circular motions? Faced with the amazing elaboration of theresulting celestial machinery, it becomes difficult to believe that Copernicus is reallytelling us that the universe is actually like that, in the literal and grammatical sense.When we get back to Ptolemy, the complexity of epicycles, deferents and eccentricsdiminishes somewhat. But in fact the problem we met with Copernicus is worsened.Ptolemy is clearly in simple earnest when he argues that the earth is a sphere, and thatit is at rest in the centre of the universe.32 But what can he mean by a lunar theorywhich predicts the path of the moon through the sky quite well, but makes its distancefrom the earth vary by a factor of two although to the naked eye its apparent size isconstant?33 Ptolemy's account is ostensibly realist, but much of what seems at firstsight to be the apparatus of a physical cosmography looks more like an essentiallycomputational structure, at least as far as the super-lunary part of the cosmos isconcerned.34Perhaps we need to clear our minds a little on the question of what Greek astronomerswere up to before we compare them with their Chinese colleagues. We are familiar32 Toomer (1984), 4-7, 40-5.33 Neugebauer (1975), vol. 1, 88, and Lloyd (1973), 127-8.34 Thus in most of Ptolemy's writing 'all planetary orbits are treated separately, assuming for each one ofthem a radius R = 60 for the deferent', Neugebauer (1975), vol. 2, 917."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Astronomy, cosmography and instrumentation  37with the standard story of the development of Greek astronomical thinking: Eudoxus(active 365 BC) was, as Dicks saysthe first Greek astronomer of whom we have direct evidence that he worked withand fully understood the concept of the celestial sphere, and the first to haveattempted the construction of a mathematically based system that would explainthe apparent irregularities in the motions of the sun moon and planets as seen fromthe earth. (Dicks (1970), 153)Later Apollonius (c. 200 BC) provided the kinematic apparatus of eccentrics,epicycles and deferents that replaced Eudoxus's homocentric spheres, and withHipparchus (c. 150 BC) a flow of information from Babylonia provided a firm basisof systematic data which Ptolemy's scheme exploited fully. Now it is a commonplacethat Babylonian astronomers operated without (so far as we can tell) any significantscheme of cosmography as an underpinning to their complex arithmetical computations,which related largely to horizon phenomena. It is usual to take it that their role inPtolemy's work was simply to provide reliable numbers. But it may well be that thisevaluation is due to our own presupposition of the primacy of spatial cosmographyalong what we take to be typically Greek lines. A Babylonian might well have seenPtolemy's work differently, and I think that most Chinese astronomers would havetended to agree with him.Cosmography in ancient ChinaLike all ancient cultures, China had a rich fund of stories to explain the origins ofhuman civilisation and the universe within which human beings existed. For thepresent purpose, however, we need not concern ourselves with the Chinese equivalentsof Atlas in ancient Greece or of Tiamat in Babylonia. Such material needs the methodsof the mythographer rather than the historian of science.Our concern is largely with views that were advocated on grounds that were tosome extent explicitly and systematically argued. In many aspects of ancient Chinesethought the most creative period is the three centuries from 500 to 200 BC, roughlyfrom the time of Confucius to the rise of the Han. However, so far as the survivingtexts show, the shape, size, arrangement and motions of heaven, earth and the celestialbodies do not seem to have become the centre of much debate before the first centuryBC. But by about AD 180 Cai Yong US could write:There are three schools which talk about the body of heaven. The first is calledZhou bi jf|f^; the second is calledXuan ye J!L$£; the third is called Hun tian #5cThe tradition of the Xuan ye has been broken off. The computational methods ofthe Zhou bi are all extant, but if they are compared with the celestial phenomena"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"38  The background of the Zhou bithey are mostly in error, so the astronomical officials do not use them. Only theHun tian gets near the truth: the bronze instruments used by official astronomerson the observatory platform are made after this pattern ... the officials possess theinstruments, but lack the original books [of the Hun tian]. ... I have searched forold texts for years on end without finding any. (Hou Han shu, zhi 10, 3217,comm.)This is not the place for a full discussion of the cosmographical debate in China.But we clearly cannot avoid following up Cai Yong's mention of the term Zhou bi,and we shall see that the Hun tian exerted a significant influence on the book nowcalled the Zhou bi. As for the Xuan ye, Cai Yong makes it clear that he claims noknowledge of it, and we may as well take him at his word. There are certainly noextant earlier accounts of this term or of any ideas said to be linked with it.35Our previous discussion of pre-modern Western cosmographies has put us onguard against assuming that the 'three schools' sanjia H§C were simply three competinganswers to a single question about the spatial layout of the universe. In listing them inthe way he does, it seems likely that Cai Yong was simply following a standardChinese doxographic procedure going back as far as the end of the second centuryBC. At that time Sima Tan R] JSfj£ arranged the documents of pre-Han thinkers intosix schools, jia.36 The result has been a source of confusion for many later scholars,since Sima Tan's listing has led scholars to treat (for instance) a well-defined andself-conscious group such as the Mohists on the same terms as the miscellaneousgroup of cosmologists, diviners and 'masters of [special] arts' fang shi Tif dr who areusually lumped together as the 'Yinyang school'.37We can hope to avoid such confusion in the present case by asking whatcircumstances produced the doctrines and practices referred to here as the Zhou bi andHun tian, and what purposes they served. I shall suggest that the key to understandingtheir different roles and statuses lies in the relations between three ingredients ofastronomical theory and practice:(1) Cosmographic theory.(2) Computational procedures .(3) Observational instrumentation and procedures.To a considerable extent these topic headings are paralleled by the way the ancientChinese astronomical literature is structured. It is not just the content of these three35 There are later texts which claim to be able to give us information about the Xuan ye, but it issuspicious that the later the texts the more we are told.36 Shiji 130,3288-9.37 See Graham (1989), 377f."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Astronomy, cosmography and instrumentation  39categories, but also their relations of interdependence which seem to vary from cultureto culture and through historical time. For Babylonian astronomers, so far as we cantell, computational procedures presupposed no cosmographic theory of any importance,and were directly linked with naked-eye observations of critical horizon phenomenasuch as the day of appearance of the first lunar crescent above the western horizon justafter sunset. For Ptolemy, Copernicus and Tycho computational procedures flow directlyfrom the structure of what are at least ostensibly accounts of the geometrical/kineticstructure of the cosmos. Instrumentation is neutral between the different approaches ofthese men: Ptolemy and Copernicus might have envied Tycho's lavish equipment, butthey would have been agreed that the measurement of angles between the sight-linesof a terrestrial observer was common ground from which they all started.In China the relations of the three aspects of astronomy were different. If one isforced into a crude dichotomy, one might say that Chinese computational procedureswere Babylonian rather than Ptolemaic: predictions are generated by arithmeticalprocedures rather than by kinematic geometry. On the other hand I hope to show thatthe kinds of numbers generated by Chinese astronomical computation are after acertain point significantly affected by cosmographic change. The real root of thedifference comes in the relation of the third division of astronomical theory andpractice to the other two. It is my contention that the differences between the so-calledHun tian and Zhou bi 'schools' in ancient China can be most clearly understood inconnection with changes in instrumentation and observational procedures. The readershould therefore be warned that the discussion which follows is structured with thisview in mind.The primacy of timeAt the beginning of this introduction, I pointed out that the primary role of earlyChinese calendrical astronomy was 'to bestow the seasons [shi Bvf literally \"times\"] onthe people'. In my view the early phase of Chinese astronomical activity, whichextended up to around 100 BC, was primarily concerned with the heavens as thesource of a series of events ordered in time rather than as a spatially integrated whole.I do not of course mean that no-one ever looked at the night sky and saw the stars inconstellation patterns against which the moon and planets moved. What I do mean isthat we will best understand the work of early mathematical astronomers if we thinkof them as primarily concerned with time rather than space.To some extent this point hardly needs arguing at all. As we have already seen thejob of early calendrical astronomers was simply to say on what days the mean lunarphases would fall, and to keep the lunar year in reasonably close step with the cycle ofthe seasons. It was not a basic demand of the calendar that they should say (for"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"40  The background of the Zhou biinstance) where amongst the stars the moon would be found on the first day of themonth. But as I have already mentioned there was from quite early on a stellarreference system for describing the positions of celestial bodies - the sequence of the28 'lodges' xiu $3. How can such a system be thought of as primarily a basis fortemporal rather than spatial ordering? To understand this point we need to considerthe actual observation procedures within which the system functioned.Lodges, gnomon and waterclockHistories of Chinese astronomy describe the system of the ershiba xiu H+/\\?ff '28lodges' in two ways, each of which is in my view open to the same basic criticism.Sometimes we are told that the lodges constitute an equatorial division of the heavens(Needham (1959), 231). In that case it becomes hard to see why the determinativestars of the lodges bear so little clear relation to the position of the celestial equator atany plausible epoch. A more cautious but still misleading type of account limits itselfto saying that the system divides the sky into unequal slices of right ascension, ratherlike the segments of an orange (Cullen (1980), 43). While these descriptions areadequate for most of the history of pre-modern Chinese astronomy, they lead to muchconfusion when we come to consider the origins of the system and its early use.In both cases the fundamental flaw in these accounts is that they speak as if it canbe taken for granted that early Chinese astronomy used the concept of the celestialsphere, with its equator and hour angle circles. But it is quite possible to do a gooddeal of astronomy without any such conception at all. So far as our evidence goes,Babylonian astronomers managed perfectly well without it (Dicks (1970), 169-70).38As Dicks points out, the innovation of using the celestial sphere as a framework forastronomical calculation and observation is a decisive event in the history of Greekastronomy, datable to some time before the work of Eudoxus c. 365 BC, and nothingbut confusion can result from assuming its presence in the mental furniture of earlierastronomical thinkers (Dicks (1970), 161).What evidence do we have of when the concept of the celestial sphere entered theminds of Chinese astronomers? We have a good guide to the thinking of an officialastronomer around 100 BC in the Tian guan shu ^HTlIf 'Monograph on the CelestialOffices' in Sima Qian's W] J§|§ universal history Shiji j£§B 'Records of the Historian1.Like his father Sima Tan p] J§fj£, Sima Qian held the office of Tai shi ~J5Z$l 'Grand38 Neugebauer (1975) vol. 1, 348 speaks of 'the working of a theoretical astronomy which operateswithout any model of a spherical universe, without circular motions and all the other concepts whichseem \"a priori\" necessary for the investigation of celestial phenomena1.

Even for Neugebauer's 'System A' it is significant that althoughmeasurements which would be the equivalent of latitude are discussed they are not given in degrees, butin a different unit, the 'barleycorn' which is apparently a measure of length: vol. 1, 514."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Astronomy, cosmography and instrumentation  41Astrologer', the principal astronomical post at the Han court. Throughout this detaileddiscussion of the layout of the sky and the movement of the celestial bodies we findno mention at all of the terms chi dao ^M 'red road' [=celestial equator] or huangdao If ji 'yellow road' [=ecliptic] so familiar from later writings as the most importantgreat circles of the celestial sphere.39 We are not, however, dealing with astronomy ina period before quantitative measurement: thus for instance in a discussion of themotions of Jupiter we are told:When Jupiter first appears, it moves eastwards 12 du, coming to a halt after 100days. Then it turns retrograde, and moves 8 du backwards. 100 days, and it moveseastwards again, moving 30 du and 7/16 du in a year. (Shiji 27, 1313)The path of the planet is not named in any way. It is significant that the angularmeasure du j£ is only used for east-west displacement; when north-south displacementor displacement above the horizon is in question, linear measures such as chi R 'foot'(Shi ji 27, 1331) or zhang j£ 'ten feet' ( Shiji 27, 1334) are used. We seem to be in asituation rather like that of the Babylonians mentioned elsewhere. In this case,fortunately, we know rather more about the astronomers in question than we do abouttheir colleagues in Babylonia. We do in fact have a description of the activities of amajor project involving Sima Qian himself, the great Tai chu i^ffl calendrical reformof 104 BC. When they started work, Sima Qian and his colleaguesFixed east and west, erected gnomons and set waterclocks working, so as to determinethe separations of the 28 lodges in the four quarters [of the heavens] (Han shu 21a,975)This description neatly encapsulates an impression that we could reinforce frommany other sources, including the Zhou hi itself: the primary instrument of the earlyChinese astronomer was the gnomon, whether used to measure solar shadows, or ashere for stellar observations. To understand the role of the gnomon in relation to thestars, we have to recall that unlike the Babylonian astronomer who was primarilyinterested in horizon phenomena, his Chinese counterpart took special note of whatwe would call meridian transits. Like the archetypal Chinese emperor on his throne,the Chinese astronomer 'faced south' and observed which heavenly bodies crossed his39 The nearest we get to anything that could be a reference to the ecliptic as the average path of theplanets through the sky is the statement that 'When the moon follows the zhong dao ^Ji\"middle road\",there will be peace and harmony1 (Shiji 27, 1331). But the Tang commentator takes this as no more thana reference to the path taken by the moon through the asterism Fang (n Scorpii and other stars). A similarreference occurs at Shiji 27, 1299, where the reference is clearly to an individual asterism rather than to acomplete track round the heavens."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"42  The background of the Zhou binorth-south sightline as the diurnal rotation of the heavens carried them from east towest.40 A body which is just on the meridian is said to be 'centred' zhong *fi.As already mentioned, the most ancient complete repertoire of 'centred stars'zhong xing ^M is to be found in the Yue ling E\\4? chapters of the third century BCLit shi chun qiu B.R#^(- For each month we are given the name of one lodge whichis 'centred' at dusk when the stars first become visible, and one which is 'centred' atdawn just before they disappear in the light of the rising sun. Clearly in such a case weare only dealing with fairly rough indications, particularly since the position of aparticular lunar month relative to the cycle of the seasons (and hence to the cycle ofdusk or dawn transit stars) can 'float' by up to thirty days even if intercalation is beingrun efficiently. For such purposes I doubt whether a formal sightline would have beenessential, but a gnomon and a well-defined north-south line as described in Zhou bisection #G would clearly help to reduce ambiguity.But how does one determine the 'separations' xiang ju ffiEE of the 28 lodgesquantitatively, and how does one define the position of other bodies within the lodgesystem? The answer clearly lies in the waterclock used by Sima Qian and his colleagues.The use of this instrument for timing star transits is confirmed in another account ofHan practice:The orifice vessel serves as a clepsydra, and the floating arrow serves [to mark] theke %\\\\ [there were 100 ke to the day]. Set the clepsydra running and count the ke toobserve the centred stars (Hou Han shu, zhi 3, 3056)About 140 BC Hipparchus seems to have been working on generally similar lines.The final chapter of his Commentary to Aratus lists stars culminating as closely aspossible to one hour intervals; this has been taken to suggest that Greek astronomerscould time such an interval by waterclock to within a half minute of accuracy.41 Bysimply timing the intervals between the transits of the determinative stars of lodges, itis easy to determine their width in du, given that the total width of all lodges must be365 1/4 du. The longest interval that would have needed to be timed was about twohours in the case of the lodge Well, which extends over some 30 du. Some smallerlodges would pass the meridian in about 15 minutes. The figure of 365 1/4 du isanother case of a time interval appearing to us as angle - it is plainly derived from thenumber of days required for the sun to return to its starting place among the lodges,40 The connection between the southwards position of the ruler and the observation of meridian transitsof stars is made explicitly by Liu Xiang Slfp] (77 BC-AD 6) in his Shuo yuan t&JK, 18, 3a in the Sibucongkan edn.41 See Dreyer (1953), 161, and Neugebauer (1975) vol. 1, 279. For an account of some surviving Handynasty clepsydras see Chen Meidong (1989). It is of course unlikely that we will ever recover anexample of a clepsydra used by early Chinese astronomers; those we do find will most probably be thoseused for bureaucratic or domestic purposes."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Astronomy, cosmography and instrumentation  43precession being of course ignored at this period. In terms of spherical astronomy, thistiming process is equivalent to determining the differences of the determinative starsin right ascension.The point, however is precisely that we must not think in terms of sphericalastronomy, since it looks very much as though early Han astronomers and theirpredecessors had not yet begun to think of the heavens as spherical. Those measurementsin du which we unconsciously translate into angular terms seem for them to have beenconcerned with time intervals rather than spatial measurements. A measurement in duessentially tells you the time interval between the meridian transits of two celestialbodies on the same night. Indeed, if it was not for the fact that the times of dusk anddawn change from day to day, a measurement of (say) 10 du could be interpreted verysimply as meaning that ten days would elapse between the dusk or dawn meridiantransits of the bodies concerned. It is a plausible conjecture that such approximatemeasurements actually lie behind the origin of the lodge system and the use of the duas a celestial measure.Given only the evidence so far discussed, it is already fairly clear that it is not safeto assume that early Han astronomers such as Sima Qian thought in terms of thecelestial sphere. But apart from what we can learn from the Zhou hi itself, we alsohave concrete evidence in the form of what are clearly schematic models of acosmography which correlates with gnomon and waterclock transit observations. Theseobjects are the subject of the next section.The shi cosmic modelXi ^ and He f P, the archetypal official astronomers, were (it will be recalled) chargedwith delivering 'the seasons [shi Bvf, literally \"times\"] to the people1. Throughout thehistory of traditional China, the problem of selecting the most favourable time for agiven activity was also the principal task of diviners, often operating at less exaltedlevels of society than court astronomers. From at least the early Han dynasty suchdiviners used instruments known as shi ^. Specimens of these objects excavated inrecent decades reveal a pattern of thought that is clearly related to the astronomicalpractices outlined above, as well as to the contents of the Zhou bi.42To some it may seem odd that equipment used for what we would now callfortune-telling might have any relevance to the history of cosmographic thinking, or tothe history of science generally. The most obvious objection to such an attitude is that42 I have discussed my views on these objects at length in Cullen (1981); detailed arguments will not berepeated here.

No detailed argument on this point is necessary here. In the ancientMediterranean world one has only to think of the Stoics, for whom a faith in thepossibility of divination was a necessary consequence of their conviction that thecosmos was a unified whole in which an unbreakable chain of cause and effect couldbe discerned. For ancient China, as we have seen, the status of the Book of Changefrom the Han dynasty onwards shows us how far divinatory schemes were bound upwith the cosmology that expressed the ideology of the centralised imperial state.43More importantly, however, a dismissive attitude towards divination ignores thepossibility that technical 'specialists' fang shi 75* ± such as diviners may have been justthe people who were likely to have concerned themselves with the topics on which ourinterest now centres. Angus Graham has argued this point in connection with theorigins of Yinyang and Five Phase concepts:Cosmological speculation, which is at the beginning of Greek philosophy, enteredthe main current of Chinese thought only at the very end of the classical period.Down to about 250 BC it belongs to a world right outside the philosophical schools,that of the court historiographers, astronomers, diviners, physicians, andmusicmasters [...].

But if the cosmographical discussions we beginto discern from the first century BC onwards have roots in earlier thought, these rootsare certainly not located in any of the mainstream pre-Han philosophical works whichhave come down to us.44 We should not therefore be surprised when the materialevidence points in a different direction, and this is what I suggest the shi does.Figure 2 shows a specimen excavated from a tomb dated about 165 BC. Theobject is in two parts, the round heaven-disc pivoted at its centre, and the squareearth-plate beneath it. On the heaven-disc are marked the names of the 28 lodges insequence at equal intervals, with a sequence of twelve numbers written against someof them. These numbers indicate the lodge in which the sun should be found for themonth in question. The centre of the disc bears a conventionalised representation ofthe stars of the Northern Dipper, a to r| Ursae Majoris. The names of the lodges arerepeated round the outer band of the earth-plate, seven to each side of the square. Themiddle band bears the twelvefold set of cyclical signs, the di zhi ift^; 'earthly stems'while the innermost band carries the ten tian gan ^c^p 'heavenly branches' in modifiedsequence to fit the twelve spaces available.43 Graham (1989), 358ff.44However, in Later Mohist Logic, Ethics and Science, 23 and 369-71 Graham speculates that theMohists may have produced works on geometrised astronomy, which were either eventually lost, orperhaps in part at least eventually incorporated into the Zhou bi."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Astronomy, cosmography and instrumentation45Figure 2.

The most obvious example of conventionalisation is the wayin which the lodges are shown on the heaven-disc as having equal extents: in realitytheir widths should vary from 5 du for the lodge Ghost to 26 du for Well. In anotherexample of conventional representation the constellation of the Northern Dipper beidou iYi^* (the Great Bear) is shown at the centre of the disc, with the pivot (whichpresumably represents the north celestial pole) close to the stars £ and 5 Ursae Majoris.In reality, around 200 BC these stars were over twenty degrees from the pole - aboutforty moon-widths. The point of this arrangement for the diviner who used this devicewas probably that it symbolised the great importance of the Dipper as the wielder ofcosmic power. As Sima Qian himself put it:The Dipper is the Imperial chariot; it rotates in the centre, and looks down on andregulates the four regions. The division of yin and yang, the establishment of thefour seasons, the balancing of the five phases, the shifting of the nodes and degrees,and the fixing of all sequences - all are bound up with the Dipper. (Shiji 27, 1291)No-one could argue that Sima Qian was unaware of the plain fact that the celestialpole does not lie within the Dipper. Indeed he opens his description of the sky with theclear statement that the constellation known as Bei ji ;|b$§ 'north pole' contains thebright star that we now know as (5 Ursae Minoris, which in his time was within a fewdegrees of the pole (Shiji 27, 1289). If even he could be moved to speak of the Dipperas 'in the centre', it is no surprise to find a diviner actually putting it in that positionquite literally.What we have here is clearly not primarily intended as a planisphere designed toshow us the actual appearance of the heavens. Its purpose is simply to give us aschematised model of the basic time sequences of the cosmos. The diviner is notconcerned with the angular distances between asterisms, but merely with their sequence,and with the order in which the sun moves through them. Knowing this information,the device can be set at an appropriate orientation for any instant, and the state of thecosmos can thus be assessed.Let us take the position shown in figure 3 as an example. We are some waythrough the sixth month, and so we place the sun between the lodges numbered sixand seven. That puts it at the right hand end of the horizontal diameter of the disc. It isthus opposite the cyclical sign ww ^p on the middle band of the earth-plate, correspondingto the direction due south. The time of day shown thus corresponds to noon, when thesun makes its meridian transit - in Chinese terms, it is 'centred'.

Although this device clearly does not attempt to representastronomical data quantitatively, the sort of phenomena it represents are preciselythose with which Sima Qian and his colleagues concerned themselves, as we haveseen.But what has this to do with the Zhou bi? In the first place, it turns out that it ispossible to establish a very direct connection indeed. At one point in section #G thetext describes a procedure which involves marking out a large circle on level ground,followed by the graduation of its circumference into 365 1/4 du, each du taking up onechi of circumference. A gnomon is erected at its centre, and with the aid of a further(movable) gnomon at the circumference a series of sightings is taken on the standardstars of the 28 lodges, with the object of determining the width of each. The methodproposed involves (in our terms) a crude approximation of differences in right ascensionto changes in azimuth. It could not have yielded useful results, and the motives forincluding it in the text were other than practical ones.46 A section of the text reads:#G7 [60b]When [the lodge] Well is centred at midnight [on the winter solstice], the beginningof Ox falls over the middle of zi ~f [due north]. When Well is 30 du and 7/16 du tothe west of the central standard gnomon, and falls over the middle of wei 7^ [30degrees w. of south], then the beginning of Ox falls over the middle of chou 3: [30degrees e. of north]. With this, heaven and earth are matched together.These statements bear no more than a rough resemblance to reality in the sky of thefirst century BC. The text assumes that the standard stars marking the initial points ofthe lodges Well (\\i Geminorum) and Ox (p Capricorni) are (in modern terms)diametrically opposite in right ascension, so that when the first is crossing the meridiandue south of the observer the other is due north of him, although out of sight over thenorthern horizon. In the first century BC the right ascensions of these stars were closeto 65 degrees and 276 degrees respectively, so that the alignment claimed was missedby over thirty degrees, the equivalent of two hours of time.On the heaven-disc of the shi shown in figure 4 however, the lodges are laid out atequal intervals round the circumference and the alignment is very close to that specifiedby the Zhou bi. Thus, when the dot marking the position of Well on the disc falls overthe cyclical sign wu on the right side of the earth-plate, which corresponds to thesouth, the dot marking Ox is close to the sign zi on the left hand (north) side of thedisc. When Well has shifted through 30 7/16 du (i.e. 30 degrees) to align with wei, Ox46 As pointed out below, the idea seems to have been to suggest that gai Han methods could doeverything the hun tian could do."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"Astronomy, cosmography and instrumentation49Figure 4.

All this corresponds preciselyto what section #G of the Zhou bi tells us.Most significant is the statement that when this has occurred heaven and earth are'matched' xie WJ. It is precisely under these circumstances that the 28 lodges marked onthe heaven-disc are in proper correspondence with their names round the edge of theearth-plate. Such a striking coincidence suggests strongly that the thinking of theauthor of this section of the Zhou bi was conditioned by the schematic view of theuniverse embodied in the shi cosmic model. When we turn to the physical model ofthe universe discussed in the Zhou bi we shall find stronger connections still."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"50  The background of the Zhou biThe gai tian cosmographyWe now turn to the details of what is usually called the gai tian H^c theory ofcosmography; the term zhou bi ]S||$ is also used. The significance of the first term isclear enough: gai means the large umbrella-like canopy over an ancient Chinesechariot, and heaven was thought to be related to earth in the same way that this canopywas related to the body of the chariot. Thus in a fragment of a poem by Song Yu ;^3£written c. 300 BC we read:The square earth is a chariot (che ^);47The round heaven is its canopy (gai H).(Beitang shuchao (repr. Taipei 1962) 149.3b)More graphic still is the description in the Kao gong ji #XfH 'Artificers' record',a pre-Qin document which now forms part of the Zhou li MW. 'Rites of Zhou':48The squareness of the chariot's body images the earth; the roundness of the canopygai images heaven; the thirty spokes of the wheels image days and months; the 28spokes of the canopy image the stars [of the 28 lodges] (Zhou lizhu shu 40, 7a-7b)And the text continues to describe the chariot's banners imaging the stars of the fourquarters. Clearly the ruler who travelled in such a cosmic vehicle was expressing aclaim to more than mere earthly power. More trivially, the analogy between the lodgesand the spokes of an umbrella is obviously to be preferred to the (to us) more naturalanalogy of orange segments (see above) with its misleading suggestion of a celestialsphere.I think it is clear that the term gai tian 'canopy heaven' has links with the ancientimage of the cosmos seen in the texts quoted here. So can we say that the gai tiantheory goes back to the time of the Warring States? We need to be cautious at thispoint. In the context of the early history of science, the word 'theory' brings with itmany associations that may prove confusing and anachronistic. Do we, for instance,want to talk about Tycho's cosmography and the ancient Egyptian picture of the47 The notion of the earth as a vehicle also seems to lie behind the expression kanyu jia ifiUlK 'thosewho specialise in the [load] bearing carriage' used to refer to experts in siting - the discipline popularlyknown asfengshui.

It seems to me that the description 'cosmographic theory' is best reserved foruse when a view about the structure of the universe is being put forward in a contextof debate or polemic (whether actual or potential) in which one has to envisage thereplies of opponents who may ask for clarification of one's views, attack them directly,put forward competing views of their own, or perhaps even seek to change the groundon which the debate is taking place.49 Now in my view some of the ideas about heavenand earth which are eventually identified as constituting what we may call the gai tiantheory go back to a time before there was any controversy on such questions. Undersuch circumstances people do not attach labels to their views: they simply say 'heavenand earth are like this ...'.I shall argue that the self-conscious advocacy of one cosmographic view againstanother is an intellectual phenomenon that probably did not appear in China until thefirst century BC. On that basis, Song Yu's brief reference should not be taken asshowing that he was a partisan of the gai tian theory: he was just saying what everybodyelse knew about heaven and earth, as is the Kao gong ji. The same must apply to thestatement we find in the Lu shi chun qiu Sft#fA, a compendium of learning assembledin the state of Qin in 239 BC:The pole star moves together with heaven but the pivot of heaven does not move.50At the winter solstice the sun moves along the most distant track. It moves roundthe four poles, and its decree is called dark and light. At the summer solstice thesun moves along the closest track and reaches the highest point. Beneath the pivotthere is [then] no [alternation of] day and night. (Lu shi chun qiu 13, 3b, Sibucongkan edn)In the light of what we know about early Chinese astronomical practice, and the shicosmic models which were based on it, we can already make good sense of thispassage without having to turn to the Zhou hi at all. Song Yu's poem (about 60 yearsolder than the work we are quoting) and the Kao gong ji both give us further help,49 On this view, there is no difficulty in talking (say) of Aristotle putting forward the theory that theearth is a sphere at rest at the centre of the universe (De Caelo Il.xiii). Aristotle is so keenly aware of thepossibility of alternative views that he reviews and attempts to refute them with great care. A modernscientist is not likely to find himself in agreement with Aristotle's criteria for deciding which view iscorrect, but the point is that like a modern scientist Aristotle has such criteria and applies them explicitly.50 This is a true statement, since the pole star of any epoch is in general likely to be a perceptibledistance away from the pole itself. The Zhou bi, section #F, actually sets out a method by which themovement of the pole star may be observed. The word used for this movement is you # as in the texttranslated here. However the commentary on this section of the Lu shi chun qiu by the third centurycommentator Gao You might be interpreted to imply that his text referred to the pole star as stationary.The point is not important for our present purpose."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"52The background of the Zhou bi: Darkness!:ss>winter orbit: i^xoFigure 5.

It rotates once daily above the stationary earth,carrying the pole star, the sun and by implication the other heavenly bodies with it.When the rotation of heaven carries the sun over a particular region of the earthbeneath, it is daytime there. When it moves away from over that region night falls.The seasons are neatly explained by the notion that in winter the sun is furthest fromthe axis of heaven, and hence will be further away from the more central regions ofthe earth than it is in summer, when it is close to the axis. The cosmography presupposedin the few sentences translated here relates closely in plan view to the appearance ofthe shi models: see figure 5. In elevation we obviously have to take it that heaven issome distance above the earth, although the matter is not raised in the Lii shi chun qiu.It is striking to find this text of the late Warring States period telling us that insummer there is no proper day and night in the regions below the celestial pole,evidently because the sun is then so close to the pole that it is always daylight there."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"Astronomy, cosmography and instrumentation  53The same point is made in the Zhou hi, paragraph #B22. Although the modernastronomical explanation would be different, the fact remains that at the Earth's northpole there is indeed perpetual daylight from the spring to the autumn equinoxes. Atpresent it is impossible to tell whether these statements are the consequence of travellers'tales from the far north, or whether they are simply the consequence of a predictivesuccess by a view of the cosmos conceived on the basis of purely Chinese experience.Let us sum up the situation so far. I have argued that Chinese astronomers of thesecond century BC, as yet without the concept of the celestial sphere and followingthe paradigm of meridian transit observation, naturally saw themselves as primarilyinvolved in measurements of time intervals rather than of spatial intervals on theheavens. I have suggested that the shi may be seen as a physical expression of thisapproach to the cosmos. I have also suggested that some early thinkers were actuallyprepared to say that heaven and earth were physically related to one another in thesame way as the heaven-disc and earth-plate of the diviner's instrument. As we shallsee, the views they held were those which were later to be known as the gai tiantheory. But almost as soon as we are able to form a picture of the complex ofobservational practice and schematic thought involved, a disturbing influence comeson the scene and an age of polemics opens.The hun tian and the mapping of spaceThe revolution in practiceThere was a significant alteration in the character of Chinese astronomy between SimaQian's work around 100 BC and Cai Yong's account of the three cosmographic theoriesaround 180 AD. This change is associated with the adoption of what Cai refers to as'the hun tian W^\\ and it may be seen as a threefold process:(1) Astronomers came to perceive the heavens as a vast rotating sphere, withthemselves at the centre, rather than as a rotating umbrella-like cover overhead,with themselves some distance away from its axis.(2) New observational instruments were adopted, consisting of combinations ofgraduated rings with adjustable sights, making up what are now called armillaryspheres.(3) In observational technique, the emphasis shifted from timing successive meridiantransits to the measurement of angular separations between heavenly bodies,conceived as distances between points on the celestial sphere. Instead of being aspecialised measure of what were essentially time intervals between transits,interpreted as increments of rotation of the heavenly disc, the du was generalised"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"54  The background of the Zhou biso that it could be used (for example) for the angular distance from a given star tothe north celestial pole.The first two innovations were inextricably bound up together as complementaryaspects of the change in astronomical practice outlined in (3). We may recall that thesituation in the ancient Mediterranean was rather different. Despite the deep changesin astronomical theory between Eudoxus (365 BC) and Ptolemy (AD 150), all Greekastronomers during this period were agreed that their observational data fundamentallyconsisted of angles between the sightlines of a terrestrial observer. Ptolemy had betterinstruments for making such observations than Eudoxus (who some scholars feel hadnone at all), but the differences in instrumentation between the two astronomers hadno essential connection with their differences in astronomical theory.In my view, however, the neat distinction between cosmographical theory andinstrumentation does not hold in China at this period.51 There is therefore little point intrying, as some scholars have done, to find ways of telling whether an otherwiseunspecified reference to 'the hun tian' points to hun tian instruments, or to thecosmographical theory so named. The presence of one entails the presence of theother, since they were both essential parts of a fundamentally new approach toastronomical practice involving the measurement of space rather than time.This discussion is not a general history of the development of early Chineseastronomical theory and practice, but must necessarily limit itself to the minimumnecessary to make sense of the development of the Zhou bi. Nevertheless, to do thisproperly we need to follow the story of the coming of the hun tian in its essentialoutlines. To see this story most clearly I suggest that instead of looking first foroccurrences of the words 'hun tian' we should look first for signs of the changes inastronomical practice that I contend were the more fundamental aspects of the overallprocess. As in the case of the gai tian, it is by no means certain that the existence of aparticular way of doing astronomy does not considerably predate the coining of adescriptive label for it.What, then, is the kind of thing we shall be looking for? In the first place, as Ihave already mentioned, an infallible sign of the presence of the spherical heaven inthe astronomer's mind is when he begins to use the du Jg as a generalised angular (orat least pseudo-angular) measure for the separation of points on the heavens. Secondly,the emergence of the celestial equator and ecliptic as great circles of equal status issomething that only makes sense in the context of a spherical heaven. Thirdly, and byno means least, we expect to find references to the development of instruments designedto measure angles in the new way.51 Thus when in section #G the Zhou bi attempts to find ways to smuggle measurements of north polardistance in du into the gai tian cosmos it can only do so at the cost of considerable subterfuge anddistortion, since its cosmography rules out the use of hun tian instruments."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"Astronomy, cosmography and instrumentation  55We shall shortly see that the first century BC was a critical period for suchinnovations as these. There are however few if any signs of this in the astrological andcalendrical monographs of the Han shu MWt, compiled by Ban Gu KEISI (AD 32-92)and his sister Ban Zhao KEHg (AD ?48-?116) as a history of the Western Han dynasty(202 BC-AD 9). One reason for this may be that Ban Gu based his account ongovernment records that did not fully reflect innovation at the margins of officialastronomical activity. Much of his material on mathematical astronomy and associatedtopics is, as he states (Han shu 21a, 955 and 979) simply taken directly from theofficial reports of Liu Xin W\\W( (c. 50 BC-AD 23). Nothing in these sections showssigns of the new approach.The situation is rather different in the tian wen JKJC monograph of the Han shu,which appears to have been compiled by Ban Gu himself, using Sima Qian's monographin the Shi ji as a basis for the listing of constellations. It is here that we meet the firstreference in the standard histories to what seems to be the ecliptic. But despite theappearance of this term, there is considerable doubt as to its precise significance inBan Gu's thinking. The relevant passage deserves quotation at length:The sun has its Middle Road; the moon has its Nine Tracks.52 The Middle Roadreferred to here is the Yellow Road. One [source] calls it the Brilliant Road. In thenorth [quarter of the heavens] the Brilliant Road reaches [the lodge] Eastern Well,when it is closest to the north pole; in the south [quarter] it reaches [the lodge] Ox,when it is furthest from the north pole; in the east [quarter] it reaches [the lodge]Horn, and in the west [quarter] it reaches [the lodge] Harvester, and [at these twotimes] it is midway [between its maximum and minimum distances] from the pole.At the summer solstice it reaches Well, and is in the north close to the pole, so theshadow is short. If one sets up an eight chi gnomon, the shadow length is one chi52 The 'nine tracks' jiu xing of the moon are further explained by Ban Gu after his discussion of solarmotion: Han shu 21a, 1295. It is there made clear that the nine tracks follow a straightforward scheme ofcorrelation of seasons (each divided into two), directions and colours. Eight of them may be explained asfollows:Season:  Spr. I/II Sum. I/II Aut. I/II Wint. I/IIQuarter of heavens: East South West NorthColour:  Green Red White BlackThe ninth track, corresponding to the centre (the Middle Way, i.e. the ecliptic) correlates with yellow anddoes not fit into the seasonal scheme. Such arrangements were a commonplace of Han thought: seeGraham Disputers of the Tao, 351, 382. Any attempt to read into this a reference to such matters as the18-year cycle of the lunar nodes, or the nine-year cycle of the lunar line of apsides would obviously be agross anachronism. All that can be deduced from Ban Gu's discussion is that he is aware that the moondoes not always follow the same track as the sun. For an indication of the inchoate state of Chinese ideason lunar motion around the time that Ban Gu wrote, see the memorial by Jia Kui MSI c. 96 AD, HouHan shu, zhi 2, 3029-30, and elsewhere in the same chapter."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"56  The background of the Zhou bifive cun and tight fen [= 1.58 chi\\. At the winter solstice it reaches Ox, and is farfrom the pole, so the shadow is long. If one sets up an eight chi gnomon, theshadow length is one zhang three chi one cun and four fen [= 13.14 chi].53 At thespring and autumn equinoxes the sun reaches Harvester and Horn. It is midway[between its maximum and minimum distances] from the pole, so the shadow ismidway; if one sets up an eight chi gnomon the shadow length is seven chi threecun and six fen [= 7.36 chi].54 These are the differences in the sun's distance fromthe pole, and the rules for the length of the shadow. Distances from the pole arehard to ascertain, so one has to use the shadow. It is the shadow that enables one toknow the sun's north and south [displacements]. (Han shu 21a, 1294)It is certainly a little hard to know what to make of this. The path of the sunthrough the constellations is certainly given a name - three names in fact - and thesecond of these names is the one which in later accounts definitely refers to the greatcircle of the ecliptic on the celestial sphere. There must however be some doubt as towhether that is how Ban Gu thinks of it. He specifically rules out the possibility ofmeasuring the sun's north polar distance, which is nowhere given an value in angularmeasure, and states instead that one must rely on gnomon measurements. This isprecisely the approach of the Zhou bi, which also states that the sun is in the lodgesOx and Well at the solstices, and that it is then at its extreme distances from the pole.55A further passage may be quoted to reinforce the impression that Ban Gu is still doingastronomy the old way:The motion of the sun cannot be pointed out and known [i.e. by direct observation].Therefore one uses the [dusk centred] stars at the two solstices and two equinoxesas means of observation ... [there then follows a listing of the degrees of each lodgewhich should cross the meridian at dusk at the relevant times of the year, withdivinatory interpretations of the significance of these phenomena occurring earlyor late]. (Han shu 21a, 1295)Clearly however, anybody with an armillary instrument could in fact observe theposition of the sun directly, either by measuring its north polar distance as it crosses53 Taking the solstitial shadows together, they imply a latitude of observation of 34.9 degrees north, anda value of 23.7 degrees for the obliquity of the ecliptic. Both are reasonable values for the region of theHan capitals and the first century AD.54 The equinoctial shadow length given here is clearly not an observed value, but is simply the mean ofthe solstitial values. The same procedure is followed in the Zhou bi: see for example section #H, whichhas the value 7.55 chi as the mean of solstitial values of 13.5 and 1.6 chi.55 Paragraph #D5. Section #G is of course trying to do more than Ban Gu when it produces its fakedmethod for measuring north polar distances of the sun at the solstices and equinoxes, quantities which arenot mentioned at all in the Han shu."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Astronomy, cosmography and instrumentation  57the meridian, or (in conjunction with a waterclock) deducing in which lodge it waslocated.Taking all this evidence together, Ban Gu's only advance on Sima Qian seems tobe that he gives the path of the sun through the constellations an unambiguous name.We have already seen that Sima Qian may have done that in any case, and the merenaming of the solar path is not sufficient for us to deduce the use of hun tian methods.56If Ban Gu's monograph was the only piece of astronomical writing from the firstcentury AD, we would have to conclude that there was as yet no sign of hun tianastronomy. But this is certainly not the case, as we shall see.It will be recalled that the year AD 85 marked the final abandonment of the SanTong Li H^M, and the reintroduction of a calendrical system of the quarter-remaindertype. A few years later in AD 92, the year of Ban Gu's death, we have a memorial byJia Kui MS on matters relating to innovations in calendrical astronomy, which ispreserved for us in the monograph by Sima Biao W] JSl^ (third century AD) now tobe found in the Hou Han shu. It does not take very long before we recognise that JiaKui's material shows unambiguous evidence of hun tian practices. Near the beginningof his memorial he is discussing the position of the sun at the winter solstice:Mr. Shi's E [i.e. Shi Sheris E^] Xing jing MM 'Canon of the Stars' says: 'TheYellow Road curves through the beginning of Ox, then straightens out through thetwentieth du of Dipper, which is 25 du further from the pole than the [correspondingpoint] on the Red Road, i.e. the twenty-first du of Dipper.'57 {Hou Han shu, zhi 2,3027)We hardly need further evidence: Jia Kui is obviously familiar with the ecliptic,the equator (which is what 'Red Road' now clearly means), and the concept of switchingreference from one great circle to the other. We also have the du now used to measurenorth polar distances. It is hard indeed to reconcile such writing with that of Ban Gu afew years earlier. One explanation that suggests itself is that, as a historian, Ban Gubased his account on what he found in Western Han sources rather than the practice of56 It is also notable that Ban Gu says nothing that could be taken as a reference to the celestial equator.If he had had the celestial sphere in mind, he would surely have wanted to reserve the term 'Middle Road1for that great circle rather than for the ecliptic. Indeed he actually uses the later term for the equator 'theRed Road1 chi dao ^M as a name for one of the moon's 'nine tracks'.57 I punctuate this text with Yabuuchi (1969), 52, whereas the editors of the Beijing edition end thequote after '25 du\\ This means that one would have to say that the twenty-first du of Dipper was 25 dufrom the pole, which would be grossly in error. This quantity is obviously the obliquity of the ecliptic, asconfirmed by Jia Kui's repetition of this datum on p. 3029, columns 7 and 8. My interpretation of zhi Mas 'straighten out1 reads the text as saying that as the ecliptic passes through the real solstitial position(which for Shi Shen is clearly the twentieth du of Dipper on the ecliptic) it is aligned parallel to theequator: see the identical usage by Jia Kui (same reference) and in Zhang Heng's Hun yi quoted in Hanshu, zhi 3, 3076-7 ninth column.

We have already seen evidence thathe did just that. But, as we shall see, the tone of Jia Kui's writing suggests that towardsthe end of the first century AD court astronomers were regarded as less than progressive,and it may well be that Ban Gu's account was simply based on obsolete informationobtained through 'the proper channels'.We are fortunate in that Jia Kui's discussion goes on to review the history ofvarious astronomical problems, and in so doing gives us essential information aboutchanges in astronomical practice related to hurt tian thinking. Thus he tells us a littlelater on:Your servant has previously submitted a memorial pointing out that when Fu Anf$^and his colleagues used the tYellow Road to measure the [positions of] sunand moon at half and full moons, they were mostly correct. But the astronomicalofficials, who only used the Red Road, were not in agreement with the sun andmoon. They were often more than a day wrong in comparison with the presentsystem, and all they could do was to memorialise this as being a portent, even tothe extent of making out that the sun had moved retrograde! On the Yellow Roadthe degrees of motion turn out naturally, and no such 'portents' occur. ... I havepreviously answered that at the winter solstice the sun is 115 du from the pole, thatat the summer solstice it is 67 du from the pole, and that at the spring and autumnequinoxes it is 91 du from the pole. (Hou Han shu, zhi 2, 3029)He then proceeds to tell us more about the differences between the motions of thesun and moon when referred to the ecliptic and equator, ending by noting that all wasjust as Fu An had said, and that twelve experts whom he had consulted on the questionconcurred in saying:The [official] star maps are made by the 'compass method' gui fa $t£fe,58 but thesun and moon really follow the ecliptic. The officials do not have the [appropriate]instruments, and do not know how to go about the business. (Hou Han shu, zhi 2,3029)Jia Kui's energetic polemic paid off, for nine years later in AD 103 the order wasgiven to construct 'the Grand Astrologer's ecliptic bronze instrument', and we aregiven the extensions allocated to the 28 lodges on the ecliptic of the new device. But itseems that the astronomical officials did not welcome devices imposed on them byoutsiders, for we read that the officials found the new instrument 'difficult for makingobservations' and largely neglected to use it (Hou Han shu, zhi 2, 3029-30).At this point we may pause for a moment and sum up. Writing near the end of the58 We are perhaps to imagine some kind of planisphere, with the celestial pole at the centre and a circlecentred on it graduated in du. Such graduations would be the equivalent of our right ascension, which JiaKui sees as graduations marked on the equator."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Astronomy, cosmography and instrumentation  59first century AD Ban Gu gives an account of astronomy that is in no way inconsistentwith the gai tian style of thought and practice followed by Sima Qian two hundredyears before. The conservatism of the official astronomers of this period encounteredby Jia Kui reinforces our suspicion that they might have been Ban Gu's source ofinformation.59 At the same time, it is clear that an essentially unofficial group hadcommitted themselves to the hun tian way of doing astronomy, and were pressing forits official adoption. Having set up this relatively firm benchmark based on the evidenceof astronomical practice, we can turn to the doxographical evidence with less risk ofconfusion.Polemics on the hun tianIt takes two sides to have a satisfactory argument. The problem with the material justdiscussed is that the officials with their old fashioned views present a sitting target,whether to the modern reader's condescension or the eager advocacy of Jia Kui. Didnobody of any intellectual reputation set themselves up to defend the old views? Theanswer seems to be 'Yes, but not for long'. It seems that around the time of WangMang 3i# (r. AD 9-23) two friends talked about these matters in some detail.Enough fragmentary references to their discussions have come down to us for us tosee how one of them changed his mind. The account comes from a fragment of thelost book XinLun fflw New Discussions'by Huan Tan gt? (40 BC-AD 30):That most perceptive of men Yang Ziyun HI\"?H [i.e. Yang Xiong tUSt, 53BC-AD 18] based himself on the explanations of the multitude of [previous]scholars, and took it that the heavens were a cover (gai H) always rotatingleftwards [i.e. when one faces the pole], with the sun moon and stars following itfrom east to west. So he drew a diagram of its form with the graduations of itsmovements, and checked it against the four seasons, the calendrical constants, duskand dawn and day and night. His wish was to give men of his own day a standard,and to pass on a method to those who came later.I raised the following objections: At the spring and autumn [equinoxes] dayand night should be equal. The sun rises due east at mao $\\l and sets due west at59 Jia Kui's references to official astronomers using the Red Road (equator) to reckon the motions of thesun and moon when they should have used the Yellow Road (ecliptic) may leave us with the impressionthat they were still basically using a hun tian approach, although their instruments lacked the eclipticcircle. The implication would then be that they traced the motions of the sun and moon on the equatorialring. This is however not likely to have been the case. As Ban Gu's account makes clear, the officialswere perfectly well aware that the path of the sun and moon varied in its distance from the pole. I suggestthat he is simply translating their essentially gai tian approach into his own hun tian terms. He would seetheir use of the old system of the du as a measure of the rotation of heaven as essentially the same aslaying out the lodges along the equatorial ring. It does not follow that the official astronomers thoughtthat way too."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"60  The background of the Zhou biyou j§. But if we look at this from [your] cosmic perspective [we are talkingabout] the east-west line of the human [observer], not the east-west line of heaven.This goes through the Dipper pole, which is the pivot or axis of heaven, just like a[chariot] cover having a hub. Even though the cover can turn, its hub does notmove. Likewise heaven rotates, but the Dipper pole does not move, which is howwe know it is the centre of heaven. Now if we look up we see it in the north, andnot directly overhead. But [that means that] at the spring and autumn equinoxes thesun rises and sets to the south of the Dipper [pole]. [Since heaven] is turning like acover, that means that the northern [part of the sun's] track is distant from us, andthe southern part is close [i.e. our east-west line is not a true diameter dividing thecircle of the sun's daily motion in half]. So how could the lengths of day and nightbe equal? Ziyun had no explanation.Another time I had a memorial to submit with Ziyun, and we were seatedunder the eaves of the verandah of the White Tiger Hall.60 Because of the cold weturned our backs to the sun, which warmed them for a while, and then the sun'srays moved away, and our backs were no longer warmed by them. I used this as anillustration for Ziyun, saying 'If heaven really turned like a cover, carrying the suntowards the west, its rays should still be shining under this verandah, but just havemoved a little towards the east [rather than the sun having increased its altitude sothat we are now in the shadow of the roof]. As this is not the case, on the contrary[the facts] correspond to the methods of the hun tian school. Ziyun thereupondestroyed [the device] he had made. {So the scholars who say that heaven turns tothe left are right.} (Taiping yulan 2, 6b-7a.)As this dialogue makes plain, the gai tian was doomed to failure when it wasforced to step outside its original limited role and compete with a cosmography inwhich the prime aim was spatial verisimilitude.This example is, so far as we know, the first and only time in the Han dynasty thata figure of wide intellectual repute comes out explicitly in favour of gai tian methods.Later in the first century the lonely figure of the great sceptic Wang Chong 3i3fc ishowever to be found writing polemics on the losing side in his 'Discourses weighed in60 It will help us to understand the references to the movement of the sun if we recall that court businessnormally began at dawn.61 I suspect that this last sentence is an intruded comment by a copyist who did not understand theargument.62 Other material is known which bears some relation to their dialogue.

In this latter, Yang Xiong is shown (presumably after his conversion) as making eight objectionsagainst the gai tian] these are mostly quite cogent on physical grounds, and include such points as thatfrom the top of a high mountain a water level reveals that the sightline to the rising sun is a little belowthe horizontal.

AD 83), but his low status and general unfashionablenessin his day make his testimony of rather marginal value.63 Nevertheless he has clearlyheard of the hun tian, since he devotes some effort to arguing that the explanation ofthe sun's setting cannot really be that heaven has carried it below the earth, since thiswould mean that it would have to pass through the subterrene waters (Sibu congkanedn 11, 8a-8b). In reality heaven is flat and level, just like earth (11, 8b). The apparentrising and setting of the sun for a particular observer is an optical illusion caused by itsmoving closer to him and further away as heaven rotates with the sun attached to itsunderside: when it seems to set for one observer another perceives it as culminating.The apparent meeting of heaven and earth at the horizon is similarly a purely opticaleffect (11, 8b-10a). As we shall see, such views are precisely those found in the Zhoubi itself.Returning to Yang Xiong, it is clear that the hun tian was already making itselffelt by the beginning of the first century AD. Yang Xiong himself is the source of theonly explicit statement taking it back any further. In his Fa yan S\"tf> a work modelledon the Confucian Analects, he recounts the following dialogue between himself and aquestioner:Someone asked about the hun tian W^i- He replied 'Luoxia Hong ^HFK (fl.110 BC) thought it out (ying zhi g^ 64); Xianyu Wangren U\"f nSA (fl. 80 BC)gave it a scale (du zhi ffi/^L); Geng [Shouchang] JfJcif II the palace assistant (fl.50 BC) made a representation of it (xiang zhi Hfc<O).

Working our way back intime through the people mentioned in this list, we find unsurprisingly that independentcorroboration is harder to find the further back we go. Geng Shouchang is mentionedin Jia Kui's memorial of AD 92, in the context of his argument that the motions of thesun and moon could only be properly understood with reference to the ecliptic:In the second year of the Ganlu \"fETSt reign period [52 BC], the Supervisor ofAgriculture Geng Shouchang memorialised that he had measured the motions of63 Indeed there is some doubt how far he really knew much of what was going on, since he fails tomention the terms gai tian or hun tian, let alone zhou bi.

In view of my doubts about the advisability of trying to separate hun tian ideas from hun tianinstruments it would be pointless to argue at length as to what meaning Yang Xiong intended here -paceNeedham (1959), 354-5 and Cullen (1980), 36 and note 39."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"62  The background of the Zhou bithe sun and moon with a 'diagram instrument1 tu yi fiHtt in order to examine andtest the phenomena of celestial rotation.

There are however two parallels to help us.In a memorial of AD 143 we are told that under the Emperor Zhang (apparently at thetime of the calendar reform of AD 85):The degrees [specified in] the calendar were investigated and checked: the tu yi,the [gnomon] shadow and the waterclock were [all] in accordance with heaven.(Hou Han shu, zhi 2, 3037)The fact that the tu yi is mentioned together with gnomons and waterclocks makesit look very much like some kind of observational instrument, and when in AD 175Cai Yong refers to observations conducted in his own time with a hun tian tu yi Wz^iHlfit ( Hou Han shu, zhi 2, 3039) the evidence is hard to withstand. The device usedby Geng Shouchang in 52 BC was almost certainly a simple hun tian device of somekind. It is interesting to note that in the West Ptolemy was, like Geng, moved toconstruct an armillary instrument c. 150 AD by his need to follow the movements ofthe moon more exactly.66But what kind of device? For Jia Kui, the whole point of mentioning Geng at all isthat his instrument could only measure in the plane of the equator. An extremelysimple device - and one that might appropriately be called a 'diagram instrument' -would suffice for this. One simply draws a graduated circle on paper, and fixes it to aflat board. The board is then arranged in the plane of the celestial equator. No morethan the simplest sighting device would be required, such as a fixed pin perpendicularto the board through its centre, and an arrangement for a similar back-sight to bemoved round the graduated circumference, perhaps by insertion into a series of holes.All this is mere speculation, although there may be some grounds for taking it a65 Of course the true story of the variability of lunar motions is more complex than a simple periodicitylinked to fixed longitudes, as indeed Jia Kui notes a little later (p. 3030). But he is here engaged inpolemic rather than cool weighing of the facts.66 Almagest V.I, H351; Toomer (1984), 216.

We cannot tellwhether Ptolemy was the first to use such an instrument in the West."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Astronomy, cosmography and instrumentation  63little more seriously. The resulting object would be very much like the traditionalChinese equatorial sundial, and certain stone dials said to be of Han date do in factcarry markings and holes quite similar to those hypothesised here.67 But speculationaside, the irreducible minimum seems to be that around 52 BC Geng Shouchang had adevice that enabled him to measure angles in the plane of the equator. As I havepointed out elsewhere, Geng did not face any great practical barrier in creating such adevice, since we know of a specimen of a disc set out accurately with the extent of thetwenty-eight lodges in du from as early as the second century BC.68 All he had to dowas mount such an object in the equatorial plane and add sights. For comparison, onthe other side of the world Hipparchus (c. 135 BC) mentions the existence of a fixedequatorial measuring-ring of bronze in the Square Stoa in Alexandria.69 Of course,once anybody had set up such a ring, it would be highly suggestive in cosmographicalterms: no-one making use of it could resist the implication that half of the heavenswere out of sight beneath the earth at any instant. Once again we see the essentialunity of hun tian theory with observational practice.Of the other two men in Yang Xiong's list there is less to say. Xianyu Wangren isrecorded as leading the defence of the Grand Inception system against an attack madeon it in 78 BC.70 He headed a team of twenty men who carried out a program ofobservation over two years. There is nothing to indicate what sort of instruments theymay have used, but he was certainly in a good position to gather data for 'giving ascale' to a new measuring device, whatever may have been meant by this expression.The only reliable data on Luoxia Hong are those which link him with the GrandInception reform, and as we have seen the only pieces of observational equipmentmentioned in connection with that particular project are gnomons and waterclocks.71Sima Qian, who was in a position to know, tells us that:the fang shi ~Jj dr Tang Du Jiff |5 divided the sectors of heaven fen qi tian bu ft ^55o|5, while Luoxia Hong HHFKI from Ba E prefecture [in Sichuan £3JI|] carriedout calculations to revise the calendar yun suan zhuan li H|J$$^J (Shiji 26, 1260)This gives us no reason to accept or reject Yang Xiong's claim that Luoxia Hongwas connected with the early history of the hun tian.12 In general it is hard to know67 Needham (1959), 302-9, particularly figs. 128, 129, 131 and 132.68 Discussed in detail in Cullen (1981), 34f.69 Quoted by Ptolemy (c.

And to make matterworse, there is the further suspicion that Yang's wish to imitate passages from theAnalects means that he has to have several names on his list, with different rolesascribed to each of them.73So how far back can we go in our attempt to trace the origins of hun tianastronomy? Whatever our doubts about Luoxia Hong around 100 BC, Geng Shouchangseems a reliable benchmark around 50 BC. We may add to this the indirect evidenceof Yabuuchi Kiyoshi's analysis of data in the Xing jing Mf£ 'Star Canon1, a fragmentof which was quoted by Jia Kui in part of his memorial quoted above. On the basis ofthis analysis it seems highly likely that around 70 BC someone in China had aninstrument at his disposal enabling him to determine north polar distances - a distinctivelyhun tian feature.74 It seems therefore that we can be reasonably confident of findingthe hun tian well back into the first century BC.At the other end of our time scale, we have seen that by the time of Jia Kui nearthe end of the first century AD effective propaganda was being made to force the useof hun tian instrumentation and practice upon an evidently reluctant or simplyincompetent astronomical establishment. Shortly after Jia Kui's work, near the beginningof the second century, we have two important hun tian writings by the polymathZhang Heng StUr, in which the fully developed form of the cosmography is set out,together with a description of a hun tian armillary instrument. A full discussion ofthese documents would take more space than is justified in the present context, whichis after all confined to outlining the historical setting for the Zhou bi. Long sectionshave been translated by Joseph Needham, to whom the interested reader is referred.75A sketch of Zhang Heng's conception of the universe is shown in figure 6.The hun tian universe as shown here was in essence a sort of giant planetariumdesigned to reproduce the phenomena seen by an observer in the latitude of theinstruments, I have argued elsewhere that they are corrupt or too late to be treated as independentevidence. The corrupt text is a story (in itself slightly dubious) about Yang Xiong talking to an oldworkman who had made an armillary instrument: see Taiping yulan yfc^Fffllff 2, lla. In the confusedversion of Beitang shuchao dtS## 130, 12a the old workman becomes Luoxia Hong himself, achronological and social impossibility.

In this process, it has become clear that there were a number ofsignificant changes in astronomical theory and practice in the period from the beginningof the Han up to the first century AD. Separating them under two provisional headings,we may list them as follows:(1) In calendrical astronomy, the abandonment of the old quarter-remainder systemtype in 104 BC, and its replacement by a new system with its basic divisor of 81.In AD 85 this system was itself replaced by a new quarter-remainder system inthe context of a lively debate in which calendrical matters, scriptural argumentsand politics were all involved.(2) In observational techniques, the appearance from sometime in the first centuryBC of new instruments and methods involving the conception of the celestialsphere. It does not however seem to have been until the end of the first centuryAD that these new ideas were forced upon the consciousness of astronomicalofficials, who till then remained wedded to the old techniques using gnomons andwaterclocks, and, it is simplest to assume, to the conception of the cosmos thatwent with them.We will now turn to a detailed examination of the contents of the Zhou bi, afterwhich it should be possible to form a judgment on the origins and significance of thework in its proper historical context."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"The Zhou hi and its contentsThe textOn the whole the Zhou hi is not textually problematic, at least not in the sense that adocument such as the Mohist Canon Mo jing MM. is problematic.

As explained there, the best available critical text is that preparedby Qian Baocong Hff I§ for his edition of the Ten Mathematical Classics Suanjingshi shu KM-hHr. For the present, my purpose is simply to give the reader a briefoutline of the way the text is structured, and how the accompanying apparatus isrelated to it.The divisions of the textParagraphs and sectionsIn my translation the text is divided on two levels. I must bear editorial responsibilityfor imposing both these structures on the material. In the case of the smaller-scaledivision, the paragraph, I have tried to find easily manageable units of discourse at alevel somewhat above the sentence. In the form in which I have created them, theparagraphs are usually terminated where the first commentator, Zhao Shuang, interjectssome explanatory text. On the other hand I often group together a series of shortpassages that seem to me to belong in a continuous unit, despite the fact that Zhaoseparates them by a few characters of commentary - we must remember that theinvaluable device of the footnote for commenting without interruption was unavailableto him. This division into paragraphs is simply a device to help the reader find his orher way through the text and facilitate reference, rather than an attempt to restore thestructure of some hypothetical original text. The only exceptions to this are a numberof instances where the text is clearly disordered enough for it to fall apart into"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"68  The Zhou bi and its contentsdisconnected fragments without any need for an editor to exercise any very subtlediscernment.Above the level of the paragraph, I suggest that the text divides fairly naturallyinto eleven main sections. Apart from the fact that the traditional division of thepresent text into two chapters coincides with the boundary between the fourth andfifth of my sections, there is usually little explicit indication of such divisions in theoriginal. I have argued the case for each section division in the introduction to thetranslation of that section, and these arguments are assembled in summary form onpage 140ff. In general my decision is based on some abrupt change of topic or style, insome cases coinciding with the point at which a pre-announced list of questions hasbeen answered. The issue of how far these ad hoc divisions may actually correspondto documents with separate origins will be discussed later.To make it easier for the reader to find the original of my translated text in Qian'sedition, I have added page and column references after my paragraph numberings.Thus, the paragraph designated #D6 [47d], informs the reader that it is the sixthparagraph of section #D, and that it commences on page 47 of Qian's edition of theZhou bi, in column (d) of that page, i.e. the fourth column counted from the right.One chapter or two ?As already mentioned, current texts of the Zhou bi divide it into two chapters. However,so far as I can tell there is no evidence that this division was a feature of the originalHan text seen by Zhao Shuang, and I do not therefore believe there is any reason to tryto analyse the content and origin of the Zhou bi on this basis: see page 164.Text and commentariesThe text of the Zhou bi is accompanied by three main commentaries, datable to thethird, the sixth and the seventh centuries AD. In traditional Chinese fashion, passagesof commentary are inserted into breaks in the text, which is written or printed invertical columns. One text section could thus in principle be followed by three portionsof commentary, and since each commentator evidently knew of his predecessors' worksome of this material may be commentary on commentary. In general the situation isless complex than this.The three commentaries do not, on the whole, add a great deal to our understandingof the main text in its context of origin. Most of the time the meaning is clear enoughon its own, and where the text is obscure I cannot think of many instances where acommentator succeeds in making a really helpful suggestion. The main interest of thecommentaries lies in what they reveal of the commentators' attitudes to the text, and oftheir own understanding of it."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"The text   69Zhao ShuangAs will appear below (page 161), there is reason to suppose that Zhao Shuang Ml^may have written in the third century AD in the southern state of Wu ^, one of theThree Kingdoms' into which China was divided at the end of the Han. Wu lasted fromAD 222 to 280. Most of Zhao's commentary consists of the usual mixture of paraphrasesof the original wording, glosses of more difficult words and background informationthat a Chinese teacher would traditionally give his students when reading a text withthem. As a sample of the former, at the start of section #E (beginning of the secondchapter according to the traditional division) where the text reads:#E1 [53b]The rotation of the sun and moon around the way of the four poles: fan ri yue yunxing siji zhi dao /L 0 H 3lf?HS^MZhao comments:Yun 81 'move/revolve' here means the same as zhou M 'go round1. //1§ 'pole' heremeans the same as zhi 35 'limit'.

Once again acorrupt diagram has been restored by Qian.(3) Two diagrams, one showing a square inscribed in a circle and the othershowing a circle inscribed in a square. These occur between #C1 and #C2, and Zhaodoes not seem to have added any further explanation, if indeed he ever saw them.

Using Zhao's commentary itis again possible to restore the original diagram from its corrupt state. Whereas in (1)and (2) there seems little doubt that Zhao has supplied diagrams himself, the situationin this case is more problematic. Zhao's commentary, which lies between #D1 and#D2 clearly relates to the diagram: see appendix 3.

Even if the text is really part of Zhao's commentary accidentally promotedinto the main text (which could happen by starting the first column of a new page onecharacter too high), it still must mean that he found the diagram already with the Zhoubi. The former interpretation is supported by the fact that #D2 is followed by thesewords presented as commentary:76 Qian produces five diagrams, all of which are in my judgement successful in representing mathematicalsituations discussed by Zhao. On the other hand, my reading of Zhao's text leads me to believe that Zhaohimself only supplied one diagram, and that this was more or less identical with the first of thosereproduced in later texts.

The implication of all this is that despite the statement in Zhao'spreface we cannot assume that all the diagrams in the text necessarily originated withhim.In another case it is evident that Zhao has actually excised part of the text as hefound it, and replaced it by new material of his own. This is the shadow table ofsection #H, in which values of the noon shadow of an eight-chi gnomon for thetwenty-four 'solar seasons' qi are given. As the section stands, the shadows are foundby simple linear interpolation between the solstitial values used in the rest of the text.However, in his commentary to #H4 at the end of this section, Zhao tells us explicitlythat the old table was at fault because it failed to make the equinoctial shadow valuesequal, and that therefore he has supplied new values. Fortunately he tells us enoughabout the faults of the old table for us to be able to reconstruct it: see appendix 3.The very fact that Zhao tells us when he alters the text suggests two things.Firstly, it lessens the likelihood that he simply wrote the whole text himself and addedhis commentary as a blind to conceal the forgery. Secondly, it gives us some groundsfor believing that unless he says otherwise he has passed on the text as he found itwithout conscious alteration or excision. This impression is strengthened when hecomplains that various pieces of material do not really belong with the rest of the text:see his commentary to sections #B1, #D3 and #K5.

Its first appearance seems to have been in the Northern Song printing of AD1084. This appendix was added by Li Ji ^ft, an official of the Song ImperialLibrary, and is in the traditional format known as a yin yi i=f H, literally 'sound andsense'. Work of this kind is partly directed towards the fact that many Chinese characterscan be read in two or sometimes more different ways, giving them both a differentsound and a different sense. Li therefore goes through the text and lists problematiccharacters, for each one indicating the reading using the fanqie fzMJ] 'turning andcutting' system, in which two well-known characters are given, one with the correctinitial sound and one with the correct final sound. In some cases he adds more detailedexplanation, none of which is of great interest in the present context.Perhaps the only reason for mentioning Li Ji at all is that he enables us to feelslightly surer of the pronunciation of the title of the work we are studying. For thesecond character he gives the fanqie spelling sbu mi qie ^^W meaning that we areto take the initial and final sounds of the characters bu and mr, yielding the reading bi.Of course the pronunciations I have given here are modern ones, and we have no realassurance of how the book's title was pronounced in the Song dynasty, let alone underthe Han. But if we are to give the title a modern reading, we have some reason toprefer Zhou bi to the reading Zhou bei found in some other Western language studies.77Fu Daiwie (1988)."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"74  The Zhou bi and its contentsThe mathematics of the Zhou biFrom the Tang Jjf onwards the Zhou bi held a proud position as the first of the TenMathematical Classics. If however one was writing an old-fashioned history of Chinesemathematics based on the chronology of 'achievements', it would have to be said thatthe Zhou bi does not add a great deal to the credit balance of Han mathematics. Thereis no mathematical principle used in the Zhou bi that is not also well exemplified inanother much more systematic Han mathematical treatise, the Jiu zhang suan shu fijprJlE^cf 'Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art', which is the second of the TenClassics. The Zhou bi is only unique in its use of the 'one cun for a thousand Itshadow principle to give the distances of celestial bodies.78On the other hand, unlike the Nine Chapters the Zhou bi contains what may becalled 'second-order' mathematical material in which a user of mathematics reflects onhis activity. This occurs at the beginning of section #B, which I have called the 'Bookof Chen Zi'. Rong Fang H7J opens the dialogue by asking for answers to a number ofquestions about the dimensions of the cosmos and the movements of celestial bodies.Chen Zi PJt~P assures him that mathematics can settle all such problems, but sendshim away to find the answers for himself. Rong Fang twice returns to confess failure,and finally is favoured with the explanation he seeks. The pattern is effectivelystudent:master :: suppliant:benefactor. A similar transaction between Confucius and adisciple is sketched in the opening of the Xiao jing #l£ 'Classic of Filial Piety',probably a work of Western Han date.The most interesting part of this exchange comes in the words Chen Zi addressesto Rong Fang after the latter's first unsuccessful attempt to answer the problems heposes.#B6...

On the one handone performs the analytic task of distinguishing different problem types from eachother. On the other hand the very act of analysis brings together groups of similarproblems which may be treated synthetically. Further, one can then attempt to 'unitecategories' at a higher level by finding common structures underlying different problemcategories.79Chen Zi's analytic/synthetic approach is in fact not particularly well exemplifiedin the Zhou bi itself. It is however clearly the main rationale of the Nine Chapters.Whereas some (and only some) ancient Greek mathematicians were concerned toshow how a great number of true propositions could be deduced from a small numberof axioms, the author of the Nine Chapters followed a different but no less rationalroute in the reverse direction. He started from the almost infinite variety of possibleproblems, and aimed to show that those known to him could all be reduced to ninebasic categories solvable by nine basic methods. To a great extent he succeeded,although the contents of some sections still show a degree of diversity. It did not strikehim as worthwhile to try to argue explicitly that his methods would always work forthe appropriate problem type. In the first place, he already knew they did work - theexamples are before us to this day. Secondly, if it ever turned out that the methodfailed on a new problem, that would not have been taken as a sign that the method waswrong, but rather that it was necessary to distinguish a new problem category with anew common method for all problems of the new type - lei yi he lei fJt!^1=tS, in fact,as Chen Zi says.Computational methodsThe various sections of the Zhou bi differ in the amount of calculation they contain,but where calculations are found there are no radical differences in approach. Ingeneral it is simply assumed that the reader can add, subtract, multiply, divide, squareand extract square roots using fairly large numbers with mixed units and fractionalparts. At the time when the Zhou bi seems to have been assembled, such computationswould have been carried out using counting-rod numerals arranged in matrix fashion.8079 Chen Zi's insistence on the importance of lei Ijj 'categorisation' foreshadows later Chinesemathematicians' discussions of the heuristic importance of bi lei itH 'comparing categories', on whichsee briefly Martzloff (1988), 154. In the preface to his commented edition of the Nine Chapters Liu Huialso makes it clear that for him the concept of lei is essential to his understanding of mathematics (GuoShuchun edn, p. 177). I would incidentally suggest that no-one could read Kuhn (1970), 187-91 on howthe student learns to apply theory without the sense that he is thinking on lines close to those of Chen Zi.80 See Martzloff (1988), 194-6. Since the Zhou bi does not concern itself with the details of basic"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"76  The Zhou bi and its contentsIf we focus on the text more sharply, however, differences of style emerge whichreinforce the impression that the sections are not all by the same hand.Thus after section #A, in which there is nothing that can be called computationapart from the observation that nine nines are eighty-one, we find that in section #BChen Zi simply assumes that his student Rong Fang can cope with quite complexcalculations without explanation. In one case this involves in effect finding the half-chordof a circle from the diameter and the length of the perpendicular from the centre to thechord: see #B29 and figure 8 on page 81 below. Thus Rong Fang has to recognise thathe must apply Pythagoras' theorem, square two numbers, add and take the square root.Explanations of this process by Zhao Shuang andZhen Luan occupy about 300 charactersof commentary.Further calculations follow rapidly. Near the beginning of section #D it is explainedhow the diameters of the successive heng Hf circles may be obtained by adding aconstant difference to preceding values. As each of these is obtained we are given theresults of multiplication by three to obtain the circumference, and then dividing by365 1/4 to obtain the length of one du J$, given in li M, bu ~^f and fractional parts.Once again, details are taken for granted.Only at the end of the section do we find, in paragraphs #D20 and #D21, anattempt to follow a calculation in greater detail, preceded by the words shu yue'the method says1.81 The problem is to divide 119 000 li by 182 5/8. First we eliminatefractions by multiplying both numbers by 8 to obtain 952 000 // and 1461 as dividendand divisor. On division, the integral part of the quotient is in units of //. Since one //is 300 bu, the next step is to multiply the remainder by 3, and divide by 1461 to givethe number of hundreds of bu. The remainder of this division is multiplied by ten, andthen divided by 1461 to give the number of tens of bu. Again the remainder ismultiplied by ten and divided by 1461 to give units of bu. The remainder from thisdivision is simply set over 1461 as the denominator to yield a fraction of bu.The calculation referred to here does not fit well into the overall pattern of section#D, whose final paragraphs seem to be in disorder. It may therefore be a note intrudedby a later hand, or may have strayed in from another section. Section #E has nosignificant mathematical material, and section #F performs only simple calculationsarithmetical operations, it is hard to find any explicit reference to the material means of calculation in themain text.

Paragraphs#G10, #G12 and #G14 all give step-by-step instructions for division in the same wayas #D21. Similar instructions are given in #H4 as part of the material accompanyingthe shadow table, although in this case we cannot be sure whether this may not be thework of Zhao Shuang rather than the original text.82 Most of section #1 consists of 'themethod says' paragraphs detailing division procedures. The subject of section #J doesnot involve computation. Apart from the fragmentary and possibly intruded paragraph#K6, there is nothing resembling 'method' details to accompany the division computationsin section #K, with which the Zhou bi ends. About the only interest of the 'method'paragraphs are that they enable us to say something about the mathematical levelassumed in their audience. It seems that the reader of the sections in which they occurwas expected to be able to perform straightforward long division using quite largewhole numbers, presumably on a counting board, but that he might require help indealing with mixed units and fractional parts. As I have already mentioned, the writerof section #B seems to be aiming at a rather more sophisticated readership for whomsuch help would not be necessary.GeometrySimilar triangles?It has been common to speak of the Zhou bi as using the principle of similar trianglesin its calculations about the height and distance of heavenly bodies. Until I came towrite this section, I followed the same practice, and it is certain that the Zhou bi doesdiscuss problems of a type that a modern mathematician would classify in this way.But as I re-read the relevant parts of the Zhou bi I became uncomfortable aboutcontinuing to speak like this.The problem is that at no point does the text compare one triangle with another,and indeed it contains no noun corresponding to our 'triangle' at all. Plane figuresbounded by three straight lines just do not figure as a unit of discourse. There areseparate terms for what we would now call the base, altitude and hypotenuse of aright-angled triangle - gou fcj ('hook'), gu jj£ ('thigh') and xian >$£ ('bowstring').However, rather than naming the ensemble of all three, the Zhou bi focuses on the82 See appendix 4."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"78  The Zhou bi and its contentscombination of gou and gu to make the carpenter's L-shaped try squaie ju £IL83 This isfrequently referred to in section #A, and is also mentioned in the fragmentary section#C. If we are concerned to penetrate the thinking of ancient mathematicians ratherthan to force our own categories upon them, it seems that the term 'similar triangles'would be better avoided in discussing the Zhou bi.How then does the Zhou bi deal with the (now temporarily anonymous) genre ofproblems in question? A careful reading of part of section #B is enlightening. Inresponse to Rong Fang's importunity, Chen Zi has just revealed the shadow principleto him - i.e. that for every 1000 // further south towards the noon sun, the shadow ofan eight-c/z/ gnomon diminishes by one cun. He continues:#B11 [26h]'Wait until the base is six chi, then take a bamboo [tube] of diameter one cun, andof length eight chi. Catch the light [down the tube] and observe it: the bore exactlycovers the sun, and the sun fits into the bore. Thus it can be seen that an amount ofeighty cun gives one cun of diameter. So start from the base, and take the bi as thealtitude. 60 000 // from the bi, at the subsolar point a bi casts no shadow. From thispoint up to the sun is 80 000 li. If we require the oblique distance [from ourposition] to the sun, take [the distance to] the subsolar point as the base, and takethe height of the sun as the altitude. Square both base and altitude, add them andtake the square root, which gives the oblique distance to the sun. The obliquedistance to the sun from the position of the bi is 100 000 li. Working things out inproportion, eighty // gives one // of diameter, thus 100 000 li gives 1250 // ofdiameter. So we can state that the diameter of the sun is 1250 //.'The situation is as in figure 7, but see below as to the caution needed in usingsuch an illustration. To follow Chen Zi's mental processes, we need to attend closelyto his order of discourse. 'The base' here is the noon shadow of the eight-c/z/ gnomon,fairly clearly selected to give the convenient 3:4:5 ratio between base, altitude andhypotenuse. There then follow the two sentences about the eight-c/u sighting tube.The next two sentences 'So start ... 80 000 U are the key. 'The base' is the 60 000 //from the gnomon to the subsolar point. Since 6 chi of shadow gives 8 chi of gnomonheight, the simple numbers involved enable an intuitive leap to be made to the realisationthat the height of heaven is 80 000 li. We tend to assume in such a situation that weare dealing with something like the ratio equivalence:83 Zhao Shuang uses ju to refer to the L-shaped areas in his Pythagorean essay, although he has nospecial word for the triangular areas he discusses, which are just 'the red areas zhu shi T{C J| [on thediagram]': see Qian's edition, p. 18.

The process is moreverbal than computational. It is perhaps an example of what Chen Zi called 'unitingcategories'. A similar pattern seems to underlie the calculation of the solar diameter.We move from the fact that 'eighty cun gives one cun of diameter' to the fact that'eighty // gives one // of diameter' by simply replacing cun by //. Only when we haveto find how many li of diameter we get for 100 000 li do we need to calculate, andclearly all that is being done is to find how many lots of 80 // there are in 100 000 //.We can only call such reasoning 'an application of the principle of similar triangles' ina purely Pickwickian sense.85 To illustrate it by a carefully labelled Euclidean diagramwhen none is referred to in the text is perhaps only a way of misleading oneself furtherabout what Chen Zi is really up to.Despite the way the Zhou bi is commonly characterised, the passage we have justanalysed is the only one in which this type of problem is discussed. In #E7 the heightof heaven above earth is stated to be 80 000 li, but no calculation is involved. In thedetailed discussions of stellar observations using the gnomon in section #F, it issimply taken for granted that one can move from measurements at the gnomon tomeasurements on the heavens by replacing each chi by 10 000 // as in the paradigm setout above. On the face of it, nothing worthy of being called computation is involved.We may of course wish to believe that behind these statements in the Zhou bi therewere calculations that 'justified the deduction properly' in our terms. But the factremains that there is no evidence that this was the case, or that the authors of the textcared about such matters. In such circumstances, it is surely better history to take theancient author at his word when it comes to accounting for his thought processes.86see Graham (1986), 16ff.85 If any kind of similarity is involved, it is the similarity of 'trysquares' formed of base and altituderather than of full triangles. Notice how we move from the base and altitude on a small scale to calculatethe base and altitude on the celestial scale, then use these two last quantities to calculate the requiredcelestial hypotenuse. We do not first calculate the small scale hypotenuse and then move to the larger oneby proportion, which might have seemed more natural if the similarity of entire triangles had been at thefront of the author's mind.86 For comparison, see problem 22 of chapter 9 of the Jiu zhang suan shu A3J£ JJtfe which deals with a"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"The mathematics of the Zhou bi811\\^\\ii9 0001ihalf \\.chord ^V.103 000 liJFigure 8.

It has inmy view attracted a degree of exegetical attention somewhat out of proportion to itssignificance, since it seems to amount to no more than a garbled reference to the caseof what we would call a 3-4-5 triangle. There was some excuse for this overemphasiswhen traditional scholars were still convinced that section #A was the ancient core ofthe whole book, preserving a dialogue between the Duke of Zhou and a sage of theShang dynasty around 1000 BC. Qian Baocong attacked this view over sixty yearsago, and I shall argue later that it may even be the case that the present openingsection of the Zhou bi was the last to be added, and was perhaps intended more toimpress its readers than to train them in mere practical techniques: see page 153ff.It is however difficult to pass lightly over such well-trodden ground. The tworelevant paragraphs are therefore discussed here. To illustrate the difficulties faced bythe first interpreter of the text, Zhao's comments have been added after relevantsections of the main text, which are printed in bold type for clarity, together with theoriginal Chinese.87 In his additional commentary, Zhen Luan continues heroically until he has calculated the fractionalpart of the final result as (1/2) + (75 191 /476 790)."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"The mathematics of the Zhou bi  83#A2 [13Q(a) Shang Gao replied 'The patterns for these numbers come from the circleand the square MM BZhao comments: 'When the diameter of a circle is one, its circumference is three.When the diameter of a square is one, its perimeter is four.

Throughouthis discussion Pythagoras' theorem is used, but no attempt is made to justify it.Of course I do not deny that with sufficient ingenuity you can use the 'hypotenusediagram' to give a general proof of the Pythagoras theorem by the dissection andre-arrangement of areas.95 The point is that neither the main text nor Zhao do in factuse it for this purpose.In fact the only evidence we have for anything that could be called an ancientChinese proof of the Pythagoras theorem appears in the third century commentary ofLiu Hui W\\Wi to the Jiu zhang suan shu fii^iffWt, near the beginning of chapter nine,Gou gu £jj}£ Base and Altitude', which uses the relationship repeatedly.

It does notseem that he is using the 'hypotenuse diagram' in which the areas coloured red weretriangular.

The whole94 This point is also made by Noda (1933), 17.95 This is done quite elegantly by Lam and Shen (1984), 88-9.

When one reads certain writers on this subject it isclear that they feel that the work of China's ancient mathematicians is in some waysecond class if they cannot be shown to have 'had proofs' of the methods they used.But as Lloyd has argued strongly, the ancient Greek obsession with the impossibledemand for ultimate justification was by no means a wholly positive phenomenon,and it depended for its appearance on very specific social and historical conditions.97Why it should be thought either likely or meritorious for Chinese mathematicians tohave felt the same way is not obvious.One problem in interpreting the material of section #A is that it is difficult to findany close parallels in other ancient texts.

For our present purpose, however, thepoint is that the obscure phrases of Shang Gao can be related to the way a knowngroup of people talked at a particular time. It is also possible to produce close parallelsfrom the same source to Shang Gao's earlier references to the circle and the square,although the relation between them seems to be reversed:Weights are balanced against things and produce the steelyard; the steelyard turnsand produces the compasses; the compasses [make a] circle and produce the try square;the trysquare [makes a] square and produces the plumbline; the plumbline [makesa] straight line and produces the water-level.

Except for the graduated circle on flat ground described in section #G and thefragment in #C, all the circles discussed centre on the north celestial pole. We are toldof their diameter, jing |M and circumference, zhou ]SJ. Whenever these two quantitiesare to be related (as in the first instance in #B16) it is assumed that they are in the ratio1:3. This value is also used in the Jiu zhang suan shu: the first known Chinese efforts101 In his Kao gong ji tu #21 §3 IB 'Illustrations to the Artificers' Record' Dai Zhen attempts to explainthis passage without obvious success: 2, 12a-13b in Anhui congshu edition.

Once again, I suggest that we need to tread very carefully toavoid interpreting the thought-patterns of ancient authors in terms of our modernpreconceptions. I use the term 'angular measure' here for want of a better, but from theoutset I must state my conviction that the concept of angle as found (say) in Euclid iswholly absent from early Chinese mathematics. Now since the word du jjft, nowadaystranslated as 'degree' is found frequently throughout the book (e.g. in sections #D, #G,#1 and #K) this sounds perverse. Admittedly the Zhou bi has 365 1/4 du to thecomplete revolution rather than 360, but a mere difference of calibration hardly seemsenough to banish the concept of angle altogether.There is however a genuine distinction to be made here. I cannot now discuss theorigin of the angle-concept in the ancient West, but to anyone reading Euclid (c. 300BC) it is clear that by his time an angle had become a generalised measure of therotation of one line relative to another in the same plane. Thus wherever two linesegments intersect, one naturally focuses attention on the angles formed. Nothing ofthe kind occurs in early Chinese mathematics as evidenced in the Zhou bi, the Jiuzhang suan shu, and indeed all the ancient mathematical classics. In all the complexgeometrical problems they discuss, the focus is always on the values and ratios oflengths. The du is never used as a measure of the angle between two lines, or as agraduation for a terrestrial circle - unless (as in section #G) that circle is a model of acelestial circle.The du, then, is wholly confined to the heavens in ancient China. As we haveseen, it certainly had its origin there, either as a unit of the sun's daily motion orpossibly as a measure of the interval in days between the dusk transits of successivecelestial bodies. The same could of course be said of the Western degree: why thismeasure soon descended to earth while its cousin remained in orbit must remain amatter for speculation.103The calendrical astronomy of the Zhou biThe interest of the Zhou bi in terms of calendrical astronomy is not that it tells usanything totally unexpected.

The textbegins with a list of numerical constants, each given a name indicative of its functionwithin the system. Then follow a series of 'procedure texts', in which it is explainedhow the fundamental constants of the system can be used to predict astronomicalphenomena. As already mentioned, an important part of such systems was the 'systemorigin' or 'epoch' // yuan Mj£, the moment (usually in the relatively remote past) atwhich the heavenly bodies were presumed to have been in some standard startingconfiguration, such as a general conjunction at the winter solstice. This was the pointfrom which all reckoning began. Han dynasty disputes on calendrical matters seem tohave stressed disagreements about the choice of a system origin as much as disagreementsabout the choice of fundamental constants.105It is clear from a reading of the Zhou bi that it contains a good deal of materialrelevant to calendrical astronomy. Some sections give detailed and explicit treatmentsof particular points, while others reveal significant background assumptions. It is nothowever possible to read the text as a deliberate exposition of a particular calendricalsystem. In the first place one important point is missing: there is no discussion whatsoeverof the question of system origin. This alone makes it impossible to run a calendar onthe basis of the Zhou bi. In the second place, despite the internal coherence of certainsections there is no evident order in the treatment of calendrical matters within thework as a whole. The calendrical content of the sections of the Zhou bi are listedbelow:#A: Nothing of any relevance.#B: The lengths of noon shadows at the solstices are given. Rong Fang asks aboutthe amount of the sun's daily motion, but this question is not answered in the textnow before us.#C: Nothing of relevance.#D: We are told of the 24 equally spaced 'solar seasons' qi into which the intervalbetween successive returns of the same solstice is divided.

Paragraphs #K9 to #K11 indicate that the length of the 365 1/4 dayyear may in principle be derived by observing that the length of noon shadow near agiven solstice only repeats exactly at intervals of(3 x 365 + 366) days = 1461 days.There may appears to be some disorder in what follows. Paragraph #K12 effectivelyrepeats results given in #16 and #11 for the displacements of the moon against thebackground of the stars in a year and in a day, and #K13 points out the implicationthat while the sun makes 76 circuits of the stars the moon will perform 1016 circuits.Paragraph #K14 gives an apparently pointless restatement of the moon's daily motion.The last two paragraphs are however orderly enough. Paragraph #K15 determinesthe number of mean lunations in one solar cycle of 365 1/4 days by using theequivalence of 76 years and 940 lunations, obtaining the result of 12 7/19 months.

It will be evident how veryfar this result is from any attempt to time a lunation directly, a procedure that wouldnecessarily have produced confusingly varying results due to the irregularity of themotion of the sun and moon, and to the problems in defining phase visibility at allprecisely.In structuring its reasoning this way, the Zhou bi is in fact following the usualthought pattern of Han astronomers. Before the listing of standard constants in itsdescription of the quarter-remainder system promulgated in AD 85 the Hou Han shuhas a short discussion which is paralleled by that in the Zhou bi. In part it runs:In the derivation of calendrical constants, one sets up instrumental gnomons tocompare solar shadows. When the [noon] shadow is longest then the sun is mostdistant: this is the starting point of the degrees of heaven [i.e. the winter solstice].The sun leaves its starting point, and makes a circuit in a year, but the [noon]shadow does not repeat. After four circuits, i.e. 1461 days, the shadow repeats itsstarting [value], and this is the conclusion of the [whole pattern of] the sun'smovement. If you divide the days by the circuits, you get 365 1/4, which is thenumber of days in a year. The sun moves one du in a day, so this is also thenumber of du in [a circuit of] heaven. If you observe the sun and moon setting outtogether from the du at which they start [at system origin], the sun does 19 circuitsand the moon does 254 circuits before they return to meet at the starting point, sothis is the conclusion of [the whole pattern of] the moon's movement. If you dividethe moon's circuits by the sun's circuits, you get the number of circuits [performedby the moon] in a year. If you subtract the one circuit performed by the sun [in thattime], the surplus of 12 7/19 is the number of times the moon has performed acircuit past the sun, which is the number of months in the year. If you divide thatinto the number of days in a year, you get the number [of days in] a month. (HouHan shu, zhi 3,3057-8)Section #1 is systematic enough to be read with little commentary. It begins bycalculating the daily motion of the moon relative to the stars from the equivalence 19solar cycles = 235 lunations and goes on to make similar calculations for small years(no intercalation) large years (with intercalation) and mean years, and then for shortmonths (29 days), long months (30 days) and mean months. The results so obtainedmight be useful in avoiding large numbers in any calculations of the moon's futurepositions from a known position. Once more the lunar data are found from the use of along-term solar-lunar cycle."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"The calendrical astronomy of the Zhou bi  97The sun, stars and seasonsThe Zhou bi contains a number of statements relating to the seasonal position of thesun relative to a stellar reference system. We have, in summary form:#D5: Summer solstice sun in Well; winter solstice sun in Ox.#G9,10 [by implication]: winter solstice sun in Ox.#G11,12 [by implication]: equinoctial sun in Harvester and Horn.#G13,14 [by implication]: summer solstice sun in Well.I will discuss these references together, postponing for the moment the treatmentof one more related piece of evidence that does not quite fit the same pattern. There isa tradition of using such data as a means of dating an astronomical text such as theZhou bi. One identifies the asterisms referred to, and then uses one's knowledge of theeffect of precession to find at what epoch the sun was in the stated positions. I do notpropose to follow this line.In the first place there are obvious difficulties in identifying precisely which starsare referred to. We must not forget that the system of 28 lodges was not fixed in stone,and there is strong evidence that the determinative star of a given lodge could bechanged. In addition, it must not be forgotten that ancient astronomers had no directmeans of observing the sun's position amongst the stars. It could only be inferredindirectly from other observations. Our data are therefore already at one unverifiableremove from astronomical reality. More importantly, even if such data were originallycalculated as objectively and accurately as conditions permitted (and this is just anassumption), we cannot assume that a later text is not using traditional data rather thanup to date determinations. We know that official astronomers were being castigatedfor doing just this in the first century AD, so there seems no reason why an unofficialtext such as the Zhou bi should be assumed to have done any better.107 Clearly oververy long periods it would be astonishing not to find the effects of precession causingnoticeable changes in the contents of astronomical texts. I suspect, however that suchconsiderations will be of little help in deciding where in history a particular section ofthe Zhou bi is to be placed.108107 See Jia Kui's jf 28 discussion in Hou Han shu, zhi 2, 3027. This topic is treated in detail in Maeyama(1975-1976).108 Despite my suspicions about analyses of this kind, the reader might like to know the results of thecalculations performed by No da (1933), p. 46. Using plausible identifications of stars (two possibilitiesfor Well), he found the following limits during which the stated results held in fact:Winter solstice in Ox: early eleventhth to mid-fifth century BCSpring equinox in Harvester: late eleventh to early second century BCSummer solstice in Well: early sixth century BC to early sixteenth/mid-eighteenth century ADAutumn equinox in Horn: early sixth century BC to mid-fourth century AD"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"98  The Zhou bi and its contentsWe are on rather firmer ground when we turn away from the real heavens andlook at what astronomers said about the heavens. A series of datable texts is availablein which we are told the sun's main seasonal positions amongst the stars. It is worthwhile comparing these with the contents of the Zhou bi to see if any obvious conclusionpresents itself.We may turn first to the Yue ling H v\" 'Monthly Ordinances' chapters of the Lushi chun qiu B ]5;#fjJc (239 BC), where we find the following data for seasonal solarpositions:chapter 11 'the month of midwinter' [winter solstice]: Dipper.chapter 2 'the month of midspring1 [spring equinox]: Straddler.chapter 5 'the month of midsummer' [summer solstice]: Well,chapter 8 'the month of midautumn' [autumn equinox]: Horn .This agrees with the Zhou bi for summer and autumn, but for winter and springthe lodges one step to the west have been used. The problem in drawing any firmconclusions from such data is obvious from the fact the Yue ling refers to 'the monthof midwinter' etc. Not only are we not told when in the month the sun is in theposition stated, but the month itself is a lunar one and can therefore shift about thirtydays relative to the solar cycle. We may wish to assume that what we are being givenis a deliberate attempt to tell us a best estimate of the sun's winter solstice position (forinstance) - but once again that is only an assumption.Chapter 3 of Huai nan zi ffiffi\"? (c. 139 BC) has:eleventh month: Ox.second month: Straddler, Harvester.fifth month: Well.eighth month : Gullet.The solstitial positions now agree, and one of the spring equinoctial lodges is alsoused in the Zhou bi, although the autumn sun has shifted one lodge to the east of thatused in the Zhou bi. But the cautions given above still apply in view of the fact thatthe reference is explicitly to months rather than to specific points on the solar cycle.Liu Xin's account of the San tong li H^EM in Han shu 21b, 1005-6, may beassumed to continue the basic structure of the Tai chu li j^WM of 104 BC:Any temptation to conclude that this data set must originate in the resulting bracket 'early 6th to mid 5thcentury BC will be more easily resisted in the knowledge that the official calendrical system in usebetween 104 BC and AD 85 used the same seasonal lodges as the Zhou bi: see below."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"The calendrical astronomy of the Zhou bi  99winter solstice: start of Ox.spring equinox: 4th du of Harvester,summer solstice: 31st du of Well,autumn equinox: 10th du of Horn.Here at last we have precise agreement with the Zhou bi. But lest we should feelthat we are dealing with a simple case of an improving accuracy of observation, it isworth noting that the 'start of Ox' had not in fact been the true winter solstice positionsince the middle of the fifth century BC, since when precession had been shifting thesolstice westwards at the rate of one du about every seventy years. That meant it hadmoved about five du back into the preceding lodge, Dipper, by the Grand Inceptionreform in 104 BC, and had shifted six du in all by the time Liu Xin wrote at thebeginning of the first century AD. Clearly there was more (or perhaps less) to thechoice of solar reference points than simple observation.109But eventually the discrepancy was too large to be tolerated. In the new systempromulgated in AD 85 we have (to the nearest du, see Hou Han shu, zhi 3, 3077-9):winter solstice: 21st du of Dipper,spring equinox: 14th du of Straddler.summer solstice: 25th du of Well,autumn equinox: 4th du of Horn.Once again, however, a simple judgement will not suffice. We cannot simplyassume that all over China everybody who thought about the heavens suddenly changedtheir minds overnight, so that the Zhou bi has to be dated before 85 AD. Otherwisewhat are we to make of the fact that in his commentary to the Zhou li Zheng Xuan M~£ (AD 127-200) tells us again that the sun is in Ox at the winter solstice, and repeatsthe rest of the data given in the Zhou bilno In any case, as will now appear, the Zhoubi is not even consistent with itself in such matters.109 For comparison, in the ancient Mediterranean world Neugebauer points out that in the first centuryAD the Babylonian position of the vernal equinox relative to the stars was still in use by astrologers,despite its being three centuries out of date: Neugebauer (1975) vol.2, 594-598. Astonishingly this datumwas still being repeated in the medieval European literature as late as 1400. This sets Liu Xin's conservatismin a certain perspective.110 Zhou li zhu shu 26, 19a. It is interesting that Zheng claims that at the equinoxes the two half moonswill occur in the solstitial lodges. Clearly this would have been a datum that could have been checked bythe naked eye. This is perhaps a hint of how ancient Chinese astronomers may originally have solved theproblem of how to locate the sun among the stars: one simply uses the half moon to check its positionsthree months away (and presumably the full moon to check the position six months away). Given the factthat the lunar phases will not in general fall at exactly the required instants, such a method would beinherently loose, and there would obviously be no hope of settling the point by calculation."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"100  The Zhou bi and its contentsIn paragraphs #K8 and #K13 the 'Establishment stai* jian xing HM (71 Sagittarii)is the point at which sun and moon are located at system origin. It may therefore betaken as the winter solstice position, since most systems took this as their startingpoint. In the third century AD Zhao Shuang tells us that:The six stars of [the asterism] Establishment are over Dipper. To say that the sunand moon start out from the Establishment star refers to [a situation] in the eleventhmonth when winter solstice and conjunction fall together. Practitioners of calendricalmethods count the du starting from five du before [the beginning of] Ox, so theEstablishment star is near [this point]. (68e)Zhao's identification closely follows that of Sima Qian around 100 BC:[The asterism] Southern Dipper stands for the court. To its north is the EstablishmentStar. (Shiji 27, 1310)More interesting from the calendrical point of view is the statement by Jia Kui MMl in AD 92:In the Grand Inception system, at the winter solstice the sun was at the beginningof [the lodge] Ox, [the position marked by] the central star of the [asterism] Ox.111The ancient [systems of] Huangdi Hf^f, Xia Jt, Yin J§§[, Zhou jif| and Lu Hr hadthe winter solstice sun at the Establishment Star, which is our modern Dipper star.(Hou Han shu, zhi 2, 3027)Jia goes on to point out that for some time astronomers had been aware that thesolstice was in fact falling five du short of the Grand Inception position, and wastherefore in the 21st du of Dipper. It is important to note that confronted with thisdatum he does not suggest an hypothesis equivalent to the precession of the equinoxes.His approach rather is to point out that in addition to being in harmony with the fiveancient systems mentioned, a winter solstice in Dipper also has the backing of scripturein the Xing Jing MM 'Star Canon' of the legendary star-clerk Shi Shen 5^, and ofthe Shang shu kao ling yao JRJH^ MSI, one of the 'apocryphal books' which weremuch respected in the court of the Eastern Han. Supposedly ancient tradition andobservation could therefore be claimed to be nicely in step. Jia's preference for whatwas in his view the most ancient source makes it plain that he was not thinking interms of a steady secular variation in the position of the solstice equivalent to modernprecessional theory.111 The distinction signalled here is an important one. One star of the asterism named Ox marked thebeginning of the lodge associated with that asterism. Clearly, since the middle star of Ox was used someof the asterism did not lie in the lodge of that name."},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"Instrumentation and observation in the Zhou bi 101We may now sum up briefly. Sections #D and #G of the Zhou bi give solarseasonal positions representing the astronomically obsolete system that was givenofficial support from 104 BC to AD 85. Section #K uses a different system that is(depending on one's point of view) more ancient or more modern. Once again, theonly firm conclusion that emerges is that the Zhou bi cannot be understood as a singleunified book.Instrumentation and observation in the Zhou biThe gnomonThe early history of the gnomon as an astronomical instrument is not easy to trace,whether in the ancient West or in East Asia. Perhaps the earliest reliable referencepoint is provided by the two mulAPIN ('Plough Star') cuneiform texts from Babylonia,so named from their opening words. While the copies we have today are dated around700 BC they are said to be based on older material. In addition to other astronomicaldata, these tablets contain a table of shadow lengths of a gnomon of unspecified lengthfor various times of day at the solstices and equinoxes.112 An account given by Herodotus(c. 480-425 BC) suggests that Greek astronomers may have learnt of the use of thegnomon from Mesopotamian sources.113 The first Greek shadow tables appear to datefrom around the fourth to fifth centuries BC.114Firm early data are harder to find in China. There are references to the measurementsof seasonal shadow lengths in the Zhou li MW. 'Ritual of the Zhou [dynasty]', andalthough the length of the gnomon is unspecified we are given the value of one chifive cun for the summer solstice shadow.115 Traditional Chinese scholars believed thisbook to have been compiled by the Duke of Zhou Mfe around 1000 BC; modernscholars would place it somewhere towards the end of the first millennium BC, probablybefore or near the beginning of the Western Han. Needham quotes an entry from theZuo zhuan ~tiL\\M chronicle for 654 BC, but although the Duke of Lu H is said to haveascended to a high place 'to view the clouds and vapours' the references to shadowmeasurements supplied by Needham have no basis in the text apart from the fact thatthe record is dated to the winter solstice.116112 Neugebauer (1975), vol.1, 544.113 Dicks (1970), 166-7.114 Neugebauer (1975) vol. 2, 740.115 Zhou li zhu shu 10, 10a-l lb. The Western Han commentators suggest that the gnomon was eight chilong, as in the Zhou bi116 Needham (1959), 284. The Zuo zhuan record comes from the fifth year of Duke Xi of Lu."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"702  The Zhou bi and its contentsSome have tried to link the use of the gnomon for determining the dates ofsolstices to the adoption of the year of 365 1/4 days. Behind this suggestion lies theassumption that a good estimate of the length of the solar cycle cannot be obtainedunless one observes two successive solstices accurately. In fact fairly rough estimatesof solstice dates separated by a large enough number of years can also give accurateresults. Further, one does not need to observe solstices at all. Other more easilyobservable astronomical events repeat with the same period, such as the dusk or dawnculmination of a given star. It is such observations rather than the use of the gnomonthat are mentioned in the Yao dian HJ&, perhaps the earliest reference to the operationof the Chinese calendar.The earliest firmly dated Chinese astronomical material referring to solstices isfound in the 'Monthly Ordinances' chapters of the Lii shi chun qiu SJS^f f^C, whichwas completed in 239 BC. As with the other months, the months of midsummer,midwinter, midspring and midautumn are principally identified by the position of thesun among the lodges and the directly observable data of dusk and dawn centred stars.In addition, we have the following statements:117Midspring: 'In this month [there occurs] the [equal] division of day and night.'Midsummer: 'In this month, the longest day comes.'Midautumn: 'In this month [there occurs] the [equal] division of day and night.'Midwinter: 'In this month, the shortest day comes.'There is clearly nothing here to force us to believe in the use of shadow measurementsas basic seasonal data. But about a century later we are on firmer ground. In the bookcompiled for Prince Liu An around 139 BC we are told, amongst various data on theseasonal behaviour and growth of birds, animals, insects and plants:On the day of the winter solstice ... For an eight chi R length (xiu fl#), the noonshadow is one zhang 3t three chi R. On the day of the summer solstice ... thelength of the shadow for eight chi is one chi five cun ~^f (Huai nan zi 3, 5b, SibuCongkan edn)118117 See Lii shi chun qiu, chapters. 2.1, 5.1, 8.1 and 11.1.118 At the end of this chapter a short text has been appended which discusses gnomons in much moredetail. It has been translated and discussed in Cullen (1976). Whereas the main text refers to its gnomonas 'a length1 xiu 0, the additional material uses what is later the standard term biao 3jt found in most ofthe Zhou bi. The gnomon is however ten chi high, a length found nowhere else. This material seems tohave been added to the Huai nan zi text at some point. Whether it was composed later or earlier than 120BC we cannot now tell. A.C. Graham has advanced the plausible speculation that this section, andpossibly even the Zhou bi itself, may have originated within the Mohist school of the late Warring Statesperiod. See his Later Mohist Logic, Ethics and Science, 369-371."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"Instrumentation and observation in the Zhou bi 103Thirty-five years after the date of this work we are told that, as part of the workpreparatory to the Grand Inception reform of 104 BC, Sima Qian and his colleagues //gui yi ILS-M 'set up shadow instruments1.119 It seems therefore that we can be sure ofthe astronomical use of gnomon shadows for the early Western Han, even if thepicture is vague for earlier periods.The Zhou bi uses three different terms for the gnomon. Of those sections thatmention the gnomon explicitly, #F and #G use only the word biao fit120 In section #B,in which Chen Zi introduces the whole topic, the first reference to a gnomon is simplyas a 'post' gan ^ (#B9). In #B10 to #B12 we find zhou bi jf f$ or just bi f$, then biao^ in #B14. In #B15 Rong Fang, perhaps understandably confused, asks what the zhoubi is, and is told that it means a gnomon biao as anciently used at the capital of theZhou kings.The standard dictionary meaning of bi f$ is 'thigh' or 'thigh-bone'. Why such aword should have been chosen to describe an upright pole about the height of a man isa little difficult to see. Outside the Zhou bi there appear to be no independent uses ofthe word in this specialised sense. In #B10 Chen Zi says that while the shadowrepresents the base, the bi gnomon is the altitude, the word for which, gu J^, alsomeans 'thigh'. Any upright is, it seems in some sense a leg'. It also appears likely thatthere is a link between bi and the common word bei Wstele, pillar', which has thesame phonetic but is written with the 'stone' radical rather than with 'bone'. TheEastern Han commentator on the Yi li {HIS121 discusses the customary placement of abei stele within the complex of gate, courtyard and hall, and tells us:A palace must have a bei in order to observe the solar shadow (17 li zhu shu 21,14b)Such a link would certainly make the use of bi for a gnomon rather less puzzling.Observations of noon shadowsThe Babylonian and early Greek shadow tables mentioned above gave values forvarious hours of the day, but in accordance with its emphasis on meridian observationsall the solar shadows mentioned in the Zhou bi are noon values. Presumably onewould ascertain the moment of noon by observing when the shadow crossed themeridian line through the gnomon; a simple method for defining such a line is givenin #F7. Since the length of the shadow changes most slowly around noon, errors in119 Han shu 21a, 975. It must be said that the reference to instruments is missing from the description bySima Qian himself.120 #G4 does however mention the use of a 'displacement marker1 you yi ifffH as a sighting aid on thecircumference of its graduated circle marked on the ground. This sounds like another gnomon.121 A compendium of ritual practice which may be as late as the Western Han."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"104  The Zhou bi and its contentsalignment are not critical. In addition the only values derived from observation seemto be solstitial values, and it is near the solstices that noon shadow-length changesmost slowly from day to day. But as we shall see it would be a mistake to treat theobservations in the Zhou bi simply as raw data suitable for objective scientific analysis.They are in fact significantly shaped by theory - a phenomenon not unknown elsewherein the history of science.122Solstitial shadows The principal shadow data in the Zhou bi are its values for thesolstitial noon shadows of an eight chi gnomon. These are:Summer solstice: 1 chi R6cun^ = \\.6 chi (#B10,#D18,#H2).Winter solstice: 1 zhang ;£ 3 chi 5 cun = 13.5 chi (#D18,#H2).It is however impossible to understand the nature of these data without takingthem together with the fact that the artificial 'shadow' resulting from a determinationof the position of the north celestial pole is said to be 1 zhang 3 cun = 10.3 chi.Together with the application of the shadow rule (see below) the implication of thesethree quantities is that the radius of the sun's daily path round the pole at the wintersolstice is exactly twice that at the summer solstice: see #B16 and #B18. This isclearly not simply a lucky coincidence. The observations have been influenced by thepossibility of obtaining a theoretically neat result. Observation and theory have certainlyboth played a role, and we are not in a position to tell where one ends and the otherbegins.123With this caution in mind, it is worth while analysing these data trigonometrically,if only to see how far theory has moved them away from any practical likelihood. Letus assume for the sake of argument that the two solstitial shadows belong together.Figure ar shows how the shadow lengths are related to latitude and to the obliquity ofthe ecliptic, which is the angle between the ecliptic and equatorial planes. It is easy toshow that with the values of the Zhou bi:122 On Ptolemy's shaping of his numerical data, see Toomer (1984), viii, and also more controversiallyNewton (1977). In an age when accurately observed data were few and far between, the decision to givetheory precedence over the messy particularities of one's data made good sense.123 We have other evidence of an ancient Chinese interest in concentric circles with diameters in simpleratios in the idealised specifications for ritual jade discs given in the Er Ya Htffi see Er Ya zhu shu 5, 18a.The ratios given there relate the diameter of the central hole, hao Iff- to the thickness of the jade annuluswhich surrounds it, rou. ft If haowou :: 1:2 we have a bi M.

An inch of error in the wintersolstice shadow will alter both latitude and obliquity by about 6', whereas the samechange in the summer solstice shadow changes the angles by 20'. It therefore seemsmore realistic to limit ourselves to saying that if the shadows are taken to be aconsistent pair originating from observation they suggest a latitude of about 35° and anobliquity of about 24°.

Itfollows directly from this datum that:Latitude = 37.84°, or 38° in round numbers.If we were dealing with real observations, the implication would be that the polarobservation was made about 300 km to the north of the solar observations, which israther far away from any likely locations for an ancient Chinese observer, since itcould easily put him north of the Great Wall. Putting it another way, a polar 'shadow'at latitude 35° should have been about 11.4 chi rather than 10.3 chi.In conclusion, then, we may say that it is possible that the solstitial shadow valuesmay stem from an actual pair of observations. This impression is strengthened by thefact that these values are not repeated in other texts.125 If this is so, the polar 'shadow'must be an artefact of the desire for a neatly arranged universe in which the summerand winter solar paths were related in size by a factor of two. Given the fact that thecelestial pole cannot in any case be observed directly (see #F2 to #F4 for an indirectmethod) the degree of self-deception required would not have been very great.The Table of Seasonal Shadows Section #H of the Zhou bi is devoted to a table ofnoon shadows of the standard eight-c/n gnomon for each of the 24 qi IK,. As I shallshortly explain, it is fairly clear that the text before us is not the original, but is a124 Compare the discussion in Needham (1959), 286-91, particularly fig. 113 showing the variation ofobliquity with time. It is enlightening to compare the plausibility of the Zhou bi data with ancient Westernparallels. Thus for example around 135 BC Hipparchus gave a ratio of 4:3 for gnomon length to equinoctialnoon shadow at Athens. This yields latitude 37° rather than the correct 38°. Neugebauer comments 'Againwe see the ration 4:3 is only a convenient estimate and is not the result of careful observation. Suchprimitive data were apparently never checked: at least Vitruvius, some 150 years later, still quotes thesame ratio1: (1975) vol. 2, 746. When in the first century AD Pliny gives similar shadow data forAlexandria, Babylon, Athens and Rome, it is only in the last case that his implied latitude error is lessthan half a degree - of course we would expect him to be less critical on such points than Ptolemy.Babylon is nearly two degrees out, Alexandria two and a half degrees, and Athens two thirds of a degree.One degree of latitude corresponds to about 110 km on the surface of the earth: Neugebauer (1975) vol.2, 747-8. It is interesting that this is about the same as the figures given by several ancient Westernauthors who attempted to estimate the range within which gnomon measurements would not changeperceptibly: see (1975) vol. 2, p. 726 n. 14. I am not trying to argue that ancient China was better orworse in these respects than the ancient West. The point is rather that the Western data give us some basisfor judging how wrong purported observations can be before we have to suspect that they are completelyfictional or deliberately mendacious. By this test the Zhou bi solstitial shadows look fairly realisticspecimens.125 However, as pointed out in Cullen (1976) p. 124, the summer solstice shadow of a ten-chi gnomon inthe anomalous Huai nan zi passage is two chi, corresponding precisely to 1.6 chi for an tight-chignomon."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"Instrumentation and observation in the Zhou bi 707reconstruction by Zhao Shuang. Before we turn to this question and to the shadowvalues themselves, there is something to say on the general topic of the qi (sometimesrendered as 'solar terms' or 'solar season'), the names of which are listed above eachshadow length. The first time we meet the qi in a context of systematic mathematicalastronomy is in the list given in Liu Xin's account of the San tong li ELj$iM in theHan shu (21b, 1005-6). For Liu Xin the qi begin at equal intervals throughout thesolar cycle, which in his case is 365 385/1539 days long,126 so that the intervalbetween qi inceptions was 15 1010/4617 days (Han shu 21b, 1001). In systems of thequarter-remainder type as exemplified in the Zhou bi the interval is 15 7/32 days.Although the name of a qi can refer to the whole of the period until the next qi begins,in an astronomical context it is more usual to find that the instant of qi inception isintended.127If we begin numbering the qi with winter solstice as #1, the odd-numbered qi arecustomarily designated 'medial qi, zhong qi 4*i^, while the even numbered are 'nodalqi\\jie qi ifrSR.128 The purpose behind the system as used by Liu Xin is to providequick warning of the need for intercalation when the sequence of lunar months beginsto slip out of step with the seasons. This is done by allocating one medial qi to eachmonth, so that ideally qi#l, winter solstice, should fall at the inception of the firstmonth in the series, and so on. In practice, all is well so long as each medial qi is stillsomewhere within its allotted month. Since the interval between two medial qi is overthirty days, the situation will eventually arise when a month contains no medial qi.This is then designated as an intercalary month, and the new month number is postponeduntil the next month (Han shu 21b, 1001).A major function of the qi in the San tong li 1EL$LM is therefore their ability totrigger intercalations at any time of the year, rather than having to wait until the yearend to insert a thirteenth month, as appears to have been the practice in earlier systems.The fact that mid-year intercalations are found throughout the Western Han after 104BC justifies us in thinking that the qi system was part of the basic equipment takenover from the Grand Inception scheme.Further back than 104 BC, evidence for the qi as a complete system fades outquite quickly. Around 139 BC all twenty-four are mentioned in Huai nan zi chapter 3,126 It will be recalled that this apparent precision is due to the decision to combine a mean lunation of 2949/81 days with the equivalence 19 solar cycles = 235 mean lunations.127 As Professor Nathan Sivin has pointed out (private communication) the principle behind the qi systemis reminiscent of the 'tithV system of late Babylonian astronomy, in which instead of using real lunarmonths (each consisting of a variable whole number of days) one used for reckoning purposes a meanlunar month divided into 30 equal periods, each of which was close to a day long. See Neugebauer(1975), vol. 3, 1069.128 In the system of the seven heng circles described in section #D, the sun is exactly on a heng at theinception of a medial qi, and half-way between two heng at the inception of a nodal qi."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"108  The Zhou bi and its contentswhere however they are spoken of as following one another at fifteen day intervals:one suspects that we are no longer dealing with an astronomically precise division ofthe solar cycle. The excavated Linyi almanac for 134 BC mentions only the solsticesand the beginnings of spring and autumn.129 Before the Qin, the 'Monthly Ordinances'Yue ling H^ chapters of the Lii shi chun qiu §i^#$( (239 BC) only single out thesolstices, equinoxes and beginnings of the four seasons as worthy of special notice.Some of the phenomena referred to in the names of the other qi are mentioned inpassing, but the sense of the year being divided into twenty-four periods is absent.This brief survey is necessary because of certain slight problems relating to thenames of the qi in the Zhou bi shadow table. In the first place there is the question oforder. The qi names in the Zhou bi follow the modern order, which is also that foundin the Huai nan zi tfeffi~p.130 In Liu Xin's listing, however, the names of qi #5 and #6are interchanged, as are #8 and #9. The new calendar of AD 85 has them as in themodern order. Further, the name of qi #6 is jing zhi ifS 'Arousal of [hibernating]insects' in both Huai nan zi and in texts from Liu Xin onwards. In the Zhou bihowever the term is qi zhi I^H 'Emergence of [hibernating] insects'. The occurrenceof this term in the first month data of the Lii shi chun qiu as well as in the fragmentaryand archaic Xia xiao zheng J1/JNIE suggest that it might have been used in somelisting of the qi older than any now extant. There would have been good reason tohave altered the term by the time the Huai nan zi book was assembled under thepatronage of Prince Liu An HPJ^r, for Qi Jjfc was the personal name of his fatherEmperor Jing j|, who came to the throne in 156 BC. Use of the term for the rest ofthe Han was therefore taboo, and a replacement of similar meaning would have beenused.If therefore we assume that Zhao Shuang passed on the list of qi names to usunchanged,131 what follows? The least adventurous deduction is that whoever wrotethe original shadow table made no effort to follow the official practice of his day. Ifhowever we assume that the author followed whatever the orthodox fashion was, andthat Liu Xin's practice was also that of the Grand Inception system, the order of the qimeans that the original Zhou bi shadow table must date from after AD 85 or before104 BC. Taken in conjunction with the archaic name, we would have to go backfurther than the accession of Emperor Jing in 156 BC, so that the old table wouldrepresent the earliest complete listing of the qi.While the fact of the old table's crudity, not least in its use of a simple fifteen-dayqi interval, would be consistent with such an early date, the whole argument rests on129 See Chen Jiujin and Chen Meidong (1989).130 I am not convinced by Qian Baocong's argument in Qian (1924) that the Huai nan zi originally hadthe same order as Liu Xin but was later altered.131 This seems a reasonable assumption, since although he tells us he has altered the shadow lengths hesays nothing about the names."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"Instrumentation and observation in the Zhou bi 709the assumption that all Han writers on astronomical topics thought and wrote inlockstep. How such unanimity could have been enforced I cannot think. Assuming itto have been enforced, how could one explain the innovations that did in fact occur?In any case it is well known that disagreement on calendrical matters was commonplace,and there is no reason to assume that the writers of the Zhou bi were exceptions to therule. Looking at things from this perspective, we are faced with something of anon-problem.Let us turn now to the shadow table itself. It contains identical solstitial shadowvalues to those already given in other parts of the text, and a glance reveals that it isconstructed by simple linear interpolation between the solstitial values. Thus the twoequinoctial values are both 7.55 chi, the arithmetic mean of the two solstitial values.Observation would have given a value about two chi less than this.As I have already mentioned, the situation is complicated by the fact that it seemsthe present section #H was written by Zhao Shuang himself in replacement for theoriginal Zhou bi table. The old table also based itself on linear interpolation betweenthe solstitial values, but did so somewhat clumsily so that the equinoctial values cameout slightly unequal. The table is reconstructed from Zhao's description in appendix 4.As Zhao points out, the old table is inconsistent with the description of the seven hengcircles in section #D, according to which the distance of the sun from the pole (andhence from the observer at Zhou), should be the same at both equinoxes. It is likewiseinconsistent with Chen Zi's statement in #B19. Once again the Zhou bi turns out to bea collection of documents disparate in detail if related in general theme.We have already had occasion to note the strong resemblances between theprocedures of the Zhou bi and the astronomical practice of the Western Han. The sameresemblance can also be shown in the matter of shadow data. The basic pattern oflinear interpolation between solstitial values was evidently something that everybodyseems to have taken for granted up to the first century AD. Thus in the Han shu itself(26, 1294) we find the following set of shadow values:summer solstice: 1.58 chi.winter solstice: 13.14 chi.equinoxes: 7.36 chi, the arithmetic mean of solstice values.A series of prognostications then follows, based on advance or delay in theoccurrence of predicted shadow lengths. Although this is not one of the sections of theHan shu that claims specifically to be summarising the writings of Liu Xin, creator ofthe Triple Concordance system, there is a strong chance that what we have here areLiu Xin's own values. Shadow lengths are not mentioned in the calendrical material ofthe Han shu, which quotes Liu Xin, but we do know that his father Liu Xiang (79-8"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"110  The Zhou bi and its contentsBC) used identical values in his Hong fan wu xing zhuan #£f53£f?yfi> f°r he iscriticised for doing so in Li Chunfeng's commentary on the Zhou bi: see 30o-30q inQian's edition. Li also quotes from the apocryphal work Yi wei tong gua yan JailM^Kl§! (30o), and although he only gives solstitial shadows there is a much fullerquotation from what seems to be the same book in the commentary on the Hou Hanshu, zhi 3, 3079-80. It has the same solstitial values of 1.48 chi and 13 chi and hasboth equinoctial values as 7.24 chi, clearly the result of linear interpolation. The workof Dull (1966) makes it seem highly likely that texts such as this were produced nearthe end of the first century BC and in the first decades of the first century AD.In a Western Han context, there is it seems nothing at all unusual in the Zhou bismethod of dealing with seasonal shadows. The first example of a Chinese attempt togive realistic values for shadows other than those at the solstices appears in thecalendrical system of AD 85. Hou Han shu, zhi 3, 3077-9 gives a detailed table forthe twenty-four qi, including the sun's north polar distance - clearly we are now in thecontext of hun tian practice. The values given include:summer solstice: 1.5 chi.winter solstice: 13.0 chi.spring equinox: 5.25 chi.autumn equinox: 5.50 chi.As Maeyama has made clear nothing so simple as an outburst of open-mindedempiricism and accurate observation has occurred here. The solstitial values are thosegiven scriptural warrant by the Zhou li MWt and its commentators, as well as by atleast one of the apocryphal scriptures so influential in calendrical matters in the firstcentury AD.132 It is also interesting to note that just as the original Zhou bi shadowtable was not quite consistent with the gai tian scheme it seems from the inequality ofthe equinoctial shadows that the system of AD 85 could not quite match its numericaldata to its new cosmography.There is therefore nothing very odd about the Zhou bi shadow table data in aChinese context. Evidence from the ancient West gives revealing parallels. One earlyGreek table (fourth or fifth centuries BC) gives seasonal shadow lengths for each ofthe twelve signs of the zodiac, using linear interpolation between solstitial values of 8feet and 2 feet. This yields equinoctial values of 5 feet.133 As Neugebauer comments:132 See the Shang shu kao ling yao fniilr^ilBS, quoted by Li Chunfeng in his Zhou bi commentary, 30f.in Qian's edition.133 The height of the gnomon is unstated: six feet would do for Athens, but a later text uses seven feet,which would suggest Babylon or Rhodes for the values given. The table also gives shadow lengths (againproduced by a simple arithmetical scheme) for the hours of the day other than noon, the purpose evidentlybeing to provide a simple method of telling the time.

(Neugebauer (1975) vol. 2, 736 )The surprising thing about Europe is that, despite the great advantage possessedby Western astronomers after the Greek development of trigonometry, the use of suchsimple shadow tables continued to be popular long into the Middle Ages, although inprogressively distorted form as generations of ecclesiastical copyists did their work.134The shadow ruleWe have already met the 'one cun for a thousand It shadow rule by means of whichseveral sections of the Zhou bi link measurements made at the gnomon to distances ona cosmic scale. The first piece of astronomical information given by Chen Zi to RongFang is:#B9 [26a]'16 000 li to the south at the summer solstice, and 135 000 // to the south at thewinter solstice, if one sets up a post (gan ^p) at noon it casts no shadow. Thissingle [fact is the basis of] the numbers of the Way of Heaven.'#B10[26c]'The zhou bi is eight chi in length. On the day of the summer solstice its [noon]shadow is one chi and six cun. The bi is the altitude [of the right-angled triangle],and the exact [noon] shadow is the base. 1000 //due south the base is one chi andfive cun, and 1000 // due north the base is one chi and seven cun. The further souththe sun is, the longer the shadow.'This information is then applied in #B 11 to find the height of heaven and thediameter of the sun. It is not until after all this that we find the explicit statement ofthe rule, in what seems to be a note interpolated by a later hand:#B12[34h]Method: the zhou bi is eight chi long, and the decrease or increase of the base isone cun for a thousand //.Shortly afterwards it is made plain that the rule can be used for finding thedistance to the place below any point on the heavens, even if the sun is not there andthe 'shadow' must be constructed artificially:134 See Neugebauer (1975) vol. 2, 740-6.

The shadow rule lies behind the calculation of the diameterof the heng circles Hf in section #D, and is stated explicitly in #D18. It is used oncemore in #F, and is the ultimate basis of the data used in #G. It plays no role in theother sections of the Zhou bi.It is not easy to trace the history of the shadow rule independently of the Zhou bibefore the Eastern Han. The first datable mention of the shadow rule comes in ZhangHeng's 3J!tlf essay on the cosmos, Ling xian MM, written about AD 100, in which heis describing the celestial sphere of the hun tian W^ universe. After telling us that theheight of (presumably the zenith) of heaven above the flat earth is half of the232 300 // diameter of the universe he continues:To cover these numbers, use repeated [applications] of base and altitude; the shadowcoming down from the heavens and its significance on the lowly earth [are relatedby the fact that] every shift of a thousand // gives a [shadow] difference of onecun.135 (Hou Han shu, zhi 10, 3216)Somewhat later we have the evidence of the commentary on the Zhou li MW. byZheng Xuan M~£ (AD 127-200). He is explaining the section of the text describingthe activities of the official bearing the title Da Si Tu y^^Jft 'Grand Director over theMasses', in which there is a reference to the use of solar shadow observations to find'the centre of the land' where the royal capital should be set up. In his comment Zhengstates:In general there is a difference of one cun of solar shadow for one thousand li onthe ground. (Zhou li zhu shu 10, 10a)Once we try to go any further back than this the trail becomes very thin. At theend of chapter three of the Huai nan zi tiTSj-jp there is a section of material in whichthe 'one cun for a thousand //'rule is applied in conjunction with a gnomon ten chihigh rather than the eight chi of the Zhou bi. As a consequence, heaven turns out to be100 000 // above the earth rather than 80 000 //. It is however clear that this material isnot part of the original text of Huai nan zi compiled around 139 BC, but was added by135 The problem with this passage is that there seems to be no way of getting from plausible shadowmeasurements to the dimensions quoted by Zhang. On this problem, and on the later history of theshadow rule, see Fu (1988)."},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"Instrumentation and observation in the Zhou bi 113a later hand.136 Of course the added material could still be quite old, and as I havealready mentioned its form and content have been taken to suggest connections withthe Later Mohist group in pre-Qin times. But all this is no more than supposition.A final tantalisingly incomplete hint of an early use of the shadow rule may befound in the Lu shi chun qiu. As we saw earlier (page 52), this work gives a brief noteof important features of a cosmography similar to that of the Zhou bi. Just before thepassage quoted earlier, we are told that:Within the four poles, it is 597 000 // from east to west, and from north to south itis also 597 000 H (Lu shi chun qiu 13, 3b, Sibu Congkan edn)The following text tells us that the sun 'goes round the four poles' (with 'poles'here in the sense of 'limits'), so the figure given looks as if it is the diameter of a solarpath centred on the celestial pole. Now the largest solar path in the Zhou bi is thewinter solstice path, which has diameter 476 000 li. This figure was obtained using theshadow rule in conjunction with an eight-chi gnomon, a winter solstice shadow of13.5 chi and a 'polar shadow' of 10.3 chi. If the same rule and the same shadow dataare used with a larger gnomon, then proportionately larger celestial distances result. If,for instance, we used the ten- chi gnomon found in the anomalous Huai nan zi text, thewinter solstice solar path would turn out to have a diameter:476 000 lix 10/8 = 595 000 li.This is within 2000 // of the figure given in the Lu shi chun qiu. One extra cun oneither of the shadow lengths used would have made the agreement exact, since thediameter is double the radius. But of course all this is just conjecture.Let us now sum up the historical situation. We have good evidence for the use ofthe shadow rule from the first century AD onwards. The Huai nan zi fragment presumablytakes us some way back into the Western Han. Both it and the Lu shi chun qiu give usrather weak indications of an even earlier date. Clearly such evidence is not likely tobe of crucial help in dating the relevant sections of the Zhou bi.As to the origins of the shadow rule, I do not think there is any evidence on whichto base worthwhile conclusions. The most striking fact about the rule is how completelywrong it is. Thus in #B10 Chen Zi told us that displacing the position of the summersolstice observation by 1000 // north or south would change the length of the shadowby one cun. In fact a simple trigonometrical calculation shows that a latitude changesouthwards of 0.68°, equivalent to about 75 km, would produce a reduction of summer136 See Cullen (1976)."},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"114  The Zhou bi and its contentssolstice shadow from 1.6 cun to 1.5 cun. The distance involved is therefore somethinglike 150 // rather than the 1000 // quoted.137It would be rather easier to cope with this situation if we could find evidence thatChen Zi's 'one cun for a thousand //' was simply a hypothetical datum introduced forillustrative purposes. But there is no indication of this at all in the text. In the Huainan zi fragment, which does use the hypothetical jia shi {iH3l 'suppose it to be the casethat' in parts of its discussions, the shadow rule is also treated as a fact pure andsimple, and the same is true of most of those who use the rule after the Han. Later inthe first millennium AD doubts began to grow, and Li Chunfeng's commentary bringssuch empirical evidence as he can muster to show that the north-south movement foran inch of shadow cannot possibly exceed 500 //, and may well be less: see 30e to 31hin Qian's edition. He also points out that such a rule only makes sense if heaven andearth are flat and parallel planes. In the following century the great meridian survey ofYixing —fr and Nangong Yue \"j^Urt^ provided even clearer evidence that the oldrule was faulty.138It does seem however that in earlier times the rule was simply accepted on thebasis of tradition. How that tradition originated we can only guess, though it canhardly have been on the basis of experimental evidence.139 The fact that it survived aslong as it did is highly revealing of the circumstances under which ancient Chineseastronomy developed. The only place where gnomon shadow measurements werelikely to be made was at the official observatory at or near the capital. From the earlyZhou until the end of the Han this was always located somewhere close to the parallelof 35° N latitude. No astronomer had any reason to leave his post to carry out observationselsewhere. Even if he or some private individual did so, it would have been extremelydifficult for him to have translated a rough knowledge of the distance measured alongwinding roads into precise north-south displacement. The situation in the ancientMediterranean world was a little more favourable in one sense, since astronomersworked at a number of geographically scattered locations in a culture much lesscentripetal than that of ancient China. But, as we have already seen, in the absence of137 Of course the length of the // varied somewhat through the centuries, but never enough to account forthe discrepancy encountered here.138 See Beer et al. (1961). See also Needham (1959), 292, and (1962), 44, Cullen (1982) and Fu Daiwie(1988).139 The only thing to be said in favour of the rule is that the notion of a linear variation of noon shadowlength with north-south displacement does hold approximately over an appropriately limited range oflatitudes. If for instance we calculate for the range 3CP to 40°, we find that the change of summer solsticeshadow for each degree of latitude remains within 3% of 1.45 cwrc/degree. But anyone who was aware ofthis linearity on experimental grounds would also have been aware that the 'one cun for a 1000 //' ratiowas wide of the mark."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"Instrumentation and observation in the Zhou bi 775any systematic collection of data it was difficult for even latitudes to be accuratelyknown, let alone actual distances over the surface of the earth.140I cannot leave the topic of the use of the shadow rule without referring to a furtheraspect of the problem. Fu Daiwie (1988) has pointed out that a fascination with thevastness of cosmic dimensions can be traced back as far as the time of Zou Yan fPftjin the fourth century BC. The theme can be followed through the Lii shi chun qiu inthe third century BC, the Huai nan zi book in the second century BC, and the chan weiWkM- apocrypha around the time of Wang Mang. The important thing about the Zhoubi and related texts such as the fragment at the end of Huai nan zi chapter 3 is thatthey provide for the first time a simple and rational way of obtaining such dimensionsfrom observation. Our focus should not be so much on the arbitrary nature of theshadow rule, but on its elegance and generality in comparison with the numerologicalluxuriance that lay elsewhere. From this point of view we can sympathise with RongFang's eagerness to learn the Way of Chen Zi.Stellar observations with gnomonsAlthough we most naturally think of the gnomon as an instrument for measuring theshadow cast by the sun, we have already seen good evidence that it could be used inconjunction with a north-south sightline for observing the transits of celestial bodiesat night. Independently of the Zhou bi we also have evidence that the gnomon couldbe used in other ways for stellar observations. Thus the 'Artificers' Record' Kao gongji #Xg3 section of the Zhou li MW. tells us of the activities of the master craftsmenin charge of laying out sites in the proper orientation:They check the ground with water levels. They set up a pole [and brace it] withcords to observe the shadow. Using compasses they check the shadows cast by the140 Even the data behind Eratosthenes' famous (and, it is usually claimed, accurate) determination of theearth's circumference are argued by one expert historian of ancient Western science to have been 'nomore than crude estimates expressed in convenient round numbers': Neugebauer (1975) vol. 2, 653. Thesame is even more true of his successor Posidonius. For a more optimistic interpretation of Eratosthenes'work, relying heavily on the adoption of the right value for the stade, see Dreyer (1906), 174-7. Lloyd(1987), 23Iff., reviews recent discussions on Eratosthenes. On the general question of the gathering ofgeographical data in Western antiquity, Neugebauer's pessimism certainly seems justified: 'In spite ofcomplete theoretical insight into the astronomical requirements for the determination of accurategeographical coordinates the absence of any scientific organisation in antiquity reduced geography to theunsatisfactory game of constructing compromise solutions from accidental records of travellers andmerchants, from the writings of historians, or, perhaps, some Roman itineraries and army records. Notbefore the time of Biruni (i.e. around AD 1000) was there a more systematic approach possible': (1975)vol. 2, 938. His point is greatly strengthened by the fact that despite a lack of the vital concept of thesphericity of the earth, it was in China three centuries before Biruni that the first great meridian surveyoccurred under the leadership of the monk mathematician Yixing, because the Tang dynasty astronomicalbureaucracy was able to draw on the wealth and organising power of what was then the world's greatestand most culturally advanced empire."},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"776  The Zhou bi and its contentsrising and setting sun. By day they observe the sun's shadow [in this way], but bynight they examine matters by [observation of] the pole star, in order to fix eastand west (Zhou li zhu shuAl, 23a-24b.)In some cases, as we shall see, the use of the gnomon for stellar observations inthe Zhou bi turns out to be rather more problematic than the examples we find elsewhere.Artificial shadows The first reference to a stellar sighting in the Zhou bi is an essentialpart of Chen Zi's discourse on the dimensions of the universe:#B14[34j]Now set up a gnomon (biao fit) eight chi tall, and sight on the pole: the base is onezhang three cun. Thus it can be seen that the subpolar point is 103 000 // to thenorth of Zhou.This seems straightforward enough at first glance. One simply sights over the topof the gnomon towards the celestial pole, and produces the line of sight back to theground to mark the tip of the 'shadow' that would have been cast if one had beensighting on the sun. As we shall see, later sections describe the obvious use of astretched piece of string for this purpose. The shadow rule may then be applied to findthe distance from the observer of the point below the pole.The problem is, however, that in Han times there was no bright star very close tothe pole as there is today. It seems that Chen Zi's purported observation is very much athought experiment. How then did one know where the celestial pole was? The principleemerges from section #F, which begins with the words 'If you want to know the pivotof the north pole ...', which neatly states our problem. The material that follows hastwo aspects. One is quite unproblematic: the text explains the use of the gnomon andstring sighting device to observe a bright circumpolar star as it orbits the pole, andhence to locate the pole and identify the cardinal directions. The problem lurking inthe text is that, as we shall see, the star referred to cannot be easily identified with anastronomically plausible object, and appears to have been placed as it is for reasonsthat can only be described as subterfuge.For the moment, we will ignore the hidden problem. The method for observingthe star in question is set out in paragraphs #F1 to #F5. In summary, one observes thestar in four positions relative to the pole:#F2: extreme east and west positions. This yields two 'shadows' whose ends are 2chi 3 cun apart, revealing (by the shadow rule, though not explicitly stated) that thetwo positions of the star are 23 000 li apart, and defining and east west line betweenthe shadow ends.

These translate into distance as 114 500 li and 91 500 //, onceagain making the two extreme positions of the star 23 000 // apart, and implying thatthe pole itself is 103 000 li away, since it must be half-way between the extremepositions in accordance with the implied assumption of the shadow rule that heaven isa flat plane parallel to earth.It would clearly be quite pointless to try to translate the situation described hereinto the language of celestial spherical trigonometry, since it is obvious that the mindthat produced this text was thinking in terms of a flat heaven.The Width of Lodges Other uses of the gnomon in the Zhou bi are decidedly problematic.We turn first to the early part of section #G. In this an attempt is made to use gnomonobservations to define the widths of the 28 lodges. Now as we have seen it is highlylikely that the combination of gnomon and waterclock was indeed the method bywhich precise lodge widths were originally defined. The point here, however, is thatthe text dispenses with the waterclock. The procedure begins with instructions todescribe a circle with circumference exactly 365 1/4 chi on level ground.141 Thecircumference thus gives us one du for every one chi. We then fix north-south andeast-west diameters, and erect a gnomon at the centre.The lodge chosen as an example in the text is Ox, where the sun is located at thewinter solstice. Once the circle and gnomon are set up we proceed as follows:#G4 [58n]... sight on the centring of the middle star of Ox. Next further observe the leadingstar of Woman. As previously, sight with the gnomon and string on the leading starof Woman, so as to fix its [moment of] centring. Thereupon, using a displacementmarker, sight [again] on the middle star of Ox, [noting] how many du it is to thewest of the central standard gnomon. In every such case, the number of chi indicatedby the marker gives the number of du. The marker will be over the eight chi[mark], so we know that Ox has eight du. Proceed accordingly with succeedingstars, so that all the 28 lodges are determined.The situation is straightforward. We watch the determinative star of the lodge Ox(which happens to be the central star of the asterism of that name) cross the meridian.We then wait until the determinative star of the next lodge to the east of Ox, Woman,crosses the meridian, and take another sight on the previous star. To do this we will141 This is supposed to be done by making the diameter of the circle exactly 121 chi 7 cun 5 fen, whichassumes n = 3. This is of course the first sign that we are dealing with a procedure whose author hasnever carried it out in practice."},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"118  The Zhou bi and its contentshave to move our sightline so that we are now looking somewhat west of south, andwe mark the point where our sightline crosses the graduated circle. At that point weread off the number of du, which (we are assured) gives us the extent of the lodge Ox.In fact, however, this is impossible. What we are doing is measuring the differencein azimuth between the two celestial bodies. This is an angle measured in the plane ofthe horizon, whereas we require the Chinese equivalent of right ascension, which is(in modern terms) measured in the plane of the celestial equator. To see the effect ofthis mistake, let us take some examples.The two stars referred to in the Zhou bi are easily identified, and it is simple tofind their coordinates for the epoch 100 BC. This epoch is chosen to represent WesternHan conditions. We have:RA (degrees) Dec. (degrees)Ox: p Cap  275.10  -18.80Woman: 8 Aqr  282.84  -14.84The difference between right ascensions (RA) of these stars is thus 7.74° whichconverts to 7.85 du. Clearly the lodge width is as stated in the Zhou bi and in otherHan texts. If however we follow the procedure of the text the result is different. Whenthe determinative star of Woman is on the meridian we have:Azimuth (degrees)Ox:  170.97Woman:  180.00The difference is thus 9.03° or 9.16 du, over one du greater than the 8 du promisedin the text. In most other cases the discrepancy is even more marked. Thus the widthof the lodge Mane, whose determinative star is r\\ Tauri, comes out at 10.45° in rightascension, which fits in well with the ancient value of 11 du. The method prescribedby the text would have yielded no less than 28.26°, a glaringly obvious discrepancy.Even if the author of this section of the Zhou bi tried his method for the two stars hementioned and convinced himself that the answer was 'about right', he could not havecontinued in his self-deception for very long.In the universe of the Zhou bi it is not very difficult for us nowadays to see thatazimuthal observations of the kind specified here will only yield true lodge widths ifthe observer is situated at the subpolar point, so that the radii of his graduated circlecoincide in plan view with those radiating from the pole. As we have seen, however,the concept of angle was not well developed in ancient China, and what seems obviousto us with hindsight may not have seemed obvious to the author of this section, whomay well have believed that his idea would work."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"Instrumentation and observation in the Zhou bi 119We cannot be sure what his purpose was in creating this new method for measuringlodge widths. What after all would have been wrong with transit-timing using awaterclock? The use of the waterclock is indeed mentioned in #F3, though not in thepresent context. I suspect that the evident wish of the writer to be able to read offcelestial coordinates from a graduated circle suggests that he wanted to emulate theperformance of hun tian W^ instruments. This suspicion becomes a certainty whenwe study the succeeding paragraphs of section #G, which we shall shortly do.First, however, let us conclude the discussion of the graduated circle. Once thewidths of all the lodges have been established, we are told that they must be markedout on the circumference of the circle: see #G6. As we have already seen, the mannerin which this is to be done indicates strong links between this portion of the text andthe shi ^C divination devices discussed earlier. In #G8 we are told to use the circle todetermine in what lodge the sun is setting and rising. It is clear that in this case thelodge system is simply being used as an azimuth reference system for a terrestrialobserver - and it is indeed marked out round the edge of the fixed earth-plate of theshi as well as on the rotating heaven-disc. There is of course nothing illegitimate insuch a procedure,142 although it seems to be more common to divide the horizon usingthe twelve cyclical signs, zi ~jF to hai ^.

Both of these types of graduation are found on the earth-plates of shi,and both are exemplified in the brief notes on rising and setting in section #J.North polar distances Section #G concludes with three statements, each followed by'method' paragraphs explaining the derivation of the results given.

We have here a set of north polar distances which although they ostensiblyrefer to the asterisms which lend their names to lodges are clearly intended to tell us142 It seems possible that the legitimacy of using the lodges as terrestrial azimuth graduations may haveled the writer of section #G into his confusion about the measurement of celestial lodge widths."},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"720  The Zhou bi and its contentsthe north polar distances of the sun when it is passing through the lodges in question.Ox is the winter solstice lodge, Harvester and Horn are the equinoctial lodges, andWell is the summer solstice lodge. These data agree closely with those given in JiaKui's MM memorial of AD 92:[it has been stated that] at the winter solstice the sun is 115 du from the pole, thatat the summer solstice it is 67 du from the pole, and that at the spring and autumnequinoxes it is 91 du from the pole. (Hou Han shu, zhi 2, 3029)The problem is, however, that within the context of the Zhou bi the mere appearanceof north polar distances in du is the equivalent of the clock striking thirteen. There aretwo reasons why these data are so anomalous. In the first place, the methods ofmeasurement described in the Zhou bi are quite incapable of observing such data. Thesimplest procedure for finding the north polar distance of the sun directly wouldrequire a graduated ring fixed vertically in the plane of the meridian. The sun's zenithdistance as it crossed the meridian could thus be combined with a previous determinationof the zenith distance of the pole to give the solar north polar distance. But in the Zhoubi we are still in the situation mentioned in the Han shu, as cited earlier:Distances from the pole are hard to ascertain, so one has to use the shadow. It isthe shadow that enables one to know the sun's north and south [displacements].(Han shu 21a, 1294)It would certainly be possible to obtain angular data from shadow measurementsby geometrical construction - perhaps even using the giant graduated circle on theground mentioned earlier. But nobody in the Zhou bi or elsewhere ever mentions sucha procedure, and in any case it is clear from the precision claimed that the data beforeus cannot result from any such procedure, and indeed cannot be the result of observationat all.There is another more fundamental problem to confront, which is that the entireconcept of a north polar distance in angular measure is foreign to the astronomicalsystem of the Zhou bi. The du is essentially a fractional division of the circumferenceof a circle. As we have seen in section #D, this implies that on a particular circle thedu will correspond to a particular length round the circumference. In the hun tianuniverse north polar distance is measured along a great circle of the celestial spherethough the pole and the body in question. There is therefore no problem about expressingsuch a measurement in du. In the gai tian universe, the distance of a body from thepole is measured along a straight line which is a radius of the celestial disc. It istherefore incoherent to use the du to express such a distance. How would one knowwhat length of du to use? And yet here we have a du which is clearly of a definitelength."},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"Instrumentation and observation in the Zhou bi 727The source of these puzzling data is revealed in the 'method' paragraphs whichfollow each statement. For simplicity I will discuss the equinoctial data first.#G12 [62k]Method:Set up the distance from the middle heng to the pivot of the north pole: 178 500 li,which makes the dividend.Take as divisor the size of one du on the innermost heng.The integral quotient gives the number of du.The li and bu are found from the remainder.Make the [final] remainder the numerator of a fraction whose denominator is thedivisor.The middle heng, the fourth of the seven described in section #D, is the dailycircle of the sun round the pole at the equinoxes. Its radius has been found by halvingthe figure of 357 000 li given in #D11. The innermost and first heng is the summersolstice path, of diameter 238 000 //, divided into du of length 1954 // 247 bu and933/1461 bu: see #D8. There seems to be no reason whatsoever for taking the lengthof a du on this heng as the unit for measuring the radius of another heng. A littlefurther analysis will however make the point behind this choice plain.We must recall that the seventh heng, the winter solstice path, is exactly doublethe radius of the summer solstice first heng, and that the equinoctial fourth heng ishalf-way between the two. The radii of the first and fourth heng are thus related by:Rx = (2/3) x R4Taking n as 3, as throughout the Zhou bi, the length of a du on the innermost heng is:d = (2x3xR1) + (365 1/4)so substituting from the first equation, we find:d = 2x3x(2/3)x/?4/(365 1/4)= 4x/?4+(365 1/4).This is the unit we now have to divide into the radius of the middle heng asprescribed in the method given, in order to find the number of 'standard dii (asreckoned round the circumference of the innermost heng) equivalent to the radius ofthe fourth (equinoctial) heng.

This result has nothing at all to do with observation. Itfollows straightforwardly from a decision by the author of this section to exploit thesimple numerical relationships between the heng radii, which are themselves in turnthe result of a decision to prefer neat theory over observation. The only reason theinnermost heng has been used to provide the length of a du is because it produces theresult required. The approximation n = 3 is also crucial.Supposing that we allow that this is a legitimate way to convert heng radii tonorth polar distances. Since the radii of the summer solstice, equinoctial and wintersolstice heng are related by:RX:R4 :R7 :: 2/3 : 1 : 4/3.This would yield north polar distances as follows:summer solstice: (2/3) x (365 1/4) +- 4 du = 60 du 7/8 or 60Pwinter solstice: (4/3) x (365 1/4) •*• 4 du = 121 du 3/4 or 120°.These are clearly not the results stated in #G9 and #G13.

Before carrying out the conversion to duas before, 11 500 // has been subtracted in the case of the winter solstice and added inthe case of the summer solstice. This is, as the text states, the radius of the circledescribed by the xuanji I#3H 'star' as it orbits the pole in accordance with the descriptionin section #F. What is more, we may note that according to #F1 this star is on thesame side of the pole as the winter solstice sun, but is on the other side from thesummer solstice sun. It is therefore obvious why we are told to subtract 11 500 // forwinter and add it for summer: the 'distances from the pole' we are calculating for thesolstices are in fact measured from the xuan ji star and not from the pole at all. Theequinoctial distance is however measured from the pole.Now, as we shall see, it seems that the radius of the xuan ji circle is determinedby other considerations than the need to produce convincing north polar distances forthe solstitial sun. To us it may therefore seem that the author of this section wassimply lucky that some simple manipulations of the data enabled him to produceresults close to those accepted in the first century BC. It is however unlikely to haveseemed that way to its creator, who was probably convinced that he had stumbledupon a highly significant fact about the cosmos.143What can we deduce from this strange state of affairs? The main point is thatno-one could possibly have created the peculiar computational procedures we haveseen here unless he knew in advance what answer he wanted to get. Clearly, therefore,the author of this section already knew values for the seasonal north polar distances of143 A much more unlikely numerical coincidence seems to have been crucial in the creation of theuniverse of nested planetary spheres usually known as the 'Ptolemaic system1: see Neugebauer (1975) vol.2, 917ff.

Since the methods of the Zhou bi cannot yield observational data of this type,the author must have worked at a time when hun tian astronomy was already beingpractised. As we have seen, that probably places him no further back than some wayinto the first century BC. It seems that he may have felt that it was essential for Zhoubi methods to do as well as the hun tian, a motive that as we have already seenprobably lies behind section #F as well. To us, his success has the whiff of despairabout it. At the time, however, an astronomical scheme that could deduce the valuesof important quantities from pre-existing data would probably have seemed superiorto one that could only observe them.144The problem of the xuan ji J#H Before leaving the topic of stellar observations, weare now in a position to resolve various problems which arise from the description ofobservations of the xuanji star in section #F. Two features require explanation.(1) The star in question is said to be 11 500 // from the celestial pole.(2) The star is placed on the radius linking the winter solstice sun to the pole.The answer to the first question takes us back to the description of polar conditionsset out by Chen Zi in #B22 and #B24, in which we are told that the rays of the sun justreach the subpolar point at the equinoxes, so that there is a six-month day and asix-month night there. This accurate statement of polar conditions implies that therange of the sun's rays should be equal to the radius of the equinoctial orbit of the sunround the pole (the fourth heng) which is 178 500 li. We are however told in #B25that the range of the sun's rays, which is the same as the extent of human vision, is infact only 167 000 //. While the text goes on to calculate how much the summersolstice sunlight at noon and midnight overlap across the pole, and what the correspondingshortfall is in winter, the now embarrassing calculation for the equinoxes is not made.So why was the appropriate value for the solar range not used?The answer becomes clear in #B32 - see also #D15. By adding twice the range ofthe sun's rays to the diameter of the winter solstice orbit, one may define the circle of'the four poles' which is the outer limit of the region ever illuminated by the sun. Aswe are told in #D16 'nobody knows what is beyond this'. If we choose the figure of167 000 //, the diameter of this circle is:2 x 167 000 li + 476 000 li = 810 000 li.This is a highly satisfactory result, for as Zhao Shuang comments:144 Compare for instance Liu Xin's attempts to derive the basic constants of his astronomical system fromfirst principles in Han shu 21a and 21b."},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"Instrumentation and observation in the Zhou bi  725[This figure of] 81 is the ultimate Yang number, so it gives the extreme extent ofsunlight. {Zhou bi 40m in Qian's edn)The point is that 81 is the square of 9, which is itself the square of the primaryYang number three, corresponding, as we know, to heaven itself. Paragraph #A2 hasalready stressed the importance of the number 81 as the basis of the order of allgeometrical forms. The limit of sunlight is thus numerologically correlated with thefurthest extent of Yang, represented by the ultimate number. Of course, had thenumbers fallen out differently, the figure of 81 could have been brought in anotherway. Compare for instance:The Yang reaches its culmination at nine. Therefore the circumference of heaven isnine nines which is 810 000 //. (Chun qiu yuan ming bao ^^CXi'opfe, quoted in1, lOa-lOb)This is one of the 'apocryphal books' which flourished around the time of Wang Mangand into the Eastern Han.This does not seem to us the strongest justification for destroying the exactitudeof the description of polar conditions already given by Chen Zi. Perhaps he wouldhave retorted that no-one had ever seen the land under the pole, but everybody wasagreed about the basic order of the universe as expressed in numbers. Numerology,rational and obvious to all, had to take precedence over what were at most traveller'stales about the far north. At any rate, Chen Zi bequeathed a slightly embarrassingproblem to his successors, for now the equinoctial sunlight fell short of the subpolarpoint by:178 500 li - 167 000 li =11 500 IINow we recognise this as the radius of the circle described by the xuan ji stararound the pole. The link with the problem of polar conditions is taken up again in thesequence of paragraphs #F6, #F8, and #F9 (#F7 is clearly a displaced note). It isobvious that for the purpose of the discussion of polar conditions the pole has beenreplaced by the circumference of the xuan ji circle, which is just touched by sunlightat the equinoxes as in figure 11 so that:#F6 [56f]... the Yang is cut off and the Yin manifests itself.In his commentary on #B25 Zhao Shuang has already made thispoint:"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"726The Zhou bi and its contents167 000 li, rangeof sun's rays178 500 li,radius ofequinoctialhengXuanji circleround pole,radius 11 500//EquinoctialsunFigure 11.

There is good evidence that the term xuan ji was used as a name for thepole star in Western Han times.146 And thus he created for us a puzzle which haswasted the time of a good number of scholars, both in Asia and the West, but whichwe can now dismiss as of minor importance.147 It is, however, another useful link inthe evidence enabling us to make some sense of the way the sections of the Zhou birelate to each other.The sighting tubeThere is little to say about this device, which is mentioned only briefly in the dialogueof Chen Zi and Rong Fang:#B11 [26h]'Wait until the base is six chi, then take a bamboo [tube] of diameter one cun, andof length eight chi. Catch the light [down the tube] and observe it: the bore exactlycovers the sun, and the sun fits into the bore. Thus it can be seen that an amount of145 Noda (1933), 64-98 discusses the xuanji problem in great detail. He finds that in 1100 BC the brightstar p UMi had a right ascension of 217.4°, which would have put it almost exactly in the right positionbetween the pole and the winter solstice sun. Unfortunately its declination at that epoch of +83.47° andconsequent north polar distance of 6.53° then means that the ends of the cords marking the east-westextremes would have been about 7 chi apart rather than the 2.3 chi specified in #F2. By the morehistorically plausible epoch of the beginning of the Western Han this star's right ascension had changed to242.5°, so that the alignment would no longer work as required. The distance from the pole is alsoslightly greater, worsening the discrepancy with #F2.146 Thus see the gloss of Fu Sheng jjt^ (fl. 200 BC) on a passage in the Book of Documents: The thingwhich changes by a tiny amount but moves something great is called the xuan ji; therefore the xuan ji[may be] said to be the north pole1: Shang shu da zhuan i^#^:W, quoted in Taiping yulan ^C^ffllR 29,3a.

For more detailed evidence on this point see Cullen (1980), 39-40, which alsomakes the very tentative suggestion that the xuan ji referred to in the Book of Documents might be anearly example of the diviner's cosmic model shi, with the pole star at the centre of its heaven-disc.147 A striking example of the confusion which has been caused is the quite illusory theory of HenriMichel that the Zhou bi refers to the use of serrated jade discs as 'circumpolar constellation templates'.This view was unfortunately repeated by Joseph Needham, who reasonably enough was impressed byMichel's apparently conclusive documentation, in fact the result of omission of everything in the text thatdid not fit his ideas, combined with an inability to read Chinese. See Needham (1959), 336-9.

Once again an alleged empirical result has been shapedby certain guiding assumptions. It is too much of a coincidence that the right length oftube should be exactly the same length as the standard gnomon, and that at the sametime its bore should be exactly one cun. The figures given here predict an apparentsolar diameter of 43', which is about 10' greater than the value actually observed.The cosmography of the Zhou biThe time has now come to look back over the cosmographical aspects of the Zhou bi. Ihope that by now it has become evident how difficult it is to separate such questionsfrom the wider astronomical context. The main questions the Zhou bi sets out toanswer, and the way it answers them, are closely bound up with early Chineseastronomical theory and practice. This was a problem domain in which the mainparameter was time rather than space, and this time parameter was mostly measuredwith respect to events on the observer's meridian line. These included the transits ofstars, and the rising and falling of the noon sun throughout the year. The moon was anexception, although as we have seen there are signs that its meridian transit at principalphases in a particular lodge could be used to locate the sun.149 The gai tian H^universe described earlier fits in well with this way of doing astronomy: as the heavenlydisc rotates it displays a sequence of data through the narrow window of the meridian.So long as what is seen through this window is correct, it does not easily occur to theastronomer to ask questions about whether the appearance of the heavens as a wholecorresponds to the model exactly. Exactitude implies measurement - and measurementis something that only happens on the meridian.Further, the essential features of the gai tian from the point of view of its linkswith astronomical practice are all contained in its plan view. As in the shi cosmicmodel, which works perfectly well although the heaven-disc is simply placed on topof the earth-plate, questions of the actual height of heaven are not central to thetheory. Nor for that matter is the absolute size of the universe. We have seen possible148 See Neugebauer (1975) vol. 2, 657-9, for some early Western determinations of the sun's apparentdiameter.149 Zhou li zhu shu 26, 19a, comm."},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"The cosmography of the Zhou bi  129signs in the third century BC Lu shi chun qiu of a version of the gai tian in which theuse of a different size of gnomon caused all dimensions to be scaled up by a factor of10/8.With all this in mind, we will now review the form of the gai tian as it appears inthe Zhou bi. Rather than gathering together every word on the subject from the wholebook, it seems better to start by seeing what we can learn from the study of a piece oftext that is clearly coherent and self-contained, section #B, which I have called the'Book of Chen Zi'.The cosmography of Chen ZiIn the first place it is clear that Chen Zi W~f is living in an uncontroversial universewhose general layout needs neither explicit description nor justification. It is obviouslywhat we would now call a gai tian universe, but Chen Zi uses no such term. In hisintellectual environment conflict between rival views on cosmography has perhaps notyet forced the use of names for different ideas on what heaven and earth are like.Certain minimum features of his cosmography are clear: heaven rotates once dailyabout the pole, carrying the heavenly bodies with it, and is a uniform height above theearth. We are told nothing explicitly about the shapes of heaven and earth. Taking theearth as flat, which is the normal Chinese view before the seventeenth century, itseems likely that Chen Zi would have held that heaven was flat too.150 But we must becareful not to force issues that Chen Zi himself does not raise, for by doing so we maygive a false picture of his concerns. As we shall see, another section of the Zhou bisuggests a different form for heaven and earth.Chen Zi's real concerns are revealed in the opening question put to him by hisdisciple Rong Fang#B1 [23k]Long ago, Rong Fang asked Chen Zi 'Master, I have recently heard somethingabout your Way. Is it really true that your Way is able to comprehend the heightand size of the sun, the [area] illuminated by its radiance, the amount of its dailymotion, the figures for its greatest and least distances, the extent of human vision,the limits of the four poles, the lodges into which the stars are ordered, and thelength and breadth of heaven and earth?1We have already seen how Chen Zi answers these questions. Apart from the150 In defending gai tian ideas against what seem to be garbled versions of the hun tian, Wang Chong jEE% (AD 27-100) stated that both heaven and earth must be flat and level: Urn heng ttHf 11, lObff.,Hanwei congshu edn."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"130The Zhou bi and its contentsOrbit of sunat summersolsticeOrbit of sunat wintersolsticeFigure 12.

It is a simple and clean view of the cosmos, which does not need tocompromise very much with observation to produce such satisfying results as the 1:2ratio between the summer solstice and winter solstice radius. So far as events on themeridian are concerned, everything functions satisfactorily. As we have seen, the wishto get a numerologically satisfying figure for the ultimate diameter of the universe hasmeant that a neat account of the six-month alternation of day and night at he pole hashad to be complicated somewhat.Looking at Chen Zi's cosmography overall, some interesting features presentthemselves. Firstly, the universe is a very large place in comparison with the extent ofthe Chinese world. The actual distance from the Yellow River down to Canton in the"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"The cosmography of the Zhou bi  131far south (well beyond the pale of civilisation under the Han) is about 2000 li, and thecircumference of the entire globe is about 47 000 li. For Chen Zi, however, the pointbelow the north celestial pole is 103 000 // away from his Chinese observer at Zhou,and the diameter of the illuminated region of the earth is 810 000 //. This picture of arelatively small China somewhere off-centre on a huge earth is at odds with claims(made elsewhere in classical texts favoured under the Han) that the royal capital wasat 'the centre of the land'. The centrality of the royal capital is said in some sources tohave been established by gnomon measurements.151 We know, however, that under thefirst Qin Emperor the cosmography of Zou Yan was presented to the throne, and thisscheme had China well off-centre in the south-east corner of the earth. Such ideasfitted ill with the imperial cosmic synthesis created under the Western Han, and wouldprobably not have been well received. Perhaps the brief change of atmosphere underWang Mang may have provided a favourable climate for novelties, and as we shall seelater there are signs of activity linked with the Zhou bi under Wang. Could it be thatone of the attractions of the hurt tian under the Eastern Han was that it restored theChinese observer to a proper position at the centre of things?A modern reader is naturally intrigued by those aspects of Chen Zi's world thatseem to reflect our present geographical knowledge. I have already mentioned thequestion of polar conditions several times. There is also the implication that one man'ssunset is another man's sunrise, and that our noon is the midnight of an observer onthe other side of the pole, points which are developed in later sections, as we shall see.I can think of no likely way in which this view could be the result of actual geographicalinformation. For polar conditions, on the other hand, things are more plausible. Thereis a continuous land route from the Yellow River to north of the Arctic Circle, andthere are other signs that traveller's tales about extreme northern conditions had reachedChina.152It must be said that even in its own terms the account of Chen Zi has someproblems. The use of 167 000 // for the extent of the sun's rays rather than 178 500 licauses difficulties round the pole, as has already been noted. There is also the fact thatalthough in #B29 Chen Zi calculates the east-west distances through the observer tothe solar path at the solstices, he does not do the same for the equinoxes. This wouldhave revealed that when the sun is exactly due east or west at the equinoxes it is145 172 // away, and thus is already within sight range, and therefore has already151 See for instance Zhou li zhu shu 10, 1 lb: 'Where the [summer] solstitial shadow of the sun is one chifive cun, that is called the centre of the earth. It is where heaven and earth join together, where the fourseasons succeed one another [rightly], where wind and rain are fitting, and the Yin and Yang are inharmony. Thus everything flourishes in peace. This is where the royal capital is set up.

Another obvious difficulty is that if heaven rotates at a constant speed, then dayand night at the equinoxes cannot be equal if the sun does rise and set due east andwest, since less than half of the daily orbit is in sight during the day. Problems of thiskind were of course seized upon by later critics of the gai tian}53 Outside the problemdomain of meridian observations within which it originated the gai tian could give nomore than qualitative representations of the phenomena. The Sui shu Rf Hr put thesituation correctly when discussing gai tu HHI 'disc-maps [of the heavens]':Although they are clear in [predicting the results of] leaning back to look upwards1[=meridian observations?], they cannot correctly determine the times of dusk anddawn, or divide the day and night. (Sui shu 19, 520)Other cosmographic materialThe subsequent sections of the Zhou bi do not change the basic scheme laid down byChen Zi. They do however add details and attempt to deal with residual problems.Thus section #D does little more than elaborate the data of section #B on the threecircles marking the daily paths of the sun at the solstices and equinoxes. In the firstplace the interval between the solstices is divided more finely, so that a total of sevenequally spaced circles now marks the sun's position for twelve of the twenty-four qi.Secondly a new term, heng $S, is introduced for these circles, which Chen Zi hadsimply named ri dao 0 ji 'the path of the sun'. There is no very obvious motivationfor the use of this term, which has a range of meanings including 'cross-ways' or'balance': perhaps there is a reference to the different levels of the noon sun in the skythroughout the year.154It will be recalled that the paragraphs in section #F dealing with the xuan ji aremotivated partly by the polar problem created by Chen Zi, which they solve by ineffect redefining the pole as the region within the xuanji circle of 11 500 // radius. Itis therefore not unexpected that this section reverts to the topic of polar climaticconditions. We read:#F8 [56j]The subpolar point does not give birth to the myriad [living] things. How is thisknown? [When] the winter solstice sun is 119 000 // away from the summersolstice [position], the myriad [living] things all die. Now [even] the summersolstice sun is 119 000 // away from the north pole. Therefore we know that thesubpolar point does not give birth to the myriad [living] things.153 See for instance Sui shu 19, 506-7.154 Or perhaps there is some link with the term yu heng zEUf 'jade heng1, paired with the expression xuanji 3tH in the Book of Documents: see Cullen and Farrer (1983).

Our winter occurs when the sun moves 119 000 //further away than it is at midsummer (when it is only 16 000 // away at noon) makinga total distance of 135 000 li. Now even at midsummer the sun is still 119 000 // awayfrom the pole. Clearly nothing like summer can ever occur there at all. But the nextparagraph makes an interesting extrapolation:#F9 [56k]In the region of the north pole, there is unmelting ice in summer. At the springequinox, and at the autumn equinox, the sun is on the middle heng. From thespring equinox onwards the sun [moves] more and more to the north, and after59 500 // it is at the summer solstice.

This means that the Yang manifests itself and the Yin isattenuated, so that the myriad [living] creatures do not die, and the five grains ripentwice in one year. As for the region of the north pole, there are things that grow upin the morning and are gathered in the evening.Having dealt with the travellers' tales from the far north, the author of this paragraphnow rationalises what he has heard about tropical conditions in the far south: we mustremember that the tropic of Cancer passes close to Canton. And it must be said thathis explanation makes very good sense.The xuan ji material is as we have seen closely related to the work of Chen Zi.Other cosmographical references are more difficult to relate to an overall pattern.They come from section #A, whose language and topic seem to have very littleconnection with the rest of the book, and from section #E, which seem to be in somedisorder. I now discuss the relevant paragraphs, reordering those from section #E sothat they read in what seems to be a more rational sequence. The reader who wishes todo so may of course read the text in its original state in the main translation.#A6 [22p]'The square pertains to Earth, and the circle pertains to Heaven. Heaven is a circle,and Earth is a square. The numbers of the square are basic, and the circle isproduced from the square. One may represent Heaven by a rain-hat. Heaven is blueand black; Earth is yellow and red. As for the numbers of Heaven making arain-hat, the blue and black make the outside, and the cinnabar and yellow makethe inside, so as to represent the positions of Heaven and Earth.1There is nothing strikingly novel here. We have already seen the way in which thelinks are made between square/earth/4 and circle/heaven/3. If Song Yu could say that"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"134   The Zhou bi and its contentsheaven is a cover gai over the earth, it seems just as reasonable to call it a rain-hat.The references to colours may be intended to say something about the actual appearanceof heaven and earth (blue sky in daytime, black at night, yellow and red soil colours)but they are equally likely to be related to the schemes of cosmic correlation ofcolours, notes, flavours, directions etc. that reached their peak of integration under theWestern Han.155 It is difficult to see any relation between material of this kind and thecosmography of the rest of the Zhou bi. The material from section #E is easier to dealwith.#E1 [53b]The rotation of the sun and moon around the way of the four poles:#E4 [53e]Therefore when the sun's rotation has brought it to a position north of the pole, it isnoon in the northern region and midnight in the southern region.

When the sun is west of the pole, it is noon in the westernregion and midnight in the eastern region.#E5 [53g]Now in [each of] these four regions heaven and earth have their four poles andtheir four harmonies. The times of day and night occur in alternation. So in thelimits reached by Yin and Yang, and the extremes reached by winter and summer,they are as one.All this simply makes explicit points that were implicit in Chen Zi's account ofthe universe, and stresses the cosmic equality of different locations. The last paragraphmight even be designed as an explicit rejection of the claims of the Zhou li that theChinese capital was situated at an environmentally perfect position.#E6 [54a]Heaven resembles a covering rain-hat, while earth is patterned on an inverted pan.#E2 [53b]As for the subpolar point, it is 60 000 li higher than where human beings live, andthe pouring waters run down on all sides. Likewise the centre of heaven is 60 000li higher than its edges.155 On this topic see Graham (1989), 315ff.

Even though the winter solstice sun is on the outerheng, it is still 20 000 li above the land below the pole.Now this material is both interesting and problematic. The reference to the rain-hatin section #A was clearly unrelated to questions of quantitative cosmography. Herehowever we have quantitative data, clearly recorded by someone who knows about theheng system. But how can we interpret these measurements, and what is their origin?In the first place, there is a problem in interpreting #E6 in conjunction with the othertwo paragraphs, which seem to imply that heaven and earth both bulge up equalamounts in the middle and are a constant difference apart. A Chinese rain-hat (at leasta modern one) is a rather conical affair, whereas all ancient specimens of the vesseltype translated here as 'pan' (Chinese pan i§[ coincidentally) have a gentle curve froma flattish central base portion. Of course it may be that an ancient Chinese rain-hatmay have been more like the type now found in Japan, which is not pointed but gentlyrounded to make it somewhat pan {or pan) shaped.Turning now to the figures, two problems present themselves. Firstly, it is noteasy to make sense of the reference to 'where human beings live'. This point is clearlyunder the 'edge of heaven1 here apparently the outer heng, and is not the inhabited areawhere Chen Zi's observer is placed well within the inner heng. Perhaps this phraseshould be glossed as '[the most distant place] where human beings live' on the assumptionthat no-one lives beyond the outer heng. Why this limit should be used rather than theouter limit of daylight is unclear.Secondly, all other distances in the Zhou bi have some kind of rational basiswithin its overall intellectual scheme. It is however very hard to think of any way inwhich the figure of 60 000 // for the bulge could be derived by such means as the 'onecun for a thousand //' principle. I can only offer a conjecture that there may be aconnection with the six intervals, jian fS between the seven heng. If each heng was 10000 li lower than its predecessor, then the outermost heng would indeed be 60 000 lilower than the innermost one. I do not pretend to be able to offer any justification forthe 10 000 // figure; it is however (unlike 60 000 //) the sort of figure that could havebeen arbitrarily chosen. The advantage of confining the fall to the region beyond thefirst heng is that the known world of the Chinese observer is still on comfortinglylevel ground. The highly conjectural result of this approach is sketched in figure 13.Interestingly it has a fairly close resemblance to the type of flat-topped gaichariot cover often seen in Han bas-reliefs. Other writers have shown heaven andearth as having a gently curving cross-section in which the 'fall' is distributed over the"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"136The Zhou bi and its contentsCelestialaxisHeavenEarthFigure 13.

I hope, however, that in producing my tentative sketch ofthe ideas behind these paragraphs I shall not be said to have produced 'a new interpretationof the gai tian theory', for from my point of view such matters are entirely peripheralto the main content of the gai tian, which is contained in its plan view.Now if one is committed to the view that the Zhou bi is a single piece of consistentwriting, such a reference to heaven and earth bulging upwards is disturbing. In auniverse where heaven and earth are not flat and parallel, the shadow rule cannotrationally be applied. In the seventh century Li Chunfeng devoted much effort topointing this out with detailed arguments.156 What then becomes of all Chen Zi'sreckonings? If however we are not committed to such a view of the text as a unity, theproblem dissolves. The author of these paragraphs clearly knew of the system of the156 See pp. 28-30 in Qian's edition.

He was thus writing at a time when themathematical core of the Zhou bi had already been laid down on the basis of a flatearth and heaven.If one looks for a reason why such a writer should feel moved to introduce aheaven and earth that were not flat, one can only speculate that he found the idea of aflat heaven somewhat counter intuitive when he looked at the sky apparently comingdown towards the earth at the horizon. Perhaps he may have been influenced bycontact with hun tian ideas? This could have lead him to an arched heaven instead of aflat one, but if so the consciousness that heaven and earth are supposed to be aconstant 80 000 // apart has evidently led him to give the earth a corresponding bulge.In that case, as with section #G, we have an indication of dating, although in this casecomparatively weak. Of course the fact that the lowest part of heaven is still aboveeven the highest regions of earth means that sunrise and sunset etc. will still need to beexplained by the use of a fixed range for the sun's rays and human vision, as in#B25.157157 The Song shu is confused when it says that day and night in the Zhou bi occur because the sun andmoon go out of sight behind the bulge of the earth, quoting a garbled version of the figures in #E2 and#E7 which makes the centre of the earth 20 000 // higher than the outer heng: see Song shu 23, 679."},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"The origins of the workMost previous discussions of the Zhou bi have at some point attacked the apparentlyobvious question of the date of the work. A recent study cites the opinions of fourteenscholars before coming to its own conclusion that Therefore, the date of compositionof the work must be in the early Western Han (c. 200 BC).' We may note that theopinions cited give dates ranging from the traditional attribution to the Duke of Zhouin the eleventh century BC to the conclusions of a modern scholar that the book can beprecisely bracketed into the period AD 9 to AD 84.158I do not intend to provide such a review of the work of all previous scholars onthis topic before beginning my own discussion. My reasons for this are twofold.Firstly, and fairly trivially, a critical review of fourteen different opinions (each itmust be said written with little or no reference to the others) is probably not the bestway to help the reader towards clarity of mind on this question. More importantly, Ibelieve that previous writers on this topic have largely misdirected their efforts intrying to find some epoch when the book as a whole could reasonably have beencomposed.I suggest that two unspoken assumptions behind these efforts have lead to largelyillusory results being obtained. Firstly, it is assumed that the Zhou bi is more or less asingle entity which must therefore have some particular date of composition. I believethat on the contrary the different sections of the Zhou bi have extremely varied degreesof interrelation. Some seem to have no connection at all, some seem to be laterdevelopments of issues raised in earlier sections, and some are flatly inconsistent.What we have here, it seems to me, is a collection of documents made by an individualor by a group with some common interest.159 If a group was involved, there may have158 Feng Ligui (1986). I am grateful to Professor Huang Yilong for making this article available to me.159 Henderson (1991), 35 points to the dangers of exporting the modern concept of a 'book' into the earlyChinese situation. He cites work by Fu Sinian, who argues that 'even the concept of the book did not existin the Zhou [pre-Qin] era, only p'ien [pian] H (roughly 'chapters'), most of which were on silk rolls orbamboo strips. These p'ien were combined and recombined in diverse ways for various reasons to formcollections, but not books in the modern sense.' The evidence of some early Han manuscripts, which havechapter titles but no book titles suggest that this practice continued well into the era of interest to us.Keegan (1988) shows clearly how this approach can help us understand the origins of a complex textsuch as the Huang di neijing"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"The origins of the work  139been several similar collections differing in material respects. At some point thisgroup, or the member of it whose collection came into the hands of Zhao Shuang,ceased to be active and the collection therefore froze in the state in which it was at thatmoment. It is illusory to seek for significance in the precise moment when this cessationof activity occurred, or in the precise state of the collection at the moment when itceased to grow and change. All we can reasonably do is to identify as far as possiblethe boundaries between the original documents presented as the Zhou hi, and theninvestigate questions of dating separately for each one - so far as that may provepossible.We now come to the second tacit assumption behind earlier studies. It seems to betaken as axiomatic that the date of composition may be found by setting up a series ofdated mathematical and astronomical landmarks against which the Zhou hi can beshifted back and forth until a reasonable fit is achieved between its contents and thecalibrated background. Firstly the book almost certainly does not have the internalcoherence required for this procedure to be meaningful, and secondly we cannotassume that Chinese thought and practice on mathematical and astronomical topicswas in any way unified and monolithic during the relevant period.Arguments of the kind criticised here tend to have the form: The Zhou hi is moreadvanced than document X, but it does not yet contain all the features of document Y.Therefore it can be dated somewhere between the two.' Such an argument might workwell enough for dating (say) successive maps of a railway system during its period ofgrowth. In the realm of ideas, it will not work except within a single lineage of textualtransmission, within which there is likely to be general unity of views at any givenperiod. Without such guaranteed uniformity it is dangerous to assume a unilinearentity called 'Chinese astronomy' against whose development the Zhou hi can becalibrated. And where we have clear evidence of strong dissent on astronomical matters,as we do in the Han dynasty, we cannot assume that everybody thought the same wayeven if they all had equal access to all the relevant information. Under such circumstancesthe conventional dating procedure loses any value it may have had, particularly inview of the sparseness of datable landmarks in the landscape of the astronomicalliterature during the period in question.What follows is therefore not a conventional attempt to 'date the Zhou bi. Myanalysis will take the following form. Firstly I shall look at the internal structure of thebook, and attempt to justify my division of the text into sections. While doing so Ishall summarise the few pieces of evidence that may help to relate the material ofsome sections to datable circumstances. I shall then discuss the interrelations of thesesections, and say whatever can safely be said about their individual relations to datablematerial or events. Next I shall discuss the question of external references (or the lackof them) to the material contained in the collection or to the activities of the putative"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"140  The origins of the workgroup. Finally I shall turn to the question of the historical circumstances under whicha collection of material like the Zhou hi might have been the object of active interestand creativity, and suggest an hypothesis to explain one puzzling feature of the textwe have today.The sections of the Zhou hiDrawing BoundariesIn the main translation, each section is prefaced by an introduction which gives reasonsfor supposing it to be a coherent block of text, and for separating it from the textblocks which precede and follow it. For clarity I now summarise the evidence on thesepoints. The section titles are my own. The present division into two chapters datesonly from the work of Li Chunfeng ^§^JH in the seventh century AD, and hastherefore been ignored in the listing.#A: The book ofShang GaoThere is no difficulty in defining the boundaries of this section, whose style andcontent differ markedly from the rest of the Zhou hi. It opens with the question of theDuke of Zhou, and closes with his expression of satisfaction with the answers he hasreceived from Shang Gao, relating mainly to the trysquare and its mathematicalsignificance, and to numerical lore connected with it.If we reject the traditional attribution to the beginning of the Western Zhou it isdifficult to find internal evidence connecting this section with any particular epoch. Itsmathematical content is too elementary for us to be able to set an upper bound on itsdate on this basis, and its cosmological statements are commonplaces found from thelate Warring States onwards. However, as noted earlier (page 89ff.), some of itsexpressions are closely parallel to those found in an essay by Liu Xin : see Han shu21a, 969-70. It was also pointed out that there was a possible link with references tothe circle and square by Liu Xin's father, Liu Xiang. It therefore seems that therewould be nothing anomalous in such a text having been composed as late as the earlyfirst century AD. The further significance of these textual parallels will be taken upagain in chapter 4 (see page 153ff.).#B: The book of Chen ZiLike section #A, this section begins with a question, this time from Rong Fang addressedto Chen Zi, in which Rong Fang enquires about the possibility of finding the dimensionsof the cosmos by mathematical means. The text which follows has a few relativelyinsignificant confusions, but continues until all the points asked about by Rong Fanghave been met.

There are no obvious reasons for setting a lower boundto the composition of this text.#C: The square and the circleThis fragment hardly deserves to be called a section at all, but stands on its ownbecause it bears little relation to the preceding and following text. On grounds of styleand content it might be a displaced fragment of #A. There is nothing to be said aboutits date, apart from what can be said about #A.#D: The seven hengThis is a long and well-defined section beginning with the words The plan of theseven heng\\ This is the first time the word heng f|j has appeared in the text: for ChenZi the sun's daily circles at the solstices and equinoxes were simply ri dao 0 Jji 'thesolar path'. In addition to creating a new term, this section defines the circlescorresponding to a further eight of the twenty-four qi H,, and points out that the sun ishalf-way between two heng for the other twelve. After the main series of calculationsends with #D15 and two paragraphs of comment, #D18 to #D21 add further notes,some of which may be displaced from earlier in the section.The system of the heng is clearly linked to the system of the twenty-four qi, andmakes no sense without it. We have seen that it is hard to find evidence of the qisystem earlier than the second century BC. A possible lower bound for the material ofthis section is provided by a quotation from one of the apocryphal books current in theearly years of the first century AD. One of them, the Xiaojing yuanshen qi ^Mffitt^ 'The Book of Filial Piety: a contract which quotes the spirits', was almost certainlyforged by a former high official under Wang Mang who tried to make himself emperorin AD 25.160 One fragment which repeats the figures found in the Zhou bi runs:As for the circumference of heaven with its seven heng and six jian intervals, theseare 9833 1/3 li apart, making 119 000 li in all.

This at least confirms that they saw a natural break in the text where I do,which is helpful given the rather confused nature of this section, in which two sequencesof paragraphs seem to be jumbled together. Apart from this, there are other justificationsfor taking this section as a whole. Firstly, despite its confusion, it does contain fairlycoherent statements on the two topics mentioned in my section title. Secondly, it isfairly clear where the preceding and following sections end, and the topics they coverare quite different from those mentioned here. There are no internal indications ofdating in this section, apart from the weak suggestion that the bulge of earth andheaven referred to here may be indicative of hun tian influence during or after the firstcentury BC.#F: The xuan ji; polar and tropical conditionsThis section begins by stating the problem of observing the motions of the xuan ji J#31 object around the celestial pole, and continues to give practical details of how thisis to be done until #F5. The following paragraphs take up the implications of the xuanji radius for polar conditions, and extend the discussion to the tropics. If, as I haveargued, we must reject any attempt to date this section astronomically (see page 127)there are no other independent dating indications in the text of this section.#G: The graduated circle and north polar distancesThe beginning of this section is well defined by an abrupt break with the previoustopic, and the commencement of instructions for laying out a graduated circle on theground and using it for observations of the lodges. Further data on the lodges aregiven in #G11 to #G14, which are also linked with what precedes them by (as I haveargued) their tacit aim of competing with hun tian procedures. Since the hun tianseems to have originated during the first century BC, we have a rough upper bound onthe composition of this section. There is also the fact that the lodge Ox is said to havea width of eight du. Under the old lodge system apparently in use before 104 BC thislodge had a width of nine du: see table 2 (page 18) for the two systems.

An opening paragraph asks for the shadows atthe twenty-four qi, the required data are tabulated, and two subsequent paragraphs"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"The sections of the Zhou bi  143sketch the underlying calculations. As I have mentioned, the present content of thissection is largely the creation of Zhao Shuang himself, who found the older shadowtable unsatisfactory: see appendix 4.Like the system of the heng, the structure of the shadow table is bound up withthe system of the twenty-four qi, which cannot be traced back before the secondcentury BC. As in the old table, the Huai nan zi book (c. 139 BC) has the qi at 15-dayintervals rather than a more precise fraction of the 365 1/4 day solar period. It is hardto know how much weight we should place on the anomalous name of the sixth qi,which violates a Han taboo on the name of an Emperor who reigned from 156 BC. Allthese matters have already been set out above (page 108).#/: Lunar lagThis is a well-ordered and uncorrupt section that obviously stands by itself. Withoutintroduction it launches into a sequence of systematic calculations of changes in themoon's position over various periods of time, and just as abruptly stops. It has noobvious connection with what precedes and follows it. I can think of no useful meansof dating this material, which could have been composed at any epoch in whichcalendrical systems of the quarter-remainder type were in use.#J: Rising, setting and seasonsAfter the well-defined ending of section #1 we have a rather gnomic series of paragraphswhich link the sun's rising and setting positions at the solstices to the twelve 'earthlybranches' and the eight trigrams. This material seems to have little direct connectionwith any other part of the Zhou bi, and has no dating indications. Its interest in the useof the trigrams and the branches as horizon divisions may point to a link with the shicosmic model, which is related to the gai tian as we have seen.#K: Calendrical cyclesThe section begins with a definition of the month, the day and the year, and then listsfive important calendrical cycles. Paragraph #K5 asks a series of questions on thederivation of certain quantities such as the length of the year, and the section (togetherwith the present text of the Zhou bi) ends when these questions have been answered.Parallels with the preface of the system promulgated in AD 85 have been notedearlier, but this may mean no more than that both texts are based on quarter-remaindersystem types. The fact that this section uses the jian xing HM 'Establishment star' asits marker for the winter solstice position is another possible link with the EasternHan, since Jia Kui claims that this is equivalent to his preferred position in Dipper.But this evidence could equally well put the section earlier, since Jia attributes theEstablishment mark-point to four old quarter-remainder type systems current in the"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"144  The origins of the workearly Western Han: see Hou Han shu, zhi 2, 3027. And to complicate matters stillfurther, the account of the Grand Inception reform in Han shu 21a, 975 (but not Shi ji26, 1260) says that its winter solstice marker was the Establishment star, despite JiaKui. Clearly no reliable dating conclusion can be drawn from all this.Making connectionsAt this point the text lies before us broken apart into a number of sections, some withno evident possibility of dating, and some with fairly strong indications of variouskinds. Moving on to the next stage, I shall try to see how far it is possible to drawconnections between the sections, and examine how far this may be consistent withthe dating evidence available.In the first place, as we have seen, a number of sections seem to have no obviousconnection with any of the others, except in the sense that they are all ancient Chinesetexts concerned with astronomy and mathematics. In this group I would include #A,#C, the original version of #H before Zhao Shuang's revision, #1, #J and #K.Of the rest (#B, #D, #E, #F, #G) I am inclined to place #B, The Book of Chen Zi1at the head of the rest. If it is removed from the corpus the rest of the related texts aredeprived of the essential foundation of the shadow rule, and since some deal withproblems unsolved by Chen Zi they lose much of their motivation. Next I think wemust place #D The Seven Heng\\ Although Chen Zi evidently has not heard of theheng, at least under that name, #D systematises and expands his scheme by bringing itinto accordance with the sequence of the twenty-four qi. Paragraph #E7 refers to theheng and therefore knows of #D, and other parts of this section make statementswhich draw on #B. With its discussion of the xuan ji #F sets out to solve Chen Zi'spolar problem, and it also mentions the heng system. Section #G is aware of both thexuanji and the heng.It seems therefore that we may have located the core of the Zhou hi in this orderedsequence of related sections, which by analogy with certain other ancient Chinesetexts we might perhaps call the nei pian F*3f| 'inner sections'. Section #B is the heartof the work, further developed by #D, and with the three closely related sections #E,#F and #G building upon the first two. Let us briefly recall the sparse dating evidencewe have assembled so far in relation to these sections:#B: Some pre-Qin parallels; no lower bound.#D: Link with 24 qi suggests possibly later than third century BC; a possiblequotation c. AD 25 sets lower bound.#E: A weak possibility of hun tian influence setting an upper bound of 100 BC.#F: No dating indications."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"Early external evidence  145#G: Clear influence of hun tian and use of new lodge system sets upper boundaround 100 BC; no lower bound.All we can say at this point is that such dating indications as there are do notcontradict the logical relations of the sections, or their sequence as they appear in thepresent text. It would be easy to be tempted to the conclusion that the sections datesomething like this:#B: pre-Qin to early Han.#D: Early Western Han.#E, #F, #G: First century BC.But on the evidence so far before us there is no reason at all why the wholecollection could not have been written within a single short period at a relatively latedate, so long as section #D was available for quotation by AD 25. And of course it ispossible that the quotation in the Xiaojing yuanshen qi was not directly from the Zhoubi at all, but from some other source on which the present text of the Zhou bi itselfdrew later. At this point we certainly cannot claim to have pinned the text down. Letus turn to external evidence to see if it will help us.Early external evidenceThe Han shu bibliographyThe Han shu sets the trend for later standard histories by being the first to include abibliographical chapter yi wen zhi 8^/K. Ban Gu Iff H3 tells us that he compiled thischapter on the basis of work by Liu Xin jKJJrfc. Liu's work was a continuation of aproject that his father Liu Xiang §HJ[H] (77-6 BC) had begun in the time of EmperorCheng J^c (r. 32-7 BC), when an effort was made to collect books from the wholeempire. Shortly after Liu Xiang's death came the accession of Emperor Ai JR in 5 BC,by which time Wang Mang was already wielding great influence at court. He was anold friend of Liu Xin, and had him promoted to high rank. Under his patronage LiuXin compiled his 'Seven Summaries' Qi lue -fcB§, based on his father's work.161Ban Gu does not claim to have done any independent bibliographical research, sohis monograph represents a summary of the imperial holdings made close to 5 BC.161 For Ban Gu's account see the preface to his bibliographical monograph, Han shu 30, 1701. Liu Xin'sbiography also describes his commission from Wang (36, 1967) and his early friendship with the futureusurper (36, 1972). After Wang seized power, Liu Xin remained one of Wang's most loyal supportersuntil late into his reign."},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"146  The origins of the workWhen we turn to this chapter, we look in vain for any title resembling the Zhou hi.The nearest we get (which is not very near) is in the section on calendrical astronomy.There we find, in addition to descriptions of various calendrical systems:The Book of Solar Shadows' Ri Gui ShuUW. 34 juan #'The Mathematical Methods of Xu Shang' Xu Shang suan shu f^Fp8}J|C$|cf: 26 juan'The Mathematical Methods of Du Zhong' Du Zhong suan shu tiJfi Jf^j: 16 juan(Han shu, 30, 1766)It therefore seems probable that the Zhou bi was not in the imperial collectionwhen Liu Xin worked on it. Of course this by no means proves that it was not yet inexistence in any form.Yang Xiong, Wang Chong and Cai YongWe have already seen that sometime around the time when Liu Xin was working onhis bibliography Huan Tan tBi¥ was arguing Yang Xiong tl§3£ out of his belief inthe gai tian (chapter 1). Huan Tan tells us that Yang Xiongtook it that the heavens were a cover gai H always rotating leftwards [i.e. whenone faces the pole], with the sun moon and stars following it from east to west. Sohe drew a diagram of its form with the graduations of its movements, and checkedit against the four seasons, the calendrical constants, dusk and dawn and day andnight. (Taiping yulan 2, 6b-7a)There is nothing here to force us to believe that Yang Xiong had seen any of thedocuments that now make up the Zhou bi. On the other hand it does sound as if hisdiagram had some sort of quantitative basis, in which case he may have producedsomething resembling the work of Chen Zi or the system of the seven heng. Thedetails given are however insufficient for us to say anything definite. This is a pity, forhis position at court would have given him easy access to the imperial collection,which was in the charge of his younger contemporary and admirer Liu Xin.The same cannot be said of Wang Chong 3E^E (c. AD 27-100), which is again apity from our point of view, since we can therefore deduce relatively little from hislengthy discussion of issues related to the gai tian in his Lun heng tmW written c. AD83. It is in fact what Wang Chong does not say that is important from our presentpoint of view. He never mentions the term zhou bi, and although he refers to achariot-cover gai H as an analogue for heaven, he never mentions the term gai tian H5^.162 He shows no knowledge of Chen Zi's use of gnomons and the shadow rule to162 Lun heng 11, 8b-9b. It is however interesting that he refers to the illusion that heaven is like an'overturned bowl1 fu pen US (11, 9b), when in fact it is really flat and level like earth. One is remindedof the reference to earth being like an 'overturned pan' in #E6, although this is probably a coincidence."},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"Early external evidence  147establish celestial dimensions.163 Although he knows the theory that the apparentjoining of heaven and earth and the rising and setting of the heavenly bodies are to beexplained by the limited range of human sight, he puts no figure to this range, apartfrom the vague indication that it is to be reckoned in tens of thousands of //.164On the whole, all that the evidence of Yang Xiong and Wang Chong can tell us isthat the gai tian was a live issue in the first century AD. We can deduce nothing aboutthe Zhou hi or any part of it. With Cai Yong iPr§| the case is different. His memorialof c. AD 180 has already been discussed in a different context in chapter 1, but it isworth returning to see it in a different light. It will be recalled that he mentioned thethree 'schools' jia iC of those who 'talk about the body of heaven', one of which iscalled zhou hi. However:The computational methods of the Zhou hi are all extant, but if they are comparedwith the celestial phenomena they are mostly in error, so the astronomical officialsdo not use them. (Hou Han shu, zhi 10, 3217, comm.)This thoroughgoing rejection gives us our first positive lead. Whereas Yang Xiongand Huan Tan simply refer to 'the gai tian' Cai Yong uses a term which links hiswords firmly with the book of Chen Zi, which is the core of the collection whosehistory we are trying to trace. The likelihood that he is referring to a document ratherthan to a set of orally transmitted techniques is made clear by his later lamentationsthat in a long search of the official archives he had (by contrast, it is implied) failed tofind any books giving details of the hun tian. And clearly whatever book he saw gavefairly full quantitative details. Given that Zhao Shuang may have been writing hiscommentary not very long after 180 AD, the best bet seems to be that Cai Yong sawsomething like the text of the Zhou hi we have today.Dating Zhao ShuangThe nature and contents of Zhao Shuang's M^commentary have already been discussed,principally in chapter 2. My purpose now is to try to set a date for his work, and hencefor the closure of the canon of the Zhou hi.At the latest, Zhao Shuang must have written at some time before the middle ofthe sixth century AD, for that is when the second commentator Zhen Luan HLH163 Thus he tells us (Lun heng 11, 13a-b) that one degree of daily movement by the sun is equal to 2000//. This is not too far from the figure given for a degree on the innermost heng in #D8, but it still lookslike a guess designed to yield the figure of 1000 // in the day and 1000 li in the night which he then gives.Wang seems to have no conception of the heng system with its degrees of different lengths. The diameterof the sun is given as 1000 li, evidently another round figure (11,18a), and incompatible with the degreesize given earlier. Heaven is 'more than 60 000 li from the earth1 (11, 19b).164 Lun heng 11, lOa-b."},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"148  The origins of the workworked, and Zhen is clearly writing with Zhao's commentary before him as well as theoriginal text. As we shall see below (page 163), Zhao's commentary is mentioned inthe catalogue of the imperial collection of the Sui dynasty (AD 581-618). Zhao'spreface refers to Zhang Heng's W?$8 essay Ling Xian MIS of around AD 120, so wehave a closed time-bracket, although still a rather wide one. Looking through Zhao'scommentary, we find in section #K two references to the Qian xiang ^z^ system ofmathematical astronomy created by Liu Hong §!]^ near the end of the Han (75f and79c in Qian's edition).165 When the Han state fell apart into the Three Kingdoms, thissystem was in official use in the southern state of Wu ^ from AD 220 to 280.166 As aminimum hypothesis we can therefore move the lower bound for Zhao's work toaround AD 200, and if we assume he is using the official calendrical system of histime and place, he can be taken as a resident of Wu working sometime in the thirdcentury AD. We shall see later (pages 16If.) that Zhao may well have copied fromwork by Liu Hui that was probably not written until after AD 263. Taking thisevidence together with that of Cai Yong, it seems safe to conclude that the Zhou hiwas not added to after around AD 200.The formation and closure of the collectionIt will be useful to sum up the evidence so far. I have suggested that in the Zhou hi wecan identify a core of closely related material, the later portions of which cannot beearlier than the first century BC because of the clear influence of the hun tian. Thecollection had not reached the imperial library by around 5 BC, but at some timebefore his death in AD 18 it seems that Yang Xiong may have had access to similarmaterial. There are strong signs that the book was in existence around AD 200.What more is there to say? It is worthwhile to consider two further aspects of theorigins of the Zhou bi which have not usually been discussed. In the first place, howand by whom might such a collection have been formed and used? Secondly, whenand under what circumstances might the canon have been closed to produce the workthat came into the hands of Zhao Shuang? Let us begin by considering some relevantpoints about the nature of early Chinese intellectual activity so far as it relates to theproduction and transmission of texts.Disciples, databases and early Chinese booksThe earliest Chinese references to the terms gai tian or zhou bi do not associate themwith any Chinese equivalent of the word 'theory'. Yang Xiong simply uses gai tian on165SeeJinshull, 498.166 San guozhi 47, 1129."},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"The formation and closure of the collection  149its own {Fa yan £&\"§, Sibu beiyao edn, 10, lb). As we have already seen, about AD180 Cai Yong lists the zhou hi as one of the three jia ic (conventionally translated as'schools') which 'talk about the body of heaven' lun tian ti Mf^fl. What then was ajia, and what did it do?Firstly, as mentioned above, Cai Yong's use of the term jia seems to be primarilydoxographic. The activity that generated the points of view he mentions is for himessentially something that happened in the past rather than a controversy betweenliving protagonists identified with each jia. Had the latter been the case, we mighthave expected him to name names, but he does not. Of one jia, the xuan ye HLM, hecan tell us nothing at all but its title. As for the zhou hi, he evidently has seen somedocuments, for otherwise it is hard to make sense of his claim that its mathematicalmethods are all extant, shu shu zhu cun WMtfWi^' The existence of ihtjia of whichhe approves, the hun tian, is only attested by the instruments (and presumably theassociated observational and computational procedures?)used by astronomical officials.It is hard to avoid the conclusion that the three entities he groups together are ratherdifferent sorts of things.Is it possible to find any social reality underlying Cai Yong's doxographicalanalysis? To a large extent it is true that the term jia is an 'observer category' ratherthan an 'actor category'. I cannot myself recall any instance of an early Chinese thinkeridentifying himself as belonging to a specific jia. So far as there is self-identificationwith a particular group, it is a matter of saying who one's teacher was, and who taughthim.167 It is this master-pupil succession that constitutes the social form of ancientChinese intellectual activity, and the essential transaction between master and pupil isthe transmission of a text, not just in the sense of handing over a book (or more likelyallowing one's pupil to make a copy of it) but more importantly in the sense ofinforming the pupil how the text was to be interpreted and put into practice.A general presupposition of this transaction is that one's teacher is possessed ofauthentic knowledge of the texts and their interpretation which others do not have -thus the intellectual lineage defines itself in distinction from those outside it.168 Thetext transmitted was not in every case immutable, but might change by growth or167 Thus see, for instance, the replies of the early Han physician Chunyu Yi S^^fi to the interrogatoryaddressed to him during the political purge after the rebellion of 154 BC: Shi ji 105, 2794, 2815 and2816. Of course it is unlikely that the pattern of training of a Han astronomer was identical to that of aphysician.168 Continuing the example of Chunyu Yi, we are told that his teacher Yang Qing MM 'passed on to him(chuan M) the pulse books of Huang Di Hit and Bian Que Sal' Shi ji 105, 2794. Later (105, 2810)Chunyu Yi has a confrontation with Sui M, a royal physician of the king of Qi J?, who cites the text of awriting by Bian Que. Chunyu Yi's reply admits that the text does contain those particular words, butstresses that they must be interpreted in the context of proper practice. It is presumably precisely thisinterpretative method that he would have learned from Yang Qing at the time he was given access to thetexts, an advantage which the physician Sui evidently did not have."},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"750  The origins of the workattrition in the process of transmission or in response to outside demands.169 Theprocess was made easier by the fact that most Han 'books' would have consisted of anumber of separate rolls of bamboo strips linked by cord,170 so that the subtraction oraddition of a section was not a matter of tearing out pages from a codex, or splicingextra lengths into a scroll. The relevant model is not the Jewish sofer counting all theletters in his Torah scroll to make sure he has copied it correctly, but rather a networkedcomputer database to which some have read-only access, but which some privilegedusers may from time to time be allowed to modify. Perhaps it would be more accuratein the present case to say that they allowed themselves to modify the database, and wemust also note that one did not admit openly that the charismatic text solemnlyreceived from one's own teacher had actually needed modification. That did not stopmodification occurring, however. When such a database ceases to change, it is a signthat the group which used it is no longer active. Similarly, when an ancient Chinesetext ceased to change it would be a sign that the lineage whose possession it had beenwas effectively defunct. At such a time it might be given a written commentary inwhich later scholars attempted with more or less success to reconstruct the essentialinterpretative tradition which had once been given orally by masters to their disciples.Later commentators might aim to elucidate or expand on their predecessors. This iswhat happened to a large number of early texts from the Eastern Han dynasty onwards,and the Zhou bi was no exception.171For discussion of a much more complex example of text formation, see the analysisof the Huang di nei jing ffn?fp3$§? 'Inner Canon of the Yellow Emperor' corpus inDavid Keegan (1988). Keegan argues forcibly that the present state of this importanttext is the result of the grouping and regrouping of a number of shorter documents,some independent of each other, and others designed to explicate or attack earliertexts. Such processes are similar to those which I believe led to the formation of thereceived text of the Zhou bi, and would have taken place at about the same time.The context of collectionWhen and where might we find a group which might have written or assembled the169 See for instance the account of the development of the Mohist canon in Graham (1978), 22-5.170 This physical structure gives rise to a peculiarly Chinese form of bibliographical disaster when thecords holding the strips together perish, and one is left with a disordered heap to be sorted to the best ofone's ability and restrung. Such a process leads to the situation where one finds a series of short but fairlycoherent passages with little or no logic in their order. It is easy to find such examples in the present textof the Zhou bi. Even if this does not happen to the whole roll at once, the end of a roll is peculiarlyvulnerable to damage.171 For an illuminating account of the origins and functions of commentarial activity in China and theWest, see Henderson (1991)."},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"The formation and closure of the collection 151Zhou bi collection? As for the 'when' of this question, since the group postulated musthave been active after the rise of the hun tian in the first century BC, I am reluctant togo further back than the beginning of the Han for its origins at the very earliest. TheZhou bi is not of a length or complexity that requires centuries for its formation. WhileI agree with Angus Graham that the mathematical traditions of the book may go backto pre-Qin Mohist work of the kind possibly represented in the anomalous addendumto Huai nan zi chapter 3, the dialogue of Chen Zi and Rong Fang resembles no Mohisttext that has come down to us.172Where in Han society might such a group have operated? The Zhou bi is primarilya book about the heavens, and the stereotyped scholarly view is that in China suchmatters were the province of astronomical officials. Like all stereotypes, this has sometruth behind it. The first Western scholars to study the topic were rightly impressed bythe fact that Chinese governments had maintained an astronomical establishment overtwo millennia, in contrast to the situation in the cultures with which they were familiar.The stereotype is reinforced by the fact that the overwhelming majority of our materialson Chinese astronomy are of official origin, in the form of the monographs in thestandard histories from the Shiji onwards.But if the Zhou bi was a book produced in official circles, it would surely havebeen available to Liu Xin when he conducted his bibliographical researches around 5BC. Further, why is it that the book shows no signs of the constants of the GrandInception system with its 81 month divisor, which was in official use during the wholeof the first century BC? On the contrary, section #K sets out to introduce the beginnerto the basic logic of the quarter-remainder system type, a form of calendrical systemthat was out of official use from 104 BC to AD 85.In fact it is not difficult to find evidence pointing to considerable astronomicalactivity outside the specialists of the astronomical establishment throughout much ofthe Western Han. The first person in charge of calendrical matters under the Han wasZhang Cang 5H:lf, a statesman and generalist rather than a technician.173 In 166-167BC Zhang's position on calendrical astronomy was successfully attacked by GongsunChen, ^fi^E a commoner from the eastern state of Lu, who was then appointed tohigh office.174 In the lead-up to the Grand Inception reform of 104 BC an importantrole was played by propaganda submitted to the Emperor Wu by Gongsun Qing, £;^HP an adventurer in the tradition of fang shi 7f dt from the old region of Qi H on thenorth-eastern coastline. He put forward a skilful blend of calendrical mathematics and172 See Graham (1978), 371.173 Shiji 96,2681.174 Shiji 28, 1381; see also 26, 1260 and 10, 429-30."},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"752  The origins of the worksuggestions as to how the Emperor might emulate the legendary Yellow Emperor inattaining immortality.175The reform itself involved the assembly of a group which involved officials suchas Sima Qian R] MS, but also more than twenty calendrical experts 'from among thepeople' minjian zhi li zhe KfUJ^p^ff, including the fang shi Tang Du jj|f#[5 who hadbeen the teacher of Sima Qian's father, and Luoxia Hong ^\"I^IU, who we havealready heard of as the reputed creator of the hun tian.176 Twenty-seven years after thereform in 78 BC a crisis was caused when the Grand Astrologer (Tai shi linghimself, Zhang Shouwang 3HH3:, submitted a memorial attacking the official systemand calling for the adoption (or as he claimed the re-adoption) of the 'Yellow Emperor'scalendar'.177 The matter was only settled after a three-year program of observationsand seems to have been connected with the fact noted by Liu Xin that 'Amongst thepeople there are various [versions of] the Yellow Emperor's calendar' but, he addswith appropriate establishment loyalty 'they are not as perspicuous as those recordedby the astronomical officials.'178 And finally, matters of calendrical astronomy as wellas celestial portents were central to the prolific chan wei tHHl texts that were widelyproduced from the time of Wang Mang onwards. One of these, as we have seen,seems to be quoting the Zhou bi: see page 141.Enough has now been said to show that it is easy to find a social basis for theformation of a collection such as the Zhou bi in the circumstances of the Western Han,and particularly in the period from about 100 BC onwards when much of the core textof the work must have been written, since only in that period could it have beensubject to the influence of the hun tian. In the same way that the Zhou bi group seemsto have taken up a position of opposition to the hun tian, it is interesting that it alsoseems to have resisted calendrical orthodoxy in its partisanship of the quarter-remaindersystem type. One hesitates a little to make a straightforward link with the partisans ofthe 'Yellow Emperor's calendar' mentioned by Liu Xin, partly because the Zhou biascribes the origin of its data to other figures,179 and partly because its lack of aspecified system origin means that the Zhou bi does not actually contain all thenecessary information for a functioning calendrical system. But the core of the Zhoubi was certainly largely the work of a self-consciously partisan group.175 See Cullen (1993).176 Han shu2l2L, 975.177 Han shu 21a, 978.178 Hou Han shu, zhi 2, 3037. Perhaps it is also to Liu Xin that we owe the complaints in the calendricalsection of the Han shu bibliography, where we read that only the most talented should concern themselveswith such matters, and that only trouble will ensue if commoners try to study the heavens: 30, 1767.179 Section #K speaks of Bao fe [=Fu #c] Xi $i and Shen Nong # Jt as laying down the basic structureof calendrical astronomy. Both these persons were commonly though to have reigned before the YellowEmperor."},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"The formation and closure of the collection  153The context of closureIf we are forced to guess the name of the founder of the group who formed the Zhoubi, there are no other obvious candidates apart from Chen Zi ISt^p, 'Master Chen'himself. Unlike Shang Gao he does not seem to be intended as a representative of highantiquity chosen to lend the text an air of authority, and his teaching is so prosaic thatit seems unreasonable to assume that there was never a Master Chen who taught anequally unfamous Rong Fang. If this is so, it does not seem impossible that Rong Fanghimself may have gone on to add section #D with its innovation of the heng, and thatfinally his pupil or pupils built the defensive structure of the remaining core sectionsnei plan as the challenge of the hun tian appeared. The last of these, #G is the first inwhich 'method' paragraphs form an integral part of the text, and it may be that theauthor of this section added the few such paragraphs found in earlier sections. Finallysomeone added various pieces of related material to form sections #H to #K. Some ofthese may have been written by members of the group, and some may have beencopied from other sources. On the evidence so far before us, it is hard to tell just whenthe group ceased to work and the canon was closed. Of course it is quite possible thatMaster Chen and his disciple are figments of an anonymous author.There is however a possibility of explaining how the text took on its final form,and it has the merit of providing a role for section #A, which is extremely hard torelate to the likely interests of a group that might have wanted to assemble the othersections of the Zhou hi. We have already seen that it makes good sense to see section#B, the 'Book of Chen Zi' as the core of a collection that, naturally enough, consists ofa series of documents tagged on after it. But section #A, with which #B has noconnection, is at the head of the whole. How can this have come about by any rationalprocess? Books do not, after all, come together without intentional human activity.Someone must have added section #A to the front of the book for some reason.Tentatively, but with the conviction that it will be hard to find a more attractiveexplanation, I suggest the following process.The story of Wang Mang's rise to power has already crossed the path of ournarrative several times, and we must now return to it. As already mentioned, Wangsaw to it that his old friend Liu Xin was appointed to high office around 5 BC. In AD1, Wang moved a step closer to imperial power when Emperor Ping ^P came to thethrone at the age of nine. The young ruler was in fact under the control of the EmpressDowager, of whose clan Wang Mang was a member. The levers of power thus cameinto his hands, and he became regent with the title of An Han Gong ^/H^ TheDuke bringing tranquillity to the Han'. At his investiture he saw to it that memorialswere sent in comparing him to the ancient Duke of Zhou, famed for his selflessnessand lack of personal ambition when he was regent in the infancy of King Cheng ^ of"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"154  The origins of the workZhou in the eleventh century BC.180 At the same time Wang appointed Liu Xin to thenew office of Xi-He ^JH^P, whose title referred to the astronomical officials of theancient sage Emperor Yao H (see above, page 3). Perhaps in deference to the memoryof the Duke, Wang waited until the young Emperor died under mysterious circumstancesbefore forcing another minor heir to abdicate in his favour in AD 9.In AD 5, the year of the Emperor Ping's death, Wang launched what can only bedescribed as a public relations offensive aimed at recruiting learned men outsideofficial circles to his cause, partly no doubt with the aim of increasing his popularity,and partly because he felt that the new dynasty he was planning would need newexpertise. Liu Xin had already supervised the construction of ritual buildings onancient models:So that the Han would be in correspondence with King Wen's [construction of] hisNuminous Tower, and the Duke of Zhou's founding of Luo[-Yang], {Han shu 12,359)Then, the text continues:He summoned those throughout the Empire who had comprehensive understandingof lost classical texts, ancient records, astrology, calendrical reckoning, mathematicalharmonics, minor studies, historical documents, arts of all kinds, pharmacognosy,including those who taught the Five Classics, the Lun yu Itfg the Xiao Jing #M,and the Er Ya Wf£. They were to be forwarded through the government relaysystem in carriages driven [or: provided] by themselves, under a single seal [out ofa possible five]. Those who arrived amounted to several thousand persons.And, we are told elsewhere:[Wang Mang] caused the Xi-He official Liu Xin and his colleagues to enter [theconclusions of the meeting] into orderly records and to submit them as memorials;the discussions were highly detailed. Therefore I [Ban Gu] have eliminated hereticalexpressions, and selected the orthodox meaning, and set them out in the followingsection. {Han shu 21a, 955)The summary of the conference proceedings occupy most of the rest of the chapter,and end on page 972 with an encomium evidently addressed to Wang Mang, praisinghim as a sage like Emperor Shun ^ of old for 'giving a general invitation to thelearned, [to conduct] broad deliberations'.Now as we have already seen, parts of this summary bear a striking resemblanceto the cryptic paragraphs of section #A. The reference to 'folding a trysquare' and tothe relations between squares and circles are particular examples, but the general tone180Han shu 12, 348-9."},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"The formation and closure of the collection  155of both documents is remarkably similar. In #A both Fu Xi and Yu are mentioned asoriginators of the mathematical order of the cosmos. We know that Liu Xin gave bothof these figures a similarly important role, and believed that at the beginning of theZhou dynasty the Shang worthy Ji Zi JE^f1 had passed on this knowledge to King WuS].181 In a similar way, section #A purports to be the record of a conversation betweenthe Duke of Zhou and another Shang worthy. In general, section #A resembles suchparts of the Han shu much more than it resembles other parts of the Zhou hi. Aparallel with expressions used by Liu Xiang about squares and circles was notedearlier.Given the fact that Wang Mang specifically claimed to be like the Duke of Zhou(not to mention the fact that he clearly wanted to found a new dynasty), things fall intoplace. Clearly it was an attractive proposition to be summoned to Wang's conferenceand to be entertained at the public expense, perhaps with the prospect of more lastingbenefits to follow if one could make one's talents seem desirable enough. Suppose onehad a copy of the 'Book of Chen Zi' and the later material appended to it. Why not seeif that would get one invited? Better still, why not preface it with something likely toappeal to what was known to be Wang's preferred self image as the Great Regent, andpreferably a little more in tune with the cosmic numerology favoured at court than therather plain technicalities of the main body of the text? Of course, the fact that thesummary of proceedings in the Han shu concentrates on matters of mensuration maymean that a potential participant would have in any case have had reason to feel thatthe relevance of the main conference theme to the 'Book of Chen Zi' was fairly close,since the latter deals with the dimensions of the cosmos. And so the book was broughtto Chang'an, presented to the court, and waited in the archives about two hundredyears until it was read and contemptuously dismissed by Cai Yong. When it came intoZhao Shuang's hands it had suffered some damage, but not enough to render itunintelligible. Thus it came down to us, headed by its carefully calculated prefacewhich had ensured its preservation in official files.Some such story is at least a possible explanation of why someone might haveadded to the front of the main body of the text a preface which refers to the Duke ofZhou, and which undeniably resembles what we know of the doctrines expounded atWang Mang's AD 5 conference. Presumably potential participants had a fairly clearidea of what was expected of them, and did their best to produce appropriate material.It also explains why Liu Xin had not yet seen the text of the Zhou hi when he workedon his bibliography in 5 BC, despite its later currency. I certainly do not claim to haveproved that this story is a true one. It is, on the other hand, a plausible explanation ofthe evidence, and renders the present state of the Zhou hi text a lot less mysterious181 See the introduction to the monograph on the Five Phases, Han shu 27a, 1315.

From the Han dynasty onwards the nature of our discussion changes, forthe Zhou bi is no longer the property of an active group of astronomical thinkers, butbecomes a classical text subject to the labours of commentators and editors.So far it has been necessary to be cautious in speaking of 'the Zhou bi\\ for wehave had no guarantee that the term referred to anything that had yet taken on a fixedform and content.

Theobject of this section is to tell the story of how the Zhou bi came down to the presentday.

These centuries werenot 'Dark Ages' like those suffered by Western Europe after the fall of Rome, but theChina that emerged from this age was very different from the Han. Amongst otherrapid social and cultural changes, the greatest of all was the advent of Buddhism fromIndia, and its successful establishment as a central element in the lives of manyChinese. Regional differences became stronger in the absence of a central authority,and in particular the experiences of China north and south of the Yangzi river divergedmarkedly. While the north was often dominated by military rulers whose origins laywith the nomadic peoples of the Asian steppes, the south was ruled by a series ofaristocratic groups who prided themselves on their role as preservers of ancient Chinese"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"158  The later history of the Zhou biculture, despite their residence beyond the former pale of civilisation marked by thegreat river.

Now by good fortune we happen to know that thegreat mathematician Liu Hui HU® wrote his commentary on the Jiu zhang suan shuAiSJf^J in AD 263, and he appears to have lived in the northern state of Wei S!t.182Is there any possibility of getting another 'fix' on Zhao Shuang or the Zhou bi throughthe work of Liu Hui?Unfortunately no explicit reference to either Zhao or the Zhou bi appears in Liu'swork, and Zhao refers neither to Liu or to the Jiu zhang suan shu itself. This is nosurprise, given that these two men may have lived in states that were at war with eachother, in an age without any institutions for the systematic dissemination of scientificinformation. It has however often been argued that there is an obvious connectionbetween their work. Thus for example in their history of Chinese mathematics Li Yanand Du Shiran say:because work from [Zhao Shuang's] essay 'Diagrams of base and altitude, circleand square1, [see appendix 1] is used in the Commentary of the Nine Chapters onthe Mathematical Art (for Problems 5 and 11 in the Gougu chapter of the NineChapters [chapter 9 of the Jiu zhang suan shu]) it is possible to say that he livedlater than Zhao Shuang. (Li and Du (1987), 65)If one turns to the text of Liu Hui's commentary, the situation is not quite sostraightforward as this might suggest. As I have already said, Liu makes no directreference to Zhao Shuang's work. Nevertheless, in his explanations of the algorithmswhich the Jiu zhang suan shu gives for the solution of problems involving Pythagoras'theorem Liu refers to diagrams (now lost) which were evidently very similar to thoseunderlying Zhao's essay. An apparently successful attempt to restore the lost diagramsis made by Dai Zhen in his edition of the Jiu zhang for the Siku quanshu.182 See Sui shu 16, 404. However in his commentary to problem 32 of chapter 1 of the Jiu zhang suanshu AiSHW (p. 193 in the edition of Guo Shuchun (1990)) Liu refers to a bronze measure of the timeof Wang Mang stored in the arsenal of the Jin # dynasty, which began in AD 265, so it appears that hiswork may have been added to under the new government."},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"The Zhou bi in the period of division  159Let us look first at the solution to the fifth problem of the Nine Chapters. SinceLiu's commentary rather than the main text is our concern, I will save time by sayingthat this problem amounts to no more than finding the hypotenuse when a base of 20and an altitude of 21 are given. These numbers have obviously been chosen to makethe student's job easier, since they yield a whole-number solution of 29. There is theslight complication that because the 'base' in such problems is conventionally taken asshorter than the 'altitude', the Nine Chapters text takes as 'base' and 'altitude' quantitiesrepresenting lengths which are in fact respectively vertical and horizontal in the physicalsituation described, and Liu is concerned to deal with any difficulty this might presentto the reader. Part of his commentary runs:So we may simply say that the numbers of the two superficies [or 'areas': seebelow] have simply been switched round within the hypotenuse superficies. Wemay go on to put one outside the other, with the one situated within forming asquare superficies and the one situated outside forming a try square superficies. Thetwo outer and inner shapes are transformed but the numbers are balanced. Notefurther, that in this diagram the trysquare of the base superficies is green, andwraps round the outside of the white [part of the diagram]. This [is the case when]its superficies has the altitude-hypotenuse difference as its breadth, and thealtitude-hypotenuse sum as its length, while the altitude superficies is the squarewithin ... [Liu then repeats the description with the roles of base and altitudereversed, and points out that the exchange does not make any difference ofprinciple].(Jiu zhang suan shu, 9, 420-1 in Guo Shuchun edn (1990))Comparison with Zhao Shuang's essay translated in appendix 1 does show severalinstances of word for word parallels here. One systematic difference is however in thewords used for 'area'. Zhao used shih Ijf, whereas Liu uses mi Id, which I render hereas 'superficies' to make the distinction clear. Let us turn to the other example mentionedby Li and Du before coming to any conclusions.The eleventh problem of chapter 9 deals with a door whose height is greater thanits breadth by six chi R eighteen \"\\f [= 68 cun], and whose diagonal is one zhang j£[= 100 cun]. It is required to find the height and width of the door, which turn out tobe 96 cun and 28 cun, again an instance of a whole number solution arranged fordidactic ease. We thus have a problem in which we know the hypotenuse and thedifference of the base and altitude, with base and altitude to be found. In the light ofthe previous parallels, one looks at Zhao's essay for a passage relating to a diagraminvolving the base-altitude difference, and figure 17 of appendix 1 is the only likelycandidate. Interestingly enough, it will be recalled, this is the only diagram to whichZhao actually refers explicitly in his essay. In present texts of the Zhou bi this is the'hypotenuse diagram' xian tu ^H, the first of the three figures that have apparently"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"160  The later history of the Zhou bibeen handed down since Zhen Luan. In the light of that diagram Liu Hui's text is easyto follow:Referring to the diagram for the positions, the hypotenuse superficies just fills10 000 [square] cun. Double it, subtract the base-altitude difference superficies,divide to open the square. What you get is the number of the sum of height andbreadth. Subtract the difference from the sum and halve it [i.e. the remainder], andthis is the width of the door. Add the number by which the one is greater than theother [i.e. the given height-breadth difference] and this is the height of the door.Now this method first finds the half. One zhang [i.e. the hypotenuse] multipliedby itself gives four of the red superficies, and one yellow superficies. Halve thedifference [of the two sides] and multiply by itself. Now double again {whichmakes two fourths of the yellow superficies}.183 Halve the excess, and you havetwo of the red superficies and one quarter of the yellow superficies. With respect tothe large square you have got a quarter. So divide to open the square, and you gethalf the number of the height-breadth sum. Subtract the half of the difference, andyou get the breadth; add, and you get the height of the door.Further, referring to the areas in the diagram, if you sum the base andaltitude [superficies] with one another and add the difference superficies, and thensubtract the hypotenuse area, it is [the same as] the accumulation [of the areaspreviously summed?]. So you first see the hypotenuse, and then know the base andaltitude (Jiu zhang suan shu 9, 423-4 in Guo Shuchun edn (1990))Once more, reference to Zhao's essay reveals clear parallels with Liu Hui's text.But who is drawing on whom? We could avoid the difficulty by supposing that bothwere drawing on some otherwise unknown source, but despite the communicationdifficulties if Liu and Zhao were approximate contemporaries, mathematical geniuses(like other entities) are perhaps not to be multiplied without good reason. While Liand Du take it that Liu Hui had read Zhao's work, I strongly suspect that if there wasinfluence it was the other way round. My reasons are as follows.(1) Zhao's assorted manipulations of areas are almost completely unmotivated byany reference to problems. As such they are anomalous in the history of Chinesemathematics. The only reason he gives us this material seems to be that he wantsto add some substance to his unsatisfactory attempts to elucidate the references totrysquares in section #A of the Zhou bi. The idea that Zhao summoned theseprocedures out of thin air as mathematics for mathematics' sake, and that Liu Hui183 The text is defective here. I follow the emendation of Guo Shuchun given in curly brackets, but it isnot easy to see the point of the procedure, nor of the phrase immediately following. Since I am not hereengaged in studying Liu's methods for their own sake, I will let the point pass."},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"The Zhou bi in the period of division  161later put them to use in relation to the problems in the Nine Chapters strikes me asbizarre.(2) Liu Hui explicitly refers to the green and white diagrams in his original text(now lost) which were equivalent to the reconstructed figures 19 and 23 whichseem to underlie part of Zhao's discussion. Zhao however mentions no diagrams,although they would be obvious aids to someone expounding such matters for thefirst time. It seems likely that he is simply pillaging Liu Hui's text for his ownpurposes.(3) From his voluminous work on the Nine Chapters and from his other mathematicalwork, it is clear that Liu Hui was a creative mathematician of a high order. Apartfrom the short essay in question, Zhao shows few other signs of mathematicalprowess. I find it more likely that he borrowed from Liu than that a small portionof Liu's work is borrowed from Zhao.(4) Finally, a significant point emerges from Zhao's essay on gougu £j$£ relations.In his commentary on part of the garbled and obscure paragraph #A3 Zhao usesthe expression '[the text] is about to apply [this relation] to a myriad things, sohere it first sets out the proportions': jiang yi shi yu wan shi, er ci xian chen qi luye ffi£XM^M9Mfo*kWMMfa- In his commentary on the third problem ofchapter 9, Liu Hui remarks, referring to the lucid opening sections of the text onwhich he is commenting '[the text] is about to apply [this relation] to variousproportions, so it first writes out these workings to show the source': jiang yi shiyu zhu lu, gu xianju ci shu yijian qi yuan f($i^Sfi^^^^^Mltk#ji^MKM.Clearly borrowing has occurred again. Does it not seem more likely that Zhao,hard pressed to say something relevant about the Zhou bi, would borrow fromLiu's continuous exposition than that Liu would borrow phrases from Zhao'sfragmentary commentary?(5) Similar remarks apply to Zhao's short essay 'On the height of the sun': seeappendix 2. Liu Hui's thoughts are well motivated by his context, whereas Zhao'sstatements begin and end rather abruptly. Once again, I cannot see why Liushould be supposed to be expanding on Zhao rather than Zhao borrowing a fragmentfrom Liu, and perhaps adding a diagram in accordance with Liu's practice.If therefore we exclude the possibility of an unknown common source for Liu andZhao, it seems that the evident copying of one from the other more probably indicatesthat Zhao had read Liu rather than the reverse.184 This means that Zhao must havewritten at some time after AD 263. If we take his references to the Qian xiangcalendar as indications that he was a man of Wu, we are now in a position to date his184 It is notable that Gillon (1977), 289 felt that the heterogeneity of the material in his essay meant thatZhao was acting as an editor rather than an author."},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"162  The later history of the Zhou biwork rather precisely to the seventeen years between this date and the end of Wu inAD 280.Yu Xi, He Daoyang, Zhao FeiA few passing references to the Zhou bi enable us to trace it through the two centuriesafter Zhao Shuang. Yu Xi JJIU (AD 281-356) and He Daoyang JfHol (fl. c. AD420) both comment on the title of the book (Taiping yulan 2, 9b and 10a). In AD 437a copy of the Zhou bi in one chapter was presented to Emperor Wen 3t of the LiuSong HU^ dynasty in southern China, together with other books from the mathematicalastronomer Zhao Fei || $&L(Song shu ^ft 98, 2416). Zhao had been in the service ofthe Hunnish Northern Liang it^M dynasty, for whom he had constructed the Xuan shijlC$p astronomical system; his family was from Dunhuang Wctst (Wei shu i^U 107a,2659-60). Zhao is a very common name in Northern China, and in default of otherevidence there is no strong reason for believing that Zhao Fei may have been adescendant of Zhao Shuang.The story of Chenggong XingA story from the fifth century shows us that at that time the Zhou bi was by no meansregarded as an easy book to understand. In the reign of the Emperor Wu 3£ (AD424^152) of the Wei it dynasty which ruled in the north of China there was a famousDaoist adept by the name of Kou Qianzhi jStit^l. Kou was a friend of the courtierCui Hao ffit§, who was skilled in star-lore and mathematical astronomy (Wei shu 35,814-15, 808-9, 825-6). Kou had a hired labourer, Chenggong Xing $c^H, and oneday while Kou was sitting under a tree absorbed in calculation Chenggong came tolook at what he was doing.Kou said to him 'You're only good for muscle-work. Why are you looking at this?'Two or three days later Chenggong came to watch again, and he kept on doing so.Eventually it happened that Kou was doing calculations about the sun, moon andfive planets, and there was a problem he could not solve. He lost his temper infrustration. 'What has upset you, sir?1 asked Chenggong. Kou replied 'I have studiedmathematics for years on end. Recently I have been working through the Zhou biand I can't get things right. That's what has annoyed me. But you don't knowanything about this sort of thing, so why do you bother to ask?' Chenggong saidTry setting out the problem my way sir'. Suddenly the solution appeared; Kou wasastonished and did not know what to make of Chengong. He asked to serve him asa pupil. (Wei shu 114, 3049-50)Needless to say, Chenggong turns out to be an immortal in disguise. Whatever the"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"The Sui shu catalogue   163truth behind the story, it makes the point that even a skilled mathematician by thestandards of the age was not expected to find the Zhou bi plane sailing.The Sui shu catalogueAs we have already seen it was in the next century that Zhen Luan HLH (fl. AD 560),an official of the Northern Zhou zjbM met an obvious need by providing detailedworking for all calculations in the Zhou bi itself and in Zhao Shuang's commentary.Unfortunately Zhen does not always seem to have understood every problem himself,and his working has several mistakes.The Zhou bi was, it seems, a fairly well-known book during the period of politicaldivision from the third to seventh centuries. The names associated with it are drawnfrom the states to the north and to the south of the great barrier formed by the Yangziriver. To stand a reasonable chance of survival in a dangerous age, a book needed toachieve a wide distribution. The risks run by books limited to official collections arechillingly illustrated by the fate of the great imperial library formed by the Sui |3ffdynasty (AD 581-618) after it had successfully reunified China. In AD 622 acommissioner was sent by the newly victorious Tang Jif government to bring the Suilibrary to the capital. In an accident at the crossing of the Yellow River something likeeighty or ninety per cent of the books disappeared into the muddy waters.Even the catalogue suffered some damage; a revised version has been preservedas chapters 32-35 of the Sui shu pf It, prefaced by a short history of imperial collectionsbefore the Tang. This catalogue records three editions of the Zhou bi:(a) in one chapter, juan ^, with commentary zhu Q: by Zhao Ying J§§| [sic];(b) in one chapter, with detailed working chong shu Jt^j by Zhen Luan;(c) in one chapter, with illustrations tu H.

Li's annotations take the form of asubcommentary following the commentary of Zhao Shuang and the detailed workingof Zhen Luan. In recognition of the Zhou bi's new status as a standard text, the wordssuan jing |f M 'mathematical canon' were added to its title. The bibliographicalmonographs of both standard histories of the Tang continue to list the ont-juan versionsunder the names of Zhao Ying and Zhen Luan. However, almost certainly because ofits increased bulk, the text with Li's annotations is listed as divided into two juan asare all modern texts of the Zhou bi (Jiu Tang shu 47, 2306; Xin Tang shu ^/f jffHf 59,1543-4 and 1547).The printed textsThe Zhou bi has been relatively fortunate in the circumstances of its transmission: thetexts available to us today are still evidently more or less the same as that seen byZhao. In the case of the Jiu zhang suan shu ^J|:|J#J corruption often makes itdifficult to follow the details of Liu Hui's commentary, but such problems are rare inthe Zhou bi. All texts of the Zhou bi known today can be traced to three sources:(1) The first printed edition of the Zhou bi (together with eight other mathematicalworks) issued by the Imperial Library of the Northern Song ^ dynasty (AD960-1127) in AD 1084. After the dynasty had been driven out of the north by theJin sfe Tartars, this edition was reprinted under the Southern Song (AD 1127-1279)by Bao Huanzhi tfrlj^ieL; his postface bears a date corresponding to 14th December1213.

In the case of some early Chinese books it is at least possible thattheir commentators were in touch with some version of the tradition of thought thatproduced the book in the first place. This does not seem to have been the case withZhao Shuang and his successors. Zhao brings to the text a good understanding of theastronomy and mathematics of his own day, but when the text seems obscure or185 For fuller listings of congshu in which the Zhou bi appears, see Noda (1933), 5-7, and Qian (1963),7-9.

In the case of Zhen Luan it mustbe admitted that his contribution is simply to demonstrate how very basic were themathematical attainments of the students for whom he wrote. Zhao and Li are moresignificant sources. Apart from his running commentary, Zhao's diagrams are of interestas the earliest surviving Chinese examples of mathematical illustration, although bythe Song they were already garbled by repeated copying.Signs of revival of scholarly interest in the Zhou bi begin in the late Ming. HuZhenheng's reprint of AD 1603 was accompanied by a few short annotations under thename Tang Yin Hf H, presumably someone other than the well-known poet and painterwho lived from AD 1470 to 1524. If Tang ever found time for the austerities ofmathematical studies in his otherwise dedicatedly bohemian life, there is no otherrecord of it. It is much less unexpected to find interest in the Zhou bi by Zhu Zaiyu 7^:WM (AD 1536-1611), the Ming prince famous for his work on mathematical harmonicsand calendrical astronomy. His short treatise Yuanfang gougu tujie WJjfcJflkMfflcarries the date 1610; it discusses problems connected with the dialogue of ZhouGong and Shang Gao in section #A.186Hu Zhenheng's text of the Zhou bi was reprinted in the Jindai bishu WHI&t&Wtcollection issued between AD 1630 and about 1642 by Mao Jin ^H (AD 1599-1659),who added a short postface. Mao Jin's youngest son Mao Yi ^J§| (AD 1640 to after1710) inherited his father's library and continued his printing business.187 In AD 1684he discovered copies of several of the mathematical texts reprinted under the SouthernSong by Bao Huanzhi, and had them carefully traced. It was, however, to be twohundred and fifty years before printed copies of these were made (in the Tianlulinlang congshu, see above), and indeed it was not until AD 1800 that so much as alist of these rarities was published. Thus when Dai Zhen (AD 1724-1777) collatedmathematical texts for the Siku quanshu project in the years 1774 to 1776 he does notseem to have been aware of the Song texts of the Zhou bi and other works at firsthand, although he did have available texts of almost equivalent value from the Yongledadian.By the time that Dai Zhen worked on his edition of the Zhou bi Chinese scholarshad already begun to rediscover some of the riches of their country's ancient mathematical186 See Goodrich and Fang (1976), 367-71 for a biography of Zhu and references to studies of his work.187 Accounts of the Mao's collecting and publishing activities are given in Hummel (1943), 565-6; seealso Qian (1963), 7-8."},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"Later studies  167and astronomical literature. This was a movement begun by Mei Wending(AD 1633-1723) and carried further by his grandson Mei Juecheng $5K^ (AD1681-1763), both of whom were stimulated by contact with the novel scientific methodsbrought from Europe by Jesuit missionaries from the late Ming onwards.188 As a resultof this stimulus much that had been forgotten was recalled from oblivion. Not only didChinese scholars come to realise that their own tradition contained much that wasequal to or surpassed what had been achieved in the West; in some cases they claimedthat what the Jesuits were bringing to China was simply a development based onlearning that had travelled westwards from China in previous centuries. Whateverjustification there might indeed be for such claims, in the eighteenth century this wasmore the result of an as yet largely unbroken cultural self confidence than of objectivehistorical study. It is nevertheless interesting to see how things appeared to Dai Zhenin the case of the Zhou bi. His judgment of the book runs as follows:This work [is based on] the ancient gai tian theory. However, from the Han downto the Yuan and Ming dynasties the hurt tian theory was universally accepted. Inthe time of the Ming, Europeans entered China and began to make claims that theywere expounding new theories. However when they say that the earth is round, thisis just [what the Zhou bi] means by saying that 'the earth is like an overturned pan'[from which] 'the pouring waters run off on all sides'. When they talk about [theeffect of] differences in north-south distances, this is just [what the Zhou bi] refersto when it says that 'round the north pole, in summer there is unmelting ice' andthat 'near the middle heng there are plants that do not die in winter'. This is why thesuccession of cold and heat differ between north and south. When they talk about[the effect of] differences in east-west distances, this is just [what the Zhou bi]refers to when it says that at midday in the east it is midnight in the west, and thatat midnight in the east it is midday in the west [so that] 'the times of day and nightoccur in alternation' like the succession of the four seasons. This is why the timesof day at which the inceptions of the twelve nodal qi and conjunctions of sun andmoon occur differ between east and west. The books of the new mathematicalastronomy record that before Tycho [Brahe] the western theory was that the yearhad 365 1/4 days, so that every four years the remainder amounted to a whole day.This is just [what the Zhou bi] refers to as 'three periods of 365 days and oneperiod of 366 days'. Does not the fact that western theories have their origin in theZhou bi exemplify [the saying of Confucius that] 'when the Son of Heaven nolonger has [capable] officials, learning will be found to have been preserved amongst,the barbarian nations'?

In 1755 he wrote an essay on the problem of the term xuanji I||JJ1which occurs in section #F, while of his earlier (1752) essay on the geometry ofcircles and spheres it was said by a contemporary that it 'took the words of the openingsection of the Zhou bi as a basis, expanded on them, and followed up their fullimplications.'189 Two companions of Dai Zhen's early studies, Cheng Yaotian fM^IEH(1725-1814) and Feng Jing, MM (fl. 1750), also wrote studies of the Zhou bi.190 As inthe case of Zhu Zaiyu their interest seems to have been confined to matters connectedwith the opening dialogue of the book in section #A, then considered the ancient coreof the work. They take the opportunity afforded by the exposition of the text tointroduce their own mathematical theories at some length. Another contemporary ofDai Zhen was Wu Lang ^;jg (awarded the juren If!A degree 1751), eldest son ofthe famous novelist Wu Jingzi ^|f&^; he is said to have written a study of the Zhoubi which was printed in 1768.191Editions of the Zhou bi were published in Japan in 1785, and 1819; the second ofthese is said to include the earliest known sectional diagram of the universe accordingto the gai tian.192 This growth of Japanese interest in the Zhou bi may perhaps beconnected with the Buddhist reaction against Western astronomy around this period.193Gu Guanguang HSH!:^ (1799-1862) wrote textual notes on the Zhou bi; these arefollowed by a postface whose main purpose is to argue that it would be wrong tocondemn the Zhou bi for putting forward the false view that the earth and the heavensare basically flat rather than spherical. In Gu's opinion the purpose of the Zhou bi is todescribe a plane polar projection of the heavens rather than their actual physical form.In arriving at this somewhat anachronistic interpretation, he was apparently influencedby his reading of a treatise by Li Zhizao ^^lH (1569-?), Hungai tongxian tushuo #IlffiilBIi!&, in which Western methods of cartographic projection are outlined.194189 See Dai Zhen wenji (1963), 104-5, 124-9, 223.190 For Cheng's relations with Dai, see Dai Zhen wenji (1963), 255.

Perceptive as hiscomments often are, he keeps to the view that the opening section of the text is thebasis of the work, and that it was composed shortly after the founding of the Zhoudynasty c. 1000 BC. He rejects much of the rest of the book as the work of laterscholars who had not understood the theory properly, and suggests corrections calculatedon the basis of a spherical earth.In the present century Qian Baocong iHfS^ (1924) is an important discussion ofthe origin and date of the material assembled in the Zhou bi. It is significant that Qianreverses the traditional view put forward by Zou, and claims that the core of the bookis section #B, which contains the dialogue of Chen Zi and Rong Fang. Since Qian'sdiscussion of the date of the Zhou bi there has been no dissent from his conclusion thatmuch of the book dates from the Western Han dynasty. The critical edition of the textin Qian (1963) is, as already stated, the basis of the present study; it is preceded by avaluable essay on the Zhou biy its commentaries, and bibliographical problems.The most detailed modern study of the Zhou bi is the Shuhi sankei no kenkyuM^WM(OW[% (1933) by Noda Churyo fgfflS^. Noda's book stands in the best traditionsof Japanese sinology: detailed historical evidence is cited, while the author's scientifictraining ensures that technical matters are dealt with clearly and concisely. Much ofthe recent Chinese account of the Zhou bi in Chen Zungui WMtik (1980) 106-187appears to be drawn directly from Noda. An excellent annotated translation of theZhou bi into modern Japanese is provided by Hashimoto (1980). The Zhou bi is alsodiscussed in the general histories of Chinese mathematics by Qian (1964) 29-31,57-60, 99-100, and by Li Yan and Du Shiran (1976) 29-39, 70-76, 109. Ding andZhou (1956) 100 and 528-531 contains a valuable collection of bibliographical material.As for work in Western languages, a pioneering attack on the Zhou bi was madeby the young French sinologist Edouard Biot; his (1841) translation was the first togive Westerners access to the text. Although some of Biot's translations andinterpretations need revision, his was a very considerable achievement seen against thebackground of the resources of scholarship available to him. There is a short notice ofthe Zhou bi, with a translation of the opening section, in Wylie (1897) 163-4. Chatley(1938) is a short paper based largely on Biot (1841) and the references to the Zhou biin Maspero (1929). Chatley's discussion of the cosmography of the Zhou bi isunfortunately vitiated by an incorrect assumption about the basic form of the gai tianuniverse it describes. Discussions of the Zhou bi in the general context of the historyof Chinese mathematics and astronomy are to be found in Mikami (1913), Nakayama(1969), 24-35, Martzloff (1988), 113-14, and of course in Needham (1959), principally19-24 and 210-16."},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"170  The later history of the Zhou biIn this study I am deeply indebted to the scholarship of all who have written onthe Zhou bi and related topics before me.

One can seekout the obscure and draw out the hidden but still be unable to gain complete knowledgeof their subtleties.

THE BOOK OF SHANG GAOIntroductionThe traditional view represented in the preface of Bao Huanzhi fflaMSL dated 1213195is that this dialogue records the transmission of a corpus of knowledge from the Shangj?@ dynasty to its Zhou JW| successor. According to Bao, the whole book was puttogether about the time of the Zhou conquest. On a more sceptical view, we may saythat whoever placed this section at the head of the present Zhou bi text probablyintended that his readers should draw some such conclusion. I have suggested in anearlier discussion (page 155) that #A may in fact be a preface added to the book forpolitical reasons near the beginning of the first century AD.The Duke of Zhou is a well-known historical figure, who played an important rolein the consolidation of Zhou power after the conquest of Shang. He was regent duringthe minority of King Cheng $1 (c. 1020-1012 BC), and several chapters of the Bookof Documents Shu Jing UrM contain texts of speeches ascribed to him. By Han timeshe was reputed to have been the author of the Zhou li M^st ('Ritual of Zhou'), sometimesknown as the Zhou guan M1=i ('Offices of Zhou').196 This idealised account of theadministrative organisation of the Zhou dynasty contains several mentions of the useof the gnomon shadow for purposes related to the concerns of the Zhou bi.191 It is nottherefore surprising to find the Duke appearing to lend his prestige to the presentwork.Shang Gao, however, has never been linked with any name from the historicalrecord. According to Zhao Shuang's commentary he was 'a worthy state officer ofZhou times, skilled in mathematics', which adds nothing to what the text says orimplies. It seems slightly pointless for the writer of this section to have introduced afictitious person as the purveyor of mathematical wisdom to the Duke.1981 suggest thatit is possible that Zhao misread his text, so that he read Shang Gao MM for anoriginal Shang Rong F§J§; the error is graphically likely in the ancient 'seal script'195 Not reproduced in Qian's edition, but found in several congshu such as the Sibu beiyao |Z3 nf>f#i?, aswell as in the photographic reprint of the Southern Song edition by Wenwu Chubanshe ^^uBJiStt(1980).196 Shij733, 1522.197 See for instance Zhou li zhu shu fflffiffigfj 10, 1 lb.198 But see Graham (1989), 215-16 on the practice in ancient China of 'the multiple twist of hiding yourpseudonymous work openly under a pseudonym presumed to conceal the identity of someone who whileremaining humbly in the shadows taught some famous man the secret of his success1.

In Western Han times he was said to have been a virtuous minister of thelast Shang king, who dismissed him.199 Other late Shang worthies were Bi Gan Jti^p,who was murdered, and Ji Zi 3?-jp, who was imprisoned. After the Zhou victory thenew king honoured all three men.200 Ji Zi is said in the Book of Documents to havegiven the Zhou king instruction in such matters as divination and the theory of the fivephases.201 While Shang Rong did not enjoy the renown of Ji Zi, he was not an emptyname in Han times. A follower of the first Han emperor mentions his case as anexample of the recognition of worth,202 and a work of the second century BC describeshis efforts as a peacemaker, and his refusal to accept high office offered by the Zhouconquerors.203 A work of the third century AD preserves a tradition that he was anexpert physiognomist.204 None of this gives any direct connection with the Zhou bi,but it does show that, like Ji Zi, Shang Rong would have seemed a plausible person tohave passed on ancient wisdom to one of the founding fathers of the Zhou dynasty.In his opening question the Duke refers to Bao Xi fe^U who is more often calledFu Xi jJiWt- This is the first of the mythical Three Sovereigns San Huang £M ofremote antiquity, to whom is ascribed the origin of human culture.

May I ask how Bao Xi laid out the successive degrees of thecircumference of heaven in ancient times? Heaven cannot be scaled like a staircase,and earth cannot be measured out with a footrule. Where do the numbers come from?'#A2 [13f] Shang Gao replied 'The patterns for these numbers come from thecircle and the square. The circle comes from the square, the square comes from thetrysquare, and the trysquare comes from [the fact that] nine nines are eighty-one.'#A3 [14b] Therefore fold a trysquare so that the base is three in breadth, thealtitude is four in extension, and the diameter is five aslant. Having squared its outside,halve it [to obtain] one trysquare. Placing them round together in a ring, one can formthree, four and five. The two trysquares have a combined length of twenty-five. Thisis called the accumulation of trysquares. Thus we see that what made it possible forYu to set the realm in order was what numbers engender.'#A4 [22m] The Duke of Zhou exclaimed 'How grandly you have spoken of thenumbers! May I ask how the trysquare is used?'#A5 [22n] Shang Gao said 'The level trysquare is used to set lines true. Thesupine trysquare is used to sight on heights. The inverted trysquare is used to plumbdepths. The recumbent trysquare is used to find distances. The rotated trysquare isused to make circles, and joined trysquares are used to make squares.1#A6 [22p] The square pertains to Earth, and the circle pertains to Heaven. Heavenis a circle, and Earth is a square. The numbers of the square are basic, and the circle isproduced from the square. One may represent Heaven by a rain-hat. Heaven is blueand black; Earth is yellow and red. As for the numbers of Heaven making a rain-hat,the blue and black make the outside, and the cinnabar and yellow make the inside, soas to represent the positions of Heaven and Earth.'#A7 [23f] Thus one who knows Earth is wise, but one who knows Heaven is asage. Wisdom comes from the base [of the right-angled triangle] and the base comesfrom the trysquare. Through its relations to numbers, what the trysquare does issimply to settle and regulate everything there is.'#A8 [23j] 'Good!' said the Duke of Zhou."},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"B.

Zhao Shuang, who believed that the Zhou bi was a genuine early Zhou work,evidently felt that this section stood out from its surroundings. He says that it is 'not[part of] the original text of the Zhou bi\\ but is the work of scholars writing after thetime of the Duke of Zhou.205 But whereas Zhao wished to exclude this section fromwhat he supposed was the original text handed down by Shang Gao, I suspect thatChen Zi's book may well have been the core 'original text of the Zhou bi round whichthe rest of the material was assembled. It is, after all, the only section of the extantZhou bi to mention the term which gives the book its title. For argument on this point,see page 144.The beginning of the text is clearly defined by the introduction of the two newspeakers, as well as by changes of style and content. The end is not so unambiguouslymarked, but it is not a matter of much doubt. In the opening paragraph Rong Fangasks Chen Zi whether it is true that he can provide information on a number of points,and despite some disorder and a few lacunae in our present text it seems clear thatChen Zi is eventually persuaded to continue his explanation until practically all RongFang's queries have been answered. Table 5 may help to make this clear.The final paragraph that is clearly relevant to Chen Zi's exposition is #B34. Itconsists of what appear to be rough notes of data taken from earlier paragraphs, suchas a reader might have jotted down in the space at the end of a book. The beginning ofthe short section C marks a clear break of topic.A careful reading of this section suggests that it may be defective or disordered atvarious points. Thus for instance Rong Fang's query about the meaning of the termzhou bi and Chen Zi's answer in #B14 and #B15 seem to come too late. They evidentlybelong immediately after #B10, in which the term first occurs. If the two relevantparagraphs are moved from their present place in the sequence, #B13 and #B16 linktogether fairly well.

All these things can be attained to by mathematics.Your ability in mathematics is sufficient to understand such matters if you sincerelygive reiterated thought to them.'#B5 [24j] At this Rong Fang returned home to think, but after several days he hadbeen unable to understand, and going back to see Chen Zi he asked 'I have thoughtabout it without being able to understand. May I venture to enquire further?'#B6 [24k] Chen Zi replied 'You thought about it, but not to [the point of] maturity.This means you have not been able to grasp the method of surveying distances andrising to the heights, and so in mathematics you are unable to extend categories.206This is a case of limited knowledge and insufficient spirit. Now amongst the methods[which are included in] the Way, it is those which are concisely worded but of broadapplication which are the most illuminating of the categories of understanding. If oneasks about one category, and applies [this knowledge] to a myriad affairs, one is saidto know the Way. Now what you are studying is mathematical methods, and thisrequires the use of your understanding. Nevertheless you are in difficulty, whichshows that your understanding of the categories is [no more than] elementary. Whatmakes it difficult to understand the methods of the Way is that when one has studiedthem, one [has to] worry about lack of breadth. Having attained breadth, one [has to]worry about lack of practice. Having attained practice, one [has to] worry about lackof ability to understand. Therefore one studies similar methods in comparison witheach other, and one examines similar affairs in comparison with each other. This iswhat makes the difference between stupid and intelligent scholars, between the worthyand the unworthy. Therefore, it is the ability to distinguish categories in order to unitecategories which is the substance of how the worthy one's scholarly patrimony is pure,and of how he applies himself to the practice of understanding. When one studies thesame patrimony but cannot enter into the spirit of it, this indicates that the unworthyone lacks wisdom and is unable to apply himself to practice of the patrimony. So ifyou cannot apply yourself to the practice of mathematics, why should I confuse youwith the Way? You must just think the matter out again.'#B7 [25k] Rong Fang went home again and considered the matter, but afterseveral days he had been unable to understand, and going back to Chen Zi he asked 'Ihave exerted my powers to the utmost, but my understanding does not go far enough,206 That is, think analogically about problem solutions."},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"178  Zhou bi suan jing: translationand my spirit is not adequate.

THE SEVEN HENGIntroductionThe main body of this section is a series of calculations repeated more or less identicallyfor eight imaginary celestial circles centred on the pole. The first seven of these circlesare the seven equally spaced heng, which represent the daily orbits of the sun roundthe celestial pole at the dates of the twelve 'medial qi M zhong qi ^M- These are theodd-numbered qi in the sequence of 24 equally spaced qi which divide up the solarcycle from one winter solstice to the next. The word heng Hf has a range of meaningsincluding 'cross-wise, level'; why it should be used to refer to the solar orbits givenhere is unclear. Perhaps the reference is to the different levels of the noon sun in thesky at different seasons? The sun's seasonal positions among the heng may be shownas in table 4:Table 4.

For each ofthe circles the text gives its diameter, its circumference, and the length of one du J^on this circumference. Paragraphs #D4 to #D7 introduce the heng system and explainhow the diameter of each heng may be obtained. The result for the spacing of the henggiven in #D7 presupposes knowledge of the total distance between the first and seventhheng, a quantity which is not in fact calculated until #D18. I am therefore inclined tomove #D18 to between #D6 and #D7, perhaps following it by #D20. Paragraph #D19seems to be a later note repeating the material of #D15; as in #B32 it appears that the'four poles' at the edges of the cosmos lie at the limit of solar illumination. Thearithmetical explanation of #D20 seems to be a later addition to the text, whichotherwise assumes that its readers know how to perform the computations required.At the beginning of this section the first two paragraphs are clearly linked to adiagram of the seven heng. Following the indication in Zhao's preface, the first hypothesiswould be that all such diagrams (and hence any explanation of them) must be byZhao. The situation is however complex. In the first place, as elsewhere, the diagramin all extant editions has clearly been corrupted by an ignorant copyist, since it is quiteinconsistent with Zhao's detailed explanation following #D1 (see appendix 3 fortranslation and discussion). Secondly, in what is now the main text of #D2 we are toldof an original large-scale diagram having been halved in size for convenience ofrepresentation. The status of this paragraph as part of the main text is apparentlyconfirmed by the fact that it bears a brief comment, presumably by Zhao. It seems,therefore, that we must assume that the text found by Zhao already had a diagram ofthe heng in it. Whether or not he revised this diagram when he copied the text wecannot tell. As we shall see below (section #H) Zhao was prepared to make improvementswhere he considered them justified.The quotation from the Lu shi chun qiu B.R#f^211 in paragraph #D3 also bearsZhao's commentary, confirming that it was part of the text he saw. He states, however,that it is 'not part of the original Zhou bi text'. Although it relates to the general topicof cosmic dimensions, its lack of close connection with its context suggests that it mayindeed be an intruded note. Whatever the truth may be, the quotation gives us somerather weak dating evidence: somebody worked on this section, at least to the extentof scribbling a note on it, at some time between the completion of the Lu shi chun qiuin 239 BC and whenever it was that Zhao saw the text.13, 3a in Sibu congkan IZHgftilf IJ edn."},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"D.

THE SHAPES OF HEAVEN AND EARTH; DAY AND NIGHTIntroductionIt is at this point that the Tang dynasty editors divided the text into two chapters. Thisbreak serves to fix the beginning of the present section, and hence also confirms theend-point of section #D. The beginning of section #F is clearly enough defined, butthe intervening material seems badly jumbled. Two main topics can be disentangled.The first of these brings out a conclusion implicit in earlier discussions of thesun's daily orbit round the pole. The universe of the Zhou bi has no privileged observers:one observers's noon is midnight for his counterpart on the other side of the pole, andvice versa. Paragraphs #E4 and #E5 develop this point, and seem to be in their propersequence.The second topic relates to the shapes of heaven and earth, which are discussedbriefly in #E2, #E6 and #E7, here separated by other material. The only other materialon this topic is the reference in #A6 to heaven resembling a rain-hat. Nothing was saidthere about earth.Paragraph #E8 seems unconnected with the rest of the section, and has someaffinity with the material in section #J. The reference to the 'four poles' links #E1 withthe mention of the outermost limit of daylight in #E3. Both may well belong in thepreceding section.Text#E1 [53b] The rotation of the sun and moon around the way of the four poles:#E2 [53b] As for the subpolar point, it is 60 000 // higher than where humanbeings live, and the pouring waters run down on all sides. Likewise the centre ofheaven is 60 000 // higher than its edges."},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"F. The xuan ji; polar and tropical conditions 189#E3 [53d] Therefore the diameter of the outward extent of the sun's rays is810 000 //, and its circumference is 2 430 000 II#E4 [53e] Therefore when the sun's rotation has brought it to a position north ofthe pole, it is noon in the northern region and midnight in the southern region. Whenthe sun is east of the pole, it is noon in the eastern region and midnight in the westernregion. When the sun is south of the pole, it is noon in the southern region andmidnight in the northern region. When the sun is west of the pole, it is noon in thewestern region and midnight in the eastern region.#E5 [53g] Now in [each of] these four regions heaven and earth have their fourpoles and their four harmonies. The times of day and night occur in alternation. So inthe limits reached by Yin and Yang, and the extremes reached by winter and summer,they are as one.#E6 [54a] Heaven resembles a covering rain-hat, while earth is patterned on aninverted pan.#E7 [54b] Heaven is 80 000 li from earth. Even though the winter solstice sun ison the outer heng, it is still 20 000 li above the land below the pole.#E8 [54d] Therefore the sun arouses the moon [reading Wd for ^fc], whereupon themoonlight shines forth. The bright moon is formed, and the constellations move inorder. Therefore from the autumn equinox up to the winter solstice the essence of thethree luminaries weakens, since [the sun's path] is growing more distant. This is thenatural working of heaven and earth, and of the Yin and Yang.F. THE XUANJI; POLAR AND TROPICAL CONDITIONSIntroductionThis section is principally concerned with an idealised account of gnomon observationsof a certain bright circumpolar star, the xuan ji J#31, whose 'four excursions' aredescribed in #F1. At the end of #F5, it is made clear that the discussion has in effectbeen completed. Nevertheless, there are good grounds for regarding what follows aspart of the same section. The diameter of the circle traced by this star round the polehas been given in #F2; #F6 goes one step further by calculating the circumference,and its last sentence is taken up by #F8, which is clearly linked by topic with #F9. Itherefore feel that these three paragraphs cannot easily be separated from the material"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"190  Zhou bi suan jing: translationpreceding them, despite the apparent difference of topic. Paragraph #F7 has nothing todo with the present section, and seems to belong in #G: #G2 seems to be a truncatedversion of this paragraph.Consideration of the role played by the xuanji in the Zhou bi makes it clear why asection on this subject might well contain material of the sort found in the paragraphson polar and tropical climate. It will be recalled that the definition of this 11 500//-radius circle is a recognition of the anomaly created in section #B, where the167 000 li range given for the sun's rays fell 11 500 li short of the range needed for thesubpolar point to be illuminated at the equinoxes, as Chen Zi claimed it would be.This section not only makes the discrepancy seem less arbitrary by linking it with theorbit of an important star, but also seems to be attempting to preserve the truth ofChen Zi's claims about six month day and night at the pole. Paragraph #F6 defines thexuan ji circle as the borderline between Yang and Yin. Comparing similar phrases inChen Zi's references to daylight just reaching the pole at the equinoxes, it seems thatin effect the xuanji circle is being defined as the border of a circumpolar region. Thuswhen Chen Zi says that the sun's rays reach the pole at the equinoxes, his statementremains true so long as the sun's rays reach as far as the xuanji circle. In this context itis not surprising that a section commencing with a discussion of the xuan ji should goon to discuss the polar climate as in #F8. Tropical conditions, mentioned in #F9, arean obvious comparison.This is thus apparently the first section of the Zhou bi to show signs of criticalreconsideration of material occurring earlier in the present text. The tactic of redefiningthe pole as everything within the xuan ji circle seems to lie behind some of thecalculations in section #G, which may well be by the same hand.The xuan ji 'star' is in fact an object whose links with observable reality are thinenough to justify applying to it the description 'fictitious'. As already explained, itsdistance from the pole is simply that required to resolve Chen Zi's polar problem. Itsposition relative to the sun at the solstices is that required by the false calculation ofnorth polar distances in section #G. Further, even if there had been a celestial body inthe correct position, the fact that the solar cycle is not a whole number of days willmean that the neat pattern of positions specified in #F1 will not in fact be seen. Fordetailed discussion see page 124ff.Text#F1 [54j] If you want to know the pivot of the north pole, and the four extremesof the xuanji, you may always take it that:the time of summer solstice midnight is when the southern excursion of the northpole [star] reaches its maximum;"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"F.

The results obtained are consistentwith the calculations for the seven heng given in section #D.In fact, as Zhao states explicitly, this shadow table is not part of the Zhou bi textseen by him. As he says, he was dissatisfied with the fact that the earlier table gavedifferent shadow values for the spring and autumn equinoxes, and hence he set out toprovide an improved version. Fortunately his description of the defects of the old tableenable us to reconstruct it: see appendix 4. While the solstitial shadow values of theoriginal table are certainly those associated with the Zhou bi, the failure to make theequinoctial shadow values equal make it difficult to see how this older documentcould be reconciled with the quantitative cosmography of the Zhou bi as representedin sections #B and #D.Text#H1 [63n] For the 24 qi M^ of the 8 jie fjj, the decrease or increase [of theshadow] for one qi is 9 cun 9 fen and 1/6 fen. The length of the winter solstice shadowis 1 zhang 3 chi 5 cun, and the length of the summer solstice shadow is 1 chi 6 cun.

LUNAR LAGIntroductionThis section shows no signs of corruption, and clearly stands by itself.

Rising, setting and seasons  201J. RISING, SETTING AND SEASONSIntroductionThis section has little evident relevance to others in the Zhou bi, and the reasons for itsinclusion are at first sight unclear. In the first two paragraphs the sun's rising andsetting at the solstices are referred to the twelve-fold azimuthal division of the horizonlabelled by the cyclical characters of the di zhi ifi;£'earthly branches'. In #J4 and #J5rising and setting are referred to a parallel eightfold division of the horizon labelled bythe ba gua A$h eight trigrams. The two systems are shown in figure 15. From theway in which the seasonal risings and settings are said to be related to the trigrams, itis clear that they have been arranged in the so-called 'King Wen ^tf order. The datagiven for each system are approximately true for latitudes near 35 degrees north,which is the region in which the solstitial shadows of the Zhou bi appear to have beenmeasured. The material is gnomic rather than expository, and perhaps therefore isbound to seem rather fragmentary. There does not seem to be any obvious way ofre-arranging the paragraphs to read more smoothly.The data given here cannot be related closely to the observational or computationalprocedures given in the rest of the work. On the other hand, we have already seen oneinstance in #G7 where the graduations borne by the shi ^ cosmic model were clearlypresent in the consciousness of a mainstream Zhou bi theorist. Since the earth-plate ofthe shi bears both the twelve stems and the eight trigrams, it may be that the role ofthe shi as a physical representation of the gai tian cosmography may be the missinglink between this section and the rest of the book. Zhao points out the resemblancebetween #J7 and a passage from the Book of Change, an appropriate quotation if thepicture of a divination aid is in the author's mind.Text#J1 [73j] At the winter solstice the day is at its shortest.

CALENDRICAL CYCLESIntroductionIn this final section we return to calendrical topics with a discussion of the basicconstants of astronomical systems of the quarter-remainder type. Apart from the factthat #K6 is almost certainly a fragment of intruded comment, it is possible to read thesection as it stands without much sense of confusion.After a brief definition of the month, the day and the year as the basic cycles ofthe calendar, and a reference to the sequence of qi H, (#K1 to #K3), the text namesfive longer period cycles (#K4). The first four are well-known in the context of thequarter-remainder system type, and serve computational convenience in different ways.The fifth cycle is however based on a multiple of seven, a number which has no placein the structure of traditional Chinese time reckoning. To my knowledge a cycle ofthis kind has no parallels elsewhere. An inevitable speculation is that the factor ofseven may indicate some awareness of the existence of the seven-day week. Forfurther discussion see page 25.Paragraph #K5 asks the five questions set out in table 5, whose answers take upthe rest of the section.Table 5.

This is found between paragraphs#A3 and #A4 in all editions: see p. 18 in Qian's edition. His essay is followed bycomments by Zhen Luan, who attempts to illustrate Zhao's statements by using the"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"Appendix 1   207example base 3, altitude 4 and hypotenuse 5. Zhen's comments are in turn the subjectof comment by Li Chunfeng, who corrects him at several points.In all traditional editions this essay is prefaced by the three diagrams shown infigure 16: hypotenuse, right and left. It is clear, however, that the second and third ofthese do not relate at all to Zhao's essay, except perhaps as desperate but mistakenattempts to penetrate its meaning. After having studied Zhao's essay in detail, I think itis clear that the two explicit mentions of a 'diagram' in his text both refer to the first ofthese, the 'hypotenuse diagram' xian tu ^H (figure 17). This is equivalent to the finaldiagram restored by Qian, and includes the first of Qian's diagrams within itself. The'right' and 'left' diagrams look like an effort to supply illustrations to cover the casesillustrated by me in figures 23 and 19, by someone who could see that a 3-side and4-side square had to be somehow got inside the 5-side square, but did not realise whatZhao meant by the expression 'trysquare'. It might then seem natural to place theseinner squares at an angle relative to the immediately circumscribing 5-side square, justas that square was rotated relative to its circumscribing 7-side square. It is possiblethat Zhen Luan supplied these diagrams himself. The insertion (if that is the rightexplanation) seems to have happened by the time of Zhen Luan in the sixth century,since he refers to the diagrams in his commentary. Thus we find Zhen using thefollowing expressions:18s: 'the central yellow area on the left diagram'. Why Zhen should refer to theleft diagram when Zhao has just directed attention to the hypotenuse diagram is amystery. Furthermore, Zhen misrecites Zhao's 'the difference of base and altitude' afew characters earlier as 'the difference of base and hypotenuse' with disastrous results.Perhaps the text seen by Zhen had no hypotenuse diagram, so that he did not understandwhat was meant? And perhaps the text he saw was indeed corrupted, but Li Chunfengused a better version (which also had the hypotenuse diagram) in preparing the textwhich we now see, while copying in Zhen's comments uncorrected?19j: 'the outer green [area] on the left diagram'. While the area is 25 - 16 = 9 asrequired, the trysquare shape is completely lost.19j 'the central yellow [area] of 16 on the left diagram'. The area and shape arecorrect, but the square is misplaced.20b 'Take double the altitude of 4, one gets 8; make this the congfa #££fe on bothsides of the diagram, and open the corner 9 of the trysquare base, getting 1'. Zhen doesnot specify which diagram he is talking about, but he is clearly doing no more thanshuffling numbers since he does not understand the situation Zhao is discussing - seefigure 20 below.21f-21m: Although Zhen speaks here as if he understood the hypotenuse diagram,he may simply be following Zhao's text, which is explicit and clear enough for him todo this."},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"208   Appendix 122a-221: Zhen clearly does not visualise the situation described by Zhao: seefigure 28. He is corrected by Li ChunfengThis essay by Zhao was the subject of a detailed and ingenious study by BrendanS. Gillon, in which independently of Qian he discussed the problem of restoring thecorrupted diagrams, partly on the basis of Liu Hui's commentary to the Jiu zhang suanshu (AD 263).223 With the benefit of hindsight, I suspect that some of Zhao's essaymay be rather simpler than Gillon's rendering may suggest, and I have tried to reflectthat in my translation. In what follows I limit myself as far as possible to a straightforwardrendering of Zhao's text, which is not too difficult to comprehend so long as one islooking at the right diagram. I have therefore supplied these with explanatory captions.224So far as we can tell, Zhao expected his readers to be able to do this for themselves,apart from the case of the 'hypotenuse diagram' which he mentions explicitly.TextDiagrams of base and altitude, circle and square225The base and altitude are each multiplied by themselves. Add to make the hypotenusearea. Divide this to open the square,226 and this is the hypotenuse.In accordance with the hypotenuse diagram [figure 17], you may further multiplythe base and altitude together to make two of the red areas. Double this to make fourof the red areas. Multiply the difference of the base and the altitude by itself to makethe central yellow area. If one [such] difference area is added [to the four red areas],the hypotenuse area is completed.223 Gillon (1977), 253-93.224 It seems to me important to avoid algebraic manipulation in explaining the processes referred to byZhao, except perhaps where it is simpler to write (a + b) rather than 'the sum of a and b\\ Zhao had noalgebra, and so far as the content of this essay goes seems to have understood his mathematics solely interms of operations involving geometric magnitudes.225 As Zhao makes clear in his commentary to #A2, the reason that circle and square are mentioned hereis that the perimeter of a circle of unit diameter is taken as three, while the perimeter of a unit sidedsquare is four. Three and four are of course the lengths of base and altitude considered in #A. Thisanswers the problem raised in Gillon (1977), 289.226 This is the full Chinese expression for root extraction, which was accomplished by a process similarto division: see Martzloff (1988), 210ff.

Qian notes (p. 19 collation note 2) that extant texts have 'square' and'trysquare1 in the reverse order, which does not accord well with Zhao's later statements, represented infigs. 19 and 23, in which the squares are said to btfang qi li ^f3tffl 'squaring the inside' of the relevanttrysquare. Zhao is simply explaining the general principle behind much of his subsequent discussion.229 The word used here is gui |fe, with a number of senses connected with deception or peculiarity. HereI follow the sense of a similar passage in Liu Hui's commentary to the fifth problem of chapter 9 of theJiu zhang suan shu, which has the more comprehensible e fffc 'change, transform' both here and in ZhenLuan's recital of this passage in his commentary.

After this paragraph Zhao Shuang inserts a short essay on the use of thegnomon to determine the sun's position. This is found between #B11 and #B12: see p.34 in Qian's edition. Zhao' discussion refers explicitly to a diagram, which someeditions have preserved although in garbled form: see the restored version of figure29. Zhao's text runs as follows:"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"Appendix 2   219The areas [marked with] a yellow jia Ep and with a yellow yi ZJ are exactly equal.The area [marked with] a yellow jia is made by multiplying the height of a gnomonby the distance between them. If you count one for each time [you subtract] theshadow difference [i.e. divide by the shadow difference], which is the breadth ofthe [area marked with] a yellow yi, what you obtain is transformed into the lengthof the [area marked with] a yellow yi, which goes up level with the sun. Referringto the diagram, [it is evident that] you must add the height of the gnomon.

There is however no need for assuming any elaborate mathematics behindZhao's claims. Consider for instance his claim that the yellow jia area must equal theyellow yi area. For the first, we have:area = (distance between gnomons, D) x (height of gnomon, h).While for the second we have:area = (difference in shadows, d) x (height of sun, H).Now in #B 11 Chen Zi has just made it clear that a measurement at the gnomoncan be transformed into the related large-scale measurement by changing each cun to1000 //. The two first quantities on the right hand sides are related in this way, as arethe two second quantities, but inversely. The products must therefore be the same.Zhao gives us little help in deciding what areas he marked with the blue charactersbing H and ji 2. Those shown here do however seem plausible candidates, and theyobey the relations given by Zhao, in a similar fashion to the yellow areas.Once again it is clear that a Chinese mathematician of this era did not think interms identical to our own. Whereas we would automatically use similar triangles insuch a situation, Zhao reaches an equivalent result by different means. This shortessay is paralleled by a suggestion by Liu Hui in his preface to the Jiu zhang suan zhu,possibly composed close to the time that Zhao wrote. Apparently dissatisfied withcalculations based on the old shadow rule, he proposed to use the chongcha MS:'repeated difference' and gougu £j)3£ 'base and altitude' methods to attack the problemafresh:"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"220   Appendix 2Set up two gnomons at the city of Yangcheng |i§i$c.234 Let them be eight chi tall,and to north and south let the ground be quite level.

Then the lengthof the tube gives the proportion for the altitude, and the diameter gives the proportionfor the base. Now the amount of the sun's distance from the observer is the 'greataltitude' and the base corresponding to it [in proportion as established] is thediameter of the sun.Liu's work is not identical to Zhao's, but the correspondence is quite close. Thereference to the sighting tube is a clear parallel with paragraph #B 11 of the Zhou biitself. There is no doubt that contact of some kind has occurred, even if we cannot besure of its precise means or nature. Other evidence suggests that the more likelypossibility is that Zhao is drawing on Liu rather than the other way around: see page160f.234 In Henan: this was the traditional site for gnomon observations."},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"Appendix ThreeZhao Shuang and the diagram of theseven hengFigure 30.

Whatever the case may be, the traditionaldiagrams are corrupt: see figure 30. Zhao's essay reads as follows:The line drawn in green is the boundary where heaven and earth [apparently] join,the furthest extent of human vision.

Everyone calls the place where the sunrises 'east', where the sun is centred 'south', where the sun goes in 'west' and wherethe sun is absent 'north'.Beneath the north pole, the sun is in sight for six months, and out of sightfor six months. For the six months from the spring to the autumn equinox the sunis always in sight, while for the six months from the autumn to the spring equinoxesthe sun is always out of sight. When the sun is in sight it is day, and when the sunis out of sight it is night.

At the winter solstice it turns from south to north; at thesummer solstice it turns from north to south; when it reaches the end it begins onceagain.All this is quite clear, and on the basis of the text Zhao's diagram may easily berestored as in figure 31. The system of the heng is as described in section #D. Wehave already heard of the limited range of human vision in paragraph #B25, and thesix-month polar day and night are discussed in #B22 to #B24, as well as being impliedin #F9. While the Yellow Road is not mentioned explicitly in the main text, itsrecognition as the basic path of the moving heavenly bodies against the background ofthe stars is implied in #B20 and #B21. In any case it was a well-known astronomicalconcept by the time Zhao wrote, even if the universe of the Zhou hi cannot represent itas a great circle.Zhao's original contribution is his concept of a fixed 'window' underneath whichthe disk of heaven could be rotated in order to show how the sun and other heavenlybodies enter and leave the observer's field of vision. Although this seems to haveremained at the level of imagination, the resemblance to a modern planispheric star-finderis interesting. We have already heard of what sounds like a similar device possiblymade by Yang Xiong:(page 59), which he destroyed on giving up his belief in the gaitian (page 60). In his memorial of AD 92 Jia Kui reports some of his colleagues asstating that 'The star maps [in use today] are \"laid out with compasses\" guifa £|£fe\\which sounds rather like Zhao's diagram. The Sui shu devotes a special section entitledGai tu HIB 'the chariot-cover diagram' to discoid star maps as opposed to those on thesurface of a sphere, and it seems they were an established tradition despite the fact thatit was known their quantitative predictions had to be treated with care: see Sui shu 19,520."},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"Appendix FourThe old shadow tableParagraph #H2 of the present text of the Zhou bi lists noon shadows of an eight-c/ugnomon for each of the 24 'solar seasons' qi Mi- The values given correspond preciselyto those underlying the dimensions given earlier (section #D) for the seven hengcircles on which the sun is positioned at the instants of inception of alternate qi, thelink being the 'one cun for a thousand U shadow principle.It appears, however, that the shadow list seen today is not the one originally seenby Zhao Shuang in the third century AD, but is a new construction by Zhao himself,with added explanatory material in paragraphs #H1, #H3 and #H4. Thus in a commenton #H3, he remarks 'This is Shuang's new method'; he is evidently writing a commentaryon a text he has at the least revised himself (Qian edn, 65n). In his final comment on#H4 (Qian edn, 66c ff.) Zhao explains his rejection of the old shadow table in detail:The method by which the old shadows were obtained was not in accordance withprinciple. [Elsewhere in the Zhou bi] it is said that at the equinoxes the Yin andYang shadows are equal, each being 7 chi 5 cun 5 fen, so that the middle heng is75 500 // from Zhou. Here however the spring equinox shadow is 7 chi 5 cun 723fen, and the autumn equinox shadow is 7 chi 4 cun 262 fen, so that there is adiscrepancy of 1 cun 461 fen.235 Based on this, [the distances of the sun from Zhou]are not equal.[According to the old text] from Winter Solstice [qi #1] to Little Cold [qi#2] [the change] is greater by half a days' shadow; from Summer Solstice [qi #13]to Little Heat [qi #14] [the change] is less by half a day's shadow; from Grain inEar [qi #12] to Summer Solstice is greater by two days' shadow; from Great Snow[qi #24] to Winter Solstice is greater by three day's shadowFurther, half a year is 182 5/8 days, but here [the fraction] is given thevalue 2/4, so that for one day there is obtained 476/730 cun of shadow, which isincorrect. The length of a qi is not exactly fifteen days, but has a fraction of 7/32day. If one simply multiplies the daily rate to give [the amount] for a qi, the errorwill be great indeed. The Book of Change says 'An old well has no birds [drinking?]:timely abandonment1, meaning that it is time to abandon the use of thirty days [as235 As we shall shortly see, these fen are not the usual 1/100 chi, but are units of 1/730 cun. The shadowtable reconstructed in accordance with Zhao's description actually has a spring equinox value of 7 chi 5cun 722 fen. Since Zhao has calculated the difference between his figures accurately, it seems he mayhave simply miscopied the spring value."},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"Appendix 4   225the length of two qi\\. Thus I have made this new method, based on the [true] valueof a qi, so that its description is simple and its principle is easy, so that high andlow are inter-related, and everything moves through a cycle and returns to itsoriginal state without discrepancy.Fortunately there is just enough detail in Zhao's critique to enable us to reconstruct theoriginal Zhou bi shadow table which he had deleted in favour of his own creation. Inthe first place, a half year of 182 2/4 days implies a year of exactly 365 days. Also,using the Zhou bVs usual values for the solstitial shadows, the daily change of shadowlength (assumed constant) becomes:S = (13.5 - 1.6)cM(182.5 days)= (119 a*n)/(182.5 days)= (476 cun)/(130 days).This is the value given by Zhao. If, as he notes, the length of a qi is taken asexactly 15 days, then the length of the half-year between solstices becomes12 x 15 days = 180 days.Thus if we begin from one solstice and add or subtract as appropriate at the rate of15 x 476/730 cun for each qi, the value after twelve qi have elapsed will differ fromthe subsequent solstitial value by 2.5 days' worth of shadow, or 2.5 x 476/730 cun.The old text of the Zhou bi evidently dealt with this by what seems to have been anarbitrary allocation of less or more shadow-change to the qi periods on either side ofthe moments of solstice.236 For the half-year winter solstice to summer solstice wehave an extra half-day's worth for the first qi period and an extra two days' worth forperiod #12; for the next half-year there is half a day's worth less for period #13 andthree days' worth more for period #24. In either case, the missing 2.5 days' worth ofshadow is made up, and the cycle is completed. On this basis we may reconstruct theoriginal shadow table of the Zhou bi as set out in table 6. Shadows are given in unitsof chi, cun and cun/730, separated by points in the table.236 It naturally occurs to one to total up the number of days'-worth of shadow for each season. This yieldsspring 92, summer 89.5, autumn 93, winter 90.5. Clearly this has nothing to do with any discovery of theinequality of the seasons, in which case one would have expected figures closer to 94, 92, 89, 90 (Dicks(1970), 24). The pattern here is quite wrong, and in any case the irregularities are squeezed into six qinear the solstices rather than attributed to the seasons as a whole. There is no sign that the qi were thoughtof as different lengths, as opposed to having unequal amounts of shadow-change within them."},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"226qi123456789101112131415161718192021222324Table 6.Shadow13.5.012.4.65211.5.8210.5.2429.5.4028.5.5627.5.7226.6.1525.6.3124.6.4723.6.6322.7.621.6.02.5.3323.5.1724.5.125.4.5826.4.4227.4.2628.4.1029.3.67210.3.51211.3.35212.3.192Appendix 4The old shadow table restoredDays'-worth15.5151515151515151515151714.51515151515151515151518Resultant change0.10.780.9.5700.9.5700.9.5700.9.5700.9.5700.9.5700.9.5700.9.5700.9.5700.9.5700.11.620.9.3320.9.5700.9.5700.9.5700.9.5700.9.5700.9.5700.9.5700.9.5700.9.5700.9.5700.11.538As I have already mentioned, Zhao's new shadow table is in accordance with therest of the Zhou hi.
