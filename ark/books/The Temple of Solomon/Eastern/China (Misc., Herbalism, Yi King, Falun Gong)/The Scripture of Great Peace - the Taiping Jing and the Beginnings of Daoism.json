There is nothing quite like them inother texts from ancient and early medieval China. The text proclaims that thetraditional gap between the status of men and of women and also between leadersand followers must be narrowed. It also questions the reliability of scholarlytraditions of reasoning and demands that the belief in heaven’s life-givingpower be the sole principle of human action. It invites every concernedindividual to enter into an ongoing dialogue with everyone else. Humankind,faced with the possibility of an imminent and violent end to the world broughtabout by the crimes that men have committed throughout history, is called uponto jointly mobilize its resources. There is therefore no doubt that this texthas a lot to say, but it is not easy to access its message. Recent Chineseeditions and Chinese-language translations of the text, however, have eliminatedsome of the problems inherent in accessing its message, and this translation isdeeply indebted to them.My involvement with the Scripture on Great Peace has been of some duration, andthanks are due to many colleagues and friends, and in particular to everyone inDaoist studies. From my perspective, Daologists across the world have shownthemselves to be true followers of the dao, open, cooperative, and happy toshare information and invite others to venture into their field. Special thanksare due to Christoph Harbsmeier for initiating this translation project. Thelibrarians at the University of Sydney’s Fisher Library and at the University ofNew South Wales have helped me access resources. Jon Kowallis and Lance Eccleshave critically looked at passages of my work. Sue Wiles and Mary Severance havehelped to improve its readability. Florian Reiter has been a source ofencouragement, and Hans Hendrischke has provided generous organizationalsupport. The comments of Gil Raz and the University of California Press’sanonymous reader have been instructive and inspiring. Stephen Bokenkamp haspatiently and with great wisdom made this publication possible."},{"pageContent":"CONVENTIONSThis translation of the Taiping jing follows the wording of the second editionof Wang Ming’s text, published in Beijing in 1979. His emendations of theoriginal text found in the Daoist canon are followed unless otherwise specified;his punctuation is occasionally replaced by that used in more recent editions.References to the text are by section and page number. Since Wang Ming’s editionis divided into chapters this might at first sight be confusing; however, thissystem is meant to help organize the text into meaningful units. The receivedtext is divided into chapters (juan), and each chapter is subdivided intoseveral sections. Each section typically deals with a single topic, and thesections assembled in one chapter often have little in common. For this reasonthe chapter number is irrelevant for understanding and interpreting thescripture and is therefore ignored when quoting passages from the text.In addition to section and page number, references to the text point to thelayer to which a passage belongs (for more on this, see the Appendix). When nolayer is mentioned the material is from layer A, that is, from those parts ofthe text where a Celestial Master talks to his disciples. When the passagereferred to is not from the Taiping jing proper but from its Tang dynastydigest, the Taiping jing chao, this is so indicated: the word Chao is added tothe reference, as is the respective part of the nine parts of the Chao that havebeen transmitted. There is a purpose to this rather cumbersome andspace-consuming method of referring to the text. By the standards of ancient andearly medieval texts the Taiping jing is a long scripture, and yet I haveobserved that its internal logic is remarkable. To locate all the passagesreferred to in their own environment might allow readers to share thisobservation and help them appreciate the text’s coherence and argumentativeinsistence."},{"pageContent":"INTRODUCTIONThe Taiping jing 太平經, or Scripture on Great Peace (hereafter TPJ), is anoutsider with respect to China’s tradition of great books. It differs in contentand style from the texts that helped to create, nourish, and sustain thecountry’s central institutions and thereby became part of them. It was not untilthe twentieth century, when scholars began to articulate their skepticism aboutthese institutions and search for alternative traditions, that the TPJ gainedbroader scholarly attention.When Werner Eichhorn took an interest in the TPJ in the 1940s and 1950s heapproached it with the suspicion that he would find something akin to an earlyChinese version of the Communist Manifesto in terms of its dynamic impact andits call to the exploited masses of the Chinese peasantry to discard theirchains.1 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn1] Eichhorn soon realized, however, that this wasnot quite the case. Instead, the TPJ’s authors warned people not to ignoreexisting hierarchies and admonished subordinates to obey and support theirleaders in an orderly fashion. Nevertheless, Eichhorn remained interested in thescripture. Contrary to earlier voices, both Chinese and Western, he insistedthat the authors of the TPJ were serious in their attempt to reform society,improve the lot of women, and strengthen people’s belief in heaven. Theirmessage, he argued, was coherent and of historical relevance. At the end of theHan dynasty the authors of the TPJ attempted to restore to the fading dynastythe harmony, order, and happiness of its first decades, now a memory some threecenturies old.When the Communist Party came to power in China in 1949, the TPJ received moreattention from scholars and intellectuals than it had since its firstpublication in the sixth century C.E. Scholars like Hou Wailu and Yang Kuan aswell as the wider public read the text as if it were the foundation for thatalternative tradition of peasant culture, peasant uprisings, and critical,materialist thought that China’s Communist intellectuals saw as their own.2[Notes.xhtml#intro1fn2] The TPJ was hailed as the voice of the landless who inthe second century C.E. had drifted through the Chinese countryside in search ofa livelihood. We know that these people confronted landowners and governmentrepresentatives not just by voicing slogans and reform proposals, but with arms,and before long their opposition led to the downfall of the ruling dynasty.China’s twentieth-century Communist scholars and intellectuals placed the TPJ inthe midst of all this. The drastic formulations of the peasants’ misery struckCommunist readers as a depiction of a prerevolutionary era: the people wereimpoverished and starving, left without protection against illness, or perishedin prisons without cause. In their destitution they rid themselves of their babygirls in order to save the expense of raising them, or they abandoned all familyties and refrained from marrying. Many died young and without offspring. Peopledid not even have the means to properly bury their dead. The authors of the TPJcalled the wealthy and powerful to task for all this, and they accused therulers of shirking their responsibility for the people’s welfare.The main interest of Chinese Communist scholars was the TPJ’s message. Theirattempts to investigate the text’s composition and authorship were curtailed bythe ideological desire to uphold its status as an authoritative formulation ofearly revolutionary sentiment. Free from such constraints, Japanese scholars, onthe other hand, tackled the text’s origin and history in earnest. Ōfuchi Ninji,Yoshioka Yoshitoyo, and others came to conclusions about the writing, editing,and publishing of the text that have been widely accepted.3[Notes.xhtml#intro1fn3] Their work integrated the history of the TPJ in thebroader context of the cultural and intellectual development of medieval China,in which religious practices and ideas played an increasingly important role.They stressed that medieval Daoism contained a powerful message of salvation.For historical as well as doctrinal reasons, the TPJ was central to thismessage.In reconstructing the history of the text, Ōfuchi, Yoshioka, and others peruseda wide range of medieval China’s Daoist material, dating from the second to theeighth century. Max Kaltenmark’s focus was narrower.4 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn4] Hefirmly situated the scripture at the onset of Daoist religious thought. In hisinterpretation, the TPJ authors introduced their readers to the basics of aDaoist way of life, combining political ideas with elements of personallifestyle. Men were told that in their personal lives they must concentratetheir vital essence in order to remain in good health and live a long life, andin particular they must practice meditation in order to increase their energyand achieve their goals. They must also follow general rules of good behaviorand be prepared to be held responsible for their earthly deeds after death. On acommunal level, believers were advised to create institutions that would allowthem to cooperate with and care for one another and to protect the environmentin which they lived. People were expected to share whatever material goods,knowledge, or skills they possessed so that general harmony and happiness wouldprevail.The TPJ is rich enough to support each of these interpretations. Historically,it throws light on the Chinese worldview during the period of late antiquity.During this era the unified empire that went back to the First Emperor of theQin and the founders of the Han dynasty who succeeded him had lasted for severalcenturies and was on the verge of breaking up. During the first and secondcenturies C.E. new economic forces had emerged, established hierarchies haddissolved, and the empire’s governance was rapidly deteriorating. This createdsocial and economic hardships that in turn raised new concerns and fears notaddressed by the prevailing philosophical and political ideas that had helped tomaintain and stabilize the empire and its organs. A process of intellectualreorientation that involved academic institutions and their prominentrepresentatives as well as the wider public thus came into play. A rapid growthof religious interest, which encompassed all social strata, is testimony tothis. It may well be said that the TPJ represents a critical review of dominantHan dynasty social and moral ideas from the perspective of this newly formedreligious consciousness.Since the views of the TPJ were later incorporated into the Daoist tradition, itis tempting to call the religious views expressed in the text “Daoist.” It wouldbe more precise, however, to see the text as a link between what has been termedearly China’s “common religion” and the later Daoist tradition. The text dealswith the relationship between man and heaven, man’s sins against heaven and theresulting punishment, the approaching apocalypse, and heaven’s promise ofsalvation. Heaven’s envoy, the Celestial Master, who speaks through the TPJ, hasarrived to announce this promise to the world. The book contains lists ofcommandments and suggests that individuals who follow these might be rewarded byhealth and long life, both for themselves and for their children. It explainswhat to expect after death and how to prepare for it. All this is addressed inthe first instance to a group of believers, but it is meant to reach the men whohold political power. The Celestial Master’s pledge is that if the rulers do ashe bids, they will prosper as individuals and they will make their subjectshappy.Because the TPJ does not belong to China’s “great tradition,” Chinesephilological researchers did not tackle this text until the second half of thetwentieth century. This means that it has come down to us more directly thanhave most “great” texts. It has not been revised and smoothed by generations ofeditors and commentators, as so many other old Chinese texts have been. The textas it stands is poorly written, containing mistaken characters and strange wordsand expressions. Dogmatic variations and modifications and sometimes eveninconsistencies abound. However, it is also full of unusual ideas and uniqueconcepts. It is the aim of this translation to give a full picture of the text,that is, of its rhetoric, its argumentation, and its ideas. A consecutive partof it has therefore been translated, including sections with an intriguing andimportant message and others that seem to have relatively little to say.Since the TPJ is a rather isolated text, it is not always easy to comprehendwhat it says. Still, the main ideas are clear and not difficult to understand,even for readers who are not acquainted with the world from which it stems. Itis actually more accessible than most Daoist texts: it uses only a limitednumber of technical terms, and it presupposes very little education in doctrinalmatters. Despite this, the notes that accompany this translation are long. Theyare an attempt to clarify and elaborate upon the arguments put forth byintroducing material from other parts of the text. They are also an attempt toshow how much the TPJ is indebted to and a part of China’s mainstreamintellectual history, without ever acknowledging its indebtedness by naming itssources or quoting them in detail.5 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn5]THE NOTION OF “GREAT PEACE”The TPJ does not belong to any group of texts, nor does it speak for theinterests of any well-defined school or faction. There is, therefore, no simpleway to identify its place in history or the traditions to which it belongs.Instead, an indirect approach might be helpful for sketching its intellectualand social environment. The text deals with the arrival of “great peace”(taiping). Politicians and thinkers of the Han dynasty (206 B.C.E.—220 C.E.)made much use of this term, and their understanding of taiping forms one of thefoundations of the TPJ’s social and religious teachings. At the same time, andin a contrasting social and intellectual environment, there was, moreover, aTaiping Movement that resulted in violent peasant uprisings. The program ofthese rebels can also serve as background for the message conveyed in the TPJ.But while the authors of the text are indebted to the ideas and ideals of bothgroups, that is, of politicians as well as of peasant rebels, their aims andways of thinking cannot be identified with either.“The Scripture on Great Peace” is an impressive title. The word “scripture”(jing) places the text in proximity to the classical works transmitted from avenerable past. To recite these works was said to be the beginning of alllearning.6 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn6] A scripture was expected to address a seriousand universal need. The character jing originally signified a warp, that is, thevertical thread in weaving, and also, in a slightly different written form, aroad, that is, something that is being employed to pass through things.7[Notes.xhtml#intro1fn7] One of the first books recorded as jing was the MohistCanon, a concise text on the art of reasoning.8 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn8] Thetitle “scripture” was honorary. It was attached to texts that were or werethought to be comprehensive, unique, or seminal. There are long “scriptures”among the thirteen classics, but the short Laozi was also called a “scripture.”Jing was seldom applied to the works of an individual. The Taixuan jing by YangXiong (53 B.C.E.–18 C.E.) is an exception. It was characteristic of a scripturethat it would invite exegesis,9 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn9] so that a host ofcommentaries might develop around it. Although as the Daoist and Buddhist canonsgrew the number of “scriptures” increased, the word remained a sign ofrespect.10 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn10]The slogan of “great peace” referred to political stability and social harmony.The character ping is a pictogram of a set of scales. While “great” (tai) can berendered as “universal,” it also functions as a device to make another characterinto a noun and give it the honor and weight of a concept.11[Notes.xhtml#intro1fn11] “Great peace” sounded attractive to everyone. It didnot point to any particular philosophy or ideology, and therefore it did notalienate anybody. While there can be no doubt about the origins of the TPJ, oneof China’s earliest and most relevant religious texts, an interest in greatpeace preceded the beginnings of religious Daoism and also extended far beyondit. The following two occurrences of great peace are striking.The First Emperor of the Qin dynasty (221–206 B.C.E.) is said to have declared:Previously I have collected what has been written and have expurgated from itall that was found useless. I have assembled large numbers of experts onliterature and on vitality techniques. I wanted to promote great peace.12[Notes.xhtml#intro1fn12]In 1853, the Christian-oriented leader of one of the largest rebellions Chinahad ever experienced established the Heavenly Kingdom of Great Peace (Taipingtianguo 太平天國) in Nanjing and reigned over much of eastern and central China formore than ten years. In both of the above instances, the notion was used in aprogrammatic sense, pointing to the direction in which society as a whole wasexpected to move. The mention of great peace was meant to authorize a change ofpower. Both historical figures were empire builders—real or potential—with akeen sense of their public image and of the power of cultural symbols.The idea of great peace did not come into use until the period preceding thecreation of the Qin dynasty empire, that is, in the third century B.C.E. It doesnot go back to ancient China’s great philosophers, who typically formulatedspecific concepts of how to behave and how to govern that were meant to competewith and oppose other specific concepts. Despite their differences, however,these philosophers were all interested in the question of what sort of conductwould lead to good government, social order, and personal happiness,13[Notes.xhtml#intro1fn13] and for some of their Han dynasty successors, “greatpeace” meant just that. Others, however, envisaged the need for a wider range offorces and argued that good conduct alone would not suffice to achieve greatpeace. A ruler who acted humanely, on the advice of Mengzi, or with generalconcern, as Mozi suggested, would not achieve it. Neither would rule by law inthe fashion of Han Feizi. Instead, from the second century B.C.E. onward,mystical aspects of ancient thought came to the fore. The disengagement of aleader who remained distant, remote, and immobile like the pole star14[Notes.xhtml#intro1fn14] and the strengthening of spiritual power15[Notes.xhtml#intro1fn15] were seen as good preparation for putting the world andoneself in order, as was simplicity. The Laozi and other quietist works praisedsuch conduct. With the establishment of the Han dynasty, the Laozi became orremained a very popular book. Certain aspects of its message were adopted byinfluential political thinkers. These aspects were reflected in the Chun qiu fanlu, for example, a text said to go back to Dong Zhongshu 董仲舒 (ca. 179–ca. 104B.C.E.), who became famous for his promotion of Confucian ideas. The Chun qiufan lu says that the ruler of a country should be like the heart, which keepsthe body in order through its retirement and seclusion. The ruler should thusremain disengaged and reign the country through wu wei 無為, that is, throughnonpurposive action, as advocated in the Laozi, and thereby bring about greatpeace.16 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn16] It was a ruler’s “virtue” or “power” (de 德)—aterm explicated in Laozi’s Daode jing—that was said to enable him to attaingreat peace.17 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn17]The significance of great peace and the question of how to obtain it became afocus of Han dynasty political thought. Risking oversimplification, one mightsay that one position stressed the ruler’s spiritual perfection and emphasizedminimalist administrative procedures and strong psychological control, and thatthe other was mainly concerned with the moral character of a ruler and hisentourage and with proper and wide-ranging administrative policies. Pursuant tothis division, some thinkers were interested in the changes great peace wouldbring to astronomical phenomena, weather conditions, and nature in general,while others thought that social order and the people’s contentment alone weresigns of great peace, and that there was no reason to look for other tokens.Although the two positions coexisted and often coincided, they stillcharacterize two contrasting approaches to the issue.He Xiu 何休 (129–82) was a prominent advocate of the second position, and properadministration was for him an important issue. Following Mengzi’s lead, he sawas great peace a situation in which the population praised the ruler becausetaxes were low.18 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn18] For him, songs of praise as they weretransmitted in the Book of Songs were proof of the prevalence of great peace.19[Notes.xhtml#intro1fn19]To consider the people ’s attitudes as heaven’s voice was in line with pre-Qinideas about the “mandate of heaven.” The people’s satisfaction was a maincriterion for great peace.20 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn20] This point was expressedin the Han shu chapter on ritual and music in the following manner:A king must rely on the rituals practiced by former kings; that is, he must takemeasures appropriate to the season of the year. Loss as well as benefit arisesfrom the feelings of the people. When regulations are implemented step by step,great peace will be attained and everything will be all right.21[Notes.xhtml#intro1fn21]Here the stress is upon a ruler’s respect for and ritual observation of thecourse of the agricultural year. The happiness of the people, and in consequencethe arrival of great peace, depends upon it.The ruler’s respect for moral values is another issue. As Wang Chong (27–ca.100) put it:The proof that government has managed to establish great peace is that thepopulation responds to this by feeling secure and cheerful. Confucius said:“Cultivate yourself, and you will make the population feel secure. Even Yao andShun found this difficult.” That the people feel secure is proof of great peace.When someone rules over others, men must be his starting point. When the peoplefeel secure, Yin and Yang are in harmony. When they are in harmony, the tenthousand beings and plants are being nourished.22 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn22]Again, the critical factor here is the mood of the population. Once the peopleare happy the harmony among them will improve the natural environment. A ruleris expected to look after his subjects, and thus start the process that willlead to general improvement and that will eventually also involve weatherconditions and the harvest.Perceived from this angle, political factors are responsible for the onset ofgreat peace; however, once it has come about heaven and earth will cooperate tocreate a harmonious and prosperous natural environment. Rain, wind, snow, anddew will all come at the right time and place, and even thunder and lightningwill no longer cause fear. The forces of Yin and Yang will be in completebalance.23 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn23]There was, however, an alternative approach. Since cosmic harmony was seen asresulting from natural forces, some thinkers stressed the need to directlyinvolve nature in the process of creating great peace. Zhuangzi hinted at thisneed when he praised the ideal world of the past:When reward and punishment were clear, foolish and wise were properly placed,noble and base occupied their stations, worthy and inadequate were seen for whatthey were; invariably they were allotted tasks according to their abilities,invariably their tasks derived from their titles. This is how one served the manabove or was pastor to the men below, put other things in order or cultivatedone’s own person. Cleverness and strategy were unused. Men invariably referredback to what was from heaven in them (bi gui qi tian 必歸其天). It is this that ismeant by great peace (daping 大平), the utmost in government.24[Notes.xhtml#intro1fn24]Jia Yi 賈誼 (201–169 B.C.E.) expounded similar ideas when he explained how theYellow Emperor, the legendary figure whom early Han dynasty adherents of theLaozi set up as a model ruler, created great peace. The Yellow Emperor was saidto have acted like water, that is, reaching everything without antagonizinganyone. He first established righteousness and proper human relationships, andthen went on mystical journeys, for instance to distant Mount Kunlun, in the farwest. “The world attained the state of great peace only because the YellowEmperor was one with dao.”25 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn25]While it is tempting to draw a line from this passage to certain ideas expressedin the TPJ, the Han dynasty discourse centered on more complicated ways ofprocuring the support of heaven. An apparatus of particularly elaborate andexpensive imperial rituals was put in place. The creation of a Hall of Light(ming tang 明堂) was thought to be helpful. Its supporters argued that the YellowEmperor had at the outset of history reigned from such a hall. For Han dynastyrulers its legendary history, architectural measurements, and cosmologicalcorrelations imbued such a building with great symbolic value. It was meant tobe the place from which great peace would be installed.26[Notes.xhtml#intro1fn26] Emperor Wu (r. 141–87 B.C.E.), who greatly expanded theHan empire, was particularly interested in this project and planned to set up aHall of Light to aid in the proper performance of all ceremonies linked to thecourse of the year. He believed that the construction of the hall “would promotegreat peace.”27 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn27] After lengthy discussions in 109 B.C.E.the hall was built close to Mount Tai (in contemporary Shandong),28[Notes.xhtml#intro1fn28] and a year later the emperor visited the slopes ofMount Tai to perform in person the Feng and Shan sacrifices29[Notes.xhtml#intro1fn29] and thus announce publicly that great peace had beenachieved.30 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn30] Court officials stressed the point thatEmperor Wu had thereby achieved what the First Emperor of the Qin had attemptedwithout success. When the First Emperor was about to perform the ritual, badweather had prevented its completion, 31 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn31] an event hisenemies often referenced. More than a century later, however, the founder of theLater Han dynasty (25–220) emulated Emperor Wu and performed the ritualsuccessfully, thereby consolidating his reign. In each instance the ruler’s ownauthority and that of his dynasty were at stake:On the day the ruler receives the [heavenly] mandate, he revises [ritual]regulations in accordance with heaven. When the world has been brought into astate of great peace, he performs the Feng and Shan sacrifices to announce greatpeace. Why does this have to be done at Mount Tai? Because it is the beginningof the ten thousand beings, the place for [the process of] alternation [betweenYin and Yang].32 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn32]The notion of great peace was thus crucial to the self-representation, andpresumably the impact, of a ruler. To achieve great peace meant to prove oneselfworthy of heaven’s mandate. It was not the need to achieve great peace that wascontentious but rather the method for achieving it. The positions held by Jia Yion the one hand and Emperor Wu’s advisors on the other can be seen as reflectingan opposition between a dao-based and a “literature”—here documented asritual-oriented—approach to government that, according to Mark Lewis, dominatedintellectual life until the early stages of Emperor Wu’s reign.33[Notes.xhtml#intro1fn33] In changing guises, however, it probably remained inforce much longer, despite all official support for the literature faction.A major controversy developed around the question as to at which point in timethe world had been in a state of great peace. There was agreement that GreatYao, one of Confucius’s and Mengzi’s ideal rulers of the long-distant legendarypast, had reigned over a world in peace. His successors Shun and Yu were alsosaid to have brought peace about.34 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn34] The same was saidabout the Yellow Emperor. However, such praise for the past included a certaincritique of the present that others repudiated. The First Emperor in the speechjust cited did not claim he had achieved great peace; with some modesty, heconfessed only that he aimed for it.35 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn35] On otheroccasions he showed more self-confidence. In 210 B.C.E. he authorized aninscription that claimed that the people were happy to follow the unified ruleshe had put in place and that they felt privileged to maintain great peace.36[Notes.xhtml#intro1fn36] Wang Chong, a realistic and independent-minded thinkerof the first century C.E., argued that a state of great peace had been reachedwhen the government was stable and the population content, and that this hadcertainly been achieved in recent times and was actually the case during his ownlifetime. Certain cosmic manifestations might or might not accompany thissituation; they were not crucial to it. There was also no need for the YellowRiver and the Luo to bring forth celestial charts and texts to announce theadvent of great peace or for phoenix and unicorn to be sighted. Universal peacecould take place without such signs.37 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn37] For Wang Chong,Emperor Wen (r. 180–157 B.C.E.) had created great peace at the outset of the Handynasty through his lenient and benevolent rule. So, too, had certain Later Hanrulers achieved great peace, in Wang Chong’s opinion.38 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn38]This judgment reflected Wang Chong’s fairly narrow understanding of the notionof great peace, for which, in his view, good harvests and general bliss were notessential. Instead, he stressed that the people at present remained calm andhonest even when harvest failures had made them destitute, and that thissignified great peace. He also mentioned the much-increased size of China as anaccomplishment that recent rulers had achieved and praised the civilizing impactof this on neighboring people.39 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn39]Scholars who opposed Wang Chong’s matter-of-fact understanding of the term andattributed historical uniqueness to a period of great peace found it difficultto decide whether Confucius had managed to achieve or even promote great peace.Although his Spring and Autumn Annals was written with the aim of great peace inmind, as Dong Zhongshu remarked,40 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn40] this did notnecessarily have any immediate effect. In the Annals, Confucius is said to havecovered three historical periods, that is, a period of disorder, a period ofapproaching peace, and a period of universal great peace “when the barbariantribes became part of the feudal hierarchy, and the whole world, far and near,large and small, was [or would become] like one.”41 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn41] Inthis particular meaning and directly linked to the figure of Confucius, the term“great peace” became part of Kang Youwei’s (1858–1927) speculations about “greatunity” (datong 大同) in the early twentieth century.42 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn42]All agreed that perfect social conditions were necessarily universal.43[Notes.xhtml#intro1fn43] A state that deserved to be called taiping had toencompass the world and not be limited only to China.From the second century B.C.E. onward there was no doubt about Confucius’sexemplary lifestyle, irrefutable teachings, and decisive historical impact, butthat these achievements had in fact resulted in a reign of great peace was lessobvious. The depiction of Confucius’s position was, in this respect, asmultifaceted as becomes a spiritual leader who combines attributes of a teacher,a missionary, and a savior. As Wang Chong observed, the Master had saidexplicitly that the world would be at peace only one generation after thearrival of a true king.44 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn44] Similar questions can beraised in regard to the role of the Celestial Master, who is the main speaker inmuch of the TPJ. His teachings were authorized by heaven and he devoted all hislife to preparing humankind for the arrival of great peace. The depiction of hispersonal situation, his doctrine, and his historical role contains discrepanciesresembling those that Han dynasty scholars created around the figure ofConfucius. While the Celestial Master’s influence is shown to have promoted thearrival of great peace, like Confucius, he was not in a position to bring itabout. Both Confucius and the Celestial Master were depicted as teachers whotried to persuade or convert the rulers of the day to implement reforms. It wasnot in their power to turn into political leaders and enact reforms personally.Clearly, great peace was desirable. It was the best situation for the empire andthe world in general. Throughout the Han dynasty there was no doubt that anyresponsible ruler would attempt to achieve it. The writings of Wang Fu 王符(90–165) document the term’s popularity. He did not fill the word “great peace”with specific content but used it as a medium to propagate his major social andpolitical aims. In suggesting policy, he often reached the conclusion that whathad been suggested was the precondition for opening up the road to great peace:This is the crucial point in all government activities: nothing is better thanto restrain what is superfluous (mo 末) and concentrate on essentials (ben 本),and nothing is worse than to keep a distance from what is essential, whileadorning superfluous items. In building a state it is essential to make thepeople wealthy, and basic to rectify all that is learned. When the people arewell off, they can be taught. When one learns what is correct, one can becomerighteous. When the people are poor, they neglect doing good. When teachings areconfused, there will be deceit. Let people attend schools and there won’t be anydisorder (luan 亂). Let them be righteous, and they will be loyal and full offilial piety. This is the way an intelligent ruler proceeds: he concentrates onthese two in order to create the basis for great peace and to arrive at the goodfortune of receiving auspicious omens.45 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn45]For Wang Fu, proper and widespread education, the merit-based selection ofofficials, and correct work ethics46 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn46] were theconditions for achieving great peace. There can be little doubt that the authorsof the TPJ agreed with Wang Fu on several points. The following line ofargumentation contained in the Qian fu lun is very similar to that adopted bythe TPJ’s Celestial Master:So, for this reason, if one wants to achieve great peace, one must first of allharmonize Yin and Yang. This can only be done by following the intentions ofheaven. To give security to one’s people is the only way of following heaven’sintentions. For the sake of this security, one must examine one’s men carefully.Therefore, the root of a country’s success and failure and the means by which toestablish control and order are an intelligent selection [of officials].47[Notes.xhtml#intro1fn47]The term “great peace” remained attractive even while over the course of thesecond century C.E. the dynasty grew increasingly removed from a state ofstability, peace, and popular approbation and contemporary observers began tolament the lack of order and social cohesion. Wang Chong was rather isolatedamong the intellectuals of the Later Han dynasty when he found evidence of greatpeace not only in the generations preceding his own, but also in the worldaround him. Originally the rule of the Han dynasty had ushered in an era ofrelative stability and well-being through setting up new institutions, promotingeconomic growth, and enlarging Chinese territory, but problems set in toward theend of the first century B.C.E. that were followed by a period of civil war.Some consolidation was achieved when the Later Han dynasty was founded in 25C.E., but the situation changed rapidly over the course of the second centuryC.E. Patricia Ebrey has suggested that one of the major Later Han innovationswas the government’s laissez- faire attitude toward economic processes.Government officials had widely distributed improved tools during the Former Handynasty and had actively promoted new methods of cultivation. These developmentscame to a standstill in Later Han, when the concentration of land and resourcessuch as agricultural skills in a few hands caused the impoverishment of largenumbers of people.48 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn48] There was unrest on several frontswhen processes of social cooperation on which much of the political andadministrative system rested came to naught. The landless fought againstlandowners and administrative authorities, and the administration tried in vainto rein in the big estates. Struggles between different factions of the rulingstrata turned violent. The fact that basic survival became increasinglydifficult added a certain utopian flavor to the idea that general harmony andwelfare, that is, great peace, should prevail among men. Toward the end of theHan dynasty there was so little chance of an orderly arrival of great peace thata rebellious movement took up the slogan. Known as the Taiping Movement, itinvolved an uprising that resulted in the rebels controlling China’s easternprovinces for several months in 184 C.E.THE PEACE THAT WILL SAVE THE WORLDThe text of the TPJ does justice to its title and centers on the need to leadthe world to great peace. The peace the TPJ’s Celestial Master talked about wasthe same peace Han dynasty intellectuals had in mind. Once it arrived it wouldenable all within China and beyond to live happily and without worries. Heavenand earth would show their approbation through reliable and plentiful harvests.While auspicious portents might occur, they were not essential. The textreiterates what Han dynasty intellectuals thought about the methods of achievinggreat peace. The ruler and, with certain modifications, the men engaged toprovide advice and implement policies must possess personal integrity. This wasusually expressed as adherence to the virtues contained in Confucius’s Lun yuand in the Mengzi: maintaining a certain distance from events, refraining fromemotional entanglement, and performing the necessary rituals with properdevotion and concentration. The welfare of the people had to be considered, andan example set that might encourage them in good conduct. There is a high levelof consensus about this in Han dynasty sources. Figures as far removed from eachother as Liu An 劉安 (?179–122 B.C.E.), who believed in personal immortality andquoted the Laozi and the Zhuangzi, and the skeptic Wang Chong, who saw himselffollowing the tradition of Confucius, deemed such behavior by the ruling class aprerequisite for great peace. Moreover, the world of nature became a major andactive component of social cohesion, and Han dynasty thinkers were concernedwith it when they discussed the analogy, correspondence, and interrelationshipbetween heaven, earth, and men. Men were supposed to consider humankind as partof a trinity and to act accordingly in all their endeavors, but the practicalconsequences of this knowledge were largely confined to the sphere of ritualobservances. It was here that a symbolic unity between the three dispensationswas confirmed and maintained throughout the course of the year and in continuousresponse to all the developments and accidents of regular life. The emperor aswell as his family and subordinates would attempt to correspond to heaven, forinstance, by changing their clothes, their food, and their daily observanceswith the changing seasons.The authors of the TPJ did not disagree in principle but stressed the problemthat adherence to the teachings of Confucius and Mengzi had failed to make aruler’s position secure and his subjects happy. For the authors of the TPJ aprocess of rethinking was therefore necessary, and they went further in theirsearch for great peace than was customary, arguing that only a major socialreshuffling could bring it about. For them, great peace was no longer a statethat would be achieved by administrative or ritual means. It did not originatein a ruler’s benevolence, political skill, or spiritual power, but instead inheaven’s concern for humankind. Heaven’s cooperation was deemed essential forcreating a situation in which great peace could be achieved. They stressed thattheir position between heaven and earth obliged men to actively promote theinterest and welfare of heaven and earth. Performances of rituals and respectfor heaven’s symbols as documented in imperial ceremonies would not suffice.Great peace would be achieved once humankind had become one with heaven. Whilethe TPJ authors did not invent this formula, they gave it a radicalinterpretation. “Heaven” (tian 天) is a difficult word. While it has to be seenas one coherent concept, it also covers a wide spectrum of meanings. Itsmeanings extend from the physical sky to “law giver” and “supreme moralprinciple.” It can also refer to the world of nature as opposed to the humanworld. Although heaven has anthropomorphic traits such as a will or a heart, itcan be misleading to see heaven as a deity. It is neither almighty nor eternal.It does not speak, but one might say that it has a voice. Natural occurrences,when observed and properly analyzed, can announce its intentions. The forces ofYin and Yang in their continuous flux and the arranging and rearranging of thefive phases serve as the main tools for this analysis. In contrast to some ofthe sources quoted earlier,49 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn49] the TPJ does not proclaimthat the people speak for heaven. They have an impact on it and they influenceits “feelings,” but what these feelings are must be extracted from naturalevents.The authors of the TPJ proclaimed that society had to abolish all habits thatprevented its naturelike functioning. They saw a particular need for the generaltogetherness of all, and even for a certain equality between all, in the sensethat deficiency, want, and worry in one part of society would certainly have animpact on the whole. This togetherness had to be active, as was the cooperationbetween man, heaven, and earth in the course of the agricultural year. Thus, notto communicate and not to participate was seen as an evil, an idea that led to anumber of detailed prescriptions, from the need to convey any knowledge onemight have gained to the demand that wealth should be shared and that everyoneshould take part in productive labor. Everybody, including women and serfs, waspart of this social interchange. While prescripts related to great peace arevaried and comprehensive, the TPJ’s reform program is best understood from itsprohibitions. All blockage and rupture had to be prevented. The opposite of thesearch for great peace was not the disorderly approach to things, nor was itrebellion (luan 亂), as Liu Xiang 劉向 (79–8 B.C.E.)50 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn50] andother Han dynasty thinkers had presumed, but rather “to interrupt” (jue 絕),which also meant “to bring to an end” or “to kill.” The TPJ authors stressedthat heaven’s interest lay in creating, nourishing, and maintaining life. Thus,whatever brought life to an end was opposed to great peace.Since great peace meant harmony between nature and men, the need to maintain theintegrity of heaven and earth required social reforms. This was man’s constantresponsibility. There was, however, one other consideration. He Xiu and othermainstream thinkers had hinted that great peace would arrive at a certain stageof historical development. It was also generally accepted that historicaldevelopment took place in cycles; Dong Zhongshu’s name was linked to a complexconstruction of the sequence of eras and their specific rise and fall, theirtiming explained and prognosticated by complicated calendrical and numerologicalspeculations.51 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn51] Historical eras were thought to relateto each other as if they were the five phases, producing one another as fire andearth did, or overcoming each other, as in the following passage from the Lü shichun qiu:Before the phase of water is about to replace the phase of fire, heaven is boundto make it known that qi52 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn52] of water is growing instrength. When this is the case, one’s color must be black and all activitiesmust be geared to the phase of water. Once the phase of water has arrived andone is not aware of the [proper] figures and other preparations, things willproceed to the phase of earth [which overcomes that of water].53[Notes.xhtml#intro1fn53]So, in order to correspond to the cyclical change that had allowed him toascend, a new ruler, and in particular the founder of a new dynasty, had toreestablish official life as a whole. The transition from an era that was seenas dominated by one of the five phases to a new era that was controlled byanother phase brought about the need and the opportunity for a new beginning.When I now say that a new king must change the institutions, this does not meanthat he must change the course of things or alter their principle. Since he hasreceived a mandate from heaven, the surname is altered and the kingship renewed.As king, he does not continue [the line of] kings before him. . . . For thisreason he moves to a new abode, assumes a new title, changes the beginning ofthe year, and alters the color of clothes. All this is only because he doesn’tdare not to comply with heaven’s intention and make its position known.54[Notes.xhtml#intro1fn54]While this view of history incorporated the possibility of decay anddestruction, it also contained the promise of innovation.The authors of the TPJ made some use of these speculations and stressed that thepresent circumstances favored a new beginning. But, in principle, their approachto historical development was different and radical.55 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn55]They argued that if great peace were not achieved now, the end of the world—thatis, the end of humankind, heaven, and earth—would be in sight. By envisaging theend of the world the TPJ authors transcended the discourse of the Han dynastyliterati.56 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn56] They did not depict this end in anydetail,57 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn57] but it was stated with great clarity anddecisiveness that all life would cease if it were not preserved by the arrivalof great peace.Ancient society, and as a consequence the Han empire, had to fall apart beforesuch ideas came to the fore. These ideas remained a powerful component of Daoistthought throughout the Middle Ages, although in a modified, less utopian format.The expectation of a sudden end was juxtaposed with the promise that thecommunity of Daoist believers would be transferred at exactly that point in timeto a safe place and delivered from all evils to a new life of perfect bliss.58[Notes.xhtml#intro1fn58] For the authors of the TPJ, however, this option didnot exist. For them, the only possible salvation lay in convincing everyone tomend their ways.THE TAIPING MOVEMENTIn the main, the ideas of the TPJ’s Celestial Master were in accord with theintellectual and social environment at the end of the Han dynasty. During theHan dynasty many called for reform, but the methods of achieving those reformswere subject to controversy. Certain thinkers and politicians called for areturn to the old values of simplicity and integrity; others sought tostrengthen the implementation of the legal code. Virtually all attempts at theimplementation of reforms proved futile and did little to overcome the blatantweakness of the imperial dynasty and its administration, faced as it was withthe increasing presence of independent and often ill-adjusted social groups.Among these were large numbers of people who had been forced to give up theirland and thus their livelihood. They had little to lose. The existence of suchgroups is well documented, including by government attempts to ameliorate thesituation. Itinerant men and their families were promised tax relief when theyreturned to the place where they had once owned land; local officials wereadvised to feed them from public granaries; and restrictions on hunting,fishing, and the use of government forests were abolished.59[Notes.xhtml#intro1fn59] Over the course of the second century C.E., however,the landless became too numerous for public support and there were frequentviolent uprisings. Groups of drifting peasants were easily persuaded to risktheir lives in order to get access to public granaries or other sources of food.Certain officials who were perceived as particularly severe would also meet withresistance and insubordination. At the same time, both land concentration andproductivity increased. The constant division of land brought about by the rulesof inheritance helped to create an ongoing need for the acquisition of new land,so that units of cultivation became larger and were worked on more efficientlythrough advances in agricultural tools and methods. There was therefore adecrease not only in the number of independent farmers, but also in the numberof those needed to work the land.60 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn60] The fact that theowners of large estates employed militias to protect their belongingsstrengthened the likelihood of armed conflicts. These remained regional, butthey destabilized the political system as a whole.There can be little doubt that the large groups of starving and destitute peoplewho roamed the country in search of employment and food were a political forceto be reckoned with. A redistribution of land might have been the answer, butthis could only be implemented after the dynasty in power had been toppled.Whether these groups would also have contributed in any way to the formation ofideas is much more doubtful. Yu Xu 虞詡(d. 136), a skillful politician who hadhandled several uprisings with great success, arrived at the followingconclusion: “These rebels stick together like dogs or sheep. All they want is tobe warm and eat their fill.”61 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn61] But if we want to dojustice to the TPJ and its place in China’s intellectual history, we must raisethe issue of what these rebels aimed for.The Taiping Movement, which erupted in the Yellow Turban Rebellion of 184 C.E.,came as the climax of decades of uprisings. The latter inherited all of theformer’s instruments of initiating, organizing, and staging an armed rebellion.Rebel leaders were literate and, in principle, aware of the need to let culturalsymbols work for them. While they certainly demanded tax relief and otherwelfare measures, they also took the trouble to define their historical andcosmic position. In this respect, their choice of a color to signify theirintentions was relevant. Yellow, which in the system of five phases was thecentral phase, was considered the color of earth, for instance, and could beseen as being produced by and consequently following the phase of fire, whichthe Later Han rulers saw as their own symbol. Moreover, yellow was the color ofthe legendary Yellow Emperor, whom early Han dynasty thought had linked to theLaozi. Yellow thus became the color that late Han dynasty rebels who wanted toreplace the ruling house frequently appropriated. Another option was black,which represented the phase of water. Again, this was related to the reigningdynasty’s own phase of fire, which the “Black Emperor” hoped to overcome just aswater can extinguish fire. Although most rebels took up traditional titles like“king” or “emperor,” some chose more programmatic names. In 148 C.E. rebelleaders in eastern Henan called themselves “Sons of the Yellow Emperor” and“Perfected” (zhen ren 真人), a term that goes back to Zhuangzi, who heaps thefollowing praise on the perfected:The perfected of old did not know how to be pleased that they were alive, didnot know how to hate death, were neither glad to come forth nor reluctant to goin; they were content to leave as briskly as they came. They did not forget thesource where they began, did not seek out the destination where they would end.They were pleased with the gift that they received, but forgot it as they gaveit back. It is this that is called “not allowing the thinking of the heart todamage the way, not using what is of man to do the work of heaven.” . . . Hence,they were one with what they liked and one with what they disliked, one whenthey were one and one when they were not one. When one, they were of heaven’sparty, when not one, they were of man’s party. Someone in whom neither heavennor man wins over the other is what is meant by “perfected.”62[Notes.xhtml#intro1fn62]With the use of the figure of the Yellow Emperor and the title of “Perfected,”the rebels entered the sphere of the supernatural. The above passage, complexand philosophical though it may be, shows that the perfected can be seen asmediating between heaven and men, and even between life and death. In thissense, the title suggests that its owner has extraordinary spiritual powers.This became of interest to the First Emperor of the Qin dynasty, who attemptedto join the ranks of the perfected himself.63 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn63]While the expectation of superhuman support was omnipresent in Han dynastyChina,64 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn64] it must have been essential when a group ofpeasants ventured to take on officials and other representatives of stateauthority. “Shamans” (wu 巫), as the historians called them, were always at handto accompany rebel leaders and offer advice. They were involved, for instance,when the Red Eyebrows staged an uprising in 18 C.E. Before the rebel leadersannounced the foundation of a new empire, wu in their service spread it aboutthat a local deity had demanded the installation of an emperor.65[Notes.xhtml#intro1fn65]Over the course of the first and second centuries C.E., spiritual concernsbecame more widespread and powerful. A first-century wu-led uprising did not endwith the execution of its leader. His followers spread the message that he hadnot really died but lived on as a deity. Consequently, calm was restored onlyafter these followers had also been crushed.66 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn66]“Messenger,” which meant messenger from heaven,67 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn67] wasanother title that suggested that a rebel leader had divine support. This waswhat Zhang Bolu 張伯路 and his followers called themselves when they set out in 109C.E. to eliminate higher officials and burn government buildings. There weremany such insurrections from the 140s onward, pointing to a weakening of theauthority and legitimacy of the ruling dynasty. Perhaps Mansvelt Beck has apoint when he links the rebels’ demands directly to the realms of the Han court,where in 144 C.E. the general-in-chief Liang Ji 梁冀(d. 159) had fairly openlypoisoned the ruling emperor in order to replace him with his younger brother.68[Notes.xhtml#intro1fn68] It is also interesting to note that in the regionswhere Zhang Jue 張 角 and his followers were at work, no uprisings are mentionedfor the decade preceding the year 184 C.E.;69 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn69] it was asif calmness had spread in preparation for a major effort to topple the reigningdynasty.We know more about the background and activities of the Taiping rebels thanabout their predecessors. Their uprising was bigger and the dynasty’s defenseswere weaker. The rebels therefore posed a serious threat, not just to regionalor provincial authorities, but to the administration of the empire as a whole.Consequently, the ancient historians took them seriously. Their observations areimportant to us since we must assume that the TPJ originated in an environmentwhere the misery and despair of the people, as well as their beliefs and hopes,were similar to those of the late Han peasants.Zhang Jue began recruiting followers around the year 171 C.E.70[Notes.xhtml#intro1fn70] Wide-ranging epidemics were reported for that year, asthey were for the years 173, 179, and 182.71 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn71] Healingthe sick was one of his primary activities:Zhang Jue from Julu [in present Hebei] had recently called himself “greatworthy72 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn72] and honest teacher.” He believed in theteachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi. He assembled disciples around him.Kneeling before him, they confessed their mistakes. With incantations and waterin which talismans had been dissolved, he attempted to cure illness. Sometimeshe succeeded. The people had faith in him. He sent eight disciples to the fourdirections in order to convert the world to his “excellent teachings” (shan dao善道).73 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn73] They spread lies and delusions, and in thecourse of more than ten years his followers numbered several hundred thousand.This involved commanderies and provinces. Everyone from Qing, Xu, You, Ji, Jing,Yang, Yan, and Yu came under this influence. Zhang Jue installed thirty-six fang方. Fang is the same as “general.” A great fang was in charge of more than tenthousand men, and a small fang more than six or seven thousand. Each of theminstalled his own chiefs. They then spread the message: “The blue heaven hasdied and the yellow heaven must be established. When the jiazi 甲子 year is herethe world will have great joy.” They wrote the characters jiazi everywhere withwhite chalk, in the capital on walls and on the gates to bureaus, and onofficial buildings in provinces and commanderies. In the year 184, the GreatGeneral (dafang 大方) Ma Yuanyi 馬元義 and others planned for an uprising in Ye [insouthern Hebei] after they had gathered tens of thousands in Jing and Yang [inthe south]. Ma Yuanyi traveled several times to and from the capital, consultingwith regular palace attendants Feng Xu 封婿, Xu Feng 徐奉, and others. They agreedon the fifth day of the third month for a simultaneous uprising, inside [thecapital?] and outside. Before the uprising had taken place, Zhang Jue’s discipleTang Zhou 唐周 from Jinan submitted a memorial in which he made [the plan]known.74 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn74]The uprising got off to a premature, but still very powerful and quite united,start before Zhang Jue could be apprehended. In 184, which was a jiazi year andthus the beginning of a new sixty-year cycle, the rebellion broke outsimultaneously in sixteen commanderies to the south, east, and northeast of thecapital, Luoyang. Local army contingents were quickly defeated, provincialgovernors were kidnapped, and imperial officials fled the scene.75[Notes.xhtml#intro1fn75]What does this account teach us about the ideas that informed the rebels andtheir movement? Zhang Jue found access to people through healing the sick. He issaid to have called himself “great physician.”76 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn76] Inthis capacity, he made use of talismans addressed to the spirits that werethought to have brought forth the illness. When issuing a talisman, Zhang Jue issaid to have performed the ritual of raising the staff with nine knots inaccordance with shamanistic practice.77 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn77]Zhang Jue is called a follower of Huang-Lao 黃老; that is, of the Yellow Emperorand of Laozi, or rather of a school of thought that went under the name of thesetwo legendary figures. This school is represented on the one hand by a set oftexts dating from the early Han dynasty that deals with political thought.78[Notes.xhtml#intro1fn78] The texts incorporate ideas from not only the Laozi,but also other ancient texts. The ruler is supposed to remain distant and toconcentrate on his spiritual excellence, while government is expected to belimited, lenient, and welfare-oriented. Laws and regulations rather thanpersonal morality and judgment are seen as proper and efficient guidelines. Onthe other hand, Huang-Lao was the label used for individuals who searched forpersonal health, longevity, and even immortality, a search that was popular atleast from the First Emperor of the Qin onward and that remained so throughoutthe Han dynasty. The titles of several early medical texts also refer to theYellow Emperor.Zhang Jue’s movement grew rapidly. He shared the leadership with his twobrothers, thus creating a trinity, which was of great symbolic value in that itwas seen to represent the unity of heaven, earth, and man. The three assumed thetitles “General of Heaven,” “General of Earth,” and “General of Men.”79[Notes.xhtml#intro1fn79] Moreover, Zhang Jue emulated earlier rebels by callinghimself “Yellow Heaven” and by distinguishing his followers by requiring them towear yellow headbands, or even, according to another source, yellow clothing:The Yellow Turbans dressed only in plain yellow. They did not carry weapons butwore long gowns and moved comfortably as if on wings. When they arrived in acommandery or county, everyone followed them. On such a day, heaven would be allyellow.80 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn80]Officials tolerated the movement. While people joined rapidly, the authoritiesdid not get involved because Zhang Jue was only “educating” his followers.81[Notes.xhtml#intro1fn81] Certain reports described the situation as serious,however, and suggested measures of repression:Zhang Jue’s secret plans become increasingly dangerous. The empire is full ofwhispers and rumors, and it is claimed that Zhang Jue and his followers havegained secret entry into the capital and have spies within the court. Theytwitter like birds, they have the hearts of wild beasts, and they make plotstogether. But in provinces and commanderies the whole question is taboo. Nobodywants to hear about it. [Officials] compare notes with one another privately,but they are reluctant to say anything in the open.82 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn82]Because of factional controversies, such warnings were not heeded. After theeunuchs instigated a proscription in 169 C.E., career officials were largelyexpelled from power and could only hope that an uproar would weaken the eunuchs’position. This hope was fulfilled when the proscription was finally lifted inthe year 184 C.E. Once the central government had taken things in hand, therebels’ main forces were defeated in less than six months, but uprisings underthe name of the Yellow Turbans continued for years in various locations. Thegovernment relied increasingly on local warlords and their private armies tocontain the rebels.The rapid growth of the movement is of greater relevance for us than itseventual defeat, which only tells us that at that stage the dynasty still hadenough authority to make it feasible for all factions of the ruling strata tounite in its defense. Here is another description of the movement’s beginnings:Zhang Jue and his brothers began an uprising in Ji [present-day southern Hebei],under the slogan of Yellow Heaven. There were thirty-six fang, who promotedcooperation everywhere. The leaders were like stars behind clouds, encircled bytheir rank and file, who, dragged into this by exhaustion and hunger, made themost of it.83 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn83]Events proved Zhang Jue’s message to have been so attractive that after aboutten years of proselytizing he could command the support of several hundredthousand followers:Some people sold up all their property and left their homes to follow him. Thepilgrims blocked the roads, and those who became ill and died before theyreached him numbered by the tens of thousands.84 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn84]The rebels must have dominated life in Han China’s most populous provinces forabout six months. Their message, if we are to trust the historians, consisted ofthe promise that illness would be healed and that welfare measures would be putin place once the reigning dynasty had been overthrown. Whether a promise ofsalvation and spiritual transformation was at stake, we cannot tell, but we knowthat the rebels’ program was of some general interest. They had numerouscontacts with all strata of the population. What they promulgated was said tohave been noticed and read in the capital, and there is also Fan Ye’s spuriousnote that the Yellow Turban leader made use of a text on great peace, as will bediscussed later.What did Zhang Jue and his followers believe in? They believed in a world ofspirits who had the power to cause, prevent, and heal illness, and also in thearts and techniques associated with the name of the Yellow Emperor through whichthey hoped to increase health, energy, and power and thus to prolong theirlives. They also believed in their own mission. Zhang Mancheng 張曼成, chief of agroup of Yellow Turbans in Nanyang (in present-day Henan), showed greatconfidence when he called himself the “high spirit messenger” (shen shang shi神上使).85 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn85] Zhang Bolu had also used the title “messenger,”and one can see here parallels with the use of the word “messenger” ingrave-securing writs. We will come back to this in more detail. Buddhist attackson Daoist practices made much of the fact that the early Daoists shared many oftheir techniques with shamanistic practitioners.86 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn86]Buddhist sources accused Zhang Lu and his predecessors of making use of theHuangshen Yuezhang 黃神越章, the “Yue-type petition to the Yellow Spirit,”87[Notes.xhtml#intro1fn87] to control demons, for instance. Similar accusationscould have been made against Zhang Jue. He healed by magic techniques, inparticular through talismans. We may therefore assume that his success inconverting large numbers of people lay partly in providing the services theyexpected from the shaman, or wu, they trusted.Zhang Jue had an ambitious agenda. This is documented in his attempt toassociate his activities with heaven. He is said to have assumed the title ofYellow Heaven (zi hao huang tian 自號黃天), either for himself or for the period ofhis reign.88 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn88] Another source says “he spoke of himselfas ‘great peace of the yellow heaven’ (huang tian taiping 黃天泰平).”89[Notes.xhtml#intro1fn89] Clearly, for Zhang Jue heaven was a divine power withwhich he felt entitled to establish direct contact as if he were heaven’s sonand thus, we must conclude, the emperor.90 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn90] But theYellow Turbans are also said to have promoted the “Grand One” (Tai yi 太一 or 乙),another divine entity of high standing, and in the following remind Cao Cao(155–220) that he once did likewise:Formerly in Jinan [in today’s Shandong], when you damaged religious altars,91[Notes.xhtml#intro1fn91] you believed like us in the Grand One of the Center andof Yellow (zhong huang tai yi 中黃太乙). It looked as if you had understood thecorrect way, but now you once more go astray. The course of the Han is completedand the yellow dynasty must be established. When heaven makes a great turn, noteven someone like you can remain in place.92 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn92]While the Grand One figured in Warring States religious beliefs, its role wasenhanced by Emperor Wu of the Han. On the advice of certain fang shi, that is,experts in vitality techniques, in his service, the emperor initiated sacrificesto the triad of the Grand One, heaven, and earth.93 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn93] Butthe Grand One was also a popular deity to which followers of dao addressed hymnsin the second century C.E.94 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn94] It later became animportant figure in the Daoist pantheon. For Tao Hongjing (456–536), the GrandOne was in charge of all the minor deities, who enliven, protect, and controlthe human body. Its title “the essence of the embryo, the master oftransformations” reveals that it was seen as the principle of evolution, as theoneness in the process of development.95 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn95] When the TPJ’sCelestial Master advises disciples on how to live long lives, he mentions theCelestial Grand One (Tian tai yi):If you don’t want to die from exhaustion, you must keep company with qi as ifyou were the mysterious female [Laozi 6]. You need to resemble heaven to dothis. Then how can you ever die? If you can’t achieve it all at once set up aroom for meditation and go there to think about dao; by fasting you will unitewith qi. In this way, the spirits of heaven and earth will all assemble and youwill not return to ordinary life but attend the Celestial Grand One, who willreceive you in audience in the central pole star (zhongji 中极) and install youwith talismans (fu 符).96 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn96]Judging by their choice of divine support, the rebels certainly had imperialambitions. They meant to reinvent the whole system and its major deities,transforming heaven as well as the Grand One into promoters of yellow, that is,of their own program. They thus acknowledged the tradition of heaven’s authorityand of heaven-instigated cyclical change. The promotion of yellow survived theYellow Turbans’ defeat. When Cao Cao’s son established his own Wei dynasty in220 C.E., he called the first reign period “Yellow Beginning” (huang chu 黃初).97[Notes.xhtml#intro1fn97]THE MOVEMENT OF THE CELESTIAL MASTERSThe historical importance of the Taiping Movement and Yellow Turban Rebellion isenhanced by the fact that they were not isolated events. The various peasantrebellions that preceded them have already been mentioned. Moreover, they werefollowed by uprisings right up until the Han dynasty was dissolved in 220 C.E.We may assume that since economic and political circumstances did not improve,the demand for alternative solutions also did not subside. Moreover, thecomparative strength and vigor of these uprisings further damaged the dynasty’sauthority and legitimacy.The movement of the Celestial Masters that later Daoists cherished as thebeginnings of their religious community was contemporaneous with Zhang Jue’sactivities. Since it lasted longer and developed in a less violent fashion, weknow much more about it than we do about the Taiping Movement. This knowledge isat least as important for the reading of the TPJ as what we know about ZhangJue. Because the Celestial Masters are seen as the founders of the Daoistreligion, ample research on them has been undertaken. What we need to do here,therefore, is only to throw enough light on them to help us better understandthe TPJ.Zhang Ling, who is also and more respectfully called Zhang Daoling 張道陵, wassupposed to have created the movement of the Celestial Masters and to have beenthe first person who was addressed by the title of Celestial Master. What isknown about this figure is sketchy, but we may well assume that he was ahistorical figure. He is said to have grown up in northwestern Jiangsu and thenmoved to Sichuan, where he set up a religious group in the Heming Mountains westof Chengdu. Hagiographic sources tell us that he studied the classics98[Notes.xhtml#intro1fn98] when young but then became interested in longevitypractices, an interest he found difficult to maintain, for financial reasons. Heseems to have come from a peasant background. In Sichuan, he managed to attractdisciples and financial supporters. Members of his group were expected tocontribute five pecks of rice, thus leading his movement to become known as the“Way of Five Pecks of Rice.” The movement was continued by his son and by hisgrandson, Zhang Lu 張魯 (fl. 190–215), who became associated with a certain ZhangXiu 張修 (probably no relation). In the year 184 C.E., that is, at the time of theYellow Turban Rebellion, Zhang Xiu staged a local uprising. In 190 C.E., bothZhang Lu and Zhang Xiu were co-opted by the provincial governor to safeguardHanzhong, that is, the region that was their stronghold and that stretched fromnorthwestern Sichuan to Hubei and Shaanxi. Both were appointed to official rankat a time when, as mentioned above, the central government was beginning to relyincreasingly on local strongmen and their armies to subdue uprisings in thetradition of the Yellow Turbans. Moreover, Zhang Lu’s access to the governor wasimproved through his mother, who is said to have had free access to thegovernor’s home, thanks to her beauty as well as her expertise in longevitytechniques.99 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn99] Zhang Lu eliminated Zhang Xiu, andrelations with the provincial administration soured after the death of thegovernor. As a consequence, Zhang Lu took further steps toward making his ownterritory independent from provincial interference. The central governmentcooperated and installed him as “Gentleman of the Household in Charge ofProtecting the People,” and thus governor of Hanzhong, which he renamed“Hanning.” His position was strong enough that he became a party in the strugglefor power that accompanied the demise of the dynasty.From 196 C.E. onward, the role of the Han emperor was reduced to that of apuppet in the hands of Cao Cao, which gave some legitimacy to Cao Cao’s questfor power. But there were other contenders: Sun Quan (182–252), south of theYangzi, Liu Zhang (d. 223), and, later, Liu Bei (161–223), toward the west,south of Hanzhong. The Liu family had the same name as that of the ruling Handynasty, a fact of some propagandist relevance. There were clashes between LiuZhang and Zhang Lu.100 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn100] While Cao Cao had beenunsuccessful in his attempt to amalgamate the territory of Sun Quan and LiuZhang—that is, the states of Wu and Shu—he managed to extend his reign towardthe west, and in 215 C.E., after lengthy negotiations, Hanzhong became part ofWei, that is, of Cao Cao’s territory. Zhang Lu and his sons received officialtitles to signify their allegiance to the Wei court and the population at largewas resettled in different parts of China. Thus ended China’s first, and for along time its only, theocracy.The movement in Sichuan lasted for more than a generation. Its success can becredited to several conflicting factors. The relative geographical isolation ofHanzhong added to the stability and duration of Zhang Lu’s reign. Since hisindependence posed no threat to the central authority, he was left alone.Moreover, the region was so close to China’s western border that non-Chinesepeople participated in the movement. The uprising of the year 184 C.E. as wellas subsequent upheavals in the region incorporated the Qiang, whose threateningpresence had replaced that of the Xiongnu toward the end of the second centuryC.E. Their participation swelled the numbers and increased the strength of theCelestial Master movement and might also have had an impact on the formation ofcertain shamanistic rituals of purification. Opponents of Daoism mentioned these“scandalous” practices in their attacks:The Fast of the Mud and Soot goes back to Zhang Lu. Since the Di barbarians werehard to civilize, he controlled them by this method; they rolled in the mud likeasses, smeared their faces with yellow earth, and, their combs removed, lettheir hair hang down.101 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn101]On the other hand, Zhang Ling is said to have been educated in the east. We mustassume that this is where the institutions and practices that the CelestialMaster and Taiping movements had in common had originated. Moreover, Zhang Lingand his successors produced writings, among which might have been the Laozicommentary entitled Xiang’er 想爾.The beliefs and practices that prevailed in Zhang Lu’s community were notdissimilar from what we know of Zhang Jue’s aims and methods. As was the caseamong the Yellow Turbans, the process of healing was important for attracting,converting, and controlling people. In treating patients, the Celestial Mastermovement stressed the confession of sins, as had Zhang Jue. The sick wereexpected to withdraw to an oratory to meditate on their wrongdoings. Alibationer (jijiu 祭酒) put the confessions of the sick in writing, together withthe patient’s full name. Three copies were made: one was placed on a mountain tobe sent to heaven, another was buried in the earth, and the third was immersedin water. The spirits would then, it was hoped, be reconciled and allow thepatient to recover.102 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn102] Rituals of confession becamecharacteristic of the early Daoist movements, perhaps adapting certain Buddhistpractices.103 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn103] Not only the sick, but everyone wasexpected to practice what was called self-examination. People were sent torepair roads as retribution for wrong-doing. For a small offense (guo 過), lessserious than a crime (zui 罪), they were expected to work on a length of onehundred feet. Only after three violations would someone be subjected to formalpunishment as outlined in the Han dynasty penal code. Thus, moral standards werereinforced by involving spirits in a system of rewards and punishments. This wasnot new in itself. Warring States accounts of historical events contain examplesof celestial or spiritual retribution that resulted in culprits suffering andthe good being rewarded. The Mozi stresses the idea of recompense,104[Notes.xhtml#intro1fn104] but in the main, with the exception of Han Feizi andhis intellectual friends, philosophers remained aloof from the idea that menshould do good because it paid. The program of the early religious movements,however, catered to a mass audience, and in this respect the authors of the TPJwere more careful, as if they were aware of the unreasonable expectations that asimple moral system based on rewards and punishment might raise. They createdtheir own system, more complex and multilayered but still based on the promiseof rewards for good deeds and thoughts.The well-being of individuals was regarded as dependent upon that of thecommunity. Hanzhong was divided into twenty-four “commanderies” (zhi 治). Thecharacter zhi means “to govern” as well as “to heal,” and both of theseactivities were tasks of the libationer, who combined administrative withspiritual functions. In this way, he—or she, at least at a later stage ofreligious organization—was expected to “control evil” (jian ling 条令). Regularrecitations of the Laozi were central to ritual practice. Believers wouldwithdraw to oratories or “houses of quietude” (jing shi 靜室) to meditate. Anotherinstitution was the “responsibility huts” (yi she 義舍), where provisions werekept. Travelers were permitted to eat their fill, but if more were removed, thespirits would take revenge and make the culprit ill. It seems that theadministration was efficient. Chen Shou (233–97), author of the San guo zhi, putit in the following terms:They did not set up any local officials, but everything was administered bylibationers. The people as well as the foreign tribes were quite happy withit.105 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn105]Does all this point to a society in a state of great peace? We must assume itdoes, although its appearance was not in all respects as earlier Han dynastythinkers had imagined it. The scope of the great peace was regional. The peoplewere happy to cooperate, and this cooperation was achieved by novel means. Wehear nothing about the model behavior of their leaders or about a process ofongoing education, nor were the leaders seen to perform any rituals reminiscentof the state cult, as, for instance, the Feng and Shan sacrifices that werementioned above. However, coordination between men and nature played a role inZhang Lu’s community, and symbols were used to promote it. All numericalfigures—that is, thirty-six, twenty-four, nine, and so on—were of cosmicnumerological relevance; the unity between heaven, earth, and men wasacknowledged; and the standard calendrical unit of the sixty-year cycle wasused. Men’s needs were taken into consideration, and in return they wereexpected to follow the rules and become, as the Daoists put it, “good” people.Such people did not prove their worth by simply obeying their parents andsuperiors but were expected to concentrate all their endeavors on strengtheninglife, in the first instance their own. From a philosophical point of view, thereis nothing new in this. The quietist chapters of the Guanzi and parts of theHainan zi point in a similar direction. However, these texts addressed theiradvice to members of the elite, who hoped by these means to gain power andinfluence. The attempt to transform such ideas into political policy bypropagating them on a mass scale was new and required strengthening belief in aworld of spirits, where good deeds and good thoughts were supposed to result ingood health and cosmic harmony. The word gui 鬼, often translated as “demon,”occurs frequently when the historians report on Zhang Jue, Zhang Lu, and theirfollowers.106 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn106] Again, the belief in the power of demonsand other spirits is well documented and was a general feature of ancient andmedieval China. However, in the early Daoist community spirits were put tosystematic use. The doctrine of the omnipresence and irrefutable judgment ofthese spirits replaced the need for the state’s repressive organs, and itcovered political leaders with a comfortable mantle of authority. They had lessneed for the traditional tools of governments. Instead, they maintained orderand conveyed a sense of purpose by referring to their spiritual support. Therebels’ institutions had a certain utopian quality and thus resembled theprogram that the TPJ’s Celestial Master explained to his disciples. It involvedthe active, responsible participation of all human beings and of the world ofspirits. The historians do not mention the promise of longevity. Whether itoccupied a special place on the rebels’ agenda or was subdued by concerns forhealth and welfare, we cannot tell.107 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn107]We are told that Zhang Jue was a follower of the Yellow Emperor and of Laozi.That is all we hear with regard to his belief in Laozi. Our sources are moreexplicit with regard to Zhang Lu. For the Hanzhong community, the recitation ofthe Laozi was a major, if not the main, ritual event. The adoption of the textand the figure of Laozi made this community special and distinct from othergroups that gathered around shamanistic healers. That the Laozi was a text towhich many people turned for basic advice about life, and about death, is clearfrom the fact that it was frequently used as a funeral object. Its attractionlay not only in its content but also in the magic, spirit-controlling powersassociated with it. The text itself is rather short, consisting of only “fivethousand characters,” as the Daoist tradition has it, and is mainly composed ofisolated rhymed passages. Its message is often cryptic and occasionallycontradictory. The text is addressed to a ruler who seeks social and politicalstability, but it can also be read as proverbs or prophesies, deep in meaningbut not easy to access. Without explanatory annotation, therefore, it might havebeen used more as an object of adoration and wonder than for practical guidance.It seems that Zhang Lu understood this problem and produced a commentary toguide believers’ reading of the old text.108 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn108] Accordingto the Xiang’er, the Laozi is a guide for self-cultivation. Meditation,breathing exercises, and sexual practices play a role in helping believers totranscend death. Moral rules are incorporated, including both a long list ofgeneral commandments such as not to kill, but also specific advice on how alwaysto remain flexible and never to waste qi, rush into action, seek fame, ordelight in arms. As Stephen Bokenkamp points out, much attention is paid to thedistinction between what is correct and “orthodox” (zheng 正), in the sense ofadhering to dao as a religious doctrine, and what is false.109[Notes.xhtml#intro1fn109] The term wei, as in the Laozi’s wu wei 無為, is thus tobe understood as “artificial” and “false” (wei 偽).The TPJ’s Celestial Masterwould have approved of such advice. While the teachings of the Xiang’er weremeant to help believers live long and happy lives, they could also be taken as aguide for a harmonious and stable society. They thus differed from the moreintellectual and mystical interpretations of Laozi by Yan Zun (first centuryB.C.E.), Heshang Gong (second century C.E.), and Wang Bi (226–49).Making the Laozi into a religious text was an important step in the formation ofthe Daoist religion, but it was eclipsed by the deification of the figure Laozi.The transformation of both text and man seem not to have originated with theDaoist mass movements but rather with aristocratic practice. King Ying of Chuwas said to have established a cult for Buddha in 65 C.E. and recited “thesubtle words of Huang-Lao.” He received the praise of Emperor Ming (r. 57–75)for such pious and gentle conduct.110 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn110] This points tothe ritual of reciting the Laozi, but not necessarily to a cult for Huang-Lao orfor Laozi as a deity.111 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn111] However, Emperor Huan (r.146–68) did initiate such rituals toward the end of his reign.112[Notes.xhtml#intro1fn112] While different sources from the second half of thesecond century C.E. speak of the figure as if it were a divine being, they donot convey a uniform picture; they stress different aspects. On the one hand, welearn from the Scripture on the Transformations of Laozi that the Lord Lao’sexistence was characterized by a chain of transformations that made him appearas various personages in different periods.113 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn113] On theother hand, in the early Celestial Masters movement Lord Lao and dao, or “theone,” are used interchangeably, as we find in the Xiang’er:The one disperses its form as qi and gathers in its form as the Most High LordLao, whose permanent rule is on Mount Kunlun.114 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn114]The Celestial Master tradition centers on the moment in 142 C.E. when Lord Laoinstalled Zhang Daoling as Celestial Master, an event not mentioned in theScripture on the Transformations of Laozi. Such variations are relevant for ourunderstanding of the message contained in the TPJ. We here meet many ideas intheir first formulation, that is, before or during the first attempts at theestablishment of doctrinal orthodoxy. For this reason, lack of uniformity mustbe expected. Central points, however, might well be commonly accepted. In thecase of the figure of Lord Lao, the central point is the text of the Laozi.Transformations has a line that accords completely with the ritual practices ofZhang Lu’s Celestial Masters community: “If you want to know where to find me[Laozi], recite the text of five thousand characters ten thousand times.”115[Notes.xhtml#intro1fn115]THE TAIPING MISSIONARY PROJECTWhen the Celestial Master who figures as the main speaker in the TPJ sentdisciples into the world to preach the arrival of great peace he resembled theleaders of the Daoist movements of the Later Han dynasty. He taught believersthey should change their lifestyle and adhere to new values, and he proclaimedthe need for social and political reorganization. Some of his ideas resemblethose of Yellow Turban and Celestial Master Daoism, but this does not mean thatthe authors of the TPJ derived their insights from those movements or that ZhangJue and Zhang Lu learned from the TPJ. Contacts were less direct and morecomplex. Manifestations of the emerging Daoist religion were not uniform. WhenLord Lao became a religious personage, for instance, he was equipped withvarious, and sometimes conflicting, qualities from the outset.116[Notes.xhtml#intro1fn116] However, there were several important points on whichthere seems to have been agreement among Daoist-oriented groups.For the TPJ’s Celestial Master, as well as for the religious movements known tous from historical sources, the key to social order, health, and happiness wasthe personal morality of all group members. To enforce this morality, spiritswho offered rewards and meted out punishment were envisaged. For the authors ofthe TPJ these spirits were agents of heaven. The regulations that were setdown—for example, with regard to the consumption of wine and meat—differed, butthey all pertained to quietist values and respect for the maintenance of vitalenergy. Repentance played a role, although rituals evolving around this are notreflected in the TPJ.Human beings were expected to see themselves as agents of a superhuman power.For the TPJ’s Celestial Master this power was heaven. Dao played a limited roleand Laozi no role at all. Still, the parallels are striking. Not to followcommandments was not just a mistake or a crime; it was a sin. The use oflanguage and the details differ: for instance, zui, which in the TPJ is often“sin,” an offense against heaven’s will and against the protection andstrengthening of life, seemed for Zhang Lu’s community to mean “crime,” that is,an offense against clearly defined worldly rules. This difference might reflectthe fact that Zhang Lu’s reign was theocratic. In both contexts good and badwere redefined from a novel perspective, thus creating a community that wasindependent of the Han dynasty state and critical of its values.The TPJ’s Celestial Master demanded that his disciples organize and spread thegood news to the whole empire. This was, in fact, what Zhang Jue and hisfollowers did, for more than a decade and with great success. By pointing to theonset of a new sixty-year cycle, they incorporated some eschatological elementsto add urgency to their message. Missionary activity also played a role in theSichuan community, especially after it was dispersed in 215 C.E. We may assumethat from the perspective of the TPJ’s Celestial Master the different groups ofbelievers who in the second century C.E. and beyond spread new religious ideas,commandments, and institutions were all participating in or competing with hisown project of saving the world.HISTORICAL STAGES OF A SCRIPTURE ON GREAT PEACEThe origin, transmission, and finally publication and dissemination of a taipingtext are interwoven with the development and growth of the Daoist religion, andthis is the background against which the following brief account of thescripture ‘s historical stages is meant to be seen. When we consider thewidespread interest in the arrival of great peace during the Han dynasty, it isnot surprising that the concept appeared in the title of a text. A text on greatpeace can be detected at several stages, but there are no early quotations orreliable bibliographical accounts that would allow us to establish a date forthe writing of that text. Since the language and content of the text point tothe second century C.E., we may assume that these stages actually dealt withtextual material that has been transmitted in the TPJ as we know it today. Theyare of interest even if they cannot be proven to represent historical fact. Thereceived text contains important observations and conclusions, and somehistorical background is helpful for reading them properly. Even if we can’trecord this background accurately, an approximation—a picture derived fromelements that fit the time and circumstances of the text in question—still mightimprove our understanding of what it says. One might argue that textual historyis relevant to the understanding of texts only to the extent that it can beproven to be historical fact, but it is my contention that even certain storiesabout texts can be of help in reading them.The first of these stages is the well-documented attempt to submit a taipingscripture at the Han dynasty court. Gong Chong 宫崇, who presented it to EmperorShun (r. 125–44), came from Langye. He acknowledged Gan Ji 干吉, an “expert invitality techniques” (fang shi 方士), as his teacher. This is a situation that anyreader of the received text of the TPJ will immediately recognize. In terms ofthe received text, Gan Ji was the “Celestial Master,” whose words were recordedin the TPJ. He sent his disciple, the Perfected Gong Chong, to approach the“virtuous ruler” in Luoyang, who happened to be Emperor Shun, and to personallypresent to him the Celestial Master’s scripture. If we stay within the scenariothat is outlined in the received text, Gan Ji’s scripture would not be the TPJas we have it today, but rather the material that preceded it and that is talkedabout throughout the received text as “the Master’s writings.” This was thematerial the disciples were expected to propagate, and with this in hand theemperor would be able to instigate the reforms that were necessary to save theworld from the approaching apocalypse. The Daoist tradition has followed thehistorical accounts and has heaped glory upon Gan Ji, as can be seen in the taleof his meeting with Laozi.117 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn117] However, as the Hou Hanshu informs us, Gong Chong’s mission did not succeed and, incarcerated inLuoyang, he perished.The source of Gan Ji’s great peace scripture was a school or a movement of somescope and duration. This is clear from the fact that someone else attempted todo what Gong Chong had failed to do. The well-established, erudite Xiang Kai 襄措,also from Langye, presented the scripture in official style in the year 166 C.E.The contrast between the two submissions is striking. Xiang Kai was a mainstreambureaucrat who has been given a biography in the Hou Han shu but not in anyDaoist collection of biographies. On the other hand, Gong Chong’s only mentionin non-Daoist sources is in Xiang Kai’s memorial, while many collections ofDaoist biographies contain the story of his life. We may conclude that betweenthe 140s and 160s, that is, roughly from one generation to the next, the TaipingMovement in Langye had come to attract adherents among the upper strata who wereknown as scholars and had close contact with the central administration. Inaddition, Xiang Kai was able to remind Emperor Huan of his own Daoist interests.The emperor had authorized rituals for the veneration of Laozi at the imperialcourt and at Laozi’s supposed place of birth in Huxian (in today’s Hubei, on theHan River).118 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn118] At this stage, then, Daoist beliefs hadbecome acceptable not just in a specific regional environment, but even in thecapital.119 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn119] When Xiang Kai’s attempt failed, he wasinitially detained at court but was then permitted to return home safely, wherehe remained a public figure of some consequence.120 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn120] Heraised his voice to promote the cause of career officials against what they sawas eunuch upstarts. He was recommended for office at the beginning of the reignof Emperor Ling (r. 168–89), and again in 188 after the defeat of the YellowTurbans, when the eunuchs’ faction had fallen from power. However, in the modeof Zhuangzi, he declined both offers.While the taiping scripture’s next stage is more conjectural, there are goodreasons to believe what we are told in the Hou Han shu by Fan Ye (398–446). Inannotating Xiang Kai’s memorials, Fan Ye mentions that Zhang Jue, leader of theTaiping Movement and of the Yellow Turban Rebellion that resulted from it, knewof Gan Ji’s book.121 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn121] It seems that Fan Ye’s statement,made long after the event, reflected a generally accepted view. Zhang Jue’sshamanistic paraphernalia, his acclaim for Huang-Lao ideas, and the choice ofthe color yellow all helped, as we have seen, to shape the program of the YellowTurbans.122 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn122] There are two further pieces of evidencethat, in my opinion, strengthen the plausibility of Fan Ye’s assertion. Thefirst is the creation of a statelike community toward the end of the secondcentury C.E., which tells us that at that historical stage Daoist ideas hadconsiderable social and political impact. As shown above, the Sichuan Daoists,as if guided by the TPJ’s Celestial Master, based their rule on theestablishment and maintenance of moral norms and regulations that would makepeople healthy, safeguard their livelihood, and help them to live long lives.The second point supporting Fan Ye’s statement is the existence of writtenmaterial that propagated the aims of Zhang Jue’s movement. We are informed thatcertain men of rank in the capital were reading it.123 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn123]We know, therefore, that Zhang Jue and his friends were literate and made use oftexts. Also, the Hou Han shu’s mention of Zhang Jue’s interest in Huang-Laopoints to some extent toward the Laozi-oriented political philosophy we findrepresented in the received text of the TPJ.The next stage involves another mentioning of a text with “great peace” in itstitle. We must remind ourselves that not many ancient and medieval texts weremade public with as much eclat as were texts on great peace. This holds true forboth Gan Ji’s text and a great peace text submitted to Emperor Ai (r. 7–1B.C.E.) before the reign of Wang Mang. After some initial success, theastronomer Li Xun (fl. 17–5 B.C.E.) and other promoters of this early taipingtext fell from grace, but the scripture itself remained in the imperial libraryand continued to be consulted.124 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn124] The text submittedin the second century C.E. by Gong Chong and again by Xiang Kai suffered asimilar fate. This text had the title “Book of Great Peace with the TitleWritten in Blue” (Taiping qing ling shu) and was kept in the imperial libraryafter it had been submitted to Emperor Shun. The text was certainly read by thecourt’s academic specialists, if for no other reason than to criticize it:The officials reported that the work Gong Chong had presented was unorthodox andfalse, outside the canon of the classics; nevertheless, it was received andretained.125 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn125]The breakdown of the dynasty brought a natural end to all official presence ofthe scripture. What this meant for its physical existence we cannot tell. Thenext mention of a scripture on great peace is in the catalogue that Ge Hong(283–343) produced of the books in the library of his teacher Zheng Yin 奠隱.126[Notes.xhtml#intro1fn126] Zheng had, as Ge Hong explains, studied with Ge Xuan,his great-uncle.127 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn127] Ge Hong copied and owned some ofthese works himself, while he only made a note of others. Among them were aTaiping jing 太平經 in 50 juan 巻 and, closely aligned, a Jiayi jing 甲乙經 in 170juan.128 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn128] This is the first mention we find of thetitle Taiping jing. Ge Hong’s Jiayi jing has also been thought to indicate theTPJ, since the received text is divided into ten parts named after the tencelestial stems and into 170 chapters, but this identification remainsconjectural.129 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn129] It is by far the longest “scripture”in Ge Hong’s list of books. Ge Hong says that the scriptures, reports (ji 紀),charts (tu 圖), and talismans (fu 符) he mentions consist for the most part ofjust one juan,130 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn130] so he sees no need to record thenumber of chapters for most of them. He mentions juan numbers for a collectionof talismans in 500 juan, the Jiayi jing, the “Book on the Nourishment of Life”(Yang sheng shu) in 105 juan, the Taiping jing, another collection of talismansin twenty juan, and several titles with ten or fewer juan.This library, which we may assume contained material that was available in theearly third century C.E., originated in the breakdown of the Han dynasty.131[Notes.xhtml#intro1fn131] Judging by the titles, most of the works dealt withspecific techniques, as, for instance, the alchemical work “The EssentialScripture on Yellow and White” (Huangbai yaojing 黃白要經), or “The Scripture onLooking inside Oneself” (Nei shi jing 内視經). The “Scripture on ‘What Is as ItIs’” (Ziran jing 自然經) probably dealt with breathing techniques. “The Scriptureon Pacifying the People” (Xi min jing 息民經) was on a more political topic. Againjudging by their titles, the works came from various sources. There is no reasonwhy the TPJ in its received form should not have been among them.On the other hand, there is not enough evidence to allow us to establish thatthe received TPJ is identical with the taiping text in Ge Hong’s list of books.As the titles on this list are not accompanied by any quotations from orinformation about the respective books, we cannot even draw lines from onemention of a taiping text to another, quite apart from the problem of linkingany of them to the received text. On the other hand, we have no way of excludingthe possibility of a coherent transmission. The Celestial Master of thetransmitted text of the TPJ mentions that his disciples had received texts, thestudy of which was meant to prepare them for meeting with and being instructedby him. This creates the impression that there was a movement, or one might evencall it a school, with a set of texts and organized tuition. These texts werenot the received text of TPJ, in which they are frequently mentioned and perhapsquoted.132 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn132] When pressed to give them a title, theMaster comes up with “Scripture that Pervades All” (Dongji zhi jing 测極之經). Sucha scripture might, as did many others, have had several names, among themTaiping jing. As I see it, we may assume that texts in the lineage of greatpeace beliefs existed before the sixth century, under the titles of Taipingjing, Dongji zhi jing, Jiayi jing, and perhaps even Shen shu,133[Notes.xhtml#intro1fn133] which is how Xiang Kai had referred to the text hesubmitted to Emperor Huan. While it is plausible to link these titles to thereceived text, such a linkage cannot be proven. I find it even more difficult toconnect certain titles with specific layers of the present-day text.134[Notes.xhtml#intro1fn134]The notion of great peace moved closer to the center of Daoist concerns when asection entitled Taiping was added to the religion’s canon of scriptures as oneof four “support” sections. These must be seen as resulting from the activity ofa certain Meng, a contemporary of Emperor Wu of the Liang dynasty (r.502–49).135 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn135] Despite a lack of detail, the argumentthat a taiping text must have been in existence at this stage is valid. We knowlittle of Meng’s work and of the composition of the Daoist canon in the earlysixth century. However, it is unlikely that Meng would have created a Taipingsection had there been no taiping scripture to include in it.136[Notes.xhtml#intro1fn136] The only figure whose interest in such a text has beenrecorded is Chu Boyu 措伯玉, who is said to have died in the year 479, ateighty-six years of age. Daoist sources inform us that he read the TPJ and livedby it.137 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn137] This is corroborated by the Nan Qi shu,which reports that the first emperor of the Qi dynasty set up a taipingmonastery in Chu Boyu’s honor.138 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn138]The next and decisive stage is Huan Kai’s 桓闓”discovery” of the text. He found itin “three lacquered boxes” and showed a sample to Tao Hongjing (456–536), whosaid the material was authentic. However, Huan Kai fell ill and remained illuntil, on Tao Hongjing’s advice, he returned the material to where he had foundit.139 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn139] This is what Daoist sources tell us. The Maoshan zhi account makes Huan a high-ranking disciple of Tao Hongjing.140[Notes.xhtml#intro1fn140]This misadventure of a first publication must be seen as dependent on TaoHongjing’s relationship to the ruling Liang dynasty. He retired from court in492 with imperial permission and on an imperial pension. Important as they werefor the fate of Daoism, his good relations with Emperor Wu were not withouttension. Strickmann aptly points to the contradiction between Buddhist andcertain literati reports of the emperor’s reign that make him something ofChina’s Buddhist ruler comme il faut, and the Sui shu account, which stressesTao Hongjing’s impact on the emperor.141 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn141] The emperor’spromotion of Buddhism and the consequent repression of Daoism from the year 504onward went hand in hand with an increased support for Tao Hongjing and inparticular for his alchemical experiments. However, the imperial interest in TaoHongjing’s activities did not stretch to everything the Daoist deemed important.If we wanted to pick an obvious date for Tao Hongjing’s warnings againstpublicizing a taiping text, it would be the years after his southern expedition.In the year 512, after Tao had reached the Southern Peak and found a place tosettle in its vicinity, the emperor demanded his return to the capital.142[Notes.xhtml#intro1fn142] As a compromise Tao left the south but returned to theMao shan premises instead of following the emperor’s invitation to the capital.The emperor, it must be assumed, was much more interested in his own personalimmortality than in the eschatological beliefs behind Tao’s pilgrimage to thesouth. The disappointment this caused Tao can explain why he felt skepticalabout promoting the taiping text, which for him, as for Huan Kai and, later on,Zhou Zhixiang 周智響, must have been relevant as a document of eschatologicalthought. However, Tao’s skepticism might also have been more general and basedon a certain censorship directed against all Daoist writings. In 517 Taopresented to Emperor Wu his Record of Master Zhou’s Communications with theInvisible World.143 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn143] This edition of the posthumousmanuscripts of his young disciple was the last work Tao Hongjing wrote.Strickmann shows that the publication of Daoist texts came almost to astandstill between 517 and 549.144 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn144] It is possible,therefore, that Huan Kai’s unsuccessful attempt to publicize a taiping text fellinto the first decades of this period (Tao Hongjing died in the year 536). Thesituation changed after 549. The death of Emperor Wu and the Hou Jinginterregnum led to a political breakdown, signified by a rapid succession ofinadequate emperors, which created a certain amount of ideological openness incontrast to Emperor Wu’s strict adherence to what he saw as Buddhist principles.Xiao Gang (503–51), who became Emperor Jianwen under Hou Jing’s command, wrotecommentaries on the Laozi and, more significantly, since this was undertakenless frequently, on the Zhuangzi. He had met Tao Hongjing while governor ofSouthern Xu.145 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn145] The Jinlou zi of Emperor Yuan(508–55), who in 552 succeeded Emperor Jianwen, signified a broad interest inalternative values and also the contempt with which scholars traditionallyregarded career- and wealth-oriented activities. The emperor also conductedreadings of the Laozi.146 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn146] There is no reason tosuggest that during these decades Huan’s work on the taiping manuscripts wasdiscontinued. Clearly, Tao Hongjing’s skepticism applied to the publicationrather than the study of the scripture. Huan’s personal contacts—he had entreeto the ruling house of the Liang dynasty and to Zhou Zhixiang, who finallyrescued the old text147 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn147]—make it plausible to link hiswork to the public interest in great peace that emerged at the end of the Liangand the beginning of the Chen dynasty.At this final stage, the compilers of the text as well as their officialpromoters argued that the text had a long history of creation, transmission,neglect, and failed rediscovery: “When Huan fell ill, Tao said: ‘The doctrine ofGreat Peace should not yet be implemented. You are ill because you obtained itby force.’“148 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn148] In contrast, the time was said to beripe around the year 556, during the change from the Liang to the Chen dynasty.On this occasion, the text emerged as an official enterprise under thesupervision of Zhou Zhixiang. Considering the size of the sixth-century TPJ, itis easy to see that imperial support was useful, not only for propagandisticreasons but also for practical ones. The transport and editing of such a longtext must have been costly. Upon the scripture’s successful completion, theMonastery of Perfect Truth (Zhi zhen guan 至真觀) was set up to promote its study.These activities were aimed at increasing the authority of the Chen dynasty.“Great peace” was in 556 officially declared to be the title of the reignperiod, when Chen Baxian (503–59) had secured his position but had not yetdeclared himself emperor.149 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn149] Historical sources do notventure an explanation for the beginning of the new reign period, but it mighthave signified the elimination of Wang Sengbian (d. 555), Chen Baxian’s mostserious rival. This would mean that from the beginnings of their dynasty theslogan of great peace was closely linked to the Chen rulers.The received text consists of the remains of the sixth-century text. Quotationsconfirm this.150 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn150] Most importantly, a Dunhuang fragment(S 4226) from the first half of the seventh century151 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn151]with a full TPJ table of contents assures us they are one and the same. The newedition was put under the spiritual charge of the Latter Sage of the GoldenGate, who played an important role in sixth-century eschatological speculation.The inclusion of the sage signifies not only the involvement of the Daoistpantheon in taiping concerns, but it also attests to an evolution ofeschatological considerations. In the received text of the TPJ, it is assumedthat the world will soon end since it has been worn down by the evils humankindhas perpetrated. This threat is linked, however, to the promise that thecyclical patterns of heaven will provide an opportunity—the last opportunity—toturn things around and arrive at great peace. This was not the way Tao Hongjingsaw it. He argued that an apocalypse was imminent and unavoidable.152[Notes.xhtml#intro1fn152] Only Daoist believers would then be saved by thedescent of the Latter Sage of the Golden Gate, who would conduct believers to asafe place where they would happily await the arrival of great peace whilehumankind in general would perish.153 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn153] According toYoshioka’s brief overview of the origin and history of the Latter Sage, thisfigure is intimately linked to the Upper Clarity (shangqing 上清) tradition. Thedeity was prominent in the lifetime of Tao Hongjing, or may even have becomeprominent through Tao Hongjing. This must be kept in mind with respect to thetiming of the reissue of the TPJ. Its success and the deity’s prominence bothsignify an interest in eschatological speculation. These were not yet enough infashion at the time of Chu Boyu in the fifth century to have paved the way forthe official acknowledgment and distribution of a taiping scripture.Even a cursory look at the Latter Sage makes it clear that he had different, ifnot contrasting, facets, all of which are relevant to the message of the TPJ.His family name was Li and he was seen as a Laozi incarnation, so that hisperson became intertwined with the figure of Li Hong, whose messianic promiseswere on several occasions adopted by the ambitious leaders of popularmovements.155 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn155] However, Daoist eschatology was put tocontradictory uses.156 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn156] Beyond his rebelliouspotential, the Latter Sage was a figure an emperor could invoke as evidence ofthe imminent arrival of great peace for all under his own reign.THE ORIGIN OF THE TPJThe TPJ as we have it today goes back to the sixth century, a period when theDaoist religion was canonized and systematized. Collecting, editing, andproducing texts was as much a part of religious activity as were millenarianconcerns and the interest in personal longevity. The production and subsequentpromotion of the TPJ suited this environment. The text dealt with the threat ofimminent universal destruction, proposed general political and social reforms inorder to avoid this fate, and reserved an important place for techniques ofmeditation as a means to improve the quality and length of life not only forbelievers but for society as a whole.All this was in accord with sixth-century Daoism. Other aspects of the TPJ weremore problematic. A text entitled Scripture on Great Peace reminded the publicof certain stages in the origin and growth of Daoism that were better leftunremembered. In 184 C.E., the “Way of Great Peace” of the Yellow Turbans had,as shown above, become one link in a chain of events that quickly led to thedownfall of the Han dynasty and in turn to the end of a unified empire. In thesixth century, there was no doubt: the TPJ the Daoists propagated was arediscovered version of the old Han dynasty text.157 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn157]On the one hand, this made the new TPJ one of the oldest texts of the Daoisttradition. On the other hand, it was accompanied by a touch of insurrection anddisorder. However, the scripture was successfully promoted, what it said wasaccepted, and it was successfully transmitted. This in itself was, one couldargue, a sign of Daoist strength. The position of Daoists at court andthroughout society was so well established that they had little to fear from apublic remembrance of their origins.158 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn158]When we turn to the sixth-century editors for advice on the text’s origins, weare referred back to the second century and the figure of Gan Ji, of whosehistorical existence there is but little evidence.159 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn159]Early quotations and other references do not exist, so our main source foridentifying the text’s origin can only be the text itself. Much of what it saysand how it is said remind us of the movements described above. It resembles atext from the Later Han dynasty. Its worldview stresses heaven’s patterns and asystem of correlated entities, among them Yin and Yang. It attributes thedominant role to the phase of fire and the color red, which means that it wasmeant for publication in a world reigned by Han dynasty rulers; only rebelliousmovements would promote yellow or black. To the extent to which anadministrative system is hinted at, it could be that of the Han. The main pointhere is that the text appears to lack elements that would necessitateattributing it to a later date, such as loans from Buddhist writings, and itseems to reflect a rather elementary stage of Daoist beliefs. The text mentionsvirtually no historical figures, events, or places, with the exception of theKunlun range, the Yellow River, the Luo, Luoyang,160 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn160]and perhaps Chang’an.While we do not know the author or authors, the text contains some informationon the background of its main speaker, its fictitious authors, and theirintended audience. The TPJ authors refrain almost completely from all directreference to written sources, except for works distributed within their owncircle. They refer to the historical past only in the most general terms, notpresuming that their readers have any specific knowledge of China’s great texts.The authors show no personal interest in achieving an official career and do notassume such an interest of their audience. While they wish to serve a ruler andhis people, they see the need to enter into such a relationship from theoutside, as heaven-sent advisors with a unique message. Moreover, much of thetext is written in a language that differs from standard written Chinese. To usesuch language and to identify with what was written in such language was todistance oneself from the world of erudition and learning. The text shows anunusual concern for the people, as opposed to the ruler and officials, and, itshould be noted, a certain knowledge of the people’s plight. This does not meanthat the TPJ is “revolutionary,” but it does suggest that its authors were notestablished members of the social and cultural elite. Also, when the authorsdiscuss administrative policies they refer primarily to fairly small units andnot to the empire as a whole. Reforms, it seems, must start at a local levelbefore they can reach the wider world.This does not mean that the Celestial Master, who acts as the main speakerthroughout much of the text, is ignorant of mainstream culture. He has access tothe literary tradition161 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn161] and is fully aware of issuesthat dominate it. How those ruling and those ruled should coexist, how theindividual is expected to juggle his—and, in the case of the TPJ, alsoher—conflicting responsibilities, how to find a proper hierarchical order formoral values and norms, what to make of heaven and its dominance, how to explainnatural disasters, and how to make sense of historical change: these were forhim the relevant topics. He takes a stand on all these points, and time-honoredpositions on political and moral thinking reappear in what he says. Herecommends the reduction of government, stresses individual moralresponsibility, sees disasters as heaven’s response to human transgressions, andproposes that we live and rule in accordance with cosmic, that is, heaven’s,order.We might deduce from this that the Master was an erudite thinker who had chosento popularize the concerns of Han dynasty moral and political thought and givethem a large audience, but that is not the case. He presents himself as thefounder of a religion. He propagates belief in the way of heaven and promiseshumankind salvation once they ascribe to this belief. He deals with theexistential fears and concerns of which we are aware from imagery in poetry andthe visual arts162 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn162] but that the philosophicalliterature of the period did not fully appreciate. The Master knows how tocontrol the spirits, who might cause illness and shorten life, and how to ensurean afterlife without trouble.In other parts of the text the illustrious, otherworldly figure of a CelestialLord and his staff instruct readers on how to deal with the celestialbureaucracy. Throughout the TPJ, the people’s well-being depends on spiritualsupport. While there are ways to influence these spirits—such as throughmeditation and a quiet style of life—they are in the first instance heaven’sobedient servants. Man’s main concern, then, must be his own relationship toheaven. The Celestial Lord promises salvation, as does the Celestial Master.Judging by the questions raised by the Celestial Lord’s disciple, health,longevity, and the final ascendancy to heaven result from “right” conduct, thatis, from fulfilling certain clearly defined commandments and from demonstratingthe general virtues of piety, loyalty, and sincerity.163[Notes.xhtml#intro1fn163]Early religious Daoism encompassed different groups of people. Within its rankswere certainly educated, well-positioned individuals. While their lifestyles andideas were oriented toward the values expressed in texts like the Laozi and theZhuangzi, they were not necessarily active participants in any religiousmovement. Xiang Kai, the second-century promoter of a great peace scripture, isa prominent example of this. The religion, however, also attracted the “masses.”Their leaders, usually literate and with some formal education, createdreligious congregations and, when successful, as Zhang Lu was, created statelikecommunities that promised a better life for all through social reform, Sincethis was the TPJ’s main topic, it is tempting to see its origins in thesegroups.164 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn164] That there is not a more obviousresemblance between the doctrines of the TPJ and the ideas promoted by theDaoist movements must be because of a certain material disproportion between along scripture and isolated bits of information. Even if district and provincialofficials had been more forthcoming in their reports on these movements wecannot expect that the ancient historians, court officials that they were, wouldtell us much about the beliefs held by groups of discontented, if notrebellious, peasants.Vague as all this is, we can still conclude that such a social environment was apossible birthplace for a text like the TPJ. Moreover, it seems almostimpossible to imagine any other background for this text. It expresses aworldview that encompasses much of the Han dynasty discourse, expresseseschatological concerns, and is pre-Buddhist. It is tempting to say that it isalso pre-Daoist. The Celestial Master’s authority is heaven, for instance,rather than dao. This represents, we might argue, one of the points of departureof this religion.Another point worth mentioning is the text’s apparent lack of literary ambitionand sophistication, evident in its use of language, its verbosity, and itsrepetitive- ness. This does not mean the authors disregarded the rhetoricaleffect of their work and the need to please, impress, and persuade theirreaders. However, their means of doing so differed radically from those ofestablished modes of literary production. Therefore, there are reasons tobelieve that the text was produced not only by men who did not share the elite’sliterary taste and interests, but also in a mode that was unusual. It isreasonable to assume that the rather complex scenario of an interchange ofopinions between the Master and his disciples depicts a situation in which theauthors actually participated. To have created it for the sake of increasing theplausibility and persuasiveness of the Master’s message seems too much of aliterary effort. Thus, what the received text tells us may be taken at facevalue: a charismatic figure who is addressed as Celestial Master tells hisaudience that he has been sent by heaven to instruct disciples so that they canapproach the political rulers of the day, make them believe in heaven, andreform their policies. Conversations between the Master and his disciples andthe Master’s lectures form the main content of the TPJ.The word shi 師, meaning “master” or “teacher,” is the phonetic equivalent of shi使, or “messenger.” The title “Messenger Sent from Heaven” occurs frequently insecond-century C.E. archaeological materials and in historical sources dealingwith this period.165 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn165] Several rebel leaders chose thattitle, among them Zhang Bolu and his followers.166 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn166]However, Zhang Jue, the Yellow Turban commander, used “master,” as did theinitiators of the Celestial Master movement in Sichuan. Although the TPJ’sCelestial Master was certainly not alone in the claim that heaven had chosen andauthorized him, we are told more about him than about any other “master.”Pressed by curious disciples, he explains that at one stage he followed othermasters and thus had some schooling. However, he was disappointed in the resultsand thus came to regard heaven as his true teacher. He had taught otherdisciples before those depicted in the TPJ, but with little success, since theirmotivation had been insufficient. He is a transcendent, with a place in theworld beyond, and will soon leave the human realm behind. He has received booksfrom heaven and has personally written texts. He reads books. He is, forinstance, aware of the He tu, the Luo shu, and other prognostic material.167[Notes.xhtml#intro1fn167] None of this contradicts the little we know of thehistorical or semihistorical figures who assumed the title of “master,” and itagrees with the sagas woven around them. The hagiographic account of ZhangDaoling, for instance, the supposed founder of the Sichuan Celestial Mastermovement, has much in common with the picture the TPJ’s Celestial Master drawsof himself.The Master’s disciples remain similarly anonymous. They are not beginners, butrather hold the rank of Perfected. They are literate, and they have read all thematerial the Master has written or recommended. Their ages and backgrounds arenot known. However, we must expect them to have families and to be men. Theyaccept the obligation to continue the missionary work the Master, or rather, asthey would claim, heaven, demands of them.The TPJ describes in detail how the Master instructs his disciples. They meet,the disciples extend some polite greeting and ask questions, and the Masterresponds with a fairly long explanation. At this point, he often remindsdisciples to take notes. This advice is repeated at certain intervals, as if tostructure the lecture, and the disciples accept this task.All this I take as an accurate picture of how much of the TPJ originated; itconsists of the notes taken by devoted students who were instructed by anindividual who called himself “heaven-sent teacher.” A closer look at the formof the text will reveal more details and corroborate this thesis.LANGUAGE AND STYLEMuch of the text looks as if it consists of transcriptions. If we assume thatdisciples jotted down the questions they raised along with the Master’s answersand admonitions in response, we can explain certain formal characteristics ofthe text. The first of these characteristics is its use of language, and inparticular the choice of characters. The words used are generally long. Thereare three-character nouns, and verbal predicates often consist of twocharacters, with the addition of a verbal modifier and a verbal complement. Thetext is verbose, and without the refinement associated with “elegant” medievalprose.168 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn168] The text’s verbosity is apparent when it iscompared to its Tang dynasty digest, the Chao, which eliminates the thirdcharacter in clusters, as well as verbal complements and particles.169[Notes.xhtml#intro1fn169] The distance between the language of much of the TPJand the way esteemed Han dynasty writers expressed themselves suggests that theTPJ reflected the way people spoke and that what we call nonstandard elementsare in fact traces of colloquial language use.170 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn170] Inthis regard, the TPJ resembles early Chinese Buddhist scriptures.171[Notes.xhtml#intro1fn171] Eric Zuercher has studied this material in somedetail.172 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn172] He sees the nonstandard language insecond-century Chinese translations of Buddhist texts as deriving from thespoken language of that period. This language was perpetuated in the Buddhisttradition parallel to the way in which wenyan, the language used in classicalscriptures, developed as a constant feature that was largely independent of thespoken language. Since the TPJ had virtually no impact on the Daoist scripturaltradition, its language did not play this role. It did not initiate aspecifically Daoist style of expression.The TPJ, and in particular the dialogues between the Celestial Master and hisdisciples, shares a number of characteristics with the material studied byZuercher. Words are frequently not monosyllabic.173 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn173]However, this is also a token of the changing language use of the Later Handynasty; it occurs not only in early Buddhist translations, but also in WangChong’s first-century C.E. Lun heng.174 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn174] The order ofcharacters in compounds is to some extent reversible,175[Notes.xhtml#intro1fn175] and single characters and compounds can beinterchanged without any noticeable difference.176 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn176]Adverbial compounds are not as frequent in the TPJ as in the translations, butthey exist, particularly for fu 復 and gong 共.177 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn177] Wordclasses can probably be called “clearly defined,” as Zuercher put it with regardto his material. But there are exceptions. While words, particularly when theyare compounds, are commonly used as either noun or verb or adverb, there areisolated cases of uncommon usage, such as the use of ping 病 in the meaning of“to make [them] ill” and zai 災 as “to send [them] disasters” with a directobject.178 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn178] This is similar to Zuercher’s findings. Inother respects, the TPJ uses language differently from how it is used in theBuddhist material and is much closer to classical language usage. It does notmark the plural and there is no hint of shi 是 functioning as copula.179[Notes.xhtml#intro1fn179] Despite such differences it may be safely assumed thatthe TPJ’s elements of nonstandard language stem from the language spoken at thetime and the place of its origin, just as Zuercher has argued for the earlyBuddhist translations. For the Buddhist material this was what Zuercher calledthe “metropolitan area,” but we have no reason to suppose that this is where thetaiping material came from. The saga of its origin points to the region ofLangye and to the early second century, about a generation or even twogenerations earlier than Zuercher’s material, which he sees as stretching from150 to 220 C.E. There are therefore good reasons for the difference between thetwo forms of language use. Zuercher adds the important caveat that the languageof the early Buddhist translations was not the language the translators spoke,but was rather written language modified by the spoken. To a small degree thisalso holds true for the TPJ, which consists not of everyday conversations but ofdialogues of instruction. Still, the text’s verbosity and the use ofthree-character compounds give the appearance of directly recorded spokenlanguage.The primary evidence for the text originating in transcripts, however, is notits use of language but its composition, which in almost all respects runscounter to the general rules and constraints of writing as they can be deducedfrom other ancient and medieval texts. Moreover, it has almost nothing in commonwith other texts based on, or written as if they were based on, spokencommunication.180 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn180] Those texts were carefully edited,while the TPJ material was not. We must assume that this material was notsubmitted to any responsible authorial impact; at least we can state withcertainty that it looks as if it consists of transcripts in raw, uneditedformat. We must keep in mind that the entire TPJ comes from an environment inwhich men followed novel rules in regard to their beliefs, their lifestyle, andalso the writing and collation of texts. So, the question of whether thetranscriptlike quality of much of the TPJ is the result of editorial intent orwhether it represents the text’s real origin is difficult to answer. Based uponmy reading of the TPJ, I prefer to see the Celestial Master dialogues as thework of a number of disciples who did their best to jot down what they heard.Although no definitive evidence can be produced to support this view, thisthesis still seems to be the only way to explain the stylistic characteristicsof most of the text.To see the dialogues as transcripts produced by different students provides agood explanation for certain stylistic divergences between sections. Individualsections make repeated use of specific expressions that occur hardly anywhereelse in the text. The following are examples from the sections translated here.Section 50 uses the expression “to walk this way” (xing ci dao 行此道) for a way ofdoing things; in section 54 to be keen for knowledge is compared with the thirstfor water; section 58 uses daolu 道路 for “the right way”; section 60 uses raorao擾擾 for the confusion and moral laxity of this world; and section 64 continuallytalks about change in human activities and in nature as “advance and retreat”(jin tui 進退).181 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn181]Given the TPJ’s purpose of creating a missionary movement and attracting generalinterest, too much space is taken up by irrelevant conversational passages, suchas greetings, polite remarks about the wish for and need to enter into adiscussion, repeated admonitions to the disciples to pay attention, and finallytheir discharge at the end. All of this detracts from the text’s readability andargumentation. It reduces the amount of space available for explaining andsupporting certain novel ideas. The Celestial Master’s message is thereforehidden beneath a large amount of what one is tempted to call small talk.Although its rhetoric is at times persuasive, the TPJ is too long and toorepetitive not to antagonize interested readers.The way each section is composed adds to the impression that only a realmeeting, an actual interchange of words, could have been its motive force. Thisis pointed out in some detail in the notes that accompany this translation.Section 60, for instance, contains accounts of two meetings. Both deal with thesame subject, that is, with the isolation that is experienced by a person whoprefers harsh and severe methods, and both give the disciple a chance to enterthe discussion with a defense of severity. The section thus is rife withredundancy. From a literary point of view, it is about three times longer thanit should be. The random change of topic in section 41 serves as anotherexample. The second half of this section deals with the fate and social functionof women, a quite different topic from that in the first half, which is howpoverty results from political mismanagement. Both parts, however, are linked byconversational elements, as if their sequence resulted from the free flow of aninformal teaching session. The meandering course of section 61, which is movedalong only by the disciple’s questions, is another case in point.A characteristic element of the dialogues between the Celestial Master and hisdisciples is the continuous creation of the complete message. This offendsprinciples of literary composition as well as of argumentation. Almost everymeeting serves as an occasion for voicing certain basic statements: heaven hassent the Master to teach and the disciples to learn; heaven will send forthgreat peace; humankind must be prepared for its reception; heaven makes its willknown through the Master’s texts; the disciples must approach a virtuous rulerdirectly or indirectly with these texts in hand and let him instigate thenecessary reforms. The repetition of these points attests to the independence ofeach section. They were not written as part of a coherent text, but rather eachwas a small element in an ongoing project of building a missionary movement, andtheir certain argumentative stubbornness might be said to equal propagandistintensity. The sequential chapters or sections resemble Sunday sermons, whichcontinue to reproduce a narrow set of beliefs, rather than academic lectures.The unmodified written account of these sermons runs counter to the economicaluse of language.The autonomy of the sections is enhanced by the fact that contrasting aspects ofsome basic issues are stressed in different sections, in accordance withspecific needs of the argument. The sections have their own individualargumentation, as one would expect from a good lecture or sermon. So section 42observes that Yin is represented by the figure “two” and argues against femaleinfanticide, citing the fact that each man should have two wives, while section44 states that Yin is “one,” just as Yang is, and that only through the two ofthem is a third created. In section 62, the Master demands that the truescripture must be kept secret and shown only to the right person. His aim hereis to make the scripture seem precious. Throughout most of the text, however,the disciples are urged to make the scripture public, as soon and as widely aspossible. In general, the Master stresses that three are needed to create thingsand keep them going. He thus takes the family or the state, which is createdthrough the cooperation of people, officials, and ruler, as his model. However,he also offers a dualistic approach, as if the Yin and the Yang of the naturalworld were enough to safeguard creation and continued existence.182[Notes.xhtml#intro1fn182]The argumentative role of the disciple is another case in point. Certain issuesare raised only because the disciple instigates discussion of them, as forexample toward the end of section 43, where he raises the important question ofwhy heaven wants men to know what to expect. The figure of the disciple iscrucial for the text’s literary quality and argumentation, limited as both mightbe. He remains nameless but comes to life almost as vividly as the disciples ofthe Lun yu. All he says shows him to be eager and well intentioned, but at thesame time of mediocre abilities and slow to understand. The reader can beexpected to feel some sympathy for the disciple’s intellectual misadventures. Itcan be argued that the invention of such a figure is in contrast with theotherwise poor literary quality of the text.In its combination of argumentation and persuasive modes, the text is as uniquestylistically as it is original and unusual. The amount of dialogue variesthroughout the text and is greater in its earlier parts. Additions to taipingmaterial from other sources have also been written in this style. This isobvious from the fact that the first section of the Chao, which is an account ofthe Latter Sage of the Golden Gate and was clearly written later than the bulkof the TPJ, contains a number of elements that are characteristic of thedialogues between the Celestial Master and his disciples.183[Notes.xhtml#intro1fn183] Another point that suggests the plausibility that thetext was not the explicit labor of an author or a group of authors—and, from myreading, an important point—is its argumentation and stylistic quality. The textcommunicates certain original and relevant ideas, presented in a quite novel andpopulist manner. However, when we consider the length of the text in relation towhat it says, it can seem longwinded and carelessly constructed. This impressionis reinforced by the fact that the selective mechanisms of cultural, scholarly,and religious traditions have permitted few, if any, ancient texts of this sortto reach us. This enhances the value of the TPJ as we have it today. It gives usa unique glimpse into the way ideas were expressed in late antiquity and howthey were promoted by and among men outside established intellectual circles.THE SCRIPTURE’S MESSAGE OF SALVATIONThe received text of the TPJ is stylistically quite coherent when we considerits length, its origin, and its history. Most of it is written in oneidentifiable style. This, we might add, is in line with the surprising coherenceof the text’s message. We must assume that it had a powerful religious andintellectual impetus, as it filled the better part of 366 sections with threatsof damnation, demands for imminent conversion, and the promise of the arrival ofgreat peace. While this may be seen as a religious, if not an escapist, reactionto a world in trouble, I also see it as an attempt to reread the entire Handynasty discourse from the perspective of providing salvation to a world ingreat disorder. Original as the taiping doctrine might be, it is built throughslow and persistent reasoning on a foundation of generally accepted knowledgeabout nature and society.One might argue that the size of the scripture is not accidental. To reread anestablished culture of the size, depth, and vitality of Han period China is initself a formidable project. It was probably necessary to be an outsider to dothis, but this fact made the project even more daunting because outsiders werenot skilled in the techniques through which this culture took form. Also, theproject was directed, at least in part, to outsiders, which meant that itsargumentation and representation had to be geared to their backgrounds andinterests.The size of the scripture can also be seen as related to the movement ormovements from which it stemmed. Its size reflects the success of second-centurymillenarian movements. This was a period of energetic and ongoing missionarywork. The disciples’ eagerness and the Master’s threats and promises were real.Men did meet to discuss these matters, and they saw the need, so wellestablished in all other aspects of their life, to spread their insights bywriting them down. The TPJ reflects their numbers and their zeal.The scripture tells us what a world in peace will be like and identifies themany changes that will have to precede and accompany this peace. The twostages—the initial movement toward great peace and its consequent arrival andreign over the world—are not always clearly separated. Elements of what theperfect world will be like can already be perceived while the process of reformis under way. In any case, the authors of the text seem to assume that everyoneknows what great peace entails and for this reason concentrate on telling theirreaders how to get there. There remains a certain vagueness about the aim, as ifto allow for the fact that a ruler’s wishes and fears might differ from those ofhis subjects, and that the expectations of a religious professional might differfrom those of lay believers. But while much about the state of great peaceremains undefined, the preparatory program through which it is to become areality contains precise prescriptions that outline radical social reform.The following brief account of this program selects points of interest. The TPJis long and its different sections have different argumentative goals. Somesections propose a novel approach to certain issues that are depicted in a moreconservative manner in other sections. However, this does not reduce therelevance of the text’s new ideas. The fact that confrontational and radicalpoints of view are embedded in standard observations and values adds realism andpracticality to the program. The authors of the scripture do not create a newworld ex nihilo; they create it from and between the structures of the worldtheir readers know. For us, the context of late Han dynasty values andbehavioral guidelines is not clearly defined, and what the TPJ says cancontribute to our knowledge of this context. Also, certain ideas are set forththat are not found elsewhere. That this is not accidental is confirmed by thefact that the TPJ’s Celestial Master introduces these ideas as if they werenovel and that his disciples react to them with hesitation and surprise. Theamount of novelty, striking as it is, must, however, be seen in relation to theintellectual dynamism of early medieval China. The TPJ’s unique textualtradition happens to make these ideas available, but they stem from a specifichistorical environment of social and philosophical concerns. We must assume thatthe ideas set forth in the TPJ are a token rather than a full representation ofthe fertility of this environment.The program is meant to advise political leaders on how to prepare the world forgreat peace. In this reform process, men in power become heaven’s tools. Theymust therefore decipher its will, which for the authors of the TPJ means attendto the Celestial Master’s message as conveyed in his texts and spread by hisdisciples, practice ritual meditation, and closely observe and analyzeastronomical phenomena. The heaven of the TPJ is somewhat closer to men than itis in the great books of China’s ancient tradition. Its omniscience pertains toall individual concerns. Once a man believes in heaven there will be a solutionto his problems, in this world and also after death. In this respect the tworealms are not seen as being in conflict. Someone who serves heaven while alivecan hope to have a reasonably good life for as long as it lasts and to avoidharassment after he has died. If he is lucky, he might even enter the celestialbureaucracy. Conversely, the man who does not serve heaven will die from illnesswhen young and have a hard time in the world below.Central to the image of heaven as well as to that of earth, which is its partnerand supporter, is their power to give and maintain life, as is evident in theharvests men reap due to heaven’s bounty. Of course, heaven is also the sourceof order, regularity, constancy, and reliability, and all these qualities shouldbe understood and imitated by men in their own endeavors, but they are all minorvirtues and concerns that need to be activated in the service of the protectionof life, which is the main concern.A ruler’s most important concern, therefore, must be for men’s livelihood. It isasking too much of individuals or families to leave them to fight forthemselves. It is the ruler’s responsibility to provide for their basic needs.He must look to the supply of food, enable his subjects to support a family andraise children, and also find clothes for them so they can go about theiractivities in decency and be protected against the cold. Social groups ofspecial concern are the fools, the aged, and the infirm.184[Notes.xhtml#intro1fn184]As far as food goes, the ruler is to look after the distribution of grain andprevent hoarding. He is also to make sure that everyone helps in the productionof food. But, most importantly, through his personal relations with heaven he isto ensure that harvests are sufficient and are not damaged by irregular weatherconditions or natural disasters like droughts, floods, and hornets.Procreation is a human and a cosmic need. It closely reflects the interest inlife that runs through the whole reform program. Sexual relations and the birthof children make people happy and help them to re-create in their own sphereheaven’s creative energy. Since sexual life is seen as central to men’swell-being, the role of women is redefined. The main point is that unless thereare sufficient women avail- able, not every man can marry, and, ideally, eachman should have two wives, just like a master has two servants, one to his rightand the other to his left. In order to achieve this ratio, female infanticidemust come to an end. This can be expected to happen naturally—no parent likeskilling a child—when girls are put in a position where they are of use to theirparents. At present, it costs money to raise girls, but they offer no return. Itis suggested that the services a woman performs for her husband should enableher to support her own aged parents, just as sons do after they have married.Parents would then have no reason not to bring up daughters.The role of women reflects that of earth, and maltreatment must be avoided inboth cases for reasons of procreation and fertility. If Yin is not respectedthere will be neither children nor harvests. This means that one must not digthe earth up at random, a demand that is combined with other environmentaldictates, such as the prohibition against clearing hills by fire.The program is addressed to the ruler and his advisors. It proposes radicalreforms, including a greater social responsibility for the people as a whole.Great peace will arrive only when the ruler can make the people change theirattitudes. This assigns a central role to communication between differentpolitical and social strata.185 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn185] Government and peoplecommunicate by way of writing; although there is room for an initial oral flowof news, information and instruction is seen as being spread by writing. This isstressed in the TPJ when the Celestial Master admonishes students not only tolisten attentively, but also to take careful notes. The success of the reformprogram is therefore seen as depending on the efficiency of the written word andthe proper handling of texts. Once entrusted with scriptures that have beencirculated or created by the Celestial Master and his disciples, a ruler is tohave his literary specialists edit them and publish them. Properly skilled andguided, these specialists will also produce florilegia of other writings, olderas well as contemporary. This material will then be distributed and men willread, recite, and meditate upon it. The message that is thus conveyed documentsits trustworthiness by being unambiguous and easy to comprehend. As soon as menunderstand its meaning they will realize the consequences of their currentmisbehavior and they will change. They will, for instance, allow their daughtersto live, and they will treat the earth with respect.The relationship between the people and their government is dynamic. Each isexpected to make the other’s existence possible. The reforms that prepare forgreat peace involve so many items of everyday personal life that theirimplementation seems to presuppose a community of believers. Whileadministrative success depends on the people’s belief, the people see the organsof government as an institution that reads, interprets, and conveys heaven’swill. At this point, the people’s contribution is again critical. Governmentpolicy must rely on the people’s observations in that it relies on the peoplefor reading heaven’s will. The people must keep track of all irregularities inthe course of nature so that heaven’s feelings can be properly analyzed. Muchattention is paid to the methods by which the people can make their observationsknown at the higher levels of government. Competition and struggle betweendifferent administrative layers and a strong tendency to intercept the flow ofinformation from one layer to the other seem to be taken for granted. Soindividuals must not only be willing to do the right thing by informing theirsuperiors, but they must also be clever enough to succeed in doing so. Thispoint is symptomatic of much of the reform program. The TPJ authors depictsociety, whether of the present world or of the future world of great peace, asa community. The community is structured hierarchically, but it functionsthrough cooperation rather than through a system involving random commands andblind obedience.Readers will protest at this point that much of what is set forth here iswell-known, and that there is nothing in this particular account of the properrelationship between ruler and people that has not been said or at least hintedat in the great texts of pre-Qin and Han times. Nevertheless, it is proposedhere in new words, and problems are isolated and identified. While this bringsinto focus the need for active cooperation, it also problematizes it, thuscreating a realistic platform for political reform. The people are expected tocooperate, with their own personal interests in mind. Their relationship withheaven is direct and personal. Although they can rely on their betters to knowthe details of heaven’s will, persuasion alone will bring them to conform to it.This sets a new task for the ruler and his advisors. It is not—or at least notonly—the example they set and the educational activities they instigate that hasan impact on the people. People cannot be expected to cooperate simply becausethey respect their ruler and his virtue. What the government must bring about isbetter described as conversion than education. The people must understand thatit is heaven’s good will that dictates their fortune, that is, life, health,progeny, and sufficient means. Moreover, death does not end it all. Misbehaviorin this world will also ruin one’s fate in the netherworld.The demand that correct information be spread and that the texts conveying whatis true be made known is juxtaposed with strong warnings against producing andpublicizing texts that do not conform to heaven’s will. It is crucial that notjust men in responsible positions but everyone be able to distinguish betweenthese two sets of material. It is not easy to make the distinction, but thereare a few clear criteria. Texts that criticize heaven and the government of theday are certainly wrong, as is material that encourages the application ofpenalties and that is not clear and lucid. The heterodoxy that must be opposedseems to be widespread and often remains unspecified. However, when there arespecific accusations they are mainly directed against certain second-centurypolitical thought.186 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn186]We can only infer indirectly whom the TPJ means when it talks of “people.”Clearly, responsibility for the arrival of great peace and thus for renewal andchange lies with them. This shows that their social and political role is newlydefined. They are seen as including a relatively wide range of groups. While theauthors draw images from the cultivation of the soil and from craftsmanship,activities that would always be identified with “the people,” they also mentionthat there are low-ranking officials, sedentary people, and itinerants, and thatindividuals from all three groups are, within their group’s parameters, subjectto the ruler as well as to heaven. Each individual is expected to assist andsupport both, which in the case of heaven is often phrased as the need tosupport the spirits in their course of action. Since many of these spiritsreside in a person they can easily and directly be appeased by a life of quietcontentment and friendly concern for others. That issues are linked to eachother by correlation is a well-known fixture of Han dynasty thought. However,the TPJ’s Celestial Master tends to stress dependencies that are otherwiseignored. Of course, a virtuous ruler will promote virtue in those who depend onhim. His entourage will try to imitate him and things will improve. But avirtuous subject can do the same: when their subordinates do the right thing,the men in charge will improve their behavior. So the way in which individualsconduct their lives is crucial. This does not abolish social hierarchy, butrather reduces its force. From a cosmic and a celestial perspective the rightand wrong of each individual, independent of their rank, are of similarimportance.Good health can be seen as proof of a proper lifestyle. On an individual levelthe link between the two might not be directly manifest, but in principle itexists. The man or woman who pays attention to heaven’s commandments will notfall ill, while someone who neglects heaven might pay for it with his life.While one’s date of birth has an impact,187 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn187] what isstressed here is personal responsibility as opposed to the material conditionsof life, which to a large extent result from proper governance. A person mustlook after his or her own essence. While this means following heaven’scommandments, it also involves dietary rules, meditation, and quietude.Longevity is also central to social relations. To be kind to others means toprolong their life, by making them happy as well as by procuring for them propermedical treatment.An important element of personal as well as public life is the avoidance ofresentment. Individuals must be careful not to become resentful, and men in aleading position must make sure that their subordinates are satisfied. Whatevercauses men to bear a grudge must be avoided. That is why it is important thatpeople do not adhere to wrong ideas. If not taught properly they might, forinstance, see heaven as being responsible for their sufferings, or they mightblame the government of the day for bringing misery upon them. People must learnto consider that today’s rulers have inherited the wrongdoings of theirpredecessors and that change must not be expected to come about all of a sudden.Even well-intended and well-informed rulers need time to counteract the mistakesof the past and allow the program of great peace to proceed. On the other hand,officials and their apparatus must not cause resentment among the people bydisregarding their plight or imprisoning the innocent. The need to avoidresentment also plays a role in the prohibition of infanticide, a cruelty thatall women resent and that for this reason alone is bound to create cosmicupheaval. The prevention of resentment is also behind a fastidious process ofselecting and supervising officials and clerks. Superiors must make sure theyassign their subordinates to jobs they are well able to handle, lest they becomedesperate. Moreover, whistle-blowers must be protected. If they are not, theirresentment will in the future obstruct the flow of information.Prescriptions in the TPJ for the conduct of life cover a broad spectrum. Theyinclude general demands, such as the need to stress what is of “communal”interest instead of concentrating on private gain, and the need to take one’sown person, or rather the process of self-cultivation, seriously. Morespecifically, the problem of alcohol consumption is addressed: it can do damageto family life and must be constrained. Dietary issues are also of relevance: toeat little and to attempt to live on the consumption of nothing but qi (vapor)will improve health and longevity. Meditation is essential for staying healthyas well as for becoming wise. Followers of great peace are always part of afamily and can become full-time devotees, that is, disciples of the CelestialMaster, for instance, only after the children have grown up. There is also theneed to look after, and in particular to prolong the lives of, one’s agedparents. On the other hand, once those parents are dead one must make sure thatfuneral and ancestral sacrifices are kept simple.188 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn188]This shows that the salvation envisaged by the authors of the TPJ does notentail an extravagant way of life or one that is difficult to sustain. Men areexpected to participate in the taiping salvation project by remaining withintheir social and intellectual boundaries.At this point the grand reform project ebbs into outlining the conditions forindividual salvation. The border between these two projects is at pointsidentical with the distinction between textual layers, but there is muchoverlap.189 [Notes.xhtml#intro1fn189] We could say that the TPJ is traditionalenough to avoid all hints at possible contradictions between society and theindividual. It has advice for individuals whom society has forsaken, but thereis no question that an individual’s attempts to live and to live for a long timeare in the interest of society at large. A complex and time-honored network oflinkages is set up between the two. The individual might want to establish goodpersonal relations with the celestial bureaucracy in order to strengthen hisclaim to a place in heaven and ensure his name is listed in the registers oflife, but he must also lead a life of kindness and benevolence in order to livelong and become a transcendent. His life expectancy depends on promoting thelife of others, and the practice of meditation serves his own health as well aswider social aims. On the other hand, wide-ranging social reforms are set up andpropagated as if they were the basis for individual well-being. All of thisconnects the TPJ to classical moral and political philosophy. The authors of thescripture have adapted it to the complex and dynamic social environment of whichthey were a part."},{"pageContent":"SECTION 41HOW TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN POOR AND RICHThis section is one of the most practice-oriented in the text.1[Notes.xhtml#ch1fn1] It consists of two parts, one analyzing relations ofproperty and the other the lot of women. The first is too short to be a separatesection of its own, and there is no other material in the received text to whichit could belong. The second part is linked closely to the following section,section 42, an indication that here, at least, the sequence of sections is nothaphazard.The first half of the section discusses the stages of wealth and poverty and howthey are achieved. I have found no parallel in Han dynasty or earlier materialof these different stages. Rhetorical as this account might be, the enumerationof the different types of poverty stresses the severity of social conditions andthe prevalence of misery. Poverty is depicted as an element of the apocalypticscenario. Its rapid increase is supposed to persuade men that there is an urgentneed to change their ways. An almost theological need to tie different levels ofbeing into one unified structure induces the Master to juxtapose men’s povertywith that of the earth. However, heaven’s position is too exalted to allow theidea of celestial poverty.Once the Master has defined the stages of poverty and environmental destruction,as we might understand the expression “earth’s poverty,” he moves toward ananalysis of what causes them. He points out that the plight of individualfamilies stems from outside factors. Both poverty and wealth have a cosmicdimension. Since men are children of heaven and earth, they thrive only whentheir parents thrive. Thus an individual and his family cannot prosper in acommunity that is in misery. Even the royal house is not exempt from this nexus.Individual wealth is said to be a fake; only a self-sufficient community can becalled wealthy. In line with the Laozi’s image of ideal communal life, wealth isseen as created exclusively by agricultural production. The possession ofvaluables becomes relevant only when basic necessities are in short supply.The prevention of poverty and the achievement of wealth, then, are the samething, and both are said to result from proper political action. Here the Masterassembles lines of thought common in quietist political philosophy, for instancein the Huainan zi.2 [Notes.xhtml#ch1fn2] Impoverishment is the result of poorpolitics. It came into being when dao was replaced by wen (culture) and bymilitary rule. The Master does not seriously pursue these thoughts, referring tothem only in passing before he arrives at his own message: a community will bewealthy when its government takes the triad of heaven, earth, and men intoproper account. The government must establish a direct relationship between theagricultural producer and the cosmic, natural sources of fertility and growth.This precludes other, more prominent, ancient approaches to the problem: neitherindividual industriousness nor proper economic policy will create wealth.3[Notes.xhtml#ch1fn3]The second half of the section is possibly premodern China’s most outspokenattack on female infanticide. The argument is characteristic of the way theCelestial Master sets forth his doctrine. He argues on cosmic rather than onmoral grounds. The main evil in infanticide is the distress and resentment itprovokes in females. Their protests reach heaven and earth, which react bycausing harvest failures. Another evil resulting from it is a shortage of women,which makes it difficult for each man to have two wives and thus ensure hisprogeny. But the problem is too fundamental to be solved by decree. Parentsdon’t kill girls because they want to. They feel they can’t afford to bring upchildren from whom they will get no return. The Master thus suggests that girlsshould be made more valuable by permitting them to earn their keep, just as boysdo. They should be to their husbands what an official is to his lord. This wouldenable a daughter to support her own parents in exchange for the trouble theytook to raise her. In this situation a wife would be happy and not of “twohearts,” as the Master puts it. She would no longer serve her in- laws at thecost of forsaking her own parents.It is remarkable that the position of the TPJ in this matter is as isolated asit is. Clearly, infant mortality was such that newborn children were in generalnot yet seen as human beings, so that Confucian arguments for humane behaviorwere not applicable to them. As a consequence, the Master does not apply moralconsiderations, but rather points to the “resentment” created by such killingsand its destabilizing cosmic effect. The Master’s program for changing thesituation amounts to premodern China’s only attempt to allocate to women thefull measure of human responsibility. Their filial piety, which to those in thesecond century C.E. was roughly equivalent to their morality, was to be equatedwith that of men.• • •(41.29) Step forward, Perfected! You have been coming to study the doctrine(dao) for such a long time. You have really learned it all by now, don’t youthink?If you had not again spoken to me, I might have thought so. But as soon as Ihear your words, I know it is not so. Now I would like to reach the end but Ican’t think of another question. If the Celestial Master would only reveal myshortcomings once again!All right, come here. What do we mean by “rich” and “poor”?Well, those who own a lot are rich and those who own little are poor.What you have said appears to be true but is in fact false.What do you mean?Take someone who often cheats, deceives, flatters, steals, and robs. How couldwe call him “rich”? Or take a situation where the people in general own a lotwhile the sovereign owns but little. How could we call him “poor”?4[Notes.xhtml#ch1fn4] (41.30)Foolish and stupid as I am, I felt I had to speak up when the Celestial Masterset out to instruct me. I am not good enough; I am at fault.If you say you are not good enough, how shall the common people know the meaningof poor and rich?If only you would think of my ignorance as being as that of a small child5[Notes.xhtml#ch1fn5] who must be instructed by its father and mother before itgains understanding.6 [Notes.xhtml#ch1fn6]True. Modest as you are, you don’t go amiss.Yes.Collect your thoughts. I will tell you all.7 [Notes.xhtml#ch1fn7] We speak of“rich” when there is sufficient supply. By making everything grow, heavenprovides enough wealth. Thus we say that there is enough wealth when suprememajestic qi8 [Notes.xhtml#ch1fn8] arises and all twelve thousand plants andbeings9 [Notes.xhtml#ch1fn9] are brought to life. Under the influence of mediummajestic qi, plants and beings are slightly deficient in that it cannot providefor all twelve thousand of them. This causes small poverty. When under theinfluence of lower majestic qi, plants and beings are again fewer than under theinfluence of medium majestic qi, and this causes great poverty. When there areno auspicious portents10 [Notes.xhtml#ch1fn10] [signifying the approach ofmajestic qi] at all, the crops11 [Notes.xhtml#ch1fn11] won’t grow, which isextreme poverty. Take a look at a peasant family if you wish to know what thisamounts to. Should they not possess any rare and valuable objects, they areconsidered a poor family.12 [Notes.xhtml#ch1fn12] Should they not be suppliedwith what they need, they must be seen as an extremely poor family.The problem lies in the poverty of heaven and earth. Once all twelve thousandplants and beings come forth and are nurtured by earth without detriment, earthbecomes rich. If it can’t nurture them well,13 [Notes.xhtml#ch1fn13] it becomesslightly poor as long as injuries remain small, and quite poor should they belarge. If crops were to shy away from being seen and fail to grow, injured byearth’s body, this would lead to extreme poverty. Without jade and othervaluables and with half the yields damaged, great distress and poverty wouldcome about. Such complete damage would eradicate a poor family.Now think of heaven as father and earth as mother. Should father and mother bein such extreme poverty all their children would suffer from poverty. The king’sgovernment is a replica of this. Thus the wise kings of antiquity, whose reignreached out to all twelve thousand plants and beings, became lords of greatwealth. Harvests that reach two-thirds of their potential provide a lord withmedium wealth. When they amount to only one-third, he has but little wealth.With neither valuables nor crops, he becomes a lord of great poverty.14[Notes.xhtml#ch1fn14] Once half of his harvests are damaged, his house is indecline. If all are damaged, he becomes a man of great poverty.The wise and worthy of antiquity reflected deep in their dark chamber15[Notes.xhtml#ch1fn15] on the question of how poverty and wealth were achievedthrough [adhering to] dao and virtue. Why should anyone ask about this? Throughmeditation, men will find out for themselves.16 [Notes.xhtml#ch1fn16] (41.31)Excellent! If the Celestial Master would only show kindness to emperors andkings! They have suffered bitterly and for a long time,17 [Notes.xhtml#ch1fn17]and have been frustrated in their ambition. Whereby does one achieve suchpoverty and such wealth?18 [Notes.xhtml#ch1fn18]Yes, fine! Your question touches upon the crucial point of certain subtlesayings.19 [Notes.xhtml#ch1fn19] Well, how they are put into practice bringsabout gain or loss. Once someone follows the true doctrine (dao) with all hismight, heaven’s life-giving spirits20 [Notes.xhtml#ch1fn20] will help hismission. So spirits sent by heaven and good harvests will be plenty. If a manenacts virtue, earth’s nourishing spirits will come forth21[Notes.xhtml#ch1fn21] to assist his conduct of affairs. Thus, he will gain halfof his potential wealth. Once someone enacts humaneness, the humane spirits ofthe harmony that prevails in the realm between heaven and earth22[Notes.xhtml#ch1fn22] will step forward to help him conduct his affairs andachieve a small measure of wealth. Someone who attempts cultural refinement ison the way to intrigues and deceit, so that deceitful spirits will come forth tohelp him. Thus his conduct will be in some disorder. (41.32) But if he were toundertake military action, bandit spirits would be bound to appear in hissupport. Government would thus be directed against the will of heaven. It wouldinjure and harm even good men.23 [Notes.xhtml#ch1fn23]Dao sets the rule for heaven’s conduct.24 [Notes.xhtml#ch1fn24] Since heaven isthe highest of all spirits (zui shen 最神), true spirits come forth to assist itsmission. Since earth nurtures, virtuous spirits step forward to assist itsmission. Humane spirits come forth to help a man’s mission if he is humane.Cultured men are preoccupied with deceiving each other by means of culture. Theyhave lost their root. Thus deceitful spirits appear to assist them. Oncesuperiors and inferiors deal with each other by means of culture, their affairsare in disorder. Soldiers subdue others through punishment, murder, and injury.Bandits do the same. Any man who in subduing others is guided by anger, joy,violence, and severity is a bandit. So, large numbers of bandits step forth tothreaten his reign. Since they often damage people’s belongings, such a way ofgovernment entails a loss of property.25 [Notes.xhtml#ch1fn25]Thus antiquity’s supreme lords, who subdued others through dao, largely accordedwith the will of heaven. They governed as if they were spirits. They subduedothers through true dao without causing distress. Lords of middle rank exertcontrol through virtue, and lords of lower rank through humaneness. Lords ofchaos subdue others through cultural refinement, and those of disaster anddefeat rule by punishing, murdering, and injuring others. Thus the supreme lordsof antiquity ruled over others through dao, virtue, and humaneness instead ofinflicting injuries by means of culture or through punishing and murderingothers. Since this is the case, the use of such means is despicable.26[Notes.xhtml#ch1fn26]However, a supreme lord resembles heaven and earth. Since heaven is prone togiving life rather than to inflicting injuries, we call it lord and father.Since earth likes to nurture the ten thousand plants and beings, we call ithonest official and mother. Since man thinks in a humane manner and shows thesame concern and care as heaven and earth do, we call him humane. Through theirgoodness these three manage to govern and to lead the ten thousand plants andbeings. But one cannot govern by deceiving and punishing, [for then] disastersgrow in number and make it impossible for emperors and kings to achieve greatpeace. So this must stop.Now if you, Perfected, were to give my book to a lord in possession of dao andvirtue and he implemented what it says energetically, he would reach a positionthat would correspond to that of heaven. Thus he would achieve great peace.There is no doubt that we would call his house rich. In this case nothing wouldcause emperors and kings to suffer distress. In the opposite case we would speakof a poor house.Nowadays people sometimes call each other “rich families.” Why is this so?27[Notes.xhtml#ch1fn27]This is what they do, but the common people talk nonsense. When we use the word“rich” we mean that everything is provided for. (41.33) If one single item islacking, [supplies] are incomplete. For this reason the wise and worthy of olddid not demand perfection from individuals, since they did not see them fit forit.28 [Notes.xhtml#ch1fn28] Today goods are in short and incomplete supply inall eighty-one territories.29 [Notes.xhtml#ch1fn29] It is impossible to achieveany long-term sufficiency, so goods are obtained from other territories. Now towhat degree can one individual family be rich? Would you like to go along withthe nonsense that common people put forth?No, I would not dare to.You have learned to watch your words, so don’t utter nonsense, or you mightbring disorder to the standard patterns (zheng wen 正文) of heaven and earth andthey won’t serve as a model for men.30 [Notes.xhtml#ch1fn30] Be careful.Yes, I will. Now the Celestial Master has shown himself to be merciful andloving. He has a kind regard for emperors and kings who on their thrones sufferdistress and fail to be in favor with heaven.Since it has all been explained to them they should be able to find the paththat leads to the great peace of supreme majesty.31 [Notes.xhtml#ch1fn31]Foolish as I am, I have received a large amount of writings. I feel dizzy andconfused as if I was a youngster and I don’t know what to ask next. Since youare heaven’s enlightened teacher, do convey all its warnings!32[Notes.xhtml#ch1fn32]Yes, fine. Well, according to the model set by heaven, Yang’s cipher is one andthat of Yin two.33 [Notes.xhtml#ch1fn33] So Yang is single and Yin is a pair.Therefore, lords are few and subordinates are many. Since Yang is honored andYin is humble, two Yin must jointly serve one Yang. Since heaven’s cipher is oneand that of earth is two, two women must jointly serve one man.Why should it be necessary that two persons care for one?The place next to someone in an honored position must never be left empty. Whenone is employed the other must remain standing or sitting next to the person inthe center to look after his needs. So the one resembles heaven while the twoare similar to earth. (41.34) Since men are children of heaven and earth, theymust imitate both. The world has nowadays lost dao, so girls are often despisedand even maltreated and murdered, which has caused there to be fewer girls thanboys. So Yin’s qi is reduced, which does not agree with the model of heaven andearth. Heaven’s way establishes the model that a solitary Yang without a partnerwill bring drought and cause heaven not to rain when it should. Women correspondto earth: Should one single woman be despised, it is as if all in the worlddespise their true mother. Should they maltreat, hurt, or murder34[Notes.xhtml#ch1fn34] earth’s qi, it will be cut off and cease to give life. Ingreat anger the earth would then turn hostile, so that a plethora of disasterswould make it impossible for the king’s government to achieve peace.Why?The male is heaven’s vital spirit; the female is earth’s. Things (wu 物)influence each other within their own kind. It is not only the king’s fault thathis government is not at peace. Instead, men have in general lost dao and becomenegligent. They are all wrong. Since there is not just one mistake but tenthousand, it is difficult to conduct government affairs peacefully and they tendto go wrong. It is the nature of heaven and earth that among all twelve thousandplants and beings human life is the most important.35 [Notes.xhtml#ch1fn35] Thusmaltreating and murdering women brings profound disorder to a king’s government.This is a great offense.36 [Notes.xhtml#ch1fn36]Now the Celestial Master has opened to kings the ascent to great peace. The truescripture on great peace has appeared. Thus they need only at their leisure togo on long spiritual journeys. How can it be that to violate women entails somuch calamity for them?This is a good question. You understand what heaven wants. Truly, the wholeworld despises and hates women because they condemn their conduct.What do you mean? I wish to hear it. I will try to take notes on bamboo and silkso that for ten thousand times ten thousand generations no one will dare todepart from it.Fine. Now that you can put it down in writing, the world will in the futurenever again murder women.38 [Notes.xhtml#ch1fn38]Yes, I want to write it down in order to free emperors and kings fromcalamities. I take pleasure in saving the lives of women [stricken with] grief.Good. Now you have gained points in the accounts kept by heaven.What do you mean?Indeed, to give life to others means giving life to oneself, and to kill othersmeans to kill oneself. Heaven’s concern for you may already have increased youraccount with heaven. So the Controller of Fate39 [Notes.xhtml#ch1fn39] will makealterations in your personal records.This I would never dare to accept.One must not turn this down; it lies within the model of heaven being the way itis (ziran 自然). Well, women are murdered all over the world [for the followingreason]: A father and mother suffer distress as long as a human being is youngand small. They skimp on their own clothes and food in order to rear it. It isnot only human beings who behave like this; all things that crawl and run behavelike this. Everyone, big or small, must when grown up put all their energy intothe search for clothes and food. (41.35) Thus the ten thousand beings all leavetheir father and mother to clothe and feed themselves. If they are worthy theymeet with happiness; if they are not they are in distress. Furthermore, whenyoung, a child gains daily more strength until it has ample, while its fatherand mother are daily more wasted by old age. Their strength diminishes until itno longer suffices. But, with its surplus of knowledge, worthiness, andstrength, a child, whether male or female, must nourish its father and mother inreturn for their exertion and kindness on its behalf. So its father and mothermust no longer clothe and feed it or we say “the weak is nourishing the strong.”We speak about “adverse policy” should someone with insufficient muscle powernourish those who have more than they need. This is the reason young ones whoare bound to bring distress to those who are older without providing any gainsfor their father and mother are often killed by them. Now their father andmother murder them because clothes and food are scarce. Wouldn’t it be better torear them and let everyone find their own clothes and food? Perfected, this isreally a grievous interruption of earth’s dispensation.40 [Notes.xhtml#ch1fn40]People are so foolish!Now that I have heard this, I feel sad and alarmed. I understand that there aremany grievances. What should be done?Well, someone who likes to study but does not get clothes and food is stopped onhis way (dao) since his studies are interrupted. But if he gets clothes andfood, the worthy does not cease to learn. We should let everyone be of some use.If not they would instead cause distress and misery.What do you mean?Now a woman has no abode. She must get clothes and food by attending to herhusband as a man does by attending to his office.41 [Notes.xhtml#ch1fn41] When awoman attends to her husband’s house, they must support each other and leadtheir life in unison. Together they continue the dispensation of heaven andearth, until in death their bones and flesh are returned to the same place. Theyget clothes and food from supporting each other. If they are worthy, they willbe happy; if not, they will suffer. Take soil as an example: heaven will add itsshare to the rich produce of fertile soil. It does exactly the same for the poorproduce of meager soil. It certainly does not deprive soil of giving growth.Heaven and earth would never deprive a woman42 [Notes.xhtml#ch1fn42] of herachievement. How much more so should this be men’s axiom! If it were, men wouldnever again kill their women!Excellent indeed! As soon as this one great and severe damage has been averted,great peace will come about for emperors and kings.How do you know, Perfected?Well, the affection a father and mother feel for their child is the most solidthere is in this world. If the child did not make them miserable and distressed,there would be no reason to kill it. They must not kill it or else their qibecomes that of bandits and in their great contrariness they are thoroughlydevoid of dao.43 [Notes.xhtml#ch1fn43] For this reason it throws the reign ofemperors and kings into deep disorder. (41.36) Now if women were to live withoutbeing maltreated, murdered, and violated, there would be great joy.Yes, what you have said is true. We may assume that you have understood. Now ifone family kills one female: how many hundreds of thousands of families arethere all over the world? Sometimes one family kills dozens of females44[Notes.xhtml#ch1fn44] or a fetus is injured before birth. Grief-stricken qi45[Notes.xhtml#ch1fn45] rises up to move heaven. How can these acts not bedisorderly (wu dao li 無道理)? So I truly want you to know more about it.46[Notes.xhtml#ch1fn46]Should every human being through her own effort provide her own clothes andfood, no wife would be of two hearts. She would concentrate on her activitiesand never again harbor any doubts. Those who lack achievement are foreverdeprived of a balance of mind.So much for the methods that nature, being as it is (tian xing ziran 天性自然),suggests. Pay attention, Perfected, that you don’t lay this book aside, but giveit to a lord who is humane and worthy, so that he can free [men] from all thegrief they are stricken with and from the calamities that injure them. Payattention to what my book says so that you can explain it to everyone. It mustnever again be permissible to do away with females.47 [Notes.xhtml#ch1fn47]Furthermore, this rule agrees with the model (fa 法) of heaven and earthaccording to which one man should have two wives because heaven has arrangedthat Yang is single and Yin is a pair. Since the height of middle antiquity menhave forgotten what heaven’s way intends and have often maltreated and murderedfemales, which has in turn caused men to be numerous and women to be so few thatthere are not enough. This is grossly opposed to heaven’s way. By making thekilling of females a common practice, men have caused even more [evil] to beinherited and passed on.48 [Notes.xhtml#ch1fn48] Later generations havemultiplied the world’s trespasses, so that it has become completely devoid ofdao.Man is heir to heaven’s dispensation and woman to that of earth. If we were tocut off earth’s dispensation we would no longer be able to reproduce ourselves,and then many of us would die without progeny. What an awful crime!49[Notes.xhtml#ch1fn49] Thus all must reproduce themselves and continue theirkind. But if we were to interrupt earth’s dispensation and exterminatehumankind, heaven would forever put an end to the species populating thisworld.50 [Notes.xhtml#ch1fn50]Moreover, when human beings come to life, heaven’s qi shines forth in all ofthem: their head is round like heaven, their feet are square like earth, thefour limbs resemble the four seasons, the five internal organs the five phases,while ears and eyes, mouth and nose are like the seven regents51[Notes.xhtml#ch1fn51] or three luminaries. I cannot explain to you all of this,but wise men52 [Notes.xhtml#ch1fn52] know about it. The life of human beings isall Yin and Yang. Once the number of days and months is completed, they open thewomb and step outside. In sight of heaven and earth, they grow up. Together theycontinue the dispensation of their ancestors. They assist heaven in giving lifeto plants and beings (wu 物) and assist earth in nourishing what has taken shape.Since the spirits of heaven and earth put their trust in a certain family, theirdispensation comes to live in a certain human being. That men damage it, heavensees as a grave misdeed. But men won’t keep each other in check. (41.37)Therefore heaven has sent me to make this book known to the generations to come.Although these matters are quite manifest, they are still continued,consciously. We must say that this is to consciously act against the model setby heaven. It is a crime of many layers and will no doubt put an end tohumankind. Beware, Perfected, be on your guard.Yes, I will.Now that you have understood these issues, you and not others will be put ontrial should you neglect these writings.I would not dare to do so!You may go now, and may each of you follow your own device.Yes, we will.53 [Notes.xhtml#ch1fn53]"},{"pageContent":"SECTION 42ONE MAN AND TWO WOMENThis short section deals with sexual conduct. The need to have children isasserted despite the contemporary trend to avoid it. This need is seen as rootednot in the demands of filial piety or other family-oriented considerations, butrather as rooted in nature. The benefits of having children are said to overrideany benefit individuals might hope to gain from sexual abstinence or from sexualtechniques preventing the flow of semen (benefit that is, in any case, describedas imaginary). What is at stake is the order of nature, and in particularweather conditions and the growth of plants, which are directly influenced byindividual behavior. This dynamic creates a situation in which everybody muststrive to achieve exemplary conduct, which entails imitating nature as closelyas possible. The term “model\" (fa) is reserved for the conduct of heaven. Humanbeings are expected to take heaven’s exemplary conduct as a model for their ownactions. However, the section shows clearly that heaven imitates human conductin the same way that human beings are expected to imitate heaven. Imitation isthe rule according to which the entire system functions. The active element inthis system is man. If he chooses to ignore what is natural, nature will followsuit. Or, as the Master puts it, if human beings don’t produce children, heavenand earth will stop the growth of plants.This section’s progeny-oriented attitude toward sexual intercourse accords withthe concern for social renewal evident in much of what the Celestial Masterdeclares. However, sexual activity is said to have other functions as well. Itis fun and rejuvenates men, it says in section 62, and it is what human beingswant (see section 52). That it helps to “nourish the vital principle”1[Notes.xhtml#ch2fn1] is not a topic of the TPJ, or at least not of those partsthat have been transmitted.Returning to the proposition introduced in section 41 that “one man is theequivalent of two women,” the Master stresses another aspect of the creation oflife: it can happen only if it is in accord with patterns established in thetrans-human world. Any relationship between man and woman must resemble Yin andYang’s numerical pattern, which is the relationship between even and odd orbetween two and one.2 [Notes.xhtml#ch2fn2]The last passage adds a marginal point. Here the king is expected to representheaven in its relationship to earth directly, and for this reason he is to haveintercourse with a woman from each province of his realm.• • •(42.37) Perfected, step forward. If heaven’s qi of great harmony and peace (taihe ping qi 太禾口 平氣) had just arrived, and the king’s government was about to beat great peace,3 [Notes.xhtml#ch2fn3] should men be chaste4 [Notes.xhtml#ch2fn4]or not? Why should they be chaste?The chaste reduce their desires and don’t act at random.5 [Notes.xhtml#ch2fn5]Oh, what you say, Perfected, is naive.6 [Notes.xhtml#ch2fn6] From the height ofmiddle antiquity, the common people have been misled. Their teachers werejealous of the truth and taught them lies.What do you mean?A chaste man does not beget, a chaste woman does not become pregnant. Thus Yinand Yang are not exchanged, which completely annihilates the world’spopulation.7 [Notes.xhtml#ch2fn7] So two human beings join forces to cut off thedispensation of heaven and earth because they wish to obtain a little empty andfalse fame. Through their lack of progeny they lose their internal substance andcause great damage to the world. How would you have come to exist had a fatherand mother not brought you to life? But both heaven and earth hate human beingswho cause ruptures. They are known as “men of great contrariness who disruptorder.”8 [Notes.xhtml#ch2fn8] In response, such action brings forth a separationbetween heaven and earth so that heaven won’t assent to let it rain and earthwon’t give birth to anything. (42.38)Why is this so?9 [Notes.xhtml#ch2fn9]When heaven does not give rain, this means that it does not beget because it ischaste. When earth does not let the ten thousand plants grow, this means that itdoes not become pregnant because it is chaste. Without rain from heaven, earthhas no means to give growth, which is a great disaster for the whole world. Howcan one deem this to be good? Judging by what you have said you don’t follow theteachings of heaven and earth, but go against heaven’s way and are not inclinedto assist heaven and earth in making things grow. Instead, you wish to causeruptures. How could the words you have uttered not offend majestic heaven andaugust earth?10 [Notes.xhtml#ch2fn10]My mind is weak, I am not good enough; I am mistaken. Now that I have heard whatyou have said I myself know that this crime is serious.Don’t [say that]. Let me tell you that actions must not run counter to heaven’sway and that you won’t comply with heaven’s will should you heed the words ofthe common people. The cause for the frequent ruptures [in the relationship]between Yin and Yang lies in a lack of harmony between man and woman. These twoare at the root of Yin and Yang. How could it be auspicious for the conduct ofaffairs to lose the root?11 [Notes.xhtml#ch2fn11]I completely agree with the Celestial Master. What can I say?Well, when qi of great majestic heaven’s supreme peace is about to arrive wemust faithfully take heaven as our model. For this reason we order one man tohave two wives so that they resemble Yin and Yang. Yang’s cipher is single, thatof Yin is a pair. Thus qi of great harmony will arrive. Should there be too manywomen, the Yin qi would prosper; if there were too many men, the Yang qi wouldhave no partner, which would go against the model [set by heaven]12[Notes.xhtml#ch2fn12] and certainly lead to disaster.Why?Ciphers for the human realm must agree with heaven and earth. If they don’t,human energy will not suffice and we will encounter disastrous damage.13[Notes.xhtml#ch2fn13]What is the meaning of “The spouses of emperors and kings correspond to the soilof the earth”?14 [Notes.xhtml#ch2fn14]What you have just said supports my words. If woman is vital spirit (jing shen精神) of the earth’s soil, the king is vital spirit of heaven. The main fear isthat the soil of the earth does not obtain Yang’s vital spirit because theking’s qi is not received in intercourse. This prevents earth’s soil from givingbirth. Thus in each province15 [Notes.xhtml#ch2fn15] the king must choose onewife to let his qi penetrate. Intent on giving life he fears that his begettingmight not succeed because the kingly semen is not well received. Therefore, hechooses [a wife] as one would choose soil.16 [Notes.xhtml#ch2fn16] Once hebegets, heaven’s qi penetrates so that rain falls at the right time and earthgives growth to the ten thousand plants and beings. One must not honor chastemen and women or qi of great peace will not arrive. To remain alone in one’sinternal chambers is a profound mistake, which deprives the king’s government ofharmony and honesty. Even the common people must not trespass against this rule.So let one man have two wives.Yes, indeed.17 [Notes.xhtml#ch2fn17]"},{"pageContent":"SECTION 43HOW TO PROMOTE THE GOOD AND HALT THE WICKEDThis section provides a concrete example of “heaven-guided” politicaladministration. A general hearing is organized that is meant to unite the localpopulation and government organs in order to isolate any unruly elements thathave become active in a neighborhood. It can succeed only if it follows a ritualthat corresponds to cosmic patterns. Thus the participants are divided intogroups, each of which represents a cosmic force. The groups are seated in a waythat reflects cosmic order. This is what we might call a worldly orparticipant-oriented use of ritual and is in itself an interesting phenomenon.The Celestial Master does not suggest that rituals are a necessary vehicle forunderstanding or influencing the will of heaven. However, a cosmos-orientedsocial arrangement is deemed helpful in order to convey heaven’s will to men.This arrangement is enhanced by certain supportive measures, which are dictatedby psychological considerations. The measures include the use of wine, thephysical isolation of the official in charge, and, most importantly, mechanismsto protect the informant and enhance his status.The procedures described here come under the heading of communication and flowof information, and they are thus central to the arrival of great peace.Communication, in this case between a low-ranking official and a group ofcommoners, cannot be taken for granted. It is for cosmic reasons a positive,desirable event, and thus the Master does not hesitate to go into great detailabout how to promote it. This account provides an apparently unique insight intothe conduct of local government. It proves that certain points of the taipingprogram were rooted in the practical needs of centrally appointed officials oflower rank. For most of their undertakings these officials relied on localindividuals willing to cooperate, and thus they could not afford to create arift between those willing to help and those who were not.Almost as an afterthought, this section includes an instructive passage on howwe may envisage the arrival of great peace and how it is related to the Master’sreform program. The arrival of great peace goes through the following stages:for numerological reasons, qi of great peace is about to arrive; heaven sendstexts with information about this arrival and about the appropriate reformprogram (at this stage the Master and his disciples are at work); men implementthese reforms; the arrival of the qi of great peace brings great peace itself.The Celestial Master continues to remind his audience of the difference betweenthe potential of a situation, usually described as a heaven-derived chance forsalvation, and its realization through human action.• • •(43.39) Perfected, step forward. Now if qi of great peace were about to arrive,we would wish diligent and good men to prosper and the wicked to become fewer.Thus, what should the administration do if murderers and bandits were to appear?What do you mean?Let’s say one knows they are in the neighborhood and that the lord who is incharge has become suspicious. Since it is the lord’s intention that the goodprosper and the wicked become fewer he will try to lay hold of bandits as soonas they step forth.So what should the administration do?Now that is what you must tell us.If the Celestial Master would allow me, I would rather not speak. Not a singleword I could say would match the model that you put forth.Why speak so modestly? Since ancient times the great wise men have not expectedperfection in individuals.1 [Notes.xhtml#ch3fn1] Even if your words were notappropriate, why be so modest about it?Yes, I will speak. But what the lord must do is reward the good and punish thewicked. If he clearly defines rewards and punishment,2 [Notes.xhtml#ch3fn2] thegood will prosper from day to day and the wicked will become fewer.3[Notes.xhtml#ch3fn3]What you have said is correct. But do we have the names of those to be rewardedor punished?Although I am not good enough, I have managed to speak once and would rather notspeak again. If only the Celestial Master would explain it all! (43.40)Well, you will be in charge of writing it down and I will tell you everything.The county head4 [Notes.xhtml#ch3fn4] proceeds toward the place in question,where he assembles all the villagers.5 [Notes.xhtml#ch3fn5] Former officials ofhigher and lower rank are seated facing east.6 [Notes.xhtml#ch3fn6] Men whounderstand the classics and are of virtuous conduct are seated facing north.7[Notes.xhtml#ch3fn7] Those known to be filial sons or fraternal younger brothersare seated facing west. Diligent farmers8 [Notes.xhtml#ch3fn8] are seated in thesoutheast corner facing northwest. Wicked young men are seated in the southwestfacing northeast.9 [Notes.xhtml#ch3fn9] The lord himself faces south.Why must they sit exactly like this?With each person put in his group, heaven’s way is on its proper course, just asmen’s seating arrangement is appropriate (shan 善). Thus it should be easy to layhold of the bandits.What do you mean?Former officials of higher and lower rank represent propriety (yi 義).10[Notes.xhtml#ch3fn10] Having retired from office, for reasons of propriety theydelight in giving support. Men who understand the classics and are of virtuousconduct (dao de 道得) represent understanding (ming 明). They hope that theirunderstanding of classical education11 [Notes.xhtml#ch3fn11] will help in thedetection of wicked elements. Filial sons and fraternal younger brothersrepresent their home district.12 [Notes.xhtml#ch3fn12] The very filial appeal tofeelings [of sympathy] to make bandits return home. The filial and fraternal areinclined to constant diligence and respect, as shown during a morning audience.Once plants and beings come to life in the east,13 [Notes.xhtml#ch3fn13] theyare likely to continue to move forward. The diligent are fit to be in thesoutheast, since this is the district of prolonging life. Never neglectful, theyhappily manage all plants and beings. Wicked young men are fit to be in thesouthwest, which is the district where Yang is decreasing and Yin increasing.14[Notes.xhtml#ch3fn14] So should any wicked person wish to play tricks,punishment for his crimes would be at hand. Since the wicked person is asdexterous as an ape, he is put in a region of decline.Men facing east, west, and north sit down first, while the diligent15[Notes.xhtml#ch3fn15] and the wicked sit down afterward. Should there be wine,let each man have a cup. Otherwise, good words must be delivered to mustersupport for the investigation. Once everything is ready, the lord sits down inthe space in between, behind locked doors. Called upon one after the other inorder of social rank men begin to inform. Each tells his story and reports thename of the gang leader. What is told and reported must, in the end, becoherent.16 [Notes.xhtml#ch3fn16] If it is not, the informant is declaredguilty. Those who speak incoherently are great liars and will be made known assuch. Men who speak coherently will eventually be rewarded and promoted, but notimmediately.Why is this so?Because it might cause resentment. Should a lord or a father make subordinatesor sons resentful, he is neither a merciful father nor a worthy lord. In thisway, he eventually drives good men away and the wicked young men who will helplocal officials to pursue bandits will not be able to capture them and bringtheir activities to a halt.Perfected, give these writings to a virtuous lord to show to all men, so thateveryone will know what they teach. (43.41) Then the good will go on to prosper,the wicked will become fewer, and bandits and evil plotters will be apprehended.Excellent, indeed. But why show these writings in advance?When heaven is about to let it rain, there will certainly first be wind andclouds to let men know. Heaven does this because it wants men to harvest a lot.Since we want to let the good prosper and bring the wicked to a halt, we mustshow these writings in advance. Now that qi of great peace is bound to arrive,there is a fear that by doing evil men might bring their government intodisorder. Thus we must create awareness [about the arrival] in advance. Theadministration must imitate heaven. Heaven does not cover up men’s shortcomings,nor did the wise men from early antiquity. We would have to call anadministration that did this confused and stupid. It would lead to disaster, inopposition to the intentions of heaven and earth. So we must let men know inadvance.Very well. But why must the lord lock himself behind doors and let those whospeak remain outside?Well, a man about to tell secrets must not himself know his opposite number. Iftheir heads were close together, people on the right and left would know aboutit, which might cause problems for the speaker. But should the lord and head ofa county obtain others’ intelligence and allow them to run into problemsafterward, we would have to say that he was injuring loyal, faithful, worthy,and honest assistants. No one would be willing to speak up again in the future.The administration is in danger of disorder when intelligence is blocked.17[Notes.xhtml#ch3fn17] Moreover, a lord resembles Yang that lives in Yin, while asubordinate resembles Yin that stays in Yang. When Yin and Yang understand eachother, men will be happy to talk, which is bound to bring forth complete trust.This is the model of heaven being as it is.18 [Notes.xhtml#ch3fn18] Do youunderstand a little better?Yes, I do.You may go now. Watch your words. This is what is said in the writings that leadto great peace.Yes.19 [Notes.xhtml#ch3fn19]"},{"pageContent":"SECTION 44HOW TO PRESERVE THE THREE ESSENTIALSThis section reads like an exegesis of Laozi’s political thought. In proclaimingthat there are only three human needs, it follows the fundamentalist approach ofLaozi 81.1 [Notes.xhtml#ch4fn1] To fulfill these needs means to preserve life.Should men ignore them the world would come to an end. This position was not asunrefuted as one might suppose. It contradicts outright Confucius’s dictum aboutthe respective importance of food, weapons, and ethics. He thought foodirrelevant because men die anyway. Although these needs play a role in decidinggovernment policy and evaluating its outcome— the people, of course, have to befed, clothed, and enabled to raise a family—they were of little concern forpolitical philosophy. The needs that were mentioned in ancient sources—forinstance, food in the Hong fan’s “eight government objectives” (ba zheng 八政),and agriculture and sericulture in Xun Yue’s “five administrative tasks”2[Notes.xhtml#ch4fn2]—did not include the specifically Daoist item of sexualrelations.Following what is said in the Laozi, the TPJ authors argue that to concentrateproperly on these needs means to exclude and give up all activities not directlylinked to them. The demand to fulfill the three needs is phrased as aprohibition of the search for everything else. Such a search would result inmoral depravity—called “deception” and “jealousy”—which is bound to createsocial and political chaos. The Master argues that the disciple is thus deceivedwhen he thinks that we need everything that is of some use.What is not basic, and is therefore evil, includes luxurious garments (Confuciusjoined in condemning these), luxury items in general, and, in particular, allpolicies and regulations. Concern for the three needs thus becomes synonymouswith government through nonaction by a ruler not involved in administrativeroutine. It is also synonymous with the process of return and reversal, which ispromoted in the Laozi as the only way to practice dao.• • •(44.42) Perfected, step forward.Yes.How many big needs are there in what men do in this world? How many small needs?And how many conditions, although not needs, have an impact on the growth ofmisfortune and disaster? Collect your thoughts, Perfected, to tell all.Yes, I will. Truly, what is on one’s mind one must not dare to hide.Speak up.In all affairs of this world what is of use is needed and what is not of use isnot needed.What you have said sounds all right but is quite wrong. I want to hear what isforever needed and must not be done away with; something without which the menwho live in this world would be annihilated and the patterns of heaven turn intoa cluster (bing he 并合) so that nothing to be named would be left.3[Notes.xhtml#ch4fn3] Something such as this can be considered a great need. Whatyou have just mentioned agrees somehow with what people want for the present butthat will in the long run lead to a point from which misfortune and disasterdevelop.Step forward, Perfected.4 [Notes.xhtml#ch4fn4] I would like to know from youwhat is always needed and must never be put aside.5 [Notes.xhtml#ch4fn5]If only the Celestial Master were to speak in detail and give us his analysisand explanation. I am foolish and my efforts have failed. I have said the wrongthing once. I don’t dare speak again.Well, it is as you say. Let someone who knows do the talking. If we were toforce someone who doesn’t know to talk, he might find it exhausting. You cannotforce men to know what they don’t grasp, be it big or small. (44.43) There is noproblem once they have grasped it, but it’s not easy if they haven’t.This is the reason why you must please enlighten this shallow, ignorant, andincapable pupil. Please introduce me to the basics!Yes, I will. Listen. The world has two big needs and one that is smaller. Noneof the rest is needed since it serves only to oppress6 [Notes.xhtml#ch4fn6]men’s ears and eyes, being good for the moment but inviting misfortune in thelong term. It exhausts men and makes them dejected.What do you mean?How foolish you are! Well, when man first came to life in this world he was partof heaven and earth. He embraced primordial qi in a state of being as he was(ziran).7 [Notes.xhtml#ch4fn7] Thus he neither drank nor ate but stayed alivethrough exhaling and inhaling the qi of Yin and Yang. He did not know hunger andthirst. In the course of time, man distanced himself from the way of thespirits8 [Notes.xhtml#ch4fn8] and gradually lost direction. So the latter- bornnever reached understanding. The true doctrine (dao) was hollowed out and becamemore and more deceptive. This brought about hunger and thirst. Men would dieunless they drank and ate. This is the first great need. Since heaven and earthfelt friendly concern, they made drink and food for them. So men drank and ate.Heaven’s dispensation consists of Yin and Yang. It must be continued. One mustnot interrupt the dispensation of heaven and earth. To make them continue onemust imitate heaven and earth in being Yin as well as Yang. (44.44) For thisreason heaven put forth one male and one female, who then produced offspringafter having loved each other.Why exactly one Yin and one Yang?Yang at its high point begins to give rise to Yin, and Yin at its high pointbegins to give rise to Yang. Thus the two procreate each other, just assomething that is extremely cold turns into something hot, and something that isextremely hot becomes cold. This is the technique of what is as it is.9[Notes.xhtml#ch4fn9] Therefore, they can over a long period give birth to eachother and for generations avoid any interruption to the dispensations of heavenand earth. Should male and female not get hold of each other, reproduction wouldimmediately be interrupted. In a world without men, how could there be man andwife, father and son, lord and subordinate, teacher and student?10[Notes.xhtml#ch4fn10] How could one bring forth and govern the other? If therewere no males and females between heaven and earth, how could there beprocreation? From being alone comes emptiness (kong 空). This is the second greatneed.Thus, it is through Yin and Yang that we carry on the dispensation of heaven andof earth and don’t let them become completely exhausted. [Only through Yin andYang] can lord and subordinate control the disorder in their realms and can wiseteachers and their disciples preside over the promulgation of heaven’s teachingsand thus assist emperors and kings in reforming (hua 化) the world. Since allthis depends on drink and food and the love between man and woman, both aregreat needs.Through cold and heat, heaven’s way would kill half of all men if they did notcover themselves. Thus, heaven has created the ten thousand plants and beingsfor men to use as clothes. But without clothes, they would live in caves andhidden grottoes where desolation would strike half of them dead. They would notbe completely wiped out. This is what we call half a need.The “great needs” that heaven’s way has set up concern extinction and death. Noother need is more urgent. But without clothes, men cannot drink and eat, makelove, and do good deeds. Thus clothes promote worthiness, while their lackfurthers bad conduct. So clothes are meant only to protect against harm. This iswhy the wise and worthy of old were not keen on precious garments made of darkand yellow silk.Drinking, eating, and the mixing of Yin and Yang must not be interrupted. Ifthey are, the world will inevitably be without men. All you need to do in orderto fulfill your natural life span and continue heaven’s dispensation is tosafeguard these three, so that when one dies another will begin, without end.This is why the wise men of antiquity reigned with these three in mind. They didnot see the rest as a need and thus they abolished all causes for disaster andmisfortune.What do you mean?These three needs correspond to the course of nature (tian xing 天行): manresembles heaven, woman earth, and clothes are a means of support.11[Notes.xhtml#ch4fn11] If we look at heaven and earth as father and mother, theysupport and nourish man’s body. All other man-made things are superfluous, notnecessary for maintaining life and procreating the species. (44.45) Instead,they lead to much deception and jealousy. They prevent the reign of peace andthe arrival of majestic qi. They disorder heaven’s way and leave the lord deeplyworried. Each man takes delight in what his feelings12 [Notes.xhtml#ch4fn12]approve of. Quite unrestrained, he is intent only on continuing the fun. This isthe reason why men meet with misfortune: the lord loses political authority andthe small man turns to robbery and other misconduct. All this happens becausethings for which there is no need are in demand.Thus the world experiences poverty and distress, and becomes desolate andwretched. Calamities and mutations occur all the time. Subordinates are eager13[Notes.xhtml#ch4fn13] to deceive their superiors. Everyone considers thisharmful. (44.46) It began a long time ago and is not just the fault of men, wholive nowadays in the times of late antiquity.14 [Notes.xhtml#ch4fn14] When meninherit and transmit these evils, they forget their original and true state.15[Notes.xhtml#ch4fn15] By indulging in what is frivolous and superficial theybring desolation and harm upon themselves and can’t finish the years heaven hasdesigned for them. The many activities latter-born men are involved in areneedless and risky. So men are always in a rush, unable to come to a halt.16[Notes.xhtml#ch4fn16]By conducting affairs through nonaction, men understood dao’s meaning in earlyantiquity.17 [Notes.xhtml#ch4fn17] They safeguarded the root and never neglectedthe three needs. Thus did they achieve heaven’s intentions. In middle antiquity,there were slightly too many activities and embellishments.18[Notes.xhtml#ch4fn18] In late antiquity, men [began to] worry far too much. Muchembellishment has brought forth corruption and fraud. Furthermore, men causedistress by trying to outdo each other, and they let corruption and jealousyarise in their midst. Within, they have lost their true state (shi 實) anddeparted from their root, which in turn has become damaged, leaving men confusedand disorderly. A lord might feel desolate and wish to put it right, but themany hundreds of thousands of embellishments can’t be overcome and they[continue] to bring disorder to his reign. Perfected, you must thoroughlyconsider what this means.Yes, indeed, I will!19 [Notes.xhtml#ch4fn19]"},{"pageContent":"SECTION 45THE THREE NEEDS AND THE METHOD OF [DEALING WITH] AUSPICIOUS AND OMINOUS EVENTSThe Master argues that the lives and growth of animals and plants might be atrisk should what is necessary be neglected and accessories become overbearing.The fact that human beings are in the same situation as the fauna and floraaround them lends strength to the warning issued in section 44: disaster beckonsshould human endeavors go beyond what men need to stay alive.It is argued that the damage—that is, the promotion of superfluous objects andactivities—has already been done. Safeguarding the three needs requiresreversing this tendency. This is, as the Master put it, an issue ofunderstanding: concern for what is superfluous impinges on proper understanding.Understanding must thus be restored through a definitive move from one polarentity to its opposite. This is expressed through the metaphor of turning fromthe branches to the root, a move that is seen as leading in a backwarddirection. The Master’s words resemble the advice given by Laozi when it talksabout turning back, for instance to childhood, in order to restore one’s energy.Going backwards also has a chronological aspect and involves a departure fromthe decadence of the present, called “late antiquity,” and a return to theattitudes of early antiquity.No proper insight can be expected when understanding is impeded, so whenobsessed with the “branches” men are bound to make the wrong decisions. Thispoint must have been of particular importance for the TPJ editors. The title ofthe section points to the problem of deciding what to do and what to avoid,although little space is reserved for it in the text.• • •(45.46) Perfected, step forward. How many big and how many small needs doanimals have? How much is there that is not a need?Well, each has its own needs, as if there were a thousand branches and tenthousand ramifications. (45.47)What do we call these needs?Each animal has its own aim; we can’t give them names.It is a shame you are so stupid! You were foolish before, but it has becomeworse!I am no good.If you call yourself no good, what are we supposed to say when common men goastray? This is really being no good!If the Celestial Master would only explain things to me, foolish and dumb as Iam!Well, all animals live as men do, in the dispensation of heaven and earth andYin and Yang. They also share the same needs—two big ones and one that issmaller.What do you mean?When animals first received the dispensation of Yin and Yang, they all exhaledand inhaled, took in the qi of what is as it is, and did not yet know eating anddrinking. In the course of time, when they moved away from their root, great daobegan to shrink and heaven’s qi could no longer watch over them, so they becamehungry and thirsty. Thus, heaven provided them with drink and food. It alsobecame necessary to continue the dispensation of Yin and Yang. So there are maleand female animals, and generation after generation they continue to bring forthoffspring. If one cut off their food and drink, and if they were to notreproduce by mixing Yin and Yang, then the world would be without animals. Theseare the two big needs.There is one small need. Animals have hair, feathers, or scales, but certainnaked worms also survive. However, with hair or feathers animals are much moreattractive (ke ai 可愛) and can withstand cold and heat. With scales, theywithstand all injury. Since they are not necessary for maintaining life, hair,feathers, and scales amount to a small need. All other elements invitemisfortune.1 [Notes.xhtml#ch5fn1] It is senseless and unreasonable not topreserve these three roots. Those who do so will die from it. That this is so(ziran 自然) is proclaimed by the model set up by heaven and earth. You must thinkabout what it means and maintain these three original activities so that youwill be where harmony (zhonghe 中和) prevails between heaven and earth. Shouldthere be much embellishment instead of these three [activities], we would allsuffer disaster.Excellent! I would beg to ask one question about what you have just said.Go ahead.Now, things that spread roots2 [Notes.xhtml#ch5fn2] and suspend branches do noteat, drink, or wear clothes. What then?Oh no! Instead of learning more each day, you know less and less.3[Notes.xhtml#ch5fn3]Why do you say that?[Plants] also have two big needs and one that is smaller.What do you mean?Listen carefully.Yes, I will.The ten thousand plants (wan wu 萬物) need rain to live. This is what they drinkand eat. They must have day and night and they must be in the sun and in theshade. During the day, Yang’s qi warms them; at night, Yin’s qi gives themmoisture. Thus they can grow by just staying where they are. This is how theyunite Yin and Yang. They suspend their branches and spread out theirleaves—these are their clothes. Some plants grow with many leaves, others withfew. Here lies for them [the difference between] substance and decoration.4[Notes.xhtml#ch5fn4] (45.48) Should rain not fall at the right time, the world’sten thousand plants would not grow. It would be a great disaster if the worldwere without one of its plants. So [rain] is a great need. Should [plants] nothave the alternation between day and night to unite the qi of Yin and Yang,nothing would ripen. It would be a great disaster if the world were without theproduce of plants. This is another great need. Plants with sparse foliage bearfruit, and so do plants with dense foliage. Since they all bear fruit, havingmany leaves is not a necessity. So [leaves] are a small need, while produce isthe main thing.Therefore, the wise men of old who preserved the three essentials (san shi 三實)brought great peace to their reign, found favor with heaven, and lived long andhappily until they completed the years heaven had destined for them. Substanceis enough; embellishments and the use of precious garments of dark and yellowsilk are not necessary. For this reason, should you be intrigued by thebranches, turn back to the center. Should you be intrigued by the center, thenturn back to the root. Should decorum (wen 文) fascinate you, turn back tosubstance. Should substance interest you, turn back to the basis. What is basichas the same origin as heaven and earth. Should someone’s vision whileconducting affairs become confused by [the situation] in late antiquity, let himreturn his thoughts to middle antiquity. If this confuses him, he should thinkof early antiquity. Should this irritate him, let him think back to the rulesand models proclaimed by heaven and earth. If he doubts their [validity] he willhave to go as far back as the shape of what is as it is. If what is as it isgives rise to doubt, one must let one’s thoughts return to supreme, primordial,numinous qi.5 [Notes.xhtml#ch5fn5]Thus, in antiquity the wise and worthy reigned by drinking and eating qi, satdeep in the dark chamber6 [Notes.xhtml#ch5fn6] to think of dao, took note of thesymptoms of gain and loss,7 [Notes.xhtml#ch5fn7] and did not dare depart by asmuch as the space taken up by a small silver coin from the models set up byheaven. Remaining pure and quiet sufficed to fulfill their intention. Theirreign set up peace, just like heaven and earth. If you would only ponder thewords I teach! You know, don’t you?Splendid!All right, now that you have understood, adapt my writings to the quelling ofdisorder. Try them out at once, without delay. Don’t hide this text; let all mensee for themselves that substance and decoration have lost their proper place.Let men ponder the text’s meaning. They must return to the Three Perfected[residing in their body],8 [Notes.xhtml#ch5fn8] so that they will not sufferbitterly from wicked fabrications (xie wei 邪 偽). Keep this in mind.Yes, I will.9 [Notes.xhtml#ch5fn9]"},{"pageContent":"SECTION 46YOU MUST NOT SERVE THE DEAD MORE THAN THE LIVINGThis section deals with funerary rituals and the ancestral cult. It argues thatmen suffer from the increasing presence of demons brought about by lavishsacrifices. Such a presence bodes evil because daytime and the walkways of lifebelong to the living. Should demons be about, their deadly qualities will causeillness and early death. The Master gives cosmological reasons for this: Life,Yang, and the sun must not be overpowered by death, Yin, and the night sky. Menmust not be misled by filial piety to trespass against this rule and allow thelove they feel for their parents to upset the cosmic balance. This is expressedin the rule that parents must not be served with more care when they aredeceased than while they were alive.While arguing his point, the Celestial Master conveys what knowledge there isabout life after death. The two dialogues combined in this section introduceconflicting models. One depicts the dead as continuing to exist and asinfluencing and being influenced by their progeny. The dead are said to beresponsible for their deeds still, to face interrogations, and to be in a stateof happiness or anxiety. This model is used throughout the TPJ to enforceallegiance to moral rules, as one’s deeds in life are expected to throw a shadowover the existence to come. Another model, which is consistent with Wang Chong’sview, regards demons as fictitious. These models are contradictory, but they areboth well within the framework of Han dynasty opinions about death. The aim ofthis section is not to determine the truth about the existence of demons, butrather to persuade men to focus on life and the living rather than on servingthe dead. Both models provide good arguments for a reduction in the scope ofrituals and offerings.The gist of this argument follows mainstream Han dynasty concerns. Emperors wereknown to be advocates for thriftiness. Guangwu (r. 26–57), for example, claimed,“All the world thinks that rich burials are honorable and thrifty funeralsdisgraceful. Thus the rich vie with each other in their extravagance, whereasthe poor spend their entire fortune.”1 [Notes.xhtml#ch6fn1] However, it was asfashionable to ignore such complaints as it was to lament funeral expenses.Liang Shang 粱商, the father-in-law of Emperor Shun (r. 125-44), demanded that nospecial food should be used for the sacrifices when he died.2[Notes.xhtml#ch6fn2] His wish was not granted. Cui Shi 崔寞(fl.145-67) condemnedlavish funerals in his writings yet laid waste his own fortune when burying hisfather.3 [Notes.xhtml#ch6fn3] Most arguments centered on economic issues, whichwere apparently put aside when filial piety demanded it. The TPJ includeseconomic considerations, but it also transcends them with its principledemphasis on the value of life. What is remarkable in this section is not themessage as such, but rather the line of argumentation. For cosmic reasons, theliving and their concerns demand such attention that their interests must beupheld even in the face of family obligations, the observation of filial piety,and other well-established moral norms.• • •(46.49) Step forward, Perfected.Yes.A filial son serves his parents. After they have died, he continues thisservice. Should it be what it was while they were alive?No. The son must serve his parents more than he did while they were alive.Why is this so?Man was brought to life and raised by his parents. When he sees them depart,never to return, in his heart he won’t be able to forget them, even for amoment. In life, they saw each other daily so that he would receive theirinstruction and announce his comings and goings. After death, they cannot seeeach other. He thinks of them with a deep sigh. Thus he should serve them morethan he did while they were alive.4 [Notes.xhtml#ch6fn4]So this is what you are saying, Perfected. It completely and utterly ignores thetrue essentials of heaven’s way. It is far, far distant from it. And yet, if youtalk like this, it is clear that the common people, dull as they are, mustignore the model set by heaven (tian fa 天法).What do you mean? If the Celestial Master would only . . .Well, when alive, men resemble heaven and belong to heaven. After death, theyresemble earth and belong to earth. While heaven is father, earth is mother. Oneshould not serve one’s mother more than one’s father. Men are Yang when they arealive, and after death they are Yin. One should not serve Yin more than Yang.Yang is in charge; Yin is the subordinate. One should not serve the subordinatemore than the person in charge. Serving Yin more than Yang brings about adverseqi. Serve Yin a little more and some adverse matters will arise. Serve it muchmore and there will be much that is adverse. We call this adverse qi and adverseadministration. The harm that results from it makes Yin qi overcome Yang,inferiors cheat their superiors, and demonic spirits and other evil creaturesexpand their activities. They take possession of the ways of men and often walkaround in broad daylight unafraid of men. So illness and disease don’t come to ahalt, nor does the lineup of demons come to a standstill. Do you reallycomprehend what a great crime this is?I am inadequate. I have made a mistake, haven’t I?5 [Notes.xhtml#ch6fn5] Nowthat I have heard what you have said this is painfully clear to me. The Masteris good enough to pity my tireless search and explain to me what I can’t grasp.But now this mistake is minute; how can it have such consequences?To serve Yin more than Yang and to serve a subordinate more than someone who issuperior is a big mistake. How can you call it minute when things have gone thatfar? Once again, you prove to be not good enough. Besides, when men are alive they are Yang, while demonic spirits are Yin.While alive, men belong to the day, and when dead they belong to the night. Youmust know that the issue is roughly the following. When the day is greatlyextended, the night is shortened, and when the night is made long, the daybecomes short. (46.50) When Yang expands, it overcomes its Yin. Yin then goesinto hiding and does not dare to appear at random.6 [Notes.xhtml#ch6fn6] Thusdemonic spirits of the dead are kept down. When Yin expands, it overcomes itsYang. Yang goes into hiding. Thus demonic spirits are seen in daylight. Butliving men are allied with the sun, while malignant demonic beings are alliedwith the stars. The sun is Yang; the stars are Yin. Therefore, when the sunappears, stars take flight, and when stars appear, the sun sets. So when Yin isoverpowering, demonic beings cause harm that is too grave to be described indetail. This is called expanding Yin and reducing Yang. It makes government losecontrol and injures the living. You must keep in mind that this is a veryserious mistake.Yes, I will. (46.51)Thus according to the regulations (zhi fa 制法) of heaven’s way the position ofYin should always be weaker than that of Yang. A subordinate, for instance,serves his lord obediently since he is the weaker of the two. As long as a sonis weaker than his parents, he serves them with great filial piety. Shouldsomeone have become stronger without adapting to the situation he would causemuch damage.7 [Notes.xhtml#ch6fn7] Thus, although he is full of compassion andlove and cannot forget his parents, the filial son must not serve them more thanhe did when they were alive. Do you now understand a little better?Yes, I do.Keep it in mind. You must under no circumstances act at random by simplyindulging your own wishes.8 [Notes.xhtml#ch6fn8]Yes, I understand.Should you wish to serve the dead more than the living you would trespassagainst heaven.9 [Notes.xhtml#ch6fn9]Why is this so?This is because you would be honoring Yin instead of Yang. We call this turningone’s back on those above and showing one’s face to those below. So it is anoffense against heaven.I am very guilty. If the Celestial Master could only forgive me!Never mind. But in what you write down everything must agree with the model [setup by heaven].10 [Notes.xhtml#ch6fn10]Yes. Now that the Celestial Master has begun to explain things, I would like toknow the full meaning of “the service must not go further than it did whileparents were alive.”Funeral ritual, garments, and accessories must not surpass what were used whileparents were alive or else it would be considered an adverse arrangement andwould inflict penalties on the dead. If you do not bury parents in line with thestatus under which they are registered in the records kept down below, suchpretense is investigated. Since it is viewed as deceitful conduct still heavierpunishment is inflicted on the dead.11 [Notes.xhtml#ch6fn11] Showing too muchrespect for such ominous activities brings about disaster and ruin. Ghostlydemons (shi gui 尸鬼) thrive, epidemics plague men, and there is an upsurge instrange and irregular events.How can one prove this?Very good, your question! The wise men of old were involved only with theirheart when attending to funerals and would never have dared to expand them. Forthem, burials were the world’s most ominous and hideous activity.12[Notes.xhtml#ch6fn12] They saw expanding an ominous activity as harmful. So,only their hearts were involved. They did not deem it wrong to provide the samefood and drink for the dead as they had enjoyed during their lifetime.Therefore, in those times men happily and in good health completed the yearsdestined for them by heaven.In middle antiquity, sons who arranged their parents’ funeral deviated slightlyfrom the proper model and measure. Since they could not put all their heart intoit, they forgot what it meant. Instead, showing a certain respect [for theseominous activities], they came to indulge in frivolous and superficial [habits],meant to oppress the living. (46.52) They thought of the dead onlyhalfheartedly, and only half of them came to partake in the food. Funeralarrangements moved away slightly from what they should have been. Oncesacrificial offerings were expanded, things got worse. Demons and spiritlikecreatures—who knows who they were—arrived on the scene to partake of the foodand remained there to pester men. This is why men fell ill more often.13[Notes.xhtml#ch6fn13]In late antiquity, men have inherited and passed on (cheng fu 承負) the smalldeviations of middle antiquity. They carry these on and add further bigdeviations. They don’t mourn their parents from the heart. Instead, they wish togreatly oppress the living. They produce splendor with spectators14[Notes.xhtml#ch6fn14] in mind.15 [Notes.xhtml#ch6fn15] They act withoutconsideration for the model [established by heaven] and contrive deceptions. Butthis can’t influence heaven. As for the dead, as demons they can’t come to mealsregularly. Yet sacrificial offerings are greatly expanded, in excess of theproper measure. Once a particular Yin is thus expanded, it will in turnforcefully shrink its Yang. Demons and spiritlike creatures—nobody knows whothey are—who assemble for these meals tend to become reckless and to act likepernicious bandits. Murders are rife. When they have killed a person they seethat their service is expanded, while nobody asks them to account for theircrimes. So why shouldn’t they carry on, with all their might? Therefore, evil qiincreases from day to day until it turns around to attack the person whoconducts the funeral sacrifice. There will be no end to this [as long asspirits] regularly obtain food and then follow the living in their walkways oflife.When Yin is strong Yang is weak, which is oppressive to the living. [It makes]subordinates and inferiors deceive their superiors, sons deceive their fathers,and it deprives the king’s reign of peace. But the people don’t comprehend. Soevil grows from day to day, out of control. This is why the wise and worthy ofold, with their clear understanding of [heaven’s] prohibitions, did not dare toserve the dead better than they had served the living. Perfected, are you reallyaware of this?How frightening! If you had not told me, being the fool I am, I would have hadno way of knowing.Step forward, Perfected!16 [Notes.xhtml#ch6fn16] You and I, we both share thesame concern. Heaven must have sent you to pose questions. We should not makelight of it. So I will tell you all, for the following reason: when qi ofhonesty and peace is about to arrive, all activities must be in compliance. Qiof honesty and peace would turn away if one single qi were adverse.17[Notes.xhtml#ch6fn17]What do you mean?Now we comply with heaven’s way by expanding Yang and reducing Yin. It isadverse to do the opposite.18 [Notes.xhtml#ch6fn18] Showing respect for ominousactivities brings forth qi that is prone to disaster. It causes government (zhiluan 治亂) to lose authority (zheng wei 政位). This is no small mistake. (46.53) You must not hide these writings but must make them known and let every mansee for himself their merits and shortcomings. But it is not just the mistake ofheaven, earth, or the sovereign19 [Notes.xhtml#ch6fn19] if the conduct ofaffairs is not well coordinated. Blame lies also with the hundred families.Every individual (renren 人人) has committed errors, which are increasing as theyare inherited and passed on. It all comes from not sticking to what isessential. Turn away from what is essential, distance yourself from the root,and you will turn to fraud and thus become ignorant of yourself.What do you mean?Life is man’s root; death is the subject of false reports.20[Notes.xhtml#ch6fn20]Why “false reports”?Essentially, we don’t have a clue as to what the deceased might want. In orderto gain some knowledge, the living paint images of their appearance at random,going far beyond what they were in life. We behold these lies rather than whatis essential and crucial. Once men die, their hun spirit returns to heaven whiletheir bones and flesh, which belong to earth, rot to dust.21[Notes.xhtml#ch6fn21] How can we imagine that a vital spirit should be able toeat something if we can’t even imagine that it can make an appearance?22[Notes.xhtml#ch6fn22] Bones and flesh no longer exist, they return to earth,man’s true mother. Men’s life takes place between heaven and earth; why shouldtheir root be different from what it was during their lifetime, involving tasksthat nobody knows? Thus the filial son serves his parents as is proper in regardto their root, and will thus do what is essential. What they did not enjoy whilealive they will not be able to experience in death. So offerings must not gobeyond their style of life, or else23 [Notes.xhtml#ch6fn23] many strange andirregular events will occur. Do you understand? Heed my words!Yes. I will do so. Excellent! The truth has come out.We may say that you know. You may go.Yes.24 [Notes.xhtml#ch6fn24]"},{"pageContent":"SECTION 47HOW TO VERIFY THE TRUSTWORTHINESS OF TEXTS AND WRITINGSThis section promotes the nourishing of the vital principle as the basis for allsocial and political reform.1 [Notes.xhtml#ch7fn1] This point lies within thecore tradition of the Laozi’s political philosophy and has repercussionsthroughout ancient thought, for instance, in Mengzi’s interest in haoran zhi qi浩然之氣. Moreover, as Huan Tan (ca. 43 B.C.E.— 28 C.E.) informs us, this was thetechnique that men who studied the Laozi expected to learn.2[Notes.xhtml#ch7fn2] However, this section does not define or discuss the term,but merely establishes it as central.Disciple and Master discuss two objections that can be made to taiping beliefs.One is related to the apparent contradiction that texts, which are produced withthe aim of redeeming the world, deal with issues of lifestyle, personaldiscipline, and longevity techniques, that is, with nourishing the vitalprinciple. The Master explains that someone who can’t properly look after hisown person can’t take care of the world. Another objection concerns the wayheaven handles the world’s wrongdoings. It is argued that heaven does not knowabout these wrongdoings, does not care, and does not retaliate. The Masterexplains that natural disasters pronounce heaven’s judgment and that it is man’sfault when these are not properly interpreted. Taiping- related writings, ifread carefully, can make men aware of these issues.• • •(47.54) This ignorant pupil’s blindness is getting worse from day to day. I bowtwice before you. Now there is another question that I would like to ask theCelestial Master, the spiritlike man of supreme majesty.What is it?I would like to ask about these writings. In general terms, why have they beencreated, why have they been published?Good! We may say that by the way you ask you show some understanding for whatmajestic heaven thinks. The gist of these writings is to provide redemption.3[Notes.xhtml#ch7fn3] Since the origin of heaven and earth, emperors, kings, andtheir people have both received and transmitted evil. It is for this reason thatthese writings have been published.But if they have been published for this reason, why do they first of all teachhow to nourish the vital principle?4 [Notes.xhtml#ch7fn4]Yes, you have always been truly foolish and dumb, your vision blurred and yourunderstanding hampered. Otherwise a listener might take what you have just saidfor modesty. But are you really and truly blind and dumb? Are you?Yes, I am.Perfected, you must open your ears and listen carefully. Now the people are toblame because they are not good at nourishing their own person. They arepunished by the reception and transmission [of evil] because they have all lostdirection. Compare this to the case of a father and mother who, in neglect ofmoral obligations, have trespassed against their neighbors and whose sons andgrandsons will later on be injured by those same neighbors. This indicates thepunishment involved in receiving and transmitting [evil]. If the former kings intheir government did not match the thoughts and intentions of heaven and earth,it was not because a single individual would have upset heaven. (47.55) Sinceheaven was annoyed and angry, plagues, diseases, and natural calamities occurredin ten thousand different forms. Those who later came to the throne continued toreceive and transmit [evil]. Should this not be brought to a halt? So the bookhas been published precisely for this purpose. Thus it says: The great worthiesof antiquity originally all knew the way of nourishing their own person. So theyunderstood the purpose of government and suffered hardly any loss from thereception and transmission [of evil]. In the generations that followed, masterswho instructed others would often hide texts on the true and essentialteachings. They transmitted instead frivolous and superficial teachings. Thusmen trespassed against the essential aim of the way of heaven, which causedlater generations to become more frivolous and shallow until they were unable tonourish and cherish their own person. Since this went on for a long period, theymoved away from dao. That is to say that the world lost the art by which menretain their person safe and complete. This gave rise to a neglect of affairs, afight for income and position, and thus the calamity of receiving andtransmitting [evil]. How can you be [un]aware of what it means “to provideredemption”? (47.56)Excellent! To hear the Celestial Master speak is like the appearance of the sunwhen the clouds open up—it is in no way different.Fine, let us assume that you have now grasped what the doctrine (dao) means.This foolish pupil is grateful for your kindness and has already learned a lot.If my questions do not suffice, would the Celestial Master please continue toreprimand and to warn me?Yes. A man can only nourish others when he can thoroughly nourish his ownperson. A man can only cherish others when he can truly cherish himself.5[Notes.xhtml#ch7fn5] If someone having a body6 [Notes.xhtml#ch7fn6] were toneglect it, how should he, unable to nourish his own person, be capable ofnourishing someone else well? If he were not able to keep his own body intact bytruly cherishing it in order to carefully safeguard the ancestral line, howcould he take care of others and keep them intact?How foolish I am.Don’t you think that you should better comprehend it more fully?Yes, very well.Fine. You propose that my writings cannot be trusted. Imagine you checked frombeginning to end all the texts that in early antiquity were seen to match thethoughts of heaven and prolong happiness. Imagine that you also checked thetexts written on bamboo slips that in middle antiquity were judged to match thethoughts of heaven, and the texts that in late antiquity are consideredimportant for complying with the will of heaven and prolongingself-preservation. You would find them all adhering to the same universalstandards. As your blindness dissolves, you will have great trust in the wordsof my book.Now that heaven is angry with men, these later generations have become morecareless and easygoing every day. They risk their lives to test their talents.Some very foolish people say that heaven is without knowledge and claim that itdoes not retaliate. But earth does not deceive men. If you sow millet, you willharvest millet, and if you sow wheat, you will harvest wheat. If you work hard,your harvest will be good. How much more so for heaven! These very foolishpeople do not know that heaven is filled with strong resentment. They go onteaching each other to take things easy and act foolishly. In later generationsthis increases from day to day. It brings about large numbers of calamities,irregular events, disasters, and anomalies.7 [Notes.xhtml#ch7fn7] These are, infact, the profound favors that heaven bestows on a ruler, in the same way thatfather and son instructing each other is a sign of kindness between them. When afoolish person observes such disasters, he will not announce them to the rulerin good time but will instead keep them hidden. Thus he will cut off a path toheaven, which will increase heaven’s rage. After this, any increase in thereception and transmission of evil can no longer be influenced. Even an emperoror king who had the moral goodness of ten thousand men would continue to sufferfrom it, for no particular reason. Thus, one might be led to presume that to dogood is unreasonable, as it does not bring any benefit. This enables the veryfoolish to say that heaven is without knowledge. Truly, how could there be anygrounds for such a claim!When I hear the words of the Celestial Master my heart is enlightened as if Ihad been born again. Excellent, indeed! Although this has often caused theCelestial Master trouble, I have at all costs asked questions. (47.57) If I wasmistaken to start with I have now, after all the questioning, understood themeaning of “redemption.” I feel happy and without regret. Not to ask about whatone does not know means that one has no way of getting there.What you have said is right. You may go. The writings are in all respects ready;from head to foot, from belly to back, and from outside to inside they arecomplete, and they will on their own inform all worthy people. There is no needfor further questions.Yes.8 [Notes.xhtml#ch7fn8]"},{"pageContent":"SECTION 48AN EXPLANATION OF THE RECEPTION AND TRANSMISSION [OF EVIL] IN FIVE SITUATIONSThe term “reception and transmission [of evil]” (cheng fu 承負), used only in theTPJ, is central to its doctrine. It points to evil deeds, which in taipingterminology are violations of heaven committed in the past and inherited by thepresent. These violations have resulted in a continuous chain of evil thatreaches far into the past and is continuously carried on and reinforced, with noend in sight. Humankind is doomed once these evil deeds have accumulated to acertain extent. This concept contributes greatly to the text’s millenarianmessage and is one of the two reasons given for the need to initiate a taipingmovement (the other reason was that calculations of cosmic cycles suggested thata new beginning, a great peace, was possible).That there will be an end to the process of inheriting evil is the message ofsalvation the Celestial Master has come to proclaim. This section argues that aproper understanding of cheng fu is in itself a means to halt at leastreinforcement of the chain. If people aren’t aware that the world’s troublesstem from the faults of their ancestors, they might unjustly accuse theircontemporaries. This would cause resentment, which in itself enlarges the loadof evil. Much of the text dwells on the fact that jie, “to analyze,” also means“to abolish,” and, as in the preceding section, it is not always clear whetherthe analysis of cheng fu or its abolition is thematized.The origin of the term “reception and transmission [of evil]” lies in the beliefthat the good and bad deeds of ancestors influence the fate of theirdescendants. This is hinted at in the Book of Changes.1 [Notes.xhtml#ch8fn1] Butwhile the term’s origin lies in the family tradition, the TPJ transforms it intosomething of concern to humankind, at least in its layer A material.2[Notes.xhtml#ch8fn2] The abolition of the evils inherited from the past and thusthe avoidance of an apocalyptic end is the main aim of the Celestial Master’smissionary activities. His presence, the disciples’ study, their subsequentpromotion of the doctrine, and finally the policy reforms that can be expectedto result from this are all geared toward saving the world from cheng fu and itsconsequences.Since cheng fu is more a societal than an individual issue, standard proceduresfor healing illness and ensuring good luck are inadequate. This doesn’t makethem obsolete, of course, but it limits their effectiveness. Individual healingand salvation processes are hampered by the general prevalence of evil. However,in lieu of general conversion, an individual’s practice of meditation, and inparticular the technique of guarding the one— that is, concern for the coherenceand cooperation of all the spiritual and physical elements that together make upa person—can help.• • •(48.57) This slow-witted pupil bows twice before the Celestial Master and says:If a person of great worth hears how a teacher discusses one positive aspect, hewill know all four. If a person of lesser worth hears how a teacher discussesone negative aspect, he will know all four.3 [Notes.xhtml#ch8fn3] Thus itbecomes easy to discuss matters. But I am so foolish and slow-witted that unlessan issue has been discussed I continue to be in doubt. So I dare to ask aquestion: You have explained how majestic heaven hates the reception andtransmission [of evil], how the august earth puts forward natural disasters inresponse to it, how emperors and kings suffer from it, what wrongdoings itevokes among the hundred families, and how it afflicts the twelve thousandplants and beings with punishment.He says moreover:4 [Notes.xhtml#ch8fn4] This very foolish pupil is askingquestions because heaven wants me to do so. So I would not dare risk leavingsomething unmentioned but want to hear the meaning of everything.What is it? Speak freely.If emperors and kings as well as the people receive [evil] and pass it on, doall situations contain their own element of such reception and transmission?Good. The question you have raised on behalf of heaven is sincere, detailed, andcircumspect.Now whenever I meet the Celestial Master it is always understood that I raisequestions concerning doubtful matters only because heaven demands it. So howcould I dare not to be detailed?Good. Your intentions are reverent and honest. Let us proceed according tocertain situations. Or would you prefer to have me explain it all in full? Iwould not mind the exertion, but I am afraid a text that is too long might bedifficult to put to use. (48.58) If I were to interpret all the world’sreception and transmission [of evil], this would be difficult to manage in thatten million characters would still be too few. I will present you with anoutline and we will then let everyone who is worthy join the project so that ouraim will be reached, as if by contract.If only the Celestial Master would speak!You must keep both your ears open, sit still, and listen with a calm heart.Yes, I will.Although heaven and earth have given birth to all plants and beings, they alsocause injury when virtue is lacking. Thus the world is in disorder as if it wereclouded. Families are poor and needy, the old and the weak are hungry and cold,county offices derive no income, the granaries have been emptied. Although suchevil stems from the earth inflicting harm on plants, men receive and transmitit. The consequences for one case have now been explained. You must continue tolisten carefully.If one teacher addressing ten students should misrepresent the facts and the tenstudents in turn each addressed ten students, this would amount to one hundredmen speaking falsely. If these hundred men were each to address ten men, thiswould amount to one thousand men giving wrong accounts. If one thousand men wereto each address ten men, there would be ten thousand men speaking falsely. Ifall these ten thousand men were to raise their voices to the four directions,the world as a whole would speak falsely.He says moreover:5 [Notes.xhtml#ch8fn5] Should a large number of words fromvarious traditions support each other, they would become irrefutable and beconsidered standard language. This goes back to one single person having missedthe truth in what he said. But in turn this made all these men miss the truth,which upset the validity of the correct texts revealed by heaven. This would bethe reason why customs would be altered and habits changed. Although the worldmight see all this as a great ill, they would be unable to bring it to a halt.It would get worse over time because distress would be transmitted from onegeneration to the next. Clearly, this would not be a mistake committed just bylater generations. [However], these later generations would not know that thepoint from which it came lay in the distance. Instead, they would hold theircontemporaries responsible, thereby intensifying the resentment between them.This in turn would not allow the knots in which qi had gotten tangled to beuntied but would make them daily more resistant.6 [Notes.xhtml#ch8fn6] Two caseshave been explained now, but you must continue to listen carefully.Imagine if someone were to put on a great show in the center of town, whereroads from all directions cross, in order to trick people. He would proclaimthat the earth was flooded and was about to turn into a lake. He might even shedtears while speaking. The people would tell others as they returned home fromthe market; a thousand households would all learn about it, the aged as well asthe infirm, grownups as well as children discussing it at the crossroads untilthe whole world knew. But once the world had been deceived, this deception wouldincrease as if distance made it grow. It stemmed from the words of one man, soresponsibility for this deception rests entirely with the receiving andtransmitting of empty and false words. What mistake would later generations havecommitted? The mistake of blaming their contemporaries. Now three situationshave been explained. However, you must continue to listen carefully.There is a large tree in the southern mountains, a tree that is so wide and longthat it forms a ceiling over several hundred paces of ground although it has asingle trunk. Above the ground, it has innumerable branches, leaves, and fruits,all of which may suffer injury from storms and rain should the root below theground not cling tightly to the soil. (48.59) If this were the case all the manymillions of branches, leaves, and fruits would die from such injury. This is thebig evil that is received and transmitted by the ten thousand plants and trees.This evil lies with the root and not with the branches. But if the branches7[Notes.xhtml#ch8fn7] were accused instead, wouldn’t they be even moregrief-stricken?But if the branches are without fault, there is no reason why they should sufferdeath from such disasters.This is exactly what the punishment of receiving and transmitting [evil] is allabout. How can one accuse the latter-born? Four situations have been explained.You must, however, continue to listen carefully.The southern mountains harbor poisonous qi that they don’t lock up very well.Thus, in spring, winds from the south bring disease and will even hide the sunand the moon. Large numbers of people become infected and die.8[Notes.xhtml#ch8fn8] At the root is nothing else but the qi released by thesouthern mountains. What reason should there be to let all the world receive andtransmit a deadly disease? People of our times will, however, discuss thismatter as if there had been some moral transgression and heaven were killingbecause it found fault with a certain person. How should this not bring aboutgrief? If someone has received and transmitted this disaster with-out havingdone any wrong, his spirit will remain resentful [after death]. Thus the livingwill heap even more accusations on him. Grief-stricken qi will affect heavenabove. All this distress is rooted in the mountains’ bad qi that is carried bythe wind. It is the same with the punishment of receiving and transmitting[evil].Five situations have been explained, but you must continue to sit straight andlisten to the particulars I shall speak about. All that was taught wasoriginally reliable and correct and never corrupt, false, and deceptive. But dueto what former kings, teachers, and fathers had taught, men lost a little ofthis correctness, that is, they lost the correct way of expression as well asthe correct way of nourishing their own person. (48.60) Since men learn fromimitating each other it became worse from day to day for those born later. Thisis why over a long period nothing of what they taught each other has been true.They don’t have the means to stop the world from being false. Thus naturalcalamities and disasters occur by the ten thousand, impossible to record. Theircauses have been added one to the other over a long time, again and again. Yetfoolish men know no better than to find fault with their own leaders and to makeaccusations against their contemporaries. So how can they avoid becoming evenmore grief-stricken? Men are wrong, all of them, and can’t on their own find outwhat is right. Even if a single emperor or king had the virtue of ten thousandmen, his faculties would be only what they are. So what could he do? How can onefind a solution for the conduct of men nowadays? Or supposing that there is foodand people wish to get all of it for themselves, so that only the sick cannoteat and end up dying. How can there be any solution? When in intercourse youreach a climax you look forward to having sons and grandsons. You might bringofferings to the deities and beg for happiness but still be unable to havechildren. How can there be any solution? When men have children they want themto be good and strong, but they might in fact be unworthy of their parents andturn out to be bad. How can there be any solution? All this is proof of thereception and transmission [of evil]. But to turn around and accuse one’scontemporaries will only destabilize the government. The men of our times havesuffered from corruption and fraud for so long. How should they all of a suddenbe capable of reform? This has led to such ongoing grief that heaven is takingpity. Thus you must not be surprised should highest majestic dao in concert withprimordial qi descend upon us.Where should we begin?By guarding the one in your thoughts.9 [Notes.xhtml#ch8fn9]How?One is the beginning of all figures and the way of life (生之道); it gives rise toprimordial qi and is the hawser of heaven. Therefore, if you keep thinking ofthe one, you move from high above to affect changes down below. But the tenthousand beings make the mistake of stressing what equates to the boughs andbranches of an activity instead of referring back to its root. A return to theroot is even more appropriate so long as these errors remain unresolved.Thus when the wise men of antiquity were about to take action, they examined thepatterns of the sky (tian wen 天文) and investigated the structures of the earth.This clearly proves that they went back to the root of things. (48.61) Do youunderstand?Yes, I do.Now out of consideration for your distress I have spelled out the gist of thedoctrine of receiving and transmitting [evil].10 [Notes.xhtml#ch8fn10] Do youcomprehend that all situations in this way involve this reception andtransmission?Yes. Now that you have given me the gist of it, the knot in this foolish pupil’smind has become untied.Fine. The essential message is the following: In early antiquity, men able tobring peace to their reign through their grasp of dao were merely engaged innourishing their own person and preserving their root. In middle antiquity, whentheir grasp slackened, they became a little careless in regard to nourishingtheir own person and lost their root slightly. In late antiquity, plans were notwell drafted and men held their bodies in little esteem, arguing that they couldget another one. Thus, by erring greatly they brought disorder upon theirgovernment. Nevertheless, this is not the mistake committed by the people oflate antiquity, but the mistake results from the misery of receiving andtransmitting [evil]. All right. Since this has been said repeatedly, I willspeak no further. There is nothing to be gained from saying the same thing ahundred times. Now that heaven’s words have reached you, there is no need forfurther additions to this text.Yes.You may go; return home to think about the essentials [of this message]. Ifgiven to a virtuous lord, these writings should dissolve [explain] the receptionand transmission [of evil].Yes, indeed!11 [Notes.xhtml#ch8fn11]"},{"pageContent":"SECTION 50AN EXPLANATION OF THE MASTER’S DECLARATIONThe Master’s Declaration is a prophetic text consisting of thirteen lines ofseven characters each that describes the fate of society in general and thechances for individual happiness.1 [Notes.xhtml#ch9fn1] The wording suggeststhat both the short Declaration as well as its exegesis issue from the CelestialMaster, who uses the phrase “my declaration.” The Master’s Declaration is almosttoo vague to attempt a translation, but it must not be left out if we are topresent the full spectrum of the original text. It characterizes the transcriptsof the Celestial Master’s words as exegetical, clarifying, man-made texts asopposed to the revealed, cryptic, even sacred Declaration, which was adopted andpropagated rather than created by the Master. The following translation of thewhole section relies heavily on Max Kaltenmark’s work.2 [Notes.xhtml#ch9fn2] Thetranslation of the text of the Declaration is dependent on the “explanations”that follow.The topic of the section is the salvation promised to men who convert to theMaster’s doctrine. Since the language of both the Declaration and theExplanation is cryptic, as befits prophetic utterances and prognostic exegeses,a synopsis in plain language seems justified.What the Master says is useful and necessary. It is said at the right point intime, that is, when the phase of fire is strong, as it was seen to be during thelater Han period. Order can be established through words only. These must berecited and remembered but not put to use until the time is ripe. Man’shappiness consists in living long in this world. Proper government and promotionof the true doctrine enable him to do so. This message is adorned by threeimages, two of which—the great capital city of Chang’an and thelife-strengthening Queen Mother of the West, friend of Emperor Wu—can be seen asrelated to the Han court. The other is the harmonious sequence of the fourseasons, which establishes the time for men’s activities and expectations. TheDeclaration is supposed to be entrusted to experts in vitality techniques (fangshi 方士) to make it public; this is the group of people who might be said to havecreated the Daoist religion.This section is isolated from previous sections but is linked to the one thatfollows. Or rather, irrelevant as this short section’s contents might be, theauthor of the following section 51 seems to contrive a link by mentioning thatit should follow section 50, which is one of the TPJ’s most important sections.The editors have respected this wish. The composition and publication of theDeclaration are described as if they had preceded the meetings between Masterand disciples and the creation of the TPJ. The Declaration is quoted in section212, which in itself is central to taiping cosmological beliefs. The passage“Doesn’t the Declaration of the Celestial Master say ‘Bing, wu, ding and siserve as ancestors, as the beginning’?”3 [Notes.xhtml#ch9fn3] seems to be theonly instance where one passage of the TPJ explicitly refers to another.The Declaration shares a number of features with prognostic literature: a poeticstyle; an interest in the dissection of characters and in the assortment ofheavenly stems and earthly branches; an alternative use of names and concepts;an indirect, enigmatic way of expression; a quotation from the Book of Changes;and a certain attention to time and place that is otherwise rare in the TPJ.However, I have not been able to detect any direct parallels in the apocryphalmaterial published by Yasui Kōzan and Nakamura Shōhachi. This seems to hold truefor the whole of the TPJ. While it certainly shares aspects of the view of thecosmos and its processes expressed in Han dynasty apocrypha as well as some oftheir language,4 [Notes.xhtml#ch9fn4] it does not have passages in common withthem. For the worldview of the TPJ as well as for early religious Daoism ingeneral another set of ideas became crucial. These ideas are hinted at in theDeclaration when it uses terms like “transcendent” (xian 仙), “healing illness,”and “expert in vitality techniques.” The Explanation adds to this the terms“dao,” “heaven,” “the virtuous ruler,” “the inheriting and transmitting ofevil,” and “the abolition of evil,” which are central to the Celestial Master’smessage of salvation.The section consists of two more short passages, which do not belong to theExplanation. They inform us that the Celestial Master’s teacher is heaven andthat the combination of the inheritance and transmission of evil makes evil aspersistent as it is. Although these passages do not belong here, they also donot seem to belong anywhere else, and if we accept the proposition that the textis based on transcripts of real meetings, then student-instigated changes oftopic as documented in this section are plausible.• • •(50.63) The Perfected, beating his head on the ground, bows twice before theMaster.Yes?There is a problem I would like to ask about.Speak up! What is it?You have previously given me, foolish and incompetent as I am, a declaration inninety characters. With due respect I put my mind to it in the dark chamber,refraining from all activities for days on end. But I am by nature dull-witted.I thought about it day and night with unremitting effort, in full concentration,my heart exhausted—in no way at all could I understand what it said. Now if theCelestial Master would only take pity on me, incompetent as I am! I wish youwould explain it all to me so that it could be fixed for ten thousand times tenthousand generations and never be forgotten.This is a good question. We may say that you are someone who is in harmony withheaven.5 [Notes.xhtml#ch9fn5] Yes. Listen carefully. I will explain to you themain ideas. (50.64)(a) “The Master says: The characters I have put down are the ten and are theone.6 [Notes.xhtml#ch9fn6] Understand them and you have feet to stand on.”“Master” is in correct terms the “master spiritlike man of majestic heaven.”7[Notes.xhtml#ch9fn7] “To say” is “words.” I took leave8 [Notes.xhtml#ch9fn8]from heaven and was sent here in person to explain all details to emperors,kings, and the ten thousand people in order to redeem the million and tenthousand generations from the faults they receive and transmit (cheng fu zhi zhe承負之謫). “Me” (wu 吾) is “I” (wo 我), “I” is a spiritlike man sent on an urgentmission by heaven. Nowadays heaven spreads the calamities that are received andtransmitted (cheng fu zhi zai 承負之災) to the four directions. In the beginning,rulers stuck to the root, but in later times they forfeited their reigns as aconsequence of these calamities. They had no way to bring them to a standstill.Instead, they robbed and injured others and thus caused even more harm. Now thisworries heaven deeply. “Characters” are the characters of the compilation (leiji累積) of celestial writings (tian shu 天書), which I am now in the process ofexplaining. “Ten” means that the writings match heaven in a perfect, sincere,faithful, and identical manner, without the slightest mistake. They don’tmislead, not in a single case. As soon as worthy men obtain them they will thinkdeeply about what their ancestors have inherited and transmitted. If they recitethem without cease all evil that has been inherited and transmitted, whether bigor small, will be completely abolished.9 [Notes.xhtml#ch9fn9] “One” means thatfor dao to be standard we must begin with guarding the one. Someone who sticksto it without fail will become more enlightened day by day so that even thegreatest illusion10 [Notes.xhtml#ch9fn10] is dissolved. “Understand them and youhave feet to stand on”: “to stand on” (zhi 止) means “feet.”11[Notes.xhtml#ch9fn11] Feet make beings (sheng 生) walk. Once someone walks onthis way (dao 道) he gains ever more clarity. Never again is he foolishly in thedark. “Ten and one” means “expert” (shi 士),12 [Notes.xhtml#ch9fn12] “understandthem and you have feet to stand on” means “red” (chi 赤).13 [Notes.xhtml#ch9fn13]This is to say that through these writings qi of red flourishes again and reigns(wang 王) with great brightness (da ming 大明).14 [Notes.xhtml#ch9fn14] “To standon” (zhi 止) is the feet of the ten thousand beings. These beings start withgerms. When they spread out threads to form a root, “feet” grow. The method (法)of walking on this way15 [Notes.xhtml#ch9fn15] is to take primordial qi as theroot. Then [a man] is in favor with heaven and earth (de tian di xin 得天地心).Since this is best, we call it the way of supreme majesty (shang huang zhi dao上皇之道).(b) “Bing [the third celestial stem], wu [the fourth terrestrial branch], ding[the fourth celestial stem], and si [the sixth terrestrial branch] serve asancestors, as the beginning.” Bing, wu, ding, and si are [like] fire and red.Bing and wu are pure Yang, ding and si pure Yin.16 [Notes.xhtml#ch9fn16] Yin andYang are in command of harmonizing everything. It is said that the world wouldthrive should qi of Yin and Yang be together in harmony. “Serve as” (wei 為) isto benefit (wei li 為利) emperors and kings and free them from disaster and harm.“Ancestor” is “predecessor,” which is to resemble the Three Majestic Rulers invirtue.17 [Notes.xhtml#ch9fn17] “Beginning” is to return to where the rootbegan. Someone who walks on this way (dao) is bound to return to [what thingswere like under] supreme majesty. (50.65)(c) “Once you conduct matters through the four [strokes] and ‘mouth’ the tenthousand beings will be in order.” The four [strokes] will become “to say” (言)when they are added to “mouth” (口). Should you manage to daily practice sayingthe words that I have written, you would take possession of the characters of ascripture that is as correct as is heaven and would be led to understandheaven’s full meaning. When, in communion with the intentions of heaven above,the ten thousand beings are each in their place there is no further uproar (luan亂). For this reason it has been said that the ten thousand beings are in order.(d) “‘Son’ (zi 子) and ‘turban’ (jin 巾), which use the character ‘horn’ (jue 角)to control their right side, amount to the character ‘to recite ‘ (song 誦).”18[Notes.xhtml#ch9fn18] This means that once you recite these writings withoutend, all matters will be in unison, and standard. Up on high you will gainheaven’s approval; greatly pleased, it will forever be happy. No remnants ofanything improper will be left.19 [Notes.xhtml#ch9fn19](e) “As long as the dragon is asleep don’t make use of it.20[Notes.xhtml#ch9fn20] The humble sets the rule.”21 [Notes.xhtml#ch9fn21] “Thedragon is asleep” means that celestial qi has returned to a position where nineis at the beginning. The jiazi 甲子 year is like the day of the winter solstice22[Notes.xhtml#ch9fn22] and exactly the point from which heaven and earth begin.“Dragon” is the small Yang in the east; it is vital spirit of wood. Thusheaven’s way through its origin in wood promotes the phase of fire. As soon asplants and other beings are about to grow they must open the gates and movethrough. Perfected, at the end of the month, when the moon is full, you mustpublish these writings in a place that opens up brightness.23[Notes.xhtml#ch9fn23] (50.66) To open is to unlock, to pass through, to getthere, that is, to open to the south24 [Notes.xhtml#ch9fn24] and to make the qiof Yang even more pervading. This ends the evil that has been inherited andtransmitted. “To sleep” is to be stored away. Although dao has already arrived,it has gone back into hiding. “Don’t” is “not to dare to,” “not yet.” This iswhen you first see the text and don’t yet know how to implement it. “To make useof” is “to rule by it,” “to make serve.” Nowadays heaven makes use of thesewritings in order to abolish natural calamities and other harmful events. Atxuanjia 玄甲 a year brings them forth.25 [Notes.xhtml#ch9fn25] At this time, thelord has not yet understood their meaning well enough to enable him to make useof them. For this reason is it said “don’t make use.” On seeing the celestialtext, one does not dare trust it completely but will investigate how to use it.When one puts trust in its use, the arrangements one has made will drawresponses as if by echo. This proves the text right. Such a response is derivedfrom the unison with heaven.“The humble (kan 飲) sets rules (ji 紀)”26 [Notes.xhtml#ch9fn26] means that zi子[the first branch] is called humble. The stem jia is heaven; it is the generalguideline (gang 綱), it is Yang. The kan symbol is the branch zi,27[Notes.xhtml#ch9fn27] water, Yin, and sets rules in detail ( ji 紀). Thus heavenand earth are forever in unison; their rules and guidance begin in xuanjia, atthe winter solstice and in a jiazi year. Since the kan symbol can guide anddirect the reign of a virtuous lord it is said that the humble sets the rules.What we call the writings of highest majestic heaven have been published for thebenefit of the virtuous lord. The true scripture (zhen jing shu 真經書) serves torectify, to cut out what is evil. Its subtle beginnings lie in xuanjia. Sinceall living beings take their origin from jia and their root from zi, they arederived from jia and zi at the top.28 [Notes.xhtml#ch9fn28](f) “What a man may look at is longevity, old age, duration.” To be precise,“man” refers to emperors and kings, to the “single man.”29 [Notes.xhtml#ch9fn29]“Man” is of highest virtue, finds it easy to learn, and knows how to implementthe writings revealed by dao. Once you rely on propitious signs and agree with[heaven’s] patterns, you will have no doubt as to heaven’s way. Should you fullyunderstand its intentions you will live long. “Longevity” means that you finishthe years heaven has destined for you. “To enjoy old age” means that thisdoesn’t exhaust you. “To endure” means that you continue to exist.(g) “One lives only between heaven and earth.” “To be between” means to besituated. Someone who only lives situated between heaven and earth must learnthe true doctrine (dao). Frivolous and superficial texts don’t help men to livelong. There is always the evil that is inherited and transmitted. For this wemust blame doctrines (dao 道) that lack proper substance. Now heaven willeradicate them.(h) “Through proper government (zhi 治) millions of men (bai wan ren 百萬人) areabout to become transcendents.” “To govern” means to rectify. (50.67) With thesewritings, heaven rectifies the heart of each worthy man to let him heal hisillness, maintain truth, and abolish evil. “Men are about to becometranscendents” means that the world has heard about it. The true doctrine (dao)has come forth in full so that it might assist the virtuous lord in his reign.The true doctrine is how a man’s life is strengthened. Therefore we may say“that they are about to become transcendents.”(i) “Someone apt at healing illness doesn’t tell lies.”30 [Notes.xhtml#ch9fn30]Foolish as men are they don’t think for themselves, but in their folly they relyon deceptive forgeries to tell lies. (50.68) How sad! In return, they areseverely accused by heaven and create a big load of evil that is transmitted andinherited. For this reason heaven demands that frivolous and superficial textsbe discarded. Let each man preserve what is true and essential and safeguard theone [message it conveys]. Let him work at this with energy from morning tonight, and he will find it profitable and never again agree to tell lies.31[Notes.xhtml#ch9fn31](j) “Joyful indeed is the town of long-lasting security (chang an 長安)!”32[Notes.xhtml#ch9fn32] “Joy” means that no joy is greater than the arrival of qiof great peace [that has been installed by] supreme majestic heaven. Hu 乎(indeed) is as in the phrase “Indeed (jietan 嗟嘆), his virtue is excellent,without parallel!”33 [Notes.xhtml#ch9fn33] “Long” means that while he walks onthis way his virtue and goodness will last without fail. “Security” means thatthere is no longer any risk of destruction. Once someone walks on this way allthe accusations by heaven and earth that he has received and is transmittingcease. Long-lasting security reaches far and wide. All worries come to an end.Towns are the places where the men of this world assemble. To implement whatthese writings say means that a country’s population grows and becomes numerous,similar to the men in a city or town.(k) “To let men live as long as the Kingly Mother of the West”:34[Notes.xhtml#ch9fn34] “To let men” means to let emperors and kings have virtuethat derives from heaven and to favor men who live by the standard text (zhengwen 正文). “As” means “to follow.” Once emperors and kings are able to do most ofwhat my writings say, heaven’s way prevails. Act like this and you have greatgood luck; don’t and you will be blamed. “Of the West” (xi 西) means that menretain (xi 樓) the true doctrine in their breast.35 [Notes.xhtml#ch9fn35]“Kingly” means that emperors and kings will act according to heaven’s way andthrive in their role as king. They will reign so well that they couldn’t do anybetter. “Mother” is proof of old age and longevity. She is head of allspirits.36 [Notes.xhtml#ch9fn36](l) “Just as the four seasons return to the beginning.” “Just as” iscomparative: just as the four seasons bring each other forth, make each othergrow, and will never rob or injure each other. Such a reign takes place withouta penal code.(m) “The ninety-character declaration is transmitted to the experts in vitalitytechniques.”37 [Notes.xhtml#ch9fn37] “Nine” (jiu 九) means “at the end” (jiu 究),“to finish.” The virtue of someone able to live by these writings completelyagrees with the intentions of heaven and earth, Yin and Yang, and the tenthousand beings. “Ten” means a complete, ten-out-of-ten coherence, as in thetexts on nonaction.38 [Notes.xhtml#ch9fn38] “Written character” means the rowsof characters in the texts revealed by heaven. They are comprehensive and putforth all that is needed. “To transmit” a text is to [give men] faith in it. Inorder to inspire faith in a text’s characters and spells (zi fu 字符) you transmitthem.39 [Notes.xhtml#ch9fn39] “[Experts in] vitality techniques” are quitesquare (fang 方) and upright and quickly convey these teachings (dao) to a lordof high moral standing, so that he can abolish the disaster of inheriting andtransmitting evil (50.69) and his reign will become square and completelyupright. An “expert” is an individual with a determined mind. Any suchindividual can, when he puts his mind to it, reform a vast number of activitiesuntil they agree with these teachings (dao).What my declaration says will soon become obvious. You have grasped its meaning?Yes, I have. Excellent! Listening to your words I have become full of joy.So we may assume that you have understood.40 [Notes.xhtml#ch9fn40]Each time I have a question I know that I distress you. But if I don’t ask howcan I come to understand?Yes, it is as you say. When the worthy and the wise are in doubt, they ask. Thisis why they have their teachers.41 [Notes.xhtml#ch9fn41] One should not insiston speaking at random. One might do so once, but must not again elaborate on it.Yes. This is why I would not dare to insist on speaking. (50.70)What you say is correct, quite scholarly and modest. Keep it in mind.42[Notes.xhtml#ch9fn42]Now the Celestial Master has in all respects pointed me in a direction where mydoubts will be resolved. So I have already been able to inquire about the thingsI did not know. I wish to do so again, rude as this might be. May I be allowedto speak?Please don’t hesitate to raise your question.Yes, I will speak. The worthy and wise have all had teachers, in ancient timesas well as today. Now the Celestial Master’s teachings (dao) are as complete aspossible. Who was your teacher?An excellent question! We may say that you have an eye for subtleties. Yes, whenI took up my studies, I also sought the advice of teachers, more than one. Overa long period [my] dao matured and [my] virtue ripened. Finally, I came to agreewith heaven above. Only then did I understand what heaven wanted to say and itsent great Yang’s vital spirit (jing shen 精神) to inform me and make me speak. SoI have heaven for my teacher.43 [Notes.xhtml#ch9fn43] Although I like to explainthings to you, I would not dare to say anything at random if heaven did not wantme to speak. For then it would certainly execute me. You know as well that thisis truly important, don’t you? Heed it!Yes, I will. All that I have asked you have answered. I am so happy that I can’trefrain from speaking. I would like to ask something else!Go ahead.Yes, I will. Now you have for the sake of this benighted and shallow pupiloutlined the complete theory of receiving and transmitting [evil].44[Notes.xhtml#ch9fn44] I don’t understand whether “to receive” and “to transmit”belong together as if they were one or whether they are separate.Well, “to receive” is first; “to transmit” comes next. “To receive” means thatthe ancestors originally received heaven’s favor. As they went on, they slowlylost it. They did not notice how [their mistakes] increased from day to day. Alot came together. Now the latter-born, as innocent as they might be, meet withthese wrongdoings and are forever hit by calamities. For this reason “toreceive” is first and “to transmit” comes next. That there is “transmission”means that the cure for rows of disasters cannot come entirely from the reign ofone person.45 [Notes.xhtml#ch9fn45] One disturbance (bu ping 不平) followsanother. We speak of “transmission” because what is first and what comes laterare linked to each other. It means that ancestors transmit to descendants.Illness is received and transmitted from one to the other. This means thatnobody has yet been capable of putting an end to disasters and other harmfulinfluences.46 [Notes.xhtml#ch9fn46] Once they are dissolved, they arise again.In great awe have I obtained these writings from heaven. What they teach (dao)can dissolve all this. So they are truly important and invaluable. Do youunderstand?Yes, I do. How frightening!Go now. Don’t ask anything else.Yes.47 [Notes.xhtml#ch9fn47]"},{"pageContent":"SECTION 51THE TRUE CONTRACTThis short section is placed after the Declaration, as the Master demands inthis section’s last sentence. It touches on the right and wrong of actions andthe trustworthiness of actions as well as writings. What it says and how it saysit are at odds with the main gist of the discussions between the CelestialMaster and disciples. At the start, and without any guidance, the disciple comesup with the right answer. All that is left for the Master to do is elucidatethis answer. But, more importantly, what the student says is not in line withthe social and political approach that characterizes most of the TPJ. The factthat the Master seems to make a point of promoting this section also throwsdoubt on it. We must therefore suspect that its origins differ from the sectionsthat precede and follow it.• • •(51.71) Step forward, Perfected. Of all the actions performed under heaven,which are right and which are wrong?Prove that an action is appropriate and [you may then say that] it has merit.Therefore, whatever heals the illness someone is afflicted with is right.1[Notes.xhtml#ch10fn1] An action you can’t prove to be appropriate amounts toconduct without merit: what does not heal an illness is wrong. This applies notonly to the ruler.Excellent. What you have said is quite right. Although you did not say much,this can explain the myriad actions. I have nothing to add to this. Whenever wewish to compare right and wrong, we must always make this the criterion (fa 法).When no doubt remains, a tally (fu 符) will be trusted.2 [Notes.xhtml#ch10fn2]What do you mean?All actions are either trustworthy or not.3 [Notes.xhtml#ch10fn3] How must weproceed to examine it?The wise and worthy of old observed how men acted. On this basis, they knew withgreater clarity than that of the sun and the moon.What you have said is so good that it must not be modified. You might wish toknow that this is the way in which my writings prove to be trustworthy. Do youunderstand?Yes, I do.Go now. Call this the “true contract” (zhen quan 真券)4 [Notes.xhtml#ch10fn4] andbe careful not to neglect it. Don’t put it at the end,5 [Notes.xhtml#ch10fn5]but think of it as a section (shu zhang 書章) of the Declaration (jue ce 言策).6[Notes.xhtml#ch10fn6]"},{"pageContent":"SECTION 52HOW TO WORK HARD TO DO GOODThis dense section deals with an individual’s accountability for his deeds. Thisaccountability does not end with death but extends to the world beyond. Gooddeeds guarantee a happy life in the netherworld, and with some luck they canalso bring longevity or, when someone’s personal disposition is right, anavoidance of death. This main argument is supported by two general observationsabout the human condition. One is concerned with life’s stages and isreminiscent of what is said in section 44 about growing up and raising children.It is argued that full-time religious practice is possible only after one hascompleted raising a family. The other observation regards humankind’s historicaldevelopment, of which individual life is seen as a replica. After an originalstate of harmonious interaction with nature, man became a source of damage tohis environment and to himself. The good deeds that men perform today are meantto undo such damage. The ruler is in a special position. Good deeds on his partwill result in great peace, and the happiness of his afterlife depends on them.The section is based upon two assumptions, the desirability of living for a longtime and the existence of a link between morality and longevity. Doctrines thatoppose these assumptions, and in particular the first one, are accused ofcausing harm and preventing humankind from achieving great peace.These considerations are placed in the wider context of great peace thought: thechance to abolish inherited evil, the promise to achieve peace and with itlongevity and a happy afterlife for many, and, finally, the request to spreadthis good news widely.• • •(52.72) Step forward, Perfected! Living in this world, men are under altogetherhow many constraints?What do you mean?That you state how many constraints men in general suffer from.They are under many constraints.But can’t you give a name to them?I can’t.You have no insight, still! In this world, men are under four constraints.What does that mean?It means that a child at birth receives life from its father and mother. When itis small, it never imagines that its father and mother will depart. This is thefirst constraint. When children have grown up, they can’t help it:1[Notes.xhtml#ch11fn1] daughters desire a husband and sons a wife. They areunable to control their emotions, and the love they feel does not allow of anyseparation. This is the second constraint. Their love brings forth children.While man and wife grow older and become less attractive, their children areyoung and lovely. But they must be brought up. This is the third constraint.When children have grown up and no longer need to be nourished, parents willhave become old and unable to do things. This is the fourth constraint. It mightstill work if men, having been under these four constraints, can find anenlightened teacher and fix their thoughts on safeguarding dao. With greattalent and the right destiny2 [Notes.xhtml#ch11fn2] they might be able totranscend this world or, second best, gain longevity.3 [Notes.xhtml#ch11fn3] Orthey might enjoy living in their body as long as it lasts and have further causefor joy when their hun and bo spirit are belowground.4 [Notes.xhtml#ch11fn4]What do you mean?Down below when they receive someone who has just died, they always ask what hehas done and what he achieved while alive. (52.73) Thus the things one doesduring one’s lifetime decide how one is entered in the registers. Men areaccountable for their deeds and must for this reason act with great care.Whether someone is safe or in danger depends entirely on himself.5[Notes.xhtml#ch11fn5] Keep it in mind, Perfected. You understand that this is towarn you?Yes, I do. What the Celestial Master tells me is new to me.Well, I tell you these things because I see that you continue to have goodintentions. I am afraid you might become idle and weary, so I see the need forclarification, documentation, and instruction.Yes, indeed.What do you expect from your present studies, Perfected?6 [Notes.xhtml#ch11fn6]I expect to fulfill my years.What an excellent aim! We may say that you have grasped what dao means. But thecommon people expect to die of old age while what they really die from is thegood and bad of their deeds.7 [Notes.xhtml#ch11fn7]What do you mean? I would like to know.Well, stick to the study of the good, let your spirit roam about, and be merryand when you die you will become a demon who merrily roams about. It isincontestable that never again will you suffer any distress. Those who bringdistress and suffering upon themselves turn into demons who suffer distressafter death. A wicked person becomes after death a wicked demon. All thesematters are obvious enough for everyone to see, and yet men don’t want to dogood and make their hun spirit happy. This is a most severe fault.What do you mean?At birth, men receive the standard qi of heaven and earth,8[Notes.xhtml#ch11fn8] and are joined by the four seasons and five phases. Thiswas the situation with the ancestors (xian ren zhi tong ti 先人之統體). For a while,they each dwelt as a particular body among the four seasons and five phases ofheaven and earth. For their part, they always loved to do good and never had anyworries. But life went on. Later generations were different. All along they haveplagued the bodies of heaven and earth, the four seasons, and the five phases9[Notes.xhtml#ch11fn9] so that men themselves have become resentful and upondeath even their hun and bo spirit remain in a distressed state. So [we knowthat] foolish scholars give shallow advice (bu shen ji 不深計); since they areunable to prolong [a man’s] existence, they make him want to die quickly and toshow no regret when he dies. (52.74) The vital spirits [who reside in the humanbody] are grieved and sad [about this]. They have given these lowly scholars nocause to thus distress and anger them.10 [Notes.xhtml#ch11fn10]So the great worthies and wise men of old, who gave profound counsel and werefarsighted, knew what it was like. Therefore, they never ceased studying [how todo good]. A sovereign who enjoys thinking of great peace gains heaven’sapproval. His merit multiplies. His hun spirit roams about happily forever andpartakes in heaven’s good qi.11 [Notes.xhtml#ch11fn11]A ruler not able to bring peace to his reign is not tuned to heaven’s will, doesnot obtain heaven’s favor (yi 意), and gains no merit with heaven. Even in deathhis hun spirit is still held responsible in the world below and is joined withwicked qi. For this reason the lords of supreme wisdom in early antiquity whoknew of this worked very hard.12 [Notes.xhtml#ch11fn12] Because a foolish man’scounsel is shallow he is held to account by heaven as long as he lives and byearth after his death.How frightening. Although I am foolish and blind, I don’t wish to hear of this.Well, you have come here to learn. If you don’t want to hear of such things youjust have to work hard to be good!Yes, I will! For as long as the Celestial Master lives on earth he makes usunderstand heaven’s commands. What we have been taught is deep and substantive.So what can we do to prevent such things?Excellent. You must quickly spread my teachings so that all men under heavenwill follow them. They will for their own person stabilize the vital essence andin their thoughts proceed in communion with great dao. Then they will know forthemselves where faults and errors come from, and the load of evil that has beenreceived and is transmitted can be abolished. Heaven and earth will rejoice, andthe years of life will be multiplied by a return back to [the situation] ofearly antiquity.13 [Notes.xhtml#ch11fn13]Excellent indeed!All right. What I have to say has reached a certain conclusion. Study hard andcome again another day.Yes, I will.Think carefully about the writings you have received, from beginning to end. Notto concentrate on one’s studies is, it must be said, a sign of confusion. Onehas nowhere to go from unless research into things reaches [the realms] wherethere is neither form nor shape14 [Notes.xhtml#ch11fn14] and thinking touchesupon what is vital and spiritlike.Yes, excellent!15 [Notes.xhtml#ch11fn15]"},{"pageContent":"SECTION 53HOW TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN ROOT AND BRANCHESThis section loosely connects several topics by proposing that in each of thesituations discussed a return to the root will make things right. Giving anexample of the role of the root, the Master identifies as a root the originalversion of a text that must be restored when layers of annotation and corruptionhave damaged it. He promises that when texts are in proper shape, so, too, willbe society at large. Moreover, since brevity and oneness are characteristics ofthe root, it is best that one stick to a single attempt in the process ofdivination. “Root” is also the oneness from which the cosmos originates,attested to by a brief review of the changing seasons through the year. We mustassume that a return to the oneness and brevity from which things begin is asnecessary for man in his confusion as it is for textual materials and cosmicentities.This argument presents the development of texts in a different light fromsection 55, for instance, which claims that a complete collection of all writtenmaterial throughout the ages is necessary for distilling the true doctrine. Inthis section, texts are seen as corresponding to structures of the universe.They are depicted as if they were in a well-known order and meant to demonstratethe cyclical movement of which everything is part.The last part deals with teaching and its glory. Thus toward the end of thesection, as in sections 50 and 55, the activities and person of the teacher aremoved to the fore and it is proclaimed that teaching at its best makes thestudent fit to save the world.• • •(53.75) Step forward, Perfected. You have come here to learn. Does it take fewitems or many to obtain extensive knowledge of what dao means?1[Notes.xhtml#ch12fn1]Well, its prerequisites are many.Alas! Deep down your knowledge of dao’s essential meaning is not yet extensive.Now heaven is “one.” It turns to earth, which is “two.” What does this mean? Theearth being “two” will turn to man, who is “three.”2 [Notes.xhtml#ch12fn2] Why?I would like to know what this means, that they turn one to the other.Well, earth is employed by heaven and man by earth. In a year when heavenrejoices in happiness, it will let the ten thousand plants and beings on earthgrow well. Should it be unhappy it will let plants decay, even if earth shouldwish to nourish them.3 [Notes.xhtml#ch12fn3] If earth is good, the people wholive on it will love the good. This clearly proves how they employ each other.So, through too many embellishments4 [Notes.xhtml#ch12fn4] government turns intodisorder and does not obtain heaven’s approval. (53.76) Instead, we shouldreturn to the root of things.5 [Notes.xhtml#ch12fn5] When men speak too much,they don’t see this. They should instead return to a basic guideline (ben yao本要) in order to sustain their words and deeds.Therefore, the original text is completed in a single layer of words. With itstransmission comes the creation of chapter and verse commentaries.6[Notes.xhtml#ch12fn6] At the next level is an analysis of difficult passages(jie nan 解難). Difficult passages must be explained to prevent men from movingaway from truth. The fourth level of words consists of adaptations (wen ci 文辭)[of the original text]. At the fifth level, fake texts are produced, and at thesixth level [these fake products] are meant to deceive men. At the seventh levellies the distortion of the original text. At the eighth level, the distance fromwhat has originally been taught is becoming bigger and bigger. At the ninthlevel, the text is in great disorder; at the tenth, it is completely corrupted.Therefore, a scripture that has reached this tenth stage must be revised, or itsfurther transmission will end in extinction.7 [Notes.xhtml#ch12fn7]Whatever has been destroyed must return to the root. Thus for a new beginning wereturn to safeguarding the one. This is why the numbers of heaven begin with oneand end in ten. This characterizes the nature of heaven’s way as it is.8[Notes.xhtml#ch12fn8] So when the wise men of old had a query they undertook afirst divination to see whether the situation was auspicious or ominous. In thisway they guarded their root and spirits sent by heaven would descend to make theannouncement. When one divines a second time, spirits sent by earth will stepforward and give information; and at the third time the spiritual beings livingamong men will do so. Going beyond this and undertaking more divination amountsto deception without any prophetic content. If we divine often we do not hit thetruth.9 [Notes.xhtml#ch12fn9] When someone’s writings and sayings are numerous,they are not held precious.Excellent, indeed! Now since the Celestial Master constantly takes pity on myshortcomings, I would like to beg permission to raise one other point.Go ahead.Why do numbers stop at ten?Excellent. Asking about the pattern that lies behind this matter shows profoundknowledge. Well, the numbers of heaven begin with one and end with ten.10[Notes.xhtml#ch12fn10]Why is this so?Heaven begins as one. When it moves downward to be with earth there are two. Yinand Yang jointly create life. The ten thousand plants and beings start sproutingin the north, since primordial qi arises from zi, “son” [the first earthlybranch].11 [Notes.xhtml#ch12fn11] When primordial qi turns toward the northeast,plants spread their roots in jue, the “horn” [the first of the twenty-eightlunar mansions],12 [Notes.xhtml#ch12fn12] and when it turns toward the east,sprouts shine forth. It turns southeast and branches and leaves grow, becomingthick when it turns south, and almost complete when it moves southwest. (53.77)When primordial qi turns west, their produce is ripe, and when it turns towardthe northwest, plants die. Since what is dead must again return to its beginningthe character hai [the twelfth earthly branch]13 [Notes.xhtml#ch12fn13] consistsof two humans who both embrace the one, thus commencing the three majesties [ofheaven, earth, and man] (san huang 三皇). Therefore, hai is “the kernel” (he 核),where congealing [freezing] sets in, and that is why water starts freezing inthe tenth month. Ren [the ninth heavenly stem] is ren (pregnant).14[Notes.xhtml#ch12fn14] In this state, a woman is bound to grow bigger each day,so zi, “son” [the first branch], is growing. In these three stages,15[Notes.xhtml#ch12fn15] plants and beings turn back to the very beginning afterhaving matured through the harmonious union of Yin and Yang. We call this returnto the root jiazi [the first stem and branch]. Now when heaven’s way gives lifeto plants and beings they are found everywhere, and they mature by taking in qiof heaven and earth, the four seasons, and the five phases. These plants andbeings will be somewhat deficient as soon as one single qi is not sufficient.Thus, the numbers amount to ten because they take root in heaven and earth andencircle their eight directions. Do you understand any better? (53.78)Yes! Excellent, indeed! How very kind of you!Do not say thank you!16 [Notes.xhtml#ch12fn16]Why not?The task of teaching a pupil is as heavy as that of father and mother when theygive life to a child. You can’t free yourself from your obligation by sayingthank you.What do you mean?When a couple has not yet brought forth children, they might foolishly spreadsemen [as if it were] on uncultivated land. Should it suit the soil, then treesand other plants might take root. So [men] produce offspring without knowinghow. They spread semen unconsciously. How can they say where? Afterwards plantsand trees grow big. [But] man is born from the togetherness of Yin and Yang. Sohow is his upbringing related to that of plants and trees?17[Notes.xhtml#ch12fn17] After a man has come to life, he might be careless and, instead of serving agood teacher, he might serve a hideous and foolish one who instructs others inhow to do wrong. Learning how to become engaged in evil activities willsometimes lead a man to his death and his family to ruin. He will be accused ofcrimes and his family will be extinguished, or he will live without knowledgeand learning and thus become foolish. Now such a man, ignorant as he is, willnot only die in distress and misery, but he will also be accused of his faultsin the world below. What his hun and bo spirits will experience will not allowthem to roam about happily, and he himself, when dead, will not manage to becomea good demon.18 [Notes.xhtml#ch12fn18] But a man who has learned from a good teacher will change from being foolishand mean to being a good person.19 [Notes.xhtml#ch12fn19] Should he not stop atbeing good he might become worthy. If he should go still further, he mightbecome wise. If this does not stop him, he might acquire some profound knowledgeof the true doctrine (dao). Should he safeguard this and go still further, hemight transcend death.20 [Notes.xhtml#ch12fn20] If being a transcendent he stilldoes not come to a halt, he might become perfected; and if he goes further, hecould become like a spirit. If he does not stop there, he will have virtue, asheaven does. If he goes even further his virtue will resemble that of primordialqi, which embraces heaven and earth in the eight directions, so that everythinglives by receiving its qi. Since its virtue continues to cover heaven and earthin the eight directions, vital spirits will come from heaven and earth to drinkand eat; no one on earth would not make them offerings. And yet such a person[with the virtue of primordial qi] would remain fearful: he might slacken andnot be able to make the spirits come. This is the merit we talk of when a verygood teacher produces a good student.21 [Notes.xhtml#ch12fn21] Is it possible tosay thank you for this?How frightening! Foolish as I am I have broken a sacred rule. I have trespassedin what I have said.How modest! No more, Perfected! All right, you have understood that a studentmust not say thank you for having gained knowledge. (53.79)Yes, I have!22 [Notes.xhtml#ch12fn22]"},{"pageContent":"SECTION 54HOW TO ENJOY GIVING LIFE WINS FAVOR WITH HEAVENThe text in this section is damaged. It seems to consist of the transcripts oftwo separate dialogues, both of which are corrupt beyond any hope of emendation.The first dialogue concerns moral action. The issue is raised in a broad contextthat includes one’s personal life as well as political policy, and it is dealtwith in a practical manner, integrating rather than excluding a wide range ofapproaches. Although it is best to resemble heaven, bring things to life, andlet the country’s administration take care of itself, not everyone is free toact that way. The Master here shows some understanding of the difficultdecisions a public servant might have to make. Once in government a person muststrive to do without the penal code, we are told, since punishments cause griefand thus perturb heaven. If they must be applied, however, it is good to limitthe number of people put to death. A person who goes so far as to eradicate afamily or a group of neighbors can no longer be called good. Such criticism ofstrict rule was common. The saying “The dead cannot be brought back to life, northe amputated parts of the body rejoined” has been transmitted in variousplaces.1 [Notes.xhtml#ch13fn1]This section throws some light on the justification used by members of theTaiping and other popular Han dynasty movements for attacking and killing theofficials they could get hold of, as was described above in the introduction.Severe officials are, in the Celestial Master’s opinion, evil, since theydestroy life instead of protecting it as well as they can. This makes themmorally inferior and deprives them, we might conclude, of the authority andrespect that they would otherwise be entitled to due to their position.The transmitted text of the second session does not seem to refer to anyparticular topic of discussion. Instead, the student’s words take up more spacethan usual. He describes his own inferior position but otherwise does not saymuch. Most of the passage consists of those admonitions that generally introduceand appear at the conclusion of discussions. The text mentions the CelestialMaster’s personal excellence, the student’s eagerness, and the way in which theMaster’s message is to be distributed. Perhaps this is all that the second halfof this section originally consisted of. This content agrees with the account ofthe section in the summary, “polite conduct between teacher and disciple.”• • •(54.80) Step forward, Perfected. In the deeds of men and the reign of kings—whatis best?It is best to have sympathy with all and harm no one, as heaven does.Your words, we must say, agree with dao’s intentions.2 [Notes.xhtml#ch13fn2]However, although no government is more outstanding than the one that resemblesheaven, there must also be one next in line.What do you mean? I have with great care been able to say one thing. I will notspeak twice. Would that the Celestial Master would explain it all!Well, the best way for a man to act and for a king to reign is to always desireto give life. Always be as eager in this as someone who draws water from a wellwhen thirsty and you will do the right thing. In the next turn, nothing isbetter than to enjoy bringing life to perfection.3 [Notes.xhtml#ch13fn3] Alwaysbe as anxious to do this as you are worried about your own person and you willdo right. Benevolence and generosity are the next best. It is right to feel asmuch distress for others when you see them poor and exhausted as you would aboutyour own hunger and cold.4 [Notes.xhtml#ch13fn4] The next best is to promulgatelaws efficiently. Without taking any interest or joy in causing anybody harm,you must let laws spread fear.5 [Notes.xhtml#ch13fn5] Next, nothing is better ifsomeone has trespassed than administrative acts, which don’t involve anyone in acriminal investigation. This is the right thing to do. Next is the wish not todo serious harm to the person involved in the crime.6 [Notes.xhtml#ch13fn6]Next, the right thing to do when nothing can be done about someone’s executionis to try to prevent family and neighborhood groups from getting involved.7[Notes.xhtml#ch13fn7] Next, when a crime involves a family and neighborhoodgroup we must focus on those who committed the crime and take care not tocompletely wipe out a specific set of people. Man exists in the spiritlikedispensation of heaven and earth. To annihilate means to cut off thisdispensation, which might wound and injure the substance (ti 體) of heaven andearth. This is severe damage. Heaven [might] respond by striking dead a wholegeneration.8 [Notes.xhtml#ch13fn8] This is not an easy matter for forefathers,9[Notes.xhtml#ch13fn9] family ancestors, and parents, who must plan for latergenerations and protect sons and grandsons against the peril of inheriting andtransmitting evil. That is why wise men always reign with great peace in mind.They might set up a penal code but will not make use of it.10[Notes.xhtml#ch13fn10] In this way, they plan for later generations. Have youunderstood what these subtle sayings mean?11 [Notes.xhtml#ch13fn11]Yes, I have!(54.81) Step forward, Perfected!12 [Notes.xhtml#ch13fn12]Yes, here I am.Perfected, are you not up to speaking your mind?13 [Notes.xhtml#ch13fn13] Or areyou too modest? Just one word?My dispensation is attached to earth; my destiny lies with the Kunlun. Now thedestiny of the Celestial Master lies with heaven, with the Purple Palace of the[celestial] North Pole.14 [Notes.xhtml#ch13fn14] Now earth must be void andempty if it is to receive heaven’s mercy. As a pupil, I must comport myself in asemblance of the earth’s void heart. Only after I have respectfully receivedyour instruction will I reach dao’s essential words . . .15[Notes.xhtml#ch13fn15](54.82) Some live earlier, others later, some know more, others less, theirposition is honored or lowly, they rank high or low. Now what I could say wouldnot match your words. What a young man might say is not how an old man viewsdao; it is not of first-rate clarity. The Celestial Master has already paidattention to me, foolish and inadequate as I am, and made me begin to seethings. To know good and bad is difficult16 [Notes.xhtml#ch13fn16]—how could Iget there as if at one stroke? For the sake of majestic heaven and august earth,please don’t abandon me halfway.Well, you have spoken in the name of heaven. I won’t give you up. But Ithought17 [Notes.xhtml#ch13fn17] that out of fear you might never say a word.This is why I have asked you this question.I would not dare be so fearful. When I hear the Celestial Master speak, I amjust too happy and too afraid.How is that?I am happy to have met the Master. I am afraid because I fear that I am too slowand dull to learn everything before the Master goes away. I am as eager to ask aquestion as thirsty people are for the water of a well.18 [Notes.xhtml#ch13fn18]Why is that so?I want to obtain your teachings (dao) and deliver them to disciples who willgive them to a virtuous lord so that he can make use of them. Should19[Notes.xhtml#ch13fn19] Yin and Yang each be in their place, all the world’sdiseases that are inherited and passed on would be completely healed.You have put this well. Carefully investigate my writings and the doctrine (dao)will be complete. If you go through them from beginning to end, they will becomeclearer than the sun and the moon as they interact while rotating aroundthemselves. If you daily think about how to live by these teachings, alldiseases will of themselves be completely healed and all will be resolved. Theneverything can really be called happy.Yes, indeed.20 [Notes.xhtml#ch13fn20]"},{"pageContent":"SECTION 55HOW TO CLASSIFY OLD TEXTS AND GIVE A TITLE TO THE BOOKThe task of putting written material in order not only resembles redeeming theworld, it also promotes such redemption. The following section instructs a rulerin how to go about assembling texts. The first step, only vaguely defined, isthe division of all writings from all ages into different categories. There aremeant to be writings on dao and heaven; writings on “wisdom,” which probablymeans moral questions; writings on “worthy action,” that is, on politicalissues; and manuscripts without any official status, “which the people have putforth.”Memorable passages from these four sets of writings are to be excerpted and madeinto books. Together they amount to the “Scripture That Pervades All,” thescripture of scriptures, which is impossible to improve.We may call all of this material man-made. The disciple mentions another set oftexts whose origin lies in the world of spirits and in heaven. The Master arguesthat these texts lack perfection: they contradict each other, and none of themgives the complete picture. So we may assume that the taiping material, whichthe disciples read in the course of their training, was not seen as goingdirectly back to a supernatural source. Man-made, it was authorized by heavenbut did not originate from it.The last passages of the section approach the issue from another angle. It ishere presumed that the text entitled “Great All-Pervading Reign of Heaven” isalready available. It has been created by the Celestial Master and is perfect;it is beyond any further improvement.This reference to the Celestial Master’s own work has perhaps slipped into thesection because the term “all-pervading” occurs in its title as well as in thetitle of the scripture that is supposed to be collated under the auspices of ataiping ruler. The section, however, does not focus on any particular scripture.It focuses on the process of compiling textual materials, which in itself isseen as part of the reform process and thus as a great peace-promoting activity.Given the way this scripture has been collected and edited, we cannot expect anyauthorial voice or coherent argument. Also, commentaries don’t seem to play arole in it. We must expect this scripture to have been a leishu, that is, anencyclopedia or anthology. Leishu were, in the words of Teng and Biggerstaff,“compiled for the purpose of providing the emperor and ministers of state withconveniently arranged summaries of all that was known at the time.”1[Notes.xhtml#ch14fn1]The contradiction between the availability of a perfect scripture and theongoing need to produce one encapsulates the practicalities of the reformprocess. To produce the true scripture is to do as it says. It is therefore asocial and a continuous activity. It cannot be replaced; it can only be guidedby the text the Master himself has put forth.• • •(55.83) From day to day more foolish, dull and blind as I am, I bow twice beforeyou. Could I please ask something?Go ahead! You are improving yourself,2 [Notes.xhtml#ch14fn2] and you study withunremitting effort. Your questions are on behalf of heaven. It is my task tolisten to what you have to say. I would not dare to spare myself. Speak rightaway.Yes, I will. Nowadays little that has been written on dao can be considered acelestial scripture. [We must] collect and revise3 [Notes.xhtml#ch14fn3] thewords of wise men from early, middle, and late antiquity for a scripture ofwisdom. We must do likewise for the words of men of great virtue for a scriptureof virtue, and we must compile the words of the worthy and enlightened fromearly, middle, and late antiquity for a scripture of worth. Now when I think ofwhat you have said, I can’t fully comprehend the intention of these collations.Could you please enlighten us on what should be done first and what next, sothat a virtuous lord may obtain [this material] for his personal instruction andthen engage the worthy men around him to extract from it opinions that arevaluable?4 [Notes.xhtml#ch14fn4]Well, your question is essential, just as it should be.5 [Notes.xhtml#ch14fn5]Excellent, indeed! Yes,6 [Notes.xhtml#ch14fn6] I shall explain it all; you mayrecord it in the way it suits you, but be careful not to forget my words. Ispeak for heaven and earth, and lay out rules that the lord of supreme virtuemust follow in order to abolish the peril that has resulted from the receptionand transmission of evil since the division between heaven and earth. (55.84)One must not dare speak at random, as this would surely be resented by majesticheaven and august earth and would disappoint the most worthy, enlightened, andvirtuous (dao de 道德) lord, and we would have to view it as a great crime. Do youunderstand?Yes, I do.Well, this is what is meant by collecting and revising what has been written ondao from early, middle, and late antiquity:7 [Notes.xhtml#ch14fn7] it is only tolet all worthy men jointly recite and glance at all of dao’s texts, the old onesand those of a more recent date. If a scroll contains one valuable expression(shan zi 善字) or instruction (shan jue 善言夬), they should at once take note ofthis piece of writing and make an excerpt. One scroll might contain one valuableexpression, ten scrolls ten, and so forth for one hundred, one thousand, tenthousand, and one hundred thousand scrolls, which might contain one hundredthousand valuable expressions. If there were ten valuable expressions orinstructions per scroll there might be one million, and if one scroll containedone hundred this would make ten million. [What is valuable] should be recordedin writing and put together in one place.The worthies should take a look at all essays (wenzhang 文章), old and new, andcompile their complete list, organized according to subject, each under theheading of their school (ge zong qi jia 各從其家), cutting out duplicates. Theyshould edit them in the order of certain key words (yao wen zi 要文字).8[Notes.xhtml#ch14fn8] This done, we gain thorough knowledge of the essentialmeaning of heaven and earth, humankind, and the ten thousand beings in previoustimes as well as nowadays. From these texts the celestial scriptures (tian jing天經) are derived. Do you understand?Yes, excellent.So you have understood! When you collect and revise the valuable expressions(shan zi 善字) and instructions (jue shi 言夬事) from scriptures by wise men fromearly, middle, and late antiquity, you might find one in one scroll, ten in tenscrolls, and so forth up to one hundred thousand expressions in one hundredthousand scrolls. Should there be ten to a scroll, we would have a million; if ahundred, we would have ten million. Men considered worthy and enlightened shouldlist these writings, assemble them in one appropriate place, and compile themall by subject. If the worthy and enlightened were to examine this material, putit in proper order, and cut out duplicates it would make up a scripture ofwisdom.9 [Notes.xhtml#ch14fn9] Do you understand?Yes, I do.Good. When one collects and revises expressions by the worthy and enlightenedfrom early, middle, and late antiquity there might be one truly valuable one inone scroll, ten in ten scrolls, one hundred in one hundred scrolls, and so forthup to one hundred thousand. Should there be ten to a scroll that would be onemillion; should there be one hundred that would be ten million. Once they arecomplete, they must be brought into sequence by subject, so that one follows theother. (55.85) The worthy and enlightened should undertake an examination, cutout duplicates, and then edit and display the material. This would constitute ascripture on worthy [action]. Do you understand?Yes, I do.So you have understood. If you wish to collect and revise essays, scriptures,and writings of dao, including the writings of worthy men as well as thevaluable expressions and instructions10 [Notes.xhtml#ch14fn10] that the peoplehave put forth, you must record all that is valuable and assemble it in onesecluded place. Having done this, give them to the worthy, enlightened, andtruly virtuous to organize according to subject matter so that they prove andclarify each other.11 [Notes.xhtml#ch14fn11] One must cut out duplicates andarrange the expressions in sequence. These are called writings and texts onheaven and earth and words about the condition of men.When all this has been finished, these valuable instructions omit nothing, noteven something the size of a thin strand of hair. They are dao’s own teachings,entitled “All-Pervading Scripture on Heaven and Earth and on Yin and Yang.”12[Notes.xhtml#ch14fn12] Tens of thousands of generations will not be able toimprove them.Excellent indeed!All right. I would say you have mastered it.I am foolish, I am not good enough. Now I would like to ask one more question.Go ahead.The division between heaven and earth took place long ago. The Yellow River andthe Luo have issued texts and maps. Occasionally spirit writings (shen wen shu神文書) have appeared. Some sacred phoenixes on their tour of inspection came tospit out texts.13 [Notes.xhtml#ch14fn13] Texts were collected in many ways, notjust from one source. There have also been many made by wise and worthy men. Inthe end, each has its own merit. What questions do you raise in regard to thismaterial, how do you peruse and view it? [Despite the existence of thismaterial], you suddenly instruct the worthy and enlightened of late antiquity tocollect and revise old and new texts and men’s sayings!Yes, I have perused and viewed this material. I would not dare annoy the worthyand virtuous men of late antiquity without proper cause. I am now banished tothe realms below heaven (55.86) and must explain (jie 解) to a lord ofoutstanding morality that the reception and transmission of evil are to blamefor the strings of calamities and poisonous influences (liu zai wei du 流災委毒)[that have been around] since the division between heaven and earth. Old and newcelestial texts, wise writings, and worthy sayings are complete enough, but whenput together14 [Notes.xhtml#ch14fn14] the trouble is that each excels in onetopic. If you rely on the model [set up by] one school [only], you will not beable to abolish all the disasters that happen in heaven and on earth, and theywill continue to be received and transmitted without end. Later generationssuffer from calamity and illness that increase every day.15[Notes.xhtml#ch14fn15] For this reason heaven feels for the virtuous lord andhis ongoing reception and transmission [of evil]. It knows16[Notes.xhtml#ch14fn16] that because of these calamities later generations areunable to survive on their own.17 [Notes.xhtml#ch14fn17] The mistake lies reallywith the worthy and wise men of former generations. They all excelled in onething, but there was also a lot they misunderstood or neglected. Since heavenknew that something was missing, it occasionally issued the Yellow River and Luotexts and maps and other spirit writings. These again differed from each otherin what they said. The great worthy and wise of different generations each dealtwith one specific matter. They again differed from each other in what they said.On some issues, they were not good. Each had their weak and their strong points.Thus it is clear that all of them were unable to fully understand what“all-pervading” (dongji) means. Thus between heaven and earth calamities neverceased to occur. They were never brought to a halt, not in former times or inlater times, but sometimes they were increasing and sometimes they were not.Therefore, heaven above thought about it, and now there are written texts thatfrom beginning to end are complete and perfect. Were another wise man to be bornthere is nothing further he would be able to write, to add, to formulate insentences and to benefit heaven, earth, and virtuous lords. If heaven gave birthto another wise man, his words might excel in one particular field, but, evenso, the growth of natural disasters would never come to an end, just as was thecase for the wise and worthy of previous ages. For this reason heaven has sentme to strictly command you to give texts to a virtuous lord so that he can showthem to all the worthy and enlightened men around him. They must collect andrevise these writings together with all the world’s texts and the instructionsand expressions men have given voice to, which from beginning to end supporteach other. They must cut out duplicates, put forth a digest of instructions,and record it as a scripture. When this has been done the true texts, standardterms, and valuable expressions of heaven and earth can all be made public.Deceptive forgeries18 [Notes.xhtml#ch14fn18] will be completely eradicated, thegreat illness of heaven and earth will vanish, calamities will be completelyabolished, and the people and the ten thousand beings will each be able to livewhere they belong and will no longer suffer from hardship.For this reason heaven has instructed me in how to collect and revise material.The writings I have produced put together proofs, not words. Once they areexamined and enacted in heaven and on earth, calamities (zai 災), disasters (bian變), anomalies (guai 怪), illnesses (ji 疾), epidemics (bing 病), and jealous,cunning, and despotic officials as well as ill-fated and deceptive forgeries areall bound to go away, just as clouds are dispersed on an overcast day.19[Notes.xhtml#ch14fn19] (55.87) Compare this to what I have said and what I havewritten—they are exactly the same.20 [Notes.xhtml#ch14fn20] Now I have receivedthese texts with great respect from heaven and have passed on what they say. Whywould heaven without cause put an end to calamities if it sees that men do notvigorously enact these texts? It is natural that men will be in disorder iftheir written texts are in disorder. Under these circumstances there is nochance that calamities will go away. Do you understand?Yes, I do.Fine, so you know.I would like to ask a question.Go ahead.Now, since the division between heaven and earth, heaven has brought forthspiritlike, wise, and worthy men so that throughout the ages they would be incharge of the sayings of heaven and earth. They designed models for kings tofollow in order to end natural disasters and make the world secure. Emperors andkings of today make use of them. Texts were written [for them] so that theywon’t ignore heaven’s intentions and the rules [set by] Yin and Yang. Thesetexts all have titles. Now what does one call the writings on dao and its virtuethat the Celestial Master has produced?This is a good question. Well, the title is “Great All-Pervading Reign ofHeaven.”21 [Notes.xhtml#ch14fn21]Why is its correct title “Great All-Pervading Reign of Heaven”?Well, “great” is “big.” The government of someone who puts this into practice isof highest unsurpassable excellence. Dong means that dao, virtue, and the[knowledge] of good and bad of such a man reach out to heaven and earth, thatYin and Yang cooperate with him, and that in all six directions everything willbe responsive to him.Since all are concerned with doing good, nothing is not in its right place. Onbehalf of dao men are to collect and revise the heavenly, earthly, human, andspirit writings that have come out since the division of heaven and earth andselect from them valuable points to make the “Scripture That Pervades All.” Onceemperors and kings rely on it and let the worthy men around them work atapplying it, within the four oceans and the four borders22[Notes.xhtml#ch14fn22] all natural disasters will vanish as if they had beenswept away. The reign will become penetrating, pure, and brilliant and theruler’s personal stature will resemble that of the spirits and numinous beings(shen and ling) of heaven and earth. For this reason [the scripture] is entitled“Great All-Pervading Reign of Heaven.” Do you understand?Yes, I do! How alarming!Well, now you know.23 [Notes.xhtml#ch14fn23]"},{"pageContent":"SECTION 56HOW THE NINE GROUPS OF MEN DISPERSE CALAMITIES INHERITED FROM FORMER KINGSThis section documents how all social groups cooperate in a society at peace.1[Notes.xhtml#ch15fn1] Their togetherness is the ruler’s responsibility, and hissuccess depends on their support. He creates the environment in which each taskcan be performed and thus attracts the right men to perform those tasks. Theinterconnection between these groups and between their tasks resembles therelationship between Yin and Yang, where each element is of similar or perhapseven equal importance. We are told that this ideal society functions so wellbecause each group exerts its own influence on the common qi. Hierarchies aretaken for granted, but cooperation and integration are stressed in a way thatportrays social harmony or “balance\" (ping 平) as slightly different from theharmony envisaged by Mengzi, for instance, or the harmony in the Wenzi, whichputs men into twenty-five different ranks and argues that the top five arerelated to the five at the bottom, just as men are related to oxen and horses.2[Notes.xhtml#ch15fn2]The second part of this section is only loosely linked to what precedes it. Thediscussion of qi brings the two parts together. A man can learn to control qithrough diet and meditation in order to become heaven’s servant and the directsubordinate of heaven’s vital spirits. He will then be in a position as“heaven’s servant” to mediate between heaven and men and to act as a potentialsavior. The Zhuangzi has something to say on this through the voice ofConfucius:3 [Notes.xhtml#ch15fn3] when Yan Hui is about to take up an officialposition, Confucius advises him to practice “fasting of the heart,” which wouldput him in full control of qi and thus improve his safety and chance of success.On the one hand, this section stresses the coherence of the reform project andthe inclusion of all activities. On the other hand, and in slight contradiction,it mentions the critical importance of spiritual expertise and the special rolereserved for the individual who excels in the control of qi.• • •(56.88) What does it mean that heaven has set up nine groups of men in regard tothe effects of Yin and Yang?4 [Notes.xhtml#ch15fn4]Man is the leader [responsible for] managing the ten thousand beings. There arespiritlike men among them who are without bodily form and who bend qi.5[Notes.xhtml#ch15fn5] Their task is to look after primordial qi. Men of greatspirit are in charge of heaven, the perfected are responsible for order onearth, transcendents must regulate the four seasons, and men of great dao thefive phases. The wise must look after Yin and Yang, and the worthy have the taskof putting texts and writings in order and receiving everything that is put inwords. The common people are in charge of looking after plants, trees, and thefive crops of grains. Serfs are responsible for overseeing goods andcommodities.6 [Notes.xhtml#ch15fn6]Why is this so?Everything is managed according to its kind. The spiritlike man who is withoutbodily form bends qi and resembles primordial qi,7 [Notes.xhtml#ch15fn7] so helooks after it. The man of great spirit has a body; great spirits8[Notes.xhtml#ch15fn8] resemble heaven, so such a man keeps matters that concernheaven in order. The perfected concentrates his energy and deserves trust,similar to earth, so he is responsible for it.9 [Notes.xhtml#ch15fn9] Thetranscendent ensures that the four seasons [are respected] since he istransformed in the same way as they are.10 [Notes.xhtml#ch15fn10] The man ofgreat dao presides over prognosticating good and bad luck.11[Notes.xhtml#ch15fn11] He resembles the five phases and is for this reasonresponsible for their movement. The wise man presides over harmonizing qi. Sincehe resembles [the balance between] Yin and Yang, he controls all that relates tothem. The worthy revises writings and speaks well. He resembles [the regularpattern of] texts and is therefore in charge of the realm of texts andwritings.12 [Notes.xhtml#ch15fn12] The common people are disorderly, troubled,and without insight, just like the ten thousand plants and beings, so that iswhat they are put in charge of. Serfs handle goods since they resemble goods andcommodities. (56.89) The rich have them, the poor don’t. Since serfs can keeptrack of what goes and what comes, they oversee goods and commodities. Indefining responsibilities, majestic heaven does not violate any feelings. Itallows each man without fail to be concerned with what is of his own kind. Ifthis were not the case, great damage might occur. So this is the way in which wemust organize the people who live under heaven. The wise men of old knew thiswell. Therefore, they did not miss heaven’s intentions but gained favor with it.You had better comprehend this!Excellent, indeed.I have said this to warn you not to forget.Yes, I won’t.Work hard!Now I am perplexed13 [Notes.xhtml#ch15fn13] and don’t know the answer. Are yousaying that these nine groups of men with their different activities are of acertain advantage to the king’s reign?No.14 [Notes.xhtml#ch15fn14] A government that meets heaven’s intentions willharmonize these nine qi and create agreement among the nine groups of men. Itwill thus be able to achieve great peace of highest majesty (shang huang taiping上皇太平). Should these nine activities conflict rather than be in accord with eachother, great peace will not be achieved. These activities generate each other inturn.15 [Notes.xhtml#ch15fn15] But men are not well informed about it. The wiseand worthy of former times did not explain it in full. That is why it has longremained undetected.16 [Notes.xhtml#ch15fn16] But if one single activity is notin order, peace can not prevail.Why is this so?For the qi of highest majesty to arrive on a grand scale,17[Notes.xhtml#ch15fn17] these nine groups of men must all come to help the kinggovern. As soon as one single qi [as represented by one of these nine groups ofmen] does not cooperate, something will not be right. For this reason one willnot be able to harmonize Yin and Yang and reign in peace.How about their “coming [to help]”?The spiritlike man without bodily form will come to make the announcement to theking, so that his heart becomes more enlightened from day to day. (56.90) Theman of great spirit will occasionally appear to teach about the purpose ofgovernment. The perfected, the transcendent, and the man of great dao will allact as teachers to assist this process of education. The wise and the worthywill come to the fore. From their midst detached scholars will come to serve asofficials. The common people and serfs will behave well and do nothing wickedand evil. This proves that heaven and earth are very pleased.What is the meaning of “As soon as one single qi does not cooperate, this willnot happen”?18 [Notes.xhtml#ch15fn18]Should primordial qi not cooperate, the spiritlike man without bodily form willnot arrive, and if heaven’s qi does not do so, the man of great spirit will notcome. Problems with earth’s qi will prevent the perfected from coming.Disharmony of the four seasons will prevent the arrival of the transcendent.Should the five phases lack harmony, the man of great dao will not step forward.If Yin and Yang are not in cooperation, wise men will not appear. Should whatthe texts say not be true, officials of great worth will not come. Should theynot be able to harvest the ten thousand crops, the common people will be indisorder, there will be few goods and commodities, and serfs will run away. Menwill ignore their responsibility in all their activities. This is precisely thedamage [that results from a disharmony of qi]. Should you wish to deliver heavenfrom disorderly qi you have to work hard and unremittingly at creating balance(平). Heed my words!Yes, I will.Once [all] qi has been obtained, the nine groups of men will safeguard dao. Theinheriting and transmitting of the calamities [that were caused by] ten thousandgenerations of former kings will come to an end. But should these men forgettheir place, the damage derived from this inheritance will increase daily.Should these nine, from the man without bodily form down to the serf, eachadjust to one qi, the nine qi will blend in the way of Yin and Yang.But for heaven to bring about this harmonious blending of qi men must first feedon qi.19 [Notes.xhtml#ch15fn19] For this reason a superior scholar who is aboutto enter dao will first give up eating solid food and instead feed on qi.20[Notes.xhtml#ch15fn20] This means that he is about to mix with primordial qi. Sonourishment must be set up inside the grass hut21 [Notes.xhtml#ch15fn21] to lethim celebrate a fast. He must look at nothing wicked or evil but daily refinehis body. When nothing attracts his desire, he will be able to step out into thespace without crevices [as if he were not solid]22 [Notes.xhtml#ch15fn22] andwill offer his assistance to transcendents, perfected, and primordial qi to keepheaven in order. This makes him something of a spiritlike scholar23[Notes.xhtml#ch15fn23] and a servant of heaven.24 [Notes.xhtml#ch15fn24] Don’trestrain yourself and don’t give up. You will truly be able to do it. You willbe called a celestial scholar (tian shi)25 [Notes.xhtml#ch15fn25] and will beselected to the group of good men. Heaven will be greatly pleased and will inturn benefit men.What does this mean?Someone who has thus achieved dao and moves away from this world might be of nouse in the eyes of men but will harmonize qi of Yin and Yang. When emperors andkings of old offered a sacrifice, spirits from heaven would come down to feast.This is what is meant. (56.91)But would heaven’s vital spirits in person come down to feast?26[Notes.xhtml#ch15fn26]Very good, what you have said. Well, if a man should rise to become heaven’sservant, heaven’s vital spirits become his superiors. Lord and servant affecteach other. The servant’s task lies in supervising [human] conduct. Whenever theservant says that men are good and have gained merit, the lord descends with himand is pleased and happy down below.27 [Notes.xhtml#ch15fn27] Thus will the evilthat men have inherited and that they transmit be abolished. Should the servantnot be pleased, he will say that men trespass against heaven. Neither lord norservant would want to descend and get close enough to men to share their food.For this reason, there would be an increase in the number of crimes. Since menwould themselves commit more trespasses, how would they be able to put an end tothe chain of calamities that reaches back to former kings? You should reallycomprehend this!How frightening! I am in great fear, as confused as if I had lost my breath(qi). If I had not asked you, I would not have had a chance to hear thismentioned.All right. Work hard! Our talk is finished. You’d better go.Yes, I will.28 [Notes.xhtml#ch15fn28]"},{"pageContent":"SECTION 57HOW TO EXAMINE WHAT IS TRUE AND WHAT IS FALSE DAOThis section gives a short preview of the entire missionary process, along-lasting course that is begun in the presence of the Master and hisdisciples through the distribution of texts. From this beginning, a process ofcorrections follows, first of texts and then of men’s understanding. Schoolsassembled around standard texts will eventually improve men’s behavior and thusreduce the load of inherited evil. Since this load is big, no sudden relief canbe expected. Still, progress is observable and proves the validity of theMaster’s texts.There is an apparent contradiction between the long process through whichreforms evolve and the opportunity to observe some proof of the program’svalidity more or less at the outset. This problem is not solved in principle,but rather put aside by the personal testimony of the Master, as proclaimed inthis section—“I am here in person to verify”—or by reference to heaven’stestimony. Disciples and followers are provided with some proof, but they arealso expected to believe.The section also attempts to provide an explanation of the origin of false textsand thus evil action. False words are occasioned by an increasing number ofmistakes, just as an increasing quantity of something cold reduces the heat of asubstance. The process of deterioration is depicted here as being as gradual asthe reform process. It has different stages, moving from the accidental mistaketo intentional deceit, and finally to a state of general distrust.The section is very short and has an unusual number of lacunae. However, it isintroduced and completed in the usual manner and has a clear message. What itsays contradicts the more fundamentalist approach of other sections1[Notes.xhtml#ch16fn1]—where it is argued that with one qi in disorder the worldis in disorder—but the Celestial Master makes similar remarks elsewhere, forexample, in the subsequent section, section 58. The central point is that thestate of great peace can be achieved. It seems to be of lesser interest to thebelievers whether it will happen in a subitist or in a more gradualist manner.• • •(57.92) This business will indeed be finished before too long. Step forward,Perfected. Pay attention to these instructions.Yes, I will!After you have come to live by these teachings (dao) in person, the long-lastingcauses for the inheritance and transmission [of evil] will gradually recede intothe distance. But there is so much peril; qi is tangled, and calamities,grievances, and poisonous influences are truly many. They cannot come to an endat a moment’s notice. Once men have learned to put all their energy intofollowing these teachings, the peril of inheriting and transmitting evil willlessen day by day, it will be reduced month by month, and it will vanish year byyear.How would one know this?Very good, your objection! One may say that you understand what dao is allabout. Well, listen carefully. All texts and writings under heaven will becomestandard after men have learned to live by these teachings (dao). Thus men willalso [follow] the standard [norms]. There won’t be any deceptive forgeries2[Notes.xhtml#ch16fn2] after everyone has been initiated to the true doctrine(dao); they will all cease to exist. Men will be ever more attentive, of theirown account, from generation to generation. They will imitate and teach eachother, so that all will know dao and turn inward, keep their own person in view,and show concern for their own self. Their progeny will therefore be pious (xiao孝), live a long time, and put effort into growing old. The color of their facewill not be the same as it was during the times without the true doctrine. Latergenerations will know more and more of [dao’s] supreme meaning and form aschool. Their learning will continue to surpass that of their predecessors. Fromday to day they will become more generous and friendly toward each other. Theywill cherish and value men in possession of dao (you dao ren 有道人).Weapons andarmaments, jealousy, and treachery will be of no further avail. So the peril ofinheriting and transmitting [evil] will lessen. This is the art of what is as itis. That it always succeeds3 [Notes.xhtml#ch16fn3] proves the validity of mytext. One must not carelessly set aside good words. I am here in person toverify that [these sayings] are as an echo to heaven and earth. How could theybe mistaken? It is so that in the course of time texts and writings have comeout in which men—not just one—have collected [accounts of] circumstances thatare difficult to understand.4 [Notes.xhtml#ch16fn4] This is the reason why myteachings (dao) are sincere. You have come for some time to study and askquestions,5 [Notes.xhtml#ch16fn5] so you must be glad to know that there isproof for what I say. It works with opposites, as with cold and heat: when thereis too much heat there is too little cold, and when there is too much cold thereis too little heat.6 [Notes.xhtml#ch16fn6] Now, since the division betweenheaven and earth, teachers who formerly instructed others often hid away thetrue doctrine (dao) and instead taught [others] frivolous and superficial[material]. Through carelessness faults slowly became bigger. They grew andexpanded even more upon reaching later generations. This is the reason why menwere finally transmitting to each other false teachings, separated by a greatdistance7 [Notes.xhtml#ch16fn7] from heaven’s way.8 [Notes.xhtml#ch16fn8] Atfirst, the creation of texts became an occasion for deceiving others. Justhappening once, it went unnoticed. Later on it was used for profit. (57.93) Thismeant that men in a leading position were no longer trustworthy, andsubordinates ceased to pledge allegiance. Disorder arose because each harboreddoubts about the other. Later generations inherited [these evils] and passedthem on, so that the perils their forefathers had encountered were multiplied.That is why they increased even more.9 [Notes.xhtml#ch16fn9] Since heavengrieves about this, I advise you to pay attention.10 [Notes.xhtml#ch16fn10] Itis in your own interest to study vigorously. Then you will abolish illness inthe name of heaven and remove danger for the sake of emperors and kings. Up inheaven your great merit will be known.I would not dare to accept this.11 [Notes.xhtml#ch16fn11]"},{"pageContent":"SECTION 58ON THE FOUR WAYS OF CONDUCT AND ON [THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN] ROOT AND BRANCHESThis section begins with a discussion of human conduct with respect to the ruleslaid out by the prognostic sciences. The argument is abstract and formalistic.We are not told what the rules in question are, but the discussion leaves nodoubt that they do not involve any moral or political considerations. At stakeare advantage, auspiciousness, good fortune, and their opposites, to variousdegrees and in surprising combinations. The approach is that of an expert in thediagnosis of options for future development. He is involved in prognostics as ascholarly subject. Thus for him the fortunate and the unfortunate rank first,since their case is clear, and what exists in the gray area between the twoextremes is problematic.This radical approach is modified in the second part of the section, in whichthe origins of inauspicious conduct are analyzed through the use of the root andbranches analogy. Each move away from the root or, in other words, the slightestnegligent behavior is said to incur risk. Such movement gains its own momentum,just as a river grows larger by flowing downward. Thus deterioration appears tobe a natural outcome of historical development and beyond individual influence.But a “return to the root” is always an option for the individual, particularlyat that moment when the movement away from the root—or from Yang—has peaked. Thedisciple is bound to recognize this point as the moment he lives in, with allthe devastation and the promise this entails.The last paragraph returns to the issue of change. The disciple is assured thatthe education he has received has not been in vain. The career trajectory thathas led him to become a Perfected will not be reversed now, while he is close tothe peak.Though the section covers a variety of topics, there is a certain common thread,which is the systematic approach to human conduct. The Master calls this systemthe way of the great ultimate. It is not accidental that the Celestial Masterhere mentions the great ultimate, an entity that in the Book of Changes is saidto have initiated the division of all that is into the spheres of Yin and ofYang. Between these spheres there is thought to be a continuous interchange, inwhich human conduct is included.• • •(58.93) Step forward, Perfected!Yes.How many modes of conduct does man have?Hundreds and thousands.No. What you have said is the same as common people would say. Man has fourmodes of conduct. One of them is puzzling.1 [Notes.xhtml#ch17fn1]How would you call them?Well, when conduct is not good, it is bad.2 [Notes.xhtml#ch17fn2] Conduct thatis neither good nor bad maintains a certain unstable balance. If it is good atone time and bad at another, it is messy and inconstant. If it cannot be reliedupon to be either good or bad, then fortune and misfortune will have no[well-defined] place.Excellent.How many ways of conduct are there in regard to fortune and misfortune?Thousands and millions.You speak as common people might do. There are four different ways of conductfor fortune and misfortune, one of them puzzling.How would you call them?Well, when we are not fortunate in all we do we suffer from misfortune. Shouldwe be neither fortunate nor the opposite, our fate is in some unstable balance.If we are sometimes in luck and sometimes unlucky, both mixed together, this ismessy and inconstant, and fortune and misfortune cannot be prognosticated.3[Notes.xhtml#ch17fn3]Excellent.All right. [Now] to the nature (xing 性) of heaven and earth: How many[combinations of] good and bad are there in a year, a month, and a day?4[Notes.xhtml#ch17fn4]Too many to list them.What you say is confused and unclear, as if you were drunk. Year, month, and daydevelop in four different ways in the realms of heaven and earth. As soon as oneis in a messy state, disasters and anomalies occur.What do you mean?Well, listen closely! (58.94) Now should a year in heaven and on earth not beprosperous, it is bound to be bad. When it is neither prosperous nor bad itmaintains a certain balance. Should it be good for some time and then bad atanother time, it is a year when heaven is changeable and puzzling.5[Notes.xhtml#ch17fn5] Now if it’s a day, it is bound to be bad if it is notgood. If it is neither good nor bad it will be a day—or a month—of some unstablebalance. Conduct that is good for some time and bad at some other time will bepuzzling and bring forth anomalies, irregular events, and disasters. I can onlygive you a general idea and show how it all begins.6 [Notes.xhtml#ch17fn6] Thisis the way things happen in this world.What do you mean?Well, unless they are good, the world’s ten thousand beings, as well as itspeople, are all steeped in evil. To be neither good nor bad is balanced conduct.To be good at times and bad at other times is deceptive conduct; it can’tachieve anything. Balanced conduct must not be encouraged. Only men who arereally good or really bad make a name for themselves.7 [Notes.xhtml#ch17fn7]Why are there exactly four modes of conduct?8 [Notes.xhtml#ch17fn8]This is a good question. We may say that you understand dao’s intention. Well,to be really good resembles the pure conduct of great Yang, while to be reallyevil is like the malignant behavior of great Yin. There is both good and evil intheir intercourse (zhonghe 中合). Should [human] conduct lack constancy, heavenand earth, the intercourse between [Yin and Yang], the lord, his subordinates,the people, and the ten thousand plants and beings miss the right way (daolu道路). This is why men must follow standard [norms]. You will be quite good if youstick to Yang, and quite bad if you stick to Yin. Act according to theirintercourse and you will arrive9 [Notes.xhtml#ch17fn9] at a balance. Shouldfortune and misfortune not be constant, one’s conduct follows neither model normeasure.10 [Notes.xhtml#ch17fn10] For this reason the wise and worthy of oldthoroughly observed heaven and earth; the year, month, and day; the people; andthe ten thousand plants and beings. They looked at increase and decrease, atexcess and balance, and at progress and decline. Hence they knew for themselveswhich conduct would succeed and which would fail, just as your appearancebecomes distinct when you look at yourself in a bright mirror.11[Notes.xhtml#ch17fn11]Excellent, indeed! Now what does one have to do?Well, in your conduct hold onto the root, and take heaven as your model. This isthe beginning. Once you take earth as your model, outlaws become rampant. Totake the space between the two as your model is next best. To be withoutconstancy ranks last.12 [Notes.xhtml#ch17fn12]Why have men nowadays become so inconstant in their conduct?Well, the ancestors erred a little through neglect, next came small-scalemisbehavior, then some on a large scale, and finally they erred a lot. The way’s(daolu) root (genben) became fussy and confused, and one could no longer rely onits intentions. That is why men’s conduct became inconstant. They made changesto what they had said earlier, and the years of their life did not passuniformly. So, clearly, dao had been corrupted to the extreme13[Notes.xhtml#ch17fn13] and there was a need to return to the root. But when thewise men of old saw this, they knew that what had been dispersed was bound toturn back once it had reached the outer end. Therefore, they remained in powerand kept their celestial mandate. So when the great worthy and wise observematters they see clearly that good fortune comes from nothing but constancy.(58.95) Would you like to hear some further proof?If the Celestial Master would only be so kind as to let us know about it!All right. The course of the year is prosperous in its root and bad when itfinishes, since Yin and Yang have then reached their end.14[Notes.xhtml#ch17fn14] Latter-born men are evil and petty when [the course of]generations has reached an end. The ten thousand beings are prosperous at theirroot and without yield toward their death: they have reached their end.Latter-born men utter many empty lies without real content, since the quality ofspeaking has reached its lowest point. When texts and writings are composed inlarge numbers and all they say is untrue, [the skill of] writing has come to anend. All of this means that you move toward the branches once you lose yourroot, and are left with [only] blossoms when you let the fruit go. So to causeheaven and earth to bring forth the ten thousand plants and beings we muststress the core of things and not their ramifications. Certainly, the fault liesin drifting away from the root toward the branches.15 [Notes.xhtml#ch17fn15] Weare deceived once we give up what is true, just as we become poor when we loseour means. So let us remain constant!16 [Notes.xhtml#ch17fn16]Thus, men became evil in their daily habits without being aware of it, just byincreasingly ignoring the model set up by heaven. Latter-born generationscontinued to take things easy. They turned to deceit and fraud. They continuallypracticed how to become spiritlike.17 [Notes.xhtml#ch17fn17] Although no longerable to restrain themselves, they falsely claimed to have full understanding, sothey inherited and transmitted more and more [evil]. They made heaven and earthspread their punishment and warnings to the four directions. Nobody can stopthis. Even humane and worthy lords and kings would not be able to end mistakesthat were committed by one generation after the other, more than ten thousandtimes in a row. An error might be small to begin with, just like a grain ofmillet, but to miss heaven’s way by the tiniest margin amounts to an error ofone thousand miles. When millet is collected, it grows to thousands and millionsof measures that fill storage houses of many levels. And rain, fallingincessantly, drop by drop, becomes one hundred streams that make up the mass ofwater of the four oceans. You must not let go of the root. So use true dao asyour measure and you will arrive back at the root once you turn away from thebranches’ tips. Fruit grows by discarding the blossoms. Truth reappears as soonas you turn away from fraud. Once the tip of a branch has been reached one mustreturn to the root; when a journey is at its end one must go home: this isheaven’s way. Now to disregard standard dao in its uprightness is not just asmall indisposition; it is a mistake that will be inherited and carried on aftera man’s life is over. The latter-born suffer from further confusion and error,so that standard dao becomes increasingly obscure and men go even furtherastray. Once heaven’s qi is perverted, how can government achieve peace? How canmen who have been poisoned or wounded live long? Since the ten thousand plantsand beings suffer from numerous injuries and die early, I entreat you again andagain to transmit my writings. Let men see for themselves: disregard dao’sintentions and you will fall ill and suffer personal grief. How, then, canheaven and earth, emperors and kings, the people and the ten thousand beings besafe? If you wish to please heaven’s feelings you must not be idle or negligent.Yes, indeed. I would like to ask one other question. Will the fortune andmisfortune you have talked about arrive only when it is their turn?Fine! Your question shows insight into dao’s intentions. (58.96) What hasreached a peak must return to the bottom, what has been stretched out as far aspossible must again be drawn in. Once the utmost of Yang has been achieved,there will be a return to Yin. What has reached the bottom must return to thepeak. So when Yin is at its extreme point, it revolves back into Yang. Thisextreme point lies in the branches. From there, one must return to the root. Nowsince the division between heaven and earth, men slowly but gradually have cometo disregard dao’s intentions. The longer this has been inherited andtransmitted the more it has brought corruption and fraud to their peak.How does one know this?By the fact that so many among the ten thousand beings and all the people turnbad in their later years when at first they were good, and that few achieveanything.18 [Notes.xhtml#ch17fn18]What do you mean by “first” and “later”?19 [Notes.xhtml#ch17fn19]At first is the true thing, and what comes later is hollow. The wise men of oldknew about this since they always watched the activities of the ten thousandpeople. Thus they never went astray.Excellent! I would like to ask one more question.Go ahead.Now if you are saying that there is a lowest and a highest state for beings, andif we consider the spiritlike man who bends qi20 [Notes.xhtml#ch17fn20] to be atthe top of the nine groups of men and the serf at the bottom, then through studysomeone at the bottom will reach the top. But will someone who is at the topalso be obliged to move downwards?Fine; so this is your question. Now you are still, as always, foolish andconfused, with no understanding for the workings (dao) of the great ultimate.21[Notes.xhtml#ch17fn21]Now the body and the strength of this spiritlike man who bends qi are the sameas that of primordial qi. In unison with the four seasons and five phases, hebrings forth life. All spirits who serve men are derived from celestial qi thathas received them from primordial qi. Spirits move about riding on qi. Thus aman in possession of qi has spirits, too, and while in possession of spirits healso has qi. Should spirits go away, qi will face an interruption, and should qibe lost, spirits will go away. That is why one dies without spirits as one dieswithout qi.22 [Notes.xhtml#ch17fn22] How should a spiritlike man who bends qiever find entry into the belly of a man?23 [Notes.xhtml#ch17fn23]Yes, indeed.Also, the five phases grow from primordial qi, while spirit has the same bodyand the same activities as primordial qi. The five phases move inside [a man] toform his five bodily organs. Should the most exalted of these nine groups of menmove downward and return to someone’s body?Excellent! Although I have studied for quite a while, this is the first time Ihave heard this. Well, you must concentrate on your studies. Otherwise, youwon’t benefit from them. Yes. When I hear the Celestial Master speak, it is asif heaven’s way was moving on its circle.All right. Let us assume that you have understood. Go, but don’t hesitate to askwhen there is a question. (58.97)Yes, certainly.24 [Notes.xhtml#ch17fn24]"},{"pageContent":"SECTION 59BIG AND SMALL REPROACHESThis section stresses the importance of communication and openness to the flowof information. While this is a topic of mainstream political thinking—asexpressed, for instance, in the Mengzi1 [Notes.xhtml#ch18fn1]—it also agreeswith the taiping ideal of sharing and cooperation. The Celestial Master placesthis subject in a cosmic context, in the tradition of cosmological andprognostic reasoning. All deviations from the regular course of nature must beseen as willed by heaven. If men refuse to interpret these deviations aswarnings or decide not to act upon them, their fate is sealed. The Master makesthis point repeatedly in strong terms, as if, despite the prestige that disasteranalysis enjoyed during much of the Han dynasty, he still had to convince hisaudience. He seems not to have been mistaken, as the disciple questions the mainpoint of his argument, which requires the Master to repeat it: once the tokensheaven has sent to signal its reproach have been ignored, heaven will cease tosend them. Men might then feel secure while being truly on the brink of ruin.The large amount of detail in this section is perhaps more than a simplerhetorical device. The details also function as a list of points an officialmust be expected to check in order to be aware of all cosmic warnings. Thedivision into “small” and “big” reproaches is formalized, as if to simplify theproper implementation of prognostic calculation.However, despite the description of natural disasters in this section, the focusis on the relationship between the ruler and his advisors. If the official isthe main human source of warnings, corresponding in this respect to heaven, thenthe period immediately preceding a breakdown might appear unperturbed, at leastfor the ruler, whose official advisors have learned to flatter him persistently.The reduction in the number of omens that were reported during the reigns ofEmperor Shun (r. 125–44) and, in particular, Emperor Xian (r. 189–220) couldactually be a case in point.2 [Notes.xhtml#ch18fn2] Such a reduction of omens ona regional scale may well be the background and the reason for what is here saidabout heaven cutting off disasters when humankind is doomed. But there is also adirect link between the breakdown of communication on the cosmic and humanlevels. A treacherous contentment will in both cases block the flow ofinformation: heaven will not send signs, thus stupefying ruler and officials;the official will not speak up; and if he did speak up, his mission might behampered by heaven, which has ceased to communicate, and by the ruler who hasceased to listen.The thesis set forth in this section conflicts to some extent with the idea thatan increase in human guilt leads to an increase in natural disasters, asdescribed in sections 47 and 48, as well as in the section at hand.• • •(59.98) The Perfected beats his head on the ground. He says:I am a foolish pupil, blind and dull. I truly don’t know anything about dao.Thanks to heaven I have now had a glimpse of safety and danger, fortune andmisfortune.3 [Notes.xhtml#ch18fn3] So I dare to ask all I can about dao‘scommandments. Are there any expressions of reproach4 [Notes.xhtml#ch18fn4] inthe way the spirits of heaven and earth [move about] in this world? If theCelestial Master would only instruct us and direct us to what dao means.You have asked about something that is mysterious5 [Notes.xhtml#ch18fn5] andfar-reaching.I have observed that men reproach each other. Thus my question is whether heavendoes likewise.Good! With this question you have grasped the true center of heaven’s way.Heaven’s vital beings6 [Notes.xhtml#ch18fn6] will come forth, and spirits ofheaven and earth will rejoice. The main points of this I will now explain to youso that7 [Notes.xhtml#ch18fn7] for ten thousand times ten thousand generationsthey will not be forgotten.Yes!Well, heaven utters a small reproach by changing color, and a big one bysplitting open. Should this not be heeded it does not occur again. When thethree luminaries reprimand men in regard to small matters, stars change color.In the case of a big rebuke, the luminaries stray from their course and losebrightness. Should this not be obeyed it will cease. Earth shakes to give aslight warning, but mountains collapse and the soil splits open for a bigreproach. If men were not to pay attention such phenomena would no longer beseen.For a small reproach by the five phases, calamities occur. In the case of a bigreproach, the eastern phase kills men through worms,8 [Notes.xhtml#ch18fn8] thesouthern phase kills them through poison[ous winds],9 [Notes.xhtml#ch18fn9] thewestern phase through tiger and wolf,10 [Notes.xhtml#ch18fn10] and the northernphase through water animals.11 [Notes.xhtml#ch18fn11] In the case of the centralphase, petty officials and ordinary subjects use poison and turn to robbery andmurder. (59.99) All this will come to an end should men ignore it. Should thefour seasons utter a slight rebuke, cold and heat will not be in balance. Whenit is an earnest reproach, they change places so that the seasons no longeroccur in proper order. Should men not pay heed such warnings cease.Vital qi12 [Notes.xhtml#ch18fn12] of the six directions wreaks havoc for a smallreproach, again and again. Vital qi breeds plagues of flying and creepinginsects. It assembles masses of clouds and wind that don’t cause rain to fall,and thus the husks remain empty, without grain. When the reproach is big,periods of flood and drought are irregular and bandits cause damage to things(wan wu 萬物) and to the people. Should men not pay heed to such warnings theywill end. When birds and four-legged animals slightly reproach men, they sendnatural calamities. Once the reproach is severe, they devour men and sendlocusts forth in large numbers. This will come to an end should the reproach notbe heeded. Demons, spirits, and other vital beings13 [Notes.xhtml#ch18fn13] thatutter a slight rebuke haunt petty officials and the people with small numbers ofbandits and diseases. In the case of a severe rebuke, they rip men apart andwipe out whole families. Should this not be heeded such warnings will come to anend. In the case of a subtle warning of the six directions, rain and wind turndisorderly and violent. They injure men in conjunction with evil and poisonousvapors. If it is a great warning they stretch sideways to tear the structure ofthe earth apart, let tiles and rocks fly about, let soil pile up againstmajestic heaven, wreck houses, and move mountains. If this is not heeded it willcome to an end. (59.100)When the sounds of heaven and earth utter a slight warning, thunder andlightning become mildly frightening. Should they utter a severe warning men willdefile and pervert each other on numerous occasions and make thunder claploudly, again and again. This will come to an end should men not pay attention.Petty officials and ordinary subjects who utter a slight warning frequentlychange allegiance. In the case of a severe warning, they turn to robbery andviolence. These warnings will end should nobody pay attention.A severe warning by the six directions and the eight ends of heaven and earthmeans that they wish the writings brought forth by the Yellow River and the Luoto be in standard order and bear witness of heaven. Auspicious texts appear inthe world to set lords and kings right so that everything under heaven is incorrespondence. Should these warnings not be heeded they will no longer takeplace. Since scriptures on heaven’s way should always be put to use we must actas they instruct us. For this reason, as soon as the wise and worthy of oldnoticed an event they did nothing but discuss and deliberate14[Notes.xhtml#ch18fn14] its meaning. They did not dare remain idle and negligentand thereby lose the breadth of a hair in their understanding of the subtlemessage this event had put forth. Since they did not ignore what majestic heavenhad on its mind, they were able to maintain their person and secure theirabode15 [Notes.xhtml#ch18fn15] free from worries and peril. Disaster did notstrike. Plans and calculations met heaven’s intentions.Excellent, indeed. I have understood. Only now do I clearly see the model youhave outlined. I would like to hear the meaning of “therefore [warnings] wouldcome to an end.” It must be brought to light.16 [Notes.xhtml#ch18fn16]Your attitude is excellent! Well, heaven’s way assists and eases education. Ithelps men to be completely sincere17 [Notes.xhtml#ch18fn17] as well as attentiveand observant.18 [Notes.xhtml#ch18fn18] It helps and eases understanding andinstruction. It teaches a sovereign it wants to be mighty (hou 厚).19[Notes.xhtml#ch18fn19] Otherwise, it won’t teach him. This is similar to men whoexplain events to those they are intimate with (qin hou 親厚) and don’t like togive explanations to others they are not intimate with. Should someone not payattention when taught, heaven will be annoyed that it has spoken at the wrongtime and will therefore discard and dismiss such a person and never againattempt to teach and guide him. At this point, natural calamities, disasters,and other anomalies will come to a standstill. When [heaven] no longer guidesand instructs men, even the worthy and the wise become deaf; they are in thedark and know nothing. All their insight is blocked. Should the spirits ofheaven and earth no longer wish to reproach men, natural calamities and otherirregular events would happen more and more frequently. There is no remedyagainst it, and men will become weaker from day to day until they lose theirposition in the world.20 [Notes.xhtml#ch18fn20] (59.101)This is why the wise and worthy of old withdrew day and night from business inorder to think deeply. They never dared ignore what heaven felt, so they wereable to serve majestic heaven as father and majestic earth as mother, the sun asolder brother and the moon as younger brother. They kept the firmament (tian wen天文) in correct shape and the five phases stable. By following the four seasonsthey observed their coming and going. Through self-reflection,21[Notes.xhtml#ch18fn21] they corrected their conduct. By understanding [things]thoroughly they knew about gain and loss.22 [Notes.xhtml#ch18fn22] Theiressential dao23 [Notes.xhtml#ch18fn23] was simply [the way in which] heaven andearth maintained themselves. They took heaven’s support, expressed in YellowRiver maps and Luo writings, as their mandate. (59.102) For this reason alltheir actions were in correspondence, as if they were spirits. Only by thesemeans did they thoroughly fulfill heaven’s wishes. Their words were a precisefit, as if compasses and carpenter’s square had been applied. So spirits andother numinous beings were busy on their behalf. Should men be obstinate andrefuse to heed such reproach heaven will go backward and the earth astray. Inuproar, the five phases and four seasons will go the wrong way and lose theirorder. Then activities will go wrong and big disasters will occur. This is whatis meant by “[warnings] will come to an end.” Is this any clearer?Yes, it is.So it is in unison with the nature of heaven and earth that subordinatesreprimand their superiors and that superiors reproach their subordinates. Eachhas strong points as well as shortcomings. Only when both support each otherwill each of the heavenly way’s ten thousand activities (fan wan 凡萬) be in itsright place. So, when compared to earth, majestic heaven, spiritlike and wise asit may be, has certain weak points.24 [Notes.xhtml#ch18fn24] The reason is that,although the ten thousand beings receive life from heaven, they gain food fortheir body from earth. The three luminaries in one respect fall short of fire:although spiritlike and bright, they cannot shine in a dark chamber as fire can.A great wise man has shortcomings when compared to a worthy, and men haveshortcomings when compared to the ten thousand beings. Once the system of mutualreproach reaches all the way down to the very smallest item, we won’t lose daoor ignore heaven’s intentions. For this reason heaven has brought forth allactivities in such a way that they sometimes undergo reform.25[Notes.xhtml#ch18fn25] To reproach the ruler of men is always a token of perfectvirtue that deserves full attention.26 [Notes.xhtml#ch18fn26] This is what wemean by mutual criticism of heaven, earth, and the ten thousand beings.Yes, indeed. I wish men would put into effect the explanations that the Masterof Majestic Heaven (huang tian shi 皇天師) has put forward!Fine. Make sure to heed what I say and to think about it. If a loyal andfaithful official were to reprimand his superior and the lord did not listen butinstead tried to harm him, the official would turn frightened and tongue-tied,as if he were dumb. Nothing would get through [to the lord], as if he werebehind doors closed in all six directions. The worthy and learned27[Notes.xhtml#ch18fn27] would hide in fear. The loyal and the faithful would shutthemselves in and the true doctrine (dao) would nowhere be seen. Then, even ifthe lord were wise and worthy, he would have no way to hear about things. Hewould thus turn deaf and blind. He would have no means to observe unusual andstrange occurrences. Increasingly, they would be shrouded in darkness, the lorddeaf and the official dumb. If this misfortune were not checked, the officialwould be in the dark and the lord blind. Depravity and evil would spread widely.Should the official be dumb and the lord deaf the world would not reach them.Good and evil would not be distinguished. Heaven-sent calamities would becomeuniversal, fighting would break out at the six ends of the world, disasterswould occur one after the other, everywhere.28 [Notes.xhtml#ch18fn28] How canone not pay attention to this!Yes, indeed.For this reason the wise and worthy of old paid close attention to naturalcalamities, disasters, and other irregular events. They set things right inperson, as if with a marking line, so that nothing went wrong. They were trulyin agreement with the great teachings of the major texts. (59.103) Completelyloyal in all their undertakings, they suffered from no further disasters. Youhave been warned repeatedly; pay attention to my words.Yes, I will.Well, heaven is not high and bright because of the merit and virtue of onesingle vital spirit (jing 精). The government of emperors and kings does not meetheaven’s approval just because of one single worthy official. Now my words are ageneral outline to point out where to begin. It is not possible to write orspeak about every detail. You will have to figure out for yourself what it allmeans.Yes, I will.All right, you may go. How should words [ever] reach to the end? Ask no morequestions.Yes, I understand.29 [Notes.xhtml#ch18fn29]"},{"pageContent":"SECTION 60HOW BOOKS ILLUSTRATE [RULE BY] PUNISHMENT AND [BY] VIRTUERulers who establish their authority by applying the penal code prevent thearrival of great peace. The Celestial Master states this repeatedly, arguingthat the misery of those who perish in prisons and those whose lives are cutshort causes heaven to be vengeful and inclines it to send calamities. Another,more formalistic, train of thought follows in this section. Here, the course ofthe year is said to represent what severe government and what a reign by virtuecan achieve. As if it were self- evident, the text identifies Yang with virtueon the one hand, and Yin with punishment on the other. The ruler is expected toensure that his government corresponds with the span of the year from midwinterto midsummer, that is, to the period of growing Yang and growing virtue. Sincethis section takes up a topic that has always been central to Chinese politicalphilosophy, presuppositions abound. That the people as well as the ruler bothdesire a stable and permanent government is taken for granted, and so is thesovereign’s dependence on the social elite. The ruler here is compared to thenatural force that makes the seasons follow one another. This comparison throwsa new light on the ruler’s relationship to the other groups in the politicalarena.The section is unusually long and contains two separate dialogues on the sametopic. The dialogues are arranged differently but convey roughly the samemessage. The changing influence of “virtue” and “punishment” from day to day andfrom month to month was a well-known aspect of ancient cosmology,1[Notes.xhtml#ch19fn1] but there do not seem to be any other examples of the wayin which this section applies it.The text argues that the relationship between punishment and virtue is theessential lesson to be drawn from the course of nature. Virtue is shown asgrowing with the growth of plants from one month to the next until it hasmatured and gives way to punishment, whose growth coincides with the decay ofvegetation in autumn and winter.This is followed by a passage on the antagonism that violent rule creates andthe popularity that results from virtuous conduct. The argument is notfundamentalist but allows for degrees. The more punishment a ruler applies, themore insurrections he will face, while the extent of his benevolence directlyaffects the obedience he can expect from his subjects. A violent ruler will lackmen who support him and will therefore lose his position. On the other hand,moral conduct and benevolent practices enable a man to assemble followers, tobecome a king, and to reign successfully.At this point the first dialogue ends and is followed by the second, whichraises the same points in a different order. The disciple argues that a strongand severe government should be able to coerce people into submission. Thisforces the Master into an argument that hints at historical reality, thoughwithout giving names and details. The Master argues that severe governmentdrives men into hiding rather than into submission. This is followed by another,slightly more concise, account of the annual cycle of “virtue” and “punishment.”The Master takes a more radical stance here than in the first dialogue, and heargues that each act of violence and of virtue has widespread repercussions.This section can be seen as a reaction to certain political tendencies thatbecame manifest during the reign of Emperor Huan.2 [Notes.xhtml#ch19fn2] One wasthe attempt by Cui Shi 崔寞 and others to make punishment more severe.3[Notes.xhtml#ch19fn3] Another, described by Rafe de Crespigny, was an increasingtendency among those selected for office not to accept it, out of contempt forthe emperor and his surroundings and because of the great risk involved inraising any objections against the emperor’s way of ruling. Wei Huan’s 魏桓response to his neighbors, who wanted him to take the position at court that hehad been offered, says it all:“If I were seeking salary and advancement I would thereby get what I want. Yetthere are thousands of women in the imperial chambers, and how shall theirnumber be reduced? There are tens of thousands of horses in the imperialstables, and how shall their number be diminished? The attendants at theimperial court are powerful and oppressive, and how can they be removed?” Allreplied, “This cannot be done.” Then Huan sighed and said, “You ask that Ishould go away alive and come back dead [for I should inevitably be killed whencriticizing these abuses]. How can you require this of me?” So he went intohiding and would not go.4 [Notes.xhtml#ch19fn4]• • •(60.104) Perfected Chun bows respectfully [and says]:Now in asking this question I am bound to commit a serious offense. When Iponder the master’s writings I know they are all true and contain nothing thatneeds modification. But this pupil is foolish and dull. It vexes me not to knowwhere you found the model that you have shown us. I know that you are theillustrious teacher, the spiritlike man sent by majestic heaven, but still I amperplexed by the sheer number of your words. If you would only5[Notes.xhtml#ch19fn5] have mercy and point to the essential proof for thelessons we are to draw from heaven’s Yin and Yang and for the predictions castby the spirits of heaven and earth.6 [Notes.xhtml#ch19fn6] I am annoyed andconfused because I cannotfigure it out. Of course, what I say goes against yourprohibitions, but I am unable to control the desire to speak out. Although youwill criticize me, I wish that you would give us a clear illustration of thetoken and the model provided by heaven7 [Notes.xhtml#ch19fn7] so that it can betransmitted for ten thousand times ten thousand generations, brilliant beyondall doubt and bright as the sun at noon, never to be changed and never to goaway.Well, you are determined not to trust my words, aren’t you? As if you, for yourpart, had not yet properly learned to understand heaven’s intentions! As if youwere a fool! You are hardly better than the common people if you think that mywords can be opposed! Whoever opposes them will be in disarray. Whoever actsagainst them will suffer defeat. Everything I tell you is supported by thepatterns of heaven.8 [Notes.xhtml#ch19fn8] Everything I say agrees with thegreat lesson we can draw from Yin and Yang. You have come to ask questions onbehalf of heaven; I transmit orders on its behalf. I would not dare to sayanything improper, meaningless, and false or to use artful language. You havelived through quite a number of years, months, and days and experienced quite alot. Yet you still don’t see how the ten thousand beings in their confusion9[Notes.xhtml#ch19fn9] (60.105) all tend to stay where there is virtue and toavoid qi that arises from punishment. This is the clear token set up by pure,majestic heaven. It thereby sends a severe warning to rulers of how governmentachieves gain and loss.Yes, indeed. Now this is as if I had understood, although I have not yetunderstood. I would like to ask for more instruction.Well, [the relationship between] punishment and virtue is a clear token of thespiritlike reign of heaven and earth and Yin and Yang. It sets the rule for theten thousand beings and for the people. Thus in the eleventh month great virtueis positioned as nine in first place,10 [Notes.xhtml#ch19fn10] below the ground.At this time virtue is within the chamber,11 [Notes.xhtml#ch19fn11] so qi isinside and the ten thousand plants and beings return to it. Punishment is at thesame time positioned as six in top position,12 [Notes.xhtml#ch19fn12] in thefour distant regions of open fields. So outside there is no qi, everything isbare. Since the outside is devoid of the ten thousand plants and beings,[spirit] cohorts return to virtue.13 [Notes.xhtml#ch19fn13] They follow it tothe region below the Yellow Springs.14 [Notes.xhtml#ch19fn14]In the twelfth month, virtue is positioned as nine in second place. [The handleof the Dipper at midnight points to] chou [, the second earthly branch].[Plants] are within the soil of the earth and not yet coming forth. At thistime, virtue resides in the Hall of Light.15 [Notes.xhtml#ch19fn15] The tenthousand plants and beings follow it and begin to rise but don’t yet dare showthemselves. Up above, punishment reigns.In the first month, [the handle of the Dipper points to] yin [, the third of thetwelve branches]. Virtue is positioned as nine in third place. Each of the tenthousand plants and beings follows perfect virtue and delights in peeping out atheaven and earth.16 [Notes.xhtml#ch19fn16] Thus they all grow. At this time,virtue resides at court.In the second month, virtue is positioned as nine in fourth place. [The handleof the Dipper points to] mao [, the fourth branch]. [Plants] are already leavingthe ground. They have not yet quite reached the open (tian, “sky”) but are justabove the border [between heaven and earth]. Virtue is at the gate. Thus the tenthousand plants enjoy peeping through it.In the third month, virtue, now in perfect form, is positioned as nine in fifthplace. [The handle of the Dipper points to] chen [, the fifth earthly branch].Stretching upward to the middle of the sky (tian),17 [Notes.xhtml#ch19fn17]perfect virtue is at this time outside on the roads and in the alleys. Thus theten thousand plants all step forth to live outside.In the fourth month, [the handle of the Dipper points to] si [, the sixthbranch]. Virtue is positioned as nine at the top of the hexagram. It stretchesall the way to the six distances and eight borders.18 [Notes.xhtml#ch19fn18] Ithas grown to perfect size in the eight directions. When qi is good and is Yang,everything responds and brings forth life. (60.106) In confusion, things leavethe inner chamber and go to the open fields. Punishment is at the root of theten thousand plants, situated in the inner chamber, at this time. Thus in thevoid down below there are no plants, while they grow in abundance aboveground.They all want to follow virtue and be governed by it. This is a great token for[the need] to reign by virtue.Now that I have been privileged to hear about the function of virtue, I wouldlike to hear about that of punishment.Well, in the fifth month, punishment is positioned as six in first place. [Thehandle of the Dipper at midnight points to] wu [, the seventh earthly branch].Punishment is belowground. It is bare down there, without qi. The realmsbelowground are empty. At this time, punishment resides in the chamber. Plantsare not inside, but all out in the open.In the sixth month, punishment is positioned as six in second place. [The handleof the Dipper points to] wei [, the eighth branch]. Punishment is situatedwithin the soil and has not yet become manifest. While it resides in the hall,its qi is inside and virtue’s qi is outside. All beings and plants in theirconfusion enjoy presenting themselves and flocking to perfect virtue.In the seventh month, punishment is positioned as six in third place. [Thehandle of the Dipper points to] shen [, the ninth branch]. Punishment resides atcourt at this time. The ten thousand plants and beings don’t yet dare go insidebut are determined to enjoy their stay outside.In the eighth month, punishment is positioned as six in fourth place. [Thehandle of the Dipper points to] you [, the tenth branch]. At this timepunishment, although moving upward, has not yet reached the horizon. Virtue isat the gate at this time, so the ten thousand plants and beings take pleasure inpeeping through it. They would like to follow virtue and come back in.In the ninth month, punishment is positioned as six in fifth place. [The handleof the Dipper points to] xu [, the eleventh branch]. Punishment, stretching tothe middle of the sky (tian), is at this time on the roads and in the alleys.The ten thousand plants are on the verge of dying. They follow virtue and moveinto places of storage, so there is continuous growth on the inside while theoutside becomes empty and void.In the tenth month, punishment is positioned as six on top of the hexagram. [Thehandle of the Dipper points to] hai [, the twelfth branch]. At this time,punishment reaches the six distant regions, eight borders, and four stretches ofopen field. The ten thousand plants in their confusion escape to storage places.They go with virtue until they reach the Hall of Light. Four-legged creaturescuddle up inside. Outlying regions are empty. There are no cohorts in sight.Someone who likes to apply punishments will see [others] move away.19[Notes.xhtml#ch19fn19] Or don’t you think so?Should you attempt to control your cohorts in a frame of mind that endorsespunishment their number will lessen from one day to the next. Thus in the fifthmonth, when one set of punishments is endorsed, one group will stage aninsurrection. In the sixth month, when two sets of punishments are endorsed, twogroups will rise up and so forth, until in the tenth month six groups willrebel.20 [Notes.xhtml#ch19fn20] Thus the outside will be deprived of all plantsand beings. Everything takes refuge inside. This clearly proves it. So if yougovern by punishing others they will show awe and respect on the outside, butinside there will be rebellion. Therefore, your cohorts will lessen from day today.One group will show deference for one portion of virtue harbored [by a ruler],[as is the case] in the eleventh month; (60.107) two groups will submit for twoportions of virtue, [as shown] in the twelfth month; three groups will submitfor three portions of virtue, [as] in the first month; and groups from the fourdirections will respond to four portions of virtue, [as] in the second month.Five groups of worthies will become his followers if [the ruler] harbors fiveportions of perfect Yang- type virtue, [as] in the third month. The ten thousandplants and beings will make an appearance if he harbors all six portions ofvirtue,21 [Notes.xhtml#ch19fn21] [as is the case] in the fourth month. They willall, in their confusion, return from within to the outside. This is heaven’sclear token.Virtue and punishment are on a par in the second and the eighth months; thusplants are halfway damaged by the cold in the second month, just as in theeighth month. In the second month virtue wishes to send its cohorts out throughthe gate. At the same time, punishment expects to move its cohorts insidethrough the gate. They are all situated at the border [between heaven andearth]. Thus in the second and the eighth months punishment and virtue happen tomeet each other in the ten thousand plants and beings. Life and death are on apar; half the amount of possible damage takes place. If you want to know theconstant model that heaven and earth have set up and have a clear token of howYin and Yang work, this is it.22 [Notes.xhtml#ch19fn22]Now since men detest and fear a ruler who makes punishment ever more oppressive,they do not give him their labor power. Instead, the ruler has fewer and fewermen to employ. But more and more [men] would yield if he were to let virtueexpand and grow from day to day, to apply neither punishment nor penalties, andnot to create fear among the ten thousand beings. They would all return to himand support his reign. This is heaven’s clear token. It is so striking that nodoubt is possible.Nowadays subjects cannot be governed unless they are in awe and fear. What aboutthis? (60.108)Well, the wise men and exemplary gentlemen (junzi 君子) of old inspired awe inothers through dao and its virtue, not by physical strength or punishment andpenalties. Men who don’t enjoy virtuous conduct will instead attempt to supporttheir rule through punishment and penalties, fear and terror. Yet all theyachieve is others moving away [from them]. All punishment does is make peoplegive up, become destitute, depart, and desert; it is not what is required forthe ten thousand plants and beings to grow. It clearly increases theirconfusion. Now this makes people disregard authority23 [Notes.xhtml#ch19fn23]and turn to deceptive methods. It is a great mistake.Now you have been coming to study for quite some time. You have asked a numberof questions and have collected a great many writings, but you still can’tbelieve my words. You still don’t understand?Chun beats his head on the ground and bows respectfully before the Master. [Hesays]:I am greatly to blame. I have turned my back on the words of an enlightenedteacher and spiritlike man. Deeply mortified, I perspire from shame. I am indeedfoolish: I have accomplished little and feel utterly worthless. Although I havestudied many a day, I am still benighted and unable to fully comprehend theenlightened teacher’s words. I dare not ask any further questions. I have beengreatly immodest. I have annoyed you so much for such a long time.No, don’t say that.24 [Notes.xhtml#ch19fn24] It is because you don’t payattention to your studies. Be on guard. Heaven sets up images as a model for menand as a lesson for emperors and kings on how to conduct themselves without failwhile they rule. If you wish to know, this is the precise meaning of this model.Should government not have recourse to it, heaven will remain restless andangry. If this is not resolved, disaster and calamity are bound to follow. Bewarned! For heaven to provide prosperity, choose virtue as the image that guidesyou. Someone who is about to lose chooses punishment. This is what I want tosay.What I say shows regard for heaven and earth and Yin and Yang and conforms totheir rules and regulations. It complies with the order of heaven and earth. Ienlighten you by explaining the records and by means of moral instruction, forthe sake of heaven. I don’t err by the tip of an arrow. Follow my words and youwill continue to prosper. Oppose them and you will perish.Heaven’s model is wonderful, just like a spirit!This is the reason why the spiritlike, the perfected, and the great wise men ofold were well equipped to set up model and measure. They all observed heaven’svital patterns when they defined rules and regulations on behalf of emperors andkings. Knowing deep inside what Yin and Yang meant, they were able to rule inobedience to heaven and earth. (60.109) Being of one mind with spirits and otherenlightened beings and observing their actions, they ruled without the slightestfault. Nowadays certain foolish petty officials and ordinary people believe thatthe example set by heaven can be ignored or opposed. So they don’t rely on modeland law, which quite upsets their lord’s reign. All this is most blameworthy.Now that you have received writings, why don’t you investigate their concern andintention? Think about it again and again while you are inside the dark chamber.Once you keep in mind heaven’s movements, you can transmit its teachings, thatis, advise men who are foolish and help emperors and kings set up model andmeasure. Someone about to employ punishment and penalties must deeply pondertheir effect. He will see all his followers25 [Notes.xhtml#ch19fn25] leavinghim. Isolated, without cohorts, he will be on his own, just as in winterpunishment resides in the four regions of open fields devoid of men, while theten thousand plants and beings move in protest to places of storage to avoidpunishment as best as they can. In summer, when punishment is inside, the tenthousand plants and beings return outside to virtue and the underground chambersbecome empty. Punishment resides isolated on its own, since everyone hasfollowed virtue to the open fields. As long as virtue is outside, the tenthousand plants and beings will turn back to the outside. When it resides withinthe dark hollow, they all return inside.Now26 [Notes.xhtml#ch19fn26] [I understand that whoever rules by] punishment isextreme in his severity and takes pleasure in his ability to subdue the peopleand the ten thousand plants and beings. But why is he unable to keep his cohortsunder control? Isn’t this unusual?It shows that punishment must not be applied in a lighthearted and carelessmanner. Injure one single item of upright qi and heaven’s qi will be in uproar.Damage one qi that moves in the right way and all of earth’s qi will go thewrong way. Offend one educated gentleman and they will all vanish; harm oneworthy person and they will all go into hiding.27 [Notes.xhtml#ch19fn27] Allactivities are under some influence. For this reason the wise men, wise kings,and emperors of the past saw it as their priority to look thoroughly at suchwritings that convey heaven’s warnings. Full of fear they did not dare to act atrandom. They were afraid of failing to grasp heaven’s intention and thus ofrisking their own safety. A man whose virtue derives from highest majesticheaven thoroughly understands the tokens of dao and its virtue; he will never besevere and rigid, nor frighten and terrify others. So cohorts will come to staywith him. Thus you must safeguard dao to keep yourself intact and safeguardvirtue so that you don’t venture any loss.Since you have received my writings you must recite and read them. (60.110)Should you have any doubts, investigate each chapter again and again, frommorning to night, until you will perceive what it warns against and how itproves it. You will then be close to grasping heaven’s feelings and intentions.To act against them is to oppose heaven, just as the [\"male,” first] qian 乾 andthe [\"female,” second] kun 坤 hexagrams of the Yi jing must not turn into theiropposites, the six jia 甲 dates must not change their order, the eternal model ofthe five phases must not be neglected, and the brightness of the sun and themoon must not be covered up.28 [Notes.xhtml#ch19fn28] That the lord is placed upon high and the official down below must not be overturned. From this it isclear that the reign of heaven and earth and Yin and Yang favors virtuousconduct. There are some foolish men who are fond of punishing [others], and theymust continue to look at these writings until their misconceptions are resolved.The task is to instruct people to become good and educated, to safeguard dao andvirtue, and to attempt to avoid the use of punishment and penalties. What mywritings say agrees with29 [Notes.xhtml#ch19fn29] the model and measure ofupright heaven. To go by dao and virtue is easy, to employ punishment andpenalties difficult. Continuous growth stems from loving concern and loss stemsfrom severity. Go quickly to transmit my writings, on behalf of heaven. Beconfident! What they say deals with all the confusion that prevails in theworld.Yes, indeed. I will sincerely think about the mistakes that have been made. Iwill ponder [your text] from beginning to end. I would not dare omit a singleitem.Fine, just be careful and attentive. If you can’t figure out in detail what mywritings mean, just look at the general picture of heaven and earth and Yin andYang. From spring to autumn, when virtue remains outside, the ten thousandplants and beings go back outside. Insects that had been hibernating come fromtheir caves, and people step out of their houses. From autumn to spring, whenvirtue is inside, the ten thousand plants and beings return inside. Hibernating[insects] and stored [produce] go inside, and people enter their houses. This isthe token of virtue’s reign.From spring to autumn punishment rules inside, so the ten thousand plants andbeings step outside. Inside it is empty. [Punishment] resides there isolated andon its own. From autumn to spring, as long as punishment reigns outside, thereare neither plants nor qi. It is void, without any cohorts, all of which areinside, having joined virtue. This proves clearly that one cannot rule throughpunishment.Thus the virtuous man agrees with heaven and joins forces with it. Going outsidewhen Yang moves outside, he steps inside when Yang does. [To apply] punishment[means to] join forces and agree with the earth, and in this way [someone] movesoutside when Yin moves outside while coming in when Yin does. Since the virtuousman joins forces with life’s qi, he steps outside and returns inside as life’sqi does. [But] by [applying] punishment [a man] joins qi of death and comesforth and retires together with it. The virtuous man moves upward joiningheaven, while by applying punishment one moves downward, in line with earth.(60.111) Virtue is always together with things that are full; punishment is inthe empty space where there is nothing. Virtue is always where growth is, sowhen things grow outside it steps out, and when they move inside, it movesindoors. This is why it comes in during winter and moves outside in summer.Punishment keeps company with qi of decay and death. Thus it moves outdoors inwinter and comes in during summer. Since qi of death is bare, its surroundingsare bare. Therefore virtue shares qi with emperors and kings. When kings rulethrough external relatives they bring Yin forward, and when they rule throughthe royal family punishment is kept inside.30 [Notes.xhtml#ch19fn30] Punishmentis of the same rank as small-minded men. Thus the place where it resides isdevoid of cohorts.Someone to whom beings return will accumulate the virtue of an emperor or aking. Since everything returns to him, he is given the name “emperor” or “king.”Punishment never shares a place with beings, and someone without cohorts won’tbe called a gentleman (junzi 君子). For this reason the wise men of oldindependently and thoroughly thought about and watched the ways of heaven andearth and Yin and Yang to make them a teacher and a model.31[Notes.xhtml#ch19fn31] You can’t go wrong when you know this great reliableproof.32 [Notes.xhtml#ch19fn32] Thus, don’t dare oppose it. This is exactly thetoken that has been set up by heaven and earth. It must not be slighted! It mustnot be ignored! It is the model of what is as it is (ziran fa 自然法) and does notstem from human beings but from the constant movement of heaven and earth. Thisis all I have to tell you for now. You must continue to ponder its meaning andbe careful in what you do.Yes, I will. I would not dare turn away from it.All right. Now I have transmitted to you all the truly exemplary sayings. Myworries are over. On behalf of heaven I have attempted to set an end towrongdoings in order to promote perfect virtue and strengthen the king’sgovernment. Don’t give this up. Otherwise, you might run into trouble.Yes, indeed.33 [Notes.xhtml#ch19fn33]"},{"pageContent":"SECTION 61ON DIGGING UP SOIL AND PUBLISHING BOOKSAlthough this section is long and long-winded, it is well composed and notrepetitive. The disciple’s questions and objections make the argument plausibleand convincing. The section takes as its starting point the close resemblancebetween soil and mother. The section stresses the close relationship betweenpeople and their natural surroundings. Heaven and earth are depicted as motherand father, the former nagging, the latter punishing. Earth nurses its childrenthrough its natural springs; it suffers pain from injuries to its skin and body.Men can be to earth what intestinal worms, fleas, and tooth bugs are to men. Theparallels drawn between the human realm and that of heaven and earth are carriedso far that the Celestial Master adds the reminder that heaven and earth arenature (tian), and therefore different from men.In this section the Master also issues drastic restrictions. Wells and canals,as well as newly constructed houses and grave mounds, must be limited in sizeand number. These commandments are new, a point that is stressed twice.1[Notes.xhtml#ch20fn1] The final part of the section deals with the missionaryproject, the disciples’ role in it, and its historical time frame. The worldmust presently be reformed because great peace is about to arrive and heaven’sposition is strong. For the first time in history heaven is able to employassistants of its own choice, among them the Perfected, and thus make itsintentions public.Although the Master’s message cannot be found in other material in these exactterms, it is embedded in a long tradition of environmental concern.2[Notes.xhtml#ch20fn2] The Huainan zi, for instance, has much to say on the abuseof natural resources. Mining, construction work, building, and hunting endangerthe authority and power of a sovereign.3 [Notes.xhtml#ch20fn3] Or, to giveanother example, the 180 Precepts of the later Daoist tradition contain a numberof commandments that have an environmental impact: “You should not improperlydig the earth or spoil mountains and rivers” “You should not block up ponds andwells” “You should not throw foul things into wells.”4 [Notes.xhtml#ch20fn4]The TPJ makes a major contribution to this tradition, mainly because of theCelestial Master’s great interest in and philosophical approach to the people ‘sdaily life. As he sees it, human survival is based upon a compromise betweenman’s interests and those of heaven and earth. Man may take from earth the waterhe can’t do without and build some shelter for his protection, but if he goesfurther than this, earth’s distress and heaven’s anger will put all humanexistence at risk. In addition, the clearing of hillsides by burning grass,bushes, and trees is not permitted, although these methods may be attempted onlevel ground.5 [Notes.xhtml#ch20fn5]The internal coherence of this section is combined with several formal ruptures.The section consists of three parts; these are, as I see it, the notes of threedifferent dialogues. The first explains and defends a set of prohibitions: it isthe nature of earth that certain offenses will make it barren. This part isinterrupted by the editorial note “He also says.” The second part, which startswith “Step forward, Perfected”6 [Notes.xhtml#ch20fn6] and deals with the diggingof wells, is closely related to the first part, merely adding anotherprohibition. The last part, separated from the second by a sequence ofadmonitions and the sending away of the disciple, views the precedingprohibitions in a historical light: their implementation is more important nowthan ever before because of heaven’s increasingly direct involvement in theaffairs of men.• • •(61.112) I am foolish and worth nothing, but I still can’t help wishing to ask aquestion. Although it is a great fault to offend the Celestial Master’sprohibitions, I can’t subdue my wish to speak, as if I were a small-minded manunable to control his desires. My body’s five organs are tormented and anxious.Please allow me to raise one big question. If you would only deal with me as ifI were a small child that must be forgiven its craving and greed!Speak up! How modest you are!Yes, I will speak. Now the Celestial Master always shares the vital thoughts ofmajestic heaven and venerable earth. Your heart is in profound agreement withtheir intentions, as if compasses and carpenter’s square had been used. Not thebreadth of a hair is amiss. I know that heaven and earth are always worried andtormented,7 [Notes.xhtml#ch20fn7] which mortifies even me, foolish andinadequate as I am. Thus I dare to step forward and ask all sorts of questions.I would like to know what the major prohibitions are that are eternally upheldby spirits and other numinous beings of heaven and earth.Good, you are becoming more refined! What you are now asking pertains directlyto the feelings and the intention of heaven and earth. Let someone understandthem, enlighten the worthies about it, and [this knowledge] will not be lost foranother ten thousand generations. I have always wanted to discuss this matter,but there had been no occasion.8 [Notes.xhtml#ch20fn8] Now that you have asked,I am quite happy. I am about to explain it to you in all its different parts. Iwould not dare keep anything hidden. If I did, I am afraid that heaven’s andearth’s spirits and other numinous beings would deeply detest me and might inconsequence strike me with disaster. You must sit still and pay attention. Whatheaven and earth find most detestable is a wicked person who is disobedient andlacks filial piety. (61.113)What do you mean? I wish I knew!A good question. Now the three qi of heaven, earth, and the space between thembelong close together, as if they were one family. Moreover, they are jointly incontrol of life and nourish the ten thousand beings. Heaven dominates thecreation of life and is called father. Earth is in charge of nurture and iscalled mother. Man is responsible for putting things in order and is called son.The father presides over the process of education in stages and sections. Guidedby him the mother undertakes the task of nourishing. Receiving life from thefather and nourishment from the mother, the son exists. Being the son, he mustwith due respect serve his father and love his mother.Why is this so?Well, a father educates in stages and sections. Thus heaven relies on the fourseasons to let all that lives grow until it is mature. End and beginning havetheir own specific time. An evil man who acts against this order is like a sonwho disobeys his father, or qi of heaven that forgets what it was asked to do.He doesn’t find favor with heaven. Since heaven detests him so much, it createscalamities to make the son ill. This is the same as in a family where the fatherrules over his son in anger. Disturbing things happen: father and son disagreeand, filled with hatred, a son disobeys the precepts issued by a severe father.So Yin rises over Yang and inferiors betray their superiors. Rebellious sonsstep forth in large numbers, officials neglect their tasks, demons prosper andmake men ill, treacherous fellows live by the side of the road, and the darkgives cover to unruly elements. The mistake lies in opposing heaven and earth.Perfected, you must never disobey! The method of what is as it is resembles ashadow in its response to a body, or a cart when it follows a horse. They cannotbe shaken off.9 [Notes.xhtml#ch20fn9] Heed this!Yes, I will. (61.114) Now that I have learned with great respect what you had tosay about heaven’s teachings and admonitions, I would like to hear how mentransgress earth’s prohibitions.Fine, pay attention.Yes, I will!Heaven is father, earth is mother.Father and mother are both human. So where is the difference?Heaven is also nature (tian 天), and so is earth. Father and mother are distinctby being Yin and being Yang, being male and being female. But what they love andhate is the same. Heaven nourishes man’s life; earth nourishes man’s body. Menmust be very foolish, blind, and benighted not to know how to pay respect tofather and mother. Such men make heaven and earth forever regret that they haveproduced humankind. Both are desperate beyond any hope of relief.Why is this so?What you say is fine.10 [Notes.xhtml#ch20fn10] You thoroughly understand whatheaven and earth want. The period of great disaster is about to end. So men mustbe happy and good.What do you mean? Please explain!Well, nowadays the people of this world all behave like bandits. They causefather and mother grief.How?The four seasons’ celestial qi was put in place by heaven. To oppose it is torob your father.What do you mean?Now human beings consider earth to be their mother from whom they obtain clothesand food. But instead of showing love and care, they raid it.What do you mean?Well, listen! Men are really useless. They bore into the soil and undertake bigconstruction projects without concern for the proper order of things (dao li道理). When they go deep, they reach down to the Yellow Springs, and even whenthey don’t go that far, they still go a number of zhang.11[Notes.xhtml#ch20fn11] The mother is in distress and enraged, but the childrendon’t show respect or piety. Although she is forever bitter, angry,apprehensive, and anxious,12 [Notes.xhtml#ch20fn12] she has no way tocommunicate this in words. In the course of time, the wise men of old had notyet got around to instructing on these matters, so the people actedcarelessly.13 [Notes.xhtml#ch20fn13] They argued that earth did not feel badabout it. But earth could not restrain its bad feelings and involved heavenabove, without men’s knowledge. She resented that the children were not to becontrolled and complained about men to their father. She did this so many times,again and again.14 [Notes.xhtml#ch20fn14] Thus the father’s anger never came toa halt. Natural calamities, disasters, and other anomalies occurred by the tenthousand. The mother became more unhappy (61.115) and too indignant to put anyeffort into feeding the people and the ten thousand plants and beings. Oncefather and mother have both become desolate, the ten thousand beings willperish, as well as the people. The fault lies in their neglect of proper order(dao li).The conduct of latter-born generations is worsening from day to day. Unable tounderstand the intention of heaven and earth, they turn their hatred againstboth and accuse them of not cooperating.15 [Notes.xhtml#ch20fn15] They alsoattack emperors and kings, saying that they are unable to pacify the rebelswithin their realm. People trespass against heaven and earth without being awareof it. Instead, they accuse their superiors of wrongdoing. For this reasonheaven and earth no longer care for man. They view his end as irrelevant.Although a man might scream and moan when he is ill and close to death, as if hewere well aware of his crime, heaven and earth as father and mother won’t rescuehim. His crime is too great. This is what happens to someone who shirksresponsibility for his faults. In later generations, this behavior has gone evenfurther. People have learned from each other until this behavior has become therule and it is now impossible to restrain them. Calamities increase day by daybecause they have no means of restricting each other. Human beings truly causegrief to heaven and earth, their father and mother. When a child harms fatherand mother it is as if a robber were inflicting wounds. It is not a small crime.For this reason heaven and earth severely reprove the unfilial and disobedient,without pardon. Even though a man’s life is short and there are countless waysof dying, he has no reason to be resentful. You understand, don’t you?Yes, I do! (61.116)Now that heaven has sent you to ask these questions I know that I may speak. Butyou must not take it easy. You must pay heed!Yes, I will.Now if someone injures father and mother and opposes their commands, should hecontinue to be supported, in your opinion? This is the reason why heaven doesnot feel much pity.Now the Celestial Master has been kind to this foolish pupil. You have explainedit all to me. But how do we know that heaven and earth are still filled withanger and indignation and blame men for numerous instances of digging up soil?Good. Heaven has sent you to pose such tormenting questions. So you naturallyask this on behalf of heaven and earth.Yes.I deeply fear heaven. I would not dare keep anything hidden, afraid as I am ofcalamities that might hit me. So I will now let you have a clear idea. Keep iteternally written in your breast, so that you will never forget!Now if one family undertakes construction through which soil is dug up, manyfamilies will suffer for it. Some will perish. Or bandits will invade thegovernment precincts. Elsewhere weapons will be raised and fights will occur.Snakes, hornets, tigers, wolves, and other evil animals will injure men. Whenmuch soil is dug up, big disasters will occur; when little soil is dug up, thedisasters will be small. This means that earth in its anger asks spirits andother numinous beings to cause such calamities. This clearly proves how heavenand earth make men ill. Do you understand?Yes, I do! But nowadays some people remain lucky and in good health despitedigging up soil. Why is this so?Good, your question! There are always impediments, but a man who has obtainedgood soil does not suffer right away. Instead, disasters occur in the fourdirections, so that over a period of time they will reach him as well. A man whohas obtained bad soil that can’t tolerate what men do to it will suffer harmright away. Later on, it will spread to distant regions.Why?This is the same as with a good-natured man. Should he suffer a grievance hemight be able to tolerate it for the moment, but he will not forget, and he willinjure [others] on a later occasion. A wicked person, on the other hand, wouldnot be able to bear it but get his revenge right away.Excellent, indeed! Now the earth’s body is huge. Man is quite tiny bycomparison. Thus what he achieves is little and not worth mentioning. How can hebe capable of molesting earth?A good question. Heaven has sent you to sort out all that is unclear.How do you know?Because you take words so seriously. In your heart you are attentive and anxiousabout what you want to say. (61.117) You urgently wish to speak.16[Notes.xhtml#ch20fn16] The spirits and other vital beings of heaven and earththat reside in your belly hasten your words without your being fully aware ofit. In everything men want to do, heaven urges them on.Yes, I would not dare keep anything secret.So listen attentively!Yes, I will.Now you have said that men are too small for their movements to be capable ofinjuring earth. The body of an adult may be one zhang tall and ten spans big.17[Notes.xhtml#ch20fn17] Little insects live in his teeth.18[Notes.xhtml#ch20fn18] Although they are so small that they hardly deservementioning, they afflict a man’s teeth with great pain. When they are thus atwork a man will cry and moan. Teeth will one after the other fall out until theyare all gone. But the size of a man in relation to heaven and earth is the sameas this insect’s size [in relation to] the man it harms. Moreover, teeth aremore solid than metal, stone, or bone, while the insect consists of flesh. Sohow can it injure anybody? The pain man inflicts on earth is the same. Do youknow what I mean?All right.You will soon understand better.Yes, indeed. (61.118)But some men are more than one zhang tall and more than ten spans big. Theinsect that causes ulcers is no bigger than one cun.19 [Notes.xhtml#ch20fn19]Its body is small, so small that it does not deserve mentioning. Should it livein someone’s skin and chisel away day and night, he will fall ill and die. Nowman’s respective size in relation to earth is similar to this insect’s [size inrelation to him].How can these small insects, even in large numbers, attack and kill a humanbeing?Perfected, why do you have to be so foolish and so blind? Almost as much so asthe common people!I am no good!But if you are no good, what do you call the common people?I am at fault, I have been foolish. If the Celestial Master would only raise theissues I don’t fully understand and be kind enough to explain to me what it allmeans.Yes, let us not hide anything. I know that heaven and earth suffer much pain, soI will speak to you again.20 [Notes.xhtml#ch20fn20] All right. I will tell yousomething else. Examine it and you will know better.Yes, I will do so.Now it is not so that a grown man and a strong fellow should not be able to keepinsects that cause scabies under control. They are so small that one can hardlysee them. But about one cup of them can eat up a man. They make him ill so thathe cannot sleep, lying tormented on his bed. Now these scabies causing fleas andother insects are tiny, but when many of them get together they eat up a man.Intestinal worms kill a man.21 [Notes.xhtml#ch20fn21] Scabies causing insectsgive rise to itching, which gives a man so much discomfort that he cannot sitanywhere in peace and will develop sores. Now man’s size in relation to earth isthe same [as the size of these insects in comparison to man’s size]. Do youunderstand?Yes, I do!All right. Now you might perhaps think that what I say is not enough to show thepattern (fa). What I am telling you is that man, small as he is, causes griefand distress to earth’s body. (61.119) He should clearly understand that he iscommitting a severe crime. This is obvious. Now with one hundred households to avillage there would be one hundred wells; with one thousand households to adistrict there would be one thousand wells, ten thousand in one county, onehundred thousand in one commandery, and one million22 [Notes.xhtml#ch20fn22] ina province. A large well has [a diameter of] one zhang, a medium-sized one has[a diameter of] several feet, and a small one [a diameter of] three feet.Now to the world as a whole: how often will men dig up soil to reach the YellowSprings? One house might perhaps have several wells. Let us just take smallwells into account: ten of them will amount to thirty feet, one hundred to threehundred feet, one thousand to three thousand feet, and ten thousand will amountto thirty thousand feet. How many such wells are there all over the world? Allare dug into earth to obtain water, which is earth’s blood in its veins. Now ifsomeone dug up your body to get to your veins, you would be in pain, don’t youthink? Now how many miles do one million wells cover? You can calculate this foryourself. How many million wells does the world have? Thus it is proven that mencause heaven and earth grief. What adds to the mother’s pain is that it is herown children who make her ill. Earth’s qi leaks out. Although such an illnesswould be seen as quite severe in a man, human beings show neither concern norcompassion. Instead, in what they say they forever voice resentment againstheaven and earth as if both were not cooperative. Isn’t this perverse!So far I have only mentioned wells. But nowadays we have large houses and biggrave mounds.23 [Notes.xhtml#ch20fn23] Moreover, we dig up mountains and hillsto get metal and stone. We burn tiles and push columns into the ground. We digout drains and ditches at random. Some of them have been obstructed and broughtto a standstill. How many hold water that can’t keep moving as it should? Forsome the spring must be activated, while for others it must be kept flowing.24[Notes.xhtml#ch20fn24]He also says:25 [Notes.xhtml#ch20fn25] How many springs have been blocked andthen excavated? Springs must be kept flowing. Water must be spread to be of use.All drains in use between heaven and earth will bring downward what is high up.Now this is sometimes not as it should be.26 [Notes.xhtml#ch20fn26]To carelessly dig up earth’s body creates sores. Sometimes obstruction occurs:what should be in motion is not. The king’s reign is inept (bu he 不和) and earthsuffers greatly. No one is willing to address its discomfort, illness, andmisery.27 [Notes.xhtml#ch20fn27] Day after day earth’s vital spirits complain toheaven that [what should be moving] can’t do so. Thus heaven and earth are bothunhappy. This is why it is difficult for the pure qi of great harmony to arrive.You must understand this, Perfected!Yes, I do. (61.120) Now men live between heaven and earth. Don’t they need aroof above their head and a well to drink from? What about that?This is a good question. Now heaven does not begrudge men their homes. But whenthey dig too deep they create sores. Some fetch earth’s bones, others its blood.What do you mean?Springs are earth’s blood, stones are its bones, soil is its flesh. To unearth aspring is to obtain blood. To quarry stone is to break bones. If you dig deepinto good soil and throw tiles, stones, and hard wood inside for enforcement,earth feels pain inside. What makes it worse is that it is not just one persondoing this.So what should we do?Earth is mother of the ten thousand beings. It takes delight in loving andnourishing them. It doesn’t mind their weight, as if it were a human beingpregnant with child. Someone who safeguards dao will not dig up his mother atrandom, and she won’t make him ill. But if a man digs her up as he chooses inhis search for a livelihood, she will make him ill. He must not dig at randomand he must not dig deep, but must live aboveground, content with finding someprotection. Then earth will not make him ill but will greatly love him and makehim happy.I would like to ask how big the protection can be that men might be permitted tohave.Altogether, when removing soil and digging into earth, it should not be morethan three feet.28 [Notes.xhtml#ch20fn28]Why is it the rule to stop within three feet?The first foot is illuminated by Yang; its qi is that of heaven. Plants grow bymeans of the second foot; its qi belongs to the harmonious intercourse betweenYin and Yang. The third foot belongs to the earth itself; its qi is Yin. Whenyou go deeper than this, you injure earth’s body, which would be disastrous.How about the ancients, who lived in caves?29 [Notes.xhtml#ch20fn29]They also violated earth’s body, that’s all. They often made their caves alongmountain valleys, that is, in earth. They also pushed wooden weirs and pilesinto the ground. They gave earth only little pain since there were few of theseand men relied mainly on water that flowed by. Thus illness was rare. Latergenerations did not know the proper limit. They frequently violated earth, andthus they often did not live long.Why was that?There was more illness. (61.121)Nowadays so many men live next to flowing water and don’t dig wells. Why do theyoften suffer from illness and not live long?The anger of heaven and earth extends to all members of a neighborhood group ofshared responsibility. They inherit and transmit evil from one to the other, inthe same way as the faults committed within one family extend to older andyounger brothers.Now some men don’t move earth. When they settle they choose an auspicious timeto move into old lodgings. They are as prone to meet with disaster as they werebefore. Why is this so?Their actions were disadvantageous and antagonized certain spirits.Which spirits?Not just one. It is impossible to tell in advance who it would be.30[Notes.xhtml#ch20fn30] Do you understand?Yes, I do. (61.122)So men live on this earth without taking the trouble to teach each other how tobe good. Thus mistakes are made that bring forth more mistakes. This isgrievous.Now some men live far away from flowing waters. Their life depends on obtainingwater to drink from a well. What should they do?Good, what you have said. But where there are old wells people must beencouraged to continue to drink together from where they have always drunk.31[Notes.xhtml#ch20fn31] They must be careful not to initiate frequent changes.With each change they will have to fill up the old well and block earth’s qi sothat it does not come forth. If you drink from earth’s body it will become weakand unable to nourish plants. When you fill up an old well you must take outwhat is in it to enforce it.What do you mean?I mean the tiles, stones, and timber that are put into the well, where theydidn’t belong in the first place. But there they are. Similarly, a man wouldbecome ill if there was something foreign in his body.How frightening! I would never have known this had you not looked at thequestion in such detail!Step forward, Perfected!32 [Notes.xhtml#ch20fn32]Yes [, here I am].Why do you always ask questions in such detail?33 [Notes.xhtml#ch20fn33]Through these details I will see things as you do. It is being said that humanlife depends on heaven and earth. When they remain happy the order of thingsachieves great peace. Longevity is the consequence.34 [Notes.xhtml#ch20fn34]This is the reason why, living between heaven and earth, I am always in fear35[Notes.xhtml#ch20fn35] of making them both angry. That is why I work hard.Should heaven and earth not be in harmony I will not be able to finish the yearsthat have been allotted to me.You have said the right thing.I am forever fearful because I see so much poisonous qi accumulate in heaven andon earth. Violence and murder continue. Emperors and kings suffer bitterly,their government not at peace. I always want to support them in their troubles.Why are you prepared to help them?I have heard that merit earned among men will be acknowledged by heaven. So I amalways happy to fulfill heaven’s wishes.You have the right intention!Since the Celestial Master is showing heaven’s prohibitions to this foolishpupil, I would like to be permitted to ask another question. Now some peoplebuild houses on ground that is below rivers and the sea. They will possiblyobtain water without piles and weirs before they remove three feet ofsoil.36[Notes.xhtml#ch20fn36] What about this?This is a good question. They are also causing some injury. They must not gothat deep. They are where the earth’s skin is thin. (61.123) They have moved tooclose to its veins. Take, for example, a man with thick skin. It is difficult toget at his blood, but when blood does come forth he is wounded. It might be easyto obtain blood from a thin-skinned person, but when it comes forth he, too, iswounded. In both cases, there is injury. This proves the importance of blood forheaven and earth. It is clearly a crime to make blood come forth, regardless ofwhether the person who is wounded is thick-skinned or thin-skinned, but manresembles heaven and earth in his dislike of being wounded. Should you woundsomeone, he will detest you. Should earth alone wish to receive wounds? Butheaven and earth are man’s true root, they are father and mother of Yin andYang. Why must a child injure its father and mother? Do take this to heart.Foolish men might perhaps from carelessness take things easy, not being aware ofthe great crime they are involved in.Now a child must get food and drink from its mother. So why are humans so muchto blame when they dig a well to drink?What you say goes clearly against heaven’s intentions. Now man turns to wherehis mother puts forth a spring in order to drink. Human beings are thereforenursed where a human spring bursts forth. The place where a child is nursedresembles the spring of water that earth provides men to drink. So why must wedig up its skin and drink its blood without reason? Your question does not makeany sense. (61.124)I am at fault! I have offended against your prohibitions!Don’t be too modest! If your questions did not go as far as they do we would notbe able to learn dao’s complete lesson. I have nothing against what you say.Majestic heaven must be quite anxious to have sent you to ask question afterquestion.37 [Notes.xhtml#ch20fn37] This is the reason why your questionscontinue to go this way and that way.If the Celestial Master would only forgive me and pardon my faults. I am afoolish pupil who can’t refrain from talking.It’s all right. Why are you so modest? You have already labored in the interestof heaven and earth by coming from afar to ask questions.38[Notes.xhtml#ch20fn38] Make sure not to keep my writings secret.Yes, I will.Should men in general fail to look at them they will not of themselves realizethe severity of their crime. Instead, they will simply continue to offend heavenand earth.Why don’t they understand?39 [Notes.xhtml#ch20fn39] Why is government completelyevil and without peace?40 [Notes.xhtml#ch20fn40]They don’t realize that when generations of men trespass against heaven andearth this is inherited and passed on from one to the next. Since thelatter-born are met with such calamities, they don’t complete their natural lifespan.41 [Notes.xhtml#ch20fn41] Life and death don’t come at the set time. Workhard! Don’t dismiss these writings, or heaven and earth will oppose and detestmen even more.Yes!Should you be found guilty of this offense a disaster will occur.Yes!Give the writings to a virtuous lord, who should show them to everyone! Men arechildren of heaven and earth and hold the rank of elders among the ten thousandbeings. These are my instructions for you.What should we do?Each of you must deeply think about this. From now on, if you wish to enjoywealth and longevity and remain free from illness, you must ponder what thesewritings say. Inscribe them into your heart. You must make this a personalproject. Don’t keep them secret. Share them with others and make them known. Nowspirits of heaven and earth follow the path of these writings and keep an eye onthe person [who is handling them].What are you saying?Are you aware of this?Now how does one know that these spirits keep a watch over a man’s conduct?You don’t trust my words! Just try to hide these writings and you will fall ill.Should you dare to prevent their distribution you will be out of luck.42[Notes.xhtml#ch20fn42] This clearly proves that the spirits of heaven and earthkeep men under observation. Pay heed!Yes, I will.You may go. Take courage.Human life lies with heaven and earth. If you want to be safe, you must firstmake heaven and earth safe. Only then will you be able to enjoy long-lastingstability.43 [Notes.xhtml#ch20fn43] But if instead you annoy heaven and earth,violate and injure father and mother, how can you be safe and in luck? Sincewhat happened earlier and what happens later come together, natural disastersoccur without interruption. I am not mistaken. I am always seeing earth’sspirits go up [to heaven] to demand justice. There is no end to this. That iswhy I truly know of earth’s distress.44 [Notes.xhtml#ch20fn44] (61.125) When Inow see how you persist in raising questions, I know that you have been sent byheaven to do it. The reason is that heaven wishes to bring these matters tolight and to let men know for themselves. The hundred families know how toaccuse heaven but they don’t understand the need to accuse themselves.Now why would heaven all of a sudden send me to ask questions?The reason you were sent is that qi of great peace of heaven’s highest majestyis about to arrive, so government must be in great peace. I am afraid thatfoolish people endlessly violate prohibitions set up by heaven and earth andthus bring disorder to upright qi and cause disaster and harm. This being thecase, qi of great peace will not arrive at the proper time. That is why you weresent to ask questions. [Heaven] does not want the people to go on with theirviolations, for if they don’t, then heaven and earth won’t cause illness butwill instead love man and let the five grains and ten thousand plants grow wellto provide him with food. Should man ignore this, heaven and earth will becomeangry, withdraw their love, and refuse to feed him. So if heaven and earth makethe year disastrous nothing will grow well, and if they make it prosper,harvests will be good. This is what it means. Do you understand?Excellent! In the past great peace was general. Why weren’t the people forbiddento move soil?A good question. In the beginning, heaven and earth were not in the position inwhich they are today.How can this be explained?Nowadays heaven makes all the appointments. It selects the man who bends qi, thespiritlike man, the perfected, the transcendent, the man of dao, the wise man,and the worthy.45 [Notes.xhtml#ch20fn45] They must all step forward to supportthe virtuous ruler’s government. This was not the case in the past. Heaven’ssubjects46 [Notes.xhtml#ch20fn46] have never been chosen for office since thedivision between Yin and Yang. So this is really something great.How very alarming!So it all amounts to the first lesson (dao), [which says] that we must teach theworld ‘s people models of moral behavior. When men are good, their governmentwill be stable, and the king who reigns over them will roam about withoutworries.47 [Notes.xhtml#ch20fn47]Excellent! What a great joy!That is why I instruct you to quickly publish this book. Take care not to keepanything hidden! Show it to everyone! Once the hundred families see theprohibitions, they will practice restraint. Otherwise, misfortune will befalllater generations with no further chance of redemption. Prayers don’t help whenit is a case of crimes against heaven and earth.48 [Notes.xhtml#ch20fn48] Do youunderstand this?Yes, I do.You may go. Should you have questions about these writings, come and ask.Yes, I will.49 [Notes.xhtml#ch20fn49]"},{"pageContent":"SECTION 62DAO IS PRICELESS AND OVERCOMES YI AND DI BARBARIANSThe Celestial Master’s doctrine leads to the political pacification of humankindand is thus immeasurably valuable. It is certainly worth more than beautifulwomen and heaps of gold. This is the answer to one of the more banal of thedisciple’s questions.1 [Notes.xhtml#ch21fn1]This pacification is to be achieved in a traditional manner: A ruler ispresented with the Master’s writings, studies them, and does what they say, thenworthy men come to offer their support and make all the people content. As aresult, natural disasters cease and the ruler’s position is secured.Most of this section is written in a lively and unusually coherent style. Ashort and rather puzzling dialogue deals with a new aspect of the topic “theMaster’s doctrine” toward the end. Its message is somewhat surprising, as itdemands secrecy, as opposed to the Celestial Master’s almost constantencouragement to propagate his teachings. It makes sense to include this messagein section 62, in that the demand not to spread it indiscriminately enhances thevalue of what the Master says. Section 62 as a whole includes a number ofstatements that can be seen as hinting at concrete events: the fight betweenfactions, the private assembling of learned men, the awareness of imminentcyclical change and, perhaps in conclusion, the need to be selective in choosingthe audience for propagating the taiping program. The Master demands thatdisciples share his message only with men of influence and not withinconsequential “small men,” who cannot be trusted with the implementation ofgreat peace. All of these demands enhance the scripture’s value for those whoreceive it. There is an aura of secrecy and elitism that does not oftenaccompany layer A dialogues.The section’s message adheres closely to the Master’s central teachings. Tosucceed, the argument goes, the timing of the reform process must strictlyconform to the turning of a cosmic cycle. Only reforms implemented at the righttime can succeed.• • •(62.126) Celestial Master, you are about to go away. No time has been set foryour return. I would like to be permitted to ask another few questions.2[Notes.xhtml#ch21fn2]Go ahead! Speak up quickly. There are still a few days before my departure. Whatdo you wish to ask?I would like to ask something about the writings on dao (dao shu)3[Notes.xhtml#ch21fn3] that you have previously given to me. I want to putforward something that is immodest and should not be said. But if I don’t asknow, I will never find out.Go ahead! Don’t be shy!If the illustrious teacher would only instruct this foolish pupil!Yes, I will.Now then, what is the worth of the writings that I have received from you overthe course of time?Oh, your foolishness is indeed enormous. You are saying that my teachings (dao)have a price?Yes, I am.All I have explained to you in order to enlighten you and give you a profoundknowledge of the way of heaven—how much does it weigh? What is it worth? If Iwere to bestow on you instead one thousand pounds of gold to give to a country,would this better enable you to make heaven and earth happy, harmonize Yin andYang, let calamities cease, let rulers, emperors, and kings live for a long timeand their government achieve supreme peace? If you were presented with tenthousand pairs of jade discs to give to a country to store them as a treasure,this would be the world’s most precious thing. But would this better enable youto let qi of great harmony reveal itself in the six directions, let portents ofprosperity come forth, and let Yi and Di barbarians retreat ten thousand milesso that they would not cause any harm? The teachings I have given you arecomplete. (62.127) They enable emperors and kings truly to make heaven and earthhappy, all the world’s officials perfectly content, all living beings joyous,and Yi and Di barbarians return to allegiance. Portents of prosperity willappear everywhere, and natural disasters will cease. Ruling houses will prolongtheir reigns; the people will live long lives, taking great care to do good, inline with my writings. Just grasp their main idea and everything will fit, justas if you were applying compasses and carpenter’s square. Without exception, youwill achieve as much as can be achieved.4 [Notes.xhtml#ch21fn4] I speak onbehalf of heaven, I don’t lead you astray. If you were to support a virtuousemperor or king with the patterns that heaven promulgates, you would do awaywith all his worries. Day after day he could freely roam about. This is “howmuch it is worth.” Have you grasped it, foolish as you are?Yes, I have.I will talk to you about another matter. Of all that is good and delightful, themen of this world like nothing better than the right (hao 好) woman. When a manfinds her, they bring forth children together and are both of one heart. Nothingcan match a woman who is truly good and lovely. If you gave ten thousand womento a country, everyone would be delighted and happy. Looking at these women menwould forget their age. But would this really help to make heaven and earthsafe, the ten thousand countries content, the eight distant regions submissive,and the world a place of great peace? My teachings can make heaven up abovesecure in its infinity; they can bring order to earth down below in itsendlessness. Everyone from the eight directions will wish to pledge allegiance.All that is in confusion will be reformed by virtue and find its proper place.“How much is it worth?” You must thoroughly figure out for yourself what thismeans. (62.128)If you would like to return heaven’s many merits and obtain its favor you musturgently make my writings known. Heaven will not be pleased if you wish tosupport it by masses of man-made precious objects, and you will not gain muchfavor with it. If you wish to gain favor, you must think day and night aboutwhat my writings say. As soon as you understand what they say, you will alsoobtain heaven’s favor. “How much would that be worth?”You would not promote as much good government if you gave a country one thousandpieces of gold as you might with one piece of sound advice. Giving a country tenthousand pairs of jade disks won’t match the promotion of two worthy men. Goodadvice, men of worth, and exquisite teachings make it possible for emperors andkings to reign even when they sleep soundly at night and to achieve great peacewhile still enjoying themselves. They can put an end to disasters and otherirregular events and make the world safe. This is achieved by men of worth,sound advice, and exquisite teachings. “How much are they worth?”So in antiquity the wise and the worthy, emperors and kings were never short ofmaterial wealth but always suffered from a shortage of scholars. What distressedthem was that men of worth would not come to them and the people in generalwould not flock to them, but would instead wish to be allied to others, so thatthe numbers [of their own supporters] were dwindling. In this way someone whohas fallen from majestic heaven’s grace must forever suffer severely. But by allmeans find joy in precious man-made objects if you wish to do so; you won’t beable to gain favor with heaven and earth and secure the realm between the fouroceans, though. Let [emperors and kings] assemble enough precious objects ofgold and jade to cover an area of one thousand miles in breadth and width andreach up to heaven—this will not make worthy and wise men, transcendents andscholars come and support their reign.Study my writings carefully and worthy men will come of their own accord tosupport and assist the rule of emperors and kings. One morning they will all ofa sudden come together to help making plans, just as one morning, when merchantsget together, ten thousand goods are piled up high and all provisions are instore: one can go out and look for them. Act in accord with my writings. Heavenand earth will become brighter; the sun, the moon, and the stars will have ahalo5 [Notes.xhtml#ch21fn5] and shine in the eight directions into the vastdistant regions so that the four barbarian peoples will take note of it and willall wish to come and submit themselves. The worthy and the learned will comeforth from their hiding places. Their warfare will come to a complete stop.Without the use of official insignia,6 [Notes.xhtml#ch21fn6] the world will beall right. Men will no longer try to hurt each other, but will together striveto be good and make emperors and kings happy.7 [Notes.xhtml#ch21fn7] My writingscan bring this about. “How much are they worth?” You understand, don’t you?(62.129)So the wise men of old did nothing else but to think deeply of dao and payattention to the balancing of qi.8 [Notes.xhtml#ch21fn8] They did not rely onscholars of their own,9 [Notes.xhtml#ch21fn9] but instead attached themselves toa man of virtue. Such a man would know the intentions of heaven and earth andwould therefore honor dao and think highly of virtue. Because foolish men mademuch of precious man-made objects, heavenly writings were not revealed and theworthy and wise didn’t receive them. This is what it means. Heed this; what Isay does not mislead you. Pay attention to my teachings. Men whose aim it is tohold onto precious objects like jade discs and golden coins will sit up in thedark to protect them, unable to sleep. But these are only precious objects. Howabout the treasures of heaven, secret maps and writings, which make the six endsand eight outlying regions of heaven and earth safe? They have become known tothe world, so you must be even more attentive.Yes, I will.Spirit messengers sent by heaven always sit next to my writings to guard them.Again, be warned!Yes, I will.Spirit messengers sent by the three luminaries are always at hand in all theirbrilliance to look after my writings.Yes, indeed!My writings say what heaven intends and what earth wants. You must againthoroughly and clearly memorize them.Yes, I will!Since you are able to understand what I say, I will again explain to you amatter that is hard to detect.Yes!What leaves the mouth and enters the ear must not be transmitted to everyone.Should an emperor or king obtain [this message], the world would submit to him.Spirits and other numinous beings would support his government. People would ofthemselves become good. They would behave in a balanced manner (jun 均) withoutbeing daily ordered to do so.10 [Notes.xhtml#ch21fn10]Yes! All six of us are foolish and dumb. We can’t help it. What we say is boundto go against the prohibitions. Now11 [Notes.xhtml#ch21fn11] if the Master wouldonly outline dao and virtue on behalf of majestic heaven and thus give emperorsand kings a precious tool that will last for ten thousand times ten thousandgenerations. (62.130) You must make known to us all inside matters12[Notes.xhtml#ch21fn12] without restraint. Truly, once we have humbly receivedcertain awe- inspiring doctrines and secret admonitions, we will not dare letanything leak out.Yes. Now for your sake I have inquired with majestic heaven: it must all be toldand I would indeed not dare hide anything. If it were not permitted to makethings known I would indeed not dare do so on my own account.The rotations of heaven and earth both have their sequence. What is made knownat the right point of a rotation can be achieved forever.13[Notes.xhtml#ch21fn13] Thus countries will remain happy and be in no danger ofruin. That is why you must not attach yourself to a small man, but only to anemperor or a king. Emperors and kings who appear at the right point in thishistorical sequence stay forever attuned to heaven and earth. They are able toachieve this, but a small-minded man is not. So I request that you14[Notes.xhtml#ch21fn14] attach yourself to such a person.15[Notes.xhtml#ch21fn15]"},{"pageContent":"SECTION 63OFFICIALS, SONS, AND DISCIPLES OF OUTSTANDING GOODNESS FIND WAYS FOR THEIR LORD,FATHER, AND MASTER TO BECOME TRANSCENDENTIn promoting taiping morality the Celestial Master does not oppose commonlyaccepted moral norms but rather argues that conformity with them is not enough.Goodness does not result merely from sticking to norms. Instead, it requirestaking initiative, active involvement, and self-denial in the service of others.Considering the great value the Celestial Master places upon life and itsprotection, it is not surprising that a good person is described as someone whomakes others happy and prolongs their lives. However, the TPJ is not a textabout philosophical principles for their own sake, but rather a manual on how tolead a dao-oriented life. So the question of what it means to be good is notraised for man in general but in separate accounts for a subject, a son, and adisciple, in line with the social philosophy of the “five relationships” (wu lun五偷).1 [Notes.xhtml#ch22fn1] The last of these relationships, which is notdictated by birth or social necessity and is commonly equated with therelationship between friends, is here the bond between master and disciple. Inall three roles, a good man takes the other’s mortality into consideration. Topostpone and soften death is considered good by the Celestial Master. Theargument involves a certain degree of fundamentalism, as it excludes allnonbelievers from the realm of moral excellence.The Master demands that taiping adepts feel responsible for the length of theirparents’ lives, thus creating an unusual link between filial piety and thesearch for longevity. The Baopu zi posits a different link between the two. HereGe Hong integrates established ideas based on the ancestral cult with his ownpersonal interest in longevity and argues that the personal search for longevityis in itself an act of filial piety. As he sees it, the Daoist adept is someonewho keeps the body that nature and his parents have given him completely intact.He even improves it through the use of Daoist techniques. Such practicesdemonstrate his piety by enabling his ancestors to partake in the glory of hisachievements. His ancestors are also said to take special delight in the exoticfood their Daoist descendant prefers and in which they may partake throughancestral offerings.2 [Notes.xhtml#ch22fn2] In contrast to this preoccupationwith one ‘s own longevity, the taiping ideas have a more traditional concern—onemight even say a more social concern.The second part of the section is separated from the first by a marked caesura.Straying from the topic at hand, the Celestial Master explains the problems hismissionary movement has been confronted with in the past and, in particular, thelack of a receptive audience. He then sends his disciples away, thus finishingthe session. However, he gives in when confronted with another question andproceeds with a discussion of the availability of immortality tools. He stressesthe resemblance between heaven’s system of rewards and that of the state. Menwith merit will live long. Those without will not, just as a county officeprovides resources only to those men who deserve them. This adds anotherdimension to what has been said in the first part of this section. It nowbecomes clear that only good deeds, as the Master defines them, enable a man topartake in heaven’s benefits and thus really enjoy his life.The last part of the section affirms that nowadays only a few men are worthy oflongevity. The deterioration of the doctrine and of the texts that present it isat fault. The situation outlined for the latter age, which is distant from dao,has all the negative characteristics that were outlined in earlier sections.Texts promote the application of punishment, rulers can’t attract honest andworthy staff, and authentic material and good officials are scarce. At the endof the section the Master returns to the need to publicize and support the newlongevity-oriented behavior patterns that he described at the beginning of thesection.• • •(63.131) Step forward, Perfected. Why are some men, officials and ordinarysubjects alike, so excellent in their goodness? You must think hard to come upwith a reasonable explanation, difficult as this is.Yes, I will, but I am afraid I might say something wrong.Why, so modest!Yes, we may rightfully say that nowadays we must call a country’s officials3[Notes.xhtml#ch22fn3] and ordinary subjects truly good should they always remainattentive and faithful,4 [Notes.xhtml#ch22fn4] never daring to break the king’slaws, from birth to death never committing a serious mistake, and throughouttheir lives never being found guilty of a criminal offense.Oh! The sort of thing you have said looks all right but is in fact wrong. Youhave described what we must call a person of average goodness, but not “thebest.” Well, describe to me also what the conduct of the most filial son shouldbe. Think hard so that you will tell me all.What I have just said did not meet with your approval. I would not dare speakagain.How modest! Just say what you know. Should it not suffice I will help you getthere.Yes! Now in all he does the most filial son will forever safeguard dao. He won’tdare cause father and mother any worries and will always nourish them well, byremaining day and night at their side. From the time he is born, for as long ashe has been aware of himself, he has never committed a mistake serious enough tobe called a crime. Such a person we may call most filial.Oh! The description you have given looks all right but is again wrong. (63.132)We may call the person you have described as of average goodness. He doesn’tmatch the highest level of filial piety.I am not good enough! I am to blame.It doesn’t matter. But when we consider that you might be in a position toinstruct students, your conduct sets a pattern and you must watch all you say.Now if you don’t speak any better than you do, the common people in theirfoolishness, blindness, and ignorance will be really difficult to teach. Thisfoolishness will increase without end until they might consider a man ofexcellent goodness and piety, should they find one, odd. Since you can’t do it,I will explain it to you.Yes!All right. But, difficult as it may be, you must also describe to me the bestdisciple.Now I have already offended you twice. I would not dare speak again.All right. Just concentrate on what you say! To be someone’s disciple and refuseto speak5 [Notes.xhtml#ch22fn5] is indeed a severe offense. But to be inadequatehas been common for as long as the world has been in existence. Speak up!Yes, I will. Now as a disciple one must always, day and night, be obedient andattentive. A disciple must follow the master’s instructions and admonitionswithout forgetting the smallest part of what is said. He must not dare to speakat random or bring disorder into the master’s writings. In going away and comingback, he must never dare worry the master. After a disciple has been instructed,he must not dare be aggressive, negligent, offensive, or wicked.6[Notes.xhtml#ch22fn6] He should strive to be good, in a happy mood, day afterday, have no evil intentions, and never counteract his master’s wishes. We wouldcall such a man the best disciple.Oh! There is some similarity, but it is not the best disciple whom you havedescribed. It just about fits the average one.Really, I am no good. Since you have severely reprimanded me, I have forcedmyself to speak three times. Three times I have not met with the illustriousteacher’s approval. The mistakes I have made are severe. I am afraid I have onceagain committed a crime that cannot be pardoned.Everyone has certain shortcomings. Your intentions are not bad, so there is nocrime. Nowadays the men who live in this world are all foolish and completely inthe dark. Not a single one of them knows what is right. Even you keep talkingabout issues as you do. So what can one expect from ordinary folk and foolishmen? They will never understand. They trust their own foolish opinion, that’swhy.Luckily, the Celestial Master has been overwhelmingly kind and has explainedthings to me. Please go again through the points that I don’t understand. Showmercy and be my enlightened teacher.All right, I will explain it all, for your sake. You must be careful to takenotes.Yes, I will!Yes.7 [Notes.xhtml#ch22fn7] Well, this is the conduct of officials and ordinarysubjects who excel in goodness: Always, day and night, they feel concern fortheir sovereign. They want him to be secure, and in their heart they feel whatpains him. (63.133) They are always pleased to watch how the ruler lays down hisofficial insignia and government occurs on its own. [When this happens] subjectsand officials follow suit and become filial and generous. The men in governmentare happy for the king to sit in meditation and [let his spirit] roam afar. Sucha reign finds favor with heaven high above and agrees with the wishes of earthdown below. In the center, the ten thousand people are contented, so that nonestricken with grief would neglect their duty. Creeping insects and other beingschange form as is proper for their kind. Therefore nobody dies from epidemics,and all the ten thousand beings are in their right place. With heaven and earthin harmony, the three qi8 [Notes.xhtml#ch22fn8] delight in each other. Thus theruler’s long life is further prolonged. Moreover, the hundred families keepsearching for special recipes and rare ways of treatment9 [Notes.xhtml#ch22fn9]for their emperors and kings. [They make public] writings that they had lockedup and hidden away until all is out in the open. The world responds. Full ofsurprise, everyone says, “How splendid. It has never been like this!” No one,old or young, will ever again know how to do evil. They submit their special andrare recipes to emperors and kings, who are thus able to live [even] longer.Everyone is concerned about the lord growing old. But since his reign findsfavor with heaven, heaven and earth might send spirits to bring medicine andannounce to their son to take it: such a person’s health won’t deteriorate untilthe end of his life. This is what an “official” or an “ordinary subject ofexcellent goodness” can achieve. You understand, don’t you?Yes, I do! (63.134)So we may say that this is clear to you.This is how the majestic emperor’s best officials and best subjects conductedthemselves in early antiquity. How were they able to find out about it and toachieve such rectitude?Through these teachings (dao). My teachings are indeed like the first-rankingtexts of early antiquity. Ponder their meaning deeply and you will understandheaven’s wishes. With due respect have I received [these teachings] from theheart of heaven to pass them on to a virtuous lord so that he might cut offcalamities and put an end to all harmful influences. I fear heaven’s severity.How would I dare not put forth all there is? But it is still angry.10[Notes.xhtml#ch22fn10] So I let you have these writings. Give them11[Notes.xhtml#ch22fn11] quickly to a lord of supreme virtue and his reign willresemble heaven. How should it differ from heaven?Excellent, indeed! Now I have learned from what you say that qi of peace (ping),which goes back to heaven’s great peace, has truly arrived.12[Notes.xhtml#ch22fn12] The text that has brought this about has been madepublic. This is splendid. What would be left to worry about?Now why should people who have not become disciples be happy when they see whatis good and worry about the evil that they perceive?13 [Notes.xhtml#ch22fn13]For the following reason: Upon the arrival of good qi, evil qi goes into hiding,which makes us forever safe and free from illness and injury. But when evil qiarrives, good qi goes into hiding so that we fear calamities and don’t daremove. This is what the world is like. So we are happy when we see what isgood.14 [Notes.xhtml#ch22fn14]What you have said is right!The Celestial Master is kind! You have already explained to me the model of anofficial and an ordinary subject of supreme goodness. Would you please also talkto me about the conduct15 [Notes.xhtml#ch22fn15] of the most filial son?What a good question! Well, a son of excellent filial piety always keeps in mindthat his parents are getting older and will pass away. If he lives on his own,he thinks of them whenever he has leisure. He is always most eager16[Notes.xhtml#ch22fn16] to find methods that keep death at bay. If possible, helives with his parents. His life consists of nothing but contempt for materialwealth on the one hand and reverence for dao on the other. He entertains hisparents by singing melancholic songs to the lute, making them relax and helpingthem enter dao. He enjoys staying with them until the end, while making themforget that they are old. He is always in search of special recipes in all theremote places. His sincerity has such an impact on heaven that he succeeds evenafter he has exhausted his strength. He has no more clothes, food, or propertythan what he needs. He does not lay aside rare treasures for future generations,but he protects his father and mother from any grievances that they mightsuffer.17 [Notes.xhtml#ch22fn17] Should one of them die, the [son’s] hun spiritis unhappy and suffers distress. He maintains himself but does not search forhappiness. That is to say, he tries hard to look after his own person18[Notes.xhtml#ch22fn18] only for the sake of those below the ground. He must not,thinking of one of his parents, cause harm to himself. (63.135) Now this is whatwe call the conduct of most filial sons of highest majesty19[Notes.xhtml#ch22fn19] in early antiquity. When such goodness becomes known tothe four directions, everyone far and wide will, before long, rejoice and thinkof doing likewise, intent on copying [such conduct]. This gives emperors andkings friendly and filial officials.Now a filial son is concerned about father and mother. In the same way, a goodofficial worries about his ruler. But what you have just described amounts onlyto average conduct, in that someone keeps his own person intact. How could thisbenefit ruler, father, and teacher? And yet you call this person a man ofexcellent morality! He deserves only the name of someone who looks after his ownprofit. If even you deem this to be “good,” how about the common people? Someoneappearing to be attentive and faithful, who does not offend against the king’slaws and has no criminal record, will immediately and passionately declarehimself to be a person who doesn’t turn his back on heaven and never fails lord,father, and teacher. If your conduct were just good enough to safeguard your ownperson, you would be a great fool to invoke heaven and earth to insist that youhave achieved merit. We could never consider you to be a person of outstandinggoodness.Now this is what I have explained to you in detail. I want you to give it inwritten form to a lord who is of supreme virtue. With this in hand, he will veryearnestly advise the worthy men in his service. All of a sudden, they willunderstand and know for themselves the difference between right and wrong.Wouldn’t this indeed benefit lord, father, and teacher?Men have become more foolish since earliest and middle antiquity. They havebecome wealthier each day through corrupt practices although they haveproclaimed that they have performed meritorious deeds on behalf of heaven,earth, lord, father, and teacher. Such men are obstinate and unreasonable. Yousee this, don’t you?Yes, I do! (63.136)So we may assume that you have understood. Nowadays, good conduct is reallydifficult. Take care. You must try hard to understand what my text says. Thenyou will put an end to the great illness that has gripped heaven and earth. Thiswill allow emperors and kings to let their spirits roam about, untroubled and attheir leisure. So the whole world, including plants and trees, will rejoice.Otherwise, you will never be able to match what is expected of a person ofexcellent goodness, but only deserve the name of a person who looks afterhimself.But why should anyone dismiss heaven and earth?People take delight in looking after their own person. This holds true even morefor the small-minded (xiao ren). Are you aware of this?Yes, I am!So we may say that you know. Take care!Yes, I will! Now you have been very kind to this foolish, lowly, unreasonablepupil! I would also like to hear something about the conduct of a disciple ofoutstanding goodness. Well, after he has learned about dao and its virtue, sucha student will bear the master’s generosity in mind. When he has grown up andlocal leaders and worthy men seek his company, he will not forget theneighborhood group he belongs to. Perhaps he might obtain an official positionand will then show his gratitude to father and mother. Or he might enter deepinto dao and understand the art of nourishing his own person. Men receive lifefrom their father and mother, become accomplished in dao and virtue with thehelp of a teacher, and obtain glory and honor from a lord. Each man in his ownrealm of life must keep in mind that once lord, father, and teacher have grownold there will be no chance to repay them. Always think of them and it will beall right. If you find special recipes and rare texts, you thank the teacher forwhat he has done for you. But simply to remember them will soothe the pain inyour heart. If special [ways of treatment] and rare [texts] cannot be found, itis all right to simply think of [your teacher]. However, if you have a worthy20[Notes.xhtml#ch22fn20] for your teacher, obtain a commission for him, speak onhis behalf, and perhaps you can help him become a country’s trusted advisor.Being in such a top position, he would benefit the reign of emperors and kingsfor a long time. All this is what a disciple of supreme morality in earliestantiquity would have done. When his influence extends to latter-born generationsand to an enlightened ruler, together with a ruler’s worthy officials, we callhim a man of excellent morality.21 [Notes.xhtml#ch22fn21]Now we might say that a disciple as attentive and faithful as you, Perfected, iseasy to teach, but such a one who did not understand his master’s intentionswould only be what we would call an obedient disciple, who labors towardperfecting his own person. How would this benefit his superiors? How could hecall himself a good disciple? Since even you talk like this, it is no wonderthat certain common fools continue to claim that they have done something fortheir teacher. But to be an official, a disciple, or a son and not to follow theinstructions of lord, father, and teacher amounts to the crime of greatcontrariness.22 [Notes.xhtml#ch22fn22] It cannot be called anything else.(63.137) The good son, good official, and good disciple that you describedoesn’t commit a criminal offense, but that’s all. How foolish! How can you callthis “being good”?This is [exactly] why common men are so foolish, as has been obvious for quitesome time. We really know that it is true when we go by what you have just said:they have lost the right way, they are getting involved in corrupt practices,and they have long been in confusion and doubt. That is why heaven, which aloneknows all this, is angry and displeased. So calamities are increasing and areinherited and passed on from one generation to the next. All that men who behaveas you have described achieve is to safeguard their own person and not commit anoffense. Their great folly is even greater when they claim to have performedmeritorious deeds on behalf of heaven, earth, and other human beings. You mustheed this! What you say does not yet fully agree with heaven’s intentions. Butwhen I ask you to speak, this is not aimed at you. I wish to see the right andwrong of the common people and what they would consider a great crime. Byencouraging you to speak, I have seen that what they deem to be crooked and whatthey deem straight is not so.23 [Notes.xhtml#ch22fn23] You really understand,don’t you?Yes, I do.All right, it’s clear to you. (63.138) I had originally thought I would talk toyou only until I had made you understand. I could see that you were eager andgetting better each day. Therefore, I have had serious talks with you. I havetaught you what heaven and earth want, explained to you why emperors and kingssuffer bitterly, why the hundred families are grief-stricken, and how the tenthousand beings and plants have lost their proper order. There is nothing elseto take care of now that I have explained to you the model [set by heaven] andtalked about its meaning. You must simply make the effort to remember it.Yes, I will.I had certain students I could not talk to, so with them I did not study to theend. That is why my teachings (dao) have not yet been made public. Youunderstand, don’t you?24 [Notes.xhtml#ch22fn24]Yes, I do.You may go; you have learned it all!25 [Notes.xhtml#ch22fn25]Well, the Celestial Master has been so kind as to permit us to speak directly,26[Notes.xhtml#ch22fn26] without reserve. The more worthy the lord, the more loyalis his official; the more illustrious the teacher, the less reserved is thedisciple in what he says.That’s right. You are aware of the gist of it. Speak up.Now if we assume that in heaven and on earth there really are methods to becomea transcendent and avoid death and that there are recipes against old age, howcan we find them?Yes, this is a good question. Well, they can be obtained. Up in heaven there areas many drugs for becoming transcendent and avoiding death as there is grain ina large granary. There are as many garments for transcendents as there are balesof cloth in a large government compound.27 [Notes.xhtml#ch22fn27] Abodes fortranscendents are as numerous as the rooms in a county office.28[Notes.xhtml#ch22fn28] Stay forever with great dao and you will be permitted toenter heaven. Someone of great dao may find room in the relay stations reservedfor spirits and other numinous beings, just as a man with moral achievements(dao de 道德) is permitted to stay in the county’s rest house.29[Notes.xhtml#ch22fn29] Up in heaven one does not begrudge human beings thegarments of transcendents or recipes against death but does not give them awaytoo easily. Heaven will not give any recipes against death or the garments of atranscendent to any man who has not gained merit with heaven and earth. It willnot give them to any man who has not managed to cure their big ills, who doesnot let Yin and Yang qi move freely and is of benefit to the three luminaries,the four seasons, the five phases and spirits, and other numinous beings ofheaven and earth. Heaven will offer30 [Notes.xhtml#ch22fn30] such special andrare things only to a man of merit. Should you wish to see some strong proof ofthis, just take a look at the grain in the large granaries or at the bales ofcloth [stored] in government precincts. There are so many pecks in a largegranary, but a man without merit and moral achievement won’t be able to get asingle pint. Should someone trespass he will enter prison, be charged directly,and await sentencing for this crime. This proves it.Nowadays men are truly evil. They don’t fulfill heaven’s intentions. This is whyheaven does not let them have all its powerful medicinal substances. (63.139)Instead, day after day it sends demons, spirits, and other vital beings toinvestigate and flog men who misbehave.31 [Notes.xhtml#ch22fn31] That is whythere is no end to illness and death occurs in many forms. For the same reason,county offices quell disorder by filling prisons with criminals, many of whomdie a violent death. This is what it means. A man who performs meritorious deedson behalf of emperors and kings has many palaces; he can always avail himself ofofficial grain and bales of cloth for his clothes and food.Heaven32 [Notes.xhtml#ch22fn32] demands that emperors and kings always attemptto govern in unison with good men (shan ren 善人). Why would it begrudge its love?It’s the ruler’s task to [join forces] with all worthy and learned men and bringpeace to the world (ping zhi 平治).33 [Notes.xhtml#ch22fn33] But a lord withoutworthy officials, a father without filial sons, or a teacher without obedientand capable students is more grieved than can be put into words. This is why theThree Majestic Rulers of early antiquity laid down their official insignia andremained free from business and without worries. [Therefore,] their officialswere attentive and honest. They cared for their lord, soothed his eternalsorrow, and ventured to help him bring peace to the world. They also searchedheaven on his behalf for methods to become transcendent and offered them to thelord so that he might live a long time. Some men earned great merit. The mostmeritorious became transcendents and went away to administer the affairs ofheaven. Thus heaven provided them with clothes and food. There is clear prooffor this; I don’t tell lies.Since middle antiquity, men have often intercepted the true teachings (dao) outof jealousy. Moreover, they have deceived each other with mistaken doctrines(dao) and made fools of other people. In consequence, worthy men are rare, sothat both lord and officials suffer bitterly, don’t manage to bring peace to theworld, and often don’t live long. This is not only caused by the mistakes menhave made in late antiquity. It reaches back. You know that it involves certaingreat faults, don’t you?Yes, I do.Now there are so many rare recipes and so many garments for transcendents inheaven that they cannot be counted by hundreds of thousands, yet a man withoutgreat merit won’t get any. In the same way, there are the county office’s rooms,money, grain, and cloth in the realms of men. If someone always holds onto greatdao, his family will never be obscure, but a person without merit and virtuecan’t get one peck of grain, one single coin, or one inch of cloth. This provesit.Since there have been fewer and fewer true teachings (dao) since early andmiddle antiquity, the true method for living long and becoming transcendent canno longer be found. So someone who just happens34 [Notes.xhtml#ch22fn34] to livea long time truly becomes this world’s most long-lived man.Why is this so?If true teachings and true virtue were ample there would be lots of upright qi.In consequence, few men would suffer from illness and many would live longlives. [But] when wicked and fraudulent writings abound there is much wrong andevil qi. (63.140) For this reason men often fall ill and don’t live long lives.This [follows] the model of heaven as it is (tian ziran zhi fa).35[Notes.xhtml#ch22fn35] Therefore in antiquity many lords lived a long timebecause the officials [who served] the Three Majestic Rulers often adhered tothe true doctrine (dao). The Five Emperors did not live quite as long becausetheir officials only followed the true doctrine sometimes. Officials [inservice] of the Three Kings knew still less about it, and so the kings did notfare as well as the Five Emperors. It was unfortunate for the Five Hegemons36[Notes.xhtml#ch22fn36] that their officials presented them with cleverly37[Notes.xhtml#ch22fn37] faked writings, which did not contain a single truesentence. Thus many of them died young, which is a clear proof. The few of themwho lived long lives were indeed the world’s longest living. You must cherishthis knowledge!I do!So when wise and worthy men wish to predict the future they look at what isauspicious and what is ill-omened in the portents that they have received. Thenthey know for themselves where security and risk are, where advantage and wheredanger. Whoever receives prophetic texts of excellent quality rules in the bestpossible way. Anyone who received texts of medium quality would resemble anaverage man. But to get some of inferior quality points to a lowly man.What do you mean?In regard to receiving texts, the Three Majestic Rulers had the best texts, theFive Emperors average ones, and those of the Three Kings were below average.Whoever gets the texts [which were in use under] the Five Hegemons has the mostinferior ones.How do you recognize these texts?A good question! Texts that teach how government happens on its own without [theuse of] punishment are best. Those that set forth advice and commandments thatare respected and that instill some fear are of medium value. Texts that teachhow to govern through moderate punishment come next. All texts that teach a lotabout deceptive skills and how to make lies look true, how to forget aboutprecedents (fa 法), how to handle memorials in a frivolous and superficialmanner, and how to rule through a violent use of the penal code are quitewicked. Not to adhere to the true teachings results in the way [things were runby] the Hegemons. The wise and worthy of antiquity were able to observe heaven’sinstructions, so they knew for themselves the difference between magnificent andinferior.Should [heaven] want to instruct, whom would it send to assist a king?38[Notes.xhtml#ch22fn38]For this purpose heaven might perhaps bring forth worthy officials to support a[king’s] reign, in the same way as a family that is moving upward is bound tohave worthy sons; Yellow River and Luo might for this purpose issue auspicioustexts and maps to bring about a contract.39 [Notes.xhtml#ch22fn39] This is howit is. Do you understand?Yes, I do!So we may assume that you have gained more insight. When a family is on theverge of perishing, its young men are violent and bad. When a ruler is about tofall, heaven doesn’t send worthy and honest men in his support. When a family40[Notes.xhtml#ch22fn40] is about to die out, sons and grandsons refuse to stickto the true and upright dao and virtue. Instead, they take an interest in whatis artful, deceptive, frivolous, and superficial and set up evil and vilemodels. (63.141) This makes a family unlucky and rebellious. It would prosper,if [its members] were to search for true teachings and true virtue, rare texts,and special recipes and thus save themselves. For a ruler to prosper, heavenmust give him true texts, true teachings, and true virtue. Good men would reignin unison with him, Yellow River and Luo would from time to time send theiradvice, natural calamities and other harmful events would decrease whileauspicious portents would increase, and [heaven] would respond more and morefavorably. This proves it.Excellent, indeed!You may go now. You must work hard. You must perform meritorious deeds on behalfof heaven; you must help the virtuous lord to gain insight.What do you mean by that?You wish to gain a lot of merit in your service of heaven. But you are atpresent in the position of having left the world behind.41[Notes.xhtml#ch22fn41] You can’t gain credit through your conduct of governmentaffairs. How will you do deeds for heaven?So what should I do?You must convey writings to a virtuous lord. Being heaven’s son, he must beguided by its wishes. If he were to rule accordingly, he would repay heaven forits great deeds and make the world safe and his own person prosperous. Then youwould also become happy and secure a long life for yourself.Fine. Yes, I will do so.You may go now. We have finished discussing the three types of behavior. Pointthem out to worthy officials and also to the common people, and latergenerations will do well. This is what you must do.I hardly dare to accept this task.But to do nothing else but look after your own profit and then to say that youare doing good deeds is to dismiss heaven, lord, father, and teacher.We could say that the type of behavior you have talked about extends fromconduct slightly above average to great foolishness that involves more evilfeelings and wicked acts than can be named. Distribute these writings and eachperson [who lives now], in the age of late antiquity, can truly conceive whichactions are of benefit to heaven, lord, father, and teacher. Certainly not thetype of behavior that is of profit only to oneself!42 [Notes.xhtml#ch22fn42]Heaven knows what man’s heart is like!43 [Notes.xhtml#ch22fn43] This is why somany people fall ill.Fine. I can now see what heaven’s intentions are. Your words have beenenlightening.We may say that you learn easily. Nowadays, a number of very foolish men trusttheir own foolish hearts and not what they are told by others. This is theirmistake. It destroys heaven’s way and makes emperors and kings suffer bitterly.It all begins with certain ignorant scholars who are envious of true dao andexcellent virtue and say that these two are not good enough. Instead, they trustin ways of thinking that neglect benevolence. Since heaven suffers bitterly, ithas sent me to publish these texts so that a virtuous ruler can achieve his aim,(63.142) [that is,] safeguard his own person and bring peace to his reign. It isprecisely for this reason that the highest majestic lords of early antiquityobtained favor with heaven and shared its opulence. Do you know what I mean?Yes, I do.All right. Now that you have understood you may go. Think about it.Yes, I will. I would like to ask one more question.Go ahead.Why are the texts in which you outline what we must learn from this modelaltogether as many as there are?This is a good question. We may say that you understand what dao wants. Well,the world’s love for good and for evil is expressed in various degrees andthrough different intentions. Dao, although identical in general, contains manysmall differences. By dividing the whole into 11,520 characters,44[Notes.xhtml#ch22fn44] [we manage] to have heaven’s way presented in smallsections45 [Notes.xhtml#ch22fn45] and the kings’ way in minute detail. But if wewere to speak (dao) about the whole of heaven and earth, up above and downbelow, reaching in the eight directions and to the six extremities, from anoutside and an inside perspective, we would have to say that these writings wereinsufficient. Can you understand this?Yes I can.All right, you know. Give these writings to a lord who follows dao and itsvirtue to make them public. Let the common people think for themselves aboutgain and loss. Thereby you will dissolve the anxiety of heaven and earth,safeguard emperors and kings, and make their reigns peaceful. You are aware ofthis?Yes, I am.You may go. Never forget to stay in control of yourself!No, I won’t.46 [Notes.xhtml#ch22fn46]"},{"pageContent":"SECTION 64HOW TO SUBDUE OTHERS BY MEANS OF DAO AND NOT BY MEANS OF SEVERITYThis section contrasts the effects of moral example with those of physicalviolence and clever stratagems. Violent conduct is seen as wrong for a number ofreasons: the spirits detest it, it resembles the way criminals act, and itcauses cosmic disorder by interrupting the flow of information between heavenand men. However, this is only one aspect of the issue. What must also beconsidered is heaven’s own use of violence when it punishes men by thunder andlightning. A second contrast thus emerges, a contrast between violent action andthe use of force intended to control such action and protect its victims.The arguments put forth in this section are not new. The Celestial Masterrepeats concerns that belong to the main tradition of political thought. Wang Fuexpressed them in the following terms:So heaven installed a ruler not because it was partial to him as a person and tolet him employ the people as his servants, but so that he should punish violentaction, eradicate harmful influences, and be of benefit to the masses.1[Notes.xhtml#ch23fn1]This point, however, is emphasized in a unique way in the TPJ. The Master usesstrong words to accuse the oppressor and the clever manipulator who treatsothers as if they were animals. To intimidate others so that they don’t darespeak up against a perpetrator of violence is to treat them as badly as banditsmight do.This section elaborates upon previous comparisons in the TPJ between rule byvirtuous example and the application of punishment. The use of violence gains anew dimension because the discussion of violent action is not, as is customary,limited to the apparatus of the state and its administration, and the Masterspeaks up in defense of what we could term strong government. Although thisseems to contradict arguments made elsewhere in the TPJ, it can be explained bya difference in perspective. The ideal ruler is expected to use violent meansonly in retaliation, and to protect the people from certain powerful tormentors.Such an expectation suits the situation of the second century C.E., when a weakpolitical center and deficient state apparatus were surrounded by strong andindependent-minded local magnates.• • •(64.142) Step forward, Perfected! Should men in general use severity and deceitto overcome2 [Notes.xhtml#ch23fn2] others? Or is this wrong? Think carefullyabout what you say.Well, why would men go about overcoming others by severity and deceit? So thatthey might become orderly and upright.Oh! Deep inside, your knowledge is just like that of everyone else. We must notyet call you “Perfected of highest rank.” The words you have just utteredresemble what everyone would say. You don’t understand what heaven wants: what aPerfected of highest rank says is identical with what heaven wants. (64.143) Nowdemons and spirits detest a man who overcomes others by severity and deceit, andthey are not the only ones to detest him. Yin and Yang spirits do the same. And,again, Yin and Yang spirits are not the only ones who do. Since the divisionbetween heaven and earth this is what the world has suffered and how it was putto order. When someone subdues others by force, he does not reign over themproperly, so the people he suppresses become resentful. But demons and spiritshelp them, and so do heaven and earth. Since heaven and earth come to help, menmust also rein in those who suppress others, and help to subdue those who subdueothers.3 [Notes.xhtml#ch23fn3]Therefore, when men of outstanding wisdom who served the ancient Three MajesticRulers triumphed, they ruled through perfect dao and virtue. They neveroppressed others with severity and deceit. Should you use such means and alsopunishments you are nothing but a thief, a robber, and a bandit. That is howsuch men oppress others. How could a lord who uses such methods distinguishhimself? Would he look any different? And yet, this is what you said! Wasn’tthis foolish? Do you understand that this is what has caused uproar in heavenand on earth ever since middle antiquity? In early antiquity, a lord of dao andvirtue never used severity and deceit to rule the people. In middle antiquity,laws were promulgated but nobody dared make use of them. In late antiquity, someseverity, deceit, and penalties were implemented to govern the people. This ledto some minor disorder. Certain men of great foolishness promoted the Hegemons’method of government. They created fear among their clients (shizhong 士果)through strict regulations and harsh penalties, so that petty officials and thepopulation at large rose in numerous rebellions.Therefore, rule by dao and everything will be pure and bright; govern by virtueand both advance and retreat will be in measure. Thus, [men’s] advance andretreat have been difficult to control in late antiquity, since deceit hasbecome rampant. Since heaven rules through dao, its shape is pure and the threeluminaries are bright. Since earth rules by virtue, it bears [its load]patiently. (64.144) Since man rules through the harmonious [intercourse betweenYin and Yang], he advances and retreats in frequent alternation and what he saysis versatile and without constancy. Heaven’s order is first, earth’s order is inthe middle, and man’s order is at the bottom.4 [Notes.xhtml#ch23fn4] What is atthe very bottom will move upward.How does one know that one is at the bottom?It means that advance and retreat lack constancy and that exit and entry areexplained differently.5 [Notes.xhtml#ch23fn5] [Man’s order] is the lowest of thethree qi [of heaven, earth, and man]. What has reached its lowest point mustmove upward. Once we reach dao, we will obtain great peace, [which is] just likeheaven. Once we reach virtue, there is an average level of peace, similar toearth. On reaching harmony, a small amount of disorder comes forth, as is thecase with man. Disorder increases once severity, deceit, and punishments are inplace, as it would under the rule of the Hegemons when punishments played a bigrole. What you have just said in your answer about the use of severity anddeceit throws into confusion what heaven means to tell us.Now you have said that one must not use severity and penalties. Why does[heaven] employ the terror of thunder and lightning to keep men in check?6[Notes.xhtml#ch23fn6]That is a good question. You have understood what I want to say. The reason whythunder and lightning keep men in check is that rulers who in their exaltedposition act with evil intent make light of antagonizing others. Man is the mosthonored and important being. Heaven reins in anyone who has human beings eat thesame food as the six domestic animals, and helps men who are oppressed and haveto eat such food. It detests [anyone who acts like this]. So [it holds true for]every man, great and small alike, that anyone who makes light of antagonizingothers comes under [heaven’s] control, which pities and helps the oppressed.So when a lord overcomes others he must do so only by means of dao and itsvirtue. He must not overpower and grieve them in a cruel and offensive manner.Severity and deceit must be employed only to restrain unruly men. One cannotbring men to submission by dao and virtue if they want to act without dao. Suchmen must be subdued in the way mentioned, just as the Duke of Thunder7[Notes.xhtml#ch23fn7] keeps unruly men in check. But this must not be a constantpractice since it offends heaven’s intentions. If someone wants to obtain favorwith heaven and earth, he must proceed through dao and its virtue.That is why the wise and worthy of old esteemed the use of dao and virtue, andwon men over through benevolence and love, and it was not deemed right tooppress others through severity, punishments, and terror. Should someonecontinue8 [Notes.xhtml#ch23fn8] to overawe, intimidate, and subdue others bysuch crooked means, the highest majestic qi of great peace won’t come to supporthis reign. Since this is so the men over whom he rules will not agree with him.9[Notes.xhtml#ch23fn9] Grief stricken, they won’t dare to speak up from fear,just as men whose clothes have been stolen by a robber might not dare to speakup, even though they know the culprit quite well. Instead, they might use finewords and call the robber “general” and “supreme ruler.” Or men might be tooweak to appeal on their own account (64.145) and won’t dare speak up. We mustcall all of this “rupture” and “lack of pervasion.”10 [Notes.xhtml#ch23fn10] Itprevents the celestial qi of Yin and Yang from being in agreement.Heaven is in command of a man who rules over others and sets him the basic taskof keeping the strong under control and supporting the lowly and the weak. Butcertain petty officials are cruel. They intimidate and frighten others withseverity, or scare and terrify them with intrigues and deceit. When qi of peaceis about to arrive and a virtuous lord reigns, it must be feared that upright qimight become perverted by these [wrongdoings]. This is why I inform you. Pass iton to a lord of supreme virtue. Let him inform his worthy advisors and thepeople at large. If petty officials and the whole population were to think forthemselves about how to maintain order, this would benefit those in power. Onemust be careful to avoid disorder. You understand, don’t you?Yes, I do!All right, now that you have understood you may go. You must always watch yourwords. Don’t talk nonsense. Heaven keeps track of men.11 [Notes.xhtml#ch23fn11]No, I won’t!Nobody is perfect. The best thing to do is to ask.Yes, indeed!12 [Notes.xhtml#ch23fn12]"},{"pageContent":"SECTION 65THREEFOLD COOPERATION AND INTERACTIONThis section, repetitive and lengthy as it is, deals with topics that arerelevant to social relations and political hierarchies. The claim that the worldas we know it functions only because everything is made up of three componentsleads the disciple to conclude that the arrival of “the qi of great peace\"(taiping qi) results from the cooperation of three. The existence of threesafeguards the continuity of each single one, or, considered from the oppositeperspective, if one were missing, all three would no longer exist. This line ofargumentation points to the concept of equality. Although the demand for“threefold cooperation” is derived from the structure of the family, its mainapplication is in the realm of politics, where rupture and isolation are said tocause severe harm.The Master stresses the need for cooperation in this section. A rather similarTPJ section praises cooperation between two, which is said to bring forth athird, based upon the observation that things are created by two hands, not justby one. Heaven and earth, the four seasons, the five phases, man and woman,master and disciple, ruler and official—each consist of “both hands”:“Both hands” means to work evenly together, neither moving to the fore norfalling behind. In this way, something can be achieved. Nothing will be achievedunless both hands work together. All activities resemble [the use of] these twohands. Everything must find the right person. When [we] work together with oneidentical aim (tong xin), as both hands do, qi of happiness, stability, andgreat peace will be established. If we don’t, we won’t be able to bring forth qiof majestic great peace in many millions of years. Qi of great peace alwayswants to come forth, just as heaven always wishes to depend on “both hands.”When they never cooperate harmoniously, they lock qi of great peace up so thatit can’t get through. This brings forth unrest and disgust. The fault lies inthe lack of cooperation between both hands.1 [Notes.xhtml#ch24fn1]After he has established the need for cooperation, the Master explains how tobring it about. In doing so, he raises two issues: the submission of memorials,through which communication between the three tiers is maintained, and theallocation of tasks. He elaborates on the latter, arguing that a subordinatemust always be given tasks within his capability. Otherwise, his frustration anddisappointment might cause a major disturbance. Also—and this is outlined ingreat detail—the subordinate’s performance must be continuously assessed, in aformalized manner.It is a commonly pronounced thesis of Chinese political thought that ruler,officials, and the people depend on each other. The Celestial Master acceptsthis thesis, but lays stress on the people. The lower strata’s moral attitudeshave, as he puts it, an impact on the morality of their ruler; when they behavewell, the ruler will react to their behavior, just as the natural environmentdoes. This proposition supports the argument that the Master’s audienceconsisted of people who were outside the official political system, or at itslowest end. Another point is more common but is of some interest, consideringthe place the Master attributes to heaven. He claims that the well-being of thepeople shows that heaven is contented.The Master concludes that “threefold cooperation” is, for the present, the wayheaven’s will can be fulfilled. This was not always the case, as the disciplepoints out. The problem of rupture and lack of mutual understanding did notarise in antiquity because everyone adhered to dao and the unity that isachieved through meditation, thus making superfluous arrangements such as thedivision of beings into entities of three.• • •(65.146) With due respect Chun salutes the Master twice: May I please asksomething? What is it that you would like to know?In the morning I come to study; at night I return home. I always stay where itis quiet to think about what it really means. I wouldn’t dare to be idle. Nowyour writings always mention that qi of highest majestic great peace is about toarrive. What do you mean by “high,” “majestic,” “great,” “peace,” and “qi”?2[Notes.xhtml#ch24fn2]Now you throw everything into question! All of a sudden you wish to inquireabout the meaning of certain subtle words!The reason is this: I want to learn from you everything about these writings,and they often say “highest majestic qi is about to arrive.” I cannot understandwhat this means. If I don’t ask after your secrets—you are heaven’s enlightenedteacher—I am afraid I won’t have another chance of finding out. So how should Idare not ask all I can?What you have said is right and will remain so for ten thousand generations.When heaven’s perfect dao, great virtue, and full benevolence arrive, themajestic numinous3 [Notes.xhtml#ch24fn3] will want men to act quickly. That iswhy heaven’s qi has touched your heart so that you raise questions from morningto night. The model set by heaven is so distinct4 [Notes.xhtml#ch24fn4] that Iam quite perplexed.Yes. Sit quietly and I will explain to you the meaning of these characters sothat it will be transmitted until the end of time. Well, the character shang 上(high) consists of the stroke for “one.”5 [Notes.xhtml#ch24fn5] In the center,there is another “one” in the vertical direction. Moving upward there iscontained yet another “one.” Altogether the character for “high” has threesingle strokes for “one.” It is called “high” because the character reachesupward without being cut short and does not move back downward. (65.147) Thereis nothing above this character. The opposite of “high” is xia 下 (low), whichconsists of the stroke for “one,” with another stroke for “one” in the center,in the vertical direction. Moving downward there is contained another “one.” Wecall this character “low” because it moves downward without any chance to turnupward. The intention is always to move downward, on and on to the deepestpoint, until there is nothing further down below, like mud, for example, whichtends to sink into the ground and become soil. Soil is thus at the very bottom,with nothing beneath it. The character for “high” always moves upward and can’tturn back downward, like clean water, for example, which tends to move upwardand turn into sky (“heaven”), which is highest of all and thus sets the model.Each word has its own character and its own definition. This holds true for allwe undertake, and this is how models promulgated by wise men always reflectheaven’s intentions.To stick to the character “one” (守 一) and aim upward is “to divine” (bu 卜). “Todivine” means to raise a question. If you divine without interruption, all thewhile wishing to move upward, you are on the road to a peak of good fortune.That is why the character “high” has the character bu (to divine) right abovethe stroke for “one,” while “low” has this character beneath the stroke for“one.” “To divine” is “to question.” If you are always intent on raisingquestions, you move downward until you cannot go any further down. So if youmove too far in aiming downward you will not manage to turn upward again. Thus,“high” [is the character for something that] never has anything above it, andwhen we say that someone’s reign is moving in an upward direction, we mean thatit matches heaven’s will and has nothing above it.Excellent! The illustrious teacher has been kind enough to explain to me thecharacter “high.” I would also like to hear about the character “majestic”(huang 皇).The character “majestic” consists of the elements “one” (yi 一), “sun” (ri 日),and “king” (wang 王).6 [Notes.xhtml#ch24fn6] The “one” [that is] above “sun” isthe sky (tian, “heaven”). Heaven has the figure of one. Obtaining the sun,[something majestic] shines forth in great brightness and is king. Hence, whenwritten down, “one,” “sun,” and “king” make up the character “majestic.” “One”stands for heaven. All three of them—heaven, sun, and king—rule. So three rulersjointly make up the character we call “majestic.” To be majestic means thatsomeone’s spirit has gained brilliance. That is why we call him “majestic.”7[Notes.xhtml#ch24fn7] To be majestic means to be first in the world, withnothing above.8 [Notes.xhtml#ch24fn8] (65.148)Excellent! You have been so kind as to explain the character “majestic.” I wouldlike to hear about the characters “great,” “peace,” and “qi.”“Great” is “big.” It means to achieve big things, as heaven does, which is bigin all respects. Nothing is bigger than heaven. “Peace” means that a reign iscompletely balanced (tai ping jun 太平均) so that all activities are kept in order,without further jealousy and selfishness. “Peace” resembles the way in whichearth remains below us. It is in charge of keeping balance (ping 平). Thishappens in the same way in which a man who sows good seeds reaps well, whilesomeone who sows evil reaps evil. A man who really exerts himself will have agood harvest,9 [Notes.xhtml#ch24fn9] while the harvest of someone who investsonly a little energy will be poor.“Qi” means heaven’s qi enjoys creating life beneath heaven, and earth’s qi likesto nourish what is above earth. It is the model for qi to be active below heavenand above earth. When Yin and Yang get together, they create harmony. When weinclude the harmonious intercourse between these two there are three qi thatnourish all beings and objects. No more damage will occur once these three qilove and pervade each other. “Great” is “big,” “peace” is “upright,” “qi”nurtures by making harmony pervasive. Rule through these three and great peace,harmony, and great uprightness will prevail. Then might we say that qi of greatpeace has arrived.Excellent! This is saying nothing less than that qi of heaven, earth, and theirharmonious intercourse must interact with each other and rule in unison. Am Iright? And that in all activities three must get together?Excellent! What you have said agrees with the model set by heaven. If emperorsand kings were to copy it they would reign as if they were spirits (shen). Well,I will tell you all, and you must, as it suits you, write it all down.Yes, I will.When qi of the primordial, of what is as it is, and of great harmony [betweenYin and Yang] interact with each other, combine their energy, and are of thesame mind they are for a while indistinct and not yet in any shape.10[Notes.xhtml#ch24fn10] When these three qi congeal into form, they bring forthheaven and earth.When heaven, earth, and the harmony between them get together, combine theirstrength, and are of the same mind, they create all objects and beings (fan wu),which then interact with the three luminaries, combine their efforts, and, allthinking alike, illuminate heaven and earth.When the hardness and softness in all objects that is derived from the fivephases interacts with the harmony between them (65.149), they will, combiningtheir efforts and intentions, bring forth the ten thousand plants and beings.11[Notes.xhtml#ch24fn11] When qi of the four seasons, Yin and Yang, and theharmonious intercourse that exists between heaven and earth interact, combinetheir efforts, and are of the same mind, they give rise to the wealth (wuli 物利)of heaven and earth.12 [Notes.xhtml#ch24fn12]When the first, second, and third months of each season interact, combine theirefforts, and are of the same mind, each presents one aspect [of the year]. Whenthe earth’s heights, deep valleys, and plains pervade one another, combine theirefforts, and are of one mind, they nurture the produce of heaven and earth. Whenmale and female reptiles and insects in mutual agreement13[Notes.xhtml#ch24fn13] work together and are of the same mind, they continuetheir species.When man and woman get together, combine their efforts, and are of the samemind, they bring forth children. When three individuals join forces and are ofone mind, they create a family. When lord, official, and the people gettogether, combine their efforts, and are in agreement, they build a country.They all receive life from primordial qi, what is as it is, and heaven andearth. Whenever three parties interact, dao can come about.14[Notes.xhtml#ch24fn14] When three beings in agreement stay with each otherforever, combining their efforts and being of the same mind, they fulfill onejoint task, achieving one common objective.It would be disastrous if one [of the three] were amiss.15[Notes.xhtml#ch24fn15] Yang on its own, without Yin, could not bring forth life,and all order (zhi 治) would break down. The problem would be the same if therewere Yin but not Yang. The species could not be continued if there were Yin andYang but no intercourse (he 和) between them. A breakdown of order wouldcertainly occur. So if there were heaven but not earth, beings and plants wouldhave nothing to grow from. If there were earth but not heaven, they would haveno way to obtain life. If there were heaven and earth one next to the otherwithout having intercourse, beings and plants would not hold onto each other andrear themselves. Thus a male cannot give life on his own, and a female cannotnurture on her own. If male and female cannot bring forth children, how willthey set up a family and be called father and mother? (65.150) So it is heaven’smodel that there must always be three who get together to create something.This is why, in their profound knowledge of the conditions of heaven (tian qing天情), the wise men of the past reigned in close resemblance to heaven[’s order].Thus the lord was father, like heaven, the official was mother, like earth, andthe people were children, as if they were the harmonious intercourse [betweenfather and mother]. Heaven commands all beings in their confusion to interact asgroups of three, combine their energy, and be of the same mind. Then they canachieve one common objective, build one family, and form one body. Heaven makesthem depend on each other. None of the three must be amiss. Should one of thembe grief-stricken and not play its role, all three risk destruction. Thus onlywhen the lord depends on officials, officials depend on the people, the peopledepend on officials, and officials depend on the lord can they achieve theircommon objective.Should one not suffice, all three would remain incomplete. Thus, we would notcall a lord without people and officials “lord.” Officials and people without alord would not really be officials and people. Disorder would occur if they wereto remain without a lord. They would not be able to put [their affairs] in orderand become good officials and good subjects. The three depend on each other totake up their position. Only in relation to each other can they become [whatthey are]. So lord, officials, and people must match the model set by heaven.The three must interact, combine their efforts, and be of one mind. Togetherthey will become like one family, in the same way as husband, wife, and childrenare one family only because they rely on each other. This is heaven’s essentialdao. In this way, a man’s head, feet, and stomach form one body. None of themcan be done away with. Should one be gone, [what was left] would not suffice andwould not make a man. This is the cipher of what is as it is in heaven and onearth.It is for this reason that the wise men of old took heaven as their model andthat a man must find a good wife to conduct his affairs with her. Only then willthere be good children. Man resembles a lord, the wife an official, and thechildren the people. The way in which heaven commands that a country be ruled[for the ruler] is to befriend wise and intelligent officials. Through hergoodness, a wife makes children agreeable. A good official ensures the peoplelive in harmony. Only a good wife gives birth to good children. None but a goodofficial brings about good people. If people and officials both love to do goodthey are able to allow their superiors to rest securely forever.16[Notes.xhtml#ch24fn16] If you want proof of this, [let us consider] heaven aslord and earth as official. Heaven’s rain falls everywhere. When it rains ongood soil it brings forth a good harvest; when it rains on bad soil, harvestsare bad. This is what is meant. But father and mother must hold onto generalrules and guidelines, [just as] lord and official do. The main thing is that forclothes and food they depend on their children. Men without children lackposterity. When a lord has few people, clothes and food will not suffice, whichwill make him suffer bitterly in his heart.17 [Notes.xhtml#ch24fn17] (65.151)Thus the way (dao) of ruling a country is to make people the basis. Withoutpeople, lord and officials can’t conduct affairs and establish order.For this reason, when the great worthy and wise of old were in government, theysaw the people as their most pressing concern, from morning to night. Theythought of the people as in a family a father and mother fret about not havingchildren. Without children, how would they be called father and mother? Howwould someone be called lord if there were no people? So it is heaven’s example(fa) that makes lord, official, and people stay together forever, under onecommand, sharing the same good and bad fortune and fulfilling one task. Therewill be general misfortune if one activity should go wrong (shi zheng 失正). Therules and guidelines of proper government have often been forgotten since middleantiquity. This has created the problem of inheriting [evil] and passing [it]on. So later generations have suffered a great number of widespread disasters,all because lord, officials, and people have forgotten their aim. They didn’tknow how to think thoroughly, care for and cooperate with each other (xiang tong相通), combine their efforts, and be of one mind. Instead, they have made eachother suffer bitterly.Now should the lord remain isolated (yi ren) or even in deep hiding, thegrievances of the four outlying regions18 [Notes.xhtml#ch24fn18] would be cutoff and not become known, and his reign won’t find favor with heaven. Masses ofnatural calamities, disasters, anomalies, and irregular events would come about,impossible to stop, and the ruler would not be able to understand what heavenand earth wish to say. This must be greatly condemned. Since the three don’tcombine their energy, the flow of intelligence is interrupted. Evil qi istangled up and not put in order. Majestic heaven above greatly detests this,earth below greatly condemns it, and it is a big worry for emperors and kings.With numerous disasters and no solution in sight, there is great harm for thepeople and much illness for all beings. Since all this has come together over along time it has not been caused by mistakes made only today in the period oflate antiquity. Do you understand?I understand that this has been going on for a while. But I really don’t knowwhat has caused it. So I ask: where do these grievances truly come from?Well, as soon as qi of heaven’s great peace arrives, government must find favorwith heaven, and then these evils will all disappear on their own. This is whyheaven has sent me to explain it all. It wants me to save [men] from theseerrors and bring forth the standard texts. So it has caused you to come and ask,as you do, where the trouble comes from. We don’t try to resemble the model setby heaven and earth, primordial qi, and what is as it is, and to cooperate witheach other [in groups of] three, combine our efforts, and be of one mind—that iswhy such [trouble] has come about. If three were to interact with each other,combine their efforts, and be of one mind they would achieve peace, greatcontentment, and a state without natural calamities.I would like to know how one should conduct one’s affairs.One must stick to the model set up by heaven, as I have said earlier.19[Notes.xhtml#ch24fn19] Heaven sets the example of combining efforts and being ofthe same mind in all matters. Thus it takes the three luminaries as the pattern(wen 文). By working together, they shine forever without interruption. (65.152)Since the appearance of celestial contracts,20 [Notes.xhtml#ch24fn20] men haveconducted their affairs through writings, just as heaven [does through] thethree luminaries. So from time to time heaven bids the Yellow River and the Luoto bring forth writings. Texts made by men must repeat the orders [thus bestowedby heaven]. Goodness grows and wickedness shrinks as long as men enjoy copyingthe model and measure of heaven’s all-pervading (dongji) spiritlike regiment.21[Notes.xhtml#ch24fn21]With regard to “writings,” all texts that provide information are “threefoldwritings.”22 [Notes.xhtml#ch24fn22] A lord must properly guide his subordinates,give clear orders, issue commandments, and teach each subject to remain in hisplace and submit memorials that mention all the good and all the wicked that hehas heard about. One can send memorials with someone who travels on foot or on amerchant’s cart or even deliver them oneself, clearly stating one’s own familyname and style name (zi 字).23 [Notes.xhtml#ch24fn23] Conducting affairs in thisway brings to light all the world’s good and wicked acts. The lord causesheaven’s qi to reach downward, the official lets qi of earth move upward, andthe people let qi of harmonious intercourse [between heaven and earth] spreadupward. You must transmit writings. Give them to a virtuous lord. Let himexamine and comprehend what I say. This will bring peace and contentment.Disasters and other irregular events will cease. Not a single point is missed.My writings attempt to take heaven as their model; they are not just a senselesselaboration that I have made up. [If this were the case] heaven would slay me.You know well what a severe offense that would be, or don’t you?I do.Anyone who wants to see how reliable my writings are need only practice whatthey say as soon as he has received them and heaven and earth will respond as ifby echo. That is how reliable my text is. With such great and clear proof therecan’t be any doubt: the way (dao) to govern a country is to find favor withheaven and be sure of oneself. Practice proves this right. An echolike responsein heaven is a clear token that heaven talks to men.But I can see that you like helping a virtuous lord and wish to repay heaven forall it has done for you. That is why I have told you a few things. I know howwrong it would be not to tell you all.24 [Notes.xhtml#ch24fn24] Now once a lordhas these writings he will reign through their clear instructions and gooddirectives. We may say that from now on each petty official and ordinary subjectmust fill his place and try hard to submit memorials that report every good andwicked deed, to enlighten the reign of emperors and kings, and to spreadheaven’s qi. It is not permissible to intercept [memorials]. Anyone who does somust on this account spend three years in prison. Anyone who submits memorialsthat are completely reliable and contain no falsehood will, I say, be invited totake office.What will be his office?Each man will be asked where his strength lies and will be employed for a taskhe can accomplish.Why must he be given work that agrees with his talents?It is heaven’s will to employ each man on the basis of his ability. Where thisis not the case, we must say that it gives a man cause for resentment so that qiis tangled up and natural calamities occur. Since this is so a man can’t fulfillhis task. From birth until death he won’t achieve anything. (65.153)Now what the people like best is to obtain good harvests and precious objects.Now suppose an enlightened lord were to let it be known that a man could havegold, silver, and other treasures stored in the empire’s county offices with aclap of his hands: “You will not be accused of a crime; it is all for you.” Sucha man will be very happy to obtain these things. [But] if his strength were notup to it, he will not be able to succeed, even if the objects were tied to hishand, and he would exhaust his energy. Now a lord [is like] father and mother toothers. If he assigns men an official task that is not geared to what they aregood at, he virtually murders them. Not only will they be unable to fulfilltheir commitments in an orderly manner; they will with futile effort bringuproar to the office and make the population at large suffer bitterly. With theoffice in uproar, ordinary subjects and officials alike will call to heaven intheir distress to voice their resentment and will move heaven to send even moredisasters and other anomalies. That is why in their desire to find favor withheaven the wise and worthy of old were doubly careful in filling offices.25[Notes.xhtml#ch24fn25] They always met men’s wishes (ren xin 人心) and thus wereable to fulfill heaven’s wishes (tian xin 天心).26 [Notes.xhtml#ch24fn26]How does one fulfill heaven’s wishes?What you do must agree with the people. The sign of your success is that pettyofficials become better men from day to day, and also more faithful and loyal.You must then promote them at the right time, which helps the country[’s ruler]to be someone who obtains heaven’s favor. But some individuals are inclined totake office one morning because they wish to earn fame. Their conduct does notsignify success; they neither fulfill heaven’s will nor agree [with the people].But emperors and kings who attempt to base their rule on heaven’s will mustfulfill all of it. Not to do so would be wrong. If their reign does not respondwell [to heaven]27 [Notes.xhtml#ch24fn27] and agree [with the people], they mustretire and think about what went wrong. This is enough to make heaven contentand everyone in the world loyal and faithful and let them exert their skills andtheir strengths. Even in dark, hidden, and faraway places men will hear about itand will no longer hide their skills. They will submit memorials eagerly: humanlife is of greatest importance; not a minute must be lost. As long as men bemoangrievances, [qi]is tangled up into ever more anomalies and disasters.28[Notes.xhtml#ch24fn28] Rush forth instantly to address this! Problems that areless pressing must wait until autumn and winter.Why wait until autumn and winter?Well, in autumn everything is ready, and in winter it is all stored, as decidedby heaven’s qi. Plants have ripened by the eighth month of mid-autumn, so yieldscan be divided up. Thus according to the model set by heaven and earth one muststart in the eighth month to divide things up and inspect them in detail.29[Notes.xhtml#ch24fn29] In the ninth month, heaven’s qi has come to an end. Bythis month, plants are prepared to die. So in the ninth month our inspectionsare concluded30 [Notes.xhtml#ch24fn30] and we understand good and bad points.Ten is the last figure. When plants reach the tenth month they return to thebeginning. For heaven, the eighth month is [like the last,] the tenth month. Sothis is the time when plants are ready. For earth, the ninth month comes last,for by then everything has turned old. For men, the period of hai [the twelfthearthly branch] is the last month, for by then everything has died. (65.154)Once these three months are over, plants come to life again. Thus qian [thefirst diagram] is situated in the northwest. Plants start from their seeds inhai [the twelfth earthly branch].31 [Notes.xhtml#ch24fn31] According to themodel set by heaven, we divide things up in the eighth month, arrive atconclusions in the ninth, and have these verified in the tenth month. So thethree dispensations of heaven, earth, and man arrive at their end in unison.Verification takes place in the hai [period], so in the tenth month results areverified and transmitted to subordinates. Since this is so, everything inheaven, on earth, and among men is finished and returns to where it came from inthese three months, that is, from the eighth month to the tenth month. Shouldthere be no verification of any sort, [this means that] the aim has not beenreached, and since heaven and earth will not be pleased and content, the naturalcalamities they send will go on and cause damage for years to come. For thisreason one inspects in detail in the eighth month, arrives at conclusions in theninth month and verifies it all and makes it public in the tenth month.32[Notes.xhtml#ch24fn32]If we make petty officials and ordinary subjects think critically of all theydid wrong they won’t dare do it again. In the years to come they will show morerespect and everything will turn out well. If [results] are not passed down andmistakes are not reflected on, ordinary subjects and low-ranking officials willstubbornly ignore directions. Their hearts will not change unless they see forthemselves the mistakes that they have made. Heaven’s dao is stubborn in itshatred for [people who] don’t change.That is why [results] must be passed down. I can prove this to you. [Let usassume that the results] passed down for this year have all been put forth inwriting by [the lord] himself, and that petty officials and ordinary subjectswere instructed to do the same on their own behalf. What shows the amount ofgood and bad [results] is called “celestial contract” (tian quan 天券). The nextyear, the results are again passed down and put on a list to show how much goodand bad there was. Exactly the same thing is done the following year. Whatsubordinates submit and superiors report must, although distant from each other,be in agreement.33 [Notes.xhtml#ch24fn33] This is what we call “Heaven shows itsapproval by matching the tallies.”Once petty officials and ordinary subjects change their minds and become good34[Notes.xhtml#ch24fn34] they find favor with heaven, and a man in superiorposition must become even better. Once they change a great deal there is boundto be a lot of good. [But] should they stubbornly stay as they are and refuse tochange, their superior would remain stubborn. Should [small officials] not stopbeing wicked, their superior will be even more so. When petty officials andordinary subjects make heaven quite angry by trying to deceive it, the man in asuperior position is bound to become even more evil.35 [Notes.xhtml#ch24fn35]Thus heaven is like a mirror that clearly reflects the heart. It does not failin the slightest to bring to light how petty officials and ordinary subjectsconduct their affairs. Heaven and earth resemble a shadow that follows a man andthat he can’t get rid of. Fortunately, you are a person with good intentions,which you pursue with much energy and care. Although you come to ask about thesematters as if this were nothing and of no benefit, heaven in its deep silencetakes note of what your mouth has to say.How do we know this?By the words [you use]. When a man talks about a matter in words that areauspicious and good, others reply with goodness. They respond with goodness likean echo. When someone’s words are ominous, wicked, and inauspicious, othersreply with wickedness. (65.155) They respond with wickedness, as if they were anecho. Events in general are in response (ying he 應和), [since] they are all sentby heaven. Do you understand this?Yes, I do.Now heaven is high above us, and it is distant, high-ranking, and stern. Howcould it possibly talk personally in each case to a man who is down below? Thusits method is to respond through what is as it is (ziran).36[Notes.xhtml#ch24fn36] Is this clear to you?Yes, it is, my question has been answered. I want you to tell me one more thing.Go ahead.Middle antiquity’s majestic rulers had no texts. There was no “Cooperation ofthe Three.” How were they able to pacify the realm?What a good question! Following heaven’s movement, men were straightforward andplain at this time. They all held on to dao and had only faith in the one.Speaking in many ways they understood each other. Everyone intended to beperfectly sincere and faithful and thought of fulfilling heaven’s will. Nobodywas there to deceive others. That is why lord, official, and ordinarysubject—all three of them—combined their efforts, were of the same mind, andinteracted so that they could conduct their affairs. Disorder will arise if afamily is made up of men who are not of the same mind. Nowadays, [in an agewhen] evil is inherited and transmitted, there are many texts and writings. Withever more texts, men deceive each other. Moreover, [this material] is frivolousand superficial. The worthy and learned become perplexed and no longer meetheaven’s wishes. Once heaven brings forth texts, one must no longer spread wordswithout verifying the truth of what they say. With the “Cooperation of theThree” heaven’s qi is in balance (ping). Heaven’s models are many: one hundredthousand or ten thousand and never the same. Each way of government isdifferent; each method is special. Nowadays, when qi of great peace is about toarrive, one must examine whether texts are in their original form and writtenwith standard characters so that they conform to heaven’s intention. You are notable to analyze the many, many different ways of conducting affairs that havecome about since heaven and earth have set things up. Whatever in one’sactivities agrees with heaven is right, and what doesn’t is wrong. This is avery clear proof of the fact that there is a contract with heaven. Do youunderstand?Yes, I do.Go now, don’t ask any more questions. Now it is not that I couldn’t tell you allthat has happened since heaven and earth set things up37 [Notes.xhtml#ch24fn37]and interpret for you38 [Notes.xhtml#ch24fn38] all the world’s writings, butthere is a problem with writing down too much text. If it can’t be put to use itis of no benefit for the king’s reign. So we must only say what is essential:lack of order in a government stems from too many texts,39[Notes.xhtml#ch24fn39] and this is where the great illness of heaven and earthcomes from. In ancient times, all of the worthy and the wise hated and detested[this situation]. When dao was practiced by a virtuous lord he did not dareproduce texts but made everyone hold on to substance, search for the root, andguard the beginnings, so that the way of heaven was orderly and the countryrested secure. Although you like to ask questions, don’t cause any more text tobe written. (65.156) Go and think about it.Yes, I will.40 [Notes.xhtml#ch24fn40]"},{"pageContent":"SECTION 66ON THE NEED TO STUDY WHAT IS TRUEThis section does not have much to say that is new. We hear about the chance forgreat peace to arrive and the necessary preparations, and learn that withoutmoral reform this chance will be missed. The word “good,” which throughout thetext is applied to taiping believers, is here defined as adhering to “dao,virtue, and benevolence.” The Master stresses that a moral person will not onlybe of benefit to the world, but he will also himself thrive by obtaining cosmicsupport for all his endeavors. He is thus assured of living a long life andbeing successful in it.With such promises the Master asserts that it is profitable to learn from him.Throughout the section he seems to promote his own training of students ratherthan any social or political cause. The disciple facilitates this byestablishing the topic as “teaching and learning.” When Master and disciplespeak of learning, they use the term in the sense in which a scholar of theLunyu would view the studies through which he hopes to become not only educatedbut also good and benevolent. Learning is described as an activity that takes upall one’s time and energy. It must not be postponed or interrupted.In explaining what is to be learned, the Master mentions what he callsexperience and what we might call psychological considerations. He claims thatthe process of becoming good is hampered by human insufficiency, which preventsmost human beings from reaching their aim. For this reason, he advises the adeptto take a radical approach to moral improvement. He should aim at immortality,for instance, if he wants to avoid dying young. With this advice the CelestialMaster modifies the longevity expectations set forth in the Lie xian zhuan andelsewhere, and also the utopian elements of the TPJ’s social and politicalreform agenda. We might put it thus: learning must focus on ideals. The study oflesser objects is said to lead to moral depravity. Students are advised to aimfor the impossible in order to achieve what is necessary for their own and theworld’s survival. If aims are set high enough, all men who are engaged inlearning are bound to profit from it, regardless of their talent.The high standards for what is to be learned contrasts with the Master’srealistic expectations regarding the students’ aptitude and the process oflearning. Also, despite his encouraging description of what a successful studentcan achieve, the Master argues against what he calls empty promises anddistances himself from the carelessness of other teachers. Much of this sectionis concerned with the Master’s attacks on others and their wrong attitudestoward teaching and learning rather than with what the Master himself thinksright. His main target is the well-established project of following “theclassics” and their norms of benevolent conduct. He suggests that these normsmust have been taught poorly or else men would not behave as they do.As the Celestial Master sees it, one subject of proper learning must be“auspicious conduct,” which is opposed to the fascination with mortuary ritualsthat, he argues, holds sway at present. Finally, the disciple refers to theMaster’s accusation that good people are few nowadays and asks how does he know?The Master’s answer seems to imply that the movement he has created is small. Hecomplains that good people find few friends, which, he says, can only mean thatthe majority do not cherish goodness.• • •(66.157) Perfected, step forward. Since qi of honesty and harmony is now aboutto arrive in full measure, men should give up duties and tasks and let theirspirit roam about. But how can they become enlightened and straighten out theirhearts and their intentions?For a start they should refrain from doing evil and then gradually learn to likedoing good, until they don’t know how to do without it. This will allow emperorsand kings to lay down their official insignia, since there is nothing that willneed to be governed;1 [Notes.xhtml#ch25fn1] men of outstanding goodness willflock to the court, and plenty of loyal, trustworthy, and filial gentlemen willreside there.But how is this to be achieved? Your heart, Perfected, loves the good by nature(tian xing 天性). You never cease to worry about heaven’s way. Concentrate yourmind and explain it all.Well, we must urgently instruct men in true dao, true virtue, and truebenevolence.2 [Notes.xhtml#ch25fn2]Why should we teach them true dao?Well, nothing is more appropriate than dao to make them convert (dao hua 道化). Tolove life has no equal. “To possess true dao\" is the namefor supreme goodness.But “without dao\" is the word for someone utterly wicked, wretched, disastrous,and deadly.What you have just said is truly good. I have nothing to add. Why should weinstruct men in true virtue?“Man with true virtue” is the name for someone who can embrace and nurture whatis without limit.3 [Notes.xhtml#ch25fn3] “Without virtue” is a small-minded man,who is utterly deficient and weary.Fine, what you have said. Again, I have nothing to add. It is all quite true.Why should we make them study the way (dao) of benevolence?Because a benevolent man is generous and loving, his embrace reaches everything.(66.158) The word “benevolent” is used only for someone who likes to givewithout end and limit. But the nonbenevolent likes to get [things],4[Notes.xhtml#ch25fn4] hating to pledge and give them away. The word meanssomeone greedy and vile whose wants are as those of animals; he can’tdistinguish between them and himself.What you have said is excellent. Again, I have nothing to add. Now after youhave explained these three cases, leaving me nothing to add, [can we say that]nowadays men must study to be good?They must study hard to be good.Doesn’t “to be good” apply to something specific?I don’t understand what you mean. Please explain.Well, if someone is good his actions agree with heaven’s will and don’t goagainst the intentions of men. This is what we call being good. A good person isnot surpassed by anybody. His name is on a par with dao; he is loved by heaven,nurtured by earth, and engaged by emperors and kings, and the men who serve aruler are bound to be of the same heart and join forces with him. A wickedperson acts contrary to heaven’s will and forever offends men’s intentions. Inopposition to heaven’s way, he doesn’t attend to the four seasons, so thespirits of heaven and of earth hate him. Men dislike the sight of him. He causesfather and mother great harm. The ruler suffers bitterly from [his actions].[\"Wicked\"] is the name for the world’s most5 [Notes.xhtml#ch25fn5] rotten,disastrous, ruinous thing.So a man’s conduct becomes disastrous as soon as it is no longer auspicious andbecomes auspicious when it turns away from disaster. Take someone who isauspicious one moment and disastrous the next, good now and wicked a momentlater—we would not see him as a pure-hearted and attentive person. Youunderstand, don’t you?Yes, I do.Now in your opinion, what should a man’s conduct be like?Well, if he were not to study dao with diligence he would at once becomeignorant of it and be “a man without dao.” But such a man is a most wicked anddisastrous [creature].Now anyone who does not earnestly study virtue becomes at once ignorant of it.But such a man likes to inflict harm and injuries. He is a token of disaster andruin. Should a man not study benevolence he will end up without it, walking thesame road as animals do and sharing their feelings. This is indeed little betterthan being dead. Now a man who doesn’t try hard day and night to learn how to begood forgets the good and becomes wicked. Death and disaster come about throughwickedness. Therefore, once the common people don’t try hard to learn auspiciousconduct, they meet with disaster. “Disaster” is the word for this world’swickedness.Good. Some time ago you already entered true dao and have never returned towickedness. Now you have long harbored all this knowledge, yet still you pretendto be a fool. How come?I would not dare do that.All right. Luckily, you have been able to explain it all. I am quite happy withwhat you have said. (66.159) Now that you have managed to achieve this, you haveheard all I have to say. Should I give up and stop here?Oh, no. When I listen to your warnings I come to the conclusion that I am notgood enough. I would not dare to do all the talking.What you have said is fine, modest as always.That I am now able to go all the way to the true gate6 [Notes.xhtml#ch25fn6] isonly because you have shown me what I lack.Well. All you have just said is correct. Thus were the great wise men and ThreeMajestic Rulers of antiquity always engaged from morning to night in the studyof the true doctrine. We call someone who does not like this study a man withoutdao. Now such a person’s conduct is outrageous (wu shu 無數). Again and again,this fills heaven with great resentment. Truly, heaven does not wish to coversuch a man, nor earth to carry him; neither spirits, nor numinous and vitalbeings, nor even demons wish to render support. The whole world suffers bitterlyfrom this. The wise, the worthies, and all gentlemen greatly detest such a man.Therefore, during the reign of rulers of highest majesty in antiquity, everyonestudied how to be pure and quiet. They understood profoundly the innermostconditions of heaven and earth. Therefore, we must all study the true doctrine(dao) before we can reach an understanding of what heaven and earth want.We call a man who doesn’t undertake a diligent study of virtue man withoutvirtue. Heaven doesn’t love such a man, nor does earth rejoice in him; men don’twish to be friendly with him or close to him. His conduct is such that his actsare never virtuous. He brings harm to the king and calamities to the gentleman.Heaven instructs demons and spirits to no longer support [his] affairs. That iswhy the worthy, wise, and great learned of old would not talk to a man wholacked virtue if they came upon him.Anyone who does not study benevolence all day long will neglect affairs and beunkind. So I would say that a man without benevolence runs counter toeverything, hurts men’s feelings, and disagrees with heaven’s intentions. He ismore like an animal. That is why the wise and worthy of the past would havenothing to do with him.Now anyone who doesn’t learn goodness from a teacher remains a fool and staysdumb. He is ignorant of how to be a good person,7 [Notes.xhtml#ch25fn7] givingreign to his own stupidity instead and making light of being wicked. Now awicked man is utterly foolish, stupid, and dumb. His actions don’t follow theway of heaven and earth. If a ruler were to employ him, he would bring disgraceon his father and mother and cause his ancestors and relatives grief. Since hisconduct doesn’t follow [heaven’s] example, demons and spirits, beingcommissioned by the heart of heaven, dislike him. The harm done is so big thateven by [antiquity’s lenient] three models8 [Notes.xhtml#ch25fn8] he is foundguilty. The wise and worthy of old strongly resented [such conduct], (66.160)and therefore the ancients investigated their own learning. Was it in line withheaven’s intentions? Did their activities promote nothing but dao, virtue,benevolence, and goodness? Conduct must agree with the intentions of heaven andearth and not entail frivolous and superficial words and acts, as these ignoreheaven’s model. Ignore it and you run into disaster, shorten your life, andperhaps even harm later generations.Heaven’s way doesn’t go wrong; it has rules and model. Not to study teachings(dao) that are auspicious but instead to neglect affairs and make light ofoneself is bound to lead to disaster. Now disaster is what heaven, earth, men,and the ten thousand beings and things all detest, and no disaster must bepermitted to last long. Otherwise, it might become the root of great harm andthe entrance gate to bad luck. If someone is caught up in it by mistake, hemight die before he has had a chance to repent his wrongdoings and make themundone. Everyone [who lives] in this world knows this. But certain low-rankingscholars act like great fools and continue to make fun of dao.9[Notes.xhtml#ch25fn9] They don’t know how to preserve it and how to prevent theonset of disaster and harm. They continue to transmit their foolish ideas, whichare thus received and passed on from one to the other. [In consequence,]latter-born generations are even more foolish and dumb than their ancestors.Thus, true dao is blocked and can’t get through, with the result that men makelight of themselves and cannot finish the years heaven [has destined] for them.What we have just been talking about must bear a great burden of blame for this.On seeing my book, Perfected, you must thoroughly take note of it. Be carefulnot to lock it away but let worthy, learned, and bright men have it so that theycan study and understand what it says.So teachings (dao) from former times transmit heaven’s wishes and adhere toearth’s intentions. Since we have the model of the great and true dao of earlyantiquity, we must always teach the study of dao, virtue, longevity, goodness,attentiveness, auspicious conduct, antiquity, balance (ping), and theprolongation of life. By documenting what goodness is, [the firmament of] heavensets the model that keeps the gate to dao open; earth establishes the model thatalways opens the door to virtue. The model set by the wise and worthy of oldcontinues to clear the road to benevolence. Thus the wise and worthy of oldshared heaven’s wishes and earth’s intentions. In the process of prolonginglife, they nourished the twelve thousand plants and beings. They continued totransmit the idea of dao, virtue, and benevolence, and thus made the tenthousand beings thrive. If someone were to transmit disastrous and wicked ideas,all beings would fall into decline. Thus by holding unto dao, virtue, andbenevolence the population grows and enjoys being good. When these things aregiven up, numbers dwindle and a reign becomes poor and miserable.This is the example set by heaven and earth that has been proclaimed as law.Only with a heart of perfect dao, bright virtue, benevolence, and goodness does[man] respond to heaven’s constellations. Then spirits and other numinous beingsenlighten his actions. So the wise and worthy of old never ceased to think ofdoing good, until they had no energy left.10 [Notes.xhtml#ch25fn10] They wouldnot have dared to have wicked thoughts and take the road to disaster. However,the hearts of certain very foolish men are blocked. They really lack insight.(66.161) One must not continue to willfully mislead them on that wicked road todisaster and decay. Left to themselves they won’t know how much they havedeparted from heaven’s way. Since following in one another’s footsteps, theyhave made wicked [conduct] their constant practice and can’t turn away from iton their own. So, obeying heaven’s wish, I show them the written instructions Ihave respectfully received from heaven. They open wide the road to great peaceas it prevailed in early antiquity and let men enjoy goodness while unlearningthe arts of evil conduct.The men [who live in] this world always aim high, but what they achieve isnecessarily inferior and can’t match what they had originally wanted and thoughtof. Thus when a superior scholar is ardent in his hatred of death and his joy inlife and intends to learn how to become a transcendent, he will barely manage tolive for a long time. This holds true for a superior scholar of first-rateambition. While a scholar of medium rank with some ambition who regrets that hisancestors have died young might be ardent in the search for dao and the study oflongevity, he will barely be able to finish the years destined for him byheaven.11 [Notes.xhtml#ch25fn11] This is as far as a scholar whose ambition isas firm as it can be gets. Next comes someone who is frequently ill and whosehealth is below average. If he is ardent in his study he will put a stop [tobeing ill], but he will barely be able to go back to its cause. If illnessworries him but little, he might conceive of bringing it to a halt by studyingwhile he is ill, at a point where his illness has already become serious. Thenext instance is of someone who is seriously ill who might search for dao andways of treatment to save his life when he is dying. For this reason, mywritings attempt to instruct men in heaven’s life-prolonging model. Work hard atit, day and night. Only then will your life be of average length. The commonpeople have met with disaster because they have studied nothing but an averagemodel.A foolish person doesn’t understand the ambition of the ordinary people of theworld.12 [Notes.xhtml#ch25fn12] They always think of what is best but can’tachieve their aim. Thus only by raising their goal as high as reachingtranscendence might they be able to live out the years that heaven has destinedfor them. Great worthies who fulfill all their ambitions are bound to conform towhat I have written about dao. A worthy of medium rank might want all but willstop in between and achieve only half of what he wants. A small-minded man mighthave an aim in the morning, but when evening comes he will have forgotten whatit was. Thus by setting high goals we make it possible for everyone, whetherthey are of superior, average, or inferior ability, to obtain their aims.Nowadays the men of late antiquity, great fools that they are, have sent thetrue doctrine (dao) off into the distance. Only through an intense study ofheaven’s standard patterns and models13 [Notes.xhtml#ch25fn13] can they avoidbeing misled by deceit. To instruct them with average texts is to deceive them.Great fraud, jealousy, and cunning arise from the study of ordinary texts andwell-assembled words. Heaven considers emperors and kings to be its children andhates subordinates who deceive their superiors. (66.162) Because inferiors areoften evil and false, the lord up above with dao, virtue, and benevolence hasnobody to trust and, down below, the people have nobody to whom they woulddevote their lives.The true doctrine, and nothing else, must be studied from morning to night.14[Notes.xhtml#ch25fn14] [Only] through a diligent study of good teachings (dao)can we acquire average teachings. Learning average teachings, one ends up withfrivolous and superficial [knowledge]. When the common people acquire suchknowledge they become confused and their circumstances grow difficult. It is theroad to great disaster and wickedness, bringing emperors and kings bittersuffering and causing the people to be uncontrollable. As proof, take a family’skind father and mother. They teach their children every day to be good and toendure hardship and go without food and clothing in order to nourish theirelders. [The children], however, stick stubbornly to their wickedness. How muchmore does this apply to ordinary people who teach each other frivolous andsuperficial texts because they don’t believe in my writings! If we were to makethem look at my writings, they could judge for themselves what they are missing.Since middle antiquity, men with valuable teachings (dao)15[Notes.xhtml#ch25fn15] taught them to each other in secret. They were notwilling to share them with their disciples. Instead, they taught their disciplesfrivolous, superficial, faked texts. Since this has been going on for a longtime, the way of heaven of today is soiled by great disorder. So it is to beexpected that natural calamities and anomalies happen by the ten thousand—foldin heaven and on earth. The worthy and learned should thoroughly examine thisproblem.16 [Notes.xhtml#ch25fn16] Well. This is something I clearly understand,although at present I don’t mix from morning to night with the common people.Since [this disorder] causes the world much suffering, let us publish this textto make it known. I have reasons for what I say. You must be even more careful,or heaven might find fault with you.Yes, I wouldn’t dare [not be careful]! I am always full of concern when I hearyou speak.You have said this well, so heaven is quite pleased and happy. It won’t harmyou.Yes!Ordinary men achieve nothing but average virtue, even though they mightdiligently and persistently study true virtue. Should they study average virtuethey find only evil and fake virtue. If they study such virtue they turn intofools, beyond all measure (shu 數).17 [Notes.xhtml#ch25fn17] To be without truevirtue and do as one chooses is alien to the pure conduct of a gentleman.Only through diligent study of supreme benevolence does anyone achieve mediumbenevolence. Let him study hard to be moderately benevolent and he will onlylearn to act in an average manner, without benevolence. Should he study withoutregard for benevolence he will turn into a fool and end up as bandit. Withoutknowing [what he is doing], he will kill or injure [others], without all propermeasure. Heaven resents anyone acting as it suits them without concern for theproper order of things (dao li 道理); earth opposes it as well and it is quitealien to humankind.Only through diligent and ongoing study of the way (dao) to great good luck cananyone achieve moderately good luck. He will have little luck if he should studywhat is moderately auspicious. (66.163) If he studies how to behave in aslightly auspicious manner, he will be on the way (dao) to disaster. Let himstudy the way that leads to disaster and he is beyond rescue. Dumb and stupidmen who don’t understand a single thing think that what heaven’s dao says is nottrue but is full of deceit and betrayal. They have complete faith in their ownfoolish hearts and careless words. Up above, they offend heaven’s patterns; downbelow, they ruin earth’s structures. They bring natural calamities upon thehundred families. That is why what I have written about dao is meant to teacheveryone. Someone who studies a lot of it will rank with perfected andtranscendents. Should he not get that far he might achieve a state of peace andsecurity and give the virtuous lord no cause for worries. You must think deeplyabout my words. Then you will never again find fault with them.Yes, indeed.At present, I speak on behalf of heaven. We must dissolve the mass of inheritedand transmitted [evil] that has been piled up since the division between heavenand earth. If we can’t lead men on by the patterns of great dao and greatvirtue, the techniques of supreme longevity, and the road to outstandinggoodness they will go astray in their dumbness and stupidity. The sincere andlong-lasting belief in their own foolish and beclouded hearts makes them wicked.If we can’t stop this, we don’t stand a chance of resolving inherited andtransmitted [evil] and the accusations made by heaven and earth. You had bettercomprehend what I say, hadn’t you?Yes, certainly.The wise man, the worthy, and the superior scholar will certainly agree with mybook once they see and peruse the texts. Then they won’t go wrong by the widthof a single hair. A scholar of medium rank who is willing to go half the waywill understand half of what it says. Should scholars of low rank applythemselves they will just about manage not to ignore the proper model.18[Notes.xhtml#ch25fn18] For this reason they will all be promoted to a placeamong heaven’s people.19 [Notes.xhtml#ch25fn19] Common men, as long as they likethe whole of this book and don’t ignore the proper model, will find the standardway (zheng dao 正道) and look after their own person. They won’t dare take thingslightly and give [others] cause to worry greatly. Once a superior scholaraccepts my teachings and studies without interruption, he might become an honestofficial and after a long time fulfill his main wish, that is, transcend theworld and never again debate issues or covet authority. Upon learning myteachings a scholar of medium rank will become an honest and good clerk andfinish the years destined for him by heaven. Once small-minded people study myteachings, they will manage to become quite attentive. They will be a kindfather, a loving mother, a filial son, an older brother who is able to lead, ora younger brother who is willing to obey. Living as husband and wife they willplan jointly, won’t offend and harm each other, and throughout their life feelno resentment. Placed belowground as demons and spirits they will still carry onin a state of leisure20 [Notes.xhtml#ch25fn20] and never will they be accused ofhaving been wicked. None of their children will die young, before its time.Now at the time when primordial qi and heaven were originally created, inantiquity, all men liked to learn.21 [Notes.xhtml#ch25fn21] They hoped to becometranscendent. Yet they did not manage to live long lives. They escaped criminalpunishment out of fear of death, that’s all. (66.164) Men of late antiquity,great fools that they are, recite and teach frivolous and superficial materialand learn skills that don’t lead to longevity. Although their lives might endall of a sudden, they talk about themselves as if they were immortal. Teachingothers to be unconcerned and careless, they promote ominous activities. They domore for their dead than they do for the living, although the living belong toheaven and the dead to earth. It is damaging to serve earth more than heaven. Ipredict from this conduct that they will become even more foolish.They don’t know a single thing. Once ominous activities flourish, demons thrive.They pester and murder men so that they can’t finish the years destined for themby heaven. Now even someone who diligently studies true teachings might learnonly what is false; working hard to learn true virtue, he might only find itsfalse version. How much more is this the case for men of outgoing antiquity whohave moved far away from dao and are teaching frivolous and superficialmaterial? When they are in dire circumstances and no longer able to restraineach other, they even teach how to promulgate laws and statutes and how todebate about issues of diplomacy.22 [Notes.xhtml#ch25fn22] One has been teachingothers a path not really leading to benevolence when, the teaching finished, onemust grieve about a lack of benevolent behavior.Heaven has set up a model for men to follow and its own name is “great dao.”Earth is “virtue.” Since this is so, heaven and earth are [like] father andmother to the ten thousand beings. They take the lead in all activities and sothey always guide men to goodness. They would not dare mislead them by settingthem on a path to disaster and wickedness. How much more should this be the casefor men [teaching men]! They are heaven’s children and must act in resemblanceto heaven. Nowadays, men are difficult to control because they ignore the propermodel. Once we educate a man through dao and virtue, we let him know how tovalue, take care of, cherish, and control himself. If we were instead to showhim the penal code, we would make him realize that death can come suddenly. So,out of a feeling of bravery, he would make light of himself. Therefore, if hewere to control others, he would do so by force, and then there would be evenmore robbers and murderers who would make others suffer bitterly. So the men wholive in this world would show no concern for each other. There is much in thisto blame. Do you understand? Heed it.Yes, I will.It must be deplored that men still don’t show any benevolence, even after somediligent instruction. In late antiquity, since the propagation of speculativearts,23 [Notes.xhtml#ch25fn23] men have become very shallow. Their mutual hatredand resentment never ceases. Having learned auspicious ways of conduct, they arestill, sorry to say, unlucky. In late antiquity they have promoted the study ofmourning rituals; they prepare for such an ominous event as if they were waitingfor it. By the time they die they have not lived as long as was destined forthem, they have almost ruined their family, and still they don’t understand whatthey have done wrong. When their time comes, they shout to heaven, wail toearth, and call themselves maltreated: “The king’s reign is not at peace, so Ihave to die early.” They have brought this upon themselves through their ownprivate affairs. They are foolish men, disregarding their own roots. (66.165)Once their crime has been identified they might repent, but to little avail,since they are not attentive enough. Upon their death, they might cry aloud, butthis won’t save them.24 [Notes.xhtml#ch25fn24]This is why I am now trying to admonish you. One can reach the steps that leadto longevity by following the constant path (dao) of the great transcendents.Only by educating a man in virtuous conduct will one make him benevolent. Onlyby educating him in benevolence will one make him behave decently and maintainhis character. Then he won’t dare deceive others and deprive them of theirproperty. Teach him to be decent and he will ignore the proper model. Teach himthe model and he will ignore it and murder and rob people. Teach him murder androbbery and he will start a great war. Once this happens even innocent peoplewill cheat [others] and become robbers and bandits in dire circumstances. Forthis reason I promote the model that is presented by heaven’s way. It unlocksthe gate to all-prevailing good luck, closes the road to disaster andwickedness, and [helps us to] reach the steps leading to heaven’s great peace.Each man must recite it for himself. Moreover, since everyone will be attentive,there will be no further need for governmental control.25 [Notes.xhtml#ch25fn25]Men will let the seasons of the year follow each other and be happy to see theirking at his leisure go on long spiritual journeys.Therefore, my writings examine the root and origin of all activities so that wecan grasp their central point. Once we have examined the center, we canunderstand the outcome. Educate a fool in the outcome and great disorder willarise. If at present, in the days of late antiquity, emperors and kings had asmuch dao, virtue, and benevolence as ten thousand times ten thousand men, and ifthey tried to fulfill heaven’s will, they would still be unable to haltdisaster. Instead, the numerous calamities and disturbances that are beingreceived and transmitted would increase. Although [rulers] might think of itwith personal distress and sorrow and wish to bring order to it all, they arefaced with natural disasters and with robbers and bandits in large numbers.Barbarians plot against China. It is not only the ruler’s responsibility thatformer kings made mistakes. We must thoroughly examine its root.That is why heaven has sent me to publish writings that deliver emperors andkings from the evils that are received and transmitted. Should you, Perfected,be of the opinion that my teachings don’t match heaven, just try to actaccording to my text: you will set things up in complete response [to heaven],and not one fraction amiss. This proves my text is right. If we don’t try hardto overcome the grief we are stricken with, why should heaven’s way in itssilence, without having been stimulated, respond to us?26 [Notes.xhtml#ch25fn26]How can a fool become worthy without study? Where would his harvest come from ifa poor man didn’t till the soil? Worthiness comes from study as harvesting comesfrom tilling the soil. Practice what my writings say and you will indeed beharvesting.27 [Notes.xhtml#ch25fn27] This I can guarantee. Without study youwon’t become worthy; without tilling you won’t harvest. You know this, don’tyou?Yes, I do.The true doctrine makes [everyone] upright, great virtue brings prosperity, andwith benevolence everyone is at the right place. (66.166) We may say that such aregime will bring peace about, necessarily.28 [Notes.xhtml#ch25fn28] Do youunderstand? If you wish to repay heaven and earth and thus live for a long timeyou must never allow your belief in dao to lie idle.Yes, indeed. I would now like to ask something else. I don’t dare stop talking.Go ahead.Now how do you know that so many men lack dao, virtue, and benevolence?You have put this well. I watch what they do and what they say.I would like to hear about it.Well, when a man notices dao but opposes it with hatred, I know that he iscompletely without it. When someone notices virtue but detests it, I know him tobe greatly lacking in virtue. I know that a man who sees benevolence but takes adislike to it is wicked and unkind. I know that a man who dislikes the sight ofgood and attentive behavior is a disrespectful and evil person. It is naturalfor [men] to love others who share their interest and hate those who don’t. Agood man detests the wicked, just as a wicked person dislikes the good. Is thisclear to you?Yes, it is.When the wise and worthy of old met someone, they did not talk to him right awaybut looked at him thoroughly in order to know his good and bad points.29[Notes.xhtml#ch25fn29] When they used this method to mirror someone’s conductthey didn’t fail once.Excellent!Now [it is as if] dao had the same bone structure (gu fa 骨法) and blood vesselsas majestic heaven. So it is heaven’s way to detest men who are prone tomurdering others. For this reason, heaven repeatedly resents such men. Earthshares bone structure and blood vessels with virtue, and for this reason hatesmen who cause injury and harm. Earth sees such men as a great nuisance.Benevolence and the wise and worthy have identical bone structure and bloodvessels, so the wise and worthy like benevolent action and hate the use offorce. Thus, benevolence befriends wise men. That is why the wise and worthy ofold had a profound knowledge of how the three dispensations were arranged. Whenthey made laws, they did not dare offend against or depart from true dao,virtue, and benevolence. Heaven acts jointly with the four seasons. Since theyboth put qi in motion, with the same intention, heaven resents someone who runscounter to the four seasons. Earth is of the same heart as the five phases andcooperates with them. Together they nourish all beings, and earth greatlydeplores that something should be injured and damaged before it is destined todie. The wise and worthy feel and act in unison with benevolence. For thisreason, wherever they are, they always venerate dao, treasure virtue, and relyon benevolence. They resent as companions men who are prone to using force anddoing without benevolence.So the phase of fire [dominates the] heart. The heart is [the seat of] wisdom.30[Notes.xhtml#ch25fn30] Fire relies on wood for its existence. Benevolence is thecharacteristic virtue (heart, xin) of wood. Fire shines, so it can [help to]distinguish right and wrong, just as the heart is wise and intelligent. (66.167)For this reason the great wise and worthy of old relied on benevolence andintelligence and turned to a lord with dao, virtue, and benevolence. So I warnyou strictly to give my writings to a lord who knows dao and who is virtuous,benevolent, and intelligent. He will certainly take delight in my teachings,arrive at a thorough understanding of their meaning, and publicize them in anedited version. [It all works] as spirits might do. I don’t want to brag to you.Put it into practice and [what you do] will correspond [to heaven], as if youhad used a pair of compasses and a carpenter’s square. In future times, the menof late antiquity will remember my words.Yes, indeed.Go now. Study hard. Be diligent in learning dao, virtue, and benevolence. Youwon’t achieve anything without them. Make these writings public; don’t juststore them.Yes!31 [Notes.xhtml#ch25fn31]"},{"pageContent":"APPENDIXTHE COMPOSITION OF THE TPJThe transmitted text of the TPJ goes back to Upper Clarity adherents in thesixth century who, with imperial support, edited and published an old taipingscripture. Despite all we know about these editors, we do not know who theauthors of the original material were. It is important to realize, however, thatthe TPJ was by no means the only “old” Daoist text to emerge in the sixthcentury. Although it was older than the rest, and it differed from virtually allthe other texts in its style and message, we may assume that it was giventreatment similar to that of other edited materials, which were indeed as old astheir editors claimed and were left largely in their original shape.1[Notes.xhtml#app1fn1] Tao Hongjing’s Declaration of the Perfected (Zhen’gao)consists to a large extent of carefully edited fourth-century material. Sinceearlier or parallel sources of taiping material are not available, it is hard toestimate the exact input of Upper Clarity editors. As far as we know, taipingmaterial has been transmitted only in the TPJ. This makes it difficult tospecify editorial methods. However, if we look at the way in which the Taipingjing chao (hereafter Chao) edits the old text, we can get an idea of what can bedone. The Chao cuts out small talk, repetitions, tedious and clumsy passages,and inelegant or unclear expressions. The received text of the TPJ, or at leastthe Celestial Master dialogues, shows no traces of such editorial censorship. Wemust assume that its editors were more faithful to their material. It may beadded that the stylistic peculiarity of layer A makes imitation ratherdifficult, as can be seen from one obvious and very poorly executed attempt todo so.2 [Notes.xhtml#app1fn2] All this allows us to assume that thesixth-century text was indeed edited rather than written. However, controversyremains over the extent to which the editors rearranged the material. ŌfuchiNinji,3 [Notes.xhtml#app1fn3] for instance, has argued for a high level ofcorrespondence between the old text and its reedited version, while YoshiokaYoshitoyo4 [Notes.xhtml#app1fn4] has stressed the intensity of sixth-centuryeditorial activity. He has proposed that the sixth-century text was derived fromtwo sources. First, and providing the material for the Celestial Masterdialogues of layer A, there was a Dongji zhi jing 洞極之經 in 144 juan, which hesuggests went back to Zhang Daoling; second, and only as a supplement, there wasthe 170-juan TPJ, which he identified with Gan Ji’s Taiping qing ling shu. Themain source for supposing there to have been two old taiping texts—that is, onein 170 and another in 144 juan—is the “Seven Divisions” section in Yunji qiqian,chapter 6. After quoting passages from the TPJ, the “Seven Divisions” says:The number of chapters is perhaps not identical [in different editions?].Nowadays an edition in ten divisions, jia, yi, etc., in 170 juan is incirculation. According to the Zhengyi jing a Taiping dongji zhi jing exists in144 juan. Today this scripture is almost entirely lost. Both scriptures providea comprehensive explanation of the proper way of governing, evident causes,long-term effects, prohibitions and techniques, etc. According to the [now lost]Zhengyi jing, the Greatest and Highest [that is, Laozi] gave the Dongji zhi jingin 140 juan5 [Notes.xhtml#app1fn5] to the Celestial Master [that is, ZhangDaoling] in the year 142 C.E.6 [Notes.xhtml#app1fn6]The passage continues with a quotation from the Preface to the 180 Precepts,which explains the origin of the 170-juan version: it was supposed to have beenhanded to Gan Ji.7 [Notes.xhtml#app1fn7] A Dongji zhi jing was identified withthe TPJ because the received text of the TPJ contains the term dongji (completepervasion) and even refers to a Dongji zhi jing.8 [Notes.xhtml#app1fn8] The“Seven Divisions” passage seems to tell us that there were two versions of thetext, one going back to Zhang Daoling, the other to Gan Ji, and that in the Suiperiod, that is, after Zhou Zhixiang’s edition of what became the received text,most of the old Dongji jing was lost.9 [Notes.xhtml#app1fn9] The Zhengyi jing,of which we only have the isolated fragments that are quoted in other works, isa crucial source for this information. Ōfuchi doubts its reliability because hesees it as nothing more than the propagandistic effort of a morenorthern-oriented group of Celestial Master adherents to increase the status ofZhang Daoling.10 [Notes.xhtml#app1fn10] Without the two texts to lean on,Yoshioka’s complicated construction of a multilayered editing process is hard tosustain, which would leave Ōfuchi to argue that the sixth-century text is moreor less the original Taiping qing ling shu.There are other references, however, that point to two separate texts. Yamadauses the fact that the Baopu zi bibliography mentions two texts, that is, the50-juan Taiping jing and the 170-juan Jiayi jing, to support Yoshioka’s thesisof a twofold transmission of the old text. He further reminds us that UpperClarity Daoists had a tradition of collating texts from different sources.11[Notes.xhtml#app1fn11] This is a valid point. We can add to this that thesuggestion of separate sources, at least for layer A and layer B, as will bepointed out in the following, makes sense. The sixth-century editors do notconvey details of their sources; the reason for this might be that the TPJcontains hardly any material that could be represented as revealed in the sensein which passages in the Zhen ‘gao are said to have originated directly withdivine figures.A major editorial addition to the old material is a table of contents, whichlists titles for all 366 sections, mainly as “methods” (fa 法) and “instructions”(jue缺), with a few interspersed “precepts” (jie 戒). With good reason, this tablewas published separately, as can be seen from Dunhuang fragment S 4226. It is animpressive list of topics for anyone interested in the Daoist worldview andstyle of life, and it is a testament to the wide range of the old text, from thefirst section’s “The method for distinguishing between right and wrong bydivination” and “The method for guarding oneself against misfortune” to moregeneral topics such as “The method for distinguishing between good and evil inhuman actions.” Other topics are more concerned with matters of cultural andpolitical practice, as reflecting in the sections “The method for revising oldwritings” and “The method for a king to be carefree.” For those parts of thetext that have been transmitted and for which comparison is possible, the titlesare appropriate more often than not. They tend to select one of several pointsdealt with in a section, but usually this selection is in line with the maintheme of a section. The Daoist canon edition has section titles—there are nochapter titles—which are in general identical with the titles given in S 4226.As if to provide the reader with some guidance, sections in the Daoist canonedition are as a rule followed by brief one-line summaries.12[Notes.xhtml#app1fn12] As Wang Ming points out, titles in “old books”13[Notes.xhtml#app1fn13] were customarily given at the end, since readers wouldopen a scripture by rolling it up from the back. We may assume, therefore, thatthe titles placed at the opening of each section go back to the sixth-centuryeditors of the 366-section version of the text, while the summaries are of adifferent and necessarily earlier origin. They have been transmitted inparticularly bad shape and are often corrupt beyond any hope of emendation. Theydo not add up to 366, and one summary can cover two or more sections.14[Notes.xhtml#app1fn14] We may assume, therefore, that the division into 366sections arose with the sixth-century editors, and that the material they usedconsisted of a smaller number of subdivisions.15 [Notes.xhtml#app1fn15] Thatthere were subdivisions holds true for all layers, even for the talismans oflayer C, which contains the following summary: “To the right is advice onreduplicated characters that promote what is supreme and reduce harmfulinfluences.”16 [Notes.xhtml#app1fn16] Often such a summary repeats or varies asection’s title, or, to put it correctly, the authors of the title seem to makeuse of what is said in the summary. Although summaries do not exist for materialavailable only in the Chao, they cover virtually the whole of the transmittedtext. Titles and summaries are useful organizational tools, especially since itis not easy to make out any general rule that would guide the sequence ofsections. While they form clusters, so that several consecutive sections dealwith various aspects of one specific topic, the sequence of these clusters doesnot seem be of any doctrinal relevance.17 [Notes.xhtml#app1fn17]The external appearance of the TPJ conforms to what we can conjecture about itsorigin. The originality of the text’s message is in many parts matched by a useof language that has no parallels in the written tradition. Words are newlycreated, characters are used in a mistaken or at least an unusual way, andstructural components are given new functions. In this, some similarities to Handynasty epigraphical material can be detected,18 [Notes.xhtml#app1fn18] andthere are certain parallels to the language used in early Buddhisttranslations.19 [Notes.xhtml#app1fn19]The TPJ corpus consists of different sets, the most important of which is thetextus receptus, which has been transmitted in the Daoist canon. There is alsothe table of contents of the sixth-century text that was found among theDunhuang manuscripts (S 4226). Of particular importance is the Chao, a digestversion of the original text. The Chao consists of excerpts of the TPJ,organized in ten parts like the scripture itself, and it follows more or lessthe TPJ’s order of chapters and sections. It has been attributed to LuqiuFangyuan (d. 902), who lived a hermit’s life, wrote several texts, and took, aswe are told, an interest in “guarding the one,” which is one of the TPJ’s maintopics.20 [Notes.xhtml#app1fn20]This additional material helps us go beyond the corruption and curtailment ofthe received text to restore an image of its original sixth-century version.Espesset gives a careful account of the stages by which parts of the originalsixth-century text were lost. From the sixth century onward, the TPJ’s fate waslinked to the general destiny of Daoist scriptures, and in particular to thedifferent editions of the Daoist canon through the Song and Ming dynasties. Theoriginal text had 170 chapters, while the present-day text, while still long,has only 57.One might call today’s text overorganized, but so was the original sixth-centurytext. It consisted of ten parts, 170 chapters, and 366 sections. The receivedtext contains a passage that explains the symbolic value of the figure 170. Weare told that 170 represents a combination of the “one,” where everythingbegins, and “hundred,” where it ends, supported by “seven,” which is the numberof stars in the Dipper.21 [Notes.xhtml#app1fn21] The symbolic value of “ten,”representing the ten celestial stems, and of “366” for the days of the year isevident. The size and structure of the scripture are unusual, as a cursoryglance at the tables of contents of other lengthy ancient and medievalscriptures will affirm. However, there are reasons for this. One is the almostdivine position attributed to heaven throughout most of the text. It thereforemakes sense to represent heaven’s structure visibly in the celestial scriptureit is supposed to have authorized. The other is the argumentative and stylisticweakness of the textual material. Chapters and sections are often badlypresented; they do not consist of the neatly composed individual essays thatmake up the great Han dynasty texts. Internal links and sequence are weak. Froman editor’s point of view, it is a reasonable endeavor to mend this by anoutside structure of some rigidity.The organization of the text remains superficial. The seventeen chapters of oneidentical part have little in common, and the same often holds true for thesections that make up one chapter. Sections are the text’s smallest units, andthey deal in general with one topic only, or at least with interconnectedtopics. The text’s first two parts, in which one chapter contains only onesection, are neatly organized. The number of sections per chapter differs widelyin the rest of the text, depending on the size of the sections and on the stylein which they are written, and varies from one to twelve. When sections arewritten in a compact style, without dialogues, more of them are assembled into asingle chapter. Since the scripture’s contents are organized in sections, thepresent translation is also divided into sections.The inherent disorder of the text relates not only to its content, but also tothe way it is written. Distinctly different styles of writing can be made out.Xiong Deji was the first to analyze this,22 [Notes.xhtml#app1fn22] and Hachiyaand Takahashi have slightly modified his division of the text according to thesestyles.23 [Notes.xhtml#app1fn23] Much of this modification has to do withdifferences within style B material and does not force us to assume theexistence of another style. Style A, or layer A, material looks as if it werebased on transcriptions of the discussions taking place between a Daoist masterand a select group of disciples. The suggestions made above in the Introductionabout the text’s origin are mainly based on evidence derived from this part ofthe TPJ. Layer B material is far less colloquial, although it also contains somepassages in direct speech. Disparate though they are, we may categorize allpassages that do not belong to either layer A or layer B as layer C material.Layer C includes an illustration showing a “house of emptiness and nothingness”that resembles the picture of a small building in the Upper Clarity textShangqing qusu jueci lu.24 [Notes.xhtml#app1fn24] Layer C also containstalismans; such talismans accompanied many Daoist scriptures.25[Notes.xhtml#app1fn25] Taiping talismans were known before the sixth-centuryTPJ, as mentioned in Ge Hong’s Neipian under the title Li’er taiping fu 李耳太平符.26[Notes.xhtml#app1fn26] We must assume that all of this material assembled intoday’s text was part of the sixth-century text. The only later additions tolayer C are four sets of drawings of Daoist adepts and their spiritualcounterparts, which seem to be of Ming dynasty origin and to be replacing a setof original illustrations. There is no reason to doubt the age of the writtentext accompanying them, and the S 4226 table of contents lists the respectivesections as “illustrations” 圖.It is appropriate to refer to the stylistically different materials of the textas “layers” since the difference in style is to some extent accompanied by adifference in topic. The program of social reform that is expected to preparefor and facilitate the arrival of great peace is a specialty of layer A. Thesearch for transcendence, for becoming a xian 仙, and for joining the ranks ofcelestial figures is more pronounced in layer B. Layer C comprises material thatdoes not contain dialogues, has little to say that cannot be found elsewhere,and shows no trace of missionary activity.Most of the text belongs to layer A, that is, it consists of dialogues between aCelestial Master and his disciple or disciples. They interact as if they werereal people, asking questions of each other and responding in turn. At times theMaster criticizes the disciple’s answers, or the disciple demands a moredetailed reply. As far as can be determined, the discussion is always betweentwo parties. A disciple always addresses the Master, never another disciple. Wedo not know whether the Master is speaking to an individual disciple or to agroup of disciples, except in the rare instance when he addresses a Perfectedcalled Chun 絶.27 [Notes.xhtml#app1fn27] When the Master talks to a group, itsmembers are called the “six disciples” or the “disciples of the six directions.”We may assume that the two names refer to the same group and that the terms areused as shorthand for the “disciples who have come from everywhere.”28[Notes.xhtml#app1fn28] Dialogues generally begin with one of two scenarios. TheCelestial Master might issue an invitation to an individual student, addressedas “Perfected,” to step forward and discuss matters with him, or a disciplemight approach the Master with a question. The two forms are used without anynoticeable distinction. They both involve an introductory interchange of shortremarks. Once the disciple’s misunderstanding has been clarified and the topicof interest has been pinpointed, the Master then embarks on a longish lecture,with only occasional interruptions. Throughout the dialogues he shows a personalconcern for the disciples. He is pleased or angry with his audience, and praisesand admonishes them. The disciples are eager and attentive, fearful and curious.Their straightforward, often self-interested, approach demands the reader’sattention and even sympathy. The disciples are not very bright. Often—andsometimes repeatedly—they fall into an intellectual trap laid for them by theMaster. They are also worldly and filled with human weakness, while the Master’sviews tend to be strict and fundamentalist.It is not difficult to distinguish layer A from layer B since their stylisticcharacteristics and general language use are different enough. It is possible,moreover, to approach the rest of the text from the assumption that it resembleseither layer A or layer B material. Most of the text that shows no clearcharacteristic of either layer A or layer B contains traces of layer A. This isobvious for sections 68 to 77 and for section 83, for example, which are closeto layer A. The topics dealt with are all in the range of layer A topics:writings, prognostics, the healing powers of plants and animals, the cosmicorder, moxibustion, acupuncture, tombs, and music.29 [Notes.xhtml#app1fn29] Thelanguage has certain layer A peculiarities: “my writings” (wo shu 我書) and “myteachings” (wu dao 吾道) do not occur in layer B material;30[Notes.xhtml#app1fn30] “emperors and kings\" (di wang 帝王), which is used in thesesections, occurs continuously in layer A material but is very rare in layer B;31[Notes.xhtml#app1fn31] and the phrase wan bu shi yi 萬不失一, which is usedfrequently in layer A material, does not occur in layer B sections. Othersections include the posing of questions in addition to the use of layer Avocabulary and deal with topics that fall within the range of layer A. Thisrange is wide but is principally concerned with the political and social effectsof the Master’s doctrine. I see such sections as shortened and stylisticallyimproved versions of the lectures that are central to most of layer A. They aretherefore rewritten or alternative written versions of original layer Asections. This material does not amount to an independent layer. It is termedlayer A’ in the following.The term “Celestial Master” does not occur in layer A’. It is also avoided inthe Chao and in most of the quotations from the TPJ.32 [Notes.xhtml#app1fn32]The reason for this is probably that at a certain stage in the development ofthe religion the title “Celestial Master” had become identified with specifichistorical figures: Zhang Daoling, for instance, or Kou Qianzhi.It may be argued that the long-winded, space-consuming layer A style of writingencouraged the production of resumes, that is, of layer A’ material. Some ofthis layer A’ material may well go back to the original note taking. Individualnote takers might have chosen to provide synopses rather than fulltranscriptions of the whole session. The original sixth-century text may havecontained more of such digest passages. This would explain why the few earlyquotations from the text that have been transmitted do not contain colloquialelements.33 [Notes.xhtml#app1fn33] It is easy to see why résumés would have beenmore widely distributed than the full text.The TPJ contains far less layer B than layer A material. Part 7 consists mainlyof layer B material; part 9 contains two chapters with six sections of layer Bmaterial, according to my reading of the Chao; and there are possibly a coupleof sections of layer B material in part 4. The use of language in the Layer Bmaterial represents a conservative writing style and follows the standardscustomary in literary Chinese. Clusters are avoided, parallel sentencesstructure the flow of the text, and there are sequences of short, four-charactersentences. The difference between the styles of expression of layers A and B isstriking. To give an example, in layer A, the Celestial Master uses thefollowing words to demand that his disciples distribute his material:So I warn you strictly to give my writings to a lord who knows dao and who isvirtuous, benevolent, and intelligent. He will certainly take delight in myteachings, arrive at a thorough understanding of their meaning, and publicizethem in an edited version.34 [Notes.xhtml#app1fn34]In layer B, a similar message is expressed in two brief four-charactersentences: “This text must be distributed; it must not be intercepted.”35[Notes.xhtml#app1fn35] Layer B praises the men of old in the following words:In early antiquity, men were knowledgeable and never dared act against thecommandments. They improved and corrected themselves in fear of going astray.36[Notes.xhtml#app1fn36]In layer A, these men are usually “the wise and worthy of old” and their“knowledge” is outlined in much detail:This is why the wise and worthy of old withdrew day and night from business inorder to think deeply. They never dared ignore what heaven felt. So they wereable to serve majestic heaven as their father and majestic earth as theirmother, the sun as their older and the moon as their younger brother. They keptthe firmament (tian wen 天文) in correct shape and the five phases stable. Theyfollowed the four seasons. They observed their coming and going. Throughself-reflection, they corrected their own conduct. By understanding [things]thoroughly they knew about gain and loss. Their essential dao was simply [theway in which] heaven and earth maintained themselves. They took heaven’ssupport, expressed in Yellow River maps and Luo writings, as their mandate. Forthis reason all their actions were in correspondence, as if they were spirits.Only by these means did they thoroughly fulfill heaven’s wishes. Their wordswere a precise fit, as if compasses and carpenter’s square had been applied. Sospirits and other numinous beings were busy on their behalf.37[Notes.xhtml#app1fn37]Layer A is verbose and circuitous, whereas layer B is brief and to the point.This difference cannot be put down to the use of direct speech in layer A; thedialogues interspersed in layer B material do not differ in language use orcontent from the rest of this layer.38 [Notes.xhtml#app1fn38] In layer B, theCelestial Lord (tian jun 天君), Great Spirit (da shen 大神), Disciple (sheng 生), andWise Man (sheng ren 聖人) speak literary Chinese, as do discussants in theZhen’gao.39 [Notes.xhtml#app1fn39] The Celestial Lord is not “heaven,” butthrough the spirits, whom he employs, he knows all, so we may call himomniscient.40 [Notes.xhtml#app1fn40] He has an impact on the length of a humanbeing’s life, in contrast to the Celestial Master, who does not. Therefore, theCelestial Lord’s authority resembles that of heaven more closely than does thatof the Celestial Master. The main speaker is the Great Spirit. He is teacher ofthe Disciple and the Wise Man, and himself a subordinate and disciple of theCelestial Lord, who takes an interest in the Disciple through the Great Spirit’smediation. The scenario of these conversations resembles the situation depictedin the first chapter of the Zhen’gao. Whether the disciple, when meeting withtranscendents, is on a spiritual journey is not expressed clearly, but giventhat he meets with a figure as spiritual as the Celestial Lord, we must expectthat it is so. In contrast, the Celestial Master meets his disciples in aworldly, school-like environment.Certain sections of the text where these figures are not mentioned may still beseen as layer B material. An introductory wei 惟41 [Notes.xhtml#app1fn41]characterizes this style. The character is used as if by editorial design, toannounce that the following comes from one source rather than from another.The content of layer B is distinct, at least in parts. The main concern islongevity, which is seen as an individual problem. Although the date of aperson’s birth has some impact on the length of his life, he won’t live long ifhe does not adhere to moral rules. A good person believes in heaven, does asheaven bids, and respects all the generally established rules of good conduct.He does not lie, cheat, or rob, is a good son, and does not ruin his family bydrinking.42 [Notes.xhtml#app1fn42] However, in layer B the more specific reformssuggested in layer A are not referred to, and the definition of good and badconduct is conservative. Filial piety, for instance, is seen as an importantcondition for living a long life,43 [Notes.xhtml#app1fn43] and it is said toconsist largely of performing the appropriate sacrifices and other rituals inhonor of one’s ancestors.44 [Notes.xhtml#app1fn44] The Celestial Master of layerA, on the other hand, stresses the need for a filial son to prolong the life ofhis parents.45 [Notes.xhtml#app1fn45] There is no mention in layer B of anapproaching apocalypse, and consequently no need for mass conversion andgovernment-induced social reform. However, good conduct does not automaticallyguarantee a long life. The text envisages a dual-track system. On one side isthe disciple’s lifestyle and personal background. On the other is a bureaucraticprocess of submitting petitions to the right figures in the celestialbureaucracy in the hope of influencing examinations and high-level decisions sothat the applicant’s good qualities are taken into proper consideration. Wordspertaining to bookkeeping abound.46 [Notes.xhtml#app1fn46] The administration ofheaven, its bureaucracy, its archives, and the form of its publications are ofgreat interest to the authors of layer B. The attraction of this topic isenhanced by the fact that the celestial bureaucracy is not a closed shop,something that is hinted at in layer A and further described throughout layer B.Deserving individuals can look forward to positions in the celestial world. Thetextus receptus also contains a few modified layer B passages, similar to layerA’ passages.47 [Notes.xhtml#app1fn47]There are two reasons that I read layer A and layer B material under theassumption that layer A material was produced before layer B and that it wasknown to the author or authors of layer B. First, specific TPJ terms like“inheriting and transmitting [evil]” (cheng fu 承負) and “twelve thousand beingsand objects” (wan er qian wu 萬二 千物) are used but not explained in layer B, as ifreaders were expected to know their meaning.48 [Notes.xhtml#app1fn48] Second, wemight call the layer A vision of sociopolitical renewal empire-oriented. It iseasier to place it in the environment of the Han empire than in the periodduring or after its breakdown, that is, after the “apocalypse” had in some sensetaken place. For layer A, a world that deserved saving and could be saved stillexisted. For layer B material, the individual’s main contact is with a celestialbureaucracy. He must learn to understand its rules, regulations, and archivesfor the sake of his own earthly and post-earthly well-being. The controller ofdestiny is frequently mentioned throughout layer B material, and so too is the“broad daylight” (bairi 白日) in which the fortunate adept will rise to heaven.This term does not occur at all in layer A material. Still, the two layers sharea number of features. Stylistically, in the first instance, both containdialogues between adepts and their superiors that involve elements of directspeech and, in particular, frequent exhortations. “Be careful to . . .” (shenzhi 个真之) is a constant feature of both layers. In terms of content, both layersstate that attending to moral norms is the basis for human happiness. Layer Bmaterial shows traces of a missionary project.49 [Notes.xhtml#app1fn49] Thepromise of a great peace bound to arrive pervades the text. The misery of thepoor is deplored.50 [Notes.xhtml#app1fn50]Clearly, what has been presented here is not a thorough method of dividing thetext. The main problem with this division is the assumption that the use oflanguage in layers A and B of the received text provides the full picture, andthat it is thus permissible to define a combination of characters as“characteristic of layer A” if they are frequent in the layer A material of thetextus receptus and are not used in layer B. Moreover, an argument based oncertain isolated language elements cannot replace a full-fledged linguisticanalysis. In the meantime, however, I consider the results of this divisionsound enough to suggest reducing the amount of layer C material to a fewisolated chapters and sections, and calling the rest either layer A’ or layerB’. A similar approach is taken to the large amount of text that is availableonly in the form of the Chao. Here again we find traces of either layer A orlayer B expressions, and of specific terminology. No joint characteristics canbe established for layer C. The common feature of these materials is thescripture’s sixth- century editors.51 [Notes.xhtml#app1fn51]With all of this, it must be kept in mind that until its sixth-century editionthe transmission of taiping-related material was open to loss, additions, andchanges. We are told that it was practiced “in private.”52[Notes.xhtml#app1fn52] Going back to the very beginnings of Daoism, it was notprotected by any school or movement. It has been suggested that at some stagethe Du 杜 family, with its long background of Daoist commitment, felt responsiblefor the text.53 [Notes.xhtml#app1fn53] However, this is hard to verify, and inany case it would not amount to a continuous tradition. Material was thereforeadded, as, for instance, section 51, which is rendered suspect by the fact thatit has virtually nothing to say and contains a direct appeal to the editorsregarding where it should be placed.A rough overview of the received text might clarify some of what has been saidhere. It follows Wang Ming’s division of the text supported by Yu Liming’scorrections. Espesset’s thorough and meticulous account of the whole text hasbeen consulted continuously, in particular for those parts for which the Chao isour only source.54 [Notes.xhtml#app1fn54] I have marked the points where mydivision of the text into sections differs from his. According to my list, anumber of Chao passages cannot be attributed to an S 4226 section title. This isnot surprising when we consider that some TPJ section titles are not entirelyappropriate and that some Chao quotations are quite short. The attribution tolayers is my own.55 [Notes.xhtml#app1fn55] Since, according to S 4226, none ofthe first seventeen chapters is subdivided into sections, we must assume thatpart i was relatively short to begin with. From the evidence of the textusreceptus, we know that the Chao skips sections and that it changes theirsequence. This must be kept in mind when attempting to sketch the original textaccording to the Chao. In the following list italics are used for those parts,chapters, and sections that are not in the transmitted text of the TPJ; “ch.”stands for “chapter,” “s.” for “section,” and “p.” for page number, and thenumber following the page number is the line number.PART 1 (CHAO ONLY)ch. 1A?56 [Notes.xhtml#app1fn56](p. 718.7-720.11)ch. 2?57 [Notes.xhtml#app1fn57](p. 720.12—722.4)ch. 3?58 [Notes.xhtml#app1fn58](p. 722.5—723.2)ch. 4?(p. 723.2—8)ch. 5?(p. 724.4-7)ch. 6?(p. 724.8—725.5)ch. 7A?59 [Notes.xhtml#app1fn59](p. 725.6—726.1)ch. 8?(p. 726.1-4)ch. 9A?60 [Notes.xhtml#app1fn60](p. 726.5—12)ch. 10?(p. 727.1—11)ch. 11?(p. ]28.i—5)ch. 12?(p. 728.6—12)ch. 13?(p. 729.1—730.2)ch. 14?(p. 730.3—11)ch. 15?(p. 723.9—724.3)ch. 16?(p. 730.12—731.9)ch. 17A?61 [Notes.xhtml#app1fn61](p. 731.10—732.6)PART 2 (CHAO ONLY)62 [Notes.xhtml#app1fn62]ch. 18?63 [Notes.xhtml#app1fn63](p. 11.3–8)ch. 19?(p. 12.1–10)ch. 21A?64 [Notes.xhtml#app1fn64](p. 12.11—13.7)ch. 22A?65 [Notes.xhtml#app1fn65](p. 13.8-15.1)ch. 24??66 [Notes.xhtml#app1fn66](p. 15.1—4)ch. 26A?67 [Notes.xhtml#app1fn67](p. 15.5—9)ch. 2768 [Notes.xhtml#app1fn68](p. 15.10–16.11)ch. 29A?69 [Notes.xhtml#app1fn69](p. 16.12—17.6)ch. 30?(p. 17.7-18.10)ch. 31A70 [Notes.xhtml#app1fn70](p. 18.11–20.6)ch. 32A?71 [Notes.xhtml#app1fn71](p. 20.7–21.11)ch. 33s. 33A?72 [Notes.xhtml#app1fn72](p. 21.12—22.3)ch. 34s. ?A73 [Notes.xhtml#app1fn73](p. 24.10—27.8)s. 40A74 [Notes.xhtml#app1fn74](p. 22.4—24.9)PART 375 [Notes.xhtml#app1fn75]ch. 35s. 41A; the second half is linked to section 42.s. 42As. 43Ach. 36s. 44As. 45A; this section is close to section 44.s. 46Ach. 37s. 47A; the second half is linked to section 48.s. 48Ach. 3876 [Notes.xhtml#app1fn76]ch. 39s. 50As. 51A; this very short section is linked to section 50.ch. 40s. 52As. 53Ach. 41s. 54A; this section records two dialogues; the second half is poorly transmitted.s. 55Ach. 42s. 56A; there is no introduction.s. 57A; the introduction is unusual.s. 58Ach. 43s. 59Ach. 44s. 60A; Chun is mentioned.ch. 45s. 61A; this section records two dialogues (rupture p. 122?); the content iscoherent.ch. 46s. 62Ach. 47s. 63As. 64Ach. 48s. 65Ach. 49s. 66Ach. 50s. 67A; Chun is mentioned; there are no dialogue elements toward the end.s. 68A’?77 [Notes.xhtml#app1fn77] This and the next sections of this chapter are veryshort.s. 69?s. 70?s. 71?s. 72A’?78 [Notes.xhtml#app1fn78]s. 73?s. 74?s. 75?s. 76?s. 77A79 [Notes.xhtml#app1fn79]ch. 51s. 78A; Chun is mentioned.PART 4ch. 52s. 79?

[Introduction.xhtml#rintro1fn23] This is from a doubtful citation of DongZhongshu, as quoted by Eichhorn (1957: 120) from Zhao Lingzhi’s (Song) Hou qinglu (chap. 1, p. 8). In the Chun qiu fan lu (chap. 6 “Wang dao” 王道, pp. 101–5)the reign of the Five Emperors and Three Kings of the distant past is painted insimilarly rosy colors. Nothing was amiss. The ruler demanded only moderate taxesand labor services, men were honest, good, and gentle, poisonous insects andwild animals did not attack others, weather conditions were perfect, prisonswere empty, and the barbarians voluntarily submitted to the Chinese emperor.24.

[Introduction.xhtml#rintro1fn26] As stated in Huainan zi 2 “Chu zhen” 叔真, p.5b; the text says “Great Hall,” which the commentator Gao You (ca. 168–212)understands as “Hall of Light.” For the function of this building see Puett2001: 158f.27. [Introduction.xhtml#rintro1fn27] Han shu 22.1031.28. [Introduction.xhtml#rintro1fn28] The Han dynasty building was set up somedistance from an earlier Zhou dynasty building of the same name. Eichhorn (1973:110f.) argues convincingly that in the second century B.C.E. there was littleactual knowledge about a pre-Qin “Hall of Light” and the ceremonies performed init. This increased the liveliness with which the topic was debated under EmperorWu.29. [Introduction.xhtml#rintro1fn29] See Loewe 1974: 82.30.

[Introduction.xhtml#rintro1fn56] Zuercher (1982: 3) gives the third centuryC.E. as the starting point for messianic speculations; he also argues that thesespeculations were indigenous, that is, not instigated by Buddhist influence.While this account must be somewhat revised in view of the TPJ’s notion ofimminent disaster, it remains a fact that even at the end of the dynastymainstream texts seem to express full confidence in the way heaven assigns itsmandate; therefore, they don’t consider alternatives.57.

[Introduction.xhtml#rintro1fn63] Historically speaking, then, the rebels’use of the title does not go as far back as the Zhuangzi. When the First Emperorwanted to become “perfected,” he hoped to become full of energy and live for along time. He tried to achieve it by following the advice of certain experts invitality techniques, who told him, for instance, to hide his abode (Shi ji6.257).64.

My translation follows LiuShaorui 1992, Wu Rongzeng 1981, and Eichhorn 1955: 313. Fang Shiming’s (1995 and1993) “Yellow God Yuezhang” is difficult to reconcile with Ge Hong’s (Baopu zineipian 17.89; cf. Ware 1966: 298) use of the term. Huangshen Yuezhang occurs oninscriptions that are meant to make graves secure, that is, to protect theliving from the spirits of the dead, and on other objects of demon control, suchas on talismans worn by travelers for their protection.88.

[Introduction.xhtml#rintro1fn104] The Mozi chapters on heaven’s will (tianzhi 天志) and on spirits (ming gui 明鬼) provide many examples. The concept ofrecompense pervades the encounters between the last emperors of an old and thefounders of a new dynasty; see Schaberg 2001, chapter 6. Compare also the fateof King Ling of Chu as told in the Zuo zhuan (Duke Zhao, thirteenth year,46.2069b) and the figure of Du Bo (Guoyu, Zhou, 1.10).105. [Introduction.xhtml#rintro1fn105] San guo zhi 8.263.106. [Introduction.xhtml#rintro1fn106] Newly converted followers were “demonsoldiers” (gui zui 鬼卒), as if they owed corvée service to the demons; Zhang Luwas said to teach gui dao, “demons‘ dao,” and his mother was seen as an expertin it (San guo zhi 8.263 and Hou Han shu 75.2432). Zhang Jue was said to havetrusted in shen 神 and ling 靈 spirits.107. [Introduction.xhtml#rintro1fn107] The historians’ general account of theearly Celestial Master community is remarkably positive. Its institutions bear acertain resemblance to descriptions of Da Qin, the “Roman Empire,” where thefigure of thirty-six and the “houses of responsibility” can be found. “Da Qin”was said to be a mysterious place in the far west, which no one had seen withhis own eyes but which writers of the third and fourth centuries talked aboutwhen they described a state as they thought it should be (see Stein 1963).108.

Seidel 1969: 48–55. The Hou Han shu (50.1669) establishes an indirectlink between the Yellow Turbans and Huang-Lao jun: when accused of conspiracy,worshipers of the deity and their friends—who did not support the YellowTurbans—needed to claim that they addressed the deity only to gain long life andpersonal benefits, and certainly not with any political aim in mind. However,the fact that Zhang Jue was called an adherent of “Huang-Lao teachings” (see HouHan shu 71.2299) may have been a reference to his worldview rather than to hisreligious practice.112. [Introduction.xhtml#rintro1fn112] First mentioned for the year 165 (Hou Hanshu 7.313), the rituals took place so often that they are mentioned in the finalappraisal of the emperor’s career (7.320); cf. de Crespigny 1976: 82f.113.

[Introduction.xhtml#rintro1fn131] Ge Hong (Neipian 4, p. 12) informs usthat Ge Xuan’s library goes back to Zuo Ci 左慈, whose Ulenspiegel-like encounterswith dignitaries of the late Han and early Three Kingdoms period are related inthe fang shi chapter of the Hou Han shu (82B. 2747f.) and in the Shenxian zhuan(5.19b–20b).132. [Introduction.xhtml#rintro1fn132] See TPJ section 50, below.133. [Introduction.xhtml#rintro1fn133] A Shen shu 神書 in 170 juan is mentioned inthe Mouzi (see Hong ming ji, p. 6a). It is said to deal with Wang Qiao (that is,Wangzi Qiao: see Kaltenmark 1987: 109f.), Chi Song (that is, Chisong zi: seeKaltenmark 1987: 35), the eight transcendents, and longevity. There is no needto identify this “spirit scripture” with the book mentioned by Xiang Kai. Shenshu as used in Xiang Kai’s memorial is probably not meant to be a title butrather a respectful reference to the work entitled Taiping qing ling shu (butcf. Keenan 1994: 147f. for an alternative view).134. [Introduction.xhtml#rintro1fn134] Among those who have introduced schemesfor such identification, Petersen (1990a), Ōfuchi (1997), and Yamada (1999)deserve special attention since they not only attempt specific identificationsbut also provide an introduction to the earlier debate. See the Appendix formore details.135. [Introduction.xhtml#rintro1fn135] Maeda (1994) argues that the Zhengyi jingplayed a crucial role in the process of setting up the “four support sections.”Therefore, the fact that the Zhengyi jing refers to a 144-juan version of thetext, rather than to the 170-juan edition that the received text resembles,makes it likely that a certain Meng in the early sixth century (see Ōfuchi 1997:290f.) knew only the 144-juan text and that the new 170-juan edition was notavailable during his lifetime. A similar point is made by Yamada (1999: 143–44)when he mentions that the creator of the taiping “support section” must havebeen in possession of a fragmentary version of the old Han text to have createda supplement of this name, since the new 170-juan version was not available atthat time.136. [Introduction.xhtml#rintro1fn136] It is noteworthy that the concept ofgreat peace did not enter the organization of the Daoist canon until this stage,that is, no earlier than the lifetime of Tao Hongjing. There seems to be nosimple answer to why this was so. Yamada (1999: 140) reconsiders some of thefrequently raised speculation on this point, and he mentions in particular LuXiujing’s (406–77) selective approach to Celestial Master material and KouQianzhi’s (d. 448) mainstream outlook. There also remains the question of whythe taiping section was set up as the supplement to the section or cavern of theDaoist canon that focused on Lingbao (Numinous Treasure) writings. Yamada (1999:148–51) argues that there were doctrinal reasons for this in that both groups oftexts aimed at saving the world; in other words, they dealt with social and evenpolitical issues.137. [Introduction.xhtml#rintro1fn137] See Shangqing daolei shixiang 1.11b–12a;cf. Reiter 1992:30–32. Chen Guofu (1963: 465) and Bumbacher (2000: 199–201f.)both accept the passage as a proper Daoxue zhuan quotation.138. [Introduction.xhtml#rintro1fn138] Nan Qi shu 54.927.139. [Introduction.xhtml#rintro1fn139] See Mansvelt Beck 1980: 163.140. [Introduction.xhtml#rintro1fn140] See Mao shan zhi 15.2b–3a. Theattribution of such high rank is enhanced by a Taiping yulan (666.2972a)quotation from the Zhen’gao, which Bumbacher (2000: 341) identifies as part ofthe Daoxue zhuan. It deals with the life of Sun Tao, a disciple of Tao Hongjing.In Bumbacher’s translation the last two sentences read:Tao Hongjing held fast in his hand the secret instructions, so that hisdisciples were seldom able to see them. He only handed them down to the twopersons Sun Tao and Huan Kai.The Mao shan zhi account of Huan’s life does not mention the TPJ episode. It wasperhaps not important enough to deserve much notice and must have taken placewhen Huan was still quite young and within the precinct of Tao Hongjing’sschool. However, there seems to be no reason to question either his historicalidentity or his TPJ-related activity.141. [Introduction.xhtml#rintro1fn141] See Strickmann 1978: 468.142.

[Introduction.xhtml#rintro1fn146] After the demise of Hou Jing, Xiao Yi,prince of Xiangdong, ruled for just two years as Emperor Yuan, from 552 untilhis execution in 554. Much of the received text of the Jinlou zi consists ofquotations of passages from similar earlier collections of wise sayings andmeaningful anecdotes; see, for instance, the episode about the rich and the poor(6.112) and about Gong She of Chu (6.110); for the emperor’s interest in theLaozi, see Liang shu 5.134.147. [Introduction.xhtml#rintro1fn147] Huan is said to have been employed ashead of the Qingyuan zhi guan (Monastery of Far-Reaching Clarity) by Xiao Wei(476–533), Liang emperor Wu’s brother, who became prince of Nanping in 517 andplayed a role in Liang dynasty literary salons (see Liang shu 22.348, Nan shi52.1291f.; cf. Marney 1976: 62). Huan’s stay in the Monastery of Far-ReachingClarity is also documented on a stela, whose inscription is given in Mao shanzhi 21.1a–b; in Bumbacher’s translation (2000: 460) it reads, “There is alsoQingyuan’s monastery, which the Prince of Nanping, Xiao Wei, had set up. Thiswas where Tao Hongjing’s disciple Huan Qingyuan dwelled. Huan’s teacher-name wasFakai.” Moreover, Huan is said to have set up a Daoist oratory, here called Jingshe 精舍 (Cottage of the Essential), on the right-hand side of Fragrant Hill(Yugang; impossible to locate), for which “the retired scholar Zhou” wrote aninscription (Mao shan zhi 15.2a–b). Fukui Kojun (1952: 227) and others believe“the retired scholar Zhou” to have been the Daoist Zhou Zhixiang, who“discovered” a taiping text for Emperor Xuan (r. 569–82) of the Chen dynasty.148. [Introduction.xhtml#rintro1fn148] See Preface to the Double CharacterTalismans of the Scripture on Great Peace, TPJ p. 745.149. [Introduction.xhtml#rintro1fn149] See Liang shu 6.144f.150. [Introduction.xhtml#rintro1fn150] Quotations are frequent in Tang dynastymaterial. The text is quoted in the Sandong zhunang (1.21a–23a; cf. Reiter 1990:29–31) and in the Daodian lun (TPJ p. 54, 58, 59, 78, 100, 102, 132, 136, 158,512, 699, 719), for instance, both from the seventh century. The Yunji qiqian(6.15b–16a) account of the seven Daoist canon divisions dealt with earlier isanother example; it argues that the “unity of the three” (sanyi) was the taipingdivision’s main idea, which is a quite adequate characterization of the contentof the TPJ. The passage includes a set of quotations documenting thesocio-political aims of the text, particularly the interplay between heaven,doctrine, and government. The quotations in Li Xian’s (651–84) commentary toXiang Kai’s biography in the Hou Han shu show that the new TPJ had reachedbeyond Daoist circles. Although only two of these quotations can be verified inthe received taiping material (for 30B.1081, see TPJ p. 18, Chao; for Hou Hanshu 30B.1084, see TPJ p. 219, Chao), they are all relevant to the message of theold text. They deal with the need to perceive the threefold structure of theworld, and to keep in mind the methods of population increase, as well as theorigin of natural disasters and the methods for controlling them. Li Xian’s (HouHan shu 30B.1080) own words provide further evidence of the role played by thenew TPJ in the discourse of the early Tang. He states:This sacred book (shen shu, the term used in Xiang Kai’s memorial) is the TPJ ofthe Daoists of today. The scripture is divided into ten divisions in line withthe heavenly stems, and each division has seventeen chapters (juan).It must also be kept in mind that the concept of great peace was put topolitical use during the early Tang period. The message was conveyed inmysterious ways to Tang Gaozu (r. 618–26) that great peace would prevail if heofficially promoted Daoism. Also, the auspicious prophecy of Wang Yuanzhi (d.635) in regard to the future Taizong said that he would be “Son of Heaven ofGreat Peace” (see Wechsler 1985: 70–73).151. [Introduction.xhtml#rintro1fn151] On the basis of taboo characters,Espesset (2002a) plausibly dates the fragment to between 626 and 657. Giles“957: 219) dates it to the late sixth century and is supported in this by Ōfuchi(1979a: 509; 549–50), whose argument is based on the similarity of the featuresof S 4226 with other, dated, manuscripts. For a reproduction of the originalmanuscript, see Zhang 1992, vol. 6.152. [Introduction.xhtml#rintro1fn152] See Bokenkamp 1994: 69–70; cf. alsoNickerson 2000: 264.153. [Introduction.xhtml#rintro1fn153] In the Zhen’gao it is claimed that if youare to become an official of the Latter Sage (hou sheng zhi chen 後聖之臣) and letthe people be in great peace (taiping min), you need to “keep all twenty-fourspirits within you”; see Zhen’gao 9.104, quoting a Baoyuan yulu bai jian qingjing 甚元玉籙白簡青經.154.. The Latter Sage who figures in the publication of the TPJ combines aspectsof several deities: he has contact with Green Lad, appears in a renchen year,and has the family name Li; see Yoshioka 1970: 72–88. The deity is firstmentioned in the Shenxian zhuan (1.1b) biography of Laozi as the saint’sincarnation after the period of the Three Majestic Rulers. Given the status ofLaozi, the origin of the wording of this particular biography is even moreproblematic than for the Shenxian zhuan as a whole (Penny 1996: 186). Theinclusion of the Latter Sage might therefore result from a later addition. Butthe Sage became well established with Tao Hongjing if we are to trust thefrequent mentions in the Zhen’gao, in particular in chapter 9 in the context ofan approaching universal cataclysm. In Tao Hongjing’s Dongxuan lingbao zhen lingweiye tu a figure whose name includes “Golden Gate” occurs in various places (p.3b; 5a). He is expected to descend in a renchen year as Imperial Lord of theGolden Gate of Great Ultimate named Li (Taiji jin que dijun xing Li; p. 8a) toinstruct the Ruler of Great Peace (taiping zhu).155. [Introduction.xhtml#rintro1fn155] See Seidel 1969/1970; cf. Yoshioka 1970:89.156. [Introduction.xhtml#rintro1fn156] See Nickerson 2000: 274.157. [Introduction.xhtml#rintro1fn157] See Li Xian’s commentary to Xiang Kai’sHou Han shu biography (TPJ p. 747); see also the textual history recorded in S4226 and in the Preface to the Double Character Talismans of the Scripture onGreat Peace (TPJ p. 744).158. [Introduction.xhtml#rintro1fn158] The details of the saga of the TPJ’sdiscovery strengthen this point. Tao Hongjing’s hesitant attitude is testamentto his political acumen. For a “Scripture on Great Peace” to be published andpromoted, the time had to be right.159. [Introduction.xhtml#rintro1fn159] See Petersen 1990a: 182–87 on Gan Ji.160. [Introduction.xhtml#rintro1fn160] Called “the capital Luo” (jing Luo 京洛)(TPJ 198.611, layer B), as was customary during the Later Han period; forChang’an see below, section 50.161. [Introduction.xhtml#rintro1fn161] An educated reader was often reminded inwhat the Master said of passages in the Laozi and also the Lun yu, as pointedout in the notes that accompany this translation.162. [Introduction.xhtml#rintro1fn162] See, for instance, certain yue fu poems,as collected by Anne Birrel 1988: 78–93, or the anxiety manifest in tombbuilding and burial ritual (see Powers 1991: 50–58).163. [Introduction.xhtml#rintro1fn163] Takahashi (1988) gives a good account ofthe Celestial Lord’s arguments, that is, of layer B. However, Takahashi’s highexpectations of a text’s coherence and unity led him to see too manydiscrepancies within this material to define it as one layer.164. [Introduction.xhtml#rintro1fn164] See Seidel 1969/1970. The argument thatthe TPJ’s Celestial Master does not endorse rebellious conduct is as irrelevantto the question as the fact that he promotes the Han dynasty’s color, red. Whilethe dynasty was in power there were necessarily constraints on publicutterances.165. [Introduction.xhtml#rintro1fn165] Fang Shiming (1995 and 1993, the latterin Chinese, quoting the original sources) shows that the title “messenger fromthe Celestial Emperor” (tian di shi 天帝使, and tian di shen shi shi zhe 天帝神師使者)(1993: 8) occurs on grave-securing writs, suggesting that this prompted rebelleaders to use the title.166.

See also Hou Han shu 71.2309 (Biography of Zhu Jun): theYellow Turban Zhang Mancheng called himself shen shang shi 才申上使.167. [Introduction.xhtml#rintro1fn167] See TPJ 55.85; 59.100; 63.140; 65.152;129.331; 132.348; 165.461; the material is also mentioned in layer B, TPJ185.566.168. [Introduction.xhtml#rintro1fn168] Ornamental particles abound, particularlyfu 復 (again). Directional verbal complements such as qu 去, lai 來, chu 出, shang上, and xia 下 are also in use.169. [Introduction.xhtml#rintro1fn169] Some examples of this are referred to inthe notes accompanying the translation. In the first lines of section 132 (pp.348f.) the Chao omits zhi shu 之屬 (the like of) and cuts out the Perfected’sanswer bu ye 不也 (This is not so). It also cuts out the three-character verb weizuo qiu 為作求 (to search), reduces qu zhong 取中 to qu (here used as ba 把 as inlater Chinese), and replaces the phrase fu yu shang 付於上 (to submit) with xian 獻.170. [Introduction.xhtml#rintro1fn170] The choice of unorthodox forms ofcharacters points in the same direction. See Yu 1997.171. [Introduction.xhtml#rintro1fn171] The use of qu 取 in disposal constructionsis one point that brings the wording of the TPJ into proximity with the languageused in early sutra translations; see TPJ 100.229: qu qi zhong da shan zhe jizhi yi wei tian jing 取其中大善者集之以為天經, where qu 取 is used as ba 巴 as in laterChinese; see also TPJ 78.190 dan qu wei yan huan yi ni kao 但取微言還以逆考 (investigateagain the subtle words) and Qu qi zhong da shan zhi shi you yi yu di wang zhengzhi zhe liu zhi 取其中大善之事有益於帝王正治 者留之 (Retain in this those events of greatexcellence that are of use to emperors and kings when they attempt to reignproperly) (TPJ 129. 334). Cao and Yu (2000) argue that the disposal structureoriginated in Later Han dynasty Buddhist translations.172. [Introduction.xhtml#rintro1fn172] See Zuercher 1977.173. [Introduction.xhtml#rintro1fn173] The formation of trisyllabic words byjoining synonyms occurs often in layer A: zeishashang |戎 |焚傷 (to injure) (TPJ41.36; 59.99); for several similar word formations with the component zei seeLiu Dianjue’s TPJ concordance (Liu 2000: 1752); yu’anbi 愚闇蔽 (foolish) (TPJ110.295 and yubi’an TPJ 165.461); julijie 疽癘济 (skin disease) (TPJ 127.319 and320). “Natural calamities” (zaibiankuai 災變怪) occurs frequently (TPJ 55.86;59.100 and 102; 61.114; 127.322).174. [Introduction.xhtml#rintro1fn174] See Hu Chirui 2002: 280–85.175. [Introduction.xhtml#rintro1fn175] Shu wen 書文 and wen shu are usedinterchangeably (TPJ 55. 85), as are le yu 樂欲 (e.g., TPJ 78.190; 204.646;208.661) and yu le (TPJ 176.515; 204.639 and 640). However, most disyllabicconcepts used in the TPJ occur only in a standard sequence, such as cheng fu 承負,di wang 帝王, junwang 君王, and zaibian 災變.176. [Introduction.xhtml#rintro1fn176] Nouns are more often monosyllabic whenused as an object than when used as the subject. Zai (disaster) occurs on itsown mainly when used as an object (see, for instance, jie zai 解災, TPJ 63.134,and zeng zai 增災, TPJ 65.152). However, disyllabic objects are also frequent.Isolated characters tend to be enlarged when they serve as subjects. So ping(peace) becomes taiping or pingqi 平氣. In other words, the use of zaibian insteadof zai, junwang instead of wang, or wenshu instead of shu seems to be forrhetorical rather than semantic reasons.177. [Introduction.xhtml#rintro1fn177] See Zuercher 1977: 181. For xiang yu 才目與,see TPJ 41.35 and 59.100; for yu gong 與共 see TPJ 61.113 and 122. In addition tothe compounds yifu 亦復 (TPJ 55.85; 217.328; 186.569, layer B) and haifu 還復 (TPJ50.65) mentioned by Zuercher, fanfu 反復, fuzhong 復重, zhongfu 重復, and fugeng 復更are often used as adverbial compounds, in layer A as well as in layer B.Inclusive adverbial compounds are used frequently. Zuercher lists xidou 悉都 (TPJ132.356), xijin 悉盡 (TPJ 165.460), and jinxi 盡悉 (TPJ 204.632). Xi is the mostfrequently used inclusive adverbial and occurs in a large variety of compounds.Moreover, the TPJ makes frequent use of ju, as in xiju 悉 具 (TPJ 188.577). It ischaracteristic of the TPJ to have trisyllabic inclusive adverbial compounds, asin xijudou 悉 具 都 (TPJ 55.86; qie 且 is corrected to ju) and xidouhe 悉都合 (TPJ78.191).Zhe 者 is used as final particle, as described by Zuercher for his material.Although in much of the text its occurrence agrees with classical usage, it canalso serve as a final element in a conditional subordinate clause, as, forinstance, in TPJ 42.38: Ling shi tu di you bu hua sheng zhe 令使土地有不化生者.The number of interrogative pronouns and adverbs is limited. The particle he 何and combinations with he abound; yunhe 云何 is used frequently as an interrogativein all layers of the text.178. [Introduction.xhtml#rintro1fn178] See TPJ 166.462; 176.515.179. [Introduction.xhtml#rintro1fn179] There are more examples of the TPJ’srelative conservatism: yu 於 is mainly used in a postverbal position to expressdirection, and zuo 作 is used only rarely and only as the full verb “to act, todo, to make.” There is, however, at least one instance of an enclitic zi 子 (TPJ65.148), as opposed to the Buddhist translations and classical usage. Encliticgu 故 occurs, but only in classical form as far as I can see (for instance, theuse of bu de hui guo fan gu ye 不得悔過反故也, TPJ 66.160).180. [Introduction.xhtml#rintro1fn180] See, for instance, passages in YangXiong’s (53 B.C.E.–18 C.E.) Fa yan or Ge Hong’s (283–343) Baopu zi.181.

Harada Jirō (1984) arguesthat Dong Zhongshu’s ideas form the background for the TPJ’s stress on threeand, as one would expect, he points to the Yi jing for the twofold approach.183.

[chapter_01.xhtml#rch1fn1] The title of this section points to the topic ofdistinction or differentiation (fen bie 分別) that is found throughout the TPJ andhas been aptly expressed by the text’s sixth-century editors in their sectiontitles. See section 4, “The method of differentiating harm done to the body . ..” (TPJ p. 723, Chao, part 1); section 24, “The method of distinguishing betweengood and evil in men” (only in the Dunhuang list of contents, Yoshioka 1970:23); section 79, “The method of distinguishing the four types of government”(Yoshioka 1970: 29; for section “80,” TPJ p. 195); and section 97, “Instructionson how to distinguish the nine types of men” (Yoshioka 1970: 31, cf.

[chapter_01.xhtml#rch1fn4] The Master here makes use of the fact that thecharacter fu 富, which, while adequately translated as “wealth” or “rich,” can beused interchangeably with fu 福, “happiness”; cf. Morohashi 1985: no. 7230, whichquotes a Shi jing passage.5. [chapter_01.xhtml#rch1fn5] I read nian 念 for ling 令, with Yu 2001a: 41.6. [chapter_01.xhtml#rch1fn6] It is not only the Master who guides as a fatherand mother. The model established by heaven (tian fa 天法; TPJ 100.228) does aswell, and so does the wise man with respect to his neighbors (TPJ 103.246).7. [chapter_01.xhtml#rch1fn7] This ends the introduction of the discussants andtheir topic. The tone of the conversation is, on both sides, polite. The topicis chosen by the Master at the request of the student. In the following, theMaster gives wealth a utopian quality by insisting on its completeness: onlywhen nothing is missing will there be real wealth. Wealth thus becomes asociopolitical rather than an individual aim and can best be observed in thepersonal poverty of a king who reigns over a populous and therefore wealthycountry:Great Yang is afraid of great Yin. . . . For this reason it is important ingoverning a country to see that there is wealth where the population is largeand poverty and misery where it is small. (TPJ 105.264)What is here meant by wealth is the best of several types of wealth mentioned inthe Shi ji:Hence riches of the fundamentals (ben 本, that is, agriculture) are the best,riches from the secondary sector (mo 末) come next and riches gained throughcriminal acts are the very lowest (129.3272; trans. by Swann 1950: 451).The source of some of this wealth can be morally doubtful:Neither poverty nor riches as a way of life can be taken or given; the cleverhave a surplus, the stupid have not enough (129.3255; trans. by Swann 1950:422).The Shi ji elucidates this statement through biographical sketches of richpersons.The TPJ’s definition of fu, however, is not uniform, not even within layer Amaterial. Although in the passage under consideration moral aspects are seen asessential, this is not true for most of the text, which follows the commonunderstanding of the word:Some men have obtained good, rich soil as well as the produce of heaven, earth,and the harmony between them simply by chance. They pile up millions andmillions of all sorts of grain and a vast amount of jade, gold, and silver. (TPJ103.246)This is similar to the naive way in which the Guanzi, in one of its economicrather than philosophical sections, regards the reasons for individual povertyand wealth:If a man is lazy and extravagant, he will become poor; if he is industrious andfrugal, he will become rich. (Chap. 64 “Xing shi jie” 形勢解, p. 325; trans. byRickett 1985: 66)Although this directly contradicts section 41, it is repeated elsewhere in theTPJ:Should a gentleman persist in working hard, then he would become great incollecting valuables and his house would be rich and lack nothing. (TPJ 103.251)When the Master chooses to ignore the moral aspect of the acquisition of wealth,he tends to stress the moral aspect of its distribution, as, for instance, insection 103, where it is argued that you offend taiping morality not by beingwealthy, but by not allowing others to share your wealth.8. [chapter_01.xhtml#rch1fn8] For “supreme majestic qi,” see below, section 65.The passage attributes four different degrees to heaven’s influence on thegrowth of harvests. If this influence amounted to bad portents it would not becalled huang 皇, since this term is reserved for items of some positive value.9. [chapter_01.xhtml#rch1fn9] The figure twelve thousand (wan er qian), as inwan er qian wu 萬二千物, is characteristic of the TPJ. The whole world, forinstance, is called “twelve thousand countries”: “In the world there areeighty-one territories (yu 域) and twelve thousand countries” (TPJ p. 709, Chao,part 9). This is explained thus:Why are there twelve thousand countries? The figures of heaven start with oneand end with ten. Ten is multiplied by itself. Since the way of heaven turnsaround when it reaches five, this amounts to ten thousand countries. The “twothousand” are added in correspondence to Yin and Yang. Look at the followingexample: Just as the figure ten should be the end, the months of the year areonly twelve. However, in five years repeated intercalary months are insertedamong them. This corresponds to heaven and earth basically originating inheaven, in that the outside and the inside of heaven’s hollow grotto unite incorresponding fashion the figures of heaven and earth. Therefore, twelve monthscan in turn be one year only because of the intercalary month amidst them. (TPJ139.390)The starting point is one. It takes five steps—as explained by the figure fivementioned above—to get to ten thousand:The figures of heaven start with one and end with ten. One multiplied by ten isten. Each ten multiplied by ten amounts to one hundred. One hundred multipliedby ten amounts to one thousand, one thousand multiplied by ten is ten thousand.(TPJ 139.391)In another attempt, the figure twelve thousand is explained thus:This combined figure of twelve thousand countries is the same as the twelvemonths of one year, which make up one part, and the occasional thirteenthintercalary month interspersed among them. This is what it means. (TPJ 139.397)The Bai hu tong explains that two intercalary months were interspersed in fiveyears (chap. 9 “Si shi” 四時, p. 428; cf. Tjan 1949/1952: 595—96). The TPJ’sexplanation seems to be a subtle improvement on speculations put forward in theBai hu tong, which argues that twelve thousand soldiers are needed instead often thousand because the number of months in a year is twelve (chap. 5 “San jun”三軍, p. 200; cf. Tjan 1949/1952: 447). For the TPJ, the two thousand are thatextra bit that creates a real correspondence between parallel items of differentkinds. The two added to the common ten thousand “things” turns these things intoan all-inclusive totality, just as the thirteenth month guarantees that thenumber of months makes up the whole of the year, or as thirteen (instead of thefactual ten or twelve) provinces make up the country (TPJ 139.396f.). In theQian er bai guan yi (Protocols of the one thousand and two hundred officials),which Tao Hongjing quotes in Dengzhen yinjue (Concealed instructions for ascentto perfection), “two hundred” plays a similar role (see Cedzich 1993: 33;Bokenkamp 1997: 254).However, the use of figures starting with twelve rather than ten is perhapsmainly a stylistic peculiarity and does not convey much meaning. The Da zhongsong zhang (Great petition for sepulchral plaints) is another text that usesthis figure. On p. 22b it mentions a “Supreme Lord of Celestial Mystery and hisarmy of twelve thousand” (bingshi yi wan er qian ren 兵士一萬二千人, in Nickerson’s[1997: 269] translation), and smaller groups consist of 120 men.10. [chapter_01.xhtml#rch1fn10] For the Celestial Master of the TPJ, as for hisHan dynasty contemporaries, prognostication was an important tool of orientationin all matters of private and public life (see Seidel 1983: 303f). Thus he mustbe expected to argue that heaven signifies its satisfaction through portents.The “linguistic” sections give a roundabout “definition” of rui 瑞 :Rui is qing 清 (pure), jing 靜 (quiet), duan 端 (righteous), zheng 正 (upright),zhuan 專 (attentive) and yi 一 ; (one). [A rui is issued at a time] when the humanmind (xin 心) is with, rather than against, heaven and earth.I would like to know how you know that it is pure, quiet, righteous, upright,attentive, and one.This is a good question. Now from antiquity until today it has been the natureof heaven and earth that someone who was good would achieve what was good, whilesomeone who was bad would achieve what was bad, and that someone who was uprightwould achieve what was upright, while someone who was false would achieve whatwas false. This is the art of letting things be as they are (ziran 自然), andshould not give any cause for surprise. So when a man’s heart is righteous,upright, pure, and quiet his perfect sincerity (zheng 誠) moves heaven to bewithout bad intentions. Because of this, lucky portents and good harvests (ruiying shan wu 瑞應善物) will make their appearance. (TPJ 174.512f.)This explains how lucky portents are caused by certain moral (“upright,”“correct”) and religious (“pure,” “quiet”) attitudes. This assumption is basicfor the sociopolitical function of prognostication theory.11. [chapter_01.xhtml#rch1fn11] The term shan wu 善物 (crops) is used differentlyin the TPJ from how dictionaries and classical texts define it (cf. Zuo zhuan,Duke Zhao, twenty-fifth year, 51.2110a; Legge 1960: 711, “it is a good thing inpropriety . . .”), where wu has the meaning of shi (action). Wu in the TPJ termshan wu means “products” or “produce”; see below, section 65. Shan wu are sentby heaven, as are portents, with which they can be linked, as in the expressionrui ying shan wu; see the note above, and below, section 53.12. [chapter_01.xhtml#rch1fn12] The following layer B passage, which discussesthe illness and loss of life that result from offenses against heaven’scommandments, gives a vivid account of poverty:At this point [of a terminal illness] the parts of the body, which are in badshape, become short of qi and food is not digested. Family members keeping watchmight call the situation “life threatening” (nan huo 難活). A family in possessionof some money and valuables will have something laid aside. A family withoutmoney and valuables, whose possessions are exhausted and where relatives on bothsides of the family are poor, will have nothing to put forth: so when someonedies [with Long (2000: 1251) I read yi 巳 (already) for yi 以 (with)] he will beburied in the ground without being given a wooden coffin. Should they later onthrough their toils come into some money or valuables they must then remove himfrom the ground. But in a family where everyone is poor, what is valuable willbe lost and men will go away. When would they ever be reunited? When familymembers become separated, they can’t support each other. So someone without awooden coffin will turn into a demon (gui) without an inner and outer coffin andwill roam about without a home. Moreover, he won’t get any food. After death, asa demon, he will in his hunger beg for food without end. (TPJ 200.617)This passage concludes that a person must make sure to lead a proper life sothat he won’t fall ill and suffer the fate just described. What it adds tosection 41 is the observation that the suffering that comes from poverty reachesbeyond death.Thus the TPJ depicts poverty as an all-encompassing misery. Literary sources,however, tend to define poverty from a more upper-class perspective as a lack ofvaluables (see Shuo wen jie zi [p. 542b]: cai fen shao 財分少) and also as a lackof refinement, characterized by poor clothes, the lack of servants, and the needto walk rather than to travel by carriage. In a similar vein, the Yan tie lunchapter on wealth and poverty describes as “poor” the simple lifestyle of anofficial who is too honest to make commercial use of his position. While the TPJdefines poverty with more precision than as simply the absence of wealth, thereis no touch of the sentimental attitude to social polarization that prevails inlate Han social criticism, as put forward, for instance, by Wang Fu in his Qianfu lun when he accusingly lists the manifestations of wealth and argues withConfucius that “poverty is born of wealth” (Qian fu lun 12 “Fu yi” 浮侈, p. 127),as if distribution were the only economic problem.13. [chapter_01.xhtml#rch1fn13] As Luo (1996: 57) rightly suggests, er 而 must beunderstood here as neng 能, as it is often in the TPJ.14. [chapter_01.xhtml#rch1fn14] This is connected to what was said earlier onthe relationship between a country’s wealth and that of its “king,” whom we mustimagine as a Han dynasty prince, that is, as ruler over a commandery.15. [chapter_01.xhtml#rch1fn15] You shi 幽室 here is the place of meditation, ameaning that also occurs in nonreligious texts (cf. Hou Han shu 27.928).Elsewhere the TPJ uses the word in a broader sense to designate the remote,well-hidden rooms where the wealthy unjustly store their goods (TPJ 103.246).The room for meditation is also called xu wu zhi shi 虛無之室 (chamber of void andnothingness) (TPJ 168.470, layer C), an zuo you shi 安坐幽室 (dark chamber of quietsitting) (TPJ 127.322), or xian shi 閑室 (separate room) (e.g., TPJ 208.666).Later taiping material describes it as a separate, locked room behind doubleexternal and thick partition walls that ensure sounds from the outside will notreach inside (Secret Advice by the Wise Lord of the Scripture on Great Peace;see TPJ p. 740). This room is not supposed to be away from one’s family:From now on, wherein should we search dao?We should all search it in the locked room not far from father and mother andnot away from wife and children. (TPJ 208.666)Takahashi (1986: 258) argues convincingly that the Master stresses the taipingbeliever’s family links, unlike other religious groups, which praise solitudeand celibacy.16. [chapter_01.xhtml#rch1fn16] This remark attests to the TPJ’s coherence.Meditation, which is here termed zuo 坐 (to sit), is seen throughout as the mostbasic dao-inspired activity; see below, section 48, on “guarding the one.”17. [chapter_01.xhtml#rch1fn17] Such suffering is often expressed by thecharacter chou 愁, particularly in these first sections of the received text. Itis also used in this section on p. 30 (line 11) for the plight of children ofvery poor parents. In this instance, the Chao replaces chou with ri (daily) forgood reason, in that the character chou is more often applied to the politicalworries of the ruling strata than to their subjects’ suffering (see Qi 1992).18. [chapter_01.xhtml#rch1fn18] The disciple’s question redirects the discussiontoward a reformist and missionary agenda. It now becomes clear that definingwealth and poverty is done to prepare for the promise that communal wealth willbe achieved once taiping-type reforms have been implemented.19. [chapter_01.xhtml#rch1fn19] “Subtle sayings” are the most sacred utterances:see TPJ 78.190, and see the Han shu yi wen zhi (Han shu 30.1701), whereConfucius is called an originator of wei yan 微言. The term is also used formaterial distributed by the Celestial Master (TPJ 65.146). In Han dynastycommentatorial writings, “subtle sayings” referred to the classics’ supposedhidden meaning, which commentators accessed by reading between the lines, oftenwith prognostic results (Hsiao 1979: 129–32).20. [chapter_01.xhtml#rch1fn20] Sheng shen 生神 (life-giving spirits) are mostwelcome:Men with knowledge and willpower will never lose sight of the art of life. It istheir desire to act jointly together with life-giving spirits and to think inaccord with heaven. (TPJ p. 711, Chao, part 9)The term is more prominent in layer B. The above quotation is from a speechaddressed by the Celestial Lord (tian jun 天君) to the Great Spirit (da shen 大神).There is also another mention—”This is what the life-giving spirits want”—inlayer B that follows the description of well-ordered social relations (TPJ199.614).21. [chapter_01.xhtml#rch1fn21] The text reads “earth’s Yang and nourishingspirits” (di zhi yang yang shen 地之陽 養申申). Yu 2001a: 42 argues for correctingYang to Yin. Yang does not belong here. Perhaps it first entered the text as amistake for yang, meaning “to nourish,” and when this character was correctlyadded the editors forgot to take out the first, mistaken, “Yang.”22. [chapter_01.xhtml#rch1fn22] The term zhonghe 中 和 (harmony between) occursfrequently in the TPJ. In a nonspecific way it is used as zhong (medium) mightbe used. It is stated, for instance, that for the study of dao, humanity is thebeginning, virtue is of medium (zhonghe) rank, and dao is supreme (TPJ 163.456).It also takes the place of zhong in the meaning “in the middle between” (TPJ212.676). In a more specific way it is used throughout the text to transformpairs of terms into a trinity, in particular Yin and Yang and heaven and earth,and as a consequence defines the place of man. Man is the third that Yin andYang result in, being physically located between heaven and earth, and is alsotheir child, their guarantor and their future. Thus, he is also a cosmic force.This point is stressed by Lai Chi Tim (2000: 66) when he interprets zhonghe as amethod of ordering the cosmos. As the TPJ puts it:Primordial qi has three names: great Yang, great Yin, and the relationshipbetween them. . . . This relationship between the two is in charge of making theten thousand beings agree (tiao he 調 和) with each other. It is [like] a newlyborn child. Children come to life through their father and mother, their mandate(ming 命) is derived from their father, their dispensation is derived from above,and they are entrusted with life (sheng 生) by their mother. So when grieved theyturn to their lord, their father. . . . Harmony (zhonghe) must prevail betweenYin and Yang. It makes the ten thousand plants and beings grow. When the peoplelive in harmony and concord (he tiao), the king’s rule is in great peace. . . .The harmony between [Yin and Yang] gives accord to the reign of emperors andkings. With mutual agreement (tiao 調) between the ten thousand beings, each willbe well governed. (TPJ pp. 19f., Chao, part 2)The term has slightly different facets depending on what it is associated withand the argument it figures in. The above passage shows that Yin and Yang becomeeffective through zhonghe. The term is used for what they produce, the “child,”and also for their intercourse. In section 65 this trinity, as opposed to adualistic model, is assigned cosmogonic power: Yin and Yang through theirintercourse bring forth all plants and beings. This view explains the frequentusage of the phrase “Yin, Yang, and the harmony between them” instead of thesimple “Yin and Yang.” The trinity is always seen as a positive entity, as isthe family. The single character he can replace zhonghe, but the reverse doesnot often hold true. In the following, more complex, image it might not beappropriate to use zhonghe:There are always the three qi that heaven’s way consists of. The first one likesto bring to life. It is called Yang. The second enjoys letting things grow. Itis called harmony (he). The third loves to kill. It is called Yin. Heaven isappointed to give life. Man is in charge of nurture and growth. What has grownmature is meant to be killed. What has been killed is stored. Heaven, earth, andmen combine their efforts; their activities rely on each other. Without Yangthere is no life, without harmony no growth, without Yin no killing. These threerely on each other to form one family and to let all twelve thousand plants andbeings grow. (TPJ 212.675f.)In this case, the recurrence of the image of the family is not as convincing asin other examples quoted below. The passage shows the text’s characteristicambiguity, or, rather, a certain integration of different cosmological images.Since the Celestial Master’s interest does not lie in these images as such butin the moral message they convey he uses them as it suits his argument.Zhonghe also forms a trinity with heaven and earth. Since the two aremanifestations of Yang and Yin this is but another facet of the meaning justdealt with. The three are, as pointed out in section 61 (p. 113), one family:Heaven’s dao also forms a family, where the father resembles heaven, the motherearth, and the child the harmony between them. (TPJ 139.395)So in order to make the cosmos resemble family life, zhonghe is an essentialcomponent. While it is clear that in this respect man corresponds to zhonghe,details differ:The harmony in between is under the charge of man. With its help, he controlsthe four seasons and five phases. He must let them proceed harmoniously. (TPJ134.371)From what has been said so far it does not seem possible to argue that onespecific meaning of the term is reserved for certain parts of the text. Thereis, however, one more meaning that is frequently although not exclusively usedin layer B material. Zhonghe is not only a third force, which complements thatof heaven and earth, but also the space between them, the world we live in:Heaven’s light shines downward beneath the Yellow Springs, earth’s light shinesupward into heaven, the light of the space between [heaven and earth] shinesboth upward and downward in the same manner (he tong 合同). So the three lightsbecome effective through cooperation (he he 合[images/img_0003.jpg]). Heaven withits own three lights—that is, sun, moon, and stars—shines downward on the spacebetween [heaven and earth] and on earth. (TPJ 190.584, layer B)This is the place where men live:It was explained to the spirits that they must not at random oppose the childrenof the space in between, [who live] below heaven and above earth. (TPJ 187.571,layer B)This is also the place where food grows: “All twelve thousand plants grow in thesoil of the harmony between heaven and earth” (TPJ 200.615, layer B). Or, inother words:Heaven likes to share its dao with men, earth enjoys letting men participate inits virtue; the harmony between them likes to feed its goods to men. (TPJ103.248, layer A)In the passage at hand, harmony forms a triad with heaven and earth. Itsposition is, as it should be, in third place and in correspondence with man andwith humanity.23. [chapter_01.xhtml#rch1fn23] “Good men” (shan ren 善人) are not wicked:The actions of good men bring about wealth; the actions of wicked men result incalamities. (TPJ p. 732, Chao, part 1)The term is used in the Xiang’er in the same sense (10.26–29, Laozi 27;Bokenkamp 1997: 124). So shan ren are average law-abiding subjects, rankingbetween serfs and “worthy [officials]” (TPJ p. 222, Chao, part 4). In thissense, they are also the opposite of robbers and bandits (TPJ 103.250 andsection 43, passim).Up to this point, the TPJ follows common language use. The term is, however,also used in a more specific sense. The “good men” follow the moral rulesproclaimed by the Celestial Master and may thus be selected by heaven to fulfillspecific tasks (TPJ 207.653; 208.659; and below, 56.90). Thus the term precedesthe “seed people” (cf. Bokenkamp 1997: 3), who are chosen to be exempted fromthe apocalypse. As Petersen (1990b: 34) points out, the term is particularlyfrequent in layer B material, which introduces the concept of a “supreme goodman” (shang shan ren 上善人). The disciple whom the Great Spirit presents to theCelestial Lord (TPJ 182.551) is said to deserve this epithet:The supreme good man acts in such a way that he knows in advance about theexternal and internal [movements of] heaven and earth, appears and withdraws asYin and Yang do, takes their [practice] as his guideline (dao qi gang ji 道其綱紀),ponders over them in his thoughts and does not put aside the order they provide.(TPJ 182.549, layer B)This is a subtle way of action. The less advanced “good man” does not have thesame level of sophistication: he obeys heaven’s rules and is rewarded bylongevity (section 203 passim, layer B).As opposed to terms like dongji 洞極 and cheng fu 承負, which were newly created forthe purposes of taiping missionary work, shan ren goes back to the Lun yu(7.26), where commentators equate it with “gentleman” (junzi 君子), that is, withthe man of excellent moral bearing. While throughout layer A it occurs with thismeaning, that is, pointing to an excellent follower of the taiping doctrine anda believer in heaven, it also refers to a regular good person who has done noharm. As the usage of the term in section 43 attests, the two meanings are notmeant to be kept apart.24. [chapter_01.xhtml#rch1fn24] This is the correct hierarchical relationshipbetween dao and heaven, although this use of the term dao is rare in the TPJ,which does not stress the point that heaven gets its rules from elsewhere. Theorder at the cosmos’s top is thus: “heaven stands in awe of dao, dao stands inawe of what is as it is (ziran 自然)” (TPJ p. 701, Chao, part 9). This order isbased on cosmogonic sequence (TPJ 139.392; p. 305, Chao, part 5). Since heavenis often one of two, that is, part of “heaven and earth,” cosmogonic listsrarely place it at the top. What heaven and dao have in common is the power togive and to preserve life: “heaven likes to give life and so does dao. Thus daois heaven’s principle (tian jing 天經)” (TPJ p. 308, in a Yaoxiu keyi jielüchao—an eighth-century Daoist ritual compendium—quotation). What is, however, ofmore interest to the Celestial Master than such ontological concerns is thefollowing practice-oriented relationship between dao, as principle of action,and “heaven,” as the sky above us: “In the past as well as today every man whopractices dao takes his model from majestic heaven” (TPJ 208.654).25. [chapter_01.xhtml#rch1fn25] Governments are commonly listed in a certainhierarchical or chronological order according to their moral value.Chronological order entails hierarchical structuring, as, for instance, in theLaozi (38) and in Huainan zi 8 “Ben jing” 本經, pp. 4b–5b, where government by daoand virtue, by benevolence, by propriety, and so on are described, the intentionbeing to stress the major distinction between government by action and that bynonaction and to define improvement as the gradual returning to a previousstage.The text contains another, more detailed, list of ten methods of governing (TPJ103.253f.). These ten methods (indicated in italics) are shown below injuxtaposition with the section 41 list:1. dao—sufficient wealth—heaven—superior ruler1. primordial qi—heaven—prognostic writings2. what is as it is (ziran)—earth—prognostic writings2. virtue—half-sized wealth—earth—medium ruler3. dao—men—prognostic writings4. virtue—chapter and verse commentaries3. benevolence—small wealth—men—ruler of lower rank5. benevolence—chapter and verse commentaries6. propriety—distorted writings4. culture—small disorder—deceit—ruler over disorder7. ritual—distorted writings8. culture—distorted writings5. military—lawlessness—punishments—ill-omened ruler9. law (fa)—distorted writings10. military—distorted writingsThe two lists have in common a contempt for wen 文, here “ceremonial, decorum” inMax Kaltenmark’s (1979: 30) understanding, and for wu 武, “military endeavors,”which resembles the traditional quietist outlook presented in the Huainan zi(8.3b–4a). The second list stresses yuan qi, the primordial vapor, which ranksfirst from a cosmogonic point of view (cf. Asano 1982: 7, based on TPJ 139.392;212.676) and is thus given a higher metaphysical and moral ranking than dao. Thepassage in section 103 ranks texts highly (cf. Hachiya 1983), arguing that goodDaoist government, which is concerned with life, is characterized by theprevalence of sacred prognostic text, that medium-style government stresses thecommentatorial tradition (zhang ju 章句), and that with all other governmentwritings become distorted.For the passage at hand, the list of governments enhances the social andcommunal definition of wealth in that wealth is said to accompany a well-orderedsociety. The Han dynasty state in its ideal form is positioned at stage three.It is said to be dominated by the value of humanity, the creation ofcommentaries, and a man-centered reign.26. [chapter_01.xhtml#rch1fn26] The repetitiveness in this passage stems fromthe attempt to provide some exemplification, which can hardly be done in the TPJstyle of writing, that is, without giving names of rulers and other historicaldetails.27. [chapter_01.xhtml#rch1fn27] The disciple attempts to present an argumentagainst the Master’s narrow definition of “rich.” Wang Ming does not signify achange of speakers.28. [chapter_01.xhtml#rch1fn28] This observation is repeated (TPJ 43.39) andgoes back at least to Huainan zi 13 “Fan lun”见論, p. 20a, where it is argued thateven Yao and Shun were not perfect in moral respects and that for this reasonmoral perfection was impossible to achieve.29. [chapter_01.xhtml#rch1fn29] For the TPJ, the world’s central region consistsof eighty-one territories (yu 域). The division into nine continents (jiu zhou九州) is mentioned only once in the TPJ (TPJ 127.317), while the Lun heng, forinstance, stresses that China is one of nine, not eighty-one, territories (chap.31 “Tan tian” 談天, p. 480), as Zou Yan had supposedly argued (see Shi ji 74.2344;see also Needham 1956: 236). The following passages seem to suggest that Chineseinfluence reached all these territories and that China itself, being more than a“country,” consisted of more than one “territory”:When the good, worthy, and wise among the four barbarian tribes and in theeighty-one territories hear that China (zhongguo 中國) has a ruler of great virtuewho governs like this, they will all wish to come to submit themselves. (TPJ129.333)The following passage outlines the world’s size in order to explain that atdifferent places the sky’s phenomena are seen differently, just as theobservers’ moral condition differs:The world has sun, moon, and the pole star in common. It consists altogether oftwelve thousand countries. The central part (zhong bu 中部) has eighty-oneterritories, divided into small parts that each make up one country. Those withplenty of virtue and excellence are twelve thousand miles (li 里) in size, thenext is ten thousand miles from east to west and from north to south, the nextis nine thousand, and so on, to one thousand and then five hundred and onehundred miles. (TPJ 134.368)The intention of this passage is to stress the independence of countries inorder to show that their fates differ in accordance with the morality of theirrespective governments. This world is large, considering that the thirteenfigures given for countries of different moral rectitude alone would amount to67,600 li and that there has to be room for 12,000 countries. The Huainan zi(4.2b), for instance, gives a figure of 233,500 li plus 75 “paces” (bu 步) as thesize of the world (cf. Major’s 1993: 147–49 discussion of the issue). Throughwrong computation, as Forke argues (1962, vol. 1, p. 256), Wang Chong (Lun heng31 “Tan tian” 談天, p. 480–82) arrives at a figure of one million li.However, the Celestial Master is not concerned with these details. What mattersis the fact that countries are the place where taiping reforms must beintroduced:I would like to know how many countries there are all together in the world. . ..All right. The central part has eighty-one territories; beyond this there isagain one circle (zhou 周).The world has ten thousand countries, but in thedistance it runs into the void grotto, which has no exterior. The three areas[the eighty-one territories, the circle around them, and the rest] together arethe twelve thousand countries. (TPJ 139.389f.)This modifies the account given in section 134, as quoted above, but does notcontradict it. Again, as pointed out with regard to the “twelve thousand plants,beings, and things,” the extra two thousand are meant to define the total,including countries beyond the inner and perhaps even the outer circle.The administrative division of these “countries” (guo 國) resembles that of anidealized Han dynasty empire judging by the following passage, which deals withthe similarity between a family and a large state:The father acts as the ruler, the mother as an official, the children as thepeople. What they own they share with each other and make it grow, as, forinstance, their crops. In such a family, all share the same major concern.Although there are ten thousand households in one county (xian 縣; this is itsofficial size; see Bielenstein 1980: 101), they also constitute one family andshare the same major concern. The same holds true for the ten counties, whichmake up one commandery (jun 郡), the ten commanderies, which make up one bigprovince (da zhou 大州), and the ten provinces, which together form one bigcountry (da guo 大國) but still constitute one big family, which shares the sameconcern. It is all surrounded by one identical border (jie 界). Should theiremperor or king have virtue, his concern would reach the twelve provinces, andif this concern were great, it would reach all thirteen provinces, and yet theywould all constitute one big family and share one major concern. The distantregions outside the border do not belong to the countries of men (ren guo人國).When the countries of men possess dao and virtue, the good who live in thosedistant regions will come. When this is not the case, they will not come. Shouldvirtue be lacking among men, the people from the outside regions would come toharm them. This is all one coherent area with only the one border that is thedividing line between heaven and earth. . . . One county, one commandery, oneprovince, one country, they all mean the same: they share the same majorconcern. That I now report on all twelve thousand countries as [if they were]one big area is to let you know, Perfected, that they are cause for oneidentical concern and have one identical border in common. The rest is likethese twelve thousand countries and too much for detailed reporting. For thisreason the wise men of old wrote only about one small part.Why did they not report on the larger area as a whole?Heaven’s emissary (tian shi 天使) had not spoken; the great mission (da hua 大化)had not begun. Men differed in their actions. They did not have one identicalmodel. Therefore, they did not report [on the world as a whole]. Since today thegreat mission has started, all twelve thousand countries are linked together.(TPJ 139.395f.; for the additional occurrence of commune [ting 亭] and hamlet [li里], see TPJ 127.314; for xiang 鄉 [district], see section 61)So the TPJ takes into account an administrative division into hamlets, communes,counties, commanderies, and provinces (both commanderies and provinces were guo[country] when an imperial relative was in charge; cf. Bielenstein 1986: 506ff.)but surpasses this division toward a worldwide missionary approach. The layoutof the world resembles the generally accepted gai tian theory (cf. Needham 1959:210f.), but what is striking is that the aspect of surrounding water iscompletely missing. Zou Yan, for instance, knew of a “great ocean” (Shi ji74.2344). Instead, there is only the horizon and beyond that the “void grotto”(TPJ 139.390) as the external limit.For the passage at hand, the mention of all countries (“eighty-one territories”)acts as a reminder that taiping concerns were global.30. [chapter_01.xhtml#rch1fn30] This usage of wen 文 is more common in the TPJthan is the pejorative “decorum.” Wen means “pattern,” “constellation,” and“text”:On meeting a worthy, why should one grant him texts [as one grants food to thehungry and clothes to a person who is cold]?Consider the reason for granting texts (wen). Wen (patterns) originate in theeast and shine in the south. So through celestial patterns (tian wen 天文) thatoriginate in the northeast—and a book (shu 書) that has come out in thenortheast—heaven makes its designs known. “Tiger” [this is, the white tigertaking up the western sky] is a pattern (wen 文) with its home in yin 寅 [thethird earthly branch]. “Dragon” [the green dragon of the eastern sky] is apattern, with its home in chen 辰 [the fifth branch]. Turning its back, it movesup into the sky and brightness li 離, the thirtieth hexagram] decorates thesouth. Of the three heavenly bodies that create patterns (wen), the sun givesmost light. So patterns originate in the east and become mature in the south, asthe sun rises in the east and becomes mature in the south. Heaven demands ofemperors and kings that they set up a model in imitation (xiang 象) of heaven. Sothey must grant texts in order to promote the great Yang, that is, the phase offire (with Luo 1996: 390) and intensively promote fire in order to distinguishbetween what texts call right and wrong. What texts report is indeed what isright and what is wrong in this world. (TPJ 100.228f.)The disciple also raises the question as to which texts the worthies should begranted. The Master responds that it should be the celestial scripture (tianjing 天經), created by the Perfected through collating the best (da shan 大善) textson true dao from old, middle, and lower antiquity. The gist of this passage, ifI read it correctly, is interesting: texts are for the sovereign whatastronomical phenomena are for heaven, that is, the main tool of instruction.Moreover, texts are also the main channel of communication between heaven andmen. This is stressed in the following passage:When heaven wants prosperity, it provides lucky portents, patterned stones (wenqi 文绮), and books, and it makes sure that they are generally understood andreceived. When it wants decay, it conceals these texts or arranges that nobodywants to look for them. (TPJ 79.198)So texts are a means, if not the means, of salvation. As soon as all false textshave been exterminated, the evil that has been inherited and passed on throughthe ages will vanish and great peace will arrive (TPJ 152.416).31. [chapter_01.xhtml#rch1fn31] The Master “analyzes” the phrase shang huangtaiping 上皇太平 in section 65.32. [chapter_01.xhtml#rch1fn32] This passage prepares for the start of a newsubject. However, poverty and the necessities of life remain issues ofdiscussion.33. [chapter_01.xhtml#rch1fn33] This is generally accepted; see, for instance,Huainan zi 3 “Tian wen” 天文, pp. 15b–16a. In this section, speculation on thelines of Yin-Yang correlation takes the place of concrete argumentation, whilethis correlation is not itself a topic for discussion. That the world is dividedinto the two forces (cf. TPJ p. 728, Chao, part 1) is the background for thepassage at hand. However, when this division is evaluated, Yin is usually seenas covering the less desirable areas: punishment as opposed to virtue (TPJ101.231 or 60.110f.) and death as opposed to life (TPJ p. 12, Chao, part 2, orsection 60 as above). Yin is also identified with those in inferior positions,such as the moon and stars, as opposed to the sun, and the official as opposedto the ruler (TPJ p. 220, Chao, part 4). This view of the two entities of Yinand Yang leads to the pragmatic, but cosmologically doubtful, conclusion thatYin must be kept in check because its increase would be detrimental: subjectswould not be loyal (TPJ 101.231) and disease might occur (TPJ 135.378). Variousactivities understood to increase Yin are therefore called obnoxious, includingthe drinking of alcohol (TPJ 105.270) and luxurious burial rites (TPJ 46.49).The contradiction between the first and second views attests to theargumentative position of the “Yin–Yang correlation.” It is a rhetorical tool;it helps to market and defend a supposition, but suppositions are not foundedupon it. Instead, a supposition might be founded on the contradiction betweenlife and death, for instance, leading in consequence to the demand for reducingburials as well as abolishing female infanticide. That the first must be called“reducing the Yin” and the second “increasing it” does not seem to cause aproblem for the Celestial Master.34. [chapter_01.xhtml#rch1fn34] Zei hai sha 戎害 焚 occurs only here; othercombinations of these characters abound, in particular zei hai and zei sha; zeisha shang 傷 is another option. The difference lies in rhetorical effect, not inmeaning.35. [chapter_01.xhtml#rch1fn35] This accords with Confucius’s point of view, atleast according to one way in which the Lun yu (10.12) passage about theMaster’s inquiry after the burning of stables can be read. His main concern isthe loss of human life.36. [chapter_01.xhtml#rch1fn36] Jiu 替 is often an offense involving heaven (TPJ60.111), as opposed to yang 殃, which means the same in regard to earth (TPJ58.95). This accords with the use of yang for offenses committed by or in regardto the dead (see Seidel 1985: 168).37. Cf. Laozi 57: “When I [that is, the sage] don’t have any business, thepeople will of themselves become rich.”38. [chapter_01.xhtml#rch1fn38] These introductory remarks are long, and theirgravity adds weight to the ensuing discussion. Only here is it mentioned thatthe students’ note taking will prolong the student’ lives. We may assume thatthe note taking actually took place. The Master reminds students about takingnotes as if to suggest that a lecture is about to begin. Sections 43, 55, 63,67, 105, 107, 108, and 156 include such a warning toward their beginning; othersections include it in the middle, as here, to signal a change of topic (63.138;65.148; 139.391 and 393); and others still (65, 78, 133, 139, and 152) includeit at the end, in a hortatory function.39. [chapter_01.xhtml#rch1fn39] In the TPJ, the “Controller of Fate” (si ming司命) is in the first place a deity residing in a person’s body and supervisingthe moral behavior of his charge:Therefore, it is said that the Controller of Fate is in the chest next to theheart. In close proximity, he observes (si 司) the right and the wrong thingsthat a person does. When there is a fault he abruptly retires —why should hewaste time?—and thereby abruptly reduces the years of a man’s life. (TPJ195.600, layer B)All corporeal deities endanger a man by leaving him (TPJ pp. 27f., in a TPJcitation of the Sandong zhunang 1 “Jiao dao pin” 教道品, giving “TPJ 33” as itssource; cf. Tanaka 1984: 292). The Controller of Fate is also depicted as anindependent deity who keeps accounts and offers reports on them when asked to doso by the Celestial Lord (tian jun 天君), who then passes his verdict (TPJ p. 214,Chao, part 4). This second image is not necessarily distinct from the corporealpresence of the deity. The deity is well known enough to also appear in afigurative sense: man is said to be the Controller of Fate for the domesticanimals (TPJ 137.383; cf. Espesset 2002b: 16), and the county head is seen asController of Fate for the people (TPJ p. 699, Chao, part 8). The deity’sfunction is closely related to that of the “Controller of Time” (si hou 司候) inthe text’s layer B astronomical chapters (see Penny 1990; cf. Espesset 2002b:27f.), whose accounts determine the length of one’s life. He is said to residein the Constellation Room (fang 房), which was supposed to act as the heavenlyequivalent of the Hall of Light (ming tang 明堂) and to keep lists of a man’sessential data, in particular the time of birth, which was thought topredetermine the course and length of someone’s life (TPJ 181.547). Thus sihou’s bookkeeping differs from the moral supervision exercised by si ming.40. [chapter_01.xhtml#rch1fn40] TPJ p. 707, Chao, part 9 discusses the san tong三統 (three dispensations) in a form close to the calendrical speculations aboutthe “three orders” in the Bai hu tong 8 “San zheng” 三 正, pp. 360-64; cf. Tjan1949/1952: 548-52. However, most of the time the term tong is used in a lessspecific sense, just as if using tian tong instead of tian would remind readersof the fact that heaven is a cosmological entity. This is similar to the use ofqi, which is added to abstract terms such as taiping for the sake of clarity;whether the character qi is added or not, peace can be imagined only in the formof qi. However, nonabstract terms can thus be made abstract, as, for instance,in the term wang qi 王 氣, which could be rendered as “kingliness” (TPJ p. 304,Chao, part 5). Thus terms are attributed their full argumentative value byadjuncts like qi or tong:Primordial qi (yuan qi 元氣), the obscure (huang hu 恍惚), and what is as it is(ziran 自然) froze into one, which was called heaven. It split and on giving lifeto Yin produced earth, which was called two. Based on heaven above and earthbelow, Yin and Yang expanding into each other gave life to man, who was calledthree. These three dispensations jointly gave life to and raised all plants andbeings, which were all called goods (cai 財).(TPJ p. 305, Chao, part 5)Discussion of the interrelationship of the three tong pervades much of the TPJ:Now the three dispensations of heaven, earth, and man are set up dependent oneach other and reach perfection by shaping each other’s appearance (cf. Laozi2). A man, for instance, has a head, feet, and a belly. If one dispensation werein distress, all three would come to ruin. This is just as if a man were withouthead or feet or belly: with one gone all three would be doomed. So when man ingrand fashion (da dao 大道) opposes heaven and earth, all three will perish. (TPJ134.373)However, often enough the plain terms heaven, earth, and men seem to suffice toexpress the full cosmological meaning.The issue of political legitimacy, and in consequence historiographic reasoning,which often accompanies the use of the term tong, is not thematized in the TPJ.41. [chapter_01.xhtml#rch1fn41] The comparisons are striking: for a womanmarriage is equivalent to the office held by a scholar. It also means that a mancannot manage any better without the support of a wife than a ruler can withoutthe help of his officials.42. [chapter_01.xhtml#rch1fn42] Ru 汝 (you) is erroneous and must be replaced bynü 女(woman).43. [chapter_01.xhtml#rch1fn43] Da ni 大 逆 and wu dao 無道 are Han dynasty legalterms (cf. Wakae 1982); wu dao can be used as bu dao 無道. Both terms point toantigovernment activities; see below, section 63.44. [chapter_01.xhtml#rch1fn44] This is not a common topic in Chinese literatureand thought. An exception is the moving description of infanticide given by YanZhitui (531-91) in his Yan shi jia xun 5 “Zhi jia” 治家, p. 51 (cf. Teng 1968:20).45. [chapter_01.xhtml#rch1fn45] Yuan jie 冤結 (grief-stricken) seems to occurfirst in the Chu ci (“Jiu zhang” 九章 4.38a, trans. Hawkes 1959: 77), where itdescribes a woman’s undefined sadness. Throughout the text the character yuan (冤grievance) is also used in the meaning of yuan (怨 resentment). Yuan jie as wellas yuan (冤 and 怨) often indicate the resentment felt by those who see themselvesas maltreated and as suffering without cause. This resentment, which reachesbeyond death, amounts to a major cosmic force because it stimulates heaven tocause disaster. The term is used in arguments against the severity ofpunishments, as, for instance, in Xiang Kai’s memorial, where it occurs severaltimes (Hou Han shu 30B.1077 [yuan 冤 only], pp. 1078 and 1081). The CelestialMaster contrasts such grief and resentment with a correct understanding of thetrue origins of suffering, which lie, as he explains, in evil inherited fromprevious generations (see also sections 48 and 65, below).46. [chapter_01.xhtml#rch1fn46] Two characters are missing here, and the text isdifficult to reconstruct. One might suspect that more than two characters havebeen lost, since the paragraph that follows seems disconnected. The phrase zhongzhi 重 知 is often preceded by zi yu 欲子 (If you want to know more about it, [I amtelling you. . . ]), a phrase that usually introduces another point in theargumentation (TPJ 99.226; 134.369 [twice]; 134.373 and 375; 139.393; 152.414;155.435; 160.450; 174.513). I have added yu zi 欲子 (I want you . . .), but thereis no parallel for this phrase. Yu 2001a: 46 reads the two missing characters asfan fu 反復 (again).47. [chapter_01.xhtml#rch1fn47] To kill one’s child was against the law in Hantimes; see Hulsewe 1955: 88f. and Kinney 1993: 108–13. Nevertheless, infanticidewas widely practiced, often by abandonment. There are so few known instances ofcriticism of infanticide that it seems appealing to link these instances, allfrom the Western Han dynasty, with the theory put forward in the TPJ. Thebest-known opponent of infanticide was the antieunuch partisan Jia Biao 賈彪. Hewas from Yingchuan 類川 commandery (in the center of present-day Henan) and issaid to have taken as his model the famous politician and intellectual XunShuang (128–90), whose home was in the same commandery. After several minorpostings, Jia became prefect of Xinxi 新息 in Runan 汝南 commandery (in thesoutheast of present-day Henan). He died, probably in 168 C.E., because herefused to go into hiding when the anti-Party prosecutions broke out. Hisbiography includes the following report on his rule over Xinxi:The small folk were miserable and poor. Many did not bring up their children.Jia Biao strictly ruled this to be the same crime as murder. South of the townthere were outlaws who caused harm to people, and north of the town there was awoman who had killed her child. When Jia Biao announced an investigation and theofficials all wished to turn to the south, he said angrily: “When outlaws damagepeople, this follows a constant principle. When mother and children injure eachother this opposes heaven and runs counter to the way (dao).” Therefore, hedrove his carriage northward to investigate the crime. When the robbers south ofthe town heard about it, they came to accuse themselves, their hands fastened attheir backs. Over the course of some years, men thus raised thousands ofchildren. They all said: “We were brought up by father Jia.” Newborn males werenamed “sons of Jia,” and newborn females were named “daughters of Jia.” (Hou Hanshu 67.2216)The explanation given by Jia for his interference seems to have been moralrather than cosmological, but the usage of the terms heaven and dao isnevertheless the same as in the TPJ.For two other instances of legislation against infanticide we have noexplanation of the official’s motive. Wang Ji 王吉, adopted son of the eunuchleader Wang Fu 王甫, became chancellor of the state of Pei 沛 (in the northern halfof present-day Anhui) when he was only twenty years old. In 179, he ended up inprison due to his father’s political fall and death. He is considered to havebeen a harsh official. His biography states, “When someone gave birth tochildren and did not raise them he had father and mother beheaded” (Hou Han shu77.2501). In the third instance nothing seems to be known about the officialexcept for his name, and the event cannot be dated:Zong Qing [images/img_0005.jpg] 慶 was governor (tai shou 太守) of Changsha 長 沙 [acommandery in central Hunan]. Since people often did not have sufficientclothing and food, they did not raise those they had borne. Qing urgentlypressed the local thrice venerable (san lao 三老) to prevent the people fromkilling their children. Over the course of these years, more than three thousandchildren were reared by the people. Boys and girls alike all bore the name Zong.(See the citation of Xie Cheng’s 言射承 lost text Hou Han shu by Yu Shinan 虞世南[early Tang] in his Bei tang shu chao 北堂書鈔, ed. Qi jia Hou Han shu 7.6a, on pp.205f.)Since the author of this report served as commandant of Changsha in the Sanguostate of Wu, this information might have come from quite reliable local sources.There is only one other mention of the issue in the TPJ. This is the seventeenthof nineteen commandments:If you want to prevent men from killing and maltreating women, you must makesure that each of them in her place works for clothes and food as well as shecan. Don’t allow her to be so perverse (da ni 大 逆 ) as to make her parentssuffer (chou 愁). (TPJ 108.512)In her account of infanticide, Kinney (1993: 116f.) stresses the point thateconomic hardship was often seen as the main obstacle in raising a child. TheHan shi wai zhuan (3.6a) stated that in times of great peace infants would notbe abandoned.48. [chapter_01.xhtml#rch1fn48] The world’s misery is the result not only ofpresent-day trespassing but also of man’s continuing misdemeanors ever since hewas created. Cheng fu 承負 (to inherit and to transmit) is the term for themeasure of evil that humankind is thus burdened with (see below, section 48).49. [chapter_01.xhtml#rch1fn49] Not to have children was considered a seriouscrime; see below, section 42.50. [chapter_01.xhtml#rch1fn50] The term shi lei 世類 (worldlings) for humankind(as used in Han shu 41.2089) is specific to the TPJ; see, for instance, TPJ42.37; 134.373. Yü Ying-shih (1964: 86) quotes this passage to illustrate theesteem with which early Daoist believers held life, manifested in particular, ashe sees it, in the TPJ and the Xiang’er.51. [chapter_01.xhtml#rch1fn51] The “seven regents” and “three luminaries” referto almost the same objects: the sun, moon, and five planets (seven), or the sun,moon, and stars (three). The second, better-known expression could be a glossinserted in the text to explain the first.52. [chapter_01.xhtml#rch1fn52] So the “wise men” (sheng ren 聖人) are experts onmicrocosmic-macrocosmic relations:Therefore, the wise man teaches not to rely on bridle and whip but establisheshis doctrine by following the nature of what is as it is. (TPJ p. 725, Chao,part 1)In earlier texts, such as the Huainan zi, the sheng ren is a personage ofhighest wisdom, but the figure underwent a certain devaluation. In a highlyformalistic TPJ passage, sheng ren comes only fifth in a list of nine ranks. Heis said to model himself after the harmonious cooperation between Yin and Yangand all the plants and creatures (TPJ p. 221, Chao, part 4). The sphere of Yinand Yang is often seen as his field: “Therefore the wise man knows how toassemble Yin and Yang, and the worthy organizes what is crooked and what isstraight” (TPJ 179.525). We must expect, then, that the sheng ren is expert insexual matters. He is capable of serving in government (“to rule over the onehundred surnames”), assisted by the worthy (xian ren 賢人; TPJ 108.289), who fillsthe sixth rank. The wise and the worthy are often mentioned together (cf.Takahashi 1984: 308f.).53. [chapter_01.xhtml#rch1fn53] The summary says:This section distinguishes and explains poverty and wealth, and how the conductof lords and kings creates auspicious conditions. It warns men not to cut offearth’s dispensation. By making both men and women thrive, the king’s reign isat peace.SECTION 42. ONE MAN AND TWO WOMEN1. [chapter_02.xhtml#rch2fn1] See Harper 1987: 541 and 548.2. [chapter_02.xhtml#rch2fn2] The TPJ’s method of argumentation generallyentails following a single line of reasoning and almost always precludeshistorical references. If this were not true the TPJ might have mentioned thetwo daughters of Yao whom Shun married and thus reminded readers that itscontent is more conservative than its novel presentation would suggest.3. [chapter_02.xhtml#rch2fn3] The mood is hypothetical. Great peace is about toarrive, as the Master asserts in the second half of this section, but it has notyet done so. However, the dialogues between Master and disciples take place in astate of excited expectation. When they hear the Master speak the disciples showtheir appreciation by exclaiming that they feel that great peace has alreadyarrived (TPJ 63.134; 109.291; 152.416), and the Master suggests that he feelsthe same way when a disciple makes a correct response (TPJ 79.196). Theimminence of the arrival of great peace is the reason behind the disciples’eagerness (TPJ 61.125). They raise questions to allow the truth to come out andmen to be prepared. The arrival of shang huang taiping qi 上皇太平氣 is said to be amost joyful occasion (TPJ 50.68). A condition for this arrival is “using bothhands,” or the cooperation between different actors, such as between sovereignand official, husband and wife, or master and disciple (TPJ 177.519). Thepromise of great peace’s imminent arrival is a major component of the missionaryagenda. Once it has come:one must join forces with the virtuous lord and not be so irresponsible as tocause damage and injury, or else qi of great peace will be in disarray and thereign in trouble. (TPJ 137.385)The arrival of the Master, the teaching sessions, and the reform program are allgeared toward preparing the world for the advent of heaven-sent great peace:Once qi of great peace has arrived, peace will reign forever, and never againwill men be lead into death and ruin. (TPJ 134.373)The text stresses different aspects of this process depending on the occasion.The preparations for the arrival of great peace, the effects of its presence,and how to ensure them are all thematized. One passage stands out because of theuncommon precision with which it addresses these issues and the inclusion of asubjacent promotion of spirit worship:I would like to ask something.Go ahead.If heaven were about to [send] great peace, would we be able to have advanceknowledge of it?Well, from the fact that qi [, which represents] heaven’s five imperial spirits,is in great peace, one can know in advance that this particular year is about toenjoy peace.What do you mean? I would like to know.Well, in spring, qi of the blue emperor’s spirit should be in great peace, insummer that of the red emperor’s spirit; in the sixth month it is the yellowemperor’s spirit, in autumn the white emperor’s spirit, and in winter the blackemperor’s.The Master explains that this means there is neither injury nor damage to thegrowth of plants. He concludes:The supreme wise men of the past clearly saw whether qi [representing] the fiveimperial spirits was at peace. So they knew instantly whether a reign was to besuccessful or a failure and whether peace was imminent. Perhaps you don’t thinkso?I would like to be instructed about “peace:Well, that everything comes to life in spring without injury is the blueemperor’s great peace, that it grows in summer without any fault is the redemperor’s great peace, and that it is nourished without fail in the sixth monthis due to the great peace that the yellow emperor provides. The white emperor’speace ensures that everything is harvested in autumn without damage, and theblack emperor’s great peace means that the harvest is safely stored in winter.After the five emperors have been in great peace for one year, men happily tryto do good (shun shan 順善). After two years like this, there is great joy onearth. After three years, mercy and generosity fill heaven. After four years,the winds (feng qi 風氣) are advantageous. After five years, the nine spiritsdon’t contend, so natural calamities and other evils are subdued. After sixyears the six relationships [I understand liu gang 六綱 with the Chao as liu ji 六紀are seen everywhere in their correct form. After seven years, the threeluminaries shine more brightly. After eight years, mercy spreads to the eightdirections. After nine years Yin and Yang are fond of each other. And after tenyears the ten thousand plants and beings are in place. [In the figure ten] allfigures come to a certain conclusion.In objects three is combined with ten, and if heaven, earth, and men areprepared, there will be great peace in thirty years. Should highest majestic qicome forth and the true doctrine (dao) be implemented, great peace could beachieved in fifteen years. If one doesn’t work hard following the true doctrine,how can one ever dream of achieving great peace? When we say that great peacemay come in fifteen years we suppose that from emperor and kings down to greatand small officials everyone follows the true doctrine and does away with eviland deceit. In this way will peace come after fifteen years. Do you understand?So if you want to know whether great peace is about to arrive or not you mustmerely observe whether the five emperors’ spirits are at peace or not. This isclear enough. It should enable you to find out for yourself. In this way, allsymptoms can first be detected in celestial spirits. Should these spirits not beat peace, how will men be able to find peace? . . . Now since heaven’sfirst-ranking supreme qi of peace is about to arrive I advise you to honor thefour seasons and five phases and to let everybody, great and small, promote theaffairs of these spirits. In the past, men respectfully observed only the fourseasons and five elements to make great peace arrive. Therefore, it moved slowlyand would take thirty years to come. Since nowadays we also serve these spirits,peace will come fast, in fifteen years. Do you understand? (TPJ 140.398-400)The time frame established in this passage agrees with the Master’s promises.The whole process, through the combined efforts of heaven and men, is expectedto take thirty years, or one generation, which would thus allow the children ofthe current generation of believers to reap the benefits. There is, moreover,the promise that proper ritual attention to certain spirits, probably the ninespirits (that is, those linked to the five phases and another four representingthe four elements; see also TPJ 105.262), would reduce the whole reform processto fifteen years, which was perhaps, if we follow historical sources, theaverage length of large Han dynasty mass movements. It brings enjoyment of thegood times within reach of the believers who initiated the movement.See also sections 63 and 66, below, on the relationship between qi of peace andthe actual establishment of a taiping reign.4. [chapter_02.xhtml#rch2fn4] The word zhen 貞 (chaste) is used by the Master anddisciples to mean lifelong sexual abstinence. This is a specific use of theword, and it is surprising that the disciple doesn’t need to ascertain what theMaster means but instead understands right away. In general, zhen means “chaste”or “modest” (it is also adequately rendered as “persistent” by Wilhelm 1972:130; hexagram 32) and is considered a female virtue. It relates to a woman’sbearing, and particularly to the way she behaves toward men; the Yi jing(hexagram 32, p. 21) says zhen is lucky in a woman and unlucky in a man. Thecharacter is rendered as “chaste” by most interpreters of the Yi jing’s thirdhexagram (pp. 4f.; Wilhelm 1972: 37), as in “The girl is chaste, does notpromise herself. Ten years, then she promises herself,” but even here“persistent” is a reasonable rendering. The “chaste and obedient” women of theLie nü zhuan (chap. 4) are not so much concerned with their chastity as withpropriety and etiquette. This can also be seen in the Gu liang zhuan’srespectful rendering of the fate of Duke Gong’s 共公 widow, who died in the flamesfor the sake of zhen (Duke Xiang, thirtieth year, 16.2432b). In this sense, theword was a legal term. See Han shu 12.351 and 356, and cf. Dubs 1938/1955, vol.3: 70 and 78; one chaste woman in each district (xiang) was to be chosen to bemade exempt from taxes. The word can be used for male behavior without anysexual connotations. A certain He 禾口 (Han Feizi 13, “He shi” 禾口 氏 750.1), forinstance, who tried to present the king with a piece of jade, called himselfzhen shi 貞 士 (an honest man). With a similar meaning, and joined with zhong 忠(loyalty), it also occurs in the TPJ (185.563).The TPJ rarely calls sexual abstinence “chaste\" 一 the character occurs in onlythree places—but it always criticizes abstinence, as in the section at hand.Retirement and eremitism are also seen as opposed to the belief in the arrivalof great peace (cf. Takahashi 1986: 258). Sexual activity is said to be a basichuman need, as documented below, in section 52. To refrain from it upsetscosmological order and risks the survival of humankind (for instance, TPJ208.655). Not to have progeny is evil:Now men who study dao must take heaven as their model in all respects. But theyoften give it up [絕 for chun 纯, with Long 2000:1344], remain without progeny,and thus let heaven’s dispensation be ruined. Some are chaste [zhen, here“impotent,” as Luo (1996: 1109) correctly translates] by nature (tian xing 天 生),in that their qi is not adequate. Some are not so, but work hard to make itstop. Then Yin and Yang don’t find their way and these men spread their semen onuncultivated ground. Some might even destroy their females or just go away andleave them in poverty. They are all great villains who have lost track of dao .. .The wise men and great worthies of old, who knew [heaven’s] prohibitions,were not willing to have any dealings with men who had no progeny, as if to ruletogether with them would offend the will of heaven [this could also be directedagainst eunuchs in government]. For this reason, the wise and worthy, who are asmessengers from heaven, esteem men with progeny and despise those without. Sincewise men have thorough knowledge of heaven’s will they always strive to achieveit, down to the finest detail. So should not heaven itself do likewise? Nowsince heaven for quite a while has been devoid of good people (shan ren 善人), ithas sent me down here to talk to everybody, advise the latter-born, and bringinsight to foolish men. If heaven were to employ such men wouldn’t this meanthat it assembles around it men without progeny? Should men who behave in thisway rise up to heaven, wouldn’t this mean that heaven favors men who have nochildren and dislike life? So they will in fact all die on barren ground, onsoil where nothing grows, in a desert without people. They will all be sent backto their own kind. Were you to disregard life [and thus] oppose heaven you wouldbe put where there isn’t any life. If you were to prefer that nobody existedthen heaven would put you in a desert, where there is nobody. Since common menare too dull to see this, they say that they are redeeming themselves (du shi度世), which is truly not the case. (TPJ 208.658f.)This passage opposes all men who don’t practice uninterrupted heterosexualintercourse but who instead proclaim that heaven will reward them for theirabstention by inviting them up to heaven. Its basic meaning is close to that ofthe passage at hand. That in this case the details of “heaven’s will” areascertained through the observation of ancient social practice is interesting.It is not clear against which group these attacks are directed. There has beendetailed discussion in the People ‘s Republic about whether the creed that mademen and women leave their homes was Buddhism. This discussion was dominated bythe political prominence of the TPJ in the 1950s and early 1960s and has beenconveniently and sufficiently summarized by Yoshioka (1970: 136). Some argumentswere based on the work of Tang Yongtong (1938: 73–80), who detected in the TPJterms and ideas that he regarded as having been borrowed from Buddhism or asreferring to Buddhism. He cited as evidence the TPJ’s attacks on lack of piety,lack of procreation, the eating of excrement, the drinking of urine, and begging(TPJ 208.655f.). In 1962, the Buddhist Ju Zan (1995: 287–94) replied to thisthat with the exception of eating excrement, which was neither a Buddhist nor aChinese custom and had been introduced for purely polemical purposes, thecustoms mentioned had Chinese roots. In 1963, Tang (Ju 1995: 296) continued thediscussion by dutifully acknowledging that Buddhist practices did not play arole; for overriding ideological reasons the whole of the TPJ had to be a textfrom the early second century C.E., and in the 1960s there was less evidenceavailable for the impact of first-and second-century Buddhism than there istoday. But since we are free to admit that the received text has reached us inan edited version and we have more reason to take Xiang Kai’s 襄 措 knowledge ofBuddhism seriously (see Hou Han shu 30B.1082), we may say that the TPJ is asecond-century text, stating at the same time that it reveals some familiaritywith certain Buddhist points of view and practices.But the Celestial Master might also have directed his attacks towardtime-honored Chinese practices. Within the circles in which early Daoismoriginated, there was a certain tradition of antifamilism. Some practitionersleft home to pursue otherworldly aims, as did, for instance, Qiu Sheng 仇生, PingChangsheng 平常生 (Kaltenmark 1987: 81 and 91–93), and Fei Changfang 費長房 (Hou Hanshu 82B.2743–45; DeWoskin 1983: 77–81), although the ideal of celibacy orchastity hardly played a role in this. It did in later events, such as ChuBoyu’s 緒伯玉 (fifth century) escape from marriage (Nan Qi shu 54.926), which it isdifficult to imagine occurring in pre-Buddhist times.The issue was certainly a subject of debate within Daoist circles. TheXiang’er’s comments on Laozi 6 are puzzling. It condemns sexual techniques, andparticularly the technique of withholding semen, arguing very much along thelines of the TPJ that dao wants men to procreate. But it also observes thatavoiding sexual intercourse is a shortcut to a higher form of existence:Men [or “human beings\"] of supreme virtue with a hard and strong will arecapable of not having intercourse and producing offspring. When they give thisup while they are still young, good spirit (shan shen 善神) will be developedwithin them from early on. We then speak of dao’s vitality [or “dao’s semen”(dao jing 道精)]. This is the reason why heaven and earth have no ancestraltemples, dragons no children, transcendents no wives, and jade girls nohusbands. This is an important point of belief. (Xiang’er 2.6; Bokenkamp 1997:84)This belief in the benefit of chastity fits the accusations made in the TPJ.When the TPJ attacks sexual abstinence it thus attacks a rival group from withinits own circle.5. [chapter_02.xhtml#rch2fn5] As demanded by Laozi 1 and 16.6. [chapter_02.xhtml#rch2fn6] The word for “naïve” is chun 电. Since Chun is alsothe name of one disciple (see TPJ 65.146; 67.168; 78.187; 79.195; 99.224) thismight be a pun.7. [chapter_02.xhtml#rch2fn7] The Chao omits wu (to annul) and thereby avoidsthe TPJ’s awkward three-character verb jue mie wu 絕滅 無.8. [chapter_02.xhtml#rch2fn8] For “great contrariness” (da ni 大 逆) see below,section 63. Jue 絕 (to cause rupture), here jue li 絕理, is the TPJ’s definition ofwrong conduct:Now rupture occurs when a man forgets the commands of dao. Only when he knowsdao’s meaning can he lead his life. (TPJ p. 26, Chao, part 2)Thus “to interrupt qi” (jue qi 絕氣) is the opposite of “maintaining qi” (shou qi守氣), that is, maintaining the activity that safeguards vitality:Well, the dao of heaven and earth can last for a long time through safeguardingqi and not allowing it to be interrupted (shou qi er bu jue 守氣而不絕). Thus heavencreates good and bad fortune only through qi. The ten thousand beings dolikewise. Without qi they die. (TPJ 160.450)Jue qi can serve as a gloss for death, as in “dead, that is, their qi ruptured”(si jue qi 死 絕氣, TPJ 105.272). The Master also warns against an interruption ofheaven’s way (TPJ 103.242), of the dispensation of heaven and earth (54.80;section 41), of the flow of information (see below, section 43), of the true dao(TPJ 154.431), or of food and drink (section 44). In all these cases, rupturecan have deadly results. Moreover, all these instances are interconnected. Notto have progeny is particularly egregious since it causes the rupture of allthree dispensations and thus of life itself. Warnings against it thereforeabound (TPJ p. 22, Chao, part 2; pp. 214 and 218, Chao, part 4; 65.150f.;134.373f.).9. [chapter_02.xhtml#rch2fn9] Wang Ming has here a change of speakers ratherthan an isolated question, but the following sentences are too important to havebeen uttered by a disciple.10. [chapter_02.xhtml#rch2fn10] These honorific terms go back to the Shu jing(“Wu chmg” 武成, p. 184c). King Wu, the founder of the Zhou dynasty, is said tohave announced to “majestic heaven and august earth” the approaching battleagainst the Shang.11. [chapter_02.xhtml#rch2fn11] The expression “to maintain the root” indicatesconcern for the creation and protection of life in all its manifestations (seesection 53, below). In the passage at hand the proper relationship between manand woman is seen as the root of cosmic order. Once it is lost, life on earth issaid to be at risk.Woman and her role are the topic of sections 41 and 42 only. However, throughoutthe text the believer can be female or male. This is clear from the specificobservation that a woman will envisage spirits as female (TPJ 109.292), from theexpression “the people, men and women” (ren min nan nü 人民男女) (TPJ 152.415 and420), and from the short section 159, on sexual technique (which states “Men andwoman reverse their bodies,” and thus treats Yin and Yang as equal). Throughoutthe text, as one would expect in a nature-oriented world of thought, thetogetherness of male and female is seen as the origin of everything (TPJ 65.149;p. 648, Chao, part 7). The Laozi’s “mysterious female” is mentioned as anexample of how to maintain qi (TPJ 160.450).12. [chapter_02.xhtml#rch2fn12] Fa is used throughout the text for tian fa 天法,which is the manifest order of nature and men’s major guideline.13. [chapter_02.xhtml#rch2fn13] Fundamental as this observation is, it isdifficult to find other places where it is expressed in such simple terms. Itpoints to the practical necessity of the study of correlations, without whichhuman endeavors cannot succeed.14. [chapter_02.xhtml#rch2fn14] It is not clear where this quotation comes from.15. [chapter_02.xhtml#rch2fn15] This refers to the zhou 州 into which China wassupposedly divided from the time of Shun onward. The TPJ mentions that there aretwelve (as arranged by Shun; see Shu jing, “Shun dian” 舜典, p. 128c) or perhapsthirteen (139.396), which roughly accords with the situation during Han times(Bielenstein 1980: 90–91).16. [chapter_02.xhtml#rch2fn16] While it is known that Daoist sexual techniquesinclude criteria for the selection of females, the transmitted text of the TPJdoes not deal with this topic. Li Xian’s 李賢 Hou Han shu annotation, however,quotes the following passage:The Perfected had another question: “Why are so few children born nowadays?” TheCelestial Master answered: “It’s good that you have raised this. The reason isthat the act of begetting does not reach its aim. If someone has intercoursewith a woman (ren 人) in order to have children, he will open the jade gate andspread semen inside. This is just as in spring you put seeds into the soil thatwill grow if there is complete mutual harmony. Should you spread these seeds atthe wrong time, as you would if you were, for instance, to put something intothe soil in the tenth month, they would all perish and none at all would live.If you want to examine this matter further: a woman who is unable to havechildren (wu zi zhi nü 無子之女) will not give birth even if she were to receivesemen a hundred times a day. This means that [the semen] does not find a placein which life can be brought forth. For this reason, the wise and worthy of olddid not carelessly put their semen in ground that was not fertile. We call thisto lose seeds and waste qi. It achieves nothing. Now the qi of great peace isabout to arrive. But some men are perhaps without children and have thusinterrupted the dispensation of heaven and earth, so that the country’spopulation is small. It is the way of governing that countries with a largepopulation are rich and those with a small population are poor. Now that qi ofheaven’s supreme majesty has arrived it will let things grow ten thousand timesbetter than they did at the beginning of heaven and earth.” (TPJ p. 733, fromHou Han shu 30B.1081)If this translation is adequate, the argument put forth in this passage lackscohesion, as if parts were missing, but not uncommonly so. There are fewerparticles and clusters of characters, as if the original wording of the TPJ aswe know it had been improved by editing. We may accept the passage as authentic.It informs us that the time at which sexual intercourse takes place and thewoman’s fertility are important for intercourse to be successful and lead toprocreation.17. [chapter_02.xhtml#rch2fn17] The summary says:This section says: Comply with the model of heaven and earth, bring Yin and Yangtogether, and deliver [both] men and women from grief—then rain will fall intime to make earth fertile, and the king’s reign will be peaceful.This section is short. It lacks the background information about heaven, themissionary project, and the role of Master and disciples that is a standardfeature of most sections. It also lacks the set of admonitions that usuallyconcludes a section. The last passage connects it closely with section 41, whichis also unusual.SECTION 43. HOW TO PROMOTE THE GOOD AND HALT THE WICKED1. [chapter_03.xhtml#rch3fn1] This is almost the same wording as at TPJ 41.33.2. [chapter_03.xhtml#rch3fn2] The two missing characters are read as shang fa 賞罰(rewards and punishment).3. [chapter_03.xhtml#rch3fn3] As often, the disciple’s answer here is acommonsense reply, in this case resembling the dominant, Legalist-orientedpolicy.4. [chapter_03.xhtml#rch3fn4] Zhang (chief) or zhang li 長吏 (see Han shu 19A “Baiguan gong qing biao” 百官公 卿表, p. 742; Loewe 1967, vol. 2, p. 57) is the title ofthe head of a county, that is, the lowest centrally installed official(Bielenstein 1980: 100). The term can also be used as a general designation forthe leader of a hamlet (tian zhai 田宅) or suburb (cheng guo 城郭), as elsewhere inthe TPJ (p. 699, Chao, part 8), but the proceedings described in the passage athand strike me as being a little too formal for such a person. Also, it ismentioned that the official travels to the neighborhood, which means that hedoes not reside there.5. [chapter_03.xhtml#rch3fn5] Throughout the TPJ, the relationship betweengovernment and population is one of mutual dependency, quite in line withgeneral political theory, although the TPJ deals with the needs of thepopulation in more detail than the needs of the ruler. Taxes, the fighting ofwars, and labor service, which originate with the ruler and play a big role inthe classical thinkers’ list of complaints, are not mentioned, while poverty,epidemics, violence, poor harvests, and untimely death are mentioned. These areproblems that cannot be tackled by traditional political reform, and mentioningthem thus opens the way for measures oriented toward great peace. The ruler isexpected to give wealth to the people and to look after their needs (cf. section41, above, and 44, below; see also TPJ 100.228), but this is not done simplythrough a reduction of taxes. On the other hand, the people’s loyalty is alsoexpected to be quite intensive in that they must search for drugs and recipes tohelp their ruler live a long time (TPJ 63.133).Since the achievement of great peace is a joint project, communication betweendifferent political strata is an important issue. The flow of information inperson described in this section is exceptional, necessitated by an emergency.The regular channel for such communication is writings (see Kaltenmark 1979:27–29). The main difficulty in both cases is how to distinguish between true andfalse information. Truth, as the Celestial Master argues, can be gathered fromquantity: “One cannot trust the words of one man” (TPJ 106.279; cf. Kaltenmark1979: 27). Thus there is a formalistic way of establishing how much truth areport contains: a report handed in by one person is not true at all (TPJ127.326), while a report handed in by ten people is most trustworthy (TPJ127.327). The “wait-and-see” method is another option for determining truth.Individuals whose report has not been proven false over a period of three yearsmust be rewarded with office (TPJ 65.152; 81.206; cf. Hachiya 1983: 53). Thismethod also plays a role in section 43, where it is argued that informationshould be rewarded only after a certain period of time has elapsed. Since alarger number of reports guarantees more truth, the Celestial Master demandsthere be a network throughout the country for the official collection of writtenmaterial; this should include the border regions, thus allowing barbarians tocontribute as well (TPJ 129.333). At this point the demands of the scriptureseem to be in agreement with the historical reality of early Daoist movements(cf. Stein 1963). The material thus collected is to be officially sorted out andcompiled into a single document, which will then be distributed among thepeople. The individual contributors will in this case be known by name and canbe rewarded.Another major problem in all communication between officials and ordinarysubjects is the need to protect informants. This difficulty is addressed inclear terms with regard to written communication. Informants are advised toleave their own hamlet, district (xiang ting 鄉 亭), county, commandery, and evenprovince and deliver their reports elsewhere in order to avoid the threats andintervention of local officials, notwithstanding that heavy punishments are tobe applied against such officials should they interfere (TPJ 127.317).Takahashi (1986: 259 and 263f.) has argued that the social issues the TPJ dealswith are always, as in this section, related to a small rural community, whilethe institutions and policies of central government are ignored. There iscertainly a contrast between a missionary doctrine that links in true chiliasticstyle the fate of humankind to worldwide socio-religious reforms and theconcrete implementation of these reforms, which a devoted group of adepts canbest initiate locally. The regionally enforced interdiction of infanticide (seesection 42) attests to the limited range to which administrative constraintsconfined such reforms.6. [chapter_03.xhtml#rch3fn6] Officials who had retired from central governmentpositions did in fact play a role in local affairs, judging by their sponsorshipof certain local projects; see Ebrey 1980: 351f.7. [chapter_03.xhtml#rch3fn7] The virtue of “understanding” (ming 明) isassociated with the south: “In the south is the great Yang; it [resembles] theruler’s full understanding” (TPJ 105.264).8. [chapter_03.xhtml#rch3fn8] The two groups mentioned here correspond to groupsin the Han social structure. “Filial sons” and “fraternal brothers” were onvarious occasions locally selected, presented with bales of silk, and exemptedfrom taxes and labor service. They were a group from whom local governmentrepresentatives would recommend candidates for office in the central government.Tian jia jin zi 佃家僅子 is another name for the li tian 力 田 (outstanding farmers),who were of a slightly lower rank than the “filial and fraternal” but whoenjoyed similar privileges; see Hsu 1980: 24–25; 170–71. For an alternativeunderstanding see Kaltenmark 1979: 32, where a rendering of the whole passage onwhich much of what is presented here relies can also be found.9. [chapter_03.xhtml#rch3fn9] Several groups in a list of ten that has beentransmitted in the Chao resemble groups in the passage at hand. The purpose oforganizing the population into ten groups is said to be social order andcoherence, which is similar to the purpose behind the formation of groups in thepassage at hand:“Ten groups\" (lü) is the method of the worthy and wise of the past, who wantedmen to be good and prevent them from robbing and injuring each other, so thatthey could fulfill their natural life span. (TPJ p. 302, Chao, part 5)The first is the “group of great kindness, piety, and obedience,” who excel inthe art of what is as it is (ziran zhi shu 自然之術), which they have understoodwithout having learned it:They act in agreement with heaven’s intentions and further earth’s wishes. Abovethey benefit emperors and kings; below they make the people prosperous. (TPJ p.301, Chao, part 5)The second group are “the great learned [rou 柔 (weak) meaning ru 儒] whounderstand morality” (ming dao de da ru 明道德大儒). This group resembles the secondgroup in section 43. The third is the “group of the filial and fraternal who arestarting to learn how to become better men” (xiao di shi xue hua shan 孝第始學化善):they avoid what is wrong and manage to be “upright” and “humane” (zheng 正; ren仁); this group is equal to the “filial and fraternal” of section 43. The fourthare the “group of diligent farmers,” that is, tian jia jin li zi 佃家僅力子, similarto group 4 in the section at hand:They are at work by sunrise, and with sunset they rest. They don’t shun hardlabor, which has continuous returns. They are courteous at home, nurture theirfather and mother, obtain the products of their soil, conform to the way ofheaven, do not dare to do evil, and are of benefit to the county office. (TPJ p.302, Chao, part 5)The fifth is “the group of people largely without benevolence, young folkwithout propriety, who like to use weapons and devise schemes,” resembling thelast group of section 43. The other five groups have nothing at all to recommendthem.10. [chapter_03.xhtml#rch3fn10] The former officials sit in the west, theposition of small Yang:Small Yang is a subordinate, who is brought into shape [qu zhe 屈 折 (bent)] bypropriety. Since small Yang obeys the great Yang, it is formed as metal is byfire before men find it useful. The subordinate is always brought into shape bypropriety before a lord sees him as a useful assistant. (See TPJ 105.264 and cf.Luo 1996: 473 for the rendering of this passage)11. [chapter_03.xhtml#rch3fn11] Jing dao 經道 serves as an acronym for ming jingdao de 明經道德, used previously.12. [chapter_03.xhtml#rch3fn12] The east is where the sun and all beings comefrom: “So the east is small Yang. It is the place where a ruler begins his life.Thus the sun rises in the east” (TPJ 105.263f.). Yu (2001a: 49) wants to replaceben 本 with mu 木 (wood), which would put more stress than intended on cosmicorder.13. [chapter_03.xhtml#rch3fn13] “Therefore the east likes to give life” (TPJ105.262). For the sequence of the four directions, see below, section 53.14. [chapter_03.xhtml#rch3fn14] “So the southeast is Yang and the northwest Yin”(TPJ 105.271). Section 105 refers to the Yi jing for detailed explanations (TPJ105.272–74).15. [chapter_03.xhtml#rch3fn15] The text reads bu jin 不僅 (not diligent), whichis the opposite of the jin zi 僅子 mentioned earlier. The creation of yet anothersocial group, not mentioned earlier in the general setup, is not plausible.Therefore, bu is emended to fu 夫. The error might be based on content. For the“diligent” and the “wicked” to receive equal treatment does not look right.16. [chapter_03.xhtml#rch3fn16] If “coherent” is the correct understanding ofxiang ying 才目應, what is described here would be a more sophisticated way ofestablishing the truth than the methods mentioned above. The passage could, ofcourse, also mean nothing more than that the outcome proves a certain informantright. Long (2000: 92) argues that the coherence between a person’s words andhis acts is at stake. This ignores the fact that the issue is reporting a crimecommitted by others.17. [chapter_03.xhtml#rch3fn17] This is a frequently expressed worry: “Cutemperors and kings off from the flow of intelligence and you make them sufferbitterly” (TPJ 127.318). They are thus deprived of their chance of receivingvital information:When majestic heaven sends calamities, anomalies, and disasters, they don’tnecessarily always happen in the palaces of emperors and kings, on the premisesof the county office, or in front of its head. Calamities, disasters, and otherirregular events are always first noticed by the people, who live in the wide,open land. But, out of respect for their magistrate, the lowly and dejected whoknow about them first do not dare say anything. The magistrate, out of respectfor his lord, doesn’t dare speak. As a result, they interrupt what heaven andearth have to tell. Since all these men wish to praise the county head and givehim an excellent name, they make his achievements look great and his removaldespicable. So they lose sight of proper conduct (wu dao 無 道), conceal thecalamities, anomalies, disasters, and other irregular events in heaven and onearth, and don’t let news of them reach emperors and kings, who, through nofault of their own, are cut off, lack intelligence and don’t understand whatheaven and earth want. Their reign is then at risk of disorder. Stability isdifficult to achieve. They suffer bitterly because of this. (TPJ 127.320f.)18. [chapter_03.xhtml#rch3fn18] When the Celestial Master uses the expressiontian ziran 天自然, he means that a particular statement is not grounded in anythingelse; in the passage at hand it means that the relationship between Yang and Yinis not derived from any other cosmic entity; see also below, section 53.19. [chapter_03.xhtml#rch3fn19] The summary says:This section explains how to promote the good and to bring the wicked to a halt;to gain intelligence; to apprehend robbers and bandits; to obtain men who areloyal and trustworthy.The translation here is more tentative than usual.SECTION 44. HOW TO PRESERVE THE THREE ESSENTIALS1. [chapter_04.xhtml#rch4fn1] In the title to this section, ji 急 (need) isreplaced by shi 實 (essential), probably because of the unusual meaning attachedto ji in this section.2. [chapter_04.xhtml#rch4fn2] See Shen jian 1 “Zheng ti” 政體, p. 2.3. [chapter_04.xhtml#rch4fn3] For this use of ming zi 名字 see TPJ 131.340. Thepassage must be seen in relation to what is said later in this section on theneed to maintain life before one can maintain order.4. [chapter_04.xhtml#rch4fn4] This second invitation to participate in the talkseems to be superfluous. Elsewhere the phrase is of some structural relevance,when it is used in the course of a section rather than at the start. It thenintroduces a new question (TPJ 103.253 and 254; 129.334) or a summary of thepreceding talk (TPJ 46.52; 103.252). It is a stylistic device occurring in someparts of the text—section 103 is three times thus interrupted—and rarely used inothers.5. [chapter_04.xhtml#rch4fn5] This use of the interrogative shui 誰 as “what” israre.6. [chapter_04.xhtml#rch4fn6] The term yan 厭 (to oppress) is used in Buddhistterminology for the aspect of the world that wearies the believer and from whichhe seeks deliverance. The deadly risk created by too much sense stimulation iswell expressed in the section “Give importance to life” (gui sheng 貴生) in the Lüshi chun qiu.7. [chapter_04.xhtml#rch4fn7] In the TPJ, ziran 自然 (what is as it is) is of veryhigh rank, as in Laozi 25. Here the text agrees with Yan Zun’s (first-centuryB.C.E.) understanding of the Laozi’s ontological stratification (see Robinet1977: 14; Jin 1997: 417-21), for instance, as opposed to the Xiang’er, which inannotating Laozi 25 raises dao to equal rank with ziran. This indicates that theCelestial Master sees little need to stress dao’s role as a cosmic force. Forhim, dao seems to work in the more indirect way of providing the explanation forcorrelations and thus social and cosmic coherence.In cosmogonic order, ziran follows directly after primordial qi (yuan qi 元氣):Primordial qi is Yang and in control of giving life. What is as it is causeschange (hua 化); it is Yin and is in charge of nourishing all beings and things.(TPJ p. 220, Chao, part 4)When primordial qi and what is as it is are pleased they will together bringforth heaven and earth, and when these two are happy Yin and Yang will be inharmony and wind and rain will cooperate. When this is the case, they will letthe twelve thousand plants and beings grow. (TPJ pp. 647f., Chao, part 7; cf. Li1984).This order is implied rather than explained or expressed in detail:When primordial qi is pleased, it brings forth great prosperity. When what is asit is is joyful, beings and objects are strong. When heaven is happy, the threeluminaries are bright. When earth is pleased, harvest results (cheng 成) areconstant. (TPJ p. 13, Chao, part 2)These passages show that ziran’s cosmogonic rank manifests itself when it helpsto order the cosmos:Once you have completed the dao of what is as it is, what would not be complete?What would not have been converted (hua)? Everyone welcomes it. Isn’t this[like] the generosity of heaven’s being what it is (tian ziran)? (TPJ 195.602,layer B)Hence the need to safeguard and enact (TPJ 179.533, layer B) ziran and not tolose it (TPJ 168.472, layer C). It can be brought about through perfecting dao(TPJ 83.211). With its help, the people rule over themselves (TPJ p. 25, Chao,part 2) and gain longevity (TPJ p. 728, Chao, part 1). Nothing is superior to it(TPJ p. 193, Chao, part 4). When the different species are what they are, theyare satisfied (TPJ 72.175). People knew this in the past (TPJ 73.178). This isthe sense in which the term is used in this section. Emulating ziran was thelifestyle of humankind when it was young. In the days of outgoing antiquity,however, only certain individuals can achieve it, through study.What happens through ziran 自 然 happens of its own accord, “spontaneously,”independently of outside stimuli. This is the meaning of “the method (shu 術; orthe “model” or “example\" [fa 法]) of what is as it is,” a term that abounds inthe text in reference to what is naturally so. It always carries a positivevalue. Wang Chong uses the term to arrive at a clear distinction between what wemight call natural processes and men’s actions (Lun heng 54 “Ziran). He arguesthat heaven produces food spontaneously, not from benevolent concern formankind, since benevolence is a human quality. This is in contrast to theCelestial Master’s understanding of ziran, whereby this “method” does notexclude family relations between heaven, earth, and men.8. [chapter_04.xhtml#rch4fn8] The Yi jing (hexagram 20, p. 14) defines shen dao才申道 as a way of government by which the ruler relies on instructions derivingfrom the course of nature.9. [chapter_04.xhtml#rch4fn9] Joseph Needham (1962: 63) shows that the reasonsbehind the development of heat and cold were unknown anywhere in the worldbefore modern science. The explanation given here is quite systematic.10. [chapter_04.xhtml#rch4fn10] These four relations are indeed basic for thesocial life envisaged by the Celestial Master. It is no accident that theydiffer from the five relations introduced in the Mengzi (3A.4), where therelationship between husband and wife is relegated to third place, after thatbetween father and son and ruler and subordinate, and where the relationshipbetween teacher and disciple is not mentioned.11. [chapter_04.xhtml#rch4fn11] This passage uses the similarity between yi(clothes) and yi with the radical for “man 依, meaning to support.12. [chapter_04.xhtml#rch4fn12] The liu qing 六情 (six feelings, or conditions)are love, anger, hatred, pleasure, joy, and sadness; see Han shu 75.3168 (YiFeng’s 翼奉 biography).13. [chapter_04.xhtml#rch4fn13] With Yu 2001a: 53, ji 極 (ridgepole) is correctedto ji 亟 (hastily).14. [chapter_04.xhtml#rch4fn14] The present in which the Master and discipleslive is the period of outgoing antiquity. Xia gu or jin xia gu 今下古 is used inthis sense throughout the text’s layer A, that is, throughout the dialoguesbetween Master and disciples. The disciples are expected to show the CelestialMaster’s works to the “men of outgoing antiquity” (TPJ 63.141; pp. 646 and 691,Chao, part 7 and 8) to make them think about it (TPJ 131.347; 191.589) andunderstand heaven’s dao (TPJ 212.676); the men of outgoing antiquity mustremember what the Celestial Master has said (TPJ 66.167). These men are ingreater need of instruction because they are worse off than were theirpredecessors, whose evil deeds they have inherited (TPJ 153.427 and section 48).They are therefore foolish (TPJ 131.359; 191.589), find fault with true dao (TPJ141.401; 155.436), and are difficult to govern (TPJ 152.419).This use of early, middle, and, in particular, late antiquity is not that of theLi ji and the Han shu as quoted Morohashi (1985) no. 12.494, where earlyantiquity is represented by Fu Xi, middle antiquity by Shen Nong or King Wen,and late antiquity by the Five Emperors or Confucius. This usage in the TPJ runscounter to the standard use of gu for the past as opposed to the present, jin.It adds an anachronistic touch to the dialogues in that it seems to incorporatethe perspective of a later observer. However, if interpreted from within theCelestial Master’s view of history the term refers to the expectation that theold world will come to an end with the arrival of great peace. This approach issimilar to the Yellow Turbans’ announcement that in future heaven, which used tobe blue, would turn yellow (see the Introduction, above).15. [chapter_04.xhtml#rch4fn15] This resembles what is said in the Mengzi (6A.8)about Ox Mountain.16. [chapter_04.xhtml#rch4fn16] To run is an image of urgency:Heaven on its way (dao) can be at leisure or in an urgent hurry (ji 急), just asman in his actions can be. When heaven is in a hurry wind, rain, thunder, andlightning come all at once, and when it is urgent men on their way (dao) willrun and get there in no time. (TPJ p. 687, Chao, part 8)17. [chapter_04.xhtml#rch4fn17] Early antiquity is said to have been the periodof the Three Majestic Rulers (TPJ 63.139; 167.468), also called shang(“supreme,” or perhaps “earliest”) san huang 上三皇 (TPJ 78.192; 155.435). In oneinstance, the Three Majestic Rulers are said to have been of middle antiquity,while in early antiquity, men were ruled without the use of texts (TPJ81.205f.). The Three Majestic Rulers were followed by the Five Emperors, ThreeKings, and Five Hegemons (TPJ 63.140; 102.237). However, these figures don’toccur often, and names are never attributed to them. The common taiping way ofviewing history is to distinguish early, middle, and late antiquity. Thefollowing observation is one way to characterize the three ages:The wise and worthy of early antiquity (shang gu sheng xian 上古聖賢) resided inpalaces, the scholars of middle antiquity (zhong shi 中士) reached transcendencein the mountains, and the scholars of late antiquity (xia shi 下 士) are dyingamong the people as if they were insects. (TPJ p. 309, Chao, part 5)A return to early antiquity is equated with a conversion to taiping principles,as pointed out in full detail by Kamitsuka (1999: 303-8). The appearance of evilpractices was a historical process in all fields: it can be seen in governmentpolicies regarding the use of punishment (TPJ 63.139; 64.143; 81.206), and itcan be seen in patterns of behavior (TPJ 48.61; 101.232; 105.268). It can alsobe seen in the spread of heresies (TPJ p. 650, Chao, part 7), the corruption oftexts (TPJ 47.56), the practice of infanticide (TPJ 41.56), the promotion ofchastity (TPJ 42.37), and the shortening of life (TPJ 155.436f). The length ofthis process points to the difficulties ahead. There was a deterioration fromearly and middle antiquity onward (TPJ 42.37; 110.295, layer B). The continuedeffort of Master and disciples is thus required to reverse attitudes that havetaken so long to mature.18. [chapter_04.xhtml#rch4fn18] “Embellishments” (duan 端) (see also sections 45and 53) stand in the way of safeguarding the one:It is possible to know ten thousand embellishments. But with knowing so much,one can’t know the one. Only through guarding the one can one transcend theworld (du shi 度世). (From Secret Advice by the Wise Lord of the Scripture onGreat Peace; see TPJ p. 743)19. [chapter_04.xhtml#rch4fn19] The summary says:This section says: If you safeguard three essentials, the qi of peace arrives,deception and fraud go away, and villainy and knavery are cut off.This does not touch on the central issue of the section, which is the need tocut out what is not essential.SECTION 45. THE THREE NEEDS AND THE METHOD OF [DEALING WITH] AUSPICIOUS ANDOMINOUS EVENTS1. [chapter_05.xhtml#rch5fn1] Here the Celestial Master, aiming for the creationof and adherence to structural parallelism, puts forth an absurd statement.2. [chapter_05.xhtml#rch5fn2] This expression is also used to refer to plants inTPJ 209.669.3. [chapter_05.xhtml#rch5fn3] This does not follow the Laozi’s (48)understanding of the growth of knowledge.4. [chapter_05.xhtml#rch5fn4] Zhi wen 質文 (substance and decorum) are Lun yuterms (6.18 and 12.8); it is Confucius’s point of view that a person needs both.“Decorum” is here used in the sense of an inferior quality, as explained below.The “substance” in plants is the produce.5. [chapter_05.xhtml#rch5fn5] This is as close as the TPJ gets to discussing theconditions of knowledge. The problem is approached from several angles, workingwith modified opposites. The first supposition uses the image of a plant andsays that the root explains the center and the center the branches. The secondis structured in a parallel mode reaching from basis (gen 根) to substance andthen decorum. The third arranges historical periods as early, middle, and lateantiquity, for the sake of proper government. The last and most abstractapproach involves the ontological entities primordial qi, ziran, and the modelsset up by heaven and earth. Throughout the text, as in the paragraph thatfollows, this last approach is seen as the most accurate way of understanding,as is the case in much of the Zhuangzi (in particular chap. 4 “Ren xian shi”仁間世; see Graham 1989: 198).Shang yuan ling qi 上元靈氣 is used here as another, more decorative, and perhapsalso more practice-oriented word for yuan qi. The expression shang yuan is usedfor “first,” as, for instance, for the first of three sexagenary cycles. Ling qioccurs in the quietist chapters of the Guanzi (chap. 49 “Nei ye” 内業, p. 272; cf.Rickett 1965: 168: “the subtle breath of life”) and is used in this sense inDaoist material. See, for example, quotations from the Zi xu yuan jun neizjtuan紫虛元君内傳 (Yunjiqiqian 41.1b), which state that ling qi can be obtained throughexternal and internal purification (“washing”). An identical statement can befound in Yunji qiqian 33.7a, quoting Sun Simiao’s 孫思邈 (581-682?) She yang zhenzhong fang 攝養枕中方.6. [chapter_05.xhtml#rch5fn6] To do this properly amounts to good government;see above, section 41.7. [chapter_05.xhtml#rch5fn7] “Using such ways of thinking [as analyzingseasonal changes] the wise kings of old carefully examined symptoms of gain andloss” (TPJ p. 17, Chao, part 2). They were, in other words, expert practitionersof prognostics. As the Jing fa (p. 1) puts it:Misfortune and good luck arrive in the same way. We don’t know where from. Theonly way to know this lies in emptiness and nothingness (xu wu 虛無).8. [chapter_05.xhtml#rch5fn8] The san zhen 三真 are body deities, perhaps amongthe most high ranking: see Andersen 1980: 5, translating the Ziyang zhenrenneizhuan (p. 6a), which was “revealed” to Hua Qiao in 399 C.E. There, the threeare said to be the infant (chi zi 赤子), the perfected (zhen ren 真人), and thechild (ying er 婴 兒). The expression san zhen is common in later material onmeditation; cf. Yunji qiqian, chapters 42-44. I have not been able to find it inearlier material. This has probably tempted Luo (1996: 84) and Long (2000: 106)to replace zhen with shi (essential) as used in the preceding paragraph. Sincetextual criticism applied now can only hope to restore the sixth-centuryoriginal, there does not seem to be a need to correct the wording. We may acceptit as one of the few examples where the sixth-century editors’ own usage ofterms entered into their work on the old text.9. [chapter_05.xhtml#rch5fn9] The summary says:This section explains how the ten thousands plants and beings safeguard theroot, and how they are happy when obtaining the three needs and come to harmwhen they lose them.SECTION 46. YOU MUST NOT SERVE THE DEAD MORE THAN THE LIVING1. [chapter_06.xhtml#rch6fn1] Hou Han shu 1.51, trans. by Poo 1990: 42.2. [chapter_06.xhtml#rch6fn2] Hou Han shu 34.1177; see Poo 1990: 50.3. [chapter_06.xhtml#rch6fn3] Cf. Hsu 1980: 59 and Poo 1990: 55.4. [chapter_06.xhtml#rch6fn4] That this was a commonly held view is evidenced bythe splendor of graves from the third century B.C.E. onward. Lavish funeraryrites were widely and severely criticized (see Loewe 1982: 115; Wang Fu, Qian fulun 12 “Fu yi”), but hardly with argumentative rigidity. The critique raised inYan tie lun 25 “Xiao yang”孝養 stresses the need for emotional involvement, asopposed to external splendor, in line with Confucius’s (Lunyu 2.7) dictum that aperson who unfeelingly nourishes parents resembles an animal. Only Wang Chong’scritique is based on philosophical grounds when he argues (Lun heng 67 “Bo zang”簿葬) that demons don’t exist and that funerary services are therefore irrelevant.5. [chapter_06.xhtml#rch6fn5] The phrase bu ye 不也 here expresses a rhetoricalquestion, in colloquial style; see Yu 2001b: 467.6. [chapter_06.xhtml#rch6fn6] This is dealt with in detail in section 60. It isa good example of Yin/Yang-based moral argumentation.7. [chapter_06.xhtml#rch6fn7] A change in social rank due to personal change isa consequence of Yin/Yang-based fluctuation. It can arise through learning (TPJ42.96), when individuals move upward in line with their education. Here suchfluctuation is seen as overriding family hierarchy in that the living son issaid to be surpassing his deceased father.8. [chapter_06.xhtml#rch6fn8] The Master attempts to discredit a generallyaccepted moral norm as nothing but personal preference. In opposition to it, hesets up the preservation of life as the only valid norm. However, filial pietyis depicted as a basic virtue throughout the scripture. In layer B it is seen asthe most obvious manifestation of a man’s goodness, in particular throughoutsection 195: “Among the activities of this world, filial piety is supreme and offirst rank” (TPJ 195.593). It is also used in a Chao passage in the sense ofgeneral goodness: it is paired with longevity (shou), and the filial are said tocooperate with heaven and earth, and in particular with earth, since they obeytheir superiors (TPJ p. 310, Chao, part 5; the layer is not clear).However, throughout most of layer A the term is used in a more narrow sense. Tobe filial is to obey one’s parents as a subordinate obeys his lord. Thus theterm is paired with “loyalty” (zhong 忠) (TPJ 175.513) and also with a student’s“obedience” (shun 順):While alive, a man must be filial as a son, loyal as a subordinate, and obedientas a student. If he does not give up these three virtues his hun and bo spiritwill not face any interrogation once he has died. (TPJ 96.408)The passage at hand, then, must be seen as an attempt to rewrite the meaning ofthe norm of filial piety rather than as an attempt to deprive it of its rank inmoral thought. To be filial means to prolong the lives of one’s parents, not tobury them in splendor.9. [chapter_06.xhtml#rch6fn9] The short passage down to “. . . must agree withthe model set up by heaven” repeats in concise form what has been said before.It seems to wind up as well as strengthen the argument by directly involvingheaven in the issue: undue respect for the dead is said to be an offense againstheaven.10. [chapter_06.xhtml#rch6fn10] Ying fa 應法 is one of the rare instances of aseemingly Buddhist expression (Soothill 1972: 458: “in harmony with the dharma”)occurring in the text. However, fa here means tian fa 天法. The full expressionying tian fa 應天法 is used TPJ 65.150: “Lord, officials, and the people must allmatch the model [set up by] heaven.”11. [chapter_06.xhtml#rch6fn11] We must assume that the punishment would be moresevere than the routine interrogations almost everyone is subjected to at theend of a month or a year. As spirit a man is still a subject, just as he waswhile alive:In order to earn a living, all spirits and vital beings between heaven and earthmust help heaven to nourish the twelve thousand plants and beings and let themgrow properly, in the same way as officials and worthies live by helpingemperors and kings to raise the people and the ten thousand beings. Spirits andvital beings take heaven as their model: they make themselves available for ashort interrogation on the fifteenth of each month, for one of medium size atthe end of the month, and for a full one at the end of the year. In this waythose who deserve promotion will get it and those who don’t will be asked toretire or will be punished. (TPJ 151.407f.)12. [chapter_06.xhtml#rch6fn12] Called xiong e zhi shi 凶惡之事. As the Zuo zhuanputs it, “Life is a good thing and death is a bad thing” (Duke Zhao,twenty-fifth year, 51.2108c; translated by Legge 1960: 709).13. [chapter_06.xhtml#rch6fn13] The Master does not produce a demonologicalhandbook in the manner of the Nüqing guilü. He doesn’t name demons, but hecontrols them. A rather simplistic Chao passage puts it like this:The wise men of antiquity were able to guard dao. When they were pure andtranquil at the time of the morning meal they called forth all the spirits (shen神) to talk to them, as men today might summon their guests. The hundred spiritsspoke of themselves as heaven’s servants and its messengers, the group of vitalbeings (jing 精) were earth’s servants and its messengers, and the hundred demons(gui 鬼) were messengers of the space between heaven and earth. These three werethe messengers of Yin, Yang, and the harmony between them (zhonghe). Theysupported the order established by heaven and earth, and greatly benefitedemperors and kings. (TPJ p. 15, part 2)The linkage between the living and the dead is a spiritual matter, which iseffected through spiritual concentration, that is, through meditation (that is,“guarding dao”). The background for what is said in this passage can also beseen in Confucius’s demand that spirits must be kept at a distance; see Lun yu6.22 and cf. Puett 2002: 97.14. [chapter_06.xhtml#rch6fn14] With Yu (2001a: 58), I change gu 古 (old) to zhan占 (to predict, to examine) and understand guan zhan 觀占 as “to observe.”15. [chapter_06.xhtml#rch6fn15] Luo (1996: 87) argues that the phrase wei guangu zhe zuo rong 為觀古者作榮 is taken from Laozi’s (26; see Henricks 1990: 238) phraserong guan 榮觀 (magnificent scenes). In both Mawangdui texts, this reads huan guan環官 (walled-in hostel), which makes much more sense. No interpretation of theLaozi sees guan as a verb, but for syntactical reasons the TPJ passage seems toforce us to see guan as functioning verbally.16. [chapter_06.xhtml#rch6fn16] This starts a new dialogue, which contains a newline of argumentation. The topic is identical to the first, but the message isdifferent. What is said here is close to Wang Chong’s argument against theexistence of ghosts:A man’s death resembles the extinction of fire. Once extinguished its flame doesnot shine. Once a man is dead, his understanding is no longer at work. (Lun heng62 “Lun si” 論死, p. 877)17. [chapter_06.xhtml#rch6fn17] Preparation for great peace must be as inclusiveas the state of great peace is expected to be: “With one qi interrupted, allactivities go wrong” (TPJ p. 18, Chao, part 2), or “Should one qi not succeed,harmony will not be achieved” (TPJ p. 20, Chao, part 2). Section 56 repeats thispoint.18. [chapter_06.xhtml#rch6fn18] Yu (2001a: 58) points out that Wang Ming’sattempt to correct ling 令 (to let) to jin 今 (now) is superfluous.19. [chapter_06.xhtml#rch6fn19] The expression tian di ren jun occurs once againin the TPJ in a context similar to the one at hand; the question is theattribution of responsibility for the present state of affairs and for theactions necessary to change things:When the reign continues to lack peace this is not because of heaven, earth, orthe sovereign. The fault lies basically and in general with men. For a long timethey themselves have committed severe crimes against majestic heaven and augustearth. All this reaches back to the individual human being (皆由一人). (TPJ 103.255,layer A; punctuation by Yu 2001a: 215; see also Luo 1996: 429f.)20. [chapter_06.xhtml#rch6fn20] Si wei 死 偽 is the title of Lun heng chapter 63,in Forke’s (1962, vol. 1, p. 202) translation: “False reports about the dead.”The preceding paragraph is a summary, the second preliminary summary of thissection.21. [chapter_06.xhtml#rch6fn21] This is a commonly held view of death,expressed, for instance, in the Li ji (“Yu zao” 玉 菓, p. 1457a): “The hunspirit’s qi (hun qi 魂氣) returns to heaven; the bo spirit, which has form (xingbo 形魄), returns to earth.” As stated in TPJ 179.528, layer B, what continues toexist after death is hun, while bones and flesh are returned to earth. Thus huncan be held responsible for deeds done by a person while alive. It isinterrogated (see above) and examined (kao 考) (TPJ 188.579, layer B; 195.600,probably layer B) in the world below. It is in contact with sons and grandsons:“Grave” is a mound where one’s ancestors live. It is called “the original seed,laid out at the very beginning.” “Dwelling place” (zhai 宅) is the soil, to whichhun spirits must return in order to nourish sons and grandsons. If the soil isgood, hun will return to nourish; if it is bad, it will come back to causedamage. After five generations, the ancestral qi will come to an end and againbecome human. (TPJ 76.182, layer not clear)This passage is characteristic of the sections assembled in chapter 50, some ofwhich show characteristics of layer A. They advocate the proper use oftechniques, in this case fengshui practices, and show little interest in themessage of general salvation. K. E. Brashier’s (1996) careful account of “Hanthanatology” shows that the Celestial Master’s ideas on death, as presented inthe passage at hand, belong to the broad spectrum of Han views on the human“soul” or “souls” in life and death.22. [chapter_06.xhtml#rch6fn22] This is Wang Chong’s view; see Lun heng 77 “Jiyi” 祭意, pp. 1067f.23. [chapter_06.xhtml#rch6fn23] As Yu (2001a: 59) points out, the text wouldread more smoothly if a second guo sheng 過 生 were added after the first.24. [chapter_06.xhtml#rch6fn24] The summary says:This section instructs: the living must be served until death; root and branchesmust agree with each other.This is uncommonly short and has little to do with the content of the section.SECTION 47. HOW TO VERIFY THE TRUSTWORTHINESS OF TEXTS AND WRITINGS1. [chapter_07.xhtml#rch7fn1] The translation of sections 47 and 48 here istaken, in slightly modified form, with kind permission from Hawai’i Reader inTraditional Chinese Culture, ed. V. H. Mair, N. S. Steinhardt, and P. R. Goldin,Honolulu: University of Hawai’i Press, 2005: 225–30.2. [chapter_07.xhtml#rch7fn2] See Pokora 1975: 76, as quoted in the Hong mingji.3. [chapter_07.xhtml#rch7fn3] Jie 解 means “to explain,” “to dissolve,” and “toredeem,” an ambiguity that is relevant to the wording of this section and isreflected in the student’s bewilderment.4. [chapter_07.xhtml#rch7fn4] Students are attracted to the Celestial Master’sknowledge of yang xing 養性, and this knowledge is linked to the practice ofmeditation, and in particular to the technique called “guarding the one”:Originally, I was interested in all three hundred methods of guarding the oneand nourishing the vital principle. But now that I hear the Celestial Masterspeak without restraint, I would like to ask how the body can be made to lastlong. (TPJ 165.459)Maspero (1981, book 9) has explained in detail the techniques involved in“nourishing the vital principle\" (yang xing). The assumption that the taipingtext deals only with such techniques is not to be verified by the textusreceptus, but the protection of life and concern with nature can be seen as theguiding principles behind many arguments. Yang xing is derived from living inunity with heaven:The pulse is in unison with heaven, earth, and the ten thousand beings; it movesforward with qi, and when the cycle is finished it returns to the beginning. Onobtaining its cipher one nourishes the vital principle by knowing when it istime for qi to come and when not. (TPJ 74.180)When editing material the Perfected is advised to:Assign one juan 巻 to each good technique (shan fang 善方); begin with the methodof how to nourish the vital principle well, put it at the end of the book [wherethe reader starts to unroll it], and let all worthy gentlemen recite it. This isthe centerpiece of the “Scripture that Pervades All” (dongji zhi jing 洞極之經).(TPJ 129.337; cf. Luo 1996: 590 and Long 2000: 680)It is a ruler’s task to distribute texts that teach this method, just as it ishis task to distribute food and clothes to the needy. In contrast to this, thefollowing material should not be distributed:Such books [the established classical texts] don’t deal with the standarddoctrine (zheng dao 正道), lead the worthy and the educated astray, are of no usefor administrative affairs, and don’t nourish the vital principle. (TPJ 100.230)5. [chapter_07.xhtml#rch7fn5] Laozi 72 raises the issue of cherishing oneselfand argues that the sage can and may do so, in moderation.6. [chapter_07.xhtml#rch7fn6] Laozi 13 stresses that to have a body is a causefor worry.7. [chapter_07.xhtml#rch7fn7] Here the full term zai yi bian guai 災異變怪 is givento mention all the warnings that can be sent by heaven to make rulers changetheir ways; these four characters, and in particular zai, can occur alone or invarious combinations without any visible change in meaning. A good account ofthe politico-moral function of aberrations from the regular course of nature isin Bai hu tong 6 “Zai bian” 災變. The TPJ insists that the inherited andtransmitted evil is increased when minor officials block reports on suchaberrations so that they don’t reach the ruler (cf. the long discussion at TPJ127.315f. and below, section 59).8. [chapter_07.xhtml#rch7fn8] The summary says:This section instructs on the question of how the Celestial Master’s writingshave been published from beginning to end.SECTION 48. AN EXPLANATION OF THE RECEPTION AND TRANSMISSION [OF EVIL] IN FIVESITUATIONS1. [chapter_08.xhtml#rch8fn1] See the commentary to hexagram 2, p. 4, inBaynes’s (Wilhelm 1989: 393) slightly biblical translation: “A house that heapsgood upon good is sure to have an abundance of blessings. A house that heapsevil upon evil is sure to have an abundance of ills. Where a servant murders hismaster, where a son murders his father, the causes do not lie between themorning and evening of one day. It took a long time for things to go so far. Itcame about because things that should have been stopped were not stopped soonenough.”2. [chapter_08.xhtml#rch8fn2] Most of the text depicts cheng fu as atrans-family phenomenon (cf. Hendrischke 1991); when family affairs arementioned they serve only as an example for the transmission of evil from onegeneration to another (TPJ 103.251). Since what the TPJ has to say on this pointis rather isolated it is often misunderstood, and cheng fu is frequently seen asrepresenting either family concerns or individual karmic retribution (see, forinstance, Maeda 2006). The origin of cheng fu is not so much individual guilt associety’s general lack of concern for heaven’s rules (TPJ 50.70) and dao‘sintentions (TPJ 58.96), that is, the departure of humankind from the simple andprimitive life of early antiquity. The crimes committed must be imagined as thefaults mentioned throughout the TPJ: for example, the killing of females,chastity, the digging of wells, and the concern for culture and ornament.3. [chapter_08.xhtml#rch8fn3] This is similar to what Confucius expects from hisdisciples: see Lun yu 7.8.4. [chapter_08.xhtml#rch8fn4] This editorial note introduces a second attempt todiscuss the matter of cheng fu. The preceding paragraph did not amount to acomplete question.5. [chapter_08.xhtml#rch8fn5] At this point, the editorial note interrupts anongoing argument, which is rare.6. [chapter_08.xhtml#rch8fn6] For the tangling of qi caused by the resentment ofmen who see themselves as maltreated, see section 41, note 45, above. TheCelestial Master argues that this resentment will go away once men have becomeaware of the fact that their sufferings are caused by wrongdoings that occurredin the past.7. [chapter_08.xhtml#rch8fn7] Wei 未 (not yet) must be corrected to mo 末(branch); see Yu 2001a: 63.8. [chapter_08.xhtml#rch8fn8] Bi 彼 (the other) must be read as bei 被 (tosuffer); see Yu 2001a: 63.9. [chapter_08.xhtml#rch8fn9] This passage dealing with the guarding of the onehas been quoted frequently. It can be found in the Taiping yulan (chap. 668), inthe Yunji qiqian (chap. 49), and also in modified form in the Chao. The conceptof “guarding the one” (shou yi 守一) is the TPJ’s most durable and perhaps mostprominent contribution to the Daoist tradition. The Celestial Master statesexplicitly that “guarding the one” is central to his doctrine:Should there be disbelief in my text you must show that it is in agreement withthe texts on guarding the one from former and present times. When organizedaccording to subject matter these texts provide proof for one another. (TPJ152.410)Guarding the one is the most efficient strategy, comparable in this respect tothe method of wu wei envisaged in the Laozi. Great promises are linked to itspractice: “If you know how to guard the one, the ten thousand activities arecompleted” (TPJ 134.369), or, in the words of the later taiping text SecretAdvice by the Wise Lord of the Scripture on Great Peace, “Guard the one withoutfail and activities are completed of their own accord” (TPJ p. 740).One of the major problems that the practice of guarding the one can overcome isthe inheriting and transmitting of evil as discussed in this section (for thiscf. Strickmann 2002: 43). As the Chao puts it:If you want to dissolve the blame inherited and passed on there is nothingbetter than guarding the one. If you continue to do this, heaven will have mercyon you. The one is the hawser of heaven and the root of the ten thousand beings.(TPJ p. 60, for section 48)The other important role played by shou yi is related to the search forlongevity:The essential teachings (dao) of former times as well as of today all say thatby guarding the one we can exist for a long time without getting old. Whensomeone knows how to guard the one we call this a doctrine (dao) that cannot besurpassed. Insofar as someone has a body, he is in constant unison with vitalspirits (jing shen 精神). The external figure is what accounts for death, andvital spirits account for life. When [external figure and vital spirits] areconstantly together, then there is good luck, but when [vital spirits] go, thereis misfortune. Without vital spirits there is death, with them there is life.Togetherness brings forth oneness. Thus you can exist long. Continue to damagethe vital spirits and they will depart, no longer assembling in your body.Instead, you will have them traveling about following your thoughts. Therefore,the wise men teach this [method of] guarding of the one when they say that wemust guard our person as a whole (shou yi shen 守一身). . . .Someone who guards theone truly brings it all together in one. He makes the vital spirits of humanlife completely content, guards them so that they don’t disperse, and thustranscends this world, becoming [like] father and mother of people filled withhonesty (liang min fu mu 良民父母), meeting with the ruler of great peace andbecoming beloved by the spirits and other numinous beings. (TPJ p. 716, Chao,part 9)So without shou yi, there is no longevity: “If a man does not guard the one, hewill not live” (TPJ p. 743, in the Taiping jing shengjun bizhi, the SecretAdvice by the Wise Lord).The above passage from the Chao helps to explain the meaning of “the one” thatis to be guarded. It stands here for togetherness and unification, in this caseof vital spirits and physical body. In this way, an individual also modelshimself after the original oneness of the cosmos. Other passages refer to thisoriginal state when they speak about the “unification of qi”:The three qi combined in one are the spiritual root. One of them is vitality(jing 精), the other is spirit, and the last is qi: these three, combined in oneposition (yi wei 一 位), are the basic qi of heaven, earth, and men. (TPJ p. 728,Chao, part 1)Regarding or treating different entities as one brings them back to theiroriginal form, before divisions or, as in the following passage, “structures”(li 理) were set up:One is from the time when primordial qi was pure; primordial qi had all togetherno structure, just as wind has no structure. So you can name it all together“one.” One congealed into heaven, and because heaven has above and below and theeight directions, it is ten. (TPJ 139.392; cf. TPJ p. 305, Chao, part 5)To this can be added what is said in the section at hand. It does not amount tomuch. Ontological or cosmological definitions are of little interest to thetaiping project. Bokenkamp (1993: 46) certainly has a point when he suggests thetranslation of “maintaining unity” for the term “guarding the one.” TheCelestial Master is happy to define the one as what is guarded in the practiceof guarding the one:“One” means that for dao to be standard we must begin with guarding the one.Someone who sticks to it without fail will become more enlightened day by day sothat even the greatest illusion (da mi 大迷) is dissolved. (TPJ 50.64)The same interest prevails in the Baopu zi, where the distinction between xuanyi玄一 (the mysterious one) and zhenyi 真 一 (the true one) is explained byillustrating the method of how xuanyi is preserved (Baopu zi neipian 18 “Dizhen” 地真; cf. Yoshioka 1967: 496 and Kohn 1989: 140f.).The practice of guarding the one involved color visualization:The practice of guarding the light of the one is the root of longevity. The tenthousand spirits come forth through the gate of brilliant light [as if theywere] to receive sacrifices. The moment when you guard the vital light of theone is the same as when fire gets started: you must eagerly guard it withoutfail. When it starts it is bright red, when it ends it is pure white, and for along time it is a bluish green. The light shines further than into the mostremote distance, and on its return it reigns over all as one, so that there isnothing inside [the body] that is not full of light. The hundred diseases areeliminated. We can call keeping it with unremitting effort a technique to attainten thousand years of age. The light involved in the method to keep the light ofthe one has all the brilliance of the rising sun and all the light it has atmidday. (TPJ p. 16, Chao, part 2)From the S 4226 table of contents we learn that the original sixth-century TPJcontained more material on the guarding of the one than has been transmitted.The term has been linked to the TPJ ever since Xiang Kai’s memorial (Hou Han shu30B.1082), where it is used to describe the Buddha’s frame of mind. The factthat it is used in the Xiang’er (3.15) in discussion of Laozi’s “bao yi” 抱 一(Laozi 10) also shows that the term was an integral element of early Daoistthought. In contrast to the TPJ’s Celestial Master, the Xiang’er emphasized thatobedience to precepts was the best way to “maintain unity,” and it saw a need todefend its understanding against “mistaken” opinions (Bokenkamp 1997: 89 and144f.), which we may interpret as another token of the prominence of the term.The Celestial Master approached the issue in the same rigidly formalistic mannerwith which he dealt with many central topics: distinctions are made between thekeeping of the one by a great, a medium, and a small man (TPJ 152.410), and alsoby a great, a medium, and a small worthy (TPJ 152.412). There is also an orderfrom one to five: it is asserted that someone who preserves the one will haveheavenly deities at his side; someone who preserves the two will be accompaniedby the deities of the earth; someone who preserves the three will be helped bydemons from the human world; and someone who preserves the four or five willhave only the protection issued by minor beings who convey nothing butunhappiness (TPJ p. 13, Chao, part 2).10. [chapter_08.xhtml#rch8fn10] The term cheng fu occurs throughout the text,including in sections not in the form of a dialogue between the Celestial Masterand Perfected (TPJ 179.534, layer B), but most of the information is nodifferent from what is hinted at in the section at hand. However, the followingpassage adds certain aspects:Instruction on inheriting and transmitting [evil]: Ill-omened qi was neverdispersed after the division between heaven and earth, or if it ever was, itsoon arose again.Why is this so?Now longevity is heaven’s greatest treasure. It is attributed to someone withvirtue and cannot be achieved by cheating. If you want to know this treasure,[let me tell you]: Should all beings in the six directions and the eight distantregions of heaven and earth be devoid of grief and be completely happy, theywould then achieve long life. If but one circumstance remains unresolved, thereis at once injury, death, and ruin.Some men work hard to do good in everything but the outcome is evil; othersvigorously try to do evil but good results. Whether they call themselves worthyhas nothing to do with it. If someone works hard to do good but in return farespoorly, this means that he has inherited and is passing on the mistakes made byhis ancestors. Rows of calamities from earlier and later times all come togetherto hurt him. If someone acts badly but receives benefits, this is due to thegreat merits that his ancestors accumulated with much effort and that now flowtoward him. Should his ancestors have achieved merit ten thousand times tenthousand–fold [punctuation by Luo 1996: 35], no misfortune could touch him, evenif there were plenty of it. This is so because past events have an impact onlater generations, who inherit [the deeds] of five [generations of] ancestors.One small cycle lasts ten generations, and then it starts again. Some peoplemight have done a little good but cannot remain tranquil. They are overwhelmedby the evil passed on by their ancestors and the calamities they have receivedand are passing on. They die in the middle of their life without children. Thisis truly grievous (yuan 冤).As far as receiving and transmitting [evil] is concerned, heaven has threedivisions. For emperors and kings it lasts for thirty thousand years, forofficials three thousand, and for the people over three hundred years. With allthis receiving and transmitting from one to the other, some lie prostrate andothers rise up. This can’t be separated from decay and prosperity as they occurin ruling over men. (TPJ p. 22, Chao, part 2)The text continues with a discussion of three grades of longevity. This issummarized as:If someone unendingly does good, he will surpass [these three degrees of]longevity and we say that he has transcended the world. If he does evil withoutend, he will not reach the three degrees of longevity but will die too early. Ifsomeone dies as a fetus or before reaching adulthood, this is called receivingand transmitting the ancestors’ mistakes without any fault of his own. (TPJ p.23, Chao, part 2)This explains why the fate of human beings does not necessarily follow fromtheir deeds.This passage consists of separate items. The problem is seen alternately asresiding in the general realm of humankind and in the private realm ofindividual morality. The introduction of ill-omened qi, the remark on everyone’shappiness, and the claim that the duration of cheng fu differs according toone’s social stratum points to cheng fu as a phenomenon that transcends familytradition. Most of the passage, however, describes the differences in individualfate as being caused by the different performance of previous family members aswell as (and, again, this is contradictory) by the moral status of theindividual. To combine these points of view is only possible when one assumes asan underlying theory that cheng fu is a common phenomenon, affecting every humanbeing, but that its intensity might differ with individual and familydifferences.While neither the term cheng fu nor the concept it stands for occurs in othertransmitted texts, archaeological material points to such a concept. It tells ofa burden from which men sought to be delivered. Liu Shaorui (1992: 112–15) hasshown that grave-securing writs from the Eastern Han dynasty share not onlycertain ideas with the TPJ, but also the way that these ideas are phrased. Thewrits demand that a lead figure be permitted to carry zhong fu 重負 in lieu of thedescendant, and also that the Great Spirit (da shen 大申) may dissolve zhong fu,which Liu sees in connection with TPJ 185.561 (layer B), where the Great Spirithelps deliver the adept from cheng fu. Liu (1992: 118) also shows that tu gong 土功 (construction work) and xian guan 縣官 (county offices) are used ingrave-securing writs as they are in the TPJ. Whether Liu’s identification ofzhong fu, difficult as this term is, with cheng fu is really acceptable isanother matter. What is certain is that similarities exist between the materialshe compares.The term fu ze 負貴, which is rendered by Donald Harper (2004) as “encumbered bydebt” (understanding ze as zhai 債), throws still another light on the phrase. Fuze occurs frequently in a number of illness-dispersing spells (Xuning bingjian序寧病簡) dating from 79 C.E. (cf. Rao Zongyi 1996 and Harper 2004) in the formula生人不負貴死人不負適, “May living people not be encumbered with debt, may dead people notbe penalized” (for instance, on the back of slip 226, Harper 2004: 234). Thesecond part of this formula, that is, the phrase siren wu shi 死人毋適, alsooccurring as siren bu fu shi, resembles a phrase that occurs frequently on thegrave-securing writs analyzed by Wu Rongzeng (1981: 57), which beg that the deadmight “be spared accusations and the living be relieved of all crimes” (sizhejie shi, shengren chu zuiguo 死者解適生人除罪過). The Xuning bingjian formula, with itsuse of fu (encumbered), casts an interesting light on cheng fu and mightactually explain this expression: what men have been, are presently, and will beencumbered with is the debt they owe heaven, or, when we consider section 61,heaven and earth. In the Xuning bingjian material studied by Harper the debtconcerns what men owe to spirits, for instance in the fulfillment of sacrificialobligations. For the TPJ this debt would consist of lack of attention toheaven’s commandments.11. [chapter_08.xhtml#rch8fn11] The summary says:This section instructs on the question of how in all affairs [evil] is receivedand transmitted and how qi is tangled up.SECTION 50. AN EXPLANATION OF THE MASTER’S DECLARATION1. [chapter_09.xhtml#rch9fn1] The received text has no section 49 or chapter 38.It moves directly from section 48 to section 50 and from chapter 37 to chapter39. The S 4226 Dunhuang manuscript gives “The method of guarding the one” (shouyi fa 守一法) as the title for both. For this reason, Espesset (2002a: 174) has puthere as a version of chapter 38 material that has been transmitted as anindependent text under the title Secret Advice by the Wise Lord of the Scriptureon Great Peace (Taiping jing shengjun bizhi, TPJ pp. 739–43; cf. Kohn 1993:194–97). This view is strengthened by Yoshioka’s (1967) account of the SecretAdvice, which sees it as closely connected to the Chao and thus to the TPJitself. Secret Advice consists mainly of smoothly composed four-characterphrases. Many are rhymed and include other rhetorical devices. The argumentationis elegant and the message clear. The style resembles some layer C passages. Itscontents resonate with certain TPJ passages on the “guarding of the one,” asWang Ming (TPJ, “Introduction,” pp. 15f.) has pointed out. He suggests thatLüqiu Fangyuan, whom he sees as author of the Taiping jing chao, is alsoresponsible for Secret Advice. I find it difficult to place this text here, inthe middle of part 3, which consists of layer A material. However, the Dunhuangtable of contents is to be taken seriously, and we must assume that this sectionof the sixth-century text dealt with meditation techniques. The Chao account ofpart 3 does not contain any discussion of “guarding the one.” It can be arguedthat this topic was too crucial to have been ignored by the digest and that theoriginal section 49 was already missing when the Chao was produced in the lateninth century.The Declaration is not in the received text. According to the titles recorded inS 4226, in the original text it was in part 1, chapter and section 20. The Chaocontains no trace of this section, but quotes the Declaration in full in part 3before an almost complete account of the Explanation, that is, of section 50.Wang Ming follows the Chao when he proposes that section 49 consisted of theDeclaration. The Declaration has also been transmitted in Gan Ji’s biography inthe Hunyuan sheng ji (chap. 7, pp. 17b–18a, by Xie Shouhao, published 1191) andagain in the Lishi zhen xian tidao tongjian (chap. 20, pp. 1b–2a, by Zhao Daoyi,fl. 1294–1307). It consists of thirteen seven-character phrases, which amount toninety-one characters. However, it is said to consist of only ninety: see line(m) and also the summary at the end. We can only assume that ninety wasconsidered to be a more meaningful figure than ninety-one.2. [chapter_09.xhtml#rch9fn2] See Kaltenmark 1979: 38–40.3. [chapter_09.xhtml#rch9fn3] See TPJ 212.679.4. [chapter_09.xhtml#rch9fn4] Cf. Espesset 2002a: 435–41.5. [chapter_09.xhtml#rch9fn5] “A person in harmony with heaven” is thedefinition given of a tian ren 天人 (man of heaven), as the passage at hand putsit, in an odd and perhaps corrupt passage of the Zhuangzi (64.23.77–79). Butsome of what the passage says is clear: “Someone who forgets men (wang ren 忘人)is a man of heaven. When honored he will not be pleased, when insulted he willnot be angry. He is so only because of being in harmony with heaven.” Zhuangzichap. 33 (90.33.3) ranks the tian ren before the shen ren 神人 and the zhi ren 至人.The term occurs only once more in the TPJ: eight ranks, from the celestial(expressed as “tian”) and the “earthly” down to the worthy, are called “men ofheaven\" (tian ren) because heaven likes to employ them (p. 223, Chao, part 4).6. [chapter_09.xhtml#rch9fn6] This means they are complete, a common meaning of“ten,” as explained below, and perhaps “coherent,” which is one meaning of“one.”7. [chapter_09.xhtml#rch9fn7] The title shen ren 神人, by which the Master hererefers to himself, is used throughout the Chao to indicate the Celestial Master.8. [chapter_09.xhtml#rch9fn8] “To take leave” is written with the same characteras “words,\" ci 辭.9. [chapter_09.xhtml#rch9fn9] This almost subitist approach is not within themainstream of taiping thought.10. [chapter_09.xhtml#rch9fn10] As explained in more detail in section 66, greatillusion 大迷 results from “frivolous and superficial” material.11. [chapter_09.xhtml#rch9fn11] The character zhi 止 is a way of writing zu 足(foot); see Shuo wen jie zi p. 173a, and Morohashi (1985) no. 37365 (cf. Yu2001a: 68).12. [chapter_09.xhtml#rch9fn12] One character put on top of the other; in hisaccount of shi 士, Xu Shen (ca. 55–ca. 149) quotes Confucius as having said thata man becomes an expert (shi) by pushing (tui 推) all ten diverse items to unitethem into one (Shuo wen jie zi p. 44a; cf. Serruys 1984: 660f.).13. [chapter_09.xhtml#rch9fn13] “Red” does not figure in the Declaration’s line(a). In stressing this color, the Explanation makes use of line (b). Lines (c)and (d) are also meant to explain each other, as are lines (f), (g), and (h).This might also hold true for the cryptic lines (j) and (k), which both have aconcrete entity as their point of departure.The Explanation’s way of dissecting and composing characters is an essentialelement of Han dynasty and later prognostic arts; cf. below, section 65, andDubs 1938/1955, vol. 3, p. 540.14. [chapter_09.xhtml#rch9fn14] Fire is the dominating phase and red is themajor color of the TPJ in that it is said to be heaven’s color (Chao, p. 219,part 4, and repeated on p. 647, part 7; the passage is quoted by Li Xian,annotating Hou Han shu 30B.1084). Wang Mang (45 B.C.E.–23 C.E.) had declaredthat the Han had ruled under the auspices of the phase fire (Loewe 1986: 738),and Emperor Guangwu (r. 25–57) made this official in 26 C.E. (Cheng 1985: 33).The following passage is close to the section at hand. It discusses the date atwhich the reforms at the outset of the era of great peace should be introduced.The Master says:Now is another beginning (geng shi 更始) of a great cycle (da zhou 大周) of the wayof heaven. From above and below pure Yang reigns over heaven and earth. So onemust urgently cut off all punishment and penalties. Heaven can be called spirit(tian zhe cheng shen 天者稱神), and so can Yang. For this reason heaven sendsspirit[-like beings] to reign over men. (TPJ 212.677)The student questions this proposition:May I please ask why it is that heaven’s dao is at present setting a primordialbeginning (yuan chu 元初) for its great cycle and moreover renewing thenumerological system (geng da shu 更大數) and putting the standard texts to thetest (kao zheng wen 考正文)?The answer is:The present [the Han period?] is the superior leader of what is grouped [read wu伍 for wu 五; see below] with Yang and is the beginning of what is grouped withfire. The utmost of fire in heaven above is the color of the sun and the moon[when they rise]. The red of fire shares its color with heaven; heaven’s coloris red, and fire is also red. We call fire spirit (shen). When heaven and spiritremain prosperous, they keep things in their original state. For this reason wesee the eleventh month as the time when heaven’s order is at its starting point(tian zheng 天正). Up in heaven it is the same. Therefore, the color of itsobjects is red: red is the sun when it begins to turn back. (TPJ 212.678)The student has further questions on this matter:I would like to know why Yang and fire are in one particular group (wu 伍).The answer:The qi of each phase has its own group, not just fire. Metal and fire are thetopmost groups, dominating the Red Emperor. Isn’t this why the CelestialDeclaration (tian ce wen 天策文) says “Bing 丙, wu 午, ding 丁, and si 巳 are theancestors, are the beginning”? Beginning is predecessor; it is head. Therefore,the writing says, “are the ancestors, are the beginning.” The beginning of allten thousand activities is their red-colored heart [as can be seen in plants].The heart on thorough reflection (dong zhao 洞照) knows things. Since Yang beginsin the middle of Yin, it also reflects thoroughly. For this reason water, whichis dark on the outside and bright within, reflects thoroughly. The center holdsthe vital essence of Yang. So Yang begins in the north, while Yin begins in thesouth. In the eleventh month it is warm below the ground, whereas in the fifthmonth it is cold. (TPJ 212.679; for an alternative reading of part of thispassage see Petersen 1990b: 28f.).From this it is clear that whoever governs under the color red is predestined toimplement great peace and that the eleventh month is the right time of the yearto introduce reforms.The passage links metal with fire. Another possible link, based on onegenerating the other, is established between wood and fire (TPJ 99.225).15. [chapter_09.xhtml#rch9fn15] The expression xing ci dao 行此道 (he walks on thisway) occurs four more times in this section in slightly varied form. It is rarein the rest of the text, and can only be found in section 57 ( see below p. 218)and in section 212 (p. 678), in a passage that refers to the Master’sdeclaration, as quoted above.16. [chapter_09.xhtml#rch9fn16] Bing and wu are equated with fire, according tothe Huainan zi, Bai hu tong, and other sources; see Eberhard 1970: 62. So, whenfire is seen as the dominating phase, they are indeed “at the beginning” and canbe called “ancestors.” The Declaration refers to the leading role of fire onlyin line (b), and only indirectly, referring to stems and branches fire isassociated with. The Explanation, however, dwells on this point. Its analysisfollows an established pattern, as presented for instance in the Huainan zi. InMajor’s (1993: 88f.) translation of the “Solar Nodes”:After fifteen more days, [the handle of the Dipper at midnight] points to si 巳.This is the Lesser Fullness node. Its sound is like [the pitch pipe] GreatBudding. After fifteen more days [the handle of the Dipper at midnight] pointsto bing 丙. This is the Grain in Ear node. Its sound is like [the pitch pipe]Great Regulator. After fifteen more days, [the handle of the Dipper at midnight]points to wu 午. Yang qi reaches its maximum. Thus, it is said that theforty-sixth day [after the beginning of summer] marks the Summer Solstice[node]. Its sound is like [the pitch pipe] Yellow Bell. After fifteen more days,[the handle of the Dipper at midnight] points to ding 丁. This is the Lesser Heatnode. Its sound is like [the pitch pipe] Great Regulator. After fifteen moredays [the handle of the Dipper at midnight] points to wei 未 . . . . This is theGreat Heat node. Its (chromatic) note is Great Budding (Huainan zi 3 “Tian wen”天問, pp. 13a–b).From this we learn that bing and wu represent the highest amount of Yang intheir respective groups, and that ding stands for the first appearance of Yin.It is followed by wei as the first branch position (no. 8) with some Yincontent. When used to define years, the combinations bingwu and dingwei indicatedangerous years (Morohashi [1985] no. 35.12). The Hunyuan sheng ji (7.17b)quotes the TPJ as reading wei instead of si. However, the received text with theChao and the Lishi zhen xian tidao tongjian (20.1b) reads si, which does notcontradict the general picture in that, like wei, si also contains a certainspurious amount of Yin. Si is also the reading in TPJ 212.679, where the sevencharacters are quoted.17. [chapter_09.xhtml#rch9fn17] This term is here used to establishchronological order, as in the list of “Three Majestic Rulers, Five Emperors,Three Kings, Five Hegemons” (TPJ 102.236). In this way, the “Three MajesticRulers” refers to the beginnings of government, when government was one withheaven (TPJ 204.645). But, from a more distant point of view, this period iscalled middle, not early, antiquity (TPJ 81.206), as if in the earliest periodno rulers were needed.18. [chapter_09.xhtml#rch9fn18] Luo (1996: 117) suggests that zi 子 and jin 巾 areelements of zi 字 (character), which seems to be plausible. Kaltenmark suggeststhat we might here be confronted with elements of the characters for “(Yellow)Turbans 黃巾” and for “(Zhang) Jue 張角.”In a subitist vein, this passage stresses the recital of texts, as if thesituation the text envisages could be reached through reading the appropriatetext. In the TPJ this approach is rare but not unique; see above, note 9.Recitals are seen as influential. Reciting the wrong texts endangers life andbrings about confusion (TPJ 66.164; 100.229f.). On the other hand, the arrivalof great peace is accompanied by the recital of the right scripture (TPJ66.165). The following statement is almost as strong as what is said in thepassage at hand:If the whole empire were to recite and read the standard texts, heaven’s qiwould be received and great peace would arrive. (TPJ 78.192)This resembles the ritual recital of the Laozi by adherents of the CelestialMaster movement (see the Introduction, above).19. [chapter_09.xhtml#rch9fn19] So the receiving and transmitting of evil wouldcome to an end.20. [chapter_09.xhtml#rch9fn20] This is a quotation from the first Yi jinghexagram: “Nine at the beginning means the dragon is hidden: do not act!” Hereit means that the celestial book, as great as a dragon, should not yet be shownto the world.21. [chapter_09.xhtml#rch9fn21] The received text’s version of kan 欲 (humble)must be understood with the Chao as kan 坎, the diagram.22. [chapter_09.xhtml#rch9fn22] The year of the first stem (jia 甲) and the firstbranch (zi 子), on the day of the winter solstice, was seen as the point oforigin (see Kaltenmark 1979: 39). In the words of the TPJ:Jiazi is the starting point for heaven’s order (jiazi tian zheng ye 甲子天正也). Atthe winter solstice, the sun begins to go back to its root (ben 本). Yi 乙 [secondstem] chou 丑 [second branch] is the starting point for the order of earth, whenplants (wu 物) sprout (bu gen 布根). Bing 丙 [third stem] yin 寅 [third branch] isthe starting point for human order, when men begin to rise early in the morning[pingdan 平旦], open the doors, and go to work. These three set the beginning forthe start of life for heaven, earth, and men; they are the sprouts and roots(gen 根 and ben 本) for plants. (TPJ 212.676)This agrees with what commentators have seen as the meaning of san zheng 三正 (thethree starting points or three orders), as used in the Shu jing (“Gan shi” 甘誓,p. 155c).23. [chapter_09.xhtml#rch9fn23] As Luo (1996: 118) says, this must be thesoutheast.24. [chapter_09.xhtml#rch9fn24] South is the direction fire comes from.25. [chapter_09.xhtml#rch9fn25] As Kaltenmark (1979: 39) has pointed out, theoccurrence of xuanjia 玄甲 links this passage to another part of the text, wherethe student raises a question similar to what is discussed in the passage athand:After we have received the Celestial Master’s serious instructions and thoroughadmonitions, when should we make public these writings, writings that put a stopto malevolence and fraud and promote the dao of heaven and earth?In an yisi 乙巳 year [in 16 B.C.E., Jie Guang and Li Xun propagated a taipingscripture; in 165 C.E., another yisi year, Xiang Kai did the same], they weretransmitted to men traveling in government service (youke 郵客) and were thusdistributed. Later on, they were made public each year at xuanjia 玄甲, which iswhen heaven is first in a jia position, in the first week (xun 甸), just whereprimordial qi starts from. The writings, from beginning to end, are to betransferred to the country’s leaders (guojia 國家) so that they will dissolve theevil that from the very beginning of heaven and earth has been received andtransmitted.Which characters are to be transferred (bifu 比付)?These teachings in their written form contain masses of characters. Although youyourself know them in depth, you must not let the supreme harmony of majesticheaven and dao of first rank leak out. Go about transmitting them to thosecapable of receiving (neng wang fu 能往付) and analyzing them. When it comes to(bidao 比到) xuanjia, should there be someone who is exasperated [fenfen 憤憤—aquality that Confucius (Lun yu 7.8) considered essential in a student] searchingfor my writings, then let him first have material on “guarding the one” and “thefrivolous and superficial” [as used in section 72: “avoid the frivolous andsuperficial\"].We can only conjecture whether there is any historical background to theseprocedures. In any case, the student sees the contradiction in the Master’swords:They have already been transmitted to men traveling in government service and toexperts in vitality techniques (youke fang shi 郵客方士) so that they can submitthem to a ruler of perfect virtue. What does that mean?The Master answers that because the implementation of reforms failed, the menwho had received the writings must not have been the right men. Thus the processof distribution goes on, and with this also the need to pay attention to xuanjiadates (TPJ 165.459f.).The expression xuanjia zi, used a few lines further down, is probably anabbreviation of xuanjia jiazi. Luo suggests (1996: 787) that the introduction ofxuanjia (dark jia) refers to the darkness of the north, so that a year’s first,most “northern,\" jia date would be called “dark.”26. [chapter_09.xhtml#rch9fn26] The terms ji 紀 and gang 綱, “detailed and generalrules” when combined, indicate all administrative activities. See, for example,Shu jing, “Wu zi zhi ge” 五子之歌, p. 157a. The Declaration’s division of governmentinto a lower and a higher stratum agrees with this terminology.27. [chapter_09.xhtml#rch9fn27] Since both are situated in the north, as Luo(1996: 119) points out.28. [chapter_09.xhtml#rch9fn28] This passage belongs to the large number ofplant and growth references in the TPJ. Here, the celestial text’s firstexistence is juxtaposed to the very beginnings of life. Time passes between theproduction of a text and men’s awareness of its existence, as it does betweenthe beginnings of a plant’s growth and its first physical traces above- ground.However, much of the information given here remains unclear, in particular theinterweaving of the jiazi nomenclature with the term xuanjia.29. [chapter_09.xhtml#rch9fn29] This narrow definition of the word “man” isunusual. It is in accord with the political orientation of this section, whichshows much consideration for the ruling dynasty.30. [chapter_09.xhtml#rch9fn30] Wang Ming maintains the reading dai 殆 (danger),following the received text and the Chao, but states that it means dai 給 (tocheat), as the Lishi zhen xian tidao tongjian reads. In the preceding Chaoversion of the Declaration (that is, chapter 38), he has corrected the text ofthe Chao accordingly.31. [chapter_09.xhtml#rch9fn31] The line of the Declaration that is here underdiscussion seems to hint at the role of confessions in the healing of illness.Such hints are rare in the TPJ. It is well established, however, that in thesecond-century Daoist community in Sichuan illness was seen as being caused bymoral deficiency and healing involved confessions, which had to be true in orderto be effective.32. [chapter_09.xhtml#rch9fn32] Section 50, as well as the Chao version, omitsle mo 樂莫 before le hu 樂乎, thus reducing the phrase to five characters. Wang Minghas emended the text on the basis of the Lishi zhen xian tidao tongjian.This reference to Chang’an and to the “Kingly Mother of the West” resembles theuse of Chang’an and the west in second-century C.E. grave-securing writs: “Theliving belong to Chang’an in the west, the dead to Mount Tai in the east” and“The living belong to Chang’an, the dead to Mount Tai” (see Wu Rongzeng 1981:58). This praise for the capital Chang’an can also be seen as yet anotherattempt to praise the Han rulers. It was the capital during most of the firstHan dynasty, until the northwest came under attack in the first century C.E. Itagain became the capital in 190 C.E., when the boy emperor Xian (r. 189–220) wasforced to leave his capital, Luoyang, for about six years and set up court inthe west. Wu Rongzeng argues that it became “the place for the living” duringthe first centuries of Han rule, and that the role it plays in thesecond-century C.E. writs is reminiscent of an earlier period. The expression“long-lasting security” occurs throughout the TPJ. The virtuous lord enjoys it(TPJ 132.364), as do all beings (78.192). It is something desired by rulers.Chang an can also function as a transitive verb with shen (self) as its object(TPJ p. 303, Chao, part 5; 167.467). Long-lasting security can be achieved for astate if officials show moral responsibility (shan; TPJ 78.191) and the wishesof heaven and earth are respected (TPJ 154.433).33. [chapter_09.xhtml#rch9fn33] “Exclamatory” would be the word for hu.34. [chapter_09.xhtml#rch9fn34] The Queen Mother of the West figures prominentlyin Han dynasty sources; see Cahill 1993: 17–23.35. [chapter_09.xhtml#rch9fn35] In the second century C.E. it was fashionable topropose semantic links between words on the basis of their phonetic similarity,if we are to judge by the methods used by Xu Shen in his Shuo wen jie zi (seeRao Zongyi 1972 and Petersen 1990c).36. [chapter_09.xhtml#rch9fn36] Luo 1996: 121 explains that these “spirits” arebody spirits.37. [chapter_09.xhtml#rch9fn37] The expression “experts in vitality techniques\"(fang shi) occurs only here and in the passage quoted above from section 165,which has much in common with the passage at hand. What section 165 seems to sayis that experts in vitality techniques received the Master’s doctrine,distributed it, and did not bring about great peace or a great peace movement.Therefore, Master and disciples must now try again. As Anne Cheng (2001: 108f.)puts it, fang shi were one group of experts who competed for influence at theHan court and in society at large. The Ru (Confucianists, here translated as“educated” or “learned”) were another such group.38. [chapter_09.xhtml#rch9fn38] The wu wei wen 無為文 can refer to the Laozi, froma philosophical point of view. However, the Dongxian zhuan (see Yunji qiqian110.8b; cf. Bumbacher 2000: 394–99; the text, now lost, is of Shangqing or UpperClarity origin) mentions a wu wei taiping zhi dao, so the phrase could just beanother word for the material promoted by the TPJ’s Celestial Master.The meaning of wu wei in the TPJ is not easy to define. There are passages whereit must be understood as “nonintervention,” as, for instance, in section 44 (p.46) and when used together with chui gong 垂拱 (to withdraw from business) (TPJ p.307, Chao, part 5; p. 689, Chao, part 8). In other contexts, as, for instance,in the expression yuan qi wu wei (uncontrived, just like primordial breath) (TPJ107.282), the TPJ seems to use wu wei in the Xiang’er‘s understanding of wei as偽, “to fabricate” (Bokenkamp 1997: 51f.). This is also the case when wu wei isseen as a way to transcend the world, as, for instance, at TPJ 136.381 and191.588. There is, moreover, a passage in layer C material that refers directlyback to Laozi 37—wu wei zhe wu bu wei ye 無為者無不為也—and goes on to say that thismeans to return to the beginning or the “root”:Heaven and earth stem from Yin and Yang. Master the technique of wu wei and youcan become complete; make the root go away and branches come near you and daowill be impaired. (TPJ 168.470)This is accompanied by the picture of a meditation hall. The passage at hand canthus be understood as referring to texts that are not “fabricated” but devolvedfrom heaven or its messengers.“Coherence” (xiang ying 才目應) is the criterion for trustworthiness, as opposed,we might say, to internal contradiction in personal statements (see section 43)as well as in texts (TPJ 78.191).39. [chapter_09.xhtml#rch9fn39] With the Chao I read wen instead of wei 委, sothat the text reads wen zi fu 文字符. The Chao mistakenly reads wen shou fu 文守符.40. [chapter_09.xhtml#rch9fn40] This is the end of the Explanation. Threeisolated passages follow in this section and the following section 51.41. [chapter_09.xhtml#rch9fn41] Luo 1996: 122 quotes Bai hu tong 6 “Bi yong” 辟雍,p. 255, as evidence that the wise men of the past were all known to have hadteachers.42. [chapter_09.xhtml#rch9fn42] It is part of the ritual of teaching andlearning for the student to question the legitimacy of his contribution to theproceedings. TPJ 44.42 sets forth a similar argument against speaking. In otherinstances it is seen as an offense for a student not to speak when the Masterinvites him to do so; see TPJ 54.80.43. [chapter_09.xhtml#rch9fn43] The Zhuangzi (70.25.10) says that the wise manwho understands all takes heaven for his teacher.44. [chapter_09.xhtml#rch9fn44] This sentence can help to affirm that the orderof sections in the received text resembles a real curriculum of instruction, asthe preceding sections 47 and 48 do indeed deal with the transmission of evil.45. [chapter_09.xhtml#rch9fn45] There is a tradition of discussing the extent towhich a ruler is personally to be blamed for events and can be expected torectify things; see Tjan 1949/1952, vol. 1, pp. 302f., note 194. The backgroundfor this is in the statement of Tang in the Shu jing (“Tang gao” 揚語, p. 162b),in Legge’s (1960: 189f.) translation: “When guilt is found anywhere in you whooccupy the myriad regions, it must rest on me. When guilt is found in me, theone man, it will not attach to you, who occupy the myriad regions.” In contrastto this, the Celestial Master tends to attribute less importance to the ruler.The use of the word cheng 承 is a good example of this, in that Bai hu tong 2“Hao” 號, p. 45, identifies what is inherited by (cheng) later generations withthe emperor’s conduct and deeds, while the TPJ sees what is inherited andtransmitted as resulting from the conduct of all.46. [chapter_09.xhtml#rch9fn46] This passage contains a few details that add alittle more precision to cheng fu. Cheng is explained as the aspect of the termoriented toward the past, and fu as oriented toward the future. The phenomenonof cheng fu is compared to a contagious disease.47. [chapter_09.xhtml#rch9fn47] The summary says:This section explains the ninety characters of the Master’s Declaration.SECTION 51. THE TRUE CONTRACT1. [chapter_10.xhtml#rch10fn1] Jiechu 解除 (to heal) is also the word for“exorcism” and the title of Lun heng chapter 75. It is what needs to be done tocheng fu before a person can be saved (see TPJ 179.534, layer B; cf. Espesset2002b: 40).2. [chapter_10.xhtml#rch10fn2] So right and wrong cannot be decided through theconduct of an argument but lie beyond, in the results of an action. To prove astatement trustworthy the Master refers to the future, that is, he demandsbelief, just as a physician who proposes a certain cure does.3. [chapter_10.xhtml#rch10fn3] Yu (2001b: 469) sees this phrase as a question inthe form of verb—negation—verb, and he points out that this form is notregularly used in Han dynasty material. Another example can be found at TPJ66.158.4. [chapter_10.xhtml#rch10fn4] For this expression cf. TPJ p. 712, Chao, part 9:Heaven’s document or “contract” (quan wen 券文) was only made public when men wereno longer able to understand heaven’s intentions by properly observing naturaland social phenomena; cf. also section 63 (p. 140), where quan shu 券書 arementioned together with He tu and Luo shu, that is, with the charts and textsbrought forth by the Yellow River and the Luo. While quan occurs in the meaningof “contract” in section 65 (see below), it is not clear whether its usage inthe passage at hand and in particular in section 63 allows the conclusion thatthe Master here deals with a contract between heaven and men similar to thatdrawn up with deities with regard to the healing of illness, the fate of thedeceased, and the use of soil for burials (see Harper 2004). We may, however,assume that the use of the word quan is meant to remind listeners of thesecontracts and to thereby stress that the contents of the document in questionare binding.5. [chapter_10.xhtml#rch10fn5] The expression xia fang 下方 is not clear. Iunderstand fang 方 (square) as fang 放 (to place), so the Master here advisesstudents in which order they should collate his teachings.6. [chapter_10.xhtml#rch10fn6] The summary says:This section talks about signs of trust, how to compare writings, and the truecontract.SECTION 52. HOW TO WORK HARD TO DO GOOD1. [chapter_11.xhtml#rch11fn1] I read bu 不 (not) for da 大 (big) and understandsheng 勝 here as it must be understood in the next sentence, that is, as “tocontrol.”2. [chapter_11.xhtml#rch11fn2] For some men the length of life is predestined:Even before their birth, while still in the womb, some men on this earth havetheir personal and family name on the registers of those who won’t die. (TPJ182.552, layer B) Such men are, however, exceptional. The Celestial Master’sstudents are not among them; they will be attributed extra years for the servicethey have rendered to heaven (TPJ 41.34). In general, good deeds were said toinfluence the length of life, as explained below in this section and in section182 (layer B). When Ge Hong devised immortality techniques for the educatedgentleman who studies the classics he followed more than just his personalinterest.3. [chapter_11.xhtml#rch11fn3] One of the Master’s attempts to define“longevity” (cf. Kaltenmark 1979: 41f.) is the following:When heaven provides men with life, it follows its own rules and models (ge fa格法). Individual life derived from heaven and earth consists of thirty years,just as heaven and earth, sun and moon are interlocked with each other. What isextra is a leap unit. So what goes beyond individual life amounts to beingtranscendent (xian ren 仙人). Of all the years destined by heaven the highest formof longevity measures one hundred and twenty years, earthly longevity measuresone hundred years, human longevity eighty, the hegemons’ sixty, and thelongevity of the neighborhood group of five (wu 仵) measures fifty years. Belowthat, life and death are not of a fixed size, but everyone suffers from thedisaster of inherited and transmitted evil (cheng fu zhi zai ze 承負之 災責). (TPJ p.464, Chao, part 6; cf. also p. 723, Chao, part 1)4. [chapter_11.xhtml#rch11fn4] Here, as opposed to section 46, hun and bo areused in a nondistinct fashion. This is also the way the Zuo zhuan (Duke Zhao,twenty-fifth year, p. 2107a), for example, mentions them: they both giveliveliness to a person, and both linger around the corpse for a while, possiblyin the “shape of an evil apparition,” in the words of James Legge (1960: 618,translating Duke Zhao, seventh year, p. 2050b). But at some point their waysmust part, if we are to trust the Huainan zi dialogue between hun and bo (chap.16 “Shuo shan” 説山, 1a–b). Brashier (1996: 127–38) calls the dualistic approachto hun and bo spirit scholastic and argues convincingly that the belief putforth in the section at hand—that at death, both vanish into the ground—waswidespread.To properly evaluate this passage it is useful to look at Confucius’s idea ofhuman growth from the age of fifteen until the age of sixty, or at the frameworkof Confucian-oriented biographical writings, in which interest in life’s “higheraims” is often said to become manifest in early youth. Confucius’s theoreticalappraisal of family life is in contrast to the scant attention his teachings payto its practical aspects. Instead, Confucius sees a human being’s development asintellectual. Taiping-oriented human beings differ: the course of their lives isdominated by concern, or we could call it love, for their family.5. [chapter_11.xhtml#rch11fn5] The registers kept in the netherworld or inheaven are of great interest in layer B, which centers on how to becometranscendent; their accuracy is mentioned as a threat (TPJ 179.531f.) but alsoas a promise (TPJ 179.538).6. [chapter_11.xhtml#rch11fn6] This change of topic is abrupt and leaves theprevious topic unfinished. The “four constraints” have not yet been fullyexplored.7. [chapter_11.xhtml#rch11fn7] The relationship between goodness and longevityhas many facets. While there is hardly a passage in the text that would depictlongevity as being achieved outside moral restraints, it is not often statedthat goodness in itself leads to long life. The connection between the two isless direct. This can be seen from the following passage, which discusses aruler whose personal goodness is said to attract good officials, who will inturn prolong his life:Many officials of early antiquity were transcendent and lived long lives andcould thus help their lord to long life. In middle antiquity, many knew how tohold on to dao and virtue and could thus help their lord to live without anyworries. In late antiquity, there are many fools who don’t know the truedoctrine (dao) and who make their lord quite foolish. (TPJ 155.436)8. [chapter_11.xhtml#rch11fn8] Zheng qi 正氣 (standard qi) is a word for thenatural, unperturbed state of things. It can be rediscovered if lost, andreinstalled together with the qi of peace (ping; TPJ 209.668). It makes the sun,the moon, and the stars shine brightly, the wind and rain come at the propertime, Yin and Yang cooperate, and the ten thousand beings and plants find theirplace (TPJ 208.662). Evil deeds, even if they have only partial effect, destroyit (TPJ 134.375; 60.109). The more of such qi the better:If true dao and virtue were ample there would be lots of upright qi. Inconsequence, few men would suffer from illness and many would live long lives.(TPJ 63.139)Its opposite is “wicked qi,” which haunts malefactors even in afterlife.9. [chapter_11.xhtml#rch11fn9] The Master reminds us that natural disasters areheaven’s reaction to men’s trespasses. Since men remained unaware of their ownwrongdoings they did not willingly accept the punishment they were afflictedwith. Their resentment increased the amount of evil they had created and themisery they had to suffer.10. [chapter_11.xhtml#rch11fn10] “Shallow advice” refers to “mistaken” opinionsabout moral conduct (TPJ 103.251), the evaluation of textual material (TPJ132.356), and the attitude toward ominous events (TPJ 204.639). Here theparagraph on “shallow advice” corresponds to the “good counsel” of the followingparagraph. Its polemics are directed against nonbelievers, that is, men whodon’t believe that moral conduct is the basis for health. This is in contrast tothose men who give or accept proper advice and who “never cease studying,”presumably studying Celestial Master material. When we look for “mistaken”opinions on death and afterlife, passages in the Liezi come to mind, which don’tdepict the netherworld as a place for retribution.11. [chapter_11.xhtml#rch11fn11] Shan qi 善氣 and e qi 惡氣, “good and wicked qi,”are a pair, as are standard or upright and evil qi (zheng qi 正氣 and xie qi 牙氣;see TPJ p. 648, Chao, part 7). Shan qi brings success (shanshi 事; see TPJ p.642, Chao, part 7).12. [chapter_11.xhtml#rch11fn12] The Chao adds wei shan 為善 (to do good), thusmaking the text tidy.13. [chapter_11.xhtml#rch11fn13] It was assumed that the ancients had a longlife span; see Lun heng 56 “Qi shi” 齊世, p. 803, and Huangdi neijing suwen 1“Shang gu tian zhen lun” 上古天真論, p. 2a; cf. Luo 1996: 132f. This belief is alsoevident in the long reigns attributed to the mythological rulers of the past.14. [chapter_11.xhtml#rch11fn14] Spirit is explained as being “something thatchanges without ever assuming form and shape and that is never exhausted” (TPJ156.439). Thus the process of picturing body deities is called the “method ofwhat is without form and shape” (wu xing xiang zhi fa 無形象之法) (TPJ 109.293). Theexpression is rare. It occurs only once in the Yunji qiqian (2.4a) in adescription of aspects of the original, primordial chaos.15. [chapter_11.xhtml#rch11fn15] The summary says:In this section the Celestial Master warns that men who don’t work hard duringtheir lifetime will be held responsible after death as hun spirits for thereception and transmission [of evil].This is an adequate summary. The section deals with the continuity of “moralissues” beyond life, although for a definition of “good\" (shan) we must lookelsewhere in the text.SECTION 53. HOW TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN ROOT AND BRANCHES1. [chapter_12.xhtml#rch12fn1] The treatment of “constraints” in section 52 hasshown that the student is encouraged to move inductively toward a certain levelof abstraction, which allows guidelines to be formulated without going intospecifics. So at this stage he should already have learned that “few” must bethe answer.2. [chapter_12.xhtml#rch12fn2] This is one way of reading Laozi 42.3. [chapter_12.xhtml#rch12fn3] Here the Chao reduces the argument beyondrecognition: “Now when heaven rejoices in happiness it will let (read shi ling使令 for shi jin 使今) the ten thousand beings on earth rejoice in happiness,although earth is the one who nourishes. If it is good, so too will be thepeople who inhabit it.” This eliminates the hint of a possible disagreementbetween heaven and earth, which makes what the Celestial Master saysinteresting. Whether the Chao’s reading stems from conscious correction or fromnegligence we cannot tell.4. [chapter_12.xhtml#rch12fn4] The problem of “too many embellishments” is ofparticular concern in this part of the text. Duo duan 多端 are also mentioned insections 44 and 45 and are contrasted, as here, to “root” and a simplificationof government.5. [chapter_12.xhtml#rch12fn5] The Laozi deals with the metaphysical place of“root,” expressed as ben 本 (Laozi 26; 39) or gen 根 (Laozi 6; 16; 26; 59). Theimage of root and branches played a major role in early Chinese discourse. Benwas understood to mean agriculture, as opposed to mo (branch), which referred toall other economic activities (see Shi ji 10.428). The Celestial Master followedsuit: For him, “root” (ben gen in the passage at hand) is in a general sense“the beginning”:The noble root at the beginning of heaven and earth is the origin of qi. If youwish to achieve great peace, you must keep the root in mind. (TPJ p. 12, Chao,part 2)The unity of the three, which plays a role in this section, can be seen as“root”:Scholars must practice what these writings say and discover their root (gen).Their root, or their ancestor (ben zong 本宗), lies in taking the unity of threeas the guiding principle (san yi wei zhu 三一為主; as a TPJ quotation [\"part 1, no.1\"] in Daojiao yishu 2 and Yunji qiqian 6, see TPJ p. 9).As becomes clear from what is said in sections 44 (p. 46) and 50 (p. 64), “root”is a certain state or quality that can be lost through misguided behavior. Thisloss has disastrous consequences, including the problem of inherited evil. Thecorruption of textual material is another of its manifestations. In the past,all was well because standard texts were relied on; this proves that:standard texts and standard sayings are the standard root (zheng genben) ofheaven, earth, men, and the ten thousand plants and beings. (TPJ 152.416)This is why rulers are expected to supervise the preservation and collection oftexts.This understanding of “root” prevails throughout the text. In this respect, theroot is opposed to the branches: “discard the root and stick to the branches”and you will fail (TPJ 107.284; also 168.470, layer C). This image isoccasionally modified by introducing a “center,” the trunk:Stick to the root and you will see it all, stick to the trunk and you will seehalf of it, stick to the branches and you won’t be able to return to the method(dao) of self-reflection. (TPJ 107.284; similar passages p. 720, Chao, part 1and 132.361)Another aspect of the root is its togetherness with the branches. The welfare ofthe branches depends on the root (TPJ 192.593). The two are related to eachother as teacher and disciple (TPJ p. 308, Chao, part 5). Thus, concern for theroot strengthens the branches (TPJ 186.569).6. [chapter_12.xhtml#rch12fn6] Zhang ju 章句 were a form of annotation popularamong Han dynasty scholars. The Celestial Master argues that they were verbose(TPJ 152.420) and superficial (TPJ 106.277f.), but he also attributes to them ahigh rank compared to other textual material. The term occurs in the Han shu yiwen zhi and must have been prominent enough in the early Han period to have beenused in a pejorative manner in Han shu biographies (see Morohashi [1985] no.25761.45–48).7. [chapter_12.xhtml#rch12fn7] The corruption of texts is seen as parallelingthe increase in inherited evil, so that the history of written material reflectssocial history:Standard texts have their root in what heaven and earth feel, they safeguard andstructure primordial qi. When antiquity’s wise writings appeared, theyinvestigated the characters of the original standard [texts]. All that wastaught was coherent and the subtle sayings were explained. All this was asdemanded by primordial qi. Esoteric sayings (mi ci 密辭) came second, and in thirdplace were chapter and verse commentaries. Next came the creation of frivolousand superficial writings. In the fifth place there were divisions of opinion,and these were maintained stubbornly. Then deceptive texts were produced.Chapter and verse commentaries retain a certain respect for their root. Whatcomes after them is unhealthy. It diverts heaven and earth from their course andcauses emperors and kings to suffer bitterly without end. This is exactly thereason why [we] don’t really obtain order. Luckily you want to respond toheaven’s grace and repay heaven’s great achievements. Heaven doesn’t want men tobe involved with products of shallow talent and mannered craftsmanship. It wantsmen to get together and put these texts in order, and thus avoid confusion. (TPJ78.190; cf. Hachiya 1983: 51f.)The passage argues that the world’s problems can be mended through maintainingthe correctness of texts. It describes how all the texts are to be collected andthen proceeds:To explain [what you have collected and collated] is what we mean by making achapter and verse commentary. This grasps the intentions of true dao. We may saythat to collect and explain texts dissolves [or “explains\"] heaven’s worries anddrives great illness away. We may also say that it abolishes earth’s sufferings,allows emperors and kings to go on [spiritual] journeys and to find favor withheaven, and helps each of the ten thousand beings to find its place. (TPJ78.191)This identifies writing about an issue with understanding it as well as withmending the problem. Certain types of texts are thus seen to represent a certainstyle of government, as discussed in section 41. The hierarchical order of textsand of political systems is said to be in correlation, and thus the distortionof textual material becomes a symptom of political and social corruption. Justas corruption of a text reaches a certain point at which the text will be lostunless it is rewritten, so too the world can become so depraved that it cannotbe redeemed.8. [chapter_12.xhtml#rch12fn8] The expression shi tian dao ziran zhi xing ye是天道自然之性也 characterizes the preceding statement as a priori, that is, not basedon external grounds.9. [chapter_12.xhtml#rch12fn9] Someone who is able to divine correctly ismorally superior. A man whose prognoses are always correct can serve emperorsand kings; one needs to get nine out of ten right to serve a feudal lord; witheight out of ten right, one can serve men in general. The diviner needsspiritual help. Whether he receives it or not depends on his personal merit:To obtain the best warning one must ask spirits to predict events. Whenpredictions are always true, one’s method agrees with the spirits of heaven.When nine out of ten are true, it agrees with the earth’s spirits, and wheneight out of ten are true, it agrees with the spirits of men. Predictions areuseless if the result is worse. Someone might get it 100 percent right when hefirst ventures to consult the spirits but less and less right as time goes on.[This means] he is put on trial in the way (dao) of spirits who make him get itwrong. When this happens he [must] rejuvenate himself, straighten out histhinking, and be of vital goodness without any bad intentions. (TPJ 152.413f.)His predictions will then again prove to be 100 percent right. Divination thusresembles the production of texts; its accuracy signifies a proper attitude. Thepassage at hand confirms this point when it argues that divination should not beundertaken carelessly and unnecessarily.The passage doesn’t tell us what type of divination the Master is referring to.Considering his frequent references to the Yi jing we may assume that he meanspopular Han dynasty techniques that make use of yarrow stalks, numerology, andYi jing passages; cf. Loewe 1981: 46–50. It is difficult to find material in thetext that could contribute in some detail to Kalinowski’s (2003) project ondivination in medieval China.10. [chapter_12.xhtml#rch12fn10] This is common knowledge for the CelestialMaster: see TPJ 139.391 and 398. In this respect, earth (TPJ 129. 335) and menresemble heaven:I would like to know why the number of heaven is exactly one.One goes back to the time when primordial qi was pure; altogether, primordial qihad no structure, just as wind has no structure. Therefore, you can name it alltogether “one.” One congealed into heaven and, because heaven has above andbelow and the eight directions, it is ten. There are also the five directions,each with its own Yin and Yang, so their figure is ten. Moving downward it comesto rest as earth. Once it rests there, all numerical figures come about throughten. Thus man, who resembles heaven’s cipher, is born after ten months. (TPJ139.392)The introduction of numerical figures is meant to explain the development of andcooperation between diverse entities. Another structure appears from a threefoldoccurrence of the five phases: “The figure of heaven is five, that of earth isfive, and so is that of man” (TPJ p. 217, Chao, part 4).11. [chapter_12.xhtml#rch12fn11] As Huainan zi 3 “Tian wen” 天問, p. 12b puts it,in Major’s (1993: 88) translation, “When the (handle of the) Dipper points to zi(at midnight), it is the Winter Solstice (node).”12. [chapter_12.xhtml#rch12fn12] It is situated in the east; see Huainan zi3.31a.13. [chapter_12.xhtml#rch12fn13] Yu (2001a: 76) quotes the Shuo wen jie zi (p.1312a) to explain that hai 盡 is a pictograph of a man and a woman in embrace.14. [chapter_12.xhtml#rch12fn14] The character ren 任 (in office) is correctlyunderstood by Luo (1996: 136) as ren 妊 (pregnant).15. [chapter_12.xhtml#rch12fn15] The “three stages” are, with Luo (1996: 136),those of hai 盡, ren 壬, and zi 子. This outline of the course of the year isunusual in its combination and etymological interpretation of factors fromseparate tables. Also, the argumentative purpose of the passage is thin. It doesnot seem to reach beyond numerological speculation, as opposed to section 60,for instance, where the Master gives a mainstream version of the occurrence ofgrowth through the seasons, linked to the demand for benevolent government.16. [chapter_12.xhtml#rch12fn16] This is repeated in section 209 (p. 668), wherethe Master argues that he instructs the disciple because heaven bids him do soand not in order to do the disciple a favor.17. [chapter_12.xhtml#rch12fn17] This is making the best of a passage of whichLuo and Long don’t seem to produce coherent translations and which did not makeit into the Chao. Since this passage would perhaps fall under “sexualtechniques,” censorship might have resulted in the received text being asdifficult as it is. What the passage seems to be saying is that it is easy to beborn but much more demanding to become a proper person since latter involveseducation.18. [chapter_12.xhtml#rch12fn18] That is, he will not be of benefit to hisdescendants.19. [chapter_12.xhtml#rch12fn19] A “good person” is here someone who believes indao, as above, in section 41. Religious ranks are conceived as steps in anongoing process of learning:A foolish man becomes worthy through learning. When a worthy man learns withoutinterruption he becomes wise. A wise man who continues to learn becomes a man ofdao, who will through study turn into a transcendent. A transcendent can learnto become perfected, and through continuous learning a perfected becomesspiritlike. (TPJ p. 725, Chao, part 1)20. [chapter_12.xhtml#rch12fn20] Throughout layer A the avoidance of death,important as it is (see below, section 66, p. 335, for instance), is not theonly aim of the taiping adept. Here it is depicted as nothing but one step in aspiritual career that extends all the way to saving the world. The taipingbeliever is expected to “nourish the vital principle,” which is necessarily apersonal and private activity with a society-oriented consciousness.21. [chapter_12.xhtml#rch12fn21] This passage is not in the Chao but is quotedin the Daoxue zhuan and the Taiping yulan, both of which give the TPJ as theirsource. Neither gives a hint of the general direction of the passage, that is,the argument about saying “thank you.” They both quote the stages of learning asproof of the benefits to be gained from relying on a teacher. The Taiping yulan(659.2945a) adds a few sentences that are almost too smooth to be from the TPJ:Not to get a good teacher is to go astray. Teachers transmit their knowledge toeach other until it is more solid than metal and rock. What has not beentransmitted by a teacher we call a random fabrication, which will lead to evil.To depart from such a teacher is to depart from the true doctrine (dao). In thisconsists the art of self-destruction. [Teaching the] doctrine (dao) areancestral teachers of two ranks, zong shi 宗師 and zu shi 組師害.The gist of this TPJ passage is unusual. The path outlined for the disciplereaches far beyond the human realm. The person who reaches primordial qi andwhat is as it is becomes a cosmic force. All this refers to stages ofmeditation, which explains the expressive, exalted use of language.22. [chapter_12.xhtml#rch12fn22] The summary says:This section explains the difference between root and branches and the figuresfor the end and the beginning; it is the essential text on meritorious conductbetween father and son and teacher and student.SECTION 54. HOW TO ENJOY GIVING LIFE WINS FAVOR WITH HEAVEN1. [chapter_13.xhtml#rch13fn1] See Kong Congzi 4 “Xing lun” 形論, p. 27; Ariel(1989: 170) refers to the remnants of Fu Sheng’s 伏勝 (third to second centuryB.C.E.) Shang shu da zhuan 4.112 and to Shuo yuan 7 “Zheng li” 政理, p. 60 forsimilar observations.2. [chapter_13.xhtml#rch13fn2] Daoyi 道意 (dao’s intentions) is rarely used. Incontrast to the Xiang’er (for Laozi 9, 13, 20, and 21), the Celestial Master andthe TPJ in general don’t personalize dao. This function is marked out forheaven; cf. Asano 1982: 14–16.3. [chapter_13.xhtml#rch13fn3] The Chao interprets cheng 成 (to bring life toperfection) in the sense of Lun yu 12.16: junzi cheng ren zhi mei 君子成人之美 (“Thegentleman helps others to realize what is good in them,” in D. C. Lau’s [1979]words). Luo (1996: 138) adheres to this when he interprets the passage as “tomake others perfect” in a moral sense. I follow Long’s (2000: 169) broaderunderstanding of the word as “to help things to ripen.”4. [chapter_13.xhtml#rch13fn4] The Chao is here further than usual from thereceived text of the TPJ. The Chao seems to misinterpret the last sentence:“Next, nothing is better than benevolence (the text mistakenly reads ren [man]for ren [humaneness]) and generosity. It is right when you see them poor andexhausted to feel their distress (wei qi chouxin 為, (corrected from 謂) 其愁心) asif you were worried about hunger and cold (zi 自 “your own” is missing).” Thelarge number of variants points to a high degree of textual corruption.5. [chapter_13.xhtml#rch13fn5] Not to prosecute can be seen as a virtue. Hulsewe(1955: 137) mentions Yuan An 袁安, who, as governor between 73 and 83 C.E., chosenot to follow up a case of substantial corruption in order not to be forced toexclude a number of his subordinates from office (Hou Han shu 45.1518).6. [chapter_13.xhtml#rch13fn6] As Hulsewe (1955: 129) points out, hard labor wasthe primary alternative to the death penalty.7. [chapter_13.xhtml#rch13fn7] Hulsewe (1955: 114-18) shows that the executionof a culprit’s relatives, including grandparents and grandchildren, was commonduring the Han, although it met with some resistance (see Han shu 23.1104f).When the Wei (220–65) came to power, it was seen as necessary to excludegrandparents, grandchildren, and married daughters from such collectivepunishment (Jin shu 30.925f.), in line with the demands put forth in the passageat hand. The report on legal matters of the Sui shu does not mention collectiveresponsibility. It does, however, note that Emperor Yang argued in 607 for theemployment of descendants of criminal offenders in public service; cf. Balazs1954: 90f.8. [chapter_13.xhtml#rch13fn8] This consequence of damaging the sequence ofgenerations is the same as that which results from chastity; see section 42.9. [chapter_13.xhtml#rch13fn9] The expression xiansheng 先生 covers a wider groupof men than zu 組 (ancestors); see TPJ 73.178 and 141.401. This wider group isalso thematized when the Celestial Master discusses the origin of “inheritedevil\" (cheng fu).10. [chapter_13.xhtml#rch13fn10] This characterizes good government. Emperor Wenof the Han was thus praised; see Han shu 4.135 and cf. Hulsewe 1955: 334 andnote 155 on pp. 375f.11. [chapter_13.xhtml#rch13fn11] This passage ties general ideas about goodgovernment to specific taiping notions about the need to protect life.12. [chapter_13.xhtml#rch13fn12] What follows consists of fragments without anyline of argumentation. Some passages are badly damaged. As far as their contentscan be made out, they are similar to the beginning or the end of many layer Adialogues.13. [chapter_13.xhtml#rch13fn13] The transmitted text must be spurious;otherwise, this remark makes no sense.14. [chapter_13.xhtml#rch13fn14] The TPJ’s understanding of these matters agreesto some extent with common patterns. Mount Kunlun is seen as reigning over earthas the central pole star (zhongji 中極) does over the sky (TPJ 137.384). It is theplace where lists are kept with the names of the long-lived (TPJ 179.532, layerB) and, according to the Zhuangzi (46.18.20), is the resting place of the YellowEmperor. It is said to be close to heaven:Registers of spiritlike men and transcendents are kept at the [celestial] NorthPole (beiji 北極), adjacent to the Kunlun, on whose grounds the Perfected reside,according to their rank. They are in charge of the men registered. They listfamily name and personal name in good order. The one known to be on top is puton top, someone in the middle is put there, and a person who is at the bottom isput at the bottom. (TPJ 190.583, layer B)Transcendents who have not yet achieved access to heaven reside on the “Kunlunof the [celestial] North Pole\" (beiji kunlun), amidst clouds and winds (TPJ p.698, Chao, part 8). The Celestial Master has achieved this access and thusresides in the palace of the celestial North Pole, the abode of spiritlike menwho resemble the supreme celestial emperor (see below, section 56). They bend qi(wei qi 委氣), and have a voice for instruction but no corporeal form (TPJ p. 222,Chao, part 4). All this creates a bond between Master and disciples. Theirworlds are different, but they belong together as Mount Kunlun belongs to thesky to which it reaches. This use of the mountain and the constellation that issupposed to adjoin it signifies a certain unity of the textus receptus in thatit recurs in layer A as well as in layer B. Moreover, while all the elementsmentioned belong to a standard Daoist scenario (see, for instance, Schipper1996: 105-7), I have not found any exact parallels to the TPJ’s way of arrangingthem.15. [chapter_13.xhtml#rch13fn15] The topics dealt with in this corrupt passageare the proper way of teaching and the relationship between teacher and student.The following is a tentative translation of the isolated elements that have beentransmitted:model for emperors and be able to obtain . . . [seven characters missing] . . .without the proper etiquette between teacher and student. This, however, iscalled by name to exchange . . . [six characters missing] . . . his talents.This we call chaotic learning without order . . . [eight characters missing] . .. instructions cause the doctrine (dao) to become indistinct, sometimes rightand sometimes wrong. Such sayings must not be transmitted to become the modelfor emperors and kings.That is why I don’t dare to speak.Don’t say that (bu ye 不也; see Yu 2001b: 467)! How modest! I would like todiscuss with you how to do good. There is indeed no harm in talking . . . [fourcharacters missing] . . . how?The TPJ’s colloquial prose style makes it even more difficult to emend thispassage. The tenor of its message is probably similar to that of the following,better preserved, sentences.16. [chapter_13.xhtml#rch13fn16] Through guarding the one we know good and bad(TPJ 152.412). The expression occurs frequently, including in layer B (TPJ194.598; 179.528). Heaven takes an interest in this knowledge:Heaven makes men know good and bad, do good, and be trustworthy (you xin 有信). Itdoes not want them to have a bad name (e wen 惡聞). (TPJ 179.535, layer B)17. [chapter_13.xhtml#rch13fn17] As Yu Liming (1997: 50) points out, thecharacter xie 些 is miswritten for zi 訾, which in the TPJ is used for “to worry”see TPJ 48.61.18. [chapter_13.xhtml#rch13fn18] This is the second time this expression is usedin this section. The fact that it occurs here could have persuaded the editorsto collate the section as they did. It is used at only one other place in theTPJ (61.112).19. [chapter_13.xhtml#rch13fn19] Yu (2001a: 79) corrects jin 今 (now) to ling 令(to let). Throughout the received text one of the two characters is frequentlytaken for the other.20. [chapter_13.xhtml#rch13fn20] The summary says:This section explains the evaluation of government policy and how to respond toheaven’s will; it talks about the use of polite language between teacher andstudent.The short section does indeed deal with two topics.SECTION 55. HOW TO CLASSIFY OLD TEXTS AND GIVE A TITLE TO THE BOOK1. [chapter_14.xhtml#rch14fn1] See Teng and Biggerstaff 1971: 83. They mentionthe Huang lan 皇覽 as the earliest encyclopedia to have been collated underimperial auspices, in about 220 C.E. Cao Cao (155–220), then in charge of muchof the empire, initiated it for his personal instruction. This section of theTPJ could well be the earliest description of how such a compilation wasorganized.2. [chapter_14.xhtml#rch14fn2] I read ri 日 (daily more) for yue 曰 (to say). Whatfollows is too self-confident to be part of the disciple’s speech. Moreimportantly, yue is very rarely used to introduce master or disciple as speaker.Where its occurrence must not be interpreted as erroneous—that is, TPJ 105.261,throughout section 108, and TPJ 153.426—the text seems to consist of a condensedversion of the original transcripts; this holds true in particular for section108, which has several features in common with the Chao and where yue is usedfrequently.3. [chapter_14.xhtml#rch14fn3] “To collect and to revise” (ju jiao 拘校) is anactivity taiping adherents are expected to master, as documented in the list ofnineteen essential commandments (TPJ 173.510; cf. Espesset 2002c: 83f.).4. [chapter_14.xhtml#rch14fn4] We must assume that the “valuable opinions\" (shanyi 善意) are those that further great peace:Some among the millions of scrolls of writings can increase men’s longevity,improve their life, give them security. These are true texts (zen wen 真文), therest are not. In the rooms filled with writings are some that can help inunderstanding heaven’s intentions and bringing peaceful order to government.These are true texts, the rest are not. (TPJ 158.446)In more abstract terms, the definition of what is “true” or “valuable”—here thetwo terms are close—is more difficult. It is, however, not in conflict with whathas been said above:When men talk, they each say something. You must extract what is valuable (shan)from the texts (wen) and the sentences (yan 言) that nobody objects to. You mustput together explanations that everyone sees as best so that they clarify andprove each other. They will agree with the heart of men and thus also with theheart of heaven and earth.Since the disciple claims that he doesn’t understand, the Master continues:A man’s actions are examined by the heart. We may call everything that agreeswith the heart of the worthy and the wise “valuable\" (shan). It is bound toagree with the heart of heaven. Should there be doubts when you examinesomething in your heart, have it examined by the worthy and the wise down to thesmall men. What they say “no” to is inauspicious (xiong 凶) and heaven is alsobound to see it as such. That is the proof. Therefore, if you collect thesewords (shuo 是) to make them into a scripture, [keep in mind that] what agreeswith a man’s heart is right (shi 是) and what doesn’t is wrong (fe 非). (TPJ132.354)5. [chapter_14.xhtml#rch14fn5] A major topic is how to handle writings. Sections47, 55, 61, 73, 75, 77, 79, 132, 165, 167, and 169 in the received part of theTPJ deal with it. The S 4226 table of contents lists more: for instance,sections 8 and 39.6. [chapter_14.xhtml#rch14fn6] The Master’s language shows that he finds thequestion exciting. “Excellent, indeed” and “yes” are in general the response ofa student, but in this case it is hard to say what the student would beresponding to.7. [chapter_14.xhtml#rch14fn7] The Master mentions texts going back to dao, towise men, to worthy men, and to the people. This last point is his own additionto the scriptures of wisdom, of virtue, and of worth that the disciple had askedabout. The classification of writings given here is one of many possibleclassifications and is concerned not so much with texts as such (for this, seesection 53), but rather with material that is to be newly collated. Thehierarchical order of texts and materials is flexible. Compare, for instance,the following amazingly egalitarian approach:Sometimes the spirit texts of heaven (tian sken wen 天神文) might omit something,but the wise texts have grasped it. At other times, wise texts omit somethingthat the texts of the worthy have understood, or these texts neglect somethingthat the people’s (bai xing) texts deal with. Or the people’s texts omit whatthe Yi and Di barbarians have grasped. Sometimes the texts produced internally(nei) miss it, while those produced outside (wai) have it, or the other wayaround. (TPJ 132.352)Another classification is by age:What men of early antiquity have omitted, men in middle antiquity may haveincluded. What the men of middle antiquity have omitted, men of late antiquitymay include. (TPJ 132.352)Intellectual status can also be used for classification:Occasionally superior men have been slightly neglectful and inferior men haveachieved something, or a superior man has grasped a point that has been omittedby inferior men. Or both superior and inferior men might have ignored somethingthat a man of middle rank might have understood, or the other way around. (TPJ132.352)Women and serfs are included in this task. They are expected to contribute tothe production of texts.8. [chapter_14.xhtml#rch14fn8] This is how anthologies of a limited and thusrealistic scope such as the Daojiao yishu were, in fact, organized. The figuresmentioned by the Celestial Master add a fantastic touch to his own project.9. [chapter_14.xhtml#rch14fn9] “Scripture of wisdom\" (sheng jing 聖經) is the termlater used for the classical scriptures promoted by Confucianism; see Hanyu dacidian vol. 8, p. 674, which quotes Wang Tong’s (583–616) Zhong shuo (chap.“Tian di” 天地, p. 9a).10. [chapter_14.xhtml#rch14fn10] This last group of texts seems to refer tomaterial not produced within the academic environment, from which theabove-mentioned texts from “early, middle, and late antiquity” probably came.11. [chapter_14.xhtml#rch14fn11] Yu (2001a: 81) corrects wei 微 (subtle) to zheng徵 (to prove).12. [chapter_14.xhtml#rch14fn12] This is the Dongji tian di yin yang zhi jing洞極天地陽之經. Dongji (all-pervading) is the opposite of rupture and blockage, whichare seen as life-threatening perversions of the natural course of things. It ispointed out at the end of this section that dongji is the word for the almostutopian concept of total communication that is expected to link all theparticipants of a taiping society. The term is used throughout layer A with themeaning of “reaching everyone” and “covering everything” (TPJ 139.397; 104.258)and occurs in praise of the Celestial Master (TPJ 209.668; 207.629), in praiseof methods of government (TPJ 65.152; 103.253), and in praise of qi (TPJ p. 651,Chao, part 7). Everything will be well governed with the arrival of dongji qi(TPJ 136.378). The term serves as an abbreviation for expressions like dong liuji (pervade the six most outward points) (TPJ 104.258; 151.408; p. 222, Chao,part 4; 105.273f).A scripture entitled Dongji jing or Dongji zhi jing is depicted as beinginstrumental in the arrival of a state of great peace:I would like to ask why, all of a sudden, heaven and earth let the men of thisworld collect [popular] sayings and the texts of spiritlike and wise men of pastand present times to make the “Scripture That Pervades All.”The Master answers that heaven and earth intend thereby to cure all ills; seeTPJ 132.349f.The following passage adds more details:Nowadays, when another great cycle of heaven and earth is about to begin,natural disasters and other evil influences must all come to an end. Nobody mustagain (commit the crime of) hoarding goods. Therefore, teach men how to collectand revise old and new texts and put together what is valuable. Thus will theyget the “Scripture That Pervades All” and determine forever, unchangeably, whatis “good.” Even sages and worthies won’t again attain what it says. It is whatheaven and earth and Yin and Yang put forth. Thus, it instructs and reprimands aruler and his worthies in their search for great peace. (TPJ p. 686, Chao, part8)The scripture is thus part and parcel of the taiping reform project. Without theinstructions it contains men can’t achieve great peace. This agrees with theTPJ’s general appraisal of texts (cf. Kaltenmark 1979: 24–29; Hachiya 1983):Give this to a lord of outstanding virtue. He will let the people know whatheaven wants. They will then spontaneously be secure and have all they need,without any doubt or error. He will correct everything, thoroughly investigatethe root of heaven and earth, eradicate the harm done to a country by heaven’sresentment and earth’s accusations, and set up the “Scripture That PervadesAll.” (TPJ p. 467, Chao, part 6)Editors of the “Scripture That Pervades All” are said to be the “worthy andenlightened.” They are seen to make use of a wide range of materials, includingmemorials collected all over the country (TPJ 129.333). There are also the“spirit writings”:What the Celestial Master puts forth today agrees completely with material likethe spirit writings and valuable texts from the Yellow River and the Luo issuedin former times as well as today and also with instructions that have beenuttered by worthy and enlightened men. Once this has been made into the“Scripture That Pervades All,” the calamities that have come about since theorigin of heaven and earth can all be abolished. (TPJ 129.331f.)How this scripture is related to the writings put forth by the Celestial Masteris left as unclear on other occasions as it is in this section. However, it issafe to say that the scripture is—or, with regard to the section at hand, afterits completion it will be—authorized by the Master, and in this sense it is“his.” The following passage reflects the ambiguities of section 55, but in morecompact form:I would like to ask about the Celestial Master’s writings that collate [ju jiao]texts by worthy and wise men from earlier and later times, going back to theorigin of heaven and earth, including spirit writings from the Yellow River andthe Luo and also what the people have to say, including serfs and barbarians . ... . . The best, first-ranking scripture from which all errors have been removedis the “Scripture That Pervades All.” It is called “Heaven’s All-PervadingReign\" (tian dongji zheng shi 天洞極政事). Consequent upon it, all the ills of heavenand earth will be driven away. (TPJ 132.348)The use of the term dongji signifies the relevance of the scripture concerned,regardless of whether it is the text initiated by the Celestial Master, or thetext promulgated by officials of the virtuous taiping ruler, or whether the twotexts are identical. This scripture comprises all that is needed to implementtaiping-related reforms and is expected to reach everyone and everything.Furthermore, in another sense of dong (to reach), the term also signifies therange of the missionary project, which does not permit any exclusions.13. [chapter_14.xhtml#rch14fn13] This is mentioned, for instance, in Lun yu 9.9.14. [chapter_14.xhtml#rch14fn14] Ju 居 is put to unusual use. There is a parallelpassage:If we consider the textual material that reaches from old to modern times it isquite complete. But the trouble is that put together (chou qi ji ju 愁其集居),nothing is pure. Put side by side (ji ce 集廁), [words] contradict (luan 亂) eachother so that the worthy and enlightened have questions, misgivings, and doubtsand don’t know which [words] to follow and which to trust. (TPJ 78.188)Both ji ju and ji ce refer to the edition of textual material. Ji ce is alsoused in this sense at TPJ 71.174, layer unclear.15. [chapter_14.xhtml#rch14fn15] Yue (to speak) must be read ri (day); see Long2000: 180 and Yu 2001a: 82.16. [chapter_14.xhtml#rch14fn16] Yu (2001a: 82) corrects he 和 (harmony) to zhi 知(to know).17. [chapter_14.xhtml#rch14fn17] This explains the timing and the novelty oftaiping missionary activities. They are taking place now; they did not happen inthe distant past.18. [chapter_14.xhtml#rch14fn18] In line with this section, which identifies thefate of a society with that of its texts, xie wei 牙偽 can also be translated as“evil and deceptive conduct.” This same point is also expressed below, at TPJ57.92, and throughout the sections here translated, where xie wei serves as abroad term of social and cultural criticism.19. [chapter_14.xhtml#rch14fn19] This passage is a rhetorical expression ofexultation. The “true text” is being composed in separate, ritualized stages.Once the whole ritual has been performed and the text has been created, itsexistence puts an end to all calamities. This message is set forth in a verbose,enthusiastic manner, unlike the more prosaic way in which other subjects aretreated. This choice of words signifies the central function of texts in theworld of great peace (cf. Hendrischke 1992).20. [chapter_14.xhtml#rch14fn20] There are frequent lacunas before the phrasewan bu shi yi 萬不失一—see TPJ 57.92; 60.111; 67.169; 78.190; 208.664—perhaps as ameans of abbreviation. It was clear what was meant anyway. For the passage athand the two missing characters could be shi zhe 是者 (see TPJ 78.191), yi ci 以此(TPJ 83.210), or ci zhe 此者 (TPJ 86.320), all of which occur before wan bu shiyi.21. [chapter_14.xhtml#rch14fn21] This is the Da dongji tian zhi zhengshi大洞極天之政事; see also TPJ 132.348.22. [chapter_14.xhtml#rch14fn22] Here two expressions are combined. The fouroceans (Shu jing, chap. “Da Yu mou” 大禹謀, p. 134b–c) and the four borders (Mengzi1B6) both serve to define the world of men. Many of the TPJ’s word clusters arecreated in a similar fashion.23. [chapter_14.xhtml#rch14fn23] The summary says:This section explains how to collate writings and men’s sayings from early,middle, and late antiquity.SECTION 56. HOW THE NINE GROUPS OF MEN DISPERSE CALAMITIES INHERITED FROM FORMERKINGS1. [chapter_15.xhtml#rch15fn1] The title of the section reads “nine heavens.” Itis corrected to “nine men\" (ren).2. [chapter_15.xhtml#rch15fn2] See Wenzi 7 “Weiming” 微明, p. 337.3. [chapter_15.xhtml#rch15fn3] See Zhuangzi (“Ren jian shi” 人間世) 9.4.24–35.4. [chapter_15.xhtml#rch15fn4] The text is corrupt beyond hope of emendation.This translation follows Yu 2001a: 84, but the result is not satisfactory inthat Yin and Yang are hardly thematized in this section. Also, er 而 does notusually link characters that function as nouns. Moreover, the section beginsabruptly, without an exchange of greetings and questions. We must assume thatthe first part has not been well transmitted.5. [chapter_15.xhtml#rch15fn5] “Bending qi\" (wei qi 委氣) is a breathingtechnique, mentioned together with lian 鍊 (smelting), bi 閉 (stopping), and bu 布(extending) qi (Yunji qiqian 60.19a–b) in a text entitled Zhongshan yugui fuqijing 中山玉櫃服氣經, which was supposedly written by a certain Bi Yan 碧嚴 “Blue Peak,”annotated by Huang yuan jun 黃元君 (Lord of Yellow Origin), and frequently quotesthe Huangting jing; it does not figure elsewhere in the Yunji qiqian or in othermaterial consulted by Ōfuchi and Ishii (1988). Long and Luo prefer to render theterm as “accumulating qi.” Although wei can mean “to store,” this is an activitythat the TPJ authors meet with disdain; wei (to bend) is taken from wei shen,the “bent body” that is a sign of respect; “to bend qi” resembles in structurethe “smelting” and “extending” of the Yunji qiqian.In the TPJ “to bend qi\" is an important activity. It is mentioned in a passageon meditation in connection with the first of nine grades of being Daoist. Itbelongs to layer A, but the topic is personal salvation. It says that adepts whomaster the first three techniques will be able to transcend the world (du shi度世):The most high-ranking first grade is to consider yourself (“your body\" shen 身)in the way of primordial qi without falsity (yuan qi wu wei 元氣無為). Utterlyuncontrived you will only think of yourself as being white all through, as ifyou bent qi and were without shape. If you make this your permanent model youwill get to the point where you will achieve and know everything. (TPJ 107.282)The TPJ also uses the term in a different, slightly puzzling manner, as MaxKaltenmark (1979: 31) has pointed out, as if the “bent qi” were an entitysimilar to primordial qi. In a passage that does not contain distinctivestylistic elements but that probably belongs to layer B, it is said that thespiritlike man who studies the way (dao) of life “shares the wishes of bent qi(yu wei qi tong yuan 與委氣同願)” and “would not dare forget the intentions of bentqi (bu gan shi wei qi zhi yi 不敢失委氣之意),” in the same way as the pious child willalways think of his parents (TPJ 185.563, layer B [?]). The term occursaltogether four times in this passage. Another layer B passage (Chao, p. 710,part 9; cf. Espesset 2002b: 11) links the term closely to the layer B figure“Great Spirit.”6. [chapter_15.xhtml#rch15fn6] The nine groups mentioned here resemble a set ofeight—or, in fact, nine—groups introduced in a Chao passage (pp. 221–22) frompart 4, which can be identified with section 96 of the S 4226 table of contents,entitled “Instruction on how to explain heaven’s nine groups of men (jiu ren九人).” (Yoshioka [1970: 31] sees the character after tian (heaven) as notidentifiable. See Zhang Gong 1992: 3; it seems to consist of radical 213,“tortoise,” under radical 41, “roof.”)Now what do the spiritlike man, the perfected, the transcendent, the man of dao,the wise man, the worthy, the people, and the serfs resemble? (TPJ p. 221)The spiritlike man resembles heaven’s omniscience while the perfected resemblesearth’s sincerity—it will never deceive heaven. The transcendent resembles thefour season’s changeability; the man of dao resembles the five phases and canthus prognosticate good and bad luck and stay in control of security and danger.The wise man resembles Yin and Yang and is thus in harmonious cooperation withthe ten thousand beings, and the worthy reaches into the distance, similar tomountains and rivers, and thus serves emperors and kings. The people resemblethe ten thousand plants (wan wu 萬物); they grow everywhere, high and low. Serfsand slaves resemble low-growing plants (cao mu 草木). This list is depicted asbeing the outcome of a twofold division of society, that is, into male andfemale or lord and servant in line with the forces of Yin and Yang. The passagealso discusses the issue of social or at least Daoist mobility:Serfs who obey their master and learn how to be good (xue shan 學善) can becomeworthy. If they don’t, they become good men (shan ren 善人) and honest subjects(liang min 良民); if honest subjects and good men study without let-up, theybecome worthy men. (TPJ p. 222)This is the wording of a TPJ quotation in the Zhengyi fawen taishang wai lu yi.The Chao text gives the full list, but with less detail:When serfs are worthy, they can become good men (shan ren). When a good manlikes studying, he becomes a worthy. If a worthy man studies without giving up,he becomes wise. A wise man who continues to study knows the gate of heaven’sdao. Should he continue to enter dao and complete the task of avoiding death hebecomes a transcendent. A transcendent who does not give up becomes perfected. Aperfected who perseveres becomes spirit, and a spirit who does not give upshares the body of majestic heaven. For this reason the spiritlike man of thehighest order lives in the [celestial] North Pole in the same constellation asthe supreme emperor of heaven and is called “spirit of the celestial heart\"(tian xin shen 天心神). Should such a spirit not give up, he will transcend heaven,undertake the bending of qi, and instruct by sound while being without shape. Hewill belong to the region above heaven. (TPJ p. 222, Chao, part 4)The last, most illustrious, being, who transcends heaven and bends qi, is not inthe list of eight introduced in part 4 of the Chao, but his addition creates themore meaningful figure of nine and thus brings section 96 very close to thesection at hand. So we may assume that in the Celestial Master’s opinion theorigin of human rank depends on the Yin and Yang dichotomy, while the move fromone rank to the next relies on “learning.” This suggestion is repeated in theChao version of part 1 (p. 725), where it is explained that through learning afoolish person will become worthy, a worthy one will become wise, a wise onewill gain dao, followed by becoming a transcendent, a perfected, and a spirit.There are seven groups all together. This process of learning is not specified,but we must assume that it consists of learning what the Celestial Masterteaches. One major subject in this curriculum is “to learn to search for the way(dao) of life” (xue qiu sheng dao 學求生道) (TPJ 185.563, layer B[?], cf. Kaltenmark1979: 31), a study undertaken in particular by the spiritlike man without bodilyform. So learning is promoted as the basis for social mobility. The passage athand attests to the taiping doctrine’s “totalitarian” or holistic approach. Itintegrates social and spiritual ranks into one single system that rendersreligious instruction mobile and flexible. This system played a role inattracting followers; see sections 58 and 61. The following passage throws adifferent light on the issue:The Perfected said: My life does indeed depend on predestined fate (lu ming 綠命)! It is my good fortune that I have been able to meet with you.The spiritlike man [in this section, as in the Chao, sken ren is used for theCelestial Master; the section contains the expression “Now that I have heard thespiritlike man, the Celestial Master (shen ren tian shi 神人天師), speak, my heartis greatly delighted . . .,” p. 287] answered:Yes, the six ways of human life each have their fate. The first is that of aspiritlike man, the second is a perfected, the third a transcendent, the fourtha man of dao, the fifth is wise, the sixth worthy. They all support heaven’srule. The spiritlike man is in charge of heaven, the perfected of earth, and thetranscendent of wind and rain. The man of dao is educated in matters of good andbad luck, the wise man rules over the hundred surnames, and the worthy assiststhe wise in keeping the registers of the ten thousand subjects in order and inextending support in all six directions to where there is insufficiency. Forthis reason each human life has its fate. If it is someone’s fate to be in ahigh position he can’t be lowly, and if he is fated to be humble he can’t rise.Do you want to know how I can prove this? Although a fish avails itself ofwater, it would not fly in the water’s qi; a dragon also avails itself of water,and from the water’s qi it rises into a green cloud and becomes heaven’s envoy!The honored and the lowly both have their fate; it is foolish to talk about itat random. (TPJ 108.288f)The dialogue then moves toward a compromise. Heaven’s fate also includes theability to learn dao, and thus progress is possible.7. [chapter_15.xhtml#rch15fn7] According to the “Lüli zhi” 律歷志 of the Han shu(21A.964), “primordial qi” (yuan qi 元氣) is the root of the universe. The term isfrequently used in a similar sense in the TPJ. Yuan qi is situated in theneighborhood of ziran (TPJ p. 17, Chao, part 2): “Primordial qi has three names:great Yang, great Yin, and their harmony” (TPJ p. 19, Chao, part 2). It is amongthe highest-ranking cosmogonic and thus cosmological principles:Primordial qi is Yang and is in charge of giving life. What is as it is causeschange; it is Yin and in charge of nourishing all beings (fan wu 凡物). Heaven’sYang is in charge of life; the Yin of earth is in charge of nourishing. (TPJ p.220, Chao, part 4)For this reason, neglect of “the method of heaven and earth, of primordial qi,and of what is as it is” causes disaster (TPJ 65.151).The Celestial Master’s understanding of yuan qi differs from other Daoist usageof the term. In the third-century Commands and Admonition of the Families of theGreat Dao (Da dao jia lingjie), primordial qi is only one of three pneumas thatgo back to dao as creative force, which reduces the cosmogonic function of theterm, and Bokenkamp (1997: 159f.) concludes that here yuan qi is the elementthat makes cosmic dao accessible to humans.The maintenance of this qi requires returning backward and holding on to theroot (TPJ, pp. 12–15, Chao, part 2; cf. Kaltenmark 1979: 23). The need forreturn applies to society as a whole just as it does for the individual. Forthis reason, for the Celestial Master, primordial qi is the source of individuallife (see TPJ 44.43) as well as a method of government:There are altogether ten methods that provide support for the government ofemperors and kings: government by primordial qi, by what is as it is, by dao, byvirtue, by benevolence, by propriety, by ritual, by texts (wen), by a legal code(fa), and by war. (TPJ 103.254; and see above, section 41)8. [chapter_15.xhtml#rch15fn8] Da shen (Great Spirit) is here used as anabbreviation for da shen ren 大神人, as in the above paragraph. The TPJ speaks ofhim as a ruler who governs in the knowledge of all written material on all threedao:In his meditation he understands what the world (tianxia) wants and [whatcauses] movement and rest in all transformation. (TPJ 132.360)We must assume that a da shen ren—the term is rare—is a human being resembling a“great spirit,” as introduced in the Zhou li (“Chun guan, si shi” 春官肆事, p. 769c)and in the Zuo zhuan (Duke Xiang, ninth year, p. 1943a), where spirits or,perhaps better, deities are “great” and powerful in the same sense in which acountry can be great.In TPJ layer B material, a Great Spirit takes the place of the layer A CelestialMaster. His position is high:The honorable personage of the spiritlike man of supreme majesty who ispersonally known as Duke Who Bends Qi and also by the name of Great Spirit isalways situated to the left of the Celestial Lord (tian jun 天君). He is in chargeof putting in order the writings that are in the Hall of Light. (TPJ p. 710,Chao, part 9, layer B)9. [chapter_15.xhtml#rch15fn9] When one considers the whole of the TPJ, thisorder of ranks allows the Great Spirit, who in layer B acts as mentor to thewell-deserving disciple, to be positioned above the Perfected, the rank held bythe Celestial Master’s disciples.10. [chapter_15.xhtml#rch15fn10] “Transformation\" (bianhua 變化) is a Zhuangzi(34.13.30; 72.25.64) and a Yi jing term (hexagram 1, p. 1). It points to the waybeings exist in this world.11. [chapter_15.xhtml#rch15fn11] Prognostication is one of the TPJ’s majortopics. Judging by their titles, sections 1, 35, 36, 37, 67, 68, 88, 105, 121,and 215 deal with the topic.12. [chapter_15.xhtml#rch15fn12] This is the worthy’s task throughout the TPJ.Since so much depends on texts, his work is crucial. He is an assistant to thewise man, sheng ren. Neither of them is an expert in specific life-prolongingarts. They can be seen as one group, as the “wise and worthy of old\" (guzhesheng xian) (TPJ 66.157–67). This group can also contain a third component, asin phrases like “the worthy, wise, and highly educated of old\" (guzhe xian shengda ru 古者賢聖大儒 (TPJ 66.159; see also 162). They are literate and in a position ofresponsibility. Their cooperation is essential for the success of taipingreforms, but they can’t be expected to initiate these reforms on their own.13. [chapter_15.xhtml#rch15fn13] “Perplexed” (xinjie 心 結): When the heart is“tangled up,” no understanding (cong ming 聰明) is possible; see TPJ 132.357 (also208.662). The Celestial Master is capable of untying it; see section 48, p. 146,above. The character jie is also used to intensify the meaning of yuan 冤(grief); for yuanjie (grief-stricken), see sections 41 and 48.14. [chapter_15.xhtml#rch15fn14] I follow Yu’s (2001a: 85) punctuation, readingbu ye 不也 as the answer to the question he yi yu wang zhi hu 何益於王治乎.15. [chapter_15.xhtml#rch15fn15] The Chao reduces the TPJ’s pleonasticexpression ci jiu shi nai geng die xiang sheng cheng 此九事迺更迭相生成 by cutting outnai geng.16. [chapter_15.xhtml#rch15fn16] The philosophers have been more concerned withexplaining the need for a division of labor and the ensuing social hierarchy(Mengzi 3A4) than with explaining the need for cooperation between the differentstrata, as if the second point were more self-evident than the first. However,the need for “stomach and limbs” to cooperate was well understood: see Mozi 46“Geng zhu” 耕柱 (79.46.10) or Guanzi 48 “Zhi guo” 治國, p. 262.17. [chapter_15.xhtml#rch15fn17] “To arrive on a grand scale\" (tai zhi 太至): theadverbial use of tai and the brevity of the expression are unusual.18. [chapter_15.xhtml#rch15fn18] The argument is bidirectional: qi must be inorder for the nine groups of men to help the lord, and these men must help thelord for qi to be in order. Order is obviously achieved in certain successivelayers of activity. The mode of expression signifies the necessity of thelinkage, the interdependence of factors. It all makes perfect sense, despitesuch formal intricacies.19. [chapter_15.xhtml#rch15fn19] Breathing techniques are the skill all men musthave if they want to do their job. This is referred to in the Mengzi (2A2) andanalyzed in the Guanzi (“Nei ye” 内業), as well as mentioned in a host of Daoistmaterial. Breathing techniques are related to the role played by the method ofguarding the one in achieving great peace.20. [chapter_15.xhtml#rch15fn20] The division of men into superior, average, andinferior (shang, zhong, xia) pertains to three different aims in life. Betweenthem, the three groups represent the whole variety of how things can be done, asis the case with most TPJ divisions into three. The Celestial Master needs todefine the different approaches to the study of his teachings so that individualfailure can be explained. The following pattern is laid out:The superior person studies dao in order to assist emperors and kings. He mustlove life and gain merit and will then live long. An average person studies daobecause he wishes his family to transcend the world. An inferior person studiesdao simply to cast off his own body. (TPJ p. 724, Chao, part 1)The next passage can help explain why this is so:The superior person is a worthy of high rank (or “superior persons and worthiesof high rank\" [shang shi gao xian 上士高賢]) who stands in complete awe of allactivities, may they be big or small. The average person is half in awe, theinferior person not at all. The reason why the superior person is in awe is whatis demanded of him, not what he would demand of others. His heart is open; hismind (yi 意) is immersed in nothingness and embraces tolerance. He knows thatprimordial qi is at the root of what is as it is (zhi yuan qi ziran zhi gen知元氣自然之根). (TPJ p. 724, Chao, part 1)For this reason, all beings and all natural phenomena inspire him with awe. Theaverage person has no insight into the arts (shu 術) involved in primordialbreath and what is as it is and therefore has little respect for astronomicalphenomena. The inferior person is not even amazed at the size of the earth’smountains and rivers. All he knows is how to till the soil, sow, and keep hishouse in order (TPJ p. 724, Chao, part 10).These passages depict the superior person as a leading personality who has awide soteriological impact. This is also upheld in the rather unusual section191, which represents the whole of chapter 113 and has traces of a CelestialMaster-type dialogue. It explains how the three types differ in their attitudetoward music and what they achieve by it. Through nonaction the superior personenables others to turn into transcendents; the average person makes societyharmonious; the inferior person sees to it that there is food (TPJ 191.588).21. [chapter_15.xhtml#rch15fn21] A grass hut is a simple place for a simplemeal. See Han Feizi 21.768.12.22. [chapter_15.xhtml#rch15fn22] See Laozi 43.23. [chapter_15.xhtml#rch15fn23] The term shen shi 神士 (spiritlike scholar) isused only here in the TPJ and does not occur in the dictionaries.24. [chapter_15.xhtml#rch15fn24] Spirits are heaven’s servants (tian zhi li天之吏); see TPJ p. 221, Chao, part 4. They are also its envoys (shi 使) (see TPJ p.218, Chao, part 4), or both its servants and envoys (TPJ p. 15, Chao, part 2).The two characters can easily be confused. In the passage at hand the phrase“lord and servant” on the next page makes it likely that “servant” is thecorrect character.25. [chapter_15.xhtml#rch15fn25] The term tian shi 天士 occurs once more in theTPJ (TPJ 179.541), probably mistaken for tian shang 上, but it is used in Handynasty historical writings (see Hanyu da cidian, vol. 2, p. 1405) in themeaning of “someone who knows the way of heaven,” as Yan Shigu explains.26. [chapter_15.xhtml#rch15fn26] The presence of spirits (shen) was auspicious,as the following Zhong yong account indicates:The Master said: “The way demons and spirits show their virtue is marvelous.When we look at them we don’t see them, when we listen to them we can’t hearthem. They are at the core of things and must not be forgotten. They makeeveryone in the world observe fasts and purification rituals and put on aceremonial gown to attend to their sacrifice. The spirits seem to float justabove the heads of the sacrificers, all around them. It is said in the Book ofOdes that ‘The approaches of spirits are unfathomable. How could one be unmovedby this?’ This is what is meant when we say that what can barely be detectedbecomes evident, and what is sincere cannot be kept concealed.” (See Li Ji,“Zhong yong,” p. 1628a: cf. Legge 1960, vol. 2, pp. 397f.; Sommer 1995: 37f.)This renders more pertinent what is said in section 46 about the need to containthe presence of demons (gui).27. [chapter_15.xhtml#rch15fn27] The Celestial Master is such a servant. He ishere said to fulfill the tasks of an informant, as do the body spirits.28. [chapter_15.xhtml#rch15fn28] The summary says:This section examines how the nine groups of men bring peace to the king’s reignby fulfilling their ambition without resentment. Thus heaven is happy to abolish[the evil] that has been inherited and transmitted by former kings.SECTION 57. HOW TO EXAMINE WHAT IS TRUE AND WHAT IS FALSE DAO1. [chapter_16.xhtml#rch16fn1] For instance, section 56.2. [chapter_16.xhtml#rch16fn2] See above, TPJ 55.86.3. [chapter_16.xhtml#rch16fn3] See TPJ 55.87 for characters missing before thephrase wan bu shi yi 萬不失一. I insert ci zhe 此者, following TPJ 127.320. Yu (2001a:87) inserts xing zhi 行之.4. [chapter_16.xhtml#rch16fn4] Heaven wants men to know about such issues (nanzhi qing 難知情), but does not, or rather cannot, tell them directly:Truly, heaven has grabbed your heart and made you speak. At one moment you werecompletely in the dark, not knowing what to do, and in the next it made youaware and your insight is as clear as sun and moon. You don’t believe me? Heavenwould like to make things public but it can’t speak to men and has difficultyletting them know (nan zhi qing 難知情). My writings convey heaven’s instructions,in clear colors. (TPJ 166.462)The fact that heaven does not speak with a human voice is the reason for theorigin of texts.5. [chapter_16.xhtml#rch16fn5] The two missing characters are read as lai xue來學. The phrase “you have been coming for some time to study” (TPJ 60.108) or “.. . to study dao” (TPJ 41.29) is common. So is the phrase xue wen (to study andraise questions), e.g., TPJ 53.78. Yu (2001a: 87) adds lai nan 來難.6. [chapter_16.xhtml#rch16fn6] Yin and Yang must be in balance.7. [chapter_16.xhtml#rch16fn7] With Yang (1994: 316), I read li 離 (distance) forsui 雖 (although).8. [chapter_16.xhtml#rch16fn8] Heaven, or rather the reliable order of theheavenly bodies, is “truth.” Texts are an approximation. In their realm errorand thus deceit become possible.9. [chapter_16.xhtml#rch16fn9] The character yue (to say) must be corrected tori (daily more); see Yu (2001a: 87). The passage is difficult. If I read itcorrectly, this is a harsh critique of the core of classical erudition. TheCelestial Master argues that the scriptures that Han dynasty scholars studiedwere meant to deceive people. We must, however, remind ourselves that the Masterdoes not, as did Zhuangzi (see 36.13.68–74 and 39.14.75–79), attack books assuch.10. [chapter_16.xhtml#rch16fn10] The two missing characters are read as da jie大戒 (general advice); cf. TPJ 152.420, yu zi yi da jie 語子一大戒, and the frequentuse of da jie in section 156 (pp. 438-40).11. [chapter_16.xhtml#rch16fn11] The summary says:This section gives instruction on how to verify dao through comparison and howto know true and false.SECTION 58. ON THE FOUR WAYS OF CONDUCT AND ON [THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN] ROOTAND BRANCHES1. [chapter_17.xhtml#rch17fn1] Huo 或 must be understood as 惑 (puzzling); cf. thesentence preceding note 5 of this section.2. [chapter_17.xhtml#rch17fn2] In this context, “good” and “bad” can hardly beseen as moral values. In a similar vein, section 106 talks about the “good andbad” in man’s nature (xing 性) as if this meant “prosperous and disadvantageous”:So when the nature (xing) [someone has received from] heaven and earth is good,it not only becomes manifest in himself; it also spreads to his descendants, asbecomes clear from their actions. If his nature is bad, this also does not restwith him only but reaches to his descendants and in a perverse way becomesmanifest in their actions. Therefore good and bad must become manifest. But tobe good is like the brightness that spreads with sunrise; to be wicked is likethe darkness after sunset. This is what the nature [someone has received from]heaven and earth, Yin and Yang, and what is as it is, is like. Heaven bringsforth the ten thousand beings, each follows its path (xing 行) and becomesdistinct, and nothing remains hidden. Thus the good man moves upward, and hisfate lies with heaven, just like the living belongs to heaven. The wicked manmoves downward, and his fate lies with earth; just like a dead person the wickedtherefore moves downward, to the Yellow Springs. This is what it means. (TPJ106.279)3. [chapter_17.xhtml#rch17fn3] This section discusses action from what we mightcall a “scientific” point of view rather than from a moral point of view. Theviewpoint is that of a prognosticator who needs to establish well-definedcriteria to predict the future. The Master’s approach here can be compared tothat of a physician who sees his skills made irrelevant by a patient whorecovers although predicted to die and by another patient who dies despite theexistence of a promising cure.4. [chapter_17.xhtml#rch17fn4] In the following, the formation of “good” and“bad” is linked to the occurrence of Yin and Yang. This relationship is taken upin another passage that deals with “good” and “bad” in a nondistinct manner, asif what is “good” would include rich harvests and lucky days as well as moralconduct:The nature [that has been received from] heaven and earth is half Yang and halfYin. Insofar as it is Yang, it is good and obtains rewards and remunerations.Insofar as it is Yin, it is bad. The bad man is being punished and his actionsare corrupt. When rewards are many, punishments are few. When there is a lot ofknavery, rewards are few and the gate to corruption is open. . . . The nature[that has been received from] heaven and earth is half good and half bad, so theruler elevates the good to shut out what is corrupt. Promote the good and youwill have good results. Elevate bad people and your results will be bad. (TPJ p.702, Chao, part 9)5. [chapter_17.xhtml#rch17fn5] This is said from the prognosticator’s point ofview.6. [chapter_17.xhtml#rch17fn6] This phrase is repeated frequently, with minorvariations, throughout layer A (TPJ 103.244 and 245; 104.260; 137.384; 152.421;156.440; 177.518; 191.588; 207.654; p. 648, Chao, part 7). Its meaning isexpressed as “I can’t tell you all and give you only the main points” (TPJ158.446) or “I can’t change it. I can only give you the main points and let yousee how it all begins” (TPJ 103.251). This phrase must be seen as a stylisticcharacteristic of layer A.7. [chapter_17.xhtml#rch17fn7] This argument is based on common sense and isstrikingly devoid of moral considerations. Concern with fame is rare in layer A,but it is expressed several times in layer B (TPJ 179.532 and 540; 197.609).8. [chapter_17.xhtml#rch17fn8] Another division into auspicious and inauspiciousmodes of conduct is attempted in section 178 (pp. 520–22), which distinguishesfour auspicious and four inauspicious ways of ruling a country. The fourauspicious modes are the employment of, from top to bottom, a person whoaccumulates merit and achieves permanent stability (chang an 常安), someone whomakes a good administrator, someone who sheds light on his teacher’s doctrine,and someone who believes in this doctrine. The inauspicious modes are theemployment of a man who doesn’t benefit his sovereign, of someone who undertakescriminal activities, of someone who discards the doctrine he has learned, and ofa disbeliever, whom heaven and earth detest.9. [chapter_17.xhtml#rch17fn9] Zhe 道 (this) is understood as shi 適 (to go to);see Yu (2001a: 88). Yu (1997: 53) points to several similar cases in the TPJ andalso to early translations of Buddhist texts.10. [chapter_17.xhtml#rch17fn10] “Model and measure” (fa du 法度) is a term forrules of personal conduct used without specification, as if what was meant wasclear. The warning not to ignore “model and measure” goes back to the Book ofDocuments (Da Yu mou; see Legge 1960, vol. 3, p. 55). In this sense they arealso supposed to guide the personal conduct of the taiping adherent: “When youpersonally stick to model and measure, you will not lose constancy (chang 常)”(TPJ p. 214, Chao, part 4). The Celestial Master integrates the term into hisown argument and proposes that the people’s contribution to cosmic and socialorder can be seen to consist of attending to “model and measure”:When great dao was corrupted the fault lay with the people of lower antiquitywho taught each other to ignore model and measure (shi fa du). (TPJ 208.663)The consequence of such neglect is the end of life:When heaven’s way is in disorder and uproar (luan hui 亂毁), the danger ofextinction arises through the loss of model and measure. (TPJ p. 701, Chao, part9)11. [chapter_17.xhtml#rch17fn11] Dongming 洞明 is the brightness that meditationresults in. It follows after envisaging red, white, and green (TPJ p. 16, Chao,part 2). It is the way in which heaven reflects a man’s heart (TPJ 65.154). Theconcept occurs in the Yunji qiqian (88.9b; referring to a Xian ji zhijue イ山籍旨訣,which is not mentioned elsewhere) in a similar context: when a person looksafter his vital energy properly his inner organs will be dongming.12. [chapter_17.xhtml#rch17fn12] Wei 未 is corrected to mo 末; see Yang 1994: 317.13. [chapter_17.xhtml#rch17fn13] Wei is corrected to mo, as above.14. [chapter_17.xhtml#rch17fn14] The section takes a turn at this point fromstressing “constancy” to stressing the “root.” However, as the root is lost by alack of constancy, the two parts are linked, as pointed out below.15. [chapter_17.xhtml#rch17fn15] For the image of root and branches, see section53.16. [chapter_17.xhtml#rch17fn16] The Celestial Master’s use of the word“constant” must be seen against the background of its prominent position in thefirst line of the Laozi. The TPJ occasionally uses the term “inconstant” in apurely descriptive way, for instance, in the sense that all beings change theirshape with the change of seasons (TPJ p. 221, Chao, part 4), or when water andwind are called inconstant because they can fill a circle as well as a square(p. 738, in a quotation in the Daoyao lingqi shenguipin jing, an anthology ofpassages from pre–Sui dynasty texts). However, “inconstancy” is mainly used topoint to problems, including the joy and anger of the population (TPJ 108.287),good and bad fortune (TPJ 152.414), and flood and drought (TPJ 190.584).Inconstancy needs to be avoided in all these cases, so the passage at hand is byno means isolated.17. [chapter_17.xhtml#rch17fn17] In the TPJ, the expression “to turn into aspirit” or “to become spiritlike\" (cheng shen 成神) is used as if it were atechnical term. It describes one step toward avoiding death and transcendingthis life into otherworldly realms. It is used in this sense in layer B (TPJ182.551; 184.561; 197.609; 198.612) and in the following layer A’ passage:The key to understanding the method of implementing dao and avoiding death liesin making yourself spiritlike. Thus will you transcend the world (du shi 度世), aspledged by heaven. (TPJ 173.511)In the passage at hand, “to turn into a spirit” is seen as a manifestation of asuccessful religious career, as in layer B. In contrast to this usage, insection 54 (p. 78), “to turn into a spirit” is used to describe one step towardbecoming the universe’s savior.18. [chapter_17.xhtml#rch17fn18] This is another statement that runs counter togeneral opinion.19. [chapter_17.xhtml#rch17fn19] With Yu (2001a: 90), the two missing charactersare read as hou he 後何.20. [chapter_17.xhtml#rch17fn20] On the “spiritlike man who bends qi” (wei qi),see above, section 56. Spirit that ranks with life-giving qi can’t move into aman’s belly. One’s Daoist rank is, as we would expect, defined by physical aswell as by spiritual substance.21. [chapter_17.xhtml#rch17fn21] The Xi ci in the Book of Changes says, “Inchange there is the great ultimate, which generates the two modes [of Yin and ofYang]” (Yi jing, “Xi ci” A, p. 43.11). In this section the Celestial Master usesthe “great ultimate” with the same meaning. For him this concept guides themovement of beings and actions between the spheres of Yin and of Yang. The onlyother TPJ reference to the concept is far removed from the Book of Changes:So what do we mean by acting according to the great, medium, and small ultimate?Someone who acts according to the great ultimate is in charge of the realm thatis without outside; someone who acts according to the medium ultimate is incharge of the central realm; and when someone acts according to the smallultimate, everything keeps within its own division. (TPJ 139.396)This reinterpretation of the great ultimate is closer to Ge Hong’s understandingthan to the Book of Changes. For Ge Hong the great ultimate was the heavenlyabode where the transcendents sojourned (Baopu zi waipian 34, “Wu shi” 吳失 p.160).22. [chapter_17.xhtml#rch17fn22] As an aside, and as if what he says is wellknown and clear, the Master here points to the role played by the body spirits.They must not go away; if they do, illness occurs. Tanaka Fumio (1984) has shownthat the TPJ shares the concern for body spirits with the Huangting jing and theBaopu zi. Since their departure was seen as causing illness, these spirits hadto be asked, in ritual form, to come back. For this, the believer fasted andthen envisaged them in great detail (TPJ 109.292). The writing of confessionswas meant to appease heaven and in particular the body spirits, who were itsservants (see Masaaki 2002).23. [chapter_17.xhtml#rch17fn23] The answer does not seem to fit the question.The Master replies that the spiritlike man is spirit of such high quality thathe cannot be transformed into a low-ranking body spirit. The disciple’squestion, however, is concerned with the hierarchy of human rank. The answerseems to take for granted that the worlds of men and of spirits are parallel, asoutlined in much detail in layer B.24. [chapter_17.xhtml#rch17fn24] The summary says:This section examines the essence of heaven’s four modes of conduct, root andbranches, and the great ultimate with the aim of returning back to standard[norms] (I read zheng 正 for zheng 政).SECTION 59. BIG AND SMALL REPROACHES1. [chapter_18.xhtml#rch18fn1] See Mengzi 2B2.2. [chapter_18.xhtml#rch18fn2] See Bielenstein 1984:104.3. [chapter_18.xhtml#rch18fn3] “Fortune and misfortune” (ji xiong 吉凶) is afrequent topic in the TPJ; the two characters occur in the titles of sections 45and 191. “Safety and danger\" (an wei 安危) occurs in the title of section 275.Much of section 58 deals with this topic.4. [chapter_18.xhtml#rch18fn4] “To reproach” (jian 諫) is a layer B term. Someonewho is good (shan) makes use of reproofs (TPJ 185.564), and men who do the rightthing speak up and reproach each other (TPJ 169.530), as opposed to those whodon’t do so (TPJ 182.550). It is said that when three reproofs are not heeded nofurther criticism will be heard (TPJ 188.577). In a Chao passage, it is saidthat reproof must reach the lowliest of the distant regions in the fourdirections so that its inhabitants won’t despair (TPJ 468). Layer B passagesdepict reproach as a way to safeguard personal accomplishment, while in thepassage at hand communal well-being is at stake.5. [chapter_18.xhtml#rch18fn5] Luo (1996: 174) is right when he identifies theexpression miaoyao 妙要 (mysterious) with the yaomiao of Laozi 27, which alsooccurs in TPJ 111.554 (layer B) and p. 214, Chao, part 4.6. [chapter_18.xhtml#rch18fn6] According to Huainan zi 8 “Ben jing” 本經, p. 11b,tian jing 天精, “heaven’s vital beings,” means “natural phenomena,” that is, thesun, moon, stars, constellations, thunder, lightning, wind, and rain. TheHuainan zi sees heaven’s jing as the equivalent of earth’s “balance” (ping 平)and men’s “endowment\" (qing 情), that is, man’s thinking, understanding, andfeeling. In the Laozi zhongjing (老子中經) (see Yunji qiqian 19.2b and 3a) the whiteand yellow qi of “celestial essence” refers to a specific type of jing (sperma).The “lord of celestial essence\" (tian jing jun, or tian jing da jun 天精大君) is abody deity (Yunji qiqian 52.1a–b, based on the Za yao tu jue fa 雜要圖訣法; see also55.8b, in the commentary to a section [Cun shen shen fa 存身神法] that deals withbody deities).The shades of the term jing as used in the TPJ vary. The term means fine,essential qi, as in the Huainan zi, and it also means jing shen, that is,spiritual beings of high rank who reside in the human body but who also act asheaven’s servants and envoys. In discussing the TPJ’s use of the term, Harada(1984) stresses the first aspect and arrives at the convincing conclusion thatin both respects jing is an important element of a human being’s longevity. AsBokenkamp (1993: 47) shows, this is based on the character’s pointing to semenand to menstrual fluid. As agents of procreation, these liquids can be seen asmanifesting the human life force. See also note 12, below.Tian jing occurs only here in the TPJ, and it probably means the same as thefull expression tian jing shen 天精神申 of section 56—they do men the honor ofpartaking in properly administered sacrifices. So the passage at hand talksabout jing and shen spirits from heaven, and qi 祇 spirits from earth.7. [chapter_18.xhtml#rch18fn7] Jin is corrected to ling; see Yu 2001a: 91.8. [chapter_18.xhtml#rch18fn8] According to Lun heng 49 “Shang chong” 商盛, p.719, the growth of all insects has something to do with weather conditions andthus with the relationship between Yin and Yang, for which the government of theday must be held responsible.The five phases are here identified by direction from dong xing 東行 to zhong 中xing. This is unusual. Also, for the rest of this passage I have not managed tofind an exact parallel that would comprise all the same correlations between thefive phases and the damage they may cause.9. [chapter_18.xhtml#rch18fn9] Wang Chong sees the “hot air of the sun” aspoisonous and the south as the place where poison originates (see Lun heng 66“Yan du” 言毒, pp. 949f).10. [chapter_18.xhtml#rch18fn10] Wang Chong sees a need to refute the idea thattigers are particularly prone to devouring men in regions that are poorlyadministered by corrupt officials (see Lun heng 48 “Zao hu” 遭虎, p. 707).11. [chapter_18.xhtml#rch18fn11] Chun qiu fan lu 60 “Wu xing shun ni” 五行順逆, pp.377-80, explains the linkage between water, winter, and the turtle.12. [chapter_18.xhtml#rch18fn12] “Vital qi” (jing qi 精氣) is an expression forspiritual beings, used in parallel and often together with “spirits\" (shen); seeTPJ 153.425 and 211.673, gui shen jing qi 神精氣; p. 698, Chao, part 8, shen mingjing qi 神明精氣; p. 706, Chao, part 9, jing qi gui shen. The expression is alsoused often in layer B: see TPJ 185.563; 186.567, shen jing qi; 187.572. Illnessoccurs if vital qi and spirits are cut off, if their impact does not reach men(TPJ 153.425; cf. 107.284). However, the expression jing qi is also used as“life-giving qi,” for which the Hanyu da cidian (vol. 9, p. 222) refers to Lunheng 65 “Ding gui” 言丁鬼, p. 946. Jing qi is said to bring about knowing, just asbones give strength. This resembles the point made in TPJ p. 723, Chao, part 1:“When dao brings forth men, they are originally all vital qi.”Luo’s interpretation (1996: 176) stresses the six directions and takes its cluesfrom the Huangdi neijing suwen 67 “Wu yun xing da lun” 五運行大論, pp. 15a–25b, whichmentions wind, cold, heat, mildness, dryness, and fire.13. [chapter_18.xhtml#rch18fn13] Wang Ming corrects jing to jingwu 精物 followingthe reading of the Chao, but in this section the single character jing is usedin the meaning of jingwu, as, for instance, in tian jing 天精 in the lastparagraph.14. [chapter_18.xhtml#rch18fn14] “Discuss and deliberate” is expressed by thecompound wei lun si 惟論思; see Yu 2001a: 92.15. [chapter_18.xhtml#rch18fn15] The Chao reads more plausibly, “to secure thepeople’s [in the received text min is corrupted to ju 居] nurturing of all tenthousand plants and beings.”16. [chapter_18.xhtml#rch18fn16] I correct dang 黨 (group), which is rarely usedin the TPJ, to dang 當 (must). Yu Liming (1997: 51) argues that dang 黨 is hereused to mean “to learn,” which, according to the Fang yan, is Chu usage.However, Yu admits that the character is rarely used in this sense.17. [chapter_18.xhtml#rch18fn17] The general understanding of “sincerity\" (cheng誠) as a virtue through which we implement what we have understood, or throughwhich spiritual achievement becomes physically manifest, is the background forthe Celestial Master’s use of the term, for this is the virtue in men that movesheaven (TPJ 63.134; 83.210; 131.342; p. 719, Chao, part 1). To be “sincere” isto be “true” (shi 實) (TPJ 153.425), and the opposite of “deceitful” (qi 欺) (TPJp. 221, Chao, part 4; 131.344; 152.414). Section 153 gives detailed informationon the term. Heaven’s concern with the lack of complete sincerity among men hascaused it to send the Perfected to learn from the Celestial Master. Throughcomplete sincerity, a man corresponds to heaven and earth (153.425). His impacton heaven derives from the fact that his actions are oriented toward it:As for “complete sincerity,” when we call a man completely sincere we mean thathe either looks up to heaven when he acts and achieves things by imitatingheaven’s way, or that he looks down to earth and reforms things by reflectingits virtue. . . . So the sun reigns as king through fire. It is a [source of]correctness for heaven and brings everything to light. Therefore, when a man iscompletely sincere he sets right all that is troubling, from within his heart.The heart’s spirit in its complete wisdom informs the sun, which then informsheaven. In this way, complete sincerity of the five inner organs moves spiritsand other numinous beings (shen ling 神靈). . . . When a man in complete sincerityis concerned about something, he approaches troubles from within his heart.Documenting [the state of] the heart, the stomach won’t take any nourishment [Iread er 而 as neng 倉邑 with Long 2000: 879]. What is at issue is the heart, thewill. When there is something heart and will can’t forget, the liver presentsitself as most humane (ren). And since it rules the eyes, they shed tears. Thisis what is meant by the completely sincere way in which vital energy thinks(jing si 精思). . . . So all human action in search of dao and virtue starts fromcomplete sincerity. Heaven and earth respond to it, spirits and other numinousbeings come to announce it. Without complete sincerity, men won’t have an impacton heaven and earth, and they won’t influence spirits and other numinous beings.Thus since the inheriting and transmitting [of evil] commenced, the men of laterantiquity have been truly without faith (xin 信), they have lacked completesincerity, and they have not had impact on heaven and earth, but instead havedeceived them. So spirits and other numinous beings do harm without end. (TPJ153.426–27).Tsuchiya Masaaki (2002: 45–51) adds an important perspective to this, as he sees“sincerity” as telling the truth when confessing offenses. This can help toexplain why a sincere person does not suffer from illness. A believer’sself-critical, penitent attitude makes the spirits who watch over him return totheir places in his body and thus restore his health. This also provides anotherpossible explanation of why heaven responds to a man’s sincerity. It is moved bythe confession of sins, just as a judge might show leniency toward the culpritwho admits his guilt.18. [chapter_18.xhtml#rch18fn18] This is how men must behave toward the fourseasons (TPJ 140.400), toward heaven’s way (204.630), and toward the good (TPJ103.250). It is only here that the two characters jin shun 謹 横 occur without anaccompanying object.19. [chapter_18.xhtml#rch18fn19] This passage goes back to the Shi jing song(no. 166) “Tian bao” 天保 (heaven protects you). The meaning of bao is hereexpressed by you 祐 (to help), but the term tian bao occurs a little furtherdown, on p. 101 of this section. The song addresses the lord (as translated byKarlgren 1950:109):Heaven protects and secures you, doing it very solidly; it causes you to berichly endowed (hou 厚); what felicity is not heaped [on you]?20. [chapter_18.xhtml#rch18fn20] This passage mentions in close proximity thetwo contradictory functions of “unusual occurrences.” They communicate heaven’swill and are thus a sign of its benevolence. They are also the means by whichhumankind will eventually be exterminated.21. [chapter_18.xhtml#rch18fn21] “Self-reflection\" (zi zhao 自照) is a way to healillness:When your innermost heart entertains evil intentions, uproar develops in distantregions and your spirits (shen qi 神氣) spread about faster than thunder andlightning. You must then urgently make spirits and other enlightened beings(shen ming 神明) return so that self-reflection takes place. Thus illness ishealed and men are well governed. (TPJ pp. 722f., Chao, part 1)22. [chapter_18.xhtml#rch18fn22] The text is perhaps corrupt, but there is noobvious emendation. Neither the phrase zhi tian 知天 nor the phrase tian de shi天得失 occurs elsewhere in the TPJ. The reading of the Chao differs, which mightpoint to problems with the textual transmission: “Through self-reflection theymade their conduct upright and knew of themselves about gain and loss (zi zhi deshi 自知得失).”The quotation ends at this point. The Chao quotes section 59 morefully than other sections and places it prominently at the end of part three. Wemust assume that the passage was already difficult when the Chao was written. Ihave changed tian 天 to zhi 知 in an attempt to achieve some parallelism with thepreceding sentence. The text, then, would read yi shen zhi zhi de shi ye 以深知知得失也. It is quite plausible that some corruption occurred around the reduplicatedzhi.23. [chapter_18.xhtml#rch18fn23] See above, 47.55 (zhenyao dao zhi wen), andsection 154, passim, where “essential dao” (yao dao 要道) is used similarly to daoin its ontological sense (“Now heaven creates beings through essential, truedao. . .” [TPJ 154.430]), and also in the sense of “doctrine” (“educate andreform the small-minded through essential dao and virtue” [TPJ 154.432], or “Nowessential dao and excellent (shan) virtue come forth to educate thesmall-minded” [TPJ 154.430]).24. [chapter_18.xhtml#rch18fn24] The main concern of this section is that anofficial must be frank with his superior, so even when stressing that reproachmust be mutual, the emphasis is on its upward direction. Through thejuxtaposition of heaven and earth, even heaven is included in this scheme, whichthen naturally also includes the ruler.25. [chapter_18.xhtml#rch18fn25] Biange 變革 is a Li ji (34 “Da zhuan” 大傅,p.1506c) term for “reform.”26. [chapter_18.xhtml#rch18fn26] This is Mengzi’s (2B2) point of view.27. [chapter_18.xhtml#rch18fn27] Xian ru 賢儒 (worthy and learned) is a regularTPJ word for officials of rank (TPJ 62.128, 65.155, 66.162), as it is in, forinstance, Lun heng 40 “Zhuang liu,” pp. 619–22. It is clear that the officialswho were expected to implement taiping reforms were the officials of the day.28. [chapter_18.xhtml#rch18fn28] These last sentences, starting with “the lorddeaf and the official dumb,” are of unusual rhetorical vigor. This is achievedby the persistent juxtaposing of ruler and servant, by a sequence of brieffour-character sentences, and by the use of rhymes; see Yu (2001a: 93f.).29. [chapter_18.xhtml#rch18fn29] The summary says:This section provides correct instruction on heaven’s reproaches.SECTION 60. HOW BOOKS ILLUSTRATE [RULE BY] PUNISHMENT AND [BY] VIRTUE1. [chapter_19.xhtml#rch19fn1] John Major (1987) argues that the two terms xing刑 and de 德 are used with two distinct meanings. One meaning is similar to HanFeizi’s “two handles,” that is, punishment and reward (or “punishment and favor”in Watson’s [1964: 30] translation). The other is, in Major’s translation,“recision and accretion,” referring to the annual cycle of Yin and Yang growthand decline. However, the function of xing and de for distinguishing days andlarger units of the calendar is more complex than the simple correspondence withthe flux between Yin and Yang. Marc Kalinowski (1995) has explained the yearlyand daily sequence of xing and de situations in great detail on the basis of theMawangdui manuscript Xing de and what Kalinowski calls its cord-hook diagram. Heconcludes that the purpose of the Xing de was prognostic. Donald Harper (1999:849–51) has pointed out that the multiplicity of xing de’s astro-calendricalfunction must be kept in mind in reading the Huainan zi’s “Treatise on thePatterns of Heaven\" (tian wen 天文), on which Major bases his understanding.For the section at hand calendrical and hemerological speculation is of littlerelevance. The cycle of xing and de stands for Yin/Yang-based seasonal change,but it is clear that the cosmological meaning of the terms cannot be separatedfrom their political context. Here they mean “reign by punishment” and “reign byvirtue.” The passage at the beginning of p. 108 does not allow any otherexplanation. What the benign ruler is asked to achieve is a continuing reign byvirtue, impossible as this might be from a cosmological point of view. Theargument goes that the ideal way of acting is not an imitation of nature assuch, but rather an imitation of certain specific patterns or methods that canbe observed in nature.2. [chapter_19.xhtml#rch19fn2] See de Crespigny 1980; cf. also Watanabe’s (2001)account of the debate toward the end of the second and the beginning of thethird century C.E. between those who promoted “lenient rule” and those whopromoted “severe government.”3. [chapter_19.xhtml#rch19fn3] See Balazs 1964: 208-11; de Crespigny 1980:44-51.4. [chapter_19.xhtml#rch19fn4] Hou Han shu 53.1741, in de Crespigny’stranslation (1980: 54), slightly modified.5. [chapter_19.xhtml#rch19fn5] I read the two missing characters as jin wei, as,for instance, used in TPJ 44.42: jin wei tian shi wei qi chenlie 今唯天師為其陳歹 (Ifonly the Celestial Master were to explain in detail . . .).6. [chapter_19.xhtml#rch19fn6] The Celestial Master places shen 才申 and qi 祇spirits, that is, the spirits of heaven and earth, in a lowly position justabove humankind and the ten thousand beings (TPJ 127.323). However, they do asheaven does (TPJ p. 212, Chao, part 4) and thus hold certain moral power overmen: when they accuse a man, he has no place to escape (TPJ 78.189; see also TPJ132.354). Their coming and going among men is a positive sign (TPJ 129.336).7. [chapter_19.xhtml#rch19fn7] Mingzheng fa: The cluster of mingzheng明[images/img_0010.jpg] (token), as also used below in this section (pp. 244, 246and 250) and fa 法 (model) does not occur anywhere else in the text. Fa seems toact as a gloss for mingzheng.8. [chapter_19.xhtml#rch19fn8] Tian wen 天文 is used throughout the TPJ forastronomical phenomena and for texts issuing from heaven. Occasionally wen seemsto mean a combination of the two, just as “dao” is an ordering principle and thedoctrine that explains it.9. [chapter_19.xhtml#rch19fn9] Raorao 擾擾 (in confusion) is a term a quietistthinker would use to describe the world of daily life and worries when lookingat it from a distance (Zhuangzi 35.13.44). The best example is in the Liezi (3“Zhou Mu Wang” 周參王, p. 110; cf. Graham 1991: 71), where a man whose memory hasjust been restored complains about all his likes and dislikes returning to him“in confusion.” Throughout section 60 the word is used for “the world as it is,”as opposed to what is explicitly “good” and brings forth life (p. 106,beginning). Thus punishment is said to increase “confusion” (p. 108, beginning),and in this sense the Master’s writings deal with “confusion” (p. 110, middle).The word is characteristic of this section. It occurs here more often than inthe rest of the transmitted text.10. [chapter_19.xhtml#rch19fn10] This integrates the topic at hand with Yi jingsymbolism. Each amount of punishment and virtue has its distinctive place in theorder of the sixty-four hexagrams. A “nine” line is an uninterrupted, Yang-typeline. “In the first place” means that it is positioned at the bottom, where thecounting starts.11. [chapter_19.xhtml#rch19fn11] This is one of the seven imaginary places wherexing and de can be found, according to the Huainan zi (3.11a–12b; see Major1987: 284f.). In the TPJ, there are only six distinct places: chamber, hall,court, gate, roads and alleys, and distant fields. Nevertheless, thesimilarities are such that the TPJ passage must come from material similar tothe Huainan zi:[images/img_0006.jpg]In the TPJ the “outside” consists of distant places at the end of the world, andthe inside is as far below the ground as the Yellow Springs.12. [chapter_19.xhtml#rch19fn12] A “six” line is an interrupted Yin-type line.From the top position lines are imagined as leaving the hexagram.13. [chapter_19.xhtml#rch19fn13] The expression shizhong 士果 (cohorts) ischaracteristic of this passage. It occurs in only two other places in the text.In section 64 (p. 143) it is said that to scare shizhong through severity andthe use of punishment is poor leadership. In layer B (TPJ 179.534), the word isused for the spirits of heaven and of earth as they are addressed by theCelestial Lord. The arguments raised throughout section 60 seem to point to thecreation of regional power bases through attracting large groups of followers,which was a feature of the outgoing Han dynasty. In some instances, we mustimagine these supporters to be spirits; in others they are the civil andmilitary followers of a lord, regardless of the size of his reign. The exampleof Liu An comes to mind. In the outgoing Han dynasty the large number of clientswhom certain patrons managed to assemble became a political force.14. [chapter_19.xhtml#rch19fn14] Here the Yellow Springs are not so much theabode of the dead but a place deep down in the ground where, according to theMengzi (3B.10), earthworms drink.15. [chapter_19.xhtml#rch19fn15] The hall, which at this stage is the abode ofvirtue, is here and further below, on p. 245, given the honorific name Hall ofLight, which was a center of Han dynasty ritual concerns. When it is the turn ofpunishment to abide there it is called “hall” (see p. 245).16. [chapter_19.xhtml#rch19fn16] The prognostic meaning of xing and de istouched on at this point. Plants and all beings must make sure whether xing orde reigns before they make a move. It was considered particularly important forthe military strategist to be able to distinguish a xing situation from a desituation: see Kalinowski 1995: 84.17. [chapter_19.xhtml#rch19fn17] This is the position punishment occupies in theninth month; see below, p. 106. Lun heng 31 “Tan tian” 談天, p. 478 explains thataccording to Zou Yan the “middle of heaven\" (tian zhong 天中) is the constellationPole. This agrees with the TPJ. The celestial North Pole is said to be heaven’scenter (TPJ p. 20, Chao, part 2).18. [chapter_19.xhtml#rch19fn18] “Six distances and eight borders” (六遠八境) is anunusual expression. TPJ 104.258 says that someone who wishes to completely tidyup (zheng 正) the six distances and eight regions (liu yuan ba fang 六遠八方) mustfirst turn to what is in his own person (nei 内).19. [chapter_19.xhtml#rch19fn19] Zong 從 (to follow) must be corrected to xi 徙(to move); see Yu (2001a: 97). The Chao reads tu 徒 (on foot).20. [chapter_19.xhtml#rch19fn20] This is a new account of instances that thecourse of the year and political policy have in common. It is not in the Huainanzi passage on xing and de. It here strengthens the Celestial Master’s basicproposition of a correspondence between the two realms.21. [chapter_19.xhtml#rch19fn21] They are, according to Zhou li, for instance,“Di guan, Da si tu” 地官大司徒, p. 707b: knowledge, humaneness, wisdom,righteousness, loyalty, and harmony.22. [chapter_19.xhtml#rch19fn22] This dramatic moment is described in thefollowing manner in the Huainan zi:When the power of Yin is like that of Yang, punishment and virtue are both atthe gate. In the eighth and the second months, qi of Yin and Yang are in balanceand the portions of day and night are equal. For this reason we say thatpunishment and virtue are both at the gate (Huainan zi 3.12a; see Major 1993:87).23. [chapter_19.xhtml#rch19fn23] The expression nei fu 内附 is used in this sensein Lun heng 58 “Hui guo” 恢國, p. 825.24. [chapter_19.xhtml#rch19fn24] This is expressed by bu ye 不也. Yu (2001b: 467)explains that this use of the phrase, which he terms “colloquial,” occurs in Handynasty material only in the TPJ.25. [chapter_19.xhtml#rch19fn25] Zong 從 is corrected to xi 徙; see Yu (2001a:98).26. [chapter_19.xhtml#rch19fn26] Tian 天 is here erroneous and must be correctedto fu 夫. “Heaven’s punishment” is of a different order.27. [chapter_19.xhtml#rch19fn27] Here human beings are seen to react to others’behavior as natural forces react to each other. So norms for human conductresemble natural laws, and infringements are seen to have drastic consequences.28. [chapter_19.xhtml#rch19fn28] The standards that the Master points to stemfrom astronomical as well as prognostic and calendrical reasoning. Since he seesa need to refer to them in support of his faith in heaven we may assume thatthey were more widely respected than heaven’s divine role. The expression liujia represents here and throughout the TPJ the whole system of heavenly stemsand earthly branches (cf. Hanyu da cidian, vol. 2, p. 28).29. [chapter_19.xhtml#rch19fn29] The two missing characters are read as yan ying言應: yan is used here as it is used a little further down in wu shu yan 吾書言 andthroughout the TPJ, and ying is used here as it is used in TPJ 134.370, gu wushu ying tian jiao 故吾書應天教.30. [chapter_19.xhtml#rch19fn30] This translation is tentative. It attempts todo justice to the context, but it goes against the common understanding of wai 外as male and nei 内 as female, as observed by Luo 1996: 197, where he translates,“When the legitimate emperor rules he abolishes the power of empresses andeunuchs (this is “Yin”); under female rule a system of punishments isintroduced.” The difficulty with this version is the translation of chu 出 as “toabolish.” In the rest of this section, chu is “to bring forth.” Yu (2001a: 101)tries to solve this problem by transposing the positions of chu and ru 入.31. [chapter_19.xhtml#rch19fn31] “Teacher” and “model” (shi fa 師法) are prominentterms in the Xunzi (24.8.107–8 and 87.23.6), where it is said that morality hasno chance unless someone has both.32. [chapter_19.xhtml#rch19fn32] The two missing characters are read as xinxiao信效, as in TPJ 152.414: zi yu zhong zhi qi da xinxiao 子欲重知其大信效.33. [chapter_19.xhtml#rch19fn33] The summary says:This section is based on the model of heaven. It clarifies how governments informer times and nowadays, in earlier and later periods, came to win and tolose.SECTION 61. ON DIGGING UP SOIL AND PUBLISHING BOOKS1. [chapter_20.xhtml#rch20fn1] See below, 61.114 and 125.2. [chapter_20.xhtml#rch20fn2] Cf. Callicott and Ames (1989).3. [chapter_20.xhtml#rch20fn3] See Huainan zi 8 “Ben jing” 本經.4. [chapter_20.xhtml#rch20fn4] See Laojun shuo yibai bashi jie, precepts 47,101, and 100 (cf. Hendrischke and Penny 1996).5. [chapter_20.xhtml#rch20fn5] See sections 209 and 210.6. [chapter_20.xhtml#rch20fn6] On p. 122.7. [chapter_20.xhtml#rch20fn7] I read the two missing characters as huan ye 患也.You huan 優患 occurs frequently; see, for instance, TPJ 207.652: tian chang yi shiwei you huan 天常以是為優患. The Chao reads you yu 優預, which does not make sense andseems to indicate that the text was corrupt at the time the Chao was produced.Yu 2001a: 101 reads yu ye 預也.8. [chapter_20.xhtml#rch20fn8] See Lun yu (15.8) on the need to address theright audience when speaking.9. [chapter_20.xhtml#rch20fn9] Yu 與 (with) is corrected to yu 輿 (cart); see Yu(2001a: 102). Retaliation for evil deeds is as certain as that a shadow willfollow a figure.10. [chapter_20.xhtml#rch20fn10] The original text is perhaps incomplete. Thestudent did not say anything. On the other hand, the Master’s remark is puzzlingeven to the student, as the next question shows.11. [chapter_20.xhtml#rch20fn11] The height of a tall man is one zhang 丈; seebelow, 61.117.12. [chapter_20.xhtml#rch20fn12] “Apprehensive and anxious\" (kunyi 個恨) are twocharacters characteristic of this section. They occur here, on p. 114, speakingabout earth, and again on p. 117 with respect to the disciple, as in TPJ 60.104,and also on p. 112, when the disciple describes his feelings. Another occurrenceis in TPJ 127.318, at a mention of heaven’s anxiety. In the TPJ, kun occurs onlyin combination with yi and does not, as Yu (1997: 50) points out, mean “sincere”(see Hanyu da cidian vol. 7, p. 544) but stands for kun 困.13. [chapter_20.xhtml#rch20fn13] Toward the end, this section gives anotherexplanation for the novelty of the prohibition: the proximity of the new era ofgreat peace creates the need to stick to prohibitions more closely than men didin the past. Both passages agree about the novelty of the prohibition. TheMaster claims that heaven did not make the prohibition known before thestudent’s questions forced the Master to discuss the matter. This assumption isnot historically correct. The Shi ji (88. 2570) reports that Meng Tian 蒙 括, theFirst Emperor’s general and architect of the Great Wall, at first declaredhimself innocent when condemned to commit suicide by the First Emperor’s son andsuccessor: “By which crime did I offend heaven? I die innocent.” However, hesoon recollected, “I am guilty and deserve to die. When constructing the linkbetween Liaodong and Lintiao, a wall of more than ten thousand miles, I couldnot avoid cutting the veins of the earth. This is my crime.” Sima Qian arguesthat Meng was wrong. His real crime had been cruelty against men, and that iswhy he deserved death. Wang Chong, who quotes the passage (Lun heng 21 “Huo xu”禍虛, pp. 275f.), can see some sense in Meng Tian’s words, as if it were indeedwrong to hurt the earth, but he doesn’t see heaven in the role of a punishingsovereign. Wang Chong’s conclusion provides the intellectual background againstwhich the Celestial Master directs his arguments. It is the following, inForke’s (1962, vol. 1, p. 172) translation:Yet one succeeds, the other fails; one gets on, the other falls off, one ispenniless, the other well-to-do, one thriving, the other ruined. All this is theresult of chance and luck, and the upshot of fate and time. (Lun heng, p. 281)14. [chapter_20.xhtml#rch20fn14] This image of heaven and earth as a marriedcouple has a replica in the Chun qiu fan lu (38 “Wu xing dui” 五行對, p. 316),where it is said that earth does not call her achievements her own. So we saythat “heaven rains\" (tian yu 天雨) and “heaven raises wind\" (tian feng 天風),despite the fact that rain and wind are earth’s doing. The account of heaven andearth in this section is more anthropomorphic than is usual in the TPJ. Earthtalks heaven into punishing men for disrespecting her, heaven resembles an angryfather who doesn’t get on with this son, and men hold heaven responsible fortheir misery, in the same way as they accuse a bad ruler.15. [chapter_20.xhtml#rch20fn15] Disobedience of heaven and accusations againstheaven are juxtaposed with disobedience and accusations in regard to politicalleaders. Both of these types of accusation are seen as particularly severe formsof disobedience and are thus said to intensify the consequences of trespasses.16. [chapter_20.xhtml#rch20fn16] This section contains an unusual number ofreminders that both the Celestial Master and his disciples speak for heaven.This can be explained by the relative novelty of the matter under discussion.17. [chapter_20.xhtml#rch20fn17] This is a tall and a big man, when we considerthat, as the Han shu says (21A “Lüli zhi,” p. 966), one zhang is always ten“feet\" (chi 尺) long. Yanzi 晏子, for instance, who was known as having been small,was supposed to have been less than six chi tall (see Yanzi chun qiu 5.25, p.146). The legendary Emperor Yao was supposed to have been ten feet tall (KongCongzi 7 “Ju wei” 居闈, p. 40). Ten spans was given as the size of a big tree(Hanyu da cidian vol. 1, p. 827), but there is also the Shi shuo xin yu (14“Rong zhi” 容止, p. 161) passage, which mentions a person who is seven chi talland ten spans big.18. [chapter_20.xhtml#rch20fn18] Qu 齲 insects were known to cause toothache (seeMorohashi [1985] no. 48716). However, I have not found parallels for this andthe following passages in any medical material.19. [chapter_20.xhtml#rch20fn19] In the Han dynasty, ten cun 寸 were one chi,usually translated as “foot,” and said to have been about nine inches (see Swann1950: 362). Needless to say, this is not plausible for section 61. An insect ofalmost an inch is not “tiny,” and a man ten feet tall, that is, one “zhang,” isa giant.20. [chapter_20.xhtml#rch20fn20] Kou kou 口口 is corrected to the sign for twomissing characters, which are read as fan fu 反復, as suggested by Yu (2001a:105).21. [chapter_20.xhtml#rch20fn21] To be more precise, these are the three worms,san chong 三盛, that exist in a man’s belly. The text deals with them at somelength in another context, where the assaults of intestinal parasites areparalleled to men’s unruliness and the occurrence of natural disasters (TPJ136.378-80).22. [chapter_20.xhtml#rch20fn22] Yi 億 stands for one million here, following thefigure of shi wan 十萬, which does not occur elsewhere in the text. The generalsequence (see TPJ 67.169 and passim) is qian, wan, yi, which makes yi into “onehundred thousand.” Morohashi (1985; no. 1178), quoting a Shi jing (no. 249; cf.Karlgren 1950: 204f.) passage, argues that one hundred thousand (shi wan) is thecharacter’s oldest meaning, that hundred million (wan wan) came later, and that“one million\" (bai wan) and “ten million\" (qian wan) occur occasionally.23. [chapter_20.xhtml#rch20fn23] The TPJ is by no means alone in this socialcritique. Poo 1990) has collected accounts of burials, most of them highlycritical. The following passage is from a memorial in which Liu Xiang tries toprevent the emperor from building his own mausoleum. It is quoted here in fullsince it resembles taiping concerns:When Chang mausoleum (chang ling 昌陵) was built, height was added to smallmounds, and earth was piled up into a mountain. People’s graves were destroyed,to the extent of tens of thousands, to make room for the building of mortuarystructures. The schedule was pressing, and the cost amounted to more than onemillion. The dead underground were in grief and the living up above in distress(chou 愁). Resentful (yuan 怨) feelings upset Yin and Yang, which caused famines.Hundreds of thousands of men perished or were made homeless. (Han shu 36.1956;translation, slightly modified, by Poo 1990: 49)It was commonly believed that digging up soil created a problem. Grave-securingwrits from the second century C.E. often include a passage of apology to theearth’s spirits for the disturbance caused by entombing the dead; see WuRongzeng 1981.24. [chapter_20.xhtml#rch20fn24] “A good canal is scoured by its own water” ishow it is phrased in the Zhou li (“Dong guan kao gong” 冬官考工, p. 933a). ZhangRong, a contemporary of Wang Mang, argued in detail how too much irrigationslowed the flow of water and thus increased the build-up of sediment (Needham1971: 229).25. [chapter_20.xhtml#rch20fn25] This is an editorial note that does not signifya change of topic. For a similar use of you yan 又言, see TPJ 48.57f. Yu (2001a:106) attempts to correct yan (to speak) to wang 妄 (at random), which occursseveral times in this passage. This still leaves the problem of you; ren wang 人妄might be more appropriate, but there is really no need to change the text.26. [chapter_20.xhtml#rch20fn26] From the limited material assembled by Hsu(1980: 255–75) on irrigation projects, the Han dynasty experts placed at leastas much stress on building new canals as they did on the repair of existingfacilities, if not more. This seems to be what the Celestial Master intends tocriticize here.27. [chapter_20.xhtml#rch20fn27] The three-character compound bing ji tong 病疾痛,which occurs only here, is typical of the TPJ’s word formation. The translationtries to do justice to the expression’s rhetorical value.28. [chapter_20.xhtml#rch20fn28] Judging by the other measures given in thispassage—the size of a man, supposedly ten feet, and the size of a tiny insect,which is said to be one cun (inch)—we must assume that the three feet mentionedhere amount to less than the 70 cm that tables of Han dynasty measures(Twitchett and Loewe 1986: xxxviii) would suggest.29. [chapter_20.xhtml#rch20fn29] Liji 9 “Li yun” 禮運, p. 1416a, says that theancient kings had no houses, but lived in caves during the winter and in nestsin summer.30. [chapter_20.xhtml#rch20fn30] This answer makes man more the spirits’plaything than is customary in the TPJ, or would be appropriate for amerit-oriented depiction of the spiritual world.31. [chapter_20.xhtml#rch20fn31] Gu xiang 故才目 is corrected to gu xiang 故郎, as inLuo’s (1996: 218) translation. It is said in the Yi jing (hexagram 48, p. 29)that when you move into a new abode you must not change the wells.32. [chapter_20.xhtml#rch20fn32] This serves as an introduction to a newdialogue and could introduce a new section. As it stands, section 61 isunusually long.33. [chapter_20.xhtml#rch20fn33] This question, which seems to take up thestudent’s last remark, could be one reason why the following dialogue was puthere.34. [chapter_20.xhtml#rch20fn34] This is the central taiping message: men mustmake heaven happy, which will then create great peace; great peace enables mento live long.35. [chapter_20.xhtml#rch20fn35] “In fear,” and “fearful” in the next paragraph,are both expressed by hai 駭, with the radical “horse.” The same character isused on p. 125 in “how alarming”: ke hai zai, ke hai zai 可駭哉. The same meaningis expressed on other occasions by hai, with the radical “heart,” as, forinstance, on p. 122: “how frightening.” Yu Liming (1997: 50; the quotations arenot quite accurate) points out that this use of hai (with the “heart” radical)is nonstandard and that both forms of the character are used in section 61. Thisdifference can perhaps be explained by a difference in note takers for the first(before the phrase “Step forward!”) and second dialogues. No similar explanationis possible for section 78, however, which also has both forms of the character(pp. 189 and 191). The variations are proof of the leniency of the text’ssixth-century editors.36. [chapter_20.xhtml#rch20fn36] With Yu (2001a: 108) I read wei 未 for fa 法.37. [chapter_20.xhtml#rch20fn37] With Yu (2001a: 108) the two missing charactersare read as fan fu 反復; cf. TPJ 132:350.38. [chapter_20.xhtml#rch20fn38] As Confucius’s disciples did; see Lun yu 1.1.39. [chapter_20.xhtml#rch20fn39] I read zhi 知 (to know) for he 和 (harmony).40. [chapter_20.xhtml#rch20fn40] The wording is zhi he yi e bu ping ye 治何一惡不平也,which is perhaps corrupt. Punctuation and attribution to speakers are my own. Yu2001a: 109 sticks to Wang Ming’s text and punctuation.41. [chapter_20.xhtml#rch20fn41] I read de 得 (to be able to) for fu 復 (again).42. [chapter_20.xhtml#rch20fn42] The Celestial Master often points to futuredevelopments to prove his point. He argues, for instance, that his text must bestudied and taiping reforms must be undertaken because once this has happenedpeople will see the improvement (TPJ 50.66; 57.92; 65.152).43. [chapter_20.xhtml#rch20fn43] For “long-lasting stability\" (chang an 長安), seeabove, section 50.44. [chapter_20.xhtml#rch20fn44] With Yu (2001a: 109), I read the two missingcharacters as yuan jin 冤今.45. [chapter_20.xhtml#rch20fn45] For these ranks, see above, section 56.46. [chapter_20.xhtml#rch20fn46] The term “heaven’s subjects\" (tian min 天民) ishere used as in the Mengzi (7A19), where it is said that heaven’s subjectspractice only what is of value to the whole world (Lau 1970: 185), as opposed to“the ruler’s men\" (jun ren), who are at a ruler’s command, and to “community’sofficials,” who serve the interests of a particular community. Mengzi proposesthat only “great men” with overriding moral power are in rank above heaven’ssubjects. Tian min does not seem to be a Daoist term, except for the difficultZhuangzi passage (63.23.43), according to which heaven’s subjects are those menwhom others must let go (Graham 1981: 103). Its use in this TPJ passage alignsit closely with the “good people,” or, in later language use, the “seed people,”that is, the believers in dao. Cf. section 66, below, and the following passagein the Preface to the Double Character Talismans of the Scripture on Great Peace(Taiping jing fuwen xu):When a renchen 壬辰 (year) comes around we will see the wise lord (sheng jun 聖君)descend and will experience the perfect order of great peace. Nobletranscendents will manage affairs, and the subjects of heaven will be rewarded.(TPJ p. 745)47. [chapter_20.xhtml#rch20fn47] See below, section 65, for a similar argument;good people bring about a good ruler, an ideal ruler.48. [chapter_20.xhtml#rch20fn48] See below, section 66, for details on thelimits within which prayers might improve the culprit’s lot.49. [chapter_20.xhtml#rch20fn49] The summary says:This section explains the grievances of heaven and earth.SECTION 62. DAO IS PRICELESS AND OVERCOMES YI AND DI BARBARIANS1. [chapter_21.xhtml#rch21fn1] Wolfgang Bauer translated most of this sectioninto German in 1971 as part of his China and the Search for Happiness, which wastranslated into English in 1976; cf. Bauer 1976: 121–24.2. [chapter_21.xhtml#rch21fn2] The Master no longer resides on earth but inheaven, in the celestial North Pole, as has been established in section 54. Thedisciples will eventually follow in the Master’s footsteps, as stated in section63. As the Master puts it:I have already departed from the world and cannot reappear among the people as Imight choose. Therefore, I have handed the book to you, Perfected. You are alsoleaving the world behind, however, and will thus be unable to teach the people.So I ask you to search for honest people with full understanding, hand it tothem, and let them quickly deposit it with a virtuous ruler. What an offense itwould be not to go and hand it over but to remain inactive and keep it. (TPJ103.255)For the present, however, the disciple is in charge of initiating the missionarymovement, as explained below, in section 65.3. [chapter_21.xhtml#rch21fn3] The Celestial Master’s own writings are dao shu;see TPJ 66.161: wu dao shu 吾道. They rank first in certain textual hierarchies:The first group is writings on spiritlike dao (shen dao shu), the second istexts that examine affairs, the third is reports that oppose frivolous andsuperficial material. They all teach what is appropriate (da shun 大順). (TPJ p.718, Chao, part 1, and quoted with textual variants in Yunji qiqian 6 as “TPJ,part 1” see TPJ p. 9)Another word for the Celestial Master’s writings is san dao shu 三道書; see below,section 65.4. [chapter_21.xhtml#rch21fn4] I read the two missing characters as wu shang 無上;see TPJ 55.87: zui you da wu shang 最優大無上.5. [chapter_21.xhtml#rch21fn5] This is an auspicious portent; see, for instance,Li Ji’s 李奇 (from Nanyang, as Yan Shigu tells us in his introduction; see Hanshu, p. 4) commentary on Han shu 58.2632, as quoted by Yan Shigu: “In a world ofgreat peace the sun has a halo, which means it is a double sun.”6. [chapter_21.xhtml#rch21fn6] Not to use official insignia is an expression ofwu wei 無為:When emperors and kings act accordingly the world will prosper. Laying down theofficial insignia and practicing nonaction, they transcend the world and livelong lives. (TPJ pp. 688f., Chao, part 8)Someone who lays down the official insignia and practices nonaction drives awayall ill luck. (TPJ p. 307, Chao, part 5)7. [chapter_21.xhtml#rch21fn7] Although such fights were a constant feature ofpolitical life, it can be argued that the controversies between the “cleanparty,” made up of career officials, and their upstart enemies during the reignof Emperor Ling (r. 168–89) were among the most prominent of these fights.8. [chapter_21.xhtml#rch21fn8] Qi ping refers to the balancing of naturalforces. Qi is here tian qi (heaven’s qi); see TPJ 132.362 and 208.666.9. [chapter_21.xhtml#rch21fn9] I follow Long (2000: 262) in correcting tu 土(soil) to shi 士 (scholar) (see also Yu 2001a: 113) and he 和 (harmony) to si 私(private). Yu (2001a: 113) suggests reading zhi 知 (to know) for he. The passageis an attack on the formation of schools and perhaps also on the attempts bypowerful individuals to assemble not only their own armies, but also pools ofadvisors. Guanzi 45 “Ren fa” 任法, p. 256 uses the expression si shi in thismeaning. The conclusion the Master’s disciples are expected to draw is clear.They are not meant to take the initiative in the political realm but are toremain in the background in a supportive, advisory function.10. [chapter_21.xhtml#rch21fn10] As Luo (1996: 225) points out, this passageresembles Laozi 32 read in the way of the Xiang’er commentary (p. 12), which inBokenkamp’s translation (1997: 133) reads:Text: The populace would naturally make themselves equals (jun 均) without havingbeen ordered to do so.Commentary: When the king reveres the Dao, his officers and subjects will desireto emulate him. They will not fear laws and regulations, but the spirits ofheaven. They will not dare commit wrongs but will desire only to perfect theirbodies. They will make themselves equals without having been commanded to do so.Jun is used in the TPJ in the sense of adjusting differences of social rank:When heaven and earth bring about equality (shi hua de jun 施化得均), the honoredand the lowly, great and small men are all alike and don’t fight with eachother, so that the ruler becomes [like] father and mother. (TPJ 213.683)Sharing things has something to do with this:When someone receives life (ming 命) from heaven and is then in his behavior(gong xing qi 共行 氣) not harmonious and fair (tiao jun 調均) in what he gives awayto others (yu ze 與澤), the world will not be at peace. He behaves like anofficial who, although employed (ming) by emperors and kings, turns away fromhis superiors and, smiling on those below him, spreads favors withoutconsideration for harmony and fairness; officials will then, as a group, forgetabout loyalty and faithfulness and instead betray their superior. (TPJ 151.406)Merit and achievement must be the basis for distributing favors. The demand forfairness extends to heaven’s conduct of business, as described in passages fromor close to layer B. It is striking that even in regard to heaven, fairness isoccasionally expressed as a demand and not as an observation of what is actuallyhappening. As the Celestial Lord put it:The memorials that are submitted [must all be treated] in a balanced and fairmanner (ping jun 平均), without resentment and dispute. (TPJ 180.544, layer B)Moreover, heaven’s personnel must be remunerated according to their performance,that is, with “fairness” (TPJ 188.579, layer not clear). Heaven’s dealings withhumankind follow a similar logic:Now that heaven sends the spirits it has appointed [to distribute gifts] inharmony (tiao he 調禾口) and fairness (ping jun), let everyone get what he wantsand not take away what anybody is entitled to (an 安). (TPJ 200.616, layer B)We may conclude that jun points to general impartiality and moderation in theexecution of control and represents one aspect of the state of ping (peace,balance). In the following passage, then, jun is used as if it were a gloss ofping:“Peace” (ping) means that a reign is completely balanced (taiping jun) so thatall activities are kept in order (li 理), without further jealousy andselfishness. (TPJ 65.148)11. [chapter_21.xhtml#rch21fn11] For ju 倶 (all) I read qie 且. Jin qie 今且 is usedfrequently throughout the text to introduce a sentence.12. [chapter_21.xhtml#rch21fn12] “Inside matters” (nei shi 内事) is used in thesense of “vitality recipes” (fang shu 方術) in a Wei lue quotation in BeiSongzhi’s commentary to San guo zhi 19.365, a quotation that explains the earlycareer of a certain Han Pin 寒貧, who moved from the study of the Book of Odes andBook of Documents to a love for nei shi and, when he turned sixteen years ofage, began to read the Laozi and other nei shu 内 書. This remark shows a certaincontempt for nei shi, and in the Inner Chapters of the Baopu zi (chap. 15, “Zaying” 雜應, p. 68), it is in similarly critical fashion pointed out that there arebetter remedies. “Inside matters” have a certain touch of the esoteric: theybelong to one teacher and his school, as well as to this school’s friends. TheTPJ contains a passage in which inside matters are put on a par with dao; thisis reminiscent of the Laozi’s (48) proposition that while learning (which isinferior) grows, the doctrine (dao) becomes less. As the TPJ puts it:The learning of external [matters] (wai xue 外學) involves a lot, while learninginside [matters] (nei xue 内學) involves little. When external matters (wai shi外事) grow from day to day, inside matters (nei shi 内事) become less and less. (TPJp. 720, Chao, part 1)13. [chapter_21.xhtml#rch21fn13] The Master sees the world as moving in cycles(da zhou 大周; see TPJ 212.678), as Petersen (1990b: 27) has pointed out. Thiscyclical movement has two facets. At the end of one cycle, the danger ofextinction coexists with the chance for beginning a new and better regime (TPJ212.686). As the Master puts it:The great cycle that began with the way of heaven is at present complete. Thefuture depends on human beings and on Yang. Yang loves life and hates death. . .. Now at the start of another great cycle of heaven’s way, pure Yang reigns overheaven and earth from top to bottom, so we must quickly get rid of punishmentand crimes. (TPJ 212.676f.)When the disciples want to know why this is happening now, the Master explainsthat it is caused by the phase of fire becoming dominant (TPJ 212.678; seePetersen 1990b: 28).Kamitsuka (1999: 316–25) discusses the relationship between the concept of chengfu (see section 48) and a cyclical explanation for the occurrence and ending ofdisasters. She points out that both explanations coexisted in Han dynastydisaster analysis. The Celestial Master clearly takes more interest in the moralaspect of natural calamities than in the numerological configurations that wereproduced around them.14. [chapter_21.xhtml#rch21fn14] I change junzi 君子(gentleman) to zi 子(you). Theoccurrence of “small-minded man” in the preceding sentence has triggered thiserror. The small-minded man is here the opposite of “emperors and kings.”15. [chapter_21.xhtml#rch21fn15] This is an unusual ending in that the departureof the students does not involve any further admonitions, but the content ofthis passage does not differ from the rest. It argues that the writings revealedby heaven are destined for the “virtuous lord,” who will implement theirprohibitions among the populace at large. They are not meant to be distributeddirectly among the people. The summary says:This section is on peace, dao, and virtue; it attributes high and low rank; itexplains the feelings of foolish men.SECTION 63. OFFICIALS, SONS, AND DISCIPLES OF OUTSTANDING GOODNESS FIND WAYS FORTHEIR LORD, FATHER, AND MASTER TO BECOME TRANSCENDENT1. [chapter_22.xhtml#rch22fn1] See above, section 44.2. [chapter_22.xhtml#rch22fn2] See Baopu zi neipian 3 “Dui su” 對俗, p. 11.3. [chapter_22.xhtml#rch22fn3] The text reads guo jun chen 國君臣. The inclusion ofjun does not agree with the context and must be seen as the result ofnegligence. Jun chen frequently occurs as a pair.4. [chapter_22.xhtml#rch22fn4] According to the Lun yu (1.6) a young man shouldbe jin 謹 and xin 信 (attentive and faithful) or, in D. C. Lau’s (1979: 60)rendering, “sparing in speech but trustworthy in what he says.” They occurtogether in the TPJ only in this section. They are labels for the mainstreammoral values that the disciple believes in.5. [chapter_22.xhtml#rch22fn5] I read xin 信 (trust) as yan 言 (speech).6. [chapter_22.xhtml#rch22fn6] Here wrong conduct consists of fan fei li xie犯非歷邪. The four characters also occur in a passage on reckless, irresponsible,uncivilized men, who are said to see some merit in such conduct (TPJ 196.603,layer B).7. [chapter_22.xhtml#rch22fn7] The speaker of nuo 諾 (yes) is difficult todetermine. The dictionaries tell us that it is a sign of agreement mainly usedby someone superior in rank (as Zheng Xuan [127–200] comments in Li ji, “Qu li”典禮, shang, p. 1240a). Throughout layer A this is the Celestial Master, and inlayer B (see TPJ 198.612) it is the Celestial Lord. There are instances,however, when only the disciple can be the speaker (see, for instance, TPJ47.54). When we must assume it is the Celestial Master who is saying nuo, as inthe phrase at hand, it functions as an introductory particle, often followed bythe command to sit still and listen carefully (TPJ 55.83; 59.102; 61.114 and118).8. [chapter_22.xhtml#rch22fn8] This can be Yin, Yang, and their intercourse (seesection 61), heaven, earth, and men (TPJ 79.196), or heaven, earth, and thespace between them (TPJ 103.248). The communion of the three points to generalcosmic harmony; cf. Espesset 2002a.9. [chapter_22.xhtml#rch22fn9] The existence of life-prolonging anddeath-avoiding treatments and medications was a generally accepted fact of Handynasty life; see, for instance, Akahori 1989.10. [chapter_22.xhtml#rch22fn10] Here the Master tells us again that hismovement has lasted for a while, that it has not always been successful, andthat it has been conducted in different ways.11. [chapter_22.xhtml#rch22fn11] This is expressed by the three-characterexpression wang fu gui 往付歸.12. [chapter_22.xhtml#rch22fn12] “Qi of peace\" (ping qi) can be used as anotherterm for great peace (see above, section 42), but the term can also point to acertain potentiality. It often indicates an opportunity to achieve peace, anopportunity that men must utilize in order to finally achieve actual peace.Since ping qi stems from heaven, it has splendid characteristics. It is“highest” (TPJ 140.400), “honest” (liang; TPJ 46.52), “honest and good” (liangshan; TPJ 211.672), and “all-prevailing” (dong; TPJ p. 649, Chao, part 7).Besides the qi of peace sent by heaven there is earth’s “qi of peace,” and thecooperation of both produces a situation of “great peace.”13. [chapter_22.xhtml#rch22fn13] Which words are spoken by which speaker is notclear in this passage. The question raised is of some depth, taking up the issuediscussed by Mengzi and Xunzi of how we can explain that men know good from badunless we assume that they are born good. The answer given here is practical, orperhaps utilitarian: morality changes the world for the better, these changesare noticeable, and, for this reason, men like what is good. These changesresemble the course of nature, as pointed out in section 60. We like goodness inthe same way that we like spring and summer.14. [chapter_22.xhtml#rch22fn14] Good and bad are mutually exclusive, as aremanagement by virtue and by punishment.15. [chapter_22.xhtml#rch22fn15] I read xing 行(conduct) for shu 術(technique).16. [chapter_22.xhtml#rch22fn16] This passage is probably corrupt. Tentatively,I read ji xia 疾下 as jiji 疾疾. Yu (2001a: 117) understands xia as “with thepassage of time.”17. [chapter_22.xhtml#rch22fn17] For the expression chou ku fu mu 愁苦父母 (to causeparents grief), see TPJ 173.512.18. [chapter_22.xhtml#rch22fn18] Laozi 72 contrasts zi ai 自愛 (to look afterone’s own person) with zi gui 自貴 (to think highly of oneself). A Daoist does thefirst but never the second.19. [chapter_22.xhtml#rch22fn19] The expression “highest majesty” is hereattached to “early antiquity” with little regard for the context.20. [chapter_22.xhtml#rch22fn20] A “worthy” is a person who is qualified forpublic service. The phrasing of the passage suggests that not all teachers werequalified. This agrees with what we know of practices of fang shi (experts invitality techniques), and in particular of figures like Gan Ji, who was linkedto the origins of a scripture on great peace. Recommendation, in a formal—linkedto regional quotas—as well as in a less formal sense, was the way to officialappointment (cf. Hsu 1988: 184f.).Zi yang 自養, “nourishing one’s own self,” is another term for the nourishing ofthe vital principle (yang xing), which is the art that the disciples expect tolearn from the Celestial Master (see above section 47).21. [chapter_22.xhtml#rch22fn21] This passage touches on the fact that oneindividual can be both outstanding disciple and outstanding subject.22. [chapter_22.xhtml#rch22fn22] The term da ni 大逆 does not refer to a specificcrime but is used to categorize crimes. Its meaning is close to that of bu dao不道. The murder of father and mother, as well as acts against the reigning houseand its property, fall into this category (see Hulsewe 1955: 156–68). Thepunishment is severe:In case of da ni wu dao, great refractoriness and impiety, [the culprit] is cutin two at the waist; the father, mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters[of the culprit] are all, without distinction between old and young, publiclyexecuted. (Hulsewe 1955: 158; see Han shu 81.3355 and 49.2302)23. [chapter_22.xhtml#rch22fn23] Here the Master gives voice to a characteristicelement of layer A dialogue: the disciple expresses what the people at largethink (see sections 41 and 64; TPJ 103.241). By refuting the disciple the Mastercorrects what we might call public opinion.24. [chapter_22.xhtml#rch22fn24] The scenario depicted in the TPJ is not theMaster’s first attempt to start a missionary movement. The problem was—and wemay perhaps gather it still is—the disciples’ commitment.25. [chapter_22.xhtml#rch22fn25] The following dialogue is closely linked to thefirst. It points to the rewards that await someone whose conduct is “excellent,”as the Master understands the term.26. [chapter_22.xhtml#rch22fn26] With Yu (2001a: 120), I read zhi 直 (direct) forzhen 真 (true).27. [chapter_22.xhtml#rch22fn27] The situation in heaven is a replica of life onearth. Medicine and garments are plentiful for the spirits residing in heaven,but even in heaven distribution is linked to merit, in this case in thefulfillment of celestial duties; see TPJ 188.579, layer unclear. The TPJ authorsagree with hagiographic accounts of the way a transcendent lives. His appearancewas said to undergo changes (TPJ p. 221, Chao, part 4), and he was seen asriding through the clouds on a dragon (TPJ 108.289; p. 403, Chao, part 4;187.571, layer B). The text provides such different answers to the questions whyand how to become transcendent that these answers can help distinguish textuallayers. In the Celestial Master sections of the text (layer A) it is taken forgranted that men want to live long, just as they want to eat, drink, and love.The desire for longevity is used to set men on the right track, as a short Chaopassage puts it: “Since they are greedy for life, they won’t dare do wrong” (TPJp. 223, part 4, probably layer A). In section 50, men will become transcendent,that is, avoid death, when the reign of great peace has begun, and in the firsthalf of the section at hand men prove to be good by providing others with themeans to live long. As opposed to this, layer B material proposes that thesearch for longevity is man’s main interest and promises help. Layer B explainsthe function of the celestial “bureau for long life” (zhang shou zhi cao 長壽之曹TPJ 179.531, layer B) and provides insight into the functioning of the celestialbureaucracy (TPJ 188.579, layer not clear; 199.614, layer B).28. [chapter_22.xhtml#rch22fn28] Access to such rooms, and in particular tocounty postal relay stations (xian guan you ting 縣 官郵亭), was strictly regulated,not only here on earth but also, as we are told, in heaven and in thenetherworld. In heaven such places are destined for shen xian ren 神仙人,spiritlike transcendents; those on earth are for the worthy; and thosebelowground are where good spirits and good demons are expected to stay (TPJ p.698, Chao, part 8). There were similar rules for official rest houses (zhuan she傅舍). See TPJ 199.614, layer B; cf. Espesset 2002b: 13.29. [chapter_22.xhtml#rch22fn29] The system of official recommendation made itobligatory for officials to regularly recommend “the virtuous and the wise” (seeCh’ü 1972: 205) who were entitled to enjoy certain privileges.30. [chapter_22.xhtml#rch22fn30] I read ci 賜 (to give) for ci 此 (this).31. [chapter_22.xhtml#rch22fn31] Lian Shaoming (2002) refers to this passage ina discussion of the different spirits and the roles they play in the Qin dynastyYunmeng bamboo slips. He shows that there are parallels to a list of spirits setforth in TPJ section 107. In the passage at hand (referred to by an incorrectchapter number), he reads wu gu 無故 for wu zhuang 無狀, so we would have totranslate it as “and flog even innocent men.” My reading relies on the mentionof special wickedness in the previous and following passages.32. [chapter_22.xhtml#rch22fn32] With Yu (2001a: 120), I read tian 天 (heaven)for ren 人 (men).33. [chapter_22.xhtml#rch22fn33] Rou 柔 (weak, or perhaps conciliatory) isunderstood as ru 儒 (learned). The Laozi praises the dao-like quality of rou:“What is of all things most yielding can overwhelm that which is of all thingsmost hard” (Laozi 43), or “Truly, the hard and mighty are cast down; the softand weak set on high (Laozi 76, translations by Waley 1934). However, xian 賢 rouis a confusing combination of characters, and rou can stand for ru (educated),based on the two characters’ joint meaning of “weak” and their phoneticresemblance; see Shuo wen jie zi, p. 681b. Throughout the TPJ, when rou is addedto xian (TPJ p. 304, Chao, part 5; 160.451; 66.160), the two characters point toa person who has administrative skills, as does the character xian on its ownand as does the combination xian ru (TPJ 59.102; 62.128; 65.155; 66.162;100.230; 129.335 and passim throughout layer A).34. [chapter_22.xhtml#rch22fn34] With Yu (2001a: 121), I correct guo 過 (mistake)to yu 遇 (to happen).35. [chapter_22.xhtml#rch22fn35] While TPJ ideas about the preservation of lifehave many roots—Harada (1984: 72–76) points to the Laozi, the Yi jing, and Handynasty cosmological speculation set forth in the Hainan zi, for instance—thetext is also in itself an authority on the subject. It is self-evident for theCelestial Master and his adepts that a man’s thoughts and actions influence thequality of his qi, which then decides the length of his life; they do not needto discuss it. It is one of the Master’s basic doctrines and stated clearly andauthoritatively throughout the text, as demonstrated by Harada (1984).36. [chapter_22.xhtml#rch22fn36] Throughout the TPJ the rule of the ba, the“Hegemons,” is criticized, as it is in the Huainan zi (chap. 13 “Fan lun,” p.20b) and much of the earlier tradition. However, in the second century C.E. thepowerful and efficient political methods of certain Warring States Hegemons werereconsidered and newly appraised. Cui Shi (fl. 145–67) came to the conclusionthat at certain times the reign of a hegemon would be preferable to that of thetrue, virtuous king (Hsiao 1979: 535).37. [chapter_22.xhtml#rch22fn37] With Yu (2001a: 121), I correct gong 功 (merit)to qiao 巧 (clever).38. [chapter_22.xhtml#rch22fn38] Wang 往 (to go) is read as wang 王 (king).39. [chapter_22.xhtml#rch22fn39] For the expression quan shu 券書, see above,section 51.40. [chapter_22.xhtml#rch22fn40] In this section renjia 人家 and jiaren 家人 bothseem to mean “family.” Yu 2001a: 122 understands jiaren as “one of the family.”41. [chapter_22.xhtml#rch22fn41] See above, section 62.42. [chapter_22.xhtml#rch22fn42] With Yu (2001a: 122), I read zeng 增 (increase)as zeng 曾 in the meaning of nai 乃. In this passage, the Celestial Master makesit clear that to seek li 利, here in the sense of profit, for oneself is wrong.His warning against selfishness includes a critique of concentrating on thesearch for personal longevity to the detriment of one ‘s social obligations. Itis left open how such a critique is to be reconciled with the demand fornourishing one’s own vitality, a demand that is stressed in section 47 andthroughout the text, as, for example, in this section (on p. 136), when anexcellent student is said to understand the art of nourishing his own person.43. [chapter_22.xhtml#rch22fn43] The two missing characters are read as ruo ci若此 (like this).44. [chapter_22.xhtml#rch22fn44] This is the figure the astrologer Zhang Heng(ca. 100 C.E.) gives for the number of stars: Ling xian, p. 4a.45. [chapter_22.xhtml#rch22fn45] With Yu (2001a: 123), I read the final particleer 耳 as ju 具 (to write out).46. [chapter_22.xhtml#rch22fn46] The summary says:This section analyzes [the relationship] between lord and official, father andson, master and disciple. It makes known their good and bad conduct and portentsof success and failure.SECTION 64. HOW TO SUBDUE OTHERS BY MEANS OF DAO AND NOT BY MEANS OF SEVERITY1. [chapter_23.xhtml#rch23fn1] See Qian fu lun 15 “Ban lu” 班禄, p. 161–63; cf.Hsiao 1979: 538. Using quotations from the Xunzi and the Huainan zi, Peng Duo’sannotation supports the idea that this was a common perception.2. [chapter_23.xhtml#rch23fn2] The term used for “to overcome” is sheng fu 勝服,which does not seem to occur in the dictionaries. However, Schuessler (1987: 171and 539) gives evidence of the meaning “to overcome” in regard to external aswell as internal enemies for both characters.3. [chapter_23.xhtml#rch23fn3] This is nothing more than a new formulation oftime-honored political principles, contrasting “punitive action” with“aggressive war,” as does, for instance, Mengzi (1B8 and 2B8), when he evaluatesthe rebellions started by King Tang and King Wu or Qi’s attempt to overcome Yan(cf. Hsiao 1979: 271).4. [chapter_23.xhtml#rch23fn4] According to san zheng 三正 (three-orders)speculation, heaven’s year begins with zi, the first earthly branch; the year ofthe earth with chou, the second branch; and man’s year with yin, the thirdbranch (Han shu 21A “Lü li zhi,” p. 962). This difference was supposedlyreflected in calendrical arrangements, as the Zhou dynasty’s year was said tohave started in the eleventh month, the Shang dynasty year in the twelfth month,and the Xia year in the first month. In 104 B.C.E., calendrical reforms alignedthe Han dynasty calendar with what was supposed to have been the Xia dynastyarrangement (see Kalinowski 1991: 538). The Celestial Master refers to thesewell-known ideas to give a certain precision to his own account of historicalchange.5. [chapter_23.xhtml#rch23fn5] The expression jin tui 進退 (advance and retreat)occurs four times in this short section. It is the word for the changes betweenthe four seasons (TPJ 59.101) and for movement and change in general (TPJ109.294; 58.94). Knowledge of this movement is essential; the Master puts itthus:You want to understand [the meaning of] “complete pervasion”—[but] do you knowhow spirits and other numinous beings advance and retreat? (TPJ 107.281)When the disciples don’t know the answer, they are told about the nine ways ofcontemplation, in proper order, through which to approach dao. We must assumethat such contemplation is directed toward the coming and going of spirits andtheir effects (cf. also TPJ 203.626, layer B, and p. 722, Chao, part 1).In this passage, the Celestial Master stresses that advance and retreat must bekept constant, particularly where Yin and Yang are concerned (this is alsoexpressed in TPJ p. 213, Chao, part 4). Given the conclusion drawn here from thelack of constancy, it must also be considered that in the Yi jing, advance andretreat are the movements that a change from broken to unbroken lines and viceversa represents (Yi jing, “Xi ci” A, p. 39.2). Orderly exit and entry (chu ru出入) of lines signify smooth change (Yi jing, “Xi ci” B, p. 48.7), which leavesno room for differing explanations, or for what the Celestial Master would calldisorder and deceit.The determinative force of cyclic movement plays a strong role in thisparticular section of the TPJ, as pointed out toward the end: the qi of greatpeace will definitely arrive, for cyclical reasons. Master, disciples, and theproper doctrine can only help the government of the day to make the best use ofit.6. [chapter_23.xhtml#rch23fn6] The expression qu ren (to keep men in check) mustbe understood in the sense of qu tianxia in Laozi 48. The Lun heng chapter “OnThunder and Lightning” attests to the belief in the punishing effect of thunder.7. [chapter_23.xhtml#rch23fn7] The Duke of Thunder (lei gong 雷公) was awell-known deity. The Huainan zi (chap. 2 “Chu zhen” 叔真, p. 12a) says that theperfected “employs wind and rain and makes the Duke of Thunder his official.”The TPJ explains that a person who is one with dao communicates with spirits andrises up to the clouds to ride on a dragon and share the abode of the Duke ofThunder (TPJ p. 306, Chao, part 5). Lun heng 23 “Lei xu” 雷虛, p. 303 describeshow artists depicted the Duke of Thunder, with a drum in his left hand and ahammer in his right hand. Hayashi (1989: 162–66) introduces several wallpaintings showing him on a wagon drawn by his helpers or by dragons andsurrounded by many smaller figures with metal tools. He often appears togetherwith the Lord of the Winds, Feng bo 風伯.8. [chapter_23.xhtml#rch23fn8] With Yu (2001a: 125), an 安 is corrected to chang常. An (pacification) is rarely, if ever, used in a negative sense.9. [chapter_23.xhtml#rch23fn9] Zhi 知 (to know) is corrected to he 知 (to agree);see Yu 2001a: 125.10. [chapter_23.xhtml#rch23fn10] This passage states that the TPJ’s demand for“pervasion” is driven by moral considerations, and in particular by the idea ofa cohesive, comprehensive society in which happiness is general. The doctrineand its effects (dao and de; TPJ 66.160; 155.436), as well as the Master’s book(TPJ 61.124), must certainly “pervade,” that is, they must be distributed.11. [chapter_23.xhtml#rch23fn11] The phrase tian fei ren 天非人 is also used in TPJ152.417 with the same meaning.12. [chapter_23.xhtml#rch23fn12] The summary says:This section analyze and distinguishes [ways] of subduing [others], and whydemons and spirits of heaven, earth and men are mischievous and why they supportgovernment.SECTION 65. THREEFOLD COOPERATION AND INTERACTION1. [chapter_24.xhtml#rch24fn1] TPJ 177.518f.2. [chapter_24.xhtml#rch24fn2] The meaning of shang huang taiping qi does notdiffer from that of taiping qi, which abounds in the text. The belief in itsimminent arrival is the central point of the Master’s missionary program. Thequestion at hand is also raised elsewhere:The writings often say that heaven’s highest majestic qi (shang huang qi) isabout to descend. Now I don’t know what “highest majestic qi” means. (TPJ102.234)In response, the Master gives a longish list of the constituents of the ThreeMajesties of heaven (the sun, moon, and constellations), of earth (the fivepeaks, the plains, and the valleys) and of humankind (sovereign, official, andthe people). Only toward the end of the section and when reminded by questionsdoes he return to the topic and explain that the ancients were well informedabout the chances for the arrival of “highest majestic qi”:The ancients undertook the following divination in regard to their government:they analyzed the solidity of their virtue (de), investigated what their qiresponded to, and thus knew exactly, as clearly as the sun and the moon, theirreign’s gains and losses, weak and strong points.Very good, but how can one avoid losses?Yes, you are already familiar with celestial scriptures, so you must bring to anend the calamities that the ten thousand beings inherit and transmit.But how can this be done? If the Celestial Master would only advise the worthieson how to achieve highest majestic qi! (TPJ 102.238)The arrival of such qi signifies the success of the reform program. Should asociety still lack perfection, the arriving qi would be less satisfactory,promoting, for instance, three- fourths of peace rather than the whole lot (TPJ102.238).Huang is used throughout the text in connection with personages, powers, andactions that originate from heaven and thus possess the highest possibleauthority. The word is therefore occasionally linked with taiping, which ismainly referred to as taiping qi, “qi of taiping,” but occasionally as tianshang huang taiping qi (TPJ 50.68) or as shang huang taiping qi, as in thepassage at hand. It follows that huang (majestic) does not appear in connectionwith yuan qi 元氣 (the primordial qi), which is not seen as originating fromheaven, but rather as representing an independent ontological entity.3. [chapter_24.xhtml#rch24fn3] The “majestic numinous” (huang ling 皇靈) isanother word for heaven. The disciple raises questions on its behalf (TPJ127.312; 129.332), as he does on behalf of tian; cf. also TPJ 163.456. The Hanyuda cidian (vol. 8, p. 266) quotes Cao Zhi 曹植 (192–232) to document that the twocharacters mean “emperor of heaven.”4. [chapter_24.xhtml#rch24fn4] The expression “distinct” (chacha 察察) is used inLaozi 20 for the mind of the people in contrast to the mind of “I,” and in Laozi58 for a government that encourages people to use stratagems. The positivemeaning it conveys in this passage can be found in Xunzi 8.4.3, for instance,where it means “careful investigation” in Knoblock’s (1988: 186) rendering.Throughout the TPJ, it means “clear” in the sense that the Master makes thingsclear (TPJ 99.225; 110.295), or that the sun, moon, and stars shine brightly(TPJ p. 648, Chao, part 7). It is of interest that here the Laozi’sunderstanding of chacha seems to be of no impact.5. [chapter_24.xhtml#rch24fn5] The Celestial Master attempts to analyze languageas a scholar would. As the Chun qiu fan lu says:Names and appellations obtain their correctness from heaven and earth, whichgive them their meaning. . . . What is spoken loudly in imitation of heaven andearth is an appellation, and what is cried by way of commanding is a name. Namesand appellations, though they all sound different, have one common root. Theyare all uttered to convey what heaven wants. Heaven does not speak; it lets menput forth what it wants. It does not act; it lets men do what it intends. (Chap.35 “Shen cha ming hao” 深察名號, p. 285; cf. Bodde’s translation in Fung 1952/53,vol. 2, pp. 85f.)6. [chapter_24.xhtml#rch24fn6] The explanation of wang (king) and jun (ruler) inChun qiu fan lu (35.289) is less analytical, but it shares with the CelestialMaster’s approach an interest in pronunciation and, in particular, rhyme. See,for instance, the five aspects (ke 科) of the character wang 王, which are said tobe huang 皇 (majestic), fang 方(square), kuang 匡 (square and full), huang黃(yellow), and wang 往 (to go toward). The fact that “to go toward” was a commonexplanation of wang, from the Gu liang zhuan to apocryphal scriptures (see Tjan1949/52, vol. 1, p. 300, note 187, and Bai hu tong 2 “Hao” 號, p. 45), shows thatthe Celestial Master’s approach to concepts is rather mainstream.7. [chapter_24.xhtml#rch24fn7] The character huang 爐 (brilliant) is pronouncedlike huang (majestic). Huang huang, in Tjan Tjoe Som’s translation (1949/1952,vol. 1, pp. 296f., note 178) “resplendent,” occurs frequently to explain“majestic,” as for instance Bai hu tong 2 “Hao,” p. 45: “He was called majestic,shedding forth a brilliance that none could escape” (cf. Tjan 1949/1952, vol. 1,p. 230).8. [chapter_24.xhtml#rch24fn8] The Bai hu tong’s way of explaining “majestic” ismore straightforward:What is the meaning of huang? It is also an appellation. It means jun君 (lord),mei 美 (beautiful), and da 大 (great). (Bai hu tong 2 “Hao” 號, p. 44)9. [chapter_24.xhtml#rch24fn9] This translation follows Luo (1996: 260). Thecharacter zi 子 is here used in a nominalizing function; wuzi 物子 means “harvest.”10. [chapter_24.xhtml#rch24fn10] This cosmogonic sequence is complex. Also, theproposition that there were three before the beginning of creation is remarkableagainst a background of dualistic Yin/Yang–, male/female–based cosmogonicimages. For the power the TPJ assigns to a threefold approach, see Espesset2002a, part 3. The passage at hand argues carefully. It pays more attention towhat we might call reality than to empty formalism. The three luminaries—anothertrinity—are introduced as if they were a second entity beyond or above all otherthings and beings that were created by heaven, earth, and their intercourse.Also, in a nonformalistic manner, the origin of the family is laid out in plainterms as a man and woman getting together and bringing forth children. Only thendoes the argument move back to the “cooperation of the three,” that is, to thethree who make up the family.11. [chapter_24.xhtml#rch24fn11] “Hard and soft” are juxtaposed in Laozi 78.Here they mean “quality.” It was generally believed that “quality” was an effectof five phases activity.12. [chapter_24.xhtml#rch24fn12] All of these factors influence harvest results.In this passage, the term zhonghe is the word for the active, involved presenceof cosmological entities, as opposed to their being just as they are. I have notfound the term wuli anywhere else, not even in the TPJ.13. [chapter_24.xhtml#rch24fn13] The expression sheng he 生和 (not mentioned inthe dictionaries) is poorly translated by “in agreement.” It recurs later on inthis passage: “When three are in agreement . . .” It points to the physical,concrete outcome that is derived from an agreement between beings or objects.14. [chapter_24.xhtml#rch24fn14] This is perhaps as abstract as the TPJ gets.Three triggers the process of becoming, which is termed “dao.” This positiondeserves some attention within the narrow spectrum of Chinese ontologicalspeculation. Elsewhere in the text dao is one of the entities involved in thecosmogonic process, as are primordial qi, what is as it is, the intercoursebetween Yin and Yang, and heaven and earth; see also p. 85 above.15. [chapter_24.xhtml#rch24fn15] Shi 事 (activity) is corrected to shi 使 (tocause), as in the phrase “Should one not suffice all three would remainincomplete” on p. 150. The mistake is caused by the occurrence of yi shi 一事 inthe previous sentence.16. [chapter_24.xhtml#rch24fn16] For “to rest secure forever” (chang an 長安), seeabove, section 50.17. [chapter_24.xhtml#rch24fn17] Section 60 repeats the proposition thatscarcity of people makes a country poor. The opposite claim, which is put forthin the Han Feizi (chap. 49 “Wu du” 五蠹, p. 856.2: “In the past . . . people werefew and goods many. So men never quarreled”), for instance, does not seem tooccur in the Celestial Master’s arguments.18. [chapter_24.xhtml#rch24fn18] The four outlying regions are mentionedthroughout the text, for instance, as an abbreviation of “the countries of thefour outlying regions” (TPJ 134.368). They are situated in all eight directions(TPJ p. 729, Chao, part 1).19. [chapter_24.xhtml#rch24fn19] “Heaven’s model” here refers to cooperating inthrees.20. [chapter_24.xhtml#rch24fn20] The term “celestial document” or “celestialcontract” (tian quan 天券) occurs only in this section, altogether three times(see pp. 317 and 319), and in part 9 of the Chao (p. 712), where it seems tofigure as another word for “writings” and where the Master talks about therelationship between heaven and men as if they had a contract consisting of alist of a man’s deeds agreed on by both parties. Zhen quan (the true contract)is used in this sense in section 51. The section at hand deals with the propersupervision of subordinates. The introduction of a celestial contract enhancesthe role of heaven as a source of authority for political leaders. The contractreferred to here resembles a form of agreement that was common between sovereignand official (see Xunzi 44.12.7 and 13), as discussed by Lewis (1999: 30 andnote 49, p. 374). Such documents were produced annually to oblige thesubordinate to achieve certain mutually agreed upon performance goals. Contractswere also used in the ritual of “rending of the tally” (fen quan 分券) that wasmeant to bind a disciple to his master (Benn 2000: 318, 330).21. [chapter_24.xhtml#rch24fn21] See above, section 55.22. [chapter_24.xhtml#rch24fn22] “Threefold writings” (san dao xing shu 三道々亍書)are said to be texts of the highest quality because they help to detectmalpractice. In their comprehensiveness and investigative clarity they are saidto resemble the three luminaries:Only a man who resembles heaven can, by understanding its will, grow old andlive a long life. Someone who resembles earth and understands its intentionsdoes not live quite so long. To resemble men means to enjoy hardly any longevitybut to die as the ten thousand beings all do, not at the [proper] time andwithout the [right] cipher. What resembles heaven is the threefold texts (sandao tong wen 三道通文). Heaven has three patterns (wen 文), whose clarity is that ofthe three sources of light, namely the sun, the moon, and the stars. The sunscrutinizes Yang [that is, what is in the light], the moon Yin [lying in theshade], and the stars what lies in between. That is why threefold writingsundertake to provide explanations. Writings that reach the authorities must giveonly the name of the author; there is no need to ask who submits them. Writingsthat resemble earth are twofold, and those that resemble man go only in one way,which is blocked, moreover. What resemble the ten thousand animals are wordsarranged on the spur of the moment; they are not set in writing. (TPJ 79.198;see Long 2000: 311)Hachiya (1983) points to the origin of xing shu when he explains them as “textscirculating [among the people]” (see TPJ 68.171). They come from the grassroots.They were collected by petty officials and the people (TPJ 132.360) and consistof reports submitted by local officials, townspeople, and travelers on all theunusual occurrences they have observed in towns and marketplaces, on the roads,and in the countryside (TPJ 167.467; cf. also 127.328). The “three ways” of thetext’s title might actually refer to these three groups of men if “threefoldwritings” were not also the means by which wrongdoings are reported (ji guo 記過)in heaven and by spirits (TPJ 211.673). It was clearly faults and trespassesthat were reported (TPJ 152.420), as Max Kaltenmark (1979: 26) has observed: hesees the “san dao” as referring to heaven, earth, and men. This understandinglinks the procedures described here to the san guan shou shu 三官手書 with whichadherents of Celestial Master Daoism addressed the netherworld’s justicedepartment to be spared intrusions from mischievous demons (Cedzich 1987: 54).These memorials dealt with trespasses, in particular those committed by a newlydeceased person, but also those who might have caused his death. They wereaddressed and physically conveyed to heaven, earth, and water. They were meantto be a vehicle of redemption for the deceased but also, more importantly, forthe living. So, too, are the San dao xing shu, but for society as a whole ratherthan for a particular family or group of people. The perusal and distribution ofthese texts—and this, we must add, means the implementation of what they say—isin the Celestial Master’s view bound to go along with great peace (TPJ 127.319;132.362; 136.381; 152.420). They belong to the Master’s own texts as indicatedby the expression tian shi san dao xing shu 天師三道行書(The Celestial Master’sthreefold writings) (TPJ 127.312; 317).23. [chapter_24.xhtml#rch24fn23] This translation is tentative. The passagedeals with the frequently discussed topic (see above, section 43, and thepassage from section 79 just quoted) of the need to maintain a flow ofinformation from the grassroots to higher levels, while guaranteeing the safetyof the informant.24. [chapter_24.xhtml#rch24fn24] The two missing characters are read as “zhi.Jin” 之.今.25. [chapter_24.xhtml#rch24fn25] As Qing Xitai (1979) points out, during thelast period of the Han Dynasty there was a lot of criticism of the way in whichofficials were chosen and promoted. While much of this criticism came from theerudites and from certain families whose members were traditionally employed asofficials, the argument was widespread. Xiang Kai, who propagated a taiping textat Emperor Huan’s court, belonged to the group, or “party,” who calledthemselves “clean,” as opposed to empresses’ relatives and eunuchs who hadsupposedly assumed political power in a corrupt fashion.26. [chapter_24.xhtml#rch24fn26] The people’s will represents heaven’s will;see, for instance, TPJ 132.354. The Master makes use of “the people” as it suitshis argument. Their “heart” is reliable, or so it seems, but their judgment isnot.27. [chapter_24.xhtml#rch24fn27] Long (2000: 312) corrects fang 效 to xiao 效.28. [chapter_24.xhtml#rch24fn28] With Yu (2001a: 132), I read ling 令 for jin 今.29. [chapter_24.xhtml#rch24fn29] Yu (2001a: 132) points out that the meaning ofthe character for ba 八 (eight) is seen as “to divide” (see Shuo wen jie zi, p.109b). According to Gui Fu’s (1736–1805) notes on ba 掘, this character wasoriginally written with the character for “eight” (Shuo wen jie zi, p. 337a).30. [chapter_24.xhtml#rch24fn30] The phonetic element of jiu 究 (to inspect) isjiu 九 (nine).31. [chapter_24.xhtml#rch24fn31] The character hai 亥 is the phonetic element ofhe 核 (seed). Rao Zongyi (1972) points out that the Celestial Master speculatesabout the character hai from a pictographic (cf. also section 53, note 13,above) as well as a phonetic perspective, and that both approaches haveparallels in earlier and contemporary writings (see Shuo wen jie zi, p. 1312a,and Huangdi neijing suwen 70 “Wu chang zheng da lun” 五常政大論, p. 20b). In thepassage at hand phonetic considerations also prevail in the following sentencethat links shi 十 (ten) with shi 實 (fruit) (cf. Petersen 1990c: 140). Soundglosses were quite popular among second-century C.E. scholars (see Bodman 1954).32. [chapter_24.xhtml#rch24fn32] This passage leads back to the originalquestion of proper government and the need to address issues in autumn andwinter. As the yields are investigated during the harvest season, so too shouldthe performance of officials, “the amount of good and bad,” be evaluated. Theterms used for this latter process are identical to those applied to thegathering and distribution of the harvest.The gist of the argument is that cooperation between the leadership, theadministration, and the people is based on regular and public performancerecords, and that such records are to be kept mainly at the lower end of theadministrative hierarchy, which will thus inspire self-control.33. [chapter_24.xhtml#rch24fn33] With Long (2000: 312), I read yao 繇 as yao 遥(distant).34. [chapter_24.xhtml#rch24fn34] For shan 善 (good) as a Daoist rank, see section41.35. [chapter_24.xhtml#rch24fn35] This passage gives voice to one of theCelestial Master’s most original propositions: the moral force of thesubordinate equals that of his superior, and influence travels both ways.Although this is the conclusion one can draw from the social reforms envisagedthroughout the TPJ, it is here stated with unusual theoretical rigidity. It ismatched by the idea that heaven does as men should do, that is, it shuns peoplewho don’t have children, for instance (see TPJ 208.658f.).36. [chapter_24.xhtml#rch24fn36] This passage makes tian (heaven) look unusuallyomniscient and powerful. The course of nature is its tool, as are the wordsuttered by men. That the spoken word is integrated in the system of correlationsis merely a logical conclusion, hardly thematized, as opposed to the frequencywith which texts are mentioned.37. [chapter_24.xhtml#rch24fn37] This is expressed by tian di shi li 天地事立, whichis probably erroneous for tian di li shi 立事, as in line 9 of this page and whichalso occurs TPJ 79, p. 200.38. [chapter_24.xhtml#rch24fn38] Three characters are here in the position of averbal predicate: fen bie jie 分別解.39. [chapter_24.xhtml#rch24fn39] With Yu (2001a: 134), I correct tian wen 天文 toda wen 大文. Given the Master’s interest in collecting texts, this statement isproblematic, but it is repeated elsewhere—see TPJ 136.382; 139.393;157.445—using the term da wen. These passages warn against the writing of newtexts, not against collating material already in existence, and these new textsare the TPJ, or a text similar to the received TPJ, rather than reports aboutnatural calamities and other celestial warnings.40. [chapter_24.xhtml#rch24fn40] The summary says:This section deals with embracing primordial qi and what is as it is; [with thefact that] three must join forces and be of the same mind in all matters, inheaven and on earth; and with heaven’s bright contract and the reign of majesticpeace.SECTION 66. ON THE NEED TO STUDY WHAT IS TRUE1. [chapter_25.xhtml#rch25fn1] As in Liezi 4 “Zhong ni” 仲尼, p. 121, and as belowin this section (p. 337), zhi in wu ke zhi 無可治 means not “to order,” but tediousand oppressive control (see also Shi ji 87.2561, in the biography of Li Si).Elsewhere in the TPJ, wu ke zhi means that government can’t take place, as isthe case without people; see TPJ 65.151.2. [chapter_25.xhtml#rch25fn2] Benevolence (ren) is stressed throughout thissection, as it is elsewhere (TPJ 41.32) when a program of moral reform iscontrasted with the application of a penal code.3. [chapter_25.xhtml#rch25fn3] “Limitless\" (wuji 無極) is here used as in Laozi28.4. [chapter_25.xhtml#rch25fn4] With Yu (2001a: 135), I correct de (virtue) to de(to obtain).5. [chapter_25.xhtml#rch25fn5] The character dong in juedong 絕洞 (most), as abovein juedong wu shang 絕洞無上 (unsurpassed by anybody), is here mistakenly written asdiao 调(exhausted).6. [chapter_25.xhtml#rch25fn6] “True gate\" (zhen men 真門) does not seem to befound elsewhere in the TPJ or other Daoist material. It probably means theorigin of everything, similar to the miao zhi men 妙之門 of Laozi 1, which alsooccurs TPJ 168.472, layer C. “Gate” is used in a similar way in the Huainan zi I“Yuan dao” 原道, p. 14a.7. [chapter_25.xhtml#rch25fn7] This passage shows the limitation of the text’sethical thinking. Morality is to be learned for a purpose, that is, to guaranteewell-being and long life. It is not a need in itself. Because morality is theresult of learning, moral depravity, its opposite, can be identified withstupidity, which is in the first instance evident from not choosing the rightteacher.8. [chapter_25.xhtml#rch25fn8] The wording of this passage is doubtful. Iunderstand san fa 三法 (three models) in the sense in which it is used in JiaGongyan’s 賈公彥 (seventh-century) commentary to the Zhou li (“Qiu guan, si ci”秋官司剌, p. 880c) to describe methods of government used in the past, which did notalienate the population. Elsewhere in the TPJ, the term is used similarly totian fa (heaven’s model), in the sense of “the models of heaven and earth, Yinand Yang, and of their intercourse” (TPJ p. 695, Chao, part 8). Yu (2001a: 137)argues that “three” stands here, as in so many other cases, for heaven, earth,and man. The problem with this is that fa used in this sense is never said toproclaim or implement punishment, as suggested in the passage at hand.The word shi 士 (scholar) is used here and throughout the text as broadly as inother Han dynasty material (see Ch’ü 1972: 101) and refers to all men who wereliterate and played a role as teachers, students, and advisors to localmagnates, and also played a role in official service.9. [chapter_25.xhtml#rch25fn9] This refers to Laozi 41, which in Waley’s (1934:193) translation reads: “When the man of highest capacities (shang shi 上士) hearsTao he does his best to put it into practice. When the man of middling capacity(zhong shi 中士) hears Tao he is in two minds about it. When the man of lowcapacity (xia shi 下士) hears Tao he laughs loudly at it. If he did not laugh, itwould not be worth the name of Tao.”10. [chapter_25.xhtml#rch25fn10] Yi (through) is here and frequently in thissection read as yi (already), with Yu (2001a: 138).11. [chapter_25.xhtml#rch25fn11] With Yu (2001a: 138), I read er as neng, andthroughout the passage I understand qin 勤 (diligent) as jin 僅 (barely).12. [chapter_25.xhtml#rch25fn12] There is a strong psychological elementthroughout this passage. Here the text’s utopian quality is explained as beingcaused by the gap between aim and achievement in the average person. TheCelestial Master argues that his doctrine takes this into consideration byraising behavioral norms to the highest possible level.13. [chapter_25.xhtml#rch25fn13] The expression tian zheng wen fa, which is usedonly here, combines heaven’s “standard patterns” (TPJ 48.58) and “standardmodels” (TPJ 132.359).14. [chapter_25.xhtml#rch25fn14] Yu (2001a: 139) suggests that the passage iscorrupt. He suggests the addition of cai de zhong shan 繞得中善: “Only through adiligent study of the true doctrine will someone learn to be of averagegoodness.” As the text stands, much stress is laid on the final particle er 耳.15. [chapter_25.xhtml#rch25fn15] Shan dao 善道 is occasionally used as if it wereanother term for zhen dao 真道: “Preserve the valuable teachings and you cut offthe road to disaster” (TPJ 134.374). What is shan (good), however, is worth lessthan what is zhen, as can be seen from the modifications of shan: the truecannot exist in high, medium, and lower forms, as can the good.16. [chapter_25.xhtml#rch25fn16] The two missing characters are read as zhi yi之矣.17. [chapter_25.xhtml#rch25fn17] “Without measure\" (wu shu) is here and in thefollowing intensified to wu fu shu 無復數, an expression that is characteristic ofthis section.18. [chapter_25.xhtml#rch25fn18] For “ignore the model” (shi fa 失法) as used inthis section, cf. the expression shi fa du in section 58.19. [chapter_25.xhtml#rch25fn19] “The people of heaven” are taiping adherents;see above, section 61.20. [chapter_25.xhtml#rch25fn20] Forced labor was one of the punishments metedout in the world below.21. [chapter_25.xhtml#rch25fn21] Xue (study) is the general remedy:Well, if this is the fate heaven has destined for you, you will leave the worldfar behind once you take up the study [of dao]. When a person of medium worthstudies it, he can live a very long time, and when a foolish person does so, hecan still live a long time. If you want to see some proof of this, take the wayin which people in general study. Through study a person of great worth canbecome a high official, a person of medium worth can become an official ofmedium rank, and a foolish person can become a petty official who, compared tothe masses, is a figure of some impact. This means that one must study hard.(TPJ 108.289)22. [chapter_25.xhtml#rch25fn22] Zhang duan 長短 (the long and the short) was aWarring States political and rhetorical skill: see Tian Dan’s biography in theShi ji (94.2649, in Sima Qian’s evaluation) and the Wen xin diao long 18 “Lunshuo,” p. 27a.23. [chapter_25.xhtml#rch25fn23] The expression shu shu 數書 is understood asreferring to the books listed in the shu shu 數術 division of the bibliographicalchapter of the Han shu. These books deal with the theory and practice ofdivination (cf. Kalinoswki 2003:11). In disparaging this material the CelestialMaster attacks an important element of Han dynasty scholarship.24. [chapter_25.xhtml#rch25fn24] Throughout the text it becomes clear that theCelestial Master does not think highly of rituals; cf. Harper’s (2004: 264f.)discussion and his translation of TPJ 201.620, layer B. But this does not meanthat the culprit must give up all hope of redemption. The following passagebelongs to a section full of polemics against certain “heterodox,” and perhapsBuddhist, practices:Someone about to be exterminated by heaven might still say, full of confidence,that he will live a long time. Once heaven is in the process of killing him hemight cry to heaven and wail to earth and call himself maltreated (yuan 冤). Hestill won’t understand what he did wrong. Then heaven will interrogate him andbanish him. He will be put somewhere unpleasant and wild, to make him think ofhimself. If you want to understand how this works, this is just as when anenlightened ruler examines a person’s crime but does not have him killed.Depending on the size of his crime, he is being sentenced, more severely for abig crime, and less so for a petty crime. This should make him submissive. If hedies knowing himself, he will be without hatred and not say a word. If he doesnot give up talking but calls himself maltreated, he will die full of hate, justas the subjects of the Five Hegemons died with great hatred in their hearts.(TPJ 208.663; cf. Masaaki 2002: 47)This passage leaves unclear whether the culprit’s address to heaven is actuallyof much use to him. The view expressed in layer B is more clear-cut andpractical:What people nowadays do is foolish and shallow. When they become ill and are onthe brink of death they don’t turn to heaven to acknowledge their mistakes andbow to it. All the members of a family must help each other to seek forgiveness.After a number of days, heaven might pardon [the culprit] and let him recoverand live for a while. Should he trespass again, it would be of no avail to bowto heaven. (TPJ 201.621; cf. Masaaki 2002: 46; Espesset 2002b: 42f.)Timing is an important aspect of redemption. Confession, regret, and reform mustcome at the right time, as the passage at hand stresses.25. [chapter_25.xhtml#rch25fn25] The section contrasts governmental control withspiritual self-discipline. The gist is that proper education makes governmentvirtually superfluous. In its detail, the argument does not follow quietistprinciples, as, for instance, expressed in the Laozi, but rather moralphilosophers like Xunzi, who contrasts virtuous and thus responsible conductwith behavior that needs to be restrained by penalties.26. [chapter_25.xhtml#rch25fn26] This is another example of heaven’s almostdivine way of action. It extends active support when it sees and esteems a humanbeing’s serious effort; see also TPJ 63.134, where it is proposed that the son,exhausted by his efforts on behalf of his parents’ longevity, will get celestialsupport.27. [chapter_25.xhtml#rch25fn27] The two missing characters are read as you shou有收.28. [chapter_25.xhtml#rch25fn28] With Yu (2001a: 142), I read wan 萬 (tenthousand) for mo 莫 (none).29. [chapter_25.xhtml#rch25fn29] The sage King Wen is said to have shown aninterest in this question. The Da Dai Li ji (chap. 10 “Wen wang guan ren” 文王官人,pp. 169-72) contains a section on the criteria he thought appropriate forchoosing officials.30. [chapter_25.xhtml#rch25fn30] The sixth-century Wu xing dayi 3.54 discussesthe problem that, during the Han, the heart was identified with fire by some—forexample, the Shuo wen jie zi author Xu Shen (ca. 55–ca.149)—and with earth byZheng Xuan (127-200) and others (see Kali- nowski 1991: 287 and 520f). Thetradition of the Monthly Ordinances (see, for instance, Huainan zi 5 “Shi ze”時貝, p. 8a) associates the heart with earth. As the leading body organ, the hearthad to belong to the phase that was seen as leading, as earth was until theoutgoing first century B.C.E. In contrast to this, the TPJ coherently identifiesheart with fire: see TPJ 212.678 and:Heart is the most spiritlike and most honored of the bodily organs. It isspiritlike, wise, and pure and is Yang. [It belongs to] the phase of fire. Fireis what moves upward and shines like heaven. Thus the sun reigns through fireand creates heaven’s standard (zheng 正) so that everything becomes clear. (TPJ153.426)31. [chapter_25.xhtml#rch25fn31] The summary says:This section enlightens the heart of the worthy again in order to do away withfoolish and dumb writings. If you are in doubt, use it for instructionAPPENDIX: THE COMPOSITION OF THE TPJ1. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn1] Cf. Robinet 1984, Strickmann 1981, and Bokenkamp(1997: 278-81).2. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn2] See TPJ pp. 1-8, Chao.3. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn3] See Ōfuchi 1941: 14f. and cf. Mansvelt Beck 1980:170f.4. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn4] See Yoshioka 1970: 104, whose proposal has beeninfluential and was again upheld by Yamada Toshiaki in 1993 (reprinted in Yamada1999). Maeda queried it in 1994, and in a further round these queries were takenup by Ōfuchi (1997:533-39), who questions the attribution of such a dominantrole to the rather spurious Dongji zhi jing, insisting on one identical oldtaiping text as the major source for the received text. Although Ōfuchi arguesthat Yoshioka’s description of the text’s reedition is tantamount to anadmission that the editors faked the old text, this was not what Yoshioka meant.His effort to involve Zhang Daoling, who from all we know was active in Sichuan,in the transmission of a text that has been closely linked to the Langye regionin China’s east does indeed seem far-fetched and difficult to sustain. But toargue that the material assembled in the received text stemmed entirely from onesingle line of transmission is also problematic.5. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn5] The character shi (ten) is perhaps erroneous, basedon a misreading of the sign (or “ditto” mark) for repeating “four,” so that thenumber of juan would be 144.6. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn6] In the first year of han ‘an, during the reign ofEmperor Shun (r. 125-44); see Yunji qiqian 6.15b–16a; cf. Daojiaoyishu 2.7b–14a;according to Yoshioka (1970: 67), the passage is based on the Xuanmen dayi.7. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn7] See Laojun shuoyibai bashi jie, as in Yunji qiqian39:1a–b. The date of the Preface to the 180 Precepts is not clear. Yoshioka(1970: 70) argues for the middle of the sixth century, but it could be earlier(cf. Hendrischke and Penny 1996:17). The way it is used in the process ofpromoting the newly edited TPJ could, in itself, provide an argument for anearlier date.8. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn8] See TPJ 188.576 (probably layer A): “Formerly theScripture on Complete Pervasion with the title ‘Great Peace’ was bestowed” cf.also TPJ 41.87, “Thus it was called ‘government of all-pervading heaven,’” and129.331; 132.361; 136.378, all layer A.9. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn9] This last observation regarding the Dongji zhi jingis not included in the Daojiaoyishu (2.9b) version of the passage, which seemsto slightly reduce the reliability of what is said.10. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn10] The Zhengyijing argued that all four of the laterDaoist canon’s “support” sections had been given to Zhang Daoling in the firstinstance; see Ōfuchi (1997: 533O, who has a point when he argues that what theZhengyijing seems to say is not backed up by any other evidence; compare, forinstance, Wushang biyao 84.10b on Zhang Daoling’s reception of the Zhengyimengwei.11. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn11] See Yamada 1999:136-39.12. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn12] In some cases one summary covers several sections(TPJ p. 402 for sections 140 and 141; p. 449 for sections 158 and 159; p. 452for sections 160 and 161) or all sections of a chapter (TPJ p. 300 for chap. 72;p. 382 for chap. 92; p. 516 for chap. 108; p. 627 for chap. 114; p. 667 forchap. 117; p. 674 for chap. 118; p. 683 for chap. 119), although the linkage issometimes difficult to recognize (TPJ p. 186 for chap. 50; p. 522 for chap. 109;p. 562 for chap. 111). There are also cases where a summary seems to be missing(sections 99-101 and 151-52) or does not seem to fit the section (section 213).13. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn13] See TPJ p. 754.14. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn14] See Petersen 1990a: 209. Wang Ming (TPJ pp.755-57) argues that the Chao makes use of a text not divided into 366 sections.He shows that the Chao takes summaries—which the transmitted text has at the endof chapters 92 and 111, dealing with all the separate sections in eachchapter—as the titles for its own digest of each chapter as if there had been nosections. In pursuing his argument, Wang Ming does not consider S 4226. He has apoint, however. There are many instances where the Chao does not follow thesequence of sections and chapters of the textus receptus. While we can say thatit includes more or less the material contained in the S 4226 TPJ, we cannot besure whether the text it followed was structured in exactly the same way as theS 4226 table of contents suggests.15. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn15] This brings to mind the number of 170 juanmentioned in Ge Hong’s bibliography. The TPJ (74.179) itself gives the figure of360 for the number of days in a year. In a similar vein, the Taiping jing fuwenxu (TPJ p. 744), that is, the Preface to the Double Character Talismans of theScripture on Great Peace, written after the production of the sixth-centurytext, states, erroneously we must assume, that the text had 360 zhang 章. S 4226gives the figure as “366pian 篇” (Yoshioka 1970: 59).16. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn16] See TPJ 169.482.17. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn17] We cannot exclude the possibility that theoriginal text might have looked more organized than it does today. The loss ofthe first of its ten divisions might have deprived us of some means ofunderstanding its structure, although the table of contents does not indicatethis. However, S 4226 seems to quote mainly from this first division, as if itwere basic to the rest.18. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn18] See section 48, above, and compare Yu (1997 and1999) for the TPJ’s unusual use of characters.19. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn19] See Zuercher 1977 and “Introduction,” above.20.

[Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn23] See Hachiya 1983 and Takahashi 1988.24.

Liu Zhongyu (1994) refers to the TPJ talismans as an example of the way inwhich talismans in general were built from individual characters. Wang Yucheng(1991: 46f.) quotes the complaints expressed in the Baopu zi (Neipian 19.97)about the lack of perspicuity in recently produced talismans and sees the TPJtalismans as relatively clear and “understandable.”27. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn27] Chun (the pure one) is the only disciplementioned by name (TPJ 65.146; 78.187; 79.195; 99.224). His status differsslightly from that of the others.28. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn28] The six are mentioned in TPJ 77.168; section 99(liu fang zhen ren 六方真人 at the opening of the session, liu zi 六子 and liu zhenren in the following); 101.231 (liu zi); 104.258 and passim (zi liu ren);109.291 (liu fang zhen ren); section 127 (liu fang zhen ren at the opening ofthe session, and liu zhen ren and liu zi later on); section 129 (liu fang zhenren at the opening followed by liu zhen ren on p. 333); 151.408.29. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn29] For writings, see sections 67, 68, 69,72,75; forprognostics, see section 68; for plants and animals, see sections 70 and 71; forcosmic order, see sections 73 and 83; for acupuncture, see section 74; fortombs, see section 76; for music, see section 77.30. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn30] See TPJ 72.176; 77.184 and 185. This does notmean that in layer B believers are not expected to distribute texts and admonishothers to implement what they say, but different words are used. For example, itis said that heaven has sent “good texts and good men (shan wen shan ren) tokeep records written on silk and bamboo” to convey the message to futuregenerations: “this text must be adhered to 當法此書 (see TPJ 114.627).31. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn31] See TPJ 68.171; 75.181. For layer B the twocharacters occur only in TPJ 190.582 and 203.627.32. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn32] A remarkable exception is Li Xian’s (651–84)quotation of a TPJ passage to annotate Xiang Kai’s Hou Han shu biography (seeTPJ p. 733). The fact that Li Xian was not a practicing Daoist might have madethe term less problematic for him than for writers whose works were transmittedin the Daoist canon.33. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn33] Hachiya Kunio 1983: 37 has commented on thisproblem.34. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn34] See above, TPJ 66.167.35. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn35] See TPJ 187.573.36. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn36] See TPJ 179.528.37. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn37] See above, TPJ 59.101f.38. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn38] Takahashi (1988: 265-81) argues that they do.39. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn39] See, for instance, Zhen ’gao 6.74.40. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn40] Espesset (2002b) gives a good description of thisfigure and his bureaucratic rule over what Espesset calls a pantheon of deities.Since they are all spirits active in heaven’s interest, this term is perhaps alittle misleading.41. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn41] Also written wei 唯; see TPJ 182.555.42. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn42] See sections 192 and 194.43. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn43] See TPJ 192.592-594.44. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn44] See TPJ 196.605f.45. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn45] See above, section 46.46. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn46] As, for instance, compounds including ji 藉 or bu簿; cf. Espesset 2002b.47. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn47] Hachiya (1983) gives an excellent short accountof the notions stressed in the two different layers in his analysis of “dialoguestyle” and “prose and conversation style.” He mentions the notion of communitystressed in the one, as opposed to the individual stressed in the other, and allthat this entails for the project of salvation, which is an aim common to bothlayers; cf. also Espesset’s (2002b) account of layer B bureaucratic procedures.48. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn48] Cheng fu occurs in layer B in TPJ 179.534;182.550; 184.561; 197.608; the twelve thousand beings and objects are mentionedin TPJ 200.615.49. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn49] See, for instance, the end of section 189 on theneed to make the truth known.50. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn50] See section 200.51. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn51] The expressions jin que 金闕 (golden gate) and shouziran (guard what is as it is) used in layer C passages (TPJ 168.471 and 472)occur nowhere else in the text. “Golden gate” points to the Latter Sage of theGolden Gate. This sage played a role in sixth- century Daoism and, as shownabove, was associated with the TPJ to add to the text’s authority. The Chao inits transmitted form has a passage that tells how the sage instigated theproduction of a Scripture on Great Peace. However, judging by the S 4226 tableof contents, this passage was added to the text of the Chao at a later stage,certainly before the compilation of the Ming dynasty Daoist canon, to replace apart that had been lost.52. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn52] As set forth in the first part of S 4226; seeYoshioka 1970: 18.53. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn53] See Maeda 1994: 172, and cf. Strickmann 1977:17f.54. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn54] See Espesset 2002a.55. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn55] In this respect, I am not quite clear on thecriteria Espesset uses for his own attribution.56. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn56] I cannot place anywhere the first four lines (TPJp. 718) that precede what Wang Ming has correctly identified as the title ofchapter 1. The topic is da shun zhi dao 大順 之道 (the way of great prosperity),which men are reminded to approach through the production of texts. The argumentis spurious and unclear. The title of S 4226 section 39 in part 2, Zaozuo jingshu fa 造作經書法 (The method of creating scriptures), would cover the passage, butthe author of the Chao tends to keep material from each part of the TPJ separateand place it in the relevant parts of the Chao.For the first chapter, the use of fu hua 浮華 (frivolous and superficial) and shouben 守本 (guard the root) (p. 720) point to layer A, where both expressions arefrequent; they do not occur in layer B material. The use of the isolated phrasehe ye 何也 (what does it mean, or what do you mean) (p. 719, twice) is typical oflayer A dialogues.57. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn57] Yu (2001a: 3) corrects Wang Ming’s reading. Thephrase yi zi fang 以自防 belongs to the end of chapter 1, and chapter 2 starts withque 都, as does its title in the S 4226 rendering.58. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn58] This is followed by chapter 4 in the rendering ofWang Ming, who adheres to Yoshioka’s identification (1970: 20). If we reducedthe chapter title given in the Chao to the second half—Zi xiao qing shen xing fa自消清身 亍法 (The method to achieve dissolving the self and purifying the body)—andleft the first half—fenbie xingrong xie 分別形容邪—at the end of chapter 3, thischapter title would correspond to S 4226 chapter 15, Qing shen shou yi fa 清身守一法(The method to purify the body and guard the one). The relevant Chao passagediscusses the concept of shou yi (TPJ p. 724).59. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn59] The use of di wang (emperors and kings) and yi di(barbarians) (p. 725) points to layer A.60. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn60] The expression bai xing 百姓 (the hundredsurnames), p. 726, does not occur in layer B. Layer A typically uses wuyou 無優(untroubled), as used here to describe the state of mind of a ruler whoimplements great peace reforms: see sections 61 and 62.61. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn61] The use of di wang (p. 732) points to layer A.62. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn62] Those chapters and sections for which the Chaodoes not provide any material are not listed. S 4226 shows that the last twochapters of this part were subdivided into sections.63. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn63] The Chao’s rendering of this and the followingchapter is rhetorically more impressive than usual. The sentence structure isregular, with marked parallelism, and there are rhymed passages.64. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn64] The passage has tian di kaibi 天地開闢 (p. 12), aphrase that occurs only in layer A.65. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn65] The passage has di wang (p. 14), which occursonly in layer A. Several lines (p. 14.4-10) of the rendition of this chaptermake up the Chao version of chap. 33 (p. 22.1-3). We cannot tell whether this isbased on an error of the Chao or on the wording of the original TPJ text.66. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn66] A discussion of good and bad, as suggested by theS 4226 title of chapter 24, starts with wan wu jie ban hao ban e 萬物皆半好半惡.67. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn67] The passage deals with spirits, a topic of bothchapters 25 and 26, according to S 4226. It contains di wang and wu (me).68. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn68] The phrase ke bu shen zai 可不慎哉 used in thispassage occurs in TPJ 60.111 and 81.204, both of which belong to layer Amaterial. However, it also occurs in TPJ 185.566 in material that is difficultto attribute. Shen (be careful), on the other hand, is used frequently in layerB material; cf. section 179, where it is used throughout.69. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn69] The expression di wang occurs twice on p. 17.70. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn70] The phrase zhen ren wen shen ren 真人問神人 points tolayer A.71. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn71] The use of fu hua (frivolous and superficial) (p.21) points to layer A.72. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn72] For this chapter, the Chao gives the chapterheading and three lines, which repeat what was said for chapter 22.73. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn73] Wang and Yu divide this material into twosections, but more divisions are possible. The question that is raised on p. 26,line 11—“How do we know a doctrine’s efficacy”—seems to start a new section. S4226 has six sections for this chapter. Only the title for section 40—“How toexplain reception and transmission”—occurs in the Chao. Moreover, the Chaomaterial does not match the titles for any of the chapter 34 sections astransmitted in S 4226. It consists of dialogues between the Perfected andSpiritlike Man.74. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn74] This section contains enough CelestialMaster-type dialogue elements to attribute it with certainty to layer A. Also,for the first part, the phrase wu zhi tian yi bu qi zi 吾知天意不欺子 (I know thatheaven does not intend to betray you) (p. 23) and the occurrence of di wang (p.22) and tian di kaibi (pp. 22 and 23) point to layer A.75. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn75] The Daoist canon textus receptus does not mentionthe TPJ’s ten parts but has chapters as the largest unit. The S 4226 table ofcontents organizes chapters and sections in ten parts. The fact that thereceived text starts with section 35, that is, with the first section of part 3,and ends with chapter 119, that is, the last chapter of part 7, attests to thetext being transmitted as divided into parts.76. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn76] Wang Ming sees the Master’s Declaration aschapter 38. S 4226 has the title “The method of guarding the one\" (shouyi fa)and Master’s Declaration as the title for chapter and section 20; see above,section 50, for more details.77. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn77] The term di wang occurs in this passage.78. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn78] The terms fu hua and di wang point to layer Amaterial.79. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn79] The passage has wu dao and wu shu, which do notoccur in layer B material.80. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn80] The Chao starts part 4 with a section title andquotations that are close to the title given in S 4226 for section 79. TheDaoist canon lacks chapter 52 (53 follows after 51) and section 80 (79 isfollowed by 81). This confusion at the beginning of part 4 confirms that at onestage the division of the text into parts was more prominent than it is in thepresent edition of the Daoist canon; cf. above, note 75.81. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn81] The term Celestial Lord (tian jun) points tolayer B, although it also occurs in section 63 (p. 295) understood as “heaven”and “lord.”82. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn82] The Celestial Lord is mentioned several times.The topic is the accounts kept in heaven.83. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn83] The passage contains the expressions di wang andwuyou (untroubled); it deals with the prohibition of wine.84. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn84] The expression di wang points to layer Amaterial.85. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn85] The expression he wei ye 何謂也 (What do you mean?)points to layer A.86. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn86] The expression wu shu occurs only in layer A.87. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn87] The expression di wang points to layer A.88. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn88] The expression di wang points to layer A; thepassage deals with different ranks of moral perfection, one of the CelestialMaster’s favorite topics.89. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn89] The expression qing wen occurs in layer A only.90. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn90] There are breaks at p. 252, line 8, p. 253, line13, and p. 254, line 10. The last session returns to the “six crimes.” The thirddialogue, starting p. 253, deals with shi fa 十法, here “ten methods to rule acountry.” The term is otherwise used for the ten Mahayana rules for thinking andliving (Soothill 1972: 51).91. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn91] Toward the beginning of the section, there aremore colloquial elements than is customary in the Chao.92. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn92] The expression wu zhi shu 吾之書 points to layer A.93. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn93] The expression di wang points to layer A; thesection deals with the ancient ways of governing.94. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn94] On p. 301 there is some confusion in regard tothe allocation of Chao passages. Lines 3-4 belong to the Chao account of section108.95. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn95] The phrase di wang points to layer A.96. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn96] The phrase yuan wen 願聞(I would like to know . ..) points to layer A.97. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn97] From p. 305, line 10 until the end of the passagethe text consists mainly of rhymed seven-character phrases.98. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn98] The passage has the expression di wang. There arerhymed seven-character phrases starting with p. 306, line 12, and thefour-character phrases at the beginning of the passage are regular.99. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn99] This section is long; the phrase xing qu 行 去 (Youmay go now) occurs on pp. 322 and 326. The six disciples are mentioned pp. 314,318, 319, and 323.100. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn100] The use of zi (you)—” If you ignore what is asit is you can’t live long” —in an admonitory phrase points to layer A.101. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn101] The break is p. 334, line 7.102. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn102] The use of zi (you)—”If you guard dao, whereshould disorder come from?”— points to layer A.103. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn103] There are perhaps two dialogues. The topic ismodified on p. 380, line 4.104. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn104] The six are mentioned on pp. 394, 395, and 397;there is a break on p. 394, line 11, and another, which remains only rhetorical,on p. 395, line 9.105. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn105] The phrase yu zhi daxiao 欲知大效 (If you want tosee the proof of this . . .) occurs frequently in layer A material. However, thesection deals with the units of life suan 算, which is a layer B topic.106. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn106] The use of zi (you)—“I would now like toexplain to you something else”—points to layer A.107. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn107] The expression di wang occurs twice.108. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn108] The expression di wang is used on p. 467.109. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn109] The editor of the sixth-century text has made amistake here. The section continues the session started in section 151, probablyp. 408, line 8, where, in reply to the disciple’s demand for instruction, theCelestial Master starts to talk about guarding the one. Section 152 lacks allintroductory elements because it continues this discussion.110. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn110] The section (on p. 426) has the unusualeditorial phrase “The Perfected says\" (zhen ren yue).111. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn111] The text accompanying this and the followingillustration has certain colloquial elements reminiscent of the dialogues inlayer A (duoduo 咄咄 occurs only in layer A material) and layer B (shen zhi 慎之 isfrequent in layers A and B).112. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn112] The phrase wu shu (my book) points to layer Amaterial.113. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn113] The passage mentions the “golden gate\" (jinque). It contains on p. 472 a sequence of ten seven-character lines that arerhymed, as has been pointed out by Wu Weimin (1989).114. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn114] With regard to content, this section belongs tolayer A. It mentions the prohibition of female infanticide, the need to allowwomen to earn a living, and the nine ranks of men.115. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn115] The expression luji 錄籍 (registers) points tolayer B; it occurs in layer A material only in section 213 (p. 681).116. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn116] The same as for section 185; moreover, thereare the expressions suan (units of life), jinji 禁忌 (proscriptions), and,repeatedly, bu 簿 (registers).117. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn117] The same as for section 185; there is also theterm zhu shen 諸神 (all the spirits), which is much more frequent in layer Bmaterial.118. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn118] The phrase zhen ren ji yi ci wen fu you de zhiguo 真人急以此文付有德之國 (Perfected, give this text quickly to a ruler [guo here in themeaning of guo jun, which is unusual for the TPJ] with virtue) (p. 575) istypical of layer A material. It does not occur in layer B. The section alsocontains several layer B expressions: luji (registers), zhu shen (all thespirits), Celestial Lord (578.2), and cao 曹 (bureau) (579.10), which isfrequently used in layer B (cf. Espesset 2002b) and does not occur in layer A. Iassume, therefore, that the section consists of two parts, and that the layer Bpart starts at 576.5 with chang yan 常言.119. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn119] Expressions like mingbu (registers of life) andyusuan 餘算 (remaining units of life) point to layer B. The section deals withdetails of proper moral conduct, and toward the end it is said that publicationof this text will remove all doubts.120. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn120] There are no manifest layer A elements, but afew dialogue elements; “registers” and “all the spirits” are mentioned.121. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn121] Chapter 115, which is supposed to containsections 204 and 205, is missing in the received text. There are passages in theChao that deal with topics of S 4226 headings for sections 204 and 205. In WangMing’s edition they are placed after the long “chapter 116, section 204” (pp.629-46). The Chao version of section 204 (TPJ p. 647) repeats lines from theChao version of section 94 (TPJ p. 219); it has the expressions wu shu and wudao.122. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn122] The passage contains several layer A dialogueelements, such as qing wen and yu sheng 愚生 (this foolish pupil).123. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn123] The section number, which is given as 204 inthe received text, is changed to 206. The section is of unusual length anddiversity. Its main topic is music, as suggested by the S 4226 section title.124. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn124] For part 8, Wang Ming does not attempt to linkChao material to the section titles transmitted in S 4226, but Luo (1996) and Yu(2001a) do, and in most cases quite convincingly. We may assume that the Chaodeals with these chapters and sections of the TPJ in the same way as with thechapters and sections that have been transmitted in the textus receptus. Theamount of material quoted is about the same as for parts 1, 2, 4, and 5 but istwice as much for parts 3, 6, and 7, which is based on the fact that these partsare about twice as long as parts 4 and 5. Therefore, we may assume that, inlength, parts 8 and 9 resembled parts 4 and 5 rather than the longer parts.125. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn125] The phrase qing wen that is used in thispassage occurs only in layer A.126. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn126] The passage contains the phrase “I personallyadvise and command you the Perfected to make the writings public.”127. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn127] The passage contains the expression di wang.128. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn128] The topic is order and hierarchy within thebody.129. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn129] The passage contains the phrase “What a goodquestion!” (shan zai zi zhi wen ye 善哉子之問也).130. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn130] The passage contains the expression di wang (p.689).131. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn131] The passage contains the expressions “Now doesthe Perfected understand this?” and “my true text.”132. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn132] The passage contains the expression di wang.133. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn133] The passage is introduced by qing wen.134. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn134] The passage has wu (me) and in particular theformula “Remember what my book says and make use of it.”135. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn135] It is possible but not necessary to link thispassage with the title that S 4226 attributes to section 226; cf. Yu (2001a:516f.) and Luo (1996: 1154).136. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn136] The passage contains he ye (What do you mean?).137. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn137] The passage contains wu (me): “Now someone whoconducts himself well, in line with my writings, will have the units [that makeup his life] (suan) increased, up in heaven as well as down below.” Concernabout “units of life” is much more pronounced in layer B. However, the passageat hand also has the expression du shi 度世 (to transcend), which hardly occurs inlayer B material.138. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn138] The passage contains he ye (What do you mean?).139. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn139] The da shen who figures in this passage is notthe Great Spirit who acts as a discussant in layer B material, but someonesuperior to small and medium spirits, and on the same level of achievement as dadao 大 道. There is the expression du shi.140. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn140] This short passage must have provenirresistible to the author of the Chao, which is not only a digest but also aflorilegium:The teachings (dao) of great peace—their text is attested to, the country [wherethey prevail] is rich. They are heaven’s decree and a person’s treasure. Theycome forth from the heart and encircle the world. Do as they tell you and youcan make the world secure and your family rich.This is phrased in short three- and four-character phrases, very different fromthe way in which the Celestial Master expresses himself.141. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn141] This has the expression di wang.142. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn142] The passage is introduced by qing wen.143. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn143] The short passage following the quotation fromsection 258 is introduced by qing wen.144. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn144] The passage is introduced by the phrase “If youwant to make sure that later generations will always be attentive and faithful,then look after yourself and cherish yourself.”145. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn145] The passage is introduced by qing wen.146. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn146] The passage is introduced by qing wen and hasthe phrase “This will free emperors and kings from trouble (wuyou 無憂) and letthem live long.”147. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn147] The expression di wang occurs twice.148. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn148] The expressions di wang and wu (me) point tolayer A. There are dialogue elements.149. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn149] This short passage deals with the need forintrospection, as does the title of S 4226 section 273. Its position in the Chaolinks it to the S 4226 section 288, “The eight [types of] men who can follow thethree ways of eating,” for which Yu (2001a: 541) rightly refers to a Sandongzhunang quotation of the TPJ: see TPJ pp. 716f.150. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn150] The passage is introduced by qing wen; shen ren(spiritlike man) acts as a partner in the dialogue; the phrase he zai 何哉 (Whatdo you mean?) also occurs.151. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn151] The passage is introduced by qing wen andfeatures a spiritlike man, who says “I (wu) have received these writings fromthe spirits (zhu shen) in heaven.”152. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn152] The expression di wang is used twice.153. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn153] The passage is introduced by the phrase wen yue問 曰, which is found frequently only in the Chao rendition of part 9—see sections282-284, 286—and, to the extent to which they figure in the Chao, sections297-315. Passages thus introduced show several layer A characteristics.Elsewhere in the TPJ the phrase occurs in section 108, which depicts a talkbetween Perfected and shen ren, as is common in Chao representations of layer Apassages. Wang Xuanhe (fl. 683) uses the phrase in his Sandong zhunang whenquoting a layer A dialogue (TPJ 61.122), and Zhu Faman (d. 720) uses the phrasetwice in the Yaoxiu keyi jielu chao (TPJ pp. 215 and 309) when quoting talksbetween Celestial Master, termed shen ren, as in the Chao, and disciple. Forpart 9 of the Chao we may assume that the figure who raises a question is meantto be the Perfected. Judging from the quotations referred to above, wen yue wasa common rendering of the peculiar and circumstantial way in which CelestialMaster dialogues were begun. We may also conclude that for part 9 the Chao wasbased on an original text whose condensed format differed from the main part oflayer A (A’ is used to indicate this material). In this respect one can draw aparallel to chapter 50 (sections 67-77) at the end of part 3, whose contentresembles layer A, with which it also shares certain expressions while beingwritten in regular and brief literary prose.154. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn154] As above; the question raised in this sectionis “What does it mean that the Taiping jing has 170 chapters (Taiping jing heyibai qishi juan wei yi 太平經何以百七十 巻為意)?” This adds to the observation that inpart 9 there are more traces of intermediate editing than in earlier parts.155. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn155] This passage is introduced by the particle wei.It deals with the Celestial Lord, the Great Spirit, the Hall of Light, and otheraspects of the celestial bureaucracy. Sections 291 to 296 follow suit.156. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn156] The passage is introduced by wen yue. Itcontains dialogue elements.157. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn157] The passage is introduced by wen yue. It readslike a summary of a certain layerA view of history, but is too well written and too compact to really be part ofit:The following question was raised: [Although] in ancient times there were nowritings, the way of heaven was without disorder.[The answer:] At that time heaven’s contract quanwen 券文 [cf. zhen quan as usedin section 51] had not yet appeared, but a spiritlike man of supreme majesty(shang huang shen ren 上皇神人) [also in section 290, layer B] was in control whoinvestigated the root of things, keeping in view the ancestors [and theirproceedings]. With the division from majestic heaven, the distance from heaven’sway gradually increased and in sorrow and disorder heaven’s intentions were nolonger understood. So heaven issued a contract, made a wise man write it out,and had a teacher distribute it. Since the wise man is not always around, itmust be properly recorded for later generations. When this is done, heaven’s waywill be in order when qi of great peace arrives.158. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn158] The passage deals with the Celestial Lord andwith tianshang zhi shi 天上之士, a “celestial gentleman” who is powerful like anheir apparent.159. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn159] This passage is introduced by wen yue. Itproposes a two-tier approach (west and east, man and woman, Yin and Yang)instead of stressing the three, as is common in the TPJ.160. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn160] The passage is introduced by wen yue; wu (me)occurs: “Now I can provide long-lasting protection against the recurrence ofdisasters.”161. [Appendix.xhtml#rapp1fn161] The passage is introduced by wen yue. It dealswith guarding the one."},{"pageContent":"BIBLIOGRAPHYABBREVIATIONSChaoRefers to the Taiping jing chao, a late Tang dynasty digest of the TPJ.
