Soon enough a backlash set in,and some even contended that therewas no such group as “Confucians,” noschool of thought that could be called“Confucianism.” The name“Confucius” was a painfully Latinatetranslation of Kong fuzi 孔夫子,"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"literally, “Master Kong,” andconstructions such as “Confucian” and“Confucianism” are, semanticallyspeaking, specifically Western andtherefore totally alien to Chineseculture; surely it would be moreappropriate to use the word adopted byChinese writers to refer to thefollowers of the sage, ru.6But this is a word full of ambiguity.While thinkers in the Warring Statesperiod often called the followers ofConfucius ru, the word’s originsremain an enigma that has inspired aseries of fanciful etymologies.

As I demonstrate,the entirety of The Grand Scribe’sRecords is in dialogue with “TheCollective Biographies of Ru.” Toappreciate this dialogue, we must beginby seeing that “ru,” whom modernscholars conventionally identify as“Confucians,” were not necessarily"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"followers of Confucius; though theyhad a shared educational backgroundand a common fate, they did not forman interest group, nor did they have aconsistent political stance.

Scholars have long"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"employed genealogies to trace thetransmission of the Five Classics andmap classical studies in the Handynasty.

These groups went on to"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"produce large numbers of highofficials. One can only imagine that thelush growth of such interpretiveschools inspired those who prizedtradition to project a series of master–disciple lines back to the beginning ofthe Western Han, a retrospectiveconstruction that culminated in BanGu’s work and has never beenquestioned.Chapters 4 and 5 show that therevolutionary transformation of theintellectual world corresponded to thebirth of a new elite class.

TheHistory of Western Han records thatGongsun Hong submitted his memorialin the fifth year of Yuanshuo 元朔, thatis, 124 BCE.17 In that year, GongsunHong served either as the GrandeeSecretary or as Chancellor.18Therefore, when Sima Qian said,"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"“Gongsun Hong was a xueguan,” heobviously did not mean that GongsunHong was an official-teacher in chargeof teaching, as Hanyu da cidian andDai Kan-Wa jiten indicate.

Thenhe listed those of Master Shen’sdisciples who were awarded suchsinecures as Grand Master, Gentlemanof the Interior, and so on.

If theperfect administrative wisdom—Wayof the King—could only be appreciatedthrough a study of the Five Classics,the men who studied those works hadto be the most suitable candidates forofficial positions, and officials withoutsuch training were not qualified fortheir posts.39The very professional skillsmastered by men schooled in the FiveClassics were contrasted with theirfrustrating official careers. Sima Qianstarted with the sage Confucius, whohad confidently declared, “If someoneemploys me, I will accomplish"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"something within three years,” only toremain perennially unemployed. Thehistorian then connected the Qinslaughter of shushi to theunemployment of ru during the earlyHan period. The ironic combination ofhigh qualifications and scantemployment aroused the consciousnessof the common fate of men schooled inthe Five Classics, thereby fostering thedevelopment of a group identity.Against this potential identity, thedifference in ru’s political andphilosophical positions faded into thebackground, becoming insignificant.Second, Sima Qian tactfully revisedthe history, casting Confucius, who waswidely regarded among Han literati as"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"a sage and an uncrowned king, as theforefather of ru officials, reinforcingthe bond he had dreamt up for thisgroup.Playing with the widely acceptedclaim that Confucius was a perfect rubecause of his expertise in the FiveClassics, Sima Qian—for the first timein history—directly attributed the FiveClassics to Confucius.

Sima Qian constantlyemphasized the bond betweenConfucius and the ru group.For example, he said, “When ChenShe proclaimed himself king, the ru ofLu took the vessels transmitted fromConfucius and went and submitted toKing Chen” 陳涉之王也, 而魯諸儒持孔氏之禮器往歸陳王.41 Mencius andXunzi lived about two hundred yearsafter Confucius.

This treatment notonly aligns these stories in a seeminglysequential time without historicaldisturbances, it suggests that ru,shushi, and Erudites faced similarconditions. In this narrative structure,the originally obscure relationshipamong Confucius, shushi, and rubecomes tangible and fathomable.Furthermore, Sima Qian frequentlyused the causal clause to connectdifferent events, identifying theprotagonists in different stories witheach other. Here is a passagedescribing the early Han courts: “WhenEmperor Jing succeeded to the throne,he did not employ ru. His mother,"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"Empress Dowager Dou, adhered to theteachings of Huang-Lao. Therefore, theErudites, holding their empty officialtitles, waited to be consulted, and noone advanced to administrative posts”及至孝景, 不任儒者, 而竇太后又好黃老之術, 故諸博士 具官待問, 未有進者. We know that in the Qin and Hanru and Erudites were not identical. Onecould become an Erudite bydemonstrating expertise in the FiveClassics—or expertise in Laozi andZhuangzi.43 But in The Grand Scribe’sRecords, Sima Qian conflated thesetwo categories, and said that theimperial decision not to employ rumeant that Erudites had no opportunityfor advancement: the slippage is"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"evident once you appreciate thedistinction between the categories.And when describing EmperorWu’s court, Sima Qian wrote: “Whenthe present emperor came to the throne,officials such as Zhao Wan and WangZang advocated ru learning.

Sima Qianrecorded the names and positions oftwenty-two ru officials who servedunder Emperor Wu; he devotedbiographical sketches to six of them,organizing the information accordingto a carefully contrived scheme.Dwelling on the textual tradition,Sima Qian laid out five communities:those of the Songs, the Documents, theBook of Rites (hereafter, Rites), the"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"Changes, and the Annals. Each he gaveits own interpretive schools, centeringon the founding master and extendingto his disciples. This teacher–disciplenetwork determined the order in whichthe names of ru officials underEmperor Wu were listed (see table2.1).When discussing the community ofthe Songs, Sima Qian mentioned threeinterpretive traditions, one establishedby Master Shen of Lu, anotherestablished by Yuan Gu of Qi, and thethird established by Mr. Han 韓生 ofYan 燕. Nine officials under EmperorWu were identified as the disciples ofMaster Shen and one, Ni Kuan, wasidentified as the disciple of Master"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"Shen’s disciple Kong Anguo. As wehave seen, Sima also said that hundredsof Master Shen’s disciples wereflourishing as officials of the currentregime. In discussing the interpretiveschool established by Yuan Gu, heclaimed that those from Qi who haddistinguished themselves by theirknowledge of the Songs were alldisciples of Yuan Gu. As for Mr. Han,he contended that those who talkedabout the Songs in Yan and Zhao 趙 allcould trace their learning back to Mr.Han; two of Han’s disciples were Mr.Ben 賁生 and Han Shang 韓商, thelatter said to be the grandson of Mr.Han.Sima Qian realized that these three"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"schools had different interpretivemodels, and that even people he placedin the same school offered differenttakes on the Songs. But he waved awaythese dissonant notes, claiming thatwhile the founders of these threeschools used different words toelaborate their teachings, in fact theyshared the same guidelines. This meantthat every official serving underEmperor Wu who claimed to be anexpert in the Songs was connected,forming a homogenous textualcommunity.Sima Qian applied the sameformula to the scholars who specializedin the four other classics.

Because somemen had knowledge of more than oneclassic, these five textual communitiesoverlapped to some extent. Forexample, Zhou Ba 周霸 studied theSongs with Mr. Shen and the Changeswith Yang He. Kong Anguo was listedas a member of both the community"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"surrounding the Songs and that of theDocuments.While membership of thesecommunities was defined by what bookone studied with which master,achievements of those ru were definedby one’s rank in the officialdom. Foreach of the biographies in this chapter,Sima Qian began by tracing the originof his learning and ended with the posthe had obtained. In fact, the membersof textual communities whom SimaQian specifically mentioned andprofiled tended to be the ones who hadobtained official positions. This wasunderlined in the text. He started hisintroduction of Master Shen’s disciplesby saying, “Among the disciples of"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"Master Shen, more than ten becameErudites” 弟子為博士者十餘人.44 Helisted three disciples of DongZhongshu who, he reckoned, hadfulfilled their ambitions—two rose toofficial positions ranked above onethousand bushels. As to the disciples ofDong Zhongshu who got a nod, theybecame Special Envoy to the emperor(ming dafu 命大夫).45 Hence, thetextual communities depicted by SimaQian, though organized by teacher–disciple relationships, were orientedtoward officialdom. This made sense:after all, the Five Classics conveyedthe Way of the King, so men schooledin these works could only realize theirpotential through applying their"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"knowledge of the Way of King to theirsociety.Table 2.1.

On that occasion, “Yuan Gusaid to Gongsun Hong, ‘Mr. Gongsun,always strive to base your words oncorrect learning.

Ofthe members of this seemingly well-constructed community, Sima Qiancould give only one person’s full name,that is, Ni Kuan, who had risen to highoffice during Sima Qian’s lifetime.Is it possible that Sima Qian didknow the full names of Fu, Zhang, andOuyang, skipping their given namesbecause they were well known?

At the same time, Ni Kuan, ahigh official, was widely known tohave specialized in the same book.

Why is Xu’s full namenot given? In fact, of the fifty peopleaffiliated with the textual communitiesSima Qian described, ten wereidentified only by their surnames or byno name at all.I will mention a few other doubts.Sima Qian contended that the menfrom Qi who mastered the Songs allwere disciples of Yuan Gu—withoutmentioning a single other name.
